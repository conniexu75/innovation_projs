https://openalex.org/W1975318518,"Moving groups of animals, including fish, ungulates, birds and honeybee swarms seem able to take complex decisions in the absence of signalling mechanisms, and when group members cannot establish who has or has not got information. A numerical simulation shows how such groups can make accurate consensus decisions, and that the larger the group, the smaller the proportion of informed individuals needed to guide the group. A very small proportion of informed individuals is sufficient for near maximal accuracy. This has implications for our understanding of the evolution of information transfer in groups, and also suggests a new design protocol for the guidance of grouping robots. Cover photo, by Phillip Colla Natural History Photography ( http://www.OceanLight.com ), shows schooling jack mackerel. For animals that forage or travel in groups, making movement decisions often depends on social interactions among group members1,2. However, in many cases, few individuals have pertinent information, such as knowledge about the location of a food source3,4, or of a migration route5,6,7,8,9. Using a simple model we show how information can be transferred within groups both without signalling and when group members do not know which individuals, if any, have information. We reveal that the larger the group the smaller the proportion of informed individuals needed to guide the group, and that only a very small proportion of informed individuals is required to achieve great accuracy. We also demonstrate how groups can make consensus decisions, even though informed individuals do not know whether they are in a majority or minority, how the quality of their information compares with that of others, or even whether there are any other informed individuals. Our model provides new insights into the mechanisms of effective leadership and decision-making in biological systems."

Here we fabricate a paper-like material that consists of hexagonally packed bundles of clean, coaxial carbon nanotubes whose double walls vary little in diameter; it is prepared in high yields using chemical-vapour deposition with a conditioning catalyst and two-step purification. Our results will enable investigation of the physical properties of double-walled carbon nanotubes, which are predicted to be superior to those of both their single- and multiwalled relatives."

https://openalex.org/W2039528431,"The trace biogenic amine tyramine is present in the nervous systems of animals ranging in complexity from nematodes to mammals. Tyramine is synthesized from tyrosine by the enzyme tyrosine decarboxylase (TDC), a member of the aromatic amino acid family, but this enzyme has not been identified in Drosophila or in higher animals. To further clarify the roles of tyramine and its metabolite octopamine, we have cloned two TDC genes from Drosophila melanogaster, dTdc1 and dTdc2. Although both gene products have TDC activity in vivo, dTdc1 is expressed nonneurally, whereas dTdc2 is expressed neurally. Flies with a mutation in dTdc2 lack neural tyramine and octopamine and are female sterile due to egg retention. Although other Drosophila mutants that lack octopamine retain eggs completely within the ovaries, dTdc2 mutants release eggs into the oviducts but are unable to deposit them. This specific sterility phenotype can be partially rescued by driving the expression of dTdc2 in a dTdc2-specific pattern, whereas driving the expression of dTdc1 in the same pattern results in a complete rescue. The disparity in rescue efficiencies between the ectopically expressed Tdc genes may reflect the differential activities of these gene products. The egg retention phenotype of the dTdc2 mutant and the phenotypes associated with ectopic dTdc expression contribute to a model in which octopamine and tyramine have distinct and separable neural activities.

Tyramine, octopamine, and other “trace” biogenic amines are found in most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, and plants, and in animals ranging in complexity from nematodes to mammals. Despite their wide distribution, the biological roles of trace amines are poorly understood. In vertebrates, trace amines are present in low levels and can displace classical biogenic amines from their stores and stimulate outward neurotransmitter efflux from biogenic amine transporters (1Parker E.M. Cubeddu L.X. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1988; 245: 199-210PubMed Google Scholar). Although there are currently no data to suggest that there are dedicated synapses for trace amines in the brain, the recent discovery of G-protein-coupled receptors that are selectively activated by trace amines (2Borowsky B.

A large body of clinical literature suggests a role for tyramine in the etiology of several psychiatric disorders (reviewed in Ref. 4Branchek T.A. Blackburn T.P. Curr. Opin.

In invertebrates, little is known about the functional role of tyramine (reviewed in Ref. 5Roeder T. Seifert M. Kahler C. Gewecke M. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 2003; 54: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), although distinct tyraminergic patterns of expression are thought to exist in locusts (6Downer R.G. Hiripi L. Juhos S. Neurochem. Res. 1993; 18: 1245-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and C. elegans, 1M. Alkema and R. Horvitz, personal communication. and receptors with preferential response to tyramine have been identified in many insects (reviewed in Ref. 5Roeder T. Seifert M. Kahler C. Gewecke M. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 2003; 54: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Additionally, tyramine affects chloride permeability in the Drosophila Malpighian tubule (7Blumenthal E.M. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 284: C718-C728Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), relaxation of muscle tone in the locust oviduct (8Donini A. Lange A.B. J.

Biol. 1999; 9: 853-860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Octopamine in invertebrates is often considered to be the functional homolog of vertebrate norepinephrine and is involved in a diverse range of physiological processes (reviewed in Ref. 10Roeder T. Prog. Neurobiol. 1999; 59: 533-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), including Drosophila female fertility. Flies that lack a functional octopamine receptor or cannot synthesize octopamine due to a null allele of tyramine β-hydroxylase (Tβh) 2The abbreviations used are: Tβh and TBH, tyramine β-hydroxylase; TDC, tyrosine decarboxylase; AADC, aromatic amino acid decarboxylase; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; CNS, central nervous system; GFP, green fluorescent protein; TRITC, tetramethyl-rhodamine isothiocyanate; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; JH, juvenile hormone; DOPA, dihydroxyphenylalanine. show a complete egg retention phenotype (11Lee H.G. Seong C.S. Kim Y.C. Davis R.L. Han K.A. Dev. Biol. 2003; 264: 179-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 12Monastirioti M. Dev. Biol. 2003; 264: 38-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 13Monastirioti M. Linn C.E. White K. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3900-3911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sterility of Tβh null females is due to a defect in ovulation, which can be rescued by octopamine feeding or by driving the ectopic expression of a Tβh transgene in several driver lines that show overlapping expression in the thoracic tip of the CNS (12Monastirioti M. Dev. Biol. 2003; 264: 38-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 13Monastirioti M. Linn C.E. White K. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3900-3911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The first step in octopamine biosynthesis is catalyzed by tyrosine decarboxylase (TDC) (Fig. 1), but this enzyme has not been identified in Drosophila or in higher animals. Based upon sequence similarity to plant TDCs, we report here the cloning of two Drosophila melanogaster TDC genes, dTdc1 and dTdc2. Although both gene products have TDC activity in vivo, dTdc1 is expressed nonneurally, whereas dTdc2 is expressed neurally. Flies with a mutation in dTdc2 lack neural tyramine and octopamine and are female sterile due to egg retention; however, unlike Tβh mutants, the sterility of dTdc2 mutant females is not due to a defect in ovulation, since eggs are often found in the oviducts. Transgenic rescue of this phenotype can be accomplished by expression of either dTdc1 or dTdc2 with a dTdc2-specific driver. The specific egg retention phenotype of the dTdc2 mutant and the phenotypes associated with ectopic dTdc expression contribute to a model in which neurally derived octopamine and tyramine have distinct functions. Drosophila lines were maintained on standard cornmeal-agar medium and kept on a 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle at 25 °C. The UAS-CD8-GFP (BL-5137), UAS-GFP.nls (BL-4775), and the second chromosome deficiency kit were obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center. The cn bw and RO54, cn bw/CyO lines were a gift from Trudy Schupbach (14Schupbach T. Wieschaus E. Genetics. 1991; 129: 1119-1136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The HPLC system consisted of a Jasco model PU-2080Plus isocratic pump (Jasco Inc., Easton, MD), a Jasco model AS-950 Intelligent Autosampler with a 200-μl sample loop, and an Antec Leyden INTRO electrochemical detector (Antec Leyden, The Netherlands). The VT-03 electrochemical flow cell contained a 2-mm glassy carbon working electrode mounted with a 50-μm spacer and a salt bridge Ag/AgCl reference electrode (Antec Leyden). The cell potential was set to +800 mV, and the range was 0.5 nA/V inside a Faraday-shielded compartment set to 27.5 °C. Data from the detector were relayed to a computerized data acquisition system and analyzed using Jasco ChromPass chromatography software. Reverse phase chromatography was performed with a Hypersil 100 C18 column, 100 × 4.6-mm inner diameter, with a 5-μm particle size and 100-Å pore size (Thermo Electron Corp.). A Brownlee Validated C18 Newguard column, 15 × 3.2 mm (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), was placed between the injector and the analytical column. The mobile phase was delivered at a 1.0 ml/min flow rate. The mobile phase was carefully designed to maximize the separation and detection sensitivity of the biogenic amines octopamine, dopamine, tyramine, and serotonin. Because there is at least one peak that co-migrates with octopamine in all flies with pigmented eyes (w+), conditions were first tested in wild-type flies containing the w+ gene and then in mutant strains in order to achieve optimal separation. The co-migrating peak could be separated from octopamine using the following mobile phase: 50 mm citrate/acetate, pH 4.5, 20% acetonitrile, and 10 mm decanesulfonic acid. For brain samples, 10 adult female Drosophila brains were dissected directly into 100 μl of ice-cold mobile phase and quickly homogenized with a Teflon pestle. Homogenates were run through a 0.22-μm spin filter (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and kept at –80 °C until HPLC analysis. The typical injection volume was 10 μl. Standard mixes of octopamine, tyramine, dopamine, and serotonin (Sigma) were injected at a concentration of 10 ng/ml, and a calibration curve was generated based on injections containing 1, 5, 10, 50, and 100 pg. GAL4 Constructs—To make the GAL4 constructs, a 3.3-kb fragment from pGaTB (15Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing the coding section of the yeast GAL4 gene and an hsp3′ poly(A) segment was inserted into a genomic segment of DNA, which included either the dTdc1 or dTdc2 gene. In both cases, the GAL4 was inserted immediately before the coding start, and the entire construct (genomic segments interrupted by GAL4) was inserted into the polylinker of pCaSpeR4 (16Thummel C.S. Pirrotta V. Dros. Info. Serv. 1992; 71: 150Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was amplified with the Expand Long Template PCR system (Roche Applied Science), which contains a proofreading enzyme to ensure maximum accuracy. For dTdc1-GAL4, the genomic segment contained a region from –2938 to +3940 bp relative to the coding start site. For dTdc2-GAL4, the genomic segment contained a region from –3459 to +4530 bp. All constructs were thoroughly sequenced prior to injection into w1118 embryos. Drosophila germ line transformation was performed by a standard procedure (17Rubin G.M. Spradling A.C. Science. 1982; 218: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (2340) Google Scholar) using the plasmid pπ 25.7wc (18Karess R.E. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1984; 38: 135-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) as a source of transposase. Genetic Services, Inc. (Sudbury, MA) performed Drosophila germ line transformation for dTdc2-GAL4. UAS Constructs—The coding fragments of dTdc1 and dTdc2 were amplified from cDNA using Expand Long Template PCR system (Roche Applied Science) and inserted into the polylinker of pUAST (15Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to generate UAS-dTdc1 and UAS-dTdc2. All constructs were sequenced prior to injection into w1118 embryos. Drosophila germ line transformation was performed in house by standard procedure (17Rubin G.M. Spradling A.C. Science. 1982; 218: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (2340) Google Scholar) using the plasmid pπ 25.7wc (18Karess R.E. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1984; 38: 135-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) as a source of transposase. Total RNA was isolated from adult female Drosophila tissues using the RNAqueous®-4PCR Kit (Ambion), and cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System for reverse transcription-PCR (Invitrogen) with oligo(dT) primers. Platinum® TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen) was used for real time cDNA amplification on the Smart Cycler System (Cepheid), and SYBR Green® (19Inc Molecular Probes Bioprobes. 1993; 17: 1-3Google Scholar) was used for quantification. PCR amplification conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 2 min and 40 cycles of 95 °C, 10 s; 60 °C, 15 s; and 68 °C, 30 s. The relative expression of each gene was calculated by the Smart Cycler software version 1.2c (Cepheid) using second derivative analysis of the cycle threshold (Ct). Analysis of the melt curve by the negative first derivative was used for product identification and to ensure product purity. Only those reactions that contained single products free of primer-dimers were used in the analysis. Primers included dTdc1 (5′-TTGAGGTTCGCAACGATGTTC-3′ and 5′-AAGCACTTTATCTGGGTCCAAGC-3′), dTdc2 (5′-ACGCATTGGCAGCATCCTC-3′ and 5′-TGGCAGCAAGCATCGTGAC-3′), and rp49 (5′-AAGATCGTGAAGAAGCGCACCAA-3′ and 5′-CTGTTGTCGATACCCTTGGGCTT-3′). One 2–4-day-old female and one male were placed in individual vials, and the number of eggs was counted at 24-h intervals for 6–7 days. 15 females per genotype were analyzed. 3–5 females of the genotype Tdc2RO54/Tdc2RO54 or Tdc2RO54/Df(2R)42 were collected within 1 day of eclosion and placed on small apple-agar Petri plates with an equal number of males. Yeast paste containing either no drug, tyrosine, tryamine, or octopamine (12 or 25 mg/ml concentrations for each drug) was added to each plate. Plates were examined each day for eggs, and the total number of eggs laid was determined after approximately 1 week. At least 13 females were tested in a minimum of three replicate experiments. Drugs were also fed to cn bw parental females and did not have an adverse effect on egg laying (data not shown). Ovaries and associated oviducts were dissected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, as described in Ref. 20Cummings C.A. Cronmiller C. Development. 1994; 120: 381-394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, and rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (according to the protocol outlined by Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR)). Stained reproductive tissues were visualized with a Bio-Rad Radiance 2100 confocal microscope. Confocal images were stacked and manipulated with Image J software. Color images depict GFP as green and TRITC as magenta (overlap white) to make the images color blind-accessible. Adult brain, nerve cord, and abdominal tissues were dissected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, and GFP was visualized with a Zeiss Axioskop microscope with a CARV spinning disk confocal imaging unit. Images were stacked and manipulated with OpenLab software. For oocyte distribution in mutant and control females, reproductive tracts including ovaries were dissected in PEM buffer (0.1 m Pipes (Sigma), 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm magnesium sulfate), fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and then mounted on slides for viewing in differential interference contrast optics on a Vanox 2 Olympus research microscope. Two Candidate Tyrosine Decarboxylase Genes in the Drosophila Genome—Based on sequence similarity to plant TDCs, we identified two potential TDC genes in the D. melanogaster genome, CG30445 and CG30446. Due to the evidence in this report, we name these genes dTdc1 and dTdc2, respectively. The genes are adjacent, separated by 4.6 kb, and directly repeated on chromosome 2R at cytological position 42C3 (Fig. 2b). Alignment of the two coding sequences indicates a 52% identity at the nucleotide level and a 47% identity at the amino acid level. Both proteins contain the pyridoxal-dependent decarboxylase conserved domain that is common to all group II decarboxylase proteins. Two predicted Anopheles gambiae proteins have the strongest similarity to the predicted Drosophila proteins: predicted A. gambiae protein EAA03914.2 and dTDC2 are 76% identical, whereas predicted A. gambiae protein EAA03915.1 and dTDC1 are 36% similar. Further analysis of the A. gambiae genome revealed that the two genes encoding these predicted proteins are also adjacent and directly repeated, separated by 10.2 kb on chromosome 2L. Given their sequence similarity and clustering in the genome, it is likely that these genes are the mosquito homologs of dTdc1 and -2. Bootstrap analyses of all established TDC proteins and of other decarboxylases with strong similarity to the candidate Drosophila TDCs verify that the A. gambiae EAA003915.1 and EAA003914.2 are likely homologs of dTDC1 and -2 (Supplemental Fig. 1). The only other confirmed TDC in a metazoan animal, C. elegans TDC-1,1 is also closely related to the Drosophila TDCs, as is an unidentified gene product in Caenorhabditis briggsae. The most closely related vertebrate proteins are the human, mouse, guinea pig, and rat AADCs, but interestingly, no additional metazoan TDC-like genes were identified in our analyses. To determine whether the TDCs contain any identifying amino acids, we aligned this same group of decarboxylases and searched for conserved residues. We were able to identify five amino acids that are conserved among the known and suspected TDCs, but generally not among other closely related decarboxylases (Supplemental Fig. 2). Only leucine 328 is absolutely reliable as an identifier of TDCs. Lysine 386 appears to be consistent among plant and animal TDCs, but it is not conserved among the bacterial TDCs, whereas the three other conserved residues predict very closely related AADCs as well. Four out of five of the conserved amino acids are contained within the pyridoxal-dependent decarboxylase conserved domain, but none is within the region known to contain the highly conserved pyridoxal phosphate attachment site at residues 298–319. The final residue is located near the C-terminal end of the protein in a region where similarity between the decarboxylases declines. After identifying these residues, we reanalyzed the available vertebrate genomes to determine whether any TDCs could be identified, but none was found. dTdc2 Is Expressed throughout the CNS and Provides Extensive Innervation to the Female Reproductive Tract, whereas dTdc1 Is Expressed Nonneurally—In Drosophila, as in other animals, each decarboxylase is typically encoded by one gene, although distinct promoters and/or alternative splicing may direct expression of neural and nonneural products, as is the case for the Drosophila DOPA decarboxylase and mammalian AADCs (21Albert V.R. Lee M.R. Bolden A.H. Wurzburger R.J. Aguanno A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12053-12057Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 22Morgan B. Johnson W.A. Hirsh J. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3335-3342Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 23Fitzpatrick P.F. Chlumsky L.J. Daubner S.C. O'Malley K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2042-2047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since there appear to be two TDCs in the Drosophila genome, we examined their expression patterns to determine whether they had unique or overlapping distributions. Using quantitative real time PCR, we analyzed the expression of dTdc1 and -2 in various Drosophila tissues and found that the two genes show a largely nonoverlapping pattern of expression (Fig. 3). dTdc1 is most abundant in the abdomen and in whole flies, but dTdc2 RNA is ∼100-fold enriched in the brain relative to dTdc1. To further examine the expression patterns of dTdc1 and dTdc2, we took advantage of the binary GAL4-UAS system (15Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We developed GAL4 drivers for each gene and examined their in vivo expression patterns by using two different UAS-GFP reporter lines: UAS-CD8-GFP, a marker reported to be highly concentrated in neural processes including axons and dendrites (24Lee T. Luo L. Neuron. 1999; 22: 451-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2006) Google Scholar), and UAS-GFP.nls, which contains a nuclear localization signal. Previous studies have detected octopamine and TBH in distinct clusters of cells throughout the central brain and along the ventral midline of the adult thoracic nerve cord (12Monastirioti M. Dev. Biol. 2003; 264: 38-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 25Monastirioti M. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1999; 45: 106-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), and recent studies indicate that TBH-expressing neurons send projections through the abdominal ganglion to the female reproductive tract, where they innervate the ovaries and oviduct (12Monastirioti M. Dev. Biol. 2003; 264: 38-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Based on these results and our real time PCR evidence, we predicted that dTdc2 would be expressed in a similar pattern as that seen for TBH and octopamine. As expected, the dTdc2-GAL4 driver shows expression in discrete clusters of neurons throughout the adult brain and nerve cord and provides extensive innervation to the female reproductive tract (Fig. 4), but we were not able to detect dTdc2-GAL4 expression in any nonneural peripheral tissues. The dTdc2-GAL4 pattern of expression in the brain and nerve cord is strikingly similar to that seen with TBH immunoreactivity (25Monastirioti M. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1999; 45: 106-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), although some of the TBH neurons reported to be located in the dorsal protocerebrum could not be detected. Furthermore, several clusters of cells not known to contain TBH in the central brain are detected with dTdc2-GAL4 (Fig. 4A, arrows). These cells could either be tyramine-specific neurons or an artifact of the GAL4 driver. As described for TBH (12Monastirioti M. Dev. Biol. 2003; 264: 38-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), dTdc2-GAL4 neurons are located along the ventral midline of the abdominal segment of the thoracic CNS and send axons into the abdominal nerve, where they project over the posterior region of the ovaries and provide heavy innervation to the calyx and to the lateral and common oviducts (Fig. 4, B–D). Interestingly, the Drosophila octopamine receptor OAMB has been detected in the epithelial cell layer of the oviducts (11Lee H.G. Seong C.S. Kim Y.C. Davis R.L. Han K.A. Dev. Biol. 2003; 264: 179-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), but labeling of the epithelium in addition to the musculature shows that the dTdc2 -GAL4 projections are in the same focal plane as the musculature and ∼10μm above the epithelial layer (Fig. 4D). These results provide evidence that dTdc2-containing neurons innervate the lateral and common oviducts and offer further support to the hypothesis that neural tyramine and octopamine are involved in the control of egg laying. In contrast, dTdc1-GAL4 expression was absent from the brain and detected in only two small clusters of neurons in the thoracic nerve cord. As expected, dTdc1 is highly expressed throughout the body, including the gut musculature, rectal papillae, and Malpighian tubules (Fig. 5), but was completely absent from the female reproductive tract (data not shown). Although the presence of tyramine and octopamine in the Drosophila CNS is well established (25Monastirioti M. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1999; 45: 106-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), tyramine was only recently shown to modulate transepithelial chloride conductance in the Drosophila Malpighian tubule (7Blumenthal E.M. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 284: C718-C728Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Since we detect dTdc1 expression and tyramine, but not octopamine, in these nonneural tissues (data not shown), we predict that dTdc1 is responsible for this nonneural tyramine production. A dTdc2 Mutation Causes Female Sterility—Flies containing a null mutation in the Drosophila Tβh gene (TβhnM18) completely lack octopamine and are female sterile due to egg retention (13Monastirioti M.

Eggs are retained in the ovaries of TβhnM18 females as a result of defective ovulation, which is defined as the passage of eggs from any one of the posterior ovarioles to the lateral oviducts (12Monastirioti M. Dev. Biol. 2003; 264: 38-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 13Monastirioti M. Linn C.E. White K. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3900-3911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since TβhnM18 females do not ovulate, it is not known whether they have a coexisting deficit in oviposition, the extrusion of eggs from the uterus. Regardless, one would expect that flies containing a mutation in a Tdc gene that is expressed in cells involved in egg laying would also be female sterile (see Fig. 1). An ethyl methane sulfonate mutagenesis screen for recessive female sterile mutations on the second chromosome revealed one mutant, named RO54 (14Schupbach T. Wieschaus E. Genetics. 1991; 129: 1119-1136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which had a severe egg retention phenotype similar to that seen in TβhnM18 mutants and whose inability to lay eggs could be partially rescued by octopamine and tyramine feeding (Table I). By the following molecular and genetic analysis, we identified the RO54 mutation as a lesion within the dTdc2 gene and have renamed the mutant allele as Tdc2RO54. In contrast to TβhnM18 females, mature eggs or their collapsed remnants were found in the calyx, lateral, or common oviducts in 83% of Tdc2RO54 females, indicating that oocytes are ovulated but cannot be oviposited; by contrast, only one of 18 cn bw control females had an egg in these structures (Supplemental Table I).Table IRescue of Tdc2RO54 mutant female fecundityDrug treatmentReplicates (total no. of females)No. of eggsTdc2RO54/Tdc2RO54No drug4 (16)0Tyrosine (12 mg/ml)4 (15)0Tyrosine (25 mg/ml)3 (13)0Tyramine (12 mg/ml)5 (20)4Tyramine (25 mg/ml)12 (47)77Octopamine (12 mg/ml)5 (15)188Octopamine (25 mg/ml)5 (21)496Tdc2RO54/Df(2R)42No drug4 (16)0Tyrosine (12 mg/ml)3 (15)0Tyrosine (24 mg/ml)3 (14)0Tyramine (12 mg/ml)6 (25)2Tyramine (25 mg/ml)4 (13)0Octopamine (12 mg/ml)4 (16)147Octopamine (25 mg/ml)7 (28)588 Open table in a new tab We mapped the mutation to the general region of dTdc1 and -2 using a series of second chromosome deletions (Fig. 2A), scoring for their ability to complement the sterility phenotype. The phenotype was not complemented by deficiency Df(2R)42, which deletes the cytological region 42C2-42D2-3, but was complemented by the adjacent deficiencies Df(2R)cn87e and Df(2R)nap1 and the inversion In(2R)pk87s. Using this information, we were able to localize the mutation within the Df(2R)42 deficiency but to the left of Df(2R)cn87e, which narrows the mutation to the small region of 42C2–42C3 containing dTdc1 and -2 (Fig. 2B). Since it was possible that the Tdc2RO54 mutation altered mRNA abundance in the affected gene, we used quantitative real time PCR to screen genes in the dTdc1 and -2 region. We did not find altered RNA levels in any of the genes in this immediate region between homozygous Tdc2RO54 and wild-type flies (data not shown). However, sequencing the genomic DNA of dTdc1 and -2 revealed a single point mutation in the third exon of dTdc2 that results in a glutamic acid to lysine substitution at amino acid 51, within the highly conserved pyridoxal-dependent decarboxylase conserved domain (Fig. 2C). An alignment of the predicted dTDC2 amino acid sequence with the 10 most similar decarboxylases shows that each of the aligned proteins contains either a glutamic acid or aspartic acid at the location of the Tdc2RO54 mutation (Fig. 6A).

TRPV1 exhibits desensitization in a Ca2+-dependent manner upon repeated activation by capsaicin or protons. The cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) decreases desensitization of TRPV1 by directly phosphorylating the channel presumably at sites Ser116 and Thr370. In the present study we investigated the influence of protein phosphatase 2B (calcineurin) on Ca2+-dependent desensitization of capsaicin- and proton-activated currents. By using site-directed mutagenesis, we generated point mutations at PKA and protein kinase C consensus sites and studied wild type (WT) and mutant channels transiently expressed in HEK293t or HeLa cells under whole cell voltage clamp. We found that intracellular application of the cyclosporin A·cyclophilin A complex (CsA·CyP), a specific inhibitor of calcineurin, significantly decreased desensitization of capsaicin- or proton-activated TRPV1-WT currents. This effect was similar to that obtained by extracellular application of forskolin (FSK), an indirect activator of PKA. Simultaneous applications of CsA·CyP and FSK in varying concentrations suggested that these substances acted independently from each other. In mutation T370A, application of CsA·CyP did not reduce desensitization of capsaicin-activated currents as compared with WT and to mutant channels S116A and T144A. In a double mutation at candidate protein kinase C phosphorylation sites, application of CsA·CyP or FSK decreased desensitization of capsaicin-activated currents similar to WT channels. We conclude that Ca2+-dependent desensitization of TRPV1 might be in part regulated through channel dephosphorylation by calcineurin and channel phosphorylation by PKA possibly involving Thr370 as a key amino acid residue.

Blumberg P.M. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 159-212PubMed Google Scholar). Prolonged or repeated activation of TRPV1 results in desensitization and insensitivity of the receptor to subsequent stimuli (10.Koplas P.A. Rosenberg R.L. Oxford G.S. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3525-3537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Mohapatra D.P. Wang S.Y. Wang G.K. Nau C. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2003; 23: 314-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The physiological role and importance of TRPV1 desensitization is unknown but speculated to be a process of adaptation and regulation of the peripheral nervous system for the perception of pain. Comparable with other ion channels, desensitization of TRPV1 is at least in part a Ca2+-dependent process (10.Koplas P.A. Rosenberg R.L. Oxford G.S. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3525-3537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Mohapatra D.P. Wang S.Y. Wang G.K. Nau C. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2003; 23: 314-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). There is growing evidence for the involvement of Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation and dephosphorylation processes to regulate desensitization and excitability of TRPV1. Previous studies in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons have demonstrated that desensitization is reduced in the presence of inhibitors of the Ca2+- and calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase 2B (calcineurin) (12.Docherty R.J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 7048-7054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar).Another candidate involved in the mechanisms of Ca2+ negative feedback and Ca2+-dependent inactivation in many ion channels is the Ca2+ sensor calmodulin (CaM) itself. There is growing evidence that multiple regions of TRPV1 indeed may bind CaM (14.Numazaki M. Tominaga T. Takeuchi K. Murayama N. Toyooka H. Tominaga M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Phosphorylation by PKA sensitizes the channel to heat (16.Rathee P.K. Distler C. Obreja O. Neuhuber W. Wang G.K. Wang S.Y. Nau C. Kress M. J.

Amino acids residues Ser116 and Thr370 are the major substrates for PKA-dependent phosphorylation, although other putative PKA phosphorylation sites might be involved as well. Phosphorylation by PKC sensitizes the channel to capsaicin, protons, and heat (20.Premkumar L.S. Ahern G.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 985-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 21.Vellani V.

Here, residues Ser502 and Ser800 are the major substrates for PKC-dependent phosphorylation.In the present study we investigated the influence of calcineurin on Ca2+-dependent desensitization of capsaicin- and proton-activated currents and examined the interactions of calcineurin and PKA and PKC phosphorylation pathways. We found that Ca2+-dependent desensitization of TRPV1 might be in part regulated through channel dephosphorylation by calcineurin and channel phosphorylation by PKA possibly involving Thr370 as a key amino acid residue.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSite-directed Mutagenesis and Transient Transfection—Mutagenesis of rat TRPV1-cDNA was performed with rTRPV1-pcDNA3 by means of the transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) as described previously (19.Mohapatra D.P. Nau C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50080-50090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293t cells or cells of a human adenocarcinoma-derived cell line (HeLa cells) were transfected with wild type or mutant plasmid (0.75 or 10 μg, respectively) along with reporter plasmid (CD8-pih3m, 1 μg) by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. After incubation for 12–15 h, the cells were replated in 35-mm culture dishes. Transfected cells were used for experiments within 2–3 days. Transfection-positive cells were identified by immunobeads (anti-CD-8 Dynabeads; Dynal Biotech, Oslo, Norway). Transfection efficiency was ∼50–70% on average for TRPV1-WT and mutant channels.Chemicals and Solutions—Capsaicin (8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide) and cyclosporin A (CsA; both Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in absolute ethanol to give stock solutions of 10 mm. Forskolin (FSK; Calbiochem-Novabiochem GmbH, Bad Soden, Germany), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; Calbiochem-Novabiochem GmbH), and okadaic acid (OA; Alomone Labs, Ltd., Jerusalem, Israel) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide to give stock solutions of 10, 1, and 1 mm, respectively. Human brain CaM and N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide hydrochloride (W-7; both Calbiochem-Novabiochem GmbH) were dissolved in double distilled water to give stock solutions of 100 mm. Cyclophilin A (CyP; Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, containing HEPES, 1,4-dithio-dl-threitol, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and sodium azide to give a stock solution of 20 μm. All of the stock solutions were stored at –20 °C. All of the control and test solutions were applied with a polytetrafluorethylen glass multiple-barrel perfusion system. Standard bath solutions contained 70 mm NaCl, 70 mm choline Cl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm glucose (adjusted to pH 7.4 with tetramethylammonium hydroxide). The NaCl/Choline Cl composition was used to reduce the amplitude of the WT currents. Choline Cl did not have any influence on WT or mutant channels. Pipette solution contained 140 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES (adjusted to pH 7.4 with KOH).Electrophysiological Technique and Data Analysis—Currents were recorded at room temperature with the whole cell configuration of the patch-clamp method. Holding potential was –60 mV. Patch pipettes were pulled from boroslilicate glass tubes (TW150F-3; World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) and heat-polished at the tip to give a resistance of 0.8-1.2 mΩ. The currents were recorded with an Axopatch 200B patch-clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA), filtered at 1 kHz, and sampled at 2 kHz. pCLAMP 8.0.1 software (Axon Instruments) was used for acquisition and analysis of currents. Origin 6.1 software (OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA) was used to perform least squares fitting and to create figures. The data are presented as the means ± S.E. or fitted value ± S.E. of the fit. An unpaired Student's t test (SigmaStat; SSPS Science, Chicago, IL) was used to evaluate the significance of changes in mean values. p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.RESULTSInhibition of Calcineurin Decreases Ca2+-dependent Desensitization of Capsaicin-activated TRPV1-WT Currents—TRPV1 channel exhibits desensitization in a Ca2+-dependent manner (10.Koplas P.A. Rosenberg R.L. Oxford G.S. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3525-3537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Mohapatra D.P. Wang S.Y. Wang G.K. Nau C. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2003; 23: 314-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that a rise in cytosolic Ca2+ level caused by TRPV1 activation results in the activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatases that mediate channel desensitization (12.Docherty R.J. Yeats J.C. Bevan S. Boddeke H.W. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 431: 828-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis for TRPV1-WT transiently expressed in HEK293t cells, we first studied the effect of various protein phosphatase inhibitors on Ca2+-dependent desensitization of capsaicin-activated TRPV1-WT currents, specifically on the decreasing current response to successive stimulation (tachyphylaxis). We applied a series of brief (∼5 s long) pulses of 1 μm capsaicin at 2-min intervals in Ca2+-containing solution (2 mm) and measured the current response. Under control conditions, TRPV1-WT showed strong tachyphylaxis (Fig. 1A). Most of the tachyphylaxis occurred between the first and second application, as described previously (19.Mohapatra D.P. Nau C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50080-50090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The mean current amplitudes at the second and fourth capsaicin application were 5.1 ± 2.7 and 3.1 ± 0.4% of that of the first application, respectively (Fig. 1F). Pretreatment of cells for 10 min with 1 μm OA in the pipette solution, an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 and 2A, did not lead to any change in Ca2+-dependent tachyphylaxis of capsaicin-activated currents (Fig. 1B). Here, current amplitudes at the second and fourth capsaicin application were 2.5 ± 1.6 and 3.7 ± 2.4% of that of the first application, respectively (Fig. 1F). Similarly, OA was without any effect on Ca2+-dependent tachyphylaxis when used in both lower or higher concentrations (0.01–100 μm, data not shown). In contrast, tachyphylaxis was significantly decreased when cells were pretreated for 10 min with the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A (CsA; 14 nm) together with the “immunophilin” cyclophilin A (CyP; 17 nm) in the pipette solution (Fig. 1D). CsA and CyP are known to form a drug/immunophilin complex, which associates with and thus inhibits protein phosphatase 2B (calcineurin) (23.Jin L. Harrison S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13522-13526Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In the presence of CsA/Cyp, current amplitudes at the second and fourth capsaicin application were 58.4 ± 6.9 and 37.2 ± 6.2% of that at the first application, respectively (Fig. 1F). This is in good agreement with previously reported results obtained in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons using similar concentration of CsA and CyP in the pipette solution (12.Docherty R.J. Yeats J.C. Bevan S. Boddeke H.W. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 431: 828-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Higher concentrations of CsA (up to 1 μm) along with CyP (up to 1 μm) did not lead to any further decrease in tachyphylaxis compared with that observed with 14 nm CsA plus 17 nm CyP (data not shown). Pretreatment of cells with CsA alone up to concentrations of 100 μm in the pipette solution did not lead to any change in Ca2+-dependent tachyphylaxis of capsaicin-activated currents compared with control conditions, indicating that indeed CsA complexed to CyP is the active form that specifically targets calcineurin (Fig. 1, C and F). Pretreatment of cells for 10 min with 14 nm CsA and 17 nm CyP along with 1 μm OA in the pipette solution did not lead to any further decrease in tachyphylaxis compared with that observed with CsA·CyP (Fig. 1, E and F). Pretreatment of cells with OA, CsA, or CsA·CyP in the pipette solutions did not have any significant effect on capsaicin-activated peak currents of TRPV1-WT (Table I).Table IMean amplitudes of currents (means ± S.E.) evoked by the first capsaicin/proton application in n experiments under various experimental conditionsChannelActivatorExperimental conditionResponsenpnATRPV1-WTCapsaicin6.5 ± 1.66TRPV1-WTCapsaicin100 μm OA in pipette9.3 ± 2.66TRPV1-WTCapsaicin100 μm CsA in pipette6.8 ± 1.26TRPV1-WTCapsaicin14 nm CsA, 17 nm CyP in pipette4.8 ± 1.27TRPV1-WTCapsaicin100 μm OA plus 14 nm CsA, 17 nm CyP in pipette4.3 ± 1.26TRPV1-WTCapsaicin (30 s)7.8 ± 1.86TRPV1-WTCapsaicin (30 s)14 nm CsA, 17 nm CyP in pipette5.0 ± 1.17TRPV1-WTCapsaicin100 μm W-7 in pipette7.8 ± 1.78TRPV1-WTCapsaicin100 μm CaM in pipette8.6 ± 2.06TRPV1-WTCapsaicin10 μm FSK in extracellular buffer5.2 ± 0.99TRPV1-S116ACapsaicin8.9 ± 2.37TRPV1-S116ACapsaicin14 nm CsA, 17 nm CyP in pipette6.1 ± 1.27TRPV1-T370ACapsaicin2.3 ± 0.66<0.05TRPV1-T370ACapsaicin14 nm CsA, 17 nm CyP in pipette3.2 ± 0.86TRPV1-T144ACapsaicin2.8 ± 0.66TRPV1-T144ACapsaicin14 nm CsA, 17 nm CyP in pipette3.9 ± 1.06TRPV1-WTCapsaicin0.1 μm PMA in extracellular buffer5.3 ± 2.36TRPV1-S502A/S800ACapsaicin6.2 ± 2.36TRPV1-S502A/S800ACapsaicin14 nm CsA, 17 nm CyP in pipette4.6 ± 1.28TRPV1-WTProton3.1 ± 0.66TRPV1-WTProton14 nm CsA, 17 nm CyP in pipette4.2 ± 0.76TRPV1-WTProton (30s)6.4 ± 1.56TRPV1-WTProton (30s)14 nm CsA, 17 nm CyP in pipette4.0 ± 0.86 Open table in a new tab We also investigated responses of TRPV1-WT channels to prolonged applications (30-s) of 1 μm capsaicin in Ca2+-containing (2 mm) bath solution. TRPV1-WT currents had peak amplitudes in the range of 2.6–14.4 nA with a mean of 7.1 ± 1.8 nA. Currents reached their peak at 1.6 ± 0.5 s after beginning of activation. The currents then began to decrease rapidly during continuous capsaicin application and reached values of 0.41 ± 0.18, 0.34 ± 0.06, and 0.21 ± 0.03 nA after 10, 20, and 30 s, respectively (Fig. 2A). This type of desensitization has been termed acute desensitization, consistent with previous reports (10.Koplas P.A. Rosenberg R.L. Oxford G.S. J.

The currents had peak amplitudes in the range of 2.4-8.9 nA with a mean of 5.0 ± 1.1 nA, which was not significantly different from control conditions (Table I). The currents reached their peak at 1.9 ± 0.7 s after beginning of activation. Then the currents began to decrease during continuous capsaicin application and reached values of 2.18 ± 0.62, 0.64 ± 0.08, and 0.59 ± 0.05 nA after 10, 20, and 30 s, respectively (Fig. 2B). To describe and compare acute desensitization quantitatively for control conditions and in the presence of CsA·CyP, we measured the areas under the current curves over a time of 30 s and normalized them to an idealized (rectangular), nondesensitizing current of a respective size. The data are given in Fig. 2C.Calmodulin Is Not Required for the Decrease in Ca2+-dependent Desensitization by Inhibition of Calcineurin—Calcineurin exerts its phosphatase activity in a Ca2+- and calmodulin-dependent manner. CaM itself is a dominant Ca2+ sensor for Ca2+-dependent inactivation in many ion channels (24.Lee A. Wong S.T. Gallagher D. Li B. Storm D.R. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A.

There is accumulating evidence that multiple regions of TRPV1 may bind CaM. One putative region was identified in the C-terminal (14.Numazaki M. Tominaga T. Takeuchi K. Murayama N. Toyooka H. Tominaga M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8002-8006Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), and another was identified in the N-terminal segment (15.Rosenbaum T. Gordon-Shaag A. Munari M. Gordon S.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 123: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). We investigated the functional role of CaM in Ca2+-dependent desensitization of capsaicin-activated TRPV1-WT channels. The experiments were performed as described for those shown in Fig. 1. Pretreatment of cells with 100 μm W-7 in the pipette solution, which is a potent noncompetitive antagonist of calmodulin, did not lead to any change in Ca2+-dependent tachyphylaxis of capsaicin-activated TRPV1-WT currents (Fig. 3, A and C). W-7 also did not have any significant effect on capsaicin-activated peak currents of TRPV1-WT (Table I). This is in good agreement with an earlier report about the ineffectiveness of W-7 on TRPV1 channel desensitization (14.Numazaki M. Tominaga T. Takeuchi K. Murayama N. Toyooka H. Tominaga M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8002-8006Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Tachyphylaxis was significantly decreased when cells were pretreated with 100 μm W-7 along with 14 nm CsA plus 17 nm CyP in the pipette solution (Fig. 3B). Here, current amplitudes at the second and fourth capsaicin application were 71.7 ± 12.0 and 42.2 ± 8.1% of that of the first application, respectively (Fig. 3C). The decrease in channel tachyphylaxis was comparable with that observed in the presence of CsA plus CyP in the pipette solution (Figs. 1F and 3C). This indicates that inhibition of calcineurin alone is sufficient to inhibit TRPV1-WT channel desensitization. CaM alone up to concentrations of 100 μm in the pipette solution did not lead to any change in tachyphylaxis of capsaicin-activated TRPV1-WT currents compared with control conditions (Fig. 3, D and F). Pretreatment of cells with CaM up to concentrations of 100 μm along with 14 nm CsA and 17 nm CyP in the pipette solution led to a significant decrease in tachyphylaxis of capsaicin-activated TRPV1-WT currents (Fig. 3E). Here, the results were quantitatively similar to those obtained with CsA·CyP alone or CsA·CyP along with W-7 in the pipette solution (Figs. 1F and 3, C and F).Fig. 3Effect W-7, a calmodulin antagonist, and CaM on Ca2+-dependent desensitization of capsaicin-activated TRPV1 currents.

Because inhibition of calcineurin decreases desensitization of capsaicin-activated TRPV1 currents to a similar extent like activation of PKA, we investigated the interplay between PKA activation and calcineurin inhibition and their effect on Ca2+-dependent desensitization of capsaicin-activated TRPV1 currents. As demonstrated previously, pretreatment of cells for 10 min with 10 μm FSK, an activator of adenylate cyclase and thus an indirect PKA activator, led to a significant decrease in channel tachyphylaxis (Fig. 4A) (19.Mohapatra D.P. Nau C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50080-50090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Current amplitudes at the second and fourth capsaicin application were 62.7 ± 7.8 and 42.8 ± 9.8% of that at the first application, respectively (Fig. 4C). FSK pretreatment did not have any significant effect on capsaicin-activated peak currents in TRPV1-WT (Table I). Pretreatment of cells for 10 min with 14 nm CsA plus 17 nm CyP in the pipette solution along with 10 μm FSK in the external solution did not lead to any significant further decrease in tachyphylaxis compared with that in the presence of 10 μm FSK alone (Fig. 4, B and C). To exclude the possibility that the decrease in desensitization in the presence of CsA·CyP is caused by PKA phosphorylation caused by disinhibition of PKA by CsA·CyP, we investigated the effect of CsA·CyP on channel tachyphylaxis in the presence of the PKA inhibitor KT5720.

https://openalex.org/W2012173388,"Differences in the thickness of the high-velocity lid underlying continents as imaged by seismic tomography, have fuelled a long debate on the origin of the ‘roots’ of continents1,2,3,4,5. Some of these differences may be reconciled by observations of radial anisotropy between 250 and 300 km depth, with horizontally polarized shear waves travelling faster than vertically polarized ones2. This azimuthally averaged anisotropy could arise from present-day deformation at the base of the plate, as has been found for shallower depths beneath ocean basins6. Such deformation would also produce significant azimuthal variation, owing to the preferred alignment of highly anisotropic minerals7. Here we report global observations of surface-wave azimuthal anisotropy, which indicate that only the continental portion of the Australian plate displays significant azimuthal anisotropy and strong correlation with present-day plate motion in the depth range 175–300 km. Beneath other continents, azimuthal anisotropy is only weakly correlated with plate motion and its depth location is similar to that found beneath oceans. We infer that the fast-moving Australian plate contains the only continental region with a sufficiently large deformation at its base to be transformed into azimuthal anisotropy. Simple shear leading to anisotropy with a plunging axis of symmetry may explain the smaller azimuthal anisotropy beneath other continents."
https://openalex.org/W2070997089,"Metacaspases in plants, fungi, and protozoa constitute new members of a conserved superfamily of caspase-related proteases. A yeast caspase-1 protein (Yca1p), which is the single metacaspase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was shown to mediate apoptosis triggered by oxidative stress or aging in yeast. To examine whether plant metacaspase genes are functionally related to YCA1, we carried out analyses of AtMCP1b and AtMCP2b, representing the two subtypes of the Arabidopsis metacaspase family, utilizing yeast strains with wild-type and the disrupted YCA1 gene (yca1Δ). Inducible expression of AtMCP1b and AtMCP2b significantly promoted yeast apoptosis-like cell death of both the wild-type and yca1Δ strains, relative to the vector controls, during oxidative stress and early aging process. Mutational analysis of the two AtMCPs revealed that their cell-death-inducing activities depend on their catalytic center cysteine residues as well as caspase-like processing. In addition, the phenotype induced by the expression of two AtMCPs was effectively prevented when the cells were pretreated with a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl-ketone. These results suggest that the two subtypes of Arabidopsis metacaspases are functionally related to Yca1p with caspase-like characteristics. However, we found that bacterial and yeast extracts containing AtMCP1b, AtMCP2b, or Yca1p exhibit arginine/lysine-specific endopeptidase activities but cannot cleave caspase-specific substrates. Together, the results strongly implicate that expression of metacaspases could result in the activation of downstream protease(s) with caspase-like activities that are required to mediate cell death activation via oxidative stress in yeast.

Activation of caspases (cysteine-containing aspartate-specific proteases) represents a central core execution switch for apoptosis in animal cells (reviewed in Refs. 3Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M.

Similarly, accumulating evidence in recent years suggest the involvement of caspase-like proteases during the activation of various types of PCD in plants (reviewed in Refs. 6Lam E. del Pozo O.

At present, no caspase gene has been identified in the available plant genome sequences, including Arabidopsis and rice, but recent studies have revealed the presence of a family of genes encoding proteins with distant homology to mammalian caspases, designated metacaspases, in plants, fungi, and protozoa (10Uren A.G.

In the Arabidopsis thaliana genome, there are nine predicted metacaspase genes: three of these A. thaliana genes belong to the type-I class (AtMCP1a-1c), containing predicted N-terminal prodomain consisted of a zinc finger motif followed by a proline-rich region (AtMCP1b and AtMCP1c) or by a glutamine- and proline-rich region (AtMCP1a) and a C-terminal caspase-like domain, whereas the other six type II metacaspases (AtMCP2a-2f) possess no obvious prodomain (10Uren A.G.

Plant Pathol. 2004; 5: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Our Northern blot analysis revealed that transcripts of all type-I metacaspases (AtMCP1a-1c) and two type II metacaspases (AtMCP2b and AtMCP2d) are rapidly up-regulated at a similar fashion upon infection of leaves with bacterial pathogens, suggesting their possible involvement in the activation of cell death. 2N. Watanabe and E. Lam, unpublished results. Similarly, the up-regulation of LeMCA1, a type II metacaspase, was found in necrotrophic pathogen-infected tomato leaves, suggesting the link of this class of metacaspase to the induction of plant cell death (12Hoeberichts F.A. ten Have A. Woltering E.J. Planta. 2003; 217: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). A type II metacaspase gene, mcII-Pa, in Norway spruce, was very recently shown to be involved in somatic embryogenesis, which is one model system of developmental PCD in plants (13Suarez M.F. Filonova L.H. Smertenko A. Savenkov E.I. Clapham D.H. von Arnold S. Zhivotovsky B. Bozhkov P.V. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R339-R340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). This metacaspase gene may encode a functional homologue of animal caspase-6 (VEIDase), because silencing of this gene resulted in a significant reduction of VEIDase activity strongly associated with the initial execution phase for this developmental PCD (13Suarez M.F. Filonova L.H. Smertenko A. Savenkov E.I. Clapham D.H. von Arnold S. Zhivotovsky B. Bozhkov P.V. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R339-R340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). However, direct biochemical evidence for the activity of the mcII-Pa encoded protein is lacking. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has emerged as a useful system for PCD or apoptosis studies, because it is readily amenable to genetic and molecular analysis (14Jin C. Reed J.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 15Madeo F. Engelhardt S. Herker E. Lehmann N. Maldener C. Proksch A. Wissing S. Fröhlich K-U. Curr. Genet. 2002; 41: 208-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Indeed, apoptosis-like cell death of yeast occurs in certain cdc48 mutant (16Madeo F. Fröhlich E. Fröhlich K-U. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar) or upon treatment with low doses of hydrogen peroxide (17Madeo F. Fröhlich E. Ligr M. Grey M. Sigrist S.J. Wolf D.H. Fröhlich K-U. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). In addition, ectopic overexpression of proapoptotic factors such as Bax induces yeast apoptosis; the effect can be counteracted by the simultaneous overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-XL (18Gross A. Pilcher K. Blachly-Dyson E. Basso E. Jockel J. Bassik M.C. Korsmeyer S. Forte M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3125-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), suggesting a striking parallelism with apoptosis in metazoans. The single metacaspase gene in S. cerevisiae, termed yeast caspase-1 (YCA1), was shown to mediate oxidative stress-induced and age-related apoptosis in yeast (19Madeo F. Herker E. Maldener C. Wissing S. Lächelt S. Herlan M. Fehr M. Lauber K. Sigrist S.J. Wesselborg S. Fröhlich K-U. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 911-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Overexpression of YCA1 stimulates apoptotic cell death, whereas disruption of this gene prevents it, indicating that this metacaspase is required for apoptosis-like cell death in yeast. Interestingly, the wild-type Yca1p but not one with a point mutation at the catalytic center Cys297 residue was shown to be proteolytically activated upon oxidative stress, which correlated with the appearance of new caspase-like activities that have similar substrate specificity with initiator caspases (caspase-6 and caspase-8). However, conclusive evidence demonstrating that Yca1p indeed exhibits caspase-like activity using purified or recombinant enzymes is still lacking. On the other hand, in Trypanosoma brucei metacaspase gene family is consisted of five different genes (TbMCA1–5) (20Szallies A. Kubata B.K. Duszenko M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Of these, heterologous expression of TbMCA4 in the budding yeast led to growth inhibition, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cell death, suggesting that this metacaspase may have a role in controlling cellular proliferation coupled to mitochondrial function. Further, mutation studies of TbMCA4 suggested that this metacaspase could function as a cysteine protease, whereas enzymatic properties of TbMCA4, such as its substrate specificity, remain unknown (20Szallies A. Kubata B.K. Duszenko M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In this work, we addressed the question of whether members of the two subtypes of Arabidopsis metacaspase gene family are functionally related to YCA1, which is a well characterized metacaspase gene (19Madeo F. Herker E. Maldener C. Wissing S. Lächelt S. Herlan M. Fehr M. Lauber K. Sigrist S.J. Wesselborg S. Fröhlich K-U. Mol.

Using the wild-type and yca1Δ yeast strains, we performed a detailed analysis of the activities of AtMCP1b, AtMCP2b, and Yca1p during oxidative stress-stimulated and age-related apoptosis in yeast. Furthermore, we performed an initial biochemical characterization of these metacaspases produced in yeast and bacteria, to compare their enzymatic properties, including substrate preference. Yeast Strains, Plasmids, and Transformation—Two yeast strains BY4741 (KFY715) (MATa; his3Δ1; leu2Δ0; met15Δ0; ura3Δ0; from EUROSCARF) and yca1 disruptant (yca1::kanMX4) in the BY4741 background (KFY729), and two YCA1 clones pFM21 (YCA1 with C-terminal FLAG tag in pESC-His) and pFM22 (yca1C297A with C-terminal FLAG tag in pESC-His) were kindly provided by Frank Madeo (University of Tübingen, Germany). The two yeast strains were used as hosts for transformation. For generation of C-terminally V5-epitope and hexahistidine-tagged AtMCP1b, AtMCP2b, and YCA1, 199N11 (expressed sequence tag clone of AtMCP1b; accession no. H76651), 147M2 (expressed sequence tag clone of AtMCP2b; accession no. T76127), and pFM21 (YCA1 construct) were used as template. The coding sequence of AtMCP1b, AtMCP2b, and YCA1 was amplified by PCR using the following three sets of primers: EL1708 (5′-GGATCCACGATGTACCCGCCACCTCCCTCAA-3′) and EL1709 (5′-GAGAGTGAAAGGCTTTGCATAGAC-3′), EL1725 (5′-GGATCCACGATGGCGAAGAAAGCTGTG-3′) and EL1726 (5′-ACAAATAAACGGAGCATTCAC-3′), EL1731 (5′-GGATCCACGATGAAGATGAGCCTCGAAG-3′) and EL1732 (5′-CATAATAAATTGCAGATTTACGTC-3′), respectively. These PCR products were directly cloned into a yeast expression vector pYES2.1/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen) in-frame with V5-epitope and hexahistidine-coding sequence, giving plasmids pNW145 (AtMCP1b-V5-His), pNW149 (AtMCP2b-V5-His), and pNW151 (YCA1-V5-His). For generation of point mutants (AtMCP1bC220A and AtMCP2bC139A), site-directed mutagenesis was performed with pNW145 and pNW149 using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the following two sets of mutagenesis primers: EL1716 (5′-CAATCATCGATGCTGCCCATAGTGGTAC-3′) and EL1717 (5′-GTACCACTATGGGCAGCATCGATGATTG-3′), EL1718 (5′-ATCTCAGACTCTGCTCACAGTGGTGGTC-3′) and EL1719 (5′-ACCACCACTGTGAGCAGAGTCTGAGATG-3′) (where changed codons are underlined), giving plasmids pNW145m (AtMCP1bC220A-V5-His) and pNW149m (AtMCP2bC139A-V5-His), respectively. For generation of yca1C297A-V5-His construct, yca1C297A fragment was amplified by PCR using one set of primer pair (EL1731 and EL1732) and pFM22 (as template), and cloned into pYES2.1/V5-His-TOPO vector in-frame with V5-epitope and hexahistidine-coding sequence, giving plasmids pNW152 (yca1C297A-V5-His). All clones were identified by restriction digestion and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The pYES2.1/V5-His metacaspase vectors and the corresponding vector control without any foreign gene were introduced into both the wild-type (KFY715) and yca1Δ (KFY729) strains with an S.C. EasyComp transformation kit (Invitrogen) and selected on agar plates containing synthetic complete medium lacking uracil, consisting of 0.67% yeast nitrogen base with ammonium sulfate (Invitrogen) and 30 mg/liter of all amino acid (except 80 mg/liter histidine and 400 mg/liter leucine), 30 mg/liter adenine with 2% glucose as carbon source (SC glucose media). Growth Conditions and Induction of Expression—Yeast cells were grown at 28 °C and liquid cultures were agitated at 260 rpm. For each experiment, strains were streaked out freshly on an SC glucose plate from a stock stored at –80 °C and incubated for 2 days at 28 °C. Yeast culture harboring expression vectors were grown overnight in 3 ml of noninducing selective media (SC glucose), diluted in 10 ml of fresh SC glucose media (adjusted an OD of 0.05), and then cultured until reaching an OD of 0.4–0.6. The cells collected by brief centrifugation were resuspended in inducing selective medium (SC containing the same contents but 2% galactose instead of glucose). For stimulation of yeast apoptosis, H2O2 was added to a final concentration of 0.4 mm (for all strains in wild-type background) or 1.2 mm (for all strains in yca1Δ background). For inhibition of caspase-like activities in yeast cells, zVAD(OMe)-fmk (Calbiochem) from 20 mm stock in 1:1 Me2SO/ethanol was added to a final concentration of 20 μm. All strains were cultured for up to 96 h after the galactose shift and harvested at specified intervals. Cell Viability Assays—After culturing in SC galactose medium for various times (0–96 h), an aliquot of cells was removed for trypan blue dye exclusion assay, counting ∼700 total (live and dead) cells as described previously (22Xu Q.

Dead cells have lost plasma membrane integrity and as a result cannot exclude dyes and thus are stained. The ability of cells to exclude trypan blue indicates that they are still alive (22Xu Q. Jürgensmeier J.M. Reed J.C. Methods. 1999; 17: 292-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Alternatively, survival of the cell was determined by counting unstained cells, and 103 cells were spread on YEPD plates as described (19Madeo F. Herker E. Maldener C. Wissing S. Lächelt S.

All experiments were repeated at least in triplicate. Test for Apoptotic Marker and Microscopy—TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) test were performed as described previously (17Madeo F.

To determine the frequency of morphological phenotypes (TUNEL), at least 300 cells of three independent experiments were evaluated. For DAPI (4′,6-diaminido-2-phenylidole) staining, stationary phase cells were harvested, resuspended in phosphate saline buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, 140 mm NaCl, pH 7.4), stained with DAPI at the concentration of 1 μg/ml for 5 min at room temperature, and rinsed 5 times with distilled water. A DeltaVision restoration microscope system (Applied Precision) equipped with a TE200 microscope (Nikon) was used to observe DAPI-stained nuclei in stationary phase cells. The images of nuclei were analyzed by softWoRx software (Applied Precision) on an Octane Work station (Silicon Graphics). For determination of reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in the cell, an aliquot of cells were stained with dihydrorhodamine (DHR) (Sigma-Aldrich) at the concentration of 5 μg/ml for 2 h at room temperature or dihydroethidium (DHE) at the concentration 5 μg/ml for 10 min (17Madeo F.

DHR and DHE fluorescence were observed under an inverted fluorescent microscope (model TE300, Nikon Inc.), equipped with an EYFP filter set (excitation 510/20 nm, emission 560/40 nm, beamsplitter 530 nm; Chroma Technology Corp.) and a DsRed filter set (excitation 546/11 nm, emission 605/75 nm, beamsplitter 560 nm; Chroma Technology Corp.), respectively, and the images were taken with a charge-coupled device camera (Optronics Inc.). All images were finally processed by Adobe Photoshop 5.5 (Adobe Systems) on a PowerMac G4 computer (Apple Inc.) for the final display. Immunoblotting—Yeast cells were lysed mechanically as described (19Madeo F. Herker E. Maldener C. Wissing S. Lächelt S. Herlan M. Fehr M. Lauber K. Sigrist S.J. Wesselborg S. Fröhlich K-U. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 911-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Bacterial cells were lysed by sonication as described under “Enzyme Assay.” Protein concentration was determined with a Protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Proteins (10–20 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE (15%, v/v). Separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (0.45 μm, Immobilon-P, Millipore) with a semidry blotter (Bio-Rad). Nonspecific binding was blocked with 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich) in TBST buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 0.1% (w/v) Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoreactive polypeptides were detected using anti-V5 epitope mAb (1:5000 dilution, Invitrogen) or anti-T7 epitope mAb (1:4000 dilution, Novagen) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). The chemiluminescence was finally detected with a photographic film (Kodak). Enzyme Assay—To assay for metacaspase activity in crude cell extracts of galactose-induced yeast cultures (15–50 ml), the cells were suspended in lysis buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1% (w/v) CHAPS, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin). Following cell lysis by vortexing with glass beads, the cell lysates were centrifuged (20,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) and the resulting supernatant was subjected to measurement of in vitro metacaspase activity (see below). To assay enzyme activity of recombinant AtMCP1b, AtMCP2b, and Yca1p produced in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) strain (Invitrogen), the coding region of each gene, amplified by PCR, was cloned in-frame in the bacterial expression vector pET23a (Novagen), resulting in double fusion proteins (N-terminal fusion with a T7 tag and C-terminal fusion with His6). The recombinant metacaspases were induced by adding 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to cell culture with an A600 of 0.4–0.6. Then, the cell culture was shaken (260 rpm) at 28 °C for 1 h (for AtMCP2b) or 3 h (for AtMCP1b and Yca1p). Cells were harvested, washed with distilled water, and resuspended in extraction buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% (w/v) CHAPS, and 10% (w/v) glycerol, 5 μg/ml aprotinin). Cells were broken by brief sonication, and insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation (20,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C). The resulting supernatants were used as active lysates for direct measurement of metacaspase activity in vitro. Alternatively, recombinant AtMCP2b proteins were purified. The soluble extracts from the recombinant AtMCP2b-expressing strain, supplemented with 20 mm imidazole, was mixed with Ni2+ chelating Sepharose FF (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm imidazole in extraction buffer and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C. After washing with extraction buffer supplemented with 50 mm imidazole, bound metacaspases were eluted with 250 mm imidazole in extraction buffer. The purified samples were further passed through an NAP-10 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with sample buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS, and 10% (w/v) glycerol). Metacaspase activity was measured by fluorometric detection of hydrolysis of peptidyl substrates (Z-Arg-2NA, Z-Arg-Arg-2NA, Z-Ala-Arg-Arg-2NA, Z-Gly-Gly-Arg-2NA, Z-Val-Lys-Lys-Arg-2NA, and Boc-Val-Leu-Lys-MCA, Sigma-Aldrich, or Boc-Gly-Arg-Arg-MCA, Bachem Bioscience Inc.) in crude cell extracts or purified recombinant proteins. The enzyme reaction was performed in a reaction buffer (100 μl) containing 25 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS, 5–10 μg of total proteins (crude cell lysate) or 0.1 μg of purified recombinant protein, and 100 μm peptidyl substrate. After incubation of 30–60 min at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of stop solution (10% acetic acid in 150 mm sodium acetate), and an aliquot of sample (50 μl) was diluted in 2 ml of distilled water. Then, the amount of AMC or 2NA liberated during reaction was measured fluorometrically (excitation of 380 nm and emission of 440 nm for AMC, and excitation of 335 nm and emission of 410 nm for 2NA) with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (F-4500, Hitachi). Inhibitory effects of protease inhibitors were assayed under the same reaction conditions, using concentrations as indicated. AtMCP1b and AtMCP2b Can Be Efficiently Expressed in Yeast—To facilitate a comparative analysis of two subtypes of Arabidopsis metacaspases (AtMCP1b and AtMCP2b) and Yca1p, a plasmid encoding each gene C-terminally tagged with a V5 epitope and hexahistidine sequence under the GAL1 promoter control was created. The inducible expression of each metacaspases was verified by immunoblotting using anti-V5 epitope antibody. When all metacaspases were individually expressed in the yca1Δ mutant, a dominant band of about 47 kDa (AtMCP1b), 53 kDa (AtMCP2b), and 54 kDa (Yca1p), which likely correspond to the predicted molecular mass of each metacaspase tagged with a V5 epitope and hexahistidine (44.9, 46.7, and 52.4 kDa, respectively) were detected at 6 h after the galactose shift (Fig. 1A). In contrast, no band was detected in the control strain. In the strains expressing AtMCP2b or Yca1p, additional protein bands were also detected at this time point, suggesting the possibility of their partial proteolysis by endogenous yeast protease activities or by itself (autocatalytic processing). The levels of AtMCP1b and AtMCP2b were comparable to the level of Yca1p when expressed in yca1Δ mutant. Similar results were obtained with the wild-type yeast strain (data not shown). From these, we concluded that AtMCP1b and AtMCP2b can be efficiently expressed in yeast. Caspase-like Processing of Two AtMCPs—Most animal caspases are initially produced in cells as catalytically inactive zymogens and must undergo proteolytic activation during apoptosis. The inactive zymogens consist of an N-terminal prodomain, a large catalytic subunit of ∼20 kDa, and a small C-terminal catalytic subunit (∼10 kDa) that become activated by scaffold-mediate transactivation or by cleavage via upstream proteases in an intracellular cascade (3Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2451) Google Scholar, 5Shi Y. Mol.

Similarly, it was shown that such a caspase-like processing would be essential for activation of Yca1p that is initiated by the proteolytic removal of the small subunit, which probably corresponds to the band of ∼12-kDa and that depends on its catalytic center Cys297 (19Madeo F. Herker E. Maldener C. Wissing S. Lächelt S. Herlan M. Fehr M. Lauber K. Sigrist S.J. Wesselborg S. Fröhlich K-U. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 911-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). We therefore wanted to address the question of whether the caspase-like processing of AtMCP1b and AtMCP2b can be observed in a similar manner to that of Yca1p. To this end, we first monitored by immunoblotting with anti-V5 epitope antibody the expression patterns of AtMCP1b and AtMCP2b as well as Yca1p in yca1Δ mutant during prolonged culture until 72 h after the galactose shift. Interestingly, a strong band of C-terminal fragment of AtMCP1b and AtMCP2b (∼12 kDa) could also be detected over time of expression, although the band patterns were largely different in each strain (Fig. 1B). To demonstrate that their potential catalytic residues are essential for the formation of the C-terminal fragment, the conserved Cys220 of AtMCP1b and Cys139 of AtMCP2b were changed to alanine. In fact, mutations in these residues completely blocked the formation of their C-terminal fragments (see Fig. 3B). A caspase-like processing of AtMCP1b expressed in yca1Δ mutant with additional stimulation by H2O2 clearly depended on its catalytic center Cys220 (Figs. 1 and 3B). In contrast, it seems that caspase-like processing of AtMCP2b depended on its catalytic center Cys139 but did not require an additional apoptotic stimulus, thus implicating an autocatalytic mechanism (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, formation of the ∼25-kDa C-terminal fragment of AtMCP2b was not detectable after mutation of Cys139, suggesting the possibility that a larger C-terminal fragment (∼25 kDa) might be an intermediate form to generate a smaller C-terminal fragment (∼12 kDa) that corresponds to p10 subunit of mammalian caspases and Yca1p. Expression of AtMCP1b and AtMCP2b in Synergy with Prolonged Culture or Oxidative Stress Leads to Cell Death in Yeast—To assess the effect of AtMCP1b and AtMCP2b on the viability of wild-type yeast cells, cells growing in liquid culture were stained with trypan blue, and cell death was quantified by microscopy. Similarly, effect of YCA1"

Proposals for the toxic properties typically involve aberrant catalytic activities or protein aggregation. The striking thermodynamic stability of mature forms of the ALS mutant SOD1 (Tm >70 °C) is not typical of protein aggregation models that involve unfolding. Over 44 states of the polypeptide are possible, depending upon metal occupancy, disulfide status, and oligomeric state; however, it is not clear which forms might be responsible for toxicity. Recently the intramolecular disulfide has been shown to be required for SOD1 activity, leading us to examine these states of several disease-causing SOD1 mutants. We find that ALS mutations have the greatest effect on the most immature form of SOD1, destabilizing the metal-free and disulfide-reduced polypeptide to the point that it is unfolded at physiological temperatures (Tm < 37 °C). We also find that immature states of ALS mutant (but not wild type) proteins readily form oligomers at physiological concentrations. Furthermore, these oligomers are more susceptible to mild oxidative stress, which promotes incorrect disulfide cross-links between conserved cysteines and drives aggregation. Thus it is the earliest disulfide-reduced polypeptides in the SOD1 assembly pathway that are most destabilized with respect to unfolding and oxidative aggregation by ALS-causing mutations.

About 10% of total ALS cases are of familial origin, and of these, ∼20% are caused by point mutations in the abundant enzyme Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) (2Rosen D.R. Siddique T. Patterson D.

SOD1 is a dimer of identical subunits, each of which contains a copper and a zinc ion, and catalyzes conversion of superoxide anion to oxygen and hydrogen peroxide at a dinuclear copper-zinc site (3McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of SOD1 knock-out mice reveal no motor neuron disease (4Reaume A.G. Elliott J.L. Hoffman E.K.

Among the proposed gain of functions is aberrant redox chemistry arising from modification of active copper and zinc sites in ALS mutants. For example, enhanced peroxidase activity (5Wiedau-Pazos M.

The requirement of copper ion for toxicity has, however, been put into question, because ALS symptoms are observed in mice expressing the SOD1 mutant in which all of the copper ligands are mutated (8Wang J.

Another hypothesis for a toxic function acquired by the mutant SOD1 proteins is an increased propensity for cytoplasmic aggregation, which is one of the pathological features common to familial ALS (9Bruijn L.I.

ALS mutations have been considered to induce protein misfolding and/or destabilization; in fact, ALS mutations provoke a decrease of 1–6 °C in the melting temperature of SOD1 (10Rodriguez J.A.

Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2645-2649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reduced zinc affinity in ALS mutants has been proposed to facilitate destabilization of mature SOD1 (12Crow J.P. Sampson J.B. Zhuang Y. Thompson J.A. Beckman J.S. J.

Chem. 1973; 248: 2645-2649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Many studies have focused on how mutations predispose the active mature protein to adventitious reactions; however, studies of the polypeptide in the earlier stages are now emerging (13Hough M.A. Grossmann J.G.

Although it remains unclear how SOD1 acquires zinc ions, the copper chaperone for SOD1 (CCS) typically controls copper acquisition (16Culotta V.C. Klomp L.W.J. Strain J. Casareno R.L.B. Krems B.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2872-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Given that ALS mutants are more susceptible to disulfide reduction compared with the WT protein (20Tiwari A. Hayward L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5984-5992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), adventitious reductions have been proposed as an important step in the disease. It is not known, however, if altered regulation of the thiol/disulfide status is associated with ALS mutations. In fact, many of the early physicochemical studies were conducted on mixtures of the SOD1 proteins in various degrees of post-translational modifications. In particular, the status of the essential intra-subunit disulfide and the protein quaternary structure is important but frequently unreported. In this study, we focus on how the stability of both WT and ALS mutant proteins is influenced by post-translational modifications. Given that four post-translational events precede SOD1 activation, i.e. copper and zinc binding, disulfide formation, and dimerization, it is clear that SOD1 can adopt 44 canonical microstates, where metal binding at incorrect sites are not taken into account. It was not clear which states of the protein are most destabilized by disease-causing mutations. By examining representative subgroups of these states, we can now establish a hierarchy for the effects of zinc binding and disulfide formation on stability and aggregation of WT SOD1 and three ALS mutants (A4V, G85R, and G93A). The results indicate that the unmodified polypeptide is least stable and show that ALS mutants in this state are unfolded and oligomerized at physiological temperature. Disulfide formation and zinc binding reduce oligomer formation by increasing the thermal stability of SOD1. The disulfide-reduced forms, furthermore, are highly susceptible to disulfide-linked multimerization upon oxidative stress, indicating that regulation of intra- or inter-molecular disulfide formation can determine whether SOD1 aggregates or adopts the mature state. In contrast to many models that focus on altered attributes of the mature SOD1 enzyme, these results now focus attention on aberrant properties of the most immature polypeptide and on the role that post-translational modifications may play in SOD1 aggregation. Preparation of the Apo and Reduced Human SOD1 Proteins—Proteins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and purified as described previously (19Furukawa Y. Torres A.S. O'Halloran T.V. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2872-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 21Leinweber B. Barofsky E. Barofsky D.F. Ermilov V. Nylin K. Beckman J.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 911-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For preparation of the disulfide-reduced protein, 750 μl of as-isolated human SOD1 (hSOD1) (∼3.0 g/liter) was anaerobically treated with 200 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) to reduce disulfide bonds. After anaerobic incubation at 37 °C for an hour, solutions were acidified with 0.4% trifluoroacetic acid to reduce the reactivity of thiol groups and to promote the dissociation of metal ions from SOD1. Following incubation in 15% CH3CN, 10% CH3OH at room temperature for an hour, the proteins were purified by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography through a C4 Vydac 214TP54 column as described (19Furukawa Y. Torres A.S. O'Halloran T.V. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2872-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The isolated apo-SOD1 has less than 0.1 and 10% for copper and zinc ions, respectively, based on the inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopic analysis. Reduction of the disulfide bond was confirmed by the 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (AMS) modification (see below). The resulting apo and reduced SOD1 proteins can be activated by adding copper-bound CCS (data not shown) (19Furukawa Y. Torres A.S. O'Halloran T.V. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2872-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 22Rae T.D. Torres A.S. Pufahl R.A. O'Halloran T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5166-5176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), indicating that the protein tolerates relatively harsh treatment with acid and organic solvents. The disulfide form of the protein was prepared by oxidizing ∼200 μm E,E-hSOD1SH with 1 mm K3[Fe(CN)6] in the presence of 200 μm ZnSO4 and 20% glycerol. After 1 h of aerobic incubation, the solution was acidified and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography as described above. Protein concentrations were determined with the absorption at 280 nm using 5500 m–1 cm–1 per monomer as the extinction coefficient (23Lyons T.J. Nersissian A. Goto J.J. Zhu H. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1998; 3: 650-662Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The Bradford assay with IgG as a standard was also used to routinely determine the protein concentration. Thiol Modifications—To analyze the thiol-disulfide status in hSOD1, modification with either AMS (Molecular Probes, Inc.) or iodoacetamide (IA) was employed (19Furukawa Y. Torres A.S. O'Halloran T.V. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2872-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Protein was precipitated with 20% trichloroacetic acid, washed with acetone, and dried under vacuum. Protein pellets were brought into the anaerobic chamber and redissolved in the modification buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm bathocuproine disulfonate, 2.5% SDS) containing either 25 mm AMS or 100 mm IA. After anaerobic incubation at 37 °C for an hour, the modified proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Electrophoresis—Proteins were separated on 12.5% polyacrylamide Tris-HCl resolving gel with a 5.4% polyacrylamide stacking gel. Samples were dissolved in Laemmli buffer with/without β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME) and boiled at 95 °C for 2 min before loading. The gels were run at constant voltage of 150 V and stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue. For the Western blot, separated proteins in the SDS-polyacrylamide gel were blotted to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) and blocked for an hour with the ECL blocking agent (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was further incubated with the anti-superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn), human erythrocyte (sheep) (1:1000 dilution, Calbiochem) as the primary antibody, and with rabbit anti-sheep IgG (H + L) (1:1000 dilution, Bio-Rad) as the secondary antibody. Blots were developed with the ECL Plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Differential Scanning Calorimetry—Melting temperatures were obtained by using Microcal VP-DSC using a scan speed, 90 °C/h, under ∼31 pounds/square inch of pressure, with the filter set to 5 s. Base-line curves were derived using Origin software (Microcal). About 500 μl of 1–2 g/liter SOD1 proteins was used for measurement. Chelex-treated 50 mm K-Pi, pH 7.8, was used as a buffer, and 1 mm tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP, Molecular Probes, Inc.) was included when the disulfide-reduced proteins were examined. Glycerol-containing buffer was also treated with Chelex before its use for measurements. Solutions were degassed for 25 min using a vacuum pump with stirring before measurements. The experiments were repeated two or three times to estimate the experimental error of Tm values. After measurements, samples were submitted to AMS modification followed by the SDS-PAGE analysis, revealing that no air oxidation of the thiol groups occurred in the course of the experiment. Gel Filtration Chromatography—200 μl of 30 μm hSOD1 was loaded on Superose 12 HR 10/30 (Amersham Biosciences). For examination of the E,E-hSOD1 states, the column was pre-equilibrated with degassed buffer (50 mm K-Pi, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.8) at 4 °C, and the flow rate was 1.0 ml/min. In the case of the E,Zn-hSOD1 states, 30 μm ZnSO4 was added to the buffer in place of 0.1 mm EDTA. To prevent possible air oxidation of the Cys groups, 1 mm DTT was added to the eluant in experiments using reduced SOD1 proteins. Absorbance changes were monitored at 215 nm. The column was calibrated using 0.25 g/liter immunoglobulin G, bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, carbonic anhydrase, horse skeletal myoglobin, E. coli thioredoxin, and aprotinin. Human SOD1 (hSOD1) has four cysteine residues; Cys6, Cys57, Cys111, and Cys146, among which Cys57 and Cys146 are conserved and form the intra-molecular disulfide bond (24Bordo D. Djinovic K. Bolognesi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 366-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In this study, X,Y-hSOD1SH/S-S signifies protein derivatives in which metal ions have been substituted into the copper-binding site (X) or zinc-binding site (Y). E means empty at the metal-binding site, and the superscripts, SH or S–S, indicate the thiol/disulfide status of the conserved Cys residues. For instance, E,Zn-hSOD1SH denotes disulfide-reduced protein with a Zn2+ ion at the zinc-binding site but no metal ion at the copper-binding site. To reveal the effects of post-translational modifications on protein stability, we first measured the melting temperatures of E,E- and E,Zn-hSOD1SH/S-S. Post-translational Modifications Can Increase SOD1 Thermal Stability—Whereas accurate enthalpy values for SOD1 thermal unfolding are not readily obtained from the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermograms (25Lepock J.R. Frey H.E. Hallewell R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21612-21618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), comparisons of the relative melting temperature, Tm, reveal relationships among the thermal stabilities of isolated states of SOD1. The unmodified WT protein, E,E-hSOD1SH, melts between 30 and 50 °C and exhibits an endothermic peak at 42.9 °C (Fig. 1A). Given that the holoenzyme (Cu,Zn-hSOD1S-S) is one of the most stable proteins known in mesophilic organisms (11Forman H.J. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2645-2649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is interesting that the Tm of the SOD1 polypeptide in the absence of any post-translational modifications is just above the typical physiological temperature in mammals, ∼37 °C. Disulfide formation and zinc binding stabilize the SOD1 polypeptide, increasing the Tm to 49.8 and 58.4 °C, respectively. The Tm value is further increased to 74.6 °C upon formation of the disulfide in E,Zn-hSOD1 (Fig. 1, A and B). Fig. 1C graphically shows increase of Tm, ΔTm, after post-translational modifications relative to the unmodified E,E-hSOD1SH state. Disulfide formation in E,E-hSOD1SH increases Tm by as much as 6.9 °C, whereas a 15.5 °C increase is observed upon binding of the Zn2+ ion. Zinc binding therefore has a larger contribution to SOD1 stability than disulfide formation. These increases of Tm are comparable with those upon disulfide formation or zinc binding in other proteins (26Chlebowski J.F. Mabrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7042-7052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Matsumura M. Signor G. Matthews B.W. Nature. 1989; 342: 291-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). It is also notable that the ΔTm of 31.7 °C upon both zinc binding and disulfide formation is significantly larger than ΔTm values for the individual modifications (Fig. 1C). Zinc binding and disulfide formation can thus increase the thermal stability of SOD1. Given that one of the disulfide-bonding cysteine residues, Cys57, is positioned in loop IV, reduction of the loop flexibility upon disulfide formation would result in the SOD1 stabilization (Fig. 1, D and E). Furthermore, not only Cys57 but also all ligands for the Zn2+ ion (His63, His71, His80, and Asp83) are involved in loop IV. Zinc binding would hence be able to introduce structural restraints around loop IV more significantly than disulfide formation, which is consistent with a larger stabilizing effect due to zinc binding (Fig. 1C). Disulfide formation and zinc binding may stabilize SOD1 through reduction of the loop IV flexibility; in fact, E,E-hSOD1SH is on the threshold of unfolding at physiological temperature even without any disease-associated mutations (Fig. 1A). This is interesting given that protein aggregates containing WT hSOD1 have been found in a subset of sporadic forms of ALS disease where the molecular defects remain unknown (28Shibata N. Hirano A. Kobayashi M. Sasaki S. Kato T. Matsumoto S. Shiozawa Z. Komori T. Ikemoto A. Umahara T. Asayama K. Neurosci. Lett. 1994; 179: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). During DSC measurements, formation of non-native disulfide bonds such as the one between Cys6 and Cys111 may also occur (25Lepock J.R. Frey H.E. Hallewell R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21612-21618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We thus further tested for stabilizing effects of the post-translational modifications on hSOD1 by using the following Cys mutants: C6S/C111S and C6S/C57S/C111S/C146S (C4S). The C4S mutant has no Cys residues and can serve as a control for the disulfide-reduced form, whereas the C6S/C111S mutant, which has no free thiol groups when the conserved disulfide bond (Cys57–Cys146) is intact, can be compared with the disulfide state of WT protein. The apo-form of the C4S mutant and the reduced C6S/C111S mutant exhibit Tm values of 37.2 and 37.8 °C, respectively (Table I). As with WT protein, zinc addition and disulfide formation in the Cys mutants lead to protein stabilization by increasing Tm (Table I). We conclude from these results that the observed stabilization of WT protein upon oxidation arises from formation of the conserved disulfide and not from adventitious disulfides involving Cys6 or Cys111. Another important observation in Table I is that mutation of these two Cys residues slightly stabilizes the modified proteins but destabilizes the unmodified polypeptides; the unmodified polypeptides of both Cys mutants represent a destabilization between 5.1 and 5.7 °C from that of WT (ΔTmmut in Table I). The alterations in Tm observed upon the Cys mutations may be relevant in the ALS mechanism, because disease-associated mutations have been reported for Cys6 and Cys146 (www.alsod.org). In order to examine how disease-associated mutations alter the protein stability, we next measured Tm of two common and widely studied ALS mutants, A4V and G93A.Table IMelting temperature of human SOD1 and its Cys mutantsMetallationSHS-STm °CΔTmmut °CTm °CΔTmmut °CWTE,E42.9 ± 0.2NAaNA, not applicable.49.8 ± 0.3NAE,Zn58.4 ± 0.2NA74.6 ± 0.2NAC6S/C111SE,E37.8 ± 0.3-5.151.4 ± 0.1+1.6E,Zn61.0 ± 0.2+2.675.8 ± 0.2+1.2C4SE,E37.2 ± 0.1-5.7NANAE,Zn64.7 ± 0.3+6.3NANAa NA, not applicable. Open table in a new tab Unmodified ALS Mutant SOD1 Polypeptides Melt at Temperatures Below Physiological Threshold—Previous studies have shown that Tm values of ALS mutants are 3–15 °C lower compared with that of WT protein, although in these cases the thiol/disulfide status was not determined, and mixtures of states are sometimes apparent in the thermograms (10Rodriguez J.A.

Most unexpectedly, however, we could not characterize an endothermic transition on the E,E-hSOD1SH samples of A4V and G93A mutants in 50 mm K-Pi, 1 mm TCEP, pH 7.8, between 5 and 100 °C. A simple explanation is that this state of the ALS mutants is not fully folded or does not have a distinct structure that is detectable with calorimetry (see below); however, the negative results do not support a strong conclusion. To test this further, we repeated the experiment in the presence of 20% glycerol, which generally increases protein stability and melting temperature by lowering water activity (30Gekko K. Timasheff S.N. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4677-4686Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, clear melting temperatures for the E,E-hSOD1SH states of ALS mutants were obtained, 35.2 °C (A4V) and 31.2 °C (G93A). These Tm values for the mutant E,E-hSOD1SH states are significantly lower (by 10.6 °C in A4V and 14.6 °C in G93A) than that of WT protein in the same glycerol-containing buffer (ΔTmmut in Table II). These results show that ALS mutants are completely unfolded in the E,E-hSOD1SH state at physiological temperature and concentration, even when protein-stabilizing agents are present.Table IIMelting temperature of human SOD1 and its ALS mutantsMetallationSHS—STm °CΔTmmut °CTm °CΔTmmut °CE,E42.9 ± 0.249.8 ± 0.3WTE,E (20% glycerol)45.8 ± 0.351.8 ± 0.1E,Zn58.4 ± 0.274.6 ± 0.2E,Zn (20% glycerol)59.0 ± 0.175.7 ± 0.4E,E—aDash indicates no discernible peak.37.4 ± 0.2-12.4A4VE,E (20% glycerol)35.2 ± 0.4-10.647.5 ± 1.0-4.3E,Zn49.8 ± 0.5-8.667.8 ± 0.3-6.8E,Zn (20% glycerol)56.0 ± 0.1-3.078.7 ± 1.0+3.0E,E—aDash indicates no discernible peak.40.3 ± 0.4-9.5G93AE,E (20% glycerol)31.2 ± 0.3-14.642.0 ± 0.1-9.8E,Zn54.8 ± 0.2-3.672.8 ± 0.1-1.8E,Zn (20% glycerol)59.5 ± 0.1+0.575.4 ± 0.2-0.3a Dash indicates no discernible peak. Open table in a new tab As with WT protein (Table I), disulfide formation and zinc binding in E,E-hSOD1SH of ALS mutants raise Tm values and significantly increase protein stability (Fig. 2, A and B, and Table II). Tm values of WT and ALS mutants before and after post-translational modifications in the presence of 20% glycerol are schematically compared in Fig. 2C. Unlike the WT protein, however, disulfide formation alone may be inefficient at stabilizing the A4V and G93A mutant proteins at physiological temperature, especially in the absence of 20% glycerol, Tm = 37.4 °C (A4V) and 40.3 °C (G93A) (Table II). This is consistent with the previous study showing that apo forms of SOD1 of A4V and G93A are partially unfolded at 23 °C (31Lindberg M.J. Tibell L. Oliveberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16607-16612Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In that case, the disulfide status is not reported, but, judging from the preparation method, apo-SOD1 would have the disulfide bond. On the other hand, zinc binding in ALS mutants leads to a Tm high enough to be completely folded at physiological temperature, and the lowering of the Tm due to ALS mutations is alleviated by zinc binding (Fig. 2C and Table II). To highlight the mutational effects on the protein stability, differences in Tm between WT and ALS mutants, ΔTmmut, are plotted against each state (Fig. 2, D and E). In both ALS mutants, the most significant ΔTmmut is observed for the E,E-hSOD1SH state, and post-translational modifications, especially zinc binding, rescue the protein from its destabilization due to the mutations. Because unfolded or incompletely folded proteins will be generally more solvent-exposed, they are prone to inappropriate interactions with proteins (32Linding R. Schymkowitz J. Rousseau F. Diella F. Serrano L. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 33Dobson C.M. Nature. 2003; 426: 884-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (3758) Google Scholar). That ALS mutations drop the Tm values of the E,E-hSOD1SH state below physiological temperature supports the argument that these forms contribute to aggregation. These are the first reports of Tm values for the most immature form of SOD1. The new results for more mature forms are consistent with the few published DSC studies on SOD1 and, in some cases, facilitate assignment of Tm values reported in the literature for mixtures (Table S1). To probe the SOD1 aggregation states, we characterized each modified state by using the gel filtration chromatography. Unmodified Form of ALS Mutants Is Oligomerized—Gel filtration studies conducted at 4 °C show that E,E-hSOD1SH of WT is a monomer at 30 μm (Fig. 3A), a concentration within the physiological range of 10–100 μm (34Kurobe N. Suzuki F. Okajima K. Kato K. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1990; 187: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 35Lindenau J. Noack H. Possel H. Asayama K. Wolf G. Glia. 2000; 29: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Consistent with our previous findings (36Arnesano F. Banci L. Bertini I. Martinelli M. Furukawa Y. O'Halloran T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47998-48003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), either disulfide formation, zinc addition, or both leads to dimerization (Fig. 3, A and B). No aggregated forms are observed, which is also consistent with the calorimetry results showing that the WT polypeptide melts at 42.9 °C (Table II). Unlike the distinct monomer"

https://openalex.org/W2069728007,"The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) is a central regulator of adipogenesis and recruits coactivator proteins in response to ligand. However, the role of another class of nuclear cofactors, the nuclear receptor corepressors, in modulating PPARγ transcriptional activity is less clear. Such corepressors include the nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR) and the silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT). Our data suggest that PPARγ recruits SMRT and NCoR in the absence of ligand and that these corepressors are capable of down-regulating PPARγ-mediated transcriptional activity. The addition of the PPARγ ligand pioglitazone results in dissociation of the PPARγ-corepressor complex. To define the role of SMRT and NCoR in PPARγ action, 3T3-L1 cells deficient in SMRT or NCoR were generated by RNA interference. When these cells are exposed to differentiation media, they exhibit increased expression of adipocyte-specific genes and increased production of lipid droplets, as compared with control cells. These data suggest that the nuclear receptor corepressors decrease PPARγ transcriptional activity and repress the adipogenic program in 3T3-L1 cells.

This ligand-independent repression is mediated by nuclear receptor corepressors, such as the nuclear receptor corepressor protein (NCoR) and the silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT) (1.Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1688) Google Scholar, 2.Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1694) Google Scholar). NCoR and SMRT are recruited by TR and RAR isoforms in the absence of ligand and are released upon ligand binding. NCoR and SMRT, in turn, recruit a complex with histone deacetylase activity to repress transcription of target genes. More recently, NCoR and SMRT have been shown to be recruited by other nuclear receptors, some of which bind nuclear receptor corepressors in the presence of antagonists. However, it has been controversial whether NCoR and SMRT play a significant role in gene regulation by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) isoforms (3.Zamir I. Zhang J. Lazar M.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 835-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Two types of PPARγ isoforms exist, PPARγ1 and PPARγ2. These receptors differ only in their amino-terminal A/B domain, such that PPARγ2 contains an extra 30 amino acids (4.Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37731-37734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). The function of PPARγ2 has attracted considerable interest because it is specifically expressed in adipocytes and is an essential regulator of adipogenesis. In addition, many important adipocyte-specific genes contain response elements for PPARγ in their promoter regions. Although PPARγ clearly recruits coactivators in response to exogenous ligands, its ability to recruit corepressors is less certain. In contrast to the TR, PPARγ does not appear to be a strong repressor in the absence of its ligand. Such experiments, however, have been limited by the lack of information concerning physiologic endogenous ligands. Early work into PPARγ and corepressor recruitment suggested that PPARγ might not recruit NCoR or SMRT in the presence of DNA response elements (3.Zamir I. Zhang J. Lazar M.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 835-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Another report suggested that PPARγ could recruit the corepressor SMRT in the presence of signaling by epidermal growth factor (5.Lavinsky R.M. Jepsen K. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Mullen T.M. Schiff R. Del-Rio A.L. Ricote M. Ngo S. Gemsch J. Hilsenbeck S.G. Osborne C.K. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Rose D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2920-2925Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Later work suggested that PPARγ can recruit nuclear receptor corepressors in cells (6.Wang L.H. Yang X.Y. Zhang X. Huang J. Hou J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 5754-5759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), and overexpression of NCoR or SMRT has been shown to repress PPARγ-mediated gene transcription in certain cell types (8.Krogsdam A.M.

In addition, mutant PPARγ receptors found in patients with PPARγ resistance bind corepressors but release them aberrantly in the presence of exogenous ligands (9.Agostini M. Gurnell M. Savage D.B. Wood E.M. Smith A.G. Rajanayagam O. Garnes K.T. Levinson S.H. Xu H.E. Schwabe J.W. Willson T.M. O'Rahilly S. Chatterjee V.K. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 1527-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Finally, a recent study suggested that NCoR is required for the NAD-dependent deacetylase Sirt1 to decrease fat accumulation (10.Picard F. Kurtev M. Chung N. Topark-Ngarm A. Senawong T. Oliveira R.M. Leid M. McBurney M.W. Guarente L. Nature. 2004; 429: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar). The 3T3-L1 cell line has been used as a model of adipogenesis because, in the presence of defined hormonal stimulation, 3T3-L1 fibroblasts differentiate into adipocytes. This process has been carefully investigated and is accompanied by an increase in PPARγ2 expression. In turn, PPARγ2 plays a central role in adipogenesis, by increasing the expression of C/EBPα and other downstream adipocyte-specific genes (11.Rosen E.D. Walkey C.J. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1293-1307PubMed Google Scholar). In the following experiments, we show that PPARγ2 can recruit NCoR and SMRT in 3T3-L1 cells and that these corepressors repress PPARγ-mediated gene transcription. We then generate stable populations of cells deficient in NCoR or SMRT using siRNA technology; 3T3-L1 cells lacking either NCoR or SMRT exhibit enhanced expression of adipocyte-specific genes, suggesting that nuclear receptor corepressors modulate adipogenesis via effects on PPARγ activity. Plasmids—Plasmids for Gal4-TR, Gal4-RAR, upstream activating sequence-luciferase (UAS-Luc), VP16-NCoR, VP16-SMRT, Gal4-NCoR, and Gal4-SMRT have previously been described (12.Cohen R.N. Brzostek S.

Gal4-PPARγ was constructed by placing the coding sequence for the PPARγ ligand-binding domain downstream of the Gal4 DNA-binding domain in the vector pECE. VP16-PPARγ2 was constructed by placing the entire coding sequence of PPARγ2 downstream of VP16 in the vector pVP16 (Clontech). PPRE-Luc was made by placing two copies of the modified DR+1 element AGGACAAAGGTCA (15.Park Y. Freedman B.D. Lee E.J. Park S. Jameson J.L. Diabetologia. 2003; 46: 365-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) upstream of luciferase in the pGL2 promoter vector (Promega). The NCoR and SMRT cDNA sequences were placed in the expression vector pSG5. The siRNA constructs were made by placing annealed oligonucleotides representing NCoR or SMRT sequences and into the pSilencer-Hygro vector (Ambion) per the manufacturer's instructions. The sense strand of the NCoR sequence was as follows (including linkers): GATCCAGGAAGAGTGTTCCTGATTTTCAAGAGAAATCAGGAACACTCTTCCTTTTTTTGGAAA. The sense strand of the SMRT sequence was as follows (including linkers): GATCCGTGACTACATCACCTCGCAGTTCAAGAGACTGCGAGGTGATGTAGTCATTTTTTGGAAA. The negative control siRNA construct used was provided by Ambion. Cell Culture and Transfection—3T3-L1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, glutamine, and 10% calf serum. The cells were transfected with Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer's instructions, with the following exceptions. For mammalian two-hybrid assays, 3 h after transfection (in serum-free medium), the cells were washed with PBS and placed in fresh serum-free media, with or without varying concentrations of pioglitazone (a generous gift from Takeda Pharmaceuticals); luciferase activity was assessed 20–24 h later. For NCoR or SMRT overexpression studies, the cells were transfected on day 1, and 3 h after transfection, the cells were washed in PBS and changed to full medium. On day 2, the cells were washed with PBS again and changed to serum-free medium. Luciferase activity was measured on day 3. All of the transient transfections were performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times. For stable transfections, 6 μg of the indicated siRNA construct in pSilencer-Hygro were transfected in cell culture dishes and placed in fresh medium 3 h later. The following day, the cells were washed with PBS and placed in full medium supplemented with hygromycin. The cells were placed in fresh hygromycin-containing medium every 3–4 days. When the cells were about 75% confluent, they were split into new culture dishes with fresh hygromycin. 3T3-L1 Cell Differentiation—The 3T3-L1 cells were allowed to grow until confluency and then refed with fresh medium for 2 more days. The cells were placed in medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, insulin, dexamethasone, and isobutylmethylxanthine for 3 days, as previously described (16.Brady M.J. Kartha P.M. Aysola A.A. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27497-27504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). After 3 days, the cells were placed in medium with fresh 10% fetal calf serum and insulin for 2 days. After this truncated differentiation protocol, the cells were either harvested for Western blot experiments or allowed to differentiate further and then fixed and stained with Oil Red O. Western Blots—After 3T3-L1 cell differentiation, the cells were prepared for either whole cell extracts (for PPARγ, C/EBPα, NCoR, and SMRT) or cytoplasmic extracts (for adiponectin, perilipin, and protein phosphatase 1), which were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and blotted with specific primary antibodies. The antibodies used were as follows: anti-NCoR (a generous gift from Tony Hollenberg, M.D., Boston, MA), anti-SMRT (generated from the peptide sequence LKMEKERNAR), anti-PPARγ (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), anti-C/EBPα (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), anti-protein phosphatase 1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), anti-adiponectin (Chemicon), and anti-perilipin (Research Diagnostics, Inc.). For the anti-SMRT blot, whole cell extracts were first immunoprecipitated with the anti-SMRT antibody, then run on SDS-PAGE, and blotted with the anti-SMRT antibody. Oil Red O Staining—The Oil Red O stock solution was prepared by mixing 0.5 g of Oil Red O in 100 ml of isopropanol. Differentiated 3T3-L1 cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and then washed with PBS. The cells were incubated with an Oil Red O dilution (6 ml of Oil Red O stock, 4 ml of distilled water) for 30–60 min with gentle agitation, followed by further washing with PBS. SMRT and NCoR share a similar overall structure and contain amino-terminal repressing domains and carboxyl-terminal interacting domains (IDs). The interactions between nuclear receptors and corepressors are dependent on these IDs, which contain so-called CoRNR box sequences of the form (I/l)XX-(I/V)I, where X represents any amino acid (17.Hu X. Lazar M.A. Nature. 1999; 402: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 18.Nagy L. Kao H.Y. Love J.D. Li C. Banayo E. Gooch J.T. Krishna V. Chatterjee K. Evans R.M. Schwabe J.W. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3209-3216Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 19.Perissi V. Staszewski L.M. McInerney E.M. Kurokawa R. Krones A. Rose D.W. Lambert M.H. Milburn M.V. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3198-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). SMRT contains two interacting domains, whereas NCoR additionally contains a third domain that is proximal to the other two (Fig. 1A). To determine whether PPARγ recruits SMRT and NCoR in 3T3-L1 cells, we initially used a mammalian two-hybrid assay. The ligand-binding domains of PPARγ, TRβ, and RARα were placed downstream of the Gal4 DNA-binding domains. These Gal4 constructs were then cotransfected with VP16-corepressor constructs and a UAS-Luc reporter vector to assess interactions in 3T3-L1 cells. Consistent with our prior data (12.Cohen R.N. Brzostek S. Kim B. Chorev M. Wondisford F.E. Hollenberg A.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1049-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 13.Cohen R.N. Putney A. Wondisford F.E. Hollenberg A.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 900-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), TRβ interacts more strongly with NCoR than SMRT, and RARα interacts more weakly than TRβ with NCoR (Fig. 1B). Surprisingly, however, Gal4-PPARγ was able to recruit both NCoR and SMRT to a similar degree as RARα in 3T3-L1 cells. To determine whether full-length PPARγ2 could also recruit corepressors, full-length PPARγ2 was placed downstream of VP16 and cotransfected with Gal4-SMRT or Gal4-NCoR. As shown in Fig. 1C, full-length PPARγ2 interacted with both SMRT and NCoR in 3T3-L1 cells, although the interaction with SMRT was much stronger. To determine which SMRT ID was responsible for this strong interaction, the CoRNR box sequences in either SMRT ID1 or ID2 were mutated. It has been shown that mutation of the initial isoleucine or leucine to alanine abolishes interaction between the corepressor ID and nuclear receptors (12.Cohen R.N. Brzostek S. Kim B. Chorev M. Wondisford F.E. Hollenberg A.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1049-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 17.Hu X. Lazar M.A. Nature. 1999; 402: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Therefore, the initial CoRNR box amino acids in SMRT ID1 and ID2 were individually altered to alanine in Gal4-SMRT to create Gal4-SMRTΔID1 and Gal4-SMRTΔID2. As shown in Fig. 1D, VP16-PPARγ2 interacts strongly with Gal4-SMRTΔID2, but interactions with Gal4-SMRTΔID1 are abolished. These data suggest that SMRT ID1 is required for full interactions with PPARγ2, consistent with prior data using isolated IDs in heterologous 293 cells (9.Agostini M. Gurnell M. Savage D.B. Wood E.M. Smith A.G. Rajanayagam O. Garnes K.T. Levinson S.H. Xu H.E. Schwabe J.W. Willson T.M. O'Rahilly S. Chatterjee V.K. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 1527-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To confirm that this interaction occurred with wild-type protein in 3T3-L1 cells, the cells were allowed to differentiate for 3 days with insulin, dexamethasone, and isobutylmethylxanthine to increase endogenous PPARγ levels. Then whole cell extracts from these cells were immunoprecipitated with either an anti-SMRT, anti-NCoR, or control antibody and then subjected to Western blot using an anti-PPARγ antibody. As shown in Fig. 2A, the cell fraction containing NCoR and SMRT in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells also contains PPARγ, suggesting that endogenous PPARγ recruits corepressors in vivo. To determine whether the interaction of PPARγ and corepressors in 3T3-L1 cells is functional, a PPRE-Luciferase construct was transfected into 3T3-L1 cells in the presence or absence of overexpressed PPARγ2, because PPARγ2 is not expressed at high levels in undifferentiated cells. As expected, cotransfected PPARγ2 resulted in an increase in luciferase activity, in part because of the ligand-independent activation function in its amino terminus (Fig. 2B). Overexpression of pSG5-SMRT resulted in a modest decrease in luciferase activity in the absence of overexpressed PPARγ2. In contrast, in the presence of PPARγ2, transfection of NCoR or SMRT resulted in a strong decrease in luciferase activity (Fig. 2B), suggesting that PPARγ2 recruits corepressors to modulate its activity in 3T3-L1 cells. PPARγ has been identified as a key regulator of adipogenesis. We reasoned that if corepressors repress PPARγ-mediated gene transcription, a decrease in corepressor levels might enhance the expression of adipocyte-specific genes. Therefore, we used the pSilencer vector-based siRNA system (Ambion) to stably transfect siRNA constructs for NCoR or SMRT (or a negative control) in 3T3-L1 cells. Stable transfection has been used by other groups to identify factors important in the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells (20.Tzameli I. Fang H. Ollero M. Shi H. Hamm J.K. Kievit P. Hollenberg A.N. Flier J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36093-36102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). To identify functional NCoR or SMRT siRNA constructs, multiple potential sequences were tested for their ability to decrease overexpressed NCoR or SMRT by transient transfection (data not shown). The functional siRNA constructs identified were then stably expressed in 3T3-L1 cells by transfection followed by selection with hygromycin. Cells stably expressing NCoR or SMRT siRNA constructs (or a negative control siRNA construct) were then analyzed by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 3A, cells containing the stably expressed NCoR siRNA specifically down-regulated NCoR expression, without decreasing SMRT levels. In contrast, the SMRT siRNA construct specifically down-regulated SMRT levels and led to a mild increase in NCoR levels. Neither population of cells had altered levels of other measured proteins, including CBP and C/EBPα. In the undifferentiated state, neither population of cells significantly expressed such adipocyte-specific proteins as adiponectin or perilipin (data not shown), suggesting that the absence of corepressor proteins is not sufficient in itself for adipocyte differentiation. The 3T3-L1 cells were then differentiated in the presence of insulin, dexamethasone, and isobutylmethylxanthine for 3 days and then insulin alone for 2 days. After this truncated differentiation protocol, Western blots were used to analyze protein levels. In cells lacking either NCoR or SMRT, there was increased expression of adiponectin, perilipin, and C/EBPα (Fig. 3B), suggesting that these cells exhibited increased expression of adipocyte-specific genes. In contrast, there was no significant difference in the expression of protein phosphatase 1, a protein that is expressed in both preadipocytes and adipocytes (21.Brady M.J. Nairn A.C. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29698-29703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). After 2 further days of differentiation, the cells were stained with Oil Red O to identify lipid droplets. Cells deficient in NCoR or SMRT exhibited increased cellular staining with Oil Red O (Fig. 3C), consistent with the Western blot data suggesting an increased expression of adipocyte proteins. To determine the effect of ligand on the PPARγ-corepressor interactions, Gal4-SMRT and Gal4-NCoR were cotransfected with VP16-PPARγ2 and a UAS-Luc construct in 3T3-L1 cells, in the presence or absence of varying concentrations of pioglitazone. Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione compound used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, and thiazolidinediones have been shown to be high affinity ligands for PPARγ (22.Olefsky J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, pioglitazone causes a strong decrease in corepressor-PPARγ2 interactions in this two-hybrid assay. To investigate the effects of pioglitazone on endogenous PPARγ-corepressor interactions, 3T3-L1 cells were first differentiated with insulin, dexamethasone, and isobutylmethylxanthine for 3 days to increase PPARγ levels (as in Fig. 2A) and then treated with serum-free medium with or without 10 μm pioglitazone. Whole cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-NCoR or anti-SMRT antibodies and then analyzed by Western blot with an anti-PPARγ antibody. As shown in Fig. 4B, treatment with pioglitazone dramatically reduced PPARγ-SMRT interactions. Although pioglitazone decreased PPARγ-NCoR interactions, the effect was significantly weaker. These data suggest that thiazolidinediones decrease the recruitment of corepressors to PPARγ but may not completely block this effect. Moreover, there are differences between NCoR and SMRT with respect to this process. Next, to determine whether corepressor levels could modulate effects specifically induced by pioglitazone, the 3T3-L1 cells deficient in SMRT or NCoR (Fig. 3A) were induced to differentiate in a pioglitazone-dependent manner. It has been shown previously that insulin and dexamethasone cannot induce 3T3-L1 differentiation but that a combination of insulin, dexamethasone, and thiazolidinedione is sufficient for this process (23.Hamm J.K. Park B.H. Farmer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18464-18471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In fact, cells deficient in corepressors did not differentiate in insulin and dexamethasone alone (data not shown). Therefore, a submaximal concentration of pioglitazone (1 μm) was used in conjunction with insulin and dexamethasone. In the presence of insulin, dexamethasone, and pioglitazone, 3T3-L1 cells were capable of differentiating into adipocytes, but this process was significantly enhanced in the cell lines expressing SMRT and NCoR siRNA constructs. In particular, expression of adiponectin and perilipin was dramatically up-regulated in these cells, whereas expression of protein phosphatase 1 was not significantly affected (Fig. 4C). Oil Red O staining was also significantly enhanced in these cells as compared with control cells (data not shown). PPARγ is known to be a vital transcription factor in the regulation of adipocyte differentiation (11.Rosen E.D. Walkey C.J. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1293-1307PubMed Google Scholar). Obesity is a significant problem in the industrialized world, and the increasing incidence of obesity is expected to result in an increased prevalence of the metabolic syndrome and its consequences, including type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease (24.Gurnell M. Savage D.B. Chatterjee V.K. O'Rahilly S. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 88: 2412-2421Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Thiazolidinedione medications that activate PPARγ and enhance adipogenesis increase insulin sensitivity and are used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, although the exact mechanisms underlying this process remain unclear (22.Olefsky J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). A fat-specific knock-out of PPARγ results in decreased numbers of adipocytes, decreased levels of adipokines, and increased hepatic gluconeogenesis (25.He W. Barak Y. Hevener A. Olson P. Liao D. Le J. Nelson M. Ong E. Olefsky J.M. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15712-15717Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar, 26.Koutnikova H. Cock T.A. Watanabe M. Houten S.M. Champy M.F. Dierich A. Auwerx J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14457-14462Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that PPARγ has other important actions in addition to its effects on adipogenesis. For example, a muscle-specific deletion of PPARγ results in glucose intolerance and insulin resistance (27.Hevener A.L. He W. Barak Y. Le J. Bandyopadhyay G. Olson P. Wilkes J. Evans R.M. Olefsky J. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1491-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Recent data also suggest a role for PPARγ in macrophage function and atherosclerosis (28.Li A.C. Glass C.K. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1235-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). However, the actions of PPARγ have been most widely studied in adipogenesis, and adipocyte differentiation presents a unique model system in which to study PPARγ action (Fig. 5). Although much is known concerning the ability of PPARγ to recruit coactivators to stimulate the expression of target genes, less is known concerning the ability of PPARγ to interact with the nuclear receptor corepressor family members, NCoR and SMRT. In fact, the ability of these nuclear corepressors to modulate the transcriptional activity of PPARγ has been controversial. Partly, this has been due to the fact that PPARγ is not considered to be a strong repressor, and PPARγ binds corepressors only weakly in electrophoretic mobility shift assay (3.Zamir I. Zhang J. Lazar M.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 835-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Importantly, however, immunoprecipitation studies have shown a significant interaction in cells (6.Wang L.H. Yang X.Y. Zhang X. Huang J. Hou J. Li J. Xiong H. Mihalic K. Zhu H. Xiao W. Farrar W.L. Immunity. 2004; 20: 205-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 7.Gurnell M. Wentworth J.M. Agostini M. Adams M. Collingwood T.N. Provenzano C. Browne P.O. Rajanayagam O. Burris T.P. Schwabe J.W. Lazar M.A. Chatterjee V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5754-5759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Increasing evidence also suggests that other nuclear receptors that are not strong repressors in themselves are capable of recruiting corepressors to modify their transcriptional activity. For example, HNF4α, an orphan nuclear receptor, recruits SMRT, which then blocks coactivator recruitment (29.Ruse Jr., M.D. Privalsky M.L. Sladek F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1626-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In fact, the ability of nuclear receptors to recruit corepressors and coactivators has been shown to be a more dynamic process than previously recognized (30.Sohn Y.C. Kim S.W. Lee S. Kong Y.Y. Na D.S. Lee S.K. Lee J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 366-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and the distinct cellular environment plays a significant role in tissue-specific gene regulation (31.Wang Q. Blackford Jr., J.A. Song L.N. Huang Y. Cho S. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1376-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In addition, recent evidence suggests that mutant PPARγ receptors capable of causing PPARγ resistance recruit corepressors well and exhibit dominant-negative activity toward wild-type alleles (9.Agostini M. Gurnell M. Savage D.B. Wood E.M. Smith A.G. Rajanayagam O. Garnes K.T. Levinson S.H. Xu H.E. Schwabe J.W. Willson T.M. O'Rahilly S. Chatterjee V.K. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 1527-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although the nuclear receptor corepressors NCoR and SMRT have been implicated in the pathogenesis of resistance to thyroid hormone, hypothyroidism, and certain types of leukemias (32.Jepsen K. Rosenfeld M.G. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 689-698Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the specific functions of NCoR and SMRT in cells have been difficult to ascertain for a variety of reasons. For example, knock-out of NCoR has been found to be lethal in the embryonic period (33.Jepsen K. Hermanson O. Onami T.M. Gleiberman A.S. Lunyak V. McEvilly R.J. Kurokawa R. Kumar V. Liu F. Seto E. Hedrick S.M. Mandel G. Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 2000; 102: 753-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), limiting the ability to determine which functions of corepressors might be NCoR-specific. In vitro work has suggested that NCoR and SMRT serve a variety of repressing functions and are recruited by nuclear receptors in the absence of ligand or in the presence of certain antagonists. However, overexpression studies of nuclear cofactors have not always been able to fully identify the functions of these proteins. For example, initial experiments suggested significant overlap between p160 coactivators, but in vivo knock-out studies have shown that their functions are nonoverlapping (34.McKenna N.J. O'Malley B.W. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 2461-2465Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The use of siRNA allows for the decreased expression of cofactors in cells to allow for a better understanding of their functional roles. We therefore took advantage of these techniques in 3T3-L1 cells to identify the roles of NCoR and SMRT in adipogenesis. Our data suggest that decreased expression of either NCoR or SMRT is able to increase the expression of adipocyte-specific genes and thus enhance adipogenesis. Although there are multiple reasons why an alteration in corepressor levels could affect adipocyte differentiation, our data also suggest that these effects likely depend on the transcriptional activity of PPARγ. This is true for a number of reasons. First of all, multiple experiments have shown that PPARγ is a central regulator of adipogenesis, and alterations in PPARγ activity profoundly affect adipogenesis (35.Kubota N. Terauchi Y. Miki H. Tamemoto H. Yamauchi T. Komeda K. Satoh S. Nakano R. Ishii C. Sugiyama T. Eto K. Tsubamoto Y. Okuno A. Murakami K. Sekihara H. Hasegawa G. Naito M. Toyoshima Y. Tanaka S. Shiota K. Kitamura T.

Second, it has been shown that mutant PPARγ receptors that recruit corepressors aberrantly can block adipogenesis (7.Gurnell M. Wentworth J.M. Agostini M. Adams M. Collingwood T.N. Provenzano C. Browne P.O. Rajanayagam O. Burris T.P. Schwabe J.W. Lazar M.A. Chatterjee V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5754-5759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 9.Agostini M.

Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 1527-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 15.Park Y. Freedman B.D. Lee E.J. Park S. Jameson J.L. Diabetologia. 2003; 46: 365-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Interestingly, heterozygous knock-out of PPARγ paradoxically leads to enhanced insulin sensitivity as opposed to insulin resistance, suggesting that PPARγ could have ligand-independent effects mediated by corepressors (38.Miles P.D. Barak Y. He W. Evans R.M. Olefsky J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Finally, our data suggest that wild-type PPARγ is capable of recruiting both SMRT and NCoR in 3T3-L1 cells and that these nuclear receptor corepressors repress PPARγ-mediated transcriptional activity. In addition, deficiency in SMRT or NCoR enhances adipogenesis, either in the presence of a standard differentiation mixture or one that requires a thiazolidinedione, a PPARγ-dependent process. Thus, our data suggest that a decrease in NCoR or SMRT levels enhances PPARγ activity and increases the expression of adipocyte-specific genes. Interestingly, a recent report suggested that the NAD-dependent deacetylase Sirt1 also represses PPARγ activity and reduces fat accumulation (10.Picard F. Kurtev M. Chung N. Topark-Ngarm A. Senawong T. Oliveira R.M. Leid M. McBurney M.W. Guarente L. Nature. 2004; 429: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar). In that paper, the Sirt1 effect was dependent on NCoR expression, and NCoR was shown to be recruited to the PPARγ-responsive aP2 promoter by chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments (10.Picard F. Kurtev M. Chung N. Topark-Ngarm A. Senawong T. Oliveira R.M. Leid M. McBurney M.W. Guarente L. Nature. 2004; 429: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar). The current data are in agreement with the data of Picard et al. (10.Picard F. Kurtev M. Chung N. Topark-Ngarm A. Senawong T. Oliveira R.M. Leid M. McBurney M.W. Guarente L. Nature. 2004; 429: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar) and suggest that alterations in NCoR and SMRT by themselves can directly modulate adipogenesis. Our work shows that PPARγ recruits NCoR and SMRT and that these nuclear receptor corepressors repress the ability of PPARγ to stimulate adipogenesis. This represents an alternative or even complementary pathway to the ability of thiazolidinedione compounds (such as pioglitazone) to increase PPARγ transcriptional activity and adipogenesis (Fig. 4) and suggests that alteration in corepressor activity might allow for modulation of adipocyte differentiation and possibly insulin sensitivity in vivo. In sum, modification in NCoR or SMRT expression and/or function provides a mechanism for altering the adipogenic program, which has been shown to be important in the pathogenesis of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

We generated mutant mice lacking or overexpressing calpastatin, the only solely calpain-specific inhibitor ever identified or synthesized. Modulation of calpastatin expression caused no defect in the mice under normal conditions, indicating that calpastatin functions as a negative regulator of calpain only under pathological conditions. Kainate-evoked excitotoxicity in hippocampus resulted in proteolytic activation of a proapoptotic Bcl-2 subfamily member (Bid), nuclear translocation of mitochondria-derived DNA fragmentation factors (apoptosis-inducing factor and endonuclease G), DNA fragmentation, and nuclear condensation in pyramidal neurons. These apoptotic responses were significantly augmented by calpastatin deficiency. Consistently calpastatin overexpression suppressed them. No evidence of caspase-3 activation was detected. Our results demonstrated that calpain mediates excitotoxic signals through mobilization of proapoptotic factors in a caspase-independent manner.

The phenomenon of excitotoxicity is related to the key pathological processes that are involved not only in acute neuronal cell death evoked by surgical insults such as ischemia and spinal cord injury but also in chronic neurodegeneration that arises in neurological disorders such as Alzheimer disease (1Lipton S.A.

Elucidation of the mechanism of excitotoxic neuronal degeneration will therefore contribute to development of strategies for the treatment of both acute and chronic neuronal disorders. Several pieces of experimental evidence (see below) led us to focus our attention in the present study on the role of calpain, a calcium-activated neutral protease, in excitotoxic neuronal death. Because excitotoxicity primarily involves an unphysiological elevation of intraneuronal calcium concentrations, the selective limited proteolysis of intracellular proteins by calpain activated in this way could be responsible for irreversibly modulating substrate functions (6Saido T.C. Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 814-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). This effect could be more damaging than other reversible calcium-dependent processes such as phosphorylation and dephosphorylation.The involvement of calpain in neuronal cell death has been implicated in various neuropathological circumstances including ischemia, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer disease, Parkinson's disease, and polyglutamine diseases (7Saito K.

Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4081-4091Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, exposure of gerbil forebrain to short term ischemia followed by reperfusion induces calpain activation in the hippocampus in a spatiotemporal manner, resulting in delayed neuronal death in the CA1 sector of hippocampus (14Saido T.C. Yokota M. Nagao S. Yamaura I. Tani E. Tsuchiya T. Suzuki K. Kawashima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25239-25243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic experiments using Caenorhabditis elegans also provided firm evidence for the involvement of calpain in neuronal death (15Syntichaki P. Xu K. Driscoll M. Tavenmarakis N. Nature. 2002; 419: 939-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Although a number of calpain substrates including cytoskeletal proteins, kinases, and kinase modulators have been identified (16Wang K.K. Yuen P.W. Calpain: Pharmacology and Toxicology of Calcium-dependent Protease. Taylor & Francis, Philadelphia, PA1999: 77-101Google Scholar), the detailed mechanism of the action of calpain, particularly in vivo, has remained elusive. One of the drawbacks to addressing this issue lies in the redundancy of the protease; there are at least two molecular species of ubiquitous calpain, the μ-calpain and m-calpain isoforms, which require micromolar and millimolar calcium, respectively, for activation in biochemical terms (6Saido T.C. Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 814-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 17Inomata M. Hayashi M. Nakamura M. Imahori K. Kawashima S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1985; 98: 407-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Each of these isoforms is a heterodimer composed of a distinct 80-kDa catalytic subunit and an identical 30-kDa regulatory subunit. Therefore, the structure of the large subunit determines the biochemical properties of the isoforms. Interestingly both the large and small subunits possess multiple calcium-binding sites (18Hosfield C.M. Elce J.S. Davies P.L. Jia Z. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6880-6889Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 19Strobl S. Fernandez-Catalan C. Braun M. Huber R. Masumoto H. Nakagawa K. Irie A. Sorimachi H. Bourenkow G. Bartunik H. Suzuki K. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 588-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), indicating that the two subunits probably interact with each other in a dynamic manner in the presence of calcium. Most researchers familiar with the biochemical properties of these calpain isoforms had presumed that μ-calpain, which can be activated by submicromolar levels of calcium in the presence of phospholipids (20Coolican S.A. Hathaway D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11627-11630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Saido T.C. Shibata M. Takenawa T. Murofushi H. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24585-24590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), rather than m-calpain, would be the main participant in physiological processes, but this presumption has been entirely upset by findings from studies using reverse genetic approaches.While genetic deletion of the commonly shared 30-kDa subunit resulted in disappearance of both μ- and m-calpains leading to embryonic lethality (22Arthur J.S. Elce J.S. Hegadorn C. Williams K. Greer P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4474-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), deletion of the μ-calpain large subunit apparently led to no severe phenotypes (23Azam M. Andrabi S.S. Sahr K.E. Kamath L. Kuliopulos A. Chishti A.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2213-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), indicating that m-calpain is likely to play an essential role in early developmental processes. Consistently genetic deficiency of the m-calpain 80-kDa subunit resulted in a lethal phenotype, 1J. Takano and T. C. Saido, unpublished observation. 1J. Takano and T. C. Saido, unpublished observation. although it remains possible that μ- and m-calpains may function in a cooperative manner under certain circumstances. These reverse genetic observations are contradictory to the biochemistry-based analysis of calpain isoform functions as stated above. The mechanism of m-calpain activation in vivo remains unknown but may be associated with cell adhesion because m-calpain was shown to colocalize with adhesion molecules (24Beckerle M.C. Burridge K. DeMartino G.N. Croall D.E. Cell. 1987; 51: 569-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and because calpain has been identified only in multicellular organisms (6Saido T.C. Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 814-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). In any case, this complexity of subunit composition and function of calpain isoforms together with the coexistence of these isoforms in various cell types including neurons (25Murachi T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1983; 8: 167-169Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (269) Google Scholar) makes the reverse genetic approaches targeting calpain subunits less powerful than expected in addressing the pathophysiological roles of calpain in vivo. Another technical problem in calpain research is that there have been no solely calpain-specific synthetic inhibitors; most, if not all, of the synthetic “calpain inhibitors” thus far used inhibit other cysteine proteases represented by cathepsin B as potently as calpain (26Rock K.L. Gramm C.G. Rothstein K.C. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2178) Google Scholar), making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions from experiments using synthetic inhibitors.To overcome these drawbacks and to gain new insights into the pathophysiological roles of calpain, we focused our attention in the present study on calpastatin. This protein is composed of ∼700 amino acid residues and has been biochemically characterized as a potent stoichiometric inhibitor of both μ-calpain and m-calpain in an identical manner (27Goll D.E Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2329) Google Scholar). One molecule of calpastatin inhibits four molecules of calpain. The binding affinity of calpastatin to calpain is so high in the presence of calcium that the Ki values are extremely low (28Maki M. Takano E. Osawa T. Ooi T. Murachi T. Hatanaka M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10254-10261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Calpastatin is the only solely calpain-specific inhibitor that has ever been identified or synthesized to our knowledge. In addition, there is no molecular redundancy unlike the family of caspase inhibitors. Therefore, manipulation of calpastatin expression levels in vivo should have profound and specific effects on the proteolytic activity of both calpain isoforms and thus should shed light on the function of ubiquitous calpain as a whole regardless of calpain isoform redundancy, although there is the problem that a calpastatin deficiency might result in a lethal phenotype due to the overactivation of calpain. We therefore adopted two different strategies that involved developing calpastatin-deficient mice and calpastatin-overexpressing mice by reverse genetic methods and analyzed calpain activation and subsequent cellular events evoked by excitotoxicity. Surprisingly and luckily to us, genetic modulation of calpastatin expression levels did not cause any defect in the development, fertility, morphology, or life span of the mice under normal conditions, indicating that calpastatin is a negative regulator of calpain only under pathological conditions. This suggests that calpastatin knock-out and transgenic mice will serve as ideal models to examine whether and how calpain participates in various pathological processes. We also attempted to induce typical caspase-dependent apoptosis in adult mouse brains. Failure to achieve this due to a drastic postdevelopmental reduction of caspase-3 expression in brain tissues will also be discussed.MATERIALS AND METHODSTargeting of Calpastatin Gene—A genomic DNA clone of mouse calpastatin was isolated from the 129/Sv mouse strain taken from a bacterial artificial chromosome library as described previously (29Takano J. Watanabe M. Hitomi K. Maki M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The targeting vector was generated using the following DNA fragments: a 1.5-kb SphI fragment from intron 4 to exon 6, three tandem repeats of 250-bp SV40 early mRNA polyadenylation signals to terminate transcription (30Maxwell I.H. Harrison G.S. Wood W.M. Maxwell F. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 276-280PubMed Google Scholar), a 5.5-kb SphI-ScaI calpastatin gene fragment from intron 6 to intron 8, a 2.0-kb pgk-neo gene cassette (for positive selection), and a 1.0-kb SacI-NotI diphtheria toxin A fragment cassette from pMC1DT-A (for negative selection) (31Yagi T. Ikawa Y. Yoshida K. Shigetani Y. Takeda N. Mabuchi I. Yamamoto T. Aizawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9918-9922Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 32Gomi H. Yokoyama T. Fujimoto K. Ikeda T. Katoh A. Itoh T. Itohara S. Neuron. 1995; 14: 29-41Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Polyadenylation signals were placed in exon 6 to inhibit transcription of the calpain-inhibitory domains (30Maxwell I.H. Harrison G.S. Wood W.M. Maxwell F. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 276-280PubMed Google Scholar).E14 cells derived from strain 129/Ola mouse blastocysts were used as an embryonic stem cell line (33Hooper M. Hardy K. Handyside A. Hunter S. Monk M. Nature. 1987; 326: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). Cell culture and the targeting experiments were carried out as described previously (34Itohara S. Mombaerts P. Lafaille J. Iacomini J. Nelson A. Clarke A.R. Hooper M.L. Farr A. Tonegawa S. Cell. 1993; 72: 337-348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). In brief, the embryonic stem cells were electroporated with a Gene Pulser (800 V and 3 millifarads with a 0.4-cm electrode distance, Bio-Rad) using 30 μg of linearized targeting vector generated by NotI treatment. Clones selected with G418 at 150 μg/ml were screened and identified by hybridization with 5′ and 3′ external probes following BamHI digestion of genomic DNA (Fig. 1, A and B). Chimeric mice were generated as described previously by Bradley et al. (35Bradley A. Evans M. Kaufman M.H. Robertson E. Nature. 1984; 309: 255-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). Embryonic stem cells were microinjected into C57BL/6J blastocysts at 3.5 days postcoitum. After injection, the embryos were transferred into the uteri of pseudopregnant ICR mice. Mice heterozygous for the mutation were further intercrossed to obtain the chimera to C57BL/6J mice. The genotypes of the mice were determined by Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA prepared from their tails. The heterozygous mice were then backcrossed with C57BL/6 mice five to six times. To obtain homozygotes, the resulting heterozygotes were intercrossed. All mice were maintained by the Research Resource Center, RIKEN Brain Science Institute; all animal experiments were carried out according to the guidelines for animal experimentation in RIKEN.Calpastatin Transgenic Mice—The human calpastatin cDNA (36Asada K. Ishino Y. Shimada M. Shimojo T. Endo M. Kimizuka F. Kato I. Maki M. Hatanaka M. Murachi T. J. Enzyme Inhib. 1989; 3: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) was cloned into pNN265 from which the NotI fragment was subcloned into pMM403 containing the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-II α subunit promoter (37Mayford M. Wang J. Kandel E.R. O'Dell T.J. Cell. 1995; 81: 891-904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The SfiI-linearized DNA construct was microinjected into the pronucleus of C57BL/6Cr zygotes, which were transferred into foster females to create calpastatin transgenic founders. The genotype was determined by PCR with specific primers 5′-CATGAACCACAGACAGCTTGGTTGAC-3′ and 5′-GGAGGATTTGATATTCACCTGGCCCG-3′ that generate a 350-bp product. We confirmed that the transgene-derived human calpastatin was robustly expressed in hippocampus and neocortex. The details of the characterization of the mice are described elsewhere (38Higuchi M. Tomioka M Takano J. Shirotani K. Iwata N. Masumoto H. Maki M. Itohara S. Saido T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15229-15237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar).Northern Blotting and Reverse Transcription-PCR—Polyadenylated RNA was isolated from half-cortex brain samples using a Micro-Fast Track™ 2.0 kit (Invitrogen). Samples were electrophoresed in 1% formaldehyde agarose gels and transferred to nylon membranes. The membranes were probed with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled fragments of calpastatin and μ-calpain cDNAs. Specific cDNA probes encoding the inhibitory domain IV of mouse calpastatin and encoding domain IV of mouse μ-calpain, respectively, were used. The gels were stained with ethidium bromide, and membranes were reprobed with an actin cDNA (Sigma) to confirm the quantity of DNAs loaded.Reverse transcription (RT) 2The abbreviations used are: RT, reverse transcription; AIF, apoptosis-inducing factor; EndoG, endonuclease G; MAP2, microtubule-associated protein 2; ICAD, inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase; CAD, caspase-activated DNase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; tBid, truncated Bid. -PCR was carried out using polyadenylated RNA obtained as described above by methods described previously (29Takano J. Watanabe M. Hitomi K. Maki M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). PCR products were electrophoresed on 5% polyacrylamide gels. Gels were stained with ethidium bromide (1 μg/ml), and then DNA fragments were visualized under short wave (254 nm) UV illumination and photographed. For direct sequencing of the short DNA PCR products, DNA fragments were excised from the polyacrylamide gels under long wave (365 nm) UV illumination. Nucleotide sequences were determined with an automated fluorescent sequencer, ABI PRISM 3700 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), using a BigDye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Calpastatin Activity Assay—Cortical tissues (120 mg) from wild-type, calpastatin–/–, and calpastatin transgenic mice were homogenized in 2.5 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 5 mm EDTA and 0.1% Triton X-100 at 100 °C and then ultracentrifuged at 4 °C. The supernatants were subjected to ion-exchange chromatography using a DEAD-Toyopearl 650S (Tosoh) column (0.5 × 5 cm) with a linear gradient (0–0.5 m) of NaCl and then to calpastatin activity assays using 14C-labeled casein (100 μg; 4200 dpm) and bovine m-calpain (0.45 unit) as described previously (39Nagao S. Saido T.C. Akita Y. Tsuchiya T. Suzuki K. Kawashima S. J. Biochem. 1994; 115: 1178-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The activity to inhibit the m-calpain activity was defined as calpastatin activity.Subcellular Fractionation—Hippocampal tissues taken from the brains perfused with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were homogenized by 20 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer in 10 volumes of ice-cold buffer M (210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1× protease inhibitor mixture, EDTA-free (Roche Applied Science). Homogenates were centrifuged twice at 1500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove unlysed cells and nuclei. The supernatants were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Pellets were saved as the mitochondrial (high density membrane) fractions. The supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C and saved as the cytosolic (S100) fractions. The high density membrane fractions were lysed in buffer MX (buffer M with 1% Triton X-100) for immunoblotting. Protein concentrations were assayed with the Micro-BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard.Western Blotting—Protein samples denatured in SDS sample buffer (0.25 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 1% SDS, 25% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol) were subjected to SDS-PAGE in Tris-Tricine buffer and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Blotted membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) for 1 h and then incubated with primary antibodies for 16 h at 4 °C. After three washes in PBST, the membranes were incubated with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG, horseradish peroxidase-linked F(ab′)2 fragment (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h. Immunoreactive signals were detected with the ECL Advance Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) and quantified with a LuminoImager, LAS-3000, and Science Lab 2001 Image Gauge software (Fuji Photo Film) as described previously (40Iwata N.

An antibody specific to the calpain cleavage site of the amino-terminal 135-kDa fragment of αII-spectrin was produced according to Manya et al. (43Manya H. Inomata M. Fujimori T. Dohmae N. Sato Y.

The following antibodies were purchased as indicated: mouse monoclonal anti-microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) (clone AP20, Leinco Technology), αII-spectrin (clone AA6, Biohit), and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (clone 1D6, Invitrogen) antibodies; a goat polyclonal antibody to caspase-3 (K-17, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); and rabbit polyclonal antibodies to activated caspase-3 (Asp-175, Cell Signaling Technology), endonuclease G (EndoG) (AB3639, Chemicon), apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) (AB16501, Chemicon), and Bid (AR-52, Alexis).Intrahippocampal Injection—Stereotaxic administration of kainate into the hippocampus was performed as described previously (46Tomioka M. Shirotani K. Iwata N. Lee H.J. Yang F. Cole G.M. Seyama Y. Saido T.C. Mol. Brain. Res. 2002; 108: 18-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly adult male mice were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital, placed in a stereotaxic apparatus, and given a unilateral injection of 0 or 0.1 nmol of kainate in 0.3 μl of PBS into the hippocampal CA1 region using a 26S-gauge needle equipped with a 0.5-μl motorized syringe (Hamilton). The coordinates of the injection were anterior-posterior –2.3 mm, medial-lateral –1.5 mm, and dorsal-ventral –1.6 mm from the bregma. Two minutes after the needle insertion, kainate was injected at a constant flow rate of 0.05 μl/min. The needle remained in place for an additional 2 min to prevent reflux of fluid.Histochemistry—Twenty-four hours after injection of kainate or PBS, mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg of body weight) and perfused through the heart with ice-cold PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The brains were removed, postfixed in the same fixative overnight at 4 °C, and embedded in paraffin. Coronal sections (4 μm thick) were then dehydrated and stained with 1% Cresyl Violet to confirm the injection site. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) was carried out using an in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instruction. For quantification of cell death, we counted the number of TUNEL-positive cells and propidium iodide-stained nuclei in hippocampus. The immunohistochemical analysis was performed with the tyramide signal amplification method using a tyramide signal amplification fluorescence system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described previously (40Iwata N.

Quantification of immunoreactivity was carried out using MetaMorph (version 6.1) imaging software (Universal Imaging Corp.) as described by Iwata et al. (40Iwata N. Mizukami H. Shirotani K. Takaki Y.

A probability level of p < 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant in all of the studies.RESULTSFig. 1A summarizes the strategy used to generate calpastatin knock-out mice. The targeting vector carrying three tandem polyadenylation sequences was inserted into exon 6 to terminate transcription through homologous recombination (30Maxwell I.H. Harrison G.S. Wood W.M. Maxwell F. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 276-280PubMed Google Scholar) for the following reasons. (i) Every exon is composed of 3× multiple numbers of base pairs, making a frameshift strategy inadequate (29Takano J. Watanabe M. Hitomi K. Maki M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). (ii) The calpastatin gene possesses multiple sites for initiation and termination of transcription (48De Tullio R. Sparatore B. Salamino F. Melloni E. Pontremoli S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). (iii) A neighboring adipocyte-derived leucine aminopeptidase gene overlaps with part of the calpastatin gene corresponding to the fourth inhibitory domain (49Hattori A. Matsumoto K. Mizutani S. Tsujimoto M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 130: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). (iv) The gene region encoding calpain-inhibitory domains starts at exon 9 (29Takano J. Watanabe M. Hitomi K. Maki M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Southern blot analyses of BamHI-digested genomic DNA using 5′ and 3′ probes designated in Fig. 1A indicate that the gene targeting was successfully achieved as intended (Fig. 1B). We then performed Northern blotting, Western blotting, RT-PCR, and immunohistochemistry to confirm the amounts of calpastatin gene products in heterozygous (+/–) and homozygous (–/–) mice as compared with wild-type mice (+/+) (Fig. 1, C–F). The amount of calpastatin mRNA and corresponding anti-calpastatin antibody-immunoreactive protein decreased in a gene dose-dependent manner, whereas the levels of μ-calpain, m-calpain, and αII-spectrin (fodrin) remained unchanged (Fig. 1, C and D).Calpastatin appeared as doublet bands in Western blotting due to the presence of distinct initiation sites for transcription in the calpastatin gene (50Cong M. Thompson V.F. Goll D.E. Antin P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 660-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).

This study investigates the molecular anti-inflammatory mechanisms of SB203580, an inhibitor of the mitogen-activated protein kinase p38. The murine trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis was used as an established model of human Crohn disease. Here we show that SB203580 improved the clinical condition, reduced intestinal inflammation, and suppressed mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines elevated upon induction of colitis. Besides p38 kinase activity, the “classical” IκB-dependent NF-κB pathway was strongly up-regulated during colitis induction, whereas the “alternative” was not. SB203580 treatment resulted in a drastic down-regulation of p38 and NF-κB activity. The molecular analysis of NF-κB activation revealed that Rip-like interacting caspase-like apoptosis-regulatory protein kinase (RICK), a key component of a pathway leading to NF-κB induction, is also strongly inhibited by SB203580. In contrast, SB203580 had no effect on the colitis-induced activation of other potential NF-κB-activating kinases such as protein kinase Cθ (PKCθ), mixed lineage kinase 3, and the oncogene product Cot/TPL2. Thus, the inhibitory effect of SB203580 on NF-κB activation is to a large extent mediated by RICK inhibition. RICK is the effector kinase of the intracellular receptor of bacterial peptidoglycan NOD. Because bacterial products are suggested to be the key pathogenic agents triggering IBD, inhibition of the NOD/RICK pathway may serve as a novel target of future therapies in human IBD. Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is the main target of anti-inflammatory therapies in human chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), Crohn disease, and ulcerative colitis. This study investigates the molecular anti-inflammatory mechanisms of SB203580, an inhibitor of the mitogen-activated protein kinase p38. The murine trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis was used as an established model of human Crohn disease. Here we show that SB203580 improved the clinical condition, reduced intestinal inflammation, and suppressed mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines elevated upon induction of colitis.

Crohn disease is characterized by chronic intestinal inflammation frequently relapsing with clinical manifestations including diarrhea, blood in the stool, abdominal pain, and weight loss. The etiology of Crohn disease is so far unknown (1Podolsky D.K. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 347: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (3184) Google Scholar) but epidemiological and linkage studies suggest a genetic predisposition of the patient and the involvement of environmental factors (1Podolsky D.K.

Furthermore, several observations strongly implicate a pathogenic role of the intestinal flora during the initiation process of the immunological dysregulation (3Swidsinski A. Ladhoff A.

At present, treatment of Crohn disease is limited to 5-aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and immunosuppressants such as azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine (1Podolsky D.K. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 347: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (3184) Google Scholar). Because of the lack of specific and curative treatments with limited toxicity or side effects, there is still a great demand for developing effective therapeutic approaches.

Lin A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2470) Google Scholar), and is also the key transcription factor for pro-inflammatory responses in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (7Schreiber S. Nikolaus S. Hampe J. Gut. 1998; 42: 477-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). The NF-κB system consists of homo- or heterodimers that are retained in the cytoplasm upon association with an inhibitory IκB protein (8Dixit V. Mak T.W. Cell. 2002; 111: 615-619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In the “classical” pathway of NF-κB activation, the IκB kinase complex (IKK) is activated and leads to phosphorylation and polyubiquitination of IκB thereby marking this NF-κB inhibitor for degradation in the 26 S proteasome. Protein kinase Cθ (PKCθ) and the MAP3K Cot/TPL2 and mixed lineage kinase 3 (MLK3) are important activators of the IKK complex and therefore of NF-κB (9Khoshnan A. Bae D. Tindell C. Nel A. J.

The recently described “alternative” activation pathway of NF-κB involves the processing of p100 to p52 (12Senftleben U. Cao Y. Xiao G. Greten F.R. Krahn G. Bonizzi G. Chen Y. Hu Y. Fong A. Sun S.C.

Lesage S. Cezard J.P. Belaiche J. Almer S. Tysk C. O'Morain C.A. Gassull M. Gassull M. Binder V. Finkel Y. Cortot A. Modigliani R. Laurent-Puig P. Gower-Rousseau C. Macry J. Colombel J.F. Sahbatou M.

NOD proteins are intracellular receptors for bacterial peptidoglycan and play a pivotal role in the innate immune system (17Inohara N. Ogura Y. Nunez G. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2002; 5: 76-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that NOD-mediated signal transduction pathways may serve as an initiation point for a variety of inflammatory responses in bacterial triggered “autoimmune” diseases. In fact, genome-wide screens have identified NOD2/caspase-activation recruitment domains (CARD15) as the first susceptibility gene for Crohn disease (15Hugot J.P. Chamaillard M. Zouali H. Lesage S. Cezard J.P. Belaiche J. Almer S. Tysk C. O'Morain C.A. Gassull M. Gassull M. Binder V. Finkel Y. Cortot A. Modigliani R. Laurent-Puig P. Gower-Rousseau C. Macry J. Colombel J.F. Sahbatou M. Thomas G.

Brant S.R. Bayless T.M. Kirschner B.S. Hanauer S.B. Nunez G. Cho J.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 603-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (4206) Google Scholar). The pathogenic role of mutations within the NOD2 gene in patients with Crohn disease is supported by functional studies showing an inappropriate response to bacterial components with respect to NF-κB activation within the innate immune system (16Ogura Y. Bonen D.K. Inohara N. Nicolae D.L. Chen F.F. Ramos R. Britton H. Moran T. Karaliuskas R. Duerr R.H. Achkar J.P. Brant S.R. Bayless T.M. Kirschner B.S. Hanauer S.B. Nunez G. Cho J.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 603-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (4206) Google Scholar). Those NOD2 mutations (i.e. the 3020InsC mutant) lead to a truncated NOD2 protein because of a frameshift. This results in the inability to recognize bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an abolished NF-κB activation (16Ogura Y. Bonen D.K. Inohara N. Nicolae D.L. Chen F.F. Ramos R. Britton H. Moran T. Karaliuskas R. Duerr R.H. Achkar J.P. Brant S.R. Bayless T.M. Kirschner B.S. Hanauer S.B. Nunez G. Cho J.H.

Furthermore, a direct link has been shown between NOD signaling and NF-κB activation (19Hisamatsu T. Suzuki M. Reinecker H.C. Nadeau W.J. McCormick B.A. Podolsky D.K. Gastroenterology. 2003; 124: 993-1000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Recently, DLG5 as a scaffolding protein involved in the maintenance of epithelial integrity has been mapped as another candidate susceptibility gene for Crohn disease. This function of DLG5 may be another indication for the role of intestinal flora in IBD, because a shredded epithelial bowel layer is a potential prerequisite for bacterial triggered disease induction (20Stoll M. Corneliussen B. Costello C.M. Waetzig G.H. Mellgard B. Koch W.A. Rosenstiel P. Albrecht M. Croucher P.J. Seegert D. Nikolaus S. Hampe J. Lengauer T. Pierrou S. Foelsch U.R. Mathew C.G. Lagerstrom-Fermer M. Schreiber S. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 476-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 is another crucial mediator of inflammation (21Waetzig G.H. Seegert D. Rosenstiel P. Nikolaus S. Schreiber S. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5342-5351Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 22Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4420) Google Scholar, 23Zhao M. New L. Kravchenko V.V.

Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2897) Google Scholar). p38 directly controls the activity of several transcription factors relevant to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are up-regulated in IBD. Furthermore, p38 can modulate a number of different steps in the inflammatory cascade including the transcriptional regulation of the genes encoding the key cytokines of IBD TNF-α, IL-1, and interferon γ in monocytes and lymphocytes, the degranulation of neutrophils, and the expression of receptors essential for neutrophil activation and chemotaxis like the CXC receptors (25Beyaert R.

Immunology. 2003; 108: 502-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The expression of this receptor is strongly inhibited by p38 MAPK inhibitors (28van den Blink B. Branger J. Weijer S. Gupta A. van Deventer S.J. Peppelenbosch M.P. van der Poll T. J. Clin. Immunol. 2004; 24: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Additionally, upstream kinases of p38 like the MAPK kinase MKK3 as well as downstream substrates such as the activator of transcription factor 2 (ATF-2) or MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 are by itself potent regulators of genes for Th1-derived cytokines like TNF-α, which are all up-regulated in Crohn disease (26Rincon M.

In a murine knock-out model, elimination of MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 led to a dramatic reduction of TNF-α in response to lipopolysaccharide (32Kotlyarov A. Yannoni Y. Fritz S. Laass K.

Because the p38 gene as well as other candidate genes has been localized to the IBD susceptibility region 3, much attention has been focused on p38 as a key kinase maintaining intestinal inflammation in IBD (21Waetzig G.H. Seegert D. Rosenstiel P. Nikolaus S. Schreiber S. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5342-5351Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 33Hampe J. Shaw S.H. Saiz R. Leysens N. Lantermann A. Mascheretti S.

A recent pilot study investigating the efficiency of the combined p38 and JNK inhibitor CNI-1493 in patients with Crohn disease demonstrated a significant clinical improvement in moderate to severe active disease (35Hommes D. van den Blink B.

In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 on signal transduction pathways involving NF-κB and p38 in a murine model of Crohn disease. We show that SB203580 has highly beneficial anti-inflammatory effects resulting in a significant suppression of the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as the induction of p38 and the classical but not the alternative NF-κB activation pathway. The inhibition of NF-κB by SB203580 is probably mediated by the blocked NOD/RICK pathway. Thus, dual inhibition of p38 and NOD/RICK may lead to new treatment options with very limited side effects in chronic inflammatory conditions like human IBD. Animals and Experimental Design—Female BALB/c mice (6–8 weeks old) ∼19–22 g in body weight were obtained from Harlan-Winkelmann (Borchen, Germany) and given ad libitum access to water and standard rodent food before and during the study. Mice were weighted and randomized into groups of 7. Clinical assessments and histological scoring of colitis were performed in a blinded fashion. Experiments were performed after ≥3 days following arrival of the animals. To induce colitis, 0.1 ml of a 2.5% (w/v) TNBS solution in 50% ethanol (Sigma) was slowly administered into the colon of lightly anesthetized mice via a thin catheter (PE-50, BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany) attached to a 0.5-ml syringe (37Elson C.O. Sartor R.B. Tennyson G.S. Riddell R.H. Gastroenterology. 1995; 109: 1344-1367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar). The catheter tip was inserted 5–6 cm proximal to the anal verge, and the mouse was held in a vertical position for 1 min after instillation. Using this procedure, >95% of the mice retained the TNBS-ethanol enema. However, if an animal quickly (i.e. <10 min) excluded this solution, it was omitted from the remainder of the study. Treatment with 5 μmol of SB203508/kg of body weight in 200 μl of 0.9% NaCl solution was given intraperitoneally twice daily beginning 12 h after TNBS administration and continuing until death. For control experiments, bowel tissue was analyzed from: 1) completely untreated animals, 2) animals receiving vehicle injections (3% Me2SO) without rectal challenge, or 3) mice receiving SB203580 (Calbiochem, Schwalbach, Germany) injections in the same manner but treated with 0.9% saline intracolonically instead of TNBS. Macroscopic Assessment and Histological Analysis of Colitis—Daily weight, physical condition, stool consistency, and water/food consumption were determined. Animals were sacrificed by CO2 inhalation at days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 10 (n = 7 in each group per day). After sacrifice, the colon was quickly removed, opened longitudinally, and gently cleared of stool. Macroscopic assessment of the disease activity was scored according to a previously established scoring system (38Wallace J.L. Keenan C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: G527-G534PubMed Google Scholar) as follows: 0: no ulcer, no inflammation; 1: no ulcer, local hyperemia; 2: ulceration without hyperemia; 3: ulceration and inflammation at one site only; 4: two or more sites of ulceration and inflammation; and 5: ulceration extending more than 2 cm. Subsequently, samples of colonic tissue were either fixed in 4% buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, and 4-μm thick serial step sections were stained with hematoxylineosin (HE) or snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen in OCT embedding medium and stored at –80 °C until usage. Microscopic scoring was performed according to Elson et al. (39Elson C.O. Beagley K.W. Sharmanov A.T. Fujihashi K. Kiyono H. Tennyson G.S. Cong Y. Black C.A. Ridwan B.W. McGhee J.R. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2174-2185PubMed Google Scholar). Blood Sampling—Blood (∼0.4 ml) was drawn intracardially and mixed with 50 μl of 0.5 m EDTA. Blood samples were subjected to differential blood cell count analysis. Extraction of Total RNA—A gut specimen obtained 5 cm proximal to the anus was used for extraction of total RNA using a recently described method (40Wex T. Treiber G. Lendeckel U. Malfertheiner P. Clin. Chem. Lab. Med. 2003; 41: 1033-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For each animal, 1 μg of total RNA was transcribed into cDNA. Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed in an iCycler (Bio-Rad). The 30-μl reaction mixture consisted of 15 μl of HotStarTaq™ Master Mix, 1.2 μl of the reverse transcriptase reaction, 0.3 μl of SYBR Green I (1:10000; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and 0.5 μm of the specific primers (TIB Molbiol, Berlin, Germany). Initial denaturation and activation of Taq polymerase at 95 °C for 15 min was followed by 40 cycles consisting of (i) denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, (ii) annealing at 60 °C for 45 s for β-actin, TNF-α, interferon γ, IL-2, IL-12p35, IL-18, and at 55 °C for IL-10, and (iii) elongation at 72 °C for 30 s. The fluorescence intensity of the double strand-specific SYBR Green I, reflecting the amount of actually formed PCR product, was read real-time at the end of each elongation step. Specific initial template mRNA amounts were calculated by determining the time point of a standard curve (artificial units). β-Actin mRNA amounts were used to normalize the cDNA contents of the different samples. In addition, an aliquot of the PCR mixture was separated on a 1.8% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. The following primers were used for the reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis: β-actin: forward primer, TGGAATCCTGTGGCATCCATGAAAC and reverse primer, TAAAACGCAGCTCAGTAACAGTCCG; TNF-α: forward primer, GGCAGGTCTACTTTGGAGTCATTGC and reverse primer, ACATTCGAGGCTCCAGTGAATTCGG; interferon γ: forward primer, AGCGGCTGACTGAACTCAGATTGTAG and reverse primer, GTCACAGTTTTCAGCTGTATAGGG; IL-2: forward primer, TGATGGACCTACAGGAGCTCCTGAG and reverse primer: GAGTCAAATCCAGAACATGCCGCAG; IL-10: forward primer, ACCTGGTAGAAGTGATGCCCCAGGCA and reverse primer, CTATGCAGTTGATGAAGATGTCAAA; IL-12p35: forward primer, GCAAGAGACACAGTCCTGGG and reverse primer, TGCATCAGCTCATCGATGGC; IL-18: forward primer, GCAAGCTTCGCTCTTCTGTCTACTGAACTTCGG and reverse primer: GCTCTAGAATGAGATAGCAAATCGGCTGACGG. Protein Extraction from Mice Gut—For total protein preparation, gut specimens obtained 3–4 cm proximal from the anus were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C until extraction of protein. Specimens were homogenized in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma), 0.5% Triton X-100, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 m NaCl, 10 mm K2HPO4, 0.5% deoxycholic acid (Sigma), 20 mm NaF, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm glycerol 2-phosphate (Sigma), 1 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The lysate was centrifuged (14,000 × g at 4 °C) for 15 min and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. Total protein content was analyzed using the Advanced™ protein assay (Tebu, Offenbach, Germany). Finally, samples were aliquoted and stored at –80 °C until usage. For cellular subfractionation of proteins, tissue was carefully homogenized so that many viable single cells were obtained and re-suspended in 1 ml of ice-cold TBS buffer, centrifuged (10 min, 800 × g at 4 °C), and washed in buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, protease inhibitor mixture). After centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in 0.2 ml of buffer A and 2 μl of 12.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 was added, briefly incubated on ice, and centrifuged (10 min, 800 × g at 4 °C). The supernatant was used for cytoplasmic analyses. The pellet was washed again in buffer A. After centrifugation, pellets were resuspended in 40 μl of buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 400 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, protease inhibitor mixture) and incubated on a shaker for 1 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, samples were centrifuged (10 min, 13,000 × g at 4 °C), the supernatant (nuclear protein extract) was transferred to liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C until usage. Protein concentration was measured as previously described prior to storage. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—Proteins were assayed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described previously (41Ogura Y.

Immunoblots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The following antibodies were used to detect the respective proteins: p38 and p65 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), phospho-IKKα, phospho-MLK3, phospho-Cot/TPL2, phospho-PKCθ (Cell Signaling, Frankfurt, Germany), phospho-p38 (BIOSOURCE, Solingen, Germany), p52 and p100 (Upstate/Biomol, Hamburg, Germany), and RICK (Abcam, Cambridge, MA). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—To identify the cellular source of activated p38, immunohistochemical studies were performed using gut specimens obtained 3–4 cm proximal to the anus. Cryosections were fixed in acetone for immunofluorescence microscopy. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline, nonspecific binding was blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h prior to the addition of 10 μg/ml phospho-p38 antibody, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in a humidified chamber. After repeated washings in phosphate-buffered saline, the sections were incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody for 1 h. The sections were washed again in phosphate-buffered saline and mounted in Vectashield media (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA). In Vitro Kinase Assays—RICK and p38 activity were assayed in an in vitro kinase activity using 0.2 mg of protein lysate and incubated with anti-RICK or anti-p38 (1 μg/sample) by permanent shaking for 3 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were recovered with 50 μl of a 50% protein A-Sepharose bead suspension (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated for 90 min at 4 °C in a permanent shaker, respectively. Subsequently, immunoprecipitates were washed six times with lysis buffer and incubated with 1.5 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP) for the RICK assay or 1.5 μg of ATF-2 for the p38 assay in 20 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 2 mm EGTA, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0,1% Triton X-100, 0.25 mm ATP) for 30 min at 30 °C. Samples were suspended in loading buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. ATF-2 and phospho-ATF-2 antibody were obtained from Cell Signaling (Frankfurt, Germany). Dephosphorylated MBP and phospho-MBP antibody were purchased from Upstate/Biomol. To prove a direct suppression of RICK activity by SB203580, the cell extract was incubated with SB203580 30 min prior to the in vitro kinase assay. Statistical Analysis—The data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Significance of differences between treatment groups and controls were assessed by analysis of variance and a Bonferroni-Dunn procedure as a post-hoc test. Statistical significance of the difference between drug-treated and vehicle-treated groups was established at a probability of p < 0.05.

https://openalex.org/W2079288512,"Until now, the analysis of burrowing mechanics has neglected the mechanical properties of impeding, muddy, cohesive sediments, which behave like elastic solids. Here we show that burrowers can progress through such sediments by using a mechanically efficient, previously unsuspected mechanism--crack propagation--in which an alternating 'anchor' system of burrowing serves as a wedge to extend the crack-shaped burrow. The force required to propagate cracks through sediment in this way is relatively small: we find that the force exerted by the annelid worm Nereis virens in making and moving into such a burrow amounts to less than one-tenth of the force it needs to use against rigid aquarium walls."
https://openalex.org/W2009525986,"Emerging evidence documents a key function for the forkhead transcription factor FoxO1 in cellular metabolism. Here, we investigate the role of FoxO1 in the regulation of fatty acid (FA) metabolism in muscle cells. C2C12 cells expressing an inducible construct with either wild type FoxO1 or a mutant form (FoxO1/TSS) refractory to the protein kinase B inhibitory effects were generated. FoxO1 activation after myotube formation altered the expression of several genes of FA metabolism. Acyl-CoA oxidase and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ mRNA levels increased 2.2-fold and 1.4-fold, respectively, whereas mRNA for acetyl-CoA carboxylase decreased by 50%. Membrane uptake of oleate increased 3-fold, and oleate oxidation increased 2-fold. Cellular triglyceride content was also increased. The enhanced FA utilization induced by FoxO1 was mediated by a severalfold increase in plasma membrane level of the fatty acid translocase FAT/CD36 and eliminated by cell treatment with the CD36 inhibitor sulfo-N-succinimidyl-oleate. We conclude that FoxO1 activation induces coordinate increases in FA uptake and oxidation and that these effects are mediated, at least in part, by membrane enrichment in CD36. The data suggest that FoxO1 contributes to preparing the muscle cell for the increased reliance on FA metabolism that is characteristic of fasting. Dysregulation of FoxO1 in muscle could contribute to intramuscular lipid accumulation and insulin resistance by maintaining activation of FA uptake.

As circulating levels of glucose and insulin fall, the muscle cell increases its reliance on FA oxidation. The decline in muscle cell glucose utilization that is associated with fasting allows glucose sparing because glycogen body stores are limited and can be depleted in a short period of time. In contrast to glycogen, the amount of stored fat is substantial, and FA released by adipocytes is a more sustainable substrate. As a result, the ability of muscle cells to accomplish the substrate shift from glucose to FA is a physiologically important adaptation for surviving caloric restriction. FoxO1 is a member of the evolutionarily conserved FoxO subfamily of forkhead transcription factors (1.Kaestner K.H. Knochel W. Martinez D.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 142-146PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Birkenkamp K.U. Coffer P.J. Biochem. Soc.

FoxO1 is expressed in tissues involved in energy metabolism such as liver, muscle, and adipose tissue, where its function is inhibited by insulin and insulin-like growth factor I (5.Farmer S.R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 6-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of three highly conserved protein kinase B sites, corresponding to Thr24, Ser256, and Ser319 in human FoxO1, suppresses transactivation and promotes nuclear exclusion of FoxO proteins by multiple mechanisms (6.Zhao X. Gan L. Pan H. Kan D. Majeski M. Adam S.A. Unterman T.G. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 839-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In muscle, FoxO1 expression is increased with fasting (7.Furuyama T. Kitayama K. Yamashita H. Mori N. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), which induces the key regulatory enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) 4 (8.Furuyama T. Yamashita H. Kitayama K. Higami Y. Shimokawa I. Mori N. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2002; 59: 331-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), a FoxO1 target gene. PDK4 phosphorylates and inactivates pyruvate dehydrogenase, which inhibits oxidation of glucose in muscle (9.Holness M.J. Sugden M.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 1143-1151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), sparing it for glucose-dependent tissues including brain. Recently, FoxO1 has also been shown to promote protein turnover through proteasomal mechanisms in response to glucocorticoids and during fasting (10.Sandri M. Sandri C. Gilbert A. Skurk C.

Muscle FA utilization, although sensitive to FA supply, is not simply a function of blood FA levels and has been shown to be regulated at the tissue level (11.Coburn C.T. Knapp Jr., F.F. Febbraio M.

Recent studies with mice overexpressing a dominant negative insulin-like growth factor I receptor in muscle documented low FA oxidation levels in this tissue that were reversed by muscle-targeted overexpression of CD36 (14.Heron-Milhavet L.

Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 4667-4676Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) This suggested that the insulin-like growth factor I pathway, possibly via its regulation of FoxO protein activation, modulates FA metabolism. Here, we examined the possibility that the increased expression and function of FoxO1 that occur with fasting may contribute to the adaptive response of FA metabolism in muscle. We measured the effect of FoxO1 activation on FA uptake and oxidation by C2C12 myotubes. To avoid confounding effects of FoxO on cell differentiation (15.Hribal M.L. Nakae J. Kitamura T. Shutter J.R. Accili D. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), we used TAM-inducible wild type and mutated forms of FoxO1, which were activated after myotube formation was complete. Our results indicate that FoxO1 increases FA uptake and oxidation in muscle cells by increasing membrane CD36 content and by regulating expression of key genes of FA utilization. Materials—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal bovine serum, antibiotics, and other cell culture products were from Invitrogen and Roche Applied Science. [9,10(n)-3H]oleate, [1-14C]oleate, and d-[U-14C]glucose were from ICN Biochemicals (Costa Mesa, CA). FoxO1 (FKHR) antibody was from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). CD36 antibody was from Cascade Biosciences (Winchester, MA), and the estrogen receptor (ER) antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. 4-Hydroxytamoxifen was obtained from Sigma. Immobilon-P membranes used for Western blots were from Millipore. Primers for quantitative PCR were from Invitrogen. Fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) was obtained from Sigma and used for all experiments. C2C12 Cells with Stable Expression of FoxO1—The constitutively active FoxO1/TSS was generated by site-directed mutagenesis in pAlter.Max (Promega), and the substitution of Thr24, Ser256, and Ser319 by alanines was verified by dideoxy sequencing, as previously reported (16.Cichy S.B. Uddin S. Danilkovich A. Guo S. Klippel A. Unterman T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6482-6487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). To create a DNA binding-defective protein, His215 was replaced by an arginine in the FoxO1/TSS construct (FoxO1/H215). A BamHI cutting site was created at the C-terminal end for cloning in-frame with the modified ligand-binding domain of the estrogen receptor in the pBABE retroviral vector containing the puromycin selection marker (provided by Dr. Nissim Hay, University of Illinois at Chicago). The ligand-binding domain of the estrogen receptor in this vector has been mutated such that it specifically responds to TAM but not to endogenous estrogens (17.Littlewood T.D. Hancock D.C. Danielian P.S. Parker M.G. Evan G.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1686-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Retroviruses were produced by transfecting ecotropic Pheonix packaging cells with pBABE plasmids expressing FoxO1-ER, FoxO1/TSS-ER, FoxO1/H215, or the empty pBABE vector. After 8 h, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated for 48 h in fresh medium. Medium containing the recombinant virus was recovered and filtered (0.45-μm Nalgene filters) prior to infection of C2C12 myoblasts at 50% confluence in the presence of 10 μg/ml Polybrene. After an overnight incubation, cells were washed with PBS and fed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 3.5 mg/ml puromycin for selection. Puromycin-resistant cells were pooled and used for experiments. Transcriptional activity of FoxO proteins was measured using the TK81.IRS3 reporter gene construct containing three copies of an insulin response sequence derived from the insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 promoter, upstream of the 81-bp thymidine kinase minimal promoter upstream of the firefly luciferase cDNA, as previously described (18.Guo S. Rena G. Cichy S. He X. Cohen P. Unterman T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17184-17192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—C2C12 myoblasts were maintained in low-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 200 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. At 90% confluence, cells were washed with warm PBS, and myotube differentiation was induced by switching the cells to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium complemented with 1% horse serum, 200 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were washed with PBS, and media were changed daily. Polynucleated myotubes were obtained within 4 days. At day 4, FoxO1-ER fusion proteins were activated for the indicated times by addition of 1 μm 4-hydroxytamoxifen to the culture medium. Western Blot Analysis—To determine expression of FoxO1 proteins in nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments, myotubes were homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm NaF) and fractionated by centrifugation for 5 min at 16,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant containing the cytoplasm and the pellet containing plasma membrane and nuclei were collected, and protein content was determined using a Bio-Rad kit. To examine membrane CD36 protein expression, myotubes were homogenized (Dounce homogenizer, 50 strokes) in 1 ml of buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. The homogenate was centrifuged (1200 × g, 10 min), and the supernatant was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min. The resuspended pellet was layered on a 40% sucrose cushion and centrifuged (100,000 × g, 1 h, 4 °C). The top of the cushion was carefully collected and centrifuged for 30 min (30,000 × g, 4 °C), and the pellet containing the plasma membrane was resuspended in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm LiCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.05% SDS, and 0.02% sodium azide. For Western blotting, proteins (40 μg) were separated on a 4–20% polyacrylamide-reduced gradient gel and electroblotted onto Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Blots were blocked with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline for 60 min at room temperature and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with antibodies against ER, FoxO1 (1:1000), or CD36 (1:2000) in Tris-buffered saline and 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) containing 5% milk. Blots were washed in TBST and incubated with goat anti-rabbit (for FoxO1) or goat anti-mouse (for CD36) horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:30,000) for 30 min at room temperature. Membranes were washed in TBST and antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by chemiluminescence using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). Glucose Uptake—Myotubes were washed three times with 2 ml of Krebs-Ringer solution buffered with HEPES (KRH). Uptake was assayed at room temperature as previously described (19.Bastie C.C. Hajri T. Drover V.A. Grimaldi P.A. Abumrad N.A. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 2209-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Briefly, it was started by addition of 2 ml of transport buffer (0.5 μCi/ml 2-deoxy-d-[1,2-3H]glucose in KRH with 5 mm glucose) with 4-hydroxytamoxifen as indicated. Uptake was stopped by medium aspiration and washing three times with ice-cold KRH. Cells were lysed (30 min) in 1 ml of 0.1 N NaOH before aliquots were taken for scintillation counting (Beckman LS3801) and protein measurement using a Bio-Rad kit. Glycogen Synthesis—Myotubes were incubated for 2 h in KRH buffer with 5 mm glucose and d-[U-14C]glucose (1 μCi/assay) and the indicated additions. Glycogen formation was assayed as described previously (19.Bastie C.C. Hajri T. Drover V.A. Grimaldi P.A. Abumrad N.A. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 2209-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Washed cells were scraped into 300 μl of 1 m KOH. Extracts were heated (100 °C, 10 min), and an aliquot was taken for protein assays. Saturated Na2SO4 (40 μl) was added, and glycogen was precipitated at -70 °C (30 min) with 700 μl of ice-cold acetone. Pellets (20,000 × g, 30 min) were acetone-washed, centrifuged, and redissolved in 100 μl of water before adding scintillant for counting. Fatty Acid Uptake—Myotubes were washed three times with 2 ml of KRH, pH 7.4, 0.1% BSA and once with 2 ml of KRH. Uptake was performed at room temperature for the indicated times (19.Bastie C.C. Hajri T. Drover V.A. Grimaldi P.A. Abumrad N.A. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 2209-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It was started by addition of 2 ml of transport buffer, KRH containing 5 mm glucose and 80 μm [3H]oleate bound to BSA (0.5 μCi/ml; FA:BSA = 2). It was stopped by medium aspiration and washing with ice-cold KRH/0.5% BSA. Cells were lysed in 1 ml of 0.1 N NaOH for 30 min, and aliquots were taken for scintillation counting and protein determination. Fatty Acid Oxidation—FA oxidation assays were performed as described previously (19.Bastie C.C. Hajri T. Drover V.A. Grimaldi P.A. Abumrad N.A. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 2209-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 20.Muoio D.M. Seefeld K. Witters L.A. Coleman R.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed three times with KRH containing 40 μm BSA and then incubated for 2 h in 1 ml of the same buffer containing [14C]oleate (1 μCi/80 μm) with/without 1 μm 4-hydroxytamoxifen. CO2 trapping was performed overnight at 30 °C with gentle shaking. The acid-soluble metabolic (ASM) fraction was evaluated after a perchloric acid precipitation of the medium. Oxidation rates (CO2 + ASM) were expressed as nmol/mg protein/h or as indicated. FA Partitioning and Triglyceride Content—Myotubes pre-incubated for 12 h in the presence or absence of 1 μm TAM were washed and exposed for 2 h to fresh medium (with or without TAM) containing [14C]oleate (1 μCi/80 μm). Cells were then washed at 4 °C (three washes with PBS/0.5%BSA, followed by two washes with buffer lacking BSA) and scraped in 500 μl of PBS. Aliquots were taken for Folch extraction and protein assays. Folch extracts were analyzed by TLC on Silica Gel 60A plates (Whatman, Clifton, NJ) using a two solvent system. The first solvent (diethyl ether:benzene:ethanol:acetic acid, 40:50:2:0.2) was run up to three-fourths of the plate. Plates were air dried, heated briefly to remove traces of acetic acid, and run in the second solvent (diethyl ether:hexane, 6:94) to 1 cm from the top. Plates were again dried at 60 °C for 30 min. Spots corresponding to TG, identified by standards run simultaneously and visualized by iodine vapors, were scraped and counted. For triglyceride content, Folch extracts were evaporated and redissolved in isopropanol. TG content was measured using a triglyceride assay kit (GPO-Trinder) from Sigma. Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was prepared using the High-Pure RNA Isolation kit (Roche Diagnostics). Real-time quantitative PCR was performed as described previously (21.Agellon L.B. Drover V.A. Cheema S.K. Gbaguidi G.F. Walsh A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20131-20134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, complementary DNA was synthesized from 10 μg of total RNA with Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR was performed in a GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in the presence of SYBR Green I (Sigma-Aldrich) with Taq DNA polymerase (Roche Diagnostics). The annealing temperature of each oligonucleotide pair (Table I) was optimized using a T-Gradient thermal cycler (Biometra, Göttingen, Germany) to ensure synthesis of only one DNA product. Amplicon mass at the cycle threshold was determined by comparing fluorescence to a standard curve (log-linear over 8 orders of magnitude) generated simultaneously for each run. Post-run melting curve analysis was performed to confirm amplicon identity. Statistics—Results are expressed as mean ± S.D. Differences between cells or treatments were tested for statistical significance using the unpaired Student's t test. C2C12 Cells Expressing FoxO1—To assess the role of FoxO1 in regulating FA metabolism in muscle cells, C2C12 myocytes stably expressing the inducible FoxO1 fusion proteins FoxO1-ER and the mutant FoxO1/TSS-ER were generated (Fig. 1A). Unlike its wild type counterpart, the FoxO1/TSS-ER protein is refractory to negative regulation by protein kinase B because the three protein kinase B phosphorylation sites (Thr24, Ser256, and Ser319) that promote nuclear exclusion have been mutated. Fig. 1A shows the expression levels achieved for both fusion proteins in C2C12 cells. Using an antibody against FoxO, we determined in separate experiments that levels of exogenously expressed FoxO1 were comparable to those of endogenous FoxO for FoxO1/TSS or about 2-fold higher for FoxO1 (data not shown). To confirm the responsiveness of the fusion proteins to tamoxifen, their distribution was examined in the presence or absence of tamoxifen. When immunoblotted with an ER-specific antibody, ∼100-kDa bands corresponding to FoxO1-ER and FoxO1/TSS-ER were detected in the cytoplasmic fractions (Fig. 1B). Upon addition of TAM, both proteins were detected in the nuclear fraction, reflecting the ability of TAM to induce nuclear localization. Of note, a small residual level of FoxO1-ER remains cytoplasmic after treatment with TAM, perhaps reflecting the antagonistic effect of basal protein kinase B activity and phosphorylation of FoxO1-ER on localization. In contrast, the effect of TAM on FoxO1/TSS-ER localization is complete. In separate studies using transient transfections, we documented that the effects of TAM were specific for FoxO-ER fusion proteins and did not alter the function of wild type FoxO1 (data not shown). Fig. 1C shows that TAM treatment is associated with transcriptional activation by both FoxO1-ER and FoxO1/TSS-ER and consistent with changes in the cellular distribution of these proteins. In addition, as shown, TAM treatment did not have any effect on the activity of endogenous FoxO proteins (control bars) in C2C12 cells. The tight regulation and activation of both fusion proteins (Fig. 1, B and C) by TAM make it possible to study how acute modulation of FoxO1 function impacts FA metabolism. Acute activation of FoxO1 subsequent to myotube formation was not associated with obvious changes in the terminal differentiation status of C2C12 cells examined microscopically. In line with this, as shown in Fig. 1D, activation of FoxO1-ER or FoxO1/TSS-ER did not alter expression of the differentiation markers MyoD and myogenin in myotubes. This indicated that activation of FoxO1 after myotube formation was completed could be used to examine effects on metabolism without confounding effects on cell differentiation. Glucose Metabolism Is Only Modestly Altered in C2C12 Cells Expressing FoxO1—FoxO1 has been implicated in the regulation of glucose metabolism, especially in the liver (3.Altomonte J. Richter A.

Dong H. Accili D. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2003; 423: 550-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar). In muscle, although increases in FoxO1 expression are observed with fasting, the role of these increases in regulating glucose metabolism has not been studied. Here, we examined the effects of targeting FoxO1 to the nucleus of C2C12 myotubes on glucose uptake, oxidation, and incorporation into glycogen and on expression of several key regulatory genes. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, glucose uptake and oxidation were not significantly changed after TAM treatment. Glucose incorporation into glycogen was significantly decreased, although the effect was modest (20%) (Fig. 2C). No changes were observed in expression of the major muscle glucose transporters, Glut1 and Glut4. The enzyme PDK4, which regulates activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase, has been shown to be a FoxO1 target (8.Furuyama T. Yamashita H. Kitayama K. Higami Y. Shimokawa I. Mori N. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2002; 59: 331-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In line with this, a small but significant increase in PDK4 expression was observed with FoxO1 activation. Together, these data indicate that FoxO1 alone may not play a major role in regulating glucose metabolism in C2C12 muscle cells. FoxO1 Increases FA Oxidation and the Expression of FA Oxidation-related Genes—We speculated that if FoxO1 is an important regulator of muscle cell adaptation to fasting, it would be expected to promote FA utilization. To address this question, we first examined the effects of activating FoxO1 in C2C12 cells on FA oxidation. As shown in Fig. 3A, oleate oxidation was significantly increased by FoxO1 activation. This effect was apparent 4 h after addition of TAM and increased in magnitude as the length of TAM treatment was extended to 12 h (Fig. 3B). In contrast, TAM addition alone did not affect FA oxidation in C2C12 cells stably transfected with the empty retroviral vector (data not shown), indicating that the effect on FA oxidation is mediated through FoxO1. Fig. 3C shows that TG content was increased after FoxO1 activation from 12 to 18 μg/mg protein. However, FA incorporation into TG and glycerol release were similar in cells before and after TAM treatment, indicating that turnover of TG was unaltered by FoxO1 activation (data not shown). The effect of FoxO1 activation on the expression of several key genes involved in the regulation of FA oxidation in C2C12 cells was examined. As shown in Fig. 3D, mRNA abundance for the first enzyme of FA metabolism, acyl-CoA synthase (ACS), was not altered. The enzyme of peroxisomal FA oxidation, acyl-CoA oxidase, was increased more than 2-fold by TAM treatment. Expression of the mitochondrial enzyme of β oxidation carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1, examined for both the α and β isoforms, which are known to be present in muscle, was unchanged. However, mRNA for the enzyme acetyl-CoA-carboxylase (ACC), which catalyzes formation of malonyl-CoA, an allosteric inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1, was reduced by 50%. Expression of the malonyl-CoA decarboxylase enzyme, which acts to process malonyl-CoA, was not affected. This suggests that FoxO1 activation may promote FA oxidation in part by limiting the formation of malonyl-CoA and thereby enhancing the function of carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1. Expression of PPARδ, which has been shown to play an important role in regulating FA oxidation in muscle (23.Holst D. Luquet S. Nogueira V. Kristiansen K. Leverve X. Grimaldi P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1633: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 24.Holst D. Luquet S. Kristiansen K. Grimaldi P.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 288: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) was moderately increased after TAM addition, whereas no effect was observed on either PPARα or PPARγ (data not shown). Thus, activation of FoxO1 may stimulate FA oxidation at least in part by reducing the expression of ACC and increasing that of acyl-CoA oxidase, promoting FA oxidation in mitochondria and peroxisomes, respectively. FoxO1 Increases FA Uptake—Intramyocellular TGs reflect a balance between uptake and oxidation of FA. The finding that TG content increases in myotubes after FoxO1 activation indicated that the enhancement in FA oxidation was not sufficient to limit TG accumulation and suggested that FoxO1 may be increasing FA uptake directly. To examine this, we determined initial rates of FA uptake into FoxO1 myotubes after a 12-h incubation with or without 1 μm TAM. As shown in Fig. 4A, activation of FoxO1 increased oleate uptake by about 3-fold as compared with the basal state (no TAM). The effect could be detected as early as 45 min after addition of TAM, and its magnitude increased with time (Fig. 4B). To determine whether DNA binding by FoxO1 was required for this effect, studies were performed with cells expressing FoxO/H215-ER, a fusion protein that is defective in DNA binding activity due to mutation of His215 within helix 3 of the DNA binding domain. No enhancement of uptake was observed after TAM treatment in FoxO/H215-expressing cells (Fig. 4C), indicating that DNA binding is likely important for the effect of FoxO1 on FA uptake. FoxO1 Increases Membrane CD36 Content—The membrane protein CD36 (or FAT) facilitates the major fraction of FA uptake in muscle (11.Coburn C.T. Knapp Jr., F.F. Febbraio M. Beets A.L. Silverstein R.L.

Nutr. 2002; 22: 383-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), and its membrane recruitment is acutely regulated, allowing rapid adaptations in muscle FA uptake. For example, muscle contraction is associated with CD36 recruitment to the plasma membrane, favoring an increase in FA uptake and utilization that is important for the working muscle (26.Bonen A. Dyck D.J. Ibrahimi A. Abumrad N.A. Am. J."

We found that lipocalin 2 could also convert 4T1-Ras-transformed mesenchymal tumor cells to an epithelial phenotype, increase E-cadherin expression, and suppress cell invasiveness in vitro and tumor growth and lung metastases in vivo. The Ras-MAPK pathway mediated the epithelial to mesenchymal transition in part by increasing E-cadherin phosphorylation and degradation. Lipocalin 2 antagonized these effects at a point upstream of Raf activation. Lipocalin 2 action was enhanced by iron-siderophore.

Lipocalin 2 is a member of a superfamily of carrier proteins (11.Flower D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar) that is expressed in granulocytic precursors (12.Cowland J.B. Borregaard N. Genomics. 1997; 45: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar) as well as in numerous epithelia cell types (13.Friedl A. Stoesz S.P. Buckley P. Gould M.N. Histochem.

Although lipocalin 2 is highly expressed upon polyoma, SV40 or neu transformation, and after malignant transformation of the breast, lung, colon, and pancreatic epithelia (12.Cowland J.B. Borregaard N. Genomics. 1997; 45: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 13.Friedl A. Stoesz S.P. Buckley P. Gould M.N. Histochem. J. 1999; 31: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), the functional role of lipocalin 2 in this context is unknown. Here we suggest that the protein regulates the epithelial characteristics of malignant cells as it does for embryonic mesenchyme. This activity might result from iron transport or signaling through unknown receptors (18.Devireddy L.R. Teodoro J.G. Richard F.A. Green M.R. Science. 2001; 293: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). To test these hypotheses, we added purified lipocalin 2 or lipocalin 2 vectors to Ras-transformed 4T1 mouse mammary tumor cells. These cells are known to metastasize to bone, liver, and lung tissue in a pattern similar to that found in human breast cancer (19.Lin P. Buxton J.A. Acheson A. Radziejewski C. Maisonpierre P.C. Yancopoulos G.D. Channon K.M. Hale L.P. Dewhirst M.W. George S.E. Peters K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8829-8834Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). However, introduction of lipocalin 2 reversed Ras-induced EMT, reduced tumor growth, and dramatically suppressed metastasis. In lipocalin 2-treated cells, E-cadherin was rescued from proteasomal degradation by inhibition of Ras-MAPK signaling. This protection was iron-dependent. Plasmids, Virus Constructs, Lipocalin 2 Proteins, Antibodies, and Signaling Inhibitors—Human lipocalin 2 cDNA (GenBank™ accession number BC033089) with a C terminus HA tag was PCR-amplified and subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). The constitutively active form H-ras A12-pBabe retroviral vector and empty-pBabe were gifts from Dr. M. Ewen (Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA). Another constitutively active form of ras plasmid (H-ras V12-pcDNA3.1) was purchased from the Guthrie cDNA Resource Center (Sayre, PA). The constitutively active form of MEK (MEK-DD) and Lac-Z adenoviral vectors were gifts from Dr. E. O'Leary (Harvard Institute of Medicine, Boston, MA). MEK-DD cDNA was a gift from Dr. H. Iba (Tokyo University, Tokyo, Japan). Recombinant mouse lipocalin 2 (accession number NM008491) was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein in the BL21 strain of Escherichia coli (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), which does not synthesize siderophore (20.Goetz D.H.

Ferric sulfate (Sigma-Aldrich) was added in the culture medium at 50 μm. The protein was isolated using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences), eluted with thrombin (Sigma-Aldrich), and further purified with gel filtration (Superdex 75; Amersham Biosciences). Iron-loaded lipocalin 2 (Lipo:Sid:Fe) and iron-unloaded lipocalin 2 (Lipo:Sid) were prepared by mixing the recombinant protein with iron-loaded and iron-unloaded forms of a bacterial siderophore enterochelin (EMC Microcollections, Tübingen, Germany) in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature for 60 min. Unbound siderophore was removed with Microcon YM-10 (Millipore). The recombinant protein diluted in culture medium was sterilized before addition to the cells using 0.22-μm filters (Millipore). The following reagents were purchased from the respective companies: anti-Ras antibody, Oncogene Research Products (San Diego, CA); anti-Raf, anti-phospho-Raf, anti-MEK1/2, anti-phospho-MEK1/2, anti-ERK1/2, and anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibodies and MEK (U0126) and PI3K inhibitors (LY294002), Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA); anti-E-cadherin and PY20 anti-P-Tyr monoclonal antibodies, BD Transduction Laboratories (Deerfield, IL); anti-vimentin monoclonal antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-GAPDH antibody, Chemicon International Inc. (Temecula, CA); anti-Hakai antibody, Zymed Laboratories (San Francisco, CA); proteasome inhibitor MG132, Boston Biochemistry (Cambridge, MA); and deferoxamine mesylate salt, Sigma-Aldrich. Stable Cell Lines—293T and 4T1 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured in DMEM and 10% FCS and seeded (106 cells/100-mm dish) 12 h prior to transfection with FuGENE 6 reagent (32.5 μl; Roche Applied Science) and retroviral construct (10 μg, CA-H-ras-pBabe or empty-pBabe). 10 ml of condition medium were collected at 48 h and diluted 1:1 with DMEM and 10% FCS and added to the 4T1 cells (106 cells/100-mm dish) for 48 h, followed with selective medium containing hygromycin (Invitrogen). 8–10 single clones (4T1-Ras (referred to henceforth as R) or 4T1-EV (referred to henceforth as EV)) were selected. A single clone (clone 1) from the R group was used for additional studies. Similarly, a single clone (clone 1) from the EV group was selected. R cells (clone 1) were transfected with lipocalin 2-pcDNA3.1, selected with neomycin, and screened for HA-tagged lipocalin 2 using anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). RL (double transfectant) clone (clone 6), which showed the highest level of lipocalin 2 expression, was used for additional studies. Supplemental Fig. A shows that H-ras A12 DNA is present in RL cells and that the transcript is expressed in these cells, i.e. RL cells are indeed a double transfectant and have not merely lost expression of the mutant ras gene. Immunodetection—Cells were stained as described previously (22.Mammoto T. Mukai M. Mammoto A. Yamanaka Y. Hayashi Y. Mashimo T. Kishi Y. Nakamura H. Cancer Lett. 2002; 184: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and images were acquired with a DeltaVision system (Applied Precision, Issaquah, WA) equipped with an Axiovert 100 microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging Inc., Shelton, CT) and a Photometrics 300 series scientific-grade cooled charge-coupled device camera, reading 12-bit images and using the 63/1.4 NA plan-Neofluar objective. For immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting, tissues were weighed; diced; soaked in ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm NaF; homogenized on ice; and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant fluid was collected as total cell lysate. Cultured cells were washed, scraped, and solubilized in a lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1% aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After 20 min on ice, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatants were used as a cell lysate. Cell lysates or immunoprecipitated cell lysates were separated by PAGE (NuPAGE® gels; Invitrogen), followed by electroblotting onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Protein bands were detected using SuperSignal® West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce) (23.Hanai J. Gloy J. Karumanchi S.A. Kale S. Tang J. Hu G. Chan B. Ramchandran R. Jha V. Sukhatme V.P.

Luciferase Assay—After transient transfection of the plasmids, cells were incubated for 20 h in 10% FCS, and luciferase activity in the cell lysates was determined using a luminometer normalized by sea-pansy luciferase activity under the control of the thymidine kinase promoter. The Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System was purchased from Promega (24.Hanai J. Dhanabal M. Karumanchi S.A. Albanese C. Waterman M. Chan B. Ramchandran R. Pestell R. Sukhatme V.P. J. Biol.

In Vitro Invasion Assay—Polycarbonate membranes (6.5-mm diameter, 8-μm pore size) of Transwells (Coster, NY) were coated with Matrigel® (BD Biosciences), and cells were seeded (106 cells/100 μl) with DMEM including 0.1% serum. 16 h later, cells were fixed and stained with Giemsa solution, and the upper surface of each membrane was scraped with a cotton swab. Cells that had reached the lower surface of the membrane (migrated cells) were counted in 20 random fields using a light microscope (×400). Semiquantitative Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from 4T1 cells in vitro using the SV Total RNA Isolation system (Promega). Tissue RNA was collected with TRIzol® (Invitrogen). RT-PCR was performed on the PerkinElmer Life Sciences GeneAmp PCR System 2400 using Omniscript (Qiagen) for reverse transcription reaction, and Taq DNA polymerase (Qiagen) and primers for mouse E-cadherin (5′-TGCCCAGAAAATGAAAAAGG-3′ and 5′-AATGGCAGGAATTTGCAATC-3′), GAPDH (5′-ACAGTCTTCTGAGTGGCA-3′ and 5′-CCCATCACCATCTTCCAG-3′), and HA-tagged lipocalin 2 (5′-GGAGTACTTCAAGATCAC-3′ and 5′-GAAAGCATAGTCTGGAACGTCATAG-3′) for DNA amplification. The PCR conditions were established for DNA amplification in the linear range. RT-PCR products were analyzed on 1% agarose gels. In Vivo Assay for Primary Tumor Growth and Pulmonary Metastases—107 4T1 (EV, R, and RL) cells were injected subcutaneously in Balb/c mice (25.Asai T. Ueda T. Itoh K. Yoshioka K. Aoki Y. Mori S. Yoshikawa H. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 76: 418-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Although this model is not the standard orthotopic model used, we have used it extensively in our laboratory to study metastases in lung. Primary tumor volume (V) = a × b × b/2, where a represents the minimum tumor diameter, and b represents the maximum tumor diameter. After 3 weeks, lung weight and the number of metastatic nodules on the lung surface were evaluated. Statistical Analysis—All values are expressed as mean ± S.E. A one-tailed Student's t test was used to identify significant differences in multiple comparisons. A level of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Lipocalin 2 Reverses the Ras-transformed Phenotype—We chose a syngeneic spontaneously metastasizing murine breast cancer model (4T1 cell line) and accelerated its metastatic potential by introduction of constitutively active mouse H-ras mutant A12 using retrovirus. Whereas 4T1 cells infected with an empty vector (EV) grew in a cobblestone-shaped pattern (Fig. 1A, top left panel), 4T1-Ras (R) cells were spindle-shaped and did not form clusters at low confluence (Fig. 1A, top middle panel). To assess the effects of lipocalin 2 expression on Ras transformation, we generated stable clones of 4T1-Ras cells expressing lipocalin 2 (RL) by transfection of a lipocalin expression plasmid (lipocalin 2-pcDNA3.1). Compared with R cells, the RL cells (Fig. 1A, top right panel) reverted to an epithelial morphology and grew appositionally (similar to EV cells), reexpressed E-cadherin, and suppressed the expression of mesenchymal vimentin. (Fig. 1, A, bottom panels, and B). In contrast, E-cadherin mRNA remained unchanged (Fig. 1C), suggesting that the effects of Ras and lipocalin were post-transcriptional. Expression of E-cadherin in RL cells was dependent on the dose of lipocalin 2-pcDNA3.1 expression vector (transiently introduced in a population of R cells), on a conditioned medium containing lipocalin 2 (Fig. 1, D and E), and on recombinant lipocalin 2 protein. Indeed stable lipocalin 2 expression (RL) almost completely reversed (by ∼76%) Ras-induced invasiveness in vitro (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Invasion migration assay using each stable clone of 4T1. Polycarbonate membranes of Transwells were coated with Matrigel®, and cells were seeded. 16 h later, cells were fixed, stained with Giemsa solution, and counted for each of the stable clones EV, R, and RL.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether lipocalin 2 could alter the growth of tumors in vivo, we injected EV, R, or RL cells subcutaneously into the backs of Balb/c mice and assessed primary and metastatic tumor size at 1, 2, and 3 weeks post-inoculation. Primary tumors of R cells were significantly larger than those of lipocalin 2 cells (RL) or control cells (EV) (Fig. 3A). Indeed, lipocalin 2 reversed the invasion of adjacent muscle seen in tumors derived from R cells (Fig. 3B). Just like control EV cells, RL tumors were solid, compact, and condensed (they could be “shelled out”). Indeed, RL tumors had more E-cadherin and less vimentin than R cells, making them similar to control tumors (EV cells; Fig. 3C). Most dramatically, the number of metastatic pulmonary nodules was reduced by 80% in RL cells compared with R cells (Fig. 3, E–G), and lung weights were lower. All of these effects were likely post-transcriptional; although mRNA for E-cadherin seemed down-regulated in the R versus EV tumors (Fig. 3D), loading differences (note the GAPDH “controls”) make this effect less pronounced and more consistent with the in vitro data (Fig. 1C). Taken together, we find that lipocalin 2 enhanced the epithelial phenotype and inhibited metastasis of Ras-transformed cells. MAPK Signaling: Activation by Ras and Suppression by Lipocalin 2—Ras has multiple downstream effectors (26.Campbell P.M. Der C.J. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2004; 14: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). It activates Raf, which in turn activates MEK, leading to the phosphorylation of MAPK. Ras also activates PI3K. To clarify the Ras pathway of EMT, we assessed the effect of a MEK inhibitor (U0126) and a PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) on R cells. As shown in Fig. 4, the MEK inhibitor reversed Ras-induced EMT, but the effect of the PI3K inhibitor was partial, at best. Because U0126 can inhibit MEK5 in addition to MEK1/2 (referred to here as MEK), we infected R cells with an adenovirus carrying a dominant negative form of MEK1 and found the same results as those obtained with U0126 (data not shown). These data indicate that Ras-MEK signaling is essential for EMT. To determine whether lipocalin 2 reversed Ras-induced EMT by interfering with MEK signaling, we added purified lipocalin 2 protein (iron-loaded with siderophore, Lipo:Sid:Fe) to R cells and found that Ras-induced phosphorylation of Raf, MEK, and ERK1/2 was largely abrogated but that total Ras expression was unchanged (Fig. 5A). Signaling events downstream of ERK activation were then monitored with a multi-copy serum-response element (SRE)-luciferase construct introduced into EV, R, and RL cells (Fig. 5B). RL and EV cells gave comparable levels of luciferase activity, but this was only about one-half to two-thirds of the transcription found in R cells. Just like R cells treated with exogenous protein (Fig. 5A), infection of R cells with recombinant adenovirus carrying lipocalin 2, but not green fluorescent protein, reduced SRE-luciferase activity and MEK and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, without altering Ras expression (data not shown). These data indicate that Ras-MEK is modulated by lipocalin 2. To localize the effect of lipocalin on Ras-MAPK signaling, we utilized an adenovirus and expression plasmid encoding a constitutively active MEK (MEK-DD) (27.Murakami M. Ui M. Iba H. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 333-342PubMed Google Scholar). MEK-DD adenoviral infection of EV cells led to increased SRE-luciferase activity (increased MAPK activity; data not shown). Importantly, constitutively active MEK resulted in a concentration-dependent EMT, as ascertained by cell shape and colony morphology (Fig. 5C) and by expression of E-cadherin protein (Fig. 5D) in RL cells, indicating that MEK-DD was dominant over the effect of lipocalin 2. Consistent with this idea, MEK-DD also increased SRE-luciferase activity in EV cells, but lipocalin 2 protein (Lipo:Sid:Fe) was unable to inhibit this effect (Fig. 5E, lanes 1, 4, and 5). On the other hand, lipocalin 2 protein down-regulated SRE-luciferase activity resulting from transfection of a constitutively active form of H-ras V12 (CA-H-ras) (Fig. 5E, lanes 1, 2, and 3), as would be expected from the data with stable clones in Fig. 5B. Also, lipocalin 2 cDNA transfection induced E-cadherin expression in EV cells, but this effect was reversed by concomitant MEK-DD adenoviral infection (see Supplemental Fig. B). These data indicate that lipocalin 2 acts upstream of MEK activation. Given that lipocalin 2 down-regulated Raf phosphorylation (Fig. 5A) but did not alter the level of Ras expression, our data indicate that lipocalin 2 acts on Ras-MAPK signaling between Ras and Raf. Furthermore, events outside the Ras-MAPK pathway affected by lipocalin are not sufficient to inhibit Ras-mediated EMT. Lipocalin 2 Inhibits Ras-induced E-Cadherin Phosphorylation and Degradation—To determine how lipocalin might affect Ras-mediated EMT, we focused on the expression of E-cadherin and its relationship to MAPK signaling. Lipocalin 2 is likely to modulate E-cadherin expression on a post-transcriptional level because it did not affect E-cadherin mRNA levels (Figs. 1C and 3D), nor did it enhance E-cadherin promoter transcriptional activity (data not shown). Indeed, we found that E-cadherin is powerfully regulated by proteasome-mediated degradation because treatment with proteasome inhibitor MG132 (0.5 nm) for 2 days increased E-cadherin protein in R cells (Fig. 6B, lanes 3 and 4) and in EV cells (Fig. 6B, lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, MG132 only slightly increased E-cadherin in RL cells (Fig. 6B, lanes 5 and 6), suggesting that E-cadherin degradation was already inhibited and implicating lipocalin 2 in the process. There was also no significant difference in GAPDH protein expression, showing specificity and lack of toxicity of MG132. Furthermore, it is likely that regulation of E-cadherin by proteasomal degradation is relevant to Ras-mediated EMT because MG132 reverted R cells to an epithelial phenotype (Fig. 6A). E-cadherin degradation is mediated by phosphorylation at the binding site for p120 and then recognition by Hakai (28.Fujita Y. Krause G. Scheffner M. Zechner D. Leddy H.E. Behrens J. Sommer T. Birchmeier W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 222-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar), which targets the protein for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. However, Hakai expression was unchanged by Ras transformation or by lipocalin 2 expression (Fig. 6C). However, we found that E-cadherin phosphorylation was higher in R cells than in either EV or RL cells or in R cells treated with the MEK inhibitor U0126 (Fig. 6D, top panel), in a pattern inversely correlated with E-cadherin protein levels (Fig. 6D, second panel), but was unaccounted for by changes in E-cadherin mRNA levels (Fig. 6D, third panel). Hence, E-cadherin phosphorylation is a target of Ras signaling in 4T1 cells; MEK activation, which is critical for EMT, is also responsible (directly or indirectly) for E-cadherin phosphorylation; and lipocalin 2 impinges on the Ras-MAPK pathway, suppressing E-cadherin phosphorylation and presumably decreasing its turnover. Role of Iron—Because the inductive activity of lipocalin 2 is markedly enhanced by loading the protein with iron (17.Li J.Y. Ram G. Gast K. Chen X. Barasch K. Mori K. Schmidt-Ott K. Wang J. Kuo H.C. Savage-Dunn C. Garrick M.D. Barasch J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2004; 287: C1547-C1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we tested the effect of iron on E-cadherin expression and MAPK signaling. Deferoxamine mesylate (2–5 μm; DFO), an iron chelating agent that can deplete iron from the intracellular pool (29.Paller M.S. Hedlund B.E. Kidney Int. 1988; 34: 474-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), changed the morphology of RL cells to a mesenchymal phenotype and suppressed E-cadherin expression (Fig. 7A), indicating that iron was necessary for E-cadherin expression. Indeed the effect of lipocalin 2 preparations on R cell epithelial morphology (see supplemental Fig. B) and E-cadherin expression correlated with iron carriage (Lipo:Sid:Fe > Lipo:Sid > lipocalin 2; Fig. 7B and supplemental Fig. C) and was dose-dependent (it should be noted that because the affinity of the siderophore for iron is so high (Kd = 10–49) (30.Loomis L.D. Raymond K.N. Inorg. Chem. 1991; 30: 906-911Crossref Scopus (273) Google Scholar), it is likely that the unloaded siderophore partially loaded with iron from the culture media). The same rank order was found the phosphorylation state of ERK1/2 (Fig. 7C) in cells treated with the lipocalins. In contrast to these results, simply adding iron (50 μm ferric ammonium sulfate) to R cells did not change their phenotype. Hence, the data demonstrate that lipocalin 2 inhibits Ras-mediated transformation by up-regulating E-cadherin through an inhibition of MAPK signaling in an iron-dependent manner, but iron alone is insufficient to reverse EMT. In this report we demonstrate that lipocalin 2 can alter the invasive and metastatic behavior of Ras-transformed breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo by reversing the EMT-inducing activity of Ras, through restoration of E-cadherin expression, via effects on the Ras-MAPK signaling pathway (Fig. 8). The data are consistent with overexpression models of E-cadherin, which prevents invasiveness of human carcinoma cell lines (4.Grunert S. Jechlinger M. Beug H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 10.Vanderburg C.R. Hay E.D. Acta Anat. (Basel). 1996; 157: 87-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 31.Steinberg M.S.

Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 572-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). However, to the best of our knowledge, there has never been a soluble factor that can up-regulate E-cadherin and reverse the metastatic phenotype in vitro and in vivo. Lipocalins, Cancer, and Effects of Lipocalin 2 on EMT in Tumor Cells—Increased expression of lipocalin 2 accompanies numerous transformations (induction by polyoma, SV40, phorbol ester, and the neu oncogene) and human carcinomas (colorectal, hepatic, pancreatic, and breast carcinomas), but the action of the protein has been obscure (reviewed in Ref. 33.Bratt T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 318-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), with the exception of α2μ-globulin in inducing renal cancer (34.Lehman-McKeeman L.D. Caudill D. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1992; 116: 170-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). One report using antisense RNA in an esophageal cancer cell line implanted in an animal suggests that lipocalins are tumor promoters in vivo (35.Li E.M. Xu L.Y. Cai W.J. Xiong H.Q. Shen Z.Y. Zeng Y. Sheng Wu Hua Xue Yu Sheng Wu Wu Li Xue Bao (Shanghai). 2003; 35: 247-254PubMed Google Scholar), and lipocalin 2 may slightly promote the proliferation of estrogen receptor-negative mammary cells in vitro (36.Seth P. Porter D. Lahti-Domenici J. Geng Y. Richardson A. Polyak K. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4540-4544PubMed Google Scholar). However, using a large variety of assays, we find a protective role for lipocalin 2 during Ras-mediated transformation and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Indeed, lipocalin 2 produced smaller, more coherent tumors of higher density (similar weight but different cell types), with less regional invasion and dramatically fewer metastases in vivo as assessed by lung weight, the number of nodules on the lung surface, and histology. Consistent with this antimetastatic action of lipocalin 2, two reports have noted the loss of lipocalin 2 expression at metastatic (colon) carcinoma sites (13.Friedl A. Stoesz S.P. Buckley P. Gould M.N. Histochem. J. 1999; 31: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 14.Nielsen B.S. Borregaard N. Bundgaard J.R. Timshel S. Sehested M. Kjeldsen L. Gut. 1996; 38: 414-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), in contrast to abundant expression in the primary location. Moreover, our data are consistent with the actions of lipocalin 2 on embryonic mesenchyme. Lipocalin 2 Signaling—Lipocalins may stimulate cell growth and development by binding to cell surface receptors (37.Wojnar P. Lechner M. Merschak P. Redl B. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2001882295,"Glycoprotein V (GPV) is a subunit of the GPIb-IX-V receptor for von Willebrand factor and thrombin and has been shown to modulate platelet responses to the two strongest physiological agonists, thrombin and collagen. Thrombin directly cleaves GPV from the platelet surface, yielding a 69-kDa fragment GPV f1 of unknown function. We show here that a ∼82-kDa fragment of GPV is shed from the platelet surface upon cellular activation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or the collagen-related peptide. This shedding was inhibited by the broad range metalloproteinase inhibitor GM6001, the two potent ADAM17 inhibitors GW280264X and TAPI-2, and was absent in mice lacking functional ADAM17 (ADAM17 lacking Zn-binding domain; ADAM17ΔZn/ΔZn). Furthermore, we show that recombinant ADAM17 ectodomain efficiently releases GPV from the platelet surface. GPV is known to be associated with the intracellular regulatory protein calmodulin, which has previously been shown to be involved in ADAM17-mediated shedding of l-selectin from the surface of leukocytes. As in these reports, inhibition of calmodulin led to rapid GPV shedding from the platelet surface, a process that was again blocked by GM6001 or ADAM17 inhibitors and that was absent in ADAM17ΔZn/ΔZn mice. Inhibition of outside-in signaling through GPIIb/IIIa did not significantly affect GPV shedding, excluding an essential role of this pathway for the regulation of ADAM17 activity. These results demonstrate that GPV is cleaved upon agonist-induced platelet activation and show that ADAM17 is the major enzyme mediating this process.

Platelet adhesion and aggregation at sites of vascular injury is crucial to limit post-traumatic blood loss but may also harm tissue by occluding diseased vessels.

Ib-IX-V complex plays a central role in these events in that it mediates the initial platelet tethering to the damaged vessel wall under conditions of elevated shear by interacting with collagen-bound von Willebrand factor (1Savage B. Almus-Jacobs F. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1998; 94: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). The receptor complex consists of four distinct polypeptides, GPIbα (Mr = 143,000), Ib β (Mr = 22,000), V (Mr = 83,000), and IX (Mr = 20,000), in 1:1:0.5:1 stoichiometry with ∼25,000 copies per platelet. GPs Ib, V, and IX are structurally related and belong to the family of leucine-rich glycoproteins (2Andrews R.K. Gardiner E.E. Shen Y. Whisstock J.C. Berndt M.C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 1170-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The receptor complex is associated with the regulatory cytoplasmic protein calmodulin, which is involved in the free Ca2+ uptake upon platelet activation (3Andrews R.K. Munday A.D. Mitchell C.A. Berndt M.C. Blood. 2001; 98: 681-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), but its exact role in GPIb-IX-V function is unclear.The importance of the GPIb-IX-V complex is emphasized by the study of the Bernard-Soulier syndrome, an inherited bleeding disorder in which the complex is congenitally missing or dysfunctional because of mutations in the genes encoding GPIb or GPIX (2Andrews R.K. Gardiner E.E. Shen Y. Whisstock J.C. Berndt M.C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 1170-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Likewise, targeted deletion of the GPIbα (4Ware J. Russell S. Ruggeri Z.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2803-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) or GPIbβ (5Kato K. Martinez C. Russell S. Nurden P. Nurden A. Fiering S. Ware J. Blood. 2004; 104: 2339-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) genes in mice reproduces the Bernard-Soulier phenotype, as characterized by thrombocytopenia, giant platelets, and massively prolonged bleeding times. Although the essential role of GPIb-IX for normal platelet function is firmly established, the function of GPV in the receptor complex is only partly understood. GPV is merely loosely attached to GPIb-IX and, in contrast to GPs Ib and IX, is not essential for the expression of the receptor complex on the platelet surface. By contrast, GPIb and IX are required for expression of GP V (2Andrews R.K. Gardiner E.E. Shen Y. Whisstock J.C. Berndt M.C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 1170-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). GPV-deficient mice have normal platelet size and counts, and the cells display an unaltered von Willebrand factor binding activity (6Kahn M.L. Diacovo T.G. Bainton D.F. Lanza F. Trejo J. Coughlin S.R. Blood. 1999; 94: 4112-4121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ramakrishnan V. Reeves P.S. DeGuzman F. Deshpande U. Ministri-Madrid K. DuBridge R.B. Phillips D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13336-13341Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).Nevertheless, recent studies have revealed that GPV plays a role in different pathways of platelet activation. On the one hand, GPV was found to serve as a collagen receptor and to facilitate GPVI-dependent platelet-collagen interactions (8Moog S. Mangin P. Lenain N. Strassel C. Ravanat C. Schuhler S. Freund M. Santer M. Kahn M. Nieswandt B. Gachet C. Cazenave J.P. Lanza F. Blood. 2001; 98: 1038-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). On the other hand, GPV seems to act as a negative modulator of thrombin-induced platelet activation, in that cleavage of the protein unmasks GPIb-IX and allows binding of thrombin to GPIbα (9Ramakrishnan V. DeGuzman F. Bao M. Hall S.W. Leung L.L. Phillips D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1823-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that regulation of GPV expression levels may play a role in determining the pathway of platelet activation in vivo, where several agonists act in concert during thrombus formation. However, knowledge about how the number of GPV molecules is regulated on the platelet surface is limited. It is well known that thrombin directly cleaves GPV, releasing a 69-kDa soluble fragment (GPV f1) of unknown function. In addition, elastase and calpain are capable of cleaving GPV as well as releasing 75-and 82-kDa fragments, respectively, but the significance of these observations is unresolved.Proteolysis of membrane proteins is a well characterized regulatory process in a number of systems, including adhesion molecules, cytokines, growth factors, and their receptors. In most cases, shedding of ectodomains is mediated by membrane-anchored metalloproteinases (reviewed in Refs. 10Blobel C.P. Inflamm. Res. 2002; 51: 83-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 11Moss M.L. Lambert M.H. Essays Biochem. 2002; 38: 141-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 12Black R.A. Doedens J.R.

Symp. 2003; : 39-52PubMed Google Scholar). Calmodulin has been shown to play a role in shedding of l-selectin from leukocytes (13Kahn J. Walcheck B. Migaki G.I. Jutila M.A. Kishimoto T.K. Cell. 1998; 92: 809-818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), a process that is mediated by tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme (ADAM17), which belongs to the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) family of zinc-dependent proteinases. The importance of ADAM17-mediated ectodomain shedding is highlighted by the perinatal lethality of mice lacking the functional enzyme (14Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Reddy P. Stocking K.L. Sunnarborg S.W.

Science. 1998; 282: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar).In the current study, we investigated the regulation of GPV in human and mouse platelets. We show that agonist-induced platelet activation or inhibition of calmodulin results in metalloproteinase-dependent shedding of an 82-kDa fragment of the receptor from the platelet surface. Furthermore, using mice lacking functional ADAM17 (ADAM17 lacking Zn-binding domain; ADAM17ΔZn/ΔZn), we identify ADAM17 as the responsible sheddase.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMice—NMRI wild-type mice 6 to 10 weeks of age were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Sulzfeld, Germany) and kept in our animal facilities.

Anti-human GPV and anti-human GPIb were purchased from Immunotools (Friesoythe, Germany). All other antibodies were generated, produced, and modified in our laboratories: p0p6 (anti-murine GPIX), DOM1 and DOM2 (anti-murine GPV), and p0p1 (anti-human GPIbβ) (15Bergmeier W. Rackebrandt K.

Blood was collected in a tube containing 10% (v/v) 1 μm sodium citrate or 7.5 units/ml heparin, and platelet-rich plasma (prp) was obtained by centrifugation at 300 × g for 10 min at room temperature (RT). For washed platelets, prp was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 8 min at room temperature and the pellet was resupended twice in modified Tyrode-HEPES buffer (134 mm NaCl, 0.34 mm Na2HPO4, 2.9 mm KCL, 12 mm NaHCO3, 20 mm HEPES, 5 mm glucose, and 0.35% bovine serum albumin, pH 6.6) in the presence of prostacyclin (0.1 μg/ml) and apyrase (0.02 units/ml). Platelets were then resuspended in the same buffer (pH 7.0; 0.02 units/ml apyrase) and incubated at 37 °C for at least 30 min before use. Isolated platelets did not show any signs of activation as shown by flow cytometry (staining for P-selectin and surface-expressed fibrinogen). Because ADAM17ΔZn/ΔZn mice die perinatally (14Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Reddy P. Stocking K.L. Sunnarborg S.W. Lee D.C. Russell W.E. Castner B.J. Johnson R.S. Fitzner J.N. Boyce R.W. Nelson N.

Science. 1998; 282: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar), blood was collected from mutant and control mice immediately after birth.Prepapartion of Washed Human Platelets—Platelet-rich plasma was prepared from TBS-EDTA anticoagulated blood obtained from aspirin free healthy volunteers and platelets were washed by sequential centrifugation as described previously (17Cazenave J.P. Ohlmann P. Cassel D. Eckly A. Hechler B. Gachet C. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 272: 13-28PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were finally suspended in Tyrode's buffer and adjusted to 3 × 105 platelets/ml.Platelet Activation—Washed platelets were resuspended at a concentration of 0.5 × 106 platelets/ml in modified Tyrode's buffer with 1 μm CaCl2. The activators and inhibitors were added at the following concentrations: 2.5 μg/ml CRP, 5 μm ADP, 0.1 μg/ml PMA, 0.2 units/ml thrombin, 100 μm GM6001, 200 μm W13, 200 μm GW280264X, and incubated for 10 min (or 2 h for W13) at 37 °C. Platelets were then directly centrifuged at 400 × g for 5 min to obtain cell-free supernatants for ELISA and immunoprecipitation or analyzed by flow cytometry.Platelet Treatment with Recombinant ADAM17—Platelets were washed twice in Tyrode's buffer in the presence of prostacyclin (0.1 μg/ml) and apyrase (0.02 units/ml) and finally resuspended in the absence of prostacyclin and apyrase to a concentration of 0.5 × 109 platelets/ml. Recombinant ADAM17 (dissolved at a concentration of 100 μg/ml in 25 mm Tris, pH 9.0, containing 2.5 μm ZnCl2 and 0.005% Brij according to the manufacturer's instructions) was added to the platelet suspension at the indicated concentrations and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Thereafter, the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry.Flow Cytometry—Washed platelets (2 × 106 in Tyrode's buffer and 1 mm CaCl2) were incubated with fluorophore-conjugated monoclonal antibodies (10 μg/ml) for 10 min at RT, the reaction was stopped with 500 μl of PBS, and the samples were immediately analyzed on a FAC-SCalibur (BD Biosciences).Aggregometry—To determine platelet aggregation, light transmission was measured using prp (200 μl with 0.5 × 106 platelets/μl) and washed platelets. Transmission was recorded on a Fibrintimer 4 channel aggregometer (APACT Laborgeräte und Analysensysteme, Hamburg, Germany) over 10 min and was expressed as arbitrary units with 100% transmission adjusted with plasma. Platelet aggregation was induced by addition of PMA (0.1 μg/ml), CRP (2.5 μg/ml), U46619 (0.1 μm), and ADP (5 μm). Thrombin-induced aggregation was performed with washed platelets (200 μl with 0.5 × 106 platelets/μl in Tyrode's buffer, 1 μmol/liter CaCl2). For GIIb/IIIa inhibition, JON/A (50 μg/ml) was added 3 min before addition of the activators.ELISA—To detect cleaved GPV molecule with the ELISA system, platelets were treated with the indicated activators and the supernatants (from 300 μl of 0.5 × 109 platelets) were cleared by 10-min centrifugation at 15,000 × g. For GIIb/IIIa blocking, JON/A (50 μg/ml) was added 3 min before addition of the activators. Supernatants were transferred onto αGPV-coated (DOM1; 20 μg/ml) ELISA plates, incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, and washed three times with washing buffer (1 × PBS and 0.1% Tween). Secondary antibody (DOM2-HRP) was added at a concentration of 2.5 μg/ml followed by 1 h incubation at 37 °C and detected with tetramethylbenzidine. The reaction was stopped with 0.5 m sulfuric acid and analyzed by WinRead.Immunoprecipitation—Washed platelets were surface-labeled with EZ-Link sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (25 μg/ml in PBS) and subsequently incubated with different reagents/agonists for the indicated times and then centrifuged (2000 × g; 10 min). Supernatants were then collected and incubated with 10 μg of DOM1 (anti-GPV), p0p4 (anti-GPIbα), or EDL1 (anti-GPIIIa) and 25 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) overnight at 4 °C. Samples were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was incubated with streptavidin-HRP (1 μg/ml) for 1 h after blocking. After extensive washing, biotinylated proteins were visualized by ECL.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo study GPV regulation on the platelet surface, we stimulated human platelets with PMA (100 ng/ml), ADP (5 μm), or CRP (2,5 μg/ml) and determined surface levels of GPV by flow cytometry. CRP activates the cells through the GPVI/FcRγ-chain complex (18Kehrel B. Wierwille S. Clemetson K.J. Anders O. Steiner M. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Okuma M. Barnes M.J. Blood. 1998; 91: 491-499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the major platelet collagen receptor (19Nieswandt B. Watson S.P. Blood. 2003; 102: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). As a positive control, platelets were incubated with thrombin (0.1 units/ml), which directly cleaves the receptor. GPV was down-regulated in response to PMA to a similar extent as in the thrombin control, whereas a weaker effect was observed in response to CRP. In contrast, ADP, which is only a weak platelet agonist, did not induce significant down-regulation of GPV (Fig. 1A).GPIb-IX-V can be down-regulated by ectodomain shedding of GPIbα and/or GPV or by internalization of the entire receptor complex (15Bergmeier W. Rackebrandt K. Schroder W. Zirngibl H. Nieswandt B. Blood. 2000; 95: 886-893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Fox J.E. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1994; 5: 291-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the decrease in GPV surface expression is accompanied by the down-regulation of the entire GPIb-IX-V complex from the cell surface, we determined the surface levels of GPIbβ, because this subunit is not cleaved upon platelet activation. GPIbβ surface levels were only slightly decreased or unchanged in PMA- or CRP-stimulated platelets, respectively, indicating that down-regulation of GPV was rather the effect of shedding than internalization (Fig. 1B).PMA- or CRP-induced shedding of GPV occurred independently of thrombin activity in that it was unaltered in the presence of the thrombin inhibitor hirudin (data not shown). In contrast, the broad spectrum metalloproteinase inhibitor GM6001 markedly blocked GPV shedding in response to PMA and CRP but not thrombin (Fig. 1C). Very similar results were obtained when GPV regulation was studied in murine platelets. In these cells, PMA induced virtually complete down-regulation of the receptor, whereas the effect of CRP was weaker and ADP did not alter GPV surface levels (Fig. 2A). GPIX surface levels remained virtually unchanged under all conditions, confirming that GPV shedding is not accompanied by down-regulation of the entire GPIbIX-V complex from the cell surface (Fig. 2A). As in human platelets, GM6001 almost completely inhibited GPV shedding in response to PMA or CRP but not thrombin (Fig. 2B). Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that the metalloproteinase-generated fragment of GPV has a molecular mass of ∼82 kDa and thereby differs significantly from GPV f1 (∼69 kDa) released by thrombin (Fig. 2C). As a control, immunoprecipitations were also performed with an anti-GPIIIa antibody, which did not yield a band under any condition (Fig. 2C). These results demonstrated that platelet activation by thrombin or PMA and CRP induces limited proteolysis of GPV via different mechanisms. PMA- or CRP-stimulated cleavage involves a platelet-derived metalloproteinase and occurs near the transmembrane domain.Fig. 2Metalloproteinase- and thrombin-mediated GPV cleavage leads to the generation of different soluble GPV variants. Washed mouse platelets were incubated with the indicated agonists for 15 min at 37 °C, stained with FITC-labeled anti-GPV or anti-GPIX antibody (A) in the presence or absence of GM6001 (B), and analyzed immediately on a FACScalibur. The data shown are the mean ± S.D. of six separate experiments and are presented as percentage of mean fluorescence determined at t = 0. C, surface-biotinylated mouse platelets were incubated with the indicated agonists for 15 min at 37 °C in the absence or presence of GM6001 (100 μm). Thereafter, GPV and GPIIIa were immunoprecipitated from the supernatants of the cells. Immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and visualized using streptavidin-HRP and ECL. The data shown are representative of three identical experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The strong effect of PMA on GPV shedding prompted us to test a possible role of ADAM17 in this process, because this sheddase is known to be potently induced by protein kinase C activators. Therefore, we first tested platelets for the expression of ADAM 17 by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3A, ADAM 17 (∼130 kDa) was specifically detectable in whole cell lysates of both human and mouse platelets. Next, we examined the effect of the two potent ADAM17 inhibitors, GW280264X (GlaxoSmithKline) (21Hundhausen C. Misztela D. Berkhout T.A. Broadway N. Saftig P. Reiss K. Hartmann D. Fahrenholz F.

Both compounds inhibited PMA- and CRP-induced GPV shedding in human and mouse platelets (Fig. 3B), suggesting that ADAM17 mediates ectodomain shedding of GPV. To test this directly, platelets were incubated with different concentrations of recombinant human ADAM17 ectodomain (rhADAM17), and GPV levels were determined by flow cytometry. Indeed, rhADAM17 dose-dependently down-regulated GPV (Fig. 3C), but not GPIX or GPIIb/IIIa (not shown) from the platelet surface, and this effect was abrogated in the presence of GM6001. To confirm the role of ADAM17 in this process, platelets from mice lacking functional ADAM17 (ADAM17ΔZn/ΔZn) were activated with PMA or CRP, and surface levels of GPV were determined by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 4, no GPV shedding was observed in these mice, demonstrating that ADAM17 is the major sheddase that cleaves GPV.Fig. 3Inhibition of ADAM17 blocks GPV shedding from the platelet surface.A, whole platelet proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and immunoblotted with anti-ADAM17 antibodies. B, human (left) and mouse (right) platelets were activated in presence or absence of TAPI-2 (100 μm) or GW280264X (10 μm), stained with FITC-labeled anti-GPV antibody and analyzed immediately on a FACScalibur apparatus.

Alexander S.R. Kishimoto T.K. Walcheck B. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1617-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and GPVI on platelets (26Gardiner E.E. Arthur J.F. Kahn M.L. Berndt M.C. Andrews R.K. Blood. 2004; PubMed Google Scholar), are known to be associated intracellularly with calmodulin and to undergo rapid ectodomain shedding upon treatment with calmodulin inhibitors, such as W13 (27Hidaka H. Tanaka T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 102: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 28Tanaka T. Ohmura T. Hidaka H. Pharmacology. 1983; 26: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To examine the implication of calmodulin in ADAM17-dependent GPV shedding, platelets were incubated with vehicle or the calmodulin inhibitor W13 (200 μm), and GPV surface levels were determined at different time points. As shown in Fig. 5A, GPV was rapidly down-regulated in the presence, but not in the absence, of W13 in both mouse and human platelets. Similar results were obtained with a second calmodulin inhibitor, W7 (data not shown). As with CRP- or PMA-stimulated platelets, W13-induced GPV shedding was inhibited in the presence of GM6001, GW280264X, or TAPI-2 (Fig. 5A and data not shown) and was absent in platelets from ADAMΔZn/ΔZn mice (Fig. 5B). Moreover, immunoprecipitation experiments showed the accumulation of the ∼82-kDa variant of soluble GPV in the supernatant of W13-treated platelets (Fig. 5C). Together, these results indicate that calmodulin is a negative regulator of ADAM17-mediated GPV cleavage. As described previously for l-selectin (13Kahn J. Walcheck B. Migaki G.I.

Knocking down caveolin-1 gave particularly striking results. A 70% decrease caused a 5-fold increase in MEK/ERK activation and collagen expression. The combined data reveal a branched signaling pathway. In its central portion MEK activates ERK, leading to increased collagen expression. Two branches converge on MEK/ERK. In one, increased PKCϵ leads to MEK/ERK activation. In another, increased PKCα induces caveolin-1 expression, which in turn inhibits MEK/ERK activation and collagen expression. Lung fibroblasts from scleroderma patients with pulmonary fibrosis showed altered signaling. Consistent with their overexpression of collagen, scleroderma lung fibroblasts contain more activated MEK/ERK and less caveolin-1 than normal lung fibroblasts. Because cutaneous fibrosis is the hallmark of scleroderma, we also studied dermal fibroblasts. As in lung, there was more activated MEK/ERK in cells from scleroderma patients than in control cells, and MEK inhibition decreased collagen expression. However, the distinctive levels of PKCϵ, PKCα, and caveolin-1 in lung and dermal fibroblasts from scleroderma patients and control subjects indicate that the links between these signaling proteins and MEK/ERK must function differently in the four cell types. Finally, we confirmed the relevance of these signaling cascades in vivo. The combined results demonstrate that a branched signaling pathway involving MEK, ERK, PKCϵ, PKCα, and caveolin-1 regulates collagen expression in normal lung tissue and is perturbed during fibrosis.

The combined results demonstrate that a branched signaling pathway involving MEK, ERK, PKCϵ, PKCα, and caveolin-1 regulates collagen expression in normal lung tissue and is perturbed during fibrosis. The normal regulation of collagen expression in lung tissue is disrupted in many diseases including scleroderma (systemic sclerosis), leading to the overexpression of collagen, pulmonary fibrosis, and frequently death. Despite its importance, relatively little is known about the signaling mechanisms that regulate collagen expression in normal lung tissue and how these mechanisms are altered in fibrotic lung tissue. The current studies focus on three families of signaling proteins, MEK 1The abbreviations used are: MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; c-a, constitutively active; d-n, dominant negative; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; NDF, normal dermal fibroblasts; NLF, normal lung fibroblasts; ODN, oligodeoxynucleotide; PKC, protein kinase C; siRNA, short inhibitory RNA; SDF, scleroderma dermal fibroblasts; SLF, scleroderma lung fibroblasts; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; ph-, phospho. 1The abbreviations used are: MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; c-a, constitutively active; d-n, dominant negative; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; NDF, normal dermal fibroblasts; NLF, normal lung fibroblasts; ODN, oligodeoxynucleotide; PKC, protein kinase C; siRNA, short inhibitory RNA; SDF, scleroderma dermal fibroblasts; SLF, scleroderma lung fibroblasts; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; ph-, phospho./ERK, PKC, and caveolin, whose activities are likely to be integrated given that caveolin-1 can serve as a scaffold to which MEK, ERK, PKCα, and PKCϵ bind (1.Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar).The family of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) consists of three known subfamilies, MEK1 and -2 (the MAPK/ERK kinases), ERK1 and -2 (the extracellular signal-regulated kinases), the JNKs (c-Jun N-terminal kinases), and the p38 MAPKs (2.Clerk A. Sughen P.H. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 847-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 3.Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). ERK1 and ERK2 are activated when they are phosphorylated by MEK1 or MEK2. These kinases integrate multiple signals and are involved in regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation (3.Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). Conflicting reports have suggested that the activation of MEK/ERK has a positive effect on collagen expression by dermal fibroblasts (4.Atamas S.P. Luzina I.G. Choi J. Tsymbalyuk N. Carbonetti N.H. Singh I.S. Trojanowska M. Jiminez S.A. White B. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2003; 29: 743-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) or has a negative effect (5.Reunanen N. Foschi M. Han J. Kahari V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34634-34639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).The PKC family of serine-threonine kinases forms three subfamilies based on structural homologies and sensitivity to activators. Conventional PKCs (α, β1, β2, γ) are calcium-dependent and are activated by phosphatidylserine, diacylglycerol, or phorbol esters; the novel PKCs (δ, ϵ, ν, θ) differ in that they are calcium-independent; the atypical PKCs (λ, ζ) are also calcium-independent and additionally are insensitive to diacylglycerol and phorbol esters (6.Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4215) Google Scholar, 7.Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar). All PKC isoforms contain catalytic and regulatory domains. The regulatory domain contains a pseudosubstrate region that binds to the catalytic cleft thereby inhibiting the kinase activity of PKC. Members of the conventional subfamily contain four homologous domains (C1, C2, C3, and C4) interspersed with isozyme-unique variable or V domains. Members of the novel subfamily have a modified C2 domain; members of the atypical subfamily lack both the C2 and half of the C1 domain (8.Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). Upon activation, PKC isozymes translocate from the cytoplasm to membranes, the cytoskeleton, or the nucleus (9.Mochly-Rosen D. Gordon A.S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar).Two of the novel PKCs, δ and ϵ, play roles in scleroderma. PKCδ is present at elevated levels in scleroderma dermal fibroblasts and promotes collagen expression (10.Jimenez S.A. Gaidarova S. Saitta B. Sandorfi N. Herrich D.J. Rosenbloom J.C. Kucich U. Abrams W.R. Rosenbloom J. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1395-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In contrast, PKCϵ functions abnormally in scleroderma lung fibroblasts (SLF). Depleting PKCϵ in normal lung fibroblasts (NLF) inhibits expression of the extracellular matrix protein tenascin-C, whereas depleting PKCϵ in SLF promotes tenascin-C expression (11.Tourkina E. Hoffman S. Fenton II, J.W. Lipsitz S. Silver R.M. Ludwicka-Bradley A. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 1370-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). SLF are deficient in PKCϵ and are sensitive to curcumin-induced apoptosis, whereas NLF are insensitive to curcumin (12.Tourkina E. Gooz P. Oats J.C. Ludwiscka-Bradley A. Silver R.M. Hoffman S. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; 31: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The importance of PKCϵ in regulating the sensitivity of cells to curcumin is demonstrated by the observations that 1) increasing PKCϵ expression in SLF provides protection against curcumin and 2) decreasing PKCϵ expression or activity in NLF causes the cells to become sensitive to curcumin (12.Tourkina E. Gooz P. Oats J.C. Ludwiscka-Bradley A. Silver R.M. Hoffman S. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; 31: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). PKCϵ is associated with the cytoskeleton in SLF but not in NLF (12.Tourkina E. Gooz P. Oats J.C. Ludwiscka-Bradley A. Silver R.M. Hoffman S. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

Thus, there may be more active PKCϵ in SLF than in NLF, despite the fact that there is less total PKCϵ.Caveolae were identified 40 years ago as flask-shaped invaginations on the surface of epithelial and endothelial cells. Caveolae play roles in the transport of macromolecules and in signal transduction (14.Anderson R.G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar, 15.Rybin V.O. Xu X. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 980-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The caveolin family of caveolae coat proteins contains at least three members. Caveolin-1 and -2 are abundantly expressed in adipocytes, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts; caveolin-3 is muscle-specific (1.Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

Caveolin-1 may modulate signal transduction by linking signaling molecules to caveolae and regulating their activity. In particular, caveolin-1 binds to a variety of kinases including PKC and MEK/ERK and thereby inhibits their catalytic activity (17.Cohen A.W. Park D.S. Woodman S.E. Williams T.M. Chandra M.

In caveolin-1 null mice, the diameter of alveolar spaces is reduced, alveolar walls are thickened and hypercellular, and the deposition of extracellular matrix is significantly increased (20.Drab M. Vercade P. Elger M. Kasper M. Lohn M. Lauterbachm B. Menne J. Lindschau C. Mende F. Luft F.C. Schedl A. Haller H. Kurzchalia T.V.

Similarly, caveolin-1 levels are strikingly decreased in lung tissue induced to become fibrotic by irradiation (22.Kasper M. Reimann T. Hempe U. Wenze K.W. Bierhaus A. Schuh D. Dimmer V. Haroske G. Muller M. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 109: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, the current report is the first to demonstrate signaling mechanisms involved in the regulation of collagen expression by caveolin-1.In the current studies, we have used specific inhibitors and constructs to alter the expression and function of MEK/ERK, PKC, and caveolin-1 in NLF and SLF. These studies have revealed that under normal conditions a branched signaling pathway regulates collagen expression. In the central portion of the pathway MEK activates ERK, leading to increased collagen expression. Two branches converge on MEK/ERK. In one, increased PKCϵ expression leads to MEK and ERK activation. In the other, increased PKCα expression induces caveolin-1 expression which, in turn, inhibits MEK/ERK activation and collagen expression. Consistent with their overexpression of collagen, SLF contained much more activated MEK and ERK and much less caveolin-1 than NLF. Moreover, because MEK and ERK are constitutively hyperactivated in SLF, treatments that strongly increase MEK/ERK activation and collagen expression in NLF do not affect MEK/ERK activation and collagen expression in SLF. Similar signaling pathways appear to regulate collagen expression in vivo as evidenced by the fact that fibrotic lung tissue from bleomycin-treated mice contains very high levels of activated MEK and ERK and very low levels of PKCα and caveolin-1. Although MEK/ERK signaling also regulates collagen expression in dermal fibroblasts, the other branches of this signaling pathway must differ in dermal and lung fibroblasts given that the relative levels of expression of PKCϵ, PKCα, and caveolin-1 are very different in NLF, SLF, normal dermal fibroblasts (NDF), and scleroderma dermal fibroblasts (SDF). In summary, these results reveal a complex signaling pathway that regulates collagen expression in the lung under normal conditions and that is perturbed when collagen is overexpressed in both in vitro and in vivo models of lung fibrosis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell CultureFibroblasts were derived from lung tissue obtained at autopsy from scleroderma patients (SLF) and from age-, race-, and sex-matched normal subjects (NLF) and cultured as previously described (12.Tourkina E.

Fibroblasts were also obtained by punch biopsy from the skin of scleroderma patients and age-, race-, and sex-matched normal subjects and cultured as previously described (23.Gore-Hyer E. Pannu J.

The harvesting of tissue was approved by the Medical University of South Carolina IRB for Human Research.Perturbation of Signaling Protein Expression/ActivityMEK Activity—To inhibit MEK activity, cells were treated with U0126 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). When cell cultures became nearly confluent, they were shifted to serum-free medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/50 μm ascorbic acid/2 mm l-glutamine/50 μg/ml gentamycin sulfate). The next morning the medium was again replaced with serum-free medium alone or containing 10 μm U0126. After an additional 3-h incubation, the culture medium and cell layer were harvested.PKC Expression/Activity—To inhibit the expression of various isoforms of PKC, cells were treated with appropriate antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) and control sense ODN for 48 h as described previously (11.Tourkina E. Hoffman S. Fenton II, J.W. Lipsitz S. Silver R.M. Ludwicka-Bradley A. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 1370-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and then shifted to serum-free medium. The next morning the culture medium and cell layer were harvested. Phosphorothioated ODN were synthesized in the Oligonucleotide Synthesis Facility at the Medical University of South Carolina.PKC expression/activity were also perturbed by overexpressing constitutively active (c-a) and dominant negative (d-n) forms of PKCϵ and PKCα in cells. Cells were incubated for 48 h with FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics) according to manufacturer's instructions (1 μg of each plasmid/well in 6-well plates) as described previously (12.Tourkina E. Gooz P. Oats J.C. Ludwiscka-Bradley A. Silver R.M. Hoffman S. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; 31: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and then shifted to serum-free medium. The next morning the culture medium and cell layer were harvested. When U0126 treatment and PKC construct transfection were combined, an additional 3-h incubation in fresh serum-free medium alone or containing 10 μm U0126 was performed prior to the harvesting of the medium and cell layer. PKCϵ constructs ϵA159E (c-a) and Kn-ϵA159E (d-n) in the SRD vector were a kind gift of Dr. Shigeo Ohno, Yokohama City University School of Medicine, Japan (24.Ueda Y. Hirai S. Osada S. Suzuki A.

Empty vectors were used in control experiments.Caveolin-1 Expression—Caveolin-1 expression was inhibited using short inhibitory RNA (siRNA) synthesized as double-stranded oligoribonucleotides by MWG Biotech (High Point, NC). siRNA was designed to target the human caveolin-1 sequence 5′-AACGATGACGTGGTCAAGATT. Cells in 6-well plates at 50–60% confluency were incubated with 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum lacking antibiotics and containing l2 μl of Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) in the presence or absence of 40 pmol of caveolin-1 siRNA. After 48 h, the cells were shifted to serum-free medium. The next morning the culture medium and cell layer were harvested.Western Blot AnalysesCell layers were extracted with boiling SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Concentrated SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to the culture medium. Aliquots of culture medium or of cell layer extract representing material derived from the same number of cells were probed using the following primary antibodies and appropriate secondary antibodies: culture medium, goat anti-human collagen I (AB758P) from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA); rabbit polyclonal anti-PKCα (sc-208), anti-PKCϵ (sc-214), and anti-caveolin-1 (sc-864) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); rabbit polyclonal anti-ERK 1/2 (9102), anti-activated ERK 1/2 (9106), anti-MEK 1/2 (9122), and anti-activated MEK 1/2 (9121) from Cell Signaling; and mouse monoclonal anti-actin (MAB1501) from Chemicon International.Immunocytochemistry and Laser Confocal MicroscopyNLF and SLF were cultured in 4-well glass chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) and labeled as described previously (12.Tourkina E. Gooz P. Oats J.C. Ludwiscka-Bradley A. Silver R.M. Hoffman S. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; 31: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) using rabbit anti-caveolin-1 (see above) as the primary antibody. Nuclei were stained using 0.01% 7-aminoactinomycin D (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). For Fig. 6, images were captured using a Zeiss 510SML Laser Confocal Microscope, excitation at 488 nm, and an oil-immersion objective (63×/1.4).Bleomycin-induced Lung FibrosisThe following procedure was approved by the Medical University of South Carolina Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. 10-week-old male CD-1 mice (Charles River, Boston, MA) were anesthetized and received bleomycin (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) or saline solution by intratracheal instillation as described previously (12.Tourkina E. Gooz P. Oats J.C. Ludwiscka-Bradley A. Silver R.M. Hoffman S. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; 31: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). After 21 days, mice were sacrificed, and their lungs removed, fixed, and sectioned for immunohistochemical analysis using rabbit anti-caveolin-1 and for histochemical analysis using Masson's trichrome stain or homogenized for Western blot analyses as described previously (12.Tourkina E. Gooz P. Oats J.C. Ludwiscka-Bradley A. Silver R.M. Hoffman S. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; 31: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). 25 μg of total protein from each homogenate was resolved by SDS-PAGE and Western blotted using the antibodies against ERK 1/2, activated ERK 1/2, MEK 1/2, activated MEK 1/2, PKCα, and caveolin-1 as described above.RESULTSERK Activation Regulates Collagen Expression by Both NLF and SLFERK1 and -2 (p42 and p44) are kinases that are activated when they are phosphorylated by either of two related kinases, MEK1 and MEK2. Despite the fact that ERK1/2 play central roles in signaling in a vast number of biological systems, there are few, if any, reports relating ERK signaling to collagen type I (hereafter referred to as collagen) expression in NLF and examining whether the overexpression of collagen by SLF may be related to ERK signaling. To directly test the idea that ERK activation regulates collagen expression, cells were treated with the MEK1/2 inhibitor, U0126. This treatment caused a parallel inhibition in ERK phosphorylation and in collagen accumulation in both NLF and SLF cultures (Fig. 1), demonstrating that the activation of ERK by MEK is an upstream regulator of collagen expression in both types of cells.Fig. 1ERK activation regulates collagen accumulation in NLF and SLF. Serum-starved NLF and SLF were incubated for an additional 3 h in fresh serum-free medium containing (+) or lacking (-) the MEK inhibitor U0126. The levels of collagen in the culture medium and of ph-ERK and actin (loading control) in the cell layer were determined by Western blotting. Representative data are shown from one of three independent experiments performed using distinct matched strains of NLF and SLF. Quantification of the data showed no more than a 20% difference between experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Endogenous Levels of Activated MEK and ERK Are Much Higher in SLF than in NLFTo evaluate whether the overexpression of collagen by SLF may be related to altered ERK signaling, we compared ERK levels and activation (phosphorylation) in NLF and SLF (Fig. 2). We found that phosphorylated ERK levels are nearly twice as high in SLF than in NLF, even though total ERK levels are only ∼60% as high in SLF as in NLF. Thus ERK polypeptides are about three times as likely to be active in SLF than in NLF. Because MEK is a kinase that activates ERK, we also compared MEK levels and activation in NLF and SLF (Fig. 2). Although total MEK levels were slightly lower in SLF than in NLF, phosphorylated MEK levels were more than twice as high in SLF than in NLF. In summary, we find that the MEK/ERK signaling pathway is hyperactivated in SLF resulting in the overexpression of collagen by these cells.Fig. 2MEK/ERK phosphorylation and protein levels are different in NLF and SLF. A, the levels of ph-ERK, ERK, ph-MEK, MEK, and actin (loading control) in the cell layers of serum-starved NLF and SLF were determined by Western blotting. B, densitometric quantification of relative ERK, ph-ERK, MEK, ph-MEK, and actin levels in NLF and SLF. The level of each protein in NLF was defined as 100 arbitrary units. These data represent the average ± S.D. of three independent experiments performed using distinct matched strains of NLF and SLF. Quantification of the data showed no more than a 20% difference between experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Opposing Roles for PKCα and PKCϵ in Collagen AccumulationTo extend the signaling cascade linking MEK, ERK, and collagen expression to kinases further upstream, we examined several PKC isoforms. In these experiments, we inhibited PKC expression using antisense oligonucleotides and read out the effects of these treatments on the expression of the targeted PKC isoform and on the expression of collagen. The ability of antisense, but not sense, oligonucleotides to inhibit the expression of PKCα, PKCδ, and PKCϵ in NLF is shown in Fig. 3. When the level of collagen secretion into the medium in these cultures was examined (Fig. 3), we found that depletion of PKCα increased collagen accumulation, depletion of PKCϵ inhibited collagen accumulation, and depletion of PKCδ had no effect. Similar results were obtained with both NLF (Fig. 3) and SLF (data not shown).Fig. 3Effect of antisense ODN-mediated depletion of particular PKC isoforms on collagen accumulation. NLF were incubated with no ODN (-), sense ODN (s), or antisense ODN (as) targeting the indicated PKC isoform. The levels of collagen in the culture medium and the targeted PKC isoform and actin (loading control) in the cell layer were determined by Western blotting. Representative data are shown from one of three independent experiments performed using distinct strains of NLF. Quantification of the data showed no more than a 20% difference between experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm and extend these observations, NLF were transfected with vectors encoding d-n and c-a PKCα and PKCϵ and the effects of these treatments on PKC expression, ERK expression and activation, and collagen expression were determined (Fig. 4). In all cases, the overexpression of d-n or c-a PKCα or PKCϵ was apparent (Fig. 4, A–C). Consistent with the results obtained using antisense oligonucleotides, overexpression of d-n PKCα increased collagen accumulation in the culture medium, whereas overexpression of c-a PKCα inhibited collagen accumulation in the culture medium (Fig. 4A). Consistent with the idea that ERK activation promotes collagen expression, d-n PKCα increased ERK phosphorylation, whereas c-a PKCα inhibited ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 4). Neither of these treatments affected total ERK levels. Similar results using c-a and d-n PKCα to affect collagen accumulation and ERK activation were obtained with both NLF (Fig. 4A) and SLF (data not shown).Fig. 4Effects of c-a and d-n PKCα and PKCϵ on ERK activation and collagen expression. Cells were transfected with empty vector or with vector containing c-a or d-n PKCα or PKCϵ, then serum-starved overnight. A, NLF transfected with empty vector, c-a PKCα,ord-n PKCα. B, NLF transfected with empty vector, c-a PKCϵ, or d-n PKCϵ. C, SLF transfected with empty vector, c-a PKCϵ, or d-n PKCϵ. D, NLF transfected with empty vector, c-a PKCϵ, or d-n PKCα. Serum-starved cells were incubated for an additional 3 h in fresh serum-free medium containing (+) or lacking (-) the MEK inhibitor U0126. The levels of collagen in the culture medium and the targeted PKC isoform, activated ERK, ERK, and actin (loading control) in the cell layer were determined by Western blotting. Representative data are shown from one of three independent experiments performed using distinct strains of NLF or SLF. Quantification of the data showed no more than a 20% difference between experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Also consistent with results obtained using antisense oligonucleotides, overexpression of d-n PKCϵ inhibited collagen accumulation in both NLF (Fig. 4B) and SLF (Fig. 4C). Further supporting the idea that ERK activation promotes collagen expression, d-n PKCϵ inhibited total ERK expression and ERK phosphorylation in both NLF (Fig. 4B) and SLF (Fig. 4C). In contrast, NLF and SLF responded differently to overexpression of c-a PKCϵ. Although overexpression of c-a PKCϵ increased both ERK phosphorylation and collagen expression in NLF cultures (Fig. 4B), this treatment did not affect the already high levels of both ERK phosphorylation and collagen expression observed in SLF cultures (Fig. 4C). The overexpression of c-a PKCϵ had no effect on total ERK expression in either NLF or SLF. In summary, these observations further support the idea that ERK phosphorylation and collagen expression are tightly linked. In accord with our previous studies (11.Tourkina E. Hoffman S.

We recently isolated Manduca sexta serpin-6 from hemolymph of the bacteria-challenged larvae, which selectively inhibited proPO-activating proteinase-3 (PAP-3) (Wang, Y., and Jiang, H. (2004) Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 34, 387–395). To further characterize its structure and function, we cloned serpin-6 from an induced fat body cDNA library using a PCR-derived probe. M. sexta serpin-6 is 55% similar in amino acid sequence to Drosophila melanogaster serpin-5, an immune-responsive protein. We produced serpin-6 in an Escherichia coli expression system and purified the soluble protein by nickel affinity and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. The recombinant protein specifically inhibited PAP-3 and blocked proPO activation in vitro in a concentration-dependent manner. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry indicated that the cleavage site of serpin-6 is between Arg373 and Ser374. Serpin-6 is constitutively present in hemolymph of naïve larvae, and its mRNA and protein levels significantly increase after a bacterial injection. The association rate constant of serpin-6 and PAP-3 is 2.6 × 104m−1 s−1, indicating that serpin-6 may contribute to the inhibitory regulation of PAP-3 in the hemolymph. We also identified the covalent complex of serpin-6 and PAP-3 in induced hemolymph by immunoaffinity chromatography and mass spectrometry. Furthermore, immulectin-2, serine proteinase homologs, proPO, PO, attacin-2, and a complex of serpin-6 and hemolymph proteinase-8 were also detected in the proteins eluted from the immunoaffinity column using serpin-6 antibody. These results suggest that serpin-6 plays important roles in the regulation of immune proteinases in the hemolymph.

Proteolytic activation of prophenoloxidase (proPO) in insects is mediated by a largely unknown serine proteinase pathway triggered by microbial surface molecules, such as lipopolysaccharide, peptidoglycan, and β-1,3-glucan (3.Ashida M.

D. melanogaster Spn43Ac, which controls a putative serine proteinase cascade for the Toll pathway activation, also affects melanin deposition (33.Levashina E.A. Langley E. Green C. Gubb D. Ashburner M. Hoffmann J.A. Reichhart J.M. Science. 1999; 285: 1917-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Recently, we partially purified a new serpin (serpin-6) from M. sexta hemolymph (1.Wang Y. Jiang H. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 34: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It regulated proPO activation by forming high Mr, SDS-stable complex with PAP-3 in vitro. However, M. sexta serpin-6 did not strongly inhibit PAP-1 or PAP-2. Here, we report the cDNA cloning of M. sexta serpin-6 and its recombinant expression in Escherichia coli. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that recombinant serpin-6 inhibited PAP-3 efficiently. The mRNA and protein levels of serpin-6 were upregulated in hemocytes and fat body after a bacterial challenge. Moreover, we characterized the hemolymph proteins bound to serpin-6. Insects and Collection of Hemolymph, Hemocytes, and Fat Body— M. sexta eggs were purchased from Carolina Biological Supply, and the larvae were reared as described previously (34.Dunn P. Drake D. J. Invert. Pathol. 1983; 41: 77-85Crossref Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Day 2 fifth instar larvae were injected with 1 × 107 E. coli cells, or 0.1 mg Micrococcus luteus suspended in 50 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. Hemolymph and fat body samples were collected at 12 and 24 h after the microbial challenge. Cloning of Serpin-6 cDNA Fragments by PCR—To isolate M. sexta serpin-6 cDNA, degenerate primers (j801–j810) were designed based on its internal peptide sequences (1.Wang Y. Jiang H. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 34: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) for PCR amplification of the serpin cDNA fragments. Primers j801 (5′-GGT GTC ACW AAY ATH ATH GC-3′) and j802 (5′-GTT CAG GTT IGC DAT DAT RTT-3′) encode peptide 1 (EGVTNIIANLNTER); primers j803 (5′-GAC TCC TAY GAR TTY CAN AC-3′) and j804 (5′-GTC GGA GTT GTT RTT NGT CAT-3′) encode peptide 2 (MTNXNSDSYEFTTANK); primers j805 (5′-GTC ATG GAG GAA WSN TAY ATG-3′) and j806 (5′-CAT GTA GGA YTC YTC CAT NAC-3′) encode peptide 3 (LAAVMEESYMSR); primers j807 (5′-AAG AAG GAA CCI TTY TTY GT-3′) and j808 (5′-ACG AAG AAG GGY TCY TTY TT-3′) encode peptide 4 (TKKEPFVSSETR); primers j809 (5′-GAC TGT GTC TCI GAR TTY CAN AA-3′) and j810 (5′-GGT GAA TTC GGA NAC RCA RTC-3′) encode peptide 5 (LLPADCVSEFTK). The PCR reactions contained 5 μl of buffer, 5 μl of dNTPs (2.5 mm each), 2.5 μl of MgCl2 (25 mm), a pair of degenerate primers (25 pmol each), 10 ng of λDNA from the induced M. sexta larval fat body cDNA library (7.Jiang H. Wang Y. Yu X.Q. Kanost M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3552-3561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), TaqDNA polymerase (5 units, Promega), and H2O to bring the total volume up to 50 μl. Thermal cycling conditions were: 94 °C, 3 min and 35 cycles of 94 °C, 30 s; 50 °C, 40 s; and 72 °C, 60 s. After electrophoresis, PCR products were excised and recovered from the agarose gel using QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). The fragments were individually ligated with pGem-T vector and transformed into high efficiency E. coli JM109 competent cells (Promega). Plasmid DNAs were isolated from resulting transformants and sequenced using BigDye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit (PE Applied Biosystems) and vector-specific primers. Isolation of Full-length Serpin-6 cDNA by Library Screening— Once confirmed by BLAST search to be serpin cDNA fragments, the inserts in the PCR-derived clones were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Multiprime DNA labeling system, Amersham Biosciences) and utilized as probes to screen the cDNA library in λZAP2 (Stratagene). Positive plaques were purified to homogeneity and subcloned by in vivo excision of pBluescript phagemids. Complete nucleotide sequences were determined as described above. Sequence comparison was performed using ClustalW 1.7 program from MacVector 6.5 software (Genetics Computer Group, 1998). Expression and Purification of Soluble Serpin-6 from E. coli Cells— To amplify a cDNA fragment encoding the mature serpin-6, a PCR reaction was performed using forward primer (j815: 5′-TAA CCA TGG AAT GTT TCT CC-3′) and reverse primer (j816: 5′-TAT GCA TGC TTA TTT CTT AGG GT-3′). The PCR product was digested with NcoI-SphI and cloned into the same sites in plasmid H6pQE60 (35.Wang Y. Jiang H. Kanost M.R. Protein Expression Purif. 2001; 23: 328-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The resulting recombinant plasmid, serpin-6/H6pQE60, was sequenced to confirm correct insertion and sequence. The expression, extraction, and affinity purification of serpin-6 were performed under nondenaturing conditions as previously described (29.Jiang H. Kanost M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1082-1087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 35.Wang Y. Jiang H. Kanost M.R. Protein Expression Purif. 2001; 23: 328-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The recombinant protein eluted from nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) was adjusted with ammonium sulfate to a final concentration of 1.0 m. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min, the cleared protein solution was separated by hydrophobic interaction chromatography on a 5-ml phenyl-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted at 1.0 ml/min for 40 min with a linear, descending gradient of 1.0–0 m ammonium sulfate in 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.4. Concentration and buffer exchange of the serpin-6 fractions were performed in a Centriprep-30 (Millipore). The purified protein was stored at -70 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. A rabbit polyclonal antiserum was prepared against the recombinant serpin (Cocalico Biologicals Inc.). Inhibition of PAP-3 Amidase Activity by M. sexta Serpin-6 —PAP-3 and its cofactor were purified from the prepupal hemolymph (8.Jiang H. Wang Y. Yu X.Q. Zhu Y. Kanost M. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 33: 1049-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 10.Wang Y. Jiang H. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 34: 731-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Purified PAP-3 (100 ng/μl, 1 μl) and serpin-6 (150 ng/μl) were individually mixed in microplate wells. The total reaction volume was adjusted to 12 μl with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. After incubation at room temperature for 10 min, the residual amidase activity was measured using 150 μl, 50 μm acetyl-Ile-Glu-Ala-Arg-p-nitroanilide (IEARpNA) (7.Jiang H. Wang Y. Yu X.Q. Kanost M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3552-3561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Inhibition of ProPO Activation by PAP-3 and SPHs—ProPO was purified from M. sexta larval hemolymph as described before (36.Jiang H. Wang Y. Ma C. Kanost M.R. Insect Biochem. Mol Biol. 1997; 27: 835-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Purified PAP-3 (100 ng/μl, 1 μl), SPHs (50 ng/μl, 1 μl), serpin-6 (150 ng/μl, 10 μl), and buffer (7.4 μl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) were preincubated at room temperature for 10 min. In a control, serpin-6 was replaced with the buffer (10 μl). ProPO (10 μl, 10 μg/ml) was separately added to the wells, and the reaction mixtures were then placed on ice for 1 h. A mixture of proPO (10 μl) and buffer (20 μl) was used as another control. PO activity was determined using dopamine as a substrate (7.Jiang H. Wang Y. Yu X.Q. Kanost M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3552-3561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Inhibition of ProPO Activation by Serpin-6 in a Fraction of the Larval Hemolymph—The induced hemolymph was fractionated with 0–50% saturation of ammonium sulfate to obtain the proPO activation system (29.Jiang H. Kanost M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1082-1087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Recombinant serpin-6 (10 μl, at final concentrations of 0–150 μg/ml) was incubated with the plasma fraction (10 μl, 1:5 diluted in H2O) in the presence of M. luteus (1 μl, 1 μg/μl). As controls, 10 μl of buffer or the fraction without M. luteus were added individually and incubated at room temperature for 10 min prior to the PO activity assay. Kinetic Inhibition Assay—A progressive curve method was employed to determine the association rate constant (37.Askew D.J. Askew Y.S. Kato Y. Luke C.J. Pak S.C. Brömme D. Silverman G.A. Genomics. 2004; 84: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Purified PAP-3 (1.8 μm) was mixed with IEARpNA solutions containing serpin-6 at different molar ratios. Absorbance at 405 nm was monitored in the kinetic mode on a tunable VERSAmax microplate reader (Molecular Devices). The progressive curves were first analyzed according to Equation 1: p = Vz/k(1 - e−kt), where k is the pseudo-first-order rate constant of inhibition, and Vz is the initial velocity. The experimental values were fit into the equation using Prism 3.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). From the plot of k versus [I], ka was derived from a linear regression analysis of the data according to Equation 2: k = ka[I]/(1 + [S]/Km). For calculating in vivo half-lives of PAP-3, t½ = 1/(ka[I]), in naïve and induced larval hemolymph, the plasma concentrations of serpin-6 were estimated by SDS-PAGE, immunoblot analysis, and densitometry using the purified recombinant serpin-6 as a standard (35.Wang Y. Jiang H. Kanost M.R. Protein Expression Purif. 2001; 23: 328-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Detection of Serpin-Enzyme Complexes by Immunoblot Analysis— PAP-3 (1 μl, 100 μg/ml) and recombinant serpin-6 (2 μl, 100 μg/ml) were incubated at room temperature for 10 min and then treated with SDS reducing sample buffer at 95 °C for 5 min. SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis were performed as described previously (1.Wang Y. Jiang H. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 34: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Determination of Cleavage Site in Serpin-6 —PAP-3 (12 μl, 100 μg/ml) was mixed with serpin-6 (12 μl, 280 μg/ml) for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction mixture was subjected to MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (8.Jiang H. Wang Y. Yu X.Q. Zhu Y. Kanost M. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 33: 1049-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The molecular mass of a peak that was absent in the control spectra of serpin-6 and PAP-3 was compared with calculated values of carboxyl-terminal peptides to deduce the cleavage site in serpin-6. RNA Extraction and Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—Total RNA samples were extracted from fat body and hemocytes of naïve and induced M. sexta larvae using Micro-to-Midi total RNA purification system (Invitrogen). First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using 2–4 μg total RNA, 10 pmol oligo(dT)17, and 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 1 h. M. sexta ribosomal protein S3 cDNA was used as an internal standard to normalize the templates in a preliminary PCR experiment. After template adjustment, PCRs were performed to detect relative levels of serpin-6 cDNA. The primers used were j812 (5′-TGA TGA CTG CGT ATA AGG TA-3′) and j820 (5′-CTT CTC GAC TCA TGT AGC TCT CT-3′) for serpin-6 and k504 (5′-CGC GAG TTG ACT TCG GT-3′) and k501 (5′ GCC GTT CTT GCC CTG TT-3′) for ribosomal protein S3. The thermal cycling conditions were: 94 °C, 30 s; 50 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 60 s. PCR cycle numbers were empirically chosen to show comparable band intensity and avoid saturation. After separation by 1.3% agarose gel electrophoresis, intensities of the PCR products were quantified using Kodak Digital Science one-dimensional gel analysis software (35.Wang Y. Jiang H. Kanost M.R. Protein Expression Purif. 2001; 23: 328-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Immunoaffinity Chromatography and MALDI-TOF Mass Fingerprint Analysis—To couple serpin-6 antibodies to protein A-Sepharose, 4.8 ml of the rabbit antiserum, 2.4 ml of resin (Sigma), and 19.2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline were incubated at room temperature for 1 h with gentle shaking. The resin was washed with 10 volumes of 0.2 m sodium borate, pH 9.0, and reacted with dimethylpimelimidate at a final concentration to 20 mm. After 2 h, 0.2 m ethanolamine, pH 8.0, was added to terminate the coupling reaction for another 2 h. For isolating serpin-6-proteinase complexes, 15 ml of cell-free hemolymph was collected from naïve or bacteria-injected larvae (fifth instar, day 3). M. luteus, diethylthiocarbonate, and 1-phenyl-2-thiourea were added to the plasma at final concentrations of 1 μg/μl, 10 mm, and 1 mm, respectively, to activate the serine proteinase system yet prevent hemolymph melanization. After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and 0.5 ml proteinase inhibitor mixture (Sigma catalog number P-8849) were added to block the proteinases in the activated hemolymph for 10 min. The plasma samples were centrifuged at 5000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to separate debris from the supernatant. After binding with the affinity matrix (1.0 ml) for 8 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation, the unbound proteins were removed by loading the suspension into an empty Poly-Prep column (Bio-Rad). The resin was sequentially washed with 20 ml, 1 m NaCl, and 20 ml, pH 6.8, 10 mm sodium phosphate to reduce nonspecific binding. Bound proteins were eluted with 50 mm glycine HCl, pH 2.5, and the fractions (0.5 ml) were neutralized with 50 μl, 1.0 m sodium phosphate, pH 8.0. The affinity-purified proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, immunoblot, and peptide mass fingerprint analyses (10.Wang Y. Jiang H. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 34: 731-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The mass profiles were analyzed using Mascot (matrixscience.com/) to identify significant matches in GenBank. The monoisotopic peptide masses were also compared with the theoretical masses of M. sexta hemolymph proteinases, 2H. Jiang, Y. Wang, Y. Gu, X. Guo, Z. Zou, F. Scholz, T. E. Trenczek, and M. R. Kanost, unpublished data. predicted by MS-digest (prospector.ucsf.edu/). Molecular Cloning and Structural Features of M. sexta Serpin-6 —We designed degenerate primers encoding five internal peptides of M. sexta serpin-6 (1.Wang Y. Jiang H. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 34: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Because the order of these peptides was unknown, we used different combinations of the primers to amplify cDNA fragments by PCR and cloned the products. Sequence analysis confirmed the cDNA inserts encoded different regions of a serpin. Using the longest one (642 bp, amplified by j802 and j803) as a probe, we screened ∼6 × 105 plaques in an induced M. sexta fat body cDNA library and identified 78 positives. We carried out plaque purification and in vivo excision for five of the positive clones. Complete sequence analysis indicated that their cDNA inserts were 1.5 or 2.1 kb. The long form contained an additional 0.6-kb sequence in the 3′-untranslated region (Fig. 1). A polyadenylation signal at the end of the coding region is probably responsible for the short transcript. We identified eight nucleotide substitutions in the open reading frames, one of which was nonsynonymous; Thr109 is replaced by Asn109. Such nucleotide differences may represent allelic variations in the serpin-6 gene. The longest cDNA contains a complete open reading frame spanning nucleotides 113–1531. Its corresponding protein is 412 residues long and includes the five peptide sequences of M. sexta serpin-6 (Fig. 1). Following a predicted 17-residue secretion peptide, the mature protein starts with a Gln, consistent with the observation that serpin-6 is blocked at the amino terminus (1.Wang Y. Jiang H.

We reported that incubation of purified canine parietal cells with epidermal growth factor (EGF) for 6–16 h, stimulates H+/K+-ATPase α-subunit gene expression through the activation of Akt. We explored if Shh mediates some of the actions of EGF in the parietal cells. EGF induced a 6-fold increase in Shh expression, measured by Western blots, after 5 h of incubation. This effect was inhibited by both the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 and by transduction of the cells with an adenoviral vector expressing dominant negative Akt. EGF stimulated the release of Shh-like immunoreactivity from the parietal cells, after 16 h of incubation. Shh induced H+/K+-ATPase α-subunit gene expression, assessed by Northern blots, it stimulated a luciferase reporter plasmid containing the EGF-responsive sequence (ERE) of the canine H+/K+-ATPase α-subunit gene promoter, and it induced parietal cell nuclear protein binding to the ERE. Gli transcription factors mediate the intracellular actions of Shh. Co-transfection of the parietal cells with the H+/K+-luc plasmid together with one expressing Gli2, induced H+/K+-luciferase activity 5-fold, whereas co-transfection of the cells with the H+/K+-luc plasmid together with one expressing dominant negative Gli2, inhibited EGF induction of H+/K+-luciferase activity. Identical results were observed in the presence of the Shh signal transduction pathway inhibitor, cyclopamine. Transfection of the cells with dominant negative Akt inhibited EGF, but not Shh stimulation of H+/K+-ATPase-luciferase activity. Thus, EGF but not Shh signals through Akt. Preincubation of the cells for 16 h with either Shh or EGF enhanced histamine-stimulated [14C]aminopyrine uptake by 50%. In conclusions, some of the actions of EGF in the parietal cells are mediated by the sequential activation of the Akt and the Shh signal transduction pathways. These effects might represent novel mechanisms mediating the actions of growth factors on gastric epithelial cell differentiation.

The intracellular signal transduction pathways that mediate the multiple, complex actions of growth factors in the stomach have been only partially elucidated. We have recently reported that, in the canine gastric parietal cells, EGF stimulates H+, K+-ATPase α-subunit gene expression and it enhances secretagogue-stimulated gastric acid secretion, through a signal transduction pathway that requires, at least in part, the activation of Akt (9Todisco A.

The specific intracellular targets of the Akt signal transduction pathway in the stomach are currently not known. Sonic, Indian, and Desert hedgehog (Shh) are members of the family of the Hedgehog proteins, peptides known to exert important regulatory functions in patterning and growth in a large number of tissues during embryogenesis (17Ruizi Altaba A.

The intracellular mechanisms that mediate the actions of Shh on target cells have been only partially understood. According to recent investigations, Shh appears to bind to a transmembrane receptor protein, known as patched (Ptc) which, in the absence of Shh, exerts an inhibitory effect on the seven transmembrane receptor smoothened (Smo). Binding of Shh to Ptc blocks the inhibitory effect of Ptc on Smo. Once activated, Smo induces a complex series of intracellular reactions that targets the Gli family of transcription factors (17Ruizi Altaba A. Sanchez P Dahmane N. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 18Goetz J.A. Suber L.M. Zeng X. Robbins D.J. BioEssays. 2002; 24: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 23Nybakken K.

Development. 1999; 126: 3915-3924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At least three members of this family of nuclear proteins have been identified in mammalian tissues (17Ruizi Altaba A. Sanchez P Dahmane N. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 24Sasaki H. Nishizaki Y. Hui C. Nakafuku M. Kondoh H. Development. 1999; 126: 3915-3924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although Gli1 and Gli2 are transcriptional activators, Gli3 seems to function primarily as a transcriptional repressor (17Ruizi Altaba A. Sanchez P Dahmane N. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 24Sasaki H. Nishizaki Y. Hui C. Nakafuku M. Kondoh H. Development. 1999; 126: 3915-3924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gli2 appears to be the principal effector of Shh signaling, because disruption of the Gli2 gene leads to developmental defects involving several Shh target tissues, while Gli1 null mice are born without detectable abnormalities (17Ruizi Altaba A.

Taken together, these observations underscore the importance of the parietal cells in the regulation of complex programs of cellular growth and differentiation in the gastric mucosa. Accordingly, we took advantage of a well established system based on primary cultures of highly purified canine gastric parietal cells to study the function and regulation of Shh in the stomach. In addition, we investigated if the stimulatory actions of EGF on parietal cell maturation and differentiation are mediated by the activation of the Shh signal transduction pathway. Adenoviral Vectors and Plasmids—The replication defective adenoviral vector expressing hemagglutinin-tagged, dominant negative Akt 1(with serine 473 and threonine 308 mutated to alanine, Ad.dn-Akt) under the control of the CMV promoter, was a gift of K.

Soderling (Portland, OR). Primary Parietal Cell Preparation and Culture—For preparation of primary parietal cells we utilized a modification of the method of Soll et al. (43Soll A.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1978; 61: 370-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 44Chew C.S. Ljungstrom M. Smolka A. Brown M.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: G254-G263PubMed Google Scholar, 45Muraoka A. Kaise M.

The mucosal layer of freshly obtained canine gastric fundus was bluntly separated from the submucosa and rinsed in Hank's balanced salt solution containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The cells were dispersed by sequential exposure to collagenase (0.35 mg/ml) and 1 mm EDTA and parietal cells were enriched by centrifugal elutriation using a Beckman JE-6B elutriation rotor. Elutriator fractions 8 and 9, which contain up to 70% parietal cells as determined by hematoxylin and eosin and periodic acid-Shiff reagent staining, were further purified by centrifugation through density gradients generated by 50% Percoll (Amersham Biosciences) at 30,000 × g for 20 min. The cell fraction at ρ = 1.05 consisted of virtually all parietal cells as determined by staining with an anti-H+, K+-ATPase α-subunit monoclonal antibody (MBL, Nagoya, Japan). The isolated parietal cells (2 × 106 cells/well) were cultured according to the method of Chew et al. with some modifications (44Chew C.S. Ljungstrom M. Smolka A. Brown M.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: G254-G263PubMed Google Scholar, 45Muraoka A. Kaise M. Guo Y. Yamada J. Song I. Del Valle J. Todisco A. Yamada T. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G1104-G1113PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were cultured in Ham's F-12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1:1) containing 0.1 mg/ml gentamycin, 50 units/ml penicillin G, 0.01 mg/ml ciprofloxacin, and 2% Me2SO (Sigma) on 6-well culture dishes (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) coated with 150 μl of H2O-diluted (1:5) growth factor reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences). For our studies, the parietal cells were incubated, according to the experiments, with EGF (10 nm, BD Biosciences), histamine (100 μm, Sigma), and recombinant Shh amino-terminal peptide (0.1–0.5 μg/ml, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for various time periods. In some experiments, LY294002 (10 μm, Calbiochem) and cyclopamine (1 μm, Toronto Research Chemicals, North York, Ontario, Canada) were added 30 min prior to the addition of the stimulants. LY294002 and cyclopamine were dissolved in Me2SO; all other test substances were dissolved in water. Control experiments with untreated cells were performed by incubating the cells in either vehicle (0.1% Me2SO) or incubation buffer without the test substances. The parietal cells were transduced, when indicated, with a multiplicity of infection of 100 of adenoviral vectors expressing either dominant negative Akt or β-galactosidase. Northern Blot Analysis—The parietal cells were lysed with TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Northern blot hybridization assays were performed as previously described (47Nagahara A. Wang L. Del Valle J. Todisco A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G740-G748Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Equal amounts of each RNA sample, with ethidium bromide (10 mg/ml) in a final volume of 20 μl, were electrophoresed on a 1.25% agarose gel containing formaldehyde, and the RNA was transferred from the gel to nitrocellulose filters. The ethidium-stained ribosomal RNA bands in the gel were photographed before and after transfer to ensure that equivalent amounts of RNA were loaded onto each lane and that no residual RNA was left on the gel. The canine H+, K+-ATPase α-subunit cDNA probe was a gift of Il Song (University of Michigan). The human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe was obtained from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). The cDNAs were labeled with [32P]dCTP by the random priming procedure, and the nitrocellulose filters were hybridized to the 32P-labeled cDNA probes as previously described (47Nagahara A. Wang L. Del Valle J. Todisco A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G740-G748Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection of Primary Cultured Parietal Cells—The parietal cells were transfected according to previously reported techniques (7Kaise M. Muraoka A. Yamada J. Yamada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18637-18642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 45Muraoka A. Kaise M. Guo Y. Yamada J. Song I. Del Valle J. Todisco A. Yamada T. Am. J.

Before transfection the cells were washed once with 1 ml of Opti-MEM I serum-reduced media (Invitrogen) and fed with 400 μl of Opti-MEM I media supplemented with 2% Me2SO. The cells were transfected with the luciferase reporter plasmids (3 μg of HK(–619 + 35)-Luc, 2 μg of 8X3′Gli-BS-Luc, 5 μg of ERE-HK(–54 + 34)-Luc and 2 μg of SRE-Luc) and, where indicated, with different amounts of the expression vectors (1 μg of dnAkt, 1 μg of Gli2ΔC4, 0.75 μg of Gli2, 0.25 μg of pCMV-βGal). Control experiments were conducted in the presence of the empty vectors. Transfections were carried out using Lipofectin (Invitrogen) as previously described (7Kaise M. Muraoka A. Yamada J. Yamada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18637-18642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 45Muraoka A. Kaise M. Guo Y. Yamada J. Song I. Del Valle J. Todisco A. Yamada T. Am. J.

The day after transfection the cells were fed with fresh media and stimulated with the test substances. At the end of the incubation period (16 h), the cells were washed twice with cold calcium-free PBS. After addition of 100 μl of cell lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm 1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100), the cells were incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The cells were then scraped and transferred to Eppendorf tubes. After quick centrifugation to pellet large debris, the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. An aliquot of cell lysate (20 μl) was mixed with 100 μl of luciferase assay reagent (20 mm Tricine, 1.07 mm (MgCO3)4Mg(OH)2·5H2O, 2.67 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 33.3 mm dithiothreitol, 270 μm coenzyme A, 470 μm luciferin, 530 μm ATP, final pH 7.8), and luminescent intensity was measured for 10 s utilizing a Lumat LB9501 luminometer (Berthold, Germany). Luciferase activity was expressed as RLU (relative light units) and normalized for β-galactosidase activity. β-Galactosidase activity was measured by the luminescent light derived from 10 μl of each sample incubated in 100 μl of Lumi-Gal 530 (Lumigen, Southfield, MI) and used to correct the luciferase assay data for transfection efficiency. Western Blots—The parietal cells were lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm Na4P2O7·10H2O, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride hydrochlorine (AEBSF, ICN-Biomedicals, Aurora, OH), 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). The cell homogenates were spun at 1000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were transferred to Eppendorf tubes. Protein concentrations were measured by the Bradford method (48Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (218585) Google Scholar). 80 μg of parietal cell lysates were mixed with 5× electrophoresis buffer (50% glycerol, 25% mercaptoethanol, 10% SDS, 0.3 m Tris (pH 6.8), 0.025% bromphenol blue), boiled for 5 min, and loaded on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide mini-gels, which were run at 200 V for 1 h. The gels were transferred on an Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) in 25 mm Tris, 150 mm glycine, 20% methanol. After transfer the membranes were blocked in 10 ml of TBST (20 mm Tris, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% Tween), 5% dry milk for 1 h and then incubated for 16–18 h at 4 °C in 10 ml of TBST, 5% dry milk, containing either specific anti-Shh (sc-1194 and sc-9024, which were raised against a recombinant protein mapping at the amino terminus of Shh (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-ptc antibodies (sc-9016, which was raised against a recombinant protein mapping at the carboxyl terminus of ptc, 1:250, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Control blots were performed using anti-actin antibodies (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). At the end of the incubation periods the membranes were washed in TBST for 30 min at room temperature and then incubated for 1 h in TBST, 5% dry milk, containing protein A directly conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:2500, Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were washed in TBST for 30 min at room temperature and then exposed to the Amersham Biosciences ECL detection system according to the manufacturer's instructions. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—For gel mobility shift assays, nuclear extracts from parietal cells were prepared using previously described techniques (7Kaise M. Muraoka A. Yamada J. Yamada T.

Extracts were stored at –80 °C, and protein concentrations were measured by the Bradford method using bovine serum albumin standards (48Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (218585) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide probe used to quantify the ERE-binding proteins present in the nuclear extracts was 5′-CTAGCAGACATGGCAGATC-3′ (7Kaise M. Muraoka A. Yamada J. Yamada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18637-18642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Labeling of the probe was performed using [32P]dATP and the T4 kinase reaction (45Muraoka A. Kaise M. Guo Y. Yamada J. Song I. Del Valle J. Todisco A. Yamada T. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G1104-G1113PubMed Google Scholar). The specificity of nuclear protein binding to the ERE probe was confirmed by competition with an unlabeled ERE probe. Gel shift mobility assays were performed as previously described (7Kaise M.

The mixture was preincubated, when indicated, at 25 °C for 10 min with unlabeled competitors, for 10 min with labeled probe and then resolved on a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio, 30:1). After pre-electrophoresis at 10 V/cm for 2 h, gels were run at 10 V/cm in 45 mm Tris base/45 mm boric acid/1 mm EDTA. The gels were dried prior to autoradiography at –80 °C. Amplification and Purification of Adenoviral Vectors—Briefly, the recombinant adenoviruses were amplified as previously described using HEK293 cells (39Askari F.K. Hitomi Y. Mao M. Wilson J.M. Gene Ther. 1996; 3: 381-388PubMed Google Scholar). The viruses were subsequently concentrated and purified on a cesium chloride gradient (39Askari F.K. Hitomi Y. Mao M. Wilson J.M. Gene Ther. 1996; 3: 381-388PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of the recombinant adenoviruses was assessed on the basis of the absorbance at 260 nm and on a limiting dilution plaque assay (39Askari F.K. Hitomi Y. Mao M. Wilson J.M. Gene Ther. 1996; 3: 381-388PubMed Google Scholar). Histochemistry—These studies were carried out according to previously reported methods with minor modifications (49Soroka C.J. Chew C.S. Hanzel D.K.

The molecular mechanisms underlying its resistance to chemotherapy remain unclear but are speculated to involve the dysregulation of apoptotic pathways. In this study, we sought to determine whether PUMA (p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis) contributes to human melanoma formation, tumor progression, and survival. We used tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry to examine PUMA expression in 107 primary melanomas, 51 metastatic melanomas, and 64 dysplastic nevi. Here we report that PUMA expression is significantly weaker in primary melanomas compared to dysplastic nevi (P<0.0001), and is further reduced in metastatic melanomas compared to primary tumors (P=0.001). We show that weak PUMA expression in melanoma correlates with poorer overall and disease-specific 5-year survival (P<0.005 and P<0.001, respectively) of melanoma patients and that PUMA expression in tumor tissue is an independent predictor of both overall and disease-specific 5-year survival (P=0.05). Additionally, we show that exogenous PUMA expression in human melanoma cell lines (both wild type and mutant p53) results in significant apoptotic cell death. Our results suggest that PUMA expression may be an important prognostic marker for human melanoma and that adenoviral delivery of PUMA sensitizes melanoma cells to apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2062655114,"Activating mutations of KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRA) are known to be alternative and mutually exclusive genetic events in the development of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). We examined the effect of the mutations of these two genes on the gene expression profile of 22 GISTs using the oligonucleotide microarray. Mutations of KIT and PDGFRA were found in 17 cases and three cases, respectively. The remaining two cases had no detectable mutations in either gene. The mutation status of KIT and PDGFRA was directly related to the expression levels of activated KIT and PDGFRA, and was also related to the different expression levels of activated proteins that play key roles in the downstream of the receptor tyrosine kinase III family. To evaluate the impact of mutation status and the importance of the type of mutation in gene expression and clinical features, microarray-derived data from 22 GISTs were interpreted using a principal component analysis (PCA). Three relevant principal component representing mutation of KIT, PDGFRA and chromosome 14q deletion were identified from the interpretation of the oligonucleotide microarray data with PCA. After supervised analysis, there was at least a two fold difference in expression between GISTs with KIT and PDGFRA mutation in 70 genes. Our findings demonstrate that mutations of KIT and PDGFRA affect differential activation and expression of some genes, and can be used for the molecular classification of GISTs."
https://openalex.org/W2046359243,"Chondrocyte maturation to hypertrophy, associated with up-regulated transglutaminase 2 (TG2) expression, mediates not only physiologic growth plate mineralization but also pathologic matrix calcification and dys-regulated matrix repair in osteoarthritic articular cartilage. TG2-/- mouse chondrocytes demonstrate markedly inhibited progression to hypertrophic differentiation in response to both retinoic acid and the chemokine CXCL1. Here, our objectives were to test if up-regulated TG2 alone is sufficient to promote chondrocyte hypertrophic differentiation and to identify TG2 molecular determinants and potential downstream signals involved. TG2 activities, regulated by nucleotides and calcium, include cross-linking of cartilage matrix proteins, binding of fibronectin, and hydrolysis of GTP and ATP. Following transfection of TG2 site-directed mutants into chondrocytic cells, we observed that wild type TG2, and TG catalytic site and fibronectin-binding mutants promoted type X collagen expression and matrix calcification consistent with chondrocyte hypertrophic differentiation. In contrast, transfected mutants of TG2 GTP binding (K173L) and externalization (Y274A) sites did not stimulate chondrocyte hypertrophy. Recombinant TG2 treatment of bovine cartilage explants demonstrated that extracellular TG2 induced hypertrophy more robustly in the GTP-bound state, confirming an essential role of TG2 GTP binding. Finally, TG2 treatment induced type X collagen in a beta1 integrin-mediated manner, associated with rapid phosphorylation of both Rac1 and p38 kinases that were inhibited by mutation of the TG2 GTP binding site. In conclusion, externalized GTP-bound TG2 serves as a molecular switch for differentiation of chondrocytes to a hypertrophic, calcifying phenotype in a manner that does not require either TG2 transamidation activity or fibronectin binding."

We recently demonstrated that AKAP-Lbc Rho-GEF activity is stimulated by the α-subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein G12, whereas phosphorylation of AKAP-Lbc by the anchored PKA induces the recruitment of 14-3-3, which inhibits its GEF function. In the present report, using co-immunoprecipitation approaches, we demonstrated that AKAP-Lbc can form homo-oligomers inside cells. Mutagenesis studies revealed that oligomerization is mediated by two adjacent leucine zipper motifs located in the C-terminal region of the anchoring protein. Most interestingly, disruption of oligomerization resulted in a drastic increase in the ability of AKAP-Lbc to stimulate the formation of Rho-GTP in cells under basal conditions, suggesting that oligomerization maintains AKAP-Lbc in a basal-inactive state. Based on these results and on our previous findings showing that AKAP-Lbc is inactivated through the association with 14-3-3, we investigated the hypothesis that AKAP-Lbc oligomerization might be required for the regulatory action of 14-3-3. Most interestingly, we found that mutants of AKAP-Lbc impaired in their ability to undergo oligomerization were completely resistant to the inhibitory effect of PKA and 14-3-3. This suggests that 14-3-3 can negatively regulate the Rho-GEF activity of AKAP-Lbc only when the anchoring protein is in an oligomeric state. Altogether, these findings provide a novel mechanistic explanation of how oligomerization can regulate the activity of exchange factors of the Dbl family.

Altogether, these findings provide a novel mechanistic explanation of how oligomerization can regulate the activity of exchange factors of the Dbl family. Compartmentalization of signaling molecules through association with anchoring and scaffolding proteins is a mechanism that ensures specificity of transduction events involved in cellular regulation. A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) 1The abbreviations used are: AKAPs, A-kinase anchoring protein; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; PH, pleckstrin homology; DH, Dbl homology; RBD, Rho-binding domain; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; DTT, dithiothreitol; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. are a family of scaffolding proteins that compartmentalize the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) at precise subcellular sites in close proximity to its physiological substrates (1Michel J.J. Scott J.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 235-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Each AKAP contains a conserved amphipathic helix of 14–18 residues that binds to the regulatory subunit dimers of the PKA holoenzyme (2Carr D.W. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Fraser I.D.C. Bishop S.M. Acott T.S.

Scott J.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 12: 959-970Crossref Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Another fundamental role of AKAPs is to assemble signaling complexes by associating with multiple enzymes such as kinases, phosphatases, and other regulatory proteins. By simultaneously interacting with multiple signaling enzymes, AKAPs can integrate diverse transduction pathways that coordinately regulate the function of specific cellular substrates (5Wong W. Scott J.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 12: 959-970Crossref Scopus (862) Google Scholar, 6Bauman A.L. Scott J.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E203-E206Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Recently, we identified a novel member of the AKAP family, termed AKAP-Lbc, that functions as a type II PKA anchoring protein as well as guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for RhoA (7Diviani D. Soderling J. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44247-44257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), a small GTP-binding protein of the Ras family that controls fundamental cell processes such as cell cycle progression, gene transcription, remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton, and cytokinesis (8Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3875) Google Scholar). AKAP-Lbc belongs to the Dbl family of GEFs, which all share a Dbl homology (DH) domain and an adjacent pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (9Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). The DH domain is responsible for the guanine nucleotide exchange activity, whereas the PH domain regulates subcellular localization of Rho-GEFs or is implicated in the binding pocket for Rho-GT-Pases (8Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3875) Google Scholar). A truncated form of AKAP-Lbc missing the entire N-terminal and C-terminal regions, called Onco-Lbc, was originally isolated as an oncogene from myeloid leukemia patients and shown to represent a constitutively active Rho-GEF (10Zheng Y. Olson M.F. Hall A. Cerione R.A. Toksoz D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9031-9034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The Rho-GEF activity of AKAP-Lbc can be strongly enhanced by the α-subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein G12 that is activated following the stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors that couple to G12 by serum or lysophosphatidic acid (7Diviani D. Soderling J. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44247-44257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In the absence of activating stimuli, AKAP-Lbc is maintained in an inactive state through the association with 14-3-3. The recruitment of 14-3-3 to AKAP-Lbc is induced by the phosphorylation of serine 1565 located within the 14-3-3-binding site of the anchoring protein by the PKA holoenzyme anchored to AKAP-Lbc (11Diviani D. Abuin L. Cotecchia S. Pansier L. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2811-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 12Jin J. Smith F.D. Stark C. Wells C.D. Fawcett J.P. Kulkarni S. Metalnikov P. O'Donnell P.

Many members of the Dbl family of GEF are maintained in a basal inactive conformation by intramolecular interactions involving the DH and PH domains as well as regulatory sequences. Such interactions have been proposed to block the access of Rho GTPases to the DH domain and/or suppress the GEF activity of the exchange factor (13Zheng Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 724-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Recent studies now demonstrate that the activity of Dbl family members can also be regulated through oligomerization. The functional role of this intermolecular interaction has been established only for a small number of them, including Ras GRF1 and Ras GRF2 (14Anborgh P.H. Qian X. Papageorge A.G. Vass W.C. DeClue J.E. Lowy D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4611-4622Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), Dbl (15Zhu K. Debreceni B. Bi F. Zheng Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 425-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), α- and β-Pix (16Feng Q. Baird D. Cerione R.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3492-3504Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 17Kim S. Lee S.H. Park D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10581-10584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), as well as p115-Rho-GEF, LARG, and PDZ-Rho-GEF (18Eisenhaure T.M.

Teramoto H. Zheng Y. Gutkind J.S. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Oligomerization of Ras GRF, Dbl, and β-Pix is required for the efficient execution of the exchange reaction (14Anborgh P.H. Qian X. Papageorge A.G. Vass W.C. DeClue J.E. Lowy D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4611-4622Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 15Zhu K. Debreceni B. Bi F. Zheng Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 425-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), whereas oligomerization of p115-Rho-GEF, LARG, and PDZ-Rho GEF has been shown to negatively regulate the GEF activity (18Eisenhaure T.M.

Teramoto H. Zheng Y. Gutkind J.S. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, recent evidence suggests that oligomerization can also regulate the specificity of GEFs toward Rho GTPases. This mechanism was recently described for α-Pix, which can adopt a dimeric conformation that selectively activates Rac and a monomeric conformation that activates both Rac and Cdc42 (16Feng Q. Baird D. Cerione R.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3492-3504Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Although it appears that oligomerization can affect the functional properties of Dbl family members, the molecular mechanisms through which oligomerization regulates the activity of these exchange factors are poorly understood. In the present study, by using co-immunoprecipitation approaches, we demonstrate that AKAP-Lbc can form homo-oligomers through a leucine zipper motif located in the C-terminal region of the anchoring protein. We found that disruption of oligomerization strongly enhances the basal Rho-GEF activity of AKAP-Lbc, suggesting that oligomerization maintains the anchoring protein in a basal inactive state. Most importantly, we also show that oligomerization maintains AKAP-Lbc in a conformation that can be regulated by 14-3-3, as shown by the fact that oligomerization-deficient mutants of AKAP-Lbc are completely resistant to the inhibitory effect of 14-3-3. These findings provide a molecular explanation for the functional role of oligomerization of Dbl family GEFs. Expression Constructs—The constructs encoding the FLAG-AKAP-Lbc and the FLAG-AKAP-Bc deletion mutant missing the first 1922 residues (FLAG-AKAP-Bc-ΔN-term) were described previously (11Diviani D. Abuin L. Cotecchia S. Pansier L. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2811-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The deletion mutant of FLAG-AKAP-Bc missing residues 2337–2817 (FLAG-AKAP-Bc-ΔC-term) was generated by subcloning a fragment excised from the AKAP-Lbc-(1923–2336)-pGEX4T1 construct, which contains a stop codon at position 2336, at Psp1406I/NotI into the FLAG-AKAP-Lbc construct. The coiled coil region included between residues 2573 and 2687 was deleted from FLAG-AKAP-Lbc (FLAG-AKAP-Lbc ΔCC) as well as from FLAG-tagged and GFP-tagged AKAP-Lbc fragments encompassing residues 1923–2817 (1923–2817 ΔCC) by using standard PCR techniques. cDNA fragments encoding amino acids 1–503, 504–1000, 1001–1387, 1388–1922, 1923–2336, 2337–2817, 1923–2817, 1923–2698, 1923–2589, and 2566–2698 of AKAP-Lbc were PCR-amplified from the AKAP-Lbc pEGFP vector and subcloned in the pFLAGCMV6 vector, to generate protein fragments fused with the FLAG epitope. AKAP-Lbc fragments encompassing residues 1–503, 504–1000, and 1001–1387 were subcloned at NotI/SalI; fragments 1388–1922 and 1923–2336 were subcloned at EcoRI/SalI, and fragments 2337–2817, 1923–2817, 1923–2698, 1923–2589, and 2566–2698 were subcloned at SalI/KpnI. Fragments 1923–2336, 1923–2817, 2337–2817, 1923–2698, 1923–2589, and 2566–2698 were also subcloned into the pEGFP vector to construct fusion proteins with GFP. For the mapping of the oligomerization site, different leucine and valine residues included in the putative leucine zipper motifs of AKAP-Lbc were substituted to alanine into the AKAP-Lbc-(1923–2817)-pFLAGCMV6 vector by PCR-directed mutagenesis using the Hot Star DNA polymerase (Qiagen). The mutants generated are the following: LZ mutant 1 (L216A, L2623A, and V2630A), LZ mutant 2 (L2637A and L2644A), LZ mutant 3 (L2658A and L2665A), LZ mutant 4 (L2672A and L2679A), LZ mutant 5 (L216A, L2623A, V2630A, L2637A, and L2644A), LZ mutant 6 (L2658A, L2665A, L2672A, and L2679A), and LZ mutant 7 (L216A, L2623A, V2630A, L2637A, L2644A, L2658A, and L2665A). The oligomerization-deficient mutant of AKAP-Lbc (FLAG-AKAP-Lbc LZm) was generated by subcloning a PCR fragment amplified from the LZ mutant 7-pFLAGCMV6c construct at Psp1406I/NotI into the FLAG-AKAP-Lbc construct. The rhotekin Rho-binding domain (RBD)-pGEX4T1 construct was a generous gift of Dr. Hitoshi Kurose (Fukuoka, Japan). Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins in Bacteria— GST fusion proteins of the RBD of rhotekin and RhoA were expressed using the bacterial expression vector pGEX4T1 in the BL21DE3 strain of Escherichia coli and were purified. To induce the expression of the GST-RBD fusion proteins, exponentially growing bacterial cultures were incubated 24 h at 16 °C with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and subsequently subjected to centrifugation. Pelleted bacteria were lysed in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% (w/v)Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm benzamidine, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin), sonicated, and centrifuged at 38,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. After incubating the supernatants with the glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C, the resin was washed five times with 10 volumes of buffer A. The protein content of the beads was assessed by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Beads were used immediately for rhotekin RBD pulldown assay. For the production of purified GST-RhoA, exponentially growing bacterial cultures were incubated 4 h at 37 °C with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and subsequently subjected to centrifugation. Pelleted bacteria were lysed in buffer B (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1% (w/v)Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm benzamidine, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin), sonicated, and centrifuged at 38,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. After incubating the supernatants with the glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 10 min at 4 °C, the beads were washed three times with 10 volumes of buffer B. GST-RhoA was eluted by incubating beads with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 20 mm reduced glutathione (Sigma), 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm benzamidine, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin for 1 h at 4 °C with constant stirring. The eluted proteins were dialyzed three times with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm DTT and stored at -80 °C. The protein content of eluates was assessed by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Cell Culture and Transfections—HEK-293 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and gentamycin (100 μg/ml) and transfected at 50–60% confluency in 100-mm dishes using the calcium-phosphate method. For the overexpression of constructs containing the full-length AKAP-Lbc, HEK-293 cells were transfected at 80% confluency in 100-mm dishes using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After transfection, cells were grown for 48 h in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum before harvesting. The total amount of transfected DNA was 6 μg/100-mm dish for the FLAG-tagged AKAP-Lbc fragments, 12 μg/100-mm dish for the GFP-tagged AKAP-Lbc fragments, and 24 μg/100-mm dish for the full-length FLAG-AKAP-Lbc constructs. Immunoprecipitation Experiments—For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, cells were lysed in 1 ml of buffer C (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm PMSF). Cell lysates were incubated 6 h at 4°C on a rotating wheel and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 20 μl of anti-FLAG M2 beads (Sigma) to immunoprecipitate overexpressed FLAG-tagged AKAP-Lbc constructs. Following a brief centrifugation on a bench-top centrifuge, the pelleted beads were washed five times with buffer C and proteins eluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (65 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 5% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol) by boiling samples for 3 min at 95 °C. Eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and by Western blotting. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Samples denatured in SDS-PAGE sample buffer were separated on acrylamide gels and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were incubated with primary antibodies and horseradish-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) as indicated previously (11Diviani D. Abuin L. Cotecchia S. Pansier L. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2811-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The following affinity-purified primary antibodies were used for immunoblotting: mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG (Sigma, 4.9 mg/ml, 1:2000 dilution), mouse monoclonal anti-GFP (Roche Applied Science, 400 μg/ml, 1:500 dilution), mouse monoclonal anti-RhoA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:250 dilution), and rabbit polyclonal anti-14-3-3β (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:250 dilution). GDP/GTP Exchange Assay—The exchange assays were performed as described previously (20Zheng Y. Hart M.J. Cerione R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A 2-μg portion of recombinant RhoA was incubated for 5 min in 60 μl of loading buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm DTT, 100 μm AMP-PNP and 10 μm GDP) at room temperature. MgCl2 was then added to a final concentration of 5 mm, and the incubation was continued for an additional 15 min. To initiate the exchange reaction, protein aliquots (20 μl) of GDP-loaded GTPases were mixed at room temperature with 80 μl of reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μm AMP-PNP, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 5 μm [35S]GTPγS (11,000 cpm/pmol)) containing immunoprecipitated FLAG-AKAP-Lbc or FLAG-AKAP-Lbc LZ mutant. Aliquots (15 μl) of samples were taken at various time points and added to 10 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Bound and free nucleotides were separated by filtration through BA85 nitrocellulose filters. The amount of bound radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Rhotekin Rho-binding Domain Pulldown Assay—HEK-293 cells grown in 100-mm dishes were transfected with 24 μg of FLAG-tagged AKAP-Lbc, AKAP-Lbc-ΔC-term, AKAP-Lbc-ΔCC, AKAP-Lbc LZm, or AKAP-Lbc S1565A constructs. At 24 h after transfection, cells were incubated in DMEM without serum for an additional 24 h. Cells were then treated for 1 h with 10% fetal calf serum in the absence or presence of 50 μm forskolin (Sigma) and lysed in RBD lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 30 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm PMSF). Lysates were subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and incubated with 30 μg of RDB beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were then washed three times with RBD buffer, resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The C-terminal Region of AKAP-Lbc Negatively Regulates Basal Rho-GEF Activity—We have demonstrated recently that AKAP-Lbc displays a low basal Rho-GEF activity in serumstarved cells, which can be significantly enhanced by the deletion of the N-terminal region of the anchoring protein upstream of the DH domain. This suggested that inhibitory determinants located in the N-terminal sequence maintain AKAP-Lbc in an inactive state in the absence of external activating stimuli (7Diviani D. Soderling J. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44247-44257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 11Diviani D. Abuin L. Cotecchia S. Pansier L. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2811-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). On the other hand, our previous results could not clearly determine whether the C-terminal region downstream of the PH domain also regulates the function of AKAP-Lbc, because we found that the truncated form of AKAP-Lbc missing the N-terminal regulatory region displays a basal constitutive Rho-GEF activity comparable with that of a deletion mutant of AKAP-Lbc missing both N and C termini (7Diviani D. Soderling J. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44247-44257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Therefore, in order to determine precisely the functional role of the C-terminal region, we assessed the Rho-activating properties of a deletion mutant of AKAP-Lbc missing only the C terminus. AKAP-Lbc as well as its deletion forms AKAP-Lbc Δ-Nterm and AKAP-Lbc Δ-Cterm, missing the N-terminal 1922 residues and the C-terminal 481 residues, respectively, were overexpressed in HEK-293 cells, and their basal Rho-GEF were activities assessed by using the rhotekin pulldown assay after 24 h of serum starvation (Fig. 1). Most interestingly, the C-terminal deletion mutant of AKAP-Lbc displayed a significant 4-fold higher basal Rho-GEF activity as compared with wild type AKAP-Lbc (Fig. 1B, top panel, lane 4). This activity is comparable with that of the N-terminal deletion mutant (Fig. 1B, top panel, lane 3), suggesting that both the N and C termini of the AKAP-Lbc contribute to maintain the basal Rho-GEF activity low in the absence of external activation stimuli. In order to determine whether the higher basal activity induced by N- and C-terminal deletions could be attributed to an increased association between AKAP-Lbc and RhoA, we determined the ability of RhoA to co-immunoprecipitate with wild type AKAP-Lbc, AKAP-Lbc Δ-Nterm, or AKAP-Lbc Δ-Cterm. As shown in Fig. 1C, both truncation mutants displayed a stronger interaction with endogenous RhoA under basal unstimulated conditions as compared with wild type AKAP-Lbc (Fig. 1C, middle panel, lanes 3 and 4). These findings strongly suggest that the C-terminal region of AKAP-Lbc, included between residues 2337 and 2817, negatively regulates the basal Rho-GEF activity by inhibiting the binding of RhoA to AKAP-Lbc. AKAP-Lbc Undergoes Homo-oligomerization through Its C-terminal Region—Recent evidence suggests that GEFs of the Dbl family can be maintained in a basal inactive conformation by intramolecular interactions between regulatory sequences and the GEF module (DH and PH domains) (13Zheng Y.

In order to assess whether the C-terminal region of AKAP-Lbc included between amino acids 2337 and 2817 could establish intramolecular interactions with other domains of AKAP-Lbc, such as the N-terminal regulatory region or the GEF module, we generated a series of FLAG-tagged AKAP-Lbc fragments encompassing residues 1–503, 504–1000, 1001–1387, 1388–1922, 1923–2336 and 2337–1817, and we expressed them in HEK-293 cells in combination with either GFP or a GFP-tagged 2337–2817 fragment. Overexpressed FLAG-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG antibodies, and the presence of associated 2337–2817 GFP fragment was assessed using anti-GFP antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2, whereas no intramolecular interactions could be detected between the 2337–2817 fragment of AKAP-Lbc and other fragments of the anchoring protein (Fig. 2B, middle panel, lanes 1–10), a strong association was observed between FLAG- and GFP-tagged 2337–2817 fragments (Fig. 2B, middle panel, lane 12). These findings suggest that the C-terminal region of AKAP-Lbc can undergo homo-oligomerization. Homo-oligomerization Occurs through Leucine Zipper Motifs Located in the Coiled Coil Region of AKAP-Lbc—To identify the oligomerization domain within the C-terminal region of AKAP-Lbc, we generated FLAG- and GFP-tagged AKAP-Lbc fragments encompassing residues 1923–2817, 1923–2336, 2337–2817, 1923–2589, and 1923–2698 (Fig. 3A), and we co-expressed them in HEK-293 cells. Overexpressed FLAG-tagged AKAP-Lbc fragments were immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG antibodies, and the presence of associated GFP-tagged fragments was assessed using anti-GFP antibodies. Fragments encompassing residues 1923–2817, 2337–2817, and 1923–2698 retained the ability to undergo oligomerization (Fig. 3B, middle panel, lanes 4, 6, and 8), whereas fragments 1923–2589 and 1923–2336 did not (Fig. 3B, middle panel, lanes 2 and 10). This suggested that the oligomerization motif is located between residues 2589 and 2698. We found that this portion of AKAP-Lbc is entirely included in a coiled coil region that encompasses residues 2566–2698. Most interestingly, deletion of this region totally abolished oligomerization of the 1923–2817 fragment, whereas a fragment encompassing residues 2566–2698 retained the ability to form oligomers (Fig. 3B, middle panel, lanes 12 and 14). These results strongly suggest that the coiled coil region of AKAP-Lbc is necessary and sufficient for the homo-oligomerization process. Analysis of the primary sequence between residues 2566–2698 revealed the presence of two leucine zipper motifs encompassing residues 2616–2644 and 2658–2679, respectively (Fig. 4A). Based on this observation and on the fact that leucine zippers often function as protein-protein interaction motifs, we investigated the possibility that these motifs could mediate the oligomerization of AKAP-Lbc. We generated FLAG fusions of the 1923–2817 fragment of AKAP-Lbc in which valine 2630 as well as leucines 2616, 2623, 2637, 2644, 2658, 2665, 2672, and 2679 were substituted by alanine in different combinations (Fig. 4B). The different FLAG-tagged fragments were expressed in HEK-293 cells in combination with the GFP-tagged 1923–2817 fragment. Overexpressed FLAG-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG antibodies, and the presence of associated GFP-tagged 1923–2817 fragment was assessed using anti-GFP antibodies. As shown in Fig. 4C the mutation of leucines 2616, 2623, and valine 2630 (LZ mutant 1), leucines 2637 and 2644 (LZ mutant 2), and leucines 2658 and 2665 (LZ mutant 3) reduced the homo-oligomerization of the 1923–2817 fragment of AKAP-Lbc by 50–60% (Fig. 4, C, middle panel, lanes 3–5, and D) whereas the substitution of leucines 2672 and 2679 (LZ mutant 4) had no effect (Fig. 4, C, middle panel, lane 6 and D). A 90% reduction in oligomerization could be observed after the substitution of all five leucines and valines included in the first leucine zipper (LZ mutant 5), whereas mutation of all four leucines of the second leucine zipper (LZ mutant 6) could inhibit the formation of oligomers only by 50% (Fig. 4, C, middle panel, lanes 7 and 8, and D). Finally, oligomerization was totally abolished after substitution of all leucines and valines of the first leucine zipper as well as leucines 2658 and 2665 of the second leucine zipper (LZ mutant 7) (Fig. 4, C, middle panel, lane 9, and D). Altogether these findings indicate that oligomerization requires the integrity of the entire leucine zipper motif encompassing residues 2616–2644, whereas the second leucine zipper is only partially involved. To assess the contribution of the leucine zipper motifs to the oligomerization of the full-length AKAP-Lbc, we overexpressed the FLAG-tagged forms of AKAP-Lbc and of its mutants AKAP-Lbc ΔCC (missing the entire coiled coil region) and AKAP-Lbc LZm (in which leucines 2616 to 2665 were mutated to alanine) in HEK-293 cells in combination with AKAP-Lbc-GFP. The FLAG-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated by using anti-F"

These results provide the first structural characterization of EAP domains, relate EAP domains to a large class of bacterial toxins, and will guide the design of future experiments to analyze EAP domain structure/function relationships. Staphylococcus aureus is a widespread, persistent pathogen that causes a broad range of diseases in humans and animals, from simple wound infections to more severe conditions such as septicemia, endocarditis, and osteomyelitis (2Lowy F.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339: 520-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (4704) Google Scholar). As is the case with many pathogens, initiation of S. aureus infection requires colonization of unique microenvironments within the host. To facilitate host colonization, S. aureus expresses a diverse array of virulence-determining factors, including exoenzymes, toxins, and numerous protein adhesins. These adhesins (termed Receptins (3Kronvall G. Jonsson K. J. Mol. Recogn. 1999; 12: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 4Patti J.M. Allen B.L. McGavin M.J. Hook M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 585-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar) or MSCRAMMs (4Patti J.M. Allen B.L. McGavin M.J. Hook M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 585-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar) (for microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules)) are believed to contribute to the initiation and propagation of infections by precluding bacterial clearance by physical forces (e.g. blood flow, coughing, etc.) and providing protection against host immune responses (4Patti J.M. Allen B.L. McGavin M.J. Hook M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 585-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). Although different receptins bind a variety of ligands in host tissues, a common feature is their ability to bind specifically to the large glycoproteins present in the extracellular matrix (e.g. fibronectin, collagen, and fibrinogen) (reviewed in Ref. 5Flock J-I. Mol. Med. Today. 1999; 5: 532-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The 50–70-kDa Eap (extracellular adherence protein) of S. aureus was originally identified based on its ability to bind glomerular basement membranes (6Yousif Y. Mertz A. Batsford S.R. Vogt A. Zentbl. Backteriol. 1991; 21: 168-169Google Scholar), and more mechanistic studies have demonstrated that Eap is capable of binding a wide array of extracellular matrix proteins (7McGavin M.H. Krajewska-Pietrasik D. Ryden C. Hook M. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 2479-2485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Boden M.K. Flock J-I. Microb. Pathog. 1992; 12: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 9Palma M. Haggar A. Flock J-I. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2840-2845Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), including fibronectin, vitronectin, laminin, and the pro-inflammatory cell surface receptor intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) (10Chavakis T. Hussain M. Kanse S.M. Peters. G. Bretzel R.G. Flock J.-I. Herrmann M. Preissner K.T. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that the mature Eap protein lacks a transmembrane region, ∼30% of the steady-state level of Eap was found associated with the bacterial cell surface (9Palma M. Haggar A. Flock J-I. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2840-2845Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies demonstrated that this association can occur through specific protein-protein interactions (11Flock M. Flock J-I. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3999-4003Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and uncharacterized membrane structures (12Kreikemeyer B. McDevitt D. Podbiolski A. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2002; 292: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) as well as through Eap multimerization (9Palma M. Haggar A. Flock J-I. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2840-2845Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because no other receptin has these properties, Eap is believed to serve a unique role in bacterial virulence by mediating interactions between abundant host ligands (e.g. fibrinogen, fibronectin, and vitronectin) and the bacterial cell. These interactions result in bacterial agglutination within the host and are believed to contribute to S. aureus pathogenesis (9Palma M. Haggar A. Flock J-I. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2840-2845Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hussain M. Haggar A. Heilmann C Peters G. Flock J-I. Herrmann M. Infect.

Immun. 2003; 71: 2310-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, S. aureus strains that fail to produce Eap exhibit markedly lower affinity for eukaryotic cells (12Kreikemeyer B. McDevitt D. Podbiolski A. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2002; 292: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 13Hussain M. Haggar A. Heilmann C Peters G. Flock J-I. Herrmann M. Infect.

Thus, there is interest in understanding and evaluating Eap-mediated interactions as potential targets for novel antimicrobial therapies (5Flock J-I. Mol. Med. Today. 1999; 5: 532-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Like many extracellular proteins, Eap exhibits a modular architecture and is believed to be comprised of tandem repeats of an ∼110-residue domain (EAP domain) (15Jonsson K. McDevitt D. Homonylo M. Patti J.M. Hook M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21457-21460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 16Harraghy N. Hussain M. Haggar A. Chavakis T. Sinha B. Herrmann M. Flock J-I. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 2701-2707Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Depending on the strain examined, Eap is comprised of either four or six repeats of this domain, although extensive homology between these isoforms and nearly indistinguishable biochemical properties suggest that these proteins serve essentially the same physiological function (10Chavakis T. Hussain M. Kanse S.M. Peters. G. Bretzel R.G. Flock J.-I. Herrmann M. Preissner K.T. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 17Hussain M. Becker K. von Eiff C. Peters G. Herrmann M. Clin. Diag. Lab. Immunol. 2001; 8: 1271-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These observations, combined with the wide variety of Eap ligands, imply that the individual EAP domains themselves are remarkably versatile in their ability to form protein-protein interactions. However, the biochemical properties of these domains are not well studied, nor do EAP domains share detectable sequence homology with any proteins of known structure. As a first step toward a molecular understanding of EAP domain-mediated protein-protein interactions, we determined the three-dimensional structures of three distinct EAP domain proteins to 1.8, 2.2, and 1.35 Å resolution, respectively. These structures consist of a 97-residue core fold composed primarily of a long α-helix laying diagonally across a five-stranded, mixed β-sheet. Comparison of EAP domains with other structures in the Protein Data Bank revealed an unexpected structural homology with the C-terminal domain of bacterial superantigens, a class of toxic proteins capable of massive stimulation of host lymphocytes by simultaneously binding both major histocompatibility class II proteins and T-cell receptors (TCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: TCR, T-cell receptor; MAD, multiwavelength anomalous diffraction; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation.

Immunol. 1991; 9: 745-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). Examination of the crystal structure of the superantigen SEC bound to a TCR β-chain suggests a potential ligand-binding site within the EAP domain (1Fields B.A. Malchiodi E.L. Li H. Ysern X. Stauffacher C.V. Schlievert P.M. Karjalainen K. Mariuzza R. Nature. 1996; 384: 188-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Our results provide the first insights into the structure of EAP domains and identify a novel and unexpected relationship between two broad classes of bacterial virulence factors. These results provide a framework for future studies addressing the structure/function relationships of these and other EAP domain proteins. S. aureus strain Mu50 was purchased from ATCC and subcultured in liquid LB medium using standard techniques. Genomic DNA was isolated from 1 liter of stationary phase bacteria according to the procedure originally described by Marmur (20Marmur J. J. Mol. Biol. 1961; 3: 208-218Crossref Scopus (9029) Google Scholar), with the exception that lysostaphin (Sigma) was included in the lysis buffer according to the manufacturer's suggestions. The crude preparation of genomic DNA was purified further by standard extraction and precipitation techniques and resuspended in double distilled H2O to a final concentration of 1.0 mg/ml (A260/A280 = 1.7). The genes encoding EapH1 (GenBank™ accession number NP_372729) and EapH2 (GenBank™ accession number NP_371505) were identified in the Mu50 genomic sequence by BLAST searching with entire amino acid sequence of Eap (GenBank™ accession number NP_372462). The conceptual translation of each gene was analyzed for the highest probability signal peptide cleavage site using the SignalP algorithm Gram-positive option (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/). DNAs encoding residues 31–141 of EapH1, residues 24–144 of EapH2, and residues 160–254 of Eap (the second EAP repeat, denoted EAP2) were amplified by PCR from Mu50 genomic DNA with SalI and NotI restriction endonuclease recognition sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, subcloned into the corresponding sites of the pT7HMT Escherichia coli expression vector, 2B. V. Geisbrecht, manuscript in preparation. and sequenced in their entirety. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to insert additional methionine residues in the EapH1 protein to facilitate phasing by multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) (22Leahy D.J. Erickson H.P. Aukhil I. Joshi P. Hendrickson W.A. Proteins. 1994; 19: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The codons for Val91, Ile96, Leu106, and Val116 were mutated independently to encode methionine by a two-step, megaprimer method to create four independent proteins with single-site methionine substitutions (23Geisbrecht B.V.

Mutant DNAs encoding each variant protein were subcloned into pT7HMT and sequenced in their entirety. All of the sequence alignments were performed using the DNASTAR software suite. E. coli strain B834(DE3) was used for overexpression of all proteins. Cell growth for the production of native proteins was carried out at 37 °C as previously described (24Geisbrecht B.V. Zhang D. Schulz H. Gould S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21797-21803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Following induction, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 50 ml of denaturing lysis buffer (0.1 m sodium Pi (7.8), 6 m guanidinium HCl) per liter of original culture, lysed by stirring for 30 min at room temperature, and the solubilized, denatured proteins were separated from cellular debris by centrifugation (30 min at 30,000 × g). The clarified cell extract was applied by gravity flow to a 7.5-ml column of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose (Qiagen) at room temperature, and His-tagged proteins were isolated according to manufacturer's suggestions. Following purification, recombinant proteins were refolded by rapid dilution 2B. V. Geisbrecht, manuscript in preparation. and concentrated by native chelating chromatography according to the manufacturer's suggestions (Qiagen). The purified EAP domain fusion proteins were digested with recombinant TEV protease (Invitrogen) at 4 °C according to the manufacturer's suggestions) to avoid potential crystallization problems caused by the presence of the N-terminal fusion tag. When digestion was complete (as judged by SDS-PAGE), the samples were exchanged into 20 mm sodium formate (pH 3.5), applied to a 6-ml Resource S cation exchange column (Amersham Biosciences), washed free of loosely bound contaminants, and eluted with a gradient from 0 to 1 m NaCl over 10 column volumes. Fractions containing apparently homogenous EapH1, EapH2, or EAP2 were pooled, dialyzed once overnight against 4 liters of double distilled H2O using a 3500 molecular weight cut-off Slidealyzer cassette (Pierce Biotechnology), and lyophilized for storage. For overexpression of selenomethionyl-derivatized mutant proteins, selective M9 minimal medium containing 50 mg/liter of seleno-l-methionine (Sigma) was prepared and used according to the general procedure of Beneken et al. (25Beneken J. Tu J.C. Xiao B. Nuriya M. Yuan J.P. Worley P.F. Leahy D.J. Neuron. 2000; 26: 143-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Each derivatized protein was purified from the cells in 1 liter of induced culture according to the same protocol used for native proteins, with the exception that all of the buffers were vacuum-degassed prior to use. The incorporation of selenomethionine in each mutant was complete as judged by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). All of the crystals were grown in hanging drops at 20 °C by mixing 1 μl of protein solution (in water) with 1 μl of a 1:3 dilution of reservoir buffer in water and equilibrating over 750 μl of undiluted reservoir buffer. The crystals used for diffraction analysis were soaked briefly in a fresh aliquot of reservoir buffer and flash frozen in a gaseous nitrogen stream at –180 °C prior to data collection. All of the data were processed and scaled using the DENZO/SCALEPACK software suite (26.Otwinowski, Z.

The diffraction data for MAD phasing were collected at Selenium edge, peak, and remote wavelengths for crystals of the I96M and L106M mutants using Beamline X4A of the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The diffraction data used for high resolution refinement were collected at Beamline 14BM-C of the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory. EapH2—30 mg/ml protein was mixed with a reservoir buffer of 0.1 m sodium cacodylate (pH 6.7), 0.2 m ammonium acetate, 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, and 4% (w/v) 2,6-hexanediol. Twinned, needle-like crystals appeared within 2 days and achieved their full size in approximately 1 week. Microseeding produced a single crystal that grew in the space group P21 (unit cell dimensions: a = 50.01 Å, b = 31.97 Å, c = 67.98 Å; β = 105.21°) and contained two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The diffraction data were collected using CuKα radiation produced by a Rigaku RU-200 generator. EAP2—13 mg/ml protein was mixed with a reservoir buffer of 0.1 m MES (pH 6.4), 0.1 m ammonium sulfate, and 24% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000. Single crystals appeared within 1 day, achieved their full size in approximately 1 week, and grew in the space group R3 (unit cell dimensions: a = b = 64.116 Å, c = 141.706 Å) with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The diffraction data were collected at Beamline X4A of the National Synchrotron Light Source. The two anticipated selenium sites in both the I96M and L106M mutants of EapH1 (one native and one introduced) were determined and the phases calculated using the program SOLVE (27Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). To generate the final experimental phases, complete, three wavelength MAD data sets from both mutants were combined into a single, pseudo-multiple isomorphous replacement data set. The experimental values for the Figure of merit (〈m〉) are shown in Tables II and III. After the experimental phases were improved by solvent flattening and histogram matching protocols (RESOLVE) (28Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar, 29Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 59: 34-44PubMed Google Scholar), an initial model of residues 45–141 was built into 2.2 Å experimental electron density maps using the program O (30Jones T.A. Zou J-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13016) Google Scholar). The model was subjected to a single round of simulated annealing and maximum-likelihood positional refinement using CNS and a native data set processed to 1.8 Å limiting resolution (31Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16991) Google Scholar). Iterative rounds of model building and water addition were alternated with B-factor and positional refinement to yield the final model. This model consists of residues 43–141, 95 water molecules, and two ordered zinc ions. No electron density was observed for residues 31–42. The final model was analyzed by the program PROCHECK in CCP4 (32Project Collaborative Computational Crystallography Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19825) Google Scholar, 33Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Greater than 90% of the residues were found in the most favorable regions of the Ramachandran plot, and no residues were found in the disallowed regions. The final refinement statistics are shown in Tables II and III. The structure of EapH2 was solved by molecular replacement using the program MOLREP and the refined structure of EapH1 as a search model (32Project Collaborative Computational Crystallography Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19825) Google Scholar, 34Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4196) Google Scholar). The top two molecular replacement solutions yielded models for both EapH2 molecules in the asymmetric unit, which were then subjected to a single round of simulated annealing prior to building a 2.2 Å limiting resolution initial model of residues 45–144 in both polypeptide chains using the program O (30Jones T.A. Zou J-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13016) Google Scholar). Several rounds of model rebuilding and water addition, alternated with positional and individual B-factor refinement, yielded the final model. This model consists of residues 42–144 for the first protein molecule in the asymmetric unit, residues 45–144 for the second protein molecule, and 76 ordered solvent molecules. Superposition of all of the Cα positions of these polypeptide chains revealed no significant structural differences between the two molecules (r.m.s.d. = 0.43 Å). The orientation of the noncrystallographic symmetry axis is not likely to reflect any physiologically relevant dimerization because the EapH2 protein behaves as a monomer in solution at concentrations up to 2 mm as judged by analytical size exclusion chromatography (data not shown). The final model was analyzed by the program PROCHECK (32Project Collaborative Computational Crystallography Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Greater than 90% of the residues were found in the most favorable regions of the Ramachandran plot, and no residues were found in the disallowed regions. The final refinement statistics are shown in Tables II and III. The structure of EAP2 was solved by molecular replacement using the CCP4 program MOLREP and a single molecule from the refined structure of EapH2 as a search model (32Project Collaborative Computational Crystallography Acta Crystallogr.

The top molecular replacement solutions yielded models for both EAP2 molecules in the asymmetric unit, which were subjected to a single round of rigid body refinement and simulated annealing prior to building a 1.35 Å limiting resolution initial model of residues 160–254 in both polypeptide chains using the program O (30Jones T.A. Zou J-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13016) Google Scholar). Noncrystallographic symmetry constraints were applied during the early stages of refinement and were removed once the Rfree value dropped below 40%. Several additional rounds of model rebuilding and water addition, alternated with positional and individual B-factor refinement, yielded the final model. This model consists of residues 160–254 for both protein molecules in the asymmetric unit, in addition to the residues Gly-Ser-Thr (an artifact of subcloning) at the N terminus, and 304 ordered solvent molecules. Superposition of all Cα positions from both polypeptide chains revealed no significant structural differences between the two molecules (r.m.s.d. = 0.29 Å). Again, the orientation of the noncrystallographic symmetry axis is unlikely to reflect any physiologically relevant dimerization because the EAP2 protein behaves as a monomer in solution at concentrations up to 2 mm as judged by analytical size exclusion chromatography (data not shown).

Greater than 95% of the residues were found in the most favorable regions of the Ramachandran plot, and no residues were found in the disallowed regions. The final refinement statistics are shown in Tables II and III. The Three-dimensional Structures of Three EAP Domains— Two uncharacterized EAP domain proteins were identified from S. aureus strain Mu50 by a BLAST search of the nonredundant protein data base for small proteins that contain EAP domains. These proteins, denoted EapH1 (GenBank™ accession number NP_372729) and EapH2 (GenBank™ accession number NP_37505), each contain a signal peptide at their N terminus, followed by a unique stretch of 10–20 residues and then a single EAP domain. EapH1 and EapH2 share 47% identity with one another and are ∼35 and 42% identical to the second repeat in the Eap protein (EAP2), respectively (Table I). DNAs encoding the predicted mature forms of each protein, as well as EAP2, were amplified from bacterial genomic DNA, subcloned, and expressed in E. coli. Following purification, EapH1, EapH2, and EAP2 were crystallized by hanging drop vapor diffusion meth"

https://openalex.org/W2077620060,"Rip2 (Rick, Cardiak, CCK2, and CARD3) is a serine/threonine kinase containing a caspase recruitment domain (CARD) at the C terminus. Previous reports have shown that Rip2 is involved in multiple receptor signaling pathways that are important for innate and adaptive immune responses. However, it is not known whether Rip2 kinase activity is required for its function. Here we confirm that Rip2 participates in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/Toll-like receptor (TLR4) signaling and demonstrate that its kinase activity is not required. Upon LPS stimulation, Rip2 was transiently recruited to the TLR4 receptor complex and associated with key TLR signaling mediators IRAK1 and TRAF6. Furthermore, Rip2 kinase activity was induced by LPS treatment. These data indicate that Rip2 is directly involved in the LPS/TLR4 signaling. Whereas macrophages from Rip2-deficient mice showed impaired NF-κB and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation and reduced cytokine production in response to LPS stimulation, LPS signaling was intact in macrophages from mice that express Rip2 kinase-dead mutant. These results demonstrate that Rip2-mediated LPS signaling is independent of its kinase activity. Our findings strongly suggest that Rip2 functions as an adaptor molecule in transducing signals from immune receptors.

Ten mammalian TLRs have been discovered to date. TLR4 is the receptor for lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major cell wall component of Gram-negative bacteria. Activation of TLR4 by LPS leads to the activation of NF-κB and MAP kinase signaling pathways and induction of inflammatory cytokines (2Takeda K. Kaisho T. Akira S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 335-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (4690) Google Scholar, 3Akira S. Takeda K. Kaisho T. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (3895) Google Scholar, 4Medzhitov R. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 1: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (3192) Google Scholar). The TLR signaling pathway shares components common to IL-1 receptor signaling. Upon ligand binding, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK1) is recruited to the TLR complex through the adaptor protein MyD88/TIRAP. IRAK1 then dissociates from the receptor complex and associates with another adaptor protein TRAF6 to further activate downstream IKK kinase complex and MAP kinases. The IKK complex induces phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα, an inhibitor of transcription factor NF-κB, thus allowing NF-κB to translocate into the nucleus and induce target gene expression (5Li Q.

Cytokine production and activation of NF-κB and MAP kinases are impaired in Rip2-deficient cells in response to LPS stimulation. In addition to defective TLR signaling, Rip2 deficiency results in impaired signaling through the T-cell receptor (TCR) and IL-18/IL-12 receptor (15Kobayashi K. Inohara N. Hernandez L.D. Galan J.E.

The finding that Rip2 kinase-inactive mutant is capable of activating NF-κB reporter in 293 cells suggests that its kinase activity is dispensable (7McCarthy J.V. Ni J. Dixit V.M. J. Biol.

We also generated Rip2 knock-out mice for comparison. The data reported here demonstrate that Rip2-mediated LPS signaling is independent of its kinase activity. Thus, Rip2 functions as an adaptor molecule, rather than an active kinase, in LPS/TLR4 signaling.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression Vectors and Antibodies—TLR4 cDNA in pFLAG-CVM-1 vector was a generous gift from Dr. Elizabeth Brint (Trinity College, Ireland). CD14 expression vector was purchased from Invitrogen (GeneStorm expression-ready clone). Myc-tagged human Rip2 vector, TRAF6, and IRAK1 expression vectors were described previously (13Bertin J. Nir W.J. Fischer C.M. Tayber O.V. Errada P.R. Grant J.R. Keilty J.J. Gosselin M.L. Robison K.E. Wong G.H. Glucksmann M.A. DiStefano P.S. J. Biol.

Biol. 2001; 21: 4544-4552Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).Rip2 N-terminal peptide antibody, C-terminal peptide antibody and monoclonal antibody were purchased from Cayman Chemical, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and Alexis Biochemicals, respectively. Antibodies to IκBα, phospho-IκBα, p38 and phospho-p38 were from Cell Signaling Technology. IRAK1 antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY), and anti-TRAF6 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Monoclonal antibodies to FLAG tag, Myc tag, and V5 tag were purchased from Sigma, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and Invitrogen, respectively.Generation of Rip2 Knock-out and Kinase-dead Knock-in Mice—Rip2 knock-out (KO) mice and kinase-dead knock-in (KI) mice were generated by homologous recombination. The targeting vector for Rip2 KO was designed to remove a 204-base pair genomic fragment containing exon 1 that codes for the N-terminal sequences of Rip2 protein, including the kinase active site Lys47. To generate mice that express Rip2 kinase-dead mutant, Lys47 was mutated to Ala (K47A mutation) in the wild-type Rip2 allele. The mutated Rip2 allele was under the control of the endogenous Rip2 promoter. The KO and kinase-dead KI target vectors were electroporated into 129S5/SvEv ES cells. Targeted ES clones were identified by Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA and microinjected into C57BL/6 blastocytes. Germ line transmission of the targeted allele was confirmed by Southern blot of tail genomic DNA. The homozygous KO and kinase-dead KI mice were visible and fertile and showed no gross developmental abnormalities. Homozygous KO and kinase-dead KI mice and their respective wild-type littermates were used in experiments.RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from 1 × 107 mouse splenocytes using the RNeasy RNA isolation kit from Qiagen according to manufacturer's instructions. RT was carried out using Omniscript reverse transcriptase kit (Qiagen). Vent DNA polymerase (New England BioLabs) was used for PCRs. N-terminal PCR primers were 5′-ATGAACGGGGACGCCATCT-3′ and 5′-TGCAGGATGCGGAATCTCA-3′ and a 377-base pair PCR product corresponding to nucleotides 1–377 of Rip2 cDNA was amplified. The C-terminal primers were 5′-AGGAGGAATCGTGTGGATC-3′ and 5′-CAAGCTTTTATTCTGAGGG-3′, and PCR amplified a 595-base pair Rip2 C-terminal fragment corresponding to nucleotides 1022–1617. The PCR products were separated on agarose gels and visualized by EtBr staining. A fragment of hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase cDNA was also amplified by RT-PCR and served as control for the amount of sample loaded in each lane.Cloning of Mouse Rip2 cDNA—The Rip2 wild-type (WT) and K47A mutant cDNAs were cloned by RT-PCR using total RNA prepared from WT and K47A knock-in splenocytes, respectively. The following primers were used to clone the WT and K47A mutant fragments corresponding to nucleotides 1–1041 (coding for amino acids 1–347): 5′-GAGAATTCACCATGAACGGGGACGCCATCT-3′, containing an EcoRI site before the initiation codon, and 5′-TATATGCGGCCGCGGATCCACACGATTCCTCCT-3′, containing a NotI site after nucleotide 1041. The 5′ EcoRI and 3′ NotI restriction enzyme sites were introduced for subcloning purposes. To clone the WT and the K47A mutant full-length cDNA, overlapping extension PCR was used (19Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6796) Google Scholar). Briefly, two fragments were amplified (fragment 1, corresponding to the WT or K47A mutant nucleotides 1–1041 using primers 5′-ATGAACGGGGACGCCATCT-3′ and 5′-GGATCCACACGATTCCTCCT-3′, and fragment 2, corresponding to nucleotide 1022 to the C-terminal nucleotide 1617 using primers 5′-AGGAGGAATCGTGTGGATC-3′ and 5′-CAAGCTTTTATTCTGAGGG-3′). The two PCR fragments were purified and used as templates for overlapping extension PCR. The primers for overlapping PCR were designed to contain an EcoRI site prior to the initiation codon and a NotI site after the C-terminal amino acid Leu540. The final PCR products were digested with EcoRI and NotI and subcloned into the same sites of pTracer-EF/V5-His(C) vector (Invitrogen) for expression in 293T cells.293T Transfection, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot—For coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous Rip2 with TLR4, 293T cells were seeded in 10-cm tissue culture plates and transfected with FLAG-TLR4 (5 μg/plate) and CD14 plasmid DNA (5 μg/plate) using FuGENE6 reagents as described by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science). 48 h after transfection, the cells were treated with LPS from Salmonella abortus equi (Sigma) at 1 μg/ml for various time periods. MD2 was not transfected or added to the culture medium. The cells were then washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) from Cell Signaling Technology with the addition of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell lysate containing 1.5 mg of total protein was incubated with 10 μg of antibody to the FLAG tag overnight at 4 °C, followed by the addition of 25 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and incubation for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, and bound proteins were eluted in NuPAGE SDS sample loading buffer (Invitrogen) for 5 min at 95 °C. The immunoprecipitates were separated on NuPAGE 4–12% bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% dry milk and incubated with anti-Rip2, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences). The blot was developed using a chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences).For coimmunoprecipitation of Rip2 with IRAK1 and TRAF6 in 293T cells, Myc-tagged Rip2 was cotransfected with IRAK1 or TRAF6. 48 h after transfection, the cells were collected and lysed. The lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using antibody to Myc tag and Western blot with anti-IRAK1 or anti-TRAF6. For coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous Rip2, THP1 cells were cultured in serum-free medium overnight and treated with LPS at 1 μg/ml for various time periods. Endogenous Rip2 protein was immunoprecipitated with the C-terminal peptide antibody to Rip2 and analyzed by Western blot using anti-IRAK1 or anti-TRAF6.In Vitro Autophosphorylation—Endogenous or recombinant Rip2 protein was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates. The immunoprecipitates were washed five times with lysis buffer and two times with kinase buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mm MgCl2) from Cell Signaling Technology and resuspended in 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 20 μCi of [γ-P33]ATP and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The kinase reaction mixtures were separated on NuPAGE 4–12% bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was exposed in a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). The same membrane was probed with Rip2 antibody to determine the level of Rip2 protein.Culture of Mouse Bone Marrow-derived Macrophages and LPS Stimulation—Bone marrow was collected from 8–12-week-old mice by gentle flushing of whole femurs with phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% fetal bovine serum. The cell suspension was layered over Lympholyle-M (Cedarlane) and centrifuged for 30 min at 500 × g. After centrifugation, the interface was collected, and cells were spun down and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline plus 2% fetal bovine serum. The bone marrow cells were cultured overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum. The following day, nonadherent cells were collected and plated in 10-cm tissue culture plates at a density of 1 × 107 cells/plate in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 15% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 20 ng/ml mouse macrophage colony-stimulating factor. The cells were fed with fresh medium containing mouse macrophage colony-stimulating factor twice a week. On day 10, the cells were stimulated with 50 ng/ml LPS from S. abortus equi (Sigma) for various time periods. Cell lysates were prepared and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot as described above.Measurement of Cytokine Production by Macrophages—Total bone marrow cells were obtained as described above and plated in a 96-well plate at a density of 1 × 105/well. After culture for 10 days in the presence of mouse macrophage colony-stimulating factor, macrophages were stimulated with 50 ng/ml LPS for 6 h. Culture supernatants were harvested, and production of IL-6 and TNFα was determined using mouse IL-6 and TNFα enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit, respectively (R&D).RESULTSRip2 Transiently Associates with TLR4 after LPS Stimulation—Recent studies have shown that LPS signaling is impaired in Rip2-deficient cells and mice (15Kobayashi K. Inohara N. Hernandez L.D. Galan J.E. Nunez G. Janeway C.A. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2002; 416: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 16Chin A.I. Dempsey P.W. Bruhn K. Miller J.F. Xu Y. Cheng G. Nature. 2002; 416: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). We investigated whether Rip2 was recruited to the TLR4 signaling complex upon LPS treatment. 293T cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged TLR4 and CD14 and treated with LPS. These transfectants responded to LPS in the absence of MD2, since LPS treatment induced NF-κB reporter activation (data not shown). Association of endogenous Rip2 with FLAG-TLR4 was examined by coimmunoprecipitation. As shown in Fig. 1A, Rip2 transiently associated with TLR4 upon LPS treatment. Association peaked at 5 min and decreased after 15 min of LPS treatment. These results indicate that Rip2 is transiently recruited to the TLR4 signaling complex after LPS stimulation.We further tested whether Rip2 interacted with key mediators of LPS-induced signaling to NF-κB activation. We first co-expressed Myc-tagged Rip2 with IRAK1, TRAF6, or IKKβ in 293T cells. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that Rip2 associated with IRAK1 and TRAF6 (Fig. 1, B and C), but not with IKKβ (data not shown), indicating specific interaction of Rip2 with IRAK1 and TRAF6. We next examined association of endogenous Rip2 with IRAK1 and TRAF6 in THP1 cells. THP1 cells were treated with LPS for various time periods, and association of Rip2 with IRAK1 and TRAF6 was determined by coimmunoprecipitation. Endogenous Rip2 associated with IRAK1 after 5 min of LPS treatment, and the association decreased after 10 min (Fig. 1D). Association of Rip2 with TRAF6 was detected after LPS treatment for 5 min, peaked at 10–15 min, and decreased at 30 min (Fig. 1E). Thus, LPS induces transient association of endogenous Rip2 with IRAK1 and TRAF6. These findings strongly suggest that Rip2 directly participates in TLR4 signaling.Rip2 Kinase Activity Is Induced by LPS Treatment—We investigated whether LPS treatment induced Rip2 kinase activity. THP1 cells were treated with LPS for various time periods. Endogenous Rip2 protein was immunoprecipitated, and Rip2 kinase activity was determined by in vitro autophosphorylation. Basal kinase activity was low (Fig. 2, top). LPS treatment for 5 min greatly increased Rip2 kinase activity and maximal kinase activity was detected at 15 min. By 30 min of LPS treatment, the kinase activity decreased to basal level. The level of Rip2 protein was not changed during LPS treatment (Fig. 2, bottom). Thus, LPS transiently induces Rip2 kinase activity.Fig. 2Rip2 kinase activity is induced by LPS treatment. THP1 cells were treated with 1 μg/ml LPS for the indicated time periods. Endogenous Rip2 protein was immunoprecipitated with the C-terminal peptide antibody to Rip2 and subjected to an in vitro autophosphorylation assay. The kinase reaction mixtures were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was exposed in a PhosphorImager (top). The same membrane was probed with Rip2 monoclonal antibody (bottom).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Targeted Inactivation of Rip2 Kinase Activity in Mouse—To investigate the role of the kinase activity in Rip2 function, we generated Rip2 kinase-dead KI mice in which the conserved ATP-binding residue Lys47 in the kinase domain was replaced by alanine (K47A mutation). We also generated Rip2 KO mice for comparison. Rip2 deficiency in KO mice was confirmed by the absence of Rip2 mRNA and protein (Fig. 3, A and B). Sequencing of Rip2 cDNA isolated from kinase-dead KI cells confirmed the presence of the K47A mutation in KI mice. Although the Rip2 mRNA level from kinase-dead KI cells was comparable with that in cells from WT littermates (Fig. 3A), the level of Rip2 protein in KI cells was greatly reduced compared with that from WT cells (Fig. 3B). However, the K47A mutant protein in KI macrophages was up-regulated by LPS stimulation similar to the WT protein (Fig. 3C), indicating that regulation of the Rip2 gene expression is intact in kinase-dead KI mice.Fig. 3Expression of Rip2 mRNA and protein in cells from Rip2 kinase-dead KI and KO mice.A, mRNA expression. Total RNA was isolated from splenocytes of Rip2 kinase-dead KI or KO mice or WT littermates. Expression of Rip2 mRNA was determined by RT-PCR using the C-terminal primer pair (CT) and the N-terminal primer pair (NT) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, Rip2 protein expression in splenocytes. Lysates were prepared from splenocytes of KI or KO mice or WT littermates and analyzed by Western blot using the N-terminal antibody (NT-Ab) or the monoclonal antibody (mAb) to Rip2. The level of p38 protein was used for sample loading control. p38 protein level was not affected by Rip2 kinase-dead knock-in or Rip2 knock-out. C, Rip2 protein in kinase-dead KI macrophages is inducible by LPS stimulation. Bone marrow-derived macrophages from kinase-dead KI mice or WT littermates were treated with or without LPS (50 ng/ml) for 6 h. Cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by Western blot using antibodies as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further investigate the expression of Rip2 K47A mutant protein, Rip2 cDNAs encoding the K47A mutant and WT protein were isolated from kinase-dead KI and WT splenocytes, respectively, and expressed in 293T cells under the control of a constitutive promoter. The expression of the WT and K47A mutant protein was determined by Western blot. Consistent with the observation in cells from kinase-dead KI mice, the level of the full-length K47A mutant protein was significantly lower than the full-length WT protein expressed in 293T cells (Fig. 4A). However, the K47A mutant protein with the truncation of the CARD domain and the intermediate domain (amino acids 1–347) was expressed at a similar level to the truncated WT protein (Fig. 4A). These results suggest that the K47A mutation may cause instability of the full-length Rip2 protein.Fig. 4Expression and kinase activity of Rip2 WT and K47A mutant protein.A, Rip2 WT and K47A mutant cDNAs encoding the full-length protein (FL) or the kinase domain (amino acids 1–347) were isolated from WT and kinase-dead knock-in spelenocytes, respectively, and expressed with V5 tag at the C terminus in 293T cells under the control of the EF-1α promoter. The expression level of Rip2 WT and K47A mutant protein was determined by Western blot using antibody to the V5 tag. Same amounts of plasmid DNA were used for 293T transfection. Two independent clones of each construct were analyzed. B, K47A mutation abolishes Rip2 kinase activity. Rip2 WT and K47A mutant protein (amino acids 1–347) was expressed in 293T cells and immunoprecipitated with anti-V5 antibody. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to in vitro autophosphorylation, followed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging (top). The amount of immunoprecipitated Rip2 protein was determined by Western blot with Rip2 antibody (bottom). C, Rip2 from kinase-dead KI cells is kinase-inactive. Bone marrow-derived macrophages from kinase-dead KI mice or WT littermates were treated with LPS for 6 h. Rip2 protein was immunoprecipitated with the C-terminal peptide antibody to Rip2 and subjected to in vitro autophosphorylation, followed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging (top). The amount of immunoprecipitated Rip2 protein was determined by Western blot using the monoclonal antibody to Rip2 (bottom).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To test that the K47A mutation indeed abrogated Rip2 kinase activity, the truncated WT and K47A proteins were immunoprecipitated from transfected 293T cells, and the kinase activity was determined by in vitro autophosphorylation (Fig. 4B). As expected, the K47A mutant protein failed to autophosphorylate.We further tested autophosphorylation of Rip2 in response to LPS in cells isolated from kinase-dead KI mice. Macrophages from KI mice or WT littermates were treated with LPS, endogenous Rip2 was immunoprecipitated, and in vitro autophosphorylation was assayed. Similar amounts of Rip2 protein from WT and kinase-dead KI macrophages were used for an autophosphorylation assay (Fig. 4C, bottom). Although autophosphorylation of Rip2 from WT macrophages was detected, no autophosphorylation of Rip2 from kinase-dead KI cells was observed (Fig. 4C, top).Rip2 Kinase Activity Is Not Required for LPS Signaling— Recent reports show that Rip2 deficiency in mice results in impaired LPS signaling (15Kobayashi K. Inohara N. Hernandez L.D. Galan J.E. Nunez G. Janeway C.A. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2002; 416: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 16Chin A.I. Dempsey P.W. Bruhn K. Miller J.F. Xu Y. Cheng G. Nature. 2002; 416: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Rip2 kinase activity is required for LPS-triggered signaling events, we examined LPS-induced activation of p38 MAP kinase and NF-κB in macrophages from Rip2 kinase-dead knock-in mice and compared it with that in Rip2 knock-out cells. Bone marrow-derived macrophages were treated with LPS for various time periods. Activation of p38 was determined using a phosphospecific antibody in Western blot. Activation of NF-κB was determined by the phosphorylation state and degradation of IκBα, an inhibitor of NF-κB (5Li Q. Verma I.M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (3254) Google Scholar, 6Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: 81-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3273) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous reports, Rip2 knock-out macrophages showed reduced levels of p38 and IκBα phosphorylation and reduced IκBα degradation in response to LPS stimulation (Fig. 5B). By contrast, in Rip2 kinase-dead knock-in macrophages, LPS-induced phosphorylation of p38 and IκBα, and degradation of IκBα was normal, as shown by comparison with cells from wild-type littermates (Fig. 5A). These results indicate that Rip2 kinase activity is not involved in LPS-induced p38 MAP kinase activation and NF-κB activation pathways.Fig. 5Rip2 kinase activity is not required for LPS-induced ac"
https://openalex.org/W2065190301,"Malignant hyperthermia (MH) and central core disease (CCD) are caused by mutations in the RYR1 gene encoding the skeletal muscle isoform of the ryanodine receptor (RyR1), a homotetrameric Ca(2+) release channel. Rabbit RyR1 mutant cDNAs carrying mutations corresponding to those in human RyR1 that cause MH and CCD were expressed in HEK-293 cells, which do not have endogenous RyR, and in primary cultures of rat skeletal muscle, which express rat RyR1. Analysis of intracellular Ca(2+) pools was performed using aequorin probes targeted to the lumen of the endo/sarcoplasmic reticulum (ER/SR), to the mitochondrial matrix, or to the cytosol. Mutations associated with MH caused alterations in intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis different from those associated with CCD. Measurements of luminal ER/SR Ca(2+) revealed that the mutations generated leaky channels in all cases, but the leak was particularly pronounced in CCD mutants. Cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca(2+) transients induced by caffeine stimulation were drastically augmented in the MH mutant, slightly reduced in one CCD mutant (Y523S) and completely abolished in another (I4898T). The results suggest that local Ca(2+) derangements of different degrees account for the specific cellular phenotypes of the two disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2121881411,"The hyaluronic acid receptor, CD44, exists as multiple splice variants that appear to have a role in migration of tumor cells. The role of this receptor and its variants in normal wound repair is poorly understood. A central feature of wound repair in the liver is activation and migration of perisinusoidal stellate cells. We have examined CD44 expression by stellate cells from normal or injured rat liver, finding that it increases with injury and involves a distinct set of CD44 splice variants. Among the latter, variants containing the v6 exon (CD44v6) are strikingly increased. Analysis of migration of primary cells on transwell filter inserts reveals that only cells isolated from injured liver are migratory. Also, they move more rapidly on hyaluronic acid than on collagen I or collagen IV. A polyclonal antibody to recombinant CD44v6 blocks migration by 50%, whereas antibody to CD44v4 has no effect. The inhibition is specific for cells migrating on hyaluronic acid and is reversed by synthetic peptide representing the N terminus of the v6 protein. In conclusion, activated stellate cells use CD44v6 and hyaluronic acid for migration. Given the evidence that migration is required for progression of injury with scar formation, blockers of CD44v6 expression or function are candidates for preventing the deleterious effects of chronic fibrosis.

In conclusion, activated stellate cells use CD44v6 and hyaluronic acid for migration. Given the evidence that migration is required for progression of injury with scar formation, blockers of CD44v6 expression or function are candidates for preventing the deleterious effects of chronic fibrosis. A prominent aspect of the liver's response to injury involves perisinusoidal cells termed stellate cells. With injury, stellate cells undergo activation, displaying a smooth muscle/myofibroblast phenotype characterized by fibrogenesis, migration, and contractility (1Bissell D.M. Exp. Mol. Med. 2001; 33: 179-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Activated cells aggregate around the injury, where they elaborate collagens and other extracellular matrix proteins that serve as a scaffold on which repair proceeds. When injury is recurrent and chronic, production of extracellular matrix outstrips its removal. Over time, the repair matrix coalesces into dense bands that are populated by activated stellate cells. This process results in the pathological appearance of fibrosis, which can progress to cirrhosis with disruption of lobular architecture and altered blood flow. Cell migration is fundamental to wound repair, and studies have shown that stellate cells migrate to the area of injury within the liver (2Horn T. Junge J. Christoffersen P. J. Hepatol. 1986; 3: 333-340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Several aspects of stellate cell migration have been examined, including chemotactic factors (3Marra F.

There is accumulating evidence that a milieu rich in hyaluronic acid (HA 1The abbreviations used are: HA, hyaluronic acid; HSC, hepatic stellate cell(s); 6-FAM, 6-carboxyfluorescein; BHQ1, Black Hole Quencher-1.1The abbreviations used are: HA, hyaluronic acid; HSC, hepatic stellate cell(s); 6-FAM, 6-carboxyfluorescein; BHQ1, Black Hole Quencher-1.; hyaluronan) is particularly conducive to migration. CD44 is well characterized as a major receptor for HA (10Turley E.A. Noble P.W. Bourguignon L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 4589-4592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). Whereas it is a single gene of 50 kilobases, it is expressed as a large number of variant forms due to a region of 10 exons that undergo alternative splicing in the nascent mRNA. The N-terminal extracellular portion of the protein, representing exons 1–5, is constant. The C-terminal constant region comprises exon 17, which encodes the transmembrane portion, and exons 18–20, representing a short intracellular region. Exons 6–15 are subject to individual alternative splicing. Each may be included or excluded, giving rise to a multitude of isoforms in which the juxtamembranous region of the protein varies. The differing roles of CD44 in tissue injury and repair may reflect exonic variation. These range from local binding and transcytosis of inflammatory cells (11Toole B.P. Wight T.N. Tammi M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4593-4596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) and induction of chemokine and cytokine responses (10Turley E.A. Noble P.W. Bourguignon L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 4589-4592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar) to smooth muscle migration and contraction (12Cuff C.A. Kothapalli D. Azonobi I. Chun S. Zhang Y. Belkin R. Yeh C. Secreto A. Assoian R.K. Rader D.J. Pure E. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1031-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Few data directly link individual splice variants specifically to migration, and the role of CD44 in liver injury is unknown. Substantial effort has been directed at defining the biological roles of specific CD44 splice isoforms. Expression of CD44v6 is prominent in models of tumor metastasis (13Rall C.J. Rustgi A.K. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1831-1835PubMed Google Scholar, 14Reeder J.A. Gotley D.C. Walsh M.D. Fawcett J. Antalis T.M. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3719-3726PubMed Google Scholar). In a model of vascular injury, it was shown that CD44v6 is up-regulated in smooth muscle cells at the luminal edge of the expanding neointima (15Jain M. He Q. Lee W.S. Kashiki S. Foster L.C. Tsai J.C. Lee M.E. Haber E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 596-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, there is a paucity of data on isoform-specific changes and their function in epithelial injury in vivo. In experimental studies of liver injury in vivo, an increase in total CD44 was noted with toxin-induced cirrhosis (16Satoh T. Ichida T. Matsuda Y. Sugiyama M. Yonekura K. Ishikawa T. Asakura H. J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2000; 15: 402-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar); in acute injury induced by partial hepatectomy, there was an increase specifically in CD44v6, although the cellular source of this variant was not determined (17Della Fazia M.A. Pettirossi V. Ayroldi E. Riccardi C. Magni M.V. Servillo G. J. Hepatol. 2001; 34: 555-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In the present studies, we have examined the diversity of CD44 expression in stellate cells from normal and injured liver, respectively. The results show that CD44v6 plays a major role in mediating the migration of activated stellate cells in liver injury. Materials—TRI Reagent was obtained from Molecular Research Center Inc. (Cincinnati, OH), collagenase was from Crescent Chemical Co. (Islandia, NY), Pronase was from Roche Applied Science, Accudenz® was from Accurate Chemical and Scientific Corp. (Westbury, NY), and ASF104 medium was from Ajinomoto (Tokyo, Japan). Animals, Liver Injury Model, and Cell Isolation—Sprague-Dawley rats (male retired breeders, ∼700 g body weight) were anesthetized with isoflurane and subjected to surgery according to a protocol approved by the Institutional Committee on Animal Care. Total bile duct ligation was carried out as described previously (18Jarnagin W.R. Rockey D.C. Koteliansky V.E. Wang S.S. Bissell D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 2037-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). On the fourth postoperative day, the liver was dispersed by enzymatic perfusion in situ. The method was a modification of one previously published from this laboratory. In brief, 100 USP units of heparin were injected into abdominal inferior vena cava, and cannulas were placed in the portal vein and inferior vena cava. The liver was perfused via the portal vein with 0.40 peptide hydrolysis unit/ml collagenase and 0.08% Pronase in Ham's Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at a rate of 10 ml/min for 20 min at 37 °C. The digested liver was removed and minced with scissors and then incubated in 0.05% Pronase, 0.50 peptide hydrolysis unit/ml collagenase, and 20 μg/ml DNase I (Roche Applied Science) for 25 min at 37 °C with rotary shaking at 200 rpm. The digest was passed through sterile gauze to eliminate large debris, and the cells were pelleted at room temperature (2000 rpm for 7 min). The pellet was resuspended in Ham's Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and layered on a discontinuous gradient of Accudenz®; the upper and lower layers were specific gravity 17.8 and 10.4, respectively. After centrifugation in a swinging bucket rotor at 20,000 rpm for 30 min (20 °C), HSC were recovered from the interface between the two layers. Yields averaged ∼2,000,000 HSC from an individual rat; purity was >95%. Three types of stellate cell preparations were studied: (a) normal cells isolated from unoperated or sham-operated animals; the cells either were analyzed immediately or were placed in short term primary culture (up to 96 h); (b) in vivo activated cells isolated from animals subjected to bile duct ligation as described above; and (c) culture-activated cells representing normal stellate cells that were allowed to undergo spontaneous activation in primary culture (5–9 days in serum-containing medium). Primary Culture and Migration Assay—For migration assays on transwell inserts, freshly isolated HSC were cultured initially in ASF104 medium or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum. The seeding density was ∼5,000 cells/insert, with 200 μl of medium in the insert and 500 μl in the well. After 24–48 h of culture, the medium was switched to serum-free ASF104 for 12 h, which was taken as the zero time point of migration. After a migration period of 12, 24, and 36 h, inserts were fixed and stained. Ten fields (×400) with individual cells only (clusters were ignored) were randomly picked per insert. By focusing in the appropriate plane, the top or bottom of the filter was visualized for counting the number of cells on each surface. On average, a field contained 100–200 cells, and 10 fields were counted. The migration index was defined as the percentage of cells in a field on the bottom side of the filter: (number of cells on the bottom)/(number of cells on the top and bottom) × 100. Amplification and Cloning of CD44 Splice Variants—RNA extraction and purification was carried out with TRI reagent, according to the protocol provided by the supplier. The integrity of the purified RNA was verified by visualization of 28 S and 18 S bands on 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. Reverse transcription was carried out with oligo(dT) primer. The CD44 v1–v10 was amplified by PCR using primers bracketing this region. Forward primer was CTTCTTTATTGGGAGCACCCTGGCC; reverse primer was ACACTGTGACTCATGGATCCGAATT. Conditions were as follows: annealing temperature 94 °C and 30 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s; 63 °C for 45 s; 72 °C for 1 min. Amplification of CD44 with no variable exons yielded a band of 93 bp. Quantitation of mRNA—For quantitation of mRNA by an RNase protection assay, total cellular RNA was isolated as above and suspended in water at a concentration of ∼1 μg/ml. Approximately 40 μg were used for assaying CD44v6. As an internal loading control, S-14 mRNA, which encodes a ribosomal protein, was measured in the same samples using 10 μg of total RNA; expression of S-14 by stellate cells changes minimally in liver injury (18Jarnagin W.R. Rockey D.C. Koteliansky V.E. Wang S.S. Bissell D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 2037-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). For probe preparation, the appropriate CD44 region was cloned into pGEM4Z. Radiolabeled cRNA was prepared using ∼1 μg of cut plasmid, [32P]CTP (80 μCi) and T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase, depending on the orientation of the cloned fragment. After digestion with DNase, the labeled material was purified with a NucTrap column and counted. The final mixture contained ∼106 cpm of probe and cellular RNA. The hybridization temperature was 55 °C. Samples were digested with T2 RNase. The primer sequences and TaqMan® probes used for quantitative PCR are as follows (F, forward; R, reverse). Primers were V0-F (TCCACCATTGAGAAGAGCACC), V4-R (CACTGGGTCCGTTCCTGG), V6-R (CCCCTGCCATTCATTCTCAA), V0/11-F (CGGGATGACGCCTTCTTTATT), and V0/11-R (CCAGCTAATTCGGATCCATGA). Probes were V0 (6-FAM-CAGAACCAGGAACGGACCCAGTGG-BHQ1), V4 (6-FAM-CAGAACCAGGAACGGACCCAGTGG-BHQ1), V6 (6-FAM-TGGGCAGATCCTAATAGCACAACAGAAGAAG-BHQ1), V0/V11 (6-FAMACCCTGGCCACCAGTGATGGAGACT-BHQ1). The amplification conditions were as follows: 25 °C for 10 min, 48 °C for 40 min, 95 °C for 5 min. All assays were checked in preliminary studies for efficiency and linearity. Expression levels were normalized to an internal standard (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase). Immunological Assays—Polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits using recombinant rat CD44v4 (amino acids 384–423) or V6 (amino acids 463–505) as the immunogen. IgG was purified from whole antisera on a HiTrap™ N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated HP column (Amersham Biosciences). In migration assays, the antibody was introduced at 10 μg/ml. For Western blots, HSC cell lysate (50 μg) was separated on a 7.5% gel by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Hybond™-P; Amersham Biosciences). After blocking with 5% skim milk, the membrane was incubated with rabbit anti-rat CD44v6 polyclonal antibody at 1:1000 dilution. Controls included nonspecific rabbit IgG in place of the primary antibody. Detection was by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL-plus; Amersham Biosciences). For validating the specificity of the inhibitory effect of the anti-v6 antibody on HSC migration, synthetic peptides representing the N-terminal or C-terminal half of the v6 domain were prepared. The sequences were as follows: N-terminal peptide (CD44v6N), WADPNSTTEEAATQKEKWFE; C-terminal peptide (CD44v6C), NEWQGKNPPTPSEDSHVTEGTTA. The peptides were mixed with the polyclonal rabbit anti-v6 and then introduced into the migration assay described above. Substratum Dependence of Stellate Cell Migration in Two Dimensions—As an initial screen for cell-matrix interactions mediating migration, we studied the movement of stellate cells in two dimensions. Cells isolated from normal liver or after bile duct ligation were plated on chamber well slides coated with specific matrix components mixed with collagen I (which fosters attachment of both quiescent and activated stellate cells). With relatively high density plating, the cells were confluent after 2–3 days of culture. A sterile pipette tip was used to clear a track in the plate, and migration of cells into the area was monitored. Stellate cells isolated from normal rat liver showed no significant migration on any surface (data not shown). Activated stellate cells migrated much more rapidly on a surface with HA than on collagen I alone (Fig. 1). CD44 Expression by Hepatic Stellate Cells—These initial observations suggested that HA fosters migration of activated stellate cells. Therefore, we probed for expression of the HA receptor, CD44, initially by reverse transcription-PCR using primers bracketing the v1–v10 variable exon group. The substrate was mRNA from freshly isolated normal stellate cells, freshly isolated in vivo activated stellate cells, or culture-activated stellate cells (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown (Fig. 2), gel analysis of the PCR results revealed multiple CD44 variants from all preparations (Fig. 2, left). By comparison with cells from normal liver, stellate cells from the injured liver exhibited several additional bands including one of 735 nucleotides, which was particularly prominent (Fig. 2, arrow). This band was excised from the gel, cloned, and sequenced, and it was found to represent CD44 containing v6–v10. Interestingly, it is not increased in the RNA extract of culture-activated stellate cells. The products of amplification from normal and in vivo activated stellate cells were mass cloned (Fig. 2, right) and sequenced for identifying individual splice variants. The composite results are shown in Fig. 3. Overall, the number of variants from in vivo activated cells was increased. All contained v6, and some of these had exons (v2 and v3) that were not present in the variants from normal cells. When we quantified expression of the v6 isoform using an RNase protection assay, we found it to be markedly up-regulated in activated stellate cells (Fig. 4). Of note, in culture-activated cells, the level of expression is similar to that of quiescent (normal) cells.Fig. 4Injury-related change in CD44v6 mRNA in hepatic stellate cells. RNA was isolated from normal stellate cells, in vivo activated stellate cells, and stellate cells that had been allowed to undergo spontaneous activation during 7 days in culture. CD44v6 mRNA was quantified by RNase protection assay. S-14 mRNA served as a loading control. Yeast tRNA was used in place of stellate cell RNA as a control for nonspecific protection of the labeled probe.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The profiles shown in Fig. 3 also indicate that activated stellate cells generate variants without v8 and/or v9. To assess their importance, we quantified the mRNA for v8–v10. We found that CD44v8–v10 was nearly as abundant as CD44v6 mRNA (data not shown). This confirms that the principal v6-containing variant is CD44v6–v10 rather than isoforms lacking v7, v8, and/or v9. Expression of variants containing CD44v6 was assessed also at the protein level by immunoblot using our polyclonal antibody to CD44v6. The data are consistent with the mRNA findings, in that the higher molecular weight forms are relatively increased in activated stellate cells from injured liver. Also, activated stellate cells exhibit several lower molecular weight forms, which are undetectable in extracts of quiescent stellate cells (Fig. 5). For quantifying the isoforms with variable exons v1–v6, we used real time PCR with primers and probe as shown (Fig. 6A). We also examined the level of expression of “standard” CD44 (sCD44), which has no variable domains, using a probe that straddles the invariant exons on either side of the variant region (v0/11); sCD44 is the principal form in hematological cells (19Dougherty G.J. Cooper D.L. Memory J.F. Chiu R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9074-9078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With injury, there is a 5–6-fold increase in expression of v4-containing and v6-containing forms as well as sCD44. Given that all of the splice variants that we identified with v4 also contain v5 and v6 (Fig. 3), it appears that these variant exons appear largely as a group. Thus, in addition to CD44v6-v10, CD44v4-v10 (with or without v2 and v3, respectively) is relatively highly expressed. Interestingly, sCD44 (with no variant exons) is a minor fraction of the total, 25–30% in resting stellate cells and 15–20% in in vivo activated cells. Total CD44 was determined using primers and probe for an invariant exon (v0, data not shown). Migration of Stellate Cells in Transwell Culture—Freshly isolated stellate cells were placed in transwells prepared with various matrix components and incubated for 24 h to allow regeneration of surface proteins that might have been damaged by the enzymatic isolation. The upper and lower surfaces of transwell filters were visualized individually by setting the plane of focus of the microscope objective. UV fluorescence reveals the retinoid-containing vesicles that are characteristic of stellate cells and was used to confirm stellate cell identity (Fig. 7). The cells from normal or injured liver attached in serum-free medium with comparable efficiency and were morphologically similar. With an additional 24 h of incubation in serum-free medium, most cells remained round. In serum-containing medium, they rapidly assumed a fibroblastic shape. Under either condition, cells with a fibroblastic profile were incapable of migration. Only rounded cells migrated (Fig. 8).Fig. 8Morphology of stellate cells on filter inserts in serum-free medium. The presence of intracellular UV-fluorescing vesicles confirms that the observed cells are stellate cells (d–f). The upper (c and f) and lower (a, b, d, and e) surfaces of the filter insert are visualized independently. The uniformly round profiles are the 8-μm pores of the filter insert. The migration index is the percentage of cells in a field present on the lower surface. nHSC, normal stellate cells. vaHSC, in vivo activated stellate cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Stellate cell migration was tested on transwell filters coated with HA, collagen I, or collagen IV; uncoated filters were included for comparison. Cells isolated from normal liver showed minimal migration on any of these surfaces (Fig. 9a). In contrast, activated cells from injured liver were migratory on all substrata and notably so on HA. The migration rate on HA was double that on collagen I or uncoated plastic. Collagen IV supported an intermediate rate of migration (Fig. 9b). Role of CD44v6 in HA-mediated Migration of Hepatic Stellate Cells—We next asked whether the strikingly increased expression of CD44v6 was involved in migration of activated stellate cells. For this purpose, antibody to the v6 domain was introduced into the migration assay described in the legend to Fig. 9. Antibody to v4 was used for comparison. Anti-v6 reduced migration and was specific for HA; when the substratum was collagen I, collagen IV, or uncoated plastic, it had no effect. Anti-v4 had no effect on migration on any of the substrata (Fig. 10). To confirm that the effect of anti-v6 was specific to this exon, we mixed v6 domain peptide, either N-terminal or C-terminal, with the antibody before adding the mixture to the migration assay. As shown (Fig. 11), the N-terminal peptide reversed the effect of anti-v6, whereas the C-terminal peptide had no effect. This result establishes the specificity of the antibody inhibition and indicates that the migration-facilitating region of CD44v6 resides in its N-terminal half.Fig. 11Effect of competing peptide on the inhibitory activity of anti-CD44v6. Synthetic peptide representing either the N-terminal half of the v6 exon (a) or the C-terminal half (b) were introduced into migration assays with or without anti-CD44v6. The N-terminal peptide reversed the inhibitory effect of anti-CD44v6 in a concentration-dependent manner; the C-terminal peptide had no effect.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The goal of our studies was to define the cell-matrix interactions that mediate stellate cell migration. We found that the HA receptor, CD44, plays a key role. This extracellular matrix receptor system changes rapidly in liver injury in vivo, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Particularly prominent is an increase in CD44v6, which appears as a component of multiple splice variants but is dominated by v6–v10 and v4–v10. Based on antibody inhibition studies, the v4 exon appears to have no direct role in migration. The role of v7–v10 is speculative. We found that a blocking antibody to v9 reduced migration but with about half the effect of anti-CD44v6 2S. Kikuchi and D. M. Bissell, unpublished observation.; this could indicate a role for v9 or could involve steric hindrance of v6 by antibody binding to v9. The way in which the v6 variable exon exerts its effect is speculative. It has been reported that high affinity binding of HA by CD44 requires the presence of v4–v7 (20Sleeman J. Rudy W. Hofmann M. Moll J. Herrlich P. Ponta H. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1139-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Also, the presence of exons v4–v7 fosters clustering of CD44 within the membrane, an event that allows formation of a complex with a matrix proteinase (gelatinase B or matrix metalloproteinase-9) (21Yu Q. Stamenkovic I. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 163-176PubMed Google Scholar). By altering the pericellular matrix and cell-matrix attachment, the latter may facilitate migration. It has been shown that stellate cell migration is blocked by inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 (7Yang C. Zeisberg M. Mosterman B. Sudhakar A. Yerramalla U. Holthaus K. Xu L. Eng F. Afdhal N. Kalluri R. Gastroenterology. 2003; 124: 147-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). These proteinases are present in the liver, matrix metalloproteinase-2 being secreted by Kupffer cells and matrix metalloproteinase-9 by stellate cells (22Arthur M.J. Friedman S.L. Roll F.J. Bissell D.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1076-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Although expression of CD44v6 appears to be important to stellate cell migration, its role is not exclusive. Collagens are part of the wound repair environment, and our data indicate that stellate cells utilize type IV collagen as a migration substratum (Fig. 9). Migration on collagen IV is unaffected by anti-CD44v6, as expected, because this protein is not a ligand for CD44. However, it is blocked by antibody to α1/β1 integrin, 3S. Kikuchi, A. De Fougerolles, and D. M. Bissell, unpublished data. which is expressed by stellate cells (23Racine-Samson L. Rockey D.C. Bissell D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30911-30917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The question of whether other HA receptors, such as RHAMM, are involved (10Turley E.A. Noble P.W. Bourguignon L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 4589-4592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar) has not been examined as yet. The use of a particular receptor-ligand system depends not only on receptor expression but also on the stage of injury and the composition of the “injury” matrix. HA is prominent in early injury. Stellate cells produce it in primary culture (24Vrochides D. Papanikolaou V. Pertoft H. Antoniades A.A. Heldin P. Hepatology. 1996; 23: 1650-1655Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In liver injury, their production of HA increases in parallel with expression of CD44 (16Satoh T. Ichida T. Matsuda Y. Sugiyama M. Yonekura K. Ishikawa T. Asakura H. J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2000; 15: 402-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). HA is a large polydisaccharide (ranging up to 10,000 kDa), which combines with proteoglycans such as versican to form giant water-holding complexes. This hydrodynamic property of HA-proteoglycan may be fundamental to its role in migration and metastasis, altering the pericellular space so as to loosen the anchoring attachments of cells (11Toole B.P. Wight T.N. Tammi M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4593-4596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). A matrix rich in HA is found at the leading edge of migrating smooth muscle cells (25Evanko S.P. Angello J.C. Wight T.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 1004-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). The rounded shape of actively migratory cells in our studies (as in Fig. 7c) may be due to pericellular HA, which is presented by the precoated filter and, in the case of activated cells, is also endogenous. Cells with a fibroblastic morphology increase with time in culture, develop anchoring attachments, and become nonmigratory (Fig. 7d). The observations in culture suggest two stages of stellate cell activation: an early stage of active migration, followed by the development of actin cables and focal adhesion to matrix molecules that render the cells stationary. Based on the studies with culture-activated stellate cells, the latter event is accompanied by down-regulation of CD44v6 at the cell surface. Unlike previous studies, the present one has examined CD44 splice variants in vivo by interrogating cells that are isolated directly from normal or injured tissue. We captured the in vivo phenotype by minimizing the time that the cells were maintained in culture. Numerous observations have established that normal stellate cells undergo a spontaneous change of phenotype as they adapt to culture. The cells acquire several characteristics of myofibroblasts that have been characterized broadly as mimicking the response to injury (26Friedman S.L. J. Gastroenterol. 1997; 32: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Our focus in these studies was on stellate cells activated in vivo, in part because differences between in vivo activated and culture-activated stellate cells have been noted already (23Racine-Samson L. Rockey D.C. Bissell D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30911-30917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The present results confirm that important differences exist and are especially striking with respect to the CD44 receptor and migration. The expression of CD44v6 by culture-activated stellate cells was very low relative to that of in vivo activated stellate cells; indeed, it resembled that of resting cells. Culture-activated cells have a fully developed myofibroblast phenotype, with stress fibers and focal adhesion to the substratum. Given this and their low expression of CD44v6, they appear to model stellate cells in the second stage of the injury response, which are within fibrous bands and stationary; they are not a model of the acute response to injury. The initial evidence for stellate cell migration in injury was from morphological studies of human liver with alcohol-related damage. Alcohol induces zone 3 (centrilobular) injury, with accumulation of “transitional” (partially activated) and myofibroblastic cells in this zone and depletion of midlobular (zone 2) stellate cells (2Horn T. Junge J. Christoffersen P. J. Hepatol. 1986; 3: 333-340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The current view is that stellate cells migrate toward the injury while becoming progressively activated. When fully activated, they elaborate an injury matrix and occupy it. With maturation, the recently synthesized collagenous fibrils form tracts, to which stellate cells anchor and contract in response to agonists such as endothelin (27Rockey D.C. Housset C.N. Friedman S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1795-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Thus, migration of stellate cells in liver injury appears to be inherent to the formation of dense scar tissue in chronic injury and has a central role in the progression of chronic injury to cirrhosis and functional compromise. Therapeutic blockade of stellate cell migration has not been explored to date but is attractive, based on insights from this and other recent work. Several potential targets exist, both extracellular (e.g. a matrix receptor) or intracellular (e.g. a receptor kinase or signaling moiety). CD44v6 is attractive for the reason that it appears to be up-regulated dramatically and selectively in injury; thus, an inhibitor may have little effect on normal homeostatic function of this receptor. Also, if the liver (or other epithelial tissue) were the sole site of injury, tissue targeting would be unnecessary. The fact that blockade of CD44v6 reduces migration by only 50% can be viewed as a safety factor rather than a limitation. In chronic epithelial injury, repair is highly dynamic, with concomitant fibrogenesis and fibrolysis (1Bissell D.M. Exp. Mol. Med. 2001; 33: 179-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The goal is not to abrogate fibrogenesis completely but rather to tilt the process toward net fibrolysis. Inhibiting migration through blockade of CD44v6 merits study as a treatment strategy.

https://openalex.org/W2069343251,"The functional significance of the presence of two major (types I and II) isoforms of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) is still enigmatic. The present study showed that peptide substrate enhanced the activation of PKA type I at low, physiologically relevant concentrations of cAMP through competitive displacement of the regulatory RI subunit. The effect was similar whether the substrate was a short peptide or the physiological 60-kDa protein tyrosine hydroxylase. In contrast, substrate failed to affect the cAMP-sensitivity of PKA type II. Size exclusion chromatography confirmed that substrate acted to physically enhance the dissociation of the RIα and Cα subunits of PKA type I, but not the RIIα and Cα subunits of PKA type II. Substrate availability can therefore fine-tune the activation of PKA type I by cAMP, but not PKA type II. The cAMP-dissociated RII and C subunits of PKA type II reassociated much faster than the PKA type I subunits in the presence of substrate peptide. This suggests that only PKA type II is able to rapidly reverse its activation after a burst of cAMP when exposed to high substrate concentration. We propose this as a possible reason why PKA type II is preferentially found in complexes with substrates undergoing rapid phosphorylation cycles.

The cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) 1The abbreviations and trivial terms used are: PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; C subunit, catalytic subunit of PKA; RI and RII subunits, regulatory subunits of PKA types I and II, respectively; P-RII, RII subunit autophosphorylated by the C subunit of PKA; kemptide, heptapeptide LRRASLG. 1The abbreviations and trivial terms used are: PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; C subunit, catalytic subunit of PKA; RI and RII subunits, regulatory subunits of PKA types I and II, respectively; P-RII, RII subunit autophosphorylated by the C subunit of PKA; kemptide, heptapeptide LRRASLG. is a model for protein kinases because of its universal distribution and its relative simplicity because the catalytic moiety and the auto-inhibitory moiety are on different subunits. The mammalian tetrameric PKA consists of two catalytic (C) subunit monomers and a regulatory (R) subunit dimmer. The binding of two molecules of cAMP to each R subunit favors dissociation of the C and R subunits. The kinase exists in two major isoforms with different R subunits, RI and RII, each with α- and β-subforms. The biological significance of the presence of two major isozymes is still uncertain. It was early noticed that RI predominated in many cells with rapid proliferation, rapid growth in cell size, or malignantly transformed cells (1.Døskeland S.O. Øgreid D. Int. J. Biochem. 1981; 13: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 2.Gharrett A.J. Malkinson A.M. Sheppard J.R. Nature. 1976; 264: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 3.Mani S. Goel S.

Døskeland S.O. Ueland P.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 189: 272-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). More recently it has been shown by homologous recombination that RIα–/–mice die in embryonic life, whereas RIIβ–/–, RIIα–/–, and RIβ–/–mice have less obvious defects, mainly in differentiation of adipose tissue (RIIβ) and neural functions (RIβ) (5.Amieux P.S. McKnight G.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 968: 75-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). An important difference between RI and RII is their relative affinity for anchoring proteins that confine PKA type II, and in some cases PKA type I, to subcellular compartments (see Refs. 6.Michel J.J. Scott J.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 235-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar and 7.Tasken K. Aandahl E.M. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 137-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar for recent reviews). Another striking difference is the ability of PKA type II, but not type I, to become autophosphorylated (8.Erlichman J. Rosenfeld R. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5000-5003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Taylor S.S. Buechler J.A. Yonemoto W. Annu. Rev.

The interface between the R and C subunits of PKA is complex. The RI and RII subunits bind in part to non-overlapping areas of the C subunit (11.Cheng X. Phelps C. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4102-4108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The R subunits contact the substrate binding site of the C subunit as well as areas distant from this site (12.Taylor S.S. Yang J. Wu J. Haste N.M. Radzio-Andzelm E. Anand G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1697: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) and are, through their (pseudo)substrate moiety, believed to displace substrate from the C subunit and thereby inhibit the kinase activity (10.Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 237-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 12.Taylor S.S. Yang J. Wu J. Haste N.M. Radzio-Andzelm E. Anand G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1697: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The substrate could displace the R subunit from the substrate binding cleft of the C subunit and thereby facilitate holoenzyme dissociation. In this way PKA could be activated at lower concentrations of cAMP in the presence of substrate. In the present study we found that PKA type I, but not type II, was sensitized to cAMP by peptide substrate or by macromolecular substrates like tyrosine hydroxylase. This novel observation suggests that the activity of PKA type I is determined not only by the cAMP level but also by the availability of substrate. Substrate inhibited the rate of reassociation of the cAMP-dissociated subunits of PKA type I, but not type II. This suggests that high substrate availability may prolong the duration of the activation of PKA type I after a burst of cAMP. We have shown previously that physiologically relevant concentrations of cAMP-saturated R subunit of PKA types I and II can form inactive holoenzyme (13.Kopperud R. Christensen A.E. Kjærland E. Viste K. Kleivdal H. Døskeland S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13443-13448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Using physical methods to determine R and C subunit interaction we could confirm this and show that substrate facilitated the dissociation of PKA type I, but not type II. We propose therefore that substrate can selectively enhance PKA type I activity through three mechanisms: by facilitating the activation by low cAMP concentration, by prolonging the activation after a burst of cAMP, and by the dissociation of the holoenzyme at saturating cAMP concentration.

The C subunit of PKA type II from bovine heart and recombinant human RI and RII subunits were isolated as described previously (13.Kopperud R. Christensen A.E. Kjærland E. Viste K. Kleivdal H.

Recombinant and native tyrosine hydroxylase (EC 1.14.16.2; tyrosine monooxygenase; l-tyrosine tetrahydropteridine:oxyreductase (3-hydroxylase) was kindly provided by Drs. Haavik, Almås, and Flatmark, University of Bergen, Norway. The kinase substrate glutathione S-transferase-SR-RASVGL-14–3-3γ was provided by Dr. R. Kleppe, Department of Biomedicine, University of Bergen, and was produced recombinantly from a vector obtained from Dr. Aitken, Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Scotland. For mutagenesis of RI (hRIα G325D) the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used. The RI double stranded plasmid and two synthetic oligonucleotide primers with the desired mutations were annealed and extended by means of the Pfu DNA polymerase. After temperature cycling, the parental DNA template was digested using DpnI. The mutated DNA was transformed into Epicurian Coli® XL1-Blue supercompetent cells. The mutation was confirmed by sequencing. RIIα (1 μm) was stoichiometrically phosphorylated by the C subunit (0.2 μm) of PKA for 5 h at 25 °Cin buffer A with 30 μm cAMP and 100 μm ATP. The bulk of Cα was separated from the phosphorylated RIIα by batch incubation with SP-Sepharose in buffer A with 4 m urea and 50 μm cAMP. The remaining trace of Cα was removed by fast protein liquid chromatography size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200, 24 ml total volume) equilibrated with buffer A. To prevent reassociation of R and C subunits, 2.5 ml of buffer A with 4 m urea and 50 μm cAMP was injected before the sample containing P-IIα. The P-RIIα used had 0.002 mol of C subunit/mol of RII monomer. The P-RIIα showed complete conversion to a more slowly migrating form (15.Scott C.W. Mumby M.C. Mol.

Phosphotransferase Assays—The phosphorylation of kemptide was determined essentially as described in Ref. 13.Kopperud R. Christensen A.E. Kjærland E. Viste K. Kleivdal H. Døskeland S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13443-13448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar. The RI and C subunits were preincubated for 30 min in buffer A, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of [γ-32P]ATP (to a final concentration of 0.3 mm), various concentrations of substrate peptide, and cAMP. The phosphorylation of tyrosine 4-monooxygenase or glutathione S-transferase-SR-RASVGL-14–3-3γ was determined as for kemptide except that the reaction was started by the addition of [γ-32P]ATP just after the addition of substrate protein and the reaction was terminated by adding two volumes of stop solution (1.5 mm ATP, 0.08% SDS, and 60 mm EDTA). Samples (40 μl) from this mixture were spotted on 3MM cellulose filters and subjected to extensive washing in 5% trichloroacetic acid before drying and scintillation counting. C Subunit-induced Dissociation of the [3H]cAMP-R Subunit Complex—The RI or RII subunits were saturated with [3H]cAMP (1 μm) by incubation for 40 min at 37 °C. Excess (unbound) [3H]cAMP was removed by gel filtration (Sephadex G50) at 2 °C immediately before the assay. The assay was at 25 °C and was initiated by the addition of C subunit to 2 nm of R subunit with bound [3H]cAMP in buffer A with 0.6 mm ADP or 1.2 mm AMP. Unlabeled cAMP (2 μm) was present to prevent rebinding of the dissociated [3H]cAMP; aliquots were removed after various periods of time to determine bound [3H]cAMP by the ammonium sulfate precipitation method (16.Døskeland S.O. Øgreid D. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) Scintillation Proximity Assay—The association of RI with bound [3H]cAMP to immobilized C subunit was determined in buffer A with 0.3 mm ATP or ADP by scintillation proximity assay as described previously (13.Kopperud R.

Separation of the Free and Holoenzyme-associated C Subunit by Size Exclusion Chromatography—A size exclusion column (Superdex 200, PC 3.2/30; Amersham Biosciences) was equilibrated with various concentrations of R subunit in buffer A containing one or more of the following substances: 0.3 mm ATP, 0.6 mm ADP, 1.2 mm AMP, 0.03 mm cAMP, 0.1 mm kemptide. The sample (50 μl) contained C subunit and bovine hemoglobin as endogenous standard. Fractions (0.1 ml) were collected and analyzed for kinase activity in the presence of 10 μm cAMP and for absorbance at 405 nm (hemoglobin). The fraction of C complexed with R in a particular sample was determined based on the elution position of the kinase activity in that sample compared with the elution position of free C subunit and the holoenzyme form of the kinase. If the kinase activity eluted midway between the holoenzyme and free C subunit, the sample was considered to contain 50% holoenzyme and 50% free C subunit. Peptide Substrate Competitively Inhibited the Formation of Inactive cAMP-saturated PKA Type I Holoenzyme but Failed to Affect PKA Type II Holoenzyme Formation—In line with our previous report (13.Kopperud R. Christensen A.E. Kjærland E. Viste K. Kleivdal H. Døskeland S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13443-13448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), the PKA activity was inhibited at submicromolar concentrations of cAMP-saturated RI or RII subunit. The IC50 for cAMP-saturated RII was 0.8 μm irrespective of the kemptide concentration. On the other hand, several-fold more RI was required to form inactive holoenzyme in the presence of high than low kemptide concentration (Fig. 1, A and B). To know more about the mechanistic background for this striking difference between the isozymes, we studied the kinase activity at various concentrations of kemptide and at constant concentration of cAMP-saturated R subunit. The RII subunit inhibited the kinase activity in a non-competitive manner (not shown), whereas the RI subunit was a competitive inhibitor of kemptide (Ki = 0.19 μm), as shown by a double inverse plot (Fig. 2). The Ki value was also similar when calculated from experiments where the concentration of RIα was 1 or 3.8 μm (not shown).Fig. 2Double reciprocal plot showing that (RIα)2(cAMP)4 inhibits the kinase activity competitively with respect to kemptide. The phosphorylation of kemptide (concentration range 7.5–320 μm) by the Cα subunit of PKA was determined in the absence (○) or presence (▵) of(RIα)2(cAMP)4 under incubation conditions as described in the legend to Fig. 1. The concentration of cAMP was 0.1 mm, and the concentration of RIα monomer was 1.9 μm. The figure shows a plot of the inverse of the specific kinase activity (y-axis) against the inverse of the kemptide concentration. The apparent Ki (0.19 μm) calculated for cAMP-saturated RIα is shown in the inset.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To know whether kemptide could also modulate the holoenzyme formation for RI subunit monosaturated with cAMP, we studied the RI(G325D) mutant. This protein did not bind cAMP to site B but retained high affinity cAMP binding to site A (not shown). It could form inactive holoenzyme at subnanomolar concentration in the presence of excess cAMP (Fig. 1C). The concentration of kemptide required to modulate holoenzyme formation was similar for RI(G325D) and RI wild type (Fig. 1). This suggested a competitive relationship between RI and kemptide whether one or both cAMP binding sites of RI were occupied. The Physical Formation of PKA Type I and Type II Holoenzyme Complex Was Differentially Modulated by Mg/ATP, Mg/ADP, and Substrate Peptide—The experiments described above (Figs. 1 and 2) relied on kinase activity as a marker of holoenzyme formation and therefore had to be conducted under conditions allowing substrate phosphorylation by the C subunit of the kinase. Each catalytic cycle of the kinase is associated with the formation of C subunit-bound Mg/ADP, whose slow dissociation is the rate-limiting step of the phosphorylation cycle (17.Zhou J. Adams J.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15733-15738Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Under phosphorylation conditions the C subunit can therefore exist in complex not only with Mg/ATP or Mg/ATP and kemptide but also with Mg/ADP or Mg/ADP and kemptide or phosphokemptide. One possible explanation for the puzzling difference between PKA types I and II regarding kemptide effect (see above) could be differential affinity of RI and RII subunits for the Mg/ADP-liganded C subunit formed in the presence of kemptide rather than a differential affinity for the kemptide-liganded C subunit itself. To test this possibility we used biophysical methods to determine holoenzyme formation (a) in the presence of Mg/ADP and Mg/ATP in the absence of kemptide, and (b) in the presence of Mg/ADP and absence and presence of kemptide. In this way we could study the effects of Mg/ATP, Mg/ADP, and kemptide without interference from any reaction products formed due to phosphorylation of substrate. The scintillation proximity assay allows the selective determination of isotope close to the immobilized scintillant. We attached biotinylated C subunit of PKA to the scintillant-containing vial wall and titrated its binding of R with bound [3H]cAMP (13.Kopperud R. Christensen A.E. Kjærland E. Viste K. Kleivdal H. Døskeland S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13443-13448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). We found that the apparent Kd of formation of PKA type I holoenzyme (ternary complex of C, RI, and [3H]cAMP) rose from 0.16 μm in the presence of Mg/ATP to 1.3 μm in the presence of Mg/ADP (Fig. 3A). The formation of Mg/ADP bound to the C subunit can therefore be one mechanism by which substrate can destabilize the PKA type I holoenzyme. To know whether kemptide could have a direct destabilizing effect on the RI-C complex, as suggested by the competitive nature of its action (Fig. 2), we studied the formation of PKA holoenzyme in the absence and presence of kemptide. The formation of holoenzyme was determined based on the retention of C subunit injected into a size exclusion chromatography column equilibrated with various concentrations of cAMP-saturated RI subunit. We found that kemptide (100 μm) increased the retention, indicating less holoenzyme formation, whether Mg/ATP (Fig. 3B) or Mg/ADP (Fig. 3C) was present. The effect of kemptide in the presence of Mg/ADP suggests strongly that kemptide can also inhibit holoenzyme formation independently of the conversion of Mg/ATP to Mg/ADP during the phosphorylation cycle. Experiments similar to those shown for type I holoenzyme were next conducted for type II holoenzyme. We found (Fig. 4A) that the Kd for formation of holoenzyme complex between cAMP-saturated RII and the C subunit was only slightly higher in the presence of Mg/ADP (1.5 μm) than in the presence of Mg/ATP (0.8 μm). In the presence of Mg/AMP the Kd of the cAMP-saturated holoenzyme complex was 2.4 μm (Fig. 4A). Kemptide failed to affect the retention of C subunit injected into a column equilibrated with 0.5 μm RII in the presence of Mg/ADP (not shown) or Mg/ATP (Fig. 4B). We conclude that kemptide substrate did not have a direct effect on holoenzyme formation between RII and C subunit, unlike the findings for RI and C subunits. Furthermore, the substrate-dependent formation of Mg/ADP would be far less effective in dissociating PKA type II (Fig. 4A) than type I (Fig. 3A). Substrate Peptide Counteracted the C Subunit-induced Dissociation of the RIα-[3H]cAMP Complex but Not the RIIα-[3H]cAMP Complex—A major difference between PKA type I and type II is that only the latter is capable of undergoing autophosphorylation at a residue (Ser-95 in human RII) in the (pseudo)substrate part of the linker region between the N- and C-terminal domains of the R subunit (8.Erlichman J. Rosenfeld R. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5000-5003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Taylor S.S. Buechler J.A. Yonemoto W. Annu. Rev.

The autophosphorylated form of RII is known to bind less tightly to the C subunit (18.Rangel-Aldao R. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7526-7529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Rangel-Aldao R. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7140-7145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Døskeland S.O. Maronde E. Gjertsen B.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1178: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Kemptide can inhibit the autophosphorylation of RII (21.Gjertsen B.T. Fauske B. Døskeland S.O. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). One can therefore hypothesize that kemptide could facilitate type II kinase dissociation but that this effect is masked by decreased autophosphorylation, leading to little or no effect of substrate on type II kinase dissociation, as observed (Figs. 1, 3, and 4). To know whether the different response to kemptide for the isozymes was due to any effect of kemptide on the degree of autophosphorylation, we conducted experiments (Fig. 5) in which the phosphorylation state of RII was unaltered. The C subunit-induced dissociation of labeled cAMP from its complex with RII was studied in a buffer with Mg/ADP or Mg/AMP instead of Mg/ATP to avoid any possibility of RII phosphorylation. We found no effect of kemptide on the rate of the C subunit-induced dissociation of the complex of RII and [3H]cAMP. This was true for RII incubated with either Mg/ADP (Fig. 5A) or Mg/AMP (Fig. 5B). In contrast, kemptide nearly abolished the C subunit-induced dissociation of [3H]cAMP from its complex with RI incubated with Mg/ADP (Fig. 5D) even at 1 μm C subunit (Fig. 5E). To study phospho-RII, we incubated with Mg/AMP because the C subunit can catalyze dephosphorylation of phospho-RII in the presence of Mg/ADP (22.Rosen O.M. Erlichman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 7788-7794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or in the presence of Mg/ATP and kemptide (21.Gjertsen B.T. Fauske B. Døskeland S.O. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). We found no effect of kemptide on the rate of the C subunit-induced dissociation of the complex of phosphorylated RII and [3H]cAMP (Fig. 5C). This shows that kemptide acted differently on the association of C to RI and RII also under conditions when autophosphorylation of RII or dephosphorylation of phospho-RII could be ruled out. An inhibitor peptide, representing the 20-residue core of the heat-stable inhibitor of PKA (14.Scott J.D. Glaccum M.B. Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1613-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) binds to the substrate peptide binding site as well as to an adjacent hydrophobic area on the C subunit (23.Narayana N. Cox S. Shaltiel S. Taylor S.S. Xuong N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4438-4448Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of residues in this area of the C subunit inhibited the interaction with RII (11.Cheng X. Phelps C. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4102-4108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It was therefore of interest from a mechanistic point of view to know whether the peptide could modulate the interaction of C subunit and the complex of RII and [3H]cAMP. This peptide at 1 μm inhibited the dissociation of [3H]cAMP from RI (Fig. 5D) and RII. Even at 50 nm it was able to counteract the C subunit-induced dissociation of cAMP from RII (Fig. 5A). This showed that the assay was able to pick up effects of peptides competing with RII for binding to the C subunit. Substrate Sensitized PKA Type I, but Not Type II, toward Activation by cAMP—To know whether peptide substrate could sensitize PKA toward cAMP, we studied the cAMP-dependence of PKA types I and II in the presence of various concentrations of kemptide. Whereas 0.074 μm cAMP was sufficient to half-maximally activate PKA type I at near saturating concentration of substrate peptide, 0.21 μm cAMP was required at low peptide concentration (Fig. 6A). Little sensitization by substrate was noted for PKA type II, which was 50% activated at 0.4–0.5 μm cAMP (Fig. 6B). A concern was that kemptide failed to sensitize the type II isozyme because of its small physical size and that a macromolecular substrate would also sensitize PKA type II. To test this possibility we used as substrate a macromolecule where a PKA substrate consensus sequence (SRRASVGL) was incorporated as a linker between the two macromolecules glutathione S-transferase and 14–3-3γ. We also studied the physiological and large substrate tyrosine hydroxylase, which exists as a tetramer of four subunits of 60 kDa (24.Goodwill K.E. Sabatier C. Marks C. Raag R. Fitzpatrick P.F. Stevens R.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Tyrosine hydroxylase is a physiological substrate whose activity is regulated by phosphorylation by PKA (25.Yamauchi T. Fujisawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 503-507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that either of these macromolecule substrates, like kemptide, sensitized PKA type I, but not type II, toward activation by cAMP (Fig. 7). We conclude that physiologically relevant macromolecular PKA substrates also facilitate cAMP activation of PKA type I, but not type II. The biological significance of the existence of two major isozymes (PKA types I and II) of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase with distinct regulatory subunits (RI, RII) is still enigmatic. The amino acid sequence of the RI and RII subunits differs most in the N-terminal region, which interacts with the A kinase-anchoring protein family of scaffolding proteins. It is therefore likely that one teleological purpose of the existence of two isozymes is to obtain differential subcellular localization of the kinase depending on which isozyme is expressed. The present study demonstrates another striking difference. The presence of substrate peptide sensitized PKA type I to the activating effect of cAMP. This was true whether the substrate was a minimal heptapeptide or a macromolecular substrate like tyrosine hydroxylase (Figs. 6 and 7). This means that for PKA type I the degree of activation by a moderate cAMP increase would depend on the concentration of available substrate in the immediate vicinity. We believe that such substrate activation is a new way in which PKA type I can be activated without altering the cAMP level. The substrate histone was already reported in 1973 to induce dissociation and sensitize PKA type II toward cAMP (26.Miyamoto E. Petzold G.L. Kuo J.F. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 179-189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found little sensitizing effect of substrate toward type II kinase in the present study, using a number of substrates. Presumably, the effect of histone can be explained by nonspecific electrostatic interaction with RII not related to its ability to act as substrate (27.Døskeland S.O. Ueland P.M. Biochem. J. 1977; 165: 561-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). PKA type II is anchored close to ion channels that are PKA substrates (28.Westphal R.S. Tavalin S.J. Lin J.W. Alto N.M. Fraser I.D. Langeberg L.K. Sheng M. Scott J.D. Science. 1999; 285: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 29.Fraser I.D. Tavalin S.J. Lester L.B. Langeberg L.K. Westphal A.M. Dean R.A. Marrion N.V. Scott J.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2261-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). For the L-type Ca2+ channels in heart there is a requirement for rapid activation and inactivation during the cardiac contraction cycle (reviewed in Refs. 30.Kamp T.J. Hell J.W. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 1095-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar and 31.Striessnig J. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 1999; 9: 242-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). A functional requirement for rapid kinase inactivation following an abrupt decrease of [cAMP] may also be present for other channels regulated by anchored PKA type II (7.Tasken K. Aandahl E.M. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 137-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). The rate with which PKA is reinactivated after a burst of cAMP depends on the rate of recombination between the C subunit and the cAMP-saturated R subunit. Each phosphorylation cycle generates C(Mg/ADP), which is believed to be more abundant than C(Mg/ATP) under steady state conditions of active substrate phosphorylation, because each catalytic cycle of the kinase is associated with the formation of C subunit-bound Mg/ADP, whose slow dissociation is the rate-limiting step of the phosphorylation cycle (17.Zhou J. Adams J.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15733-15738Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 21.Gjertsen B.T. Fauske B. Døskeland S.O. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 32.Whitehouse S. Feramisco J.R. Casnellie J.E. Krebs E.G. Walsh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3693-3701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that C(Mg/ADP) reassociated ∼15-fold more rapidly with cAMP-saturated RIIα than RIα. In the presence of kemptide the difference was even larger (Fig. 5). It appears therefore that a short-lived burst of cAMP is likely to lead to a prolonged activation (feed-forward reaction) for PKA type I, but not type II. This may provide a functional explanation for why PKA type II is preferred in complexes with substrates undergoing rapid phosphorylation cycles. The cAMP responsiveness of PKA type I in the intact cell is enigmatic. There is a general notion that PKA type I is more responsive than PKA type II to slight increases of cAMP (33.Otten A.D. Parenteau L.A. Døskeland S. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23074-23082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Cederberg A. Gronning L.M. Ahren B. Tasken K. Carlsson P. Enerback S. Cell. 2001; 106: 563-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). The higher cAMP sensitivity of PKA type I than type II in the presence of abundant substrate (Figs. 6 and 7) can explain the preferential activation of PKA type I by slight cAMP stimulation. On the other hand, RIα is known as the “tissue-specific extinguisher” of cAMP-induced gene activation (35.Boshart M. Weih F. Nichols M. Schutz G. Cell. 1991; 66: 849-859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 36.Jones K.W. Shapero M.H. Chevrette M. Fournier R.E. Cell. 1991; 66: 861-872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), implying that it can counteract cAMP-dependent transcription more efficiently than other proteins, including RII. In line with this, less expression of RIα than of RIIα was required to inhibit cAMP-response element-dependent gene transcription in maximally cAMP-challenged HEK-293 cells (13.Kopperud R.

Chem. 2002; 277: 13443-13448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and less cAMP-induced gene expression has been noted in mice expressing increased levels of RIα (37.Croniger C.M. Millward C. Yang J. Kawai Y. Arinze I.J. Liu S. Harada-Shiba M. Chakravarty K. Friedman J.E. Poli V. Hanson R.W. J. Biol.

Rubin C.S. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 1011-1014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We believe that one avenue by which RIα can attenuate gene regulation induced by strong cAMP stimulation is through the formation of PKA type I holoenzyme even at saturating cAMP level (Fig. 1) (13.Kopperud R. Christensen A.E. Kjærland E. Viste K. Kleivdal H. Døskeland S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13443-13448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In this way cAMP-liganded RIα can act as a clamp on the maximal PKA activation and thereby limit the amount of C subunit that translocates to the nucleus and stimulates gene transcription. We found that the cAMP-saturated RIα and Cα interacted with a Ki of 0.19 μm when peptide substrate was absent (Figs. 2 and 3), against an IC50 of above 1 μm (Fig. 1) in the presence of a high concentration of kemptide. The physiological concentration of RI subunit is in the range of 0.1 to 1 μm (see Ref. 13.Kopperud R. Christensen A.E. Kjærland E. Viste K. Kleivdal H. Døskeland S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13443-13448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar for references), suggesting that a significant proportion of the C subunit can be clamped as inactive holoenzyme in cAMP-stimulated cells, particularly at low substrate availability. We believe that substrate facilitation of the dissociation of type I kinase is of relevance in the intact cell because it was observed with RIα subunit concentrations from low nm (Fig. 6) to above 1 μm (Fig. 1), i.e. encompassing the physiological range of RIα concentrations. We noted that the Kd for C- and cAMP-saturated RIα decreased ∼10-fold (Fig. 3), against only 2-fold for C and cAMP-saturated RIIα (Fig. 4) when Mg/ADP replaced Mg/ATP. This means that RI can discriminate better than RII not only between C subunit with bound kemptide (Figs. 1 and 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) but also between C(Mg/ADP) and C(Mg/ATP). This lends further support to the notion (12.Taylor S.S. Yang J. Wu J. Haste N.M. Radzio-Andzelm E. Anand G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1697: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) that RI and RII differ not only in their N-terminal anchoring domains but also in the C-terminal domains responsible for interacting with the C subunit. This observation can also help explain at least partly the difference between our previous study (13.Kopperud R. Christensen A.E. Kjærland E. Viste K. Kleivdal H. Døskeland S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13443-13448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and Vigil et al. (43.Vigil D. Blumenthal D.K. Brown S. Taylor S.S. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5629-5636Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). They reported that PKA type I (1.5 μm with respect to RIα) was nearly completely dissociated in the presence of cAMP, 0.2 mm Mg/ATP, and 1 mm kemptide, whereas the type II isozyme was less dissociated by kemptide. With a catalytic turnover number of ∼25 s-1 (Ref. 17.Zhou J. Adams J.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15733-15738Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar and Fig. 6), the C subunit at concentration of 1.5 μm will generate up to 30 μm ADP from ATP/second of incubation. It is therefore more instructive to compare the data of Vigil et al. with those obtained by us in the presence of Mg/ADP, where we noted a marked inhibition by 0.3 mm kemptide of the rate of C subunit-induced dissociation of cAMP from its complex with RI (Fig. 5, D and E). We noted also that kemptide led to increased physical dissociation of the type I holoenzyme in the presence of Mg/ADP (Fig. 3). In conclusion, we have presented evidence that substrate can enhance the dissociation of PKA type I at low, physiologically relevant concentrations of cAMP. Substrate availability can therefore fine-tune the activation of PKA type I by cAMP in the intact cell. In contrast, substrate failed to affect the interaction of the subunits of type II kinase. This may explain why type I kinase has been reported to be more sensitive than type II kinase to low concentrations of cAMP in live cells (33.Otten A.D. Parenteau L.A. Døskeland S. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23074-23082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Cederberg A. Gronning L.M. Ahren B. Tasken K. Carlsson P. Enerback S. Cell. 2001; 106: 563-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). We also found other distinct differences between the isozymes, particularly that the cAMP-saturated RII subunit reassociated much more rapidly than the RI subunit with C(Mg/ADP) in the presence of substrate peptide. In the intact cell this would make PKA type II more suitable for a rapidly reversible activation after a burst of cAMP. This may provide a functional explanation for why PKA type II is preferred in compartmentalized complexes with substrates undergoing rapid phosphorylation cycles.

The mechanism of retrotranslocation is poorly understood but may involve the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathway. The AAA ATPase p97 (also called valosin-containing protein) participates in the retro-translocation of cellular endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation substrates and is therefore a candidate to participate in the retrotranslocation of protein toxins. To investigate whether p97 functions in toxin delivery to the cytoplasm, we measured the sensitivity to toxins of cells expressing either wild-type p97 or a dominant ATPase-defective p97 mutant under control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter. The rate at which cholera toxin and related toxins entered the cytoplasm was reduced in cells expressing the ATPase-defective p97, suggesting that the toxins might interact with p97. To detect interaction, the cholera toxin A chain was immunoprecipitated from cholera toxin-treated Vero cells, and co-immunoprecipitation of p97 was assessed by immunoblotting. The immunoprecipitates contained both cholera toxin A chain and p97, evidence that the two proteins are in a complex. Altogether, these results provide functional and structural evidence that p97 participates in the transport of cholera toxin to the cytoplasm.

Altogether, these results provide functional and structural evidence that p97 participates in the transport of cholera toxin to the cytoplasm. Protein toxins of the AB type contain two components, an A subunit that has a deleterious enzymatic activity and one or more copies of a B subunit that binds to a cell surface receptor. The substrates for the enzymatic A subunit are within the cytoplasm; therefore, at least the A chain must be transported across a membrane barrier to access substrates. This transport process involves endocytosis and membrane traffic by the target cell. Some toxins, such as diphtheria toxin (DT) 1The abbreviations used are: DT, diphtheria toxin; CT, cholera toxin; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ERAD, endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation; NSF, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor; ETA, P. aeruginosa exotoxin A; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate. 1The abbreviations used are: DT, diphtheria toxin; CT, cholera toxin; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ERAD, endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation; NSF, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor; ETA, P. aeruginosa exotoxin A; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate.

Trends Microbiol. 2002; 10: 58-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), enter the cytoplasm by penetrating the endosomal membrane soon after endocytosis. However, other toxins, including cholera toxin (CT) (3Lencer W.I. Tsai B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 639-645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), ricin (4Sandvig K. Van Deurs B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 467-475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), are endocytosed and traffic to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by retrograde transport before passing into the cytoplasm. CT contains five B subunits that bind the ganglioside receptor GM1, whereas the A chain ADP-ribosylates a regulatory G protein and activates adenylate cyclase, which elevates intracellular cAMP (6Spangler B.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 622-647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ricin is a plant toxin that binds glycoconjugates containing galactose so that either glycoproteins or glycolipids displaying galactose can serve as receptors (7Sandvig K. van Deurs B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5943-5950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The A chain of ricin arrests protein synthesis by inactivating 28 S ribosomal RNA (8Endo Y. Mitsui K. Motizuki M. Tsurugi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5908-5912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Endo Y. Tsurugi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8128-8130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ETA binds the α2 macroglobulin receptor/low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein and arrests protein synthesis by ADP-ribosylating elongation factor 2 in the cytoplasm, the same reaction catalyzed by the A chain of DT (10Kounnas M.Z. Morris R.E. Thompson M.R. FitzGerald D.J. Saelinger C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12420-12423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).After receptor-mediated endocytosis, CT and related toxins enter retrograde trafficking pathways that transport them to the trans-Golgi network and then to the ER. The number of retrograde pathways available to toxins, and the molecular details of their operation, are not well understood (3Lencer W.I. Tsai B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 639-645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 11Sannerud R. Saraste J. Goud B. Curr. Opin.

Once delivered to the lumen of the ER, there is indirect evidence that the catalytic chains of ricin (13Wesche J. Rapak A. Olsnes S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34443-34449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), ETA (14Koopmann J.O. Albring J. Huter E. Bulbuc N. Spee P. Neefjes J. Hammerling G.J. Momburg F.

Cell. 2001; 104: 937-948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) retro-translocate from the lumen of the ER into the cytoplasm through the Sec61 pore. These studies suggest that the toxins may use the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) system to leave the ER (17Lord J.M. Roberts L.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 18Lord J.M. Deeks E. Marsden C.J. Moore K. Pateman C. Smith D.C. Spooner R.A. Watson P. Roberts L.M. Biochem. Soc.

The ERAD system retro-translocates misfolded ER luminal and membrane proteins into the cytosol for degradation by the 26 S proteasome (20Jarosch E. Lenk U. Sommer T. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2003; 223: 39-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). If toxins use the ERAD pathway to leave the ER, they must somehow subvert the degradation capacity of the system to remain intact in the cytosol. Toxin A chains appear to avoid degradation by having evolved fewer sites for ubiquitination (19Hazes B. Read R.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11051-11054Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 21Deeks E.D. Cook J.P. Day P.J. Smith D.C. Roberts L.M. Lord J.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3405-3413Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and by folding up quickly upon entering the cytoplasm, making them resistant to the proteasome (22Rodighiero C. Tsai B. Rapoport T.A. Lencer W.I. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 1222-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).Ubiquitination is a modification of many proteins that leave the ER via the ERAD system, and several proteins implicated in this process are known in mammalian cells. One of them is p97 (also called valosin-containing protein), the mammalian homologue of the Cdc48 ATPase that is related to N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor protein (NSF) (23Jarosch E. Geiss-Friedlander R. Meusser B. Walter J. Sommer T. Traffic. 2002; 3: 530-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 24Jarosch E. Taxis C. Volkwein C. Bordallo J. Finley D. Wolf D.H. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). There is some uncertainty about whether p97 functions in homotypic fusion in the Golgi apparatus of mammalian cells as well as in the ERAD pathway, but there is no doubt that it is required for ERAD of many proteins (25Dalal S. Rosser M.F. Cyr D.M. Hanson P.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 26Brunger A.T. DeLaBarre B. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 126-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). During ERAD, p97 associates with other proteins, including Ufd1, Npl4, and Derlin-1 (27Ye Y. Meyer H.H. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2001; 414: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar, 28Ye Y. Meyer H.H. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 29Ye Y. Shibata Y. Yun C. Ron D. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2004; 429: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar, 30Lilley B.N. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 2004; 429: 834-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). An important question with respect to toxin retro-translocation is whether ubiquitination is essential for p97 to interact with substrates because toxins have evolved to avoid ubiquitination (and attendant proteasome degradation). In fact, adding ubiquitination sites to ricin A chain enhances proteasomal degradation (21Deeks E.D. Cook J.P. Day P.J. Smith D.C. Roberts L.M. Lord J.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3405-3413Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and the CT A chain with all ubiquitination sites removed still reaches the cytoplasm (22Rodighiero C. Tsai B. Rapoport T.A. Lencer W.I. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 1222-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Recent work suggests, however, that ubiquitination is not essential for p97 to bind translocating substrates (28Ye Y. Meyer H.H. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 31Elkabetz Y. Shapira I. Rabinovich E. Bar-Nun S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3980-3989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that p97 is involved with toxin translocation, even though the toxins are poor substrates for ubiquitination.In this paper, we measured the effects of toxins in a cell line containing an inducible dominant-inhibitory mutant of p97 (25Dalal S. Rosser M.F. Cyr D.M. Hanson P.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and found that the rate at which toxins entered the cytoplasm was reduced, suggesting that p97 might interact with the toxins. To test for interaction, the CT A chain was immunoprecipitated from Vero cells, and both CT A and p97 were in the immunoprecipitates. These data provide functional and structural evidence that p97 and the CT A chain are together in a complex that participates in toxin delivery to the cytoplasm.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Ricin, FITC-labeled ricin, bovine serum albumin, and rhodamine-labeled secondary antibodies were from Sigma. Alexa Fluor 647 secondary antibody was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). CT was from EMD Biosciences (La Jolla, CA). ETA and diphtheria toxin were from List Biological Laboratories (Campbell, CA). Anti-GM130 was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Primary antibodies to Rab6 and Myc were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal anti-p97 was from RDI Research Diagnostics (Flanders, NJ). Polyclonal anti-CT B chain was from Fitzgerald (Concord, MA). Antibodies to the CT A chain were made by injecting the purified A chain into rabbits with Fruend's adjuvant under standard conditions. An IgG fraction of high titer serum was prepared by ammonium sulfate precipitation. Trans 35S label was from ICN Radiochemical (Irvine, CA).Cells and Cell Culture—U2OS TRex cells stably expressing a tetracycline repressor (Invitrogen) and U2OS cells containing the NSF and p97 variants have been previously described (25Dalal S. Rosser M.F. Cyr D.M. Hanson P.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The cells were maintained with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA) containing 10% tetracycline-free fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 50 μg/ml hygromycin B, and 65 μg/ml zeocin (Invitrogen). The cells were exposed to 1 μg/ml tetracyline for 12 h to induce p97 and for 6 h to induce NSF. 80–90% of the cells expressed the exogenous, tagged proteins as determined by immunofluorescence microscopy. Vero cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and were cultured under standard conditions, as described previously (32Chen A. AbuJarour R. Draper R.K. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3503-3510Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).Protein Synthesis Assay—Protein synthesis was measured by the incorporation of radioactivity from Trans 35S label into acid-insoluble protein essentially as described previously (33Hu T. Kao C-Y. Hudson R.T. Chen A. Draper R.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 921-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Control and induced cells were pretreated with respective toxins at different concentrations for 3 h. Trans 35S label (1 μCi/ml) was added for the last hour, and the cells were washed and lysed, and the lysate was spotted within squares defined by gridlines drawn on filter paper. The filter paper was incubated in 5% trichloroacetic acid containing 0.5 mg/ml methionine for 30 min at room temperature, washed twice for 5 min in 100% ethanol, and dried. Radioactivity within each square of the grid was measured with a PhosphorImager using volume quantitation (Amersham Biosciences).Cholera Toxin Assay—Control and induced cells were grown in 24-well culture plates and incubated for 3 h with different concentrations of cholera toxin. The cells were lysed, and intracellular cAMP levels were directly measured with an enzyme immunoassay system according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences).Kinetics of Intoxication—The rate of intoxication by ricin, ETA, and DT was measured by assessing the incorporation of radioactivity from Tran 35S label into acid-insoluble protein as described previously (34Bau M-Y. Draper R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19939-19942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications. The cells were seeded at 5 × 104 cells/well in 48-well culture dishes 1 day before an experiment. After induction with tetracycline, control and induced cells were incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (lacking methionine and cysteine) in the presence of 25 μg/ml ricin or ETA for corresponding time points as indicated by the figure legends, followed by a 10-min incubation with Tran 35S label (10 μCi/ml). The cells were washed and lysed, and radioactivity was measured as described in the previous section on protein synthesis assays. To determine the rate of intoxication by CT, control and induced cells were incubated with 25 μg/ml CT for indicated times, followed by cell lysis and measurement of intracellular cAMP levels as described in the preceding section.Immunofluorescence Microscopy—To study the uptake and intracellular trafficking of ricin, control and induced cells were incubated with FITC-labeled ricin (5 μg/ml) for 30 min on ice to bind the toxin to the cell surface. Toxin internalization was initiated by warming the cells to 37 °C for 5min. The cells were then chilled on ice and washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus galactose (100 μm) and once with phosphate-buffered saline to remove ricin that was not internalized. The cells were chased for different periods of time as indicated in the figure legends, washed, and fixed by incubation with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min on ice (to prevent further transport of the toxin) and 10 min at room temperature. After permeabilization with 0.2% saponin for 10 min, the cells were stained with antibodies to Rab6 and Myc and viewed using a Leica TCS SP2 AOBS confocal microscope and a 63× lens (Leica Microsystems, Bannockburn, IL). Quantitative analysis of FITC-ricin accumulation in Golgi cisternae was performed using Leica software and by defining the region of interest as the pericentriolar region that is positive to Rab6. The ratio of FITC-ricin staining to Rab6 staining in the Rab6-positive region was then recorded.Transfection and Immunoprecipitation—Vero cells were transiently transfected for 12 h with plasmids (25Dalal S. Rosser M.F. Cyr D.M. Hanson P.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) encoding either wild-type p97 or p97-E578Q using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the protocol provided by the vendor. Transfection efficiency was between 60 and 70% as confirmed by immunofluorescence.For immunoprecipitation, the cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml CT for 4 h at 37°C, washed thoroughly with phosphate-buffered saline, and solubilized in IP buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 30 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, EDTA-free protease inhibitors, pH 7.4). Anti-CT A chain was incubated with the precleared cell extracts for 1 h at 4°C, and protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) were added, and the mixture was incubated for additional 2 h at 4°C. The beads were washed thoroughly and removed by centrifugation, and proteins in the supernatant and bead pellet were electrophoresed in a polyacrylamide gel with sodium dodecyl sulfate, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with antibodies as described in the figure legends.RESULTSExpressing the Dominant p97(E578Q) Mutant Inhibits the Cytotoxicity of CT, ricin, and ETA but Not That of DT—U2OS-p97(E578Q) cells are stably transfected with an ATPase-defective dominant-interfering mutant of p97 under control of the tetracycline promoter (25Dalal S. Rosser M.F. Cyr D.M. Hanson P.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To measure the effect of expressing the dominant mutant on the cytotoxic activity of toxins, the cells were either exposed to tetracycline for 12 h to induce p97(E578Q) or were left untreated. Fig. 1 shows the response of induced and uninduced cells to different concentrations of CT, ricin, ETA, and DT after exposure to the toxins for 3 h. Table I presents a summary of the toxin concentrations required to elicit a 50% effect (IC50 values) corresponding to the dose-response curves of Fig. 1. The IC50 values for cells expressing p97(E578Q) were two to three times higher compared with uninduced cells for CT, ricin, and ETA, but not for DT. The resistance to CT and ricin upon p97(E578Q) induction was not the result of tetracycline alone or nonspecific effects of overexpressing p97 because U2OS cells transfected with wild-type p97 under control of the tetracycline promoter (25Dalal S. Rosser M.F. Cyr D.M. Hanson P.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) showed no resistance to the toxins upon induction with tetracycline (Table II). CT, ricin, and ETA have in common that they enter the lumen of the ER by membrane traffic pathways and then must retro-translocate across the ER membrane to reach the cytoplasm where they encounter their substrates (3Lencer W.I. Tsai B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 639-645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 4Sandvig K. Van Deurs B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 467-475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, DT penetrates an endosomal membrane to reach the cytoplasm and does not require transport to the ER (1Eidels L. Draper R.K. Hardegree M.C. Tu A.T. Handbook of Natural Toxins. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1988: 217-247Google Scholar). Thus, expressing a dominant mutant of p97 inhibits toxins that pass through the ER en route to the cytosol but not a toxin that escapes to the cytosol before reaching the ER.Table IIC50 values for CT, ricin, ETA, and DT in cells expressing p97(E578Q) (from curves shown inFig. 1)ToxinIC50p97(E578Q) offp97(E578Q) onng/mlCT0.30.5Ricin0.20.6ETA3080DT1.51.5 Open table in a new tab Table IIIC50 values for CT, ricin, and DT in cells expressing wild-type p97ToxinIC50p97(wt) offp97(wt) onng/mlCT0.50.5Ricin0.40.4DT0.40.5 Open table in a new tab Expressing p97(E578Q) Increases the Time Required for CT and Related Toxins to Reach the Cytoplasm—The kinetics of intoxication by protein toxins begins with a lag period during which no effects are seen, followed by a first order inactivation of protein synthesis (35Neville D.M. Hudson T.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 195-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The lag period is dose-dependent until a minimum lag is reached that cannot be decreased by increasing the toxin concentration, corresponding to saturation of surface receptors. The minimum lag period represents the time required by cells to transport and process toxins prior to release into the cytoplasm. To see whether the resistance to CT, ricin, and ETA induced by p97(E578Q) correlated with changes in intoxication kinetics, induced and uninduced cells were exposed to high doses of toxin (to ensure saturation of surface receptors), and the responses were measured as a function of time. Two consequences on the kinetics of intoxication were observed (Fig. 2). One was an increase of 25–50% in the minimum lag periods for the toxins (summarized in Table III). This increase suggests that a cellular event occurring during transport of the toxins to the cytoplasm takes longer when the dominant p97 mutant is expressed. Second, the generation of a response was delayed after the minimum lag period was over. Moreover, the response did not appear to be first order, probably because of the heterogeneous level of p97(E578Q) expression in the total cell population. Expressing wild-type p97 in U2OS cells had no effects on the kinetics of intoxication by CT, ricin, or ETA (data not shown). Overall, it is evident that interfering with p97 function slows the rate at which ricin and related toxins enter the cytoplasm.Fig. 2Induction of p97(E578Q) slows down the rate of intoxication by CT, ricin, and ETA. p97(E578Q) cells treated with (ON) or without (OFF) tetracycline were incubated with 25 μg/ml CT, ricin, or ETA for the indicated periods of time at 37 °C. The cells treated with CT (A) for the indicated periods of time were lysed, and the levels of intracellular cAMP were measured. Cells treated with ricin (B) and ETA (C) were pulsed for 10 min with 35S-labeled methionine and cysteine, followed by cell lysis and measurement of total amount of 35S-labeled protein.

The Golgi compartment is an intermediate point in these transport pathways, and the steady state accumulation of a toxin in the Golgi region should reflect changes in upstream or downstream trafficking pathways. For example, a reduction in toxin surface receptors, a decrease in the rate of endocytosis, or impaired delivery of endocytosed toxin to the trans-Golgi network, should reduce the accumulation of a toxin in the Golgi complex. Moreover, if there is less export of a toxin from the Golgi to the ER, the toxin should overaccumulate within Golgi membranes. Therefore, we measured the accumulation of FITC-labeled ricin in the Golgi region of cells by quantitative confocal fluorescence microscopy. To validate the approach, we first studied the accumulation of FITC-ricin in cells under conditions that should inhibit the delivery of endocytosed material to the Golgi, namely in cells that express a dominant ATPase-defective mutant of NSF.U2OS-NSF(E329Q) cells contain a dominant mutant of NSF under control of the tetracycline promoter (25Dalal S. Rosser M.F. Cyr D.M. Hanson P.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Because dissociation of soluble NSF attachment protein receptor complexes mediated by NSF is essential for many membrane fusion events, disrupting NSF function should impair the pathways of membrane traffic that depend on membrane fusion, and it has been shown that inducing the NSF(E329Q) mutant in U2OS cells disorganizes the Golgi apparatus and impairs intra Golgi transport (25Dalal S. Rosser M.F. Cyr D.M. Hanson P.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The cytotoxicity of toxins that require transport into the ER should also be inhibited by expressing NSF(E329Q), and the IC50 values for ricin, ETA, and CT were increased when the NSF mutant was induced (Fig. 3). Further, the rate at which ricin, ETA, and CT intoxicated cells was reduced in kinetic assays when the mutant NSF was expressed (data not shown). Cells expressing the dominant NSF mutant were only slightly resistant to DT (Fig. 3D), suggesting that events necessary for DT action, including receptor-mediated endocytosis and acidification of early endosomes, are not severely disrupted by the dominant NSF mutant.Fig. 3Induction of NSF(E329Q) inhibits cytotoxicity of CT, ricin, ETA, and DT. NSF(E329Q) cells were treated as described in the legend to Fig. 1 in the presence (ON) and absence (OFF) of tetracycline, and the levels of intracellular cAMP were measured in cells incubated with CT (A). Alternatively, the total amount of cellular 35S-labeled protein was measured for cells incubated with ricin (B), ETA (C), and DT (D). The error bars represent the standard deviations of triplicates (B and D) or duplicates (A and C) of an experiment representative of three to five independent experiments).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether the resistance to ricin caused by expressing NSF(E329Q) correlated with reduced uptake of FITC-labeled ricin into the Golgi apparatus, induced and uninduced cells were pulsed with FITC-labeled ricin for 5 min and chased for 0, 10, or 30 min prior to staining with antibodies to Rab6 (a trans-Golgi network marker) and to Myc (to identify Myc-tagged NSF(E329Q)). Images of cells at the 10-min chase time are shown in Fig. 4. In uninduced control cells, there was no staining for Myc, indicating a very low level of NSF(E329Q)-Myc expression without induction, and FITC-ricin co-localized with the Golgi marker Rab6 (Fig. 4, top panels). When NSF(E329Q) was induced, strong staining for NSF(E329Q)-Myc was observed, and there was little detectable FITC-ricin in Rab6-positive Golgi cisternae (Fig. 4, bottom panels). To quantify the absence of FITC-ricin in Rab6-positive structures, the ratio of FITC to tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate in Rab6-positive regions was compared in uninduced and induced cells at different chase times. FITC-ricin co-localized with Rab6 first increased and then declined in uninduced cells, whereas very little FITC-ricin was within Rab6-positive structures"
https://openalex.org/W2021141283,"The pyridoxal 5′-phosphate-dependent tryptophan synthase α2β2 complex is a paradigmatic protein for substrate channeling and allosteric regulation. The enzymatic activity is modulated by a ligand-mediated equilibrium between open (inactive) and closed (active) conformations of the α- and β-subunit, predominantly involving the mobile α loop 6 and the β-COMM domain that contains β helix 6. The α ligand-triggered intersubunit communication seems to rely on a single hydrogen bond formed between the carbonyl oxygen of βSer-178 of β helix 6 and the NH group of αGly-181 of α loop 6. We investigated whether and to what extent mutations of αGly-181 and βSer-178 affect allosteric regulation by the replacement of βSer-178 with Pro or Ala and of αGly-181 with either Pro to remove the amidic proton that forms the hydrogen bond or Ala, Val, and Phe to analyze the dependence on steric hindrance of the open-closed conformational transition. The α and β activity assays and the equilibrium distribution of β-subunit catalytic intermediates indicate that mutations do not significantly influence the intersubunit catalytic activation but completely abolish ligand-induced α-to β-subunit signaling, demonstrating distinct pathways for α-β-site communication. Limited proteolysis experiments indicate that the removal of the interaction between βSer-178 and αGly-181 strongly favors the more trypsin-accessible open conformation of the α-active site. When the hydrogen bond cannot be formed, the α-subunit is unable to attain the closed conformation, and consequently, the allosteric signal is aborted at the subunit interface.

Regulation of enzyme activity by interaction with metabolites is a key feature for the maintenance of cell life. This goal is achieved through conformational changes that, depending on protein complexity, involve tertiary and/or quaternary states. A common event that accompanies ligand binding to proteins is the transition between open and closed states (Ref. 1.Gutteridge A. Thornton J. FEBS Lett. 2004; 567: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar and the references therein). Usually, the closed state is a more active conformation, bringing substrates and catalytic residues in close proximity, conferring special features to the active site environment, and protecting the productive catalysis from side reactions, generally involving water molecules.

The enzyme catalyzes the biosynthesis of l-tryptophan in two steps: the α-subunit cleaves indole-3-glycerol phosphate to d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and indole, which, intramolecularly channeled to the β-subunit (10.Hyde C.C.

During catalysis, a series of chromophoric intermediates are formed, including an external aldimine, an α-aminoacrylate and quinonoid species (Scheme 1). The catalytic activity of α- and β-subunits is kept in phase by a fine-tuning associated with intersubunit communication (3.Dunn M.F. Aguilar V. Brzovic P. Drewe Jr., W.F. Houben K.F. Leja C.A.

Specifically, the comparison of the three-dimensional structure of TS in the absence (both α- and β-subunits in the open state) and presence of a ligand in the α-active site and the catalytic intermediate α-aminoacrylate in the β-active site (both α- and β-subunits in the closed state) (5.Schneider T.R.

Davies D.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7664-7680Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) evidenced several structural differences: (i) the formation of hydrogen bonds between α loop 2 and β helix 6, (ii) the stabilization of α loop 6, which is crystallographically undetectable in the open form due to high mobility (5.Schneider T.R. Gerhardt E. Lee M. Liang P.H. Anderson K.S. Schlichting I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5394-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 10.Hyde C.C. Ahmed S.A. Padlan E.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. J.

This mobile portion of the β-subunit was called the COMM domain because of its role in communicating to the β-active site conformational changes occurring at the α-active site. The relevance of the α loop 6-β helix 6 hydrogen bond between the carbonyl oxygen of βSer-178 and the amide NH of αGly-181 for allosteric signaling was tested by introducing the βS178P mutation (7.Marabotti A. De Biase D. Tramonti A. Bettati S. Mozzarelli A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17747-17753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Indeed, the enzyme was still active but allosterically “knocked out.” A structural study showed several alterations of the α-β interface and the inability of the α-subunit to achieve the closed state even in the presence of α-subunit ligands (17.Weyand M. Schlichting I. Herde P. Marabotti A. Mozzarelli A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10653-10660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Because all mutants of βSer-178 are potentially able to form a hydrogen bond with αGly-181, we prepared the βS178A mutant to verify whether the disruption of the βSer-178-αGly-181 hydrogen bond was due to proline geometric features. Furthermore, by taking into account that αGly-181, but not βSer-178, is a conserved residue among TS from several species (7.Marabotti A. De Biase D. Tramonti A. Bettati S. Mozzarelli A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17747-17753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 32.Xie, G., Forst, C., Bonner, C., and Jensen, R. A. (2002) Genome Biology http://genomebiology.com/2001/3/1/RESEARCH/0004Google Scholar), we have investigated the geometric requirements for the achievement of the βSer-178-αGly-181 hydrogen bond by preparing αG181A, αG181V, and αG181F, mutants characterized by a progressively increasing side chain steric hindrance, and αG181P. Activity assays, distribution of catalytic intermediates, and limited proteolysis kinetics in the absence and presence of substrates and ligands concordantly indicate that the βSer-178-αGly-181 hydrogen bond is critical for both allosteric communication and stabilization of the closed state of the α-subunit, but not for intersubunit activation. Reagents—All chemicals (Sigma-Aldrich) were of the best available quality and used without further purification. d,l-α-Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate was prepared from the monobarium salt of the diethylacetal form. Restriction enzymes were purchased from Amersham Biosciences and New England Biolabs. TS Expression and Purification—The bacterial strain Escherichia coli CB149 carrying plasmid pEBA10 with the gene for the TS complex from Salmonella typhimurium was kindly provided by Dr. Edith W. Miles (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The mutant and wild type enzymes were purified as described previously (33.Yang L. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 8: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and stored at –80 °C. Preparation of TS Mutants—The βS178P mutant was prepared by site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (7.Marabotti A. De Biase D. Tramonti A. Bettati S. Mozzarelli A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17747-17753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). All other mutants were prepared from the wild type construct pEBA10 using the Quik-Change™ Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit from Stratagene. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by MWG-Biotech (Florence, Italy). Mutations were introduced using the following primers: αG181P, 5′-CCTGCTTTCGAGATCTCCTGTCACCGGCGCGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCGCGCCGGTGACAGG AGATCTCGAAAGCAGG-3′ (antisense); αG181A, 5′-CCTACCTGCTTTCGAGATCTGCTGTCACCGGCGCGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCGCGCCGGTGACAGC AGATCTCGAAAGCAGGTAGG-3′ (antisense); αG181F, 5′-CCTACCTGCTTTCGAGATCTTTTGTCACCGGCGCGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCGCGCCGGTGACAAA AGATCTCGAAAGCAGGTAGG-3′ (antisense); αG181V, 5′-CCTACCTGCTTTCGAGATCTGTTGTCACCGGCGCGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCGCGCCGGTGACAAC- AGATCTCGAAAGCAGGTAGG-3′ (antisense); and βS178A, 5′-GGCGCTGCGCGACTGGGCC GGATCCTACGAAACCGCGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCGCGGTTTCGTAGGATCCGGCCCAGTCGCGCAGCGCC-3′ (antisense). Primers contained both the desired mutation (new triplets are in bold) and the silent mutation introducing a new restriction site (underlined) for BglII (αGly-181 mutants) and BamHI (βS178A) in the gene. Sequences were verified by restriction digestion and sequencing. Reverse α Activity Assay—The reverse α activity was measured spectrophotometrically with a Cary219 spectrophotometer (Varian) in a solution containing TS, 2 mm indole, 2 mm glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, 100 mm bis-Tris-propane, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.8, at 37 °C, using 1-mm path length quartz cuvettes (17.Weyand M. Schlichting I. Herde P. Marabotti A. Mozzarelli A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10653-10660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). β Replacement Activity Assay—The β activity assay was carried out as described previously (34.Higgins W. Fairwell T. Miles E.W. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 4827-4835Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), using a 1-cm-path length quartz cuvette at 37 °C. When present in the assay solution, the concentration of d,l-α-glycerol-3-phosphate (GP) was 50 mm. β Elimination Activity Assay—The serine deaminase reaction was measured by monitoring pyruvate formation with a coupled lactate dehydrogenase assay at 22 °C (35.Crawford I.P. Ito J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1964; 51: 390-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 36.Kumagai H. Miles E.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 44: 1271-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The absorbance decrease at 340 nm was recorded using 1-cm-path length cuvettes. The reaction mixture contained 50 mm bicine (sodium N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine), 100 mm l-serine, 500 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm NADH, pH 7.8, and 80 units of lactate dehydrogenase from bovine heart. When present in the assay solution, the concentration of GP was 80 mm. Spectrophotometric Measurements—Absorption spectra were collected using a Cary400 spectrophotometer (Varian) for a solution containing 50 mm bicine, 500 mm NaCl, and 100 mm l-serine, pH 7.8, in the absence and presence of 80 mm GP at 22 °C. Limited Proteolysis—Solutions containing TS (1.22 mg/ml), 50 mm bicine, and 1 mm EDTA, at pH 7.8, were treated with 1 μg/ml TPCK-trypsin in the presence and absence of 80 mm GP and 100 mm l-serine at 22 °C (37.Ruvinov S.B. Miles E.W. FEBS Lett. 1992; 299: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Digestions were stopped by boiling solutions for 3 min in the presence of SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Proteolysis products were resolved by SDS-PAGE, visualized by Coomassie Blue staining, and quantified by densitometric analysis carried out on digitalized images with Quantity One 4.2.0 Software (Bio-Rad). Reverse α and β Replacement and β Elimination Activities— The rate of the reverse α reaction between indole and glyceradehyde-3-phosphate was found to be almost 2–3-fold slower for the α mutants and βS178P with respect to the wild type enzyme (Table I). Not surprisingly, the βS178A mutant exhibited only a 20% decrease. These findings suggest that mutations might prevent the formation of the closed, active conformation of the α subunit. The β replacement activity for each mutant was measured in the absence and presence of GP (Table I). All mutants are as active as the wild type, with the exception of βS178P and αG181P, which show slightly reduced β activity. GP exhibits a significant inhibitory effect on βS178A and a much smaller one on βS178P, whereas no inhibition is observed for all other mutants. These data indicate that the ligand-mediated intersubunit communication has been interrupted, suggesting that mutations do not allow the formation of the hydrogen bond between positions β178 and α181. In addition, these data confirm that intersubunit activation exploits a different pathway. In fact, αG181A, αG181F, and αG181V mutants exhibit unaltered catalytic activity despite the completely abolished ligand-induced allosteric regulation. The 1.4- and 2-fold decrease in the β activity observed for αG181P and βS178P, respectively, might be ascribed to slightly altered intersubunit contacts due to different conformations imposed by this mutation to α loop 6 and/or β helix 6. This decrease in activity is very modest when compared with the 30- and 100-fold reduction observed for the isolated α- and β-subunits, respectively (12.Miles E.W. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1979; 49: 127-186PubMed Google Scholar).Table IReverse α, β replacement and β elimination activity of wild type and mutant TS in the absence and presence of the α ligand GPReverse α activityβ Replacement activityβ Elimination activity-GP+GP-GP+GPunits/mgunits/mgunits/mgWild type1651 ± 62 (100)1204 ± 24 (100)378 ± 14 (31)6.31 ± 0.01 (100)1.47 ± 0.12 (23)βS178A1359 ± 80 (82)1282 ± 23 (106)712 ± 33 (55)5.02 ± 0.11 (79)1.32 ± 0.06 (26)βS178P510 ± 05 (31)609 ± 08 (51)522 ± 03 (86)2.31 ± 0.01 (37)1.64 ± 0.15 (71)αG181A599 ± 64 (36)1174 ± 35 (97)1156 ± 30 (98)5.35 ± 0.11 (85)5.24 ± 0.23 (98)αG181F610 ± 55 (37)1216 ± 02 (101)1158 ± 17 (95)6.08 ± 0.26 (96)6.17 ± 0.12 (101)αG181P780 ± 82 (47)825 ± 17 (69)815 ± 37 (99)7.12 ± 0.01 (113)7.12 ± 0.01 (100)αG181V636 ± 130 (38)1234 ± 38 (102)1171 ± 51 (95)7.78 ± 0.01 (123)7.78 ± 0.01 (100) Open table in a new tab In addition to the specific β replacement reaction, tryptophan synthase catalyzes a β elimination side reaction, in which l-serine deamination yields pyruvic acid and ammonia (12.Miles E.W. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1979; 49: 127-186PubMed Google Scholar). The deaminase activity of wild type TS and mutants in the absence and presence of GP (Table I) indicates that the mutation causes a decrease of activity only for βS178P. Furthermore, addition of GP significantly reduces the deaminase activity of the wild type and βS178A mutant, whereas it has no effect on α181 mutants. For βS178P, a 30% reduction in the specific activity was observed in the presence of the allosteric effector. Equilibrium Distribution between External Aldimine and α-Aminoacrylate in the Absence and Presence of GP—The UVvisible spectra of the internal aldimine for wild type TS and mutants (Fig. 2) show, for some mutants, the presence of a band at 325 nm, which is likely to be attributed to a derivative of the coenzyme with active site residues. This band also appears with aging in pyridoxal 5′-phosphate-dependent enzymes (38.Pioselli B. Bettati S. Demidkina T.V. Zakomirdina L.N. Phillips R.S. Mozzarelli A. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). When l-serine reacts with TS, an equilibrium between the catalytic intermediates α-aminoacrylate and external aldimine is attained, with the former being favored by α-subunit ligands, cesium ions, low pH, and high temperature (39.Peracchi A. Bettati S. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Miles E.W. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1872-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 40.Peracchi A. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9459-9465Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 41.Fan Y.X. McPhie P. Miles E.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4692-4703Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These species absorb at 350 and 422 nm, respectively. The spectra of the equilibrium distribution of intermediates formed in the reaction of l-serine with the wild type and mutant enzymes, in the absence and presence of GP, are reported in Fig. 2. In the absence of GP, spectra obtained for the wild type and mutants are similar, except for αG181P and βS178P. In the former, the mutation favors the accumulation of the external aldimine, whereas in the latter, the mutation stabilizes the aminoacrylate species. Furthermore, differences in the relative absorption intensities for the bands at 422, 350, and 325 nm also arise from distinct amounts of the 325 nm species. Addition of GP to the βS178A mutant shifts the equilibrium toward the aminoacrylate species, whereas in βS178P and α181 mutants, the distribution is unaffected by GP binding. The same pattern of effects was obtained by monitoring the change in the amount of the external aldimine as a function of GP recording the fluorescence emission at 500 nm upon excitation at 420 nm (data not shown). Effect of α- and β-Subunit Ligands on the Rate of Limited Proteolysis for Wild Type TS and Mutants—In order to detect changes in the open to closed transition of α loop 6 upon mutation, the rate of tryptic cleavage of the α-subunit in the α2β2 complex of wild type and mutant TS was measured in the absence and presence of α- and β-subunit ligands. The time course of proteolysis was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3A) and quantified by densitometric analysis (Fig. 3B). Proteolysis of the wild type and βS178A mutant in the absence of ligands results in rapid and almost complete cleavage of the α-subunit at a single site, αArg-188, to produce α-1 and α-2 fragments (34.Higgins W. Fairwell T. Miles E.W. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 4827-4835Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 42.Miles E.W. Higgins W. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6266-6269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43.Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10715-10718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of GP to the α-subunit dramatically decreases the rate of proteolysis, as observed previously (43.Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10715-10718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of l-serine in combination with GP almost totally protects the α-subunit, whereas l-serine alone has no effect (37.Ruvinov S.B. Miles E.W. FEBS Lett. 1992; 299: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 43.Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10715-10718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the contrary, αG181A and αG181P mutants are less susceptible to proteolysis in the absence of ligands with respect to the wild type. However, a more rapid and extensive degradation occurs when α and β ligands are bound. The proteolysis site in αG181F and αG181V mutants remains highly accessible in both the absence and presence of bound substrates. The α-subunit proteolysis rate of the βS178P mutant in the absence of l-serine and GP is slower than that of the wild type and is substantially unchanged in the presence of GP alone, whereas the addition of both ligands slightly reduces it. For all α mutants, the addition of l-serine alone makes αArg-188 more susceptible to cleavage, suggesting that binding of the β ligand may stabilize a more flexible and mobile conformation of α loop 6. The characterization of mutants at the α181 and β178 position of S. typhimurium TS allows detailed analysis of the mechanism of intersubunit communication. In the proposed mechanism of allosteric regulation between α- and β-subunits (5.Schneider T.R. Gerhardt E. Lee M. Liang P.H. Anderson K.S. Schlichting I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5394-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 7.Marabotti A. De Biase D. Tramonti A. Bettati S. Mozzarelli A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17747-17753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), α ligands interact with the α loop 6 residue αGly-184, reducing the flexibility of the loop and favoring the formation of the hydrogen bond between αGly-181 and βSer-178. In turn, this hydrogen bond further reduces α loop 6 mobility, stabilizing the closed conformation of the α-subunit. The relocation of α loop 6 causes a shift in the β helix 6 of the COMM domain (5.Schneider T.R. Gerhardt E. Lee M. Liang P.H. Anderson K.S. Schlichting I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5394-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The movement of α loop 6 is also propagated to αAsp-60 via the hydrogen bond with αThr-183 (5.Schneider T.R. Gerhardt E. Lee M. Liang P.H. Anderson K.S. Schlichting I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5394-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 15.Rhee S. Parris K.D. Hyde C.C. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7664-7680Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). This displacement orients αAsp-60 for the efficient catalytic cleavage of indole-3-glycerol phosphate and concomitantly allows the formation of new interactions between α loop 2 and the COMM domain (5.Schneider T.R. Gerhardt E. Lee M. Liang P.H. Anderson K.S. Schlichting I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5394-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The present data support the hypothesis that the intersubunit hydrogen bond between the αGly-181 amide proton and the βSer-178 carbonyl oxygen atom is fundamental for the α-β communication and that the loss of this contact is sufficient to abolish intersubunit allosteric regulation. In fact, when the interaction cannot be formed due to either lack of the donor amide proton (αG181P) or steric hindrance (αG181A, αG181V, and αG181F), the α ligands lose the ability to modulate β activity and the equilibrium distribution of catalytic intermediates at the β-active site. The proteolysis experiments demonstrate that all the allosterically silent mutants fail to attain the closed conformation of α loop 6 even in the presence of α and β ligands. These findings agree with the previously determined crystallographic structures of the βS178P (17.Weyand M. Schlichting I. Herde P. Marabotti A. Mozzarelli A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10653-10660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and αT183V mutants (30.Kulik V. Weyand M. Seidel R. Niks D. Arac D. Dunn M.F. Schlichting I. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 677-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), which established that the lack of α loop 6 closure is the basis for the missing intersubunit signaling. When the equilibrium between closed and open conformations of the α-active site is shifted in favor of the open state (5.Schneider T.R. Gerhardt E. Lee M. Liang P.H. Anderson K.S. Schlichting I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5394-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 44.Weyand M. Schlichting I. Marabotti A. Mozzarelli A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10647-10652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), the α activity is low, αGly-181 cannot be correctly positioned for hydrogen bonding with βSer-178, the hydrogen bond cannot be formed, and the signal of α-active site occupancy cannot be transduced to the β-subunit. The loss of influence of α-subunit ligands on the β-subunit was previously reported for other mutants of α loop 6 (αT183A, αT183V, and αR179L) (21.Yang X.J. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7520-7528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Kulik V. Weyand M. Seidel R. Niks D. Arac D. Dunn M.F. Schlichting I. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 677-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 45.Brzovic P.S. Hyde C.C. Miles E.W. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10404-10413Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The mutated residues are involved in the ordering and maintenance of the correct position of α loop 6. Thus, these amino acid substitutions disrupt the stabilizing hydrogen bond network fundamental for loop relocation and formation of the αGly-181-βSer-178 interaction. When no ligands are present, α loop 6 in the wild type and βS178A mutant is flexible and mobile, and αArg-188 is highly susceptible to proteolysis. Binding of GP to the wild type α-active site alters the conformation and flexibility of the loop and reduces the accessibility of the site of proteolysis. The closure of the loop caused by binding of GP can be further stabilized by an l-serine-induced conformational change in the β-subunit. This highlights that communication between α loop 6 and the β-active site is reciprocal. Our data indicate that the βS178A mutant retains ligand-induced communication between the α- and the β-site. On the contrary, Phe and Val mutations at position α181 prevent α loop 6 from attaining the closed conformation in the presence of bound ligands. In αG181A and αG181P, α loop 6 in the absence of ligands likely adopts a different conformation, characterized by an impeded interaction with trypsin. Upon binding of either GP alone or GP and l-serine, the α loop 6 of these mutants is not in the closed state, and its conformation seems to resemble the open state. Furthermore, the results confirm that no conformational changes in the α loop 6 of βS178P occur after α ligand binding, as evidenced by the crystal structure of the βS178P mutant, in which α loop 6 has no definite electron density in the absence and presence of α ligands (17.Weyand M. Schlichting I. Herde P. Marabotti A. Mozzarelli A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10653-10660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In addition, these experiments suggest that, similarly to the αG181P and αG181A mutants, the conformation of α loop 6 in βS178P is endowed with different flexibility with respect to the open state. It is important to notice that all mutants, which had lost ligand-induced allosteric regulation, were almost as active as wild type TS in the β reaction, with the unique exception of S178P and αG181P. In these mutants, the substitution with proline is likely to distort the α loop 6 and β helix 6 conformation and modify contacts at the interface, as shown crystallographically for the former (17.Weyand M. Schlichting I. Herde P. Marabotti A. Mozzarelli A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10653-10660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In contrast, replacement of residues in α loop 2 or residues contacting α loop 2 was reported to critically reduce β activity without perturbing ligand-induced communication (24.Rhee S. Miles E.W. Mozzarelli A. Davies D.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10653-10659Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 27.Rowlett R. Yang L.H. Ahmed S.A. McPhie P. Jhee K.H. Miles E.W.

Chem. 1992; 267: 5222-5228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, α loop 2 was proposed to be predominantly involved in the intersubunit interaction that leads to a reciprocal modulation of the activity of the α- and β-subunits within the tetramer (7.Marabotti A. De Biase D. Tramonti A. Bettati S. Mozzarelli A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17747-17753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These findings collectively indicate that different pathways for intersubunit signal transmission do exist, which specifically involve α loop 2 and α loop 6. This conclusion is also supported by the recently determined structure of the TS α-subunit from E. coli (31.Nishio K. Morimoto Y. Ishzuka M. Ogasahara K. Tsukihara T. Yutani K. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 1184-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignment of TS α and β chains from different sources reveals that βSer-178 is not conserved among the analyzed species (7.Marabotti A. De Biase D. Tramonti A. Bettati S. Mozzarelli A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17747-17753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), indicating that the side chain of l-serine is not relevant for allosteric communication and that, at this position, amino acids with different steric hindrance can be accommodated without perturbing the subunit interface. On the contrary, αGly-181 is invariant (32.Xie, G., Forst, C., Bonner, C., and Jensen, R. A. (2002) Genome Biology http://genomebiology.com/2001/3/1/RESEARCH/0004Google Scholar). The invariance of αGly-181 suggests that although the interaction is formed between backbone atoms, precise steric constraints exist due to the limited space to accommodate the α181 side chain in the closed form of α loop 6. We verified that serine to alanine substitution at position β178, which is not likely to alter the position of the carbonyl oxygen, does not perturb hydrogen bond formation and does not interrupt signal transmission. On the contrary, the results on α181 mutants show that glycine at position α181 is necessary for the maintenance of signal transmission, suggesting that only this residue allows α loop 6 closure and the correct positioning of the αG181 amide proton for formation of the hydrogen bond. The geometric restrictions imposed at position α181 were simulated by “in silico” mutagenesis. From inspection of these virtual structures, it appears that the closed conformation of α loop 6 is incompatible with the presence of side chains bulkier than a hydrogen atom. A detailed molecular dynamics modeling of the mobility of α loop 6 in the wild type and α181 mutants in the absence and presence of α-subunit ligands is currently under way and will be reported elsewhere. 2F.

In the structure of the Cyt b6f complex, the Cyt f subunit is anchored in the thylakoid membrane through a single membrane-spanning α-helix near the C terminus. The redox-active 28-kDa N-terminal domain of this subunit (Cyt f) protrudes into the lumen and can be isolated in a soluble form detached from the membrane-anchoring helix (11Soriano G.M. Smith J.L.

Berry E.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7689-7701Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) have been determined and revealed that the overall fold of the domain is largely coincident with the same domain in the full Cyt b6f complex. Cyt f is an elongated molecule composed of two domains (Fig. 1A, left panel). The larger domain has an immunoglobulin-like fold composed by a three-layer structure made of β-strands flanked by small α-helices. The small domain is also composed of β-strands folded into a small “jelly roll.” The heme group nestles between two short helices near the N terminus of Cyt f and is covalently bound to the protein by thioether bonds through strictly conserved cysteine residues in the fingerprint peptide Cys-X-Y-Cys-His sequence found in all of the c-type cytochromes. The heme Fe(III)/(II) is axially bound by a proximal His25 Nϵ and by the α-amino group of the N-terminal residue Tyr1 (Fig. 1A, right panel). The Cyt f redox partner plastocyanins are small (∼10 kDa) soluble proteins belonging to a larger class of metalloproteins, named blue copper proteins, containing copper in their active site (15Freeman H.C. Guss J.M. Messerschmidt A. Huber R. Wieghardt K. Poulos T. Handbook of Metalloproteins. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2001: 1153-1169Google Scholar). Several structures of plastocyanins from different biological sources, derived using both solid-state x-ray crystallography and solution NMR spectroscopy, indicate that these proteins consist of a highly conserved antiparallel β-barrel structure (Fig. 1B, top panel). The Cu(II)/(I) ion is found in a so-called type I center bound to one Cys Sγ and two His Nδ residues in a distorted trigonal planar structure with a weakly bound axial Met Sδ (Fig. 1B, bottom panel). The complex formed between spinach Pc and turnip Cyt f is characterized by a high dissociation rate (16Kannt A. Young S. Bendall D.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1277: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), suggesting that the interaction is short-lived, thus preventing a structural study using x-ray crystallography. Several different computational approaches to elucidate the structure of the bimolecular complex formed between spinach or poplar Pc and turnip Cyt f have been employed. Manual docking was first attempted using information derived by mapping the electrostatic field on the proteins surface (17Pearson Jr., D.C. Gross E.L. David E.S. Biophys.

The structures calculated using these pure computational methods suggest the existence of several different orientations used by the two proteins to approach each other. The use of experimental constraints derived from NMR in combination with restrained rigid body molecular mechanics yielded a family of highly similar structures of the transient complex between spinach Pc and turnip Cyt f (22Ubbink M.

These structures reveal that van der Waals interactions between the heme region of Cyt f and the hydrophobic patch of Pc bring the two metal ions, iron and copper, within ∼11 Å of each other. Additionally, the interaction within this complex is proposed between basic and acidic patches on Cyt f and Pc surface, respectively. This conclusion is supported by site-directed mutagenesis studies on residues within either of these two electrostatically complementary regions, resulting in a decrease of the electron transfer rate (16Kannt A.

Although the overall molecular structure is very similar for various plastocyanins, the surface properties are not conserved among all of the members of this class of proteins with the surface electrostatic potential features differing between plant and prokaryotic members of this family. Higher plant plastocyanins are characterized by rather similar surface features confirmed by the conserved net charge at pH 7 (–9 ± 1) (28Sykes A.G. Structure Bond. (Berlin). 1991; 75: 177-244Google Scholar), whereas cyanobacterial plastocyanins have a widely varying net charges. As a result, one of the functionally relevant plant plastocyanins patches, the so-called acidic or eastern patch, is barely observed in the case of the bacterial proteins. These differences in surface charge properties have a profound influence on the kinetics of the interaction between Cyt f and Pc (29Schlarb-Ridley B.G. Bendall D.S. Howe C.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3279-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 30Hart S.E. Schlarb-Ridley B.G. Delon C. Bendall D.S. Howe C.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4829-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The structures of the transient homologous complexes formed by Cyt f and Pc from the cyanobacteria Phormidium laminosum (31Crowley P.B. Otting G. Schlarb-Ridley B.G. Canters G.W. Ubbink M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 10444-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and Prochlorothrix hollandica (32Crowley P.B. Vintonenko N. Bullerjahn G.S. Ubbink M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15698-15705Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) were determined by the same combination of NMR and computational methodology used in the case of the heterologous complexes of higher plants proteins. The complexes are less well defined with respect to the higher plant counterpart because of either the increased mobility within the cyanobacterial complex or the lower number of restraints used in calculations. In the case of these cyanobacterial protein complexes, none of the lowest energy structures was similar to the higher plant analogues, possibly because of different surface characteristics of bacterial and plants redox partners. This suggestion is confirmed by the absence of electrostatic charges involved in the cyanobacterial complex, which instead appears to entail mainly hydrophobic interactions. However, the role of electrostatic interactions in the P. laminosum Pc-Cyt f complex involving the same basic/acidic patches observed in the heterologous complex formed in the case of higher plants has been established by kinetic measurements on site-directed Pc and Cyt f mutants (31Crowley P.B.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15698-15705Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the charged patches are important for the formation of the encounter complex, which involves transient conformations that are invisible by NMR. These electrostatic interactions were suggested to increase the number of productive collisions to form the reaction complex in a diffusion-limited mechanism. The missing piece of this puzzle is represented by the lack of information on the structure of a homologous complex between Pc and Cyt f from higher plants. One of the reasons why it is important to study homologous complexes is the possibility of establishing well defined shape and charge complementarity between interacting proteins. In this work, we present a modeled structure of the intermolecular complex between Cyt f and Pc, both from spinach. The structure of the reduced Pc was determined using high field NMR spectroscopy, whereas the structure of oxidized Cyt f was obtained by homology modeling calculations and molecular dynamics. The structure of the intermolecular Cyt f-Pc complex was derived using a docking genetic algorithm that takes into account biological information obtained from mutagenesis experiments. Finally, the most relevant structure-based electron transfer pathways from the heme group of Cyt f to the copper ion of Pc were calculated based on a model that analyzes the process of electron tunneling between the redox partners in terms of the contributions of covalent bonds and H-bonds and through-space contributions (33Beratan D.N. Onuchic J.N. Winkler J.R. Gray H.B. Science. 1992; 258: 1740-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 34Betts J.N. Beratan D.N. Onuchic J.N. J. Am. Chem.

In the absence of any direct structural characterization of the Pc-Cyt f complex, the information provided by our study is valuable as a structural model for the interpretation of experimental data for this system. Plastocyanin Sample Preparation—Plastocyanin extraction from 1.5 kg of spinach leaves was carried out by homogenizing the leaves, previously rinsed with distilled water, in 3 liters of 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7, containing 50% acetone (v/v) using a Waring blender and keeping the homogenate at 4 °C for 30 min. The undissolved material was removed by centrifugation (5000 × g). Protein precipitation was carried out by slowly adding cold (–20 °C) acetone (up to 75%) to the clear supernatant. The pellet obtained after centrifugation was redissolved in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7. The subsequent purification procedure was adapted from a previously published method (36Kato S. Shiratori I. Takamiya A. J. Biochem. 1962; 51: 32-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 37Morand L.Z. Krogmann D.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1141: 105-106Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) modified by adding a final hydrophobic interaction chromatographic step on a Toyopearl HW-65C column. Pc was eluted using a linear gradient (60–20%) of ammonium sulfate and finally dialyzed. The purity and concentration of the protein were monitored using a CARY-3 UV-visible spectrophotometer. The absorbance ratio A278/A597 for the purified oxidized Pc was 1.15. The protein concentration was determined using a value of 4.9 mm–1 cm–1 for the extinction coefficient of oxidized Pc at 597 nm (36Kato S. Shiratori I. Takamiya A. J. Biochem. 1962; 51: 32-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Samples for NMR spectroscopy (1–2 mm) were prepared in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (either in 90% H2O, 10% D2O or in 100% D2O) at pH 7.5. Complete reduction of the protein was obtained by the addition of a slight excess of a freshly prepared sodium ascorbate solution. During the NMR experiments, the sample was kept under argon. NMR Spectroscopy Data Acquisition and Processing—NMR experiments were performed on Bruker Avance spectrometers operating at 500- and 800-MHz proton Larmor frequencies. Data acquisition and processing were performed using a standard Bruker software package (XWINNMR). Two-dimensional 1H homonuclear TOCSY (38Braunschweiler L. Ernst R.R. J. Magn.

J. Magn. Reson. Ser. A. 1993; 102: 241-245Crossref Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). The spin-lock time in TOCSY experiments was varied between 30 and 70 ms, whereas the mixing time used in NOESY was 100 ms. The repetition time in two-dimensional spectra ranged between 1.2 and 1.7 s. Two-dimensional 1H homonuclear TOCSY and NOESY spectra consisted of 4096 K data points in the F2 dimension, whereas 800–1024 experiments were recorded in the F1 dimension with 32–128 transients/experiment. Raw data were processed using a sine-squared window function shifted by either π /2 or π /3 in both dimensions. A polynomial base-line correction was applied in both directions. Data were always zero-filled in the F1 dimension to obtain matrices with 2 × 2-K data points. The spectra were calibrated assigning a chemical shift of 4.81 ppm to the water signal with respect to 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentanesulfonic acid at 291 K. Peak Assignment and Structural Constraints—The program XEASY (47Bartels C. Xia T. Billeter M. Guntert P. Wuthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1601) Google Scholar) was employed for spectral analysis and for NOESY cross-peak integration. The sequence-specific resonance assignment was carried out using standard procedures. The volumes of assigned NOESY cross-peaks were transformed into 1H-1H upper distance limits using the program CALIBA (48Guntert P. Braun W. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 517-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). Standard calibration was performed using backbone, side-chain, and methyl classes using a (1/r)6 distance dependence. Dihedral ϕ and ψ angle constraints were obtained from the relative intensities of the intraresidue and interresidue Hα-NH NOESY cross-peaks. All of the dihedral angles constraints (47 ϕ and 47 ψ angles) were divided into two classes. For 3JHα-NH constants larger than 8 Hz, the ϕ dihedral angle was restrained between –145 and –75° and the ψ angle was restrained between –70 and 0° (region B of the Ramachandran plot), whereas for coupling constants smaller than 4.5 Hz, the ϕ angles were restrained between –105 and –35° and the ψ angles were restrained between 100 and 180° (region A of the Ramachandran plot). Additional 20 constraints were introduced by considering the presence of H-bonds involving peptide amide NH groups and carbonyl oxygen atoms. Such constraints were considered only in cases where the amide 1H resonance was observed to be non-exchanging in 90% D2O solutions after 10 min and if the H-bond involving this proton was observed in >50% of the structures calculated using DYANA (49Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2553) Google Scholar) (see below) without inclusion of these constraints. For these cases, the upper and lower distance limits used for the H–O distance were 1.8 and 2.4 Å, respectively. Moreover, the N–O distances were constrained between 2.4 and 3.4 Å. The copper atom was included in the structure calculations as a residue bound to the C terminus of the protein by 33 linker dummy residues using the procedure implemented in DYANA (49Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2553) Google Scholar). These dummy residues are used to let the copper atom move freely during the DYANA run. The number of these residues in the linker is chosen to be large enough to allow the copper atom to get close to any residue in the protein according to the experimental constraints relative to the copper ion. Bond distance restraints were imposed to the copper coordination using lower and upper distance limits, large enough to allow the metal-bound residues to adopt a conformation in solution that would be consistent with the rest of NMR data. In particular, the restraints of 2.0 ± 0.3 and 2.2 ± 0.3, corresponding to normal coordination bonds, were used for Cu-N(His) and Cu-S(Cys), respectively, on account of the large contact interaction experienced by these ligands. The Cu-S(Met) distance was freely allowed to vary within a larger range (from 2.4 to 3.2 Å) to account for the much smaller contact contribution experienced by this residue. No copper-ligand angle restraints were used at this stage of the calculation. NMR Structure Calculation—Structures were calculated by simulated annealing torsion angle dynamics carried out using DYANA. The calculations started from 400 randomly produced conformers, each of them subjected to 8000 torsion angle dynamics steps in order to adapt its conformation to the distance constraints. The stereospecific assignments (37 in total) were obtained using GLOMSA. Few cycles of (i) structure calculation and (ii) re-calibration using CALIBA allowed the obtainment of an ensemble of structures satisfying the experimental constraints. The best 30 structures having a target function smaller than 0.84 Å2 were selected as a single family to assess the structure quality and for further analysis. NMR Structure Refinement—The mean structure from the DYANA family was calculated using MOLMOL and subjected to restrained energy minimization using the SANDER module of the AMBER 6.0 program package. The force-field parameters for all of the residues excluding those for the copper-coordinated ligands were the standard AMBER “all-atoms” parameters. The calculations were performed in vacuo with the distance-dependent dielectric constant option. The non-bonded interactions were evaluated with a cutoff of 10 Å. The mixed linear-harmonic flat-bottomed potential implemented in SANDER was applied to all of the structural constraints. This potential involves a null force constant for structural constraints within the allowed limits, a non-zero harmonic force constant in a small interval outside the allowed limits, and a linearly dependent potential beyond that limit. Nuclear Overhauser effect-derived distance constraints were restricted below the upper distance limit (ri) using a force constant of 32 kcal mol–1 Å–2 for the interval ri + 0.5 Å. Distance constraints involving the same H-bonds used for DYANA calculations were included in the restrained energy minimization calculation, restricting the NH–O and N–O distances to the same upper (ri) values used in DYANA with a force constant of 32 kcal mol–1 Å–2 for the range of ri + 0.5 Å. The Cu-N(His) and Cu-S(Cys) distances were constrained at 2.1 ± 0.1 and 2.2 ± 0.1, respectively, using a linear-harmonic flat-bottomed potential with force constants of 50 kcal mol–1 Å–2 in the 0.3-Å distance ranges below and above these limits. The Cu-S(Met) distance was analogously constrained within the 2.75 ± 0.05-Å range using a force constant of 40 kcal mol–1 Å–2. The Cu-N(His)-C, Cu-N(His)-C, Cu-S(Cys)-C, Cu-S(Met)-C, and Cu-S(Met)-C angles were restrained around 127 ± 10, 127 ± 10, 105 ± 5, 130 ± 10, and 110 ± 10, respectively, using a linear-harmonic flat-bottomed potential with force constants of 50 kcal mol–1 deg–2 in the 50 ranges below and above the given values. Analogously, the (His)N-Cu-N(His), (His)N-Cu-S(Cys), (His)N-Cu-S(Met), and (Met)S-Cu-S(Cys) angles were restrained in the 110 ± 10, 125 ± 10, 95 ± 10, and 100 ± 10 range with a force constant of 20 kcal mol–1 deg–2 in the 50 angle ranges below and above these limits. The mean minimized structure of reduced spinach Pc was subsequently subjected to molecular dynamics calculation in a box of 72 × 70 × 67 Å filled with TIP3P water molecules (50Jorgensen W.L. Chandrasekhar J. Madura J.D. Impey R.W. Klein M.L. J. Chem. Phys. 1983; 79: 926-935Crossref Scopus (29885) Google Scholar). The water molecules were equilibrated for 100 ps at the temperature of 300 K using the SANDER module of AMBER 6 program (51Case D.A. Pearlman D.A. Caldwell J.W. Cheatham III, T.E. Ross W.S.

https://openalex.org/W2090963866,"Id2 plays a key role in epithelial cells, regulating differentiation, the cell cycle, and proliferation. Because human skin constantly renews itself and is the first target of irradiation, it is of primary interest to evaluate whether such a gene may be regulated in keratinocytes exposed to ionizing radiation. We show here that <i>Id2</i> is induced in response to γ-irradiation and have investigated the consequence of this regulation on cell fate. Using RNA interference, we observed that Id2 extinction significantly reduces cell growth in human keratinocytes through the control of the G<sub>1</sub>-S transition of the cell cycle. We have investigated whether the impact of Id2 on the cell cycle may have a physiological role on the cell's ability to cope with radiative stress. Indeed, when Id2 is down-regulated through interfering RNA, cells are more sensitive to irradiation. Conversely, when Id2 is overexpressed, this somehow protects the cell. We propose that Id2 favors reentering the cell cycle after radiation-induced cell cycle arrest to permit the recovery of keratinocytes exposed to ionizing radiation."
https://openalex.org/W1981015792,"We used a proteomic approach to identify proteins that associate with keratins 8 or 18 (K8/K18) in a pervanadate-dependent manner. Pervanadate triggers Ran-K8/K18 binding and a gel-migration-shift of Ran from 25 to 27 kDa, which does not occur upon exposure to H2O2 or vanadate or if pervanadate is excluded during cell solubilization. Generation of 27-kDa Ran is not related to hyperphosphorylation, is heat-insensitive, but occurs upon conversion of Ran cysteines to cysteic acid. The pervanadate-mediated Ran cysteine → cysteic acid oxidation and its related gel migration shift affects other proteins including actin. Mutation of the three Ran cysteines (Cys-85, -112, and -120) showed that Ran Cys-112 oxidation generates 27-kDa Ran and accounts for its keratin binding. Proteasome inhibition accentuates Ran-keratin binding after cell exposure to pervanadate. Therefore, cell-free exposure to pervanadate causes cysteine to cysteic acid oxidation of Ran and several other proteins and Ran-K8/K18 association. In cells, stabilization of oxidized Ran by proteasome inhibition promotes Ran-keratin interaction.

The use of Ser/Thr phosphatase inhibitors such as okadaic acid (OA) has been valuable in helping identify K8/K18 interaction with 14-3-3 proteins and Raf-1 kinase (8.Ku N.O. Michie S.

Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, whether cell exposure to PV and consequent modulation of tyrosine phosphorylation could regulate keratin interaction with an associated protein is unknown.Protein tyrosine phosphorylation is pivotal for regulating a variety of fundamental cellular processes (10.Ullrich A.

The established PTP inhibitors vanadate and PV (vanadate mixed with H2O2 generate PV) are commonly used to study a broad range of biologic processes. PV is significantly more effective than vanadate in increasing cellular tyrosine phosphorylation (12.Zick Y. Sagi-Eisenberg R.

Although the precise details of the inhibitory effect of PV on phosphatases are not completely understood, PTP oxidation is a likely key mechanism as demonstrated for the irreversible inhibition of PTP1B by PV via oxidation of its catalytic cysteine residue (17.Huyer G.

For example, ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1) is modified to cysteic acid in the brains of patients with Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases, suggesting a link between oxidative damage of neuronal proteins and the pathogenesis of Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases (21.Choi J.

Taira T. Ariga H. Niki E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 317: 722-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Interestingly, DJ-1 Cys-106 plays an important neuroprotective role in the response to oxidative stress (25.Canet-Aviles R.M. Wilson M.A. Miller D.W. Ahmad R. McLendon C. Bandyopadhyay S.

Thus, oxidative injury and consequent cysteine to cysteic acid oxidation may be involved in the pathogenesis of several human disorders.Ran is an abundant and highly conserved GTPase of the Ras superfamily and is essential for viability in every tested organism (26.Sazer S. Dasso M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1111-1118PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Hetzer M. Gruss O.J. Mattaj I.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E177-E184Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). It shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm, plays an important role in nucleocytoplasm transport (28.Weis K. Cell. 2003; 112: 441-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar), and is implicated in several nuclear functions including transport, cell cycle control, and post-mitotic nuclear assembly (29.Künzler M. Hurt E. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3233-3241PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Quimby B.B. Dasso M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that tyrosine phosphorylation may regulate keratin interaction with hitherto uncharacterized binding proteins and utilized PV treatment of cells as a handle to study such potential interactions. We show that PV induces K8/K18-Ran binding, which is associated with the slower migration of Ran on SDS-PAGE. These findings are not caused by tyrosine hyperphosphorylation but by oxidation of an exposed Ran cysteine residue. Our results suggest that the cytoprotective effects of keratins can be related, in part, to sequestration of damaged oxidized proteins during conditions when the proteasome system is overwhelmed or inhibited.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and Reagents—Human (h) HT29 (colon), Huh-7 (liver), and AsPC1 (pancreas) cells and human Ran cDNA were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. PV was prepared by mixing 1 m vanadate and 30% hydrogen peroxide (5:1, v/v). After 5 min (22 °C), the generated PV was added to cell cultures (1 mm final) or to solubilization buffers (0.1 mm). The antibodies (Abs) used included those directed to: h-Ran amino acids 7–171 (BD Transduction Laboratories) or 207–216 (Sigma); actin and h-K18 (NeoMarkers); and the GTP-binding protein β subunit (Gβ) (Calbiochem). Other reagents included recombinant (r)-Ran (Calbiochem), pET protein expression system (Novagen), and QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). 32P-labeled γ-ATP/GTP and α-GTP were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.Immunoprecipitation, Gel, and Protein Analysis—HT29 cells were treated with PV (1 mm, 90 min), OA (1 μg/ml, 2 h), anisomycin (An, 10 μg/ml, 20 h), or carrier (0.1% Me2SO for 20 h; used as solvent for OA/An). Cells were solubilized (2 h, 4 °C) with 1% Nonidet P-40 in buffer A (5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm pepstatin, 10 μm leupeptin, and 25 μg/ml aprotinin in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4). Where indicated, 0.1 mm PV or 0.5 μg/ml OA were included during solubilization of PV- and OA-treated cells, respectively. After pelleting, the supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation (3 h, 4 °C) using anti-Ran Ab or anti-K8/K18 Ab conjugated to protein A-Sepharose beads. Precipitates were used for blotting or in vitro reconstitution binding assays. Total cell lysates were prepared by directly adding hot Laemmli sample buffer (90 °C, 5 min) to prewashed cells. Protein samples were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE (39.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205998) Google Scholar) and then transferred to membranes for blotting.Mass Spectrometry and Amino Acid Composition—Keratin-associated proteins were purified from PV-treated HT29 cells by K8/K18 co-immunoprecipitation. As a specificity control, precipitates were also prepared using protein A-Sepharose beads alone. After gel separation, trypsin was used for in-gel-digestion followed by peptide extraction and then identification of co-precipitated proteins by mass spectrometry-based methods (peptide mass mapping and de novo sequencing whenever necessary). For amino acid composition, acid hydrolysis of proteins was carried out in constantly boiling HCl followed by analysis with a Beckman System 6300 High Performance Analyzer.Radiolabeling and Biochemical Methods—Aliquots (100 μl) of soluble Nonidet P-40 fractions of HT29 cells were mixed with 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, [γ-32P]GTP, or [α-32P]GTP and then incubated +/–PV (0.1 mm, 60 min, 4 °C). Labeling was quenched by adding sample buffer (5 min, 95 °C) followed by SDS-PAGE, transfer to a membrane, autoradiography, and then anti-Ran blotting. Ran was purified by immunoprecipitation from HT29 cells that were cultured and solubilized (+PV) and then incubated with ±5 units of alkaline phosphatase (60 min, 37 °C). Inhibition of proteasomal degradation was done by culturing cells (8 h) with lactacystin (20 μm) or N-acetyl-l-leucinyl-l-leucinyl-lnorleucinal (100 μm) or 0.1% Me2SO (as vehicle control). PV (1 mm) was added to cell culture media and incubated further for 1.5 h. Cells were washed and then solubilized with 1% Nonidet P-40 in buffer A (–PV, 2 h, 4 °C) followed by precipitation of K8/K18.Expression of Ran Mutants and Reconstitution Experiments—h-Ran cDNA was amplified from a pCMV-SPORT6-Ran vector followed by subcloning into pET23a (+) and then generation of four Ran mutants (C85F, C112F, C120A, and triple C85F,C112F,C120A mutant), which were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Ran was extracted from the bacteria using lysozyme and freeze-thawing. For the in vitro reconstitution assays, equal amounts of washed Sepharose-Ab-K8/K18 beads (30 μl) were mixed with 300 μl of bacterially expressed wild type (WT) or mutant Ran in buffer B containing 0.1 mm PV (4 °C, 16 h). The beads were washed, and bound proteins was eluted from the beads with Laemmli sample buffer and then analyzed by blotting.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONIdentification of Ran as a Novel Keratin-associated Protein—To identify K8/K18-binding proteins that may be regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation, K8/K18 immunoprecipitates were obtained from HT29 cells that were treated and solubilized in the presence or absence of PV. One major protein that specifically associated with K8/K18 precipitates isolated from PV-treated cells was identified by mass spectrometry as the GTP-binding protein Ran (not shown). This was confirmed by immunoblot analysis of K8/K18 precipitates obtained from cells treated with PV, OA, An, or Me2SO (Fig. 1A). The analysis of K8/K18 precipitates obtained from cells treated with OA or An was included as “non-Tyr” phosphorylation controls since such treatments induce Ser/Thr keratin hyperphosphorylation due to Ser/Thr phosphatase inhibition (OA) or induction of apoptosis (An) (4.Omary M.B. Ku N.O. Liao J. Price D. Subcell. Biochem. 1998; 31: 105-140PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, there was a Ran-Ab-reactive 27-kDa (in addition to the normal 25 kDa) species seen only in the presence of PV (Fig. 1, A and B). Generation of the slower migrating 27-kDa Ran species and Ran association with K8/K18 were confirmed using a second anti-Ran Ab that recognizes an independent Ran epitope (not shown). The migration shift of Ran occurred only after treatment with PV but not with vanadate or H2O2 alone (Fig. 1B). Therefore, the altered migration of Ran suggests a post-translational modification in response to PV but not vanadate or H2O2.The PV-induced 27-kDa Ran Is Due to Cysteine Oxidation but Is Not Due to Hyperphosphorylation—We hypothesized that the SDS-PAGE migration shift in Ran may be due to a phosphorylation event since PV is a highly effective PTP inhibitor, and retarded migration of many proteins is frequently related to phosphorylation (14.Zhao Z. Tan Z. Diltz C.D. You M. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22251-22255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 15.Singh S. Darnay B.G. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol.

However, this hypothesis became suspect when formation of the slower migrating 27-kDa Ran species and its association with K8/K18 were noted to be independent of the exposure time of cells to PV (Fig. 1C, left panel). Also, if PV is excluded during solubilization, only the 25-kDa Ran species is seen despite cell exposure to PV prior to their lysis (Fig. 1C, right panel). Formation of 27-kDa Ran was not unique to HT29 cells, as it was noted in two other tested cell lines but only when PV was added during solubilization (Fig. 1D).We then used several approaches to exclude cell-free in vitro phosphorylation or another enzymatic process as the cause of 27-kDa Ran formation. First, 27-kDa Ran is not affected by treatment with alkaline phosphatase (Fig. 2A). Second, incubation of a Nonidet P-40 lysate with various donor phosphates ([γ-32P]ATP/GTP or [α-32P]GTP) in the presence or absence of PV does not generate a labeled Ran-like species although 27-kDa Ran is the primary formed species in the presence of PV (Fig. 2B, lanes 2, 4, and 6), whereas other in vitro phosphorylated proteins are generated (Fig. 2B, arrows). Third, formation of 27-kDa Ran was heat-insensitive (Fig. 2C) and occurs by simply mixing PV with r-Ran (Fig. 2D, compare lanes 5 and 6). Furthermore, association of Ran with K8/K18 can be reconstituted in vitro using r-Ran and K8/K18 immunoprecipitates but only in the presence of PV (Fig. 2D, lanes 1–4). Taken together, these results indicate that an enzymatic modification of Ran is unlikely to account for its binding to K8/K18 or formation of 27-kDa Ran.Fig. 2Formation of 27-kDa Ran and its association with K8/K18 is PV-dependent but phosphorylation-independent.A, Ran immunoprecipitates (ip) were prepared from HT29 cells that were solubilized with Nonidet P-40 (–/+PV; lanes 1 and 2). A duplicate of the immunoprecipitates in lane 2 was incubated with alkaline phosphatase (AP) (lane 3) followed by blotting with anti-Ran Ab. B, Nonidet P-40 fractions of HT29 cells were mixed with [γ-32P]ATP, [γ-32P]GTP, or [α-32P]GTP (+/–PV). Protein lysates were then transferred to a membrane followed by autoradiography and then blotting with anti-Ran Ab. No 32PO4 labeling is found where normal and shifted Ran are predictably located (area inside broken lines). Arrows highlight 32P-labeled proteins whose identities are not known. C, HT29 cell Nonidet P-40 lysates were stored at 4 °C or heated (90 °C) for 5 min. The lysates were then further incubated at 4 °C (+/–PV) followed by blotting with anti-Ran Ab. D, lanes 1–4, K8/K18 or control (C) precipitates bound to Sepharose beads were incubated with r-Ran +/–PV. The beads were then washed and analyzed by blotting using anti-Ran Ab. Lanes 5 and 6, r-Ran was incubated +/–PV followed by blotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The above findings, coupled with the previous report that inhibition of PTP-1B by PV was caused by cysteine oxidation of the phosphatase (17.Huyer G. Liu S. Kelly J. Moffat J. Payette P. Kennedy B. Tsaprailis G. Gresser M.J. Ramachandran C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar), raised the possibility that Ran oxidation is the trigger for its migration shift and association with K8/K18. Support for this possibility was obtained after amino acid analysis of native and PV-treated r-Ran, which showed that all three cysteines of Ran become oxidized to cysteic acid in the presence of PV (Supplemental Table 1).PV Induces Generalized Protein Cysteine Oxidation and SDS-PAGE Migration Shifts—We tested the effect of PV on actin and Gβ. Actin was selected for this analysis because it is an abundant Cys-containing protein. Gβ was examined because it undergoes in vitro phosphorylation by [γ-32P]GTP (32.Wieland T. Nurnberg B. Ulibarri I. Kaldenberg-Stasch S. Schultz G. Jakobs K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18111-18118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the in vitro labeling by [γ-32P]GTP in the absence of PV (Fig. 2B, lane 3) highlighted a major species of 36 kDa (likely corresponding to Gβ) that was almost completely abolished with generation of a faint slower migrating species in the presence of PV (Fig. 2B, lane 4). Cell-free PV treatment of Nonidet P-40 lysates, isolated from HT29 cells, also slowed the SDS-PAGE migration of actin and Gβ (Fig. 3A) but did not affect the migration of two unknown species that cross-reacted with anti-Gβ Ab (Fig. 3A, arrows). Treatment of purified actin with PV followed by amino acid analysis confirmed that all five cysteines of actin become oxidized to cysteic acid (Supplemental Table 2). Thus, PV-induced protein oxidation on cysteine residues appears to be a generalized occurrence that affects several Cys-containing proteins.Fig. 3PV-induced oxidation includes other proteins, and effect of proteasome inhibition onin vivoK8/K18-Ran association.A, Nonidet P-40 fractions of HT29 cells were incubated +/–PV, separated by SDS-PAGE, and then blotted using Abs to actin, Gβ and Ran. Arrows indicate two unidentified proteins that do not change their SDS-PAGE migration after PV treatment. B, HT29 cells were treated with or without PV and then solubilized with 1% Nonidet P-40 (–/+ PV, respectively) followed by immunoprecipitation of K8/K18. The keratin precipitates (ip) were then immunoblotted using anti-Gβ Ab. Open arrowheads highlight migration-shifted Gβ that likely represents PV-generated oxidized Gβ. C, HT29 cells were preincubated (8 h, 37 °C) with 0.1% Me2SO (vehicle control), 20 μm lactacystin, or 100 μmN-acetyl-l-leucinyl-l-leucinyl-l-norleucinal followed by incubation with PV (1 mm, 1.5 h) without changing the medium. Cells were then solubilized (–PV) followed by K8/K18 precipitation, blotting with anti-Ran Ab, and then Coomassie Blue staining of the membrane. The arrowhead indicates position of normal nonoxidized 25-kDa Ran.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We then tested whether oxidized actin or Gβ also binds to keratins. As shown in Fig. 3B, the oxidized form of Gβ (Gβ contains multiple cysteines) co-immunoprecipitates with K8/K18 when isolated from PV-treated cells and not from untreated cells. However, actin was not detected using similar K8/K18 immunoprecipitation conditions (not shown). This suggests that some but not all oxidized proteins can bind to keratins, which is likely related to the context of the oxidized epitope within the protein backbone.Oxidized Ran Is Rapidly Degraded in Vivo by the Proteasome—The potentially deleterious effects of oxidation and generation of reactive oxygen species can be overcome by several cellular defense mechanisms including superoxide dismutase and catalase. However, oxidized proteins often loose their function and are potentially toxic if allowed to accumulate (33.Grune T. Reinheckel T. Davies K.J.A. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 526-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 34.Shringarpure R. Davies K.J.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 1084-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Oxidized proteins are susceptible to rapid degradation by the proteasome, which provides a likely protective mechanism to prevent cellular accumulation of potentially toxic damaged proteins (34.Shringarpure R. Davies K.J.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 1084-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested whether proteasome inhibition helps to detect the 27-kDa Ran and its K8/K18 association in vivo. Oxidized Ran co-immunoprecipitated with K8/K18 when cells are cultured in the presence of PV and proteasome inhibitors but not in the presence of PV alone (Fig. 3C). This explains why PV-oxidized Ran is readily seen in cell-free systems (Fig. 1) but is difficult to detect in cells. Notably, calpain (PD150606) and lysosome (pepstatin/leupeptin) inhibitors had a minimal effect on 27-kDa Ran turnover (not shown). These findings are consistent with earlier studies that demonstrate accumulation of oxidized proteins and a concomitant decline in proteolytic activity with age (35.Stadtman E.R. Science. 1992; 257: 1220-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (2376) Google Scholar, 36.Petropoulos I. Conconi M. Wang X. Hoenel B. Bregegere F. Milner Y. Friguet B. J. Gerontol. A. Biol. Sci. Med. Sci. 2000; 55: B220-B227Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar).PV-induced Oxidation of Ran Cys-112 Accounts for Formation of 27-kDa Ran and Keratin-Ran Association—We hypothesized that oxidation of one or more of the Ran cysteines may account for generation of 27-kDa Ran and for Ran-keratin binding. To test this hypothesis, we generated individual or combined human Ran cysteine mutants and demonstrated their expression in Escherichia coli (Fig. 4, A and B). We then examined the effect of Cys mutation on the ability to form 27-kDa Ran and showed that mutation of the three Ran cysteines or of Ran Cys-112 alone ablated the altered Ran gel migration after exposure to PV, whereas the Ran Cys-85 or Cys-120 mutants had no effect (Fig. 4C). Similarly, reconstitution of Ran-keratin binding using WT or mutant bacterially expressed Ran showed that Cys-112 is the critical cysteine that, when oxidized to cysteic acid, causes Ran-keratin binding (Fig. 4D).Fig. 4Mutation of Ran Cys-112 ablates Ran-keratin binding and formation of 27-kDa Ran.A, the cDNA constructs encoding the individual or combined Ran cysteine mutants are shown. Triple, triple C85F,C112F,C120A mutant. B, bacterial expression of WT and mutant Ran was confirmed by the analysis of bacterial homogenates using SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. C, homogenates were prepared from E. coli cells that express WT or cys-mutant Ran. Homogenates were incubated +/–PV (2 h, 4 °C) and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by blotting with anti-Ran Ab. HT29 cell lysates are also included as a control. The arrowhead indicates the position of oxidized Ran. D, K8/K18 immunoprecipitates (ip) bound to Sepharose-Ab beads were prepared from HT29 cells. Bacterially expressed Ran (WT or mutant) lysates were generated followed by incubation with PV and the K8/K18-containing beads (4 °C, 16 h). The beads were washed and processed for blotting with anti-Ran Ab (lower panel). The blotted membrane was stained by Coomassie Blue to visualize the input keratin (middle panel), and equal aliquots of the Ran input were analyzed by blotting (upper panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Our overall findings led to two important conclusions. First, PV-mediated oxidation involved not only Ran but also actin and Gβ and was likely to affect many other cys-containing proteins by converting cysteine to cysteic acid. This PV-induced oxidation resulted in SDS-PAGE retardation (Fig. 5, inset panel) that mimiced migration changes caused by phosphorylation. Thus, caution should be used in assigning such shifts to phosphorylation, particularly since PV indirectly also increases tyrosine phosphorylation of many proteins. Second, we propose a potential unique role of keratins in sequestering oxidized damaged proteins, such as Ran, when proteasome function is inhibited or overwhelmed (Fig. 5). Such a role meshes well with the known function of K8/K18 in cytoprotection, as demonstrated particularly in the liver (37.Omary M.B. Ku N.O. Toivola D.M. Hepatology. 2002; 35: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). It will be important to determine whether keratin sequestration of oxidized proteins extends to other keratins or other IF proteins and the scope of other non-Ran oxidized proteins that can be involved in such binding. Keratin binding to oxidized proteins does involve other non-Ran proteins, as demonstrated herein for Gβ (Fig. 3B). A data bank search of the Ran sequence surrounding Cys-112 did not show homology with other non-Ran proteins. This, coupled with the ability of K8/"

This channel is gated by intracellular protons, in which a lysine residue (Lys80) plays a critical role. Mutation of the Lys80 to a methionine (K80M) disrupts pH-dependent channel gating. To understand how an individual subunit in a tetrameric channel is involved in pH-dependent channel gating, we performed these studies by introducing K80M-disrupted subunits to tandem tetrameric channels. The pH sensitivity was studied in whole-cell voltage clamp and inside-out patches. Homomeric tetramers of the wild-type (wt) and K80M-disrupted channels showed a pH sensitivity almost identical to that of their monomeric counterparts. In heteromeric tetramers and dimers, pH sensitivity was a function of the number of wt subunits. Recruitment of the first single wt subunit shifts the pKa greatly, whereas additions of any extra wt subunit had smaller effects. Single-channel analysis revealed that the tetrameric channel with two or more wt subunits showed one substate conductance at ∼40% of the full conductance, suggesting that four subunits act as two pairs. However, three and four substates of conductance were seen in the tetrameric wt-3K80M and 4K80M channels. Acidic pH increased long-time closures when there were two or more wt subunits. Disruption of more than two subunits led to flicking activity with appearance of a new opening event and loss of the long period of closures. Interestingly, the channel with two wt subunits at diagonal and adjacent configurations showed the same pH sensitivity, substate conductance, and long-time closure. These results thus suggest that one functional subunit is sufficient to act in the pH-dependent gating of the Kir1.1 channel, the channel sensitivity to pH increases with additional subunits, the full pH sensitivity requires contributions of all four subunits, and two subunits may be coordinated in functional dimers of either trans or cis configuration.

However, three and four substates of conductance were seen in the tetrameric wt-3K80M and 4K80M channels. Acidic pH increased long-time closures when there were two or more wt subunits. Disruption of more than two subunits led to flicking activity with appearance of a new opening event and loss of the long period of closures. Interestingly, the channel with two wt subunits at diagonal and adjacent configurations showed the same pH sensitivity, substate conductance, and long-time closure. These results thus suggest that one functional subunit is sufficient to act in the pH-dependent gating of the Kir1.1 channel, the channel sensitivity to pH increases with additional subunits, the full pH sensitivity requires contributions of all four subunits, and two subunits may be coordinated in functional dimers of either trans or cis configuration. Kir1.1 (ROMK1) is a member of the inward rectifier K+ (Kir) channel family. A functional channel consists of four Kir subunits, and each Kir subunit has two membrane-spanning helices and a pore-forming sequence (1.Nichols C.G. Lopatin A.N. Annu. Rev.

The Kir1.1 channel was originally cloned from the outer medulla of the kidney and later found in several other tissues (3.Ho K. Nichols C.G. Lederer W.J. Lytton J. Vassilev P.M. Kanazirska M.V.

Among them is a lysine residue (Lys80) at the boundary between the M1 and the N terminus of the Kir1.1 channel. Mutation of this residue to a methionine disrupts pH-dependent channel gating (14.Fakler B. Schultz J.H. Yang J. Schulte U. Brandle U. Zenner H.P. Jan L.Y. Ruppersberg J.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4093-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). A similar effect has been found in several other Kir channels that have such a lysine residue (15.Choe H. Zhou H. Palmer L.G.

One approach is to disrupt one or more functional subunits in a tetrameric channel. How an individual subunit contributes to the channel gating can then be evaluated. Such a subunit disruption intervention may yield information about subunit coordination, cooperativity, dominant-negative effect, and minimal requirement of functional subunits for channel gating. To elucidate the subunit stoichiometry in pH-dependent Kir1.1 channel gating, we therefore performed these studies on tandem dimeric and tandem tetrameric channels in which a predetermined number of subunits carrying the K80M mutation was introduced. The channel pH sensitivity was studied as we have documented previously (17.Xu H. Yang Z. Cui N. Giwa L.R. Abdulkadir L. Patel M. Sharma P. Shan G. Shen W. Jiang C. Am. J. Physiol.

In brief, frogs were anesthetized by bathing them in 0.3% 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester. A few lobes of ovaries were removed after a small abdominal incision (∼5 mm). Then, the surgical incision was closed, and the frogs were allowed to recover from the anesthesia. Xenopus oocytes were treated with 0.5 mg/ml collagenase (type I; Sigma) in OR2 solution (82 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) for 90 min at room temperature. After 10–20 washes (2 min each) of the oocytes with the OR2 solution, cDNAs (25–50 ng in 50 nl of water) were injected into the oocytes. The oocytes were then incubated at 18 °C in ND-96 solution containing 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, and 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate with 100 mg/liter Geneticin added (pH 7.4).Rat Kir1.1 (ROMK1, GenBank™ accession number X72341) cDNA was generously provided by Dr. Steven Hebert (Yale University). The cDNA was subcloned into a eukaryotic expression vector (pcDNA3.1; Invitrogen) and used for Xenopus oocyte expression without cRNA synthesis. To construct tandem dimeric and tandem tetrameric channels, a cassette was constructed with an EcoRI restriction site introduced at the 5′ end and an MfeI site introduced at the 3′ end of Kir1.1 cDNA using PCR. Based on the cassette, site-specific mutations of Lys80 to methionine and of the stop codon to tyrosine were then prepared using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The cDNA of wild-type (wt) 1The abbreviations used are: wt, wild-type; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; CNG, cyclic nucleotide-gated; HCN, hyperpolarization- and cyclic nucleotide-activated. Kir1.1 without stop codon was linearized with the MfeI restriction enzyme. The K80M mutant with stop codon was digested with EcoRI and MfeI restriction enzymes. The isolated K80M mutant was then ligated to the linearized wt Kir1.1 to form dimeric wt-K80M. The same strategy was used to construct wt-wt and K80M-K80M tandem dimers. Because the stop codon was removed in the first monomer, all tandem dimers had only one open reading frame. There are five amino acids (YGFPS) created between each monomer in these dimeric channels. To confirm correct mutations, the constructs were examined with DNA sequencing. Based on the appearance of single or double peaks at codon 80 (AAA versus ATG), homomeric or heteromeric dimers were confirmed.Cohesive ends of EcoRI and MfeI restriction sites are complementary. Because both restriction sites are lost after ligation, each dimer still contains only one EcoRI site in front of the first ATG codon and one MfeI site behind the stop codon. This allows a construction of tandem tetramers by joining two of the dimers. To do so, the first dimer was constructed with the stop codon eliminated, which was joined by another dimer with intact stop codon. Using different combinations of two sets of dimers, various tandem tetramers were generated (Table I). Correct orientation of the constructs was confirmed with DNA sequencing, and appropriate size was proved by isolation of the tetrameric DNA from the pcDNA3.1 using two restriction enzymes.Table ICurrent responses to CO2 and pHNameBL ICO2 effectpKahμA%Monomer Kir1.1-13.3 ± 2.7-76.7 ± 2.0 (8)6.75 ± 0.01 (5)4.1 ± 0.5 K80M-16.5 ± 12.00.7 ± 1.5 (5)5.70 ± 0.03 (4)1.2 ± 0.1Tandem dimer wt-wt-13.0 ± 3.4-77.3 ± 4.2 (4)6.78 ± 0.02 (4)4.0 ± 1.0 wt-K80M-13.7 ± 5.6-10.2 ± 2.4 (12)6.22 ± 0.01 (4)3.0 ± 0.2 K80M-K80M-22.9 ± 1.81.4 ± 3.0 (6)5.75 ± 0.03 (4)1.2 ± 0.1Tandem tetramer 4wt-4.3 ± 1.7-79.3 ± 4.2 (6)6.81 ± 0.01 (4)3.7 ± 0.2 3wt-K80M-5.4 ± 2.0-37.7 ± 3.9 (10)6.59 ± 0.01 (5)3.3 ± 0.1 trans 2wt-2K80M-6.1 ± 1.4-12.8 ± 1.5 (14)6.23 ± 0.01 (5)2.8 ± 0.2 cis 2wt-2K80M-5.9 ± 1.1-12.5 ± 0.7 (6)6.22 ± 0.01 (5)2.8 ± 0.1 wt-3K80M-7.5 ± 3.6-2.3 ± 3.1 (5)6.01 ± 0.02 (5)2.0 ± 0.2 4K80M-5.4 ± 1.00.2 ± 3.8 (5)5.80 ± 0.05 (4)1.2 ± 0.2 Open table in a new tab Whole-cell currents were recorded with two-electrode voltage clamp 2–4 days after cDNA injection using an amplifier (Geneclamp 500; Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, CA) at room temperature (∼24 °C).

Macroscopic and single-channel currents were analyzed using the Clampfit 9 software (Axon Instruments Inc.). Currents were expressed as a function of pHi with Hill equation: y = 1/{1 + (pKa/pHi)h}, where y is the normalized current amplitude, pKa is the midpoint pH value for channel inhibition, and h is the Hill coefficient. SigmaPlot was used for data fitting with pKa and h as two free parameters.Single-channel conductance was measured using slope command potentials from 100 to –100 mV. The open state probability (Popen) was calculated by first measuring the time (tj) spent at current levels corresponding to j = 0, 1, 2,...... N channels open, based on all evident openings during the entire period of record (21.Yang Z. Xu H. Cui N. Qu Z. Chanchevalap S. Shen W. Jiang C. J. Gen.

The Popen was then obtained as popen=(∑j=1Ntjj)/TN, where N is the number of channels active in the patch, and T is the duration of recordings. Popen values were calculated from one to three stretches of data acquired using the FETCHEX software (Axon Instruments Inc.). Open and closed times were measured from records in which only a single active channel was active. Data were further filtered at 0 to 1,000 Hz using Gaussian filter. The open and closed time distributions were fitted using the Marquardt-LSQ method in the PSTAT6 software (Axon Instruments Inc.) with datum duration of >60 s. The current amplitude was analyzed using all-point histograms. Each peak was described with the Gaussian distribution to indicate substate levels of conductance.Data are presented as means ± S.E. All patch data reported were based on four or more patches obtained from at least two oocytes, and a minimum of four oocytes was used to test the CO2 effect. Differences of CO2 and pH effects with low pH exposures were examined using analysis of variance or Student's t tests and considered to be statistically significant if p ≤ 0.05.RESULTSProton-dependent Gating of Monomeric Kir1.1 and Its K80M Mutant—The Kir1.1 channel was expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Whole-cell K+ currents were recorded with two-electrode voltage clamp in a bath solution (KD90) containing 90 mm K+. Consistent with previous reports (17.Xu H. Yang Z. Cui N. Giwa L.R. Abdulkadir L.

Injection of the expression vector alone did not yield inward rectifying currents, and the currents measured at –160 mV were 0.5 ± 0.1 μA (n = 9).Exposure of the oocytes to 15% CO2 produced strong and reversible inhibition of the inward rectifying currents (–76.7 ± 2.0%, n = 8). The effect was mediated by pH rather than molecular CO2 because intracellular, but not extracellular, acidification to the same pH levels as seen during CO2 exposures produced the same degree of current inhibition (26.Zhu G.

Mutation of Lys80 to methionine (K80M), a residue found in the pH-insensitive Kir2.1 channel, totally eliminated the inhibitory effect of CO2 on the whole-cell currents (0.7 ± 1.5%, n = 5).The pH sensitivity was also studied in excised inside-out patches. In these experiments, expression of the Kir1.1 channel was first screened in whole-cell recording. Then, macroscopic currents consisting of more than five active channels were recorded in excised patches using recording pipettes with a tip diameter of 4–5 μm. Exposure of the intracellular membrane to low pH perfusates produced concentration-dependent inhibition of the currents. The pHi-dependent response of the Kir1.1 currents was described with the Hill equation, and the pKa value (pHi level at 50% current inhibition) and the Hill coefficient (h) were subsequently obtained (see Fig. 2 legend), which were 6.75 ± 0.01 (n = 5) and 4.1 ± 0.5 (n = 5), respectively. The pHi sensitivity of the K80M mutant was very low with pKa 5.70 ± 0.03 (n = 4) and h = 1.2 ± 0.1 (n = 4) (Table I). These observations are thus consistent with previous studies (8.Tsai T.D.

All of them expressed inward rectifying currents with amplitudes of –10 to –25 μA (Fig. 1 and Table I). Exposure to 15% CO2 led to inhibition of the wt-wt currents by 77.3 ± 4.2% (n = 4), to the same degree as monomeric Kir1.1 (p > 0.05). Like monomeric K80M, K80M-K80M totally lost its CO2 sensitivity (Fig. 1C and Table I). In contrast, wt-K80M was inhibited by 10.2 ± 2.4% (n = 12) when exposed to 15% CO2 (Fig. 1, B and D).Fig. 1The effect of hypercapnic acidosis on dimeric Kir1.1 channels.

Under this condition, clear inward rectifying currents were seen in the oocyte 3 days after the injection. These currents were strongly and reversibly inhibited when the cell was exposed to 15% CO2. B, similar experiments were performed on another oocyte expressing the wt-K80M dimer. The currents were modestly inhibited with 15% CO2. C, the K80M-K80M dimer was unaffected by the same concentration of CO2. D, the percentage inhibition of the inward rectifying currents of monomeric and dimeric Kir1.1 channels. Data are presented as means ± S.E.

The pH sensitivity of the dimeric K80M-K80M was greatly reduced with pKa 5.75 ± 0.03 (n = 4) (Fig. 2C). The concentration-response curves from the dimeric wt-wt and K80M-K80M nicely match those obtained from monomeric wt and K80M-mutant channels (Fig. 2D), indicating that the pH sensitivity of the dimers is well retained. In contrast to the dominant-negative effect of certain residues in the selectivity filter, the K80M-disrupted subunit did not completely eliminate the pH sensitivity of the heteromeric channel. The pHi response of the heteromeric wt-K80M dimer lay in between those of the homomeric wt and K80M-mutant channels (Fig. 2B). In comparison to the wt channel, the titration curve of the wt-K80M was shifted left by 0.56 pH unit (pKa 6.22 ± 0.01, n = 4). Such a change was not a parallel shift because the Hill coefficient was lowered from 4.0 in wt-wt to 3.0 in wt-K80M (Table I).Stoichiometry of Tandem Tetrameric K80M Channels in pH-dependent Channel Gating—To elucidate the contribution of two functional subunits (in adjacent and diagonal positions) to pH-dependent Kir1.1 channel gating and the effect of one or three subunit disruptions on a tetrameric channel, tandem tetrameric channels were constructed. The homomeric wt and K80M-mutant tandem tetramers are named 4wt and 4K80M, respectively. Tandem tetramers with one and three mutant subunits refer to 3wt-K80M and wt-3K80M. Heteromeric tandem tetramers with two mutant subunits at the diagonal and adjacent positions are trans 2wt-2K80M and cis 2wt-2K80M.Baseline whole-cell currents of the tandem tetrameric channels remained the same as the wt Kir1.1 channel, although the current amplitude was smaller (Table I). The 4wt and 4K80M responded to 15% CO2 to almost the same extent as their monomeric counterparts (Table I), indicating that pH-dependent channel gating is unaffected by the tandem construction. Introduction of one K80M-disrupted subunit to a tandem tetrameric channel (3wt-K80M) markedly reduced the CO2 sensitivity in comparison with 4wt (Fig. 3, A and E). Further decrease in the CO2 sensitivity was seen in 2wt-2K80M tetramers. Interestingly, both the trans and cis forms of 2wt-2K80M showed the same level of inhibition by 15% CO2 (Fig. 3, B, C, and E). CO2 (15%) did not produce evident inhibition in the wt-3K80M (Fig. 3, D and E).Fig. 3CO2 sensitivity of tandem tetramers. A, 3wt-K80M was moderately inhibited by hypercapnic acidosis. B and C, trans 2wt-2K80M responded to CO2 to the same extent as cis 2wt-2K80M. D, wt-3K80M lost its CO2 sensitivity. E, the graded decrease in CO2 sensitivity is revealed when the percentage inhibition of the inward rectifying currents (I) is plotted out. Note that the same levels of inhibition are seen in cis and trans 2wt-2K80M.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image"
