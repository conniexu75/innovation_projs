https://openalex.org/W1591909631,"Primary chick embryo liver cells, which had been previously cultured in Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, had the same characteristics (inducibility of delta-aminolevulinic acid synthetase and synthesis of plasma proteins) when cultured in a completely defined Ham F-12 medium containing insulin. Insulin was active in the physiological range; 2 to 3 nM were sufficient to increase the induced delta-aminolevulinic acid synthetase to 50% of the maximum effect obtained with a saturating amount of insulin (30 nM). Serum albumin added to the Ham-insulin medium caused protoporphyrin but not uroporphyrin, generated in the cultured liver cells, to be transferred to the medium. As little as 10 mug of human serum albumin per ml caused the transfer of one-half of the protoporphyrin. Bovine serum albumin was only about 1/30 as effective. A spectrofluorometric method and calculation procedure are described for quantitation, in the nanomolar range, of total porphyrin and the percentage of this that is protoporphyrin or uroporphyrin plus coproporphyrin. The method is satisfactory for the measurement of porphyrins generated by 1 mg wet weight of cells in culture in 20 hours. Heme (0.1 to 0.3 muM), when added to the medium as hemin, human hemoglobin, or chicken hemoglobin, specifically inhibited the induction of delta-aminolevulinic acid synthetase by one-half. This high sensitivity for heme was observed under conditions in which the defined medium was of serum and where a chelator of iron was added to the medium to diminish the synthesis of endogenous heme. Heme endogenously generated from exogenous delta-aminolevulinic acid also inhibited the induction; chelators of iron prevented this inhibition. The migration of heme from the mitochondria to other portions of the cell is discussed in terms of the affinities of different proteins for heme. A hypothesis of a steady state of liver heme metabolism, controlled by the concentration of free heme, is presented. The different effects of heme on the synthesis of a number of proteins are summarized."
https://openalex.org/W2091001646,"Histones H2A and H2B of the sea urchin embryo have been resolved by new methods into components that are synthesized at different stages of development. One form of H2A and one form of H2B are synthesized only during the period from fertilization to the blastula stage. Subsequently, two other types of H2A and H2B molecules are synthesized. In addition, a histonelike protein was detected which is synthesized only from fertilization until the 16-cell stage when the synthesis of still another H2A-like protein begins. None of the late-appearing forms are derived from histone polypeptide chains synthesized earlier in development. Since the early components do not disappear after their synthesis stops, these modulations of histone synthesis lead to an increase in histone multiplicity, concomitant with the beginning of cell diversification and a decrease in cell division rate."
https://openalex.org/W2137464185,"Ethnomedicine is an intellectual area which embraces theoretical concerns that are relevant to both the social and biological sciences. The relation which exists between disease, social behavior, and human adaptation constitutes the primary subject matter of ethnomedicine. This relation is examined in terms of man's unique capacities for symbolization and culture. Since ethnomedical generalizations explain how social groups deal with a generic disease, they can be used to examine contemporary problems which involve the organization and practice of medicine as well as problems that stem from relations of the medical system with other subsystems in the group. Recasting contemporary social problems in this way may help to clarify their roots and sources (13,28). In focusing on fundamental properties of disease in man, ethnomedicine can also help to clarify the effects and meanings of disease and thereby make its control more rational. A theory of disease, an ultimate aim of ethnomedical inquiry, will serve as an explanatory device with wide-ranging applications."
https://openalex.org/W2025765142,"Men and women estimated (by the method of magnitude estimation) the pleasantness and intensity of the odors of vaginal secretions sampled from consecutive phases of 15 ovulatory menstrual cycles of four women. On the average, secretions from preovulatory and ovulatory phases were slightly weaker and less unpleasant in odor than those from menstrual, early luteal, and late luteal phases. However, considerable variation in odor patterns was present across cycles from the same donor, as well as across cycles from different donors. These results indicate that human vaginal odors change slightly in both pleasantness and intensity during the menstrual cycle, but do not support the notion that such odors are particularly attractive to humans in an in vitro test situation."
https://openalex.org/W2096494712,"C3a anaphylatoxin is derived from the third component (C3) of the blood complement system. Selective proteolysis of C3 by activated proenzymes indigenous to blood generates the C3a fragment. Human C3a was isolated from inulin-activated serum containing 6-aminohexanoic acid, according to recently published procedures (Hugli, T. E., Vallota, E., and Muller-Eberhard, H. J. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 1472-1498). The human C3a fragment is a highly cationic molecule exhibiting an approximate molecular weight of 9000 and composed of 77 amino acid residues. It consists of a single polypeptide chain containing 8% cysteine and lacks both tryptophan and carbohydrate. A tentative primary structure for the human C3a molecule, deduced from overlapping peptides obtained after cyanogen bromide cleavage, tryptic and chymotryptic digestion, is: See article. Two cystelhylcysteine sequences were established at positions 22, 23 and 56, 57 in human C3a. The 6 half-cystine residues in C3a are all interconnected through three disulfide linkages intersecting in a disulfide knot. The functionally amino acid residues distributed among 14 residues at the COOH-terminal end of C3a. This unusually cationic COOH-terminal region of C3a is presumed to play an important role in the interaction of this protein molecule with cellular receptors. A comparison between the linear sequence of human C3a and the NH2-terminal sequences of light and heavy chains of human immunoglobulin indicates that limited identity exists."

It is now reported that discoidin consists of two distinct lectins, designated discoidin I and discoidin II, which, although similar in some respects, differ in their electrophoretic mobilities, isoelectric points, subunit molecular weights, amino acid compositions, tryptic peptide maps, the erythrocyte species which they agglutinate, and the sensitivity of their agglutination activity to inhibition by monosaccharides. Furthermore, discoidins I and II differ in their developmental regulation as evidenced by the distinct time courses of their appearance during differentiation."

Numbers of adults breeding probably reflect food supplies and recruitment from more successful colonies to the south, but improving fledging rates (up to 0.9 young per nest in 1974) reflect better egg survival and improving eggshell condition, with declining DDE contamination in anchovies, their major food source."

https://openalex.org/W1585780531,"Chick embryonic liver and neural retina cells aggregate in a two-step process. Initially, cells formed a loose association in a step that apparently did not require metabolic energy. Cells bound in this manner were dissociable by mild shear forces or by simple dilution. The results of the dilution experiments suggest a readily reversible binding of single cells to form these types of aggregates. In a second step, which required metabolic energy, the cells became firmly, or stably attached. The formation of both types of bond was temperature-dependent. Kinetic studies indicated that the formation of reversible bonds between cells was required before the cells could become stably attached, and that reversibly bound cells were converted directly into stably bound cells."
https://openalex.org/W2103821841,"Various properties of nonhistone messenger RNA species containing poly(A), [+A]mRNA, and lacking poly(A), [−A]mRNA, are described: the rates of turnover of these mRNA classes are not significantly different, as indicated by their similar rates of entry into and decay from the cytoplasm; each mRNA class is essentially entirely transcribed from unique DNA sequences; the ratio of [+A] to [−A] nonhistone mRNA increases with increase in size of free polyribosome, although the average molecular weights of these mRNAs are similar in each polysomal size class. These results indicate that the [+A]mRNA species tend to be more fully loaded with ribosomes than the nonhistone [−A]mRNA species."
https://openalex.org/W1537179785,"Murine erythroleukemic cells induced to differentiate in vitro with dimethylsulfoxide provide a model for events involved in the regulated expression of the globin genes. Here we examine alpha- and beta-globin gene expression in such cells which contain no detectable globin RNA prior to induction. To quantitate alpha- and beta-globin RNAs in cellular RNA samples by molecular hybridization techniques, highly radioactive complementary DNAs were synthesized using mouse alpha- and beta-globin RNAs purified by formamide gel electrophoresis. Maximally induced erythroleukemic cells and mouse reticulocytes contain nearly equal relative amounts of alpha- and beta-globin RNA. During the period in which globin RNA accumulates in differentiating erythroleukemic cells, however, alpha- and beta-globin RNAs are not present in equivalent amounts. alphaRNA is present in substantial excess (alpha/beta ratio 3.7) early in induction, and the alpha/beta RNA ratio progressively approaches 1 as differentiation proceeds further. These observations directly suggest that the alpha- and beta-globin genes are differentially expressed during cellular differentiation and raise questions as to how relative expression of globin genes is controlled during normal development."

In addition, unknown compounds that may represent other C28 ecdysones were detected in very low concentrations. The milkweed bug could well possess a biosynthetic-metabolic pathway for C28 molting hormones instead of or in addition to known pathways for the C27 ecdysones."

https://openalex.org/W1566028343,"Incubation of cholesterol with a bovine adrenocortical mitochondrial acetone-dried powder preparation yielded (22R)-22-hydroxycholesterol (I), (20R,22R)-20,22-dihydroxycholesterol(II), and pregnenolone (III) which were conclusively identified by combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Incubations with [4-14C]cholesterol yielded I, II, and III with specific activities (determined from partial mass-spectral scans) not significantly different from those of the used substrate or the cholesterol reisolated after the incubation, demonstrating that the isolated compounds arose mostly, if not entirely, from the substrate cholesterol. Incubations in an 18O-enriched atmosphere yielded I, II, and III with 18O at position C-22, C-20 and C-22, and C-20, respectively, providing evidence that the hydroxyl groups of the side chain of I and II and the C-20 oxygen atom of III originated from molecular oxygen. The distribution of the oxygen atoms in II after incubation with 18O2 and 16O2 (devoid of 16O18O) proved that the hydroxyl groups of the side chain of II were introduced from two different molecules of oxygen, consistent with a sequential hydroxylation of cholesterol. No (20S)-20-hydroxycholesterol was found. Incubation of I in an 18O-enriched atmosphere afforded II and III with 18O at C-20."

While the recruitment mechanism is basically similar, the speed and the number of ants recruited are greater form army ants than for other ants."
https://openalex.org/W1603342490,"Single heart cells dissociated from 14-day-old chicken embryos were reagregated into spheroidal clusters on a gyratory shaker and centrifuged to form cohesive discs of approximately 400 aggregates. These cultured cells accumulated 2-amino[1-14C]isobutyric acid against a gradient. When incubated for 3 hours in a protein-free, buffered, balanced salt solution, concentrative transport decreased to a stable basal level. Incubation in the presence of sodium bovine insulin prevented this fall in transport activity and resulted in increased 2-aminoisobutyric acid uptake to concentrations 40 time sthat in the medium during a subsequent 3-hour transport assay. Intracellular accumulation of 2-aminoisobutyric acid was linear during the initial 15 min of transport in the presence and absence of added insulin. Basal transport of 2-aminoisobutyric acid was temperature-dependent, requied extracellular sodium greater than 125 meg/liter, and demonstrated saturation with an apparent Vmax of 3.4 mmol/liter/10 min and an apparent Km of 2.6 mM. Basal transport activity was not reduced by cycloheximide or puromycin even after 3 hours of exposure..."

https://openalex.org/W2015677072,"Electrical responses from the skate retina will only follow flicker up to frequencies of 5 hertz when intensities are below rod saturation. At greater luminances, the eye responds to rates as high as 30 hertz. As a result, a plot of critical flicker fusion as a function of intensity is a double branched curve. It seems that prolonged stimulation of skate rods, at high intensities, permits them to change their temporal response characteristics so that they follow high frequencies much as cones do in the duplex retina."

https://openalex.org/W205446439,"Co2+, which activates rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase, competes with Mn2+ for the active site of the enzyme with a KD of 46 muM. Co2+ binds to phosphoenolpyruvate with a KD of 4.1 mM. The structures of the binary Co2+/P-enolpyruvate, and quaternary pyruvate kinase/Co2+/K+/P-enolpyruvate complexes were studied using EPR and the effects of Co2+ on the longitudinal (T1) and transverse (T2) relaxation times of the protons of water and P-enolpyruvate and the phosphorus of P-enolpyruvate. The EPR spectra of all complexes at 6 K, disappear above 40 K and reveal principal g values between 2 and 7 indicating high spin Co2+. For free Co2+ and for the binary Co2+/P-enolpyruvate complex, the T1 of water protons was independent of frequency in the range 8, 15, 24.3, 100, and 220 MHz. Assuming coordination numbers (q) of 6 and 5 for free Co2+ and Co2+/P-enolpyruvate, respectively, correlation times (tauc) of 1.3 times 10(-13) and 1.7 times 10(-13) s, were calculated. The distances from Co2+ and phosphorus and to the cis and trans protons in the binary Co2+/P-enolpyruvate complex calculated from their T1 values were 2.7 A, 4.1 A, AND 5.3 A, respectively, indicating an inner sphere phosphoryl complex. Consistent with direct phosphoryl coordination, a large Co2+ to phosphorus hyperfine contact coupling constant (A/h) of 5 times 10(5) Hz was determined by the frequency dependence of the T2 of phosphorus at 25.1, 40.5, and 101.5 MHz. For both enzyme complexes, the dipolar correlation time tauc was 2 times 10(-12) s and the number of rapidly exchanging water ligands (q) was 0.6 as determined from the frequency dependence of the T1 of water protons. In the quaternary enzyme/Co2+/K+/P-enolyruvate complex this tauc value was consistent with the frequency dependence of the T1 of the phosphorus of enzyme-bound P-enolpyruvate at 25.1 and 40.5 MHz. Distances from enzyme-bound C02+ to the phosphorus and protons of P-enolpyruvate, from their T1 values, were 5.0 A and 8 to 10 A, respectively, indicating a predominantly (greater than or equal to 98%) second spere complex and less than 2% inner sphere complex. Consistent with a second sphere complex on the enzyme, an A/h value of less than 10(3) Hz was determined from the frequency dependence of the T2 of phosphorus. In all complexes the exchange reates were found to be faster than the paramagnetic relaxation rates and the hyperfine contact interaction was found to be small compared to the dipolar interaction. The results thus indicate that the interaction of C02+ with P-enolpyruvate is greatly decreased upon binding to the active site of pyruvate kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1630293952,"NMR titration curves are reported for the 4 histidine residues of ribonuclease A in sodium acetate and for ribonuclease S in sodium acetate, phosphate, and sulfate solutions. Evidence is presented that the imidazole side chain of histidine residue 48 undergoes a conformational change, probably also involving the carboxyl side chain of aspartic acid residue 14. This group is considered to be responsible for the low pH inflection with pKa 4.2 present in the NMR titration curve of the C-2 proton resonance of histidine 48. The NMR titration curves of the active site histidine residues 12 and 119 also exhibit inflections at low pH values, although there is no carboxyl group within 9 A of the imidazole side chain of histidine residue 12 in the structure of ribonuclease S determined by x-ray crystallography (Wyckoff, H. W., Tsernoglou, D., Hanson, A. W. Knox, J. R., Lee, B., and Richards, F. M. (1970) J. Biol. Chem. 245, 305-328). Curve fitting was carried out on 11 sets of NMR titration data using a model in which the 3 histidine residues 12, 119, and 48 are assumed to be affected by a common carboxyl group. The results obtained indicate that such a model with fewer parameters gives as good a representation of the data as the model in which each histidine residue is assumed to interact separately with a different carboxyl group. Therefore, it is concluded that the ionization of aspartic acid residue 14 is indirectly experienced by the active site histidine residues through the conformational change at histidine 48. A model assuming mutual interaction of the active site histidine residues does not account for the low pH inflections in these curves."

https://openalex.org/W2057339740,"MALEIC hydrazide (structure I, R1=R2=H) is well known in agriculture as a growth inhibitor, but its mechanism of action is uncertain. Its close structural resemblance to the pyrimidine base uracil (structure II, R1=R2=H) has led to the suggestion that it replaces uracil in the RNA molecule1,2, and although this theory is not universally accepted3, maleic hydrazide is known to be incorporated into RNA2. The crystal structure of maleic hydrazide has now been elucidated (a full report will be published elsewhere) and a model of the molecular structure as found in the crystal has been used in attempts to form base pairs with the nucleic acid bases. The geometrical criteria of hydrogen bond formation suggests that maleic hydrazide can be regarded as either a pyrimidine or a purine analogue."

https://openalex.org/W1543596757,"Hydroxynorvaline (DL-alpha-amino-beta-hydroxyvaleric acid) was shown to competitively inhibit the activation of threonine and valine when tested with tRNA and synthetases prepared from whole chick embryos. However, the hydroxynorvaline was transferred only to threonyl-tRNA and not valyl-tRNA. The hydroxynorvaline had no effect when tested with other amino acids. The Km for threonine was 25 muM and the Ki for hydroxynorvaline was 181 muM. When fibroblasts from embryonic chick tendons were incubated with [3H]threonine and increasing concentrations of hydroxynorvaline, there was a progressive decrease in the incorporation of [3H]threonine so that 1 mM hydroxynorvaline the incorporation into nondialyzable protein was 26% of the control value. A much smaller decrease in the incorporation of other radioactive amino acids was observed. When the cells were incubated hith [14C]proline and 1 mM hydroxynorvaline, the labeled procollagen containing hydroxynorvaline accumulated intracellularly and very little was secreted. Control experiments demonstrated that free hydroxynorvaline did not inhibit the secretion of unsubstituted procollagen. Although the individual pro alpha chains containing hydroxynorvaline were of normal molecular weight (125,000) and hydroxyproline content, only about 50% of this intracellularly retained procollagen was triple helical within the cell as 37 degrees as measured by sensitivity to pepsin digestion. Also only approximately 50% of the pro alpha chains were disulfide-linked to form triple stranded molecules as compared to greater than 85% linkage in unsubstituted procollagen. We postulate that incorporation of hydroxynorvaline alters the conformation of the propeptide extension sufficiently so that: (a) normal assembly of disulfide-linked, triple helical molecules is reduced and (b) assembled triple helical molecules are not properly recognized by the secretory mechanism."
