Mammals have seven sirtuins, Sirt1 to Sirt7. Four of them (Sirt4 to Sirt7) have no detectable or very weak deacetylase activity. We found that Sirt5 is an efficient protein lysine desuccinylase and demalonylase in vitro. The preference for succinyl and malonyl groups was explained by the presence of an arginine residue (Arg(105)) and tyrosine residue (Tyr(102)) in the acyl pocket of Sirt5. Several mammalian proteins were identified with mass spectrometry to have succinyl or malonyl lysine modifications. Deletion of Sirt5 in mice appeared to increase the level of succinylation on carbamoyl phosphate synthase 1, which is a known target of Sirt5. Thus, protein lysine succinylation may represent a posttranslational modification that can be reversed by Sirt5 in vivo."

Yet, our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie CSC properties is limited. Here we show that the activity of TAZ, a transducer of the Hippo pathway, is required to sustain self-renewal and tumor-initiation capacities in breast CSCs. TAZ protein levels and activity are elevated in prospective CSCs and in poorly differentiated human tumors and have prognostic value. Gain of TAZ endows self-renewal capacity to non-CSCs. In epithelial cells, TAZ forms a complex with the cell-polarity determinant Scribble, and loss of Scribble—or induction of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)—disrupts the inhibitory association of TAZ with the core Hippo kinases MST and LATS. This study links the CSC concept to the Hippo pathway in breast cancer and reveals a mechanistic basis of the control of Hippo kinases by cell polarity.

As these processes are normally maintained by stem cells, this has led to the attractive hypothesis that tumor initiation and progression are also driven by cancer stem cells (CSCs), here defined as the fraction of tumor cells specifically endowed with self-renewal and tumor-seeding potential and ability to spawn non-CSC progeny (Visvader and Lindeman, 2008Visvader J.E. Lindeman G.J. Cancer stem cells in solid tumours: accumulating evidence and unresolved questions.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 755-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (2812) Google Scholar). The definition of CSCs remains largely operational, i.e., based on functional assays that register self-renewal in vitro and tumor initiation in vivo (Gupta et al., 2009Gupta P.B. Chaffer C.L. Weinberg R.A. Cancer stem cells: mirage or reality?.Nat. Med. 2009; 15: 1010-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). In fact, we have only a scattered understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms that are responsible for the special attributes of CSCs. In breast cancer, tumor cells can be physically separated in at least two distinct populations, one of which is enriched with CSCs (Visvader and Lindeman, 2008Visvader J.E. Lindeman G.J. Cancer stem cells in solid tumours: accumulating evidence and unresolved questions.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 755-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (2812) Google Scholar). Malignant progression is accompanied by an increased proportion of these CSCs within the tumor (Pece et al., 2010Pece S. Tosoni D. Confalonieri S. Mazzarol G. Vecchi M. Ronzoni S. Bernard L. Viale G.

Cancer stem cells: mirage or reality?.Nat. Med. 2009; 15: 1010-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). EMT is a complex transdifferentiation program that is instrumental for the acquisition of stemness by nontransformed and tumor cells (Mani et al., 2008Mani S.A. Guo W. Liao M.J. Eaton E.N. Ayyanan A.

Although EMT is rarely observed in vivo (Chaffer and Weinberg, 2011Chaffer C.L. Weinberg R.A. A perspective on cancer cell metastasis.Science. 2011; 331: 1559-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (3348) Google Scholar, Savagner, 2010Savagner P. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenomenon.Ann. Oncol. 2010; 21: vii89-vii92Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), one of its central features, namely loss of cell polarity, is a fundamental histopathological trait of most human cancers (Thiery et al., 2009Thiery J.P. Acloque H. Huang R.Y. Nieto M.A. Epithelial-mesenchymal transitions in development and disease.Cell. 2009; 139: 871-890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7582) Google Scholar). The mechanistic relationship between EMT, loss of cell polarity, and CSC characteristics remains an open question in cancer biology. Here we report the identification of TAZ, a transcriptional effector of the Hippo signaling cascade (Pan, 2010Pan D. The hippo signaling pathway in development and cancer.Dev. Cell. 2010; 19: 491-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1695) Google Scholar), as molecular thread between these events. We initiated this study with the aim to identify signaling pathways driving tumorigenesis and tumor heterogeneity in human breast cancer. Importantly, these traits have been traced to the CSC subpopulation (Pece et al., 2010Pece S. Tosoni D. Confalonieri S. Mazzarol G. Vecchi M. Ronzoni S. Bernard L. Viale G. Pelicci P.G. Di Fiore P.P. Biological and molecular heterogeneity of breast cancers correlates with their cancer stem cell content.Cell. 2010; 140: 62-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, Visvader and Lindeman, 2008Visvader J.E. Lindeman G.J. Cancer stem cells in solid tumours: accumulating evidence and unresolved questions.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 755-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (2812) Google Scholar). Indeed, CSCs are enriched in high-grade breast cancers (i.e., poorly differentiated tumors classified as G3 by histopathological criteria) when compared to well-differentiated, low-grade (G1) tumors (Pece et al., 2010Pece S. Tosoni D. Confalonieri S. Mazzarol G. Vecchi M. Ronzoni S. Bernard L. Viale G. Pelicci P.G. Di Fiore P.P. Biological and molecular heterogeneity of breast cancers correlates with their cancer stem cell content.Cell. 2010; 140: 62-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). We thus based our initial analysis on clinical data and reasoned that if a given signaling cascade is relevant for amplification/activity of CSCs, this pathway should be identifiable by the specific upregulation of its target genes (gene signature) in G3 versus G1 tumors (Figure 1A , left diagram). For this, we generated a compendium of data (metadataset) from seven independent breast cancer gene-expression datasets that contained information on histological grading. This cohort of 993 primary tumors was analyzed by the significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) algorithm to identify a list of genes differentially expressed in G3 versus G1 tumors. This identified 78 Affymetrix probesets specifically upregulated more than two times in G3 cancers and that showed 99.9% of statistical confidence for differential expression (Table S1 available online). We then used a computational enrichment analysis to test whether the G3-enriched gene set included a higher-than-randomly-expected representation (expected p value < 0.05) of gene signatures that denote the activity of individual signal transduction pathways (Figure 1A, left diagram). In particular, we screened for associations with signatures registering the activity of ERBB2, RAS, Notch, TGF-β, Wnt/β-catenin, Src, STAT3, NF-kB, and Hippo signaling pathways in human mammary cell lines (See Extended Experimental Procedures). Strikingly, the only signatures significantly over-represented in G3 breast cancers were those denoting the activity of the Hippo transducers TAZ and YAP (Figure 1A). The same result was obtained using an independent dataset from the Netherland Cancer Institute (NKI) (van de Vijver et al., 2002van de Vijver M.J. He Y.D. van't Veer L.J. Dai H. Hart A.A. Voskuil D.W. Schreiber G.J. Peterse J.L. Roberts C. Marton M.J. et al.A gene-expression signature as a predictor of survival in breast cancer.N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 347: 1999-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (5271) Google Scholar) that was not included in our metadataset (Figure S1A ). These findings indicate that tumors classified as poorly differentiated/high grade by histopathological criteria display elevated TAZ/YAP activity. As previously reported, G3 breast tumors are also characterized by expression of embryonic and normal mammary stem cell signatures (Ben-Porath et al., 2008Ben-Porath I. Thomson M.W. Carey V.J. Ge R. Bell G.W. Regev A. Weinberg R.A. An embryonic stem cell-like gene expression signature in poorly differentiated aggressive human tumors.Nat.

Biological and molecular heterogeneity of breast cancers correlates with their cancer stem cell content.Cell. 2010; 140: 62-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar) (Figures 1A and 1B), suggesting that TAZ/YAP activity correlates with stemness potential. To reinforce this link, we turned our attention on the most heterogeneous category of breast cancer, that is, G2 tumors, whose characteristics in terms of gene expression and clinical outcome vary from being similar to G1 to being closer to G3 (Ivshina et al., 2006Ivshina A.V. George J. Senko O. Mow B. Putti T.C. Smeds J. Lindahl T. Pawitan Y. Hall P. Nordgren H. et al.Genetic reclassification of histologic grade delineates new clinical subtypes of breast cancer.Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 10292-10301Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). We stratified G2 patients from our metadataset in two categories according to high or low expression levels of TAZ/YAP target genes and found that G2 tumors with high TAZ/YAP activity are associated with an enrichment of stem cell signatures (Figure 1B).Figure S1Validation of TAZ/YAP Gene Signatures in the NKI Dataset, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Enrichment of gene signatures in the list of genes preferentially expressed in G3 versus G1 tumors in NKI dataset.

The log-rank test p value reflects the significance of the association between TAZ/YAP signature “low” and longer survival. Because metastasis is intimately wired to tumor-initiating capacity of a primary tumor (Chaffer and Weinberg, 2011Chaffer C.L. Weinberg R.A. A perspective on cancer cell metastasis.Science. 2011; 331: 1559-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (3348) Google Scholar), we tested whether TAZ/YAP activity was associated to this event in human patients' datasets. As shown by univariate Kaplan-Meier analyses, tumors with high expression of the TAZ/YAP signature displayed a significantly higher probability to develop metastasis and reduced survival compared to tumors characterized by low TAZ/YAP activity (Figures 1C and S1B). Taken together, the data support the notion that activation of TAZ or YAP specifically parallels tumor traits previously linked to their CSC content, such as high histological grade, expression of stem cells signatures, tumor heterogeneity, and metastasis. We next sought to determine whether TAZ/YAP activity plays a causal role in defining CSC traits. As a model of tumor progression, we used two isogenic derivatives of the human mammary MCF10A cell line: Ras-transformed MCF10A-T1k cells (hereafter MII) and their malignant derivative, MCF10A-CA1a cells (also known as MIV), derived from in vivo spontaneous evolution of MII cells (Santner et al., 2001Santner S.J. Dawson P.J. Tait L. Soule H.D. Eliason J. Mohamed A.N. Wolman S.R. Heppner G.H. Miller F.R. Malignant MCF10CA1 cell lines derived from premalignant human breast epithelial MCF10AT cells.Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2001; 65: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Once injected orthotopically in the fat pad of immunocompromized mice, MII cells generate low-grade tumors, whereas MIV cells form high-grade tumors, resembling G3 tumors (Figure 2A ). To validate MII and MIV as a model of increased CSC content during breast cancer progression (Pece et al., 2010Pece S. Tosoni D. Confalonieri S. Mazzarol G. Vecchi M. Ronzoni S. Bernard L. Viale G. Pelicci P.G. Di Fiore P.P. Biological and molecular heterogeneity of breast cancers correlates with their cancer stem cell content.Cell. 2010; 140: 62-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar), we compared their self-renewal potential, as assayed by the capacity to form and propagate mammospheres in vitro and to give rise to tumors in vivo when transplanted in the mouse fat pad (Dontu et al., 2003Dontu G. Abdallah W.M. Foley J.M. Jackson K.W. Clarke M.F. Kawamura M.J. Wicha M.S. In vitro propagation and transcriptional profiling of human mammary stem/progenitor cells.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1253-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar, Visvader and Lindeman, 2008Visvader J.E. Lindeman G.J. Cancer stem cells in solid tumours: accumulating evidence and unresolved questions.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 755-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (2812) Google Scholar). Once cultured in suspension, MIV cells formed more primary and six times more secondary mammospheres than MII cells (Figure 2B). The sphere-forming capacity in subsequent serial passages remained stable for MIV cells but declined for MII cells (Figure 2B and data not shown). In order to measure tumorigenicity, we injected orthotopically 104 and 106 MII or MIV cells. Although both concentrations of MIV cells readily formed tumors in all injected mice, MII-derived tumors were detected only in one-third of mice injected with 106 cells but not at the lower cell concentration (Figure S2A ). Thus, MII and MIV cells are endowed with significantly different self-renewal and tumorigenic potential, recapitulating the differences in CSC representation previously reported for G1 versus G3 tumors (Pece et al., 2010Pece S. Tosoni D. Confalonieri S. Mazzarol G. Vecchi M. Ronzoni S. Bernard L. Viale G. Pelicci P.G. Di Fiore P.P. Biological and molecular heterogeneity of breast cancers correlates with their cancer stem cell content.Cell. 2010; 140: 62-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). We then asked whether the differences in these CSC-related properties could be ascribed to differential expression of TAZ and/or YAP between MII and MIV cells. Intriguingly, western blot analyses showed that TAZ levels are higher in MIV than in MII cells, whereas YAP is expressed similarly in both cell lines (Figure 2C). Moreover, levels of TAZ in MIV cells were comparable to those in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 2C), one of the most established model systems of aggressive breast cancer (Adorno et al., 2009Adorno M. Cordenonsi M. Montagner M. Dupont S. Wong C. Hann B. Solari A. Bobisse S. Rondina M.B. Guzzardo V. et al.A Mutant-p53/Smad complex opposes p63 to empower TGFbeta-induced metastasis.Cell. 2009; 137: 87-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). To directly address the role of TAZ as a determinant of self-renewal, we knocked down endogenous TAZ in MIV cells by shRNA. TAZ knockdown strongly downregulated the expression of Survivin and CTGF, known TAZ/YAP target genes (Pan, 2010Pan D. The hippo signaling pathway in development and cancer.Dev. Cell. 2010; 19: 491-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1695) Google Scholar) (Figure 2D), but had no overt effects on cell viability and proliferation in 2D cultures (data not shown). Remarkably, however, MIV-shTAZ formed significantly less primary and secondary mammospheres than control MIV cells (MIV-shControl) (Figure 2E). We also noticed that the sizes of the mammospheres in control and TAZ-depleted populations were surprisingly similar (Figure 2F), suggesting that high levels of endogenous TAZ in MIV cells do not primarily influence cell proliferation during mammosphere growth. To confirm that these observations are not due to off-target effects of the RNAi approach, we coinfected MIV-shTAZ with an shRNA-insensitive mouse TAZ construct (MIV-shTAZ+mTAZ); this fully rescued TAZ-dependent gene responses and mammosphere-forming capacity (Figures S2B and S2C). To assay whether TAZ regulates tumor-initiating potential of breast cancer cells, we compared MIV-shControl and MIV-shTAZ cells for capacity to seed tumors at limiting dilutions. Whereas shControl cells are able to form tumors in the majority of injected mice, even upon injection of only 20 cells, TAZ-depleted cells showed a dramatic decrease of tumor-seeding ability as up to 104 cells were required to induce tumors in 100% of the animals (Figures 2G and S2D). Based on these data, it is possible to estimate that depletion of TAZ causes about a 20-fold reduction in the number of tumor-initiating cells (p value < 0.0001). Taken together, these in vitro and in vivo results indicate that TAZ is required for self-renewal and tumor initiation of breast cancer cells. We next sought to investigate the role of TAZ as a potential driving force for self-renewal in a pool of CSCs naturally arising within breast cancer cells. To test this, we used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to sort MII cells according to expression of the cell-surface antigen markers CD44 and CD24; this approach has been successfully used to identify putative CSCs contained in primary breast tumors or mammary cell lines based on a CD44high/CD24low immunophenotypical profile, whereas the excluded cells represent a more differentiated tumor progeny of limited stemness potential (Al-Hajj et al., 2003Al-Hajj M. Wicha M.S. Benito-Hernandez A. Morrison S.J. Clarke M.F. Prospective identification of tumorigenic breast cancer cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 3983-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (8429) Google Scholar). As shown in Figures 3A and 3B , FACS analysis readily revealed a CD44high/CD24low subpopulation that displayed higher levels of TAZ protein and transcriptional activity once compared to the remaining cell population (CD44low/CD24low). Moreover, the CD44high/CD24low population displays many CSC-like properties: (1) the CD44high/CD24low cells can regenerate the CD44low/CD24low population but not vice versa, suggesting a lineage hierarchy between these immunologically distinct populations (Figures S3A–S3C); (2) CD44high/CD24low cells are endowed with better long-term self-renewal capacity as measured by mammosphere assays (Figure 3C); (3) CD44high/CD24low cells include the so-called “side population (SP)” (Figure S3D ), which is defined by its ability to exclude the Hoechst vital dye (Dontu et al., 2003Dontu G. Abdallah W.M. Foley J.M. Jackson K.W. Clarke M.F. Kawamura M.J. Wicha M.S. In vitro propagation and transcriptional profiling of human mammary stem/progenitor cells.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1253-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data provide evidence that cell populations endowed with CSC properties express higher levels of TAZ.Figure S3CD44high/CD24low Cell Population from MII Cells Displays CSC-Related Traits, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) MII cells were FACS sorted in the CD44high/CD24low and CD44low/CD24low populations, cultured for 1 month, and analyzed to verify the expression of CD44 and CD24 markers.

(E) Western blot analysis for TAZ in lysates from control (shGFP) and TAZ-depleted MII cells. To establish whether TAZ is functionally relevant for the biological traits of the CD44high/CD24low population, we used three independent shRNAs to knock down endogenous TAZ in MII cells (Figure S3E). TAZ is required for the maintenance of the CD44high/CD24low antigen phenotype (Figure 3D) and for primary and secondary mammosphere formation in MII cells (Figure 3E and data not shown). These findings suggest that TAZ expression is important to maintain self-renewal of prospective CSCs. We next tested whether raising TAZ activity could establish self-renewal properties. To this end, we overexpressed in MII cells a constitutive active point mutant of TAZ, TAZ(S89A) (Pan, 2010Pan D. The hippo signaling pathway in development and cancer.Dev. Cell. 2010; 19: 491-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1695) Google Scholar), and confirmed that it induced the expression of TAZ target genes (Figure S4A ). By flow cytometry, expression of TAZ(S89A) induced an en masse enlargement of the CD44high/CD24low population (Figures 4A and S4B), resembling MIV and MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 4B). Functionally, MII-TAZ(S89A) formed more primary, secondary, and tertiary mammospheres than control cells (Figure 4C). Of note, this was not accompanied by increased proliferation, as the sizes of mammospheres were similar in control and TAZ(S89A)-expressing cells (Figure 4D).Figure 4TAZ Endows Self-Renewal Capacity to Breast Cancer CellsShow full caption(A) Representative FACS profiles with CD24 and CD44 markers of MII cells transduced with control (empty vector) or TAZ(S89A)-encoding retroviral vectors.

We report here that two Parkinson's disease proteins, the Ser/Thr kinase PINK1 and ubiquitin ligase Parkin, participate in this regulation by arresting mitochondrial movement. PINK1 phosphorylates Miro, a component of the primary motor/adaptor complex that anchors kinesin to the mitochondrial surface. The phosphorylation of Miro activates proteasomal degradation of Miro in a Parkin-dependent manner. Removal of Miro from the mitochondrion also detaches kinesin from its surface. By preventing mitochondrial movement, the PINK1/Parkin pathway may quarantine damaged mitochondria prior to their clearance. PINK1 has been shown to act upstream of Parkin, but the mechanism corresponding to this relationship has not been known. We propose that PINK1 phosphorylation of substrates triggers the subsequent action of Parkin and the proteasome."
https://openalex.org/W1999286245,"The transport of Toll-like Receptors (TLRs) to various organelles has emerged as an essential means by which innate immunity is regulated. While most of our knowledge is restricted to regulators that promote the transport of newly synthesized receptors, the regulators that control TLR transport after microbial detection remain unknown. Here, we report that the plasma membrane localized Pattern Recognition Receptor (PRR) CD14 is required for the microbe-induced endocytosis of TLR4. In dendritic cells, this CD14-dependent endocytosis pathway is upregulated upon exposure to inflammatory mediators. We identify the tyrosine kinase Syk and its downstream effector PLCγ2 as important regulators of TLR4 endocytosis and signaling. These data establish that upon microbial detection, an upstream PRR (CD14) controls the trafficking and signaling functions of a downstream PRR (TLR4). This innate immune trafficking cascade illustrates how pathogen detection systems operate to induce both membrane transport and signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W2169416332,"Although eukaryotic nuclei contain distinct architectural structures associated with noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), their potential relationship to regulated transcriptional programs remains poorly understood. Here, we report that methylation/demethylation of Polycomb 2 protein (Pc2) controls relocation of growth-control genes between Polycomb bodies (PcGs) and interchromatin granules (ICGs) in response to growth signals. This movement is the consequence of binding of methylated and unmethylated Pc2 to the ncRNAs TUG1 and MALAT1/NEAT2, located in PcGs and ICGs, respectively. These ncRNAs mediate assembly of multiple corepressors/coactivators and can serve to switch mark recognition by ""readers"" of the histone code. Additionally, binding of NEAT2 to unmethylated Pc2 promotes E2F1 SUMOylation, leading to activation of the growth-control gene program. These observations delineate a molecular pathway linking the actions of subnuclear structure-specific ncRNAs and nonhistone protein methylation to relocation of transcription units in the three-dimensional space of the nucleus, thus achieving coordinated gene expression programs."
https://openalex.org/W2039735909,"Erythrocyte invasion by Plasmodium falciparum is central to the pathogenesis of malaria. Invasion requires a series of extracellular recognition events between erythrocyte receptors and ligands on the merozoite, the invasive form of the parasite. None of the few known receptor-ligand interactions involved are required in all parasite strains, indicating that the parasite is able to access multiple redundant invasion pathways. Here, we show that we have identified a receptor-ligand pair that is essential for erythrocyte invasion in all tested P. falciparum strains. By systematically screening a library of erythrocyte proteins, we have found that the Ok blood group antigen, basigin, is a receptor for PfRh5, a parasite ligand that is essential for blood stage growth. Erythrocyte invasion was potently inhibited by soluble basigin or by basigin knockdown, and invasion could be completely blocked using low concentrations of anti-basigin antibodies; importantly, these effects were observed across all laboratory-adapted and field strains tested. Furthermore, Ok(a-) erythrocytes, which express a basigin variant that has a weaker binding affinity for PfRh5, had reduced invasion efficiencies. Our discovery of a cross-strain dependency on a single extracellular receptor-ligand pair for erythrocyte invasion by P. falciparum provides a focus for new anti-malarial therapies."

https://openalex.org/W2153938645,"Whole-genome sequencing identifies a novel germline variant in the oncogene MITF, which is associated with the development of melanoma. Two papers in this issue of Nature demonstrate that missense substitutions in the gene encoding for microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) are associated with susceptibility to melanoma and renal cell carcinoma. Functional analysis shows that the variant has impaired sumoylation that leads to differential regulation of several MITF targets, and promotes tumour cell clonogenicity, migration and invasion. So far, two genes associated with familial melanoma have been identified, accounting for a minority of genetic risk in families. Mutations in CDKN2A account for approximately 40% of familial cases1, and predisposing mutations in CDK4 have been reported in a very small number of melanoma kindreds2. Here we report the whole-genome sequencing of probands from several melanoma families, which we performed in order to identify other genes associated with familial melanoma. We identify one individual carrying a novel germline variant (coding DNA sequence c.G1075A; protein sequence p.E318K; rs149617956) in the melanoma-lineage-specific oncogene microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF). Although the variant co-segregated with melanoma in some but not all cases in the family, linkage analysis of 31 families subsequently identified to carry the variant generated a log of odds (lod) score of 2.7 under a dominant model, indicating E318K as a possible intermediate risk variant. Consistent with this, the E318K variant was significantly associated with melanoma in a large Australian case–control sample. Likewise, it was similarly associated in an independent case–control sample from the United Kingdom. In the Australian sample, the variant allele was significantly over-represented in cases with a family history of melanoma, multiple primary melanomas, or both. The variant allele was also associated with increased naevus count and non-blue eye colour. Functional analysis of E318K showed that MITF encoded by the variant allele had impaired sumoylation and differentially regulated several MITF targets. These data indicate that MITF is a melanoma-predisposition gene and highlight the utility of whole-genome sequencing to identify novel rare variants associated with disease susceptibility."
https://openalex.org/W1964674045,"The brain is a costly organ to run in terms of energy supply, so how do humans accommodate brains that are so much larger than those of comparable primates without any apparent difficulty? A widely held explanation is the expensive-tissue hypothesis, which proposes a trade-off between brain size and the mass of other energetically expensive organs, especially the digestive tract. Now a survey of 100 mammal species reveals no such trade-off, refuting the idea that expensive tissues compete for energy. There is a negative correlation between the size of brains and the amount of stored energy in the form of adipose tissue, however. The authors propose that the increase in human brain size was facilitated by a combination of stabilization of energy inputs and a redirection of energy from locomotion, growth and reproduction. The human brain stands out among mammals by being unusually large. The expensive-tissue hypothesis1 explains its evolution by proposing a trade-off between the size of the brain and that of the digestive tract, which is smaller than expected for a primate of our body size. Although this hypothesis is widely accepted, empirical support so far has been equivocal. Here we test it in a sample of 100 mammalian species, including 23 primates, by analysing brain size and organ mass data. We found that, controlling for fat-free body mass, brain size is not negatively correlated with the mass of the digestive tract or any other expensive organ, thus refuting the expensive-tissue hypothesis. Nonetheless, consistent with the existence of energy trade-offs with brain size, we find that the size of brains and adipose depots are negatively correlated in mammals, indicating that encephalization and fat storage are compensatory strategies to buffer against starvation. However, these two strategies can be combined if fat storage does not unduly hamper locomotor efficiency. We propose that human encephalization was made possible by a combination of stabilization of energy inputs and a redirection of energy from locomotion, growth and reproduction."

Among these, members of the let-7 miRNA family control many cell-fate determination genes to influence pluripotency, differentiation, and transformation. Lin28 is a specific, posttranscriptional inhibitor of let-7 biogenesis. We report crystal structures of mouse Lin28 in complex with sequences from let-7d, let-7-f1, and let-7 g precursors. The two folded domains of Lin28 recognize two distinct regions of the RNA and are sufficient for inhibition of let-7 in vivo. We also show by NMR spectroscopy that the linker connecting the two folded domains is flexible, accommodating Lin28 binding to diverse let-7 family members. Protein-RNA complex formation imposes specific conformations on both components that could affect downstream recognition by other processing factors. Our data provide a molecular explanation for Lin28 specificity and a model for how it regulates let-7."
https://openalex.org/W2001963171,"Chronic wound infections are typically polymicrobial; however, most in vivo studies have focused on monospecies infections. This project was designed to develop an in vivo, polymicrobial, biofilm-related, infected wound model in order to study multispecies biofilm dynamics and in relation to wound chronicity. Multispecies biofilms consisting of both Gram negative and Gram positive strains, as well as aerobes and anaerobes, were grown in vitro and then transplanted onto the wounds of mice. These in vitro-to-in vivo multi-species biofilm transplants generated polymicrobial wound infections, which remained heterogeneous with four bacterial species throughout the experiment. We observed that wounded mice given multispecies biofilm infections displayed a wound healing impairment over mice infected with a single-species of bacteria. In addition, the bacteria in the polymicrobial wound infections displayed increased antimicrobial tolerance in comparison to those in single species infections. These data suggest that synergistic interactions between different bacterial species in wounds may contribute to healing delays and/or antibiotic tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2020333671,"Murine epidermal stem cells undergo alternate cycles of dormancy and activation, fuelling tissue renewal. However, only a subset of stem cells becomes active during each round of morphogenesis, indicating that stem cells coexist in heterogeneous responsive states. Using a circadian-clock reporter-mouse model, here we show that the dormant hair-follicle stem cell niche contains coexisting populations of cells at opposite phases of the clock, which are differentially predisposed to respond to homeostatic cues. The core clock protein Bmal1 modulates the expression of stem cell regulatory genes in an oscillatory manner, to create populations that are either predisposed, or less prone, to activation. Disrupting this clock equilibrium, through deletion of Bmal1 (also known as Arntl) or Per1/2, resulted in a progressive accumulation or depletion of dormant stem cells, respectively. Stem cell arrhythmia also led to premature epidermal ageing, and a reduction in the development of squamous tumours. Our results indicate that the circadian clock fine-tunes the temporal behaviour of epidermal stem cells, and that its perturbation affects homeostasis and the predisposition to tumorigenesis."

During locomotion, worms initiate backward movement to change locomotion direction spontaneously or in response to sensory cues; however, the underlying neural circuits are not well defined. We applied a multidisciplinary approach to map neural circuits in freely behaving worms by integrating functional imaging, optogenetic interrogation, genetic manipulation, laser ablation, and electrophysiology. We found that a disinhibitory circuit and a stimulatory circuit together promote initiation of backward movement and that circuitry dynamics is differentially regulated by sensory cues. Both circuits require glutamatergic transmission but depend on distinct glutamate receptors. This dual mode of motor initiation control is found in mammals, suggesting that distantly related organisms with anatomically distinct nervous systems may adopt similar strategies for motor control. Additionally, our studies illustrate how a multidisciplinary approach facilitates dissection of circuit and synaptic mechanisms underlying behavior in a genetic model organism."
https://openalex.org/W2123774383,"Insulin resistance, tissue inflammation, and adipose tissue dysfunction are features of obesity and Type 2 diabetes. We generated adipocyte-specific Nuclear Receptor Corepressor (NCoR) knockout (AKO) mice to investigate the function of NCoR in adipocyte biology, glucose and insulin homeostasis. Despite increased obesity, glucose tolerance was improved in AKO mice, and clamp studies demonstrated enhanced insulin sensitivity in liver, muscle, and fat. Adipose tissue macrophage infiltration and inflammation were also decreased. PPARγ response genes were upregulated in adipose tissue from AKO mice and CDK5-mediated PPARγ ser-273 phosphorylation was reduced, creating a constitutively active PPARγ state. This identifies NCoR as an adaptor protein that enhances the ability of CDK5 to associate with and phosphorylate PPARγ. The dominant function of adipocyte NCoR is to transrepress PPARγ and promote PPARγ ser-273 phosphorylation, such that NCoR deletion leads to adipogenesis, reduced inflammation, and enhanced systemic insulin sensitivity, phenocopying the TZD-treated state."
https://openalex.org/W2002030208,"Transcriptional coregulators control the activity of many transcription factors and are thought to have wide-ranging effects on gene expression patterns. We show here that muscle-specific loss of nuclear receptor corepressor 1 (NCoR1) in mice leads to enhanced exercise endurance due to an increase of both muscle mass and of mitochondrial number and activity. The activation of selected transcription factors that control muscle function, such as MEF2, PPARβ/δ, and ERRs, underpins these phenotypic alterations. NCoR1 levels are decreased in conditions that require fat oxidation, resetting transcriptional programs to boost oxidative metabolism. Knockdown of gei-8, the sole C. elegans NCoR homolog, also robustly increased muscle mitochondria and respiration, suggesting conservation of NCoR1 function. Collectively, our data suggest that NCoR1 plays an adaptive role in muscle physiology and that interference with NCoR1 action could be used to improve muscle function."
https://openalex.org/W2098715150,"Protein phosphorylation provides a mechanism for the rapid, reversible control of protein function. Phosphorylation adds negative charge to amino acid side chains, and negatively charged amino acids (Asp/Glu) can sometimes mimic the phosphorylated state of a protein.

Structures of three proteins where phosphosites evolved from acidic residues (DNA topoisomerase II, enolase, and C-Raf) show that the relevant acidic residues are present in salt bridges with conserved basic residues, and that phosphorylation has the potential to conditionally restore the salt bridges.

Some phosphorylation sites have evolved from acidic residues in primordial proteins The switch from D/E to S/T/Y sometimes happened at the prokaryotic/eukaryotic split The switch sometimes happened later in evolution Phosphorylation may restore salt bridges present in D/E-containing homologs Protein phosphorylation is a ubiquitous mechanism for the temporal and spatial regulation of proteins involved in almost every cellular process. Protein phosphorylation is important in prokaryotes, where the best-characterized kinases catalyze the phosphorylation of histidine residues (Laub and Goulian, 2007Laub M.T. Goulian M. Specificity in two-component signal transduction pathways.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2007; 41: 121-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation appears to be even more important and more widespread in eukaryotic cells, but while histidine phosphorylation does occur in at least some eukaryotes, most eukaryotic protein phosphorylation occurs at serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues (Manning et al., 2002aManning G. Plowman G.D. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. Evolution of protein kinase signaling from yeast to man.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 514-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). The human genome includes about 500 genes for protein kinases that phosphorylate serine, threonine, and/or tyrosine residues (Manning et al., 2002bManning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. The protein kinase complement of the human genome.Science. 2002; 298: 1912-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (5789) Google Scholar) and about 200 genes for phosphoprotein phosphatases that dephosphorylate them (Alonso et al., 2004Alonso A. Sasin J. Bottini N. Friedberg I. Osterman A. Godzik A. Hunter T. Dixon J. Mustelin T. Protein tyrosine phosphatases in the human genome.Cell. 2004; 117: 699-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1435) Google Scholar). Thus, approximately 3.5% of human genes are devoted to proteins that directly regulate protein phosphorylation. The substrates of these kinases and phosphatases are numerous; one commonly cited estimate is that approximately 30% of proteins are phosphorylated (Cohen, 2000Cohen P. The regulation of protein function by multisite phosphorylation–a 25 year update.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 596-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, Holt et al., 2009Holt L.J. Tuch B.B. Villen J. Johnson A.D. Gygi S.P. Morgan D.O. Global analysis of Cdk1 substrate phosphorylation sites provides insights into evolution.Science. 2009; 325: 1682-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Since many phosphoproteins are phosphorylated at multiple sites, there are probably tens of thousands of different phosphorylation sites in the human proteome. This raises the question of how these myriad phosphorylation sites have evolved. One possibility might be that the protein evolved first, with some structurally or functionally important Ser, Thr, or Tyr residue present on the surface of the protein, and that the phosphorylation of this residue evolved later. A strong prediction of this model is that most phosphorylations should negatively regulate protein function, since a fully functional protein is assumed to be present before the phosphorylation has evolved (Figure 1A ). Phosphorylation does sometimes inactivate proteins. For example, phosphorylation of the prokaryotic citric acid cycle enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase blocks the enzyme's active site (Hurley et al., 1990Hurley J.H. Dean A.M. Thorsness P.E. Koshland Jr., D.E. Stroud R.M. Regulation of isocitrate dehydrogenase by phosphorylation involves no long-range conformational change in the free enzyme.J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3599-3602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, Hurley et al., 1989Hurley J.H. Thorsness P.E. Ramalingam V. Helmers N.H. Koshland Jr., D.E. Stroud R.M. Structure of a bacterial enzyme regulated by phosphorylation, isocitrate dehydrogenase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1989; 86: 8635-8639Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), providing a rapid and reversible off-switch for the protein. Another example is the eukaryotic cyclin dependent kinase CDK1, which is inactivated by the Wee1 and Myt1 protein kinases through the phosphorylation of two residues, Thr 14 and Tyr 15, in its catalytic cleft (Morgan, 1995Morgan D.O. Principles of CDK regulation.Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2859) Google Scholar). However, many phosphorylations are activating rather than inactivating. For example, CDK1 activity is positively regulated by the phosphorylation of Thr 161, a residue just outside the catalytic cleft (Brown et al., 1999Brown N.R. Noble M.E. Endicott J.A. Johnson L.N. The structural basis for specificity of substrate and recruitment peptides for cyclin-dependent kinases.Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, Morgan, 1995Morgan D.O. Principles of CDK regulation.Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2859) Google Scholar). It is less intuitive how activating phosphorylations might evolve, since presumably the nonphosphorylated ancestor of the phosphoprotein would be inactive. One possible mechanism is suggested by mutational studies of isocitrate dehydrogenase. Thorsness and Koshland showed that substituting an acidic aspartate residue for the serine phosphorylation site mimicked the phosphorylated state of the protein (Thorsness and Koshland, 1987Thorsness P.E. Koshland Jr., D.E. Inactivation of isocitrate dehydrogenase by phosphorylation is mediated by the negative charge of the phosphate.J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10422-10425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rationale behind this observation is that acidic residues are negatively charged, like pSer, pThr and pTyr (although Glu and Asp are singly charged whereas pSer, pThr, and pTyr are, nominally, doubly charged at physiological pH [Cooper et al., 1983Cooper J.A. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Detection and quantification of phosphotyrosine in proteins.Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 387-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar]), and Asp and Glu are approximately isosteric with pSer and pThr (Figure 1B). This “trick” of substituting Asp or Glu for pSer or pThr turns out to be widely applicable. Although there are examples where two acidic residues are needed to mimic one phosphorylation event (Strickfaden et al., 2007Strickfaden S.C. Winters M.J. Ben-Ari G. Lamson R.E. Tyers M. Pryciak P.M. A mechanism for cell-cycle regulation of MAP kinase signaling in a yeast differentiation pathway.Cell. 2007; 128: 519-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), as well as examples where the activity of the Asp or Glu mutant is more like that of the nonphosphorylated form than the phosphorylated form (Posada and Cooper, 1992Posada J. Cooper J.A. Requirements for phosphorylation of MAP kinase during meiosis in Xenopus oocytes.Science. 1992; 255: 212-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), often the Asp or Glu mutants do faithfully mimic the phosphorylated state. Perhaps nature has been using this same trick in reverse. Imagine that a protein initially evolves with a functionally important glutamate on its surface; for example, in a salt bridge that stabilizes a fold that is necessary for proper function (Figure 1C). A mutation then occurs (perhaps in a nonessential, duplicated gene) and the negatively charged glutamate is replaced by a neutral serine. This destabilizes the salt bridge, rendering the protein inactive. If some kinase is able to phosphorylate the serine, the negatively charged phosphate could reestablish the salt bridge, stabilize the fold, and reactivate the protein. A switchable tyrosine phosphorylation site seems less likely to evolve by this mechanism, since phosphotyrosine is less structurally similar to Glu and Asp than pSer and pThr are, but in cases where net charge is more important than the details of the side chain structure, evolution of a phosphorylated tyrosine from acidic amino acids might be possible. Here, we have examined the sequence record for evidence of the evolution of ancestral glutamate or aspartate residues into phosphorylation sites. Our findings support the idea that some phosphorylation sites—perhaps ∼5% of the sites we have examined—have evolved from acidic residues, and that such sites appeared both at the divergence of eukaryotes from prokaryotes and at subsequent times in evolution. If some phosphosites evolved from acidic amino acids, it might be possible to detect those ancestral origins in homologous proteins that have continued to exist in the unphosphorylatable, acidic form. To test this idea, we asked whether aspartate and glutamate are found at higher rates at the positions of known phosphorylation sites than at sites not known to be phosphorylated. If so, it could mean that phosphosites evolved from Asp/Glu, acidic residues evolved from phosphosites, or both. We created a database of experimentally verified phosphoproteins collected from the literature (Ballif et al., 2004Ballif B.A. Villen J. Beausoleil S.A. Schwartz D. Gygi S.P.

Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar). Because most of the phosphosites were serines (7854 pS, 1688 pT, and 566 pY in our analysis) and we would expect different amino acid substitution rates for serines, threonines, and tyrosines, we initially chose to focus on the subset of phosphoproteins containing verified phosphoserines. For each phosphoprotein we obtained its most closely related homologs using BLAST (Altschul et al., 1990Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. Basic local alignment search tool.J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). We then generated multiple sequence alignments for each phosphoprotein and its homologs using PROBCONS (Do et al., 2005Do C.B. Mahabhashyam M.S. Brudno M. Batzoglou S. ProbCons: Probabilistic consistency-based multiple sequence alignment.Genome Res. 2005; 15: 330-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar), a choice made for its high degree of accuracy rather than speed of alignment (Essoussi et al., 2008Essoussi N. Boujenfa K. Limam M. A comparison of MSA tools.Bioinformation. 2008; 2: 452-455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For some large alignments (more than 100 sequences), memory limitations inherent to PROBCONS made it necessary to use another alignment tool, MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004Edgar R.C. MUSCLE: multiple sequence alignment with high accuracy and high throughput.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1792-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (26244) Google Scholar). MUSCLE is capable of handling larger alignments and also produces high-quality alignments. A sample of this procedure is shown in Figure 2A . The phosphoprotein in this case is the S. cerevisiae enolase Eno1, and the phosphorylation site is Ser 10. The alignment included 233 enolase homologs, some with serines at the position of Ser 10. We then determined the frequencies at which the nineteen other amino acids were found at the position of the phosphoserine (Figure 2A, red column). We compared these frequencies to the frequencies at which amino acids were found at the positions of control serines—serines not known to be phosphorylated—in S. cerevisiae enolase (Figure 2A, black columns). The control serine results are shown by the black bars in Figure 2B. Alanine, a common amino acid that is structurally similar to serine (Dayhoff, 1978Dayhoff M.O. Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure. National Biomedical Research Foundation, Silver Springs M.D.1978Google Scholar), was the most common replacement, whereas tryptophan, a rare amino acid that is structurally dissimilar to serine (Dayhoff, 1978Dayhoff M.O. Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure. National Biomedical Research Foundation, Silver Springs M.D.1978Google Scholar), was the least common (Figure 2B). To see which amino acids were enriched at serine residues relative to their overall abundance in this set of proteins, we divided the replacement percentages plotted in Figure 2B by the abundances of the respective amino acids at all positions in the proteins in our multiple sequence alignments (Figure 2C, black bars). By this measure, Thr, Asn, and Ala were present at the highest relative rates, and isoleucine, leucine, and tryptophan at the lowest (Figure 2C). The red bars in Figures 2B and 2C show the incidence of each amino acid at the positions of the phosphoserines in our dataset. Thr, Glu, and Asp were found more frequently at phosphoserines than at control serines. Bootstrapping yielded low p values for these three enrichments (Figure 2D). The large hydrophobic amino acids, which were underrepresented at the positions of control serines (Figure 2C), were even more underrepresented at phosphoserines (Figure 2D). Another group has also recently shown that Glu and Asp are overrepresented at the positions of phosphoserines relative to control serines (Kurmangaliyev et al., 2011Kurmangaliyev Y.Z. Goland A. Gelfand M.S. Evolutionary patterns of phosphorylated serines.Biol. Direct. 2011; 6: 8Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Glu and Asp are found preferentially on the surfaces rather than the interiors of proteins (Miller et al., 1987Miller S. Janin J. Lesk A.M. Chothia C. Interior and surface of monomeric proteins.J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 641-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar, Tjong et al., 2007Tjong H. Qin S. Zhou H.X. PI2PE: protein interface/interior prediction engine.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35 (W357-362)Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Since phosphoserines might be expected to favor protein surfaces more than control serines do, the enrichment of Asp/Glu residues at phosphoserines versus control serines could simply reflect this shared preference for the surface. If so, then the other amino acids with a strong preference for surface exposure (Lys, Arg, Gln, and Asn) (Miller et al., 1987Miller S. Janin J. Lesk A.M. Chothia C. Interior and surface of monomeric proteins.J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 641-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar, Tjong et al., 2007Tjong H. Qin S. Zhou H.X. PI2PE: protein interface/interior prediction engine.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35 (W357-362)Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar) should be enriched at phosphoserines. However, Lys, Arg, and Gln were less likely to be found at the position of phosphoserines than at control serines, and Asn was not significantly more likely to be found at phosphoserines than at control serines (Figure 2D). Thus the enrichment of acidic residues at phosphosites appears not to be due to a general enrichment of polar or charged residues. The conservation of phosphoserines was higher than that of control serines (43 ± 1% versus 24 ± 0.2%), and the frequency at which gaps were found at the positions of phosphoserines was lower than that of control serines (13 ± 1% versus 30 ± 0.3%). This suggests that phosphoserines are more likely to be critical to the function of a protein than control serines. We next asked whether the overrepresentation of Asp/Glu residues was evenly distributed over all of the phosphoproteins, or arose from a subset of phosphosites with very high replacement frequencies. To address this question we binned our alignments according to the combined Asp+Glu perecentages at the position of phosphoserines or control serines. We carried out this binning on all of the sequence alignments with at least 60 homologs; these alignments contained 234 phosphoserines and 16,198 control serines. The fraction of the alignments with a given Asp/Glu percentage declined approximately exponentially for the control serines. For the phosphoserines (Figure 3A , red) there was a similar decline up until the 50% bin, above which the distribution leveled off. Approximately 6.8% of phosphoserine sites had at least 50% Asp or Glu at their position in the multiple sequence alignments, as opposed to just 1.8% for control serines (p = 4 × 10−6). Thus, there is a group of proteins with a very high frequency of replacement of Glu or Asp for phosphoserines, suggesting that phosphosites evolved from acidic residues (or vice versa) in these protein families. Similar trends were seen when cutoffs of more or less than 60 homologs were used for inclusion in the binning. Thus, approximately 5% more of the bona fide phosphorylation sites had Asp+Glu replacement percentages of >50% than did the control serines. As a further control, we looked for an indication that the high Asp/Glu replacement percentages might be due to the structural similarity of Asp and Glu to pSer rather than the charge similarity. If so, we might expect more phosphosites than control serine sites to have high percentages of Asn+Gln replacement, since Asn and Gln are structurally similar to Asp and Glu. As seen in Figure 3B, we do not find an overabundance of high Asn+Gln replacements percentages at the position of phosphoserines. In fact, only 0.46% of phosphoserines have >50% replacement by Asn or Gln, compared to 0.65% for control serines (p = 0.69). This suggests that it is the acidic nature of Asp and Glu that promoted their evolutionary overrepresentation at the position of phosphoserines. The high frequency at which Asp/Glu residues were found at the positions of phosphoserines suggests that acidic amino acids may have often evolved into phosphosites, or vice versa, during evolution; however, pairwise alignments are insufficient to identify evolutionary events and therefore cannot distinguish these hypotheses from alternatives. Phylogenetic analysis and reconstruction of ancestral sequence states allow the timing and direction of historical sequence changes to be inferred, providing a direct test of our hypothesis. We began by examining the 16 serine-phosphorylated proteins with the highest Asp/Glu replacement percentages; later we extended the analysis to phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine sites with high Asp/Glu replacement percentages as well. Phylogenetic trees were inferred from the multiple sequence alignments using a maximum likelihood method implemented in the software package PhyML (Guindon and Gascuel, 2003Guindon S. Gascuel O. A simple, fast, and accurate algorithm to estimate large phylogenies by maximum likelihood.Syst. Biol. 2003; 52: 696-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (13517) Google Scholar). The leaves of the trees were colored to indicate which amino acid was present in each homolog at the position of the phosphosite. Green denoted the phosphorylatable amino acids Ser, Thr, and Tyr; red denoted the acidic residues Asp and Glu, and gray represented any other amino acid. We used the maximum likelihood trees inferred by PhyML as input to a second maximum likelihood implementation, FASTML (Pupko et al., 2002Pupko T. Pe'er I. Hasegawa M. Graur D. Friedman N. A branch-and-bound algorithm for the inference of ancestral amino-acid sequences when the replacement rate varies among sites: Application to the evolution of five gene families.Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 1116-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), to infer the sequences of the hypothetical ancestral proteins represented by the internal nodes, and colored these nodes according to the amino acid hypothesized to be present at the position of the phosphosite. Most of the 16 trees displayed one of three basic patterns of Ser/Thr/Tyr versus Asp/Glu residues. Examples of each are shown in Figure 4, Figure 5, and Figure 6 and described below.Figure 5Evolution of Phosphorylation Sites from Acidic Residues Later in EvolutionShow full caption(A and B) S. cerevisiae enolase Eno1.

The protein eEF2 is a translation factor required for the translocation step in protein synthesis (Jorgensen et al., 2006Jorgensen R. Merrill A.R. Andersen G.R. The life and death of translation elongation factor 2.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Human eEF2 is reported to be phosphorylated at Ser 502 (Beausoleil et al., 2004Beausoleil S.A. Jedrychowski M. Schwartz D. Elias J.E. Villen J. Li J. Cohn M.A. Cantley L.C. Gygi S.P. Large-scale characterization of HeLa cell nuclear phosphoproteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 12130-12135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar). The functional significance of this phosphorylation is uncertain. The EF2 tree included eukaryotic eEF2 proteins, archaeal aEF2 proteins, and bacterial EF-G proteins (Figure 4A). The amino acids in the vicinity of Ser 502 were well conserved throughout the tree (Figure 4C). The tree was rooted using the related E. coli protein EF4 as an outgroup, which placed the root of the tree between the archaea and the bacteria (Figure 4A), consistent with current views of deep phylogenetics (Ciccarelli et al., 2006Ciccarelli F.D.

Mapping the tree of life: progress and prospects.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2009; 73: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Almost all (27/28) of the eukaryotic eEF2 homologs had a phosphorylatable residue at the position corresponding to Ser 502. Most (211/224) of the bacterial, mitochondrial, and archaeal homologs, had either Asp or Glu at that position. All of the eukaryotic eEF2 proteins with serine residues at the position of Ser 502 appear to have been derived from a single Glu → Ser change at the divergence of eukaryotes from archaea, which has been maintained ever since (Figure 4A). The two eEF2 proteins with Thr residues at the position of Ser 502 may have arisen from an independent Glu → Thr amino acid change (Table S2A available online). DNA topoisomerase II (Topo II) is a conserved enzyme that catalyzes the passage of one DNA duplex through another (Schoeffler and Berger, 2008Schoeffler A.J. Berger J.M. DNA topoisomerases: harnessing and constraining energy to govern chromosome topology.Q. Rev. Biophys. 2008; 41: 41-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic Topo II is a homodimer. Its prokaryotic homolog, gyrase, is an A2B2 tetramer, with gyrase B corresponding to the N-terminal half of eukaryotic Topo II and gyrase A corresponding to the C-terminal half. It has been reported that human topoisomerase IIβ is phosphorylated at Thr 639 and Ser 640 (Figure 4B) (Wang et al., 2010Wang Z. Udeshi N.D. Slawson C. Compton P.D. Sakabe K. Cheung W.D. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Hart G.W. Extensive crosstalk between O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation regulates cytokinesis.Sci. Signal. 2010; 3: ra2Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), with the functional consequences of these phosphorylations unknown. The BLAST search using human Topo IIβ as query yielded sequences including vertebrate topoisomerase IIα and IIβ proteins, other eukaryotic Topo II proteins, and prokaryotic gyrase proteins, with the position of the phosphosite present in the gyrase B chains. The amino acids surrounding the phosphosite were well conserved throughout the tree (Figure 4D). We were unable to identify a satisfactory paralog to use as an outgroup; the rooting shown in Figure 4B is arbitrary. The Topo II tree consisted of two main clades (Figure 4B). The first included the eukaryotic Topo II proteins plus three viral Topo II proteins whose genes were likely to have been transduced from their eukaryotic hosts. The second included all of the bacterial, archaeal, and chloroplastic/mitochondrial Topo II proteins. All of the animal, fungal, plant, and protist Topo II homologs had phosphorylatable Thr and Ser residues at the sites corresponding to Thr 639 and Ser 640, respectively. All of the bacterial, archaeal, and chloroplastic/mitochondrial Topo II homologs had a glutamate residue at the position of Thr 639 and a Met or Ile residue at the position of Ser 640 (Figure 4B). If one assumes that bacteria and archaea diverged before eukaryotes and archaea did (Ciccarelli et al., 2006Ciccarelli F.D. Doerks T. von Mering C. Creevey C.J. Snel B. Bork P.

Integrative strategy for dissecting mammalian signaling networks Strategy identifies factors and pathways controlling TLR signals Polo-like kinases are key regulators of well-established IFN-inducing pathways The kinases activate a signaling branch involving a dozen proteins Signaling networks detect and respond to environmental changes, and defects in their wiring can contribute to diseases. For example, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) sense microbial molecules and trigger signaling pathways critical for host defense (Takeuchi and Akira, 2010Takeuchi O. Akira S. Pattern recognition receptors and inflammation.Cell. 2010; 140: 805-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5704) Google Scholar). Genetic defects in components of the TLR and other pathogen-sensing pathways have been linked to human diseases. Hence, rational targeting of these pathways should help in better manipulating immune responses associated with infections, autoimmunity, and vaccines (Hennessy et al., 2010Hennessy E.J. Parker A.E. O'Neill L.A. Targeting Toll-like receptors: emerging therapeutics?.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2010; 9: 293-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). However, despite extensive studies, many components of TLR and other biological networks are unknown, and many genes associated with disease have not been assigned to a function or a pathway. A key challenge is thus to systemically dissect mammalian signaling networks, by determining the functions of their components and placing them within pathways. Previously, we introduced an integrated experimental and computational approach to decipher the TLR transcriptional network of immune dendritic cells (DCs) (Amit et al., 2009Amit I. Garber M. Chevrier N. Leite A.P. Donner Y. Eisenhaure T. Guttman M. Grenier J.K. Li W. Zuk O. et al.Unbiased reconstruction of a mammalian transcriptional network mediating pathogen responses.Science. 2009; 326: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), allowing us to identify transcriptional regulators and to define their impact on TLR responses in DCs. For example, we found a host of cell-cyle regulators—Rbl1, Rb, Myc, Jun, and E2fs—that are required for antiviral transcriptional responses in nondividing DCs. Here, we adapt and expand this approach to the discovery and validation of TLR signaling components in DCs (Figure S1 available online). First, to identify candidate components, we rely on transcriptional feedbacks, whereby a signaling circuit regulates the transcript levels of genes encoding some, but not all, of its components (Amit et al., 2007Amit I. Citri A. Shay T. Lu Y. Katz M. Zhang F. Tarcic G. Siwak D. Lahad J. Jacob-Hirsch J. et al.A module of negative feedback regulators defines growth factor signaling.Nat.

Feedback control of intercellular signalling in development.Nature. 2000; 408: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Second, we perturb these candidates with shRNAs and measure the effects on a representative signature of >100 TLR-activated genes. Third, we use functional phosphoproteomics to expand the pathway's scope to components whose mRNA levels may be unchanged upon TLR activation. Applying this approach iteratively, we discovered 19 functional components, including a signaling arm mediated by two Polo-like kinases (Plk2 and 4) that participate in regulating well-established host antiviral pathways. To identify candidate components of pathogen-sensing pathways, we used genome-wide mRNA profiles, previously measured at 10 time points along 24 hr following stimulation of primary bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; TLR4 agonist), polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C); recognized by TLR3 and the cytosolic viral sensor MDA-5), or Pam3CSK4 (PAM; TLR2 agonist) (Amit et al., 2009Amit I. Garber M. Chevrier N. Leite A.P. Donner Y. Eisenhaure T. Guttman M. Grenier J.K. Li W. Zuk O. et al.Unbiased reconstruction of a mammalian transcriptional network mediating pathogen responses.Science. 2009; 326: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). These three TLRs activate transcriptional programs referred to here as “inflammatory” (TLR2), “antiviral” (TLR3), or both (TLR4) (Figure 1A ) (Amit et al., 2009Amit I. Garber M. Chevrier N. Leite A.P. Donner Y. Eisenhaure T. Guttman M. Grenier J.K. Li W. Zuk O. et al.Unbiased reconstruction of a mammalian transcriptional network mediating pathogen responses.Science. 2009; 326: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, Doyle et al., 2002Doyle S.

IRF3 mediates a TLR3/TLR4-specific antiviral gene program.Immunity. 2002; 17: 251-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Our analysis uncovered 280 genes annotated as known or putative signaling molecules that were differentially expressed following stimulation: 115 kinases, 69 phosphatases, and 96 other regulators, such as adaptors and scaffolds (Figure 1B, Table S1, and Experimental Procedures). These 280 genes were enriched for canonical pathways of the TLR network such as MAP kinase (p < 1.22 × 10−15, overlap 25/87, hypergeometric test), TLR (e.g., Myd88, Traf6, Irak4, Tbk1; p < 8.43 × 10−12, 21/86), and PI3K (p < 2.58 × 10−8, 11/33) pathways, as well as the PYK2 pathway (p < 3.12 × 10−10, 12/29), which was recently associated with the TLR system (Wang et al., 2010Wang L. Gordon R.A. Huynh L. Su X. Park Min K.H. Han J. Arthur J.S. Kalliolias G.D. Ivashkiv L.B. Indirect inhibition of Toll-like receptor and type I interferon responses by ITAM-coupled receptors and integrins.Immunity. 2010; 32: 518-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Overall, 94 of the 280 genes (33%) were associated with the TLR network in the literature (Table S1), supporting the validity of our candidate selection strategy. The remaining 186 genes (67%) represent candidate TLR components. To test their putative function in TLR signaling, we selected a subset of 23 candidates based on their strong differential expression and to proportionally represent the five main induced expression clusters (Figures 1B and 1C). We also selected six canonical TLR components (Myd88, Mapk9, Tbk1, Ikbke, Tank, and Map3k7) as benchmarks (Figures 1A and 1D). We perturbed our 6 positive controls and 17 of the 23 candidates in BMDCs using shRNA-encoding lentiviruses (6 candidates showed poor knockdown efficiency) (Table S1). We stimulated the cells with LPS and used a multiplex mRNA counting method to measure the effect of gene silencing on the mRNA levels of 118 TLR response signature genes, representing the inflammatory and antiviral programs (Figure 2A ). Notably, the expression of the 118 genes was not affected in BMDCs transduced with lentivirus compared to untransduced cells (Amit et al., 2009Amit I. Garber M. Chevrier N. Leite A.P. Donner Y. Eisenhaure T. Guttman M. Grenier J.K. Li W. Zuk O. et al.Unbiased reconstruction of a mammalian transcriptional network mediating pathogen responses.Science. 2009; 326: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). We determined statistically significant changes in the expression of signature transcripts upon individual knockdowns based on comparison to 10 control genes, whose expression remains unchanged upon TLR activation, and to control shRNAs (Experimental Procedures). Finally, we associated signaling molecules and downstream transcriptional regulators that may act in the same pathway by comparing the perturbational profiles of the 23 signaling molecules (6 canonical and 17 candidates) to each other and to those of the 123 transcriptional regulators (including transcription and chromatin factors and RNA-binding proteins) previously tested (Figures 2 and S2 and Table S2) (Amit et al., 2009Amit I. Garber M. Chevrier N. Leite A.P. Donner Y. Eisenhaure T. Guttman M. Grenier J.K. Li W. Zuk O. et al.Unbiased reconstruction of a mammalian transcriptional network mediating pathogen responses.Science. 2009; 326: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Perturbing 5 of the 6 canonical signaling molecules strongly affected the expression of TLR signature genes, consistent with their known roles (Figure 2A and Table S2) and validating our approach. For example, perturbing Myd88, a known inflammatory adaptor, specifically abrogated the transcription of inflammatory genes (e.g., Cxcl1, Il1a, Il1b, Ptgs2, Tnf; Figure 2A), similar to perturbations of downstream inflammatory transcription factors (e.g., Nfkb1, Nfkbiz; Figure 2B). In addition, Tank acted as a negative regulator of a subset of antiviral genes (Figure 2A), as expected (Kawagoe et al., 2009Kawagoe T. Takeuchi O. Takabatake Y. Kato H. Isaka Y. Tsujimura T. Akira S. TANK is a negative regulator of Toll-like receptor signaling and is critical for the prevention of autoimmune nephritis.Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and Tbk1 knockdown affected both antiviral and inflammatory outputs (Figure 2A), consistent with findings that Tbk1 regulates NF-κB complexes (Barbie et al., 2009Barbie D.A. Tamayo P. Boehm J.S. Kim S.Y. Moody S.E. Dunn I.F. Schinzel A.C. Sandy P. Meylan E. Scholl C. et al.Systematic RNA interference reveals that oncogenic KRAS-driven cancers require TBK1.Nature. 2009; 462: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar, Chien et al., 2006Chien Y. Kim S. Bumeister R. Loo Y.M. Kwon S.W. Johnson C.L. Balakireva M.G. Romeo Y. Kopelovich L. Gale Jr., M. et al.RalB GTPase-mediated activation of the IkappaB family kinase TBK1 couples innate immune signaling to tumor cell survival.Cell. 2006; 127: 157-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Notably, Ikbke (IKK-ε) knockdown did not affect our gene signature, consistent with previous observations that IKK-ε−/− DCs respond normally to LPS and viral challenges (Matsui et al., 2006Matsui K. Kumagai Y. Kato H. Sato S. Kawagoe T. Uematsu S. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Cutting edge: Role of TANK-binding kinase 1 and inducible IkappaB kinase in IFN responses against viruses in innate immune cells.J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 5785-5789PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, IKK-ε may be either not functional or redundant in our system. All of the 17 candidate signaling molecules tested, except Plk2 (discussed below), affected at least 6 of the 118 genes (on average, 16.6 targets ± 10.4 standard deviation [SD]), and 12 affected more than 10% of the genes (Figures S2A and S2D ). Notably, perturbations of these 17 candidates did not affect BMDC differentiation (88.3% ± 6.8% SD of CD11c+ cells; Table S1). These effects are comparable to those of known signaling molecules and transcriptional regulators in this system (Figures S2B–S2E). For example, the receptor tyrosine kinase Met, not previously associated with TLR signaling, affected a number of signature genes similar to Tbk1 (Figures S2C and S2D), in both the inflammatory and antiviral programs (Figure 2A). Conversely, both the phosphatase Ptpre and the adaptor Socs6 positively regulated the inflammatory program, although negatively regulating some antiviral genes (Figure 2B). Of the 17 candidates tested when we originally conducted this screen, 10 have subsequently been reported in other studies as functional in the TLR system (Table S1), providing an independent confirmation. For example, here Map3k8 knockdown affected both inflammatory and antiviral target genes (Figure 2A), consistent with its reported role in the TLR pathways based on Sluggish mice (Xiao et al., 2009Xiao N. Eidenschenk C. Krebs P. Brandl K. Blasius A.L. Xia Y. Khovananth K. Smart N.G. Beutler B. The Tpl2 mutation Sluggish impairs type I IFN production and increases susceptibility to group B streptococcal disease.J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 7975-7983Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We identified both primary (e.g., Myd88) and secondary (e.g., Stat1) mediators of TLR responses. Although secondary mediators are not part of the initial intracellular signaling cascade, they are important physiological components of the TLR response, and their pertubation can lead to phenotypic outcomes similar to those of primary components. For example, the receptor tyrosine kinase Mertk acted as both a positive and negative regulator of some inflammatory and antiviral genes (e.g., Ifnb1), respectively (Figure 2A), consistent with its reported role as a secondary inhibitor of the TLR pathways (Rothlin et al., 2007Rothlin C.V. Ghosh S. Zuniga E.I. Oldstone M.B. Lemke G. TAM receptors are pleiotropic inhibitors of the innate immune response.Cell. 2007; 131: 1124-1136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Among the 17 candidate signaling proteins, perturbation of the tyrosine kinase adaptor Crkl decreased expression of 13% of the signature genes, especially antiviral ones (Figures 2A and S2D). Crkl belongs to several signaling pathways, including early lymphocyte activation (Birge et al., 2009Birge R.B. Kalodimos C. Inagaki F. Tanaka S. Crk and CrkL adaptor proteins: networks for physiological and pathological signaling.Cell Commun. Signal. 2009; 7: 13Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), but has not been associated with the TLR network. Crkl's perturbation profile closely resembled those of known antiviral regulators, most notably Jnk2 (Mapk9; Chu et al., 1999Chu W.M. Ostertag D. Li Z.W. Chang L. Chen Y. Hu Y. Williams B. Perrault J. Karin M. JNK2 and IKKbeta are required for activating the innate response to viral infection.Immunity. 1999; 11: 721-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) (Figures 2A and 3A). Indeed, when Crkl−/− DCs were stimulated with LPS, the expression of antiviral cytokines (Cxcl10, Ifnb1) was strongly reduced (Figure 3B, left and middle), but that of an inflammatory cytokine (Cxcl1) was unaffected (Figure 3B, right). To test whether Crkl is a primary component of the TLR pathway, we determined whether Crkl phosphorylation is rapidly modified after TLR signaling initiation. Using SILAC-based (Ong et al., 2002Ong S.E. Blagoev B. Kratchmarova I. Kristensen D.B. Steen H. Pandey A. Mann M.

Proteomics. 2002; 1: 376-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (4569) Google Scholar) quantitative phosphoproteomics, we identified and quantified 62 phosphotyrosine (pTyr)-containing peptides from BMDCs stimulated with LPS for 30 min (Figure 3C, Table S3, and Experimental Procedures). Of these 62 phosphopeptides, 7 and 9 were significantly up- or downregulated, respectively (Figure 3C and Table S3). A phosphopeptide derived from Crkl (Y132)—one of the top 6 induced phosphopeptides—was induced 2.1-fold (Figure 3C). This indicates that Crkl is likely activated directly downstream of TLR4 signaling. Several lines of evidence suggest that Crkl acts through Jnk2 (Mapk9) signaling. First, the MAP kinase Jnk2 (Mapk9) is coregulated at the phosphorylation level with Crkl upon LPS stimulation (Figure 3C). Second, the Crk adaptor family—including CrkI, CrkII, and Crkl—has been shown to modulate Jnk activity in growth factor and IFN signaling (Birge et al., 2009Birge R.B. Kalodimos C. Inagaki F.

Microbiol. 2010; 12: 831-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Third, the perturbation profiles of Mapk9 and Crkl are strikingly similar (Figure 3A). These observations suggest that Crkl modulates Jnk-mediated antiviral signaling in the TLR4 pathway, providing a possible explanation for why the NS1 protein of influenza A virus may target Crkl (Heikkinen et al., 2008Heikkinen L.S.

To discover potential drug targets among our 17 candidates, we next focused on Plk2, a well-known cell-cycle regulator and drug target (Strebhardt, 2010Strebhardt K. Multifaceted polo-like kinases: drug targets and antitargets for cancer therapy.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2010; 9: 643-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). The roles of Plks in nondividing, differentiated cells are poorly defined (Archambault and Glover, 2009Archambault V. Glover D.M.

Multifaceted polo-like kinases: drug targets and antitargets for cancer therapy.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2010; 9: 643-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that transcriptional regulators of cell-cycle processes (e.g., Rbl1, Rb, Myc, Jun, E2fs) are co-opted to function in the antiviral responses in DCs (Amit et al., 2009Amit I. Garber M. Chevrier N. Leite A.P. Donner Y. Eisenhaure T. Guttman M. Grenier J.K. Li W. Zuk O. et al.Unbiased reconstruction of a mammalian transcriptional network mediating pathogen responses.Science. 2009; 326: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). However, neither knockdown (Figure 2A) nor knockout (Figure S3A ) of Plk2 in BMDCs had any effect on the TLR response. We hypothesized that this could be due to functional redundancy with another Plk, as Plk4 mRNA was induced in DCs similarly to Plk2 (Figure 4A ), albeit at a lower amplitude (and thus was below our threshold for inclusion in the initial candidate list). Interestingly, functional redundancy between Plk2 and 4 has been suggested to account for the viability of Plk2-deficient mice (Strebhardt, 2010Strebhardt K. Multifaceted polo-like kinases: drug targets and antitargets for cancer therapy.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2010; 9: 643-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar), and Plk2 and 4 have been reported to function together in centriole duplication (Chang et al., 2010Chang J. Cizmecioglu O.

Error bars represent the SEM. See also Figures S3 and S4 and Table S4. To test our hypothesis, we simultaneously perturbed Plk2 and 4 in BMDCs using two independent mixes of different pairs of shPlk2/shPlk4 (Figure S3B and Experimental Procedures). We observed a significant and specific decrease in the expression of 21 antiviral genes (Figure 4B). For example, the antiviral cytokines Ifnb1 and Cxcl10 mRNAs were decreased, whereas the expression of the inflammatory gene Cxcl1 and almost all inflammatory signature genes remained unaffected (Figure 4C). Two recent reports suggested a role for Plk1 alone as a negative regulator of MAVS (Vitour et al., 2009Vitour D. Dabo S. Ahmadi Pour M. Vilasco M. Vidalain P.O. Jacob Y. Mezel-Lemoine M. Paz S. Arguello M. Lin R. et al.Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) regulates interferon (IFN) induction by MAVS.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 21797-21809Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and NF-κB (Zhang et al., 2010Zhang W. Wang J. Zhang Y. Yuan Y. Guan W. Jin C. Chen H. Wang X. Yang X. He F. The scaffold protein TANK/I-TRAF inhibits NF-kappaB activation by recruiting polo-like kinase 1.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 2500-2513Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) in cell lines. However, knockdown of either Plk1 or 3 in BMDCs did not affect the TLR transcriptional response (Figure S3C and Table S2). Notably, BMDC viability was unaffected by lentiviral shRNA transduction targeting Plk1, 2, 3, or 4 individually or Plk2 and 4 together (based on mRNA levels of control genes; Table S2). Thus, in BMDCs, Plk2 and 4, but likely not Plk1 or 3, are critical regulators of antiviral but not cell-cycle pathways. We next targeted Plks in BMDCs using BI 2536, a commercial pan-specific Plk small-molecule inhibitor (Steegmaier et al., 2007Steegmaier, M., Hoffmann, M., Baum, A., Lénárt, P., Petronczki, M., Krssák, M., Gürtler, U., Garin-Chesa, P., Lieb, S., Quant, J., et al. (2007). BI 2536, a potent and selective inhibitor of polo-like kinase 1, inhibits tumor growth in vivo. Curr. Biol. 17, 316–322.Google Scholar). We compared genome-wide mRNA profiles from BMDCs treated with either BI 2536 or DMSO vehicle before stimulation with LPS or poly(I:C) (Experimental Procedures). BI 2536 treatment repressed mostly antiviral gene expression compared to DMSO (99/193 genes in response to poly(I:C), p < 1 × 10−71, hypergeometric test; 67/194 in response to LPS; Table S4). The 311 unique LPS- and/or poly(I:C)-induced genes that are repressed by BI 2536 are significantly enriched for genes related to cytokine signaling (e.g., IL-10, type I IFNs, IL-1), TLR signaling, and DC signaling and for gene ontology (GO) processes related to defense and immune responses (Figure S4A ). Consistent with the array data, BI 2536 strongly inhibited the expression of 12 well-studied antiviral genes, whereas inflammatory gene expression remained largely unaffected in DCs stimulated with LPS, poly(I:C), or Pam3CSK4, as measured by qPCR (Figure 4D). BI 2536 reduced the mRNA levels of Cxcl10 and Ifnb1 (by qPCR) and of secreted IFN-β in a dose-dependent manner, whereas Cxcl1 expression was not significantly affected (Figures S4B and S4C). Importantly, BI 2536 treatment prestimulation impacted neither the viability nor the cell-cycle state of BMDCs (Figures S4D and S4E), suggesting that Plk inhibition does not act through cell-cycle effects. Consistent with our shRNA and BI 2536 perturbations, two other pan-Plk inhibitors—structurally unrelated to BI 2536—also repressed Ifnb1 and Cxcl10 expression without affecting Cxcl1 (Figure S4F). This strongly suggests that the effects induced by these perturbations are due to Plk inhibition and not off-target effects. Furthermore, we observed a similar inhibitory effect of BI 2536 on Ifnb1 induction in Ifnar1−/− and wild-type BMDCs, demonstrating that Plks act directly downstream of TLR activation and not in an autocrine/paracrine feedback loop mediated by IFN receptor signaling (Figure S4G). This is consistent with a recent phosphoproteomic study reporting an enrichment for Plk substrates as early as 15 min after LPS stimulation in macrophages (Weintz et al., 2010Weintz G. Olsen J.V. Frühauf K. Niedzielska M. Amit I. Jantsch J. Mages J. Frech C. Dölken L. Mann M. Lang R. The phosphoproteome of toll-like receptor-activated macrophages.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2010; 6: 371Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We next used confocal microscopy to monitor the effect of BI 2536 on the subcellular localization of IRF3, a key antiviral transcription factor. To more effectively deliver the drug, we plated BMDCs on vertical silicon nanowires (Shalek et al., 2010Shalek A.K. Robinson J.T. Karp E.S. Lee J.S. Ahn D.R. Yoon M.H. Sutton A. Jorgolli M. Gertner R.S. Gujral T.S. et al.Vertical silicon nanowires as a universal platform for delivering biomolecules into living cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 1870-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar) precoated with BI 2536 prestimulation. Nanowires alone had no effect on the TLR response (Figures 5A and S5A). BI 2536 inhibited IRF3 nuclear translocation in a dose-dependent manner upon poly(I:C) or LPS stimulation, whereas the control JNK inhibitor SP 600125 had no effect (Figures 5B, 5C, and S5B). On the other hand, BI 2536 did not aff"

The primary motor cortex is a critical node in the network of brain regions responsible for voluntary motor behavior. It has been less appreciated, however, that the motor cortex exhibits sensory responses in a variety of modalities including vision and somatosensation. We review current work that emphasizes the heterogeneity in sensorimotor responses in the motor cortex and focus on its implications for cortical control of movement as well as for brain-machine interface development. A curious observer outside of the field of motor neurophysiology might think that everything there is to know about the primary motor cortex (MI) has been learned. After all, MI is one of the earliest cortical structures to be functionally studied beginning with the electrical stimulation experiments of Fritz and Hitzig in the late 1800s (Fritsch and Hitzig, 1870Fritsch G. Hitzig E. Uber die elektrische Erregbarkeit des Grosshirns.Arch. Anat. Physiol. Wiss. Med. 1870; 37: 300-332Google Scholar). Motor cortical neurons have been designated historically as “upper motor neurons,” implying that they are perhaps one synapse away from the motor neurons in the spinal cord that activate muscles (Kandel et al., 2000Kandel E.R. Schwartz J.H. Jessell T.M. Principles of Neural Science.Fourth Edition. McGraw-Hill, Health Professions Division, New York2000Google Scholar). So, according to this viewpoint, MI can't be any more complex or interesting than muscle drivers sitting in the brain instead of in the spinal cord. As it turns out, however, the motor cortex is not so simple and its function remains elusive. First of all, despite extensive experimental and theoretical efforts for over fifty years, the exact computational and representational role played by the motor cortex remains unclear. Moreover, a number of recent studies have documented interesting sensory or sensory-triggered responses in the motor cortex that may require us to revise our understanding of the functional role of the motor cortex. The use of the term “primary motor cortex” to define Brodmann area 4 is a designation that comes from the fact that movement can be most easily elicited through electrical stimulation of this area (Penfield and Boldrey, 1937Penfield W. Boldrey E. Somatic motor and sensory representation in the cerebral cortex of man as studied by electrical stimulation.Brain. 1937; 60: 389-443Crossref Scopus (2441) Google Scholar). Moreover, it is known that approximately 30% to 50% of corticospinal projections originate from MI (Porter and Lemon, 1993Porter R. Lemon R. Corticospinal Function and Voluntary Movement. Clarendon Press, Oxford1993Google Scholar). In addition, MI neurons typically begin modulating their firing rate up to several hundred milliseconds before a movement of the limb is initiated (Georgopoulos et al., 1982Georgopoulos A.P. Kalaska J.F. Caminiti R. Massey J.T. On the relations between the direction of two-dimensional arm movements and cell discharge in primate motor cortex.J. Neurosci. 1982; 2: 1527-1537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is reasonable to consider this cortical structure as a primary motor area. However, this designation can obscure the fact that MI exhibits sensory responses and is part of a set of complex circuits that not only controls movement but also receives sensory inputs from the periphery. In the same vein, the designation of somatosensory cortex conceals the fact that this cortical structure also contributes to motor control as is evident in recent findings that the mouse barrel field controls retraction of the whiskers (Matyas et al., 2010Matyas F. Sreenivasan V. Marbach F. Wacongne C. Barsy B. Mateo C. Aronoff R. Petersen C.C. Motor control by sensory cortex.Science. 2010; 330: 1240-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In this review, we present recent experimental data demonstrating a rich heterogeneity in MI response properties including strong visual and somatosensory effects and describe implications of these effects on encoding models of MI as well as their utility for augmenting brain-machine interface control. Research over the past half-century has attempted to understand what features of movement are encoded by individual MI neurons. Typically, these studies have developed models that capture the relationship between the firing rate of a neuron and the value of some kinematic, kinetic, or muscle variable. Although relationships have been documented with nearly every possible variable including force and torque (Cabel et al., 2001Cabel D.W. Cisek P. Scott S.H.

A canonical model has emerged in the literature that linearly relates neuronal firing rate with velocity (i.e., speed and direction) (Moran and Schwartz, 1999Moran D.W. Schwartz A.B. Motor cortical representation of speed and direction during reaching.J. Neurophysiol. 1999; 82: 2676-2692PubMed Google Scholar):μ(t)=a+B⇀⋅V⇀(t+τ)(1) where μ(t) is the average firing rate, a is the baseline firing rate, B⇀ captures the preferred direction (i.e., the direction at which the cell's firing rate is maximum) of the cell, V⇀(t) is the instantaneous velocity of the hand at time t, and τ is the delay between MI modulation and the kinematics. Typically, this delay parameter is estimated to be approximately 100 to 150 ms (Ashe and Georgopoulos, 1994Ashe J. Georgopoulos A.P.

A number of recent studies, however, have shown that the preferred direction (PD) of a cell is highly context dependent, varying in orientation depending on the posture of the arm (Scott and Kalaska, 1995Scott S.H. Kalaska J.F. Changes in motor cortex activity during reaching movements with similar hand paths but different arm postures.J.

Evidence against a single coordinate system representation in the motor cortex.Exp. Brain Res. 2006; 175: 197-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). More strikingly, PDs can even vary in time over the course of a simple reaching movement (Churchland and Shenoy, 2007Churchland M.M. Shenoy K.V.

Sergio and Kalaska (Sergio et al., 2005Sergio L.E. Hamel-Pâquet C. Kalaska J.F. Motor cortex neural correlates of output kinematics and kinetics during isometric-force and arm-reaching tasks.J. Neurophysiol. 2005; 94: 2353-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) compared the tuning properties of MI neurons while monkeys performed nearly identical tasks under either isometric or movement conditions. In the isometric condition, monkeys were trained to exert forces on a transducer to move a cursor from a center target to one of eight peripherally positioned targets, while, in the movement condition, the monkeys moved the end of a manipulandum to guide the cursor to each of the eight targets. Although PDs remained temporally stable under the isometric condition, the authors observed dramatic shifts in PD orientation in time under the movement condition. Churchland and Shenoy (Churchland and Shenoy, 2007Churchland M.M. Shenoy K.V. Temporal complexity and heterogeneity of single-neuron activity in premotor and motor cortex.J. Neurophysiol. 2007; 97: 4235-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) found similar temporal shifts in preferred direction when monkeys performed reaches to targets in the vertical plane in different directions and distances and under two different instructed speeds. Moreover, they observed a rich heterogeneity and complexity in temporal response properties among the population of recorded neurons that could not be accounted for with just the canonical model (Equation 1). In fact, there were many cases where neurons exhibited unique temporal firing profiles that were not shared by any other neuron in their population. The authors put forth the possibility that this heterogeneity and complexity may serve as a rich basis set to represent a variety of different movement parameters, However, they favored an alternate and intriguing idea that the motor cortex may actually not be specifically encoding any particular feature of movement (Wu and Hatsopoulos, 2006Wu W. Hatsopoulos N. Evidence against a single coordinate system representation in the motor cortex.Exp. Brain Res. 2006; 175: 197-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Instead, the heterogeneity and temporal complexity of observed responses is simply the consequence of a recurrent network that is attempting to provide signals to the spinal cord to control movement. Output neurons that form the corticospinal tract represent a subset of a much higher-dimensional, dynamical system of neurons that may not clearly represent anything but rather serve to shape the appropriate temporal responses of the output neurons. We have recently put forth a model that attempts to capture the heterogeneity of motor cortical responses (Hatsopoulos et al., 2007Hatsopoulos N.G. Xu Q. Amit Y. Encoding of movement fragments in the motor cortex.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 5105-5114Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This model suggests that MI represents a rich set of movement fragments that is more in line with the basis set idea described by Churchland and Shenoy (Churchland and Shenoy, 2007Churchland M.M.

The model begins with the observation that the PDs vary not only in absolute time (i.e., over the course of a movement) but also in relative time (i.e., relative to the observed neural modulation). Instead of postulating that the motor cortex encodes a parameter of motion such as direction and speed at a fixed time lag as in Equation 1, we have suggested that MI neurons are tuned to direction at multiple time leads and lags relative to the time of the measured firing rate and that these preferred directions can vary sometimes substantially at these different time delays. More relevant to this review, we have found that MI neurons have preferred directions at negative time lags suggestive of “sensory” as well as “motor” tuning (Figure 1A ). By vectorally adding these preferred directions, we argued that individual neurons are tuned to complex movement fragments or trajectories (Figure 1B). This led us to build a generalized linear encoding model where MI neurons are tuned to velocity trajectories measured at multiple time lags including negative, sensory, and positive motor influences on MI activity (Hatsopoulos et al., 2007Hatsopoulos N.G. Xu Q. Amit Y. Encoding of movement fragments in the motor cortex.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 5105-5114Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar):logμ(t)=a+∑iB⇀i⋅V⇀(t+τi)(2) Notice the logarithm transform on the mean rate of the neuron, which ensures that the rate cannot be negative. Using constrained movements in the horizontal plane, we found that more of the variability of MI activity could be captured if we assumed neurons were tuned to velocity trajectories that extended 400 ms in duration, 100 ms prior to neural activity, and 300 ms following neural activity. By temporally integrating these preferred velocity trajectories, a preferred movement fragment or “pathlet” can be constructed that possesses both a sensory and a motor component (Figure 1C). Over a population of simultaneously recorded MI neurons, we observed a heterogeneous set of pathlets with complex and unique shapes (Figure 1D). More recently, we have provided further support for fragment encoding in MI during natural grasping behavior (Saleh et al., 2010Saleh M. Takahashi K. Amit Y. Hatsopoulos N.G. Encoding of coordinated grasp trajectories in primary motor cortex.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 17079-17090Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In particular, we demonstrated that MI neural modulation can be more accurately predicted if we assume that individual neurons encode joint angle and angular velocity trajectories involving the fingers and wrist. These temporally extensive trajectories express both “sensory” aspects of movement preceding the neuron's response by up to 164 ms in the past as well as “motoric” features of the movement following neural activity extending up to 200 ms into the future. Similar sensory and motor properties have been documented even at the level of muscles (Pruszynski et al., 2010Pruszynski J.A. Lillicrap T.P. Scott S.H. Complex spatiotemporal tuning in human upper-limb muscles.J. Neurophysiol. 2010; 103: 564-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Instead of resorting to an explicit encoding model, one can quantify the sensorimotor relationships between motor cortical modulation and movement using information theory. In particular, mutual information can capture nonlinear as well as linear relationships between these two variables (Cover and Thomas, 1991Cover T. Thomas J. Elements of Information Theory. John Wiley and Sons, New York1991Crossref Google Scholar). By shifting the relative timing between the spike train and the movement, the strength of the peak mutual information as well as the relative time at which the peak occurs can provide clues as to whether the coded information is “motoric” or “sensory” in nature. In simple terms, mutual information quantifies the reduction of uncertainty in one variable given the value of a second variable. For example, if a monkey can move in one of eight possible directions (i.e., 3 bits of uncertainty), and the measured firing rate of a neuron reduces the uncertainty to only two directions (i.e., 1 bit of uncertainty), the mutual information between direction and the firing rate of the neuron is 2 bits (i.e., 3 − 1 = 2). The mutual information between the instantaneous direction of limb movement and the firing rate of an MI neuron measured at multiple relative time lags can capture the degree of directional tuning as well as the relative timing at which these two variables are most related. It is typically observed that MI firing is most strongly correlated with movement direction of the arm when neural activity is leading movement by approximately 100 to 150 ms as is evident in the peak in the information profile at a positive time lag (Figure 2, top panel) (Ashe and Georgopoulos, 1994Ashe J.

This lag time is perhaps not surprising given the axonal, synaptic, inertial, and muscle recruitment delays between the cortex and the limb. However, what is perhaps less expected is the existence of a peak at a negative time lag in some MI neurons indicating that movement direction is also providing information about neural activity in the future suggestive of a sensory as well as a motor response in MI (Figure 2, bottom panel). This begs the question as to what role these sensory-like responses are playing. Are these sensory responses assisting in the sensory guidance of movement? Or perhaps, MI plays a fundamental role in kinesthetic perception together with the somatosensory cortex. In fact, surface electrical stimulation of the precentral cortex can evoke sensory percepts in human patients undergoing neurosurgical procedures (Nii et al., 1996Nii Y. Uematsu S. Lesser R.P.

Evidence over the past twenty years has demonstrated that many neurons in premotor cortices discharge similarly in response to overt motor performance and the observation of the same motor action. Rizzolatti and colleagues first documented the existence of these so-called “mirror” neurons in the ventral premotor cortex of nonhuman primates (di Pellegrino et al., 1992di Pellegrino G. Fadiga L.

Premotor cortex and the recognition of motor actions.Brain Res. Cogn. Brain Res. 1996; 3: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (3033) Google Scholar). Cisek and Kalaska observed a similar phenomenon in dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) when monkeys moved a visual cursor to one of eight peripherally positioned targets displayed on a computer monitor in front of them with their unseen arm or observed cursor movements made by an unseen experimenter (Cisek and Kalaska, 2004Cisek P. Kalaska J.F. Neural correlates of mental rehearsal in dorsal premotor cortex.Nature. 2004; 431: 993-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Two colored targets appeared briefly to cue possible movements and the correct movement was subsequently identified by a color cue. Monkeys were trained to reach to the peripheral target indicated by the color cue at the presentation of a go signal. Behavioral evidence demonstrated that the animals engaged in mental rehearsal during the observation of action as the experimenters found that the monkey usually made saccades to the correct target before reaching or observing cursor motion. Furthermore, the spiking activity recorded from PMd neurons exhibited the same pattern of modulation during active performance and observation even during a delay period before movement had begun. Based on the dense cortico-cortico connections between MI and these premotor areas (Dum and Strick, 1991Dum R.P. Strick P.L.

Recent experiments from our lab have demonstrated that many neurons in MI discharge similarly during action and action observation much the same way as neurons in dorsal and ventral premotor cortices (Suminski et al., 2009Suminski A.J.

Monkeys were trained to perform planar movements in order to move a cursor to randomly positioned targets presented visually on a horizontal screen. During active performance the cursor's position was dictated by the endpoint of a two-link exoskeletal robot moved by the monkey's arm. The cursor movements and accompanying targets were recorded and subsequently replayed to the animal during the observation phase providing the same visual stimulation as active performance. We required the monkeys to voluntarily maintain the position of their arm in a fixed posture during observation to eliminate the effects of arm movements on the neural activity measured in MI. We found a tremendous amount of heterogeneity when examining the responses of individual neurons during active performance and observation. The firing rate profiles of some neurons exhibited noticeable differences under the two conditions (Figure 3A ) while others modulated similarly in the two tasks (Figure 3B). Most surprising was a group of cells whose firing rate was modulated during action observation but did not discharge in response to active movement of the limb (Figure 3C). While some neurons exhibited significant mutual information between spiking activity and cursor direction during active performance but not during observation (Figure 3D), a number of neurons showed significant mutual information during observation (Figure 3E), and, in some cases, there was significant mutual information only during observation (Figure 3F). This analysis provided evidence that MI may be a member of this putative “mirror” neuron system. Mutual information estimates indicated that neural modulati"

https://openalex.org/W2069492032,"The cryptochrome/photolyase (CRY/PL) family of photoreceptors mediates adaptive responses to ultraviolet and blue light exposure in all kingdoms of life. Whereas PLs function predominantly in DNA repair of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and 6-4 photolesions caused by ultraviolet radiation, CRYs transduce signals important for growth, development, magnetosensitivity and circadian clocks. Despite these diverse functions, PLs/CRYs preserve a common structural fold, a dependence on flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and an internal photoactivation mechanism. However, members of the CRY/PL family differ in the substrates recognized (protein or DNA), photochemical reactions catalysed and involvement of an antenna cofactor. It is largely unknown how the animal CRYs that regulate circadian rhythms act on their substrates. CRYs contain a variable carboxy-terminal tail that appends the conserved PL homology domain (PHD) and is important for function. Here, we report a 2.3-Å resolution crystal structure of Drosophila CRY with an intact C terminus. The C-terminal helix docks in the analogous groove that binds DNA substrates in PLs. Conserved Trp 536 juts into the CRY catalytic centre to mimic PL recognition of DNA photolesions. The FAD anionic semiquinone found in the crystals assumes a conformation to facilitate restructuring of the tail helix. These results help reconcile the diverse functions of the CRY/PL family by demonstrating how conserved protein architecture and photochemistry can be elaborated into a range of light-driven functions."

In an inbred mouse strain with a targeted deletion in the P element, we find that this element regulates OR gene choice differentially across its cluster of 24 OR genes. Importantly, the fold changes of NanoString counts in ΔP or ΔH mice are in very close agreement with the fold changes of cell counts, determined by in situ hybridization. Thus, the P and H elements regulate the probability of OR gene choice, not OR transcript level per OSN."

Dephosphorylation of numerous mitotic substrates, which were phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk), is thought to bring about mitotic exit, but how temporal ordering of mitotic exit events is achieved is poorly understood. Here, we show, using budding yeast, that dephosphorylation of Cdk substrates involved in sequential mitotic exit events occurs with ordered timing. We test different models of how ordering might be achieved by modulating Cdk and Cdk-counteracting phosphatase Cdc14 activities in vivo, as well as by kinetic analysis of Cdk substrate phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in vitro. Our results suggest that the gradual change of the phosphatase to kinase ratio over the course of mitotic exit is read out by Cdk substrates that respond by dephosphorylation at distinct thresholds.

https://openalex.org/W2066580159,"Most neutron stars are formed in either iron-core collapse supernovae or electron-capture supernovae. Until now, it has not been possible to differentiate between the neutron stars produced by these two precursors. That may change with the discovery of two distinct sub-populations of Be/X-ray binary pulsars with different characteristic spin and orbital periods, and orbital eccentricities. The two sub-populations are most likely to be associated with the two distinct types of neutron-star-forming supernovae, with electron-capture events preferentially producing short orbital and spin periods in low-eccentricity systems. Two types of supernova are thought to produce the overwhelming majority of neutron stars in the Universe1. The first type, iron-core-collapse supernovae, occurs when a high-mass star develops a degenerate iron core that exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit2. The second type, electron-capture supernovae, is associated with the collapse of a lower-mass oxygen–neon–magnesium core as it loses pressure support owing to the sudden capture of electrons by neon and/or magnesium nuclei3,4. It has hitherto been impossible to identify the two distinct families of neutron stars produced in these formation channels. Here we report that a large, well-known class of neutron-star-hosting X-ray pulsars is actually composed of two distinct subpopulations with different characteristic spin periods, orbital periods and orbital eccentricities. This class, the Be/X-ray binaries, contains neutron stars that accrete material from a more massive companion star5. The two subpopulations are most probably associated with the two distinct types of neutron-star-forming supernova, with electron-capture supernovae preferentially producing systems with short spin periods, short orbital periods and low eccentricities. Intriguingly, the split between the two subpopulations is clearest in the distribution of the logarithm of spin period, a result that had not been predicted and which still remains to be explained."

While the role of fascin in the regulation of breast cancer cell migration has been previously shown, the underlying molecular mechanism remained poorly defined. We have used variety of immunological and functional assays to study whether fascin regulates breast cancer metastasis-associated molecules. In this report we found a direct relationship between fascin expression in breast cancer patients and; metastasis and shorter disease-free survival. Most importantly, in vitro interference with fascin expression by loss or gain of function demonstrates a central role for this protein in regulating the cell morphology, migration and invasion potential. Our results show that fascin regulation of invasion is mediated via modulating several metastasis-associated genes. We show for the first time that fascin down-regulates the expression and nuclear translocation of a key metastasis suppressor protein known as breast cancer metastasis suppressor-1 (BRMS1). In addition, fascin up-regulates NF-kappa B activity, which is essential for metastasis. Importantly, fascin up-regulates other proteins that are known to be critical for the execution of metastasis such as urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and the matrix metalloproteases (MMP)-2 and MMP-9.

These class V HLH proteins include Extramacrochaetae (Emc) in Drosophila and four inhibitor of DNA binding (Id) proteins in mammals.

In Drosophila, widespread expression of Emc is thought to set a threshold for neurogenesis that only a certain level of AS-C/Da heterodimers can overcome (Cubas and Modolell, 1992Cubas P. Modolell J.

The highly regulated transcription of the class II genes has been studied intensely. The broad expression patterns of class I and class V genes have not suggested comparable regulation. Most Drosophila epithelia express both Da and Emc, and many mammalian cells express one or more of each class of protein. It has been suggested that expression levels of class I and class V proteins might define precise thresholds for differentiation in response to class II proteins, but this has not been tested directly (Vaessin et al., 1994Vaessin H.

Deletion of the Drosophila class I gene da precludes function by class II proteins such as Achaete and Scute, so that da is required for most neurogenesis. Drosophila has a single class V protein encoded by emc, but studies of emc null mutations have been limited because even clones of cells homozygous for emc null mutations do not survive in imaginal discs, suggesting a role in cell growth or survival (García Alonso and García-Bellido, 1988García Alonso L.A.

Biol. 1988; 197: 328-338Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The conclusion that Emc antagonizes class II proneural genes is based on studies of partial loss of emc function (Botas et al., 1982Botas J. Moscoso del Prado J. García-Bellido A.

Recently, we found that large clones of imaginal disc cells completely null for emc function were recovered when the surrounding cells were heterozygous for a mutation in RpS17 (Bhattacharya and Baker, 2009Bhattacharya A. Baker N.E. The HLH protein Extramacrochaetae is required for R7 cell and cone cell fates in the Drosophila eye.Dev. Biol. 2009; 327: 288-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This shows that emc is not absolutely required for cell division or survival, although it contributes to the competitive success of cells in vivo. The phenotypes of the emc null mutant clones obtained are stronger than observed with hypomorphic alleles (Bhattacharya and Baker, 2009Bhattacharya A. Baker N.E. The HLH protein Extramacrochaetae is required for R7 cell and cone cell fates in the Drosophila eye.Dev. Biol. 2009; 327: 288-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To address how Emc, Da, and class II proteins work together to promote development, the present study examined Drosophila eye development and other tissues where “proneural regions,” in which neural progenitor cells can arise, are defined by localized expression of proneural bHLH genes (Gómez-Skarmeta et al., 2003Gómez-Skarmeta J.L. Campuzano S. Modolell J. Half a century of neural prepatterning: the story of a few bristles and many genes.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 587-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The class II bHLH gene for retinal neurogenesis is atonal (ato), whereas many other parts of the Drosophila nervous system are specified by multiple AS-C proneural genes. Transcription of ato and eye differentiation begin at the posterior margin of the eye imaginal disc, the epithelial primordium for the adult head. The extracellular signals Hh and Dpp drive a wave of ato expression that spreads anteriorly until the whole retina is differentiating. Notch signaling and other lateral inhibitors restrict ato expression to a spaced array of R8 photoreceptor precursor neurons within the “morphogenetic furrow,” an indentation in the epithelium that moves anteriorly as differentiation progresses. Once specified, each R8 neuron recruits multiple other retinal cell types (Wolff and Ready, 1993Wolff T. Ready D.F. Pattern formation in the Drosophila retina.in: Bate M. Martinez Arias A. The Development of Drosophila melanogaster. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 1277-1325Google Scholar, Roignant and Treisman, 2009Roignant J.Y. Treisman J.E. Pattern formation in the Drosophila eye disc.Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2009; 53: 795-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In addition to the relative genetic simplicity of Drosophila eye development, its progressive nature conveniently reveals developmental dynamics, as each eye imaginal disc contains a posterior-to-anterior sequence of cells that initiated the eye differentiation program at progressively later times. We report a previously unrecognized cross-interacting regulatory network that locks together class I and class V gene expression. The circuit is broken by extracellular signals so that levels of Da and Emc change to accompany differentiation. This network provides regulation of HLH gene expression that is essential to proper patterning. This regulation parallels that of class II proneural bHLH genes, e.g., the proneural region of the eye alters expression of Da and Emc even when the proneural gene ato is absent. Such a regulatory network has potentially wide implications, given the diverse roles of bHLH genes. We find that a similar network acts in many Drosophila tissues and in mammalian cells, and therefore we hypothesize that class I/class V networks are a general feature underlying bHLH-dependent differentiation. Because recent observations in the Drosophila eye indicate that emc has effects where ato is not yet expressed, we examined the effects of emc null mutations on da. Da is the heterodimer partner of Ato (Jarman et al., 1993Jarman A.P. Grau Y. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. atonal is a proneural gene that directs chordotonal organ formation in the Drosophila peripheral nervous system.Cell. 1993; 73: 1307-1321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Da is expressed ubiquitously. Its expression level is largely uniform in the imaginal discs but is elevated in proneural regions where class II bHLH genes such as ato or members of the AS-C confer neural potential (Figures 1A–1C ). Compared to normal levels, Da was dramatically elevated in emc null clones (Figure 1D). In addition, when emc was absent, Da levels were identical within and outside proneural regions. We observed similar results from multiple tissues, including eye, antennal, leg, and wing imaginal discs and their peripodial epithelia (Figure 1D and Figure S1 available online). These findings established Emc as a general negative regulator of Da expression and showed that the spatial differences in Da levels seen in normal development depend on emc.Figure S1Related to Figure 1Show full captionClones of homozygous emc and da mutant cells are labeled by the lack of GFP expression (green).

Emc and Da levels normally vary reciprocally. Emc is lower in proneural regions where Da is higher (Figures 1A–1C). We asked whether Da reciprocally inhibits Emc expression. On the contrary, we detected very little Emc in da null clones anywhere in the imaginal discs or their peripodial epithelia (Figures 1E and S1). Thus, da is required for Emc expression. These findings establish that Emc and Da proteins are the major regulators of each other's expression and show that reciprocal changes in Da and Emc levels are not caused by a “toggle switch” of mutual antagonism. There is, instead, an unsuspected negative feedback loop in which Da is responsible for expression of its competitive inhibitor, Emc. Emc cannot bind DNA and regulates gene expression by blocking DNA binding by bHLH proteins (Massari and Murre, 2000Massari M.E. Murre C. Helix-loop-helix proteins: regulators of transcription in eucaryotic organisms.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar). The fact that Emc repressed Da so widely suggests a role for Da in its own expression, which was suggested previously on genetic grounds (Smith and Cronmiller, 2001Smith III, J.E. Cronmiller C. The Drosophila daughterless gene autoregulates and is controlled by both positive and negative cis regulation.Development. 2001; 128: 4705-4714PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, Da homodimers can bind to DNA (Cabrera and Alonso, 1991Cabrera C.V. Alonso M.C.

Emc and its homologs can heterodimerize with Da and its homologs and prevent their binding to DNA (Benezra et al., 1990Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. The protein Id: a negative regulator of helix-loop-helix DNA binding proteins.Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1801) Google Scholar, Ellis et al., 1990Ellis H.M. Spann D.R.

To test a role of Da in da transcription, Da was expressed using a UAS-da transgene that lacks the noncoding first exon (Hinz et al., 1994Hinz U. Giebel B. Campos-Ortega J.A. The basic-helix-loop-helix domain of Drosophila lethal of scute protein is sufficient for proneural function and activates neurogenic genes.Cell. 1994; 76: 77-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), which was therefore present only in transcripts from the endogenous gene. When Da was overexpressed in the differentiating portion of the eye-antennal discs using GMR-Gal4, RT-PCR analysis detected 3× more endogenous da mRNA than in GMR-Gal4 controls lacking the UAS-da transgene (Figures 2A–2C ). This is likely an underestimate of the actual stimulation of da transcription, as not all eye disc cells express GMR-Gal4. Consistent with Da-dependent emc transcription, emc transcript was also elevated 5× (Figure 2C). Because Emc inhibits Da function, Da-induced Emc overexpression potentially limits how much endogenous da and emc genes can respond to Da overexpression. These findings show that Da transcriptionally regulates both da and emc. To further define the mechanism of da transcription, an 8.8 kb genomic transgene was generated that conferred normal Da expression and rescued da null mutant genotypes to normal, fertile adults, showing that it contains all sequences essential for da expression and function (Figure 2D and data not shown). Sections of this genomic DNA were first analyzed for enhancer activity by transient transfection into Drosophila S2 cells (Figure S2A ). The ∼2.5 kb “fragment 3” segment (Figure 2D) stimulated transcription ∼8× when a Da expression construct was also transfected (Figure S2B). Da-dependent transcriptional activation was blocked by cotransfection of an Emc expression construct, suggesting a requirement for DNA binding by Da protein (data not shown). Fragment 3 is conserved in other Drosophila species, although this is to be expected because it includes much of the da-coding region. The putative Da-dependent enhancer, encoded by fragment 3, was tested in vivo. GFP reporter constructs made use of the da proximal promoter region including the predicted transcription start site (Figure 2D). This 542 bp promoter conferred broad GFP expression throughout imaginal discs that was unaltered in GMR-Gal4, UAS-da (Figures 2E, 2F, and 2I). By contrast, incorporating the putative enhancer led to elevated GFP expression posterior to the furrow in GMR-Gal4, UAS-da (Figures 2G–2I). These data are consistent with the model that Da regulates its own expression and show that fragment 3 is an enhancer that responds to Da and can be inhibited by Emc. To investigate whether a similar network acts in mammalian cells, we used the transformed human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T. All of the human paralogs of Da and Emc were expressed in HEK293T cells (Figure 2J). To test the potential of an E protein to regulate expression of these genes, we overexpressed E47 protein in HEK293T cells. Transcription of the endogenous E2a gene (which encodes both E47 and E12 proteins via alternative splicing) was elevated ∼8× by transfected E47. The other E protein genes, HEB and E2-2, were unaffected (Figure 2K). In the same experiment, Id1 transcripts were elevated ∼4× by E47 transfection. The level of other id transcripts did not alter significantly (Figure 2K). These data show that E protein-dependent transcription of an E protein gene and an Id protein gene occurs in a human cell line, similar to the Da-dependent transcription of da and emc observed in Drosophila. It is puzzling that Emc levels drop where Da levels are highest, e.g., in the morphogenetic furrow and other proneural regions (Figures 1A–1C). We hypothesized that othe"

Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is the most abundant phthalate and it impairs fertility by acting as an endocrine disruptor. The aim of the present study was to analyze the effects of in vitro acute exposure to DEHP on oocyte maturation, energy and oxidative status in the horse, a large animal model. Cumulus cell (CC) apoptosis and oxidative status were also investigated. Cumulus-oocyte complexes from the ovaries of slaughtered mares were cultured in vitro in presence of 0.12, 12 and 1200 µM DEHP. After in vitro maturation (IVM), CCs were removed and evaluated for apoptosis (cytological assessment and TUNEL) and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Oocytes were evaluated for nuclear chromatin configuration. Matured (Metaphase II stage; MII) oocytes were further evaluated for cytoplasmic energy and oxidative parameters. DEHP significantly inhibited oocyte maturation when added at low doses (0.12 µM; P<0.05). This effect was related to increased CC apoptosis (P<0.001) and reduced ROS levels (P<0.0001). At higher doses (12 and 1200 µM), DEHP induced apoptosis (P<0.0001) and ROS increase (P<0.0001) in CCs without affecting oocyte maturation. In DEHP-exposed MII oocytes, mitochondrial distribution patterns, apparent energy status (MitoTracker fluorescence intensity), intracellular ROS localization and levels, mt/ROS colocalization and total SOD activity did not vary, whereas increased ATP content (P<0.05), possibly of glycolytic origin, was found. Co-treatment with N-Acetyl-Cysteine reversed apoptosis and efficiently scavenged excessive ROS in DEHP-treated CCs without enhancing oocyte maturation. In conclusion, acute in vitro exposure to DEHP inhibits equine oocyte maturation without altering ooplasmic energy and oxidative stress parameters in matured oocytes which retain the potential to be fertilized and develop into embryos even though further studies are necessary to confirm this possibility."

Each serotype is genetically distant from the others, and each has been subdivided into different genotypes based on phylogenetic analysis. The study of dengue evolution in endemic regions is important since the diagnosis is often made by nucleic acid amplification tests, which depends upon recognition of the viral genome target, and natural occurring mutations can affect the performance of these assays. Here we report for the first time a detailed study of the phylogenetic relationships of DENV-2 from Central America, and report the first fully sequenced DENV-2 strain from Guatemala. Our analysis of the envelope (E) protein and of the open reading frame of strains from Central American countries, between 1999 and 2009, revealed that at least two lineages of the American/Asian genotype of DENV-2 have recently circulated in that region. In occasions the co-circulation of these lineages may have occurred and that has been suggested to play a role in the observed increased severity of clinical cases. Our time-scale analysis indicated that the most recent common ancestor for Central American DENV-2 of the American/Asian genotype existed about 19 years ago. Finally, we report positive selection in DENV-2 from Central America in codons of the genes encoding for C, E, NS2A, NS3, and NS5 proteins. Some of these identified codons are novel findings, described for the first time for any of the DENV-2 genotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2035675733,"The teleost fish Danio rerio (zebrafish) has a remarkable ability to generate newborn neurons in its brain at adult stages of its lifespan-a process called adult neurogenesis. This ability relies on proliferating ventricular progenitors and is in striking contrast to mammalian brains that have rather restricted capacity for adult neurogenesis. Therefore, investigating the zebrafish brain can help not only to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of widespread adult neurogenesis in a vertebrate species, but also to design therapies in humans with what we learn from this teleost. Yet, understanding the cellular behavior and molecular programs underlying different biological processes in the adult zebrafish brain requires techniques that allow manipulation of gene function. As a complementary method to the currently used misexpression techniques in zebrafish, such as transgenic approaches or electroporation-based delivery of DNA, we devised a cerebroventricular microinjection (CVMI)-assisted knockdown protocol that relies on vivo morpholino oligonucleotides, which do not require electroporation for cellular uptake. This rapid method allows uniform and efficient knockdown of genes in the ventricular cells of the zebrafish brain, which contain the neurogenic progenitors. We also provide data on the use of CVMI for growth factor administration to the brain--in our case FGF8, which modulates the proliferation rate of the ventricular cells. In this paper, we describe the CVMI method and discuss its potential uses in zebrafish."

Significant effort has been made to engineer Saccharomyces cerevisiae to efficiently ferment pentose sugars such as D-xylose and L-arabinose into biofuels such as ethanol through heterologous expression of the fungal D-xylose and L-arabinose pathways. However, one of the major bottlenecks in these fungal pathways is that the cofactors are not balanced, which contributes to inefficient utilization of pentose sugars. We utilized a genome-scale model of S. cerevisiae to predict the maximal achievable growth rate for cofactor balanced and imbalanced D-xylose and L-arabinose utilization pathways. Dynamic flux balance analysis (DFBA) was used to simulate batch fermentation of glucose, D-xylose, and L-arabinose. The dynamic models and experimental results are in good agreement for the wild type and for the engineered D-xylose utilization pathway. Cofactor balancing the engineered D-xylose and L-arabinose utilization pathways simulated an increase in ethanol batch production of 24.7% while simultaneously reducing the predicted substrate utilization time by 70%. Furthermore, the effects of cofactor balancing the engineered pentose utilization pathways were evaluated throughout the genome-scale metabolic network. This work not only provides new insights to the global network effects of cofactor balancing but also provides useful guidelines for engineering a recombinant yeast strain with cofactor balanced engineered pathways that efficiently co-utilizes pentose and hexose sugars for biofuels production. Experimental switching of cofactor usage in enzymes has been demonstrated, but is a time-consuming effort. Therefore, systems biology models that can predict the likely outcome of such strain engineering efforts are highly useful for motivating which efforts are likely to be worth the significant time investment."

https://openalex.org/W2069433210,"The contribution of aberrant DNA methylation in silencing of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) and microRNAs has been investigated. Since these epigenetic alterations are reversible, it became of interest to determine the effects of the 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC) demethylation therapy in breast cancer at different molecular levels.Here we investigate a synoptic model to predict complete DAC treatment effects at the level of genes, microRNAs and proteins for several human breast cancer lines. The present study assessed an effective treatment dosage based on the cell viability, cytotoxicity, apoptosis and methylation assays for the investigated cell lines. A highly aggressive and a non-aggressive cell line were investigated using omics approaches such as MALDI-TOF MS, mRNA- and microRNA expression arrays, 2-D gel electrophoresis and LC-MS-MS. Complete molecular profiles including the biological interaction and possible early and late systematic stable or transient effects of the methylation inhibition were determined. Beside the activation of several epigenetically suppressed TSGs, we also showed significant dysregulation of some important oncogenes, oncomiRs and oncosuppressors miRNAs as well as drug tolerance genes/miRNAs/proteins.In the present study, the results denote some new molecular DAC targets and pathways based on the chemical modification of DNA methylation in breast cancer. The outlined approach might prove to be useful as an epigenetic treatment model also for other human solid tumors in the management of cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2070707529,"Background p53 abnormality and aneuploidy often coexist in human tumors, and tetraploidy is considered as an intermediate between normal diploidy and aneuploidy. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether and how p53 influences the transformation from tetraploidy to aneuploidy. Principal Findings Live cell imaging was performed to determine the fates and mitotic behaviors of several human and mouse tetraploid cells with different p53 status, and centrosome and spindle immunostaining was used to investigate centrosome behaviors. We found that p53 dominant-negative mutation, point mutation, or knockout led to a 2∼ 33-fold increase of multipolar mitosis in N/TERT1, 3T3 and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), while mitotic entry and cell death were not significantly affected. In p53-/- tetraploid MEFs, the ability of centrosome clustering was compromised, while centrosome inactivation was not affected. Suppression of RhoA/ROCK activity by specific inhibitors in p53-/- tetraploid MEFs enhanced centrosome clustering, decreased multipolar mitosis from 38% to 20% and 16% for RhoA and ROCK, respectively, while expression of constitutively active RhoA in p53+/+ tetraploid 3T3 cells increased the frequency of multipolar mitosis from 15% to 35%. Conclusions p53 could not prevent tetraploid cells entering mitosis or induce tetraploid cell death. However, p53 abnormality impaired centrosome clustering and lead to multipolar mitosis in tetraploid cells by modulating the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2116160907,"The rat represents an important animal model that, in many respects, is superior to the mouse for dissecting behavioral, cardiovascular and other physiological pathologies relevant to humans. Derivation of induced pluripotent stem cells from rats (riPS) opens the opportunity for gene targeting in specific rat strains, as well as for the development of new protocols for the treatment of different degenerative diseases. Here, we report an improved lentivirus-based hit-and-run riPS derivation protocol that makes use of small inhibitors of MEK and GSK3. We demonstrate that the excision of proviruses does not affect either the karyotype or the differentiation ability of these cells. We show that the established riPS cells are readily amenable to genetic manipulations such as stable electroporation. Finally, we propose a genetic tool for an improvement of riPS cell quality in culture. These data may prompt iPS cell-based gene targeting in rat as well as the development of iPS cell-based therapies using disease models established in this species."

https://openalex.org/W2023160857,"LPXTG proteins, present in most if not all Gram-positive bacteria, are known to be anchored by sortases to the bacterial peptidoglycan. More than one sortase gene is often encoded in a bacterial species, and each sortase is supposed to specifically anchor given LPXTG proteins, depending of the sequence of the C-terminal cell wall sorting signal (cwss), bearing an LPXTG motif or another recognition sequence. B. anthracis possesses three sortase genes. B. anthracis sortase deleted mutant strains are not affected in their virulence. To determine the sortase repertoires, we developed a genetic screen using the property of the gamma phage to lyse bacteria only when its receptor, GamR, an LPXTG protein, is exposed at the surface. We identified 10 proteins that contain a cell wall sorting signal and are covalently anchored to the peptidoglycan. Some chimeric proteins yielded phage lysis in all sortase mutant strains, suggesting that cwss proteins remained surface accessible in absence of their anchoring sortase, probably as a consequence of membrane localization of yet uncleaved precursor proteins. For definite assignment of the sortase repertoires, we consequently relied on a complementary test, using a biochemical approach, namely immunoblot experiments. The sortase anchoring nine of these proteins has thus been determined. The absence of virulence defect of the sortase mutants could be a consequence of the membrane localization of the cwss proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2128066179,"Dental microwear analysis is conducted on a community of platyrrhine primates from South America. This analysis focuses on the primate community of Cachoeira Porteira (Para, Brazil), in which seven sympatric species occur: Alouatta seniculus, Ateles paniscus, Cebus apella, Chiropotes satanas, Pithecia Pithecia, Saguinus midas, and Saimiri sciureus. Shearing quotients are also calculated for each taxon of this primate community. Dental microwear results indicate significant differences between taxa, but are somewhat insufficient when it comes to discriminating between ecologically similar taxa. The primates of Cachoeira Porteira all incorporate a certain amount of fruit in their diet, entailing a definite amount of inter-specific competition as they must share food resources. Alouatta is the most folivorous taxon of this community, which is corroborated by dental microwear analysis. Ateles, although of a similar size to Alouatta, limits inter-specific competition by incorporating more fruit in its diet. Cebus has a very diverse omnivorous diet, which is highlighted in this study, as it compares to both fruit and leaf eating taxa. In some cases, microwear results need to be supplemented by other methods. For example, dental microwear seems insufficient to distinguish between Pithecia and Chiropotes, which eat foods with similar physical properties. However, other methods (i.e. shearing quotients and body mass) provide enough complimentary information to be able to highlight differences between the two taxa. On the other hand, dental microwear can highlight differences between primates which have similar diets, such as Saimiri and Saguinus. In this case, differences could be due to other exogenous factors."
