However, the membrane transport mechanisms and the signaling events involved in the uptake of these virus-like particles remain ill-defined. We now report that internalization of exosomes derived from glioblastoma (GBM) cells involves nonclassical, lipid raft-dependent endocytosis. Importantly, we show that the lipid raft-associated protein caveolin-1 (CAV1), in analogy with its previously described role in virus uptake, negatively regulates the uptake of exosomes. We find that exosomes induce the phosphorylation of several downstream targets known to associate with lipid rafts as signaling and sorting platforms, such as extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2) and heat shock protein 27 (HSP27). Interestingly, exosome uptake appears dependent on unperturbed ERK1/2-HSP27 signaling, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation is under negative influence by CAV1 during internalization of exosomes. These findings significantly advance our general understanding of exosome-mediated uptake and offer potential strategies for how this pathway may be targeted through modulation of CAV1 expression and ERK1/2 signaling.Background: Exosome vesicles can transfer molecular information previously shown to stimulate tumor development; however, the mechanism of exosome uptake is unknown.Results: Mammalian cells internalize exosomes through lipid raft-mediated endocytosis negatively regulated by caveolin-1.Conclusion: Our findings provide novel insights into cellular uptake of exosomes.Significance: Our data provide potential strategies for how the exosome uptake pathway may be targeted.

Conclusion: Our findings provide novel insights into cellular uptake of exosomes. Significance: Our data provide potential strategies for how the exosome uptake pathway may be targeted. The process of endocytosis involves multiple mechanisms in mammalian cells differing in the type of cargo and fate of cargo upon internalization. Described mechanisms of classical endocytosis include clathrin-dependent endocytosis, macropinocytosis, clathrin-independent endocytosis pathways such as caveolae-mediated uptake associated with lipid rafts (or cholesterol-enriched membrane microdomains) in the plasma membrane and non-classical pathways involving non-clathrin, non-caveolae-mediated endocytosis (1Damm E.M.

Melanoma exosomes educate bone marrow progenitor cells toward a pro-metastatic phenotype through MET.Nature Med. 2012; 18: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (2637) Google Scholar). Exosomes are released from multivesicular bodies (MVBs) 2The abbreviations used are: MVB, multivesicular body; GBM, glioblastoma; CAV, caveolin; HSP, heat shock protein; NTA, nanoparticle tracking analysis; TIRF, total internal reflection fluorescence; TF, tissue factor; Tfn, transferrin; Ctx, cholera toxin; MβCD, methyl-β-cyclodextrin; HMG-CoA, 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A. upon their fusion with the plasma membrane (13Gruenberg J.

Recent studies suggest that released vesicles may transfer functional RNA as well as transmembrane proteins contributing to the propagation of a transformed cell phenotype (9Skog J.

Accordingly, exosomes can be regarded as multi-purpose delivery vehicles in analogy with an endogenous virus-like particle infecting cells in the surrounding environment. Importantly, recent reports have documented key processes involved in exosome release and have identified similarities in topology and mechanisms to retroviral budding (15Ostrowski M. Carmo N.B.

Syndecan-syntenin-ALIX regulates the biogenesis of exosomes.Nature Cell Biol. 2012; 14: 677-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). It is still controversial whether vesicular uptake is cell type specific (17Feng D. Zhao W.L. Ye Y.Y. Bai X.C. Liu R.Q. Chang L.F. Zhou Q. Sui S.F. Cellular internalization of exosomes occurs through phagocytosis.Traffic. 2010; 11: 675-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar), and whether it involves membrane fusion or endocytosis (18Del Conde I.

Thus, studies elucidating the mechanisms involved in exosome uptake remain an important challenge. We have previously reported on microvesicle-induced pro-angiogenic signaling; a process highly relevant in the most aggressive brain tumor type GBM (20Svensson K.J. Kucharzewska P. Christianson H.C. Sköld S. Löfstedt T. Johansson M.C. Mörgelin M. Bengzon J. Ruf W. Belting M. Hypoxia triggers a proangiogenic pathway involving cancer cell microvesicles and PAR-2-mediated heparin-binding EGF signaling in endothelial cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 13147-13152Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Here we set out to elucidate the unknown mechanisms of the uptake of GBM cell-derived vesicles and the signaling events involved in the internalization process. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs, Lonza) were cultured in endothelial basal medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 ng/ml hydrocortisone, and 20 μg/ml human recombinant EGF. Human cervix adenocarcinoma (HeLa, ATCC), HeLa cells previously generated to stably overexpress CAV1-YFP (21Wittrup A. Zhang S.H. Svensson K.J. Kucharzewska P. Johansson M.C. Mörgelin M. Belting M.

U.S.A. 2010; 107: 13342-13347Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), human GBM cells (U87 MG, ATCC) and wild-type (WT) or CAV1 knock out (cav-1 (−/−)) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF, ATCC) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (growth medium). CHO-K1 and COS-7 cells were cultured in F12K supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. U87 MG shRNA negative control (NC) and shRNA CAV1 were routinely cultured in growth medium supplemented with 1 μg/ml puromycin. U87 MG cells transfected with a CD63-mCherry plasmid were sorted with FACSAria by fluorescence intensity and clones were further selected by neomycin resistance. U87 MG-CD63-mCherry cells were routine cultured in growth medium supplemented with 1000 μg/ml G418. All cells were cultured in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C.

Simvastatin was from Calbiochem. Complete protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors were from Roche. Human phosphokinase antibody array (#ARY003) was from R&D Systems. U0126 was purchased from Selleck Chemicals. Plasmid encoding CD63-mCherry was kindly provided by Dr Lippincott-Schwartz and CD63-GFP plasmids was a gift from Dr. Takahisa Takino (Kanazawa University). The plasmid encoding pIRESneo-EGFP-α-tubulin was obtained from Addgene (Patricia Wadsworth, plasmid #12298). Plasmid encoding CAV1-YFP (pEX_EF1_CAV1-YFP) was from ATCC. Secreted vesicles were isolated from cell culture medium of U87 MG as previously described (20Svensson K.J. Kucharzewska P. Christianson H.C. Sköld S. Löfstedt T. Johansson M.C. Mörgelin M. Bengzon J. Ruf W. Belting M. Hypoxia triggers a proangiogenic pathway involving cancer cell microvesicles and PAR-2-mediated heparin-binding EGF signaling in endothelial cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 13147-13152Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Transmission electron microscopy was performed to validate the presence and purity of intact exosomes and analyzed for size using nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). Protein amounts were quantified with BCATM protein assay kit (Pierce) in each vesicle preparation. Isolated exosomes were in indicated experiments labeled with PKH67, PKH26 or cellvue midklaret fluorescent labeling kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Sigma). Each vesicle preparation was stored at 4 °C and used within 5 days after isolation. All experiments were performed in Zeiss LSM 710 confocal scanning equipment using excitation wavelengths of 405, 488, 546, 633 nm, and a Plan-Apochromat 20×/0.8M27 objective and a C-Apochromat 63X/1.20W korr M27 glycerol immersion objective. Image analysis was performed using the Zeiss LSM software. Live cell imaging of internalized exosomes was performed with the same microscope equipped with heat incubator set at 37 °C with 5% CO2. For live cell confocal laser scanning microscopy experiments, cells were grown in glass bottom chamber slides, and 10–20 μg/ml of labeled exosomes were added to subconfluent cells in phenol red-free and serum-free conditions and incubated as indicated in the figure legend. Surface-bound exosomes were removed by extensive washing with 1 m NaCl and serum-free medium, followed by live cell imaging of intracellular exosomes in phenol-red free medium. For colocalization studies, 10 μg/ml CtxB-FITC, 100 μg/ml Dx10-FITC, or 150 μg/ml Tfn-FITC was co-incubated with labeled exosomes and incubated for 30 min. Cells were washed as above and fixed using 2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were immediately analyzed. The weighted colocalization coefficients were calculated in representative cells using the Zeiss LSM software, and represent the number of red pixels (exosomes) that colocalize with turquoise pixels (CtxB or Dx10) divided by the total number of turquoise pixels. Total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy experiments were performed using an inverted microscope (Axio Observer Z1; Zeiss) equipped with a Zeiss TIRF module and a 100× 1.45 NA DIC M27 Zeiss TIRF oil immersion lens and acquisitions were made by using Slidebook 5.5 (3I). Subconfluent HeLa CAV1-YFP cells were incubated with labeled exosomes for 1 h in serum-free medium prior to live cell microscopy in phenol red-free medium. Subconfluent cells were incubated with labeled exosomes for the indicated time periods. Cells were washed in PBS, detached with trypsin, and subsequently washed twice in PBS supplemented with 1% BSA (w/v) and analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACS-Calibur instrument integrated with Cell-Quest software (BD Biosciences). Graphs show mean fluorescent values (10,000 events/sample) of one of three representative experiments (n = 3) with similar results ± S.D. unless stated otherwise. Isolated exosomes or cells incubated with or without exosomes were washed twice in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), pelleted, fixed for 1 h at 20 °C, and overnight at 4 °C in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in cacodylate buffer. For uptake of exosomes in HUVECs, cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml exosomes followed by trypsinization, washing in TBS and fixation in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in cacodylate buffer overnight at 4 °C. Some samples were incubated with the primary antibodies TF (10H10 titer 1:50) and tsg101 polyclonal (rabbit, titer 1:100) or flotillin-1 antibody (rabbit, 10 μg/ml) followed by detection with secondary antibodies conjugated with 5 nm gold, TF (1:10), or 15 nm gold (tsg101 and flotillin-1, titer 1:20) and analyzed using a JEOL JEM 1230 transmission electron microscope (JEOL, Peabody, MA) as previously described (20Svensson K.J. Kucharzewska P. Christianson H.C. Sköld S. Löfstedt T. Johansson M.C. Mörgelin M. Bengzon J. Ruf W. Belting M. Hypoxia triggers a proangiogenic pathway involving cancer cell microvesicles and PAR-2-mediated heparin-binding EGF signaling in endothelial cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 13147-13152Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). DNA plasmid transfections were performed in U87 MG cells (CD63-GFP), COS-7 (tubulin-GFP) or MEF, U87MG, CHO-K1, and HeLa (CAV1-YFP) seeded in chamber slides for confocal imaging or 24-well plates for flow cytometry analysis and grown in their respective medium w/o antibiotics. RNA interference was performed in HUVECs or U87 MG seeded in respective growth medium w/o antibiotics. All transfections were performed using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) and 100 nm siRNA against CD63, HSP27, or clathrin following the recommendations of the manufacturer. U87 MG cells were transduced using Mission Lentiviral transduction particles (SHCLNV, Sigma Aldrich) for CAV1 (NM_001753 clone TRCN000008002) and negative control (negative control (SHCO16V, pLKO.1-puro)) at a MOI of 0.2 and selected by 1 μg/ml puromycin. Cells or exosomes were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in a reducing RIPA buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and complete mini protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). For CD63 antibody requiring non-reduced conditions, samples were lysed in Triton-X buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA) supplemented with complete mini protease inhibitor mixture. Proteins were fractionated by electrophoresis, blotted, and developed using HRP substrate. The intensity of the bands was quantified using ImageJ software (NIH) using α-tubulin as loading control unless stated otherwise. For immunoprecipitation using magnetic Protein G® beads, cells were lysed in denaturing lysis buffer, and 500 μg of protein were immunoprecipitated using 1 μg of CAV1 antibody and incubated with rotation at 4 °C overnight. Resuspended Dynabeads were added (1.5 mg) and incubated with rotation at 4 °C for 3 h. Dynabeads®-Ab-antigen complexes were washed four times in PBS with Ca2+/Mg2+ before elution and further Western blotting analysis using 20% SEA Block in TBS supplemented with 1% (v/v) Tween20 as blocking buffer and for incubation with primary and secondary antibodies. Proteins were fractionated by electrophoresis, blotted, and developed using HRP substrate. HUVECs were starved for 16 h in serum free medium and were either untreated or stimulated with exosomes (20 μg/ml) for 10 or 30 min for phosphokinase antibody array (#ARY003, R&D) before lysate collection. Levels of phosphorylated proteins (200 μg per sample) were analyzed in cell lysates according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Corresponding protein amounts were used as a control of phosphoproteins residing in exosomes. The arrays were quantified using ImageJ software (NIH). Values are expressed as the mean intensity relative to reference (Ref) of the respective blot. All data are presented as the mean of triplicates ± S.D. Statistical significance was evaluated with Student's two-tailed unpaired t test using Microsoft Excel. In some cases, the error bars were smaller than the symbols. The GBM cell line U87 MG secretes exosome-like microvesicles or exosomes previously characterized by us and others for features and function (9Skog J. Würdinger T. van Rijn S. Meijer D.H. Gainche L.

Nanotracking analysis and electron microscopy showed 50–400 nm-sized vesicles (Fig. 1, A and B) that were further characterized for the presence of the exosomal markers CD63, Tissue Factor (TF), and flotillin-1 and the absence of the ER marker calnexin, demonstrating purity of vesicles (Fig. 1C). The internalization of exosomes was visualized by confocal fluorescence microscopy in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (Fig. 1D, left panel) and U87 MG cells (supplemental video S1). The specificity of the uptake of fluorescent exosomes was supported by efficient attenuation by an excess of unlabeled exosomes (Fig. 1D, right panel). The uptake mechanism of exosomes has been a matter of debate, i.e. whether exosomes enter cells through direct fusion with the plasma membrane of recipient cells or through endocytosis (18Del Conde I. Shrimpton C.N. Thiagarajan P. López J.A. Tissue-factor-bearing microvesicles arise from lipid rafts and fuse with activated platelets to initiate coagulation.Blood. 2005; 106: 1604-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 19Parolini I. Federici C. Raggi C. Lugini L. Palleschi S. De Milito A. Coscia C. Iessi E. Logozzi M. Molinari A. Colone M. Tatti M. Sargiacomo M. Fais S. Microenvironmental pH is a key factor for exosome traffic in tumour cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 34211-34222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). Here, exosomes displayed time and concentration-dependent uptake kinetics (Fig. 1, E and F), and incubation at 4 °C efficiently attenuated uptake, suggesting an energy-dependent process rather than passive membrane passage (Fig. 1G). Further, several normal and transformed cell-lines were able to internalize exosomes at significant levels (Fig. 1H), which argues against that exosome transfer is restricted to specific cell-types as has previously been suggested (17Feng D. Zhao W.L. Ye Y.Y. Bai X.C. Liu R.Q. Chang L.F. Zhou Q. Sui S.F. Cellular internalization of exosomes occurs through phagocytosis.Traffic. 2010; 11: 675-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Live confocal imaging with tubulin-GFP-expressing cells revealed that internalized exosomes travel along microtubules following their uptake (Fig. 1I and supplemental video S2). The mobility of internalized exosomes was substantially reduced by interference with microtubule polymerization using nocodazole (Fig. 1J and supplemental videos S3 and S4). Importantly, under these conditions nocodazole had no unspecific effect on cell viability (Fig. 1K). These data are consistent with an endocytic process rather than membrane fusion as exosomes followed a time, concentration, and temperature-dependent pathway. The fact that disruption of microtubule attenuated intracellular exosome transport further indicates that exosomes are not fused with the plasma membrane, but rather are dependent on the regular endosomal transportation machinery for further intracellular sorting. To corroborate these data, tissue factor (TF), previously shown to reside in GBM cell-derived exosomes while absent in HUVECs (20Svensson K.J. Kucharzewska P. Christianson H.C. Sköld S. Löfstedt T. Johansson M.C. Mörgelin M. Bengzon J. Ruf W. Belting M. Hypoxia triggers a proangiogenic pathway involving cancer cell microvesicles and PAR-2-mediated heparin-binding EGF signaling in endothelial cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Immunolabeling for TF demonstrated that internalized exosomes are enclosed in double membrane structures and do not merge with the plasma membrane of recipient HUVECs (Fig. 1L). Exosomes were shown to be sorted to larger compartments positive for the MVB marker TSG101 (tumor susceptibility gene 101 protein) (22Katzmann D.J. Odorizzi G. Emr S.D. Receptor downregulation and multivesicular-body sorting.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 893-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1M). In further support of the sorting of endocytosed exosomes to MVBs, a substantial fraction of internalized vesicles were located in a CD63 (LAMP-3, Tspn30)-positive compartment (Fig. 1N). Experiments with exosomes derived from CD63-GFP transfected cells pre-incubated with PKH-labeled exosomes, suggested that mixing of exosomal constituents can occur during maturation in MVBs, resulting in the generation of compound vesicles (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). However, siRNA-mediated knockdown of CD63 or antibody-mediated cell-surface blocking of CD63 did not significantly affect exosome uptake (supplemental Fig. S1, C–E). These results, and the fact that exosomes did not colocalize with CD63 at short incubation times (Fig. 1O), suggest that although exosomes are sorted to CD63-positive vesicles in recipient cells, CD63 has no direct role in the endocytic uptake of exosomes. We next sought to define the distinct, cellular pathways associated with the endocytic uptake of exosomes. We found no colocalization of exosomes either with transferrin (Tfn) or acetylated LDL (Fig. 2A), i.e. conventional ligands of classical, clathrin-dependent endocytosis (2Doherty G.J. McMahon H.T.

https://openalex.org/W2093320042,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pif1 helicase is the prototypical member of the Pif1 DNA helicase family, which is conserved from bacteria to humans. Here we show that exceptionally potent G-quadruplex unwinding is conserved among Pif1 helicases. Moreover, Pif1 helicases from organisms separated by more than 3 billion years of evolution suppressed DNA damage at G-quadruplex motifs in yeast. The G-quadruplex-induced damage generated in the absence of Pif1 helicases led to new genetic and epigenetic changes. Furthermore, when expressed in yeast, human PIF1 suppressed both G-quadruplex-associated DNA damage and telomere lengthening. In vitro and in vivo, the yeast Pif1 helicase is able to unwind four-stranded G-quadruplex (G4) DNA efficiently and suppress the genomic instability that occurs at such structures; these G4 maintenance activities are conserved among evolutionarily diverse Pif1 family helicases, including human PIF1, demonstrating the importance of this activity throughout evolution. Pif1 family DNA helicases are highly conserved, from bacteria to humans. Virginia Zakian and colleagues show that in yeast, human PIF1 can unwind a four-stranded structure known as a G-quadruplex. In doing so, it suppresses the genomic instability that arises at such structures. The ability of the human protein to complement in yeast demonstrates the importance of this activity throughout evolution. In addition, this instability is associated with a previously unrecognized type of complex genetic–epigenetic event."
https://openalex.org/W2095324134,"Bacterial biofilms are surface-associated, multicellular, morphologically complex microbial communities. Biofilm-forming bacteria such as the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa are phenotypically distinct from their free-swimming, planktonic counterparts. Much work has focused on factors affecting surface adhesion, and it is known that P. aeruginosa secretes the Psl exopolysaccharide, which promotes surface attachment by acting as 'molecular glue'. However, how individual surface-attached bacteria self-organize into microcolonies, the first step in communal biofilm organization, is not well understood. Here we identify a new role for Psl in early biofilm development using a massively parallel cell-tracking algorithm to extract the motility history of every cell on a newly colonized surface. By combining this technique with fluorescent Psl staining and computer simulations, we show that P. aeruginosa deposits a trail of Psl as it moves on a surface, which influences the surface motility of subsequent cells that encounter these trails and thus generates positive feedback. Both experiments and simulations indicate that the web of secreted Psl controls the distribution of surface visit frequencies, which can be approximated by a power law. This Pareto-type behaviour indicates that the bacterial community self-organizes in a manner analogous to a capitalist economic system, a 'rich-get-richer' mechanism of Psl accumulation that results in a small number of 'elite' cells becoming extremely enriched in communally produced Psl. Using engineered strains with inducible Psl production, we show that local Psl concentrations determine post-division cell fates and that high local Psl concentrations ultimately allow elite cells to serve as the founding population for initial microcolony development."
https://openalex.org/W2169910634,"There is strong circumstantial evidence that certain heavy, unstable atomic nuclei are ‘octupole deformed’, that is, distorted into a pear shape. This contrasts with the more prevalent rugby-ball shape of nuclei with reflection-symmetric, quadrupole deformations. The elusive octupole deformed nuclei are of importance for nuclear structure theory, and also in searches for physics beyond the standard model; any measurable electric-dipole moment (a signature of the latter) is expected to be amplified in such nuclei. Here we determine electric octupole transition strengths (a direct measure of octupole correlations) for short-lived isotopes of radon and radium. Coulomb excitation experiments were performed using accelerated beams of heavy, radioactive ions. Our data on 220Rn and 224Ra show clear evidence for stronger octupole deformation in the latter. The results enable discrimination between differing theoretical approaches to octupole correlations, and help to constrain suitable candidates for experimental studies of atomic electric-dipole moments that might reveal extensions to the standard model. An experimental study of certain short-lived isotopes of radon and radium has found clear octupole deformation in the nuclei of the latter — that is, these nuclei are pear-shaped; the results enable discrimination between differing theoretical approaches to octupole correlations. The atomic nucleus is a many-body quantum system with a shape determined by the number of nucleons that it contains and the interactions between them. Most of the several thousand known stable and radioactive atomic nuclei, with differing numbers of protons and neutrons, are spherical or rugby-ball shaped. But there is circumstantial evidence that some heavy, unstable nuclides are distorted into a pear shape through the phenomenon of octupole deformation. Samples of these rare atomic species can be accelerated to 8% of the speed of light in the REX-ISOLDE facility at CERN, and now Coulomb excitation experiments on beams of the short-lived isotopes radium-224 and radon-220 have demonstrated clear octupole deformation in the former. The results make it possible to discriminate between the various theoretical models of octupole-deformed nuclei, and are also relevant to the pursuit of physics beyond the Standard Model."
https://openalex.org/W1605851537,"Most herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) reactivations in humans are subclinical and associated with rapid expansion and containment of virus. Previous studies have shown that CD8(+) T cells persist in genital skin and mucosa at the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ)--the portal of neuronal release of reactivating virus--for prolonged time periods after herpes lesions are cleared. The phenotype and function of this persistent CD8(+) T-cell population remain unknown. Here, using cell-type-specific laser capture microdissection, transcriptional profiling and T-cell antigen receptor β-chain (TCRβ) genotyping on sequential genital skin biopsies, we show that CD8αα(+) T cells are the dominant resident population of DEJ CD8(+) T cells that persist at the site of previous HSV-2 reactivation. CD8αα(+) T cells located at the DEJ lack chemokine-receptor expression required for lymphocyte egress and recirculation, express gene signatures of T-cell activation and antiviral activity, and produce cytolytic granules during clinical and virological quiescent time periods. Sequencing of the TCR β-chain repertoire reveals that the DEJ CD8αα(+) T cells are oligoclonal with diverse usage of TCR variable-β genes, which differ from those commonly described for mucosa-associated invariant T cells and natural killer T cells. Dominant clonotypes are shown to overlap among multiple recurrences over a period of two-and-a-half years. Episodes of rapid asymptomatic HSV-2 containment were also associated with a high CD8 effector-to-target ratio and focal enrichment of CD8αα(+) T cells. These studies indicate that DEJ CD8αα(+) T cells are tissue-resident cells that seem to have a fundamental role in immune surveillance and in initial containment of HSV-2 reactivation in human peripheral tissue. Elicitation of CD8αα(+) T cells may be a critical component for developing effective vaccines against skin and mucosal infections."
https://openalex.org/W2043143266,"A model of the four main outlet glaciers that drain the Greenland Ice Sheet predicts that they will contribute 19 to 30 millimetres to sea-level rise by 2200 in a mid-range future warming scenario, and 29 to 49 millimetres in a more extreme scenario. Recent dramatic acceleration of ice loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet has raised concerns about the possibility of runaway ice loss and consequent sea-level rise. Now Faezeh Nick and colleagues simulate the dynamics of ice movement for four of Greenland's largest outlet glaciers to 2200 using a model that takes account of the complicated dynamics that operate at the ice–ocean interface, such as calving and submarine melting. They find that in spite of several bursts of retreat, the current rate of acceleration of ice loss is unlikely to continue. This suggests that the contribution of the Greenland Ice Sheet to sea-level rise is likely to be considerably less than the upper limit of previous estimates. Over the past decade, ice loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet increased as a result of both increased surface melting and ice discharge to the ocean1,2. The latter is controlled by the acceleration of ice flow and subsequent thinning of fast-flowing marine-terminating outlet glaciers3. Quantifying the future dynamic contribution of such glaciers to sea-level rise (SLR) remains a major challenge because outlet glacier dynamics are poorly understood4. Here we present a glacier flow model that includes a fully dynamic treatment of marine termini. We use this model to simulate behaviour of four major marine-terminating outlet glaciers, which collectively drain about 22 per cent of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Using atmospheric and oceanic forcing from a mid-range future warming scenario that predicts warming by 2.8 degrees Celsius by 2100, we project a contribution of 19 to 30 millimetres to SLR from these glaciers by 2200. This contribution is largely (80 per cent) dynamic in origin and is caused by several episodic retreats past overdeepenings in outlet glacier troughs. After initial increases, however, dynamic losses from these four outlets remain relatively constant and contribute to SLR individually at rates of about 0.01 to 0.06 millimetres per year. These rates correspond to ice fluxes that are less than twice those of the late 1990s, well below previous upper bounds5. For a more extreme future warming scenario (warming by 4.5 degrees Celsius by 2100), the projected losses increase by more than 50 per cent, producing a cumulative SLR of 29 to 49 millimetres by 2200."

https://openalex.org/W1964216370,"Molten oxide electrolysis (MOE) is an electrometallurgical technique that enables the direct production of metal in the liquid state from oxide feedstock, and compared with traditional methods of extractive metallurgy offers both a substantial simplification of the process and a significant reduction in energy consumption. MOE is also considered a promising route for mitigation of CO2 emissions in steelmaking, production of metals free of carbon, and generation of oxygen for extra-terrestrial exploration. Until now, MOE has been demonstrated using anode materials that are consumable (graphite for use with ferro-alloys and titanium) or unaffordable for terrestrial applications (iridium for use with iron). To enable metal production without process carbon, MOE requires an anode material that resists depletion while sustaining oxygen evolution. The challenges for iron production are threefold. First, the process temperature is in excess of 1,538 degrees Celsius (ref. 10). Second, under anodic polarization most metals inevitably corrode in such conditions. Third, iron oxide undergoes spontaneous reduction on contact with most refractory metals and even carbon. Here we show that anodes comprising chromium-based alloys exhibit limited consumption during iron extraction and oxygen evolution by MOE. The anode stability is due to the formation of an electronically conductive solid solution of chromium(iii) and aluminium oxides in the corundum structure. These findings make practicable larger-scale evaluation of MOE for the production of steel, and potentially provide a key material component enabling mitigation of greenhouse-gas emissions while producing metal of superior metallurgical quality."
https://openalex.org/W1966516959,"P-glycoprotein (Pgp) is one of the most biomedically relevant transporters in the ATP binding cassette (ABC) superfamily due to its involvement in developing multidrug resistance in cancer cells. Employing molecular dynamics simulations and double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy, we have investigated the structural dynamics of membrane-bound Pgp in the inward-facing state and found that Pgp adopts an unexpectedly wide range of conformations, highlighted by the degree of separation between the two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs). The distance between the two NBDs in the equilibrium simulations covers a range of at least 20 Å, including, both, more open and more closed NBD configurations than the crystal structure. The double electron-electron resonance measurements on spin-labeled Pgp mutants also show wide distributions covering both longer and shorter distances than those observed in the crystal structure. Based on structural and sequence analyses, we propose that the transmembrane domains of Pgp might be more flexible than other structurally known ABC exporters. The structural flexibility of Pgp demonstrated here is not only in close agreement with, but also helps rationalize, the reported high NBD fluctuations in several ABC exporters and possibly represents a fundamental difference in the transport mechanism between ABC exporters and ABC importers. In addition, during the simulations we have captured partial entrance of a lipid molecule from the bilayer into the lumen of Pgp, reaching the putative drug binding site. The location of the protruding lipid suggests a putative pathway for direct drug recruitment from the membrane."

Sirtuin 6, or SIRT6, has recently been identified as a critical regulator of transcription, genome stability, telomere integrity, DNA repair, and metabolic homeostasis. A knockout mouse model of SIRT6 has displayed dramatic phenotypes of accelerated aging. In keeping with its role in aging, we demonstrated that human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) from older human subjects were more resistant to reprogramming by classic Yamanaka factors than those from younger human subjects, but the addition of SIRT6 during reprogramming improved such efficiency in older HDFs substantially. Despite the importance of SIRT6, little is known about the molecular mechanism of its regulation. We show, for the first, time posttranscriptional regulation of SIRT6 by miR-766 and inverse correlation in the expression of this microRNA in HDFs from different age groups. Our results suggest that SIRT6 regulates miR-766 transcription via a feedback regulatory loop, which has implications for the modulation of SIRT6 expression in reprogramming of aging cells."

Morphine exposure is known to induce apoptosis, down regulate cAMP response element-binding (CREB) expression and decrease in dendritic branching and spine density in cultured cells. Use of neuroprotective agent; brain derived neurotropic factor (BDNF), which protects neurons against these effects, could be of therapeutic benefit in the treatment of opiate addiction. Previous studies have shown that BDNF was not transported through the blood brain barrier (BBB) in-vivo.; and hence it is not effective in-vivo. Therefore development of a drug delivery system that can cross BBB may have significant therapeutic advantage. In the present study, we hypothesized that magnetically guided nanocarrier may provide a viable approach for targeting BDNF across the BBB. We developed a magnetic nanoparticle (MNP) based carrier bound to BDNF and evaluated its efficacy and ability to transmigrate across the BBB using an in-vitro BBB model. The end point determinations of BDNF that crossed BBB were apoptosis, CREB expression and dendritic spine density measurement. We found that transmigrated BDNF was effective in suppressing the morphine induced apoptosis, inducing CREB expression and restoring the spine density. Our results suggest that the developed nanocarrier will provide a potential therapeutic approach to treat opiate addiction, protect neurotoxicity and synaptic density degeneration."

https://openalex.org/W2074465939,"Antidepressants represent the standard treatment for major depression. However, their efficacy is variable and incomplete. A growing number of studies suggest that the environment plays a major role in determining the efficacy of these drugs, specifically of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). A recent hypothesis posits that the increase in serotonin levels induced by SSRI may not affect mood per se, but enhances neural plasticity and, consequently, renders the individual more susceptible to the influence of the environment. Thus, SSRI administration in a favorable environment would lead to a reduction of symptoms, while in a stressful environment might lead to a worse prognosis. To test this hypothesis, we treated C57BL/6 adult male mice with chronic fluoxetine while exposing them to either (i) an enriched environment, after exposure to a chronic stress period aimed at inducing a depression-like phenotype, or (ii) a stressful environment. Anhedonia, brain BDNF and circulating corticosterone levels, considered endophenotypes of depression, were investigated. Mice treated with fluoxetine in an enriched condition improved their depression-like phenotype compared to controls, displaying higher saccharin preference, higher brain BDNF levels and reduced corticosterone levels. By contrast, when chronic fluoxetine administration occurred in a stressful condition, mice showed a more distinct worsening of the depression-like profile, displaying a faster decrease of saccharin preference, lower brain BDNF levels and increased corticosterone levels. Our findings suggest that the effect of SSRI on depression-like phenotypes in mice is not determined by the drug per se but is induced by the drug and driven by the environment. These findings may be helpful to explain variable effects of SSRI found in clinical practice and to device strategies aimed at enhancing their efficacy by means of controlling environmental conditions."

In the endosome, bacteria are generally recognized by TLRs; facultative intracellular bacteria such as Listeria, however, can escape the endosome. Once in the cytosol, they become accessible to cytosolic pattern recognition receptors, which recognize components of the bacterial cell wall, metabolites or bacterial nucleic acids and initiate an immune response in the host cell. Current knowledge has been focused on the type I IFN response to Listeria DNA or Listeria-derived second messenger c-di-AMP via the signaling adaptor STING. Our study focused on the recognition of Listeria RNA in the cytosol. With the aid of a novel labeling technique, we have been able to visualize immediate cytosolic delivery of Listeria RNA upon infection. Infection with Listeria as well as transfection of bacterial RNA induced a type-I-IFN response in human monocytes, epithelial cells or hepatocytes. However, in contrast to monocytes, the type-I-IFN response of epithelial cells and hepatocytes was not triggered by bacterial DNA, indicating a STING-independent Listeria recognition pathway. RIG-I and MAVS knock-down resulted in abolishment of the IFN response in epithelial cells, but the IFN response in monocytic cells remained unaffected. By contrast, knockdown of STING in monocytic cells reduced cytosolic Listeria-mediated type-I-IFN induction. Our results show that detection of Listeria RNA by RIG-I represents a non-redundant cytosolic immunorecognition pathway in non-immune cells lacking a functional STING dependent signaling pathway."

In this study, we have identified a stretch of 23 amino acids within the C-terminal domain of p120 catenin as the minimal sequence responsible for the recruitment of p190RhoGAP (herein referred to as CRAD; catenin-RhoGAP association domain). Expression of the p120-catenin truncated mutant lacking the CRAD in endothelial cells attenuated effects of barrier protective oxidized phospholipid, OxPAPC.

In this study, we estimated the rate of copper transport by the hCTR1 trimer in cultured cells using (64)Cu uptake assays and quantification of plasma membrane hCTR1. For endogenous hCTR1, we estimated a turnover number of about 10 ions/trimer/s. When overexpressed in HEK293 cells, a second transmembrane domain mutant of hCTR1 (H139R) had a 3-fold higher Km value and a 4-fold higher turnover number than WT. Truncations of the intracellular C-terminal tail and an AAA substitution of the putative metal-binding HCH C-terminal tripeptide (thought to be required for transport) also exhibited elevated transport rates and Km values when compared with WT hCTR1. Unlike WT hCTR1, H139R and the C-terminal mutants did not undergo regulatory endocytosis in elevated copper. hCTR1 mutants combining methionine substitutions that block transport (M150L,M154L) on the extracellular side of the pore and the high transport H139R or AAA intracellular side mutations exhibited the blocked transport of M150L,M154L, confirming that Cu(+) first interacts with the methionines during permeation. Our results show that hCTR1 elements on the intracellular side of the hCTR1 pore, including the carboxyl tail, are not essential for permeation, but serve to regulate the rate of copper entry."

New data at higher resolution provide a more detailed view of this gas. About half is present as clouds, with the remainder distributed in an extended, diffuse component. The authors propose that the clouds form as transient condensations of gas embedded in an intergalactic filament, and are therefore a potential source of fuel for future star formation in M31 and M33. Spiral galaxies must acquire gas to maintain their observed level of star formation beyond the next few billion years1. A source of this material may be the gas that resides between galaxies, but our understanding of the state and distribution of this gas is incomplete2. Radio observations3 of the Local Group of galaxies have revealed hydrogen gas extending from the disk of the galaxy M31 at least halfway to M33. This feature has been interpreted to be the neutral component of a condensing intergalactic filament4, which would be able to fuel star formation in M31 and M33, but simulations suggest that such a feature could also result from an interaction between both galaxies within the past few billion years (ref. 5). Here we report radio observations showing that about 50 per cent of this gas is composed of clouds, with the rest distributed in an extended, diffuse component. The clouds have velocities comparable to those of M31 and M33, and have properties suggesting that they are unrelated to other Local Group objects. We conclude that the clouds are likely to be transient condensations of gas embedded in an intergalactic filament and are therefore a potential source of fuel for future star formation in M31 and M33."
https://openalex.org/W2014054924,"Borrelia burgdorferi spirochetes that cause Lyme borreliosis survive for a long time in human serum because they successfully evade the complement system, an important arm of innate immunity. The outer surface protein E (OspE) of B. burgdorferi is needed for this because it recruits complement regulator factor H (FH) onto the bacterial surface to evade complement-mediated cell lysis. To understand this process at the molecular level, we used a structural approach. First, we solved the solution structure of OspE by NMR, revealing a fold that has not been seen before in proteins involved in complement regulation. Next, we solved the x-ray structure of the complex between OspE and the FH C-terminal domains 19 and 20 (FH19-20) at 2.83 Å resolution. The structure shows that OspE binds FH19-20 in a way similar to, but not identical with, that used by endothelial cells to bind FH via glycosaminoglycans. The observed interaction of OspE with FH19-20 allows the full function of FH in down-regulation of complement activation on the bacteria. This reveals the molecular basis for how B. burgdorferi evades innate immunity and suggests how OspE could be used as a potential vaccine antigen."

https://openalex.org/W2154581480,"CCN3, a member of the CCN protein family, inhibits osteoblast differentiation in vitro. However, the role of CCN3 in bone regeneration has not been well elucidated. In this study, we investigated the role of CCN3 in bone regeneration. We identified the Ccn3 gene by microarray analysis as a highly expressed gene at the early phase of bone regeneration in a mouse bone regeneration model. We confirmed the up-regulation of Ccn3 at the early phase of bone regeneration by RT-PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence analyses. Ccn3 transgenic mice, in which Ccn3 expression was driven by 2.3-kb Col1a1 promoter, showed osteopenia compared with wild-type mice, but Ccn3 knock-out mice showed no skeletal changes compared with wild-type mice. We analyzed the bone regeneration process in Ccn3 transgenic mice and Ccn3 knock-out mice by microcomputed tomography and histological analyses. Bone regeneration in Ccn3 knock-out mice was accelerated compared with that in wild-type mice. The mRNA expression levels of osteoblast-related genes (Runx2, Sp7, Col1a1, Alpl, and Bglap) in Ccn3 knock-out mice were up-regulated earlier than those in wild-type mice, as demonstrated by RT-PCR. Bone regeneration in Ccn3 transgenic mice showed no significant changes compared with that in wild-type mice. Phosphorylation of Smad1/5 was highly up-regulated at bone regeneration sites in Ccn3 KO mice compared with wild-type mice. These results indicate that CCN3 is up-regulated in the early phase of bone regeneration and acts as a negative regulator for bone regeneration.

https://openalex.org/W2044043800,"Burkholderia cepacia complex and Burkholderia pseudomallei are opportunistic human pathogens. Resistance to β-lactams among Burkholderia spp. is attributable to expression of β-lactamases (e.g. PenA in B. cepacia complex and PenI in B. pseudomallei). Phylogenetic comparisons reveal that PenA and PenI are highly related. However, the analyses presented here reveal that PenA is an inhibitor-resistant carbapenemase, most similar to KPC-2 (the most clinically significant serine carbapenemase), whereas PenI is an extended spectrum β-lactamase. PenA hydrolyzes β-lactams with kcat values ranging from 0.38 ± 0.04 to 460 ± 46 s−1 and possesses high kcat/kinact values of 2000, 1500, and 75 for β-lactamase inhibitors. PenI demonstrates the highest kcat value for cefotaxime of 9.0 ± 0.9 s−1. Crystal structure determination of PenA and PenI reveals important differences that aid in understanding their contrasting phenotypes. Changes in the positioning of conserved catalytic residues (e.g. Lys-73, Ser-130, and Tyr-105) as well as altered anchoring and decreased occupancy of the deacylation water explain the lower kcat values of PenI. The crystal structure of PenA with imipenem docked into the active site suggests why this carbapenem is hydrolyzed and the important role of Arg-220, which was functionally confirmed by mutagenesis and biochemical characterization. Conversely, the conformation of Tyr-105 hindered docking of imipenem into the active site of PenI. The structural and biochemical analyses of PenA and PenI provide key insights into the hydrolytic mechanisms of β-lactamases, which can lead to the rational design of novel agents against these pathogens.Background: Resistance to β-lactams in Burkholderia is mediated by different β-lactamases (e.g. PenA and PenI).Results: PenA from B. multivorans is a carbapenemase, and PenI from B. pseudomallei is an extended-spectrum enzyme.Conclusion: Subtle changes within the active site of β-lactamases result in major phenotypic changes.Significance: Future antibiotic design must consider the distinctive phenotypes of PenA and PenI β-lactamases.

Burkholderia cepacia complex is group of highly diverse bacteria that includes 17 different species (1Mahenthiralingam E. Vandamme P.

B. cepacia complexes are typically found in soil, water, and the rhizosphere of crop plants (i.e. rice and wheat) and are used in both bioremediation and as biopestidicides. Unique among prokaryotes, B. cepacia complex has a large complex genome of seven megabases with three chromosomes and a plasmid (3Mahenthiralingam E. Baldwin A. Dowson C.G.

In addition, B. cepacia complex is notorious for causing respiratory infections in cystic fibrosis patients, who received prolonged courses of broad spectrum antibiotics (1Mahenthiralingam E. Vandamme P. Taxonomy and pathogenesis of the Burkholderia cepacia complex.Chron. Respir. Dis. 2005; 2: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). As a result, B. cepacia complex is inherently resistant to multiple antibiotics. Adding to this, B. cepacia complex possesses many mobile genetic elements and genomic islands that were acquired through horizontal transfer (18Holden M.T. Seth-Smith H.M. Crossman L.C. Sebaihia M.

Burkholderia pseudomallei is an intracellular pathogen and the causative agent of melioidosis (i.e. Whitmore disease) (19Larsen J.C. Johnson N.H. Pathogenesis of Burkholderia pseudomallei and Burkholderia mallei.Mil. Med. 2009; 174: 647-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This pathogen is also found in water and soil and is spread to humans and animals through direct contact with these sources. B. pseudomallei has the potential to be used in biological warfare and bioterrorism. Primary routes of infection by B. pseudomallei include inhalation, aspiration, and percutaneous inoculation. Moreover, the bacterium can persist for long periods (years) in low nutrient environments (20Lazar Adler N.R. Govan B. Cullinane M. Harper M. Adler B. Boyce J.D.

Melioidosis is predominantly a disease of tropical climates, such as Southeast Asia and Northern Australia (22Wooten M.D. Panwalker A.P.

B. multivorans and B. pseudomallei possess related β-lactamases, PenA and PenI, respectively, that share 71% similarity and 62% identity (34Poirel L. Rodriguez-Martinez J.M. Plésiat P. Nordmann P. Naturally occurring class A β-lactamases from the Burkholderia cepacia complex.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2009; 53: 876-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). At present, β-lactamases (EC 3.5.2.6) are classified into four different classes based on structural similarities (A–D) (35Bush K. Jacoby G.A. Updated functional classification of β-lactamases.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2010; 54: 969-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar). Class A, C, and D β-lactamases use a serine (e.g. Ser-70 in class A enzymes; Ambler amino acid-numbering scheme (35Bush K. Jacoby G.A. Updated functional classification of β-lactamases.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2010; 54: 969-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar)), as the nucleophile, and class B β-lactamases are metalloenzymes using one or two Zn2+ ions for catalysis. PenA and PenI are class A β-lactamases. In general, class A β-lactamases hydrolyze β-lactams through the reaction mechanism represented in Fig. 1. Here, we use biochemical assays, crystallography, and molecular modeling to dissect the hydrolytic mechanisms of PenA and PenI. Understanding how β-lactamases interact with their target ligand, β-lactams, is critical for devising strategies to circumvent them and treat infections by these drug-resistant and virulent pathogens.

The blaPenA gene was obtained by PCR of genomic DNA isolated from B. multivorans ATCC 17616. The blaPenI gene was a kind gift from Dr. Herbert P. Schweizer (Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO). The full-length blaPenA and blaPenI genes were cloned into the pET24a(+) plasmid using NdeI and BamHI restriction sites. Both genes were subsequently subcloned from the pET24a(+) plasmid into pBC SK(+) phagemid, including the ribosome-binding site of pET24a(+) (pBC SK(+) lacks a ribosome-binding site) by using SacII and BamHI restriction sites for blaPenA and SacI and BamHI restriction sites for blaPenI. The blaPenA gene minus the first 81 nucleotides, which encode the signal peptide for PenA, was cloned into the pGEX-6p-2 using the BamHI and XhoI restriction sites with a glutathione S-transferase gene at the 5′ end of the gene. The blaPenI gene minus the first 90 nucleotides, which encode its signal peptide, was cloned into the pET24a(+) plasmid using the NdeI and BamHI restriction sites. blaPenA and blaPenI genes cloned into pBC SK(+) phagemid were expressed in Escherichia coli DH10B cells for susceptibility testing. The blaPenA gene (Δ1–81) cloned into the pGEX-6p-2 and the blaPenI gene (Δ1–90) cloned into the pET24a(+) plasmid were expressed in E. coli Origami 2 DE3 cells for protein purification.

PenA and PenI were crystallized by the vapor diffusion method using a 250-μl reservoir with a 4-μl hanging drop (2 μl reservoir solution + 2 μl protein solution). For PenA, the well solution contained 25% polyethylene glycol of 8 kilodaltons (PEG8K), 0.2 m sodium chloride, 0.1 m sodium phosphate/citric acid at pH 4.2 and 15 mg/ml of PenA in 2 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. Two successful conditions were obtained for PenI, one at pH 7.5 and the other at pH 9.5. One well solution contained 25% PEG8K, 0.1 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, and 10 mg/ml protein in 2 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and the second contained 25% PEG8K, 0.1 m N-cyclohexyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid, pH 9.5 (reservoir), and 10 mg/ml protein in 2 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. Crystals appeared in 1–2 weeks reaching sizes of 0.4–0.8 mm. The crystals were cryoprotected by dipping them into a reservoir solution containing 20% glycerol, flush-cooled, and kept at 100 K with a nitrogen gas stream. The 0.5° oscillation images were collected on a Q270 CCD detector with synchrotron radiation (λ = 1.00 Å at beamline NE3A of the Advanced Ring of the Photon Factory, Tsukuba, Japan).

https://openalex.org/W2044416158,"Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) is a promyelinating trophic factor, and the mechanisms by which CNTF expression could be increased in the brain are poorly understood. Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is one of the most widely used analgesics. Interestingly, aspirin increased mRNA and protein expression of CNTF in primary mouse and human astrocytes in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Aspirin induced the activation of protein kinase A (PKA) but not protein kinase C (PKC). H-89, an inhibitor of PKA, abrogated aspirin-induced expression of CNTF. The activation of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB), but not NF-κB, by aspirin, the abrogation of aspirin-induced expression of CNTF by siRNA knockdown of CREB, the presence of a consensus cAMP-response element in the promoter of CNTF, and the recruitment of CREB and CREB-binding protein to the CNTF promoter by aspirin suggest that aspirin increases the expression of the Cntf gene via the activation of CREB. Furthermore, we demonstrate that aspirin-induced astroglial CNTF was also functionally active and that supernatants of aspirin-treated astrocytes of wild type, but not Cntf null, mice increased myelin-associated proteins in oligodendrocytes and protected oligodendrocytes from TNF-α insult. These results highlight a new and novel myelinogenic property of aspirin, which may be of benefit for multiple sclerosis and other demyelinating disorders."

Mice null for LFABP were recently shown to have altered metabolism of not only fatty acids but also monoacylglycerol, the two major products of dietary triacylglycerol hydrolysis (Lagakos, W. S., Gajda, A. M., Agellon, L., Binas, B., Choi, V., Mandap, B., Russnak, T., Zhou, Y. X., and Storch, J. (2011) Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 300, G803-G814). Nevertheless, the binding and transport of monoacylglycerol (MG) by LFABP are uncertain, with conflicting reports in the literature as to whether this single chain amphiphile is in fact bound by LFABP. In the present studies, gel filtration chromatography of liver cytosol from LFABP(-/-) mice shows the absence of the low molecular weight peak of radiolabeled monoolein present in the fractions that contain LFABP in cytosol from wild type mice, indicating that LFABP binds sn-2 MG in vivo. Furthermore, solution-state NMR spectroscopy demonstrates two molecules of sn-2 monoolein bound in the LFABP binding pocket in positions similar to those found for oleate binding. Equilibrium binding affinities are ∼2-fold lower for MG compared with fatty acid. Finally, kinetic studies examining the transfer of a fluorescent MG analog show that the rate of transfer of MG is 7-fold faster from LFABP to phospholipid membranes than from membranes to membranes and occurs by an aqueous diffusion mechanism. These results provide strong support for monoacylglycerol as a physiological ligand for LFABP and further suggest that LFABP functions in the efficient intracellular transport of MG."

https://openalex.org/W2128140075,"Myosin binding protein C (MyBP-C) is expressed in striated muscles, where it plays key roles in the modulation of actomyosin cross-bridges. Slow MyBP-C (sMyBP-C) consists of multiple variants sharing common domains but also containing unique segments within the NH2 and COOH termini. Two missense mutations in the NH2 terminus (W236R) and COOH terminus (Y856H) of sMyBP-C have been causally linked to the development of distal arthrogryposis-1 (DA-1), a severe skeletal muscle disorder. Using a combination of in vitro binding and motility assays, we show that the COOH terminus mediates binding of sMyBP-C to thick filaments, while the NH2 terminus modulates the formation of actomyosin cross-bridges in a variant-specific manner. Consistent with this, a recombinant NH2-terminal peptide that excludes residues 34-59 reduces the sliding velocity of actin filaments past myosin heads from 9.0 ± 1.3 to 5.7 ± 1.0 μm/s at 0.1 μM, while a recombinant peptide that excludes residues 21-59 fails to do so. Notably, the actomyosin regulatory properties of sMyBP-C are completely abolished by the presence of the DA-1 mutations. In summary, our studies are the first to show that the NH2 and COOH termini of sMyBP-C have distinct functions, which are regulated by differential splicing, and are compromized by the presence of missense point mutations linked to muscle disease.—Ackermann, M.

The in vitro phenotypes were recapitulated in ex vivo assays measuring both p53 transactivation function and the direct p53-HDM2 interaction in the presence of Nutlin. Mutations conferring drug resistance were not confined to the N-terminal p53/Nutlin-binding domain, and were additionally seen in the acidic, zinc finger and RING domains.

https://openalex.org/W2061967711,"Genetic approaches (e.g. mutation, RNA interference) in model organisms, particularly the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, have yielded a wealth of information on cellular processes that can influence lifespan. Although longevity mutants discovered in the lab are instructive of cellular physiology, lab studies might miss important genes that influence health and longevity in the wild. C. elegans has relatively low natural genetic variation and high levels of linkage disequilibrium, and thus is not optimal for studying natural variation in longevity. In contrast, its close relative C. remanei possesses very high levels of molecular genetic variation and low levels of linkage disequilibrium. To determine whether C. remanei may be a good model system for the study of natural genetic variation in aging, we evaluated levels of quantitative genetic variation for longevity and resistance to oxidative, heat and UV stress. Heritability (and the coefficient of additive genetic variation) was high for oxidative and heat stress resistance, low (but significant) for longevity, and essentially zero for UV stress response. Our results suggest that C. remanei may be a powerful system for studying natural genetic variation for longevity and oxidative and heat stress response, as well as an informative model for the study of functional relationships between longevity and stress response."

The cell surface expression and N-glycan processing of various substitution mutants or chimeras of human and bovine AE1 proteins and their Δ11 mutants in HEK293 cells were examined. The N-terminal sequence (V/L/F)X(I/L)X(M/L), (26)VSIPM(30) in bovine AE1, which is comparable with ΦXΦXΦ, acted as the ER export signal for AE1 and AE1Δ11 (Φ is a hydrophobic amino acid, and X is any amino acid). The AE1-Ly49E chimeric protein possessing the ΦXΦXΦ motif exhibited effective cell surface expression and N-glycan maturation via the coatomer protein complex II pathway, whereas a chimera lacking this motif was retained in the ER. A synthetic polypeptide containing the N terminus of bovine AE1 bound the Sec23A-Sec24C complex through a selective interaction with Sec24C. Co-transfection of Sec24C-AAA, in which the residues (895)LIL(897) (the binding site for another ER export signal motif IXM on Sec24C and Sec24D) were mutated to (895)AAA(897), specifically increased ER retention of the AE1-Ly49E chimera. These findings demonstrate that the ΦXΦXΦ sequence functions as a novel signal motif for the ER export of cargo proteins through an exclusive interaction with Sec24C."
https://openalex.org/W1992291478,"Changes in gene expression during inflammation are in part caused by post-transcriptional mechanisms. A transcriptome-wide screen for changes in ribosome occupancy indicated that the inflammatory cytokine IL-17 activates translation of a group of mRNAs that overlaps partially with those affected similarly by IL-1. Included are mRNAs of IκBζ and of MCPIP1, important regulators of the quality and course of immune and inflammatory responses. Evidence for increased ribosome association of these mRNAs was also obtained in LPS-activated RAW264.7 macrophages and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Like IL-1, IL-17 activated translation of IκBζ mRNA by counteracting the function of a translational silencing element in its 3'-UTR defined previously. Translational silencing of MCPIP1 mRNA in unstimulated cells resulted from the combined suppressive activities of its 5'-UTR, which contains upstream open reading frames, and of its 3'-UTR, which silences independently of the 5'-UTR. Only the silencing function of the 3'-UTR was counteracted by IL-17 as well as by IL-1. Translational silencing by the 3'-UTR was dependent on a putative stem-loop-forming region previously associated with rapid degradation of the mRNA. The results suggest that translational control exerted by IL-1 and IL-17 plays an important role in the coordination of an inflammatory reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2024413980,"Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) localizes to focal adhesions (FAs) where it regulates cell spreading, migration, and growth factor receptor signaling. Previous reports showed that overexpressed ILK in which Val(386) and Thr(387) were substituted with glycine residues (ILK-VT/GG) could neither interact with paxillin nor localize to FA in cells expressing endogenous wild-type ILK, implying that paxillin binding to ILK is required for its localization to FAs. Here, we show that introducing this mutation into the germ line of mice (ILK-VT/GG) caused vasculogenesis defects, resulting in a general developmental delay and death at around embryonic day 12.5. Fibroblasts isolated from ILK-VT/GG mice contained mutant ILK in FAs, showed normal adhesion to and spreading on extracellular matrix substrates but displayed impaired migration. Biochemical analysis revealed that VT/GG substitutions decreased ILK protein stability leading to decreased ILK levels and reduced binding to paxillin and α-parvin. Because paxillin depletion did not affect ILK localization to FAs, the embryonic lethality and the in vitro migration defects are likely due to the reduced levels of ILK-VT/GG and diminished binding to parvins."
https://openalex.org/W1964767253,"A number of proteins that play key roles in cell signaling are post-translationally modified by the prenylation pathway. The final step in this pathway is methylation of the carboxyl terminus of the prenylated protein by isoprenylcysteine carboxylmethyltransferase. Due to the impact of methylation on Rho function, we sought to determine if the process was reversible and hence could control Rho function in a dynamic fashion. Elevating isoprenylcysteine carboxylmethyltransferase activity in cells has profound effects on MDA-MB-231 cell morphology, implying the presence of a pool of unmethylated prenyl proteins in these cells under normal conditions. Using a knockdown approach, we identified a specific esterase, carboxylesterase 1, whose function had a clear impact not only on the methylation status of RhoA but also RhoA activation and cell morphology. These data provide compelling evidence that C-terminal modification of prenyl proteins, rather than being purely a constitutive process, can serve as a point of regulation of function for this important class of protein."
https://openalex.org/W2016044359,"We established an automated screening method to characterize adhesion of Escherichia coli to intestinal porcine epithelial cells (IPEC-J2) and their probiotic activity against infection by enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC). 104 intestinal E. coli isolates from domestic pigs were tested by PCR for the occurrence of virulence-associated genes, genes coding for resistances to antimicrobial agents and metals, and for phylogenetic origin by PCR. Adhesion rates and probiotic activity were examined for correlation with the presence of these genes. Finally, data were compared with those from 93 E. coli isolates from wild boars. Isolates from domestic pigs carried a broad variety of all tested genes and showed great diversity in gene patterns. Adhesions varied with a maximum of 18.3 or 24.2 mean bacteria adherence per epithelial cell after 2 or 6 hours respectively. Most isolates from domestic pigs and wild boars showed low adherence, with no correlation between adhesion/probiotic activity and E. coli genes or gene clusters. The gene sfa/foc, encoding for a subunit of F1C fimbriae did show a positive correlative association with adherence and probiotic activity; however E. coli isolates from wild boars with the sfa/foc gene showed less adhesion and probiotic activity than E. coli with the sfa/foc gene isolated from domestic pigs after 6 hour incubation. In conclusion, screening porcine E. coli for virulence associated genes genes, adhesion to intestinal epithelial cells, and probiotic activity revealed a single important adhesion factor, several probiotic candidates, and showed important differences between E. coli of domestic pigs and wild boars."
https://openalex.org/W2092984930,"The angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R)-associated protein (ATRAP/Agtrap) promotes constitutive internalization of the AT1R so as to specifically inhibit the pathological activation of its downstream signaling yet preserve the base-line physiological signaling activity of the AT1R. Thus, tissue-specific regulation of Agtrap expression is relevant to the pathophysiology of cardiovascular and renal disease. However, the regulatory mechanism of Agtrap gene expression has not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, we show that the proximal promoter region from -150 to +72 of the mouse Agtrap promoter, which contains the X-box, E-box, and GC-box consensus motifs, is able to elicit substantial transcription of the Agtrap gene. Among these binding motifs, we showed that the E-box specifically binds upstream stimulatory factor (Usf) 1 and Usf2, which are known E-box-binding transcription factors. It is indicated that the E-box-Usf1/Usf2 binding regulates Agtrap expression because of the following: 1) mutation of the E-box to prevent Usf1/Usf2 binding reduces Agtrap promoter activity; 2) knockdown of Usf1 or Usf2 affects both endogenous Agtrap mRNA and Agtrap protein expression, and 3) the decrease in Agtrap mRNA expression in the afflicted kidney by unilateral ureteral obstruction is accompanied by changes in Usf1 and Usf2 mRNA. Furthermore, the results of siRNA transfection in mouse distal convoluted tubule cells and those of unilateral ureteral obstruction in the afflicted mouse kidney suggest that Usf1 decreases but Usf2 increases the Agtrap gene expression by binding to the E-box. The results also demonstrate a functional E-box-USF1/USF2 interaction in the human AGTRAP promoter, thereby suggesting that a strategy of modulating the E-box-USF1/USF2 binding has novel therapeutic potential."
https://openalex.org/W2149552056,"To date, two novel freeze-responsive proteins, Fr10 and Li16, have been discovered in the wood frog, Rana sylvatica, and likely support freezing survival. Although previous studies have established tissue distribution of each protein, there have been no studies that explore their functional consequences in intolerant cells. To assess the ability of Fr10 and Li16 to confer freeze tolerance, we transfected each protein into a freeze-intolerant silkworm cell line (BmN). Selected controls were the transfection of an unrelated protein (CAT) and a no-transfection sample. Li16 and Fr10 showed 1.8 ± 0.1- and 1.7 ± 0.2-fold, respectively, greater survival after freezing at –6°C for 1 h than did transfection controls. To investigate how these novel proteins protect cells from freezing damage, protein structures were predicted from primary amino acid sequences. Analysis of the structures indicated that Fr10 is a secreted protein and may be a new type IV antifreeze protein, whereas Li16 may have intracellular membrane associated functions. This study shows that freezing protection can be provided to intolerant cells by the overexpression of transfected Li16 and Fr10 frog proteins. Results from this study will provide new insights into adapting intolerant cells for medical organ cryoprotection using a natural vertebrate model of tolerance.—Biggar, K.

Plk1 is highly conserved and shares a nearly identical 3-D structure between zebrafish and humans. The initial 10 mitoses of zebrafish embryonic cleavages occur every∼30 minutes, and therefore provide a rapid assay to evaluate mitosis inhibitors including those targeting Plk1. To increase efficiency and specificity, we first performed a computational virtual screen of∼60000 compounds against the human Plk1 3-D structure docked to both its kinase and Polo box domain. 370 candidates with the top free-energy scores were subjected to zebrafish assay and 3 were shown to inhibit cell division. Compared to general screen for compounds inhibiting zebrafish embryonic cleavage, computation increased the efficiency by 11 folds. One of the 3 compounds, named I2, was further demonstrated to effectively inhibit multiple tumor cell proliferation in vitro and PC3 prostate cancer growth in Xenograft mouse model in vivo. Furthermore, I2 inhibited Plk1 enzyme activity in a dose dependent manner. The IC50 values of I2 in these assays are compatible to those of ON-01910, a Plk1 inhibitor currently in Phase III clinic trials. Our studies demonstrate that zebrafish assays coupled with computational screening significantly improves the efficiency of identifying specific regulators of biological targets. The PLK1 inhibitor I2, and its analogs, may have potential in cancer therapeutics."

Conclusion: The interaction dictates filament formation and formin regulation. Significance: The ionic interaction may allow allosteric communication between the filament exterior and interior. Proper cytoplasmic actin cytoskeletal function requires that actin be able to assemble reversibly into filamentous networks in a spatially and temporally controlled fashion. This regulation comes from the conformational plasticity of the actin filament itself and a series of actin-binding proteins that can control actin filament behavior. These include end-capping proteins, filament-stabilizing proteins, severing proteins, and filament-nucleating proteins. Many of these regulatory proteins work either by actively imparting changes on filament conformation or by capturing one of the multiple conformations, thereby leading to a change in behavior of the filament ensemble. Examples of proteins exerting these effects on F-actin are gelsolin (1Yin H.L. Stossel T.P.

In order to understand the molecular basis of this regulation, it is first essential that the importance of potential actin intermonomer contacts be assessed. Second, it is important that allosteric pathways within actin, through which conformational changes are propagated, be delineated. The ability to address these questions depends on the predictions of different actin filament models that have been generated. These have not been based on high resolution x-ray crystallography, because such structures of the filament are not available. Instead, these models usually involve the docking of high resolution x-ray crystal structures of the monomer into electron density envelopes obtained by optical reconstruction of filament EM density envelopes and then altering the monomer structure to obtain the best fit (8Fujii T.

Because these models are under-resolved, it is necessary to assess experimentally the importance of such hypothetical contacts on actin function. One such case is a potential cross-strand intermonomer ionic bond between Lys113 of one actin monomer and Glu195 of an apposing monomer. This interaction was predicted by the recent filament models of Oda et al. (11Oda T. Iwasa M. Aihara T. Maéda Y. Narita A. The nature of the globular- to fibrous-actin transition.Nature. 2009; 457: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) and Namba and co-workers (8Fujii T. Iwane A.H. Yanagida T. Namba K. Direct visualization of secondary structures of F-actin by electron cryomicroscopy.Nature. 2010; 467: 724-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), in which the side chains of these residues are within 3 Å of one another (Fig. 1). Interestingly, this interaction was not apparent in the original Holmes filament model (10Lorenz M. Poole K.J. Popp D. Rosenbaum G. Holmes K.C. An atomic model of the unregulated thin filament obtained by x-ray fiber diffraction on oriented actin-tropomyosin gels.J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 108-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). If such a bridge existed, it would potentially contribute strongly to actin filament stabilization. Additionally, such an ionic bridge may be vital to the ability of an actin regulatory protein, such as formin binding to the surface of F-actin, to affect actin dynamics by altering interstrand contacts. Modeling shows that Lys113 is the innermost residue of a helix that extends to Lys118 on the surface of actin near binding sites for both formin and Arp2/3. It also shows a potential intramonomer interaction between Glu195 and Arg256 in the center of the filament. Our recent work shows that mutations in Arg256 affect formin-actin interactions, as predicted by our hypothesis (13Malloy L.E. Wen K.K. Pierick A.R. Wedemeyer E.W. Bergeron S.E. Vanderpool N.D. McKane M. Rubenstein P.A. Bartlett H.L. Thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAAD)-causing mutation in actin affects formin regulation of polymerization.J. Biol.

In this paper, we assess the importance of a Lys113–Glu195 ionic interaction in both filament stabilization and regulation. The genetic manipulatability of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the fact that it has a single actin gene, and the fact that its actin is 91% identical to mammalian nonmuscle actin make it an excellent model system for addressing this question (14Rubenstein P.A. The functional importance of multiple actin isoforms.BioEssays. 1990; 12: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Our approach is to first carry out site-directed mutagenesis on yeast actin, resulting in first elimination of the proposed bond and then its reconstruction in the opposite orientation, and to then assess the effects of these changes on yeast viability. Subsequently, we examine the behavior of these alterations on actin polymerization and formin-dependent regulation in vitro using purified proteins. Saccharomyces cerevisiae haploid strains expressing mutant actin as the sole actin were constructed as described by Wen et al. (15Wen K.-K. McKane M. Stokasimov E. Fields J. Rubenstein P.A.

Chem. 2010; 285: 21185-21194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Briefly, the yeast haploid plasmid (pRS314) carrying the yeast actin coding sequence (ACT1) including the promoter region was used as the template for site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primers used for mutagenesis were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). The mutated plasmid was transformed into host haploid cell, in which the only functional ACT1 gene is carried on a centromeric plasmid (pCEN). Transformed cells were subjected to plasmid shuffling using selection based on nutritional markers, and viable strains were collected. The plasmids were isolated from the collected strains and sequenced to confirm the presence of the desired mutations. To characterize the growth of mutant cells in an agitated rich liquid culture, an overnight culture of each cell strain was diluted to an A600 ∼0.2 with YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% dextrose) medium. The cells were grown at 30 °C, and growth was followed by the increase in A600 over time throughout 3 days. The actin-related defects caused by environmental stress were determined by subculturing the overnight YPD culture to A600 ∼0.2. A 2-μl sample was spotted on YPD agar (YPD medium with 2% agar) plates. The plates were then incubated at either 30 or 37 °C to test for temperature sensitivity. The same cells were applied to a YPG (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glycerol) agar plate, and to YPD + 0.5 m NaCl agar plates to test for mitochondria function and for hyperosmolar sensitivity, respectively. Colony size was recorded after 48 h of growth using an Epson 2450 scanner. All experiments were repeated twice using different cultures with similar results. To estimate cell size, cells at A600 ∼0.4–0.8 were collected, and cell images were recorded by bright field microscopy using an Olympus X-81 microscope with a UAPO-N ×100 TIRF 2The abbreviations used are:TIRF, total internal reflection fluorescence; E/K, K113E/E195K. lens, a Prior Lumen 200 fluorescence illumination system, and a Hamamatsu ORCA-R2 camera, controlled by Slidebook, version 5.

The cells were fixed with 3.7%, formaldehyde, washed with PBS, and stained with 0.5 μm Alexa-488 phalloidin in PBS overnight at 4 °C as described (17McKane M. Wen K.K. Meyer A. Rubenstein P.A.

Stained cells were mixed with an anti-bleach mounting medium Vectashield® (Vector, CA) at a 1:1 ratio and mounted on microscope slides with a 70-μl 20% gelatin pad to immobilize cells. Actin cytoskeleton images were collected with an Olympus X-81 microscope as described above. For image recoding, we collected 19–24 z sections at 0.3-μm intervals through whole cells, and we removed out-of-focus light by non-neighbor deconvolution using the same Slidebook, version 5, software. We further rendered each series of deconvoluted images by the FIJI image analysis bundle as described above and stacked them into a two-dimensional image. We focused on budding cells in which the size of the daughter cell was less than one-half the size of the mother cells when actin cables and patches are highly polarized. More than 100 cells were analyzed for each sample. Mitochondria were visualized using a fusion protein consisting of the red fluorescent protein, HcRed, conjugated to the signal sequence of subunit 9 of F0-ATP synthase (pOLI1-HcRed) (18García-Rodríguez L.J.

WT actin was purified from yeast cake purchased locally, and mutant actins were from laboratory-cultured yeast cakes. The purified globular actins (G-actins) were stored in the Ca2+ form in G-actin buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, and 0.1 mm DTT) for 4 days at 4 °C. A 10 mm solution of Oregon Green® 488 maleimide (Invitrogen) in DMSO and a 6.6 mm stock solution of N′-(3-maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin (Invitrogen) in DMSO were mixed with G-actin solution (without DTT) individually at a molar ratio of each reactant to F-actin of 4:1. Each reaction was incubated at room temperature for at least 3 h in the dark. The F-actins were collected by centrifugation in a Beckman TL centrifuge in a TLA 100.2 rotor at 80,000 rpm, 25 °C for 30 min, and depolymerized by dialysis against G buffer. The extent of Oregon Green® 488 labeling was determined by the ratio of the actin concentrations measured with the absorbance at 491 nm (ϵ491 nm = 8,100 m−1 cm−1) and with the absorbance at 290 nm (described above).

The His-tagged fragments were purified using Ni2+-charged affinity chromatography followed by size exclusion chromatography as described previously (20Moseley J.B. Goode B.L. Differential activities and regulation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae formin proteins Bni1 and Bnr1 by Bud6.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28023-28033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Purified fragments were stored in stock buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm DTT) at −80 °C. To determine the content of secondary structure of the G-actins, a 250-μl G-actin sample at a concentration of 3 μm was scanned using a J-815 CD spectrometer (Jasco) equipped with Spectra Manager, version 2, software with the wavelength ranging from 170 to 300 nm. For each actin sample, the CD spectrum from 200 to 240 nm was further analyzed and fitted by a Web-based software package, K2D3 (21Louis-Jeune C. Andrade-Navarro M.A. Perez-Iratxeta C. Prediction of protein secondary structure from circular dichroism using theoretically derived spectra.Proteins. 2011; 80: 374-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), to estimate the percentage of each secondary structure component. Protease digestion was performed essentially as described previously (22Strzelecka-Gołaszewska H. Moraczewska J. Khaitlina S.Y. Mossakowska M. Localization of the tightly bound divalent-cation-dependent and nucleotide-dependent conformation changes in G-actin using limited proteolytic digestion.Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 731-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) with modification. Briefly, 4.6 μm G-actin was incubated with trypsin (5 μg/ml), subtilisin (1 μg/ml), or α-chymotrypsin (22.5 μg/ml) at room temperature for the desired time. All of the digestion reactions were stopped by adding SDS-sample loading buffer and then heating at 95 °C for 3 min. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel, and the bands were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue. A 120-μl solution of G-actin alone or with formin fragment in G buffer was induced to polymerize at 25 °C by the addition of MgCl2 and KCl to final concentrations of 2 and 50 mm, respectively. The increase in light scattering signal with excitation and emission wavelengths set at 360 nm was recorded as a function of time. The light scattering signal was obtained using a FluoroMax (Jobin Yvon Inc.) fluorescence spectrometer with a thermostatted water bath attached to the cuvette chamber. To measure the critical concentration of each actin in this report, the net change in light scattering was plotted as a function of actin concentration, and the x intercept yielded the critical concentration. To visualize actin filaments, a 2-μl sample of 3 μm actin (WT, E195K, and K113E/E195K (E/K) actins) or 5 μm (for K113E actin) at polymerization steady state was removed and was deposited onto a 400-mesh carbon-coated Formvar grid. The actin on the grid was negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate and observed with a JEOL 1230 transmission electron microscope equipped with a Gatan UltraScan 1000 CCD camera in the University of Iowa Central Microscopy Research Facility. For each sample, using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health), we measured the contour lengths of at least 100 filaments that clearly showed both filament ends. The actin used for TIRF analysis was mixed with 65% non-labeled actin, 30% Oregon Green 488-labeled actin, and 5% biotinyl actin. We used biotinyl WT actin instead of individually labeled biotinyl mutant actins for the TIRF assay. Each 1 μm TIRF G-actin sample in TIRF G buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm DTT, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 20 mg/ml glucose, 200 μg/ml glucose oxidase, 40 μg/ml catalase, 1 mg/ml BSA, and 0.5% methylcellulose) was induced to polymerize by the addition of KCl and MgCl2 as described above. The sample was then loaded into a TIRF flow cell coated with 5–25 nm NeutrAvidin (Invitrogen) as described (23Kruth K.A. Rubenstein P.A. Two deafness-causing (DFNA20/26) actin mutations affect Arp2/3-dependent actin regulation.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 27217-27226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Single filament elongation was visualized using an Olympus IX81 inverted microscope with a PlanApo N ×60 TIRF lens and Hamamatsu camera as described above. Images were captured at a rate of 10 s/frame for 10 min or less using Slidebook, version 5. The polymerization rate constants of individual filaments were further measured by the ImageJ plugin (24Kuhn J.R. Pollard T.D. Real-time measurements of actin filament polymerization by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy.Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 1387-1402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) kindly provided by Jeffery Kuhn (Virginia Tech). At least 10 filaments from each actin sample preparation were measured, and at least three different actin preparations of each actin were analyzed. We used Berkeley Madonna, version 8, to simulate and fit the actin polymerization kinetics data with a four-step actin polymerization scheme for WT, E195A, and E/K mutant actin polymerization and an extra fragmenting/annealing step for the K113E, K113A, and E195K actins as described previously (25Buzan J.M. Frieden C. Yeast actin. Polymerization kinetic studies of wild type and a poorly polymerizing mutant.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 26Wen K.-K. Rubenstein P.A. Biochemical consequences of the cardiofunk (R177H) mutation in yeast actin.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48386-48394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and in Scheme 1, where A represents actin monomer, B is actin dimer, C is actin trimer, F is filament, kf is the forward reaction rate constant, and kr is the reverse reaction rate constant. We used the overall kon values obtained from TIRF measurements of the individual actins as the kf. Previously, we had conducted a TIRF analysis of R177H actin, which behaves much like the Lys113 mutants (26Wen K.-K. Rubenstein P.A. Biochemical consequences of the cardiofunk (R177H) mutation in yeast actin.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48386-48394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). For this actin, the kon value was about half that of WT actin. We thus used a similar value for the Lys113 mutant actins because we could not obtain them directly by TIRF due to their high critical concentrations. Finally, we refined these simulations with the Curve Fit function in the software package. All data are presented as means ± S.D. Results for cell size analysis between WT and individual mutant cells were compared using a paired t test with a p value of <0.01 considered significant. Results for the best fit of experimental polymerization to our polymerization model were obtained using the F-test two-sample for variances. In this test, the closer the F-value is to 1, the better is the fit. All statistical analyses and histogram generation were done using Microsoft Excel. Our overall focus was to assess the importance of a hypothetical interstrand ionic interaction in F-actin involving Lys113 in a monomer in one strand of the actin helix with Glu195 in the other, potentially as part of an interstrand stabilization system. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we obtained viable haploid yeast strains expressing either the K113E mutation or the E195K mutation. The first would destabilize the interaction with two opposing negative charges. The second, placing two potentially cationic lysines across from one another might also cause filament disruption. Finally, we constructed a viable double mutant, E/K, in which the original ionic interaction was restored but in the opposite orientation. We first determined the effects of the mutations on growth in liquid YPD complete rich medium at 30 °C with agitation. Fig. 2A shows that the individual K113E and E195K mutations caused early growth arrest. The double mutation (E/K cells) in actin restores growth under these conditions to WT behavior. Consistent with these results, the cell size distribution of the two single mutant strains seemed to be right-shifted to a larger size than WT, with the K113E cells being the most affected (Fig. 3). Mean surface area of the cells also followed the same trend (Table 1), although the effect of the E195K mutation was modest compared with the K113E effects. With the double mutant (E/K) cells, size distribution was virtually like that of WT cells.FIGURE 3Size measurement and the distribution of WT and mutant cells.
