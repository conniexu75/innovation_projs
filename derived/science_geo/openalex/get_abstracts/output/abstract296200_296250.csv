https://openalex.org/W2002268810,"Material structures of reduced dimensions exhibit electrical and mechanical properties different from those in the bulk. Measurements of room-temperature electronic transport in pulled metallic nanowires are presented, demonstrating that the conductance characteristics depend on the length, lateral dimensions, state and degree of disorder, and elongation mechanism of the wire. Conductance during the elongation of short wires (length l approximately 50 angstroms) exhibits periodic quantization steps with characteristic dips, correlating with the order-disorder states of layers of atoms in the wire predicted by molecular dynamics simulations. The resistance R of wires as long as l approximately 400 angstroms exhibits localization characteristics with In R(l) approximately l(2)."
https://openalex.org/W1969811872,"The zero-field muon spin relaxation technique has been used in the direct observation of spontaneous magnetic order below a Curie temperature (T(c)) of approximately 16.1 kelvin in the fullerene charge-transfer salt (tetrakisdimethylaminoethylene)C(60) [(TDAE)C(60)]. Coherent ordering of the electronic magnetic moments leads to a local field of 68(1) gauss at the muon site at 3.2 kelvin (parentheses indicate the error in the last digit). Substantial spatially inhomogeneous effects are manifested in the distribution of the local fields, whose width amounts to 48(2) gauss at the same temperature. The temperature evolution of the internal magnetic field below the freezing temperature mirrors that of the saturation magnetization, closely following the behavior expected for collective spin wave (magnon) excitations. The transition to a ferromagnetic state with a T(c) higher than that of any other organic material is now authenticated."
https://openalex.org/W2082697422,"A simple hydrologic model of seawater circulation at ocean ridge axes implies that the transient occurrence of large volumes of buoyant, heated water in the oceanic water column (megaplumes) can be attributed to the emplacement of dikes in oceanic crust. For dikes to generate megaplume flow, the permeability of both the recharge areas and the upflow zone must be greater than that required for ordinary black smokers. An increase in permeability in the upflow zone by several orders of magnitude results from dike emplacement, and megaplume discharge ceases as the dike cools. Vigorous black smoker venting may not persist very long at a megaplume site after the event occurs."
https://openalex.org/W1978471631,"To assay the effect of area and predators on invasion success, spiders were introduced onto islands that were large, with lizard predators; large, without lizard predators; or small, without lizard predators. Short-term survival was greater on islands without than with predators; area had no effect. Spiders initially increased substantially on both groups of islands without lizards, but after 5 years they nearly died off on small islands while persisting on most large islands; populations in the presence of predators never increased above initial sizes. Results show how predators as well as area are important in determining invasion success."

https://openalex.org/W2124652541,"The depth dependence of bubble concentration at pressures above the transition to the air hydrate phase and the optical scattering length due to bubbles in deep ice at the South Pole are modeled with diffusion-growth data from the laboratory, taking into account the dependence of age and temperature on depth in the ice. The model fits the available data on bubbles in cores from Vostok and Byrd and on scattering length in deep ice at the South Pole. It explains why bubbles and air hydrate crystals coexist in deep ice over a range of depths as great as 800 meters and predicts that at depths below âˆ¼1400 meters the AMANDA neutrino observatory at the South Pole will operate unimpaired by light scattering from bubbles."

A new $20 million detector called Hermes (a result of 10 nation cooperation) is aimed at answering one of the most nagging unknows in physicist` understanding of the proton: what carries its spin."
https://openalex.org/W2063863960,"This article reports on research an electric `accordion` which could potentially effect the fields of radar, communications, and materials science as well as producing some insight into the behavior of the turbulent gases surrounding supernovae. The first working version of the electromagnetic accordian has been build and has produced `sounds` in the form of short bursts of radio waves. Scientists are trying to extend the range of this accordion to shorter wavelengths and pulse lengths. Description of the this work is given."
https://openalex.org/W2072875258,"This article describes a new approach to radiation theory. This theory, expounded by Lieu and Axford, uses the concept of inverse Compton scattering to explain with unprecedented simplicity all the classical and quantum electrodynamic properties of synchrotron radiation, unifying two fundamental processes in physics. Ramifications of this theory are also discussed. 13 refs., 1 fig."
