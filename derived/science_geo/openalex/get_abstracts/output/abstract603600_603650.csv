https://openalex.org/W2792131213,"Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease that is becoming a serious global health problem. Diabetes has been considered to be one of the major risks of cataract and retinopathy. Synthetic and natural product inhibitors of carbohydrate degrading enzymes are able to reduce type 2 diabetes and its complications. For a long time, potatoes have been portrayed as unhealthy for diabetic patients by some nutritionist due to their high starch content. However, purple and red potato cultivars have received considerable attention from consumers because they have high levels of polyphenolic compounds that have potent antioxidant activities. In this study, we screened the total phenolics (TP) and total anthocyanins (TA) and analyzed the phenolic and anthocyanin compounds in selected potato cultivars and advanced selections with distinct flesh colors (purple, red, yellow and white). Purple and red potato cultivars had higher levels of TP and TA than tubers with other flesh colors. Chlorogenic acid is the predominant phenolic acid, and major anthocyanin is composed of the derivatives of petunidin, peonidin, malvidin and pelargonidin. We tested the potential inhibitory effect of potato extracts on the activities of α-amylase and α-glucosidase, which were targeted to develop antidiabetic therapeutic agents. We also measured inhibitory effect of potato extracts on aldose reductase (AR) which is a key enzyme that has been a major drug target for the development of therapies to treat diabetic complications. Purple flesh tubers extract showed the most effective inhibition of α-amylase, α-glucosidase, and aldose reductase with IC50 values 25, 42, and 32 μg/ml, respectively. Kinetic studies showed that anthocyanins are noncompetitive inhibitors of these enzymes, whereas phenolic acids behaved as mixed inhibitors for α-amylase and α-glucosidase and noncompetitive inhibitors for AR. This study supports the development of a positive and healthful image of potatoes, which is an important issue for consumers."
https://openalex.org/W2784664207,"Previous meta-analyses and reviews on gender differences in emotion recognition have shown a small to moderate female advantage. However, inconsistent evidence from recent studies has raised questions regarding the implications of different methodologies, stimuli, and samples. In the present research based on a community sample of more than 5000 participants, we tested the emotional sensitivity hypothesis, stating that women are more sensitive to perceive subtle, i.e. low intense or ambiguous, emotion cues. In addition, we included a self-report emotional intelligence test in order to examine any discrepancy between self-perceptions and actual performance for both men and women. We used a wide range of stimuli and models, displaying six different emotions at two different intensity levels. In order to better tap sensitivity for subtle emotion cues, we did not use a forced choice format, but rather intensity measures of different emotions. We found no support for the emotional sensitivity account, as both genders rated the target emotions as similarly intense at both levels of stimulus intensity. Men, however, more strongly perceived non-target emotions to be present than women. In addition, we also found that the lower scores of men in self-reported EI was not related to their actual perception of target emotions, but it was to the perception of non-target emotions."
https://openalex.org/W2792569575,"Prothionamide (PTH), a second line antitubercular drug is used to administer in conventional oral route. However, its unpredictable absorption and frequent administration limit its use. An alternate approach was thought of administering PTH through pulmonary route in a form of nanoparticles, which can sustain the release for several hours in lungs. Chitosan, a bio-degradable polymer was used to coat PTH and further freeze dried to prepare dry powder inhaler (DPI) with aerodynamic particle size of 1.76μm. In vitro release study showed initial burst release followed by sustained release up to 96.91% in 24h. In vitro release further correlated with in vivo study. Prepared DPI maintained the PTH concentration above MIC for more than 12h after single dose administration and increased the PTH residency in the lungs tissue more than 24h. Animal study also revealed the reduction of dose in pulmonary administration, which will improve the management of tuberculosis."
https://openalex.org/W2794304355,"We use a spatially explicit biogeochemical end-to-end ecosystem model, Atlantis, to simulate impacts from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and subsequent recovery of fish guilds. Dose-response relationships with expected oil concentrations were utilized to estimate the impact on fish growth and mortality rates. We also examine the effects of fisheries closures and impacts on recruitment. We validate predictions of the model by comparing population trends and age structure before and after the oil spill with fisheries independent data. The model suggests that recruitment effects and fishery closures had little influence on biomass dynamics. However, at the assumed level of oil concentrations and toxicity, impacts on fish mortality and growth rates were large and commensurate with observations. Sensitivity analysis suggests the biomass of large reef fish decreased by 25% to 50% in areas most affected by the spill, and biomass of large demersal fish decreased even more, by 40% to 70%. Impacts on reef and demersal forage caused starvation mortality in predators and increased reliance on pelagic forage. Impacts on the food web translated effects of the spill far away from the oiled area. Effects on age structure suggest possible delayed impacts on fishery yields. Recovery of high-turnover populations generally is predicted to occur within 10 years, but some slower-growing populations may take 30+ years to fully recover."
https://openalex.org/W2784408897,"The factors influencing three major outcomes-death, stroke/systemic embolism (SE), and major bleeding-have not been investigated in a large international cohort of unselected patients with newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation (AF).In 28,628 patients prospectively enrolled in the GARFIELD-AF registry with 2-year follow-up, we aimed at analysing: (1) the variables influencing outcomes; (2) the extent of implementation of guideline-recommended therapies in comorbidities that strongly affect outcomes. Median (IQR) age was 71.0 (63.0 to 78.0) years, 44.4% of patients were female, median (IQR) CHA2DS2-VASc score was 3.0 (2.0 to 4.0); 63.3% of patients were on anticoagulants (ACs) with or without antiplatelet (AP) therapy, 24.5% AP monotherapy, and 12.2% no antithrombotic therapy. At 2 years, rates (95% CI) of death, stroke/SE, and major bleeding were 3.84 (3.68; 4.02), 1.27 (1.18; 1.38), and 0.71 (0.64; 0.79) per 100 person-years. Age, history of stroke/SE, vascular disease (VascD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) were associated with the risks of all three outcomes. Congestive heart failure (CHF) was associated with the risks of death and stroke/SE. Smoking, non-paroxysmal forms of AF, and history of bleeding were associated with the risk of death, female sex and heavy drinking with the risk of stroke/SE. Asian race was associated with lower risks of death and major bleeding versus other races. AC treatment was associated with 30% and 28% lower risks of death and stroke/SE, respectively, compared with no AC treatment. Rates of prescription of guideline-recommended drugs were suboptimal in patients with CHF, VascD, or CKD.Our data show that several variables are associated with the risk of one or more outcomes, in terms of death, stroke/SE, and major bleeding. Comprehensive management of AF should encompass, besides anticoagulation, improved implementation of guideline-recommended therapies for comorbidities strongly associated with outcomes, namely CHF, VascD, and CKD.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01090362."
https://openalex.org/W2790909358,"Background Neoadjuvant chemotherapy before radical gastrectomy is preferred for locally advanced gastric cancer. To avoid the problematic use of pTNM for patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) and the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) gastric cancer TNM staging system (8th edition) added ypTNM for the first time. But patients achieving pathological complete response were not covered by the new ypTNM staging system. To investigate whether pathological complete response is associated with better outcome in gastric cancer, as was reported in rectal, breast and bladder cancer. Methods We systematically searched the databases of PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane Collaboration’s Central register of controlled trials from January 1988 to April 2015 for publications which reported outcomes of patients with and without pathological complete response (pCR) (pT0N0M0) to investigate whether pCR after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) treated with radical surgery is associated with better survival. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS). The secondary outcome was disease-free survival (DFS). Both were measured with a relative risk (RR). A meta-analysis was performed using the fixed effects model. Forest plots and the Q test was used to evaluate overall heterogeneity for OS and DFS. Results A total of seven trials, 1143 patients were included and analyzed after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radical surgery with no other preoperative treatment. The average rate of pCR was 6.74% (range: 3%-15%). The RR of patients who achieved pCR in the primary tumor and lymph nodes is 0.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.25–0.98; p = 0.04), 0.34 (95% CI, 0.21–0.55; p<0.0001) and 0.44 (95% CI, 0.30–0.63; p<0.0001) for one-year-OS, three-year-OS and five-year-OS, respectively. The summary RR for three-year-DFS was 0.43 (95% CI, 0.25–0.72; p = 0.002). Conclusion Patients with resectable gastric or GEJ cancer who achieved pCR after neoadjuvant chemotherapy can gain a better outcome than patients without pCR."
https://openalex.org/W2789502247,"Background Calcium silicate-based cements are biomaterials with calcium oxide and carbonate filler additives. Their properties are close to those of dentin, making them useful in restorative dentistry and endodontics. The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro biological effects of two such calcium silicate cements, Biodentine (BD) and Bioroot (BR), on dental stem cells in both direct and indirect contact models. The two models used aimed to mimic reparative dentin formation (direct contact) and reactionary dentin formation (indirect contact). An original aspect of this study is the use of an interposed thin agarose gel layer to assess the effects of diffusible components from the materials. Results The two biomaterials were compared and did not modify dental pulp stem cell (DPSC) proliferation. BD and BR showed no significant cytotoxicity, although some cell death occurred in direct contact. No apoptosis or inflammation induction was detected. A striking increase of mineralization induction was observed in the presence of BD and BR, and this effect was greater in direct contact. Surprisingly, biomineralization occurred even in the absence of mineralization medium. This differentiation was accompanied by expression of odontoblast-associated genes. Exposure by indirect contact did not stimulate the induction to such a level. Conclusion These two biomaterials both seem to be bioactive and biocompatible, preserving DPSC proliferation, migration and adhesion. The observed strong mineralization induction through direct contact highlights the potential of these biomaterials for clinical application in dentin-pulp complex regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2790273495,"Malaria remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among children under five years old in many low- and middle-income countries. In this study, we examined how malaria-related ideational factors may influence care-seeking behavior among female caregivers of children under five with fever. Data came from population-based surveys conducted in 2014-2015 by U.S. Agency for International Development-funded surveys in Madagascar, Mali, and Nigeria. The outcome of interest was whether a child under five with fever within two weeks prior to the survey was brought to a formal health facility for care. Results show a wide variation in care-seeking practices for children under five with fever across countries. Seeking care for febrile children under five in the formal health sector is far from a norm in the study countries. Important ideational factors associated with care-seeking behavior included caregivers' perceived social norms regarding treatment of fever among children under five in Nigeria and Madagascar, and caregiver's knowledge of the cause of malaria in Mali. Findings indicate that messages aimed to increase malaria-related knowledge should be tailored to the specific country, and that interventions designed to influence social norms about care-seeking are likely to result in increased care-seeking behavior for fever in children under five."
https://openalex.org/W2793504575,"Early detection of power transformer fault is important because it can reduce the maintenance cost of the transformer and it can ensure continuous electricity supply in power systems. Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) technique is commonly used to identify oil-filled power transformer fault type but utilisation of artificial intelligence method with optimisation methods has shown convincing results. In this work, a hybrid support vector machine (SVM) with modified evolutionary particle swarm optimisation (EPSO) algorithm was proposed to determine the transformer fault type. The superiority of the modified PSO technique with SVM was evaluated by comparing the results with the actual fault diagnosis, unoptimised SVM and previous reported works. Data reduction was also applied using stepwise regression prior to the training process of SVM to reduce the training time. It was found that the proposed hybrid SVM-Modified EPSO (MEPSO)-Time Varying Acceleration Coefficient (TVAC) technique results in the highest correct identification percentage of faults in a power transformer compared to other PSO algorithms. Thus, the proposed technique can be one of the potential solutions to identify the transformer fault type based on DGA data on site."
https://openalex.org/W2784697781,"Background Safe and legal abortions are rarely practiced in the public health sector in Kenya, and rates of maternal mortality and morbidity from unsafe abortion is high. Little is known about women’s experiences seeking and accessing abortion in informal settlements in Nairobi, Kenya. Methods Seven focus group discussions were conducted with a total of 71 women and girls recruited from an informal settlement in Nairobi. The interview guide explored participants’ perceptions of unplanned pregnancy, abortion, and access to sexual and reproductive health information in their community. Thematic analysis of the focus group transcripts was conducted using MAX QDA Release 12. Results Participants described a variety of factors that influence women’s experiences with abortion in their communities. According to participants, limited knowledge of sexual and reproductive health information and lack of access to contraception led to unplanned pregnancy among women in their community. Participants cited stigma and loss of opportunities that women with unplanned pregnancies face as the primary reasons why women seek abortions. Participants articulated stigma as the predominant barrier women in their communities face to safe abortion. Other barriers, which were often interrelated to stigma, included lack of education about safe methods of abortion, perceived illegality of abortion, as well as limited access to services, fear of mistreatment, and mistrust of health providers and facilities. Conclusions Women in informal settlements in Nairobi, Kenya face substantial barriers to regulating their fertility and lack access to safe abortion. Policy makers and reproductive health advocates should support programs that employ harm reduction strategies and increase women’s knowledge of and access to medication abortion outside the formal healthcare system."
https://openalex.org/W2790362454,"Food can trigger a diverse array of symptoms in food allergic individuals from isolated local symptoms affecting skin or gut to multi-system severe reactions (systemic anaphylaxis). Although we know that gastrointestinal and systemic manifestations of food allergy are mediated by tissue mast cells (MCs), it is not clear why allergen exposure by the oral route can result in such distinct clinical manifestations. Our aim was to assess the contribution of mast cell subsets to different manifestations of food allergy. We used two common models of IgE-mediated food allergy, one resulting in systemic anaphylaxis and the other resulting in acute gastrointestinal symptoms, to study the immune basis of allergic reactions. We used responders and non-responders in each model system, as well as naive controls to identify the association of mast cell activation with clinical reactivity rather than sensitization. Systemic anaphylaxis was uniquely associated with activation of connective tissue mast cells (identified by release of mouse mast cell protease (MMCP) -7 into the serum) and release of histamine, while activation of mucosal mast cells (identified by release of MMCP-1 in the serum) did not correlate with symptoms. Gastrointestinal manifestations of food allergy were associated with an increase of MMCP-1-expressing mast cells in the intestine, and evidence of both mucosal and connective tissue mast cell activation. The data presented in this paper demonstrates that mast cell heterogeneity is an important contributor to manifestations of food allergy, and identifies the connective tissue mast cell subset as key in the development of severe systemic anaphylaxis."
https://openalex.org/W2791975082,"Background and purpose The frequency, clinical correlates, and risk factors of cerebral microbleeds (CMB) in Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) are still poorly known. We aimed at determining the location and number of CMB and their relationship with clinical manifestations, vascular risk factors, drugs, and other neuroimaging features in CADASIL patients. Methods We collected clinical data by means of a structured proforma and centrally evaluated CMB on magnetic resonance gradient echo sequences applying the Microbleed Anatomical Rating Scale in CADASIL patients seen in 2 referral centers in Italy and United Kingdom. Results We evaluated 125 patients. CMB were present in 34% of patients and their presence was strongly influenced by the age. Twenty-nine percent of the patients had CMB in deep subcortical location, 22% in a lobar location, and 18% in infratentorial regions. After adjustment for age, factors significantly associated with a higher total number of CMB were hemorrhagic stroke, dementia, urge incontinence, and statins use (this latter not confirmed by multivariate analysis). Infratentorial and deep CMB were associated with dementia and urge incontinence, lobar CMB with hemorrhagic stroke, dementia, and statins use. Unexpectedly, patients with migraine, with or without aura, had a lower total, deep, and lobar number of CMB than patients without migraine. Discussion CMB formation in CADASIL seems to increase with age. History of hemorrhagic stroke, dementia, urge incontinence, and statins use are associated with a higher number of CMB. However, these findings need to be confirmed by longitudinal studies."
https://openalex.org/W2997466260,"Signaling pathways represent parts of the global biological molecular network which connects them into a seamless whole through complex direct and indirect (hidden) crosstalk whose structure can change during development or in pathological conditions. We suggest a novel methodology, called Googlomics, for the structural analysis of directed biological networks using spectral analysis of their Google matrices, using parallels with quantum scattering theory, developed for nuclear and mesoscopic physics and quantum chaos. We introduce analytical ""reduced Google matrix"" method for the analysis of biological network structure. The method allows inferring hidden causal relations between the members of a signaling pathway or a functionally related group of genes. We investigate how the structure of hidden causal relations can be reprogrammed as a result of changes in the transcriptional network layer during cancerogenesis. The suggested Googlomics approach rigorously characterizes complex systemic changes in the wiring of large causal biological networks in a computationally efficient way."
https://openalex.org/W2785116147,"High levels of physical activity seem to positively influence health and cognition across the lifespan. Several studies have found that aerobic exercise enhances cognition and likely prevents cognitive decline in the elderly. Nevertheless, the association of incidental physical activity (IPA) with health and cognition during aging has not been studied. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the association of IPA level with cognitive functions and resting electroencephalogram (EEG) in healthy old participants. Participants (n = 97) with normal scores on psychometric and neuropsychological tests and normal values in blood analyses were included. A cluster analysis based on the scores of the Yale Physical Activity Scale (YPAS) allowed the formation of two groups: active, with high levels of IPA, and passive, with low levels of IPA. Eyes-closed resting EEG was recorded from the participants; the fast Fourier transform was used offline to calculate absolute power (AP), relative power (RP), and mean frequency (MF) measures. There were no differences in socioeconomic status, cognitive reserve, general cognitive status, or lipid and TSH profiles between the groups. The results of cognitive tests revealed significant differences in the performance variables of the WAIS scores (p = .015), with advantages for the active group. The resting EEG exhibited significantly slower activity involving the frontal, central, and temporal regions in the passive group (p < .05). Specifically, higher delta RP (F7, T3), lower delta MF (F4, C4, T4, T6, Fz, Cz), higher theta AP (C4), higher theta RP (F4, C4, T3, Fz), lower alpha AP (F3, F7, T3), lower alpha RP (F7), and lower total MF (F3, F7, T3, T5, Fz) were found. Altogether, these results suggest that IPA induces a neuroprotective effect, which is reflected both in behavioral and electrophysiological variables during aging."
https://openalex.org/W2784547304,"The probability of an aquatic animal being available for detection is typically <1. Accounting for covariates that reduce the probability of detection is important for obtaining robust estimates of the population abundance and determining its status and trends. The dugong (Dugong dugon) is a bottom-feeding marine mammal and a seagrass community specialist. We hypothesized that the probability of a dugong being available for detection is dependent on water depth and that dugongs spend more time underwater in deep-water seagrass habitats than in shallow-water seagrass habitats. We tested this hypothesis by quantifying the depth use of 28 wild dugongs fitted with GPS satellite transmitters and time-depth recorders (TDRs) at three sites with distinct seagrass depth distributions: 1) open waters supporting extensive seagrass meadows to 40 m deep (Torres Strait, 6 dugongs, 2015); 2) a protected bay (average water depth 6.8 m) with extensive shallow seagrass beds (Moreton Bay, 13 dugongs, 2011 and 2012); and 3) a mixture of lagoon, coral and seagrass habitats to 60 m deep (New Caledonia, 9 dugongs, 2013). The fitted instruments were used to measure the times the dugongs spent in the experimentally determined detection zones under various environmental conditions. The estimated probability of detection was applied to aerial survey data previously collected at each location. In general, dugongs were least available for detection in Torres Strait, and the population estimates increased 6–7 fold using depth-specific availability correction factors compared with earlier estimates that assumed homogeneous detection probability across water depth and location. Detection probabilities were higher in Moreton Bay and New Caledonia than Torres Strait because the water transparency in these two locations was much greater than in Torres Strait and the effect of correcting for depth-specific detection probability much less. The methodology has application to visual survey of coastal megafauna including surveys using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles."
https://openalex.org/W2785578438,"Oxidative phosphorylation within mitochondria is the main source of aerobic energy for neuronal functioning, and the key genes are located in mitochondrial DNA. Deficits in oxidative phosphorylation functioning have been reported for schizophrenia, but efforts in the identification of genetic markers within the mitochondrial DNA that predispose to schizophrenia have been limited. We genotyped a set of mitochondrial SNPs using Illumina HumanExome arrays and tested for association in the Swedish schizophrenia sample (N> 10,000). We developed a novel approach for mitochondrial DNA imputation in order to increase the number of common SNPs available for association analysis. The most significant findings were for the mitochondrial SNPs C15452A (GRCh38.p10; rs527236209; p = 0.007; gene MT-CYB; defining haplogroup JT); A11251G (rs869096886; p = 0.007; gene MT-ND4; defining haplogroup JT), and T4216C (rs1599988; p = 0.008, gene MT-ND1, defining haplogroup R2’JT). We also conducted rare variant burden analyses and obtained a p-value of 0.007. For multimarker haplotypes analysis, the most significant finding was for the J group (OR: 0.86, p = 0.02). We conducted the largest association study of mitochondrial DNA variants and schizophrenia but did not find an association that survived multiple testing correction. Analysis of a larger sample is required and will allow a better understanding of the role of mitochondria in schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W2785016163,"Salmonellosis is a major public health problem throughout the world. Thus, there is a huge need for diversified control strategies for Salmonella infections. In this work, we have assessed the potential use of Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) spores for the expression of a major protective antigen of Salmonella serovar Pullorum, OmpC. The expression of OmpC on the surface of spores was determined by immunofluorescence microscopy. Mice immunized with recombinant spores expressing the OmpC antigen presented significant levels of OmpC-specific serum IgG and mucosal SIgA antibodies than in mice immunized with non-recombinant spores (p<0.01). In addition, oral immunization with recombinant spores was able to induce a significant level of protection in mice against lethal challenge with Salmonella serovar Typhimurium. These results suggest that B. subtilis spores have promising potential in the development of mucosal vaccines against Salmonella infections."
https://openalex.org/W2784350323,"To investigate Armadillo repeat-containing 5 (ARMC5) mutations in Chinese patients with familial and sporadic primary bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (PBMAH), we performed clinical data collection and ARMC5 sequencing for three PBMAH families and 23 sporadic PBMAH patients. ARMC5 pathogenic germline mutations were identified in all 3 PBMAH families. Secondary ARMC5 somatic mutations were found in two adrenal nodules from two PBMAH family members with ARMC5 germline mutations. PBMAH family members with ARMC5 pathogenic germline mutations displayed various clinical manifestations. ARMC5 pathogenic germline mutations were identified in 5 sporadic PBMAH patients among whom one patient displayed both hypercortisolism and primary aldosteronism. We detected a total of 10 ARMC5 pathogenic mutations, of which 8 had not been previously reported. Our results suggest that ARMC5 pathogenic germline mutations are common in familial and sporadic Chinese PBMAH patients, and demonstrate the importance of ARMC5 screening in PBMAH family members to detect patients with insidious PBMAH."
https://openalex.org/W2785088398,"Species that display temperature-dependent sex determination are at risk as a result of increasing global temperatures. For marine turtles, high incubation temperatures can skew sex ratios towards females. There are concerns that temperature increases may result in highly female-biased offspring sex ratios, which would drive a future sex ratio skew. Studying the sex ratios of adults in the ocean is logistically very difficult because individuals are widely distributed and males are inaccessible because they remain in the ocean. Breeding sex ratios (BSR) are sought as a functional alternative to study adult sex ratios. One way to examine BSR is to determine the number of males that contribute to nests. Our goal was to evaluate the BSR for loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) nesting along the eastern Gulf of Mexico in Florida, from 2013–2015, encompassing three nesting seasons. We genotyped 64 nesting females (approximately 28% of all turtles nesting at that time) and up to 20 hatchlings from their nests (n = 989) using 7 polymorphic microsatellite markers. We identified multiple paternal contributions in 70% of the nests analyzed and 126 individual males. The breeding sex ratio was approximately 1 female for every 2.5 males. We did not find repeat males in any of our nests. The sex ratio and lack of repeating males was surprising because of female-biased primary sex ratios. We hypothesize that females mate offshore of their nesting beaches as well as en route. We recommend further comparisons of subsequent nesting events and of other beaches as it is imperative to establish baseline breeding sex ratios to understand how growing populations behave before extreme environmental effects are evident."
https://openalex.org/W2790661732,"Guanylyl cyclase C (GCC) is a cell-surface protein that is expressed by normal intestinal epithelial cells, more than 95% of metastatic colorectal cancers (mCRC), and the majority of gastric and pancreatic cancers. Due to strict apical localization, systemically delivered GCC-targeting agents should not reach GCC in normal intestinal tissue, while accessing antigen in tumor. We generated an investigational antibody-drug conjugate (TAK-264, formerly MLN0264) comprising a fully human anti-GCC monoclonal antibody conjugated to monomethyl auristatin E via a protease-cleavable peptide linker. TAK-264 specifically bound, was internalized by, and killed GCC-expressing cells in vitro in an antigen-density-dependent manner. In GCC-expressing xenograft models with similar GCC expression levels/patterns observed in human mCRC samples, TAK-264 induced cell death, leading to tumor regressions and long-term tumor growth inhibition. TAK-264 antitumor activity was generally antigen-density-dependent, although some GCC-expressing tumors were refractory to TAK-264-targeted high local concentrations of payload. These data support further evaluation of TAK-264 in the treatment of GCC-expressing tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2790875596,"The lethal effects of soundwaves on a range of microorganisms have been known for almost a century whereas, the use of ultrasound to promote or control their activity is much more recent. Moreover, the fundamental molecular mechanism influencing the behaviour of microorganisms subjected to ultrasonic waves is not well established. In this study, we investigated the influence of ultrasonic frequencies of 20, 45, 130 and 950 kHz on growth kinetics of Lactobacillus sakei. A significant increase in the growth rate of L. sakei was observed following ultrasound treatment at 20 kHz despite the treatment yielding a significant reduction of ca. 3 log cfu/mL in cells count. Scanning electron microscopy showed that ultrasound caused significant changes on the cell surface of L. sakei culture with the formation of pores “sonoporation”. Phenotypic microarrays showed that all ultrasound treated L. sakei after exposure to various carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur sources had significant variations in nutrient utilisation. Integration of this phenotypic data with the genome of L. sakei revealed that various metabolic pathways were being influenced by the ultrasound treatments. Results presented in this study showed that the physiological response of L. sakei in response to US is frequency dependent and that it can influence metabolic pathways. Hence, ultrasound treatments can be employed to modulate microbial activity for specialised applications."
https://openalex.org/W2784605245,"The hydropower system in the Upper Yellow River (UYR), one of the largest hydropower bases in China, plays a vital role in the energy structure of the Qinghai Power Grid. Due to management difficulties, there is still considerable room for improvement in the joint operation of this system. This paper presents a general LINGO-based integrated framework to study the operation of the UYR hydropower system. The framework is easy to use for operators with little experience in mathematical modeling, takes full advantage of LINGO's capabilities (such as its solving capacity and multi-threading ability), and packs its three layers (the user layer, the coordination layer, and the base layer) together into an integrated solution that is robust and efficient and represents an effective tool for data/scenario management and analysis. The framework is general and can be easily transferred to other hydropower systems with minimal effort, and it can be extended as the base layer is enriched. The multi-objective model that represents the trade-off between power quantity (i.e., maximum energy production) and power reliability (i.e., firm output) of hydropower operation has been formulated. With equivalent transformations, the optimization problem can be solved by the nonlinear programming (NLP) solvers embedded in the LINGO software, such as the General Solver, the Multi-start Solver, and the Global Solver. Both simulation and optimization are performed to verify the model's accuracy and to evaluate the operation of the UYR hydropower system. A total of 13 hydropower plants currently in operation are involved, including two pivotal storage reservoirs on the Yellow River, which are the Longyangxia Reservoir and the Liujiaxia Reservoir. Historical hydrological data from multiple years (2000-2010) are provided as input to the model for analysis. The results are as follows. 1) Assuming that the reservoirs are all in operation (in fact, some reservoirs were not operational or did not collect all of the relevant data during the study period), the energy production is estimated as 267.7, 357.5, and 358.3×108 KWh for the Qinghai Power Grid during dry, normal, and wet years, respectively. 2) Assuming that the hydropower system is operated jointly, the firm output can reach 3110 MW (reliability of 100%) and 3510 MW (reliability of 90%). Moreover, a decrease in energy production from the Longyangxia Reservoir can bring about a very large increase in firm output from the hydropower system. 3) The maximum energy production can reach 297.7, 363.9, and 411.4×108 KWh during dry, normal, and wet years, respectively. The trade-off curve between maximum energy production and firm output is also provided for reference."
https://openalex.org/W2786667359,"Many environmental data are inherently imbalanced, with some majority land use and land cover types dominating over rare ones. In cultivated ecosystems minority classes are often the target as they might indicate a beginning land use change. Most standard classifiers perform best on a balanced distribution of classes, and fail to detect minority classes. We used the synthetic minority oversampling technique (smote) with Random Forest to classify land cover classes in a small agricultural catchment in South Korea using modis time series. This area faces a major soil erosion problem and policy measures encourage farmers to replace annual by perennial crops to mitigate this issue. Our major goal was therefore to improve the classification performance on annual and perennial crops. We compared four different classification scenarios on original imbalanced and synthetically oversampled balanced data to quantify the effect of smote on classification performance. smote substantially increased the true positive rate of all oversampled minority classes. However, the performance on minor classes remained lower than on the majority class. We attribute this result to a class overlap already present in the original data set that is not resolved by smote. Our results show that resampling algorithms could help to derive more accurate land use and land cover maps from freely available data. These maps can be used to provide information on the distribution of land use classes in heterogeneous agricultural areas and could potentially benefit decision making."
https://openalex.org/W2792605776,"Multidimensional food perception is based mainly on gustatory and olfactory function. Recent research has demonstrated that hypobaric pressure impairs gustatory function and that background noise or distracting auditory stimulation impairs olfactory function. Using a hypobaric chamber, the odor identification, discrimination, and thresholds as well as taste identification and threshold scores were measured in 16 healthy male volunteers under normal and hypobaric (6380 ft) conditions using clinically validated tests. In both conditions, background noise was either canceled out or replaced by white noise presentation (70 dB sound pressure level). Olfactory sensitivity for n-butanol and gustatory sensitivity were impaired in a hypobaric atmosphere. White noise did not influence the odor test results. White noise stimulation impaired sensitivity for sour and sweet but not for bitter or salty tastants. We conclude that hypobaric or noisy environments could impair gustatory and olfactory sensitivity selectively for particular tastants and odorants."
https://openalex.org/W2786972459,"There is increasing evidence of persistent effects of early life vitamin D exposure on later skeletal health; linking low levels in early life to smaller bone size in childhood as well as increased fracture risk later in adulthood, independently of later vitamin D status. A major determinant of bone mass acquisition across all ages is mechanical loading. We tested the hypothesis in an animal model system that early life vitamin D depletion results in abrogation of the response to mechanical loading, with consequent reduction in bone size, mass and strength during both childhood and adulthood. A murine model was created in which pregnant dams were either vitamin D deficient or replete, and their offspring moved to a vitamin D replete diet at weaning. Tibias of the offspring were mechanically loaded and bone structure, extrinsic strength and growth measured both during growth and after skeletal maturity. Offspring of vitamin D deplete mice demonstrated lower bone mass in the non loaded limb and reduced bone mass accrual in response to loading in both the growing skeleton and after skeletal maturity. Early life vitamin D depletion led to reduced bone strength and altered bone biomechanical properties. These findings suggest early life vitamin D status may, in part, determine the propensity to osteoporosis and fracture that blights later life in many individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2785707457,"To examine temporal changes in opiate and stimulant use among patients in substance abuse treatment over a ten-year observation period and to explore the role of contextual factors, mental health disorders and psychosocial factors on these changes.A cohort of 481 patients was prospectively interviewed at admission to treatment and after 1, 2, 7 and 10 years. The sample was recruited from 20 facilities in the Greater Oslo region, Norway.The majority of patients were poly-drug users and 80% had used both opiates and stimulants the last 30 days prior to treatment admission. Last-month use of heroin, other opiates, cocaine and amphetamines declined from 80% to 34% at the end of the observation period. The most substantial reduction was observed between baseline and one-year follow-up. Use of heroin decreased the most from 62% to 16% after 10 years (a reduction of 74%), and the reduction continued from one-year follow-up throughout the observation period. The most important multivariate risk factors for sustained use of these drugs were male gender, having one or both biological parents with severe alcohol or drug problems, having an antisocial personality disorder, and living together with a person who abuses alcohol or drugs. Employment was associated with reduced risk of drug use at 7-year follow-up.There was a substantial reduction in opiate and stimulant use from baseline to all follow-up assessments, most greatly for heroin. Findings regarding sustained use could suggest familial transmission and the challenges of preventive strategies and treatment efforts in an intergenerational context. Co-occurrence between drug abuse and mental health problems highlights the need of highly specialized competence in SUD treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2789875584,"In this work, a swarm behaviour for multi-rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) deployment will be presented. The main contribution of this behaviour is the use of a virtual device for quantitative sematectonic stigmergy providing more adaptable behaviours in complex environments. It is a fault tolerant highly robust behaviour that does not require prior information of the area to be covered, or to assume the existence of any kind of information signals (GPS, mobile communication networks …), taking into account the specific features of UAVs. This behaviour will be oriented towards emergency tasks. Their main goal will be to cover an area of the environment for later creating an ad-hoc communication network, that can be used to establish communications inside this zone. Although there are several papers on robotic deployment it is more difficult to find applications with UAV systems, mainly because of the existence of various problems that must be overcome including limitations in available sensory and on-board processing capabilities and low flight endurance. In addition, those behaviours designed for UAVs often have significant limitations on their ability to be used in real tasks, because they assume specific features, not easily applicable in a general way. Firstly, in this article the characteristics of the simulation environment will be presented. Secondly, a microscopic model for deployment and creation of ad-hoc networks, that implicitly includes stigmergy features, will be shown. Then, the overall swarm behaviour will be modeled, providing a macroscopic model of this behaviour. This model can accurately predict the number of agents needed to cover an area as well as the time required for the deployment process. An experimental analysis through simulation will be carried out in order to verify our models. In this analysis the influence of both the complexity of the environment and the stigmergy system will be discussed, given the data obtained in the simulation. In addition, the macroscopic and microscopic models will be compared verifying the number of predicted individuals for each state regarding the simulation."
https://openalex.org/W2790262332,"Building evolution model of supply chain networks could be helpful to understand its development law. However, specific characteristics and attributes of real supply chains are often neglected in existing evolution models. This work proposes a new evolution model of supply chain with manufactures as the core, based on external market demand and internal competition-cooperation. The evolution model assumes the external market environment is relatively stable, considers several factors, including specific topology of supply chain, external market demand, ecological growth and flow conservation. The simulation results suggest that the networks evolved by our model have similar structures as real supply chains. Meanwhile, the influences of external market demand and internal competition-cooperation to network evolution are analyzed. Additionally, 38 benchmark data sets are applied to validate the rationality of our evolution model, in which, nine manufacturing supply chains match the features of the networks constructed by our model."
https://openalex.org/W2794053887,"Abnormal torsion could be associated with cyclovertical strabismus, but torsion measurements are not reliable in children. To assess an objective fundus torsion evaluation in a paediatric population, we used Non-Mydriatic Fundus photography (NMFP) in healthy and cyclovertical strabismus patients to evaluate the disc-foveal angle over time and observers.We used a retrospective set of NMFP including 24 A or V-pattern strabismus and 27 age-matched normal children (mean age 6.4 and 6.7 years respectively), taken during 2 distinct follow-up consultations (separated by 251 and 479 days respectively). Each disc-foveal angle measurement (from which the ocular torsion can be assessed) was performed by 5 different observers, using graphical software and based on reproducible fundus anatomical marks. Statistical analysis was performed with a multivariate ANOVA using group, time and observers as factors, in addition to intraclass coefficient correlation (ICC) to assess measurement reproducibility.A significant difference of disc-foveal angle measures was observed between groups (p<0,001): 18.73° (SD = 6.42), -3,25° (SD = 5.51) and 6,89° (SD = 4,41) respectively for V-pattern, A- pattern and normal subjects. Neither observers (F = 0,2028 p = 0,9369) nor time between 1st and 2nd NMFP (F = 0,6312 p = 0,4271) seem to influence the measure of disc-foveal angle. The evaluation of disc-foveal angle was very reproducible between observers (ICC>0,97).Abnormal amount of objective torsion could be associated with alphabet-pattern strabismus. Disc-foveal angle evaluation by NMFP in a children population appears as a non-invasive, reliable and reproducible method."
https://openalex.org/W2788724508,"Background Diabetes and obesity seem to be partly overlapping risk factors for the development of obesity-related cancer (mainly breast, prostate and colorectal cancer) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). In the general population, women have a lower risk for obesity-related cancer compared to men. Previous studies involving cardiovascular disease have shown that T2DM eliminates a female advantage of lower CVD risk in the general population compared to men. It is unclear whether the same could be true for obesity-related cancer. This study aimed to this investigate obesity-related cancer incidence in women and men known with T2DM as compared to the Dutch general population. Methods This study included 69,583 patients with T2DM selected from a prospective primary care cohort, which was linked to the Dutch National Cancer Registry to obtain cancer specific data. Obesity-related cancers included liver, kidney, colorectal, gallbladder, pancreas, ovarian, endometrial, advanced prostate cancer, post-menopausal breast cancer and oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Primary outcome was sex-stratified, age and year of cancer diagnosis adjusted standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for three time periods: 5 years before, the year after diagnosis and the next 4 years after T2DM diagnosis. The Dutch general population was used as reference group. Results Women with T2DM were at an increased risk for obesity-related cancer compared to women in the general population already 5 years before diabetes diagnosis (SIR 1.77; 95%CI: 1.63–1.91). In both men and women, there was a peak in obesity-related cancer incidence following diabetes diagnosis (SIR: 1.38; 95%CI 1.11–1.64 and SIR: 2.21; 95%CI 1.94–2.30, respectively). From the second to the fifth year after diabetes diagnosis the obesity-related cancer incidence was higher in women compared to women in the general population (SIR: 2.12; 95%CI 1.94–2.30). Conclusions Women with T2DM seem to have a substantially higher obesity-related cancer risk. As opposed to men, in women this risk was already increased years before diabetes diagnosis. These results could imply that a relative advantage of women in the general population with regard to cancer risk is lost in women with T2DM."
https://openalex.org/W2794184218,"Slow wave (or stage N3) sleep has been linked to a variety of cognitive processes. However, the role of stage N3 in the elderly is debated. The link between stage N3 and episodic memory may be weakened or changed in the older adult population, possibly due to several altered mechanisms impacting the cellular structure of the brain. The bases for the age-related dissociation between stage N3 and cognition are not understood. Since APOEε4 status is the strongest genetic risk factor for cognitive decline, we assessed whether the ε4 allele is associated with stage N3 sleep. Participants were from the population-based Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) cohort with polysomnography and APOEε4 genotype data (n = 2,302, 100% male, mean age 76.6 years). Sleep stages were objectively measured using overnight in-home polysomnography and central electroencephalogram data were used to score stage N3 sleep. Cognitive function was assessed using the Modified Mini Mental State Exam (3MS). The APOE rs429358 single nucleotide polymorphism, which defines the APOEε4 allele, was genotyped using a custom genotyping array. Total time in stage N3 sleep was significantly higher (p<0.0001) among the 40 MrOS participants carrying two copies of the ε4 allele (62±5.2 minutes) compared with 43±1.5 minutes for carriers of one ε4 allele (n = 515) and 40±0.8 minutes for ε4 non-carriers (n = 1747). All results were independent of sleep efficiency, number of sleep cycles, and apnea hypopnea index. These findings support an association between APOEε4 genotype and sleep stage N3 in the elderly. Increased total stage N3 duration among ε4/ε4 carriers does not appear to reflect compensation for prior cognitive decline and may reflect overactive downscaling of synapses during sleep. If confirmed, these results might in part explain the high risk of age-related cognitive decline and AD among APOE ε4/ε4 carriers."
https://openalex.org/W2785482592,"Mortality statistics form a crucial component of national Health Management Information Systems (HMIS). However, there are limitations in the availability and quality of mortality data at national level in Viet Nam. This study assessed the completeness of recorded deaths and the reliability of recorded causes of death (COD) in the A6 death registers in the national routine HMIS in Viet Nam.1477 identified deaths in 2014 were reviewed in two provinces. A capture-recapture method was applied to assess the completeness of the A6 death registers. 1365 household verbal autopsy (VA) interviews were successfully conducted, and these were reviewed by physicians who assigned multiple and underlying cause of death (UCOD). These UCODs from VA were then compared with the CODs recorded in the A6 death registers, using kappa scores to assess the reliability of the A6 death register diagnoses. The overall completeness of the A6 death registers in the two provinces was 89.3% (95%CI: 87.8-90.8). No COD recorded in the A6 death registers demonstrated good reliability. There is very low reliability in recording of cardiovascular deaths (kappa for stroke = 0.47 and kappa for ischaemic heart diseases = 0.42) and diabetes (kappa = 0.33). The reporting of deaths due to road traffic accidents, HIV and some cancers are at a moderate level of reliability with kappa scores ranging between 0.57-0.69 (p<0.01). VA methods identify more specific COD than the A6 death registers, and also allow identification of multiple CODs.The study results suggest that data completeness in HMIS A6 death registers in the study sample of communes was relatively high (nearly 90%), but triangulation with death records from other sources would improve the completeness of this system. Further, there is an urgent need to enhance the reliability of COD recorded in the A6 death registers, for which VA methods could be effective. Focussed consultation among stakeholders is needed to develop a suitable mechanism and process for integrating VA methods into the national routine HMIS A6 death registers in Viet Nam."
https://openalex.org/W2784515329,"Evaluation of recurrent angina after percutaneous coronary interventions is challenging. Since bioresorbable vascular scaffolds (BVS) cause no artefacts in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) due to their polylactate-based backbone, evaluation of vascular patency by MRI might allow for non-invasive assessment and triage of patients with suspected BVS failure.Patients with polylactate-based ABSORB-BVS in proximal coronary segments were examined with 3 Tesla MRI directly (baseline) and one year after implantation. For assessment of coronary patency, a high-resolution 3D spoiled gradient echo pulse sequence with fat-saturation, T2-preparation (TE: 40 ms), respiratory and end-diastolic cardiac gating, and a spatial resolution of (1.08 mm)3 was positioned parallel to the course of the vessel for bright blood imaging. In addition, a 3D navigator-gated T2-weighted variable flip angle turbo spin echo (TSE) sequence with dual-inversion recovery black-blood preparation and elliptical k-space coverage was applied with a voxel size of (1.14 mm)3. For quantitative evaluation lumen diameters of the scaffolded areas were measured in reformatted bright and black blood MR angiography data.11 patients with implantation of 16 BVS in the proximal coronary segments were included, of which none suffered from major adverse cardiac events during the one year follow up. Vascular patency in all segments implanted with BVS could be reliably assessed by MRI at baseline and after one year, whereas segments with metal stents could not be evaluated due to artefacts. Luminal diameter within the BVS remained constant during the one year period. One patient with atypical angina after BVS implantation was noninvasively evaluated showing a patent vessel, also confirmed by coronary angiography.Coronary MRI allows contrast-agent free and non-invasive assessment of vascular patency after ABSORB-BVS implantation. This approach might be supportive in the triage and improvement of diagnostic workflows in patients with postinterventional angina and scaffold implantation.German Register of Clinical Studies DRKS00007456."
https://openalex.org/W2789686715,"Background Step kinematic variability has been characterized during gait using spatial and temporal kinematic characteristics. However, people can adopt different trajectory paths both between individuals and even within individuals at different speeds. Single point measures such as minimum toe clearance (MTC) and step length (SL) do not necessarily account for the multiple paths that the foot may take during the swing phase to reach the same foot fall endpoint. The purpose of this study was to test a step-by-step foot trajectory area (SBS-FTA) variability measure that is able to characterize sagittal plane foot trajectories of varying areas, and compare this measure against MTC and SL variability at different speeds. We hypothesize that the SBS-FTA variability would demonstrate increased variability with speed. Second, we hypothesize that SBS-FTA would have a stronger curvilinear fit compared with the CV and SD of SL and MTC. Third, we hypothesize SBS-FTA would be more responsive to change in the foot trajectory at a given speed compared to SL and MTC. Fourth, SBS-FTA variability would not strongly co-vary with SL and MTC variability measures since it represents a different construct related to foot trajectory area variability. Methods We studied 15 nonimpaired individuals during walking at progressively faster speeds. We calculated SL, MTC, and SBS-FTA area. Results SBS-FTA variability increased with speed, had a stronger curvilinear fit compared with the CV and SD of SL and MTC, was more responsive at a given speed, and did not strongly co-vary with SL and MTC variability measures. Conclusion SBS foot trajectory area variability was sensitive to change with faster speeds, captured a relationship that the majority of the other measures did not demonstrate, and did not co-vary strongly with other measures that are also components of the trajectory."
https://openalex.org/W2784459396,Wintertime convective mixing plays a pivotal role in the sub-polar North Atlantic spring phytoplankton blooms by favoring phytoplankton survival in the competition between light-dependent production and losses due to grazing and gravitational settling. We use satellite and ocean reanalyses to show that the area-averaged maximum winter mixed layer depth is positively correlated with April chlorophyll concentration in the northern Labrador Sea. A simple theoretical framework is developed to understand the relative roles of winter/spring convection and gravitational sedimentation in spring blooms in this region. Combining climate model simulations that project a weakening of wintertime Labrador Sea convection from Arctic sea ice melt with our framework suggests a potentially significant reduction in the initial fall phytoplankton population that survive the winter to seed the region's spring bloom by the end of the 21st century.
https://openalex.org/W2793921967,"We reported previously that intranasal instillation of a synthetic human pulmonary surfactant with a carboxy vinyl polymer as a viscosity improver, named SF-10, shows potent adjuvanticity for humoral immunity in mice and cynomolgus monkeys. SF-10 effectively induces influenza hemagglutinin vaccine (HAv)-specific IgA in nasal and lung washes and IgG in sera with their neutralizing activities. Since CD8+ T cell-mediated protection is an important requirement for adaptive immunity, we investigated in this study the effects of SF-10 with antigen on local and systemic cell-mediated immunity. Nasal instillation of ovalbumin, a model antigen, combined with SF-10 efficiently delivered antigen to mucosal dendritic and epithelial cells and promoted cross-presentation in antigen presenting cells, yielding a high percentage of ovalbumin-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in the nasal mucosa, compared with ovalbumin alone. Nasal immunization of HAv-SF-10 also induced HAv-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes and upregulated granzyme B expression in splenic CD8+ T cells with their high cytotoxicity against target cells pulsed with HA peptide. Furthermore, nasal vaccination of HAv-SF-10 significantly induced higher cytotoxic T lymphocytes-mediated cytotoxicity in the lungs and cervical lymph nodes in the early phase of influenza virus infection compared with HAv alone. Protective immunity induced by HAv-SF-10 against lethal influenza virus infection was partially and predominantly suppressed after depletion of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells (induced by intraperitoneal injection of the corresponding antibodies), respectively, suggesting that CD4+ T cells predominantly and CD8+ T cells partially contribute to the protective immunity in the advanced stage of influenza virus infection. These results suggest that SF-10 promotes effective antigen delivery to antigen presenting cells, activates CD8+ T cells via cross-presentation, and induces cell-mediated immune responses against antigen."

https://openalex.org/W2793919804,"Introduction The deleterious effects of psychosocial outcomes on diabetic patients’ health have not been fully investigated yet. This study was aimed to explore how psychosocial outcomes impacted on the health status of Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods A mix of stratified sampling and typical sampling were used to select diabetic patients in Jiangsu Province to conduct individual interviews. Health status was measured by EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Psychosocial outcomes were measured by instruments used in the Diabetes Attitudes, Wishes and Needs survey, including psychological well-being, diabetes distress, patient empowerment, self-management, and patient reported healthcare provision. Clinical characteristics measured included diabetes comorbidities, complications and treatment. OLS regression analyses were used to estimate how health status varied with different characteristics. Results Altogether 1614 patients with type 2 diabetes aged 18–65 years from 6 districts/counties in Jiangsu Province were included in the study. With general characteristics and clinical factors controlled for, psychological well-being among all psychosocial outcomes had the most significant association with health status, with a difference of 9.2 in VAS scores between likely depression and good well-being. VAS scores were also significantly lower in patients with high diabetes distress and significantly higher in those more frequently conducting physical activities. Other psychosocial outcomes were not significantly associated with health status. Conclusions Likely depression and diabetes-related distress are negatively associated with health status while frequently conducting physical activities are positively associated with health status of type 2 diabetes patients aged 18–65 years from 6 districts/counties in Jiangsu Provinces. These findings underscore the necessity of undertaking routine assessment for depression and diabetes distress and prioritizing interventions on promoting regular physical activities in diabetic patients to improve health management and achieve better health outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2789955027,"Head movements allow birds with laterally placed eyes to move their centers of acute vision around and align them with objects of interest. Consequently, head movements have been used as indicator of fixation behavior (where gaze is maintained). However, studies on head movement behavior have not elucidated the degree to which birds use high-acuity or low-acuity vision. We studied how European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) used high-acuity vision in the early stages of visual exploration of a stuffed cat (common terrestrial predator), a taxidermy Cooper's hawk (common aerial predator), and a stuffed study skin of a conspecific. We found that starlings tended to use their high acuity vision when looking at predators, particularly, the cat was above chance levels. However, when they viewed a conspecific, they used high acuity vision as expected by chance. We did not observe a preference for the left or right center of acute vision. Our findings suggest that starlings exposed to a predator (particularly cats) may employ selective attention by using high-acuity vision to obtain quickly detailed information useful for a potential escape, but exposed to a social context may use divided attention by allocating similar levels high- and low-quality vision to monitor both conspecifics and the rest of the environment."
https://openalex.org/W2790206307,"Background Identifying pre-ART factors associated with the emergence of HIV-1 drug resistance is critical for optimizing strategies to prevent virologic failure. A previous study reported that lower pre-ART HIV-1 pol diversity was associated with higher risk of virologic failure in HIV-1-infected children. To investigate this association in adults, we measured HIV-1 diversity with deep sequencing in pre-ART samples from adults with well-characterized virologic outcomes in a study (A5142) of initial ART conducted by the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG). Methods We identified 22 cases in ACTG A5142 who experienced virologic failure with drug resistance mutations in RT and 44 matched controls who did not experience virologic failure. cDNA was synthesized from plasma HIV-1 RNA. Each cDNA molecule was tagged with a unique primer ID and RT codons 41–103 were amplified and deep sequenced. Sequences with the same tag were aligned and a consensus was generated to reduce PCR and sequencing errors. Diversity was calculated by measuring average pairwise distance (APD) of the consensus sequences. An exact conditional logistic regression model with percent APD as the risk factor estimated the odds ratio for VF and the corresponding 95% confidence interval. Results Consensus single-genome sequences and diversity estimates of pol were obtained for pre-ART samples from 21 cases and 42 controls. The median (IQR) pre-ART percent APD was 0.71 (0.31–1.13) in cases and 0.58 (0.32–0.94) in controls. A possible trend was found for higher diversity being associated with greater risk of virologic failure in adults (OR = 2.2 per one percent APD increase, 95% CI = [0.8, 7.2]; p = 0.15). Conclusions This study in adults suggests there is a positive association between higher pre-ART pol diversity and the risk of virologic failure in adults rather than an inverse relationship reported in children."

We aimed to elucidate the drug mechanism and anti-tumor efficacy of TTAC-0001, a novel, fully human anti-VEGFR-2/KDR monoclonal antibody, in mouse orthotopic breast cancer model using multi-modal bioimaging.We used orthotopic xenograft tumor model in which human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) were injected into the right mammary fat pad of Balb/c nude mice. We investigated its biodistribution using serial fluorescence imaging after injecting fluorescent-labelled-drug and mode of action using Matrigel plug angiogenesis assays. The anti-tumor efficacy of drug was assessed using ultrasonography and bioluminescence imaging. Histopathologic analyses, including hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry with anti-CD31 and anti-Ki-67 antibodies, were performed. Each experiment had four groups: control, bevacizumab 10 mg/kg (BVZ-10 group), TTAC-0001 2 mg/kg (TTAC-2 group), and TTAC-0001 10 mg/kg (TTAC-10 group).The TTAC-10 group showed good tumor targeting that lasted for at least 6 days and had a good anti-angiogenic effect with decreased hemoglobin content and fewer CD31-positive cells in the Matrigel plug. Compared with BVZ-10 and TTAC-2 groups, the TTAC-10 group showed the strongest anti-tumor efficacy, inhibiting tumor growth as detected by ultrasonography and bioluminescence imaging. The TTAC-10 group also showed the lowest viable tumor and micro-vessel areas and the lowest Ki-67 index in histopathologic analyses.We firstly demonstrated that TTAC-0001 effectively inhibited tumor growth and neovascularization in mouse orthotopic breast cancer model. It may provide a future treatment option for breast cancer."
