https://openalex.org/W2073563548,"The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is involved in the regulation of immune responses, T-cell differentiation, and immunity. Here, we show that inflammatory stimuli such as LPS induce the expression of AhR in human dendritic cells (DC) associated with an AhR-dependent increase of CYP1A1 (cytochrome P4501A1). In vivo data confirmed the elevated expression of AhR by LPS and the LPS-enhanced 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD)-mediated induction of CYP1A1 in thymus of B6 mice. Inhibition of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) repressed both normal and LPS-enhanced, TCDD-inducible, AhR-dependent gene expression and canonical pathway control of RelA-regulated AhR-responsive gene expression. LPS-mediated induction of AhR was NF-κB-dependent, as shown in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from Rel null mice. AhR expression and TCDD-mediated induction of CYP1A1 was significantly reduced in RelA-deficient MEF compared with wild type MEF cells and ectopic expression of RelA restored the expression of AhR and induction of CYP1A1 in MEF RelA null cells. Promoter analysis of the human AhR gene identified three putative NF-κB-binding elements upstream of the transcription start site. Mutation analysis of the AhR promoter identified one NF-κB site as responsible for mediating the induction of AhR expression by LPS and electrophoretic shift assays demonstrated that this NF-κB motif is recognized by the RelA/p50 heterodimer. Our results show for the first time that NF-κB RelA is a critical component regulating the expression of AhR and the induction of AhR-dependent gene expression in immune cells illustrating the interaction of AhR and NF-κB signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2152051874,"The activation of mTOR signaling is essential for mechanically induced changes in skeletal muscle mass, and previous studies have suggested that mechanical stimuli activate mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling through a phospholipase D (PLD)-dependent increase in the concentration of phosphatidic acid (PA). Consistent with this conclusion, we obtained evidence which further suggests that mechanical stimuli utilize PA as a direct upstream activator of mTOR signaling. Unexpectedly though, we found that the activation of PLD is not necessary for the mechanically induced increases in PA or mTOR signaling. Motivated by this observation, we performed experiments that were aimed at identifying the enzyme(s) that promotes the increase in PA. These experiments revealed that mechanical stimulation increases the concentration of diacylglycerol (DAG) and the activity of DAG kinases (DGKs) in membranous structures. Furthermore, using knock-out mice, we determined that the ζ isoform of DGK (DGKζ) is necessary for the mechanically induced increase in PA. We also determined that DGKζ significantly contributes to the mechanical activation of mTOR signaling, and this is likely driven by an enhanced binding of PA to mTOR. Last, we found that the overexpression of DGKζ is sufficient to induce muscle fiber hypertrophy through an mTOR-dependent mechanism, and this event requires DGKζ kinase activity (i.e. the synthesis of PA). Combined, these results indicate that DGKζ, but not PLD, plays an important role in mechanically induced increases in PA and mTOR signaling. Furthermore, this study suggests that DGKζ could be a fundamental component of the mechanism(s) through which mechanical stimuli regulate skeletal muscle mass."

However, the mechanisms underlying the anticancer effect of WA are not fully understood. Herein, we report that tubulin is a novel target of WA-mediated growth arrest in human breast cancer cells. The G2 and mitotic arrest resulting from WA exposure in MCF-7, SUM159, and SK-BR-3 cells was associated with a marked decrease in protein levels of β-tubulin. These effects were not observed with the naturally occurring C6,C7-epoxy analogs of WA (withanone and withanolide A). A non-tumorigenic normal mammary epithelial cell line (MCF-10A) was markedly more resistant to mitotic arrest by WA compared with breast cancer cells. Vehicle-treated control cells exhibited a normal bipolar spindle with chromosomes aligned along the metaphase plate. In contrast, WA treatment led to a severe disruption of normal spindle morphology. NMR analyses revealed that the A-ring enone in WA, but not in withanone or withanolide A, was highly reactive with cysteamine and rapidly succumbed to irreversible nucleophilic addition. Mass spectrometry demonstrated direct covalent binding of WA to Cys(303) of β-tubulin in MCF-7 cells. Molecular docking indicated that the WA-binding pocket is located on the surface of β-tubulin and characterized by a hydrophobic floor, a hydrophobic wall, and a charge-balanced hydrophilic entrance. These results provide novel insights into the mechanism of growth arrest by WA in breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W1972281096,"There is compelling evidence that aminoglycoside (AG) antibiotics can induce the mammalian ribosome to suppress disease-causing nonsense mutations and partially restore the expression of functional proteins. However, prolonged AG treatment can cause detrimental side effects in patients, including most prominently, ototoxicity. Recent mechanistic discussions have considered the relative contributions of mitochondrial and cytoplasmic protein synthesis inhibition to AG-induced ototoxicity. We show that AGs inhibit mitochondrial protein synthesis in mammalian cells and perturb cell respiration, leading to a time- and dose-dependent increase in superoxide overproduction and accumulation of free ferrous iron in mitochondria caused by oxidative damage of mitochondrial aconitase, ultimately leading to cell apoptosis via the Fenton reaction. These deleterious effects increase with the increased potency of AG to inhibit the mitochondrial rather than cytoplasmic protein synthesis, which in turn correlates with their ototoxic potential in both murine cochlear explants and the guinea pig in vivo. The deleterious effects of AGs were alleviated in synthetic derivatives specially designed for the treatment of genetic diseases caused by nonsense mutations and possessing low affinity toward mitochondrial ribosomes. This work highlights the benefit of a mechanism-based drug redesign strategy that can maximize the translational value of ""readthrough therapy"" while mitigating drug-induced side effects. This approach holds promise for patients suffering from genetic diseases caused by nonsense mutations."
https://openalex.org/W1971514107,"Accumulating evidence suggest that the pyridine nucleotide NAD has far wider biological functions than its classical role in energy metabolism. NAD is used by hundreds of enzymes that catalyze substrate oxidation and, as such, it plays a key role in various biological processes such as aging, cell death, and oxidative stress. It has been suggested that changes in the ratio of free cytosolic [NAD(+)]/[NADH] reflects metabolic alterations leading to, or correlating with, pathological states. We have designed an isotopically labeled metabolic bioprobe of free cytosolic [NAD(+)]/[NADH] by combining a magnetic enhancement technique (hyperpolarization) with cellular glycolytic activity. The bioprobe reports free cytosolic [NAD(+)]/[NADH] ratios based on dynamically measured in-cell [pyruvate]/[lactate] ratios. We demonstrate its utility in breast and prostate cancer cells. The free cytosolic [NAD(+)]/[NADH] ratio determined in prostate cancer cells was 4 times higher than in breast cancer cells. This higher ratio reflects a distinct metabolic phenotype of prostate cancer cells consistent with previously reported alterations in the energy metabolism of these cells. As a reporter on free cytosolic [NAD(+)]/[NADH] ratio, the bioprobe will enable better understanding of the origin of diverse pathological states of the cell as well as monitor cellular consequences of diseases and/or treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2021910242,"Oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) is associated with various neurological disorders including aging, neurodegenerative diseases, as well as traumatic and ischemic insults. Astrocytes have an important role in the anti-oxidative defense in the brain. The gap junction protein connexin43 (Cx43) forms intercellular channels as well as hemichannels in astrocytes. In the present study, we investigated the contribution of Cx43 to astrocytic death induced by the ROS hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and the mechanism by which Cx43 exerts its effects. Lack of Cx43 expression or blockage of Cx43 channels resulted in increased ROS-induced astrocytic death, supporting a cell protective effect of functional Cx43 channels. H2O2 transiently increased hemichannel activity, but reduced gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC). GJIC in wild-type astrocytes recovered after 7 h, but was absent in Cx43 knock-out astrocytes. Blockage of Cx43 hemichannels incompletely inhibited H2O2-induced hemichannel activity, indicating the presence of other hemichannel proteins. Panx1, which is predicted to be a major hemichannel contributor in astrocytes, did not appear to have any cell protective effect from H2O2 insults. Our data suggest that GJIC is important for Cx43-mediated ROS resistance. In contrast to hypoxia/reoxygenation, H2O2 treatment decreased the ratio of the hypophosphorylated isoform to total Cx43 level. Cx43 has been reported to promote astrocytic death induced by hypoxia/reoxygenation. We therefore speculate the increase in Cx43 dephosphorylation may account for the facilitation of astrocytic death. Our findings suggest that the role of Cx43 in response to cellular stress is dependent on the activation of signaling pathways leading to alteration of Cx43 phosphorylation states."
https://openalex.org/W2063028509,"When starved for nitrogen, non-growing cells of the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris continue to metabolize acetate and produce H2, an important industrial chemical and potential biofuel. The enzyme nitrogenase catalyzes H2 formation. The highest H2 yields are obtained when cells are deprived of N2 and thus use available electrons to synthesize H2 as the exclusive product of nitrogenase. To understand how R. palustris responds metabolically to increase H2 yields when it is starved for N2, and thus not growing, we tracked changes in biomass composition and global transcript levels. In addition to a 3.5-fold higher H2 yield by non-growing cells we also observed an accumulation of polyhydroxybutyrate to over 30% of the dry cell weight. The transcriptome of R. palustris showed down-regulation of biosynthetic processes and up-regulation of nitrogen scavenging mechanisms in response to N2 starvation but gene expression changes did not point to metabolic activities that could generate the reductant necessary to explain the high H2 yield. We therefore tracked (13)C-labeled acetate through central metabolic pathways. We found that non-growing cells shifted their metabolism to use the tricarboxylic acid cycle to metabolize acetate in contrast to growing cells, which used the glyoxylate cycle exclusively. This shift enabled cells to more fully oxidize acetate, providing the necessary reducing power to explain the high H2 yield."
https://openalex.org/W2170390407,"Nitric oxide is an important molecule in all domains of life with significant biological functions in both pro- and eukaryotes. Anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing (anammox) bacteria that contribute substantially to the release of fixed nitrogen into the atmosphere use the oxidizing power of NO to activate inert ammonium into hydrazine (N2H4). Here, we describe an enzyme from the anammox bacterium Kuenenia stuttgartiensis that uses a novel pathway to make NO from hydroxylamine. This new enzyme is related to octaheme hydroxylamine oxidoreductase, a key protein in aerobic ammonium-oxidizing bacteria. By a multiphasic approach including the determination of the crystal structure of the K. stuttgartiensis enzyme at 1.8 Å resolution and refinement and reassessment of the hydroxylamine oxidoreductase structure from Nitrosomonas europaea, both in the presence and absence of their substrates, we propose a model for NO formation by the K. stuttgartiensis enzyme. Our results expand the understanding of the functions that the widespread family of octaheme proteins have."
https://openalex.org/W2007069676,"Deregulation of androgen receptor (AR) splice variants has been implicated to play a role in prostate cancer development and progression. To understand their functions in prostate, we established a transgenic mouse model (AR3Tg) with targeted expression of the constitutively active and androgen-independent AR splice variant AR3 (a.k.a. AR-V7) in prostate epithelium. We found that overexpression of AR3 modulates expression of a number of tumor-promoting autocrine/paracrine growth factors (including Tgfβ2 and Igf1) and expands prostatic progenitor cell population, leading to development of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. In addition, we showed that some epithelial-mesenchymal transition-associated genes are up-regulated in AR3Tg prostates, suggesting that AR3 may antagonize AR activity and halt the differentiation process driven by AR and androgen. This notion is supported by our observations that the number of Ck5(+)/Ck8(+) intermediate cells is increased in AR3Tg prostates after castration, and expression of AR3 transgene in these intermediate cells compromises prostate epithelium regeneration upon androgen replacement. Our results demonstrate that AR3 is a driver of prostate cancer, at least in part, through modulating multiple tumor-promoting autocrine/paracrine factors."
https://openalex.org/W1975317689,"Appropriate mitochondrial transport and distribution are essential for neurons because of the high energy and Ca2+ buffering requirements at synapses. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays an essential role in regulating synaptic transmission and plasticity. However, whether and how BDNF can regulate mitochondrial transport and distribution are still unclear. Here, we find that in cultured hippocampal neurons, application of BDNF for 15 min decreased the percentage of moving mitochondria in axons, a process dependent on the activation of the TrkB receptor and its downstream PI3K and phospholipase-Cγ signaling pathways. Moreover, the BDNF-induced mitochondrial stopping requires the activation of transient receptor potential canonical 3 and 6 (TRPC3 and TRPC6) channels and elevated intracellular Ca2+ levels. The Ca2+ sensor Miro1 plays an important role in this process. Finally, the BDNF-induced mitochondrial stopping leads to the accumulation of more mitochondria at presynaptic sites. Mutant Miro1 lacking the ability to bind Ca2+ prevents BDNF-induced mitochondrial presynaptic accumulation and synaptic transmission, suggesting that Miro1-mediated mitochondrial motility is involved in BDNF-induced mitochondrial presynaptic docking and neurotransmission. Together, these data suggest that mitochondrial transport and distribution play essential roles in BDNF-mediated synaptic transmission.

https://openalex.org/W2104682960,"Previously, we found that basal-like ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) contains cancer stem-like cells. Here, we characterize stem-like subpopulations in a model of basal-like DCIS and identify subpopulations of CD49f+/CD24- stem-like cells that possess aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 activity. We found that these cells show enhanced migration potential compared with non-stem DCIS cells. We also found that the chemopreventive agent sulforaphane can target these DCIS stem-like cells, reduce aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) expression, and decrease mammosphere and progenitor colony formation. Furthermore, we characterized exosomal trafficking of microRNAs in DCIS and found that several microRNAs (miRs) including miR-140, miR-29a, and miR-21 are differentially expressed in exosomes from DCIS stem-like cells. We found that SFN treatment could reprogram DCIS stem-like cells as evidenced by significant changes in exosomal secretion more closely resembling that of non-stem cancer cells. Finally, we demonstrated that exosomal secretion of miR-140 might impact signaling in nearby breast cancer cells."

Dedicated glyoxalases convert methylglyoxal to d-lactate using multiple catalytic strategies. In this study, the DJ-1 superfamily member ORF 19.251/GLX3 from Candida albicans is shown to possess glyoxalase activity, making this the first demonstrated glutathione-independent glyoxalase in fungi. The crystal structure of Glx3p indicates that the protein is a monomer containing the catalytic triad Cys136-His137-Glu168.

A close Glx3p homolog from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (YDR533C/Hsp31) also has glyoxalase activity, suggesting that fungal members of the Hsp31 clade of the DJ-1 superfamily are all probable glutathione-independent glyoxalases. A homozygous glx3 null mutant in C. albicans strain SC5314 displays greater sensitivity to millimolar levels of exogenous methylglyoxal, elevated levels of intracellular methylglyoxal, and carbon source-dependent growth defects, especially when grown on glycerol. These phenotypic defects are complemented by restoration of the wild-type GLX3 locus. The growth defect of Glx3-deficient cells in glycerol is also partially complemented by added inorganic phosphate, which is not observed for wild-type or glucose-grown cells. Therefore, C. albicans Glx3 and its fungal homologs are physiologically relevant glutathione-independent glyoxalases that are not redundant with the previously characterized glutathione-dependent GLO1/GLO2 system.

https://openalex.org/W2120310638,"Type 2 diabetes, hepatic steatosis, and gut dysbiosis are pathophysiological consequences of obesity. Sirtuin (SIRT)-1 is a protein deacetylase implicated in the regulation of metabolic activity. We set out to determine whether the catalytic activity of SIRT1 plays a role in the development of metabolic syndrome, hepatic steatosis, and the distribution of gut microbiota. We challenged with a high-fat diet (HFD) a strain of mice homozygous for a Sirt1 allele carrying a point mutation that ablates the deacetylase activity of SIRT1. When compared to wild-type animals, mice lacking SIRT1 catalytic activity rapidly accumulated excessive hepatic lipid while fed the HFD, an effect evident within 2 wk of HFD feeding. Both white and brown adipose depots became hypertrophic, and the animals developed insulin resistance. The ratio of the major phyla of gut microbiota (Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes) increased rapidly in the SIRT1-deficient mice after HFD challenge. We conclude that the deacetylase activity of SIRT1 plays an important role in regulating glucose and hepatic lipid homeostasis. In addition, the composition of gut microbiota is influenced by both the animals' Sirt1 genotype and diet composition.—Caron, A. Z., He, X., Mottawea, W., Seifert, E.

Matrix proteins in the shell are responsible for nucleation and growth of calcium carbonate crystals. However, there is no direct evidence supporting a connection between matrix proteins and magnesium. Here, we identified a novel acidic matrix protein named PfN44 that affected aragonite formation in the shell of the pearl oyster Pinctada fucata. Using immunogold labeling assays, we found PfN44 in both the nacreous and prismatic layers. In shell repair, PfN44 was repressed, whereas other matrix proteins were up-regulated. Disturbing the function of PfN44 by RNAi led to the deposition of porous nacreous tablets with overgrowth of crystals in the nacreous layer. By in vitro circular dichroism spectra and fluorescence quenching, we found that PfN44 bound to both calcium and magnesium with a stronger affinity for magnesium. During in vitro calcium carbonate crystallization and calcification of amorphous calcium carbonate, PfN44 regulated the magnesium content of crystalline carbonate polymorphs and stabilized magnesium calcite to inhibit aragonite deposition. Taken together, our results suggested that by stabilizing magnesium calcite to inhibit aragonite deposition, PfN44 participated in P. fucata shell formation.

https://openalex.org/W2018764627,"The circadian clock network is well known to link food intake and metabolic outputs. Phosphorus is a pivotal nutritional factor involved in energy and skeletal metabolisms and possesses a circadian profile in the circulation; however, the precise mechanisms whereby phosphate metabolism is regulated by the circadian clock network remain largely unknown. Because sympathetic tone, which displays a circadian profile, is activated by food intake, we tested the hypothesis that phosphate metabolism was regulated by the circadian clock network through the modification of food intake-associated sympathetic activation. Skeletal Fgf23 expression showed higher expression during the dark phase (DP) associated with elevated circulating FGF23 levels and enhanced phosphate excretion in the urine. The peaks in skeletal Fgf23 expression and urine epinephrine levels, a marker for sympathetic tone, shifted from DP to the light phase (LP) when mice were fed during LP. Interestingly, β-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol (ISO), induced skeletal Fgf23 expression when administered at ZT12, but this was not observed in Bmal1-deficient mice. In vitro reporter assays revealed that ISO trans-activated Fgf23 promoter through a cAMP responsive element in osteoblastic UMR-106 cells. The mechanism of circadian regulation of Fgf23 induction by ISO in vivo was partly explained by the suppressive effect of Cryptochrome1 (Cry1) on ISO signaling. These results indicate that the regulation of skeletal Fgf23 expression by sympathetic activity is dependent on the circadian clock system and may shed light on new regulatory networks of FGF23 that could be important for understanding the physiology of phosphate metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1996485329,"Pladienolide B (PB) is a potent cancer cell growth inhibitor that targets the SF3B1 subunit of the spliceosome. There is considerable interest in the compound as a potential chemotherapeutic, as well as a tool to study SF3B1 function in splicing and cancer development. The molecular structure of PB, a bacterial natural product, contains a 12-member macrolide ring with an extended epoxide-containing side chain. Using a novel concise enantioselective synthesis, we created a series of PB structural analogs and the structurally related compound herboxidiene. We show that two methyl groups in the PB side chain, as well as a feature of the macrolide ring shared with herboxidiene, are required for splicing inhibition in vitro. Unexpectedly, we find that the epoxy group contributes only modestly to PB potency and is not absolutely necessary for activity. The orientations of at least two chiral centers off the macrolide ring have no effect on PB activity. Importantly, the ability of analogs to inhibit splicing in vitro directly correlated with their effects in a series of cellular assays. Those effects likely arise from inhibition of some, but not all, endogenous splicing events in cells, as previously reported for the structurally distinct SF3B1 inhibitor spliceostatin A. Together, our data support the idea that the impact of PB on cells is derived from its ability to impair the function of SF3B1 in splicing and also demonstrate that simplification of the PB scaffold is feasible."

Vasoconstrictor agonists binding to Gq/11-coupled receptors have been reported to suppress the activity of Kv7 channels in vascular smooth muscle cells, leading to membrane depolarization and enhanced Ca2+ influx via L-type voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels (11Mackie A.R.

Pharmacol. 2013; 61: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Furthermore, based on pharmacological and electrophysiological approaches, we proposed that Kv7.4 and Kv7.5 form predominantly heteromeric channels in vascular smooth muscle cells (22Brueggemann L.I. Mackie A.R. Martin J.L. Cribbs L.L. Byron K.L. Diclofenac distinguishes among homomeric and heteromeric potassium channels composed of KCNQ4 and KCNQ5 subunits.Mol. Pharmacol. 2011; 79: 10-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, biochemical evidence for the formation and regulation of endogenous Kv7.4/7.5 heteromers is lacking. It remains to be determined whether the Kv7.4 and Kv7.5 subunits in vascular smooth muscle cells are phosphorylated or if they are equally sensitive to PKC-dependent regulation by vasoconstrictor agonists. Our previous studies revealed that the vasoconstrictor hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) 2The abbreviations used are:AVParginine vasopressinMASMCmesenteric artery smooth muscle cellANOVAanalysis of varianceFKBPFK506-binding proteinFRBFKBP12-rapamycin-binding elementMAmesenteric arteryPLAproximity ligation assayPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateDNdominant-negative. induces translocation of PKCα from the cytosol to the plasma membrane in A7r5 rat aortic smooth muscle cells (23Fan J.

Here we provide evidence that endogenous Kv7.4 and Kv7.5 subunits form heteromeric channels and that activation of PKCα is sufficient to reduce endogenous Kv7 channel activity in both A7r5 cells and rat mesenteric artery smooth muscle cells (MASMCs). We further demonstrate that both Kv7.4 and Kv7.5 channel proteins can undergo PKC-dependent phosphorylation, which depends on the multimeric state of the Kv7 channels.

This vector also expresses a FKBP12-rapamycin-binding element. Upon rapamycin treatment, the FKBP12-rapamycin-binding element recruits the PKCα-FKBP to the plasma membrane, which results in the activation of PKCα (24Navedo M.F. Cheng E.P. Yuan C. Votaw S.

Single amino acid substitutions at residues located in the pore region (P-loop) of Kv7.4 and Kv7.5 (G285S in Kv7.4 and G278S in Kv7.5) channels have been found to exert dominant-negative (DN) effects on Kv7 channel conductance (7Kubisch C.

Bicistronic adenoviruses Adv-hKCNQ4(G285S) and Adv-hKCNQ5(G278S), created using the AdEasyTM Adenoviral Vector System (Stratagene) according to manufacturer's instructions, were amplified, purified on CsCl gradients, and stored at −80 °C until use. A7r5 cells were cultured as described previously (26Byron K.L. Taylor C.W. Spontaneous Ca2+ spiking in a vascular smooth muscle cell line is independent of the release of intracellular Ca2+ stores.J.

For overexpression studies, subcultured A7r5 cells were infected with Adv-hKCNQ4 or Adv-hKCNQ5 or both at a multiplicity of infection of 100, plated at 30% confluence, replated 3 days later at a 1:2 dilution and used for immunoprecipitation experiments or electrophysiological measurements 10–12 days after infection. For PKCα translocation studies, A7r5 cells were infected with PKCα-FKBP adenovirus or GFP virus with a multiplicity of infection of 100 and used 3 days later for electrophysiological measurements and fluorescence imaging. Cells expressing the exogenous proteins were identified based on detection of GFP fluorescence. All animal studies were approved by the Loyola University Chicago Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and conducted in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Academy of Sciences, Washington, D. C.). Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with isoflurane and segments of the small intestinal mesentery were surgically removed as described previously (27Henderson K.K. Byron K.L.

The methods for infection of MASMCs in intact arterial segments were adapted from a protocol kindly provided by Dr. Dee Van Riper (Albany Medical College, Albany, NY). Virus-containing medium was prepared as follows: 90 μl of adenoviral stock (1 × 1010 to 8 × 1010 particles/ml based on absorbance at 260 nm) was combined with 10 μl of antennapedia peptide (H2N-RQIAIWFQNRRMKWAA-OH, New England Peptide LLC, 0.1 mm) for 30 min; 900 μl of serum-free DMEM (supplemented with 4.5 g/liter of glucose, 110 mg/liter of pyruvate, and 584 mg/liter of l-glutamine) was added to the adenovirus/antennapedia mixture. The antennapedia peptide has been shown to increase the infection rate (28Gratton J.P. Yu J. Griffith J.W. Babbitt R.W. Scotland R.S. Hickey R. Giordano F.J. Sessa W.C.

Med. 2003; 9: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Mesenteric arteries were cleared of adventitia and adipose tissue. A specially designed chamber containing one glass pipette connected to a pressure column was used to remove the endothelium and infect the arterial segments. One end of each arterial segment was cannulated on a glass pipette and tied in place using nylon suture. Luminal blood was removed and endothelium denudation was performed as described previously (29Brueggemann L.I. Mackie A.R. Mani B.K. Cribbs L.L. Byron K.L.

Pharmacol. 2009; 76: 1053-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Once denuded, the arterial lumen was filled with DMEM containing one of the adenoviruses, tied off using nylon suture, and pressurized to 80 mm Hg. Each arterial segment was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h under 80 mm Hg pressure, transferred to a 35-mm dish containing 2 ml of DMEM/F-12 media supplemented with insulin/transferrin/selenium (Sigma), and placed in a cell culture incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) for 24 h. Efficiency of infection was assessed by the expression of GFP fluorescence in smooth muscle cells of intact arteries (Fig. 3A). MASMCs from infected arteries were isolated as described previously (11Mackie A.R. Brueggemann L.I. Henderson K.K. Shiels A.J. Cribbs L.L. Scrogin K.E. Byron K.L.

Based on the presence of detectable GFP fluorescence in MASMCs isolated from infected arteries, ∼30–50% of the myocytes in infected arteries expressed the exogenous constructs. Freshly isolated MASMCs were kept on ice until use. For electrophysiological recordings, the cell suspension was added to a recording chamber with a 25-mm glass coverslip base and allowed to adhere for at least 15 min at room temperature. The whole cell perforated patch configuration was used to measure membrane currents in smooth muscle cells under voltage-clamp conditions. All experiments were performed at room temperature with continuous perfusion of bath solution as described previously (11Mackie A.R. Brueggemann L.I. Henderson K.K. Shiels A.J. Cribbs L.L.

To isolate Kv7 currents, 100 μm GdCl3 (sufficient to block L- and T-type Ca2+ channels, non-selective cation channels, and to shift activation of 4-AP-sensitive Kv channels to more positive voltages) was added to external solutions (12Brueggemann L.I.

Voltage-clamp command voltages were generated using an Axopatch 200B amplifier under control of PCLAMP8 software. 120 μg/ml of Amphotericin B in the internal solution was used for membrane patch perforation. Series resistances after amphotericin perforation were 8–15 MΩ and were compensated by 60% in cells overexpressing Kv7 channels. Whole-cell currents were digitized at 2 kHz and filtered at 1 kHz. The last 2000 points recorded during each voltage step (corresponding to 1000 ms recording time) were averaged and normalized by cell capacitance to obtain end pulse steady-state K+ current. Stable currents were recorded for at least 15 min prior to drug application. Overexpressed hKv7 currents were recorded using a 5-s voltage step protocol from a −74 mV holding voltage to test voltages ranging from −114 to −4 mV followed by a 1-s step to −30 mV. To analyze the voltage dependence of channel activation the conductance (G) was calculated from steady-state K+ currents according to the equation: G = I/(V − Erev), where I is the steady-state current, V is the step potential, and Erev is the reversal potential (30Wickenden A.D.

https://openalex.org/W2060094721,"The target of rapamycin (TOR) kinase pathway regulates various biological processes, including translation, synthesis of ribosomal proteins, and transcription of rRNA. The ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6) is one of the well known downstream components of the TOR pathway. Ribosomal proteins have been known to have diverse functions in regulating cellular metabolism as well as protein synthesis. So far, however, little is known about other possible role(s) of RPS6 in plants, besides being a component of the 40 S ribosomal subunit and acting as a target of TOR. Here, we report that RPS6 may have a novel function via interaction with histone deacetylase 2B (AtHD2B) that belongs to the plant-specific histone deacetylase HD2 family. RPS6 and AtHD2B were localized to the nucleolus. Co-expression of RPS6 and AtHD2B caused a change in the location of both RPS6 and AtHD2B to one or several nucleolar spots. ChIP analysis suggests that RPS6 directly interacts with the rRNA gene promoter. Protoplasts overexpressing both AtHD2B and RPS6 exhibited down-regulation of pre-18 S rRNA synthesis with a concomitant decrease in transcription of some of the ribosomal proteins, suggesting their direct role in ribosome biogenesis and plant development. This is consistent with the mutation in rps6b that results in reduction in 18 S rRNA transcription and decreased root growth. We propose that the interaction between RPS6 and AtHD2B brings about a change in the chromatin structure of rDNA and thus plays an important role in linking TOR signaling to rDNA transcription and ribosome biogenesis in plants. The target of rapamycin (TOR) kinase pathway regulates various biological processes, including translation, synthesis of ribosomal proteins, and transcription of rRNA. The ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6) is one of the well known downstream components of the TOR pathway.

So far, however, little is known about other possible role(s) of RPS6 in plants, besides being a component of the 40 S ribosomal subunit and acting as a target of TOR. Here, we report that RPS6 may have a novel function via interaction with histone deacetylase 2B (AtHD2B) that belongs to the plant-specific histone deacetylase HD2 family. RPS6 and AtHD2B were localized to the nucleolus. Co-expression of RPS6 and AtHD2B caused a change in the location of both RPS6 and AtHD2B to one or several nucleolar spots. ChIP analysis suggests that RPS6 directly interacts with the rRNA gene promoter. Protoplasts overexpressing both AtHD2B and RPS6 exhibited down-regulation of pre-18 S rRNA synthesis with a concomitant decrease in transcription of some of the ribosomal proteins, suggesting their direct role in ribosome biogenesis and plant development. This is consistent with the mutation in rps6b that results in reduction in 18 S rRNA transcription and decreased root growth. We propose that the interaction between RPS6 and AtHD2B brings about a change in the chromatin structure of rDNA and thus plays an important role in linking TOR signaling to rDNA transcription and ribosome biogenesis in plants."

Double negative T cells have been claimed to derive from CD8+ cells that down-regulate CD8 co-receptors and acquire a distinct effector phenotype that includes the expression of proinflammatory cytokines. This, along with the fact that double negative T cells have been documented in inflamed organs, suggests that they may contribute to disease expression and tissue damage. We recently linked the transcription factor cAMP responsive element modulator (CREM) α, which is expressed at increased levels in T cells from SLE patients and lupus prone MRL/lpr mice, with trans-repression of a region syntenic to the murine CD8b promoter. However, the exact molecular mechanisms that result in a stable silencing of both CD8A and CD8B genes remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that CREMα orchestrates epigenetic remodeling of the CD8 cluster through the recruitment of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) 3a and histone methyltransferase G9a. Thus, we propose that CREMα is essential for the expansion of double negative T cells in SLE. CREMα blockade may have therapeutic value in autoimmune disorders with DN T cell expansion.

Most research so far has focused on flow-mediated dilation (FMD) only; the effects on other factors relevant to endothelial health, such as inflammation and leukocyte adhesion, have hardly been addressed. We investigated whether consumption of regular dark chocolate also affects other markers of endothelial health, and whether chocolate enrichment with flavanols has additional benefits. In a randomized double-blind crossover study, the effects of acute and of 4 wk daily consumption of high flavanol chocolate (HFC) and normal flavanol chocolate (NFC) on FMD, augmentation index (AIX), leukocyte count, plasma cytokines, and leukocyte cell surface molecules in overweight men (age 45-70 yr) were investigated. Sensory profiles and motivation scores to eat chocolate were also collected. Findings showed that a 4 wk chocolate intake increased FMD by 1%, which was paralleled by a decreased AIX of 1%, decreased leukocyte cell count, decreased plasma sICAM1 and sICAM3, and decreased leukocyte adhesion marker expression (P<0.05 for time effect), with no difference between HFC and NFC consumption. Flavanol enrichment did affect taste and negatively affected motivation to consume chocolate. This study provides new insights on how chocolate affects endothelial health by demonstrating that chocolate consumption, besides improving vascular function, also lowers the adherence capacity of leukocytes in the circulation."
https://openalex.org/W1981011903,"Biochemical and cell-based studies have identified the G0S2 (G0/G1 switch gene 2) as a selective inhibitor of the key intracellular triacylglycerol hydrolase, adipose triglyceride lipase. To better understand the physiological role of G0S2, we constructed an adipose tissue-specific G0S2 transgenic mouse model. In comparison with wild type animals, the transgenic mice exhibited a significant increase in overall fat mass and a decrease in peripheral triglyceride accumulation. Basal and adrenergically stimulated lipolysis was attenuated in adipose explants isolated from the transgenic mice. Following fasting or injection of a β3-adrenergic agonist, in vivo lipolysis and ketogenesis were decreased in G0S2 transgenic mice when compared with wild type animals. Consequently, adipose overexpression of G0S2 prevented the ""switch"" of energy substrate from carbohydrates to fatty acids during fasting. Moreover, G0S2 overexpression promoted accumulation of more and larger lipid droplets in brown adipocytes without impacting either mitochondrial morphology or expression of oxidative genes. This phenotypic change was accompanied by defective cold adaptation. Furthermore, feeding with a high fat diet caused a greater gain of both body weight and adiposity in the transgenic mice. The transgenic mice also displayed a decrease in fasting plasma levels of free fatty acid, triglyceride, and insulin as well as improved glucose and insulin tolerance. Cumulatively, these results indicate that fat-specific G0S2 overexpression uncouples adiposity from insulin sensitivity and overall metabolic health through inhibiting adipose lipolysis and decreasing circulating fatty acids."

Its major source is considered to be the pentose phosphate pathway, but cytosolic NADP+-dependent dehydrogenases using intermediates of mitochondrial pathways for substrates have been known to contribute. Photoreceptors, a nonproliferating cell type, provide a unique model for measuring the functional utilization of NADPH at the single cell level. In these cells, NADPH availability can be monitored from the reduction of the all-trans-retinal generated by light to all-trans-retinol using single cell fluorescence imaging. We have used mouse rod photoreceptors to investigate the generation of NADPH by different metabolic pathways.

Such pathways may play an important role in protecting against retinal degeneration. NADPH is a necessary cofactor for lipid and nucleotide biosynthesis and for many other cellular processes including maintenance of the cellular antioxidant system, nitric oxide synthesis, or the respiratory burst of immune cells (1Stanton R.C. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, NADPH, and cell survival.IUBMB Life. 2012; 64: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The oxidative phase of the pentose phosphate pathway, a branch of glycolysis, has long been considered the main pathway for the generation of cytosolic NADPH (see Fig. 1) (1Stanton R.C. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, NADPH, and cell survival.IUBMB Life. 2012; 64: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 2Nelson D.L. Cox M.M. Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry. Worth, New York2000: 558-562Google Scholar). NADPH can also be generated by cytosolic NADP+-dependent dehydrogenases utilizing isocitrate and malate as substrates. These substrates originate from the mitochondria where they also participate in the TCA cycle (see Fig. 1) (3Lunt S.Y. Vander Heiden M.G. Aerobic glycolysis.

The value of the fluorescence ratio for the endogenous retinoid that appears after bleaching is similar to that for all-trans-retinal. All experiments were performed at 37 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Isolated vertebrate photoreceptors provide a unique system to address these questions in a nonproliferating cell type: the generation of NADPH can be monitored at the single cell level through its utilization in a reduction reaction. Thus, we have examined the generation of NADPH by different metabolic pathways in single living rod photoreceptor cells isolated from wild type mouse retinas. The outer segment compartment of a vertebrate rod photoreceptor is a specialized organelle responsible for the detection of light (6Ebrey T. Koutalos Y. Vertebrate photoreceptors.Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2001; 20: 49-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). A single mouse rod outer segment contains ∼50 million molecules of the visual pigment rhodopsin, the primary light detector, packed at a concentration of ∼3 mm (7Lem J. Krasnoperova N.V. Calvert P.D. Kosaras B. Cameron D.A. Nicolò M. Makino C.L. Sidman R.L. Morphological, physiological, and biochemical changes in rhodopsin knockout mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 736-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Rhodopsin contains 11-cis-retinal as chromophore for the detection of light. Light absorption isomerizes the 11-cis-chromophore to all-trans, generating an enzymatically active intermediate that leads to the conversion of light to an electrical signal. Photoactivated rhodopsin subsequently releases its chromophore in the form of all-trans-retinal, which is reduced to all-trans-retinol in a reaction that requires NADPH (8Futterman S. Hendrickson A. Bishop P.E. Rollins M.H. Vacano E. Metabolism of glucose and reduction of retinaldehyde in retinal photoreceptors.J. Neurochem. 1970; 17: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In the presence of bright light, large quantities of all-trans-retinal are released, requiring an equivalent amount of NADPH for their reduction. Thus, the conversion of all-trans-retinal to retinol 2When the isomer is not specified, retinal and retinol refer to the all-trans isomers. provides a measure of the availability of NADPH. Fig. 1 shows a diagram of the metabolic pathways that can generate NADPH linked to its utilization for the reduction of all-trans-retinal to retinol. The metabolic machinery of the rod photoreceptor is present in the inner segment of the cell, whereas the reduction of retinal to retinol takes place in the outer segment. All-trans-retinal and retinol both fluoresce and have a large difference in excitation maxima (9Hubbard R. Brown P.K. Bownds D. Methodology of vitamin A and visual pigments.Methods Enzymol. 1971; 18C: 615-653Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar), which allows for the differentiation of their fluorescence signals (10Chen C.

A ratio of the fluorescence excited by two appropriately chosen wavelengths (340 and 380 nm) reflects the all-trans-retinol to retinal ratio, which is a measure of the conversion of all-trans-retinal to retinol, and thereby of NADPH availability as well. Using fluorescence imaging of single living mouse rod photoreceptors, we have found that mitochondria-linked pathways can and do support the generation of substantial amounts of NADPH to sustain ongoing cellular functions. These findings demonstrate the importance of mitochondrial support and of metabolites other than glucose in the generation of NADPH in nonproliferating cells. Wild type (129/Sv) and Rpe65−/− mice were from established colonies at the Medical University of South Carolina. The wild type colony was established from breeding pairs obtained from Harlan Laboratories (Indianapolis, IN); breeding pairs for the Rpe65−/− colony were a generous gift of Dr. T. M. Redmond. Animals were 2–3 months old and were kept in cyclic light with a 12-h light cycle (06:00–18:00). All animal procedures were carried out in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the Medical University of South Carolina and with the recommendations of the Panel on Euthanasia of the American Veterinary Medical Association. For experiments, the animals were dark-adapted overnight and sacrificed under dim red light, and the retinas were excised under either dim red or infrared light in mammalian physiological solution (130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 25 mm hemisodium-HEPES, 5 mm glucose, pH 7.40). Isolated rod photoreceptor cells were obtained as described (12Chen C. Blakeley L.R. Koutalos Y. Formation of all-trans retinol after visual pigment bleaching in mouse photoreceptors.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2009; 50: 3589-3595Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). All experiments were carried out with metabolically intact rod photoreceptors (10Chen C. Koutalos Y.

Stock solution of oligomycin was prepared in Me2SO and all-trans-retinol and -retinal in ethanol. For experiments, retinoids were added to a Ringer's solution containing 1% BSA as carrier. The final concentrations of Me2SO or ethanol were at most 0.05 and 0.1%, respectively, and had no effect on the fluorescence measurements.

Fluorescence was excited with narrow band pass (10-nm bandwidth) filters centered at 340 and 380 nm, and emission was collected for >420 nm. For an experiment, fluorescence images were initially recorded for the dark-adapted cell; the cell was subsequently bleached with >530-nm light for 1 min (12Chen C. Blakeley L.R. Koutalos Y. Formation of all-trans retinol after visual pigment bleaching in mouse photoreceptors.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2009; 50: 3589-3595Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and fluorescence images were recorded at different times after bleaching. For analysis, regions of interest were defined for the rod outer segment and for a background area; then the rod outer segment fluorescence was corrected for background. After background correction, the rod outer segment fluorescence intensities caused by retinal and retinol were obtained for each time point by subtracting the initial fluorescence intensities recorded for the dark-adapted cell. Subsequently, the ratio Fex-340/Fex-380 of the fluorescence intensities excited by 340- and 380-nm light was calculated for each time point after bleaching. Image acquisition and analysis were carried out using Slidebook (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Denver, CO). To measure the Fex-340/Fex-380 fluorescence ratios for all-trans-retinol and all-trans-retinal, broken off rod outer segments (rod outer segments separated from the rest of the cell) were loaded with 50 μm of either retinoid for 5 min, using 1% BSA as lipophilic carrier (10Chen C.

Chem. 2012; 287: 24662-24670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To determine the intracellular pH of rod outer segments, BCECF, a ratiometric pH-sensitive dye was used, following published procedures used with isolated salamander rod photoreceptors (13Chen C. Jiang Y. Koutalos Y. Dynamic behavior of rod photoreceptor disks.Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 1403-1412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Isolated mouse rod photoreceptors were incubated with 10 μm BCECF-AM for 30 min, followed by washes with Ringer's to remove remaining extracellular dye. BCECF fluorescence was excited with 495- and 440-nm light, and emission was measured >515 nm. The ratio F495/F440 of the fluorescence intensities excited by 495 nm (F495) and 440 nm (F440) depends on pH. The F495/F440 fluorescence ratio was converted to pH using a calibration curve obtained with BCECF (1 mm) in solutions of phosphate-buffered physiological saline with different pH. The possible interference of 4-CIN fluorescence with the measurement of the Fex-340/Fex-380 ratio was assessed in control experiments with Rpe65−/− rods, which contain negligible amounts of retinoids (14Redmond T.M. Yu S. Lee E. Bok D. Hamasaki D. Chen N. Goletz P. Ma J.X. Crouch R.K. Pfeifer K. Rpe65 is necessary for production of 11-cis-vitamin A in the retinal visual cycle.Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 344-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). This allowed the measurement of the levels of 4-CIN fluorescence in the absence of any retinoid fluorescence, and we concluded that 4-CIN fluorescence did not interfere with the Fex-340/Fex-380 measurements (see Fig. 9). Statistical significance was tested with analysis of variance. In the figures, statistically significant differences are indicated with asterisks. Following light exposure of dark-adapted rod photoreceptors, all-trans-retinal is released from photoactivated rhodopsin and is converted to all-trans-retinol using NADPH as a cofactor (Fig. 1). As retinal and retinol fluoresce with excitation maxima at different wavelengths, this conversion can be monitored from the relative intensities of the rod outer segment fluorescence excited by 340 and 380 nm. The ratio Fex-340/Fex-380 of the intensities of the fluorescence excited by 340- and 380-nm light is a measure of the fraction of the released all-trans-retinal converted to all-trans-retinol (10Chen C. Koutalos Y. Rapid formation of all-trans retinol after bleaching in frog and mouse rod photoreceptor outer segments.Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. 2010; 9: 1475-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 11Chen C. Thompson D.A. Koutalos Y.

Chem. 2012; 287: 24662-24670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The conversion depends on the availability of NADPH. In the absence of any available NADPH, there would be no conversion, and the fluorescence would be due solely to all-trans-retinal. On the other hand, if most of the NADP were maintained in the reduced form, the released retinal would be fully converted, and the fluorescence would be due solely to retinol. The values of the Fex-340/Fex-380 ratio for retinal and retinol were obtained by loading broken off rod outer segments with 50 μm of each retinoid. The values of the ratios were 0.55 ± 0.01 (n = 6) for retinal and 6.95 ± 0.14 (n = 8) for retinol (Fig. 2, A and B). These values correspond to limits of 0 and 1 for the fraction of NADPH present and are in close agreement with the values determined and reported previously for the inverse ratio Fex-380/Fex-340 (11Chen C. Thompson D.A. Koutalos Y. Reduction of all-trans-retinal in vertebrate rod photoreceptors requires the combined action of RDH8 and RDH12.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 24662-24670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Broken off rod outer segments were used for these control measurements because they are separated from the metabolic machinery of the cell and cannot process retinal or retinol (10Chen C. Koutalos Y.

Thus, in a broken off rod outer segment, the all-trans-retinal released from photoactivated rhodopsin has no access to NADPH and is not converted to all-trans-retinol to any significant degree (Fig. 2, C and D). The Fex-340/Fex-380 ratio was chosen because it increases with the proportion of released retinal converted to retinol and with the fraction of NADP present in the reduced form of NADPH. Assuming that the reduction reaction in Equation 1 is close to equilibrium, a relationship between the Fex-340/Fex-380 ratio and the fraction of NADPH can be obtained. retinal+NADPH+H+↔retinol+NADP+(Eq. 1) If ROL and RAL stand for all-trans-retinol and all-trans-retinal, respectively, and Keq the equilibrium constant, then Keq=([RAL]×[NADPH]×[H+])/([ROL]×[NADP+])(Eq. 2) If r = [ROL]/([RAL] + [ROL]) is the fraction of retinol, and the fraction of reduced NADP is Nred = [NADPH]/(NADPH] + [NADP+]) by rearranging Equation 2, we obtain Nred=r/([H+]/Keq+1(1-[H+]/Keq)×r)(Eq. 3) The relationship between the fraction r of retinol and the ratio Fex-380/Fex-340 (the inverse of the ratio used here) has been derived before (Equation 4b in Ref. 11Chen C.

Intracellular rod outer segment pH was measured with the fluorescent dye BCECF (13Chen C. Jiang Y. Koutalos Y. Dynamic behavior of rod photoreceptor disks.Biophys.

The relation between Nred, the fraction of total NADP that is in the reduced form, and the ratio FR = Fex-340/Fex-380 is plotted in Fig. 4 for the two values of QYR and for rod outer segment, pH 7.0. In the rest of the paper and for simplicity of presentation, the value QYR = 5.1 is used to calculate the NADPH fractions corresponding to different values of the Fex-340/Fex-380 fluorescence ratio. The values of the NADPH fraction obtained using QYR = 15.7 are lower (Fig. 4).FIGURE 4.Dependence of the fraction Nred = [NADPH]/([NADPH] + [NADP+]) on the fluorescence ratio Fex-340/Fex-380. The dependence has been calculated from Equation 6 for the two different values, 5.1 and 15.7, of the ratio QYR of the quantum yield of retinol over that of retinal. Fex-340 and Fex-380 are the fluorescence intensities excited by 340- and 380-nm light, respectively (emission, >420 nm).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the presence of 5 mm glucose, a large proportion of the released retinal is converted to retinol, as indicated by the much higher intensity of the fluorescence excited by 340 nm compared with that excited by 380 nm (Fig. 5). When glucose is used as a metabolic substrate, potential NADPH sources are the glucose-6-phosphate and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenases of the pentose phosphate pathway and cytosolic NADP+-dependent dehydrogenases that utilize as substrates metabolites provided by the mitochondria (Fig. 1). In the absence of metabolic substrate, the similar intensities of the fluorescence excited by 340 and 380 nm indicate that a large proportion of retinal has not been converted to retinol (Fig. 5), reflecting a requirement of extracellular metabolic substrate availability for the generation of the requisite NADPH. Glutamine, supplied at a concentration of 0.2 mm, supports the conversion of retinal to retinol to an extent similar to that of 5 mm glucose (Fig. 5), indicating that NADPH can be provided solely by mitochondria-linked pathways. The ratio of Fex-340/Fex-380 was measured at different times after bleaching in the presence of different concentrations of various metabolic substrates. Fig. 6A shows that rods using either 5 mm glucose (●, n = 8) or 0.2 mm glutamine (▵, n = 7) as metabolic substrate maintain the fluorescence ratio to similar levels, in the order of 4.5–5.5. These levels correspond to retinol fractions of 0.8–0.9 (Equation 5); that is, most of the released retinal is converted to retinol. These values of the fluorescence ratio (and retinol fraction) further correspond to an NADPH fraction of 0.1–0.2 (Equation 6). Metabolically intact rods bleached in the absence of any extracellular metabolic substrate achieved a fluorescence ratio of 1.1–1.3, corresponding to an NADPH fraction of ∼0.01 (Fig. 6A; ○, n = 9). At 60 min after bleaching, the ratio in the absence of metabolic substrate had a value of 1.25 ± 0.02, significantly lower than the ratios in the presence of 5 mm glucose (p < 0.001) or 0.2 mm glutamine (p < 0.001). It was, however, significantly higher (p < 0.001) than the one for broken off rod outer segments (0.72 ± 0.01 at 60 min after bleaching, n = 6; Fig. 2D), indicating some ongoing metabolic activity even in the absence of any extracellular metabolic substrate. We have used the value of the Fex-340/Fex-380 fluorescence ratio at 60 min after bleaching as a measure of NADPH availability. By that time, almost all of the retinal has been released from photoactivated rhodopsin (16Blakeley L.R. Chen C. Chen C.K. Chen J. Crouch R.K. Travis G.H. Koutalos Y. Rod outer segment retinol formation is independent of Abca4, arrestin, rhodopsin kinase, and rhodopsin palmitylation.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2011; 52: 3483-3491Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Because there is a large amount of retinal released from photoactivated rhodopsin after bleaching and a large fraction of it is present as retinol at any given time (Fig. 6A), the maintenance of a stable value of the NADPH fraction over time reflects continued regeneration of NADPH by the metabolic machinery of the cell. Thus, NADPH availability depends on the NADPH-generating capacity of the cell. The availability of NADPH, as measured by the Fex-340/Fex-380 ratio, depended on the extracellular concentration of metabolic substrate. Glucose and glutamine were approximately equally effective at supporting metabolic activity, with NADPH availability being severely compromised at extracellular concentrations below ∼0.1 mm (Fig. 6B). Pyruvate and lactate, which would both be utilized only through mitochondrial pathways, could also support some NADPH generation, but only at higher concentrations (Fig. 6C). Citrate and malate were much less effective at supporting NADPH generation: 2.5 mm citrate did not support significant NADPH generation, as judged by a fluorescence ratio of 0.88 ± 0.03 at 60 min after bleaching (n = 5), whereas 2.5 mm malate provided only modest support, as indicated by a fluorescence ratio of 1.43 ± 0.08 at 60 min after bleaching (n = 5) (data not shown). For experiments using glutamine, pyruvate or lactate as metabolic substrates, the solutions contained 5 mm 2-deoxyglucose, to inhibit any NADPH generation through the pentose phosphate pathway from any remaining intracel"
https://openalex.org/W1963777550,"In pancreatic islets, insulin secretion occurs via synchronous elevation of Ca(2+) levels throughout the islets during high glucose conditions. This Ca(2+) elevation has two phases: a quick increase, observed after the glucose stimulus, followed by prolonged oscillations. In these processes, the elevation of intracellular ATP levels generated from glucose is assumed to inhibit ATP-sensitive K(+) channels, leading to the depolarization of membranes, which in turn induces Ca(2+) elevation in the islets. However, little is known about the dynamics of intracellular ATP levels and their correlation with Ca(2+) levels in the islets in response to changing glucose levels. In this study, a genetically encoded fluorescent biosensor for ATP and a fluorescent Ca(2+) dye were employed to simultaneously monitor the dynamics of intracellular ATP and Ca(2+) levels, respectively, inside single isolated islets. We observed rapid increases in cytosolic and mitochondrial ATP levels after stimulation with glucose, as well as with methyl pyruvate or leucine/glutamine. High ATP levels were sustained as long as high glucose levels persisted. Inhibition of ATP production suppressed the initial Ca(2+) increase, suggesting that enhanced energy metabolism triggers the initial phase of Ca(2+) influx. On the other hand, cytosolic ATP levels did not fluctuate significantly with the Ca(2+) level in the subsequent oscillation phases. Importantly, Ca(2+) oscillations stopped immediately before ATP levels decreased significantly. These results might explain how food or glucose intake evokes insulin secretion and how the resulting decrease in plasma glucose levels leads to cessation of secretion."

Given their role in helping to maintain cellular homeostasis, it is imperative to understand the expression, regulation, and function of CNC-bZIP genes during embryonic development. We explored the expression and function of six nrf genes (nfe2, nrf1a, nrf1b, nrf2a, nrf2b, and nrf3) using zebrafish embryos as a model system. Analysis by microarray and quantitative RT-PCR showed that genes in the nrf family were expressed throughout development from oocytes to larvae. The spatial expression of nrf3 suggested a role in regulating the development of the brain, brachia and pectoral fins. Knock-down by morpholino anti-sense oligonucleotides suggested that none of the genes were necessary for embryonic viability, but nfe2 was required for proper cellular organization in the pneumatic duct and subsequent swim bladder function, as well as for proper formation of the otic vesicles. nrf genes were induced by the oxidant tert-butylhydroperoxide, and some of this response was regulated through family members Nrf2a and Nrf2b. Our results provide a foundation for understanding the role of nrf genes in normal development and in regulating the response to oxidative stress in vertebrate embryos."
https://openalex.org/W2093055973,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome transcription is highly dependent on liver-enriched, metabolic nuclear receptors (NRs). Among others, NR farnesoid X receptor a (FXRa) enhances HBV core promoter activity and pregenomic RNA synthesis. Interestingly, two food-withdrawal-induced FXRα modulators, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) and deacetylase SIRT1, have been found to be associated with HBV genomes ex vivo. Whereas PGC-1α induction was shown to increase HBV replication, the effect of SIRT1 on HBV transcription remains unknown. Here, we showed that, in hepatocar-cinoma-derived Huh-7 cells, combined activation of FXRα by GW4064 and SIRT1 by activator 3 increased HBV core promoter-controlled luciferase expression by 25-fold, compared with a 10-fold increase with GW4064 alone. Using cell lines differentially expressing FXRα in overexpression and silencing experiments, we demonstrated that SIRT1 activated the core promoter in an FXRα- and PGC-1 α-dependent manner. Maximal activation (> 150-fold) was observed in FXRα-and PGC-1α-overexpressing Huh-7 cells treated with FXRα and SIRT1 activators. Similarly, in cells transfected with full-length HBV genomes, maximal induction (3.5-fold) of core promoter-controlled synthesis of 3.5-kb RNA was observed in the same conditions of transfection and treatments. Thus, we identified a subnetwork of metabolic factors regulating HBV replication, strengthening the hypothesis that transcription of HBV and metabolic genes is similarly controlled.—Curtil, C., Enache, L.

https://openalex.org/W2010220929,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are tools for controlling computers and other devices without using muscular activity, employing user-controlled variations in signals recorded from the user’s brain. One of the most efficient noninvasive BCIs is based on the P300 wave of the brain’s response to stimuli and is therefore referred to as the P300 BCI. Many modifications of this BCI have been proposed to further improve the BCI’s characteristics or to better adapt the BCI to various applications. However, in the original P300 BCI and in all of its modifications, the spatial positions of stimuli were fixed relative to each other, which can impose constraints on designing applications controlled by this BCI. We designed and tested a P300 BCI with stimuli presented on objects that were freely moving on a screen at a speed of 5.4°/s. Healthy participants practiced a game-like task with this BCI in either single-trial or triple-trial mode within four sessions. At each step, the participants were required to select one of nine moving objects. The mean online accuracy of BCI-based selection was 81% in the triple-trial mode and 65% in the single-trial mode. A relatively high P300 amplitude was observed in response to targets in most participants. Self-rated interest in the task was high and stable over the four sessions (the medians in the 1st/4th sessions were 79/84% and 76/71% in the groups practicing in the single-trial and triple-trial modes, respectively). We conclude that the movement of stimulus positions relative to each other may not prevent the efficient use of the P300 BCI by people controlling their gaze, e.g., in robotic devices and in video games."

https://openalex.org/W2023984973,"Perturbation of calcium signaling that occurs during cell injury and disease, promotes cell death. In mouse lung fibroblasts A23187 triggered mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) formation, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, and necrotic cell death that were blocked by cyclosporin A (CsA) and EGTA. LDH release temporally correlated with arachidonic acid release but did not involve cytosolic phospholipase A2α (cPLA2α) or calcium-independent PLA2. Surprisingly, release of arachidonic acid and LDH from cPLA2α-deficient fibroblasts was inhibited by the cPLA2α inhibitor pyrrophenone, and another serine hydrolase inhibitor KT195, by preventing mitochondrial calcium uptake. Inhibitors of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, a mitochondrial Ca(2+) uniporter (MCU) regulator, also prevented MPTP formation and arachidonic acid release induced by A23187 and H2O2. Pyrrophenone blocked MCU-mediated mitochondrial calcium uptake in permeabilized fibroblasts but not in isolated mitochondria. Unlike pyrrophenone, the diacylglycerol analog 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol and CsA blocked cell death and arachidonic acid release not by preventing mitochondrial calcium uptake but by inhibiting MPTP formation. In fibroblasts stimulated with thapsigargin, which induces MPTP formation by a direct effect on mitochondria, LDH and arachidonic acid release were blocked by CsA and 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol but not by pyrrophenone or EGTA. Therefore serine hydrolase inhibitors prevent necrotic cell death by blocking mitochondrial calcium uptake but not the enzyme releasing fatty acids that occurs by a novel pathway during MPTP formation. This work reveals the potential for development of small molecule cell-permeable serine hydrolase inhibitors that block MCU-mediated mitochondrial calcium overload, MPTP formation, and necrotic cell death."

ACE activity is dependent on chloride ions, with the degree of dependence being substrate-specific (11Shapiro R. Holmquist B. Riordan J.F. Anion activation of angiotensin converting enzyme.

ACE is situated mainly on the surface of endothelial tissue, an environment where blood plasma chloride levels rarely fluctuate from the 100 mm average, sufficient for ACE to be considered fully active in angiotensin I hydrolysis (11Shapiro R.

Darnell J. Molecular Cell Biology. 4th Ed. Scientific American Books, New York1999Google Scholar). These varying concentrations would have an impact on ACE catalytic efficiency. Variance in chloride activity is also seen in inhibitor binding. The difference in affinities for the ACE inhibitors trandolaprilat, enalaprilat, and lisinopril between the N- and C-domains is greater at high chloride concentration (300 mm), whereas for captopril, the difference is larger at low chloride concentration (20 mm) (15Wei L. Clauser E. Alhenc-Gelas F. Corvol P. The two homologous domains of human angiotensin I-converting enzyme interact differently with competitive inhibitors.J. Biol.

The variability in chloride-mediated enhancement of inhibitor affinity may have potential applications in design of inhibitors targeting tissue-specific ACE activity. Indeed, a full delineation of the exact structural and mechanistic aspects of ACE chloride dependence for each domain could be important for the development of domain-selective inhibitors. In this study, key single point mutations were generated to investigate the mechanism of chloride activation and substrate specificity. Activity of these mutants was characterized using an isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)-based assay providing in depth information on the enzyme thermodynamic and kinetic parameters under varying chloride concentrations. Furthermore, the high resolution x-ray crystal structures of these mutants were determined, revealing the key molecular interactions involved in chloride binding. Together, these data identified the close relationship between the nature of the substrate and chloride activation through the chloride 2 pocket and the S2 subsite. The role for the chloride 1 pocket remains elusive and could be mainly structural. A key salt bridge specific to C-domain ACE between Glu403 and Lys118 was shown to stabilize the hinge-bending region and reduce chloride affinity by constraining the chloride 2 pocket.

Crystals were obtained with 1 μl of the C-domain mutant sample (5–10 mg/ml in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm PMSF) mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution (100 mm MIB buffer, pH 4.0, 10 μm zinc sulfate, 5% glycerol, and 15% PEG 3350) and suspended above the well as a hanging drop. Diffraction quality crystals of C-domain mutants appeared after ∼3–5 days. The R522K·captopril complex was obtained by co-crystallization with a 1 mm concentration of the ligand. X-ray diffraction data for C-domain mutants were collected on PX station IO2, IO4, and IO4-1 at the Diamond Light Source (Oxon, UK). 25% PEG 3350 was added to the drop as a cryoprotectant to keep the crystal at constant temperature (100 K) under the liquid nitrogen jet during data collection. For each mutant, 100–150 images were collected by using a PILATUS-2M, -6M (Dectris, Switzerland) or a Quantum-315 CCD (Area Detector Systems Corp., Poway, CA) detector.

Chloride titrations were performed using HHL and Z-FHL solutions containing varying amounts of NaCl (0–1 m) prepared using Milli-Q distilled H2O (chloride concentration <0.06 mm). All substrates used were HPLC-purified (>98% purity), so any chloride or chloride salts would elute with the breakthrough peak; hence, the effects on chloride concentrations are negligible. Assays were performed using a protocol adapted from that described previously (28Friedland J. Silverstein E. A sensitive fluorimetric assay for serum angiotensin-converting enzyme.Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 1976; 66: 416-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), with the primary difference being use of a different buffer (50 mm TAPSO (pH 7.5)). Milliunits of ACE activity, with 1 unit defined as 1 nmol of HL produced/min/ml (min−1·ml−1) at 37 °C in assay buffer, were calculated, divided by the total number of μg in the reaction volume, and expressed as specific activity (milliunits·μg−1). Substrate concentrations used were ≥5 times Km, and the total percentage hydrolysis in each reaction was kept below 20% in order to approximate first order rates (kcat/Km). The measure of chloride binding (Kd(app)) was calculated from activation plots of specific activity versus the logarithm of chloride concentration, with the resultant curves analyzed via non-linear regression using a sigmoidal dose-response curve with the formula, Y=(SAmax-SAmin)1+10logEC50-X(Eq. 1) where SAmin is the specific activity in the absence of NaCl, SAmax is the maximum specific activity upon titration with chloride, X is the logarithm of chloride concentration, Y is the response (specific activity), and EC50 is the X value when the response is halfway between SAmax and SAmin. Enzyme samples of high concentration (>10 μm) were dialyzed extensively against 3× 1 liter of reaction buffer, which consisted of 50 mm TAPSO buffer (pH 7.5), 10 μm ZnSO4, and either 0, 20, or 300 mm NaCl. Substrate/inhibitor was prepared by either dissolution directly into dialysate, to the desired concentration (for HHL, Z-FHL, and lisinopril), or by equilibrating against a 1-ml G10 Sephadex desalting column (for angiotensin I). Angiotensin I (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe-His-Leu) was dissolved in dialysate at high concentration then passed through a 1-ml G10 column (equilibrated with dialysate in order to reduce TFA concentrations) under gravity. 200-μl fractions were collected, and absorbance was measured at 275 nm. These were pooled, and the final concentration was determined spectrophotometrically via absorbance at 275 nm, using the empirically calculated extinction coefficient of 1280 m−1·cm−1. Assays were performed using an iTC200 microcalorimeter and according to the guidelines in the iTC200 microcalorimeter user manual provided by MicroCal. Buffer conditions for both enzyme and lisinopril consisted of 50 mm TAPSO buffer (pH 7.5), 10 μm ZnSO4, and either 0, 20, or 300 mm NaCl, prepared using Milli-Q distilled H2O (chloride concentration <0.06 mm). The reaction cell was maintained at 20 °C, with the lisinopril concentration in the syringe (800–1400 μm) at 10 times the enzyme concentration in the cell (8–12 μm) to account for lisinopril dilution (∼6-fold) and ensure a complete 1:1 binding curve. Binding assays were performed with every preparation of enzyme used in the kinetic assays; this served as an active site titration to determine active enzyme concentration in order to improve the accuracy of the kcat (equal to Vmax/[E]) values obtained in those experiments. The Kd(app), ΔG, ΔH, and ΔS values for lisinopril binding were calculated using Origin 7 with the iTC200 MicroCal Software Addon. All ITC experiments were performed using an iTC200 microcalorimeter (MicroCal LLC), with raw data either extracted for custom calculations using Microsoft Excel or analyzed using Origin 7 software with a proprietary MicroCal analysis module. Assays were performed at 37 °C using an adapted version of the progress curve method described by Stockbridge and Wolfenden (29Stockbridge R.B. Wolfenden R. The intrinsic reactivity of ATP and the catalytic proficiencies of kinases acting on glucose, N-acetylgalactosamine, and homoserine. A thermodynamic analysis.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 22747-22757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), where the variation comprised the use of substrate concentrations of 3–5 times Km. The assay setup for the titration calorimeter involves a single injection of substrate into enzyme or enzyme into substrate and the continuous monitoring of thermal power as substrate is catalyzed to completion. A means of converting this thermal power into a reaction curve of product formed over time has been described previously (29Stockbridge R.B. Wolfenden R. The intrinsic reactivity of ATP and the catalytic proficiencies of kinases acting on glucose, N-acetylgalactosamine, and homoserine. A thermodynamic analysis.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 22747-22757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Given that heat released or absorbed by the enzyme reaction is directly proportional to the amount of substrate hydrolyzed, the amount of product formed over time can be calculated, and a progress curve can be generated. Integration of the total area under the curve represents the total heat turned over in catalyzing all of the substrate. Integrating the area between substrate injection (t = 0) and each time point (t) and then dividing by the total integrated area gives a percentage of the product formed at time t. Multiplying this fraction at each time point by the total substrate concentration at t = 0 (S0) relates it to molar concentration. The formula describing this relationship is as follows, P(t)=[S]0×∫0tdQ(t)dt∫0∞dQ(t)dt(Eq. 2) with the resultant progress curve being a plot of P(t) (product formed) versus t (time). Progress curves were generated and analyzed according to functions described by Golicnik (30Golicnik M. Explicit reformulations of time-dependent solution for a Michaelis-Menten enzyme reaction model.Anal. Biochem. 2010; 406: 94-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The temporal closed form solution of the Michaelis-Menten equation used is given by Equation 3, [S]t=Km×W([S]0Km×exp([S]0-Vm×tKm))(Eq. 3) where W is the Lambert W(x) function (31Corless R.M.

Explicit reformulations of time-dependent solution for a Michaelis-Menten enzyme reaction model.Anal. Biochem. 2010; 406: 94-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) evaluated a number of approximations of W and found one version that produced an acceptably low amount of systemic error when applied to Equation 3 in evaluating progress curves, W(x)≈(1+∈)×ln(6x5×ln((125)×(xln(1+(125)×x))))-∈×ln(2xln(1+2x))(Eq. 4) where ϵ = 0.4586887. Progress curves were generated in Microsoft Excel using Equation 2 and analyzed using the combined Equations 3 and 4, which were written into Graphpad Prism 5 software according to instructions provided by Golicnik (30Golicnik M. Explicit reformulations of time-dependent solution for a Michaelis-Menten enzyme reaction model.Anal. Biochem. 2010; 406: 94-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Assays were performed in triplicate as a minimum, and all kinetic constants (Km, kcat, and kcat/Km) are reported as the mean of the three separate determinations along with the S.E. value.

Here, we performed rational mutagenesis to obtain EcA variants with a potential to improve ALL treatment. Several variants, especially W66Y and Y176F, killed the ALL cells more efficiently than did wild-type EcA (WT-EcA), although nonleukemic peripheral blood monocytes were not affected. Several assays, including Western blotting, annexin-V/propidium iodide binding, comet, and micronuclei assays, showed that the reduction in viability of leukemic cells is due to the increase in caspase-3, cytochrome c release, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activation, down-regulation of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-XL, an arrest of the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase, and eventually apoptosis. Both W66Y and Y176F induced significantly more apoptosis in lymphocytes derived from ALL patients. In addition, Y176F and Y176S exhibited greatly decreased glutaminase activity, whereas K288S/Y176F, a variant mutated in one of the immunodominant epitopes, showed reduced antigenicity. Further in vivo immunogenicity studies in mice showed that K288S/Y176F was 10-fold less immunogenic as compared with WT-EcA. Moreover, sera obtained from WT-EcA immunized mice and ALL patients who were given asparaginase therapy for several weeks recognized the K288S/Y176F mutant significantly less than the WT-EcA. Further mechanistic studies revealed that W66Y, Y176F, and K288S/Y176F rapidly depleted asparagine and also down-regulated the transcription of asparagine synthetase as compared with WT-EcA.

https://openalex.org/W1974845868,"Scaffold proteins localize two or more signaling enzymes in close proximity to their downstream effectors. A-kinase-anchoring proteins (AKAPs) are a canonical family of scaffold proteins known to bind protein kinase A (PKA) and other enzymes. Several AKAPs have been shown to accelerate, amplify, and specify signal transduction to dynamically regulate numerous cellular processes. However, there is little theory available to mechanistically explain how signaling on protein scaffolds differs from solution biochemistry. In our present study, we propose a novel kinetic mechanism for enzymatic reactions on protein scaffolds to explain these phenomena, wherein the enzyme-substrate-scaffold complex undergoes stochastic state switching to reach an active state. This model predicted anchored enzymatic reactions to be accelerated, amplified, and insulated from inhibition compared with those occurring in solution. We exploited a direct interaction between protein kinase C (PKC) and AKAP7α as a model to validate these predictions experimentally. Using a genetically encoded PKC activity reporter, we found that both the strength and speed of substrate phosphorylation were enhanced by AKAP7α. PKC tethered to AKAP7α was less susceptible to inhibition from the ATP-competitive inhibitor Gö6976 and the substrate-competitive inhibitor PKC 20-28, but not the activation-competitive inhibitor calphostin C. Model predictions and experimental validation demonstrated that insulation is a general property of scaffold tethering. Sensitivity analysis indicated that these findings may be applicable to many other scaffolds as well. Collectively, our findings provide theoretical and experimental evidence that scaffold proteins can amplify, accelerate, and insulate signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W2047172241,"Recognition of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) by Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) at the plasma membrane triggers NF-κB activation through recruitment of the adaptor proteins Mal and MyD88. Endocytosis of the activated TLR4 allows recruitment of the adaptors Tram and Trif, leading to activation of the transcription factor IRF3 and interferon production. The small GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6) was shown to regulate the plasma membrane association of Mal. Here we demonstrate that inhibition of Arf6 also markedly reduced LPS-induced cytokine production in Mal(-/-) mouse macrophages. In this article, we focus on a novel role for Arf6 in the MyD88-independent TLR4 pathway. MyD88-independent IRF3 activation and IRF3-dependent gene transcription were strictly dependent on Arf6. Arf6 was involved in transport of Tram to the endocytic recycling compartment and internalization of LPS, possibly explaining its requirement for LPS-induced IRF3 activation. Together, these results show a critical role for Arf6 in regulating Tram/Trif-dependent TLR4 signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2141053042,"Patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in whom tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) fail often present mutations in the BCR-ABL catalytic domain. We noticed a lack of substitutions involving 4 amino acids (E286, M318, I360, and D381) that form hydrogen bonds with ponatinib. We therefore introduced mutations in each of these residues, either preserving or altering their physicochemical properties. We found that E286, M318, I360, and D381 are dispensable for ABL and BCR-ABL protein stability but are critical for preserving catalytic activity. Indeed, only a “conservative” I360T substitution retained kinase proficiency and transforming potential. Molecular dynamics simulations of BCR-ABLI360T revealed differences in both helix αC dynamics and protein-correlated motions, consistent with a modified ATP-binding pocket. Nevertheless, this mutant remained sensitive to ponatinib, imatinib, and dasatinib. These results suggest that changes in the 4 BCR-ABL residues described here would be selected against by a lack of kinase activity or by maintained responsiveness to TKIs. Notably, amino acids equivalent to those identified in BCR-ABL are conserved in 51% of human tyrosine kinases. Hence, these residues may represent an appealing target for the design of pharmacological compounds that would inhibit additional oncogenic tyrosine kinases while avoiding the emergence of resistance due to point mutations.—Buffa, P., Romano, C., Pandini, A., Massimino, M., Tirrò, E., Di Raimondo, F., Manzella, L., Fraternali, F., Vigneri, P.

https://openalex.org/W2071351809,"It is believed that mitochondrial dynamics is coordinated with endosomal traffic rates during cytoskeletal remodeling, but the mechanisms involved are largely unknown. The adenovirus early region 4 ORF4 protein (E4orf4) subverts signaling by Src family kinases (SFK) to perturb cellular morphology, membrane traffic, and organellar dynamics and to trigger cell death. Using E4orf4 as a model, we uncovered a functional connection between mitochondria-shaping proteins and the small GTPase Rab11a, a key regulator of polarized transport via recycling endosomes. We found that E4orf4 induced dramatic changes in the morphology of mitochondria along with their mobilization at the vicinity of a polarized actin network typifying E4orf4 action, in a manner controlled by SFK and Rab11a. Mitochondrial remodeling was associated with increased proximity between Rab11a and mitochondrial membranes, changes in fusion-fission dynamics, and mitochondrial relocalization of the fission factor dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), which was regulated by the Rab11a effector protein FIP1/RCP. Knockdown of FIP1/RCP or inhibition of Drp1 markedly impaired mitochondrial remodeling and actin assembly, involving Rab11a-mediated mitochondrial dynamics in E4orf4-induced signaling. A similar mobilization of mitochondria near actin-rich structures was mediated by Rab11 and Drp1 in viral Src-transformed cells and contributed to the biogenesis of podosome rosettes. These findings suggest a role for Rab11a in the trafficking of Drp1 to mitochondria upon SFK activation and unravel a novel functional interplay between Rab11a and mitochondria during reshaping of the cell cytoskeleton, which would facilitate mitochondria redistribution near energy-requiring actin-rich structures."
https://openalex.org/W2141345086,"Trichomonas vaginalis is a highly divergent, unicellular eukaryote of the phylum Metamonada, class Parabasalia, and the source of a common sexually transmitted infection. This parasite lacks mitochondria, but harbors an evolutionarily related organelle, the hydrogenosome. We explored the role of dynamin-related proteins (DRPs) in the division of the hydrogenosome. Eight DRP homologues [T. vaginalis DRPs (TvDRPs)], which can be grouped into 3 subclasses, are present in T. vaginalis. We examined 5 TvDRPs that are representative of each subclass, by introducing dominant negative mutations analogous to those known to interfere with mitochondrial division in yeast, worms, and mammals. Microscopic and cell fractionation analyses of parasites expressing one of the mutated TvDRPs (TVAG_350040) demonstrated that this protein localizes to hydrogenosomes. Moreover, these organelles were found to be increased in size and reduced in number in cells expressing this dominant negative protein, relative to parasites expressing the corresponding wild-type TvDRP, the other 4 mutant TvDRPs, or an empty vector control. Our data indicate a role for a TvDRP in the fission of T. vaginalis hydrogenosomes, similar to that described for peroxisomes and mitochondria. These findings reveal a conservation of core components involved in the division of diverse eukaryotic organelles across broad phylogenetic distances."

Stathmin (STMN), a cytoplasmic microtubule-destabilizing phosphoprotein, regulates interphase microtubules during cell stress, but the signaling mechanisms involved are poorly defined. In this study ectopic expression of single alanine-substituted phospho-resistant mutants demonstrated that STMN Ser-38 and Ser-63 phosphorylation were specifically required to maintain interphase microtubules during hyperosmotic stress. STMN was phosphorylated on Ser-38 and Ser-63 in response to hyperosmolarity, heat shock, and arsenite treatment but rapidly dephosphorylated after oxidative stress treatment. Two-dimensional PAGE and Phos-tag gel analysis of stress-stimulated STMN phospho-isoforms revealed rapid STMN Ser-38 phosphorylation followed by subsequent Ser-25 and Ser-63 phosphorylation. Previously, we delineated stress-stimulated JNK targeting of STMN. Here, we identified cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) signaling as responsible for stress-induced STMN Ser-63 phosphorylation. Increased cAMP levels induced by cholera toxin triggered potent STMN Ser-63 phosphorylation. Osmotic stress stimulated an increase in PKA activity and elevated STMN Ser-63 and CREB (cAMP-response element-binding protein) Ser-133 phosphorylation that was substantially attenuated by pretreatment with H-89, a PKA inhibitor. Interestingly, PKA activity and subsequent phosphorylation of STMN were augmented in the absence of JNK activation, indicating JNK and PKA pathway cross-talk during stress regulation of STMN.

Taken together our study indicates that JNK- and PKA-mediated STMN Ser-38 and Ser-63 phosphorylation are required to preserve interphase microtubules in response to hyperosmotic stress. Stathmin (STMN) 2The abbreviations used are:STMNstathminOSosmotic stressPKAprotein kinase A/cAMP-dependent protein kinaseSPSTMN phospho-isomerCSTCell Signaling TechnologyCREBcAMP-response element-binding protein. is the archetypal member of the STMN-like protein family of tubulin-associating proteins that also includes SCG10, SCLIP, RB3′, and RB3″ (1Cassimeris L.

These proteins, via their formation of a ternary complex with two α/β-tubulin heterodimers (T2S), sequester tubulin and so promote microtubule destabilization (2Belmont L.D. Mitchison T.J.

At the cellular level, this enhanced microtubule destabilization is critical for the control of microtubule organization and dynamics and contributes to processes required for cell division, migration, differentiation, and proliferation (1Cassimeris L.

STMN is phosphorylated on four conserved serine residues (Ser-16, Ser-25, Ser-38, and Ser-63), and mutagenesis studies coupled with in vitro tubulin polymerization assays have revealed the contribution of site-specific serine phosphorylation to enhance microtubule stabilization by preventing the formation of the STMN-tubulin T2S complex (11Honnappa S.

For example, STMN Ser-16 or Ser-63 phosphorylation was sufficient to reduce STMN inhibition of microtubule assembly, whereas the effects of STMN Ser-25 and Ser-38 phosphorylation were more marginal. Importantly, the phosphorylation of all four serine residues was required to inhibit STMN activity completely in vitro (11Honnappa S. Jahnke W. Seelig J. Steinmetz M.O.

In contrast, the kinases that target STMN Ser-63 are less well characterized, although active PKA in vitro or the ectopic overexpression of PKA in cells can promote STMN Ser-63 phosphorylation (17Gradin H.M. Larsson N. Marklund U. Gullberg M. Regulation of microtubule dynamics by extracellular signals. cAMP-dependent protein kinase switches off the activity of oncoprotein 18 in intact cells.J.

The biological context and consequence of PKA signaling to STMN are unclear and are also further complicated by interdependent relationships of the STMN phosphorylation sites. For example, STMN Ser-16 and Ser-63 targeting by mitotic kinases requires prior Ser-25 and Ser-38 phosphorylation (28Larsson N. Marklund U. Gradin H.M. Brattsand G. Gullberg M. Control of microtubule dynamics by oncoprotein 18. Dissection of the regulatory role of multisite phosphorylation during mitosis.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5530-5539Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Similarly, our recent studies highlighted that the efficient phosphorylation of STMN Ser-25 in response to OS required prior phosphorylation of STMN Ser-38 (14Ng D.C. Zhao T.T. Yeap Y.Y. Ngoei K.R. Bogoyevitch M.A. c-Jun N-terminal kinase phosphorylation of stathmin confers protection against cellular stress.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 29001-29013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Therefore, although we have previously characterized JNK-dependent STMN Ser-25 and Ser-38 phosphorylation in response to cell stress, the signaling pathway(s) that regulates STMN Ser-63 and its contributions to microtubule regulation during cell stress remains enigmatic. In this study we investigated the relative importance of STMN-specific serine phosphorylation toward its activity. Our combined use of mobility shift detection and site-specific phospho-STMN antibodies allowed our characterization of STMN phosphorylation in response to cell stress, revealing the complexities of the STMN phospho-isomers stimulated under these conditions. We have also defined a role for PKA in the phosphorylation and regulation of STMN function during hyperosmotic stress and uncovered signaling cross-talk between JNK and PKA regulation of STMN. Our studies highlight the complex interplay of phosphorylation to regulate STMN activity in the maintenance of interphase microtubules in the context of cellular stress. All antibodies were obtained from commercial sources: phospho-STMN Ser-16, Ser-25, Ser-38, and Ser-63 antibodies (Abcam), α-tubulin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), STMN antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology (CST) #3352 or Sigma #O0138), and phospho-c-Jun S73 antibody (CST). Protein kinase inhibitors JNK inhibitor VIII, aurora kinase inhibitor III, staurosporine (broad spectrum serine/threonine inhibitor), bisindolylmaleimide I (protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor), and H-89 (PKA inhibitor) were purchased from Calbiochem and dissolved in DMSO. Phos-tagTM was purchased from Wako Chemicals. Cell culture serum, medium, and supplements were obtained from Invitrogen. Nerve growth factor (NGF), sorbitol, and all routine laboratory chemicals were from Sigma. PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) horse serum, 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS), and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin and cultured in a humidified 5% CO2 environment. COS-1 monkey kidney fibroblasts were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. PC12 cells were plated onto 60-mm collagen I-coated dishes (Iwaki), whereas COS-1 cells were plated on uncoated dishes. Liposomal-mediated transfection was performed with LipofectamineTM 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were serum-starved overnight and pretreated with kinase inhibitors (30 min) before cell treatments/stress stimulation. COS-1 cell treatments were performed on uncoated glass coverslips. STMN phosphorylation site mutant constructs (STMN-S16A, STMN-S25A, STMN-S38A, STMN-S63A, and STMN-AAAA) were made by site-directed mutagenesis as previously described (14Ng D.C. Zhao T.T. Yeap Y.Y. Ngoei K.R. Bogoyevitch M.A. c-Jun N-terminal kinase phosphorylation of stathmin confers protection against cellular stress.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 29001-29013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Mutant constructs were then cloned into pXJ40-myc and subjected to restriction digestion and sequencing analysis before further use. Cells were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before fixation with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (20 min, room temperature). Sample preparation and confocal microscopy were as previously described (29Ng D.C. Ng I.H. Yeap Y.Y. Badrian B. Tsoutsman T. McMullen J.R. Semsarian C. Bogoyevitch M.A. Opposing actions of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in regulating microtubule stabilization during cardiac hypertrophy.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 1576-1587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Cells were permeabilized (0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS) and pre-blocked (10% (v/v) FCS in PBS) before incubation with primary antibodies and Cy2/Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted in 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS. The cells were then mounted (GelMount, Biomeda Corp.), and images were captured on a Leica TCS SP2 confocal microscope using a 100 × 1.35 NA objective. PC12 cells were washed with ice-cold PBS before lysis in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.3), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.2% (w/v) NaF, and 100 μm Na3VO4) supplemented with Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Cell lysates were incubated (10 min, on ice) before removal of cell debris by centrifugation (14,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C). Protein concentrations were then determined by Bradford assay. Protein lysates in Laemmli buffer were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes, blocked (5% (w/v) nonfat milk powder in Tris-buffered saline with 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20), and immunoblotted with the appropriate primary and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Millipore). Proteins were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce), and bands were quantified by densitometric analysis (Bio-Rad ChemidocTM MP Imager). Phos-tagTM gels were prepared as per SDS-PAGE gels with the addition of 50 μm Phos-tagTM reagent and 5 μm MnCl2. After electrophoresis, Phos-tagTM gels were soaked in transfer buffer containing 1 mm EDTA (10 min with gentle agitation) followed by another 10 min in buffer without EDTA to remove manganese ions from the gel before transfer to PVDF membranes. Cell lysates were prepared in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer lacking EDTA, NaF, and Na3VO4. Lysates (100 μg of total protein as estimated by Bradford assay) were treated with 400 units of λ-phosphatase (New England Biolabs) for 25 min at 30 °C. Laemmli buffer was then added, and proteins were resolved for immunoblotting as described above. Protein lysates from PC12 cells were prepared in lysis buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 8 m urea, 4% (w/v) CHAPS) and clarified by centrifugation (14,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C), and protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay. First-dimension isoelectric focusing was performed using 11-cm linear immobilized pH 4–7 gradient drystrips, 1% pH 4–7 carrier ampholytes, and 20 mm DTT on an EttanTM IPGphorTM (Amersham Biosciences). Run conditions were as specified by the manufacturer. Second-dimension separation was performed on 8–16% gradient Tris-HCl polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad). After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred onto PVDF membranes and immunoblotted with total STMN antibody. PKA activity in cell lysates was assayed using a PKA assay kit (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's description. Briefly, cell lysates (20 μg) were incubated with 80 μm Kemptide, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in kinase reaction buffer (20 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol) with or without PKA peptide inhibitor for 10 min at 30 °C. Samples were spotted onto P81 phosphocellulose paper, and phosphorylated peptide was separated from [γ-32P]ATP by washing in 0.75% phosphoric acid. Radioactivity was quantified using liquid scintillation counting. Residual activity in the presence of PKA peptide inhibitor was subtracted to calculate PKA activity. cAMP was measured in whole-cell lysates using a competition enzyme-linked immunoassay (cAMP XPTM Assay kit, CST) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Absorbance measurements from OS-treated cell lysates were expressed as a percentage of forskolin (20 μm, 20 min) treatment using the equation (Astress − Abasal(0 min))/(Aforskolin − Abasal(0 min)). Fractionation and immunoblot analysis of soluble and polymerized tubulin from stress-stimulated cell lysates were performed as described previously (30Ng D.C. Lin B.H. Lim C.P. Huang G. Zhang T. Poli V. Cao X. Stat3 regulates microtubules by antagonizing the depolymerization activity of stathmin.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Cells were lysed in a microtubule stabilization buffer (100 mm PIPES (pH 6.9), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 30% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P40, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 100 μm GTP, 1 mm ATP, and 2 μm taxol) supplemented with protease inhibitors. Lysates were precleared (1000 × g, 5 min) before polymerized tubulin pelleted by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 30 min, 37 °C). Soluble fractions were removed, and pellets were washed and depolymerized with 2 mm CaCl2 (4 °C). Soluble and polymerized tubulin were resolved on SDS-PAGE, detected, and quantified by immunoblotting. Tubulin polymer levels in pellet fractions were expressed as a % of total tubulin ((tubulinPellet)/(tubulinSoluble + tubulinPellet)). Purified recombinant STMN (GST fusion or Precision Protease cleaved to remove GST tag) was incubated with active kinase (JNK1 and/or PKA) in a kinase reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 20 mm MgCl2·6H2O, 20 μm ATP, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, and supplemented with 25 μm Na3VO4 and 100 μm DTT) for 120 min at 30 °C. STMN serine phosphorylation was determined by immunoblot analysis with phospho antibodies. In vitro tubulin polymerization in the presence or absence of STMN was performed as described previously (30Ng D.C. Lin B.H. Lim C.P. Huang G. Zhang T. Poli V. Cao X. Stat3 regulates microtubules by antagonizing the depolymerization activity of stathmin.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified porcine tubulin (300 μg, Cytoskeleton Inc.) was incubated with STMN to a final volume of 100 μl in tubulin assembly buffer (80 mm PIPES (pH 6.8), 0.5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm GTP, and 10% (v/v) glycerol) on clear 96-well plates. Tubulin polymerization was initiated with incubation at 37 °C, and absorbance (340 nm) was measured every minute on a temperature-controlled plate reader (POLARstar Optima, BMG Labtech). All values are presented as the mean ± S.E. Values were compared using two-way analysis of variance or unpaired Student's t tests as appropriate. p values <0.05 were considered significant. STMN phosphorylation has been linked to global microtubule destabilization (31Horwitz S.B. Shen H.J. He L. Dittmar P. Neef R. Chen J. Schubart U.K. The microtubule-destabilizing activity of metablastin (p19) is controlled by phosphorylation.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8129-8132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We thus examined the impact of a STMN-AAAA mutant in which all four regulatory serine phosphorylation sites (Ser-16, Ser-25, Ser-38, and Ser-63) had been alanine-substituted. The effects of STMN-WT (wild type) and STMN-AAAA highlighted the importance of phosphorylation as a key negative regulatory modification of STMN activity in maintaining the organization of the cellular microtubule array (Fig. 1A). To assess the contributions of each serine, both under control and stress conditions, we expressed single-alanine-substituted STMN mutants. In contrast to STMN-AAAA, the expression of single-alanine-substituted STMN mutants (S16A, S25A, S38A, or S63A) did not substantially perturb the microtubule array under basal conditions as indicated by the density and radial arrangement of microtubules that did not differ markedly from cells expressing wild-type STMN or adjacent non-transfected cells (Fig. 1A). We then interrogated how these phosphorylation sites may contribute to the response to hyperosmolar stress conditions (OS) initiated by the addition of 0.5 m sorbitol to the culture media. We found that cells expressing STMN-WT maintained their microtubule arrays, as did cells expressing STMN S16A or STMN S25A (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the microtubules in cells expressing STMN S38A or S63A were completely destabilized and resembled cells expressing the STMN-AAAA mutant (Fig. 1B, arrows). Our quantitation indicated that the proportion of cells expressing STMN S38A or S63A with perturbed microtubule arrays increased after osmotic stress (Fig. 1C). In contrast, sorbitol treatment did not substantially alter the proportion of STMN-WT-, STMN S16A-, or STMN S25A-expressing cells with destabilized microtubule arrays. Similarly, biochemical interrogation of tubulin polymer levels indicated reduced polymerized tubulin in pelleted fractions prepared from sorbitol-stimulated cells expressing STMN S38A or S63A specifically (Fig. 1E). In comparison to STMN WT, tubulin polymer levels were marginally reduced in cells expressing STMN S16A or S25A, but this did not change with sorbitol treatment (Fig. 1E). Cells expressing phospho-deficient STMN-AAAA mutants were essentially devoid of polymerized tubulin regardless of cell treatment. Fluorescence intensity (Fig. 1, A and B) or immunoblot detection (Fig. 1, D and E) using an anti-myc tag antibody to detect the exogenous STMN expression, indicated comparable levels of STMN constructs in both microscopic and immunoblot experiments. The importance of STMN Ser-38 and Ser-63 in maintaining the cytoplasmic microtubule array during OS thus prompted our further investigation of their phosphorylation during stress. Evaluation of the phosphorylation of STMN has been facilitated by the availability of phospho-specific antibodies (14Ng D.C. Zhao T.T. Yeap Y.Y. Ngoei K.R.

https://openalex.org/W2032202789,"The identification of lysine acetylation of steroid hormone receptors has previously been based on the presence of consensus motif (K/R)XKK. This study reports the discovery by mass spectrometry of a novel progesterone receptor acetylation site at Lys-183 that is not in the consensus motif. In vivo acetylation and mutagenesis experiments revealed that Lys-183 is a primary site of progesterone receptor (PR) acetylation. Lys-183 acetylation is enhanced by p300 overexpression and abrogated by p300 gene silencing, suggesting that p300 is the major acetyltransferase for Lys-183 acetylation. Furthermore, p300-mediated Lys-183 acetylation is associated with heightened PR activity. Accordingly, the acetylation-mimicking mutant PRB-K183Q exhibited accelerated DNA binding kinetics and greater activity compared with the wild-type PRB on genes containing progesterone response element. In contrast, Lys-183 acetylation had no influence on PR tethering effect on the nuclear factor κ-light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NFκB). Additionally, increases of Lys-183 acetylation by p300 overexpression or inhibition of deacetylation resulted in increases of Ser-294 phosphorylation levels. In conclusion, PR acetylation at Lys-183 by p300 potentiates PR activity through accelerated binding of its direct target genes without affecting PR tethering on other transcription factors. The effect may be mediated by enhancing Ser-294 phosphorylation. The identification of lysine acetylation of steroid hormone receptors has previously been based on the presence of consensus motif (K/R)XKK. This study reports the discovery by mass spectrometry of a novel progesterone receptor acetylation site at Lys-183 that is not in the consensus motif. In vivo acetylation and mutagenesis experiments revealed that Lys-183 is a primary site of progesterone receptor (PR) acetylation. Lys-183 acetylation is enhanced by p300 overexpression and abrogated by p300 gene silencing, suggesting that p300 is the major acetyltransferase for Lys-183 acetylation. Furthermore, p300-mediated Lys-183 acetylation is associated with heightened PR activity. Accordingly, the acetylation-mimicking mutant PRB-K183Q exhibited accelerated DNA binding kinetics and greater activity compared with the wild-type PRB on genes containing progesterone response element.

Additionally, increases of Lys-183 acetylation by p300 overexpression or inhibition of deacetylation resulted in increases of Ser-294 phosphorylation levels. In conclusion, PR acetylation at Lys-183 by p300 potentiates PR activity through accelerated binding of its direct target genes without affecting PR tethering on other transcription factors. The effect may be mediated by enhancing Ser-294 phosphorylation. The ovarian steroid hormone progesterone is essential for normal mammary and uterine development. It is also imperative for embryo implantation and maintenance of pregnancy.

There are two major subtypes of human PR, PR-A and PR-B, that are translated from transcripts generated from two distinct promoters in the gene (1Kastner P. Krust A. Turcotte B. Stropp U. Tora L. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. Two distinct estrogen-regulated promoters generate transcripts encoding the two functionally different human progesterone receptor forms A and B.EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1603-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar). PRA lacks the 165 amino acids found in the N terminus of PRB. PR isoforms are differentially expressed in a cell- or tissue-specific manner (2Jacobsen B.M. Richer J.K. Schittone S.A. Horwitz K.B.

Gynecol. 2005; 193: 1156-1160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). PR belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily that is characterized by a modular domain structure. The structure of PR begins with a poorly conserved N-terminal transactivation domain (NTD) that includes the activation function-1 (AF-1) originally defined to a core region of amino acids 456–546 (5Meyer M.E. Quirin-Stricker C. Lerouge T. Bocquel M.T. Gronemeyer H. A limiting factor mediates the differential activation of promoters by the human progesterone-receptor isoforms.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10882-10887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is followed by the DNA binding domain responsible for receptor dimerization and DNA binding. The C-terminal ligand binding domain contains AF-2. AF-1 synergizes with AF-2 to bring about optimal receptor activity (6Danielian P.S. White R. Lees J.A. Parker M.G. Identification of a conserved region required for hormone dependent transcriptional activation by steriod-hormone receptors.EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1025-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). In addition, an AF-3 is contained within the first 164 amino acids unique to PRB and synergizes with both AF-1 and AF-2 to maximize PRB activity. There is also a flexible hinge region, connecting the DNA binding domain and ligand binding domain (7Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Molecular mechanisms of action of steriod/thyroid receptor superfamily members.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2692) Google Scholar). Hinge region contains the nuclear localization signal. It has been reported that PR hinge region also plays a role in regulating PR transactivation through its acetylation (8Daniel A.R. Gaviglio A.L. Czaplicki L.M. Hillard C.J. Housa D. Lange C.A.

The PR function is regulated by a host of transcription coregulators. Agonist binding results in a conformational change in the ligand binding domain that allows the receptor to interact directly or indirectly with a diverse set of co-regulatory proteins (7Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Molecular mechanisms of action of steriod/thyroid receptor superfamily members.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2692) Google Scholar). These include steroid receptor coactivator (SRC) family members (i.e. SRC-1, SRC-2, and SRC-3), which act primarily as anchoring surfaces to bridge the binding of other coregulators, such as protein-modifying enzymes acetyltransferases and methyltransferases (9Oñate S.A.

A tale of histone modifications.Genome Biol. 2001; 2 (REVIEWS0003)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, acetylation could facilitate recruitment of transcription factors to specific target DNA sequences by loosening nucleosomal structure and facilitate transcription factor binding to gene promoters. In addition, p300 and CBP can also directly acetylate nuclear receptors to regulate their transcriptional activity (20Hanstein B. Eckner R. DiRenzo J. Halachmi S. Liu H. Searcy B. Kurokawa R.

Although it has been reported that p300 is associated with PR during progesterone-induced transcriptional initiation (13Liu Z. Wong J. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Sequential recruitment of steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) and p300 enhances progesterone receptor-dependent initiation and reinitiation of transcription from chromatin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 12426-12431Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), it is not known whether p300 directly acetylates PR to regulate its activity. Nonetheless, it has been reported that PR is acetylated at the consensus sequence, KXKK (amino acids 638–641) of the hinge region (8Daniel A.R. Gaviglio A.L. Czaplicki L.M. Hillard C.J. Housa D. Lange C.A. The progesterone receptor hinge region regulates the kinetics of transcriptional responses through acetylation, phosphorylation, and nuclear retention.Mol. Endocrinol. 2010; 24: 2126-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This PR acetylation was hormone-inducible and was able to regulate the kinetics of transcription of fast response genes and transcription magnitude of slow response genes (8Daniel A.R. Gaviglio A.L. Czaplicki L.M. Hillard C.J. Housa D. Lange C.A. The progesterone receptor hinge region regulates the kinetics of transcriptional responses through acetylation, phosphorylation, and nuclear retention.Mol. Endocrinol. 2010; 24: 2126-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Using LC-MS/MS analysis of immunoprecipitated PR from breast cancer cell lines T47D and ABC28, we have uncovered a novel acetylated site (Lys-183) of high confidence located in the N-terminal domain of PR. Using various biochemical and cell-based assays, we have validated that Lys-183 is the major target of PR acetylation by p300. In addition, we explored the mechanisms and functional consequences of Lys-183 acetylation and demonstrated that Lys-183 acetylation specifically enhances PR transactivation of genes containing PRE. Such regulation is likely to be important in modulating progesterone-dependent signaling in a variety of progesterone target tissues in both normal and pathological states. MDA-MB-231, COS7, and HeLa cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). ABC28 clone was derived by transfecting MDA-MB-231 cells with PR expression vectors hPR1 and hPR2 that contain human PR cDNA coding for PR isoform B and isoform A in pSG5 plasmid (25Lin V.C. Ng E.H. Aw S.E. Tan M.G. Ng E.H. Chan V.S. Ho G.H. Progestins inhibit the growth of MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with progesterone receptor complementary DNA.Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 395-403PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were routinely maintained in phenol red Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 7.5% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Sigma-Aldrich) and 2 mm l-glutamine at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. For experiments involving hormone treatment, cells were cultured in phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 5% charcoal-stripped FBS and 2 mm l-glutamine for 2 days prior to treatment with progesterone, RU486, or R5020 (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were lysed with cold lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm PMSF, 100 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 mm sodium vanadate (pH 7.5)), and proteins in the supernatant were collected after centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 12 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined using the BCATM protein assay kit (Pierce). Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE before transferring onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Anti-PR antibody, H-190 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was used to probe for human PR isoforms, PR-A and PR-B. Phospho-Ser-294 was probed by Ser-294 antibody from Neomarkers. Acetylated proteins were detected by a pan-anti-acetylated lysine antibody (Cell Signaling). The secondary anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies (GE Healthcare) were used in dilutions of 1:1000 and 1:2000, respectively, in reference to the primary antibody used. Anti-β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used to probe for β-actin as loading control. Signal detection was carried out using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (GE Healthcare) or Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's protocol on x-ray films (Eastman Kodak Co.). For MS identification of PR acetylation, ABC28 cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer and incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-PR antibody (H-190, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) precaptured by protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The immune complexes were subsequently washed two times with lysis buffer and two more times with high salt (500 mm NaCl) lysis buffer to remove nonspecific binding. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer. The immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, fixed, and stained by Coomassie Blue G-250 (Sigma-Aldrich). The PR gel bands were excised, chopped into small pieces (∼1 × 1 mm), and transferred to Eppendorf tubes. They were washed with Milli-Q water; destained with 50% acetonitrile (ACN), 50% 25 mm NH4HCO3 via vigorous vortexing for 30 min three times; and dehydrated with 100% ACN until the gel particles became white. They were then reduced with 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) at 56 °C for 1 h and alkylated with 55 mm indoacetamide for 45 min in the dark followed by successive washes with 25 mm NH4HCO3 and 50% ACN, 50% 25 mm NH4HCO3. Finally, they were dehydrated with 100% ACN and dried in vacuum. Trypsin (Trypsin Gold, Mass Spectrometry Grade, Promega, Madison, WI) was added in a weight ratio of 1:30. After the trypsin solution was completely absorbed by gel particles, 25 mm NH4HCO3 was added to completely cover the particles. They were then incubated at 37 °C overnight. Tryptic peptides were extracted from gel particles with 50% ACN containing 0.1% formic acid under sonication for 2 × 20 min. The combined extracts were dried in vacuum. LC-MS/MS was carried out as described previously (26Hao P. Guo T. Li X. Adav S.S. Yang J. Wei M. Sze S.K. Novel application of electrostatic repulsion-hydrophilic interaction chromatography (ERLIC) in shotgun proteomics. Comprehensive profiling of rat kidney proteome.J. Proteome Res. 2010; 9: 3520-3526Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Briefly, peptides were separated and analyzed on a liquid chromatograph (Dionex UltiMate 3000 Nano-LC Systems) at a 300-nl/min flow rate coupled to an LTQ-FT Ultra system (Thermo Electron, Bremen, Germany). Mobile phase A (0.1% formic acid in H2O) and mobile phase B (0.1% formic acid in ACN) were used to establish the 60-min gradient composed of 45 min of 5–35% B, 8 min of 35–50% B, and 2 min of 80% B followed by re-equilibration at 5% B for 5 min. Peptides were then analyzed on the LTQ-FT system with an ADVANCETM CaptiveSprayTM source (Michrom BioResources) at an electrospray potential of 1.5 kV. A gas flow of 2, ion transfer tube temperature of 180 °C, and collision gas pressure of 0.85 millitorrs were used. A full MS scan (350–1600 m/z range) was acquired in the FT-ICR cell at a resolution of 100,000 and a maximum ion accumulation time of 1000 ms. The automatic gain control target for FT was set at 1e+06, and precursor ion charge state screening was activated. The linear ion trap was used to collect peptides and to measure peptide fragments generated by collision-induced dissociation. The default automatic gain control setting was used (full MS target at 3.0e+04, MSn at 1e+04) in the linear ion trap. The 10 most intense ions above a 500-count threshold were selected for fragmentation in collision-induced dissociation (MS2), which was performed concurrently with a maximum ion accumulation time of 200 ms. For collision-induced dissociation, the activation Q was set at 0.25, isolation width (m/z) was 2.0, activation time was 30 ms, and normalized collision energy was 35% (27Gan C.S. Guo T. Zhang H. Lim S.K. Sze S.K. A comparative study of electrostatic repulsion-hydrophilic interaction chromatography (ERLIC) versus SCX-IMAC-based methods for phosphopeptide isolation/enrichment.J. Proteome Res. 2008; 7: 4869-4877Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The MS/MS spectra in the raw data were first extracted into the dta format using the extract_msn (version 4.0) in Bioworks Browser (version 3.3, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and then the dta files were converted into the Mascot generic file format using an in-house program. Intensity values and fragment ion m/z ratios were not manipulated. The Uniprot human protein database (downloaded on April 5, 2013, with 132,655 sequences; 43,940,360 residues) was used for database searches. The database search was performed using an in-house Mascot server (version 2.4.0, Matrix Science, London, UK) with MS tolerance of 10 ppm, option 13C of 2, and MS/MS tolerance of 0.8 Da. Two missed cleavage sites of trypsin were allowed. Carbamidomethylation (Cys) was set as a fixed modification, and oxidation (Met), deamidation (Asn-Gln), acetylation (Lys), methylation (Lys-Arg), dimethylation (Lys-Arg), and trimethylation (Lys) were set as variable modifications. The obtained database search results were exported to Microsoft Excel using the export_dat_2.pl script of Mascot for further analysis. Only peptides with E-values of less than 0.05 and Mowse scores greater than the identity or homology scores were further manually analyzed. pcDNA3.1 expression vectors encoding human PRB have been described previously (28Zheng Z.Y. Zheng S.M. Bay B.H. Aw S.E. C-L Lin V. Anti-estrogenic mechanism of unliganded progesterone receptor isoform B in breast cancer cells.Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2008; 110: 111-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Point mutations of the Lys residue at site 183 of PR to glutamine and arginine were generated using the QuikChange® XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The site-directed primers were designed using a Web-based program known as QuikChange® Primer Design. The mutations were verified by full-length cDNA sequencing. The sequences of mutagenic sense and antisense primers used were as follows: K183Q_sense, 5′-cgg cag ctg ccc atc agg tgc tgc ccc gg-3′; K183Q_antisense, 5′-ccg ggg cag cac ctg atg ggc agc tgc cg-3′; K183R_sense, 5′-gga cgg cag ctg ccc ata gag tgc tgc cc-3′; K183R_antisense, 5′-ggg cag cac tct atg ggc agc tgc cgt cc-3′. Predesigned control and p300 siRNAs (Ambion, Inc.) were transfected into ABC28 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. ABC28 cells were plated in phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 5% charcoal-stripped FBS and incubated at 37 °C for 48 h prior to transfection. For each well of a 6-well plate, 6 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 reagent and 40 nm siRNA were added into a final 2 ml of transfection medium and incubated for 8 h prior to a medium change. The sequences of p300 siRNA used were as follows: SiRNA1_sense, 5′-GCCUGGUUAUAUAACCGGAtt (Ambion SiRNA ID S4697); SiRNA1_antisense, 5′-UCCGGUUAUAUAACCAGGCat (Ambion SiRNA ID S4697), SiRNA2_sense, 5′-GGACUACCCUAUCAAGUAAtt (Ambion SiRNA ID S4695); SiRNA2_antisense, 5′-UUACUUGAUAGGGUAGUCCaa (Ambion SiRNA ID S4695). COS7 or HeLa cells were plated in 35-mm dishes at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells in antibiotic-free phenol red-free DMEM. The cells were then transfected with 0.5 μg of pc-DNA3.1, pc-DNA3.1wt-PRB, or the various pc-DNA3.1 Lys-183-PRB mutants using polyethyleneimine (PEI) (CELLnTEC, Switzerland) after 24 h of plating. The cells were then treated with 0.1% ethanol, 10 nm R5020 for 1 h at 24 h post-transfection. The cell lysate was then collected to test for the expression of total PR and phospho-PR. The in vitro acetylation assay was carried out as described (24Kim M.Y. Woo E.M. Chong Y.T. Homenko D.R. Kraus W.L.

PR peptide (KVGDSSGTAAAHK183VLPRGLSPARQL (wild type) or KVGDSSGTAAAHQ183VLPRGLSPARQL (K→Q))), 1 μg of recombinant histone H3 protein (as positive control), or immunoprecipitated PR was incubated with 0.25 μCi of [3H]acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) (Amersham Biosciences) and 100 ng of recombinant p300 enzyme (Active Motif) in 30 μl of acetylation buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 5% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, and 10 mm sodium butyrate. Immunoprecipitated HA-CBP or FLAG-PCAF were also tested for their activity in acetylating PR in in vitro acetylation experiments. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h, stopped by the addition of 5× Laemmli buffer, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The reactions were analyzed first by Coomassie Blue staining to verify the amounts of proteins used in each reaction, and the same gel was subsequently subjected to autoradiography to evaluate acetylation. The in vivo acetylation assay was carried out as reported (8Daniel A.R. Gaviglio A.L. Czaplicki L.M. Hillard C.J. Housa D. Lange C.A. The progesterone receptor hinge region regulates the kinetics of transcriptional responses through acetylation, phosphorylation, and nuclear retention.Mol. Endocrinol. 2010; 24: 2126-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, PR-deficient COS7 cells were grown in DMEM containing 7.5% FBS and were transfected with pcDNA3.1-FLAG-PR in the presence or absence of pCI-FLAG-p300 using PEI. The transfected COS7 cells were pretreated with 10 μm TSA for 30 min followed by vehicle control or 10 nm R5020 treatment for another 1 h before cell lysate collection. Protein lysate was collected for PR immunoprecipitation by FLAG antibody, and captured FLAG-PR and FLAG-p300 were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Acetylated proteins were probed by a pan-anti-acetylated lysine antibody (catalog no. 9441, Cell Signaling). Luciferase assay procedures were adapted from the manufacturer's protocol provided for the Dual-Luciferase Reporter System kit (Promega). Briefly, HeLa cells were seeded onto 60-mm dishes and were transfected with PEI with 5 ng of pcDNA3.1, pcDNA3.1-WT-PRB, or pcDNA3.1-PRB-K183Q/R in addition to 1500 ng of reporter plasmids, such as PRE-Luc reporter or NFκB-Luc reporter. 1 ng of Renilla pRL-CMV vector was co-transfected as normalization control. 24 h post-transfection, the cells were treated with 0.1% EtOH or 10 nm R5020 for 12 h before the were lysed by 1× passive lysis buffer provided in the Dual-Luciferase Reporter System kit (Promega). 20 μl of lysate were analyzed using a computer-controlled microplate luminometer (Thermo Scientific Fluoroskan® Ascent FL). The activities of the Renilla and firefly luciferase were measured according to the manufacturer's protocol. PRE/NFκB-dependent luciferase activity was normalized by Renilla reading and expressed as the average relative light units (RLU) of triplicate or four replicate measures ± S.E. -Fold induction by ligand was calculated as the ratio of ligand-induced sample RLU to the corresponding vehicle control-treated sample RLU. Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) based on the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was reverse transcribed with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) based on the manufacturer's protocol. Quantitative RT-PCR was carried out with SYBR Green master mix (Bio-Rad) on an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems) based on the manufacturer's protocol.

This enables bacteria to optimize their growth rates in natural environments that provide complex mixtures of nutrients. The regulatory mechanisms of CCR operate through subverting expression of genes required for the uptake and/or metabolism of secondary (less preferred) carbon sources in the presence of a preferred substrate (1Görke B. Stülke J. Carbon catabolite repression in bacteria. Many ways to make the most out of nutrients.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 6: 613-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). Such secondary carbon sources include aromatic compounds, which, after carbohydrates, are the most widely distributed class of organic compounds in nature. carbon catabolite repression receiver motif. Where studied, CCR mechanisms impact expression of pathways for the degradation of aromatic compounds. In contrast to enterics, such as Escherichia coli, which utilize glucose as the preferred carbon source, soil bacteria (e.g. Pseudomonas) metabolize many organic acids or amino acids in preference to sugars (2Collier D.N.

Far less is known about CCR control of anaerobic catabolism of aromatic compounds, although cases of this phenomenon have been reported. For example, some organic acids cause CCR of genes involved in the anaerobic degradation of aromatic compounds in Thauera aromatica (19Heider J. Boll M. Breese K. Breinig S. Ebenau-Jehle C. Feil U. Gad'on N. Laempe D. Leuthner B. Mohamed M.E. Schneider S. Burchhardt G. Fuchs G.

The bzd gene cluster, coding for anaerobic benzoate catabolism, in Azoarcus sp. strain CIB.J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5762-5774Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), whereas in closely related strains, such as Aromatoleum aromaticum EbN1, aromatic compounds are preferred carbon sources over aliphatic organic acids (21Trautwein K. Grundmann O. Wöhlbrand L. Eberlein C. Boll M. Rabus R. Benzoate mediates repression of C(4)-dicarboxylate utilization in “Aromatoleum aromaticum” EbN1.J. Bacteriol. 2012; 194: 518-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism(s) underlying CCR in these cases are still unknown. Elucidating the molecular mechanism(s) underlying CCR is important for both basic understanding of how metabolism is regulated in the environment and for potential biotechnological applications, such as optimizing bioremediation strategies and the design of tailor-made biocatalysts/biosensors (4Rojo F. Carbon catabolite repression in Pseudomonas. Optimizing metabolic versatility and interactions with the environment.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2010; 34: 658-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). This is particularly relevant for aromatic compounds that are difficult to degrade and tend to accumulate in the environment under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. In this work, we sought to use the denitrifying β-proteobacterium Azoarcus sp. CIB to analyze the mechanism(s) underlying CCR of anaerobic pathways for the dissimilation of aromatic compounds. Azoarcus sp. CIB is able to degrade aromatic compounds both aerobically and anaerobically (20López Barragán M.J. Carmona M. Zamarro M.T. Thiele B. Boll M. Fuchs G. García J.L. Díaz E.

Chem. 2010; 285: 35694-35705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, activity of the PN promoter also strictly requires the AcpR transcriptional activator, an ortholog of the E. coli Fnr global regulator, which specifically drives expression of the bzd catabolic operon in an oxygen-dependent manner (25Durante-Rodríguez G. Zamarro M.T. García J.L. Díaz E. Carmona M. Oxygen-dependent regulation of the central pathway for the anaerobic catabolism of aromatic compounds in Azoarcus sp. strain CIB.J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 2343-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In addition to this dual repressor/activator control, the PN promoter is also subject to control by the benzoyl-CoA dependent BoxR repressor, a BzdR paralog that regulates the expression of the box genes, indicating the existence of cross-regulation between the aerobic and anaerobic benzoate degradation pathways of Azoarcus sp. CIB (27Valderrama J.A. Durante-Rodríguez G. Blázquez B. García J.L. Carmona M. Díaz E. Bacterial degradation of benzoate. Cross-regulation between aerobic and anaerobic pathways.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 10494-10508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In our previous work (20López Barragán M.J. Carmona M. Zamarro M.T. Thiele B. Boll M. Fuchs G. García J.L. Díaz E. The bzd gene cluster, coding for anaerobic benzoate catabolism, in Azoarcus sp. strain CIB.J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5762-5774Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), we found that anaerobic expression of the bzd genes from the PN promoter is additionally subject to CCR control in response to organic acids, such as succinate, malate, and acetate, although the mechanism(s) underlying this level of control was not determined. In this work, we report the characterization of AccR as a response regulator that mediates anaerobic CCR control on the PN promoter. Based on our finding that AccR exerts anaerobic CCR control on central pathways for catabolism of other aromatics in Azoarcus sp. CIB, AccR constitutes the first master regulator described that controls CCR of anaerobic catabolism of aromatic compounds in bacteria. Because of the existence of AccR orthologs within the genomes of closely related Azoarcus/Thauera strains, we suggest that AccR is probably the global mediator of CCR control for anaerobic assimilation of aromatic compounds in this group of β-proteobacteria. Bacterial strains and plasmids used are listed in Table 1. Plasmids were constructed by standard molecular techniques (35Sambrook J. Rusell D.W. Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) with the fidelity of all PCR-derived DNA (Table 2) verified by sequencing. E. coli cells were routinely grown at 37 °C in lysogeny broth (LB) medium (35Sambrook J. Rusell D.W. Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). When required, E. coli AFMCPN was grown aerobically or anaerobically (using 10 mm nitrate as terminal electron acceptor) at 30 °C in M63 minimal medium (36Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar), supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml thiamine and 20 mm glycerol as the carbon source. Azoarcus strains were similarly grown aerobically or anaerobically at 30 °C in MC medium containing the indicated carbon source(s) as described previously (20López Barragán M.J. Carmona M. Zamarro M.T. Thiele B. Boll M. Fuchs G. García J.L. Díaz E. The bzd gene cluster, coding for anaerobic benzoate catabolism, in Azoarcus sp. strain CIB.J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5762-5774Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Where appropriate, antibiotics were added at the following concentrations: ampicillin (100 μg/ml), kanamycin (50 μg/ml), gentamicin (7.5 μg/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml). An AccR null derivative of Azoarcus sp. CIB was generated by homologous recombination using the R6K-based suicide plasmid pKNG101ΔaccR (Table 1), which allows positive selections of double site recombinants using the sacB gene of Bacillus subtilis (31Kaniga K.

Conjugation of pKNG101ΔaccR from replication-permissive E. coli SM10 λpir was used to introduce the plasmid into Azoarcus sp. CIB. Derivatives containing first site recombinants were selected on streptomycin-containing MC medium with 10 mm glutarate as the sole carbon source. Second site recombination was selected by growth on the same medium supplemented with 5% sucrose. Correct allelic exchange in sucrose-resistant and streptomycin-sensitive derivatives was verified using primers 5′AccRmut (BamHI) and 3′AccRmut (SpeI) (Table 2).TABLE 1Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this studyStrain or plasmidRelevant genotype or phenotypeaApr, ampicillin-resistant; Gmr, gentamicin-resistant; Kmr, kanamycin-resistant; Rfr, rifampicin-resistant; Smr, streptomycin-resistant.Reference or sourceE. coli strainsDH10BF′, mcrA Δ(mrr hsdRMS-mcrBC) φ80dlacΔM15 ΔlacX74 deoR recA1 araD139 Δ(ara-leu)7697 galU galK rpsL (Smr) endA1 nupGInvitrogenM15Strain for regulated high level expression with pQE vectorsQiagenMC4100araD139 Δ(argF-lac)U169 rpsL150 (Smr) relA1 flbB5301 deoC1 ptsF25 rbsR28Casadaban M.J.

https://openalex.org/W2080251413,"The aromatic amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine represent essential sources of high value natural aromatic compounds for human health and industry. Depending on the organism, alternative routes exist for their synthesis. Phenylalanine and tyrosine are synthesized either via phenylpyruvate/4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate or via arogenate. In arogenate-competent microorganisms, an aminotransferase is required for the transamination of prephenate into arogenate, but the identity of the genes is still unknown. We present here the first identification of prephenate aminotransferases (PATs) in seven arogenate-competent microorganisms and the discovery that PAT activity is provided by three different classes of aminotransferase, which belong to two different fold types of pyridoxal phosphate enzymes: an aspartate aminotransferase subgroup 1β in tested α- and β-proteobacteria, a branched-chain aminotransferase in tested cyanobacteria, and an N-succinyldiaminopimelate aminotransferase in tested actinobacteria and in the β-proteobacterium Nitrosomonas europaea. Recombinant PAT enzymes exhibit high activity toward prephenate, indicating that the corresponding genes encode bona fide PAT. PAT functionality was acquired without other modification of substrate specificity and is not a general catalytic property of the three classes of aminotransferases."

Since 1983, when HIV was found to be the causal agent of AIDS, great efforts have been made to design an effective vaccine to contain the virus. Despite these efforts and even after encouraging results from the RV144 vaccine clinical trial (1Rerks-Ngarm S. Pitisuttithum P. Nitayaphan S. Kaewkungwal J. Chiu J. Paris R. Premsri N.

However, the field of HIV vaccine research has experimented a resurgence with the identification of antibodies that neutralize most circulating HIV-1 strains.

These antibodies can protect against infection and suppress established HIV infection in animal models. The finding that these antibodies develop in a fraction of infected individuals supports the idea that new approaches to vaccination might be developed by adapting the natural immune strategies or by structure-based design of immunogens (3Klein F.

One of these bNAbs, 2F5, was discovered in a first generation of bNAbs against HIV-1 and has been extensively studied. bNAb 2F5 has strong neutralizing activity against a broad range of HIV-1 primary isolates (4Conley A.J.

Understanding the interaction of this antibody with its epitope requires not only a detailed knowledge of the structure but also knowing the physicochemical characteristics of the antigen (Ag)-antibody complex described by the kinetic rate constants, equilibrium constants, and thermodynamics of binding. Moreover, affinity and specificity are two of the most fundamental concepts of relevance to the molecular immunologist interested in understanding and characterizing Ag-Ab interactions. These concepts can be usefully defined in more than one way (15Greenspan N.S.

However, very few data have been reported to date about the thermodynamics of binding of the interaction between bNAb 2F5 and its corresponding epitope peptide, and they account only for the Fab fraction (16Julien J.P.

In this study, we have characterized thermodynamically the binding of bNAb 2F5 to peptides corresponding to both the core and functional epitopes by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC).

For instance, the IgG isotype has been shown to affect the Ag-binding and HIV-neutralizing activity of monoclonal (24Cavacini L.A. Emes C.L. Power J. Desharnais F.D. Duval M. Montefiori D.

Furthermore, 2F5 IgA2 and IgG1 display significantly different epitope specificity, antibody affinity, and functional activities (11Tudor D. Yu H. Maupetit J. Drillet A.S. Bouceba T. Schwartz-Cornil I. Lopalco L. Tuffery P. Bomsel M. Isotype modulates epitope specificity, affinity, and antiviral activities of anti-HIV-1 human broadly neutralizing 2F5 antibody.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 12680-12685Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It remains unclear whether allosteric influence between C and V regions is limited to the Fab domain or extends further to the hinge and Fc regions of Ig. This may be clarified by a comparative analysis of epitope recognition between IgG and its Fab fragment. However, very few comparative thermodynamic studies of this type by ITC have been reported. This information would help to elucidate whether the flexibility of the IgG molecule, mostly around the hinge region between the Fc and Fab regions (26Harris L.J. Skaletsky E. McPherson A. Crystallographic structure of an intact IgG1 monoclonal antibody.J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 861-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 27Saphire E.O. Stanfield R.L. Crispin M.D. Parren P.W.

Biol. 2002; 319: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), still allows for an effect on the Ab affinity by allosteric mechanisms. For this reason, we have completed this thermodynamic analysis by comparing the results of the binding of these peptides with 2F5 IgG and the 2F5 Fab fraction. Our results revealed higher binding affinities in the case of the functional epitope peptide, indicating that the presence of its flanking residues contributes to a strong affinity increase. Moreover, we also observed higher binding affinities for the complete IgG than for the Fab fraction, confirming that the immunoglobulin Fc region strongly influences bNAb 2F5 affinity. gp41 residues are numbered according to their positions in the full amino acid sequence of HXBc2 Env gp160 (http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/). Antibody 2F5 (28Kunert R. Rüker F. Katinger H. Molecular characterization of five neutralizing anti-HIV type 1 antibodies: identification of nonconventional D segments in the human monoclonal antibodies 2G12 and 2F5.AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1998; 14: 1115-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) in the IgG1(κ) form was kindly provided by Dr. Dietmar Katinger (Polymun, Klosterneuburg, Austria). Two chemically synthesized peptides representing different fragments of the gp41 MPER region including the 2F5 epitope, N16N (656NEQELLELDKWASLWN671) and E7S (662ELDKWAS668), were purchased from CASLO Laboratory ApS. Both peptides were N-acetylated and C-amidated at their termini. The 2F5 Fab fragments were generated via enzymatic digestion of IgG using a Fab preparation kit from Pierce Thermo Scientific. To maximize the purity, a size exclusion chromatography step with the pool of the 2F5 Fab fraction was carried out on a Superose 6 column (GE Healthcare) in PBS buffer (0.1 m sodium phosphate and 0.15 m sodium chloride; pH 7.2). Fab eluted from the column as a single peak at an elution volume corresponding to a monomer. Purity was also checked by SDS-PAGE. ITC experiments were performed with a high sensitivity VP-ITC microcalorimeter (MicroCal, Northampton, MA) at 25 °C. Antibody samples were extensively dialyzed against 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, for 24 h at 4 °C prior to the experiments. Peptides were directly dissolved in the same buffer. Possible pH variations were corrected, and the concentrations were measured spectrophotometrically by UV absorption at 280 nm using extinction coefficients determined via the ProtParam algorithm based on the amino acid sequences. Protein and peptide solutions were degassed for 10 min before measurements. The antibody solutions (5–11 μm) in the calorimetric cell were titrated with the corresponding peptide (250–500 μm) in successive injections with variable volumes ranging from 5 to 15 μl. The corresponding heats of peptide dilution into buffer were measured in separate blank experiments and used to correct the binding heats. The experimental isotherms were analyzed according to a binding model of n independent and identical sites using Origin software (OriginLab, Northampton, MA). The fit of the binding curve yields the binding stoichiometry (n), the equilibrium binding constant (Kb), and the enthalpy change (ΔHb) of the binding reaction. The free energy (ΔGb) and entropy (ΔSb) changes of binding are determined by the basic thermodynamic expressions ΔGb = −RT ln Kb = ΔHb − TΔSb, where R and T are the gas constant and the absolute temperature, respectively. To accurately measure the extremely high binding affinity of 2F5 IgG for the N16N peptide, ITC displacement experiments were carried out. The protocol for this ITC displacement experiment requires two different titrations: (i) a standard titration with the E7S peptide (weak ligand) binding to 2F5 IgG and (ii) a displacement titration with the N16N peptide (strong ligand) of 2F5 IgG in the presence of the E7S peptide. Both titrations are performed following the same steps. The direct titration has been described above. For the displacement titration, 2F5 IgG (5 μm) was mixed with the weak ligand (E7S, 230 μm) in the cell, and the mixture was titrated with the strong ligand (N16N, 220 μm) in successive injections of 5 μl. The corresponding heats of dilution of the N16N peptide into the buffer were used to correct the data. The thermodynamic parameters for the high affinity binding were determined by fitting the binding isotherms according to the equations developed by Sigurskjold (29Sigurskjold B.W. Exact analysis of competition ligand binding by displacement isothermal titration calorimetry.Anal.

First, a 2F5 IgG solution was titrated with the E7S peptide corresponding to the core epitope of this bNAb. The ITC thermogram (Fig. 1A) shows a Kd value (1/Kb) in the micromolar range (Kd = 0.9 ± 0.1 μm) for this peptide (Table 1). The number of antibody-binding sites was found to be close to two, as expected. The binding enthalpy is large and negative (−10.3 ± 0.4 kcal·mol−1), and the binding entropy is unfavorable (T·ΔSb = −2.1 kcal·mol−1).TABLE 1Thermodynamic parameters of the association of the N16N and E7S peptides with 2F5 IgG and 2F5 FabComplexNo. of binding sitesKdΔHbT·ΔSbΔGbnmkcal·mol−1kcal·mol−1kcal·mol−1N16N-2F5 IgG2.049 ± 0.002≈3−16.4 ± 0.1N16N-2F5 IgGaDisplacement ITC experiment.1.72 ± 0.030.82 ± 0.03−16.4 ± 0.4−4.0 ± 0.4−12.37 ± 0.02E7S-2F5 IgG1.88 ± 0.04885 ± 80−10.3 ± 0.4−2.1 ± 0.5−8.25 ± 0.08N16N-2F5 Fab1.05 ± 0.0150 ± 10−17.2 ± 0.4−7.3 ± 0.5−9.9 ± 0.1E7S-2F5 Fab0.99 ± 0.035800 ± 900−12.0 ± 0.5−4.9 ± 0.5−7.14 ± 0.04a Displacement ITC experiment. Open table in a new tab Then, a 2F5 IgG solution was titrated with the N16N peptide corresponding to the functional epitope of this bNAb. The ITC thermogram (Fig. 1B) indicates an extremely high binding affinity of antibody 2F5 for the N16N peptide (7Parker C.E. Deterding L.J. Hager-Braun C. Binley J.M. Schülke N. Katinger H. Moore J.P. Tomer K.B. Fine definition of the epitope on the gp41 glycoprotein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 for the neutralizing monoclonal antibody 2F5.J. Virol. 2001; 75: 10906-10911Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), which falls well above the proper range of the technique for an accurate direct determination. The Kd value estimated from this experiment is ∼3 nm, although this value has very high uncertainty. The number of antibody-binding sites derived from the isotherm is two, as expected for IgG. The binding enthalpy (ΔHb = −16.4 ± 0.1 kcal·mol−1) is negative and quite large for such a small peptide. An accurate determination of very high binding affinities (at nanomolar levels or even higher) is quite difficult by direct ITC titration. To overcome such a drawback, ITC displacement experiments can extend the useful range for the association constant determination (29Sigurskjold B.W. Exact analysis of competition ligand binding by displacement isothermal titration calorimetry.Anal. Biochem. 2000; 277: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 30Velazquez-Campoy A. Freire E. Isothermal titration calorimetry to determine association constants for high-affinity ligands.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 186-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). For the ITC displacement experiment (Fig. 1C), we selected the E7S peptide. The resulting binding isotherm was fitted to a binding competition model. The binding parameters of the E7S peptide were fixed in the fitting using those previously determined by ITC. From this experiment, we could determine very accurately the binding affinity for the N16N peptide (Kd = 0.82 ± 0.03 nm). As expected, the number of binding sites in the antibody found with this model was again close to two. As expected, the binding enthalpy (ΔHb = −16.4 ± 0.4 kcal·mol−1) is fully coincident to that determined with the standard ITC titration, which already provided a very accurate value for this parameter (Table 1). These values result in ΔGb = −12.37 ± 0.02 kcal·mol−1 and T·ΔSb = −4.0 ± 0.4 kcal·mol−1, confirming our previous conclusions about the enthalpically driven binding of 2F5 IgG to its epitope. This is compensated by a relatively small loss of entropy, suggesting that the configurational entropy loss due to peptide immobilization dominates the binding entropy over the hydrophobic interaction. If we compare the thermodynamic parameters obtained with the core or functional epitopes, we observe that the binding enthalpy is large and negative in both cases but significantly smaller in magnitude for the E7S peptide than for the N16N peptide. This result indicates less extensive interactions between the E7S peptide and the 2F5 paratope than those established with the N16N peptide. The binding entropy is also unfavorable in both cases but to a lower extent for E7S than for N16N, consistent with a lower entropy cost associated with peptide immobilization due the shorter peptide length. In conclusion, the MPER epitope recognized by 2F5 IgG is not limited to the putative core sequence (ELDKWAS). Flanking residues along the MPER sequence are important to establish additional interactions with the antibody paratope, strongly enhancing the binding affinity (31Biron Z. Khare S. Samson A.O. Hayek Y. Naider F. Anglister J.

Lett. 2013; 150: 152-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). 2F5 Fab solutions were directly titrated with the peptides (N16N and E7S). The resulting binding isotherms were analyzed using a model of binding to n independent sites (Fig. 1, A and B). The number of binding sites of Fab resulting from the fits was close to one for both peptides, as expected. The binding enthalpies are ΔHb(N16N) = −17.2 ± 0.4 kcal·mol−1 and ΔHb(E7S) = −12.0 ± 0.5 kcal·mol−1, and the dissociation constants are Kd(N16N) = 50 ± 10 nm and Kd(E7S) = 5.8 ± 0.9 μm. The binding enthalpies for Fab are quite similar to those obtained for 2F5 IgG, indicating a similar interaction between the Ig paratopes and each of the epitopes, although the ΔHb values found for Fab are slightly more negative. The binding affinities are much lower, however, for Fab than for IgG under the same conditions (Table 1). The affinity of 2F5 Fab for the N16N peptide is of the same order as that reported elsewhere for recombinant 2F5 Fab (Kd = 20 nm) (16Julien J.P. Huarte N. Maeso R. Taneva S.G. Cunningham A. Nieva J.L. Pai E.F. Ablation of the complementarity-determining region H3 apex of the anti-HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibody 2F5 abrogates neutralizing capacity without affecting core epitope binding.J. Virol. 2010; 84: 4136-4147Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), although the binding enthalpy is higher in our case, possibly due to the use of different buffer conditions. In fact, HEPES was used as the buffer at the same pH, so the ionization heat of this buffer may influence the observed binding enthalpy if proton exchange is coupled to the binding process. In our case, we used sodium phosphate buffer, which has a practically null ionization heat, therefore providing a binding enthalpy value unaffected by ionization effects. The strong decrease in affinity of 2F5 Fab for N16N and E7S can be fully ascribed to a higher binding entropy cost, partially opposed by a slightly more favorable binding enthalpy. We have characterized by ITC the thermodynamics of binding between antibody 2F5 (in both the IgG and Fab forms) and its cognate peptide epitope. The binding of these complexes is driven by a large negative enthalpy change and opposed by a negative entropy change, showing typical enthalpy-entropy compensation. Our results confirm previous reports concluding that the putative core epitope ELDKWAS is not sufficient for high binding affinity but that additional flanking residues strongly increase this affinity by the establishment of additional interactions with the antibody. This is consistent with early observations by limited proteolysis extending the 2F5-recognized epitope to the N16N sequence (7Parker C.E. Deterding L.J. Hager-Braun C. Binley J.M. Schülke N. Katinger H. Moore J.P. Tomer K.B. Fine definition of the epitope on the gp41 glycoprotein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 for the neutralizing monoclonal antibody 2F5.J. Virol. 2001; 75: 10906-10911Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Moreover, there are also close and specific contacts with residues located N-terminal to the epitope core, and several residues C-terminal to the ELDKWAS core have been observed to adopt an ordered helical conformation in the crystal structures of the complexes between peptides and 2F5 Fab (8Ofek G.

Biol. 2008; 384: 377-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Our thermodynamic data indicate that interactions established by the flanking residues with the core contribute strongly to the favorable binding enthalpy with a relatively small entropy penalty and therefore suggest that these residues appear to establish interactions with the antibody paratope that may be stronger than anticipated by the reported crystal structures of 2F5 Fab with MPER peptides. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that the N16N peptide encompasses all of the antigenic elements of the 2F5 epitope. Additional hydrophobic contacts between the long CDRH3 loop of 2F5 and residues downstream into the MPER C terminus have been proposed to help stabilize the extended loop-bound conformation (16Julien J.P.

The CDRH3 loop has also been reported recently to assist in the extraction of the lipid-immersed MPER prior to tight binding (12Song L. Sun Z.Y. Coleman K.E. Zwick M.B. Gach J.S. Wang J.H.

Other MPER-distant gp41 regions have been recently proposed to participate in stabilizing the antigenic conformation of the epitope in the lipid context (36Huarte N. Araujo A. Arranz R. Lorizate M. Quendler H. Kunert R. Valpuesta J.M. Nieva J.L. Recognition of membrane-bound fusion-peptide/MPER complexes by the HIV-1 neutralizing 2F5 antibody: implications for anti-2F5 immunogenicity.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e52740Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Calorimetric studies with MPER peptides in a model membrane environment would be needed to elucidate the thermodynamic determinants of these effects. In addition, we have measured a much higher affinity of 2F5 IgG compared with 2F5 Fab for the binding of each peptide. The affinity for N16N is increased by ∼60 times, corresponding to a binding Gibbs energy decrease of about −2.4 kcal·mol−1, and in the case of E7S, this affinity increase is ∼6-fold, with a binding Gibbs energy decrease of −1.1 kcal·mol−1. Interestingly, the binding enthalpies are slightly more negative for Fab compared with IgG by −0.8 kcal·mol−1 for N16N and −1.7 kcal·mol−1 for E7S. These differences cannot be explained solely from the point of view of the Ab-epitope binding interface at the V domain and may be attributable to a higher structural flexibility of free Fab in comparison with IgG. Upon complex formation, a larger decrease in conformational flexibility and tightening of structural interactions within the Fab domain structure may account for the observed thermodynamic differences. This suggests that the presence of the Fc domain in the whole 2F5 IgG contributes strongly to conformationally stabilizing the binding-competent Fab domain by an allosteric mechanism. There are very few thermodynamic studies comparing the Ag binding of whole Abs with that of the Fab or Fv fragments, and they generally show similar thermodynamic magnitudes (37Schwarz F.P. Tello D. Goldbaum F.A. Mariuzza R.A. Poljak R.J. Thermodynamics of antigen-antibody binding using specific anti-lysozyme antibodies.Eur. J.

However, although traditionally the binding sites in the V regions of immunoglobulins have been considered functionally independent, significant binding-related allosteric effects between the V and C regions of antibodies have also become progressively evident. For example, Pritsch et al. (18Pritsch O. Hudry-Clergeon G. Buckle M. Petillot Y. Bouvet J.P. Gagnon J. Dighiero G. Can immunoglobulin C(H)1 constant region domain modulate antigen binding affinity of antibodies?.J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2235-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) demonstrated that two human Ab isotypes sharing identical V regions bind tubulin with significantly different affinities. Putterman and co-workers (22Xia Y. Janda A. Eryilmaz E. Casadevall A. Putterman C. The constant region affects antigen binding of antibodies to DNA by altering secondary structure.Mol. Immunol. 2013; 56: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) also demonstrated that anti-nuclear Abs with identical V regions but different C regions exhibit diverse binding affinities for histones. Their observations reflect differences in accessibility to binding sites depending on the flexibility of the various Fab fragments in association with different C regions and differences at the paratope level. Dam et al. (21Dam T.K. Torres M. Brewer C.F. Casadevall A.

Chem. 2008; 283: 31366-31370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) also used ITC to investigate the interactions between four monoclonal antibodies with identical V regions and a univalent peptide Ag, providing unambiguous thermodynamic evidence for the influence of the C region on the interaction of the V region with an Ag. Torres and Casadevall (23Torres M. Casadevall A. The immunoglobulin constant region contributes to affinity and specificity.Trends Immunol. 2008; 29: 91-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) have proposed that electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions resulting from differences in the microenvironment of constant heavy chain (CH) domains (e.g. pH and ionic strength) may affect the Ag-binding site. Additionally, the arrangement of the Fab C domains relative to the V domains and to each other may increase the probability of an appropriate relative orientation of the V heavy (H) and light (L) chains, which, in turn, can shape the Ag-binding site and affect affinity. The influence of the C region on V region affinity and/or specificity has important implications for the choice of isotype in therapeutic Abs and for the creation of more effective vaccines (20Casadevall A. Janda A. Immunoglobulin isotype influences affinity and specificity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 12272-12273Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Very recently, Casadevall and co-workers (40Eryilmaz E. Janda A. Kim J. Cordero R.J. Cowburn D. Casadevall A. Global structures of IgG isotypes expressing identical variable regions.Mol. Immunol. 2013; 56: 588-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) studied four IgG isotypes with identical V regions by small angle x-ray scattering, and they provided additional evidence that the Ig V and C domains influence each other structurally and suggested that V region structure can have significant effects on the overall Ig structure. Also significantly, differences in affinity and epitope specificity have been described between 2F5 IgA and IgG isotypes (11Tudor D. Yu H. Maupetit J. Drillet A.S. Bouceba T. Schwartz-Cornil I. Lopalco L. Tuffery P. Bomsel M. Isotype modulates epitope specificity, affinity, and antiviral activities of anti-HIV-1 human broadly neutralizing 2F5 antibody.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 12680-12685Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), supporting a role of the CH1 domain in modulating antibody affinity as a consequence of differences in CH1 flexibility. Moreover, using bacterial proteins A and G as probes for CH binding, Sagawa et al. (41Sagawa T. Oda M. Morii H. Takizawa H. Kozono H. Azuma T. Conformational changes in the antibody constant domains upon hapten-binding.Mol. Immunol. 2005; 42: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) demonstrated that hapten binding to the Fv region can induce long-range conformational changes in the Fc region of IgG. Recently, Ofran and co-workers (42Sela-Culang I. Alon S. Ofran Y. A systematic comparison of free and bound antibodies reveals binding-related conformational changes.J. Immunol. 2012; 189: 4890-4899Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) compared a large number of free and bound antibody crystal structures to explore possible allosteric effects associated with binding. They detected many structural changes occurring far from the Ag-binding site, including changes in the relative orientation of the H and L chains in both the V and C domains; changes in the elbow angle between the V and C domains; and quite consistently, conformational changes in an intrinsically disordered loop in the CH domain, which is implicated in the interaction between the H and L chains. This CH1 loop is also close in space to the hinge region connecting the CH1 domain to Fc in IgG, and its conformational changes may affect the relative orientation between the CH1 domain versus Fc, thereby influencing effector binding to Fc. The results presented here provide direct evidence from a thermodynamic point of view of the effect of the Fc region on the immunoglobulin affinity. This and other previous evidence support that long-range cooperative motions in the 2F5 Fab domain may be more or less restricted by the presence or absence of Fc mediated by the CH1 domain, and this may in turn influence binding affinity. In conclusion, the thermodynamic parameters determined here for binding of bNAb 2F5 to its cognate epitope and the results related to the involvement of the Fc region in Ab affinity are important for understanding the structural and thermodynamic determinants of Ag-Ab recognition and provide useful information for the design of new therapeutics and vaccines against HIV.

We constructed composite models of the human postcapillary venule, combining ECs with PCs or PC-deposited BM, to better study this process. Quiescent and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α)-activated composites demonstrated in situ-like expression of cadherins, E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1), CD99, and interleukin 8 (IL-8). After TNF-α activation, the ECs supported greater neutrophil adhesion (66.1 vs. 23.7% of input cells) and transmigration (35.1 vs. 7.20% of input cells) than did the PCs, but the composites behaved comparably (no significant difference) to ECs in both assays. TNF-α-activated EC-conditioned medium (CM) increased transmigration across the PCs, whereas TNF-α-activated PC-CM decreased transmigration across the ECs, and culturing on PC-derived BM decreased both adhesion to and transmigration across the ECs. Anti-very late antigen 4 (VLA-4; on neutrophils) inhibited adhesion to TNF-α-activated composites, but not to ECs alone. Anti-CD99 (expressed on all 3 cell types) inhibited transmigration across the composites (14.5% of control) more than across the ECs (39.0% of control), and venular shear stress reduced transmigration across the ECs (17.3% of static) more than across the composites (36.7% of static).

https://openalex.org/W2028834087,"In the mammalian cell cycle, both CYCLIN A and CYCLIN B are required for entry into mitosis, and their elimination is also essential to complete the process. During mitosis, CYCLIN A and CYCLIN B are ubiquitylated by the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) and then subjected to proteasomal degradation. However, CYCLIN A, but not CYCLIN B, begins to be degraded in the prometaphase when APC/C is inactivated by the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). Here, we show that APOLLON (also known as BRUCE or BIRC6) plays a role in SAC-independent degradation of CYCLIN A in early mitosis. APPOLON interacts with CYCLIN A that is not associated with cyclin-dependent kinases. APPOLON also interacts with APC/C, and it facilitates CYCLIN A ubiquitylation. In APPOLON-deficient cells, mitotic degradation of CYCLIN A is delayed, and the total, but not the cyclin-dependent kinase-bound, CYCLIN A level was increased. We propose APPOLON to be a novel regulator of mitotic CYCLIN A degradation independent of SAC."

A chlR-lacking mutant, ΔchlR, shows poor photoautotrophic growth due to low chlorophyll (Chl) content under low-oxygen conditions, which is caused by no induction of the operon. Here, we characterized the processes of etiolation of ΔchlR cells in low-oxygen conditions and the subsequent regreening of the etiolated cells upon exposure to oxygen, by HPLC, Western blotting, and low-temperature fluorescence spectra. The Chl content of the etiolated ΔchlR cells incubated under low-oxygen conditions for 7 days was only 10% of that of the wild-type with accumulation of almost all intermediates of the magnesium branch of Chl biosynthesis. Both photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII) were significantly decreased, accompanied by a preferential decrease of antenna Chl in PSI. Upon exposure to oxygen, the etiolated ΔchlR cells resumed to produce Chl after a short lag (∼2 h), and the level at 72 h was 80% of that of the wild-type. During this novel ""oxygen-induced"" greening process, the PSI and PSII contents were largely increased in parallel with the increase in Chl contents. After 72 h, the PSI content reached ∼50% of the wild-type level in contrast to the full recovery of PSII. ΔchlR provides a promising alternative system to investigate the biogenesis of PSI and PSII."

Phosphorylation of Thr-457 on the short cytoplasmic domain isoform (CEACAM1-SF) that is predominant in normal epithelial cells is required for lumen formation in a three-dimensional model that involves apoptosis of the central acinar cells. Calmodulin kinase IID (CaMKIID) was selected as a candidate for the kinase required for Thr-457 phosphorylation from a gene chip analysis comparing genes up-regulated in MCF7 cells expressing wild type CEACAM1-SF compared with the T457A-mutated gene (Chen, C. J., Kirshner, J., Sherman, M. A., Hu, W., Nguyen, T., and Shively, J. E. (2007) J. Biol. Chem. 282, 5749-5760). Up-regulation of CaMKIID during lumen formation was confirmed by analysis of mRNA and protein levels. CaMKIID was able to phosphorylate a synthetic peptide corresponding to the cytoplasmic domain of CEACAM1-SF and was covalently bound to biotinylated and T457C-modified peptide in the presence of a kinase trap previously described by Shokat and co-workers (Maly, D. J., Allen, J. A., and Shokat, K. M. (2004) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 126, 9160-9161). When cell lysates from wild type-transfected MCF7 cells undergoing lumen formation were incubated with the peptide and kinase trap, a cross-linked band corresponding to CaMKIID was observed. When these cells were treated with an RNAi that inhibits CaMKIID expression, lumen formation was blocked by over 90%. We conclude that CaMKIID specifically phosphorylates Thr-457 on CEACAM1-SF, which in turn regulates the process of lumen formation via apoptosis of the central acinar cells."

Inverse PCR strategy for integration site analysis demonstrated integration of at least 1 or 2 copies of GFP in the transgenics, mapping to different chromosomes. GFP expression was detected in a wide range of murine tissues, including testis and the transgene was stably transmitted to a third generation of transgenic animals. This relatively simple, yet highly efficient, technique for generating transgenic animals by transducing spermatozoa with lentiviral vectors in vitro is a powerful tool for the study of fertilization/preimplantation development, vertical viral gene transmission, gene function and regulation, and epigenetic inheritance.—Chandrashekran, A., Sarkar, R., Thrasher, A., Fraser, S.
