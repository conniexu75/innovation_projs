https://openalex.org/W2030602557,"The mixed-function oxidases of a polyphagous insect larva (the southern armyworm, Spodoptera eridania) were found to be induced by a diversity of secondary plant substances. The induction proceeds rapidly and in response to a small quantity of secondary substance. Following induction, the larva is less susceptible to dietary poisoning. It is argued that mixed-function oxidases play a major role in protecting herbivores against chemical stress from secondary plant substances."
https://openalex.org/W2044818726,"The Parker-Levy approach to reversals of the geomagnetic field predicts meridional transitional paths of the virtual geomagnetic pole (VGP) which pass either through the site of observation or through its antipode, depending upon the site location and the sense of the polarity transition. Comparison with the most detailed transitional VGP path records presently available gives some indication of the above behavior as predicted by the Parker-Levy model. Discrepancies may be due to complexities in the distribution of cyclonic convection cells in the core not considered in the formal mathematical treatment. The predicted variation in transitional field intensity experienced at any given site also is compatible with several reported transition records."
https://openalex.org/W1973139594,"Sailing trials with two reconstructed Polynesian double canoes indicate that these craft can make good a course to windward up to approximately 75 degrees off the wind on long ocean voyages. This windward performance would have enabled Polynesians to exert a degree of control over their movements that would have been denied them had they only been able to sail or drift before wind and current. Indeed, without this windward sailing capacity there probably never would have been a Polynesian people today, for in a sense they are a product of their maritime technology. Had there been no great voyaging canoes, the settlement of Polynesia might have had to await the relatively late entry into the Pacific of the European navigators. But the Pacific was the scene of early innovation in weatherly sailing canoes, and as the European navigators ""discovered"" island after island, they were surprised to find that neolithic seafarers had preceded them into this vast ocean realm."
https://openalex.org/W2022237754,Lithium-sodium beta alumina having a lithium/sodium ratio greater than about I appears to be the first generally useful lithium superionic conductor that has been reported. It exhibits strikingly nonlinear ion exchange properties and may presage the discovery of similar co-ionic interactions in other superionic conductors. The properties of lithium-sodium beta alumina are discussed in relation to current concepts of ionic interaction and distribution in the beta alumina conduction plane.
https://openalex.org/W2048903926,"The exocrine secretion of the ""stinkpot turtle,"" Sternotherus odoratus, discharged by the animals in response to disturbance, contains four ω-phenylalkanoic acids (phenylacetic, 3-phenylpropionic, 5-phenylpentanoic, and 7-phenylheptanoic). The last two of these are new natural products. The first two are powerfully malodorous and responsible for the stench of the fluid. Lesser components, including several aliphatic acids, are also present. Only a few milligrams of secretion are discharged by a turtle at any one time. Although bioassays with fish suggest that the secretion has the potential to serve as a feeding deterrent to predators, it is argued that Sternotherus does not ordinarily discharge enough fluid to effect this action and may employ its secretion only as an aposematic signal that warns predators of its more generalized undesirability."

These relations are expressed in terms of the neutron multiplication factor obtained in the fusion blanket, and the analogous quantities represented by the conversion ratios of the fast and thermal fission associated with the comparison. Results are presented graphically both for the steady state and for industries of arbitrary growth rate, and include the influence of tritium production requirements. Even a modest blanket neutron multiplication factor could enable the hybrid fusion system greatly to outperform the fast breeder on this simple basis of material balances."

The initial identification with Landsat imagery is attributed to the unique perspective provided by such imagery."
