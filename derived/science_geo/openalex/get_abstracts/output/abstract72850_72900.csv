https://openalex.org/W1559964759,"Abstract The interaction of free flavocoenzymes with sulfite is described. The synthesis of a few flavin sulfite complexes isolated in the crystalline state and the elucidation of their structure by light and infrared absorption spectroscopy are described. It was found that sulfite binds at the N-5 position of the flavin molecule. Elemental analysis data show that one sulfite molecule is bound per flavin molecule. The flavin sulfite adduct formation is dependent on the absolute concentrations of the reactants, temperature, and pH but is not affected by oxygen or light. The reacting nucleophile species was found to be SO3= rather than HSO3-. The adduct formation reaction is reversible in the pH range g2. At pH l0 the flavin sulfite complex is hydrolyzed yielding a sulfate flavin ratio of 0.95. The light absorption spectrum of the flavin adduct is similar to but not identical with that of the 1,5-dihydroflavin, the latter showing considerable absorption in the visible region whereas the former shows only very little absorption. A number of flavin derivatives were investigated and the dissociation constants of the adducts and the rate constant of the formation of the complex determined. A good correlation was found between the dissociation constants of the sulfite adducts and the oxidation reduction potentials of the corresponding flavoquinones. The mechanism of the formation of the adduct and the possible biological significance of these findings is discussed. The flavin sulfite interaction is also compared with the sulfite interaction occurring with other compounds of biological interest."

https://openalex.org/W1986425431,"The alternating copolymer riboadenylic-ribouridylic acid gained a significant increase in ability to stimulate interferon production (2- to 20-fold) and cellular resistance (100- to 10,000-fold) both in vitro and in vivo upon substitution of phosphate by thiophosphate groups. The resulting nucleotide analog was also 10 to 100 times less sensitive to degradation by pancreatic ribonuclease, as determined by residual antiviral activity."

https://openalex.org/W2111619414,"Abstract The natural hemagglutinin of the oyster Crassostrea virginica was examined for possible structural relationship with vertebrate immunoglobulins. The hemagglutinin activity was associated with a heterogeneous group of rapidly sedimenting molecules. The major active component in oyster hemolymph has a sedimentation coefficient of 33.4 S, but minor components with lower sedimentation coefficients are also present. The molecules can be dissociated into subunits consisting of single polypeptide chains having an approximate molecular weight of 20,000. Complete dissociation could be observed in 5 m guanidine-HCl indicating noncovalent linkage of the subunit. Amino acid composition of the subunit was distinguished by a relatively high histidine content and the absence of lysine. The sequence of the first 2 residues from the NH2 terminus of the subunit was found to be Thr-Ala. Mannose, galactose, and glucosamine were present with a total carbohydrate content of 13%. These data do not demonstrate obvious structural similarities to mammalian immunoglobulins."
https://openalex.org/W1994020615,"Mouse spleen cells were separated into two populations on the basis of adherence to plastic. The recombination of these two populations was required for the in vitro antibody response to sheep erythrocytes. By separating the two populations from x-irradiated mice and combining each with the other population prepared from normal mice, it was demonstrated that the immunologic function of the nonadherent population only was highly sensitive to x-ray injury. In contrast, x-irradiation in doses as high as 1000 roentgens had no measurable effect on the immune function of adherent cells, that is, the population which first interacts with antigen and is composed principally of large phagocytic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1516542816,"Abstract The acetyl coenzyme A-l-aspartate N-acetyltransferase activity of a previously reported preparation obtained from the supernatant phase of rat brain homogenates by ammonium sulfate fractionation was reinvestigated and substantiated. The enzyme activity was located in particles, probably microsomes, dispersed in the supernatant fluid. A homogenate system with comparatively high N-acetylaspartate synthesizing capacity in the presence of acetyl-CoA and l-aspartate is described. The activity of this preparation was recovered in association with the particulate structures. Acetone-dried powders of the crude mitochondrial fraction and a microsomal fraction had specific activities approximating 40 and 20% that of the respective fresh tissue constituents."
https://openalex.org/W1566590913,"The sites of transferrin synthesis and the factors affecting synthesis were investigated in the rat by measuring the incorporation of 14C-leucine into transferrin, albumin, and γG-globulin precipitated with specific antisera. Twenty minutes after the intravenous injection of 14C-leucine, the radioactivity was incorporated into microsomal transferrin of liver in much greater amounts than into that of other tissues. After incubation of tissue slices with 14C-leucine in vitro, however, radioactivity was incorporated into transferrin by liver, spleen, and bone marrow at about the same rates per unit per weight of tissue. Because of its greatest bulk, the liver again appeared to be by far the most important organ for transferrin synthesis. The incorporation of 14C-leucine into transferrin and albumin by liver slices was used as a measure of synthesis of the proteins. Transferrin synthesis was increased in rats with hemorrhagic iron deficiency anemia and in rats treated with thyroxine or exposed to reduced atmospheric pressure. Prior treatment of rats with 100 µg of actinomycin D per 100 g of body weight did not prevent the increase in transferrin synthesis produced by exposure to reduced atmospheric pressure. Decreased synthesis was found with liver from rats with transfusional polycythemia, fasted rats, and rats given propylthiouracil. Thyroxine and propylthiouracil treatment and fasting had similar effects on albumin synthesis, but the other treatments had no effect. Iron loading with iron-dextran and acute and chronic hemolytic anemia produced with phenylhydrazine and methyl cellulose, respectively, resulted in little change in transferrin synthesis by liver slices."
https://openalex.org/W2060368587,"Mouse fibroblasts (L cells) in suspension culture incorporated isolated chloroplasts of spinach and African violets and isolated mitochondria of chicken liver. The organelles resided in the cell cytoplasm and were not contained in vacuoles or digestion vesicles. Green cells divided like normal cells. Green chloroplasts were followed for five cell generations or 5 days, at which time hybrid cells were greatly outnumbered by nongreen progeny cells. The ingested chloroplasts retained their structural integrity as determined by electron microscopy of organelles and hybrid cells and by analysis of photochemical activity and DNA in chloroplasts reisolated from cells after 1 or 2 days in culture."

https://openalex.org/W1536053198,"Abstract The temperature jump pulse relaxation method has been used to study the kinetics of oxygen binding to sperm whale myoglobin, to the α and β chains of human hemoglobin, and to native human and sheep hemoglobins. In addition we also investigated the kinetics of binding of ethyl isocyanide to human hemoglobin by the same method. The kinetics of the reaction has been followed through changes in absorbance. The results show that binding of oxygen to the isolated α and β subunits, as well as to sperm whale myoglobin, is kinetically a simple process, in that the reaction follows bimolecular kinetics. The relaxation kinetics of ligand binding to hemoglobin is complex, and the analysis given in this paper is still preliminary. Under a variety of experimental conditions, the relaxation spectrum can be described by two relaxation times (τf and τs). The concentration dependence of the slower relaxation time (τs) follows the behavior expected for a bimolecular process; this suggests that the final process by which equilibrium is re-established is not followed by any first order process, such as a slow intramolecular change in structure. The similarity of the relaxation spectrum at different ionic strengths (from 0.2 to 2.2 m) suggests that the relaxation behavior of hemoglobin is consistent with a model in which the (αβ) dimer is functionally important."
https://openalex.org/W2101323362,"A highly purified preparation of arginine kinase from the tail muscle of the crayfish, Panulirus longipes, has been used to investigate the mechanism of the reaction. The results of initial velocity, product inhibition, and isotope exchange at equilibrium studies are consistent with the reaction having a random mechanism in which all the steps are in rapid equilibrium except those concerned with the interconversion of the central ternary complexes. They also indicate that there is formation of two dead end complexes: enzyme-MgATP-phosphoarginine and enzyme-MgADP-arginine. Values are reported for the Michaelis and dissociation constants for the reaction of substrates with various enzyme forms. It has been demonstrated that an adenosine diphosphate-adenosine triphosphate exchange reaction takes place in the absence of guanidino substrates and that an arginine-phosphoarginine exchange reaction occurs in the absence of nucleotide substrates. However, the exchange rates are slow compared with the rates of the complete reaction, and thus it would appear that only a small proportion of the reaction flux does occur through a ping-pong reaction sequence. In the reverse reaction, phosphoarginine causes marked substrate inhibition that is of the noncompetitive type."
https://openalex.org/W2003425900,"Injection of frog embryos (Rana pipiens) with a zonal centrifuge purified fraction of herpes-type virus (prepared from virus-containing Lucké tumors) resulted in a high incidence of kidney tumors. This partially purified oncogenic fraction contained a high concentration of an enveloped form of the frog herpes-type virus (adjacent fractions lacked this particle and were not oncogenic), which suggests that this form of the virus plays a role in the genesis of the Lucké tumor."

https://openalex.org/W1485748213,"Abstract Evidence is presented for a new carboxylation reaction, designated the α-ketobutyrate synthase reaction, which involves a ferredoxin-dependent reductive carboxylation of propionyl coenzyme A to α-ketobutyrate. The new enzyme appears to be a separate protein not associated with pyruvate or α-ketoglutarate synthase. α-Ketobutyrate synthase was found in cell-free preparations from the photosynthetic bacterium Chromatium, and from the anaerobic nonphotosynthetic bacteria, Clostridium pasteurianum and Desulfovibrio desulfuricans. The new enzyme was present in Chromatium cells grown autotrophically on CO2 or on media supplemented with malate or propionate, and its formation was unrelated to the carbon source used for growth. α-Ketobutyrate synthase provides a new mechanism for the reductive assimilation of propionate and CO2. An analysis of cellular products formed by Chromatium cells grown with 14C-propionate indicates that α-ketobutyrate synthase supplies, independently of threonine and threonine dehydratase, α-ketobutyrate needed in the biosynthesis of isoleucine and α-aminobutyrate."

The results are consistent with synthesis of protein at nerve endings, or with extremely rapid transport of particulate protein to nerve endings in the mouse cerebrum, or both."

https://openalex.org/W1605469284,"The thermal denaturation of ribonuclease A and of S-protein in neutral aqueous solutions has been studied by means of their circular dichroism spectra. For RNase A, the positive circular dichroism extremum near 241 mµ shows a biphasic dependence upon temperature, a linear change between 15° and 50° being followed by a sharp one above 52°. The negative circular dichroism extremum at 277 mµ exhibits only a sharp change at the higher temperatures and appears unchanged between 10° and 50°. Upon cooling of the solution from 65°, enzymic activity is fully recovered, as is the initial magnitude of the 277 mµ extremum, but the ellipticity of the cooled solution at 241 mµ is lower. A positive circular dichroism extremum at 237 mµ is observed in spectra of S-protein below 25°, as well as a negative circular dichroism extremum at 277 mµ; both of these extrema disappear upon heating. In contrast to RNase A, the thermal changes observed for S-protein are not reversible."

https://openalex.org/W1608389377,"Abstract We have examined the effects of cortisol in vitro on RNA metabolism in isolated, cultured bone cells. Treatment for as little as 2 hours decreased the incorporation of radioactively labeled nucleosides (uridine, adenosine, or guanosine) into RNA. This appears to result from reduced influx or phosphorylation (or both) of free nucleosides, since the accumulation of radioactivity in intracellular nucleotide pools (UMP, UDP, UTP) was also inhibited, but efflux of uridine nucleotides was not increased. Inhibition persisted after refeeding treated cells with fresh, cortisol-free medium, and was evident at a high (1 mm) as well as a low (13 µm) starting concentration of uridine in the incubation medium, suggesting that it was not caused by enhanced dilution of radioactive uridine in expanded intra- or extracellular pools of nonradioactive uridine. The possibility that the accumulation of radioactivity in nucleotide pools was inhibited by a feedback mechanism caused by prior reduction in RNA synthesis seems unlikely, in view of the simultaneous and equivalent effects of cortisol on the labeling of nucleotide pools and RNA. Treatment of bone cells with actinomycin D was accompanied by a decrease in the accumulation of RNA precursors only after inhibition of RNA synthesis was well established. Protein synthesis may be required for this response to cortisol since cortisol was ineffective when cells were treated simultaneously with either puromycin or cycloheximide, inhibitors of protein synthesis which did not in themselves block nucleoside incorporation. In addition to inhibiting the accumulation of RNA precursors and their incorporation into RNA, cortisol treatment gradually reduced the total content of RNA per culture (5 to 10% in 5 hours, 20 to 30% in 15 hours) and the amount of 18 S and 28 S ribosomal RNA per culture. Two observations suggest that this loss of RNA results in part from an acceleration of RNA breakdown: (a) the breakdown of endogenous, previously labeled RNA was increased in isolated microsomes derived from cortisol-treated cells and (b) addition of cortisol to cells which had been continuously labeled with radioactive uridine from initial seeding until treatment significantly enhanced the decline in RNA total radioactivity during the chase period. In addition, the rate of RNA synthesis, as estimated from the change in RNA specific radioactivity during the chase period, was decreased by treatment with cortisol. Cortisol effects were related to its glucocorticoid activity, and were directly proportional to its starting concentration, minimal changes appearing at near physiological concentrations (10 to 100 mµm)."

https://openalex.org/W1550427651,"Abstract Halobacterium cutirubrum extracts exhibit no menadione reductase activity in the absence of salt; activity increases with salt concentration to a maximum at 2 m or higher concentrations of sodium chloride. The enzyme activity lost at low salt concentrations can be restored by adding 2 m NaCl. In addition to this reversible loss of activity, the enzyme also exhibits a time-dependent irreversible inactivation at salt concentrations below 2 m. The effects of salt on the initial enzyme activity and on the irreversible inactivation have a reciprocal relationship to one another. A mechanism for the salt effect is proposed, on the basis of kinetic data, whereby the active, stable form of the enzyme is in a salt-dependent equilibrium with an inactive, unstable form. The effect of NaCl, according to this model, is not to prevent the irreversible denaturation of the enzyme but rather to shift the equilibrium in favor of the active, stable form. The pH dependence of the inactivation rate constant and the reversibility of the pH effect indicate that there is an acid-base equilibrium, with pK = 9.3, between a less and a more stable intermediate form of the enzyme. Low concentrations of MgCl2, CaCl2, and some polyamines also have activating and protecting effects on menadione reductase. The mode of action of these substances is shown to be unlike that of NaCl but to consist in the alteration of the intermediate form of the enzyme in such a way as to make it more stable and partially active."
https://openalex.org/W1583834749,"Abstract Diisopropylfluorophosphate reacts with mercuripapain, 2,3-dimercaptopropanol-activated mercuripapain, and unactivated native papain with the incorporation of a maximum of 1 mole of phosphate per mole of protein. This alkylphosphorylation does not inhibit the potential activity of mercuripapain but does result in about 50% inhibition of 2,3-dimercaptopropanol-activated mercuripapain. The stoichiometric reactions of diisopropyl-1,3-14C-fluorophosphate and 32P-diisopropylfluorophosphate, respectively, with native and mercuripapain both occur at tyrosyl residue 123, with the formation of an O-diisopropylphosphoryl-l-tyrosyl residue."
https://openalex.org/W1483307970,"An unusual amino acid, γ-glutamylmethylamide, has been found to be an early product of the metabolism of methylamine by Pseudomonas MS. This compound is also synthesized by cell-free extracts of this organism in a reaction which requires ATP and Mn++. The enzyme responsible for the synthesis of γ-glutamylmethylamide is induced by growth on methylamine, dimethylamine, or trimethylamine, but not by growth on glucose, peptone, or trimethylsulfonium nitrate. This suggests that a new enzyme, similar in activity to glutamine synthetase, but having a high specificity for methylamine, is responsible for the synthesis of γ-glutamylmethylamide in Pseudomonas MS. The trivial name γ-glutamylmethylamide synthetase is suggested for this enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1539797078,"Abstract Chymotrypsin (EC 3.4.4.5) hydrolyzes methyl dl-1,2-dihydronaphtho[2,1-b]furancarboxylate (IV) very rapidly and with high d specificity. The isomeric methyl dl-dihydronaphtho[1,2-b]- and -[2,3-b]furan-2-carboxylates are much poorer substrates than IV, and are hydrolyzed with less stereospecificity. The binding site has been mapped to identify areas displaying steric hindrance to binding and areas of a polar and nonpolar nature. The results confirm Niemann's hypothesis that the aromatic binding site in chymotrypsin is approximately planar, elongated, and curved. Methyl N-acetyl-l-3-(1-naphthyl)alaninate (VII) was also found to be a very good substrate, in contrast to its 2-naphthyl analogue, which is about 100 times less reactive than VII. A likely conformation of methyl N-acetyl-l-tryptophanate during hydrolysis at the active site of chymotrypsin is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2152458416,"Abstract The mold Neurospora crassa does not accumulate porphyrins in iron deficiency but instead accumulates the sideramine desferricoprogen. In iron deficiency there is an accumulation of δ-aminolevulinic acid and the δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase level is very low. A similar situation exists in cobalt toxicity and zinc deficiency. The δ-aminolevulinic acid synthetase and ferroprotoporphyrin chelatase comparatively show only marginal changes under these conditions. Addition of iron and zinc to the respective metal-deficient cultures results in an induction of δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase. The induction of δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase is repressed by protoporphyrin and less effectively by hemin and hemoglobin. Iron deficiency, zinc deficiency, and cobalt toxicity have been found to interfere with the conversion of protoporphyrin into heme, thus rendering protoporphyrin available to repress the enzyme. This repression can be counteracted by iron and much more effectively by coprogen. A model has been proposed in which protoporphyrin has been visualized as the corepressor for the enzyme δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase. It is held that iron in the form of coprogen converts protoporphyrin to heme, the latter having a lesser affinity for the aporepressor. Coprogen can inhibit heme binding to the aporepressor and thus render the repressor nonfunctional. This will lead to a derepression of the enzyme δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase."

https://openalex.org/W1647441018,"Abstract The major metabolites found in the urine after administration of 3-hydroxyxanthine-8-14C to rats are 3-hydroxyuric acid, uric acid, xanthine, allantoin, and unchanged starting material. These metabolites can be accounted for by either the oxidizing or the reducing actions of xanthine oxidase and are influenced in vivo by the xanthine oxidase inhibitor, allopurinol. An enzymatic synthesis of 3-hydroxyuric acid is described. Xanthine oxidase activity is observable in the subcutaneous tissues where the compound is oncogenic, but there is no evidence that a xanthine oxidase-induced product is a proximate oncogen."
