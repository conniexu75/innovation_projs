https://openalex.org/W1510793262,"Despite their opposite effects on prolactin secretion, both dopamine and angiotensin II inhibit adenylate cyclase activity in homogenates of anterior pituitary cells in primary culture. Dopamine and angiotensin II inhibition of adenylate cyclase was not additive, suggesting that both neurohormones inhibit the adenylate cyclase of the lactotroph cells. Pretreatment with Bordetella pertussis toxin (islet activator protein) completely suppressed the dopamine-induced inhibition of both adenylate cyclase and prolactin secretion. The islet activator protein also reversed the angiotensin II-induced inhibition of the adenylate cyclase activity. In contrast, angiotensin II stimulation of prolactin release was not affected by the toxin. Angiotensin II also induced a dose-dependent stimulation of inositol phosphates (250%) with an EC50 of 0.1 nM, close to that observed for prolactin secretion. Islet activator protein pretreatment did not block the stimulation of inositol phosphate production. Dopamine inhibited the angiotensin II-stimulated prolactin release and the production of inositol phosphates induced by angiotensin II. It is concluded that angiotensin II and dopamine receptors of lactotroph cells are able to modulate both cAMP and inositol phosphate production. The dopamine receptor of lactotrophs appears to be the first example of a receptor which is negatively coupled to the production of inositol phosphates."
https://openalex.org/W1615050047,"The Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C) of human neutrophils is converted to a proteolytically modified Ca2+/phospholipid-independent form (Inoue, M., Kishimoto, A., Takai, Y.U., and Nishizuka, Y. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 7610-7616) on incubation with neutrophil membranes in the presence of micromolar concentrations of Ca2+ and an endogenous Ca2+-requiring proteinase (Melloni, E., Pontremoli, S., Michetti, M., Sacco, O., Sparatore, B., Salamino, F., and Horecker, B. L. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 82, 6435-6439). We have now demonstrated the appearance of a similar Ca2+/phospholipid-independent kinase in intact human neutrophils stimulated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). The following evidence supports the conclusion that the Ca2+/phospholipid-independent protein kinase recovered from the PMA-treated cells is a proteolytically modified form of the native protein kinase C. 1) In cells exposed to PMA, the rate of disappearance of Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C activity is correlated with the rate of appearance of the Ca2+/phospholipid-independent kinase. 2) The chromatographic behavior of the new protein kinase and its molecular size (approximately 65 kDa) are identical to those previously reported for the proteolytically modified form of protein kinase C. 3) The modified protein kinase no longer binds to the cell membrane and is recovered almost entirely in the cytosol fraction. 4) In neutrophils preloaded with inhibitors of the Ca2+-requiring proteinase, stimulation with PMA results in translocation of protein kinase C from the cytosol fraction to the particulate fraction, but the appearance of the soluble, Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent form is prevented. We conclude that binding of protein kinase C to the plasma membrane and its proteolytic conversion are related, but independent, processes both elicited by exposure of neutrophils to the phorbol ester. Proteolytic cleavage of the membrane-bound protein kinase C provides an alternative mechanism for its activation and may account for certain of the cellular responses observed in PMA-stimulated neutrophils."
https://openalex.org/W1482945966,"The mobilization of stored carbohydrates (sucrose and starch) during sucrose starvation was studied with sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) cells. When sucrose was omitted from the nutrient medium, vacuolar sucrose was first consumed. When a threshold of intracellular sucrose concentration was attained the cytoplasmic phosphorylated compounds decreased whereas cytoplasmic Pi increased symmetrically. Such a situation triggered starch breakdown. When almost all the intracellular sucrose pool had disappeared, the cell respiration rates (normal and uncoupled) declined progressively. The decrease in the rate of respiration triggered by sucrose starvation was attributable neither to the availability of substrate for mitochondrial respiration nor to a decrease in the maximal rate of O2 consumption by mitochondria expressed in terms of nanomole of O2 consumed per min/mg of mitochondrial protein. In fact, the uncoupled respiration rates decreased in parallel with the decrease in total intracellular cardiolipin or cytochrome aa3. These results demonstrate therefore that after a long period of sucrose starvation the progressive decrease in the uncoupled rate of O2 consumption by sycamore cells was attributable to a progressive diminution of the number of mitochondria/cell."
https://openalex.org/W1555057470,"A cDNA library of newborn rat brain poly(A+) RNA in lambda gt 11 was screened with a synthetic oligonucleotide probe corresponding to a five amino acid sequence in the N-terminal region of the calf helix-destabilizing protein, UP1. Six positive phage were isolated after testing 2 X 10(5) recombinants, and each phage was plaque purified. Four of these phage clones were positive with a second oligonucleotide probe corresponding to a 5 amino acid sequence in the C-terminal region of calf UP1; one of the clones positive with both probes was selected for detailed study. This phage, designated lambda HDP-182, contained a 1706-base pair cDNA insert corresponding to an mRNA with a poly(A) sequence at the 3' terminus and a single open reading frame starting 63 bases from the 5' terminus and extending 988 bases. The 3' untranslated region of the mRNA contained 718 bases, including an AAUAAA signal 21 bases from the poly(A) sequence and a 16-residue poly(U) sequence flanked on each side by oligonucleotide repeats. Primer extension analysis of newborn rat brain poly(A+) RNA suggested that the cDNA insert in lambda HDP-182 was full length except for about 35 nucleotide residues missing from the 5' end untranslated region, and Northern blot analysis revealed one relatively abundant mRNA species of approximately the same size as the cDNA insert. The 988-residue open reading frame in the cDNA predicted a 34,215-dalton protein of 320 amino acids. Residues 2 through 196 of this rat protein are identical to the 195-residue sequence of the calf helix-destabilizing protein, UP1. The 124-amino acid sequence in the C-terminal portion of the 34,215-dalton protein is not present in purified calf UP1. This 124-residue sequence has unusual amino acid content in that it is 11% asparagine, 15% serine, and 40% glycine and consists of 16 consecutive oligopeptide repeats. Computer-derived secondary structure predictions for the 34,215-dalton protein revealed two distinct domains consisting of residues 1 through approximately 196 and residues approximately 197 to 320, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1525217085,"Molecular properties of cytosolic Ah receptors from livers of Sprague-Dawley rats and C57BL/6N mice were assessed by velocity sedimentation on sucrose gradients and by gel permeation chromatography on Sephacryl S-300. Analyses were done under conditions of both moderate ionic strength (presence of 0.1 M KCl) and high ionic strength (0.4 M KCl). [3H] 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) was used as the radioligand. In conditions of moderate ionic strength the receptor from Sprague-Dawley rat liver sedimented at 8.8 +/- 0.05 S, had a Stokes radius of 7.0 +/- 0.21 nm, and an apparent relative molecular mass (Mr) of 257,000 +/- 7,700. In conditions of high ionic strength the Ah receptor from rat hepatic cytosol dissociated to a [3H]TCDD-binding subunit which sedimented at 5.6 +/- 0.58 S, had a Stokes radius of 5.2 +/- 0.24 nm, and an apparent Mr of 121,000 +/- 5,600. The Ah receptor from liver of C57BL/6N mice, in moderate ionic strength conditions, sedimented at 9.4 +/- 0.54 S, had a Stokes radius of 7.1 +/- 0.12 nm, and an apparent Mr of 277,000 +/- 4,800. Whereas the Ah receptor from rat liver readily dissociated into a [3H]TCDD-binding subunit during brief exposure to 0.4 M KCl, the mouse Ah receptor resisted dissociation. When exposed to 0.4 M KCl for 2 h, the mouse Ah receptor remained at the same molecular size that it had exhibited in moderate ionic strength conditions. Prolonged exposure (16 h) to 0.4 M KCl prior to analysis partially converted the mouse Ah receptor into a smaller [3H]TCDD-binding subunit which sedimented at 4.9 +/- 0.07 S, had a Stokes radius of 5.2 +/- 0.19 nm, and an apparent Mr of 105,000 +/- 3,800. The potency of seven different Ah receptor agonists in competing with [3H]TCDD for specific receptor sites was slightly different in mouse cytosol than in rat cytosol. By criteria of size, response to high ionic strength environments, and ligand binding preferences the mouse and rat Ah receptors appear to be similar but not identical molecular species."
https://openalex.org/W1525342416,"125I-labeled recombinant murine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was used to characterize receptors specific for this lymphokine on the surface of cells of both myelomonocytic and T-cell origin. GM-CSF binding to these cells was specific and saturable. Equilibrium binding studies revealed that on all cell types examined, GM-CSF bound to a single class of high affinity receptor (1000-5000 receptors/cell) with a Ka of 10(8)-10(9) M-1. More extensive characterization with P388D1 cells showed that binding of GM-CSF was rapid at 37 degrees C with a slow subsequent dissociation rate. Among a panel of lymphokines and growth hormones, only unlabeled natural or recombinant GM-CSF were able to compete for the binding of 125I-GM-CSF to these cells. Affinity cross-linking experiments with the homobifunctional cross-linking reagents disuccinimidyl suberate, disuccinimidyl tartrate, and dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) resulted in the identification of a receptor protein with a Mr of 130,000 on five out of the seven cell types examined. This protein was extremely sensitive to proteolysis and in the absence of protease inhibitors was degraded to a form with an approximate Mr of 70,000. A receptor protein of Mr 180,000, in addition to the Mr 70,000 protein, was found on bone marrow cells and on P815 cells. The potential tissue-specific molecular heterogeneity associated with the GM-CSF receptor may help to explain some of the diverse biological effects associated with this growth and differentiation factor."
https://openalex.org/W1502751289,"The MDA 468 human breast carcinoma cell line was examined for changes in epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor synthesis and degradation under the influence of EGF. This cell line was used because it overexpresses the EGF receptor such that each cell has 10(6) receptors, but unlike the well-studied A431 cell, its receptor gene is amplified but is not rearranged. On exposure to EGF, total cellular receptor protein, measured by immunoprecipitation with monoclonal antibody B1D8, is reduced. The half-life of receptor metabolically labeled with L-[35S]methionine is 24 h in the absence of EGF and is reduced to 12 h in the presence of 10(-9) M EGF. To measure the effect of EGF on synthesis of the receptor, pulse labeling conditions were selected in which the rate of synthesis of the receptor precursor were followed. EGF had no significant effect on the rate of general protein synthesis in these cells, yet stimulated the synthesis of the EGF receptor 1.8-fold over the unstimulated rate. This increase in receptor precursor synthesis showed time and dose dependence. Stimulation could be detected after 3 h exposure to EGF with a maximum at 6-8 h. A concentration of 10(-11) M EGF gave detectable stimulation with maximal stimulation occurring at 10(-9) M. Longer times and higher concentrations gave submaximal stimulation. A similar dose-response relationship was observed when the rate of mature 170-kDa receptor protein synthesis was measured. These studies demonstrate that EGF stimulates the synthesis of it own receptor. Downregulation of the receptor by EGF results from an increased rate of receptor degradation and not decreased synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1490065691,"We have studied the effects of thyrotropin (TSH) on the growth and on the levels of the mRNAs of the cellular proto-oncogenes, c-myc, and c-fos, in the specific target of TSH action, the thyroid follicular cell. FRTL5 cells, a cloned line from normal rat thyroid gland that depends upon TSH for its replication, were maintained in a quiescent state for 5 days by keeping them in a medium devoid of serum or TSH. The addition of bovine TSH (bTSH, 1 nM) increased DNA synthesis and stimulated cell proliferation after a lag period of 24 h. This growth response was anteceded by prompt, but transient, increases in the levels of c-myc and c-fos mRNAs, with peak responses at 60 and 30 min, respectively. The minimally and maximally effective concentrations of bTSH were 0.01 mM and 1.0 nM, respectively. Dibutyryl cAMP (Bt2cAMP) stimulated cell growth and increased the level of c-myc mRNA in a concentration-dependent manner, with maximum effects at a Bt2cAMP concentration of 1 mM. At the single concentration tested (1 mM), Bt2cAMP also increased the level of c-fos mRNA. Hence, bTSH-stimulated mitogenesis in quiescent FRTL5 cells is associated with rapid, but short-lived, increases in the levels of the mRNAs of the proto-oncogenes, c-myc and c-fos. Since bTSH is known to stimulate adenylate cyclase in these cells, and since the effect of TSH on c-myc and c-fos mRNAs is mimicked by Bt2cAMP, it is possible that these responses to bTSH are mediated, at least in part, by cAMP."
https://openalex.org/W1592128802,"The structural and folding requirements of eukaryotic cytochromes c have been investigated by determining the appropriate DNA sequences of a collection of 46 independent cyc 1 missense mutations obtained in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and by deducing the corresponding amino acid replacements that abolish function of iso-1-cytochrome c. A total of 33 different replacements at 19 amino acid positions were uncovered in this and previous studies. Because all of these nonfunctional iso-1-cytochromes c are produced at far below the normal level and because a representative number are labile in vitro, most of the replacements appear to be affecting stability of the protein or heme attachment. By considering the tertiary structure of related cytochromes c, the loss of function of most of the mutant iso-1-cytochromes c could be attributed to either replacements of critical residues that directly interact with the heme group or to replacements that disrupt the proper folding of the protein. The replacements of residues interacting with the heme group include those required for covalent attachment (Cys-19 and Cys-22), ligand formation (His-23 and Met-85), and formation of the immediate heme environment (Leu-37, Tyr-53, Trp-64, and Leu-73). Proper folding of the protein is prevented by replacements of glycine residues at sites that cannot accommodate side chains (Gly-11 and Gly-34); by replacements of residues with proline, which limit the torsion angle (Leu-14 and His-38); and by replacements apparently unable to direct the local folding of the backbone into the proper conformation (Pro-35, Tyr-72, Asn-75, Pro-76, Lys-84, Leu-99, and Leu-103). Even though most of the missense mutations occurred at sites corresponding to evolutionarily invariant or conserved residues, a consideration of the replacements in functional revertants indicates that the requirement for residues evolutionarily preserved is less stringent than commonly assumed."
https://openalex.org/W1560430840,"Type X collagen was cleaved at two sites by a purified human skin collagenase. Two experimental approaches were used to identify the location of the cleavage sites. First, native type X collagen was digested with the enzyme, and the rotary-shadowed products were visualized in the electron microscope. The major collagenase fragment of type X contained the epitope recognized by a monoclonal antibody (X-AC9). The antibody was used as a point of reference to locate the position of the cleavage fragment within the native molecule. Second, the digestion of radiolabeled type X collagen substrates was analyzed by gel electrophoresis. The complete cleavage of type X generated three products with 32-, 18-, and 9-kDa chains. The 32-kDa peptides were present in a triple-helical conformation and demonstrated a midpoint denaturation temperature of 43 degrees C in CD experiments. The 18-kDa peptide contained the tyrosine-rich globular domain of the molecule. The 9-kDa peptide was derived from the triple-helical end of the native molecule. Type X collagen was cleaved more rapidly by the vertebrate collagenase than was type II collagen in in vitro solution studies."
https://openalex.org/W1604105761,"Bovine lung thrombomodulin is purified and used to investigate the basis of the change in substrate specificity of bovine thrombin when bound to thrombomodulin. Bovine thrombomodulin is a single polypeptide having an apparent molecular weight of 84,000 and associates with thrombin with high affinity and rapid equilibrium, to act as a potent cofactor for protein C activation and antagonist of reactions of thrombin with fibrinogen, heparin cofactor 2, and hirudin. Bovine thrombomodulin inhibits the clotting activity of thrombin with Kd less than 2.5 nM. Kinetic analysis of the effect of bovine thrombomodulin on fibrinopeptide A hydrolysis by thrombin indicates competitive inhibition with Kis = 0.5 nM. The active site of thrombin is little perturbed by thrombomodulin, as tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide hydrolysis and inhibition by antithrombin III are unaffected. Insensitivity of the reaction with antithrombin III is likewise observed with thrombin bound to thrombomodulin on intact endothelium. Antithrombin III-heparin, human heparin cofactor 2, and hirudin inhibit thrombin-thrombomodulin more slowly than thrombin. These effects may arise from a decrease in Ki of the inhibitors for thrombin-thrombomodulin or from changes in the active site not detected by tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide or antithrombin III. Bovine prothrombin fragment 2 inhibits thrombin clotting activity (Kd less than 7.5 microM) and acts as a competitive inhibitor of protein C activation (Kis = 2.1 microM). The data are consistent with a mechanism whereby thrombomodulin alters thrombin specificity by either binding to or allosterically altering a site on thrombin distinct from the catalytic center required for binding or steric accommodation of fibrinogen, prothrombin fragment 2, heparin cofactor 2, and hirudin."
https://openalex.org/W1654807885,"Purified membrane-associated phosphatidylinositol synthase (CDP diacylglycerol:myo-inositol 3-phosphatidyltransferase, EC 2.7.8.11) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was reconstituted into unilamellar phospholipid vesicles. Reconstitution of the enzyme was performed by removing detergent from an octylglucoside/phospholipid/Triton X-100/enzyme mixed micelle mixture by Sephadex G-50 superfine column chromatography. The average diameter of the vesicles was 40 nm and chymotrypsin treatment of intact vesicles indicated that over 90% of the reconstituted enzyme had its active site facing outward. The enzymological properties and reaction mechanism of reconstituted phosphatidylinositol synthase were determined in the absence of detergent. The reconstituted enzyme was used as a model system to study the regulation of activity. Phosphatidylinositol synthase was constitutive in wild type cells grown in the presence of water-soluble phospholipid precursors as determined by enzyme activity and immunoblotting. Reconstituted enzyme was not effected by water-soluble phospholipid precursors or nucleotides. Maximum activity was found when the enzyme was reconstituted into phosphatidylcholine: phosphatidylethanolamine: phosphatidylinositol: phosphatidylserine vesicles. Phosphatidylserine stimulated reconstituted activity, suggesting that the local phospholipid environment may regulate phosphatidylinositol synthase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1670731304,"Pathological changes in retinas of diabetics include specific morphological, biochemical, and functional abnormalities. As biochemical manifestations of the disease, increased sorbitol and decreased myo-inositol were found in retinas of experimentally diabetic animals. Similar alterations in polyol metabolism have been associated in nerves of diabetics with a reduction of Na+-K+-ATPase activity. To determine whether this association extends to the retinas of diabetic animals, we applied quantitative histochemical techniques to measure ATPase activities and the amounts of sodium and potassium in samples from nine individual layers of cryostat sections of rabbit retina. ATPase activities were determined fluorimetrically, and the ions were measured by atomic absorption with a carbon rod atomizer. The activity of Na+-K+-ATPase was reduced in the retinal pigmented epithelium (retinal pigment epithelium) and in selected layers of the neural retina, and total sodium in the retinal pigment epithelium layer was elevated in diabetes. The retinal pigment epithelium forms the outer component of the blood-retinal barrier and partly determines the composition of the retinal interstitial fluid. Changes in retinal pigment epithelium biochemistry and function might alter the intraretinal environment, predisposing neural retina or retinal blood vessels to disease. The morphologically and functionally well defined retinal pigment epithelium may provide a useful model for studying the pathogenesis of diabetic complications."
https://openalex.org/W1533388167,"Phorbol ester treatment of isolated rat adipocytes inhibits insulin stimulation of the glucose transport system. We studied whether this effect is related to a modification of the insulin receptor kinase. Insulin receptor of tetradecanoyl-beta-phorbol acetate (TPA)-treated adipocytes was solubilized and partially purified, and its kinase activity was studied in vitro. We found that insulin (10(-7) M) increased the tyrosine autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor kinase from TPA-treated cells only 3-fold in contrast to a 12-fold stimulation in control cells. The rate of insulin-stimulated 32P incorporation into the receptor of TPA-treated cells at insulin concentrations between 10(-10) M and 10(-7) M and at nonsaturating [32P]ATP levels (5 microM) was reduced to only 5-8% of the values found with receptor from control cells. 125I-insulin binding to the solubilized receptor of TPA-treated cells was reduced as well, apparently due to a decreased affinity of the binding site. Decreased binding was however, not sufficient to explain the difference of kinase activity. The inhibition of kinase activity of the receptor from TPA-treated cells decreased when the concentration of [gamma-32P]ATP in the phosphorylation assay was increased. A Lineweaver-Burk analysis of receptor phosphorylation revealed that the Km for ATP of the receptor kinase from TPA-treated cells was increased to greater than 100 microM compared to 25 microM for the receptor of control cells. An analogous change of the Km for ATP was found when we studied the phosphorylation of a synthetic polymer of tyrosine and glutamic acid as a substrate of the receptor kinase. We conclude from the data that phorbol treatment of rat adipocytes modulates the kinase activity of the insulin receptor by increasing its Km for ATP and that this is part of a mechanism leading to insulin resistance in these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1585180155,"Human platelet alpha 2-adrenergic receptors have been purified approximately 80,000-fold to apparent homogeneity by a five-step chromatographic procedure. The overall yield starting from the membranes is approximately 2%. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of radioiodinated protein from purified receptor preparations shows a single major band of Mr 64,000. The specific binding activity of the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor after four chromatographic steps is 14.5 nmol/mg protein. This value is consistent with the expected theoretical specific activity (15.6 nmol/mg) for a protein with a molecular mass of 64,000 daltons if it is assumed that there is one ligand-binding site/receptor molecule. The purified protein can be covalently labeled with the alkylating alpha-adrenergic ligand, [3H]phenoxybenzamine. This labeling is specific, and it shows that the Mr 64,000 protein contains the ligand binding site of the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor. In addition, the competitive binding of ligands to the purified receptor protein shows the proper alpha 2-adrenergic specificity. The alpha 2-adrenergic receptor contains an essential sulfhydryl residue. Thus, exposure of the purified receptor to the sulfhydryl-specific reagent, phenylmercuric chloride, resulted in an 80% loss of binding activity. This loss of binding activity was prevented when exposure to phenylmercuric chloride was done in the presence of alpha 2-adrenergic ligands, and it was reversed by subsequent exposure to dithiothreitol. Partial proteolysis of purified alpha 2-adrenergic receptors was obtained with Staphylococcus aureus V-8 protease, alpha-chymotrypsin, and papain. In a comparison with purified beta 2-adrenergic receptors, no common partial proteolytic products were found."
https://openalex.org/W1506571572,"Previous results have demonstrated that liver membranes possess two distinct lipoprotein receptors: a low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor that binds lipoproteins containing either apolipoprotein (apo-) B or apo-E, and an apo-E-specific receptor that binds apo-E-containing lipoproteins, but not the apo-B-containing LDL. This study reports the isolation and purification of apo-B,E(LDL) and apo-E receptors from canine and human liver membranes. The receptors were solubilized with the zwitterionic detergent 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate and were partially purified by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. The apo-B,E(LDL) receptor was isolated by affinity chromatography on LDL-Sepharose. The apo-E receptor, which did not bind to the LDL-Sepharose column, was then purified by using an HDLc (cholesterol-induced high density lipoprotein)-Sepharose affinity column and an immunoaffinity column. Characterization of the receptors revealed that the hepatic apo-B,E(LDL) receptor is similar to the extrahepatic LDL receptor with an apparent Mr = 130,000 on non-reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The apo-E receptor was found to be distinct from the apo-B,E(LDL) receptor, with an apparent Mr = 56,000. The purified apo-E receptor displayed Ca2+-dependent binding to apo-E-containing lipoproteins and did not bind to LDL or chemically modified apo-E HDLc. Antibodies raised against the apo-B,E(LDL) receptor cross-reacted with the apo-E receptor. However, an antibody prepared against the apo-E receptor did not react with the apo-B,E(LDL) receptor. The apo-E receptor also differed from the apo-B,E(LDL) receptor in amino acid composition, indicating that the apo-E receptor and the apo-B,E(LDL) receptor are two distinct proteins. Immunoblot characterization with anti-apo-E receptor immunoglobulin G indicated that the apo-E receptor is present in the hepatic membranes of man, dogs, rats, and mice and is localized to the rat liver parenchymal cells."
https://openalex.org/W1582554183,"The lipid dependency of apocytochrome c binding to model membranes and of the translocation of the precursor protein across these membranes was studied by using large unilamellar, trypsin-containing vesicles. These vesicles were improved with respect to those used in a previous article (Rietveld, A., and de Kruijff, B. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 6704-6706), in the sense that a lower amount of trypsin was enclosed. In mixed egg phosphatidylcholine/bovine brain phosphatidylserine vesicles, both the Kd of apocytochrome c binding (about 20 microM) and the number of phosphatidylserine molecules interacting with the protein was found to be constant. When the phosphatidylserine fraction in the vesicles is more than 15-30% apocytochrome c addition results in the exposure of (a part of) the protein to the internal, trypsin-containing vesicle medium, which process we conceive as a translocation event. Also the interaction of apocytochrome c with vesicles composed of phosphatidylcholine and another acidic phospholipid in a 1:1 ratio, leads to the translocation of the protein across the model membrane. The affinity of this binding was found to be in the order cardiolipin greater than phosphatidylglycerol greater than phosphatidylinositol greater than phosphatidylserine. By varying the lipid composition of the vesicles, it could be demonstrated that the translocation requires a fluid bilayer. In addition, protein specificity was shown for the translocation process. Although apocytochrome c-lipid interaction causes vesicle aggregation, fusion by lipid mixing could not be detected. Due to the apocytochrome c-lipid interaction also, protein aggregates and oligomers have been formed. These results will be discussed in the light of a model for translocation of a precursor protein across a model membrane. The relevance for the mitochondrial system will also be discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1598909505,"The rates of synthesis of fatty acid synthase and the levels of its mRNA are high in livers of chicks, ducklings, or goslings fed high-carbohydrate mash diets and low in livers of starved birds, indicating pretranslational regulation of fatty acid synthase activity. Determination of the step(s) at which the nutritional state regulates the fatty acid synthase mRNA level was the objective of this study. Total RNA extracted from gosling or duckling liver contains two discrete fatty acid synthase transcripts, one of about 12,200 nucleotides and the other about 10,800 nucleotides. Both mRNAs are transcribed from the same gene because there is only one fatty acid synthase gene/haploid genome. A combination of 1) comparison of restriction fragment lengths in genomic DNA and cloned fatty acid synthase cDNAs, 2) differential hybridization of cloned cDNAs to the two mRNAs, and 3) sequence analysis indicates that the longer mRNA is a 3'-extension of the shorter one. The half-lives for fatty acid synthase mRNAs in fed ducklings and in starved ducklings were estimated from the rate at which mRNA level approached steady state during starvation or refeeding. The amount of fatty acid synthase mRNA in total liver RNA increased rapidly when starved ducklings were fed a high-carbohydrate mash diet, reaching an apparent steady state of 10 times the initial level after 9 h. The kinetics of accumulation suggested a half-life of 4-6 h for fatty acid synthase mRNA in fed ducklings. When fed ducklings were starved, fatty acid synthase mRNA decayed with a half-life of about 3 h. Therefore, the half-life for fatty acid synthase mRNA appeared to be little affected by feeding or starvation. The levels of both mRNAs changed in parallel indicating that half-lives of the two mRNAs were not regulated differentially. Transcription of the fatty acid synthase gene, as measured in isolated nuclei, increased about 10-fold when starved ducklings were refed for 24-30 h. Most of the increase in transcription occurred within 45 min after feeding was initiated. However, when fed ducklings were starved, the initial decrease in fatty acid synthase mRNA level occurred more rapidly than the decrease in transcription of the fatty acid synthase gene, indicating some degree of post-transcriptional regulation. Nevertheless, after 48 h of starvation, both mRNA level and transcription were decreased to the same extent. Nutritional state, therefore, regulates the transcription of two fatty acid synthase mRNAs from a unique gene. In addition, transient regulation occurs at an as yet undefined post-transcriptional step."
https://openalex.org/W1594869814,"The conditioned medium from Sertoli cells contains a potent mitogen(s) that can markedly stimulate the proliferation of 4 different cell lines of endoderm or mesoderm origin in the presence or absence of serum. With A431 cells, conditioned medium produced in a dose-dependent manner up to a 5.2-fold increase in cell number after 5 days in culture. Addition of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), testosterone, retinol, and insulin to the Sertoli cells increased the secretion of the mitogenic activity. The ability of Sertoli cell conditioned medium (SCCM) to displace 125I-labeled epidermal growth factor (125I-EGF) from formalin-fixed A431 cells was also examined. The SCCM from Sertoli cells incubated with insulin contained 1.42 ng eq of EGF/ml; testosterone, retinol, and FSH (in the presence of insulin) further increased the secretion of this EGF competing activity to 2.09, 2.56, and 3.22 ng eq/ml, respectively. The amount of EGF competing activity was positively correlated with mitogenic activity. Separation of SCCM by gel filtration on Bio-Gel P-10 produced three major peaks of EGF-competing activity at apparent Mr = 1800-2100, 3800-4200, and 8000-9500. Chromatographing SCCM (in the presence of protease inhibitors) on size exclusion high performance liquid chromatography revealed two peaks of EGF competing activity at Mr about 8000 and 2000 coincident with and proportional to peaks of mitogenic activity. This activity was heat-sensitive and resistant to reducing agents, and addition of an equivalent amount of EGF as that present in SCCM produced an inhibition in growth of the A431 cells compared to a 3-fold stimulation with SCCM. Thus, the Sertoli cells secrete a potent mitogen that is distinct from EGF and alpha TGF. This factor that we have termed Sertoli cell-secreted growth factor is hormonally regulated by FSH, testosterone, and retinol and may play an important role in controlling spermatogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1571225670,"The human apolipoproteins are secretory proteins some of which have been shown to undergo proteolytic processing and post-translational addition of carbohydrate. Apolipoprotein A-I (apo-A-I), the predominant protein associated with high density lipoproteins, undergoes co-translational proteolytic processing as well as post-translational conversion of proapo-A-I to mature apo-A-I following cellular secretion. Utilizing the human hepatoma cell line HEP-G2, we have established that, in addition to proteolytic processing, secreted nascent apo-A-I is acylated with palmitate. Uniformly labeled [14C]palmitate and [1-14C]palmitate were each incorporated into apo-A-I when analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. The acylation of apo-A-I with palmitate was confirmed by immunoprecipitation and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Hydroxylamine treatment resulted in the deacylation of apo-A-I. Although three of the apo-A-I isoforms analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis were shown to contain radio-labeled palmitate, 80% of acylated apo-A-I was in the proapolipoprotein A-I isoform. [14C]Oleate was not incorporated in secreted apo-A-I, indicating the specificity of the acylation of apo-A-I. Incubation of [14C] palmitate-acylated apo-A-I in serum and plasma under conditions in which proapo-A-I is proteolytically cleaved to mature apo-A-I did not result in deacylation. These data establish that fatty acid acylation occurs in human secretory proteins in addition to the previously reported acylation of cellular membrane proteins. These results suggest that the covalent linkage of lipids to apolipoproteins may play a critical role in apolipoprotein and lipoprotein metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1485965549,"The insulin receptor/kinase was purified to near homogeneity from human placenta. The purified kinase exhibited a specific activity of 300 nmol/min/mg of protein at 30 degrees C using the synthetic peptide, Arg-Arg-Leu-Ile-Glu-Asp-Ala-Glu-Tyr-Ala-Ala-Arg-Gly, as substrate in the presence of insulin. Treatment of the receptor/kinase with dithiothreitol (DTT) reduced insulin binding by 40-50% and also inhibited tyrosine kinase activity. Phosphorylation and activation of the receptor/kinase did not prevent the DTT-induced loss of binding but completely protected it from the deleterious effects of reducing agent on enzymic activity. Analyses of the structure of the receptor/kinase following phosphorylation and treatment with DTT indicated that the class I disulfide bonds were reduced under the conditions employed, but the tetrameric structure of the receptor/kinase was essentially unaltered. These findings indicate that intact class I disulfides are required for insulin binding but are not necessary for maintenance of the preactivated kinase. DTT was also found to enhance the autoactivation of the insulin receptor/kinase and to promote the reversal of the autophosphorylation reaction. Thus disulfide bonds appear to have multiple roles in the function of the insulin receptor/kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1606567685,"The ovarian granulosa cell has recently been shown to be the site of Somatomedin C (Sm-C) production, reception, and action. To further elucidate the relevance of Sm-C to granulosa cell physiology, we have undertaken to study the regulation of its receptor under in vitro conditions using a primary culture of rat granulosa cells. Granulosa cells cultured without treatment for 72 h displayed limited, albeit measurable, specific Sm-C binding. However, continuous treatment with increasing concentrations of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) for the duration of the 72-h incubation period resulted in dose-dependent increments in Sm-C binding (1.7-, 2.9-, 3.9-, and 3.6-fold increases over untreated controls for 50, 100, 180, and 330 ng/ml of FSH, respectively). This apparent up regulatory action of FSH proved time-dependent, with a minimal time requirement of 24-48 h. Granulosa cell Sm-C binding was similarly enhanced following elevation of the intracellular cAMP content by a series of cAMP-generating agonists, inhibition of cAMP-phosphodiesterase activity, or the provision of nondegradable cAMP analogs. Our findings further indicate that high dose forskolin, like FSH, is capable of augmenting Sm-C binding by itself, that a relatively inactive low dose of forskolin synergizes with FSH in this regard, but that combined treatment with maximal stimulatory doses of both agonists does not prove additive. Taken together, these observations indicate that FSH is capable of exerting a stimulatory effect on granulosa cell Sm-C binding and that cAMP, its purported intracellular second messenger, may play an intermediary role in this regard."
https://openalex.org/W1496555824,"Degradation of intracellular proteins via the ubiquitin- and ATP-dependent proteolytic pathway involves several steps. In the initial event, ubiquitin, an abundant 76-residue polypeptide is covalently linked to the protein substrate in an ATP-requiring reaction. Proteins marked by ubiquitin are selectively proteolyzed in a reaction that also requires ATP. Ubiquitin conjugation to proteins appears also to be involved in regulation of cell cycle and cell division, and probably in the regulation of gene expression at the level of chromatin structure. We have previously shown (Ciechanover, A., Wolin, S. L., Steitz, J. A., and Lodish, H. F. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 82, 1341-1345) that transfer RNA is an essential component of the ubiquitin pathway. Ribonucleases strongly and specifically inhibited the degradation of 125I-labeled bovine serum albumin, while tRNA purified from reticulocyte extract could restore the proteolytic activity. Specifically, pure tRNAHis isolated by immunoprecipitation with human autoimmune serum could restore the proteolytic activity. Here we demonstrate that tRNA is required for conjugation of ubiquitin to some but not all proteolytic substrates of the ubiquitin mediated pathway. Conjugation of 125I-labeled ubiquitin to reduced carboxymethylated bovine serum albumin, alpha-lactalbumin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor was strongly and specifically inhibited by ribonucleases. Consequently, the ATP-dependent degradation of these substrates in the cell-free ubiquitin-dependent reticulocyte system was inhibited as well. Addition of tRNA to the ribonuclease inhibited system (following inhibition of the ribonuclease) restored both the conjugation activity and the ubiquitin- and ATP-dependent degradation of these substrates. Conjugation of ubiquitin to some endogenous reticulocyte proteins was also inhibited by ribonucleases and could be restored by the addition of tRNA. In striking contrast, the conjugation of radiolabeled ubiquitin to lysozyme, oxidized RNase A, alpha-casein, and beta-lactoglobulin was not affected by the ribonuclease treatment, and the degradation of these substrates was significantly accelerated by the ribonucleases. These findings indicate that there are at least two distinct ubiquitin conjugation systems. One requires tRNA, and the other is tRNA independent. These pathways, however, must share some common component(s) of the system, since the inhibition of one system accelerates the other. The possible function of tRNA in the selective conjugation reaction and the possible role of the two distinct ubiquitin marking mechanisms are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1503945025,"We have isolated cDNA clones of the mRNA for cytochrome P-450 that catalyzes the steroid C-21 hydroxylation (P-450(C21)), which specifically catalyzes 21-hydroxylation of steroids in the microsomes of bovine adrenal cortex by using synthetic oligonucleotides as probes. Sequence determination of the cloned cDNA showed that it contains 2157 nucleotides and a poly(A) chain and that a single open reading frame of 1488 nucleotides codes for a polypeptide of 496 amino acids with a molecular weight of 56,113. The deduced amino acid composition is in agreement with that determined by direct amino acid analysis of purified P-450(C21) and the predicted primary structure contained amino acid sequences of N-terminal region and two internal tryptic fragments of the protein so far analyzed. Comparing the amino acid sequence with those of other forms of P-450 reveals that a conserved amino acid sequence containing a putative heme-binding cysteine is present in the equivalent position, proximate to the COOH terminus of the molecules and that P-450(C21) is phylogenically situated in an intermediate position between steroidogenic mitochondrial cytochrome P-450 which catalyzes the side-chain cleavage of cholesterol (P-450(SCC)) and drug-metabolizing microsomal P-450s. However, the amino acid sequence of P-450(C21) is much closer to that of drug-metabolizing P-450s than to that of P-450(SCC)."
https://openalex.org/W1500677079,"The insulin receptor from human brain cortex was purified by a combination monoclonal antibody affinity column and a wheat germ agglutinin column. This purified receptor preparation exhibited major protein bands of apparent Mr = 135,000 and 95,000, molecular weights comparable to those for the alpha and beta subunits of the purified human placental and rat liver receptors. A minor protein band of apparent Mr = 120,000 was also observed in the brain receptor preparation. Crosslinking of 125I-insulin to all three receptor preparations was found to preferentially label a protein of apparent Mr = 135,000. In contrast, cross-linking of 125I-labeled insulin-like growth factor I to the brain preparation preferentially labeled the protein of apparent Mr = 120,000. The purified brain insulin receptor was found to be identical with the placental insulin receptor in the amount of neuraminidase-sensitive sialic acid and reaction with three monoclonal antibodies to the beta subunit of the placental receptor. In contrast, a monoclonal antibody to the insulin binding site recognized the placental receptor approximately 300 times better than the brain receptor. These results indicate that the brain insulin receptor differs from the receptor in other tissues and suggests that this difference is not simply due to the amount of sialic acid on the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1535832910,"Treatment of goldfish xanthophores with adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) or cyclic AMP (cAMP) induces the centrifugal movement of their pigment organelles from the center of the cells. Using purified xanthophores pulse labeled with 32Pi, we have shown that the dispersion of the organelles is accompanied by the phosphorylation of a pair of polypeptides, termed p57. After fractionation on sucrose gradients, nearly all of the p57 is found associated with the pigment organelles. The phosphorylation induced by ACTH or cAMP apparently occurs at multiple sites on p57. The minimal effective doses of ACTH or cAMP required to induce full pigment dispersion also fully stimulate the phosphorylation of p57. Increased phosphorylation of p57 is detectable within a minute after stimulating the cells and appears to be near completion during the early phases of pigment dispersion. Upon withdrawal of ACTH, these events are reversed; the pigment organelles reaggregate toward the center of the cells and p57 is dephosphorylated. Again, dephosphorylation commences soon after ACTH is withdrawn and is complete before the organelles have completely reaggregated. These results suggest a novel mechanism for governing the movement of these organelles which acts on the organelles themselves through the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of p57."
https://openalex.org/W1563242569,"In intact goldfish xanthophores, the phosphorylation of a pigment organelle (carotenoid droplet) protein, p57, appears to play an important role in adrenocorticotropin (ACTH)- or cAMP-induced pigment organelle dispersion while the dephosphorylation of this protein upon withdrawal of ACTH or cAMP is implicated in pigment aggregation. In this paper, we report the cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of this protein in cell-free extracts of xanthophores as determined by the incorporation of 32P from [gamma-32P]ATP. As is the case in intact cells, p57 is the predominant protein phosphorylated in the presence of cAMP. The cAMP-dependent protein kinase which phosphorylates p57 is not bound to the isolated organelles but is found in the soluble portion of the cell extracts. Hence, the phosphorylation of p57 requires the carotenoid droplets bearing the substrate, soluble extract containing the kinase, cAMP (half-maximal activation at 0.5 microM), and Mg2+ (optimal at 5 mM or higher). The presence of protein phosphatase(s) in these extracts was shown indirectly by the stimulation of phosphorylation by fluoride. The phosphorylation of p57 does not appear to require a cell-specific kinase as soluble extracts of goldfish dermal nonpigment cells also phosphorylate p57 associated with isolated carotenoid droplets. Furthermore, using a constant amount of carotenoid droplets, a linear relationship was demonstrated between the rate of p57 phosphorylation and the amount of extract present in the assays. These results suggest that p57 is phosphorylated directly by a cAMP-dependent protein kinase and that the activity of this enzyme is important in regulating the intracellular movement of the pigment organelles of the xanthophore."
https://openalex.org/W1587585765,"Pertussis toxin is composed of an enzymatically active A subunit and a binding component (B oligomer). Both the holotoxin and the isolated A subunit have previously been shown to exhibit NAD glycohydrolase activity although the A subunit is more active on a molar basis than the holotoxin. We have investigated the mechanism by which ATP stimulates the activity of this toxin. Since dissociation of pertussis toxin subunits would result in increased NAD glycohydrolase activity, the ability of ATP to promote release of the A subunit from the B oligomer was examined. In the presence of the zwitterionic detergent 3-(3-cholamidopropyldimethyl)-1-ammonio)-propanesulfonate, concentrations of ATP as low as 1 microM promoted subunit dissociation. The concentration of ATP required for release of the A subunit was similar to that required for stimulation of NAD glycohydrolase activity. Both ATP and ADP promoted subunit dissociation and stimulated NAD glycohydrolase activity. In contrast, AMP and adenosine did not alter NAD glycohydrolase activity or affect subunit structure. The ability of ATP to decrease the affinity of the A subunit for the B oligomer may play a role in nucleotide stimulation of pertussis toxin activity."
https://openalex.org/W1564130395,"An inhibitor of mammalian collagenase from bovine scapular cartilage has been purified to homogeneity. The inhibitor, extracted from cartilage using 2 M NaCl, was applied to an A-1.5m gel filtration column. Inhibitor eluted at an apparent Mr of 28,000. Further purification was achieved by ion exchange chromatography, gel filtration, and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. A purification of greater than 1,000-fold was achieved. The inhibitor was judged homogeneous by the appearance of a single band on a silver-stained 15% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel. Reduced inhibitor had an Mr of 27,400, unreduced inhibitor had an Mr of 23,900. NH2-terminal sequence data were obtained for the first 45 residues. The bovine cartilage-derived inhibitor exhibits greater than 65% homology over the first 23 residues with a collagenase inhibitor purified from human skin fibroblasts maintained in cell culture. This is the first demonstration that collagenase inhibitors extracted directly from tissue may be similar to those obtained from culture medium."
https://openalex.org/W1581252989,"Ethanol inhibits opioid peptide binding to the delta-opioid receptor. When neuroblastoma x glioma NG108-15 hybrid cells are grown with 25-200 mM ethanol, opioid receptor density increases up to 2-fold without a change in receptor affinity. Since changes in neurotransmitter receptor density may be important in neuronal adaptations to ethanol, we investigated the underlying mechanisms and functional consequences of this phenomenon. The opiate antagonist, naloxone, also increased opioid receptor number, but produced a smaller effect than ethanol with greater fractional inhibition of binding; long term enhancement of binding by ethanol is therefore not a simple function of acute receptor inhibition. Ethanol did not inhibit receptor down-regulation by etorphine, an opiate agonist, and therefore is not likely to increase receptor expression through interference with tonic down-regulation by endogenous opioid peptides. Ethanol increased opioid receptor expression in NG108-15 cells treated with actinomycin D, but not cycloheximide; hence, normal protein synthesis, but not DNA transcription, may be required for this response. The opioid receptors induced in ethanol-treated cells were subject to normal up-regulation by naloxone, down-regulation by etorphine, and acute inhibition of agonist binding by Na+. Etorphine maximally inhibits cyclic AMP accumulation in NG108-15 cells with only fractional occupancy of opioid receptors. Chronic ethanol exposure increased the receptor reserve for this response, resulting in a 3.5-fold increase in the potency of etorphine for inhibiting phenylisopropyladenosine-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation. Neuronal adaptation to ethanol may involve changes in the density of receptors that regulate cellular levels of cyclic AMP."
https://openalex.org/W1589135378,"Characteristics of Ca2+ uptake were studied in a vesicular preparation of proximal tubule plasma membranes from rabbit kidney and compared with the properties of both membrane-bound and solubilized Ca2+-ATPase activities. Calcium uptake required both ATP and MgCl2 and revealed two kinetic components with respect to Ca2+ concentration requirements, one with a high affinity for Ca2+ (1.8 microM), operative in the range of cytosolic Ca2+ activity, and one with a low affinity for Ca2+ (250 microM) which may become active only at abnormally high cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations. The high- and low-affinity components were stimulated to similar extents by phosphate, and required similar concentrations of ATP (0.6 mM) for half-maximal activity. The amount of membrane-bound phosphoenzyme formed from ATP in the presence of Ca2+ was the same regardless of whether only one or both sites were saturated, suggesting that occupancy of the second Ca2+ binding site accelerates the enzyme turnover. Inhibition of Ca2+ transport by Na+ was reversed by the addition of ouabain or an ATP-regenerating system, indicating that this inhibitory effect of Na+ on Ca2+ uptake may be due to the accumulation of ADP in the medium as a result of Na+ pump activity. Low concentrations of carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone and valinomycin (2.5 and 1 microM, respectively) were without effect on Ca2+ uptake in the presence of phosphate, whereas higher concentrations of the ionophores (200 and 100 microM, respectively) reduced uptake by 60% or more. The calmodulin antagonist 48/80 also reduced Ca2+ uptake with half-maximal effectiveness at 100 micrograms/ml. None of these drugs affected either ATPase activity or the EGTA-induced Ca2+ efflux from preloaded vesicles. The Ca2+ dependence of ATP hydrolysis by the membrane-bound enzyme preparation was similar to that observed for Ca2+ uptake by the vesicles. However, with solubilized enzyme, concentrations of Ca2+ similar to that found in the plasma reduced Ca2+-stimulated ATP hydrolysis to one-half of its maximal rate. This indicates that peritubular Ca2+ may play a role in the regulation of Ca2+ transport across the tubular epithelium. ATP could not be replaced by ITP as a substrate for Ca2+ uptake, and the (Ca2+ + Mg2+)ITPase activity of soluble enzyme was 25-fold lower than in the presence of ATP. This is an indication that the active Ca2+ pumping mechanism in proximal tubules is critically dependent on the nucleoside moiety of the substrate."
https://openalex.org/W2160573567,"Regulation of adenylate cyclase coincident with transformation of chicken embryo fibroblasts by Rous sarcoma virus is manifest as a 10-50% decrease in basal, Mg2+-, and forskolin-stimulated activities; activities elicited by fluoride and guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) are unaltered. The level of the catalytic component of adenylate cyclase, assessed with activated stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding protein (Gs), increases approximately 1.5-fold. The level of the beta subunit common to Gs and the inhibitory regulatory protein assessed by enzyme-linked immunotransfer blotting, increases 2.7-fold. The isoelectric behavior of the beta subunit is unaltered. The amount of radiolabel incorporated into the alpha subunit of Gs (Mr = 45,000) upon incubation of membranes with 32P-labeled NAD and cholera toxin increases 3-fold upon transformation. Detergent extracts prepared from membranes of untransformed and transformed fibroblasts nevertheless exhibit equivalent abilities to reconstitute fluoride-stimulated activities to membranes of the cyc-variant of mouse S49 lymphoma cells. Islet-activating protein catalyzes incorporation of radiolabel from 32P-labeled NAD into 39,000- and 41,000-dalton proteins; the extent of radiolabel incorporation does not change upon transformation. Modest alterations in the isoelectric behaviors of substrates for cholera toxin and islet-activating protein occur."
https://openalex.org/W1566806987,"Studies of Na+ and H+ transport by confluent monolayers of the epithelial cell line LLC-PK1 were performed to verify the presence of a Na+/H+ exchange system. The presence of an outwardly directed H+ gradient produced a large stimulation of Na+ influx measured under net flux conditions. Amiloride (10(-3) M) completely inhibited Na+ influx stimulated by the H+ gradient and part of the Na+ influx measured in the absence of a pH gradient. Half-maximal inhibition of the Na+ influx stimulated by a pH gradient at 143 mM Na was observed at 5 microM amiloride. The presence of an inwardly oriented proton gradient also stimulated Na+ efflux from Na+-loaded cells. The stimulation was completely inhibited by the presence of 10(-3) M amiloride in the washout medium. These results indicate that this system could operate in the opposite direction depending on the orientation of the Na+ and H+ gradient. Incubation in Na+-free medium or in the presence of 10(-3) M ouabain resulted in a dramatic decrease of H+ release from LLC-PK1 cells. This H+ release was largely, although not completely, inhibited by 10(-4) M amiloride. Neither chloride substitution by the impermeable anion isethionate nor incubation in the presence of the ionophore valinomycin in high K+ medium affected Na+ influx by stimulated by a pH gradient. Inhibition of the Na+ influx by amiloride occurred only from the apical side of the monolayer. These results indicate that the Na+/H+ exchange system in LLC-PK1 monolayers is specifically localized in the apical membrane of the epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1499791671,"Irreversible inhibition of Na,K-ATPase and K+-dependent p-nitrophenylphosphatase activities was produced by incubation of purified Na,K-ATPase enzyme with 1-ethyl-3(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EPC). Inhibition was time and [EPC] dependent and displayed first order kinetics with respect to time. The [EPC] to reduce the enzyme velocity by 50% for Na,K-ATPase and phosphatase activities was 1.6 and 2.2 mM, respectively. Analysis of the kinetics of inhibition by EPC indicated that reaction at one site was sufficient to produce inhibition. Inhibition was greatly reduced by the presence of Mg2+, Na+, K+, choline, or Tris (decreasing order of effectiveness); ATP was without effect. This suggests that cation-bound enzyme forms were less reactive with the carbodiimide than free enzyme; ATP-bound enzyme was as reactive. Apparently the cations Na+, Mg2+, Tris, and choline stabilize E1 forms of the enzyme which are different from the E1 form stabilized by ATP. Addition of [14C]glycine ethyl ester (Gly-OEt) resulted in incorporation of radioactivity into both alpha and beta subunits that was dependent upon the presence of EPC, and the incorporation was reduced by the cations which reduced the inhibition due to EPC. Simultaneous addition of Gly-OEt with EPC prevented inhibition, although 14C incorporation still took place. If Gly-OEt addition was delayed the initial inactivation was not affected, but little subsequent inactivation occurred. The protection against inactivation by EPC occurs on the addition of other exogenous nucleophiles, such as aminoethane or ethylenediamine. Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, a more potent hydrophobic carbodiimide inhibitor, shows similar effects; the inhibition due to dicyclohexylcarbodiimide is also prevented by the simultaneous presence of a nucleophile. After treatment with a carbodiimide and exogenous nucleophile the Na,K-ATPase has modified carboxyl residues but is not inhibited. Thus, modification of the cation-protectable carboxyl groups does not by itself cause inhibition. It seems likely that the inhibition of activity due to carbodiimide alone is not due to the modification of a carboxyl group per se but to the formation of an intramolecular bond between the carbodiimide-activated carboxylic acid and an endogenous nucleophile. The formation of such bonds suggests the close juxtaposition of amine and carboxyl groups in the secondary structure of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1540974041,"The structure of the lutropin/choriogonadotropin (LH/CG) receptor of a clonal strain of cultured Leydig tumor cells (designated MA-10) and primary cultures of porcine granulosa cells was studied by cross-linking 125I-labeled derivatives of human CG and ovine LH with bifunctional succinimidyl esters. We show that in both cell types, both subunits of the receptor-bound hormone become cross-linked to a single cellular component of Mr = 106,000, when analyzed in the absence of reducing agents, and of Mr = 83,000 when analyzed in the presence of reducing agents. We also present a detailed investigation on the effects of several collagenase preparations on the structure and some functions of the LH/CG receptor. Our results show that the LH/CG receptor is exquisitively sensitive to degradation by these preparations of collagenase; degradation products can be detected only in the presence of reducing agents; the enzyme(s) responsible for degradation is not collagenase itself, but rather a contaminating enzyme(s), presumably a protease(s); and receptor degradation has little effect on the ability of the cells to bind hormone or to respond with increased steroid biosynthesis. Since normal gonadal cells are usually isolated following dispersion of the tissue with collagenase, our results suggest that these cells are likely to bear a degraded (albeit functional) form of the LH/CG receptor, and thus should not be used in studies dealing with the structure of this receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1541196591,"Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has properties similar to other gluconeogenic fructose-1,6-bisphosphatases, but an unusual characteristic of the yeast enzyme is that it can be phosphorylated in vitro by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Phosphorylation also occurs in vivo, presumably as part of a signalling mechanism for the enzyme's degradation. To probe the structural basis for the phosphorylation of yeast fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, we have developed an improved procedure for the purification of the enzyme and then performed sequence studies with the in vitro-phosphorylated protein as well as with tryptic and chymotryptic peptides containing the phosphorylation site. As a result of these studies, we have determined that yeast fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase has the following 24-residue NH2-terminal amino acid sequence: Pro-Thr-Leu-Val-Asn-Gly-Pro-Arg-Arg-Asp-Ser-Thr-Glu-Gly- Phe-Asp-Thr-Asp-Ile-Ile-Thr-Leu-Pro-Arg. The site of phosphorylation is located at Ser-11 in the above sequence. The amino acid sequence around the site of phosphorylation contains the sequence - Arg-Arg-X-Ser- associated with many of the better substrates of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The sequence of residues 15-24 above is highly homologous with the sequence of residues 6-15 of pig kidney fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, showing 7 out of 10 residues in identical positions. The yeast enzyme, however, has a dissimilar NH2-terminal region which extends beyond the NH2 terminus of mammalian fructose-1,6-bisphosphatases and contains a unique phosphorylation site."
https://openalex.org/W1626150747,"Human erythrocyte ghosts prepared by hemolysis and washing in hypotonic Tris are crenated by salt and divalent cations, but undergo shape change to smooth biconcave discs and stomatocytic forms when incubated with MgATP at 37 degrees C. This is normally accompanied by protein and lipid phosphorylations in which the major phosphate acceptors are the spectrin beta-chain and inositol phospholipids, respectively. The system was manipulated in several ways to demonstrate the independence of ATP-dependent shape change from the major phosphorylation reactions. Salt-extracted membranes incubated with adenosine, an inhibitor of spectrin and phosphatidylinositol kinases, underwent normal shape change despite reductions of greater than 90% in spectrin and phospholipid labeling by [gamma-32P]ATP. ATP-dependent shape change was blocked by vanadate at micromolar concentrations (half-maximal inhibition at less than 1 microM), but vanadate did not inhibit membrane autophosphorylation reactions or turnover of spectrin- or lipid-bound phosphate. Vanadate inhibited part of the ATP hydrolysis that accompanies shape change and is expressed in the presence of ouabain and EGTA. The vanadate-sensitive MgATPase activity was approximately 3 nmol Pi X min-1 X mg of protein-1. The results implicate it in ATP-dependent shape change."
https://openalex.org/W1566114810,"The dihydropyridine receptor-calcium channel complex, prelabeled with (+)-[3H]PN200-110, was solubilized from rat heart membranes with a detergent mixture of digitonin and Triton X-100. The dissociation of (+)-[3H]PN200-110 was slow enough to permit the hydrodynamic characterization of the complex by means of sucrose gradient sedimentation and gel filtration. The hydrodynamic properties of the complex were determined in several detergents, including Tween 80, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid (CHAPS), and digitonin. S20,w values of 12.5, 15.4, and 21.0 S were obtained in sucrose gradients prepared in Tween 80, CHAPS, and digitonin, respectively. A Stokes radius of 86-87 A was obtained in each of the three detergents. Determination of the partial specific volume of the protein-detergent complex in each case revealed that the differences in S20,w values could be explained by the differences in the properties of the bound detergent species. Partial specific volumes of 0.796, 0.730, and 0.730 ml/g, corresponding to molecular weights of 595,000, 540,000, and 740,000 were obtained for the complex in Tween 80, CHAPS, and digitonin, respectively. This indicated that Tween 80 readily exchanged for the solubilizing mixture of digitonin and Triton X-100, whereas CHAPS did not. Detergent exchange with Tween 80 made it possible to determine the fractional contribution of the receptor protein to the molecular weight of the protein-detergent complex. The molecular weight of the dihydropyridine receptor-calcium channel complex was estimated to be 370,000. The protein-detergent complex was found to have a frictional coefficient of 1.39, consistent with a large transmembrane protein."
https://openalex.org/W1604769536,"When human erythroleukemic (K562) cells were incubated with 25 microM trifluoperazine (TFP), a drug that inhibits both calmodulin-dependent and calcium-activated phospholipid-dependent kinases, the number of transferrin receptors detected on the cell surface was reduced to approximately half with no change in the affinity of the remaining surface receptors. Removal of the TFP from the incubation medium reversed the loss of surface receptors and they returned to the cell surface in an apparently synchronous manner. As a result, the number of receptors detected on the cell surface exceeded the original level but later returned to normal. Measurements of the total number of receptors available to transferrin in TFP-treated cells suggested that the lost receptors were not participating in the internalization and recycling pathway but instead were probably trapped at an intracellular location. However, those receptors that remained on the cell surface continued to internalize transferrin and to recycle apotransferrin to the cell surface albeit more slowly than in cells that had not been treated with TFP. Using transferrin that had been labeled with iron-59, it was found that although iron uptake was reduced in line with the diminished number of surface receptors, iron still accumulated within TFP-treated cells, suggesting that in the presence of the drug, transferrin-transferrin receptor complexes continued to migrate through an intracellular compartment that contained a low pH."

Cytochrome c552 is the only hemeprotein we observed in the visible spectrum of intact W3A1 cells that were grown under the same culture conditions used for the protein purifications. Addition of methylamine to whole cells causes an increase in the rate of O2 uptake together with an abrupt reduction of c552. We propose that, in vivo, the electrons from the amine reach the hemeprotein through the dehydrogenase."
https://openalex.org/W1573686500,"Nuclear factor I is a host-coded DNA-binding protein that stimulates initiation of adenovirus DNA replication. To understand the mechanism of action of nuclear factor I, we have constructed, by recombinant DNA techniques, origins of replication in which the adenovirus type 5 nuclear factor I binding site (FIB site) has been replaced by a FIB site isolated from human genomic DNA (Gronostajski, R. M., Nagata, K., and Hurwitz, J. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 81, 4013-4017). Assays of such recombinants for initiation and elongation in vitro showed that nuclear factor I was active only when the FIB site was relatively close to the DNA terminus, i.e. the FIB site was centered at nucleotides 30-36 from the end of the DNA. Nuclear factor I was active in either orientation within this distance range. The presence of one or two additional FIB sites in the downstream region had no effect. The implications of these results for the mechanism of nuclear factor I action are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1509458256,"The yeast mitochondrial promoter comprises a highly conserved nonanucleotide sequence, 5'-ATATAAGTA-3'. Transcription is initiated both in vivo and in vitro at the 3'-terminal A (+1). The G at the -2 position is strictly conserved. The requirement for this nucleotide is established by comparing the in vitro promoter activity of nonanucleotides containing any of the four bases at the -2 position, obtained as synthetic oligonucleotides. Only the synthetic promoter having G at the -2 position exhibits any promoter activity."
https://openalex.org/W288656077,"Smooth muscle phosphatase-I (SMP-I), a protein phosphatase purified from turkey gizzard smooth muscle, is composed of 2 regulatory subunits (Mr = 60,000 and 55,000) and a catalytic subunit (Mr = 38,000). Two other forms of this enzyme have been prepared and characterized. The free catalytic subunit, termed SMP-Ic, was prepared by ethanol treatment of SMP-I, and a form devoid of the 55,000-Da subunit, termed SMP-I2, was prepared by limited tryptic digestion. Exposure of SMP-I to proteases like trypsin and chymotrypsin results in a rapid degradation of the 55,000-Da polypeptide. Degradation of the catalytic subunit is observed only upon prolonged digestion. The 60,000-Da polypeptide appears to be resistant to the action of trypsin and chymotrypsin. SMP-I dephosphorylates myosin light chains but is not active toward intact myosin or heavy meromyosin. However, when the catalytic subunit is dissociated from both regulatory subunits or from the 55,000-Da polypeptide, the enzyme becomes active toward myosin suggesting that the 55,000-Da polypeptide inhibits the activity of the catalytic subunit toward myosin. In addition to alteration of the substrate specificity, the regulatory subunits also modulate the effect of divalent cations, like Mn2+, on the activity of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W123824951,"In the presence of Ca2+, gelsolin forms a very tight, stoichiometric complex with 2 molecules of ADP-G-actin. Removal of free Ca2+ causes the 1:2 complex to dissociate to a 1:1 complex. Gelsolin accelerates the very slow polymerization of ADP-actin, apparently by accelerating the rate of nucleation, but the number concentration of filaments formed is probably less than the gelsolin concentration, indicating that the GA2 complex is not a true nucleus. These results are similar to those obtained for the interaction of gelsolin with ATP-G-actin. Both kinetic and equilibrium measurements demonstrate that the critical concentration of gelsolin-capped ADP-actin filaments (8 microM in 1 mM MgCl2 and 0.2 mM ADP) is the same as for the uncapped filaments, proving that the critical concentration is the same at both ends of the equilibrium polymer in ADP as predicted by theory. The association and dissociation rate constants for the addition of ADP-G-actin at the pointed end of an ADP-F-actin filament are estimated to be 4.6 X 10(4) M-1 s-1 and 0.4 s-1, respectively, about 15-fold lower than the rate constants at the barbed end."
https://openalex.org/W1640783955,"An increase in light scattering (3.5 +/- 0.2%) was observed when pig kidney Na+,K+-ATPase preparations modified with N-[p-(2-benzimidazolyl)phenyl] maleimide were phosphorylated by ATP in the presence of 2 M Na+ with Mg2+ to form ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme (E1P), which had a negative fluorescence intensity (-1.5 +/- 0.3%). Addition of K+ or ouabain to E1P reduced the light scattering to the original level observed in the absence of ATP. Stopped flow measurements showed that the fluorescence change accompanying the E1P formation (t1/2 = 0.1 s) occurred preceding the light-scattering change (t1/2 = 1 s). Oligomycin affected the rate of the scattering increase little, but it diminished the effect of K+ on E1P to reduce the light scattering and increase the fluorescence. The addition of 2 M Na+ to K+-sensitive phosphoenzyme (E2P) immediately decreased the fluorescence (t1/2 = 0.02 s) to form E1P which was followed by a slow increase in the light scattering (t1/2 = 0.25 s). Oligomycin reduced both rates of the above changes accompanying the transition of E2P to E1P. The data suggest the sequential appearance of species of E1P that precede E2P formation during the hydrolysis of ATP."
https://openalex.org/W313743760,"Egg white lysozyme, treated with O-methylisourea to convert lysine to homoarginine residues, was used as a substrate for the ATP-dependent proteolytic pathway in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. Although guanidinated lysozyme was degraded by an ATP-dependent, hemin-sensitive process, ubiquitin conjugates of this protein were present at less than 5% the level of conjugates between ubiquitin and nonguanidinated lysozyme. When lysates were chromatographed on DEAE-cellulose to produce Fractions I and II of (Hershko et al. (1979) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 76, 3107), ubiquitin-depleted Fraction II was capable of degrading nonguanidinated lysozyme, but the degradation of guanidinated lysozyme was markedly reduced or abolished. Glycerol-stabilized Fraction II, on the other hand, supported the degradation of both proteins in an ATP-dependent process stimulated by ubiquitin. The degradation of the two proteins differed, however, in that guanidinated lysozyme was more sensitive to competitive substrates, and higher concentrations of ubiquitin were required for its maximal proteolysis. Despite ubiquitin stimulation of guanidinated lysozyme degradation, only trace amounts of higher molecular weight species of guanidinated lysozyme attributable to ubiquitin conjugation were observed in ubiquitin-supplemented, glycerol-stabilized Fraction II even when special precautions were employed to preserve labile covalent bonds. These results indicate that covalent attachment of ubiquitin to the epsilon-amino group of substrate lysines is not mandatory for ATP-dependent proteolysis in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. The observation that ubiquitin stimulates proteolysis of guanidinated lysozyme, without extensive conjugation to it, suggests that ubiquitin may have essential functions for proteolysis other than direct marking of the protein substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1554173505,"Coupled with the peroxidatic oxidation of ferrocytochrome c under anaerobic conditions, proteoliposomes reconstituted with a purified preparation of bovine heart cytochrome oxidase ejected protons into the external medium with an apparent H+/e- ratio of 0.9. At the same time, protons in the intravesicular space were consumed. Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide significantly inhibited the proton translocation. Cyanide (0.14 mM) completely inhibited both the peroxidase and proton translocating activities. On the contrary, in the presence of 1 mM CO the proton ejection was abolished almost completely, but 50% of the peroxidase activity persisted. This result suggests the operation of multiple mechanisms in the peroxidase reaction and that the CO-sensitive one is coupled to the proton translocation."
https://openalex.org/W1582665253,"Isotope effects of 2.5, 2.1, and 1.0 were measured on the conversion of [3'-3H]ADP, [3'-H]UDP, and [5-3H] UDP to the corresponding 2'-deoxynucleotides by herpes simplex virus type 1 ribonucleotide reductase. These results indicate that the reduction of either purine or pyrimidine nucleotides requires cleavage of the 3' carbon-hydrogen bond of the substrate. The substrate analogs 2'-chloro-2'-deoxyuridine 5'-diphosphate (ClUDP), 2'-deoxy-2'-fluorouridine 5'-diphosphate, and 2'-azido-2'-deoxyuridine 5'-diphosphate were time-dependent inactivators of the herpes simplex virus type 1 ribonucleotide reductase. Incubation of [3'-3H]ClUDP with the enzyme was accompanied by time-dependent release of 3H to the solvent. Reaction of [beta-32P]ClUDP with the reductase resulted in the production of inorganic pyrophosphate. These results are consistent with the enzyme-mediated cleavage of the 3' carbon-hydrogen bond of ClUDP and the subsequent conversion of the nucleotide to 2-methylene-3(2H)furanone, as previously reported with the Escherichia coli ribonucleotide reductase (Harris, G., Ator, M., and Stubbe, J. A. (1984) Biochemistry 23, 5214-5225; Ator, M., and Stubbe, J. A. (1985) Biochemistry 24, 7214-7221)."
