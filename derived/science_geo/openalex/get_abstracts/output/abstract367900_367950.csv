https://openalex.org/W1996630410,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are regulators of myriad cellular events, but evidence for a single miRNA that can efficiently differentiate multipotent stem cells into a specific lineage or regulate direct reprogramming of cells into an alternative cell fate has been elusive. Here we show that miR-145 and miR-143 are co-transcribed in multipotent murine cardiac progenitors before becoming localized to smooth muscle cells, including neural crest stem-cell-derived vascular smooth muscle cells. miR-145 and miR-143 were direct transcriptional targets of serum response factor, myocardin and Nkx2-5 (NK2 transcription factor related, locus 5) and were downregulated in injured or atherosclerotic vessels containing proliferating, less differentiated smooth muscle cells. miR-145 was necessary for myocardin-induced reprogramming of adult fibroblasts into smooth muscle cells and sufficient to induce differentiation of multipotent neural crest stem cells into vascular smooth muscle. Furthermore, miR-145 and miR-143 cooperatively targeted a network of transcription factors, including Klf4 (Kruppel-like factor 4), myocardin and Elk-1 (ELK1, member of ETS oncogene family), to promote differentiation and repress proliferation of smooth muscle cells. These findings demonstrate that miR-145 can direct the smooth muscle fate and that miR-145 and miR-143 function to regulate the quiescent versus proliferative phenotype of smooth muscle cells. Two microRNAs, miR-145 and miR-143, have been shown to be present in multipotent cardiac progenitor cells in the mouse embryo. miR-145 is necessary for myocardin-induced reprogramming of adult fibroblasts into smooth muscle cells, and sufficient to induce differentiation of neural crest stem cells into vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Together, miR-145 and miR-143 target a network of transcription factors to promote differentiation and repress proliferation of smooth muscle cells. These findings provide evidence that miRNAs can act as switches to direct cells to a specific differentiated lineage. In addition, the role of miR-145 and miR-143 in regulating the differentiated versus proliferative phenotype of VSMCs may be relevant in many vascular diseases, as VSMC oscillation between these two states contributes to vascular occlusion. Evidence for a single microRNA (miRNA) that can efficiently differentiate multipotent stem cells into a specific lineage or regulate direct reprogramming of cells into an alternative cell fate has been elusive. Two miRNAs, miR-145 and miR-143, are now shown to be co-transcribed in multipotent cardiac progenitors before becoming localized to smooth muscle cells. miR-145 was found to be necessary for myocardin-induced reprogramming of adult fibroblasts and sufficient to induce differentiation of multipotent neural crest stem cells."

The solutions contained approximately 10 mM of dissolved salts with 0.4 to 0.6% perchlorate (ClO4) by mass leached from each sample. The remaining anions included small concentrations of chloride, bicarbonate, and possibly sulfate. Cations were dominated by Mg2+ and Na+, with small contributions from K+ and Ca2+. A moderately alkaline pH of 7.7 +/- 0.5 was measured, consistent with a carbonate-buffered solution. Samples analyzed from the surface and the excavated boundary of the approximately 5-centimeter-deep ice table showed no significant difference in soluble chemistry."

In this study, selected 2009 A(H1N1) influenza isolates were assessed for their ability to cause disease in mice and ferrets and compared with a contemporary seasonal H1N1 virus for their ability to transmit to na√Øve ferrets through respiratory droplets. In contrast to seasonal influenza H1N1 virus, 2009 A(H1N1) influenza viruses caused increased morbidity, replicated to higher titers in lung tissue, and were recovered from the intestinal tract of intranasally inoculated ferrets. The 2009 A(H1N1) influenza viruses exhibited less efficient respiratory droplet transmission in ferrets in comparison with the highly transmissible phenotype of a seasonal H1N1 virus. Transmission of the 2009 A(H1N1) influenza viruses was further corroborated by characterizing the binding specificity of the viral hemagglutinin to the sialylated glycan receptors (in the human host) by use of dose-dependent direct receptor-binding and human lung tissue-binding assays."
https://openalex.org/W2017348279,"The swine-origin A(H1N1) influenza virus that has emerged in humans in early 2009 has raised concerns about pandemic developments. In a ferret pathogenesis and transmission model, the 2009 A(H1N1) influenza virus was found to be more pathogenic than a seasonal A(H1N1) virus, with more extensive virus replication occurring in the respiratory tract. Replication of seasonal A(H1N1) virus was confined to the nasal cavity of ferrets, but the 2009 A(H1N1) influenza virus also replicated in the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles. Virus shedding was more abundant from the upper respiratory tract for 2009 A(H1N1) influenza virus as compared with seasonal virus, and transmission via aerosol or respiratory droplets was equally efficient. These data suggest that the 2009 A(H1N1) influenza virus has the ability to persist in the human population, potentially with more severe clinical consequences."

The mechanisms that confer this rapid metastatic capacity to lung tumors are unknown. Activation of the canonical WNT/TCF pathway is identified here as a determinant of metastasis to brain and bone during lung adenocarcinoma progression.

Metastasis is an ominous feature of malignant solid tumors, and its natural course varies extensively depending on the type of disease. The tissue and cell of origin of the tumor markedly influence the sites and severity of distant metastasis. Depending on the cancer subtype, metastasis may emerge quickly in multiple organs or in particular organs after a protracted latency period. Breast tumors, for example, undergo dissemination from an early stage (Husemann et al., 2008Husemann Y. Geigl J.B. Schubert F. Musiani P. Meyer M. Burghart E. Forni G. Eils R. Fehm T.

USA. 1999; 96: 4494-4499Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), but metastasis to bones, lungs, brain, or liver may not manifest until years or decades after the diagnosis and removal of the primary tumor (Karrison et al., 1999Karrison T.G.

USA. 2003; 100: 7737-7742Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). This course suggests that disseminated breast cells normally require further malignant evolution to overtly colonize distant organs. This process gives rise to organ-specific metastatic cell populations, which has prompted the identification of organ-specific metastasis genes and functions (Nguyen et al., 2009Nguyen D.X. Bos P.D. Massagu√© J. Metastasis: from dissemination to organ-specific colonization.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 274-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1780) Google Scholar). Metastasis in other types of cancer follows a different course, with rapid spread to multiple organs. A case in point is lung adenocarcinoma, the most common subtype of lung cancer with a high mortality rate (Hoffman et al., 2000Hoffman P.C. Mauer A.M. Vokes E.E. Lung cancer.Lancet. 2000; 355: 479-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Even if diagnosed at an early stage and surgically removed, lung adenocarcinomas can relapse within months, spreading to the lymph nodes, contralateral lung, adrenal glands, the bones, and the brain (Feld et al., 1984Feld R.

Lung adenocarcinoma is a principal source of brain metastasis, due in part to the arterial circulation flowing directly from the lungs to the brain, which pulmonary cancer cells can more easily access (Gaspar, 2004Gaspar L.E. Brain metastases in lung cancer.Expert Rev. Anticancer Ther. 2004; 4: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, Gavrilovic and Posner, 2005Gavrilovic I.T. Posner J.B.

The genes and mechanisms that mediate lung adenocarcinoma metastasis are largely unknown. However, the natural course of this disease suggests the acquisition of mechanisms in lung adenocarcinoma cells that allow the aggressive infiltration and colonization of multiple organs soon after cancer cell dispersion from a primary tumor. This hypothesis led us to consider the involvement of developmental pathways as providers of these functions. By combining genome-wide transcriptional analysis and experimental modeling, we identified the activation of the WNT/TCF pathway as a determinant of lung adenocarcinoma metastatic competence to multiple organ sites. The WNT signaling pathway plays major roles in stem cell biology, organogenesis, tissue homeostasis, and cancer (Clevers, 2006Clevers H. Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in development and disease.Cell. 2006; 127: 469-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4167) Google Scholar, Klaus and Birchmeier, 2008Klaus A. Birchmeier W.

Kaykas A. WNT and beta-catenin signalling: diseases and therapies.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2004; 5: 691-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar). Binding of secreted Wnt ligands to Frizzled and LRP5/6 transmembrane receptors prevents the phosphorylation-dependent polyubiquitination and degradation of the signaling pool of Œ≤-catenin in the cytoplasm. This degradation is initiated by a protein complex including APC (the adenomatous polyposis coli gene product), Axin, and glycogen synthase kinase-3Œ≤ (GSK-3Œ≤) (Clevers, 2006Clevers H. Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in development and disease.Cell. 2006; 127: 469-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4167) Google Scholar, Logan and Nusse, 2004Logan C.Y. Nusse R. The Wnt signaling pathway in development and disease.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 781-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (3969) Google Scholar). Spared from degradation, Œ≤-catenin accumulates in the nucleus and binds to transcription factors of the LEF/TCF (lymphoid enhancer-binding factor and T cell factor) family to regulate gene expression (Arce et al., 2006Arce L. Yokoyama N.N. Waterman M.L. Diversity of LEF/TCF action in development and disease.Oncogene. 2006; 25: 7492-7504Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Mutations that constitutively activate the WNT pathway are frequently involved in colorectal cancer initiation (Clevers, 2006Clevers H.

However, such mutations are infrequent in lung adenocarcinomas (Ding et al., 2008Ding L. Getz G. Wheeler D.A. Mardis E.R. McLellan M.D. Cibulskis K. Sougnez C. Greulich H. Muzny D.M.

Xu Z. Jablons D.M. Wnt signaling in lung cancer.Cancer Lett. 2005; 222: 1-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Prominent tumor-initiating events in lung adenocarcinoma include KRAS and EGFR mutations (Rodenhuis et al., 1988Rodenhuis S. Slebos R.J. Boot A.J. Evers S.G. Mooi W.J. Wagenaar S.S. van Bodegom P.C.

Bell D.W. Settleman J. Haber D.A. Epidermal growth factor receptor mutations in lung cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 169-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (2204) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we found that gene-expression signatures denoting WNT/TCF pathway activity in lung adenocarcinomas are associated with a high rate of relapse to distant sites. In vivo selection of metastatic cells from independent human lung adenocarcinoma lines yields derivatives that harbor a hyperactive WNT/TCF pathway, in association with an enhanced ability to infiltrate and colonize the brain and bones. Using these cells as a model, we provide functional evidence for the involvement of two WNT target genes, the transcription factors HOXB9 and LEF1, as mediators of chemotactic invasion and colony outgrowth. Because of the propensity of lung adenocarcinomas to rapidly metastasize to multiple organs, and the lack of mutations associated with this transition thus far, we undertook the approach of analyzing a clinical cohort of lung adenocarcinomas using gene-expression signatures that denote activation of specific pathways. We utilized gene sets that were responsive to a K-Ras mutation in a mouse model (Sweet-Cordero et al., 2005Sweet-Cordero A. Mukherjee S. Subramanian A. You H. Roix J.J. Ladd-Acosta C. Mesirov J. Golub T.R. Jacks T. An oncogenic KRAS2 expression signature identified by cross-species gene-expression analysis.Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 48-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), to a dominant-negative TCF4 (dnTCF4) in colon cancer cells (van de Wetering et al., 2002van de Wetering M. Sancho E.

Zhang X.H. Wang Q. Nadal C. Gerald W.L. Gomis R.R. Massagu√© J. TGFbeta primes breast tumors for lung metastasis seeding through angiopoietin-like 4.Cell. 2008; 133: 66-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar), or to overexpression of c-Myc, SRC, or E2F3 in human mammary epithelial cells (Bild et al., 2006Bild A.H. Yao G. Chang J.T. Wang Q. Potti A. Chasse D. Joshi M.B. Harpole D. Lancaster J.M. Berchuck A. et al.Oncogenic pathway signatures in human cancers as a guide to targeted therapies.Nature. 2006; 439: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (1554) Google Scholar). We queried gene-expression data on 107 annotated primary lung adenocarcinomas including 65 stage I tumors from patients who had relapsed and who remained disease free (MSKCC set 1, Table S1 available online). In an unsupervised analysis, the TCF4 gene signature identified a distinct subgroup (Figure 1A) with an elevated rate of recurrence to multiple organs (Figure 1B, p = 0.006). The K-Ras, SRC, and E2F3 signatures were not predictive of increased overall metastasis (Figure 1C). The TGF-Œ≤ signature, which is associated with lung relapse in estrogen receptor-negative breast tumors (Padua et al., 2008Padua D. Zhang X.H. Wang Q. Nadal C. Gerald W.L. Gomis R.R. Massagu√© J. TGFbeta primes breast tumors for lung metastasis seeding through angiopoietin-like 4.Cell. 2008; 133: 66-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar) was not specifically associated with lung adenocarcinoma metastasis, whereas the MYC signature was modestly predictive (Figure 1C, p = 0.03). A Œ≤-catenin gene set (Bild et al., 2006Bild A.H. Yao G. Chang J.T. Wang Q. Potti A. Chasse D. Joshi M.B. Harpole D. Lancaster J.M. Berchuck A. et al.Oncogenic pathway signatures in human cancers as a guide to targeted therapies.Nature. 2006; 439: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (1554) Google Scholar) was not associated with relapse (data not shown). This set, however, largely consists of downregulated genes in the absence of Wnt signal, potentially reflecting context-specific Œ≤-catenin functions that are independent of TCF transcription (Gottardi and Gumbiner, 2004Gottardi C.J. Gumbiner B.M. Distinct molecular forms of beta-catenin are targeted to adhesive or transcriptional complexes.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). After statistical correction for multiple comparisons, the TCF4 gene set was the only significant predictor of relapse (Bonferroni correction, p = 0.042). Because TCF4 is a member of the LEF/TCF family of WNT pathway transcriptional effectors (Arce et al., 2006Arce L. Yokoyama N.N. Waterman M.L. Diversity of LEF/TCF action in development and disease.Oncogene. 2006; 25: 7492-7504Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), we postulated that canonical WNT transcriptional activity may distinguish a subset of lung adenocarcinomas with high competence for metastasis. To develop an experimental model for the analysis of lung adenocarcinoma metastasis, we isolated metastatic subpopulations from two human lung cancer cell lines. The H2030 cell line was established from a lymph node of a stage III lung adenocarcinoma patient and harbors a KRASG12C mutation (Phelps et al., 1996Phelps R.M. Johnson B.E. Ihde D.C. Gazdar A.F. Carbone D.P. McClintock P.R. Linnoila R.I. Matthews M.J. Bunn Jr., P.A. Carney D. et al.NCI-Navy Medical Oncology Branch cell line data base.J. Cell. Biochem. Suppl. 1996; 24: 32-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The PC9 line was established from a lymph node of a lung adenocarcinoma patient with an EGFRŒîexon19 mutation (Koizumi et al., 2005Koizumi F. Shimoyama T. Taguchi F. Saijo N. Nishio K. Establishment of a human non-small cell lung cancer cell line resistant to gefitinib.Int. J. Cancer. 2005; 116: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, Sasaki et al., 1991Sasaki Y. Shinkai T. Eguchi K. Tamura T. Ohe Y. Ohmori T. Saijo N. Prediction of the antitumor activity of new platinum analogs based on their ex vivo pharmacodynamics as determined by bioassay.Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1991; 27: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). As these two cell lines were derived from lymph nodes, they provided appropriate systems for the isolation of malignant cells that might harbor multiorgan metastatic competence before adaptation to grow in distant organs. When placed in the arterial circulation of immunodeficient mice by intracardiac inoculation, both cell lines colonized the bones and brain. We extracted tumor cells from the brain and expanded them in culture for two more rounds of in vivo selection (Figure 2A). The resulting BrM3 cell populations consistently demonstrated enriched metastatic activity, as detected by bioluminescence imaging (BLI) and magnetic resonance of the brain or X-ray imaging of the bones (Figure 2B). H2030-BrM3 and PC9-BrM3 cells formed brain metastasis in 100% of animals compared to a 10%‚Äì13% efficiency of the parental lines (Figures 2C and 2D). Although isolated from the brain, the H2030-BrM3 and, to a lesser extent, PC9-BrM3 cells showed an increased ability to colonize the vertebral and limb bones over their starting metastatic potential (Figure 2D). Thus, the ability to metastasize to bone and brain are linked in the BrM3 derivatives. In the bones, PC9-BrM3 and H2030-BrM3 formed osteolytic lesions (Figures 2E and 2F). PC9-BrM3 and H2030-BrM3 cells avidly colonized the cerebrum and cerebellum, forming nodules, as well as smaller invasive lesions with occasional spread into the meninges (Figure 2G and Figure S1A). Invasive metastases in the brain were not angiogenic, but displayed perivascular localization and proliferation (Figure 2H), with gliosis (Figure 2I) and astrocyte proliferation at the invasive edge of metastasis (Figure S1B). Importantly, H2030-BrM3 cells implanted orthotopically in the lung could disseminate to the brain independently of lung and pleural tumor burden (Figure 2J). BrM3 cells did not proliferate faster than their parental populations in monolayer culture, nor were they more resistant to growth factor depletion (Figures S2A and S2B). When implanted with extracellular matrix Matrigel directly into the lungs, H2030-BrM3 cells had an initial growth advantage (Figure 2K, left), whereas PC9-BrM3 cells did not have altered tumorigenic rates compared to their parental counterparts (Figure 2K, right). Similar results were obtained from subcutaneously implanted tumors (data not shown). The advantage of H2030-BrM3 cells is consistent with their enhanced colony-forming ability in Matrigel (see below). However, the subsequent expansion rate of H2030-BrM3 tumors in the lung over 7 weeks was not significantly different from those of the parental line (Figure 2K, left). In sum, these two lung adenocarcinoma models recapitulate salient features of metastasis from lung adenocarcinoma, including the capacity to rapidly disseminate and colonize bone and brain. We analyzed the transcriptome of the parental and BrM3 derivatives under basal cell culture conditions. The PC9-BrM3 transcriptome was significantly enriched for the TCF4 classifier, and the H2030-BrM3 cells showed a detectable albeit not statistically significant enrichment (Figure 3A). To evaluate the overall activity of WNT/TCF pathway in these cell lines, we performed transcriptional reporter assays using the TOP/FOP reporter system (Korinek et al., 1997Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Constitutive transcriptional activation by a beta-catenin-Tcf complex in APC‚àí/‚àí colon carcinoma.Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2846) Google Scholar). The BrM3 cells in both systems showed higher basal TCF transcriptional activity (2-fold and 2.8-fold, respectively) than the corresponding parental lines (Figure 3B). Furthermore, addition of the ligand Wnt3A caused a strong increase in TCF activity in the BrM3 subpopulations, which significantly surpassed the Wnt3a-induced increase in the parental lines (Figure 3B). These results revealed the presence of a deregulated TCF pathway in both metastatic cell populations. Œ≤-catenin is distributed as an abundant membrane associated pool and a free labile pool available for WNT/TCF signaling. The stabilization and nuclear localization of this free pool are necessary for Œ≤-catenin as a coactivator of TCF-dependent transcription (Clevers, 2006Clevers H.

Immunoblotting analysis revealed nuclear accumulation of Œ≤-catenin after Wnt3a treatment in all adenocarcinoma lines (Figure 3C). Notably, both the cytosolic and nuclear/signaling levels of Œ≤-catenin were higher in BrM3 cells than in parental H2030 cells (Figure 3C). Phosphorylation of Œ≤-catenin at Ser33/37 and Thr41 marks the signaling pool for proteosomal degradation (Clevers, 2006Clevers H.

Upon Wnt3A stimulation, Œ≤-catenin was more rapidly dephosphorylated at Ser33/37 and Thr41 in H2030-BrM3 cells, indicating a greater rate of stabilization (Figure 3D). In the PC9 derivatives, Œ≤-catenin was abundant in both parental and BrM3 cells, suggesting the preexistence of a hyperactive WNT pathway (Figure 3C). Dephosphoryation of Ser33/37 and Thr41 in response to Wnt3a was similar in the parental and BrM3 PC9 lines, suggesting that enhanced TCF activity in PC9-BrM3 cells may depend on additional alterations (Figure 3D). Somatic mutations in APC or the Œ≤-catenin gene (CTNNB1) can increase Œ≤-catenin stability and activity in colorectal cancer (Clevers, 2006Clevers H.

Muzny D.M. Morgan M.B. et al.Somatic mutations affect key pathways in lung adenocarcinoma.Nature. 2008; 455: 1069-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (2009) Google Scholar). In BrM3 and parental sets, we sequenced APC, CTNNB1, and 13 additional genes (APC2, AXIN1, AXIN2, GSK3B, STK11, LEF1, TCF7/TCF1, TCF7L1/TCF3, TCF7L2/TCF4, FRZB, SFRP1, SFRP2, and SFRP4) that encode proximal components of the WNT pathway. No mutations were found to be specifically associated with BrM3 populations, except for a silent mutation in SFRP4 (G to A, chromosome 7: 37918251) in H2030-BrM3 cells. qRT-PCR and GeneChip array analysis of 84 WNT pathway-related genes (including those sequenced) revealed a common upregulation of LEF1 in highly metastatic cells (Figures 3E and 3F), with less consistent alteration in the expression of the other genes (data not shown). These results suggest that hyperactivation of WNT/TCF in these metastatic cells is not due to mutations in core components of the WNT pathway but to other alterations that commonly converge on WNT transcriptional effectors. Because the TCF4 signature was obtained from a colon cancer cell line (van de Wetering et al., 2002van de Wetering M. Sancho E. Verweij C. de Lau W. Oving I. Hurlstone A. van der Horn K. Batlle E.

We generated transcriptomic gene sets from Wnt3a-treated versus untreated cells in both the H2030 and PC9 systems, combining the responses in both parental and metastatic derivatives. To obtain a more comprehensive transcriptional readout, we employed approaches based on a correlation coefficient method (Chang et al., 2005Chang H.Y. Nuyten D.S. Sneddon J.B. Hastie T. Tibshirani R. Sorlie T. Dai H. He Y.D. van't Veer L.J. Bartelink H. et al.Robustness, scalability, and integration of a wound-response gene expression signature in predicting breast cancer survival.Proc. Natl.

Cancer Res. 2008; 6: 760-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). With this method, the expression trends of many pathway-associated genes can be converted into a continuous score that avoids arbitrary expression level criteria and is applicable across multiple data sets. When tested in our 107 tumor lung adenocarcinoma cohort, the resulting H2030 and PC9 WNT-responsive gene sets were independently associated with metastatic recurrence to multiple organ sites (Figures S3A and S5B). PC9 and H2030 cells express WNT-responsive genes which only partial overlap. These differences may reflect pathway activation in the context of different tumor developmental histories. To derive a broader WNT/TCF pathway classifier from these two gene sets, we combined probe sets that were regulated by Wnt3a in at least one experimental system with similar expression trends in the other and which were still associated with clinical outcome in MSKCC set 1 (refer to the Experimental Procedures). This yielded a lung cancer WNT gene set (LWS), consisting of 91 probes sets including 81 known genes (Table S2). The LWS displayed improved prediction of metastatic relapse compared to the TCF4 classifier in the initial cohort of primary lung adenocarcinomas (MSKCC set 1, p = 0.001; Figure 4A) and, notably, in an independent lung adenocarcinoma data set (MSKCC set 2, p = 9.6 √ó 10‚àí5; Figure 4A) and among lung adenocarcinomas in a cohort of mixed lung tumors (SMC set, p = 0.0025; Figure 4B). The LWS was associated with recurrence in stage I lung adenocarcinomas (Figure 4C), and did not predict metastasis in squamous lung carcinomas (Figure 4B) or in breast carcinomas (Padua et al., 2008Padua D. Zhang X.H. Wang Q. Nadal C. Gerald W.L. Gomis R.R. Massagu√© J.

Consistent with our model systems, the LWS predicted distant lung adenocarcinoma relapse to both brain and bone (Figures S3C and S3D). Although the H2030-BrM3 or PC9-BrM3 were brain isolates, we were unable to obtain from these cells a common signature that would predict brain relapse with methods that previously revealed organ-specific metastasis signatures (Bos et al., 2009Bos P.D.

https://openalex.org/W2133098474,"The FOXO1 transcription factor orchestrates the regulation of genes involved in the apoptotic response, cell cycle checkpoints, and cellular metabolism. FOXO1 is a putative tumor suppressor, and the expression of this gene is dysregulated in some cancers, including prostate and endometrial cancers. However, the molecular mechanism resulting in aberrant expression of human FOXO1 in cancer cells is poorly understood. We show here that FOXO1 mRNA is down-regulated in breast tumor samples as compared with normal breast tissue. Silencing of the microRNA processing enzymes, Drosha and Dicer, led to an increase in FOXO1 expression. We also identified functional and specific microRNA target sites in the FOXO1 3'-untranslated region for miR-27a, miR-96, and miR-182, microRNAs that have previously been linked to oncogenic transformation. The three microRNAs, miR-27a, miR-96 and miR-182, were observed to be highly expressed in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, in which the level of FOXO1 protein is very low. Antisense inhibitors to each of these microRNAs led to a significant increase in endogenous FOXO1 expression and to a decrease in cell number in a manner that was blocked by FOXO1 siRNA. Overexpression of FOXO1 resulted in decreased cell viability because of inhibition of cell cycle traverse and induction of cell death. We have identified a novel mechanism of FOXO1 regulation, and targeting of FOXO1 by microRNAs may contribute to transformation or maintenance of an oncogenic state in breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2036012609,"AP-1 (activator protein-1) transcription factors, also known as JUN factors, are broadly acting factors regulating many inducible genetic responses. Schraml et al. report a surprising mechanism that expands the biological repertoire of the AP-1 family. They find that the AP-1 transcription factor Batf plays a critical role in the differentiation of IL17-producing T-helper cells. TH17 cells comprise a subset of CD4+ T cells that coordinate the inflammatory response in host defence but are pathogenic in autoimmunity. Here, the AP-1 transcription factor BATF is shown to have a critical role in TH17 cell differentiation, with Batf‚àí/‚àí mice displaying a defect in TH17 differentiation and resistance to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Activator protein 1 (AP-1, also known as JUN) transcription factors are dimers of JUN, FOS, MAF and activating transcription factor (ATF) family proteins characterized by basic region and leucine zipper domains1. Many AP-1 proteins contain defined transcriptional activation domains, but BATF and the closely related BATF3 (refs 2, 3) contain only a basic region and leucine zipper, and are considered to be inhibitors of AP-1 activity3,4,5,6,7,8. Here we show that Batf is required for the differentiation of IL17-producing T helper (TH17) cells9. TH17 cells comprise a CD4+ T-cell subset that coordinates inflammatory responses in host defence but is pathogenic in autoimmunity10,11,12,13. Batf-/- mice have normal TH1 and TH2 differentiation, but show a defect in TH17 differentiation, and are resistant to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Batf-/- T cells fail to induce known factors required for TH17 differentiation, such as RORŒ≥t11 (encoded by Rorc) and the cytokine IL21 (refs 14‚Äì17). Neither the addition of IL21 nor the overexpression of RORŒ≥t fully restores IL17 production in Batf-/- T cells. The Il17 promoter is BATF-responsive, and after TH17 differentiation, BATF binds conserved intergenic elements in the Il17a‚ÄìIl17f locus and to the Il17, Il21 and Il22 (ref. 18) promoters. These results demonstrate that the AP-1 protein BATF has a critical role in TH17 differentiation."

Here we differentiate mouse embryonic stem cells carrying a stella transgenic reporter into putative PGCs in vitro. The Stella(+) cells possess a transcriptional profile similar to embryo-derived PGCs, and like their counterparts in vivo, lose imprints in a time-dependent manner. Using inhibitory RNAs to screen candidate genes for effects on the development of Stella(+) cells in vitro, we discovered that Lin28, a negative regulator of let-7 microRNA processing, is essential for proper PGC development. Furthermore, we show that Blimp1 (also called Prdm1), a let-7 target and a master regulator of PGC specification, can rescue the effect of Lin28 deficiency during PGC development, thereby establishing a mechanism of action for Lin28 during PGC specification. Overexpression of Lin28 promotes formation of Stella(+) cells in vitro and PGCs in chimaeric embryos, and is associated with human germ-cell tumours. The differentiation of putative PGCs from embryonic stem cells in vitro recapitulates the early stages of gamete development in vivo, and provides an accessible system for discovering novel genes involved in germ-cell development and malignancy."

https://openalex.org/W1979395048,"Gaucher disease (GD), the most prevalent lysosomal storage disease, is caused by a deficiency of glucocerebrosidase (GCase). The identification of small molecules acting as agents for enzyme enhancement therapy is an attractive approach for treating different forms of GD. A thermal denaturation assay utilizing wild type GCase was developed to screen a library of 1,040 Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs. Ambroxol (ABX), a drug used to treat airway mucus hypersecretion and hyaline membrane disease in newborns, was identified and found to be a pH-dependent, mixed-type inhibitor of GCase. Its inhibitory activity was maximal at neutral pH, found in the endoplasmic reticulum, and undetectable at the acidic pH of lysosomes. The pH dependence of ABX to bind and stabilize the enzyme was confirmed by monitoring the rate of hydrogen/deuterium exchange at increasing guanidine hydrochloride concentrations. ABX treatment significantly increased N370S and F213I mutant GCase activity and protein levels in GD fibroblasts. These increases were primarily confined to the lysosome-enriched fraction of treated cells, a finding confirmed by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. Additionally, enhancement of GCase activity and a reduction in glucosylceramide storage was verified in ABX-treated GD lymphoblasts (N370S/N370S). Hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry revealed that upon binding of ABX, amino acid segments 243-249, 310-312, and 386-400 near the active site of GCase are stabilized. Consistent with its mixed-type inhibition of GCase, modeling studies indicated that ABX interacts with both active and non-active site residues. Thus, ABX has the biochemical characteristics of a safe and effective enzyme enhancement therapy agent for the treatment of patients with the most common GD genotypes."

Many such organisms survive exposure to the harsh gastric environment (pH 1.5-4) by mounting extreme acid-resistance responses, one of which, the arginine-dependent system of Escherichia coli, has been studied at levels of cellular physiology, molecular genetics and protein biochemistry. This multiprotein system keeps the cytoplasm above pH 5 during acid challenge by continually pumping protons out of the cell using the free energy of arginine decarboxylation. At the heart of the process is a 'virtual proton pump' in the inner membrane, called AdiC, that imports L-arginine from the gastric juice and exports its decarboxylation product agmatine. AdiC belongs to the APC superfamily of membrane proteins, which transports amino acids, polyamines and organic cations in a multitude of biological roles, including delivery of arginine for nitric oxide synthesis, facilitation of insulin release from pancreatic beta-cells, and, when inappropriately overexpressed, provisioning of certain fast-growing neoplastic cells with amino acids. High-resolution structures and detailed transport mechanisms of APC transporters are currently unknown. Here we describe a crystal structure of AdiC at 3.2 A resolution. The protein is captured in an outward-open, substrate-free conformation with transmembrane architecture remarkably similar to that seen in four other families of apparently unrelated transport proteins."

We used gene targeting to generate a knockin mouse that replaces the Klk4 gene sequence, starting at the translation initiation site, with a lacZ reporter gene. Correct targeting of the transgene was confirmed by Southern blot and PCR analyses. Histochemical X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-d-galactopyranoside) staining demonstrated expression of beta-galactosidase in maturation stage ameloblasts. No X-gal staining was observed in secretory stage ameloblasts or in odontoblasts. Retained enamel proteins were observed in the maturation stage enamel of the Klk4 null mouse, but not in the Klk4 heterozygous or wild-type mice. The enamel layer in the Klk4 null mouse was normal in thickness and contained decussating enamel rods but was rapidly abraded following weaning, despite the mice being maintained on soft chow. In function the enamel readily fractured within the initial rod and interrod enamel above the parallel enamel covering the dentino-enamel junction. Despite the lack of Klk4 and the retention of enamel proteins, significant levels of crystal maturation occurred (although delayed), and the enamel achieved a mineral density in some places greater than that detected in bone and dentin. An important finding was that individual enamel crystallites of erupted teeth failed to grow together, interlock, and function as a unit. Instead, individual crystallites seemed to spill out of the enamel when fractured. These results demonstrate that Klk4 is essential for the removal of enamel proteins and the proper maturation of enamel crystals."
https://openalex.org/W2125343901,"Development normally occurs similarly in all individuals within an isogenic population, but mutations often affect the fates of individual organisms differently. This phenomenon, known as partial penetrance, has been observed in diverse developmental systems. However, it remains unclear how the underlying genetic network specifies the set of possible alternative fates and how the relative frequencies of these fates evolve. Here we identify a stochastic cell fate determination process that operates in Bacillus subtilis sporulation mutants and show how it allows genetic control of the penetrance of multiple fates. Mutations in an intercompartmental signalling process generate a set of discrete alternative fates not observed in wild-type cells, including rare formation of two viable 'twin' spores, rather than one within a single cell. By genetically modulating chromosome replication and septation, we can systematically tune the penetrance of each mutant fate. Furthermore, signalling and replication perturbations synergize to significantly increase the penetrance of twin sporulation. These results suggest a potential pathway for developmental evolution between monosporulation and twin sporulation through states of intermediate twin penetrance. Furthermore, time-lapse microscopy of twin sporulation in wild-type Clostridium oceanicum shows a strong resemblance to twin sporulation in these B. subtilis mutants. Together the results suggest that noise can facilitate developmental evolution by enabling the initial expression of discrete morphological traits at low penetrance, and allowing their stabilization by gradual adjustment of genetic parameters."

We confirm that fibrils formed by CsgA and CsgB, the primary curli proteins of Escherichia coli, possess many of the hallmarks typical of amyloid. Moreover we demonstrate that curli fibrils possess the cross-Œ≤ structure that distinguishes protein amyloid. However, solid state NMR experiments indicate that curli structure is not based on an in-register parallel Œ≤-sheet architecture, which is common to many human disease-associated amyloids and the yeast prion amyloids. Solid state NMR and electron microscopy data are consistent with a Œ≤-helix-like structure but are not sufficient to establish such a structure definitively. Interest in amyloid is largely because of its association with many late onset human diseases, including Alzheimer disease (AŒ≤), 2The abbreviations used are:AŒ≤amyloid Œ≤BSAbovine serum albuminTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycineMASmagic angle spinningCTconstant timerfradiofrequencyfpRFDRfinite pulse radiofrequency-driven recouplingRADrf-assisted diffusion. Parkinson disease (Œ±-synuclein), type II diabetes (amylin), and the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (PrP). In each case a particular endogenous protein becomes incorporated into large aggregates known as amyloid, which was originally defined by pathologists as a tissue deposit staining like starch (1Virchow R. C. R. Acad. Sci. 1853; 37: 860-861Google Scholar). However, the term amyloid has come to mean a filamentous protein aggregate with cross-Œ≤ secondary structure (cross-Œ≤ means that the Œ≤-strands that form Œ≤-sheets in the amyloid fibrils run approximately perpendicular to the long axis of the fibril with interstrand hydrogen bonds that run approximately parallel to the long axis) and protease resistance. Morphologically amyloid fibrils may vary in length from tens of nanometers to micrometers and have diameters in the range of 3‚Äì10 nm, although lateral association can produce much larger apparent diameters. amyloid Œ≤ bovine serum albumin N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine magic angle spinning constant time radiofrequency finite pulse radiofrequency-driven recoupling rf-assisted diffusion. Proteins from a variety of organisms can form amyloid both in vitro and in vivo, and the propensity to form amyloid may be a common property of many proteins (2Stefani M. Dobson C.M. J. Mol. Med. 2003; 81: 678-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). In addition to disease-associated amyloids, there are several confirmed cases of functional amyloid (for a review, see Ref. 3Fowler D.M. Koulov A.V. Balch W.E. Kelly J.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 217-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). For example, hydrophobins are amyloid-like proteins that coat the surface of fungal cells, and amyloid fibrils coating fish eggs protect them from dehydration (4Podrabsky J.E. Carpenter J.F. Hand S.C. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2001; 280: R123-R131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Mackay J.P. Matthews J.M. Winefield R.D. Mackay L.G. Haverkamp R.G.

The [Het-s] prion of Podospora anserina is involved in heterokaryon incompatibility, a recognition of non-self reaction believed to be important as a defense against fungal virus infection (6Saupe S.J. Prion. 2007; 1: 110-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Curli are extracellular filamentous structures of Enterobacteriaceae (7Barnhart M.M. Chapman M.R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 131-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar) that are integral to biofilm formation and are the major protein component of the extracellular matrix of these organisms (8Vidal O. Longin R. Prigent-Combaret C. Dorel C. Hooreman M. Lejeune P. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2442-2449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Curli of Escherichia coli are composed of the secreted proteins CsgA and CsgB. The latter is believed to prime the polymerization of the former and anchor the fibrils to the outer membrane (9Wang X. Hammer N.D. Chapman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 21530-21539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Both CsgA and CsgB fibrils are Œ≤-sheet-rich and, like amyloids, stain with the dye Congo red (10Chapman M.R. Robinson L.S. Pinkner J.S. Roth R. Heuser J. Hammar M. Normark S. Hultgren S.J.

Because amyloid fibrils are non-crystalline and insoluble, solution NMR and x-ray crystallography are not directly applicable in structural studies. Solid state NMR and electron spin resonance have both been useful in obtaining constraints on amyloid structures and, in some cases, determining detailed structural information. The disease-associated amyloids formed by AŒ≤, amylin, Œ±-synuclein, and tau along with the infectious amyloids of several yeast prions each have in-register parallel Œ≤-sheet structure (12Antzutkin O.N.

Here we confirm that the fibrils formed in vitro by CsgA and CsgB proteins are amyloids and explore their structure using solid state NMR and electron microscopy. Our results indicate that, unlike the pathogenic amyloids of humans and yeast, CsgA and CsgB amyloids are not in-register parallel Œ≤-sheet structures. Solid state NMR and electron microscopy data are consistent with a Œ≤-helix-like structure but do not establish such a structure definitively. The csgA and csgB genes, with carboxyl-terminally encoded His tags, were cloned into pET101/D (Invitrogen) bacterial expression plasmids (supplemental Table 1). Protein overexpression was performed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) grown in Luria broth at 37 ¬∞C. For single isotope labeling, cells were grown in defined amino acid medium as described previously (17Baxa U. Wickner R.B. Steven A.C. Anderson D.E. Marekov L.N. Yau W.M. Tycko R. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 13149-13162Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 18Shewmaker F. Wickner R.B. Tycko R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 19754-19759Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). For uniform 13C,15N labeling, cells were grown in a defined medium containing the following: 4 g/liter glucose, 0.2 g/liter adenine sulfate, 0.2 g/liter uracil, 0.03 g/liter thiamine, 1.2 g/liter MgSO4, 13 g/liter KH2PO4, 10 g/liter K2HPO4, 9 g/liter Na2HPO4, 2 g/liter NH4Cl, 0.05 g/liter EDTA, 0.06 g/liter FeSO4, 0.06 g/liter CaCl2, 12 mg/liter MnCl2, 8 mg/liter CoCl2, 7 mg/liter ZnSO4, 3 mg/liter CuCl2, 2 mg/liter H3BO3, and 2.5 mg/liter (NH4)6Mo7O24. When the cells reached an A600 of ‚àº0.8, they were harvested and resuspended to twice their original volume in the same medium but with [13C]glucose and 15NH4Cl. Protein expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl Œ≤-d-thiogalactosidase when cell densities reached an A600 of ‚àº0.5‚Äì0.7. Cells were harvested after 3‚Äì4 h of protein induction. CsgA and CsgB were purified similarly. Following protein expression, cell pellets were resuspended in a phosphate buffer (10 mm K2HPO4, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with Roche Applied Science Complete protease inhibitor mixture. The cells were lysed by sonication and then spun at 20,000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in Denaturing Buffer (8 m guanidine, 100 mm NaCl, and 100 mm K2HPO4, pH 8). After 2‚Äì3 days of incubation at room temperature with occasional agitation, the lysate was spun at 30,000 rpm for 20 min. The pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was mixed with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen; 1 ml/liter of culture) and incubated at 4 ¬∞C with mild agitation for ‚àº1 h. The lysate and nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose were poured into a glass column and washed with 10 column volumes of 8.5 m urea, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 160 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole. The protein was eluted with 8 m urea, 50 mm Na2HPO4, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, and 200 mm imidazole. Truncated CsgB(Œî1‚Äì8) was purified the same way except there was no sonication step, and cells were directly lysed in Denaturing Buffer. CsgA and CsgB fibrils were prepared by dialyzing purified protein into 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm EDTA and incubating at room temperature with or without mild agitation for several days. The fibrils are resistant to 8.5 m urea and were sometimes further cleaned of residual contaminants by briefly washing with 5‚Äì6 m urea. For solid state NMR the fibrils were harvested by centrifugation, washed several times with water, and finally lyophilized. Uniformly 13C,15N-labeled CsgA fibrils were rehydrated prior to two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. Suspensions of fibrils of CsgA or CsgB in water were dispensed (100 Œºl; ‚àº1 mg/ml) onto a quartz slide and dried under vacuum. The resulting films were analyzed using a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter as described previously (20McPhie P. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 293: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Soluble bovine serum albumin (BSA) was similarly dried and analyzed as a control. A thioflavin-T fluorescence assay was performed using a Photon Technology International QuantaMaster fluorometer as described previously (21Kryndushkin D.S. Shewmaker F. Wickner R.B. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2725-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Soluble BSA and fibrils of CsgB(Œî1‚Äì8) and Ure2p were dispensed into a quartz cuvette to a final concentration 10 Œºg/ml (800-Œºl final volume). The assay was performed in 200 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, and 0.01 mg/ml thioflavin-T (filtered) with constant stirring at room temperature with a fluorescence excitation of 420 nm. Comparative proteolysis was performed by incubating 20 ng of Proteinase K with 10 Œºg of soluble or fibrous CsgA for 0, 5, 10, and 20 min. Reactions were performed in 125 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 0.8 m urea at room temperature in a total volume of 20 Œºl. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 100 Œºl of 88% formic acid, which also serves to depolymerize CsgA fibrils for subsequent gel electrophoresis (22Collinson S.K. Em√∂dy L. M√ºller K.H. Trust T.J. Kay W.W. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4773-4781Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The samples were lyophilized, then resuspended in 8 m urea and 2% SDS, and heated for 3 min at 72 ¬∞C. The samples were evaluated by SDS-PAGE using a 10‚Äì20% Tricine gel. CsgA and CsgB fibrils were washed extensively with water, lyophilized, and packed into a 0.7-mm-diameter, thin walled, boron-rich glass capillary by centrifugation. The samples were placed in an x-ray beam (0.15418 nm) generated by a rotating anode source operated at 50 kV and 100 mA coupled with a multilayer focusing optic. Diffraction data were collected in 20-min exposures during which the samples were continuously rotated around an axis perpendicular to the beam. Diffraction data were recorded on an RaxisIV two-dimensional imaging plate detector placed 15 cm from the capillary. Background data were collected similarly but exposing a part of the same capillary that was free of fibers. The data were converted to intensity versus 2Œ∏ plots by circular summation around the center of the two-dimensional images using the R-axis Display Program (Rigaku Americas). The backgrounds were subtracted, and the resulting plots were displayed by Origin 7 (OriginLab). Aqueous suspensions of curli fibrils were applied to carbon-coated copper grids, incubated for 2‚Äì3 min, briefly washed with water, and stained with 1‚Äì2% uranyl acetate for 2‚Äì3 min. Grids were then blotted and air-dried. Electron micrographs were produced with an FEI Co. Morgagni transmission electron microscope operating at 80 kV. For electron diffraction, aqueous suspensions of CsgB fibrils were applied to carbon-coated copper grids and washed several times with water. The diffraction from the protein fibrils is sensitive to damage caused by the electron beam, so regions on the grid with CsgB fibrils were found under low magnification with low electron beam intensity prior to diffraction imaging. Immediately after diffraction imaging, regular images were taken to confirm the region used for diffraction. All electron diffraction images were taken with an 80-kV electron beam and 350-mm camera length. The diffraction distances were calibrated with the diffraction rings of thallous chloride (Electron Microscopy Sciences) under the same microscope conditions. Single crystals of molybdenum oxide (MoO3; Electron Microscopy Sciences) were used to measure the rotation between regular images and diffraction images. Also MoO3 crystals were used to confirm that the electron beam does not shift between regular and diffraction imaging by comparison of regular and defocused diffraction images under the measurement conditions. Solid state NMR experiments with carbonyl-labeled samples were performed at room temperature at 9.39 teslas (100.4-MHz 13C NMR frequency) with an InfinityPlus spectrometer (Varian, Palo Alto, Ca). Lyophilized CsgA fibrils were packed into 3.2-mm-diameter magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR rotors. Measurements were performed with Varian MAS NMR probes. For certain measurements, the fibrils were rehydrated by addition of water in the rotor. Previous solid state NMR measurements on amyloid fibrils have shown that lyophilization does not disrupt amyloid structures and that rehydration of lyophilized samples leads to solid state NMR spectra with sharp lines that are indistinguishable from spectra of fully hydrated samples that had not been lyophilized (17Baxa U.

Biol. 2004; 335: 247-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The PITHIRDS-CT technique (25Tycko R. J. Chem. Phys. 2007; 126Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) was used to measure intermolecular 13C-13C magnetic dipole-dipole couplings in carbonyl-labeled samples. These couplings depend on intermolecular distances as 1/R3. Experimental conditions were the same as in earlier PITHIRDS-CT measurements on various amyloid fibrils (19Wickner R.B. Dyda F. Tycko R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 2403-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 26Paravastu A.K. Leapman R.D. Yau W.M. Tycko R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Raw PITHIRDS-CT data were corrected for contributions from the 1.1% natural abundance 13C at all carbonyl positions, assuming the 17% carbonyl signal decay observed in PITHIRDS-CT measurements on an unlabeled CsgA sample. Differences in T2 decays between naturally occurring 13C and 13C labels were small (supplemental Fig. 3B) but were included in the correction for relative contribution by using the relative signals remaining following a period equal to the constant time period of the PITHIRDS-CT experiment. Two-dimensional NMR spectra of uniformly 15N,13C-labeled CsgA fibrils were obtained at 14.1 teslas (150.7-MHz 13C NMR frequency) with MAS at 13.50 kHz. Approximately 2 mg of lyophilized fibrils were loaded into a 3.2-mm MAS rotor and rehydrated with Teflon spacers to keep the sample centered in the radiofrequency (rf) coil of the NMR probe. Two-dimensional 13C-13C spectra were obtained with either finite pulse radiofrequency-driven recoupling (fpRFDR) (28Balbach J.J. Ishii Y. Antzutkin O.N. Leapman R.D. Rizzo N.W. Dyda F. Reed J. Tycko R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13748-13759Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 29Ishii Y. Balbach J.J. Tycko R. Chem.

Soc. 2004; 126: 7196-7197Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 31Takegoshi K. Nakamura S. Terao T. Chem. Phys. Lett. 2001; 344: 631-637Crossref Scopus (791) Google Scholar) in the mixing period between t1 and t2 periods. In fpRFDR experiments, the mixing period was 2.37 ms, 13C œÄ pulses were 20.0 Œºs, and proton decoupling fields were 105 kHz. In RAD experiments, the mixing period was 200 ms with a 6.75-kHz proton rf field. Total experiment times were 44 h for the two-dimensional fpRFDR spectrum and 112 h for the two-dimensional RAD spectrum. Two-dimensional 15N-13C spectra were obtained with mixing periods comprising a 5-ms 15N-13C cross-polarization period (‚àº31-kHz 15N rf field and 18-kHz 13C rf field) followed by a 13C-13C polarization transfer period under fpRFDR. For the two-dimensional 15N-13CŒ±/13CX spectrum, the 13C carrier frequency was centered in the 13CŒ± region during 15N-13C cross-polarization. The fpRFDR period was 2.37 ms with 25.0-Œºs 13C œÄ pulses and with the carrier frequency centered in the aliphatic region. For the two-dimensional 15N-13CO/13CX spectrum, the 13C carrier frequency was centered in the 13CO region during 15N-13C cross-polarization. The fpRFDR period was 2.37 ms with 10.0-Œºs 13C œÄ pulses and with the carrier frequency centered between 13CO and 13CŒ± signals. Total experiment times were 12 h for the two-dimensional 15N-13CŒ±/13CX spectrum and 15 h for the two-dimensional 15N-13CO/13CX spectrum. Both spectra were acquired with 32 t1 points and a 96.0-Œºs t1 increment. Spectra with longer t1 periods showed only a minor improvement in resolution in the 15N dimension at the expense of signal to noise. Milligram quantities of CsgA were obtained using pET101/D in E. coli BL21(DE3) (see ‚ÄúExperimental Procedures‚Äù). Amino-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometry showed that purified CsgA lacked its signal peptide and otherwise had the expected mass (Fig. 1). After CsgA samples were removed from denaturing conditions and incubated in non-denaturing buffer, small fibrils formed within 1 day, and then larger filamentous networks formed over subsequent days as observed by electron microscopy (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. 1). This time course of fibril formation corroborates previous observations of purified CsgA (32Wang X. Smith D.R. Jones J.W. Chapman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3713-3719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Also the in vitro prepared CsgA fibrils required formic acid for depolymerization prior to SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B) as observed previously for curli derived directly from E. coli (10Chapman M.R. Robinson L.S. Pinkner J.S. Roth R. Heuser J. Hammar M. Normark S. Hultgren S.J. Science. 2002; 295: 851-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). CsgA fibrils prepared in vitro possessed the physical characteristics typical of amyloid. Fibrils were examined by x-ray diffraction, which indicated a primary atomic spacing of ‚àº4.7 ‚Ñ´ and an additional spacing of ‚àº9 ‚Ñ´ (Fig. 2A). These two spacings are common for amyloid and are interpreted, respectively, as the distance between Œ≤-strands within Œ≤-sheets and the distance between layers of Œ≤-sheets. Solid state circular dichroism spectroscopy was performed on CsgA fibrils (Fig. 2B). This method provides details of structural composition while bypassing the problems associated with fibrillar samples that form macroscopic aggregates (20McPhie P. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 293: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The circular dichroism spectrum of CsgA fibrils, especially the negative ellipticity peak at 218 nm, is characteristic of protein with a high degree of Œ≤-sheet structure. Also relative to soluble CsgA, fibrillar CsgA exhibited markedly higher resistance to limited Proteinase K exposure as is typical of amyloid fibrils (Fig. 2C). Previously a recombinant and truncated CsgB protein was shown to form amyloid-like fibrils in vitro (9Wang X. Hammer N.D. Chapman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 21530-21539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), but attempts to purify the full-length protein were reported to be unsuccessful. We attempted the same strategies reported above for CsgA to produce full-length CsgB. Two csgB constructs were made (Fig. 3A): one coding the entire open reading frame and another beginning at the second methionine residue (CsgB(Œî1‚Äì8)) with the presumption that the export signal would be disrupted and the protein could be more easily purified from a cell lysate. Each construct yielded proteins with the correct approximate mass as determined by electrophoresis (Fig. 3B), and the truncated signal sequence did disrupt secretion as judged by plating cells on Congo red indicator plates (supplemental Fig. 2). The full-length csgB construct yielded two species of slight mass difference, which we assume to be the result of imperfect post-translational processing using this expression system. Like CsgA, both CsgB proteins formed fibrils very quickly after removal from denaturing conditions (Fig. 3, C and D). Moreover the fibrils displayed detergent and urea insensitivity but could be depolymerized with formic acid (Fig. 3B). Fibrils formed by CsgB also have the properties of amyloid. The fluorescent dye thioflavin-T is commonly used to report amyloid formation. When CsgB fibrils were mixed with thioflavin-T, the characteristic increase in fluorescence intensity was observed (Fig. 4A). Likewise solid state circular dichroism spectroscopy yielded a spectrum consistent with high Œ≤-sheet content (Fig. 4B), and x-ray diffraction of CsgB fibrils also yielded the distinctive spacings (‚àº4.7 and ‚àº9 ‚Ñ´) of amyloid (Fig. 4C). However, high Œ≤-sheet content alone does not mean a protein aggregate is amyloid. Rather the cross-Œ≤ structure, in which Œ≤-sheets are oriented such that the Œ≤-strands run perpendicular to the long axis of the fibril, is the structural hallmark of amyloid. Strong x-ray diffraction of non-aligned samples may indicate cross-Œ≤ structure, but diffraction from aligned fibrils is more definitive. To this end, electron diffraction can be used to obtain such directional information about amyloid secondary structure (33Baxa U. Cheng N. Winkler D.C. Chiu T.K. Davies D.R. Sharma D. Inouye H. Kirschner D.A. Wickner R.B. Steven A.C. J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 150: 170-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 34Serpell L.C. Berriman J. Jakes R. Goedert M. Crowther R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 4897-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). The electron diffraction pattern of CsgB fibrillar aggregates on electron microscope grids shows the distinctive 4.7-‚Ñ´ atomic spacing of Œ≤-sheet (Fig. 5A). Moreover regions in which the CsgB fibrils are preferentially aligned in the same direction yield asymmetrical electron diffraction patterns indicative of repeated spacing of about 4.7 ‚Ñ´ along the long axis of the fibrils (Fig. 5B) that is the signature of cross-Œ≤ structure. A single slice extending from the center of the electron diffractogram indicates an increase in intensity at about 4.7 ‚Ñ´ (Fig. 5C). The angular dependence of the diffraction intensity around the diffraction ring shows local maxima and minima corresponding, respectively, to the diffraction parallel and perpendicular to the direction of fibril alignment (Fig. 5D), indicating that the 4.7-‚Ñ´ spacing is along the axis of the fibrils.FIGURE 5.Electron diffraction with fibrils of CsgB. A, non-aligned CsgB fibrils yield an ‚àº4.7-‚Ñ´ electron diffraction pattern (left image) from the region inside the dashed circle on the regular electron microscope image (right image). B, CsgB fibrils in the dashed circle show a similar orientation along the vertical direction (indicated with 0¬∞ arrow) and produce the diffraction pattern shown in the inset. The arrow in the diffraction inset indicates the corresponding orientation on the diffraction pattern.

D, angular dependence of the diffraction ring of B (integrated from 4.6 to 4.8 ‚Ñ´ with 20¬∞ angular bins). The peak at 180¬∞ and minima at 90¬∞ and 270¬∞ indicate that the ‚àº4.7-‚Ñ´ distance is along the axis of the fibrils (cross-Œ≤ structure).

Q. Rev. Biophys. 2006; 39: 1-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). For solid state NMR experiments, CsgA fibrils were prepared with 13C isotope labels at all of the carbonyl positions of leucine (6 residues), phenylalanine (3 residues), or valine (8 residues). These residues are relatively evenly distributed throughout the CsgA amino acid sequence as underlined in Fig. 1A. In addition, roughly 1.9 natural abundance 13C nuclei per CsgA molecule are distributed randomly at backbone or side chain carbonyl and carboxyl sites. The one-dimensional 13C MAS NMR spectra of lyophilized samples are presented in Fig. 6 along with dashed lines that indicate the frequencies of the respective residues when in random coil secondary structure (36Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Holm A. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1419) Google Scholar) (two-component Gaussian fits of the spectra with chemical shifts and relative contributions are presented in supplemental Fig. 3A and supplemental Table 2). In the spectrum of leucine-labeled CsgA fibrils, the carbonyl 13C signal is asymmetric with the major component centered at 172.8 ppm (Fig. 6A). The random coil value for a leucine carbonyl is 175.9 ppm, and negative deviations from this value are indicative of Œ≤-strand secondary structure (37Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 311-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar). For the valine-labeled sample, the carbonyl 13C signal is more symmetric with a peak at 172.5 ppm, which is in the range typical of Œ≤-strand secondary structure (Fig. 6C). For the phenylalanine-labeled sample, the carbonyl 13C signal is split with maxima at 174.2 and 173.1 ppm. In the spectrum of unlabeled CsgA fibrils, the carbonyl peak is centered at 172.2 ppm (Fig. 6E), which is lower than the predicted random coil frequencies for the constituent CsgA amino acids, confirming the general Œ≤-sheet character of the fibrils. Spectra in Fig. 6, A and B, suggest that certain leucine and phenylalanine residues may be in non-Œ≤-strand segments in CsgA fibrils. Data for uniformly 15N,13C-labeled CsgA fibrils described below also indicated non-Œ≤-strand conformations at certain residues. CsgB was similarly labeled at the carbonyl position of its tyrosine residues. The 13C carbonyl signal is centered at 172.8 ppm (Fig. 6D), which is shifted from the random coil value in the direction of Œ≤-sheet structure. However, the signal is broad and suggests that the 6 tyrosine residues may be distributed into different structural environments. PITHIRDS-CT measurements (25Tycko R. J. Chem. Phys. 2007; 126Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) were performed on the 13C carbonyl"

Although AKAPs have been recently shown to bind adenylyl cyclase (AC), the functional significance of this association has not been studied. In cardiac myocytes, the muscle protein kinase A-anchoring protein Œ≤ (mAKAPŒ≤) coordinates cAMP-dependent, calcium, and MAP kinase pathways and is important for cellular hypertrophy. We now show that mAKAPŒ≤ selectively binds type 5 AC in the heart and that mAKAPŒ≤-associated AC activity is absent in AC5 knock-out hearts. Consistent with its known inhibition by PKA phosphorylation, AC5 is inhibited by association with mAKAPŒ≤-PKA complexes. AC5 binds to a unique N-terminal site on mAKAP-(245‚Äì340), and expression of this peptide disrupts endogenous mAKAPŒ≤-AC association. Accordingly, disruption of mAKAPŒ≤-AC5 complexes in neonatal cardiac myocytes results in increased cAMP and hypertrophy in the absence of agonist stimulation.

Because mAKAPŒ≤ forms a complex with two cAMP effectors and a metabolizing enzyme for cAMP, we considered whether AC might also be an integral part of the mAKAPŒ≤ complex. We now demonstrate that type 5 adenylyl cyclase (AC5) binds directly a unique N-terminal site on mAKAPŒ≤ and is the predominant AC isoform associated with mAKAPŒ≤ in the heart. We show that AC5 bound to mAKAPŒ≤ is inhibited by PKA-dependent negative feedback. Importantly, inhibition of endogenous mAKAPŒ≤-AC5 binding revealed the functional importance of these complexes for the regulation of cAMP-dependent myocyte hypertrophy. Antibodies were obtained as described under supplemental methods. The mAKAPŒ≤ isoform is identical to residues 245‚Äì2314 of mAKAPŒ±. Thus, all mutants are numbered according to mAKAPŒ±. The mammalian expression plasmids for wild type and ŒîPKA (deletion of residues 2053‚Äì2073) mAKAPŒ≤ are as previously described (4.Pare G.C. Bauman A.L. McHenry M. Michel J.J. Dodge-Kafka K.L.

Encoded proteins are expressed in a doxycycline-inhibited manner when co-infected with adenovirus that constitutively express the tetracycline-controlled transactivator (tTA). All other expression vectors for AC isoforms and/or AKAP79 are described in supplemental methods. Frozen adult rat hearts (Pel-Freez Biologicals) or AC5+/+ and AC5‚àí/‚àí mouse hearts (generously provided by Kirk Hammond) were thawed in phosphate-buffered saline with protease inhibitors. The hearts were rinsed, diced, and homogenized with a polytron in lysis buffer lacking detergent. After addition of 1.0% Triton X-100, the extracts were further homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm to remove the insoluble fraction. For competition experiments, GST fusion proteins were added to the final homogenization step. The extracts were used immediately for experiments. For immunoprecipitations, extracts were incubated with 10 Œºl of serum and 20 Œºl of protein G-agarose for 3 h at 4 ¬∞C. The beads were washed twice with buffer containing 0.05% lubrol before measurement of AC activity as described in detail in the on-line supplement (6.Piggott L.A. Bauman A.L. Scott J.D. Dessauer C.W.

Cardiac myocytes or transfected COS-7 cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% C12E9, protease inhibitors). Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation, and an aliquot was removed to measure AC activity in the starting lysates. The clarified extracts were then subjected to immunoprecipitation followed by an AC assay upon addition of 50 nm GŒ±s-GTPŒ≥S and 100 Œºm forskolin, as detailed in the on-line supplement and previously described (6.Piggott L.A.

Glutathione-agarose (30 Œºl of packed resin) was added for an additional 2 h. Samples were washed three times with wash buffer and assayed for AC activity directly on the resin as described in the on-line supplement (14.Dessauer C.W. Chen-Goodspeed M. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28823-28829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Ventricular myocytes (over 90% free of fibroblasts) were prepared from 2‚Äì3-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats, as previously described (8.Kapiloff M.S. Schillace R.V. Westphal A.M. Scott J.D. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2725-2736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Adenoviral infection, immunocytochemistry, and [3H]leucine incorporation were performed as described in the on-line supplement. All data are expressed as means ¬± S.E. of the mean. Each n represents the results of individual experiments using separate primary cultures. p values were calculated using a two-tailed, paired Student's t test. To test whether AC associates with mAKAPŒ≤, protein complexes were immunoprecipitated from adult rat heart extracts using multiple mAKAP antisera and were assayed for AC activity (IP-AC assay) (Fig. 1A). AC activity associated with each mAKAP sera was 3-fold greater than the respective preimmune control sera, representing 1.5 ¬± 0.8% of the total AC activity in heart extracts. IP-AC assays using rat neonatal ventricular myocytes confirmed the association of AC and mAKAPŒ≤ in the heart (Fig. 1B). mAKAP antiserum precipitated 10 ¬± 3% of the total AC activity in cardiac myocytes. In cardiac myocytes, nesprin-1Œ± anchors mAKAPŒ≤ at the nuclear envelope (15.Pare G.C. Easlick J.L. Mislow J.M. McNally E.M. Kapiloff M.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 303: 388-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). AC was also immunoprecipitated from adult rat heart extract with a nesprin-1 antiserum (Fig. 1A). Detection of mAKAPŒ≤ and nesprin-1Œ± in the mAKAP and nesprin-1 immunoprecipitates served as controls (supplemental Fig. S1). To determine whether AC association with nesprin-1Œ± was direct or indirect through mAKAPŒ≤, we expressed mAKAP-(585‚Äì1286) in cultured neonatal myocytes (Fig. 2A) to competitively inhibit endogenous mAKAPŒ≤-nesprin-1Œ± binding (15.Pare G.C. Easlick J.L. Mislow J.M. McNally E.M. Kapiloff M.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 303: 388-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). AC activity associated with nesprin-1 co-immunoprecipitation was blocked by expression of mAKAP-(586‚Äì1286), but not by a Œ≤-galactosidase (Œ≤-gal) control (Fig. 1C). Thus, AC associates with mAKAPŒ≤ bound to nesprin-1Œ± at the cardiac myocyte nuclear envelope. AC5 and AC6 are the most abundant AC isoforms in cardiac myocytes (16.Katsushika S. Chen L. Kawabe J. Nilakantan R. Halnon N.J. Homcy C.J. Ishikawa Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 8774-8778Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 17.Ishikawa Y. Katsushika S. Chen L. Halnon N.J. Kawabe J. Homcy C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13553-13557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the lack of suitable, isoform-specific AC antibodies, we determined which AC isoforms bound mAKAPŒ≤ by co-expressing ACs and Myc-tagged mAKAPŒ≤ in COS-7 cells. AC5 and AC2 were significantly enriched in Œ±-Myc immunoprecipitates (8-fold and 3-fold, respectively, over control, Fig. 1D, left panel). In contrast, AC6 and AC1 were not significantly associated with Myc-mAKAPŒ≤ (Fig. 1D, left panel and data not shown). The total AC activity in COS-7 cell extracts confirmed that each AC isoform was expressed 6‚Äì15-fold over background (Fig. 1D, right panel). IP-AC assay of mAKAPŒ≤ immunoprecipitates from wild type (AC5+/+) and AC5 knock-out (AC5‚àí/‚àí) mouse hearts demonstrated that AC5 is the major mAKAPŒ≤-binding AC isoform in native tissue (Fig. 1E). We mapped the mAKAPŒ≤ site that binds endogenous AC by expressing Myc-tagged mAKAP fragments in neonatal myocytes and performing an IP-AC assay (Fig. 2A). AC activity was only associated with wild-type mAKAPŒ≤ (WTŒ≤) and mAKAP-(245‚Äì587) (Fig. 2B). Further mapping was accomplished by GST-pull-down assays using rat heart extracts and GST-mAKAP fusion proteins (Fig. 2, C and D). AC activity was consistently precipitated with mAKAP fragments that contained residues 275‚Äì340. The overlapping fusion protein GST-mAKAP-(1‚Äì300) also was able to precipitate AC activity to a lesser degree (Fig. 2D). To confirm that mAKAP-(275‚Äì340) was sufficient for binding AC, GST fusion proteins were used as competitive inhibitors in IP-AC assays using heart extracts. Both GST-mAKAP-(245‚Äì340) and -(275‚Äì340) fully inhibited endogenous AC-mAKAPŒ≤ binding, whereas GST alone had no effect (Fig. 2E). AC5 contains three cytosolic domains that could interact with mAKAPŒ≤, the divergent N-terminal (NT) and the conserved C1 and C2 domains (Fig. 3A) (18.Sadana R. Dessauer C.W. Neurosignals. 2009; 17: 5-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). GST fusions of the three cytosolic AC5 domains were used to pull-down mAKAPŒ≤ from cell lysates. Independently, each AC domain weakly pulled down mAKAPŒ≤ (data not shown). Therefore, we tested binding to mAKAP with a complex of all three AC5 domains. The presence of His6-tagged C1 and C2 domains increased mAKAPŒ≤ pull-down by GST-5NT (Fig. 3B). The AC5-mAKAPŒ≤ interaction appears to be direct, as GST-mAKAP-(275‚Äì340) and -(245‚Äì340) pulled down purified His6-tagged C1 and C2 domains in the presence of forskolin (Fig. 3C). AKAP79, but not Yotiao, can also bind AC5 (5.Bauman A.L. Soughayer J. Nguyen B.T. Willoughby D. Carnegie G.K. Wong W. Hoshi N. Langeberg L.K. Cooper D.M. Dessauer C.W. Scott J.D. Mol.

U.S.A. 2008; 105: 13835-13840Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To determine whether mAKAPŒ≤ and AKAP79 contact common sites on AC5, we tested whether GST-mAKAP-(245‚Äì340) would competitively inhibit AKAP79-AC5 binding. Although GST-mAKAP-(245‚Äì340) competed with endogenous mAKAPŒ≤ binding to AC in heart extracts (Fig. 2E) and binds AC5 directly (Fig. 3C), it was unable to inhibit AKAP79-AC5 interactions (supplemental Fig. S2). To detect any effect of mAKAPŒ≤ association on AC5 activity, membranes isolated from COS-7 cells overexpressing AC5 and/or mAKAPŒ≤ were assayed for AC activity. AC5 was inhibited by 32 or 48% upon stimulation with GŒ±s or GŒ±s plus forskolin, respectively (Fig. 4A). The inhibition of AC5 by mAKAPŒ≤ did not appear to be a direct consequence of protein binding since addition of GST-tagged mAKAP-(275‚Äì340) or -(245‚Äì340) to AC5-containing membranes had no effect on AC5 activity and expression of Myc-AC-BD had no effect on AC activity in the absence of mAKAP (data not shown). Inhibition of AC5 by mAKAPŒ≤ was not due to altered AC5 protein levels (Fig. 4C). Instead, the inhibition of AC5 by mAKAPŒ≤ depended on PKA association with the complex. Expression of a mAKAPŒ≤ mutant unable to bind PKA (mAKAP ŒîPKA (4.Pare G.C. Bauman A.L. McHenry M. Michel J.J. Dodge-Kafka K.L. Kapiloff M.S. J.

AC2 is not inhibited by PKA phosphorylation and was not inhibited by co-expression with mAKAPŒ≤ (data not shown).

Given that mAKAPŒ≤ inhibited AC5 activity (Fig. 4), we hypothesized that disruption of mAKAPŒ≤-AC5 complexes in cardiac myocytes would enhance AC5 activity and affect myocyte hypertrophy. Therefore, we expressed Myc-AC-BD in cultured rat neonatal ventricular myocytes using a conditional adenovirus system (Fig. 5). Expression of Myc-AC-BD competitively inhibited endogenous mAKAPŒ≤-AC binding in myocytes as measured by IP-AC assay (Fig. 5A), similar to the competition observed for GST-mAKAP-(245‚Äì340) in heart extracts (Fig. 2E). Interestingly, Myc-AC-BD not only displaced AC from endogenous mAKAPŒ≤, but also increased total cAMP levels in myocytes (Fig. 5B). Unstimulated myocytes expressing Myc-AC-BD contained 2.7-fold greater cAMP than myocytes expressing Œ≤-gal (5.0 ¬± 1.3 versus 1.8 ¬± 1.0 attomol/cell) and 2.4-fold greater cAMP upon acute, maximal stimulation with the adrenergic agonist norepinephrine (NE, 10 Œºm) (11.2 ¬± 2.3 versus 4.6 ¬± 2.5 attomol/cell). Thus, mAKAPŒ≤ serves to constrain cAMP levels in myocytes. Elevated cAMP signaling is known to promote cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Because disruption of the AC5-mAKAPŒ≤ complex leads to increased cAMP, we tested whether increased AC5 activity would affect myocyte morphology. Myocytes were infected with adenovirus expressing Œ≤-gal (Fig. 5C, panels a and b) or Myc-AC-BD (panels c and d) for 2 days in the absence (panels a and c) or presence (panels b and d) of NE. Consistent with the increase in cAMP levels (Fig. 5B), unstimulated cells expressing Myc-AC-BD were 24 ¬± 6% larger in cross-section area than cells expressing Œ≤-gal (Fig. 5D). Additionally, the larger cells exhibited greater myofibrillar organization, a characteristic of myocyte hypertrophy (Fig. 5C, panel C, green). As a separate control, addition of doxycycline, which inhibits protein expression in this conditional adenoviral system, abolished any difference between Myc-AC-BD and Œ≤-gal (data not shown). Similar results were obtained by expression of GFP-tagged mAKAP-(275‚Äì340) in transiently transfected myocytes (data not shown). Finally, total protein synthesis was measured as an additional marker for cardiac hypertrophy. [3H]leucine incorporation into newly synthesized protein was 34 ¬± 6% greater in unstimulated myocytes expressing myc-AC-BD compared with Œ≤-gal control (Fig. 5E). Although Myc-AC-BD expression increased total cAMP levels in myocytes, expression of the peptide did not result in further NE-induced myocyte hypertrophy, consistent with prior observations that NE stimulation of both Œ±- and Œ≤-adrenergic receptors results in near maximal myocyte growth in vitro (24.Deng X.F. Rokosh D.G. Simpson P.C. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that AC binds directly to mAKAPŒ≤ in cardiac myocytes, establishing mAKAPŒ≤ as the first identified AKAP to bind directly all of the components required for cAMP signaling, including enzymes for cAMP synthesis (AC), downstream signaling (PKA), and degradation (PDE4D3). (Epac1 binds mAKAPŒ≤ indirectly though PDE4D3 (11.Dodge-Kafka K.L. Soughayer J. Pare G.C. Carlisle Michel J.J. Langeberg L.K. Kapiloff M.S. Scott J.D. Nature. 2005; 437: 574-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar).) AC binding does not appear to compete with the other components of mAKAP complexes for which binding sites have been mapped, as AC (275‚Äì340), nesprin-1Œ± (1065‚Äì1286) (4.Pare G.C. Bauman A.L.

AC types 2 and 5 can bind mAKAPŒ≤, although the predominant complex found in the heart is mAKAPŒ≤-AC5 (Fig. 1). AC2 binding to mAKAP may be relevant in brain or skeletal muscle where mAKAPŒ± or mAKAPŒ≤ are expressed, respectively. A very different pattern of specificity was detected for Yotiao, such that ACs 1, 2, 3, and 9, but not ACs 4, 5, and 6 bound this AKAP (5.Bauman A.L. Soughayer J. Nguyen B.T. Willoughby D.

Bauman A.L. Scott J.D. Dessauer C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 13835-13840Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The N terminus of AC2 has previously been identified as the site of interaction with Yotiao (6.Piggott L.A. Bauman A.L. Scott J.D. Dessauer C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 13835-13840Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar); similarly, the N terminus of AC5 contributes to its increased binding affinity to mAKAPŒ≤ (Fig. 3B). Thus, interactions with non-conserved AC N termini may be a common theme for selective assembly of AKAP-AC complexes. Moreover, we show that multiple domains of AC5 (NT, C1, and C2) bind mAKAPŒ≤, as observed for other AC regulators, including GŒ≤Œ≥, GŒ±s, and calmodulin (18.Sadana R. Dessauer C.W. Neurosignals. 2009; 17: 5-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). mAKAPŒ≤ and nesprin-1Œ± co-localize at the cardiac myocyte nuclear envelope, and significant AC activity was associated with mAKAPŒ≤ and indirectly with nesprin-1Œ± (Fig. 1) (15.Pare G.C. Easlick J.L. Mislow J.M. McNally E.M. Kapiloff M.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 303: 388-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In the cardiac myocyte, the plasma membrane has many invaginations (the transverse tubular system) that bring it adjacent to the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and presumably to the outer nuclear membrane with which the SR is continuous. AC5 has been detected on the cell surface and membranes of transverse tubules (25.Gao T. Puri T.S. Gerhardstein B.L. Chien A.J. Green R.D. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19401-19407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). There have also been reports of ‚Äúfunctional‚Äù membrane-bound AC5 at the nuclear envelope (26.Boivin B. Lavoie C. Vaniotis G. Baragli A. Villeneuve L.R. Ethier N. Trieu P. Allen B.G. H√©bert T.E.

Exp. Ther. 1995; 274: 1513-1523PubMed Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry suggests that cAMP increases at numerous sites within cardiac myocytes including membranes associated with tubules, nuclear envelope, and sarcoplasmic reticulum (28.Yamamoto S. Kawamura K. James T.N. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1998; 40: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Furthermore, numerous G protein-coupled receptors are also targeted to the perinuclear region including Œ≤-adrenergic and prostaglandin receptors (reviewed in Ref. 29.Boivin B. Vaniotis G. Allen B.G. H√©bert T.E. J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 2008; 28: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Thus, the mAKAPŒ≤ scaffold may organize a novel, localized cAMP signaling complex at the nuclear envelope. AC5, but not AC6, has been associated with pathologic remodeling. Disruption of the AC5 gene attenuated the normal inotropic response to sympathetic stimulation (30.Okumura S. Kawabe J. Yatani A. Takagi G. Lee M.C. Hong C. Liu J. Takagi I. Sadoshima J. Vatner D.E. Vatner S.F. Ishikawa Y. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 364-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and prevented the development of heart failure following thoracic aortic banding (23.Okumura S. Takagi G. Kawabe J. Yang G. Lee M.C. Hong C. Liu J. Vatner D.E. Sadoshima J. Vatner S.F. Ishikawa Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 9986-9990Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Moreover, AC5-null mice are protected against age-induced cardiomyopathy, including cardiac hypertrophy, apoptosis, and fibrosis (21.Yan L. Vatner D.E. O'Connor J.P. Ivessa A. Ge H. Chen W. Hirotani S. Ishikawa Y. Sadoshima J. Vatner S.F. Cell. 2007; 130: 247-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The binding of AC5 to mAKAPŒ≤ is consistent with evidence that mAKAPŒ≤ complexes transduce hypertrophic cAMP signaling in cardiac myocytes. Studies using mAKAPŒ≤ RNAi showed a requirement for PKA-bound mAKAPŒ≤ expression in adrenergic-stimulated neonatal myocyte hypertrophy in culture (4.Pare G.C. Bauman A.L. McHenry M. Michel J.J. Dodge-Kafka K.L. Kapiloff M.S. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5637-5646Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and the hypertrophic signaling enzymes calcineurin AŒ≤ and ERK5 are both associated with mAKAPŒ≤ complexes (4.Pare G.C. Bauman A.L. McHenry M. Michel J.J. Dodge-Kafka K.L. Kapiloff M.S. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5637-5646Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 11.Dodge-Kafka K.L. Soughayer J. Pare G.C. Carlisle Michel J.J. Langeberg L.K. Kapiloff M.S. Scott J.D. Nature. 2005; 437: 574-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that mAKAPŒ≤ serves an additional function in the regulation of myocyte hypertrophy through the attenuation of AC5 activity by PKA feedback inhibition. Experiments using membranes containing AC5 and mAKAPŒ≤ performed in the presence of phosphatase and phosphodiesterase inhibitors revealed the importance of PKA associated with the complex to AC5 inhibition (Fig. 4). Accordingly, expression in myocytes of the mAKAPŒ≤ AC-binding domain disrupted endogenous AC-mAKAPŒ≤ complexes and increased total cAMP, resulting in increased cell size and protein synthesis in the absence of extracellular stimulation. Inhibition of AC5-mAKAPŒ≤ binding should also dissociate AC5 from PDE4D3 in the complex, which would otherwise oppose cAMP accumulation. In our model (Fig. 6), mAKAPŒ≤ is poised to balance cAMP production and degradation. Thus, assembly of the mAKAPŒ≤ complex may confer high fidelity, compartmentalized cAMP signaling to prevent cAMP overload, while facilitating selective activation of cAMP targets in response to receptor stimulation. In addition to revealing a novel aspect of cAMP regulation, our results also suggest a potential new strategy for the therapeutic manipulation of cAMP levels in vivo. While chronic stimulation of AC5 may be deleterious to the heart, acute elevation of AC5 activity may be, nevertheless, desirable in the maintenance of cardiac contractility during decompensation (31.Tepe N.M. Liggett S.B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 236-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The results obtained by mAKAPŒ≤ AC-BD overexpression suggest a potential mechanism by which to increase cAMP by targeting the interaction of ACs with AKAPs. In conclusion, we show for the first time that the anchoring of AC to an AKAP complex is required for the control of cAMP-dependent physiological events. This may represent a general paradigm for localized cAMP signaling and opens up a new chapter in cAMP signaling and regulation. We thank Kathryn Hassell for technical assistance and Drs. Tong Tang and Kirk Hammond for supplying AC5 wild type and KO hearts. Download .pdf (.27 MB) Help with pdf files"
https://openalex.org/W2060396426,"Biogenic Amine Receptors Biogenic amines have important effects on behavior in humans and other animals. These agents can act by binding to heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide‚Äìbinding protein (G protein)‚Äìcoupled receptors, but can also activate ligand-gated ion channels. Ringstad et al. (p. 96 ) explored the family of ion channels that respond to biogenic amines in the worm Caenorhabditis elegans and characterized two family members that appear to function as chloride channels. One was a receptor activated by dopamine that could bind drugs used in humans as antipsychotics. The other was activated by tyramine and was shown in genetic studies to modulate behavior. Thus, the worm family of biogenic amine‚Äìactivated channels is larger than previously recognized. If the same is true in humans, related channels may account, in part, for effects of currently used drugs or could be beneficial targets for development of therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W1986500959,"Recent molecular studies indicate that aerobic glycolysis plays an important role in tumorigenesis and is a valid target for cancer therapy. Although 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) is well characterized as a glycolytic inhibitor, we recently discovered that it activates a prosurvival oncoprotein, AKT, through PI3K. In this study, we discovered that 2-DG treatments disrupted the binding between insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and IGF-binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) so that the free form of IGF-1 could be released from the IGF-1.IGFBP3 complex to activate IGF-1 receptor (IGF1R) signaling. Because IGF1R signaling is involved, PI3K/AKT constitutes only one of the prosurvival pathways that are activated by 2-DG treatment; we validated that MEK-ERK signaling was also induced in an IGF1R-dependent manner in some cancer cell lines. Furthermore, our phospho-specific antibody microarray analysis indicated that 2-DG up-regulated the phosphorylation of 64 sites within various signaling pathways in H460 cells. Chemical inhibition of IGF1R reduced 57 of these up-regulations. These data suggest that 2-DG-induced activation of many survival pathways can be jointly attenuated through IGF1R inhibition. Our in vitro analysis demonstrated that treatment with a combination of subtoxic doses of 2-DG and the IGF1R inhibitor II reduced cancer cell proliferation 90% and promoted significant apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1966572549,"Collagen XVII is a transmembrane collagen and the major autoantigen of the autoimmune skin blistering disease bullous pemphigoid. Collagen XVII is proteolytically released from the membrane, and the pathogenic epitope harbors the cleavage site for its ectodomain shedding, suggesting that proteolysis has an important role in regulating the function of collagen XVII in skin homeostasis. Previous studies identified ADAMs 9, 10, and 17 as candidate collagen XVII sheddases and suggested that ADAM17 is a major sheddase. Here we show that ADAM17 only indirectly affects collagen XVII shedding and that ADAMs 9 and 10 are the most prominent collagen XVII sheddases in primary keratinocytes because (a) collagen XVII shedding was not stimulated by phorbol esters, known activators of ADAM17, (b) constitutive and calcium influx-stimulated shedding was sensitive to the ADAM10-selective inhibitor GI254023X and was strongly reduced in Adam10(-/-) cells, (c) there was a 55% decrease in constitutive collagen XVII ectodomain shedding from Adam9(-/-) keratinocytes, and (d) H(2)O(2) enhanced ADAM9 expression and stimulated collagen XVII shedding in skin and keratinocytes of wild type mice but not of Adam9(-/-) mice. We conclude that ADAM9 and ADAM10 can both contribute to collagen XVII shedding in skin with an enhanced relative contribution of ADAM9 in the presence of reactive oxygen species. These results provide critical new insights into the identity and regulation of the major sheddases for collagen XVII in keratinocytes and skin and have implications for the treatment of blistering diseases of the skin."
https://openalex.org/W2071660679,"It has been proposed that ligand occupancy of integrin alphavbeta3 with extracellular matrix ligands (e.g. vitronectin) plays a critical role in insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling. We found that expression of alphavbeta3 enhanced IGF-1-induced proliferation of Chinese hamster ovary cells in serum-free conditions (in the absence of vitronectin). We hypothesized that the direct integrin binding to IGF-1 may play a role in IGF-1 signaling. We demonstrated that alphavbeta3 specifically and directly bound to IGF-1 in cell adhesion, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-type binding, and surface plasmon resonance studies. We localized the amino acid residues of IGF-1 that are critical for integrin binding by docking simulation and mutagenesis. We found that mutating two Arg residues at positions 36 and 37 in the C-domain of IGF-1 to Glu (the R36E/R37E mutation) effectively reduced integrin binding. Interestingly, although the mutant still bound to IGF1R, it was defective in inducing IGF1R phosphorylation, AKT and ERK1/2 activation, and cell proliferation. Furthermore wild type IGF-1 mediated co-precipitation of alphavbeta3 and IGF1R, whereas the R36E/R37E mutant did not, suggesting that IGF-1 mediates the interaction between alphavbeta3 and IGF1R. These results suggest that the direct binding to IGF-1 to integrin alphavbeta3 plays a role in IGF-1 signaling through ternary complex formation (alphavbeta3-IGF-IGF1R), and integrin-IGF-1 interaction is a novel target for drug discovery."
https://openalex.org/W2006764470,"Collagen serves as a structural scaffold and a barrier between tissues, and thus collagen catabolism (collagenolysis) is required to be a tightly regulated process in normal physiology. In turn, the destruction or damage of collagen during pathological states plays a role in tumor growth and invasion, cartilage degradation, or atherosclerotic plaque formation and rupture. Several members of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family catalyze the hydrolysis of collagen triple helical structure. This study has utilized triple helical peptide (THP) substrates and inhibitors to dissect MMP-1 collagenolytic behavior. Analysis of MMP-1/THP interactions by hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry followed by evaluation of wild type and mutant MMP-1 kinetics led to the identification of three noncatalytic regions in MMP-1 (residues 285-295, 302-316, and 437-457) and two specific residues (Ile-290 and Arg-291) that participate in collagenolysis. Ile-290 and Arg-291 contribute to recognition of triple helical structure and facilitate both the binding and catalysis of the triple helix. Evidence from this study and prior studies indicates that the MMP-1 catalytic and hemopexin-like domains collaborate in collagen catabolism by properly aligning the triple helix and coupling conformational states to facilitate hydrolysis. This study is the first to document the roles of specific residues within the MMP-1 hemopexin-like domain in substrate binding and turnover. Noncatalytic sites, such as those identified here, can ultimately be utilized to create THP inhibitors that target MMPs implicated in disease progression while sparing proteases with host-beneficial functions."

Bone remodeling is a highly controlled physiological process that results from the balance between the formation and resorption of bone. Disruption of this equilibrium can give rise to bone disorders characterized by excessive bone resorption, such as osteoporosis (1.Riggs B.L. Parfitt A.M. J. Bone. Miner.

Under the control of local and systemic factors, mainly macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and receptor activator of nuclear factor-Œ∫B ligand (RANKL), monocyte/macrophage precursor cells undergo osteoclast differentiation, and this eventually leads to the formation of active bone-resorbing cells (2.Boyle W.J.

Most of the factors identified as affecting bone resorption enhance osteoclast formation or activity, but few factors have been shown to inhibit these processes. One important way to reduce osteoclast-resorbing activity is to induce osteoclast apoptosis (3.Roux S. Chamoux E. Pickens C.O. Cell Apoptotic Signaling Pathways. Nova Science Publishers, Hauppauge, NY2007: 163-184Google Scholar). In recent years, there has been growing evidence to suggest that osteoclast apoptosis could be modulated by locally released signals. For instance, we and others have demonstrated the role of the TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) pathway in osteoclast regulation (4.Brunetti G. Oranger A. Mori G. Tamma R. Di Benedetto A. Pignataro P. Grassi F.R. Zallone A. Grano M. Colucci S. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2007; 1116: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 5.Colucci S. Brunetti G. Cantatore F.P. Oranger A. Mori G.

We have also shown that TRAIL is expressed by osteoclasts deprived of survival factors and that this is part of an autocrine loop that modulates osteoclast survival and thus bone remodeling (7.Chamoux E. Houde N. L'Eriger K. Roux S. J. Cell. Physiol. 2008; 216: 536-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Transforming growth factor-Œ≤1 (TGF-Œ≤1) is an important functional modulator of osteoclasts. TGF-Œ≤ plays a major role in the proliferation, migration, differentiation, and survival of many cell types (8.Rahimi R.A. Leof E.B. J. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 102: 593-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The actions of TGF-Œ≤ require first its binding to the TGF-Œ≤ type-II receptor (TGF-Œ≤-RII) followed by the recruitment of TGF-Œ≤-RI. These ligand-receptor interactions lead to the phosphorylation of two cytoplasmic adaptors, Smad2 and Smad3, that in turn recruit Smad4 to form a trimeric complex of intracellular mediators that can enter the nucleus and initiate gene transcription (9.Massagu√© J. Seoane J. Wotton D. Genes. Dev. 2005; 19: 2783-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar). TGF-Œ≤ is also able to activate the MAP kinases ERK, p38, and JNK by alternative pathways (10.Javelaud D. Mauviel A. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 5742-5750Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). TGF-Œ≤ is known to influence bone metabolism in various ways. Firstly, TGF-Œ≤ acts on bone formation by up-regulating the recruitment and proliferation of osteoblast precursors and by inhibiting their apoptosis (11.Janssens K. ten Dijke P. Janssens S. Van Hul W. Endocr. Rev. 2005; 26: 743-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Secondly, TGF-Œ≤ indirectly slows the formation and activation of osteoclasts by reducing RANKL expression and increasing osteoprotegerin production by osteoblasts (12.Takai H. Kanematsu M. Yano K.

On the other hand, TGF-Œ≤ has direct and contradictory actions on osteoclasts by limiting both the proliferation and the fusion of osteoclast precursors and enhancing RANKL-mediated differentiation (13.Fuller K.

In addition, TGF-Œ≤ is a potent inducer of osteoclast apoptosis, although the mechanisms involved remain poorly understood (6.Roux S. Lambert-Comeau P. Saint-Pierre C. L√©pine M. Sawan B. Parent J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 333: 42-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 15.Hughes D.E. Dai A. Tiffee J.C. Li H.H. Mundy G.R. Boyce B.F. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Our aim was to investigate the mechanisms of TGF-Œ≤-induced osteoclast apoptosis in human osteoclasts differentiated from cord blood monocytes (CBMs). We show here that TGF-Œ≤1 activates the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis in osteoclasts. We also show that the p38 and Smad pathways may be involved in mediating the actions of TGF-Œ≤ and that Bim expression could be necessary for the execution of apoptosis. Recombinant human M-CSF, recombinant human GM-CSF, and caspase inhibitors were purchased from R&D systems (Minneapolis, MN); recombinant human TGF-Œ≤1 was obtained from Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ); staurosporine, monoclonal mouse antibodies directed against caspase-8, cleaved caspase-8, rabbit polyclonal antibodies against caspase-9, cleaved caspase-9, all anti-MAP kinases and anti-Smad antibodies, as well as the rabbit polyclonal antibody against actin came from Cell Signaling Technologies (Danvers, MA). The rabbit polyclonal antibody against TGF-Œ≤ type-I and type-II receptors and the rabbit polyclonal antibody against Bcl-2 homologous were both purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Normal goat, rabbit, and mouse serum and LSAB2 staining kit were obtained from DAKO (Glostrup, Denmark). Soluble human RANKL was produced in our laboratory. Umbilical cord blood from normal pregnant women was obtained at delivery after informed consent. Mononuclear leukocyte suspensions were isolated from the cord blood by density-gradient centrifugation and then washed and suspended in OPTI-MEM (Invitrogen, Burlington, Ontario, Canada) with antibiotics (1 IU/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, 0.5 mg/ml amphotericin B) and 2% fetal bovine serum (Wisent, Montr√©al, PQ). They were plated at a density of 3 √ó 106 cells/ml. After incubating overnight, the cells were washed to remove non-adherent cells. The selected CBMs were cultured for another 3 weeks, in the same medium supplemented with GM-CSF (100 pg/ml), for the first 3 days and then with M-CSF (25 ng/ml) and RANKL (100 ng/ml). The medium was changed twice weekly. We have previously shown that fully differentiated osteoclasts form under these conditions (6.Roux S. Lambert-Comeau P. Saint-Pierre C. L√©pine M. Sawan B. Parent J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 333: 42-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 16.Roux S. Quinn J. Pichaud F. Orcel P. Chastre E. Jullienne A. De Vernejoul M.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 489-498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After 3 weeks of culture in eight-chamber Labtecks, mature cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 5% skimmed milk, and the cells were then incubated overnight at 4 ¬∞C with the primary antibody directed against human TGF-Œ≤-RI (1:200), TGF-Œ≤-RII (1:200), cleaved caspase-8 (1:100), or cleaved caspase-9 (1:100) or with the same concentration of normal goat or mouse serum. After three washes, the specimens were exposed to 3% H2O2 in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min to inactivate any endogenous peroxidase activity. Sequential incubations were then performed with biotinylated secondary antibody (45 min) and peroxidase-labeled streptavidin (45 min) from the biotin-streptavidin-peroxidase LSAB2 kit. Specific labeling was revealed with 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole chromogen, which gave rise to a red precipitate where peroxidase had been bound. To identify multinucleated cells, the specimens were counterstained with hematoxylin. To prevent cross-stimulation, osteoclast cultures were performed after removing M-CSF and RANKL, as well as reducing fetal bovine serum to 1% in the OPTI-MEM for 24 h prior to the experiments. TGF-Œ≤1 (1 ng/ml) or staurosporine (1 Œºm) was then added for various periods of time (3‚Äì24 h). The cells were then washed twice before being lysed for 20 min on ice in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA). 50 Œºg of total proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The membrane was blocked with 5% skimmed milk and incubated overnight at 4 ¬∞C with the primary antibody. For these experiments, we used primary antibodies against caspase-8 (1:250), caspase-9 (1:500), JNK (1:1000) and phospho-JNK (1:250), ERK and phospho-ERK (1:1000), p38 (1:1000) and phospho-p38 (1:500), Smad2 and phospho-Smad2 (1:1000), and Bcl2, Bid, Bax, and Bim (1:250). Anti-actin antibodies were used as a loading control. The membranes were then washed before being incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibody. Bound antibodies were visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Biosciences). All bands were measured by densitometry and normalized for the optical density of the actin bands after stripping and reblotting the membranes (NIH ImageJ software, Bethesda, MD). Osteoclast apoptosis was determined after removing M-CSF and RANKL, as well as reducing fetal bovine serum to 1% in the OPTI-MEM for 24 h prior to the experiments. The TACS Blue Label kit (R&D Systems) was then used to detect and quantify apoptosis. This terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL)-derived method provides in situ cytochemistry visualization of DNA fragmentation at the single cell level. The cells were fixed, washed, and permeabilized in an ethanol:acetic acid (2:1) solution for 10 min at ‚àí20 ¬∞C. They were then washed thoroughly with phosphate-buffered saline for rehydration. Biotinylated nucleotides were incorporated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase for 2 h at 37 ¬∞C. Streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate was then added (45 min) followed by the substrate, TACS Blue Label (10 min). The resulting enzymatic reaction generated an insoluble, blue precipitate where DNA fragmentation had occurred. The specimens were then counterstained with Nuclear Fast Red for 10 min at room temperature to identify any multinucleated cells (cells with three or more nuclei) displaying nuclear fragmentation. The stained samples were examined using a light microscope, and the multinucleated cells were counted manually. 48 h before being stimulated, the differentiated cells were transfected with 30 nm Bim siRNA (SI026553559) or Smad2 siRNA (SI02757496) (Qiagen, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) in a solution containing 0.03% HiperFect transfection reagent in serum-free OPTI-MEM. Cells were incubated at 37 ¬∞C for 1 h while stirring gently. The transfection efficiency was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy in one well of the culture containing a control green fluorescent protein siRNA, and the subsequent shutdown of Bim or Smad2 was assessed by Western blot. 24 h before stimulation, the transfection medium was removed and replaced with RANKL- and M-CSF-free OPTI-MEM 1% fetal bovine serum. Results are expressed as mean ¬± S.E., and the significance was determined by a paired Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni post tests where applicable. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. Immunocytochemistry was used to detect TGF-Œ≤-RI and -RII on the cell surface of unpermeabilized osteoclasts using polyclonal antibodies against TGF-Œ≤-RI and TGF-Œ≤-RII, and strong labeling was observed on MNCs, which contrasted with the nonspecific labeling on controls (Fig. 1A). The numbers of labeled cells showed that 74.0 ¬± 4.1% of MNCs expressed TGF-Œ≤-RI, whereas 69.4 ¬± 5.2% expressed TGF-Œ≤-RII (Fig. 1B). These findings show that both the TGF-Œ≤-RI and the TGF-Œ≤-RII receptors were expressed at the surface of human osteoclasts, suggesting that TGF-Œ≤ could be bound to these receptors and potentially produce a direct action as a result. At the end of the CBM cultures, after the M-CSF and RANKL had been removed, different concentrations of TGF-Œ≤1 were added 24 h before the apoptosis was determined (0.1‚Äì10 ng/ml). Results revealed that the percentage of apoptotic MNCs was 41 ¬± 2.5% in the absence of TGF-Œ≤1 and significantly increased in the presence of TGF-Œ≤1 at a concentration of 1 ng/ml (p < 0.01 versus NT) and 10 ng/ml (p < 0.001 versus NT). In experiments performed in the presence of RANKL, the percentages of apoptotic MNCs were lower (Fig. 1, C and D). Thus TGF-Œ≤1 induced osteoclast apoptosis, although less efficiently in RANKL-stimulated cells. To determine which apoptosis pathway was activated in response to TGF-Œ≤1 stimulation, we determined the levels of cleavage of caspase-8 and caspase-9, hallmarks of the activation of the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways, respectively. In Western blot experiments, no detectable level of cleaved caspase-8 (43/45 kDa) was found after TGF-Œ≤1 stimulation. In contrast, increased cleavage of caspase-9 (35/37 kDa) occurred after exposure to 1 ng/ml TGF-Œ≤1. Staurosporine (1 Œºm) was used as a positive control of apoptosis induction and of the activation of caspase-8 and caspase-9 (Fig. 2A). As Western blot results involve observing the whole culture, which contains cells other than osteoclasts, TGF-Œ≤-induced caspase activation in osteoclast cultures was also evaluated by immunocytochemistry using antibodies raised against the cleaved fragments of activated caspase-8 and caspase-9 (Fig. 2B). Cleaved caspase-8 expression was the same in untreated cells and in cells that had been treated with TGF-Œ≤1 (1 ng/ml) for 24 h, whereas it was significantly increased in the presence of staurosporine. In contrast, the percentage of MNC labeled with anti-cleaved caspase-9 antibodies was significantly increased by TGF-Œ≤1 stimulation when compared with untreated cells (Fig. 2C). These findings suggest that TGF-Œ≤1 induced apoptosis by activating caspase-9, and therefore the intrinsic pathway, in human osteoclasts. To further confirm the implication of the intrinsic pathway in the TGF-Œ≤-induced apoptosis, MNC apoptosis levels were evaluated in the presence of caspase inhibitors. Cells were deprived of survival factors (M-CSF and RANKL) for 24 h and then preincubated with caspase inhibitors for 1 h before being exposed to TGF-Œ≤1 for 24 h (Fig. 2D). Apoptosis was detected in 33.6 ¬± 3.4% of the untreated MNCs; this corresponded to the basal level of apoptosis after survival factor deprivation. As expected, apoptosis was significantly increased in MNCs that had been exposed to TGF-Œ≤1 for 24 h. However, a preincubation with Z-LEHD, a specific caspase-9 inhibitor, totally prevented TGF-Œ≤1-induced apoptosis, and the level was similar to that of unstimulated cells. In contrast, the use of a caspase-8 inhibitor, Z-IETD, did not prevent apoptosis induction in TGF-Œ≤1-treated cells. These results confirm that the activation of caspase-9, but not that of caspase-8, is involved in TGF-Œ≤1-induced apoptosis in human osteoclasts. To further explain the activation of caspase-9 by TGF-Œ≤1, we investigated the signaling cascades activated in response to stimulation. The best known signaling cascades activated by TGF-Œ≤, including Smad and MAPKs (ERK, JNK, and p38) pathways, were investigated by Western blot (Fig. 3). TGF-Œ≤1 stimulation induced fast and transient phosphorylation of ERK after only 2 min, which peaked at 5 min (1.65-fold activation, p = 0.12), and then progressively decreased (Fig. 3B). TGF-Œ≤1 induced significant activation of p38 after 15 min, with a 1.9-fold increase in phosphorylation when compared with untreated cells (p < 0.01) (Fig. 3C). Finally, marked activation of Smad2 was detected from its phosphorylation 30 min after adding TGF-Œ≤1 (6.32-fold activation, p < 0.05), which indicated activation of the Smad pathway (Fig. 3D). Interestingly, we did not observe any significant modification of JNK phosphorylation within 3 h after TGF-Œ≤1 stimulation, suggesting that this MAPK may not be involved in downstream TGF-Œ≤ stimulation in osteoclasts under these conditions (Fig. 3A). The complex of Smad proteins formed after TGF-Œ≤ stimulation acts like a transcription factor. As the increased activity of ERK, p38, and Smad2 may modulate apoptosis-related gene transcription, we evaluated the expression of four common Bcl-2 homologs by Western blot after 3‚Äì24 h of TGF-Œ≤1 treatment (Fig. 4A). We did not observe any obvious change in the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 or in the expression of the pro-apoptotic Bid. However, although this was not statistically significant, we did observe a consistent trend toward increased expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax (1.35-fold increase after 6 h when compared with untreated cells). Furthermore, a strong and significant increase of Bim expression was detected after 6 h of TGF-Œ≤1 stimulation (increased 3.52-fold when compared with untreated, p < 0.005) (Fig. 4B). This strongly suggests that increased expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim could be involved in TGF-Œ≤1-induced apoptosis in human osteoclasts. To further investigate whether Bim expression was required to mediate TGF-Œ≤1-induced apoptosis, we knocked down Bim expression by siRNA (Fig. 5A). Osteoclasts were then exposed to TGF-Œ≤1, and then caspase-9 cleavage and apoptosis were evaluated. Immunocytochemistry experiments revealed that caspase-9 cleavage occurred to the same extent in non-transfected cells and in cells that were transfected with the unsilencing control siRNA included in the kit. This ruled out a potential involvement of the transfection process in caspase-9 activation in our cultures. Following TGF-Œ≤1 stimulation, 58.2 ¬± 5.2% of the MNCs were labeled with anti-cleaved caspase-9 antibodies after 6 h, a significantly higher number than was observed in untreated cells (p < 0.01). However, this TGF-Œ≤-induced increase of caspase-9 cleavage was abolished when cells were transfected with Bim siRNA (Fig. 5B). Finally, TGF-Œ≤1-induced apoptosis was evaluated in cells that had or had not been transfected with Bim siRNA. In non-transfected cells, apoptosis was significantly increased from 40.58 ¬± 2.0% in non-treated cells to 53 ¬± 2.0% in MNCs that had been exposed to TGF-Œ≤1 (1 ng/ml) for 24 h (p < 0.01). However, siRNA Bim totally prevented TGF-Œ≤1-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5C and supplemental Fig. 5-1). To explore further whether the TGF-Œ≤1-stimulated Smad pathway was required to mediate the increase in Bim expression, we shut down Smad2 expression by siRNA. Expression of Bim was studied by Western blot in cells transfected by Smad2 siRNA. The increase in Bim expression after exposure to TGF-Œ≤1 (1 ng/ml) for 6 h was no longer observed in cells cultured in the presence of Smad2 siRNA (Fig. 5D and supplemental Fig. 5-2). TGF-Œ≤ has previously been described as inducing apoptosis in murine and human osteoclasts (6.Roux S. Lambert-Comeau P. Saint-Pierre C. L√©pine M. Sawan B. Parent J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 333: 42-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 15.Hughes D.E. Dai A. Tiffee J.C. Li H.H. Mundy G.R. Boyce B.F. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar), and in the present study, we investigated the sequence of events leading to such effects. We have shown that TGF-Œ≤ receptors I and II were expressed at the surface of human osteoclasts and that TGF-Œ≤1 induced osteoclast apoptosis by activating the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis leading to caspase-9 activation. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that TGF-Œ≤1 induced a trend toward an early increase in ERK, the sequential phosphorylation of p38 and Smad2, and up-regulated Bim expression, which was related to the TGF-Œ≤1-induced osteoclast apoptosis. TGF-Œ≤ has a complex role in bone cells and bone remodeling. In human bone marrow cultures, TGF-Œ≤1 is known to be a potent inhibitor of osteoclast formation (17.Chenu C. Pfeilschifter J. Mundy G.R. Roodman G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1988; 85: 5683-5687Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). TGF-Œ≤ decreases RANKL expression and increases osteoprotegerin expression by osteoblasts in co-culture systems, thus indirectly decreasing osteoclast differentiation and activities by modulating the RANKL:osteoprotegerin ratio (12.Takai H. Kanematsu M. Yano K. Tsuda E. Higashio K. Ikeda K. Watanabe K. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27091-27096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). TGF-Œ≤ may also have a direct action on osteoclasts. TGF-Œ≤ could increase osteoclast formation by stimulating RANK, Œ±vŒ≤3 integrin, calcitonin receptor, and NFATc1 expression when introduced at an early stage of the osteoclast differentiation (13.Fuller K. Lean J.M. Bayley K.E. Wani M.R. Chambers T.J. J. Cell. Sci. 2000; 113: 2445-2453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Orcel P. Bielakoff J. De Vernejoul M.C. J. Cell.

Commun. 2008; 366: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, TGF-Œ≤ is known to induce apoptosis in mature osteoclasts (6.Roux S. Lambert-Comeau P. Saint-Pierre C. L√©pine M. Sawan B. Parent J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 333: 42-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 15.Hughes D.E. Dai A. Tiffee J.C. Li H.H. Mundy G.R. Boyce B.F. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). In vivo animal studies have indicated that bone mass increased when TGF-Œ≤ pathways were inhibited, whether by inhibition of the type-I receptor or by knock-out of the latent TGF-Œ≤-binding protein 3 (19.Dabovic B. Levasseur R. Zambuto L. Chen Y. Karsenty G. Rifkin D.B. Bone. 2005; 37: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 20.Mohammad K.S. Chen C.G. Balooch G. Stebbins E. McKenna C.R. Davis H.

PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e5275Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), reflecting the net effect of TGF-Œ≤ on bone as a result of its effects on bone cells, as well as on other intermediate cells. The presence of TGF-Œ≤ receptors has been detected in osteoclasts from giant cell tumors of bone that are formed in a tumoral environment (21.Franchi A. Benvenuti S. Masi L. Malentacchi C.

We confirm here that in other non-tumoral conditions, human osteoclasts express the TGF-Œ≤ type-I and type-II receptors. The intracellular pathways activated during TGF-Œ≤-induced apoptosis have been detailed in several studies of non-osteoclast cell types (23.Birkey Reffey S. Wurthner J.U. Parks W.T. Roberts A.B.

The mechanisms used by TGF-Œ≤ to induce apoptosis vary, depending on the cell type, and may involve death-associated protein kinases (DAPK), the MAP kinases p38 and JNK, or the Smad pathway (28.Ramesh S.

Although the p38 pathway is known to be involved in TGF-Œ≤-induced apoptosis, the activation of the p38 pathway has also been reported and associated with increased osteoclastogenesis (31.Karsdal M.A. Fjording M.S.

This observation underlines the importance of cross-talk between pathways and the variability of the effects on different systems (33.Olson J.M. Hallahan A.R. Trends. Mol. Med. 2004; 10: 125-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of Smad2 leads to the formation of a complex with pSmad3 and Smad4 that is translocated into the nucleus where it induces the transcription of target genes (11.Janssens K. ten Dijke P. Janssens S. Van Hul W. Endocr. Rev. 2005; 26: 743-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). The transcription of proapoptotic Bcl-2 homologs has often been implicated in Smad-dependent TGF-Œ≤-induced apoptosis (26.Ramjaun A.R. Tomlinson S. Eddaoudi A. Downward J. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 970-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These two pathways involving p38 and Smads were therefore potential candidates for conducting TGF-Œ≤-induced osteoclast apoptosis as their activation is known to enhance the transcription of various apoptosis-related genes (25.Ohgushi M. Kuroki S. Fukamachi H. O'Reilly L.A. Kuida K. Strasser A. Yonehara S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10017-10028Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 34.Loesch M. Chen G. Front.

Chem. 2003; 278: 18069-18077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In murine bone marrow cultures, TGF-Œ≤1 has been shown to suppress osteoclast apoptosis in cultures performed in the presence of RANKL (36.Gingery A. Bradley E.W. Pederson L. Ruan M. Horwood N.J. Oursler M.J. Exp. Cell. Res. 2008; 314: 2725-2738Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). RANKL, which is an osteoclast survival factor, may activate many signaling pathways that could interact with TGF-Œ≤ signaling and so affect the final balance between osteoclast life or death (3.Roux S. Chamoux E. Pickens C.O. Cell Apoptotic Signaling Pathways. Nova Science Publishers, Hauppauge, NY2007: 163-184Google Scholar). To clarify these potential types of cross-talk, we evaluated TGF-Œ≤-induced apoptosis in osteoclasts cultured in the presence of RANKL and did not observe any effect of TGF-Œ≤1 on osteoclast apoptosis studied under the same conditions (TGF-Œ≤1 1 ng/ml), although apoptosis was mildly induced with a higher dose of TGF-Œ≤1 (10 ng/ml). This could account for the apparent discrepancy between our results and those of Gingery et al. (36.Gingery A. Bradley E.W. Pederson L. Ruan M. Horwood N.J. Oursler M.J. Exp. Cell. Res. 2008; 314: 2725-2738Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This distinction may also help to clarify the proresorptive effect attributed to TGF-Œ≤ in the development of lytic bone metastasis. Indeed, TGF-Œ≤ is a major player in the vicious circle in which bone metastasis secrete factors that activate osteoclasts to resorb bone, leading to an increased TGF-Œ≤ release from the bone matrix, which in turn stimulates tumor growth and parathyroid hormone-related protein production. Parathyroid hormone-related protein is a potent stimulator of RANKL production by osteoblasts, thus sustaining the vicious cycle (37.Kingsley L.A. Fournier P.G. Chirgwin J.M. Guise T.A. Mol. Cancer. Ther. 2007; 6: 2609-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, TGF-Œ≤ is secreted along with numerous cytokines and growth factors that stimulate osteoclast formation and activity. Our findings clearly indicate that TGF-Œ≤1-induced apoptosis relies on the activation of the intrinsic pathway and caspase-9 cleavage. Caspase-8 cleavage, a characteristic of the extrinsic pathway, is not induced by TGF-Œ≤ but still displays a relatively high basal level of activation. This is probably due to the presence and activity of endogenous TRAIL that is produced by osteoclasts when they are deprived of survival factors, as reported previously (7.Chamoux E. Houde N. L'Eriger K. Roux S. J. Cell. Physiol. 2008; 216: 536-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It is, however, not surprising to find that TGF-Œ≤1 does not activate caspase-8 cleavage as its receptors do not bear a death receptor intracellular domain. The activation of caspase-9 cleavage, however, clearly relies on the expression of Bim, a member of the pro-apoptotic Bcl2 family. We demonstrate here that Bim expression is required to mediate TGF-Œ≤1-induced apoptosis, as has been reported in other cell types (25.Ohgushi M. Kuroki S. Fukamachi H. O'Reilly L.A. Kuida K. Strasser A. Yonehara S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10017-10028Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 26.Ramjaun A.R. Tomlinson S. Eddaoudi A. Downward J.

In addition, Bim appears to be essential for the regulation of apoptosis in murine osteoclasts as this protein is rapidly induced in cytokine-deprived osteoclasts, and osteoclasts derived from Bim‚àí/‚àí mice are resistant to the withdrawal of cytokine-induced apoptosis (38.Akiyama T. Bouillet P. Miyazaki T. Kadono Y. Chikuda H. Chung U.I. Fukuda A. Hikita A. Seto H. Okada T. Inaba T. Sanjay A. Baron R. Kawaguchi H. Oda H. Nakamura K. Strasser A. Tanaka S. EMBO. J. 2003; 22: 6653-6664Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In our study, although the absence of survival factors could have induced increased Bim expression, we clearly show that in the absence of Bim expression, TGF-Œ≤1-induced apoptosis did not occur in osteoclasts. In addition, under the transcriptional control of Smad3/4 signaling, an up-regulation of Bim appeared to be crucial for TGF-Œ≤-induced apoptosis in Hep3B cells (39.Yu J. Zhang L. Chen A. Xiang G. Wang Y. Wu J. Mitchelson K. Cheng J. Zhou Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 2008; 215: 422-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In the absence of survival factors such as RANKL, TGF-Œ≤1 induced apoptosis in our model of human osteoclast differentiation and also activated both the canonical Smad signaling pathways and the MAPK p38 pathway. An up-regulation of Bim expression was involved in triggering the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, leading to osteoclast apoptosis. Although Bim appeared to play an important role in the TGF-Œ≤-induced osteoclast apoptosis, further studies are necessary to relate this to the activation of the Smad pathway in our model, although this is strongly suggested by previously published data, and our results suggest that this could be driven by the TGF-Œ≤1-stimulated Smad2 pathway. In addition, we speculate that p38 may play a role as the p38 pathway mediates the induction of apoptosis through the activation of caspase-9 but not of caspase-8 (40.S√°nchez-Capelo A. Cytokine Growth. Factor. Rev. 2005; 16: 15-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar); however, the precise mechanisms involved remain to be elucidated. This pro-apoptotic effect of TGF-Œ≤1 on osteoclasts could be consistent with the hypothesis that TGF-Œ≤ acts as a coupling agent in bone remodeling. After bone resorption has occurred, TGF-Œ≤ is locally released from the bone matrix and then inhibits bone resorption partly by inducing osteoclast apoptosis and partly by stimulating osteoblastic bone formation.

https://openalex.org/W1969033521,"Modulating Visual Memory Layer 3 of the secondary visual cortical area V2 plays a role in visual information processing. However, in contrast to layer 3, layer 6 of visual cortex is composed of many types of neurons and their response to visual stimuli is more complex. The importance of layer 6 in visual information processing remains an enigma. L√≥pez-Aranda et al. (p. 87 ; see the Perspective by Saksida ) investigated its role in the rat visual cortex in the processing of both short- and long-term visual memory. Elimination of neurons from layer 6 of area V2 led to complete loss of normal memory. However, overexpression of a protein called RGS-14 in the same area boosted the visual memory capacity in such a way that the animals retained the visual information for many months, rather than the normal 45 minutes."
https://openalex.org/W2032131702,"The packaging of the eukaryotic genome into chromatin represses gene expression by blocking access of the general transcription machinery to the underlying DNA sequences. Accordingly, eukaryotes have developed a variety of mechanisms to disrupt, alter, or disassemble nucleosomes from promoter regions and open reading frames to allow transcription to occur. Although we know that chromatin disassembly from the yeast PHO5 promoter is triggered by the Pho4 activator, the mechanism is far from clear. Here we show that the Pho4 activator can occupy its nucleosome-bound DNA binding site within the PHO5 promoter. In contrast to the role of Saccharomyces cerevisiae FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) complex in assembling chromatin within open reading frames, we find that FACT is involved in the disassembly of histones H2A/H2B from the PHO5 promoter during transcriptional induction. We have also discovered that the proteasome is required for efficient chromatin disassembly and transcriptional induction from the PHO5 promoter. Mutants of the degradation function of the proteasome have a defect in recruitment of the Pho4 activator, whereas mutants of the ATPase cap of the proteasome do recruit Pho4 but are still delayed for chromatin assembly. Finally, we rule out the possibility that the proteasome or ATPase cap is driving chromatin disassembly via a potential ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling activity.

Finally, we rule out the possibility that the proteasome or ATPase cap is driving chromatin disassembly via a potential ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling activity. Eukaryotic chromatin is made up of a fundamental repeating unit, termed the nucleosome, which consists of 147 bp of DNA wrapped around the outside of an octamer of histone proteins (1.Luger K. M√§der A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6842) Google Scholar). The histone octamer in turn comprises a heterotetramer of histone proteins H3/H4 and two heterodimers of histones H2A/H2B. In order to allow the transcription machinery to gain access to the DNA, the chromatin structure is altered by the concerted action of three processes (2.Li B. Carey M. Workman J.L. Cell. 2007; 128: 707-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2663) Google Scholar): (i) post-translational modifications on the histones, (ii) the breakage of histone-DNA contacts by ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling machines, and (iii) the ultimate removal of histones from the DNA by histone chaperones. The sequence-specific transcriptional activators trigger these chromatin alterations occurring at promoters during transcriptional induction, but it is unclear whether transcriptional activators can first bind to their nucleosome-buried DNA recognition sequences to start this cascade of chromatin dynamics. Similarly, once transcription is complete, transcriptional activators leave the DNA, and promoters are repackaged with histones via the process of chromatin assembly. The assembly and disassembly of nucleosomes appear to occur in a stepwise manner (3.Smith S. Stillman B. EMBO. J. 1991; 10: 971-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). This is due to the peripheral positions of the H2A/H2B dimers within the nucleosome (1.Luger K. M√§der A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6842) Google Scholar), necessitating the removal of H2A/H2B prior to removal of the central H3/H4 tetramer. Conversely, H3/H4 must be deposited onto the DNA prior to H2A/H2B in order to assemble a nucleosome. Accordingly, histone chaperones exist that bind to either H2A/H2B or H3/H4 to mediate chromatin assembly and disassembly. We have previously shown that the histone chaperone Asf1 (anti-silencing function 1) promotes the disassembly of histones H3/H4 from multiple yeast promoter regions during transcriptional induction (4.Adkins M.W. Howar S.R. Tyler J.K. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 5.Adkins M.W. Williams S.K. Linger J. Tyler J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 6372-6382Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), whereas the histone chaperone Spt6 promotes the deposition of H3/H4 onto promoters during transcriptional repression (6.Adkins M.W. Tyler J.K. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 405-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, we still do not know the identity of the histone chaperones that remove histones H2A/H2B from promoter regions during transcriptional induction or that replace H2A/H2B onto the promoter during transcriptional repression. Dynamic chromatin assembly and disassembly processes also occur within the open reading frame during transcription. The histone chaperone Spt6 is required for the deposition of H3/H4 onto chromatin behind the RNA polymerase (7.Kaplan C.D. Laprade L. Winston F. Science. 2003; 301: 1096-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), whereas the histone chaperone FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) assembles H2A/H2B onto the DNA behind the elongating RNA polymerase (7.Kaplan C.D. Laprade L. Winston F. Science. 2003; 301: 1096-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 8.Mason P.B. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8323-8333Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Yeast FACT is a heterodimeric protein complex of Spt16 and Pob3, although the HMG1-like protein Nhp6 also interacts and functionally cooperates with yFACT (9.Formosa T. Eriksson P. Wittmeyer J. Ginn J. Yu Y. Stillman D.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3506-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Spt16 was originally identified to be a suppressor of Ty insertions into HIS4 and LYS2 (10.Malone E.A. Clark C.D. Chiang A. Winston F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5710-5717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although this implies that FACT has a role in the initiation of transcription, the molecular role of FACT at promoters has not yet been defined. The chromatin reassembly function of FACT within open reading frames requires ubiquitination of histone H2B on lysine 123 (11.Pavri R. Zhu B. Li G. Trojer P. Mandal S. Shilatifard A. Reinberg D. Cell. 2006; 125: 703-717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 12.Fleming A.B. Kao C.F. Hillyer C. Pikaart M. Osley M.A. Mol.

In turn, monoubiquitination of H2B Lys-123 is a result of the action of the ubiquitin ligase (E3) 3The abbreviations used are: E3ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligaseE2ubiquitin carrier proteinMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidtstemperature-sensitiveChIPchromatin immunoprecipitation.3The abbreviations used are: E3ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligaseE2ubiquitin carrier proteinMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidtstemperature-sensitiveChIPchromatin immunoprecipitation.

Osley M.A. Strahl B.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 637-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Notably, H2B Lys-123 ubiquitination is also required for the recruitment of the proteasome to the chromatin (15.Ezhkova E. Tansey W.P. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 435-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase ubiquitin carrier protein 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid temperature-sensitive chromatin immunoprecipitation. ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase ubiquitin carrier protein 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid temperature-sensitive chromatin immunoprecipitation. The proteasome is a multisubunit complex responsible for the selective degradation of almost all cytosolic proteins (16.Wolf D.H. Hilt W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Ubiquitinated proteins are recognized by the 26 S proteasome, which is a large proteolytic complex consisting of the 19 S cap complex and the 20 S catalytic core. The 19 S cap complex includes six ATPases, one of which is Sug1/Rpt6, and uses the energy provided by ATP hydrolysis to unwind proteins into unstructured chains. The 20 S core is composed of four stacked rings, which form a ‚Äútunnel‚Äù within which the unstructured protein chains undergo proteolytic cleavage into small peptides. To better understand the molecular mechanisms of chromatin disassembly and reassembly at promoter regions, we have examined the role of FACT, the proteasome, and H2A Lys-123 ubiquitination on these processes at the well studied yeast PHO5 model promoter. Our studies reveal novel roles for FACT in promoter chromatin disassembly but not reassembly and a novel role for the 19 and 20 S proteasomes in transcriptional induction. All media used were either with high (13.4 mm) phosphate or low (0.15 mm) phosphate. Media were prepared as follows. For 1 liter of medium, 0.7 g of yeast nitrogen base (without ammonium sulfate, phosphate, or amino acids), 2 g of glutamine, 100 ml of 20% glucose, and 3.9 g of MES were dissolved. Amino acids were added, and 1 m KH2PO4 and 1 m KCl were added to make the final ion concentration 13.4 mm. The pH of the medium was adjusted to 5.5, and the entire liter was filter-sterilized. The genotypes of all strains used are given in Table 1. The set of four strains used in Figs. 2E and 5E was generated by first making diploids that were heterozygous for the two temperature-sensitive (ts) mutations. Following meiosis and tetrad dissections, tetrads were identified that included one spore with both ts mutations, two spores with each individual ts mutation, and one spore with no ts mutation.TABLE 1Yeast strains used in this studyNameGenotypeSource/ReferenceBY4741Mat a; his3D1; leu2D0; met15D0; ura3D0ResGenBY4741asf1ŒîMat a; his3D1; leu2D0; met15D0; ura3D0; asf1::KanMX4ResGenBY4741bre1ŒîMat a; his3D1; leu2D0; met15D0; ura3D0; bre1::KanMX4ResGenBY4741rad6ŒîMat a; his3D1; leu2D0; met15D0; ura3D0; rad6::KanMX4ResGenFY56Mat Œ±; his4-912d; lys2-128d; ura3-52Ref. 10.Malone E.A.

To determine the number of cells used for each reaction, 100 Œºl of the cells were diluted 1:10 in double-distilled H20 and read at A600 nm. For each sample reaction, another 100 Œºl of washed cells were diluted 1:5 for a total volume of 500 Œºl in the same sodium acetate buffer and prewarmed for 10 min at 30 ¬∞C. A 500-Œºl sample of buffer alone was also included as a control as well as an appropriate volume (500 Œºl/reaction) of freshly made substrate, NPP (nitrophenyl phosphate (0.0742 g/10 ml), 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 3.6). After warming, 500 Œºl of substrate was added to each reaction sample and incubated at 30 ¬∞C for 10 min, at which time 250 Œºl of stop solution, 1 m Na2CO3, was added. Samples were centrifuged for 1 min and then read at A410 nm. Phosphatase activity was equated as (A420 √ó 1000)/(A600 √ó volume of cell lysate used (Œºl) √ó incubation time (min). Single time courses are shown in each case, but comparable results were obtained for all of the phosphatase assays in independent time courses. ChIP analyses were performed as described previously (17.Williams S.K. Truong D. Tyler J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 9000-9005Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), using either 2.5 Œºl of the C-terminal anti-histone H3 (catalog number ab1791; Abcam), 2 Œºl of anti-HA (catalog number mms-101r; Covance), or 2 Œºl of anti-Pho4 (courtesy of E. O'Shea) overnight at 4 ¬∞C. The sequential ChIP analyses utilized micrococcal nuclease-digested mononucleosomes as the template, whereas all other analyses utilized sonicated chromatin fragments. All ChIP quantitation was performed by real time PCR using a Roche Applied Sciences Light Cycler 480. The linear range of PCR templates was determined by performing a 10-fold serial dilution standard curve, which usually proved that a 1:10 dilution was sufficient. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate using 10-Œºl reactions in a 384-well plate format. The thermal profile was as follows: 1) denaturation at 95 ¬∞C for 10 min; 2) run cycle of 95 ¬∞C for 15 s and then 60 ¬∞C for 1 min for 50‚Äì60 cycles; 3) cooling at 40 ¬∞C for 30 s. Each immunoprecipitation sample was normalized to its respective input samples (to account for the number of cells taken) as well as a control region called GAL1/10, whose histone occupancy is regulated by glucose, not phosphate, levels. Primers and Taqman probes used were as follows: PHO5 UASp2 A, GAATAGGCAATCTCTAAATGAATCGA; PHO5 UASp2 B, GAAAACAGGGACCAGAATCATAAATT; PHO5 UASp2 probe, FAM-ACCTTGGCACTCACACGTGGGACTAGC-MGB; GAL1/10 A, GACGCACGGAGGAGAGTCTT; GAL1/10 B, CGCTTAACTGCTCATTGCTATATTG; GAL1/10 probe, FAM-CGCTCGGCGGCTTCTAATCCG-MGB. Samples were prepared by washing ‚àº50 Œºl of actively dividing cells twice with double-distilled H2O, resuspending in 100 Œºl of yeast sample buffer, and then boiling for 5 min. Samples were separated on a 10% acrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. The membrane was probed with 1:1000 anti-Pho2 antibody (courtesy of E. O'Shea) and then 1:50,000 IgG peroxidase conjugate antibody (catalog number A-1949; Sigma). Processing of the membrane was performed with the ECL Western blotting detection reagents (catalog number RPN2209; GE Healthcare). Homogenous nucleosomes were reconstituted by salt dilution using Xenopus laevis recombinant histone octamers and 601 nucleosome-positioning sequences. The DNA used for nucleosome reconstitution was synthesized by PCR, which comprises 601 positioning DNA sequence at the center flanked by 69 and 59 bp of extranucleosomal DNA. About one-tenth of the DNA was end-labeled with p32. For the nucleosome remodeling assay by gel shift, the indicated amounts of RSC (remodels the structure of chromatin), PA700, and 26 S were incubated with mononucleosomes (12 nm) for 30 min at 30 ¬∞C in the presence of 2 mm ATP. The purified yeast RSC remodeling complex was used as a control for remodeling reactions. The bound proteins were competed off, and reactions were terminated by adding excessive competitor DNA and 2 mm Œ≥-thio-ATP. The samples were analyzed on 5% PAGE with 0.2√ó TBE with buffer recirculation. Buffer conditions used for PA700 were as follows: 20 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.8, 60 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm EDTA, 4 mm Œ≤-mercaptoethanol, 6% glycerol, 100 Œºg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.08% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm ATP. Buffer conditions for 26 S were as follows: 20 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.8, 60 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.8 mm Œ≤-mercaptoethanol, 6% glycerol, 100 Œºg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.08% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm ATP. Buffer conditions for RSC were as follows: 20 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.8, 60 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 2 mm Œ≤-mercaptoethanol, 7% glycerol, 100 Œºg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.08% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm ATP. For the nucleosome remodeling assay by restriction accessibility assay, 6 nm concentrations of labeled mononucleosomes were incubated with RSC (3 nm), PA700 (3‚Äì81 nm), or 3‚Äì54 nm 26 S for 30 min at 30 ¬∞C with 3.75 units of RsaI. The reactions were stopped and deproteinized by adding an equal volume of stop solution (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1.2% SDS, 80 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K) and incubating at 50 ¬∞C for 20 min. Our studies of chromatin disassembly during transcriptional induction use ChIP analysis of histone and factor occupancy at the well characterized budding yeast PHO5 gene promoter (4.Adkins M.W.

PHO5 transcription is induced by phosphate depletion, which causes Pho81 to inhibit the Pho80-Pho85 cyclin-dependent kinase complex, leading to relocalization of the Pho4 activator to the nucleus (18.Komeili A. O'Shea E.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The Pho4 binding site within the PHO5 upstream activating sequence, UASp2, is occluded by a nucleosome (nucleosome ‚àí2) in repressing conditions (Fig. 1A). The localization of Pho4 to the nucleus is required for the subsequent disassembly of four nucleosomes (nucleosomes ‚àí1 to ‚àí4) from the PHO5 promoter (19.Boeger H. Griesenbeck J. Strattan J.S. Kornberg R.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1587-1598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 20.Reinke H. H√∂rz W. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1599-1607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), which is required in turn to allow the subsequent recruitment of the general transcription machinery (5.Adkins M.W. Williams S.K. Linger J. Tyler J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 6372-6382Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Whether Pho4 gains access to its nucleosome-occluded UASp2 DNA binding site to trigger this cascade of events is not known. Our earlier analyses had provided circumstantial evidence that Pho4 activator can bind to its UASp2 site that is very close to the dyad axis of symmetry of nucleosome ‚àí2 of the PHO5 promoter (Fig. 1A) while histones H3 and H2A are still present (4.Adkins M.W. Howar S.R. Tyler J.K. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 21.Williams S.K. Tyler J.K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2007; 17: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This potential intermediate state was achieved by slowing down the chromatin disassembly process by deleting the gene encoding the Asf1 histone chaperone in PHO5-inducing (low phosphate) conditions (4.Adkins M.W. Howar S.R. Tyler J.K. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 21.Williams S.K. Tyler J.K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2007; 17: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Given that the helix-loop-helix DNA binding domain of Pho4 makes intimate contacts with opposite faces of the DNA duplex (22.Shimizu T. Toumoto A. Ihara K. Shimizu M. Kyogoku Y. Ogawa N. Oshima Y. Hakoshima T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4689-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), it was unexpected to find the histone octamer and Pho4 coexisting on the same piece of DNA in vivo. Because our previous ChIP analyses had used sonication to generate ‚àº500-bp chromatin fractions, we revisited these experiments using micrococcal nuclease- generated mononucleosomes (Fig. 1B). Disassembly of PHO5 nucleosome ‚àí2 is apparent 8 h after switching to low phosphate medium in wild type yeast, whereas nucleosome ‚àí2 is largely intact in the asf1 mutant strain (Fig. 1C, left). By contrast, the amount of Pho4 recruited to UASp2 8 h after switching to low phosphate medium is equivalent in both the wild type and asf1 mutant strain (Fig. 1C, middle). It is important to note that all analyses of factor occupancy at the PHO5 promoter are internally normalized to another region of the yeast genome (the GAL1 promoter), where there are no changes in histone occupancy or Pho4 occupancy in response to changes in phosphate concentrations (4.Adkins M.W. Howar S.R. Tyler J.K. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 5.Adkins M.W. Williams S.K. Linger J. Tyler J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 6372-6382Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In our previous ChIP analyses with the same antibodies used here, we have also shown that these factors are not detectably present at nonspecific DNA, such as the mitochondrial COX3 gene (4.Adkins M.W. Howar S.R. Tyler J.K. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 5.Adkins M.W. Williams S.K. Linger J. Tyler J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 6372-6382Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It is extremely unlikely that the Pho4 bound to nucleosome ‚àí2 in the asf1 mutant reflects binding to the adjacent UASp1 site, because the UASp2 within the nucleosome ‚àí2 site is 13 times stronger than the UASp1 site (23.Maerkl S.J. Quake S.R. Science. 2007; 315: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). As such, the Pho4 occupancy in the asf1 mutant in the inducing condition (‚àíPi) would have been 8% of that seen in the wild type strain if it were due to binding to the UASp1 site alone, not the equivalent binding that we see with the asf1 mutant and wild type strain in Fig. 1C (middle). In addition, the UASp1 site is in a nucleosome-free region and therefore is likely to have been destroyed by digestion to mononucleosomes. To provide additional proof of co-occupancy of histones H3 and Pho4 at nucleosome ‚àí2, we performed sequential ChIP analysis of the mononucleosomes. First we immunoprecipitated for Pho4, followed by elution of the immunoprecipitates and their subsequent immunoprecipitation for H3. As shown in the right panel of Fig. 1C, we found that H3 and Pho4 co-occupy nucleosome ‚àí2 in the asf1 mutant in inducing conditions (‚àíPi). These results establish that the Pho4 activator does co-occupy the same stretch of DNA as a histone octamer in vivo, clearly demonstrating that histone removal occurs after activator binding. We sought to investigate the mechanism whereby activator binding triggers the subsequent removal of histones H2A and H2B from the PHO5 promoter during transcriptional induction. To ask whether the H2A/H2B chaperone FACT is implicated in chromatin disassembly from promoter regions, we examined transcriptional induction in a temperature-sensitive mutant of the Spt16 subunit of FACT following phosphate removal after FACT had been first inactivated by shifting to the restrictive temperature. Activation of the PHO5 gene was greatly delayed upon inactivation of Spt16 (Fig. 2A). In agreement, disassembly of histones H2A/H2B from the PHO5 promoter is greatly delayed when FACT is inactivated prior to the addition of the signal for PHO5 induction (‚àíPi) (Fig. 2B). As expected, the removal of H3/H4 from the PHO5 promoter was also delayed when FACT was inactivated, given that H3/H4 cannot be removed from the DNA until after H2A/H2B are removed (Fig. 2C). These data indicate that the histone chaperone FACT is important for the disassembly of H2A/H2B from the PHO5 promoter and its subsequent transcriptional induction. Induction of the PHO5 gene in response to phosphate removal requires that the cell first use up its endogenous phosphate and polyphosphate stores, which itself requires growth. Given that Spt16 is an essential protein, it was possible that the failure of spt16 mutant yeast to induce PHO5 transcription might be due to its growth defect at the non-permissive temperature. To rule out this possibility, we inactivated the Pho80 protein with a conditional allele, which results in Pho4 being constitutively nuclear under all phosphate conditions at the non-permissive temperature (24.O'Neill E.M. Kaffman A. Jolly E.R. O'Shea E.K. Science. 1996; 271: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). As such, phosphate depletion and growth are not required for induction of PHO5 transcription in the absence of Pho80. Following a shift to the non-permissive temperature in high phosphate medium, we found that the pho80 mutant was able to induce PHO5 transcription as expected, whereas the wild type strain could not (Fig. 2D). By contrast, the pho80 spt16 double mutant gave an intermediate result, being able to partially induce PHO5 (Fig. 2D). These data confirm that FACT promotes chromatin disassembly and the subsequent transcriptional induction from the PHO5 promoter. To provide additional confirmation of a role for FACT in promoter chromatin disassembly, we examined the HMG-1-like protein Nhp6, which functionally potentiates the ability of FACT to alter nucleosome structure (25.Ruone S. Rhoades A.R. Formosa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45288-45295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 26.Rhoades A.R. Ruone S. Formosa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3907-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we found that induction of PHO5 transcription was greatly delayed in the absence of Nhp6, which was achieved by the deletion of the functionally redundant NHP6A and NHP6B genes (Fig. 2E). This delay in PHO5 transcriptional induction in the absence of Nhp6 was not a consequence of altered levels of the Pho2 activator that is required for PHO5 induction, since its levels were indistinguishable between wild type and Nhp6 mutants (Fig. 2F). Rather, the delay in transcriptional induction in the absence of Nhp6 was most likely due to the delay in chromatin disassembly that is apparent in the absence of Nhp6 (Fig. 2G). Taken together, these results demonstrate that FACT has a novel function in promoting histone H2A/H2B removal from"

The enzyme catalyzes the oxidative dehydrogenation of unsaturated alcohols with a primary hydroxyl at CŒ±, exhibiting broad substrate specificity. In addition to benzyl alcohols, its active site also binds and oxidizes aliphatic polyunsaturated primary alcohols (such as 2,4-hexadien-1-ol), naphthyl, and cinnamyl alcohols, and shows low activity on some aromatic aldehydes (17Ferreira P.

Methanol and other saturated alcohols are not AAO substrates, and the monounsaturated allyl alcohol is very slowly oxidized (2Guill√©n F. Mart√≠nez A.T. Mart√≠nez M.J. Eur. J.

Mart√≠nez A.T. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 731-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A recent mutational study confirmed the strict requirement for catalysis of His-502 and His-546 located near the isoalloxazine ring of FAD (supplemental Fig. S1), as well as the involvement of two aromatic residues (18Ferreira P.

Here we present the first study on the reaction mechanism of AAO in which substrate and solvent kinetic isotope effect (KIE), in combination with bisubstrate steady state and pre-steady state kinetic approaches, have been used to investigate the mechanism of polyunsaturated primary alcohol oxidation by AAO. Its natural substrate, p-anisyl alcohol, as well as a structurally different (non-aromatic) AAO substrate, 2,4-hexadien-1-ol, were chosen as two models for the different AAO alcohol substrates. p-Anisyl alcohol, 2,4-hexadien-1-ol, p-anisic acid, 3-fluorobenzyl alcohol, sodium deuteroxide, and deuterium oxide (99.9%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. p-[Œ±-2H2]anisyl alcohol ([1,1-2H2]1-(4‚Ä≤-methoxyphenyl)-methanol) and [Œ±-2H2]2,4-hexadien-1-ol ([1,1-2H2]2,4-hexadien-1-ol) were synthesized at the Instituto de Ciencia de Materiales de Arag√≥n (CSIC-UZ, Zaragoza, Spain). Recombinant AAO of P. eryngii was obtained by E. coli expression of the mature AAO cDNA (GenBankTM AF064069) followed by in vitro activation in the presence of the cofactor and purification by ion-exchange chromatography (16Ruiz-Due√±as F.J.

Buffers used were 100 mm citrate phosphate for pH 4‚Äì7, and 100 mm pyrophosphate for pH 8‚Äì9. The Kd for the AAO complex with p-anisic acid was measured by titration of 16 Œºm AAO with p-anisic acid (0‚Äì1.24 mm) in 100 mm phosphate, pH 6, at 25 ¬∞C. The inhibition of AAO activity by p-anisic acid was studied at 25 ¬∞C, under atmospheric O2 concentration, using veratryl alcohol as substrate. Measurements were carried out at different pH values (supplemental Eqs. S3‚ÄìS5 were used). Buffers used were the above indicated for steady state kinetics. Experiments were carried out with an Applied Photophysics SX17.MV spectrophotometer interfaced with an Acorn computer. The SX18.MV and Xscan softwares were used for experiments using the single wavelength or photodiode array (350‚Äì700 nm) detectors, respectively. For enzyme-monitored turnover experiments (19Gibson Q.H. Swoboda B.E. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 3927-3934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), equal volumes of air-saturated enzyme and substrate solutions were mixed, and evolution of the redox state of the flavin cofactor was monitored. Reductive half-reactions were studied under anaerobic conditions as described in the supplemental materials (see also supplemental Eqs. S6 and S7). Measurements were carried out in 100 mm phosphate, pH 6, at 12 ¬∞C. Steady state KIE experiments were performed in 100 mm phosphate under atmospheric O2 (0.273 mm at 25 ¬∞C) as described above, but using bideuterated substrates (p-[Œ±-2H2]anisyl alcohol and [Œ±-2H2]2,4-hexadien-1-ol) and/or deuterated solvent. pH profiles for Vmax and Vmax/Km KIE values were estimated in the pH 4‚Äì9 range. For assays in deuterated solvent, the reaction components were dissolved in deuterated 100 mm phosphate, pD 6. AAO was exhaustively dialyzed against the buffer to remove exchangeable protons. Pre-steady state substrate and solvent KIE for the AAO reductive half-reaction were analyzed at 12 ¬∞C under anaerobic conditions, as described above. The solvent viscosity effect on steady state parameters was measured as described under supplemental materials. Data analysis of the different measurements was carried out as described under supplemental data. The double reciprocal plots of p-anisyl alcohol and 2,4-hexadien-1-ol oxidation rates at different O2 concentrations showed a series of lines converging at the left side of the y axis (supplemental Fig. S2). This suggests a sequential mechanism in which O2 reacts with the reduced enzyme before release of the product takes place. According to this kinetic pattern, the best data fitting (supplemental Eq. S1) was consistent with a ternary complex mechanism. The steady-state kinetic parameters for both substrates are summarized in Table 1 (left).TABLE 1Kinetic parameters (of steady and pre-steady states) for AAO oxidation of p-anisyl alcohol and 2,4-hexadien-1-olSteady stateaSteady state constants were determined by varying the concentrations of both reducing substrates and O2, and fitted to supplemental Eq.

Open table in a new tab The strength of p-anisic acid binding on AAO, calculated from the perturbation in the cofactor spectrum upon titration with the inhibitor at pH 6 (Fig. 1, inset), resulted in a Kd value of 94 ¬± 3 Œºm, in agreement with the Ki (80 ¬± 2 Œºm) previously reported (17Ferreira P. Medina M. Guill√©n F. Mart√≠nez M.J. van Berkel W.J.H. Mart√≠nez A.T. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 731-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Because the pKa values of competitive inhibitors are expected to reflect intrinsic values (20Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 625-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), p-anisic acid inhibition was determined as a function of pH (Fig. 1). Data fitting (supplemental Eq. S2) indicated that binding of the inhibitor is enhanced by protonation of a group with a pKa of 7.5 ¬± 0.1. pH dependence of the AAO steady state kinetic parameters for oxidation of p-anisyl alcohol and 2,4-hexadien-1-ol was first determined under atmospheric O2. As shown in Fig. 2A, the Vmax values (circles) were independent from pH 4 to 7, but decreased at greater pH values. Recombinant AAO is unstable at a pH beyond 9; therefore the Vmax pH profile suggests that a group with a pKa ‚â• 8.5 must be protonated for catalysis. In contrast, the AAO catalytic efficiency (triangles) was pH-independent, suggesting a decrease in KmS (Fig. 2A). A second set of experiments varying simultaneously the concentrations of p-anisyl alcohol and O2 was carried out. The kcat, kcat/KmS and kcat/KmO2 values obtained after data fitting (to supplemental Eq. S1) were independent of pH at saturating concentrations of both AAO oxidizing and reducing substrates, as shown in Fig. 2B (black symbols) for p-anisyl alcohol oxidation. The pH dependence of AAO activity was also analyzed with a substrate presenting considerably slower reactivity, 3-fluorobenzyl alcohol (17Ferreira P. Medina M. Guill√©n F. Mart√≠nez M.J. van Berkel W.J.H. Mart√≠nez A.T. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 731-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It was chosen expecting that chemical steps (rather than substrate binding and product release) would be rate limiting, thus allowing determination of true pKa values in AAO catalysis. Because the AAO KmO2 for 3-fluorobenzyl alcohol is 17 Œºm, reactions under atmospheric O2 result in an AAO saturating concentration for this substrate, and the pH dependence study was only performed under the these conditions. In Fig. 2B, a lack of pH dependence for 3-fluorobenzyl alcohol oxidation (white symbols) was observed. Therefore, under O2 saturation, AAO shows no pH dependence of kcat or catalytic efficiency for the substrates analyzed. To identify the redox state of the FAD cofactor during catalysis, AAO was mixed in the stopped-flow instrument with saturating concentrations of p-anisyl alcohol and 2,4-hexadien-1-ol under atmospheric O2 (Fig. 3 and supplemental Fig. S3, respectively). A fast decrease in absorbance was observed within the first milliseconds after mixing (instrumental dead time), indicating reduction of the FAD. However, shortly after this initial decay, a lag period is observed. This suggests a steady state situation with competition between reduction of the flavin by the substrate and reoxidation by O2. During turnover conditions, the fraction of oxidized enzyme remained around 75‚Äì70% of the total (as shown in the insets). This steady state period was short, and subsequent reduction of the FAD cofactor to its hydroquinone form was observed. Therefore, reduced AAO only accumulated after depletion of the O2 present in solution, suggesting that the reductive half-reaction limits AAO catalysis. On the other hand, the spectral evolution during p-anisyl alcohol oxidation suggests formation of a charge-transfer complex (Fig. 3). Additionally, a displacement of the position of the flavin band-I from 463 to 458 nm, and a better resolution of the shoulder at 474 nm, were observed for both substrates already in the first spectrum after mixing. These changes are in agreement with those observed during titration with p-anisic acid (Fig. 1). Pre-steady state reduction of oxidized AAO by p-anisyl and 2,4-hexadien-1-ol was analyzed under anaerobic conditions (Fig. 4 and supplemental Fig. S4, respectively). The spectra obtained indicated full reduction of AAO by both alcohols without the appearance of any FAD semiquinone intermediate. Global analysis of the spectral evolution best fit to a three step model. The first process (A ‚Üí B) was fast (over 100 s‚àí1 for both alcohol substrates) and accounted for more than 80% of the amplitude of the reaction. The second process (B ‚Üí C) was concentration-independent, and too slow (3‚Äì5 s‚àí1) to account for the turnover. Probably it has no catalytic relevance and, because it was not observed in the presence of O2 (Fig. 3), might be related to slow product release in the absence of the second substrate. Noticeably, the absence of O2 also prevented the displacement of the flavin band-I described above and the formation of the charge-transfer complex species. kobs values at different substrate concentrations were determined from single kinetic traces monitored at 460 nm to follow FAD reduction by p-anisyl alcohol and 2,4-hexadien-1-ol (bottom part of Fig. 4 and supplemental Fig. S4, respectively). The observed rates for the fast process (kobs1) obeyed a Michaelis-Menten kinetic behavior. Data fits (to supplemental Eqs. S6 and S7) indicated insignificant krev values, in agreement with the photodiode-array analysis. Therefore, an essentially irreversible reduction of the flavin occurs during AAO catalysis with both substrates. The Kd and reduction rate (kred) values derived from this analysis are shown in Table 1 (right). They are in agreement with the above-reported KmS and kcat, indicating that the reductive half-reaction must be the rate-limiting step in AAO catalysis. Deuterium substitutions were used to further investigate if a hydride transfer mechanism leads to the AAO reductive half-reaction. Steady state parameters were determined using the Œ±-bideuterated alcohol substrates (p-[Œ±-2H2]anisyl alcohol and [Œ±-2H2]2,4-hexadien-1-ol) under air-saturation conditions (supplemental Table S1, left). The turnover rates for these compounds (in water or deuterium oxide) revealed a significant substrate KIE, with Vmax decreasing by a factor of ‚àº5, and efficiency decreasing by 3.7‚Äì12.1-fold, at pH 6 (Table 2), suggesting that the breakdown of the alcohol CŒ±-H/D bond is limiting the rate of flavin reduction and, therefore, of the overall catalysis. Whereas the substrate KIE on Vmax was not significantly different in water and deuterium oxide, stronger effects were observed on the efficiency of reactions in deuterium oxide (the D(Vmax/Km)(D2O) values for both alcohol substrates being 1.3‚Äì1.4-fold higher than the D(Vmax/Km) values).TABLE 2Substrate, solvent, and multiple KIE on AAO steady-state constants for p-anisyl alcohol and 2,4-hexadien-1-ol oxidationp-Anisyl alcohol2,4-Hexadien-1-olSubstrate KIEDVmax5.41 ¬± 0.145.59 ¬± 0.14D(Vmax/Km)3.71 ¬± 0.259.16 ¬± 1.08DVmax(D2O)5.22 ¬± 0.345.57 ¬± 0.10D(Vmax/Km)(D2O)5.32 ¬± 0.6512.10 ¬± 0.80Solvent KIED2OVmax1.35 ¬± 0.061.25 ¬± 0.03D2O(Vmax/Km)1.15 ¬± 0.111.26 ¬± 0.11D2OVmax(D)1.30 ¬± 0.071.25 ¬± 0.02D2O(Vmax/Km)(D)1.65 ¬± 0.171.66 ¬± 0.17Multiple KIED,D2OVmax7.03 ¬± 0.386.98 ¬± 0.15D,D2O(Vmax/Km)6.12 ¬± 0.5815.20 ¬± 1.10 Open table in a new tab The observed DVmax for alcohol oxidation by AAO resulted in pH dependence (Fig. 5A), increasing with protonation of a group with pKa of 7.1 ¬± 0.2 and 7.4 ¬± 0.2 for p-anisyl and 2,4-hexadien-1-ol, respectively. These values are in the range of those for p-anisic acid inhibition (Fig. 1) and one unit lower than found for Vmax on both substrates (Fig. 2A). In contrast, D(Vmax/Km) was pH-independent (Fig. 5B) showing average KIE values of 4.1 ¬± 0.3 and 9.4 ¬± 0.9 for p-anisyl and 2,4-hexadien-1-ol, respectively, in agreement with the lack of pH effect on AAO catalytic efficiency (Fig. 2A). Comparison of the steady state KIE values for both substrates at pH 6 (Table 2) showed that the p-anisyl alcohol DVmax was significantly larger than the D(Vmax/Km), suggesting that external commitments to catalysis partially mask the KIE with this substrate. To probe the timing of the kinetic steps involving solvent exchangeable protons, such as the cleavage of the substrate OH bond (and alkoxide formation) during the reductive half-reaction, steady state kinetic parameters were also investigated at 25 ¬∞C (pH 6) using deuterated buffer (supplemental Table S1, left), and similar solvent effects were observed at 12 ¬∞C. In all cases, the solvent KIE observed (Table 2) was much lower than the substrate KIE described above. A solvent effect on D2OVmax (1.25‚Äì1.35) was observed for both p-anisyl and 2,4-hexadien-1-ol, which was independent of their isotopic composition (D2O(Vmax(D))) values of 1.25‚Äì1.30). Despite D2O(Vmax/Km) values for both substrates were scarcely different from unity, a larger effect was observed when KIE was measured with deuterated substrates (D2O(Vmax/Km)(D)) of 1.5‚Äì1.6) confirming the solvent effect. Moreover, a multiple KIE was observed (Table 2), being equal or higher to the product of the substrate and solvent KIE for Vmax and Vmax/Km on both substrates. The use of deuterium oxide increases the viscosity of the reaction medium (‚àº23% with regard to water, at 25 ¬∞C). This could affect the rate of diffusion-limited steps, such as enzyme-substrate complex formation and product dissociation. The possible effect of viscosity on p-anisyl alcohol oxidation was investigated with increasing glycerol concentrations. No significant viscosity effects on Vmax and Vmax/Km were observed (supplemental Fig. S5), enabling us to discard any viscosity-sensitive step in the removal of the alcohol hydroxyl proton by AAO. The KIE studies were completed by calculations of pre-steady state substrate and solvent parameters for the reductive half-reaction using the two deuterated alcohol substrates under anaerobic conditions (pH 6) (supplemental Table S1, right). When mixing AAO with p-[Œ±-2H2]anisyl alcohol or [Œ±-2H2]2,4-hexadien-1-ol, a complete irreversible reduction of the flavin was observed without detection of any intermediate semiquinone (not shown). For both Œ±-bideuterated substrates, the Dkred was ‚àº8.9, with nonsignificantly different Dkred(D2O) values (Table 3). Moreover, a slight but significant solvent KIE was detected on D2Okred (1.3‚Äì1.4), apparently being independent of the substrate (nonsignificantly different D2Okred(D) values). Finally, the multiple substrate and solvent KIE on kred resulted in the product of Dkred by D2Okred with D,D2Okred values around 13.5 and 12.5 for p-anisyl alcohol and 2,4-hexadien-1-ol, respectively. The KIE results are in agreement with a concerted mechanism for removal of the hydroxyl proton and hydride transfer to the flavin in AAO.TABLE 3Substrate, solvent, and multiple KIE on AAO presteady-state kred by Œ±-bideuterated p-anisyl alcohol and 2,4-hexadien-1-olp-Anisyl alcohol2,4-Hexadien-1-olSubstrate KIEDkred8.98 ¬± 0.828.93 ¬± 0.17Dkred(D2O)9.49 ¬± 0.369.41 ¬± 0.20Solvent KIED2Okred1.42 ¬± 0.101.33 ¬± 0.02D2Okred(D)1.50 ¬± 0.101.41 ¬± 0.04Multiple KIED,D2Okred13.50 ¬± 0.9012.50 ¬± 0.30 Open table in a new tab The AAO steady state kinetic parameters, obtained by varying both O2 and alcohol substrate concentrations, are consistent with a ternary complex mechanism (Scheme 1) with O2 reacting with the reduced enzyme before release of the aldehyde product. Therefore, AAO appears to follow a similar sequential mechanism with regard to choline oxidase, a GMC oxidoreductase oxidizing alcohol substrates to the corresponding aldehydes and acids (17Ferreira P. Medina M. Guill√©n F. Mart√≠nez M.J. van Berkel W.J.H. Mart√≠nez A.T. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 731-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 21Gadda G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1646: 112-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), while a ping-pong mechanism appears to apply for glucose oxidase (19Gibson Q.H. Swoboda B.E. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 3927-3934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another flavoenzyme exhibiting a sequential mechanism is vanillyl alcohol oxidase (22Fraaije M.W. van Berkel W.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18111-18116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), belonging to a family different of that from GMC oxidoreductases. AAO shows high reactivity toward O2 (3.7 √ó 105 and 7.0 √ó 105 m‚àí1 s‚àí1 in p-anisyl alcohol and 2,4-hexadien-1-ol oxidations, respectively) also described for glucose oxidase and vanillyl-alcohol oxidase (22Fraaije M.W. van Berkel W.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18111-18116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 23Roth J.P. Klinman J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 62-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In these two enzymes reorganization of the active site is related to reduced flavin activation for its reaction with O2. Thus, glucose oxidase has been shown to enhance O2 reactivity through protonation of a conserved histidine (His-516 of the A. niger enzyme) that has been related to a pKa ‚àº8 (23Roth J.P. Klinman J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 62-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Because this histidine is strictly conserved in GMC oxidoreductases, its involvement in the common reaction to all of them (i.e. the oxidative half-reaction) has been suggested (24Su Q. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8572-8581Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In contrast to that found for glucose oxidase, an effect of pH could not be detected in AAO kcat/ KmO2, and the same has been reported for choline oxidase (25Ghanem M. Fan F. Francis K. Gadda G. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 15179-15188Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Similar pKa values have been found for substrate oxidation efficiencies of methanol oxidase (8.3 using benzyl alcohol) and choline oxidase (7.6 using choline) and assigned to histidines homologous to the above glucose oxidase one (His-568 of Candida boidinii methanol oxidase, and His-466 of Arthrobacter globiformis choline oxidase), which in this case should be unprotonated for catalysis suggesting its implication in substrate alkoxide formation (26Menon V. Hsieh C.T. Fitzpatrick P.F. Bioorg. Chem. 1995; 23: 42-53Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 27Gadda G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1650: 4-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 28Ghanem M.

We failed to detect any pH dependence of the AAO steady state parameters under saturating O2 and p-anisyl concentrations, even when a less efficient substrate (Fig. 2B) was used to avoid possible external commitments to catalysis. However, a slight pH effect on AAO Vmax was found under non-saturating O2 concentration, suggesting that a residue with pKa ‚àº8.5 should be protonated for maximal turnover. Similar pH dependence has been described for veratryl alcohol oxidation by AAO expressed in Emericella nidulans (17Ferreira P. Medina M. Guill√©n F. Mart√≠nez M.J. van Berkel W.J.H. Mart√≠nez A.T. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 731-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and for p-anisyl alcohol oxidation by the AAO from a different basidiomycete (30Romero E. Ferreira P. Mart√≠nez A.T. Mart√≠nez M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1794: 689-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), as well as for oxidation of their respective substrates by cellobiose dehydrogenase and cholesterol oxidase (31Rotsaert F.A. Renganathan V. Gold M.H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4049-4056Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 32Kass I.J. Sampson N.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17990-18000Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Interestingly, atomic resolution characterization of the Streptomyces sp. cholesterol oxidase as a function of pH, revealed that its conserved His-447 is in the singly protonated form in the pH range 4.5‚Äì7.3 (maximal turnover conditions), converting to the anionic imidazolate at pH 9 (15Lario P.I. Sampson N. Vrielink A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 1635-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 33Lyubimov A.Y. Lario P.I. Moustafa I. Vrielink A. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This residue is homologous to His-502 of P. eryngii AAO, and His-689 of Phanerochaete chrysosporium cellobiose dehydrogenase (18Ferreira P. Ruiz-Due√±as F.J. Mart√≠nez M.J. van Berkel W.J. Mart√≠nez A.T. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 4878-4888Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) (as well as to the glucose oxidase, methanol oxidase and choline oxidase conserved histidines mentioned above). The theoretically predicted pKa1 and pKa2 values for some of these histidines (34Li H. Robertson A.D. Jensen J.H. Proteins. 2005; 61: 704-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar) also suggest a depression of both pKa by the protein environment. Thus, the turnover dependence on pH in AAO, and some other GMC oxidoreductases, might be in agreement with the presence of a neutral singly protonated histidine (in the pH range 4‚Äì7) playing a role in catalysis. If this is the case, the Vmax decrease at higher pH values could be related to deprotonation of conserved His-502 or His-546 (9Varela E. Jes√∫s Mart√≠nez M. Mart√≠nez A.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1481: 202-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) to its imidazolate form, negatively affecting AAO catalysis as proposed for cholesterol oxidase (33Lyubimov A.Y. Lario P.I. Moustafa I. Vrielink A. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Alcohol oxidation by AAO requires the removal of a proton from the substrate hydroxyl and a formal hydride from its CŒ± position. Primary deuterium KIE was used to probe the status of the CH bond break, whereas solvent KIE can probe that of the OH bond. The similar D(Vmax/Km) and Dkred values found for 2,4-hexadien-1-ol oxidation are consistent with cleavage of the CH bond being not masked by other kinetics steps (belonging either to the reductive half-reaction or the overall turnover) and with the absence of any forward or reverse commitment to catalysis. Therefore, the KIE on the rate of flavin reduction (Dkred) should be a direct measure of Dk2, which is the magnitude expected for the intrinsic KIE. However, in AAO oxidation of p-anisyl alcohol the D(Vmax/Km) value obtained was lower than those of DVmax and Dkred, and the cleavage of the CH bond does not appear to be the only rate-limiting step for catalysis. Stronger masking of bond cleavage has been found for cholesterol oxidase and glucose oxidase, with the reported KIE (around 2‚Äì3) significantly lower than their intrinsic values (32Kass I.J. Sampson N.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17990-18000Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 35Bright H.J. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 994-1003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Kass I.J. Sampson N.S. Bioorg. Medicinal Chem. Lett. 1998; 8: 2663-2668Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), whereas large substrate KIE values have been found for choline oxidase (27Gadda G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1650: 4-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 37Fan F. Gadda G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 2067-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The complexities described made difficult an unambiguous determination of the catalytic mechanisms of the two former oxidases, while that of choline oxidase has been investigated during recent years as a model flavooxidase (38Gadda G. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 13745-13753Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the mechanism proposed for AAO (Scheme 1), the observed complexity for p-anisyl alcohol oxidation must be due to the forward commitment to catalysis (k2/k‚àí1) (see supplemental Eq. S8). Because AAO flavin reduction is rate limiting (and nearly irreversible) and AAO affinity for O2 (KmO2 of 275 Œºm) (39Hern√°ndez A. Ferreira P. Mart√≠nez M.J. Romero A. Mart√≠nez A.T. Frago S. G√≥mez-Moreno C. Medina M. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Prensas Universitarias, Zaragoza2008: 303-308Google Scholar) is similar to the O2 concentration under atmospheric conditions at 25 ¬∞C, a negligible reverse commitment to catalysis (k‚àí2/k3[O2]) is expected. Regarding the status of the OH bond, a solvent KIE slightly larger than unity was observed on steady state parameters (D2OVmax, D2O(Vmax/Km)), whereas no viscosity contribution to such solvent KIE was observed. The increases of D2O(Vmax/Km)(D) and particularly the simultaneous substrate and solvent effects revealed by D,D2OVmax and D,D2O(Vmax/Km) (compared with DVmax and D(Vmax/Km) suggest that the solvent KIE must arise from substrate oxidation. These results differ substantially from those reported for other GMC oxidoreductases (such as glucose oxidase, cholesterol oxidase, and choline oxidase) where no solvent KIE has been detected upon substrate oxidation (32Kass I.J. Sampson N.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17990-18000Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 35Bright H.J. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 994-1003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Kass I.J. Sampson N.S. Bioorg. Medicinal Chem. Lett. 1998; 8: 2663-2668Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 37Fan F. Gadda G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 2067-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 38Gadda G. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 13745-13753Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Pre-steady state kinetic methods were additionally used to measure the substrate and solvent KIE on the reductive rate constant, kred (k2, Scheme 1), for p-anisyl alcohol and 2,4-hexadien-1-ol oxidations, without interference from other catalytic steps. The large KIE on kred (‚àº9) by both substrates permits us to establish that breaking of the CH bond occurs in the rate-limiting transition state for flavin reduction. These results, together with the multiple KIE observed with both substrates (D,D2Okred ‚àº13), are consistent with a concerted hydride transfer mechanism in which both the proton removed from the hydroxyl group and the hydride being transferred to the flavin are concomitantly in flight in the transition state. Such a hydride transfer mechanism with simultaneous activation by a catalytic base (Fig. 6) is supported by the structural model of AAO that suggest the substrate CH bond to be cleaved is placed in front of the N5 position of the isoalloxazine ring, and close to the histidine residue/s contributing to the OH bond cleavage (see supplemental Fig. S1). Substrate and solvent KIE studies on other members of the GMC oxidoreductase family have reported an asynchronous hydride transfer mechanism, in which the OH bond cleavage precedes the CH bond cleavage (20Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 625-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 26Menon V. Hsieh C.T. Fitzpatrick P.F. Bioorg. Chem. 1995; 23: 42-53Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In fact, in choline oxidase the rate of proton abstraction is suggested to be significantly faster than the hydride transfer. Conserved histidine residues have been proposed to act as catalytic bases in the former reaction in different GMC oxidoreductases (26Menon V. Hsieh C.T. Fitzpatrick P.F. Bioorg. Chem. 1995; 23: 42-53Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 31Rotsaert F.A. Renganathan V. Gold M.H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4049-4056Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 32Kass I.J.

Wohlfahrt G. Schomburg D. Hecht H.J. Kalisz H.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 553-559Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In choline oxidase, conserved His-466 has been shown to contribute to stabilize the substrate alkoxide, as well as the sulfite adduct, instead of acting as the catalytic base (28Ghanem M. Gadda G. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The synchronous mechanism here depicted for AAO discards stabilization of the alkoxide species during catalysis. This, together with the fact that this enzyme also fails in stabilizing a flavin adduct with sulfite (17Ferreira P. Medina M. Guill√©n F. Mart√≠nez M.J. van Berkel W.J.H. Mart√≠nez A.T. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 731-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), suggest that AAO does not stabilize intermediate interactions in its active site during catalysis, as found for other GMC oxidoreductases (41M√ºller F. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4007-4016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Massey V. M√ºller F. Feldberg R. Schuman M. Sullivan P.A. Howell L.G. Mayhew S.G. Matthews R.G. Foust G.P.

Additionally, the large Dkred value also rules out a radical mechanism for AAO catalysis, since the observed decrease in kred should result in a significant stabilization of any intermediate, as a semiquinone. This is in agreement with previous studies showing that AAO does not thermodynamically stabilize a flavin semiquinone radical (17Ferreira P. Medina M. Guill√©n F. Mart√≠nez M.J. van Berkel W.J.H. Mart√≠nez A.T. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 731-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This characteristic of AAO, as well as its inability to form a covalent adduct with sulfite, are unexpected since both properties are typical of most oxidases (44Massey V. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 473-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In summary, the kinetic data here presented for AAO are consistent with a mechanism involving formation of the Michaelis-Menten complex, flavin reduction by substrate oxidation and, reoxidation of the reduced enzyme by O2 with the concomitant release of the product. The reductive half-reaction is the rate-limiting step during AAO catalysis with both p-anisyl alcohol and 2,4-hexadien-1-ol. Moreover, the reductive half-reaction is consistent with a synchronous mechanism in which the OH and CH bond cleavages are in flight in the transition state, as shown by isotope effects. Therefore, AAO catalysis appears as an exception in alcohol oxidation by GMC oxidoreductases, where a general asynchronous mechanism has been proposed (38Gadda G. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 13745-13753Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Download .pdf (.19 MB) Help with pdf files"

GaTx2 slows ClC-2 activation by increasing the latency to first opening by nearly 8-fold but is unable to inhibit open channels, suggesting that this toxin inhibits channel activation gating. Finally, GaTx2 specifically inhibits ClC-2 channels, showing no inhibitory effect on a battery of other major classes of chloride channels and voltage-gated potassium channels. GaTx2 is the first peptide toxin inhibitor of any ClC protein. The high affinity and specificity displayed by this toxin will make it a very powerful pharmacological tool to probe ClC-2 structure/function. ClC proteins form a family of voltage-gated Cl‚àí channels and Cl‚àí/H+ exchangers that are found in animals, plants, and bacteria (1Jentsch T.J. Stein V. Weinreich F. Zdebik A.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 503-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar). These proteins are expressed on the plasma membrane and some intracellular membranes in both excitable and nonexcitable cells (1Jentsch T.J. Stein V. Weinreich F. Zdebik A.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 503-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar, 2Jentsch T.J. Neagoe I. Scheel O. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2005; 15: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). There are nine mammalian members of the ClC family that perform functions as varied as maintenance of membrane potential in neuronal cells (ClC-2) (3Haug K. Warnstedt M. Alekov A.K. Sander T. Ram√≠rez A. Poser B. Maljevic S. Hebeisen S. Kubisch C. Rebstock J. Horvath S. Hallmann K. Dullinger J.S. Rau B. Haverkamp F. Beyenburg S. Schulz H. Janz D. Giese B. M√ºller-Newen G. Propping P.

Stein V. Weinreich F. Zdebik A.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 503-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar, 4Fahlke C. Am. J. Physiol. Renal. Physiol. 2001; 280: F748-F757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and participation in lysosomal acidification (ClC-5 and ClC-6) (2Jentsch T.J. Neagoe I. Scheel O. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2005; 15: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Defects in the genes encoding ClC proteins are linked to a number of diseases including myotonia, epilepsy, Dent's disease, and Bartter's syndrome (1Jentsch T.J. Stein V. Weinreich F. Zdebik A.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 503-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar, 2Jentsch T.J. Neagoe I. Scheel O. Curr. Opin.

Genet. 2003; 33: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). It has been suggested recently that ClC-2 may play a role in constipation-associated irritable bowel disease as well as in atherosclerosis (5Cuppoletti J. Malinowska D.H. Tewari K.P. Li Q.J.

Res. 2007; 73: 198-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Most ClC channels show localized tissue expression; ClC-1, for example, is expressed solely in skeletal muscle, whereas ClC-Ka/b is localized to the kidney. ClC-2, on the other hand, is expressed nearly ubiquitously, suggesting that this channel plays an important, yet largely undefined, physiological role (1Jentsch T.J. Stein V. Weinreich F. Zdebik A.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 503-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar, 2Jentsch T.J. Neagoe I. Scheel O. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2005; 15: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). ClC proteins are structurally unrelated to cation channels, with the functional unit being a homodimer (1Jentsch T.J. Stein V. Weinreich F. Zdebik A.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 503-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar). ClC channels display two equidistant conductance levels for a single channel opening. In 2002, the crystal structure of a bacterial ClC protein from Salmonella typhimurium was solved, revealing a very complicated membrane topology consisting of 18 Œ±-helical units/subunit in the homodimer, only some of which fully traverse the membrane (7Dutzler R. Campbell E.B. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 415: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar). Examination of the crystal structure revealed no obvious pore, such as is evident in K+ channel structures, even though bound Cl‚àí ions were present near the proposed selectivity filter (7Dutzler R. Campbell E.B. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 415: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar, 8Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5649) Google Scholar). Shortly after the crystal structure was solved, it was shown that the bacterial ClC protein was actually a Cl‚àí/H+ exchanger and not a channel (9Accardi A. Miller C. Nature. 2004; 427: 803-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Comparison of the amino acid sequence of the bacterial ClC protein with that of the eukaryotic ClC channels ClC-0, -1, and -2 revealed only 22, 16, and 19% overall identity, respectively (data not shown). The divergence is largely in the cytoplasmic domains, which are absent in bacterial ClC proteins; sequence identity is much higher in the transmembrane domains. Single-channel gating in ClC proteins is complicated, involving both fast and slow gating processes, which are thought to involve separate regions of the protein (1Jentsch T.J. Stein V. Weinreich F. Zdebik A.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 503-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar). Fast gating controls the opening and closing of both protopores independently, operating on the millisecond time scale or faster. Through examination of the crystal structure and subsequent electrophysiological analysis, the fast gating process was revealed to involve a conserved glutamate residue deep within each pore (10Dutzler R. Campbell E.B. MacKinnon R. Science. 2003; 300: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). This acidic residue lies near a Cl‚àí-binding site and moves slightly to open the pathway in response to changes in membrane voltage and subsequent changes in occupancy of that site, thus providing the link between permeation and gating observed in ClC channels (4Fahlke C. Am. J. Physiol. Renal. Physiol. 2001; 280: F748-F757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, slow gating controls both pores simultaneously, operating on the hundreds of milliseconds to seconds time scale. Unlike with fast gating, the regions of the ClC protein involved in slow gating are still unknown, despite the availability of the bacterial ClC crystal structure. It is believed that the dimer interface contributes to slow gating, as well as the long cytoplasmic C-terminal domain, an isolated version of which was recently crystallized (11Duffield M. Rychkov G. Bretag A. Roberts M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 121: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 12Meyer S. Dutzler R.

Chem. 2004; 279: 13140-13147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, the conformational changes involved in the fast and slow gating processes are still largely unknown. Also, in both ClC-1 and -2, fast and slow gating are linked through an undetermined mechanism (14Saviane C. Conti F. Pusch M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 15de Santiago J.A. Nehrke K. Arreola J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 126: 591-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Despite the availability of the bacterial ClC protein crystal structure, our understanding of gating mechanisms and structural rearrangements of ClC proteins has lagged behind that of their cation channel counterparts. This is due in large part to a lack of useful pharmacological agents, such as peptide toxins, that may be used as tools. Toxins from venomous animals such as scorpions, snakes, and cone snails have been used for a number of years to define the permeation pathways and gating processes of cation channels (16Possani L.D. Merino E. Corona M. Bolivar F. Becerril B. Biochimie. 2000; 82: 861-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). However, no peptide toxins have been isolated that inhibit a ClC channel, and only one toxin has been isolated that inhibits any Cl‚àí channel of known molecular identity (17Fuller M.D. Thompson C.H. Zhang Z.R. Freeman C.S. Schay E. Szak√°cs G. Bakos E. Sarkadi B. McMaster D. French R.J. Pohl J. Kubanek J. McCarty N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 37545-37555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We recently showed that venom from the scorpion Leiurus quinquestriatus hebraeus contains a peptide component that inhibits the ClC-2 chloride channel (18Thompson C.H. Fields D.M. Olivetti P.R. Fuller M.D. Zhang Z.R. Kubanek J. McCarty N.A. J. Membr. Biol. 2005; 208: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Here, we report the isolation of this peptide toxin, its proteomic properties, and primary characteristics of the biophysical mechanism of inhibition. Xenopus oocytes were isolated as described previously (18Thompson C.H. Fields D.M. Olivetti P.R. Fuller M.D. Zhang Z.R. Kubanek J. McCarty N.A. J. Membr.

The oocytes were injected with cRNAs encoding ClC-1, -2, -3, and -4; CFTR 5The abbreviations used are: CFTRcystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulatorShB-IRShaker B K+ channel with inactivation removedTEVCtwo-electrode voltage clampTES2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acidLqhL. quinquestriatus hebraeusRP-HPLCreversed phase high performance liquid chromatographyGABACŒ≥-aminobutyric acid receptor, type CMALDI-MSmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometrypfpartially fractionatedDIDS4,4‚Ä≤-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2‚Ä≤-disulfonic acidDPCdiphenylamine-2-carboxylic acid. ; GABAC; Shaker B-IR; or KV1.2.

Venom from L. quinquestriatus hebraeus was obtained from Latoxan (France) and prepared as described in the supplemental materials or Ref. 18Thompson C.H. Fields D.M. Olivetti P.R. Fuller M.D. Zhang Z.R. Kubanek J. McCarty N.A. J. Membr. Biol. 2005; 208: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar. RP-HPLC was performed on partially fractionated scorpion venom (Lqh pf-venom) or on venom fractions. For toxin purification, venom was prepared at a concentration of 5 mg/ml in solution that contained 150 mm N-decanoyl-N-methylglucamine-Cl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm TES, and 10 mm Tris¬∑EGTA, pH 7.5. Subsequent fractions were resuspended in ND96 bath solution for the electrophysiological bio-assay (see the supplemental materials). All of the venom and fraction concentrations are stated as equivalent to the dried weight of whole venom. Standard two-electrode voltage-clamp (TEVC) techniques were used to study whole cell ClC-2 currents expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The currents were acquired using a GeneClamp 500B amplifier and pClamp 8.4 software (Axon Instruments/Molecular Devices, Union City, CA). The data were acquired at 2 kHz and filtered at a corner frequency of 500 Hz. Bath solutions and voltage protocols for TEVC experiments with ClC channels were as described in the supplemental materials or Ref. 18Thompson C.H. Fields D.M. Olivetti P.R. Fuller M.D. Zhang Z.R. Kubanek J. McCarty N.A. J. Membr. Biol. 2005; 208: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar. Inside-out multi-channel patch, inside-out and outside-out macropatch, and single-channel patch clamp experiments were performed as described previously (17Fuller M.D. Thompson C.H. Zhang Z.R. Freeman C.S. Schay E. Szak√°cs G. Bakos E. Sarkadi B. McMaster D. French R.J. Pohl J. Kubanek J. McCarty N.A. J. Biol.

Further details of electrophysiology methods are provided in the supplemental materials. To prevent loss of material, all of the solutions containing toxin were prepared immediately prior to experiments from a 20 Œºm stock. All of the solution lines and recording chambers were coated with bovine serum albumin to prevent loss of material because of sticking to plastic or glass. The active toxin was analyzed via MALDI-MS at the Georgia Institute of Technology Bioanalytical Mass Spectrometry Facility. Edman degradation was performed at the Emory University Microchemical and Proteomics Facility. Sequence analysis of the natural and modified (reduced and alkylated) peptides was performed using Applied Biosystems model Procise-cLC automated protein sequencer (491cLC CLC capillary protein sequencing system; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using the manufacturer's cycles with slight modifications. Prior to sequencing, natural and modified samples were desalted and purified via RP-HPLC. The homology model of the GaTx2 (GaTx2 is protected by a pending United States provisional patent, filed July 12, 2007, held by Georgia Tech Research Corporation) toxin was created using the Modeler 8v2 program, using neurotoxin P01 as the template structure (19Blanc E. Fremont V. Sizun P. Meunier S. Van Rietschoten J. Thevand A. Bernassau J.M. Darbon H. Proteins. 1996; 24: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The GaTx2 homology model was then minimized via a 5-ps, 2500-step simulation with NAMDv2 utilizing the charmm22 force field. Prior to minimization, disulfide bridges were patched to ensure that the disulfide bonds remained intact during energy minimization. Methods for peptide synthesis, purification, and folding have been described previously (20Chang N.S. French R.J. Lipkind G.M. Fozzard H.A. Dudley Jr., S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4407-4419Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 21Hui K. McIntyre D. French R.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 63-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Solid phase synthesis was performed by Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry, using the O-benzotriazole-N,N,N‚Ä≤,N‚Ä≤-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate/hydroxybenzotriazole/N,N-diisopropylethylamine method on an Applied Biosystems 431A synthesizer. Oxidative cyclization of the crude linear peptide was performed under equilibrating conditions. The cyclized peptide was then purified from the reaction mixture via RP-HPLC and characterized by MALDI-MS and analytical HPLC. The data are expressed as the means ¬± S.E. for n observations. The differences were determined to be significant when p < 0.05, using paired and unpaired Student's t tests. We recently showed that a peptide component of scorpion venom is capable of specifically inhibiting the ClC-2 chloride channel (18Thompson C.H. Fields D.M. Olivetti P.R. Fuller M.D. Zhang Z.R. Kubanek J. McCarty N.A. J. Membr. Biol. 2005; 208: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To isolate the active species from venom, we used RP-HPLC to separate the components of Lqh pf-venom, which contains only components smaller than 10 kDa. We tested each fraction for inhibition of ClC-2 channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes using TEVC. With initial separation performed using a C3 column, we observed that the fraction collected from 0 to 10 min (0‚Äì10% acetonitrile), Fraction A, retained activity similar to Lqh pf-venom (supplemental Fig. S1A, 45.7 ¬± 6.0% inhibition, fraction concentration of 0.1 mg/ml equivalent, n = 3, p = 0.01). The brief retention time of the active component on the C3 column suggested that the toxin is very hydrophilic; therefore, further separation of components and isolation of the active toxin were accomplished by RP-HPLC using a C18 column, as summarized in supplemental Fig. S1B. The fractions were collected every 5 min and tested using the same protocol as in the prior round of fractionation. The activity was spread over a period of 15 min of elution covering a range of 7‚Äì15% acetonitrile. The active fractions showed activity similar to that of venom and fraction A (supplemental Fig. S1B, 45.2 ¬± 5.0% inhibition, fraction concentration of 0.1 mg/ml equivalent, n = 10, p = 0.01). These fractions were pooled and subjected to a final round of RP-HPLC using a C18 column (Fig. 1A). In the final stage of isolation, the active peak eluted at ‚àº5% acetonitrile (Fig. 1A). This peak fully recapitulated the activity of Lqh pf-venom (64.2 ¬± 5.3% inhibition at 0.1 mg/ml equivalent, n = 4, p = 0.025). A conservative estimate of toxin concentration was obtained from Edman degradation of the isolated peptide. These results suggested that this dilution of venom (0.1 mg/ml equivalent) contained 10 nm isolated toxin. A dose-response curve constructed using native toxin suggested a KD of ‚àº50 pm and a Hill coefficient of ‚àº1 (VM = ‚àí160 mV) (supplemental Fig. S1C). MALDI-MS analysis showed that the active peak had a mass of 3.2 kDa (Fig. 1B), well within the range expected for scorpion toxin inhibitors. The primary structure of the peptide corresponding to the active peak was determined using N-terminal protein degradation and amino acid analysis (see supplemental materials). The toxin, which we named GaTx2 (gating modifier of anion channels 2), had a protein sequence of 1VSCEDCPDHCSTQKARAKCDNDKCVCEPI29 (Fig. 1C). MALDI-MS analysis of a reduced form of the toxin exhibited a mass shift of 348.2 Da (from 3191.29 to 3539.46 Da) upon reduction by dithiothreitol and modification of free cysteine residues by iodoacetimide, confirming that the six cysteine residues participate in three disulfide bonds in the folded toxin (data not shown). Comparison of this sequence to other known toxins revealed that GaTx2 bore 100% identity to a previously identified toxin called leiuropeptide II. This toxin was initially isolated in 1997, although no target was identified; it was initially postulated that this toxin was a K+ channel inhibitor based on disulfide bridge arrangement and spacing of critical lysine residues (22Buisine E. Wieruszeski J.M. Lippens G. Wouters D. Tartar A. Sautiere P. J. Pept. Res. 1997; 49: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Because it actually inhibits a Cl‚àí channel, we have renamed this toxin to avoid confusion. Of the toxins shown in Fig. 1C, only four have been shown to be active against ion channels: neurotoxin P01, which inhibits apamin-sensitive K+ channels (23Zerrouk H. Laraba-Djebari F. Fremont V. Meki A. Darbon H. Mansuelle P. Oughideni R. van Rietschoten J. Rochat H. Martin-Eauclaire M.F. Int. J. Pept. Protein. Res. 1996; 48: 514-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar); scyllatoxin, which inhibits Ca2+-activated K+ channels (24Chicchi G.G. Gimenez-Gallego G. Ber E. Garcia M.L. Winquist R. Cascieri M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10192-10197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and maurotoxin and OdK1, both of which inhibit KV1.2 (25Kharrat R. Mabrouk K. Crest M. Darbon H. Oughideni R. Martin-Eauclaire M.F. Jacquet G. el Ayeb M. Van Rietschoten J. Rochat H. Sabatier J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 26Abdel-Mottaleb Y. Clynen E. Jalali A. Bosmans F. Vatanpour H. Schoofs L. Tytgat J. FEBS. Lett. 2006; 580: 6254-6258Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The NMR structure of GaTx2 has been solved previously (22Buisine E. Wieruszeski J.M. Lippens G. Wouters D. Tartar A. Sautiere P. J. Pept. Res. 1997; 49: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar); however, the coordinates are not publicly available. Therefore, we created a homology model of GaTx2 based on the NMR structure of neurotoxin P01 (19Blanc E. Fremont V. Sizun P. Meunier S. Van Rietschoten J. Thevand A. Bernassau J.M. Darbon H. Proteins. 1996; 24: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), which bears 93% sequence identity to GaTx2, to make structural comparisons of GaTx2 to other known scorpion toxins (Fig. 1D, middle column). This model predicts that GaTx2 is composed of two Œ≤-strands and one Œ±-helix, which are connected via three disulfide bonds. The basic fold and disulfide connectivity are consistent with the published NMR structure of leiuropeptide II (22Buisine E. Wieruszeski J.M. Lippens G. Wouters D. Tartar A. Sautiere P. J. Pept. Res. 1997; 49: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This basic fold is highly conserved among numerous toxins isolated from various scorpion species (27Rodr√≠guez de la Vega R.C. Possani L.D. Toxicon. 2004; 43: 865-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). We compared the tertiary structure of GaTx2 to both scyllatoxin, a K+ channel inhibitor, and chlorotoxin, a toxin isolated from a related scorpion that is thought to inhibit an unidentified Cl‚àí channel from rat brain vesicles when reconstituted into lipid bilayers (24Chicchi G.G. Gimenez-Gallego G. Ber E. Garcia M.L. Winquist R. Cascieri M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10192-10197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28DeBin J.A. Maggio J.E. Strichartz G.R. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1993; 264: C361-C369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GaTx2 is noticeably more compact than both scyllatoxin (Fig. 1D, left column) and chlorotoxin (Fig. 1D, right column). Although the basic fold is similar between all three of these toxins, the tertiary structure itself is not enough to impart inhibitory activity against ClC-2, because chlorotoxin is unable to inhibit ClC-2 channels (18Thompson C.H. Fields D.M. Olivetti P.R. Fuller M.D. Zhang Z.R. Kubanek J. McCarty N.A. J. Membr. Biol. 2005; 208: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The primary and secondary structures of GaTx2 are also very different from GaTx1, a recently isolated peptide inhibitor active against the CFTR Cl‚àí channel, which also does not inhibit ClC-2 (17Fuller M.D. Thompson C.H. Zhang Z.R. Freeman C.S. Schay E. Szak√°cs G. Bakos E. Sarkadi B. McMaster D. French R.J. Pohl J. Kubanek J. McCarty N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 37545-37555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To determine whether the component that was isolated from venom is truly responsible for the observed inhibitory activity, we produced GaTx2 via solid phase chemical synthesis, as has been done for many other peptide inhibitors (20Chang N.S. French R.J. Lipkind G.M. Fozzard H.A. Dudley Jr., S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4407-4419Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 21Hui K. McIntyre D. French R.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 63-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The folded synthetic toxin shows the same mass as the purified native toxin (supplemental Fig. S2A, right panel). Activity of the synthetic form of GaTx2 was tested initially via TEVC using the same voltage protocols as used during the isolation of the toxin. TEVC experiments showed that 10 nm synthetic GaTx2 inhibited steady state ClC-2-mediated currents by 61.4 ¬± 8.0% at VM = ‚àí160 mV (n = 3) (supplemental Fig. S2, B and C). This activity was almost exactly the same as that observed for the native toxin at the same concentration (64.2 ¬± 5.3, n = 4) (supplemental Fig. S2C). We previously showed that Lqh pf-venom inhibited ClC-2 currents across a range of voltages, for both the quasi-steady state activation currents and the tail currents elicited by a voltage step to +40 mV (18Thompson C.H. Fields D.M. Olivetti P.R. Fuller M.D. Zhang Z.R. Kubanek J. McCarty N.A. J. Membr. Biol. 2005; 208: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To determine whether GaTx2 showed similar behavior, we tested the effect of 10 nm GaTx2 across a range of voltages from ‚àí160 to +60 mV. Similar to the activity of Lqh pf-venom, GaTx2 strongly inhibited inward ClC-2 currents and showed no effect at membrane potentials that do not activate the channel (Fig. 2A), drastically altering the current voltage relationship. There is also strong inhibition of tail currents at +40 mV from test potentials that strongly activate the channel (Fig. 2B), which could induce a shift in the V¬Ω of channel activation to more hyperpolarizing potentials. However, because ClC-2 never reaches full activation, even at strongly hyperpolarizing potentials, it is not possible to determine the effect of GaTx2 on the conductance/voltage relationship for ClC-2 by calculating a true V¬Ω. Lqh pf-venom also inhibited ClC-2 currents in a strongly voltage-dependent manner, with greater inhibition at more depolarizing potentials (18Thompson C.H. Fields D.M. Olivetti P.R. Fuller M.D. Zhang Z.R. Kubanek J. McCarty N.A. J. Membr. Biol. 2005; 208: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To determine whether synthetic GaTx2 showed similar voltage dependence of inhibition, we examined the fractional current remaining across a range of membrane potentials from ‚àí160 to ‚àí60 mV. The currents were inhibited by 62.5 ¬± 2.6% at ‚àí160 mV (n = 3), but at ‚àí60 mV the currents were inhibited by 86.6 ¬± 2.3% (n = 3, p = 0.006) (Fig. 3A), consistent with the behavior observed for Lqh pf-venom (18Thompson C.H. Fields D.M. Olivetti P.R. Fuller M.D. Zhang Z.R. Kubanek J. McCarty N.A. J. Membr. Biol. 2005; 208: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Also consistent with the activity of Lqh pf-venom is a lack of voltage-dependent inhibition of tail currents elicited at +40 mV (n = 3) (Fig. 3B). These results, therefore, suggest that GaTx2 is indeed the active component of Lqh pf-venom and inhibits via a similar mechanism. To determine whether GaTx2 could inhibit any other ion transport proteins, we tested the toxin on a number of related and unrelated ion channels and transporters, including members of the ClC family, other major chloride channels, and voltage-dependent K+ channels. We previously reported that Lqh pf-venom could not inhibit ClC-0 or ClC-1 (18Thompson C.H. Fields D.M. Olivetti P.R. Fuller M.D. Zhang Z.R. Kubanek J. McCarty N.A. J. Membr.

The reduced insulin responsiveness observed under ablation of the PtdIns(3,5)P(2)-synthesizing PIKfyve and its associated activator ArPIKfyve in 3T3L1 adipocytes suggests that dysfunction of the PtdIns(3,5)P(2)-specific phosphatase Sac3 may yield the opposite effect. Paradoxically, as uncovered recently, in addition to turnover Sac3 also supports PtdIns(3,5)P(2) biosynthesis by allowing optimal PIKfyve-ArPIKfyve association. These opposing inputs raise the key question as to whether reduced Sac3 protein levels and/or hydrolyzing activity will produce gain in insulin responsiveness. Here we report that small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous Sac3 by approximately 60%, which resulted in a slight but significant elevation of PtdIns(3,5)P(2) in 3T3L1 adipocytes, increased GLUT4 translocation and glucose entry in response to insulin. In contrast, ectopic expression of Sac3(WT), but not phosphatase-deficient Sac3(D488A), reduced GLUT4 surface abundance in the presence of insulin. Endogenous Sac3 physically assembled with PIKfyve and ArPIKfyve in both membrane and soluble fractions of 3T3L1 adipocytes, but this remained insulin-insensitive. Importantly, acute insulin markedly reduced the in vitro C8-PtdIns(3,5)P(2) hydrolyzing activity of Sac3. The insulin-sensitive Sac3 pool likely controls a discrete PtdIns(3,5)P(2) subfraction as the high pressure liquid chromatography-measurable insulin-dependent elevation in total [(3)H]inositol-PtdIns(3,5)P(2) was minor. Together, our data identify Sac3 as an insulin-sensitive phosphatase whose down-regulation increases insulin responsiveness, thus implicating Sac3 as a novel drug target in insulin resistance."

Its deregulation has been linked to human cancer. We show here that activation of PAK1 is necessary for protrusive activity during cell spreading. To investigate PAK1 activation dynamics at live protrusions, we developed a conformational biosensor, based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer. This novel PAK1 biosensor allowed the spatiotemporal visualization of PAK1 activation during spreading of COS-7 cells and during motility of normal rat kidney cells. By using this imaging approach in COS-7 cells, the following new insights on PAK1 regulation were unveiled. First, PAK1 acquires an intermediate semi-open conformational state upon recruitment to the plasma membrane. This semi-open PAK1 species is selectively autophosphorylated on serines in the N-terminal regulatory region but not on the critical threonine 423 in the catalytic site. Second, this intermediate PAK1 state is hypersensitive to stimulation by Cdc42 and Rac1. Third, interaction with PIX proteins contributes to PAK1 stimulation at membrane protrusions, in a GTPase-independent way.

Shepelev M. Chernoff J. J. Cell. Sci. 2004; 117: 4343-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). As a major downstream effector of the Rho family small GTPases Cdc42 and Rac1, PAK1 plays a fundamental role in controlling cell motility by linking a variety of extracellular signals to changes in actin cytoskeleton organization, cell shape, and adhesion dynamics. PAK1 is also involved in other fundamental cellular processes, including cell division, apoptosis, and gene transcription (2.Bokoch G.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 743-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Such a crucial role in cellular life explains the fact that this kinase is subjected to a complex and exquisite regulation capable of integrating a variety of signals according to specific physiological needs. Defects in this regulation may be fatal and a clear implication of PAK1 in human cancer has recently been emerging (3.Kumar R. Gururaj A.E. Barnes C.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 459-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). p21-activated kinase PAK inhibitory domain F√∂rster or fluorescence resonance energy transfer amino acid(s) yellow fluorescent protein cyan fluorescent protein red fluorescent protein monomeric RFP Cdc42/Rac interactive binding small interference RNA normal rat kidney minimal essential medium wild type. The biochemistry of PAK1 has been extensively studied (4.Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Biochem. J. 2005; 386: 201-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and its crystal structure solved (5.Lei M. Lu W. Meng W. Parrini M.C. Eck M.J. Mayer B.J. Harrison S.C. Cell. 2000; 102: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). The GTPase-binding domain, also found in several other Cdc42/Rac1 effectors, partially overlaps with a region exhibiting autoinhibitory features, the PAK inhibitory domain (PID). PAK1 molecules form trans-inhibited homodimers in which the N-terminal regulatory domain of one PAK1 molecule in the dimer binds and inhibits the C-terminal catalytic domain of the other. Binding of Cdc42/Rac1, by rearranging the folding of the regulatory domain, dissociates the dimers and leads to the active-state conformation in which the inhibitory segment is removed from the catalytic site (6.Parrini M.C. Lei M. Harrison S.C. Mayer B.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 73-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Activation is accompanied by autophosphorylation events, some of which are responsible for stabilizing the open active conformation. This is the case of serine 144 in the GTPase-binding domain (7.Chong C. Tan L. Lim L. Manser E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17347-17353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and threonine 423 in the activation loop of the catalytic site (8.Zenke F.T. King C.C. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32565-32573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). One challenge in PAK1 biology research is to understand how the spatial and temporal regulation of PAK1 is achieved in the context of living cells while executing their cellular activities. The development of live cell imaging technologies opened new perspectives, in particular with regard to the investigation of highly spatiotemporally coordinated processes such cell motility. To achieve protrusion formation and motility, PAK1 phosphorylates several cellular targets that are direct regulators of actin cytoskeleton dynamics, including MLCK (myosin II light chain kinase), LIM kinase (an inhibitor of the actin depolymerization factor cofilin), filamin (cross-linker of actin filaments) (2.Bokoch G.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 743-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar), and p41-Arc (a subunit of the actin nucleating and branching Arp2/3 complex) (9.Vadlamudi R.K. Li F. Barnes C.J. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Kumar R. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Activated PAK1 has been observed at the leading edge of lamellipodia by immunofluorescence techniques on fixed cells (10.Sells M.A. Pfaff A. Chernoff J. J. Cell. Biol. 2000; 151: 1449-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and a recent study pointed out a fundamental role of the Rac1/PAK1/LIMK/cofilin pathway in protrusion dynamics (11.Delorme V. Machacek M. DerMardirossian C. Anderson K.L. Wittmann T. Hanein D. Waterman-Storer C. Danuser G. Bokoch G.M. Dev. Cell. 2007; 13: 646-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). However, our knowledge of the fine dynamics of local and temporal regulation of PAK1 kinase activity in motile cells is very poor. It is known that cellular localization of PAK1 is controlled by interaction with some of its partners. The direct interaction with the Nck (12.Buday L. Wunderlich L. Tam√°s P. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 723-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and Grb2 (13.Puto L.A. Pestonjamasp K. King C.C. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9388-9393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) adaptors links PAK1 to tyrosine kinase receptors, whereas binding to PIXŒ±/Œ≤ recruits PAK1 to be a component of the PIX-GIT-paxillin multiprotein complex at focal adhesions (14.Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Loo T.H. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6354-6363Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). As a consequence of these interactions, PAK1, which is mainly cytosolic or associated with endo-vesicles (2.Bokoch G.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 743-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar), can be recruited to the plasma membrane or to focal adhesions in response to several extracellular stimuli. Recruitment to the plasma membrane is sufficient to activate PAK1 (15.Lu W. Katz S. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), however the exact mechanism of activation is unclear, particularly in regard to the role of the Cdc42/Rac1 GTPases (16.Bokoch G.M. Reilly A.M. Daniels R.H. King C.C. Olivera A. Spiegel S. Knaus U.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8137-8144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 17.Lu W. Mayer B.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 797-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The tight control of its activators Cdc42 and Rac1 constitutes another level of PAK1 regulation in space and time. The spatiotemporal visualization of the activity of Cdc42 and Rac1 was achieved thanks to the development of fluorescent biosensors, unveiling the precise coordination between the activation of these GTPases and cellular protruding activity, during motility (18.Itoh R.E. Kurokawa K. Ohba Y. Yoshizaki H. Mochizuki N. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6582-6591Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), membrane ruffling (19.Kurokawa K. Itoh R.E. Yoshizaki H. Nakamura Y.O. Matsuda M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1003-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), and cell spreading (20.Nalbant P. Hodgson L. Kraynov V. Toutchkine A. Hahn K.M. Science. 2004; 305: 1615-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Active GTP-bound Cdc42 and Rac1 are present in nascent protrusions, but absent at retractions and at the rear of motile cells, supporting the concept that they play master roles in protrusiveness. In this context, PAK1 is clearly a crucial downstream player, but the understanding of the dynamics of PAK1 activity has been hindered by the lack of appropriate experimental tools (21.Parrini M.C. Matsuda M. de Gunzburg J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 646-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the present study, we describe an innovative biosensor for PAK1 activity in living cells based on F√∂rster or fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) technology. Using this tool, we achieved the direct visualization of PAK1 activation during cell spreading and motility, and investigated the complexity of the signals regulating PAK1 in the cellular spatial context. Taken together with previous findings, our results lead to a comprehensive model for activation of PAK1 kinase at cell protrusions. The cDNA fragment encoding the region 65‚Äì545 (C terminus) of the PAK1 protein was cloned using PCR-based methods as a Sal1-Not1insert into the Xho1-Not1 sites of vectors from the pRaichu-Ras family (22.Mochizuki N. Yamashita S. Kurokawa K. Ohba Y. Nagai T. Miyawaki A. Matsuda M. Nature. 2001; 411: 1065-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar), which are derived from the pCAGGS eukaryotic expression plasmid. Pakabi encodes the following chimeric protein: YFP (aa 1‚Äì239), a spacer (Leu-Asp-Thr-Met), human PAK1 (aa 65‚Äì545), a spacer (Cys-Gly-Arg), and CFP (aa 1‚Äì237). Pakabix carries an extension, beyond the C terminus of Pakabi, comprising a spacer (Gly-Arg-Ser-Arg) and the C-terminal region of Ki-Ras4B (aa 169‚Äì188). In this study, we used enhanced YFP (T65G, V68L, S72A, M153T, V163A, S175G, and T203Y) or Venus (F46L, T65G, V68L, S72A, M153T, V163A, S175G, and T203Y) (23.Nagai T. Ibata K. Park E.S. Kubota M. Mikoshiba K. Miyawaki A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (2182) Google Scholar) as an acceptor and enhanced CFP (K26R, Y66W, D129G, N146I, M153T, V163A, N164H, and S175G) as a donor. Biosensors carrying the following PAK1 mutations were used: the substitution of amino acids 81‚Äì87 of the CRIB motif with the sequence ASAASAA abolishes GTPase binding, R193A mutant is deficient in PIX binding, and K299R mutant is kinase-dead (6.Parrini M.C.

Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The expression vector for YFP-PID was pCMV-YFP-PAK1-aa 83‚Äì149, provided by Dr. Dianqing Lu. The phospho-PAK1 (Ser-199/204) and phospho-PAK1 (Thr-423) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling (#2605 and #2601). Transient transfections of DNAs were done with Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen). siRNAs were purchased from Qiagen and transfected with HiPerfect (Qiagen). The target sequences were: AACGTACGCGGAATACTTCGA (siLuciferase), ACCCTAAACCATGGTTCTAAA (siPAK1 #1), AAGAGAAAGAGCGGCCAGAGA (siPAK1 #2), and CAGCTATTACTGAATTATAGA (siPAK2). Cell lysates for Western blot analysis were prepared in PAK lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium Œ≤-glycerophosphate) freshly supplemented with 1 Œºm okadaic acid (Alexis, #350-011-C025), 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science, #1836170). Cells were serum-starved for 2‚Äì3 h in MEM, trypsinized, re-suspended in MEM with 1% bovine serum albumin and 1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, washed once, kept for 15‚Äì60 min in suspension in MEM containing 1% bovine serum albumin, and re-plated on glass-bottom dishes coated with fibronectin (from human plasma, Sigma #F0895, 25 Œºg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline for ‚â•1 h 37 ¬∞C). Cell motility was monitored in wound-healing assays. Cells were grown to confluence on glass-bottom dishes coated with collagen (type I from rat tail, Interchim #207050357, 120 Œºg/ml in H2O for ‚â•1 h 37 ¬∞C), the monolayer was wounded with a tip, and the medium was changed to MEM with 2% fetal bovine serum. Cells were grown and imaged on 35-mm glass-bottom dishes (MatTek) coated with collagen or fibronectin (see above). Cells were imaged in MEM medium without phenol red. For the initial characterization of the Pakabi and Pakabix probes (Figs. 1B and 2B), cells were imaged on an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope equipped with a flat-field imaging spectrograph as previously described (25.Terai K. Matsuda M. EMBO. Rep. 2005; 6: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). After background subtraction, the peak intensities of CFP and YFP were used to calculate the YFP/CFP FRET ratio. For all the other experiments, cells were imaged on a Leica DMIRE2 inverted microscope, equipped with an HCX PL APO 63√ó oil immersion lens, motorized stage, CoolSNAP HQ2 camera (Roper Scientific), filter wheels (Ludl Electronic Products), ‚ÄúBox‚Äù heated chamber and ‚ÄúBrick‚Äù CO2 controller (Life Imaging Services), under the control of MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging). For dual-emission ratio imaging, we used a D440/20√ó excitation filter, a 455DCLP dichroic mirror, and the two D485/40m (CFP) and D535/30m (YFP) emission filters (Chroma, Filter Set #71007a). RFP acquisitions were obtained with the Leica Y3 cube. Cells were illuminated with a 103-watt mercury lamp (Osram) through a 5% transmission neutral density (ND) filter. The exposure time was 0.05‚Äì0.2 s with a camera binning of 4 √ó 4. The imaging processing was performed using MetaMorph and ImageJ. For one-time point acquisition experiments, the background-subtracted images were thresholded to define the whole cell surface, then the mean cell fluorescence intensities (CFP, YFP and, in some cases, RFP) were measured and the values were exported to Excel spreadsheets for mathematical treatment and statistics calculations. For time-lapse videos, acquisitions were every 30 s during COS-7 spreading and every 10 min during NRK motility assays. Background-subtracted CFP images were thresholded to create a time-course binary mask with a value of 0 outside the cell and a value of 1 inside the cell (20.Nalbant P. Hodgson L. Kraynov V. Toutchkine A. Hahn K.M. Science. 2004; 305: 1615-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). After multiplication of CFP and YFP images by this mask, the FRET of the biosensor is measured as the CFP/YFP ratio and represented using an eight-color scale code, as shown on the right of time-lapse figures with the upper and lower limits. The CFP/YFP ratio is used so that high ratio (red) corresponds to high PAK1 activity and low ratio (blue) to low PAK1 activity. Because the experimental conditions were kept constant, YFP/CFP ratios of FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2 were directly comparable to CFP/YFP ratios of Figs. 4, 6, and 7. COS-7 cells were allowed to spread on fibronectin-coated coverslips, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde 30 min after re-plating, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. Saturation and incubations with antibodies were carried out in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Primary antibodies were monoclonal HA.11 and anti-phospho-PAK1 (Ser-199/204, Cell Signaling #2605, dilution 1:50); secondary antibodies were Alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse and Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Slides were mounted with Prolong Gold (Invitrogen). We developed a biosensor for PAK1 activity by fusing a YFP and a CFP at the N and C termini of PAK1, respectively (Fig. 1A). According to this strategy, the profound rearrangements of PAK1's structure upon activation should reduce the proximity between the two fluorophores and therefore decrease FRET from the donor CFP to the acceptor YFP. Constructs, including full-length PAK1, displayed a weak FRET efficiency. Reasoning that the unstructured PAK1 N-terminal tail (5.Lei M. Lu W. Meng W. Parrini M.C. Eck M.J. Mayer B.J. Harrison S.C. Cell. 2000; 102: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) may cause an unwanted flexibility of the spatial orientation of YFP, thereby hindering efficient energy transfer, we tested various N-terminal deletions and succeeded in improving the FRET properties of the biosensor (supplemental Tables S1 and S2). The best construct in terms of FRET efficiency and dynamics, referred to as Pakabi (PAK1 activation biosensor) in the rest of this report, comprised residues 65‚Äì545 (C terminus) of PAK1. The deleted N-terminal region is not required for PAK1 dimerization (5.Lei M. Lu W. Meng W. Parrini M.C. Eck M.J. Mayer B.J. Harrison S.C. Cell. 2000; 102: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), nor the fusion to YFP and CFP interfere with the ability of PAK1 to dimerize (data not shown). However, as consequence of the unavoidable N-terminal truncation, the binding sites for Nck and Grb2 adaptors are lost in the biosensor, which is therefore not suitable to study adaptor-dependent effects. Experiments comparing the co-expression of single YFP and CFP fusion constructs with the double-fused Pakabi showed that FRET occurs intra-molecularly; the hypothetical component due to inter-molecular FRET between the two molecules of PAK1 dimers is negligible (supplemental Table S3). This indicates that FRET changes would indeed reflect the modifications of PAK1 conformation and not dimer dissociation, even though these two events are closely linked. The activation of Pakabi, either by co-expression with Cdc42V12 (fused to mRFP (26.Campbell R.E. Tour O. Palmer A.E. Steinbach P.A. Baird G.S. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 7877-7882Crossref PubMed Scopus (2006) Google Scholar)) or by the constitutively activating L107F mutation, led to the expected PAK1 autophosphorylation events (as demonstrated with specific antibodies directed against phospho-serines 199/204 and phospho-threonine 423) as well as to a substantial decrease in FRET (measured as the YFP/CFP ratio), hence correlating biochemical and FRET readouts (Fig. 1B). Pakabi was an actual quantitative sensor of PAK1 activation, as shown in dose-response experiments in which the amount of the activator Cdc42V12 and level of Pakabi FRET were correlated (Fig. 1C). Control experiments further confirmed the specificity of the FRET response: a Pakabi ‚ÄúCRIB‚Äù mutant, in which the GTPase binding site had been altered, no longer responded to Cdc42V12 (Fig. 1D); with FLAG-Cdc42V12 the level of FRET was decreased as with mRFP-fused Cdc42V12, excluding the possibility that mRFP may act as unwanted acceptor of YFP (Fig. 1E). In conclusion, the FRET of Pakabi is a reliable indicator of the conformational and activation status of its PAK1 kinase component. This novel tool enables us for the first time to investigate signals regulating PAK1 activity in intact living cells. Independent studies have indicated that the recruitment of PAK1 to membranes stimulates its kinase activity 10- to 20-fold (15.Lu W. Katz S. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 16.Bokoch G.M. Reilly A.M. Daniels R.H. King C.C. Olivera A. Spiegel S. Knaus U.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8137-8144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), but the exact mechanism underlying this activation remains a subject of debate. We therefore addressed Pakabi to the plasma membrane by adding to its C terminus the C-terminal region and CAAX box of Ki-Ras. This novel biosensor, called Pakabix, was efficiently targeted to the plasma membrane (Fig. 2A). As expected, it displayed a lower FRET than the cytosolic Pakabi, yet the extent of this decrease was modest (6%), although highly significant (p value < 0.0001), indicating that membrane recruitment induced only a partial structural rearrangement of PAK1. Addition of Cdc42V12 led to further conformational changes of Pakabix as shown by the substantial decrease in FRET (26%) (Fig. 2B). Analysis of the phosphorylation status of PAK1 by Western blotting showed that Pakabix was partially phosphorylated on serines 199/204, but lacked phosphorylation of threonine 423 in the activation loop (Fig. 2B). Noteworthy, the degree of Ser-199/204 phosphorylation was dependent on the cellular concentration of Pakabix (Fig. 2C), suggesting that trans-phosphorylation on serine residues may result from the spatial proximity of PAK1 molecules upon recruitment to plasma membrane. We obtained the same phosphorylation pattern with a full-length PAK1 (not fused to YFP/CFP), either cytosolic or membrane-targeted (by a N-terminal myristoylation signal derived from v-Src) (Fig. 2D), thereby showing that these activation responses of the FRET probe are not an artifact due to its construction, and indeed reflect those of intact PAK. We compared the respective sensitivities of Pakabi and Pakabix to activation by Cdc42 or Rac1 (mRFP-Cdc42V12 or mRFP-Rac1V12 fusion proteins, respectively). To this end, we plotted for each cell the expression level of Cdc42V12 or Rac1V12 (measured by RFP fluorescence) against the activation level of PAK1 (assessed by the YFP/CFP ratio of the biosensors) (Fig. 2E). This FRET-based approach allowed for the first time a direct quantitative analysis of the stimulation by Cdc42 or Rac1 of their effector PAK1 at the resolution of a single-cell. The level of Pakabi's FRET decreased only slowly with the increase of Cdc42V12 or Rac1V12 expression, typically exhibiting a high cell-to-cell variability, indicating that relatively high amounts of active GTPase were required to stimulate cytosolic PAK1. In contrast, efficient activation of Pakabix was achieved by much lower amounts of active Cdc42 or Rac1 in a narrow dynamic range of GTPase concentration. As previously observed in biochemical approaches (6.Parrini M.C. Lei M. Harrison S.C. Mayer B.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 73-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 15.Lu W. Katz S. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), Cdc42 appeared more potent than Rac1 in stimulating PAK1. In a control experiment with very high amounts of membrane-targeted mRFP alone, Pakabix FRET did not display any decrease (data not shown), excluding the possibility of unwanted energy transfer from the YFP of the biosensor to the mRFP fused to GTPases. Taken together these results support the existence at the plasma membrane of an intermediate semi-open state of PAK1, which exhibits enhanced sensitivity to stimulation by GTPases. The kinase activity of PAK1 is stimulated upon cell spreading (27.Price L.S. Leng J. Schwartz M.A. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1863-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). To investigate the functional role of PAK1 activation during this protrusive response, we depleted PAK1 protein using an siRNA approach in HEK-HT cells, and we quantified the spreading efficiency on fibronectin-coated dishes by measuring the area of individual cells 5 h after re-plating. Cells depleted of PAK1 with two independent siRNAs displayed a clear inhibition of spreading, whereas control or PAK2-depleted cells did not (Fig. 3A). Similar results were obtained using another cell system, the RPE1 cell line (supplemental Fig. S1). Our data are consistent with previously published results showing that, in T47D breast carcinoma cells, depletion of PAK1, but not PAK2, inhibited heregulin-induced lamellipodia formation (28.Coniglio S.J. Zavarella S. Symons M.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 4162-4172Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). PAK1 is thus required not only for protrusion formation of cancer cells, but also for that of immortalized non-transformed cells. Somehow puzzling, macrophages and fibroblasts derived from PAK1-null mice have been reported to display a faster cell spreading than wild-type cells (29.Smith S.D. Jaffer Z.M. Chernoff J. Ridley A.J. J. Cell. Sci. 2008; 121: 3729-3736Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 30.ten Klooster J.P. Jaffer Z.M. Chernoff J. Hordijk P.L. J. Cell. Biol. 2006; 172: 759-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), confirming the complexity of the role of PAK1 in cellular morphodynamics. In parallel, we tested the effect of inhibiting the enzymatic kinase activity of endogenous PAK1 by expressing in COS-7 cells its PID trans-inhibitory domain (aa 83‚Äì149) (31.Li Z. Hannigan M. Mo Z.

Chong C. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3B, 4 h after re-plating, the cell area was significantly decreased in cells expressing high levels of YFP-PID, in comparison to cells expressing YFP alone. These results clearly pointed out an important and specific role of PAK1 activity in cell spreading. Taking advantage of the Pakabi biosensors, we investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics of PAK1 activation during protrusion formation in spreading COS-7 cells. We could not observe any significant spatiotemporal changes in FRET with cytosolic Pakabi (data not shown), but the use of membrane-targeted Pakabix highlighted a dynamic activation of PAK1: high level of CFP/YFP ratio, i.e. PAK1 activity, were observed at the expanding cell periphery (Fig. 4A and supplemental movie 1). Note that, because we have validated in the first part of this article that FRET (YFP/CFP) decrease corresponds to PAK1 activation, in the second part we use the inverted CFP/YFP ratio as direct measure of PAK1 activity (25.Terai K. Matsuda M. EMBO. Rep. 2005; 6: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Whole cell PAK1 activity was high at the beginning of spreading and decreased gradually over the time, correlating well with the kinetics of cell spreading as as"

Following mitochondrial import, this problem is circumvented in Trypanosoma brucei by specifically editing the tRNA(Trp) anticodon to UCA, which can now decode the predominant mitochondrial UGA tryptophan codons. This tRNA also undergoes an unusual thiolation at position 33 of the anticodon loop, the only known modification at U33 in any tRNA. In other organisms, tRNA thiolation is mediated by the cysteine desulfurase, Nfs1 (IscS). However, T. brucei encodes two Nfs homologues, one cytoplasmic and the other mitochondrial. We show by a combination of RNA interference and Northern and Western analyses that the mitochondria-targeted TbNfs, and not TbNfs-like protein, is essential for thiolation of both cytosolic and mitochondrial tRNAs. Given the exclusive mitochondrial localization of TbNfs, how it mediates thiolation in the cytoplasm remains unclear. Furthermore, thiolation specifically affects thiolated tRNA stability in the cytoplasm but more surprisingly acts as a negative determinant for the essential C to U editing in T. brucei. This provides a first line of evidence for mitochondrial C to U editing regulation in this system."

In the absence of ferrichrome, Arn1p is sorted directly from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the vacuolar lumen via the vacuolar protein-sorting pathway. Arn1p is mis-sorted to the plasma membrane in cells lacking Gga2p, a monomeric clathrin-adaptor protein involved in vesicular transport from the TGN.

In a ubiquitin-binding mutant of Gga2, Arn1p accumulated on the vacuolar membrane in a ubiquitinated form. The yeast epsins Ent3p and Ent4p were also involved in TGN-to-vacuole sorting of Arn1p. Amino-terminal sequences of Arn1p were required for vacuolar protein sorting, as mutation of ubiquitinatable lysine residues resulted in accumulation on the vacuolar membrane, and mutation of either a THN or YGL sequence resulted in mis-sorting to the plasma membrane.

The movement of small molecules across cellular membranes is a crucial process for cells and is entirely dependent on the activity of polytopic integral membrane proteins located in the plasma membrane or in the membranes of intracellular organelles. The activity of these transporters is subject to multiple levels of regulation. In both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, transporters are regulated at the transcriptional level. Eukaryotes also employ post-translational mechanisms to regulate the activity of transporters, frequently by altering their intracellular trafficking patterns. The mammalian glucose transporter GLUT4 (1.Hou J.C. Pessin J.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2007; 19: 466-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and the water channel AQP2 (2.Takata K.

Arn1p is one of four homologous transporters in yeast that facilitate the uptake of extracellular siderophore-iron chelates, which are important nutritional sources of iron in unicellular organisms (8.Philpott C.C. Protchenko O. Eukaryot. Cell. 2008; 7: 20-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Arn1p and the homologous Arn3p specifically recognize and take up FC-iron chelates, and both of these transporters demonstrate intracellular trafficking patterns that are controlled in part by the presence of their siderophore substrates (9.Erpapazoglou Z. Froissard M. Nondier I. Lesuisse E. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Belgareh-Touze N. Traffic. 2008; 9: 1372-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 10.Kim Y. Yun C.W. Philpott C.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3632-3642Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). ARN1 is transcriptionally activated under conditions of iron deficiency. If FC is not present in the medium, Arn1p is rapidly sorted from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the vacuole for degradation, via the vacuolar protein-sorting (VPS) pathway. If FC is present and gains access to the endosomal compartment via fluid phase endocytosis, FC binds to a receptor domain on the extracytosolic face of Arn1, which leads to the trafficking of a portion of Arn1p to the plasma membrane (11.Kim Y. Lampert S.M. Philpott C.C. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 952-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). At concentrations of FC high enough to stimulate transport, Arn1 cycles on and off the plasma membrane. A common feature of the intracellular trafficking of Arn1p and other transporters is passage through the TGN, where cargo proteins are sorted into vesicles or tubular carriers destined for the plasma membrane, endosomes, or vacuoles (12.De Matteis M.A. Luini A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 273-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Trafficking from the TGN to endosomes and vacuoles involves the sorting of cargo proteins into clathrin-coated vesicles, and this sorting requires several types of adaptor proteins that localize to the TGN, recognize cargo destined for endosomes, and recruit the components of the clathrin coat (13.Bonifacino J.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In yeast, these adaptors include the epsin-domain proteins Ent3 and Ent5 (14.Copic A. Starr T.L. Schekman R. Mol.

These adaptor proteins are likely recruited to the TGN via interactions with phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (17.Wang J. Sun H.Q. Macia E. Kirchhausen T. Watson H. Bonifacino J.S. Yin H.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2646-2655Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and the small GTPases of the ADP-ribosylation factor family. The Gga proteins have a conserved, modular domain structure that mediates their interactions with protein and lipid-binding partners (Fig. 1A) (13.Bonifacino J.S. Nat. Rev. Mol.

The amino-terminal VHS domain of mammalian Ggas binds to an acidic di-leucine sorting signal defined by the consensus motif DXXLL, which is located in the cytosolic domain of cargo proteins; however, in yeast, cargo proteins do not contain this type of motif, and the residues of the VHS domain of human Ggas that bind this motif are not conserved (20.Misra S.

The GAT domain of human Gga3 also contains two binding sites for ubiquitin, and a number of conserved hydrophobic amino acid residues in the carboxyl-terminal half of the GAT domain have been shown to directly contribute to ubiquitin binding at the two sites (22.Bilodeau P.S.

Volland C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Andr√© B. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) permeases or a mutant form of the Pma1 ATPase (30.Pizzirusso M. Chang A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2401-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), is reportedly required for the efficient trafficking of the transporters from the TGN to the vacuole. Direct Gga binding to ubiquitinated lysine residues on the cargo proteins at the TGN is thought to permit the specific sorting of the proteins into clathrin-coated vesicles destined for endosomes and the vacuole. A recent report, however, indicated that ubiquitination of Gap1 was not required for Golgi to endosome sorting (31.Lauwers E. Jacob C. Andr√© B. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 185: 493-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Endosomal proteins destined for the vacuole are delivered via the multivesicular body (MVB) (32.Hurley J.H. Emr S.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2006; 35: 277-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Here, integral membrane proteins and lipids in the late endosome are sorted into invaginating membranes that form vesicles within the lumen of the MVB. The MVB then fuses with the vacuole and the intraluminal vesicles are delivered into the vacuolar lumen, where they are rapidly degraded. Proteins on the outer membrane of the MVB, which were not sorted into the luminal vesicles, then appear on the limiting membrane of the vacuole or are recycled back to the TGN or plasma membrane. Ubiquitin is the signal that allows cargo proteins to be sorted into the MVB (32.Hurley J.H. Emr S.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2006; 35: 277-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 33.Belgareh-Touz√© N. L√©on S. Erpapazoglou Z. Stawiecka-Mirota M. Urban-Grimal D. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2008; 36: 791-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Ubiquitinated integral membrane proteins in endosomes are recognized by the ubiquitin binding surfaces of the Vps27-Hse1 complex and the ESCRT-I complex, which then recruit the ESCRT-II and ESCRT-III complexes, directing the ubiquitinated cargo into invaginating vesicles of the MVB. Although the role of ubiquitin in the sorting of cargo protein into the MVB has been clearly demonstrated, recent work suggests that the mechanism of Gga-dependent sorting of cargo proteins into clathrin-coated vesicles at the TGN is not entirely explained on the basis of ubiquitin binding. Arn1 also requires ubiquitination and the activity of Gga2 for efficient TGN-to-vacuole sorting; however, recent work raises the possibility that ubiquitination of Arn1 is not necessary for interaction with Gga2 (34.Kim Y. Deng Y. Philpott C.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 1790-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Cells carrying a temperature-sensitive form of Rsp5, the ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase that modifies integral membrane proteins in yeast, fail to sort Arn1 into the MVB and accumulate nonubiquitinated Arn1 on the vacuolar membrane. This finding indicates that in the absence of ubiquitination, Arn1 traffics from the TGN to the limiting membrane of the MVB, but it is not incorporated into the luminal vesicles of the MVB. In contrast, cells lacking Gga2 accumulate a large portion of Arn1 on the plasma membrane, and this Arn1 fails to enter the VPS pathway at all. Cells with mutations in both GGA2 and RSP5 also accumulate Arn1 on the plasma membrane. These findings indicate that Gga2 is required for Arn1 to efficiently enter the VPS pathway and suggest that Gga2 might be able to interact with Arn1 at the TGN without binding ubiquitin. In these studies we address the question of how Gga2 recognizes Arn1 at the TGN. We have examined the trafficking of Arn1 in cells expressing a mutant form of Gga2 that does not bind ubiquitin and the trafficking of mutant forms of Arn1 that exhibit a loss of ubiquitin modification. We find that Gga2 acts at two sequential steps in the TGN-to-vacuole trafficking of Arn1 as follows: ubiquitin-independent transport from the TGN to the vacuoles and ubiquitin-dependent targeting to the MVB pathway.

The following mouse monoclonal antibodies were used: HA.11 (Covance), anti-GFP (Roche Applied Science), and anti-ubiquitin (P4D1) (Covance). Anti-Pma1 and anti-Vps10 antibodies were purchased from Invitrogen. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (Amersham Biosciences) or Cy3-conjugated (Jackson ImmunoResearch) anti-mouse IgG was used as secondary antibodies. Strain AH109 was transformed with the indicated plasmids. Transformants were spotted in serial 10-fold dilutions on synthetic complete media lacking the indicated amino acids and incubated for 3 days at 30 ¬∞C. Yeast were grown at 30 ¬∞C to an optical density of 0.6 in 100 ml of iron-poor medium with no FC added. Yeast cells were harvested and resuspended in 500 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide) containing 2.5√ó complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and then 1 volume of acid-washed glass beads was added. The cells were disrupted by vigorous vortexing 10 times at 1 min each and with 1 min of chilling on ice between each vortexing. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 500 √ó g, and the supernatant then subjected to an 18,000 √ó g centrifugation at 4 ¬∞C for 1 h. The membrane pellet was solubilized in lysis buffer containing 2.5√ó complete protease inhibitor mixture, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5% dodecyl maltoside at 4 ¬∞C for 30 min and then subjected to an 18,000 √ó g centrifugation at 4 ¬∞C for 10 min. Solubilized membrane proteins were quantitated, and equal amounts were incubated with anti-GFP or anti-HA antibody at 4 ¬∞C for 1 h, followed by incubation with 20 Œºl of pre-equilibrated Dynabeads Protein G (Invitrogen) at 4 ¬∞C for 1 h. The resin was then washed six times with lysis buffer and resuspended in 40 Œºl of NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen). Bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (NuPAGE Norvex 4‚Äì12% BisTris gradient gel, Invitrogen) and revealed by immunoblotting followed by chemiluminescent detection (Amersham Biosciences). For ubiquitin binding experiments, Lys-63 linked polyubiquitin chains (Enzo Life Sciences) at 5 Œºm (as monomer) were incubated with immune complexes at 4 ¬∞C for 1 h. Following washes the bound proteins were eluted in SDS samples buffer and subjected to Western blotting. Yeast were grown in 100 ml of iron-poor medium at 30 ¬∞C to an optical density of 0.3 and grown for an additional 2 h with either no FC or with 0.02 or 5 Œºm FC added. Surface binding assays were performed as described (39.Moore R.E. Kim Y. Philpott C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 5664-5669Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, yeast cells were harvested, treated with 20 mm NaN3/KF on ice for 15 min, and then washed with 5 ml of ice-cold binding buffer (50 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.5, 5% glucose, 1 mm bathophenanthroline disulfonate, 20 mm NaN3/KF). 500 Œºl of 10 A600 cells were mixed with 100 nm [55Fe-FC] in binding buffer on ice with gently shaking for 15 min. Cells were again washed with binding buffer, and retained [55Fe-FC] was measured. To visualize cells expressing GFP-tagged proteins, yeast cells were grown overnight in iron-poor medium at 30 ¬∞C to early log phase (A600 = 0.3) and grown for an additional 2 h with either no FC or 0.02 or 5 Œºm FC added. Images were obtained on Zeiss fluorescence microscope with Hamamatsu charge-coupled digital camera controlled by IPLabs software. The GFP signal was visualized by excitation at 488 nm and collection with a 505-nm filter. Fluorescence images were processed using Adobe Photoshop. Subcellular fractionation and sucrose density gradient analysis were performed as described previously (40.Kaiser C.A. Chen E.J. Losko S. Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular and Cell Biology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2002: 325-338Google Scholar). Briefly, 250 ml of yeast cultures were grown to mid-logarithmic phase (A600 = 0.5) in iron-poor medium at 30 ¬∞C. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 200 ml of ice-cold STE10 (25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 10% (w/v) sucrose) containing 2.5√ó complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and 1 mm dithiothreitol, and then 1 volume of acid-washed glass beads was added. The cells were disrupted by vigorous vortexing 8 times for 1 min each and 1 min chilling on ice between each vortexing. After a clearing spin at 500 √ó g, the lysates were loaded onto a 12-ml sucrose gradient (20‚Äì60%) and spun at 100,000 √ó g for 17 h at 4 ¬∞C. Fourteen fractions were collected from the top of the gradient. Aliquots were loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels and subjected to immunoblot analysis.

https://openalex.org/W2067816479,"Several peptide families, including insect antimicrobial peptides, plant protease inhibitors, and ion channel gating modifiers, as well as blockers from scorpions, bear a common CSalphabeta scaffold. The high structural similarity between two peptides containing this scaffold, drosomycin and a truncated scorpion beta-toxin, has prompted us to examine and compare their biological effects. Drosomycin is the most expressed antimicrobial peptide in Drosophila melanogaster immune response. A truncated scorpion beta-toxin is capable of binding and inducing conformational alteration of voltage-gated sodium channels. Here, we show that both peptides (i) exhibit anti-fungal activity at micromolar concentrations; (ii) enhance allosterically at nanomolar concentration the activity of LqhalphaIT, a scorpion alpha toxin that modulates the inactivation of the D. melanogaster voltage-gated sodium channel (DmNa(v)1); and (iii) inhibit the facilitating effect of the polyether brevetoxin-2 on DmNa(v)1 activation. Thus, the short CSalphabeta scaffold of drosomycin and the truncated scorpion toxin can maintain more than one bioactivity, and, in light of this new observation, we suggest that the biological role of peptides bearing this scaffold should be carefully examined. As for drosomycin, we discuss the intriguing possibility that it has additional functions in the fly, as implied by its tight interaction with DmNa(v)1."

https://openalex.org/W2065897005,"Efficient export of secretory alkaline phosphatase (ALP) from the endoplasmic reticulum depends on the conserved transmembrane sorting adaptor Erv26p/Svp26p. In the present study we investigated the mechanism by which Erv26p couples pro-ALP to the coat protein complex II (COPII) export machinery. Site-specific mutations were introduced into Erv26p, and mutant proteins were assessed in cell-free assays that monitor interactions with pro-ALP cargo and packaging into COPII vesicles. Mutations in the second and third loop domains of Erv26p inhibited interaction with pro-ALP, whereas mutations in the C-terminal tail sequence influenced incorporation into COPII vesicles and subcellular distribution. Interestingly mutations in the second loop domain also influenced Erv26p homodimer associations. Finally we demonstrated that Ktr3p, a cis-Golgi-localized mannosyltransferase, also relies on Erv26p for efficient COPII-dependent export from the endoplasmic reticulum. These findings demonstrate that Erv26p acts as a protein sorting adaptor for a variety of Type II transmembrane cargo proteins and requires domain-specific interactions with both cargo and coat subunits to promote efficient secretory protein transport."

If are lower in cells isolated from Hcn2‚àí/‚àí mice, although, interestingly, the modulatory effects of cAMP on If are similar to those measured in wild-type cells (16Ludwig A. Budde T. Stieber J. Moosmang S. Wahl C. Holthoff K. Langebartels A. Wotjak C. Munsch T. Zong X. Feil S. Feil R. Lancel M. Chien K.R. Konnerth A. Pape H.C. Biel M. Hofmann F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 216-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). These results were interpreted as suggesting that HCN2 is primarily responsible for the cAMP-insensitive component of the cardiac pacemaker current (16Ludwig A. Budde T. Stieber J. Moosmang S. Wahl C. Holthoff K. Langebartels A. Wotjak C. Munsch T. Zong X. Feil S. Feil R. Lancel M. Chien K.R. Konnerth A. Pape H.C. Biel M. Hofmann F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 216-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). In contrast, targeted deletion of Hcn4 is embryonic lethal (17Stieber J. Herrmann S. Feil S. L√∂ster J. Feil R. Biel M. Hofmann F. Ludwig A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 15235-15240Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), suggesting that HCN4 is required for early development. Subsequent studies, however, demonstrated that the loss of HCN4 in adult mouse heart is not lethal and, in addition, that If densities are reduced markedly (but not eliminated) in Hcn4‚àí/‚àí sinoatrial nodal cells (18Herrmann S. Stieber J. St√∂ckl G. Hofmann F. Ludwig A. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4423-4432Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Taken together, the analyses of these genetically engineered mouse models suggest roles for both HCN4 and HCN2 in the generation of cardiac If channels. Expression of HCN2 or HCN4 (alone) in heterologous (HEK-293) cells, however, produces (homomeric) HCNX-encoded currents with activation thresholds more negative than those observed for (native) If in cardiac cells (19Qu J. Altomare C. Bucchi A. DiFrancesco D. Robinson R.B. Pflugers Arch. 2002; 444: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In addition, the currents produced on co-expression of HCN1 and HCN2 display gating kinetics similar to cardiac pacemaker currents (20Xue T. Marb√°n E. Li R.A. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1267-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 21Ulens C. Tytgat J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6069-6072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). These observations suggest the interesting possibility that functional myocardial HCN channels reflect the heteromeric assembly of HCN subunits. Consistent with this suggestion, resonance energy transfer experiments suggest that homomeric and heteromeric HCN channels are present in native tissues (22Whitaker G.M. Angoli D. Nazzari H. Shigemoto R. Accili E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 22900-22909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Exploiting immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses, the experiments here reveal that HCN2 co-immunoprecipitates with HCN4 from adult (mouse) heart, suggesting that cardiac HCN channels reflect the heteromeric assembly of HCN2 and HCN4 subunits. In addition, the biochemical data presented reveal that HCN2 protein expressed in adult (mouse) heart is a C-terminal-truncated protein, lacking the cAMP binding domain, further suggesting that cAMP modulation of functional cardiac HCN channels is mediated by HCN4. Mouse HCN2 and HCN4 cDNAs in pCI (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were obtained from Dr. Richard Robinson (Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons). The HCN2 and HCN4 cDNAs were subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). A hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag was added at the C terminus of the HCN2 protein with the following pair of primers: 5‚Ä≤-TAT GAC CGT GAGA TGG TGC-3‚Ä≤ and 5‚Ä≤-GC TCT AGA GC TCA AGC GTA ATC TGG AAC ATC GTA TGG GTA CAA GTT GGA AGA GAG GCG-3‚Ä≤, and this construct was also subcloned into the pcDNA3. The C-terminal HCN2 deletion construct, HCN2ŒîC, was generated using primers 5‚Ä≤-CAC CAG TGG GAA GAG ATT TTC-3‚Ä≤ and 5‚Ä≤-TCT AGA TCA GAC GAA GTT GGG GTC-3‚Ä≤. After the subcloning, the sequences of all constructs were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing (Biotech Center of the University of Wisconsin). The HCN2ŒîC cDNA was then subcloned into the 5‚Ä≤-end of a bicistronic vector (pIRESGFP1, kind gift from David Johns, Johns Hopkins University). This construct allowed the expression of HCN2ŒîC and EGFP under control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. HEK-293 cells, obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin in a 37¬∞ C 5% CO2, 95% air incubator as previously described (23Nagatomo T.

Cells were transfected at ‚àº80% confluence using Fugene (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For electrophysiological experiments, ‚àº1 √ó 105 HEK-293 cells were seeded on 35-mm dishes with 1.5-ml culture media. For biochemical experiments, ‚àº6 √ó 105 HEK-293 cells were plated on 100-mm dishes with 10 ml of culture media. The generation of the stable HCN4-expressing HEK-293 cell line was described previously (24Ye B. Balijepalli R.C. Foell J.D. Kroboth S. Ye Q. Luo Y.H. Shi N.Q.

Approximately 0.7 Œºg (for electrophysiology experiments) or 4 Œºg (for biochemical experiments) of total DNA was transiently transfected to wild-type HEK-293 cells or into HEK-293 cells stably expressing HCN4 (24Ye B.

Polyclonal anti-peptide antibodies, generated against N-terminal residues in human HCN2 (residues 147‚Äì161) and HCN4 (residues 119‚Äì155) were obtained from Alomone Labs, Ltd. (Jerusalem). These antibodies are referred to here as anti-N2-HCN2 and anti-N-HCN4, respectively. A monoclonal antibody against a C-terminal peptide (residues 761‚Äì883) in rat HCN2 (referred to here as anti-C2-HCN2) was developed by and obtained from the UC Davis/NIH Neuromab Facility, supported by National Institutes of Health Grant U24NS050606 and maintained by the University of California at Davis. The polyclonal anti-Nav1.5 antibody was purchased from Upstate, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). In addition, rabbit polyclonal anti-peptide antibodies were generated against residues 43‚Äì59 and 847‚Äì863 in the N and C termini, respectively, of HCN2 (Zymed Laboratories Inc. Antibodies, Inc., Burlingame, CA). These antibodies, referred to here as anti-N1-HCN2 and anti-C1-HCN2, were affinity-purified and screened for specificity and cross-reactivity against HCN2 and HCN4. Similarly, a rabbit polyclonal antibody (anti-C-HCN4) was generated against C-terminal residues 758‚Äì779 in HCN4 (Zymed Laboratories Inc. Antibodies, Inc., Burlingame, CA), purified and characterized. For Western blots, cell lysates were prepared as described previously (25Ye B. Valdivia C.R. Ackerman M.J. Makielski J.C. Physiol.

Protein concentrations in all lysates were measured using a DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) and a ELx808 microplate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT) at a wavelength of 750 nm. As also described previously (23Nagatomo T. Fan Z. Ye B. Tonkovich G.S. January C.T. Kyle J.W. Makielski J.C. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ.

A full-range Rainbow molecular weight marker was applied to assess the molecular weight of protein samples (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). Following washing, membranes were incubated with the SuperSignal West Dura Extended duration substrate (Pierce) and exposed to a Bio-imaging system (UVP, Upland, CA) for visualization. Whole cell HCN-encoded inward currents were recorded from wild type and HCN4-expressing HEK-293 cells 24 h after transient transfections with the HCN2 or HCN2ŒîC cDNA constructs; all recordings were obtained at room temperature. The extracellular recording solution contained (in mm): NaCl 110, MgCl2 0.5, KCl 30, CaCl2 1.8, and HEPES 5. Recording pipettes contained (in mm): NaCl 10, MgCl2 0.5, KCl 130, HEPES 5, and EGTA 1. EGFP-expressing cells were identified under epifluorescence illumination prior to recordings. Electrophysiological experiments were controlled, and data were collected using an Axopatch 200B amplifier interfaced to a Digidata 1322A data acquisition system using the pCLAMP 9 software package (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Recording electrodes were fabricated from borosilicate glass (WP Instruments) on a two stage (P-87; Sutter Instrument) vertical puller. Whole cell HCN-encoded currents were evoked in response to hyperpolarizing voltage steps to potentials between ‚àí60 and ‚àí130 mV from a holding potential of ‚àí40 mV; voltage clamp protocol is illustrated below the experimental data in Fig. 5. A one-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction was performed to determine the statistical significance of differences among groups of cells (mean data); where appropriate, p values are presented in the text. Previous studies have shown that HCN2 and HCN4 can co-assemble in heterologous cells, raising the interesting possibility that functional myocardial HCN-encoded If channels are heteromeric. To test directly the hypothesis that HCN2 and HCN4 associate in the myocardium in situ, (mouse) heart proteins were isolated and immunoprecipitated with specific anti-HCN2 and anti-HCN4 antibodies. Parallel experiments using a rabbit IgG as a negative control were also performed. Proteins precipitated with the anti-N-HCN4 antibody (see ‚ÄúMaterials and Methods‚Äù) were fractionated on SDS-PAGE gels and immunoblotted with the anti-N2-HCN2 antibody. A parallel immunoblot of the heart protein lysate (without immunoprecipitation) was also probed with the anti-N2-HCN2 antibody. A single ‚àº60-kDa protein band was detected with the anti-N2-HCN2 antibody in the Western blot of the fractionated total heart protein lysate (Fig. 1A, lane 4). The same band was identified in the sample immunoprecipitated with the anti-N-HCN4 antibody (Fig. 1A, lane 2), but this band was not present in the sample immunoprecipitated with the rabbit IgG (Fig. 1A, lane 1) or in the wash following the immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1A, lane 3). Co-immunoprecipitation of HCN2 and HCN4 was also observed in a ‚Äúreverse‚Äù (immunoprecipitation) experiment in which the heart protein lysates were precipitated with the anti-N2-HCN2 antibody and were then immunoblotted with the anti-N-HCN4 antibody. A single ‚àº160-kDa band was detected in the heart protein lysate prior to immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1B, lane 4). A protein band at the same molecular mass was identified in the blot of fractionated proteins following immunoprecipitation with the anti-N2-HCN2 antibody (Fig. 1B, lane 2). In contrast, the 160-kDa band was not evident in the blots of fractionated mouse heart proteins following immunoprecipitations with rabbit IgG (Fig. 1B, lane 1) or in the wash (Fig. 1B, lane 3). The results were confirmed by three independent experiments using different heart samples. Although the results described above clearly suggest association of HCN2 and HCN4 in (adult mouse) heart, the Western blots probed with the anti-N2-HCN2 antibody (Fig. 1A) revealed a single protein band at a much lower molecular mass (‚àº60 kDa) than was expected (‚àº 105 kDa) based on the predicted amino acid sequence of the full-length HCN2 protein. Interestingly, examination of Western blots probed with anti-HCN2 antibodies that have appeared in several published reports also revealed the presence of a low molecular mass (‚àº60 kDa) HCN2 protein in canine and rat heart lysates (27Zicha S. Fern√°ndez-Velasco M. Lonardo G. L'Heureux N. Nattel S. Cardiovasc. Res. 2005; 66: 472-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 28Han W. Bao W. Wang Z. Nattel S. Circ.

Circulation. 2004; 109: 1783-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To explore further the hypothesis that this 60-kDa protein reflects HCN2 expression in adult mouse heart, we generated two additional polyclonal anti-peptide antibodies targeting the N and C termini of HCN2 and used these, together with the Neuromab monoclonal anti-C2-HCN2 antibody (see ‚ÄúMaterials and Methods‚Äù), to further examine HCN2 expression. One antibody, referred to as anti-N1-HCN2, was generated against amino acids (43‚Äì59) in the N terminus of HCN2 and the other, referred to as anti-C1-HCN2, was targeted against amino acids (847‚Äì863) in the C terminus of HCN2. Western blots of heart and brain proteins with these antibodies (and with the anti-N2-HCN2 used in Fig. 1) were completed on isolated mouse brain and heart proteins, as well as on protein lysates from HEK-293 cells transiently transfected with HCN2 cDNA. As illustrated in Fig. 2, these experiments revealed that both the anti-N1-HCN2 and anti-N2-HCN2 antibodies detected the expected full-length (‚àº105 kDa) HCN2 protein in total brain lysates and in lysates from HEK-293 cells transfected with the full-length HCN2 construct (Fig. 2, A and B). In the heart lysates, however, both the anti-N1-HCN2 and the anti-N2-HCN2 antibodies detected only a ‚àº60-kDa band (Fig. 2, A and B). On the other hand, nothing was detected in the heart lysates using either the anti-C1-HCN2 antibody or the monoclonal anti-C2-HCN2 antibody (Fig. 2, C and D). Importantly, the full-length ‚àº105-kDa HCN2 protein was detected with both the anti-C1-HCN2 and the anti-C2-HCN2 antibodies in the Western blots of the protein lysates prepared from mouse brain and from HEK-293 cells transiently transfected with the HCN2 cDNA (Fig. 2, C and D). Similar results were obtained in six (6Ludwig A. Zong X. Stieber J. Hullin R. Hofmann F. Biel M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2323-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) independent experiments using different heart (brain) samples; the unique presence of the 60-kDa (HCN2) protein band in heart is highly reproducible. In addition, only the 60-kDa protein is identified in the heart samples; there is no evidence for the expression of a high molecular mass (‚àº105 kDa) HCN2 protein in the heart (as is identified in brain). Although all protein isolation steps were handled on ice and in the presence of protease inhibitors to reduce protease-dependent effects and to minimize protein degradation, it is certainly possible that the presence of the 60-kDa HCN2 protein in the heart samples does, in fact, reflect protein degradation. To explore this hypothesis directly, the same heart protein samples were used to examine HCN4 and Nav1.5 protein expression. Western blots probed with the anti-N-HCN4 or anti-C-HCN4 antibody revealed the presence of a single protein band at 160 kDa corresponding to full-length HCN4 (Fig. 3, A and B). Similarly, a single protein band at ‚àº250 kDa was observed with the anti-Nav1.5 antibody (Fig. 3C). Although these observations clearly suggest that protein degradation is not a general problem, it remains possible that the HCN2 protein is specifically degraded during one or more steps in the procedures used. To explore the possible role of HCN2 protein degradation during sample handling, an HA-tagged HCN2 construct was generated and expressed in HEK-293 cells. Lysates from the HA-tagged HCN2-expressing HEK-293 cells were prepared and mixed with heart lysates at a (mass) ratio of 1:10 for 1 h in ice. Western blots were then run and probed with the anti-HA or the anti-N2-HCN2 antibody. As illustrated in Fig. 4A (lane 2), full-length HA-tagged HCN2 (‚àº105 kDa) was detected with the anti-HA antibody in samples prepared by mixing lysates from the HA-tagged HCN2-expressing cells with the heart lysates, as well as from the HEK-293 cells transiently transfected with the HA-tagged HCN2 cDNA (Fig. 4A, lane 3). Control (antibody) experiments revealed that nothing was detected with the anti-HA antibody in Western blots of fractionated proteins from heart (Fig. 4A, lane 1) or from HEK-293 cells transfected with untagged HCN2 (Fig. 4A, lane 4). The membranes were then stripped and immunoblotted with the anti-N2-HCN2 antibody. With this antibody, the full-length HCN2 (‚àº105 kDa) protein was again detected in samples prepared by mixing lysates of HEK-293 cells expressing the HA-tagged HCN2 (Fig. 4B, lane 3) or the untagged HCN2 (Fig. 4B, lane 4) and the heart lysates (Fig. 4B, lane 2). In contrast, as observed in previous experiments (Fig. 1), only the ‚àº60-kDa band was detected in the heart lysates (Fig. 4B, lane 1). In addition, the ‚àº60-kDa HCN2 protein was detected in the samples prepared by mixing lysates of HEK-293 cells expressing HA-tagged HCN2 with the heart lysates (Fig. 4B, lane 2). The full-length (‚àº105 kDa) HCN2 protein is also detected with the anti-N2-HCN2 antibody in the mixed (heart and HEK-293 cell) lysates. These observations, together with the results presented in Fig. 3, clearly suggest that the finding of the ‚àº60-kDa HCN2 protein in heart lysates (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2) is not an artifact of protein degradation that occurs during the protein isolation and/or handling stages. Rather, these results indicate that the mature myocardial HCN2 p"

Interaction of the propeptide and the mature part of VWF is moreover required for the formation of WPB in endothelial cells (16.Haberichter S.L. Merricks E.P. Fahs S.A. Christopherson P.A. Nichols T.C. Montgomery R.R. Blood. 2005; 105: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Multimerization and organization of VWF and its propeptide into tubules takes place in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and is followed by the formation of an extensive coat of AP-1/clathrin around the emerging organelles (17.Lui-Roberts W.W. Collinson L.M. Hewlett L.J. Michaux G. Cutler D.F. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 627-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it appears that other molecules can be targeted to WPB by interaction with VWF. For osteoprotegerin (18.Shahbazi S. Lenting P.J. Fribourg C. Terraube V. Denis C.V. Christophe O.D. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2007; 5: 1956-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and P-selectin (5.Harrison-Lavoie K.J. Michaux G. Hewlett L. Kaur J. Hannah M.J. Lui-Roberts W.W. Norman K.E.

Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1129-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), this probably happens at the TGN level. IL-8 also binds to VWF under conditions mimicking those of the TGN, and subcellular fractionation analysis revealed that IL-8 is stored in a stoichiometric ratio to VWF, suggesting a direct molecular interaction (20.Bierings R. van den Biggelaar M. Kragt A. Mertens K. Voorberg J. van Mourik J.A. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2007; 5: 2512-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Mechanisms of chemokine sorting to the regulated secretory pathway are currently not well understood, but recent data from blood platelets point to a role for an exposed loop between the second and third Œ≤-strands of the molecule, referred to as loop 2 or the 40s loop, in the sorting of PF4/CXCL4, RANTES/CCL5, and NAP-2/CXCL7 to platelet Œ±-granules (21.El Golli N. Issertial O. Rosa J.P. Briquet-Laugier V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30329-30335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Specifically, the sorting of PF4 appears to depend on loop 2, featuring the residues 45Leu-Lys-Asn-Gly48 (21.El Golli N. Issertial O. Rosa J.P. Briquet-Laugier V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30329-30335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and loops with similar three-dimensional structures are also found in RANTES and NAP-2, suggesting that this motif may be of general significance for chemokine sorting in platelets (21.El Golli N. Issertial O. Rosa J.P. Briquet-Laugier V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30329-30335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In this regard, it may be of relevance that GROŒ± (growth-related oncogene Œ±)/CXCL1 contains a loop 2 sequence identical to that of PF4 and is found together with MCP-1 (monocyte chemotactic protein-1)/CCL2 in a recently characterized endothelial compartment for regulated secretion that we have designated type II granules of regulated secretion (11.√òynebr√•ten I. Bakke O. Brandtzaeg P. Johansen F.E. Haraldsen G. Blood. 2004; 104: 314-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 22.√òynebr√•ten I. Barois N. Hagelsteen K. Johansen F.E. Bakke O. Haraldsen G. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 5358-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to elucidate the molecular properties of IL-8 that enable its targeting to endothelial WPB. Chemokines have a highly similar tertiary structure, consisting of a typical Greek key structural motif with three consecutive Œ≤-strands forming a Œ≤-sheet stabilized by one or two disulfide bridges and a C-terminal Œ±-helix inclined at a 45¬∞ angle to the Œ≤-sheet (Fig. 2, A and B) (23.Allen S.J. Crown S.E. Handel T.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 25: 787-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). This similarity in protein fold and the existence of endothelial cell-derived chemokines that are not sorted to WPB (11.√òynebr√•ten I. Bakke O. Brandtzaeg P. Johansen F.E. Haraldsen G. Blood. 2004; 104: 314-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) make them ideal candidates for domain swap studies. By means of alanine mutations or chimerization with IP-10 (interferon-Œ≥-induced protein-10), a chemokine not targeted to WPB (11.√òynebr√•ten I. Bakke O. Brandtzaeg P. Johansen F.E. Haraldsen G. Blood. 2004; 104: 314-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that loop 2 of IL-8, consisting of the residues Ser44-Asp45-Gly46, is essential for sorting of the chemokine to WPB. Moreover, a chimera containing loop 2 and the Œ±-helix from IL-8 on an IP-10 backbone sorted to WPB with the same efficiency as IL-8. The loop 2 area of IL-8 maintains a neutral net charge, and we propose that WPB targeting of IL-8 can occur when the overall charge is neutral or negative, whereas a positive charge is not tolerated. The fingerprint of the loop 2 region differs among chemokines and may confer specificity for sorting. Recombinant human epidermal growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor were obtained from R&D Systems (Abingdon, UK). MCDB 131 and Opti-MEM I medium, fetal calf serum, gentamicin, fungizone, and l-glutamine were purchased from Invitrogen, and trypsin-EDTA was from Bio-Whittaker (Walkersville, MD). Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs (Hitchin, UK). Unless otherwise noted, all other reagents were from Sigma. Umbilical cords were obtained with the mothers' permission from the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Rikshospitalet, according to a protocol approved by the Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics (Health Region South, Norway, Approval S-05152). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were isolated as described by Jaffe et al. (24.Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. Becker C.G. Minick C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (6008) Google Scholar) and cultured in MCDB 131 containing 7.5% fetal calf serum, 10 ng/ml EGF, 1 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 Œºg/ml hydrocortisone, 50 Œºg/ml gentamicin, and 250 ng/ml fungizone (complete HUVEC medium). The cells were maintained at 37 ¬∞C in a humid 95% air, 5% CO2 atmosphere and split at a ratio of 1:3. Cultures were used at passage levels between 1 and 6. Full-length human IL-8 and IP-10 were amplified by PCR from plasmids kindly provided by J. Oppenheim (NCI-Fredrick) and A. D. Luster (Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA), respectively. The restriction sites NheI and KpnI were added before subcloning into the expression vector pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen). Next, the 3‚Ä≤ fusion with the HA tag was made by insertion of HA tag-encoding DNA oligomers containing KpnI and XhoI sites. Mutagenesis was performed by QuikChange PCR (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) or by splice overlap extension and subcloning into an NheI- and XbaI-digested pcDNA3.1(+). Details of all plasmids will be provided upon request. Plasmid DNA was isolated using the Plus SV Minipreps kit from Promega (Madison, WI) or the QIAfilter Plasmid Maxi Kit from Qiagen (Madison, WI). The entire open reading frame of all plasmids was verified by DNA sequencing (Seqlab, G√∂ttingen, Germany). Note that IL-8 exists in at least two forms, with the 72-amino acid form representing N-terminally truncated IL-8 (25.H√©bert C.A. Luscinskas F.W. Kiely J.M. Luis E.A. Darbonne W.C. Bennett G.L. Liu C.C. Obin M.S. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Baker J.B. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 3033-3040PubMed Google Scholar). To avoid deviation from the generally accepted nomenclature, the numbering of residues in this paper (Fig. 1) is based on the 72-residue variant. HUVECs, grown to 70‚Äì80% confluence, were trypsinized by 0.05% trypsin-EDTA and washed once in complete HUVEC medium before resuspension at 2 √ó 106 cells/ml in Opti-MEM I containing 2.5% fetal calf serum. The cell suspension (400 Œºl) was mixed with 25 Œºg of DNA, transferred to a 4-mm disposable cuvette (model 640, Bridge Bioscience Inc., Portsmouth, NH), and electroporated with a BTX ECM830 ElectroSquarePorator (BTX Instrument Division, Harvard Apparatus Inc., Holiston, MA) in LV mode (single pulse of 160 V, 70 ms). The cells were seeded in gelatin-coated 8-well LabTekTM chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY) at a density of 3 √ó 104 cells/well and cultured for 24‚Äì27 h before fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. One well with cells transfected with HA-tagged wild type (WT) IL-8 was included on every chamber slide to provide an internal control for normalization of the results. To evaluate sorting, the fixed HUVECs were incubated with mouse monoclonal primary antibody against HA or IP-10 for 20 h at 4 ¬∞C, washed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% saponin, incubated with biotinylated horse anti-mouse IgG (H + L) and rabbit-anti-human VWF for 90 min at room temperature, washed, incubated with streptavidin-Cy2 and pig anti-rabbit Ig-TRITC for 60 min, washed, dipped in distilled H2O, dried, and mounted in polyvinyl alcohol. All antibodies were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1.25% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% saponin. Details of antibodies, manufacturers, and concentrations used are given in Table 2. Images were obtained using a Leica TSC XP confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany) equipped with an argon (488 nm) and two helium/neon (543 and 633 nm) lasers. PL Apo √ó40/1.25‚Äì0.75 and N Plan apochromat √ó100/1.4 oil objectives were used. Sorting of chimeras and mutants to WPB is indicated by a sorting index (SI), defined as the ratio between the number of double positive HA/VWF granules and the total number of either HA-containing or VWF-containing granules. Control experiments showed that mean SI calculated from the two reference points (total number of HA- or VWF-containing granules) were similar but that the range of results obtained by the former method varied more (data not shown). 10 cells were counted manually for each construct per experiment, and the counts from individual cells were normalized by division by the mean of WT IL-8 counts on the same chamber slide. All constructs were tested in at least three experiments with cells from different donors. Histograms of data indicated an approximately normal distribution. SPSS 16.0 was used to calculate mean and 95% confidence interval as well as to perform one-way variance analysis (analysis of variance) with post hoc Bonferroni testing (Œ±-value of 0.05), providing two-tailed p values for differences in SI between each construct and WT IL-8 (values shown in Table 1).TABLE 1Sorting indices and statistics of chimeras and mutantsConstruct (figures providing details of chimeric structure)MeanaAfter normalization to internal control (WT IL-8).95% CIp valuebDifference from WT IL-8, adjusted by post hoc Bonferroni test; one-way analysis of variance between groups gave a significance level of <0.001.Cells countedcTotal of HUVECs counted divided between at least three different donors.%%WT IL-810098‚Äì102NAdNot applicable.362Ch1 (Fig. 3)8173‚Äì890.00340Ch2 (Fig. 3)7866‚Äì89<0.00140Ch3 (Fig. 3)2416‚Äì32<0.00140Ch4 (Fig. 3)7666‚Äì86<0.0014229AAAAA3310090‚Äì109NSeNS, not significant.3036AA379486‚Äì103NS3043AAAA464132‚Äì51<0.0015352AAAA557864‚Äì910.00130K42A10292‚Äì112NS30L43A9687‚Äì105NS33S44A107100‚Äì114NS33D45A2619‚Äì33<0.00151G46A9889‚Äì107NS30D45K2317‚Äì28<0.00140IL-844KKKG4686‚Äì10<0.00160IP-1043SD-G462117‚Äì26<0.00138Ch5 (Fig. 5)3022‚Äì38<0.00141Ch6 (Fig. 5)2015‚Äì25<0.00130Ch7 (Fig. 5)7063‚Äì77<0.001; <0.001fDifference from IP-1044SD-G46, Student's t test.72Ch8 (Fig. 5)6152‚Äì70<0.00142Ch9 (Fig. 5)10094‚Äì107NS42R20A/R60A/K65A /K67A/R68A10092‚Äì109NS30C7S/C9S/C34S/C50S10091‚Äì110NS29F17A9788‚Äì106NS3318AAAA219379‚Äì107NS3117AAAAAA225039‚Äì62<0.00130a After normalization to internal control (WT IL-8).b Difference from WT IL-8, adjusted by post hoc Bonferroni test; one-way analysis of variance between groups gave a significance level of <0.001.c Total of HUVECs counted divided between at least three different donors.d Not applicable.e NS, not significant.f Difference from IP-1044SD-G46, Student's t test. Open table in a new tab To identify motifs of IL-8 important for targeting of the protein to WPB, we designed mutants of IL-8 as well as chimeras of IL-8 and IP-10. In HUVECs, IP-10 is released via constitutive secretion (11.√òynebr√•ten I. Bakke O. Brandtzaeg P. Johansen F.E. Haraldsen G. Blood. 2004; 104: 314-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), apparently lacking the properties required to direct it to compartments of regulated secretion (26.Kelly R.B. Science. 1985; 230: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar, 27.Tartakoff A. Vassalli P. D√©traz M. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 79: 694-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Moreover, the activity of such IL-8/IP-10 hybrids has been examined with regard to neutrophil activation and compared with that of WT IL-8, demonstrating that several of them retain a structure sufficient for receptor activation (28.Clark-Lewis I. Schumacher C. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23128-23134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On these grounds, IP-10 was considered a good candidate for chimera formation. An alignment of the two chemokines is shown in Fig. 1. Sorting to WPB of the chimeras and mutants was examined in transiently transfected HUVECs incubated for 24‚Äì27 h before fixation and immunostaining. Subsequently, the ratio of double-positive HA/VWF granules was enumerated by fluorescent confocal microscopy. The ability of a given construct to sort to WPB is presented by an SI, defined as the percentage of colocalization relative to that of the WT control (see ‚ÄúExperimental Procedures‚Äù). Representative images of wild type IL-8, IP-10, mutants, and chimeras are shown in Fig. 2C. A summary of the results for all constructs examined is presented in Table 1. In the first series of experiments (Fig. 3), we examined a chimera (Ch1) in which the N-terminal part of IL-8, including the first amino acid of Œ≤-strand 1 was substituted with that of IP-10 (IP-10-(1‚Äì21)-IL-8-(23‚Äì72)), and observed an SI of 81% (Fig. 3 and Table 1). Likewise, a chimera (Ch2) in which loop 3 and the C-terminal Œ±-helix of IL-8 were substituted with that of IP-10 (IL-8-(1‚Äì51)-IP-10-(52‚Äì74)) showed an SI of 78% (Fig. 3 and Table 1). On the other hand, the complementary chimera (Ch3) (IP-10-(1‚Äì51)-IL-8-(52‚Äì72)) demonstrated an SI of only 29% (Fig. 3 and Table 1). Based on these results, we wanted to examine the importance of residues 23‚Äì51 of IL-8, which constitute most of Œ≤-strand 1 as well as loop 1, Œ≤-strand 2, loop 2, and Œ≤-strand 3, and designed chimera 4 (IP-10-(1‚Äì21)-IL-8-(23‚Äì51)-IP-10-(52‚Äì74)) that showed an SI of 76% (Figs. 2C and 3). These data (Fig. 3 and Table 1) indicate that amino acids within the sequence 23‚Äì51 of IL-8 comprise the most important residues for sorting to WPB. Furthermore, the C-terminal Œ±-helix together with the preceding loop 3 of IL-8 (Ch3) was not enough to induce sorting. The three loops of IL-8 consist mainly of non-hydrophobic amino acids and are exposed on the surface of the globular structure (Fig. 2, A and B). Since protein-interacting sites typically are found in such exposed loops, we wanted to investigate their involvement in sorting by exchanging loop residues with alanine (Fig. 4). To test a potential role of residues in loop 1 (29ESGPHCANT37) in sorting, the two constructs 29AAAAA33 and 36AA37 were designed (Fig. 4). The disulfide bridge-forming Cys34 was not altered due to its role in maintenance of the IL-8 structure, nor was Ala35. None of the constructs showed any significant reduction in SI (Fig. 4 and Table 1), suggesting that the charged or polar amino acids of loop 1 are not important for WPB localization. Alanine mutations of the residues in loop 3 (52Asp-Pro-Lys-Glu55) resulted in a weak but significant reduction in sorting (Fig. 4 and Table 1). In contrast, replacement of loop 2 (43Leu-Ser-Asp-Gly46) with alanines (43AAAA46) led to a significant reduction in sorting efficiency (Fig. 4 and Table 1). On these grounds, loop 2 was dissected further by performing individual alanine mutations of the loop residues as well as the preceding lysine and leucine (Fig. 4; K42A, L43A, S44A, D45A, and G46A). K42A, L43A, S44A, and G46A sorted efficiently to WPB, whereas mutation of Asp45 induced a strong reduction in SI to 26% (Fig. 4 and Table 1). The D45A mutant appears to be correctly folded, because it was secreted from our cultures at levels similar to those of WT (supplemental Fig. S1). To examine if hydrophilicity of the residue was sufficient for sorting or whether a negative charge was required, the residue was exchanged for the positive amino acid lysine. This mutation similarly resulted in an SI of 23% (Figs. 2C and 4 and Table 1). In this context, it is interesting to note that replacement of Asp45 with the positively charged arginine (D45R) retained binding to both IL-8 receptors with an affinity similar to that of WT IL-8 (29.Hammond M.E. Shyamala V. Siani M.A. Gallegos C.A. Feucht P.H. Abbott J. Lapointe G.R. Moghadam M. Khoja H. Zakel J. Tekamp-Olson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8228-8235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Taken together, it would appear that D45A and D45K are correctly folded and functionally intact, and our data therefore indicate that the negative charge of Asp45 is of importance. Replacement of loop 2 of IL-8 with the corresponding region of IP-10 (Fig. 4, IL-8 44KKKG46) abrogated sorting to WPB (Fig. 4 and Table 2). However, the grafting of loop 2 of IL-8 into IP-10 (Fig. 4, IP-1043SD-G46) did not induce sorting of IP-10 (Fig. 4 and Table 1). Moreover, loop 2 fused to the signal peptide of IL-8 did not colocalize with VWF (data not shown). The Ser44-Asp45-Gly46 motif of IL-8 is hence necessary for sorting to endothelial WPB, whereas the linear sequence on its own appears not to be sufficient.TABLE 2Antibodies and conjugates used for immunostainingEpitopeSpecification (clone)Source (product number)Working concentrationHAMouse IgG1 (HA-7)Sigma (H9658)0.3 Œºg ml‚àí1HAMouse IgG1 (HA.11)Bio Site, T√§by, Sweden (MMS-101P)1 Œºg ml‚àí1IP-10Mouse IgG1 (33036.211)R&D Systems Europe Ltd., Abingdon, UK (MAB266)1 Œºg ml‚àí1VWFRabbit polyclonalDAKO Denmark (A0082)1:1400 (v/v)Mouse IgG (H + L)Horse polyclonal, biotin-conjugatedVector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA (BA-2000)7.5 Œºg ml‚àí1Rabbit IgPig polyclonal, TRITC-conjugatedDAKO Denmark (R0156)18 Œºg ml‚àí1BiotinStreptavidin, Cy2-conjugatedAmersham Biosciences UK Ltd., Buckinghamshire, UK (PA42001)1 Œºg ml‚àí1 Open table in a new tab To shed further light on the criteria for sorting to WPB, chimeras containing loop 2 and varying regions of IL-8 were designed. First, we examined a chimera containing loop 2 and the flanking Œ≤-strands 2 and 3 of IL-8 (Fig. 5, Ch5), and observed a SI of only 30% (Fig. 5 and Table 1). Similarly, chimera 6, containing loop 2 and the N-terminal amino acids 1‚Äì28 of IL-8, showed an SI of 20% (Fig. 5 and Table 1). Hence, neither the adjacent Œ≤-strands of loop 2 nor the N-terminal part of IL-8 appeared to assist in sorting of the molecule to WPB. On the other hand, chimera 7, incorporating loop 3 and the C-terminal Œ±-helix in addition to loop 2 of IL-8, efficiently increased the SI to 70% (Fig. 5 and Table 1), indicating that the C terminus of the protein is of importance. Finally, chimera 8, featuring loop 2 together with loop 3, demonstrated a sorting efficiency of 61%, whereas chimera 9, including loop 2 and the C-terminal Œ±-helix of IL-8, completely restored sorting to the level of WT IL-8 (Figs. 2C and 5 and Table 1). Given that the positively charged, glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-binding amino acids of IL-8 are mostly situated in the C-terminal Œ±-helix (30.Krieger E. Geretti E. Brandner B. Goger B. Wells T.N. Kungl A.J. Proteins. 2004; 54: 768-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 31.Kuschert G.S. Hoogewerf A.J. Proudfoot A.E. Chung C.W. Cooke R.M. Hubbard R.E. Wells T.N. Sanderson P.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11193-11201Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), we additionally substituted amino acids Lys20, Arg60, Lys64, Lys67, and Arg68 with alanine (Fig. 6); however, no change in WPB targeting (Fig. 6 and Table 1) was observed. The four cysteine residues of IL-8 are reported to be of importance for the maintenance of the tertiary structure of the chemokine, through the formation of stabilizing disulfide bridges (32.Rajagopalan L. Chin C.C. Rajarathnam K. Biophys. J. 2007; 93: 2129-2134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To prevent formation of disulfide bridges, which is reported to result in a molten globular tertiary structure of the molecule (32.Rajagopalan L. Chin C.C. Rajarathnam K. Biophys. J. 2007; 93: 2129-2134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), the cysteines were replaced by serine residues (Fig. 6). However, the mutations did not induce any reduction in targeting to WPB (Fig. 6 and Table 1). An N-terminal stretch of residues, 17FHPKFI22, forms a 310 Œ±-helix flanking a hydrophobic pocket adjacent to loop 2 of IL-8 (29.Hammond M.E. Shyamala V. Siani M.A. Gallegos C.A. Feucht P.H.

This pocket is important for IL-8-specific receptor binding (29.Hammond M.E. Shyamala V. Siani M.A. Gallegos C.A. Feucht P.H. Abbott J. Lapointe G.R. Moghadam M. Khoja H. Zakel J. Tekamp-Olson P. J.

Simultaneous replacement of the entire stretch of residues with alanines reduced the SI to 50%, whereas mutation of Phe17 alone or the residues 18‚Äì21 did not significantly alter sorting to WPB (Fig. 6 and Table 1). Hence, the reduced sorting appears to be caused by loss of Ile22, the side chain of which is deeply embedded in the hydrophobic core of IL-8 (Fig. 7A) and probably involved in stabilizing the structure of the chemokine. This study demonstrated that loop 2 of IL-8 is essential for localization of the protein"
https://openalex.org/W1987707286,"DNA helicase and primase are essential for DNA replication. The helicase unwinds the DNA to provide single-stranded templates for DNA polymerase. The primase catalyzes the synthesis of oligoribonucleotides for the initiation of lagging strand synthesis. The two activities reside in a single polypeptide encoded by gene 4 of bacteriophage T7. Their coexistence within the same polypeptide facilitates their coordination during DNA replication. One surface of helix E within the helicase domain is positioned to interact with the primase domain and the linker connecting the two domains within the functional hexamer. The interaction occurs in trans such that helix E interacts with the primase domain and the linker of the adjacent subunit. Most alterations of residues on the surface of helix E (Arg(404), Lys(408), Tyr(411), and Gly(415)) eliminate the ability of the altered proteins to complement growth of T7 phage lacking gene 4. Both Tyr(411) and Gly(415) are important in oligomerization of the protein. Alterations G415V and K408A simultaneously influence helicase and primase activities in opposite manners that mimic events observed during coordinated DNA synthesis. The results suggest that Asp(263) located in the linker of one subunit can interact with Tyr(411), Lys(408), or Arg(404) in helix E of the adjacent subunit depending on the oligomerization state. Thus the switch in contacts between Asp(263) and its three interacting residues in helix E of the adjacent subunit results in conformational changes that modulate helicase and primase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1969118578,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae can utilize high quality (e.g. glutamine and ammonia) as well as low quality (e.g. Œ≥-amino butyric acid and proline) nitrogen sources. The transcriptional activator Put3p allows yeast cells to utilize proline as a nitrogen source through expression of the PUT1 and PUT2 genes. Put3p activates high level transcription of these genes by binding proline directly. However, Put3p also responds to other lower quality nitrogen sources. As nitrogen quality decreases, Put3p exhibits an increase in phosphorylation concurrent with an increase in PUT gene expression. The proline-independent activation of the PUT genes requires both Put3p and the positively acting GATA factors, Gln3p and Gat1p. Conversely, the phosphorylation of Put3p is not dependent on GATA factor activity. Here, we find that the mutation of Put3p at amino acid Tyr-788 modulates the proline-independent activation of PUT1 through Gat1p. The phosphorylation of Put3p appears to influence the association of Gat1p, but not Gln3p, to the PUT1 promoter. Combined, our findings suggest that this may represent a mechanism through which yeast cells rapidly adapt to use proline as a nitrogen source under nitrogen limiting conditions.

Combined, our findings suggest that this may represent a mechanism through which yeast cells rapidly adapt to use proline as a nitrogen source under nitrogen limiting conditions. A key factor that permits Saccharomyces cerevisiae to adapt to suboptimal environmental conditions is its ability to utilize a wide range of nitrogen sources. Although S. cerevisiae can metabolize many nitrogen sources, not all are preferred. Good nitrogen sources, such as glutamine and ammonia, will be preferentially consumed, whereas poor sources, e.g. Œ≥-amino butyric acid and proline, are scavenged only when favored ones are no longer available. One of the least preferred nitrogen sources is proline, and the genes PUT1 and PUT2 encode proteins specifically for the conversion of proline to glutamate, a more metabolically useful form of nitrogen. The expression of these genes is regulated by the transcriptional activator, Put3p (1.Marczak J.E. Brandriss M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2609-2619Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Put3p is a member of the Zn(II)2Cys6 family of proteins, which includes Gal4p, Ppr1p, and Lys14p (2.Sellick C.A. Reece R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 405-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It is composed of 979 amino acids organized, as many members of this family are, into three distinct domains (see Fig. 1c); that is, an N-terminal Zn(II)2Cys6 DNA binding and dimerization domain, a region of unknown function loosely homologous to other family members, entitled the middle homology region (MHR), and a C-terminal activation domain (3.des Etages S.A. Falvey D.A. Reece R.J. Brandriss M.C. Genetics. 1996; 142: 1069-1082Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Swaminathan K. Flynn P. Reece R.J. Marmorstein R. Nat. Struct.

Put3p acts as both a ligand sensor and a transcriptional activator. When proline is present at high intracellular concentrations, it binds to Put3p, causing a conformational change and inducing expression of the PUT genes some 20-fold (6.Sellick C.A. Reece R.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5147-5153Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, DNA footprinting has demonstrated that Put3p is bound to its target DNA sites irrespective of proline concentration (7.Axelrod J.D. Majors J. Brandriss M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 564-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The constitutive DNA interaction of Put3p may allow the protein to affect the activity of the PUT genes in response to signals other than proline. For example, non-preferred nitrogen sources are capable of bringing about 2‚Äì4-fold increases in the activation of PUT1 and PUT2 from the repressed state imposed by more preferred nitrogen sources. This proline-independent activation is nitrogen source-dependent, and the level of activation increases as nitrogen quality decreases (8.Huang H.L. Brandriss M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 892-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 9.Saxena D. Kannan K.B. Brandriss M.C. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 552-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Put3p has also been observed to become increasingly phosphorylated as nitrogen quality decreases (8.Huang H.L. Brandriss M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 892-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Although these changes in phosphorylation state are concurrent with changes in transcriptional activation, they are not dependent upon it. This indicates that the phosphorylation state of Put3p might regulate its proline-independent activation (8.Huang H.L. Brandriss M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 892-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 9.Saxena D. Kannan K.B. Brandriss M.C. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 552-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thus, it would appear that Put3p responds to two separate cues to control its transcriptional activity; a proline signal, which leads to conformational changes and high level transcriptional activation, and a non-preferred nitrogen source signal, which results in the phosphorylation of Put3p and low level transcriptional activation. When preferred nitrogen sources are present in the growth medium, the expression of genes required for the metabolism of non-preferred nitrogen sources, such as the PUT genes, are repressed. This phenomenon is known as nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR). 2The abbreviations used are: NCRnitrogen catabolite repressionMIDASmultiple reaction monitoring (MRM)-initiated detection and sequencingIPimmunoprecipitationChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationTORtarget of rapamycinMORFmoveable open reading frame. 2The abbreviations used are: NCRnitrogen catabolite repressionMIDASmultiple reaction monitoring (MRM)-initiated detection and sequencingIPimmunoprecipitationChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationTORtarget of rapamycinMORFmoveable open reading frame. NCR is regulated by the TOR kinases, as part of the TORC1 complex (10.Wullschleger S. Loewith R. Hall M.N.

Cell. 2002; 10: 457-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1416) Google Scholar). TORC1 is the primary signal transducer for nitrogen quality in the yeast cell and has homologues in all eukaryotic genomes examined (10.Wullschleger S. Loewith R. Hall M.N. Cell. 2006; 124: 471-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4571) Google Scholar, 11.Crespo J.L. Hall M.N. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

Cell. 2002; 10: 457-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1416) Google Scholar). In high quality nitrogen environments, TORC1 is active and promotes NCR through the cytoplasmic sequestration of the positively acting GATA factors Gln3p and Gat1p. It has been shown that Gln3p is sequestered by direct physical association with Ure2p (13.Kulkarni A.A. Abul-Hamd A.T. Rai R. El Berry H. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32136-32144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, although Gln3p is fully sequestered in the cytoplasm, Gat1p remains localized to both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. It is not clear how Gat1p localization is regulated (14.Georis I. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. Dubois E. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 8919-8929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Upon the depletion of favored nitrogen sources, or after treatment with rapamycin, TORC1 is inactivated (12.Loewith R. Jacinto E. Wullschleger S. Lorberg A. Crespo J.L. Bonenfant D. Oppliger W. Jenoe P. Hall M.N. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 457-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1416) Google Scholar). This results in the complete nuclear localization of Gln3p and Gat1p, where they relieve NCR and activate gene expression (15.Cooper T.G. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 26: 223-238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16.De Virgilio C. Loewith R.

Moreover, when a good nitrogen source, such as glutamine, is available, Put3p is inactive, as proline transport is also inhibited by NCR. This occurs primarily through the repression of PUT4, which encodes a proline-specific transporter, and GAP1, encoding a general amino acid transporter (17.Courchesne W.E. Magasanik B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 672-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 18.ter Schure E.G. Sillj√© H.H. Vermeulen E.E. Kalhorn J.W. Verkleij A.J. Boonstra J. Verrips C.T. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 1451-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that there is a lag phase between the de-repression of proline transporters and its utilization as a nitrogen source. Proline-independent activation of PUT1 and PUT2, which are specific for proline metabolism, may represent a preparatory measure by the cell to ensure there is a sufficient level of the enzymes present for efficient utilization of proline, when proline transport does commence. Here we show that the phosphorylation of Put3p at residue Tyr-788 modulates proline-independent activation of the PUT genes through Gat1p, suggesting a mechanism by which PUT gene expression prepares the yeast cell for survival on proline as a nitrogen source. FY23 yeast cells (MATa, ura3‚Äì52, trp1Œî63, leu2Œî1) carrying a C-terminal-tagged PUT3 open reading frame on a MORF vector (Put3.MORF) was used for protein production and purification (19.Gelperin D.M. White M.A. Wilkinson M.L. Kon Y. Kung L.A. Wise K.J. Lopez-Hoyo N. Jiang L. Piccirillo S. Yu H. Gerstein M. Dumont M.E. Phizicky E.M. Snyder M. Grayhack E.J. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2816-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The C-terminal tag consisted of fused His6 and hemagglutinin tags, separated from the ZZ domain of protein A by a 3C protease cleavage site. FY23 cells were also used to assay phosphorylation site mutants. For chromatin immunoprecipitation, yeast strains expressing Gat1p-cAVI and Gln3p-cAVI were made by integrating a KanMX cassette bearing the cAVI tag (20.van Werven F.J. Timmers H.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: e33Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) sequence into the genomic loci of GAT1 and GLN3 in FY23 put3Œî cells. The Avitag sequence was amplified from plasmid pUG6-Myc-C-Avitag (20.van Werven F.J. Timmers H.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: e33Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The resulting strains were then transformed with the plasmid pRS316-BirA-NLS for the production of Escherichia coli biotin ligase BirA and either pMKL15 (wild-type PUT3) or pMKL23 (PUT3-Y788F). Put3p.MORF was purified from FY23 cells grown in SD media without amino acids or ammonium sulfate (Formedium) which was supplemented with 0.1% (v/v) proline, 2.0% (v/v) raffinose, and essential amino acids. Cells were grown to an A600 ‚àº 0.6, and protein production was induced for 6 h by the addition of 2% galactose. The induced cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 √ó g for 5 min. Cells were initially washed, then resuspended in buffer A (20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.8), 300 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol) with the addition of 50 mm NaF, 20 mm Œ≤-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and Roche-EDTA protease inhibitor tablets. The cells were frozen in liquid nitrogen and then mechanically lysed under liquid nitrogen in a Spex 6850 Freezer Mill for 5 cycles of 2 min each at maximum power. The lysate was thawed at room temperature, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 Œºm okadaic acid were added and incubated with rotation at 4 ¬∞C for 10 min. The lysate was then subjected to centrifugation at 5,000 √ó g for 10 min, and the supernatant was removed and centrifuged again at 20,000 √ó g for 20 min. Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (ProBond resin; Invitrogen) (1 ml) were pre-washed with buffer A including protease and phosphatase inhibitors, added to the cleared lysate, and incubated for 1 h with rotation at 4¬∞C. The bead/lysate mix was loaded onto a column then washed with buffer A including protease and phosphatase inhibitors, then buffer A, and finally buffer A containing 500 mm NaCl and 30 mm imidazole. Protein was eluted from the column with buffer A containing 250 mm imidazole. The resultant fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the peak fractions were pooled, then precipitated with 25% trichloroacetic acid (final concentration). The resulting pellet was washed once with ice-cold acetone and once with ice-cold acetone containing 0.5 n HCl, allowed to dry, then resuspended in lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer and run on a NuPAGE Tris-glycine gel (Invitrogen). Bands corresponding to Put3p.MORF (‚àº130 kDa) were excised from the gel and interrogated by MIDAS (21.Unwin R.D. Griffiths J.R. Leverentz M.K. Grallert A. Hagan I.M. Whetton A.D. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2005; 4: 1134-1144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) for phosphorylation site detection. The PUT3 gene was deleted from FY23 by the insertion of the TRP1 gene between the SnaBI restriction enzyme recognition sites of PUT3, resulting in an almost complete deletion of the open reading frame. GATA factor deletion strains were generated by disruption of the URE2, GLN3, or GAT1 open reading frames by the kanamycin resistance gene, as described (22.Wach A. Brachat A. P√∂hlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2215) Google Scholar). The PUT1-lacZ reporter was created by amplifying the PUT1 promoter from ‚àí1 kilobase to +25 bp into the open reading frame from genomic DNA and ligating it to the lacZ gene, amplified from pRJR179 (3.des Etages S.A. Falvey D.A. Reece R.J. Brandriss M.C. Genetics. 1996; 142: 1069-1082Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by PCR. The resulting construct was cloned into pRJR179 as an XbaI/KpnI fragment. The reporter-bearing plasmids ware then cut with ApaI and integrated into the URA3 locus of put3Œî, ure2Œî, gal3Œî, and gat1Œî cells, where it complemented the defective URA3 gene. Transformants were selected for by growth on plates lacking uracil. The put3Œî, PUT1-lacZ strains were complemented for put3Œî by transformation with a pRS415-borne copy of PUT3 or a mutant thereof. PUT3 was amplified from ‚àí639 bp to +98 bp of the open reading frame and cloned into pRS415 as a XhoI/XbaI fragment. The phosphorylation sites revealed by MIDAS analysis were mutated from serine to alanine or glutamic acid and from tyrosine to phenylalanine by use of the QuikChange methodology (23.Wang W. Malcolm B.A. Biotechniques. 1999; 26: 680-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Oligonucleotide sequences are available on request. Selected strains were grown in 3-ml cultures at 30 ¬∞C to mid-log phase in SD media without amino acids or ammonium sulfate (Formedium), which was supplemented with 0.1% v/v glutamine, 2% glucose, and essential amino acids. Where indicated, rapamycin (final concentration of 200 ng/ml) or the drug vehicle (90% ethanol, 10% Tween 20) was added for 60 min. Œ≤-Galactosidase levels in extracts were measured with the Galacto-Light Plus chemiluminescent reporter gene assay system (PE Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The activity was normalized to protein concentration, which itself was calculated using a Bradford assay (24.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211864) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown in minimal media containing yeast nitrogen base without ammonia and with histidine, methionine, 2% glucose, and 0.5% glutamine. Cultures (100 ml) were grown to an A600 nm of 0.4‚Äì0.6 and then treated with 200 ng/ml rapamycin for 30 min. Cells were treated with 1% formaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature on a tilting platform to cross-link proteins to DNA and then with 0.5 m glycine for 5 min to quench the cross-linking reaction. Chromatin was extracted as described (20.van Werven F.J. Timmers H.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: e33Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Reactions (50 Œºl) were set up using 1 Œºl of ChIP sample, 10 pmol of each primer, and 25 Œºl of SYBR green JumpStart mix (Sigma). All samples were set up in duplicate. Input DNA was used at a 1:100 dilution to calculate IP/Input ratios. For each primer set five 10-fold serial dilutions of Input DNA were used to prepare a standard curve in order to calculate DNA concentrations of the samples. Quantitative PCR was carried out using the Chromo4 real-time system (MJ Research) and the following program: 95 ¬∞C for 2 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 ¬∞C for 10 s, 56 ¬∞C for 15 s, and 72 ¬∞C for 15 s. ChIP data are expressed as a ratio of PUT1 IP:Input to HMR IP:Input. At least two ChIP experiments were carried out for each biological sample, and at least three separate yeast cultures were used to generate mean and S.D. data. Put3p is increasingly phosphorylated under conditions of decreasing nitrogen quality, in parallel with increasing activation (8.Huang H.L. Brandriss M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 892-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Our previous data demonstrated that the transcriptional properties of non-phosphorylated Put3p can be activated in vitro by proline (6.Sellick C.A. Reece R.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5147-5153Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In light of this, we wished to ask what the effects of these phosphorylation events were in vivo. This necessitated identifying the sites of phosphorylation present within Put3p. To this end, we ectopically expressed Put3p as a C-terminal-tagged fusion protein (Put3p.MORF) in S. cerevisiae, under the control of the GAL1 promoter (19.Gelperin D.M. White M.A. Wilkinson M.L. Kon Y. Kung L.A. Wise K.J. Lopez-Hoyo N. Jiang L. Piccirillo S. Yu H. Gerstein M. Dumont M.E. Phizicky E.M. Snyder M. Grayhack E.J. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2816-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). This was necessary as our previous studies relied on expression in insect cells, which did not result in post-translational modification of Put3p (Fig. 1a). Once purified, Put3p.MORF was subject to multiple rounds of protease digestion and MIDAS analysis (21.Unwin R.D. Griffiths J.R. Leverentz M.K. Grallert A. Hagan I.M. Whetton A.D. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2005; 4: 1134-1144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). It was necessary to use a combinatorial approach to protease digestion, as simply digesting Put3.MORF with trypsin resulted in many fragments too large for MIDAS analysis. Subsequent rounds of trypsin, trypsin/AspN, and trypsin/AspN/chymotrypsin digestion yielded fragments of suitable size for analysis. Successive rounds of protease digestion and MIDAS analysis revealed the presence of six previously unidentified phosphorylation sites. As can be seen in Fig. 1b, these sites cluster at the N terminus of the protein (Ser-103, Ser-129/130, and Ser-164), distal to the DNA binding domain, and at the C terminus (Tyr-788, Ser-882, and Ser-969), proximal to and within the activation domain. The peptide bearing Ser-129 and Ser-130 was shown to be phosphorylated only once. However, the juxtaposition of the two residues meant we were unable to resolve which was modified. To analyze the effect of each phosphorylation event on the activity of Put3p, we created a reporter system where the promoter of PUT1 (1 kilobase 5‚Ä≤ to the open reading frame) was fused to lacZ and integrated at the URA3 locus. PUT3 was then deleted by disruption of the open reading frame with the TRP1 gene. A low copy number plasmid producing wild Put3p maintained the same levels of activity of the integrated PUT1-lacZ reporter as Put3p produced from its native genomic locus (data not shown). The plasmid-borne PUT3 gene was mutated to change the phosphorylated serine residues to alanine and the phosphorylated tyrosine to phenylalanine by site-directed mutagenesis. The presence of poor nitrogen sources is signaled to Put3p though TORC1 via Gln3p and Gat1p (15.Cooper T.G. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 26: 223-238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16.De Virgilio C. Loewith R. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6392-6415Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Therefore, we were able to selectively activate this signal in cells growing in a rich nitrogen source by the addition of rapamycin, which inactivates TORC1, mimicking conditions of poor nitrogen quality (8.Huang H.L. Brandriss M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 892-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 9.Saxena D. Kannan K.B. Brandriss M.C. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 552-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Mutation of each of the phosphorylatable residues in the N-terminal cluster of Put3p to alanine, which renders them phosphorylation-incompetent, had no effect on the ability of Put3p to activate PUT1-lacZ in a proline-independent manner (Fig. 2). It is possible that no single phosphorylation site had an effect on the activation of PUT1-lacZ but instead acted collectively by increasing the electronegative charge of this region. We, therefore, sequentially combined the serine to alanine mutations to yield an N-terminal phosphorylation-incompetent mutant (S103A, S129A, S130A, S164A). This mutant had no effect on the activation of our reporter when compared with wild type (Fig. 2). For the C-terminal phosphorylation sites, the conversion of the Ser-882 to alanine had no effect on PUT1-lacZ expression, whereas the Y788F mutant exhibited an ‚àº50% reduction in activity, and S969A induced an ‚àº25% increase in activity. When Y788F was combined with S882A, the Y788F phenotype was dominant. However, when Y788F was combined with S969A, the S969A phenotype was dominant (Fig. 3). This suggests that the phosphorylation of Tyr-788 is an activating event, whereas phosphorylation of S969 is inhibitory. Although both the Y788F and S969A versions of Put3p were induced by rapamycin, both mutants exhibited their phenotype regardless of its presence (Fig. 3a). Given these findings, we generated mock-phosphorylated mutants to verify the phosphorylation-incompetent phenotypes. Substitution of serine for glutamic acid can in some instances mimic phosphorylation because of the presence of a bulky negatively charged functional group. However, as there are no naturally occurring aromatic amino acids with a carboxylic acid group in place of a hydroxyl group, it is not possible to create a mock-phosphorylated tyrosine residue. When we assayed the S969E strain, we discovered that it had a very similar phenotype to the phosphorylation-incompetent strain, S969A. This observation may occur through the perturbation of the activation domain, to which Put3p is known to be sensitive (3.des Etages S.A. Falvey D.A. Reece R.J. Brandriss M.C. Genetics. 1996; 142: 1069-1082Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that both the S969A and S969E phenotypes were dominant to Y788F supports the idea that this phenotype arises from perturbation of the activation domain (Fig. 3b). To dismiss the possibility that the Y788F phenotype resulted from nonspecific effects of the mutation, we challenged both glutamine- and proline-grown cells with rapamycin or the drug vehicle (Fig. 4). Neither the Y788F mutation nor treatment with rapamycin had any effect on the proline-dependent activation of Put3p, whereas the proline-independent activation again exhibited a ‚àº50% reduction. This suggests that the Y788F phenotype does not result from nonspecific effects of the mutation on Put3p function. Proline-independent activation of Put3p is mediated through the GATA factors Gln3p and Gat1p, which are in turn regulated wholly or in part by Ure2p (11.Crespo J.L. Hall M.N. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 579-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 14.Georis I. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. Dubois E. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 8919-8929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Given this, we wanted to determine whether phosphorylation of Tyr-788 had an effect on these factors. We disrupted the open reading frame encoding each GATA factor with the kanamycin resistance gene (22.Wach A. Brachat A. P√∂hlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2215) Google Scholar) in the put3Œî, PUT1-lacZ background. These strains were then assayed for the activity of Y788F relative to wild-type Put3p. Ure2p negatively regulates of Gln3p by direct physical association. Gat1p, however, does not associate with Ure2p and is only indirectly regulated by it (14.Georis I. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. Dubois E. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 8919-8929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 15.Cooper T.G. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 26: 223-238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of Ure2p results in constitutive nuclear localization of Gln3p and the constitutive dual nuclear-cytoplasmic localization of Gat1p (14.Georis I. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. Dubois E. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 8919-8929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It also has been shown to hyperactivate Put3p (25.Xu S. Falvey D.A. Brandriss M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2321-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). As this activation is most likely a result of constitutive Gln3p recruitment, we would, therefore, expect the Y788F phenotype to be preserved in this mutant if it operates through Gln3p. This, however, is not the case. In all the ure2Œî strains, regulation of proline-independent activation is lost, and cells show similar levels of activation whether or not rapamycin is present. In addition, under these conditions there is no discernible phenotype associated with the Y788F mutation in comparison to the wild-type protein (Fig. 5a). When the positive regulators Gln3p and Gat1p are deleted individually, a difference becomes apparent. Although gat1Œî cells remain responsive to rapamycin, Y788F and wild-type Put3p maintain similar levels of activity in each condition; the Y788F phenotype is again lost (Fig. 5b). However, the gln3Œî strains not only retain their responsiveness to rapamycin but also retain the Y788F phenotype (Fig. 5c). These data suggest that phosphorylation of Tyr-788 exerts its modulating effect through Gat1p. In addition, the dependence of the Y788F mutation on Gat1p provides evidence that the mutation does not simply cause an inhibitory effect on activation by Put3p by, for example, altering the activation domain of the protein. To determine the effect of both wild-type Put3p and the Y788F mutant on the ability to recruit Gat1p or Gln3p to the PUT1 promoter, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis was performed (Fig. 6). The protein being tested was tagged at its genomic locus using a biotin tag (20.van Werven F.J. Timmers H.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: e33Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The efficacy of this system was tested by initially tagging Rpb3p, the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II. In the presence of rapamycin, 2-fold more Rpb3p could be identified at the transcriptional start site of PUT1. In comparison, this rapamycin-dependent increase in RNA polymerase II association was not observed in a region of the PUT1 promoter that encompasses the Put3p binding site and the GATA binding sites (Fig. 6a). Increased binding of both Gat1p and Gln3p in response to rapamycin treatment could be observed at the DAL5 promoter (data not shown). In cells bearing wild-type Put3p, the presence of rapamycin induced a greater level of Gat1p binding at the PUT1 promoter (Fig. 6b). Conversely, the presence of rapamycin had little effect on the binding of Gln3p to the same promoter region (Fig. 6c). The Y788F version of Put3p elicited a higher level of association of Gat1p to the PUT1 promoter that was insensitive to the presence of rapamycin (Fig. 6b), and again, the binding of Gln3p to this promoter was unaffected by this mutation. The expression of PUT genes for proline utilization (PUT1 and PUT2) is regulated by two pathways; that is, direct sensing of proline by Put3p and general NCR. Although the interaction of Put3p with proline is well characterized (6.Sellick C.A. Reece R.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5147-5153Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the interaction with NCR regulators is not. It is, however, known that Put3p becomes increasingly phosphorylated as the nitrogen source quality decreases and that this coincides with increased PUT gene expression (8.Huang H.L. Brandriss M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 892-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 9.Saxena D. Kannan K.B. Brandriss M.C. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 552-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This suggests that this Put3p phosphorylation is linked with NCR regulation of PUT gene expression and prompted us to ask what role phosphorylation plays in the proline-independent regulation of the PUT genes. It is known that other members of the Zn(II)2Cys6 family are phosphorylated concurrently with activation, and it has been shown that a number of these events occur not as a cause of transcriptional activation but rather as a consequence of it (26.Leverentz M.K. Reece R.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 794-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). For instance, Gal4p is phosphorylated at four sites in a manner coincident with transcriptional activation. However, only one of these phosphorylation sites has an appreciable effect on the activation process itself (27.Hirst M. Kobor M.S. Kuriakose N. Greenblatt J. Sadowski I. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 673-678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 28.Sadowski I. Niedbala D. Wood K. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 10510-10514Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The kinase responsible for phosphorylating Gal4p is Srb10p, a component of the RNA PolII holoenzyme (27.Hirst M. Kobor M.S. Kuriakose N. Greenblatt J. Sadowski I. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 673-678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). It, therefore, appears that, whereas phosphorylation affects activation, it only occurs when Gal4p is activating transcription and is not part of a separate signaling pathway impinging on Gal4p function. Put3p becomes phosphorylated in a nitrogen source-dependent but activation-independent manner. This suggests that there are distinct mechanisms regulating these events. In this work, we identified several phosphorylation sites in Put3p. Mutational analysis suggests that the majority of these sites have no effect on modulating the activity of Put3p activity. Our data have, however, revealed that mutation of tyrosine 788 to phenylalanine (Y788F) effects the NCR-dependent activation of the PUT1 promoter. Previous studies involving promoter manipulation and deletion analysis have revealed that GATA factors are required for proline-independent activation of PUT1 (29.Rai R. Daugherty J.R. Cooper T.G. Yeast. 1995; 11: 247-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been proposed that Gat1p has a stronger influence on PUT1 gene expression than Gln3p (8.Huang H.L. Brandriss M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 892-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 9.Saxena D. Kannan K.B. Brandriss M.C. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 552-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These data coupled with the finding that Put3p phosphorylation is not dependent on GATA factors (9.Saxena D. Kannan K.B. Brandriss M.C. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 552-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) suggest that phosphorylation of Put3p might affect the ability of GATA factors to regulate proline-independent PUT1 expression. Our work confirms this, as a ‚àº50% reduction in PUT1 activity was observed in the Put3p (Y788F) background. Furthermore, this phenotype was preserved in gln3Œî, but not gat1Œî strains, suggesting that it is Gat1p that interacts with the Tyr-788 phosphorylation signal. The ChIP data (Fig. 6) suggest that the Y788F mutation results in constitutive binding of Gat1p to the PUT1 promoter. There is some evidence to suggest that not all Gat1p is excluded from the nucleus under NCR (unlike Gln3p) (14.Georis I. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. Dubois E. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 8919-8929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It is possible, therefore, that the Tyr-788 phosphorylation event serves a permissive function, allowing Gat1p to bind and activate PUT1 only when NCR is relieved and that the Y788F mutation causes aberrant binding of Gat1p, which consequently interferes with normal activation function. These results agree with our gene expression data, which show that PUT1 activation by rapamycin is indistinguishable from the wild-type when Gat1p is deleted in the Y788F background (Fig. 5). In the absence of Gat1p, another factor may be able to bind the PUT1 promoter, which is not influenced by Tyr-788 phosphorylation. It is possible that Gln3p may represent this factor, but results presented here and elsewhere (9.Saxena D. Kannan K.B. Brandriss M.C. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 552-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) would suggest that Gln3p has only a minor role in PUT gene activation and that the authentic factor is, as of yet, unidentified. In summary, we demonstrate that mutation of only one phosphorylatable residue within Put3p (Tyr-788) affects the magnitude of PUT1 activation in response to rapamycin in a manner that depends on Gat1p. We suggest that phosphorylation of this residue is an important determinant in this process. However, it is possible that this mutation may affect Put3p in a manner not dependent on phosphorylation. For example, the mutation may directly affect the interactions between Put3p and Gat1p or the way in which the complex interacts with other factors to modulate its ability to regulate transcriptional activation. Our current model of PUT gene activation is described as follows. In rich media, TORC1 mediates the inhibition of PUT1 by two pathways, first, by inhibition of proline transport (PUT4, GAP1) and, second, by inhibition of GATA factor activity (Gat1p, Gln3p, possibly other proteins). The lack of phosphorylation on Tyr-788 of Put3p inhibits low level PUT1 activation by any Gat1p in the nucleus. In poor nitrogen conditions, repression by TORC1 is relieved. GATA factors are able to enter the nucleus. Phosphorylation of Put3p by an unidentified kinase allows activation of PUT1 by Gat1p, concurrent with the movement of Gat1p localization from nuclear-cytoplasmic to strictly nuclear. This permits the expression of the PUT1, whereas proline transport is initiated. Once proline transport commences, the presence of excess proline in the cell then results in full Put3p activation and high level PUT1 expression. The events resulting from the switch from rich to poor nitrogen sources, thus, represents a ‚Äúpriming‚Äù event whereby the cell becomes prepared to utilize proline as a nitrogen source. The fact that Tyr-788 is the only phosphorylation site for which we were able to detect an effect by blocking phosphorylation narrows the possible factors regulating this event. In S. cerevisiae there are no true protein-tyrosine kinases, only dual specificity serine/threonine-tyrosine protein kinases. Moreover, there are only 11 proteins in the yeast kinome possessing this activity; four of these proteins are involved in mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades (Bck1p, Mkk1p, Mkk2p, Pbs2), six in cell cycle (Rad5 3, Swe1, Bud32, Mck1p, Mps1p, and Yak1p), and one of unknown function related to Cdc2p (Kns1p) (30.Zheng P.

Sci. 1997; 22: 18-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 32.Camon E. Magrane M. Barrell D. Binns D. Fleischmann W. Kersey P. Mulder N. Oinn T. Maslen J. Cox A. Apweiler R.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1655-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Of these kinases, Yak1p may be the most likely candidate to act on Put3p. Yak1p responds to nutrients, is nuclear, and is responsible for cell cycle arrest upon glucose limitation (35.Moriya H. Shimizu-Yoshida Y. Omori A. Iwashita S. Katoh M. Sakai A. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1217-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The response of Yak1p to glucose limitation does not render it incompatible with nitrogen-sensing pathways as it is well established that both carbon and nitrogen-sensing pathways converge on Gat1p and Gln3p. Not only is the expression of invertase, the product of the SUC2 gene, influenced by both Gat1p and Gln3p; it has also been shown that glucose as well as nitrogen limitation results in increased expression of GAP1, GDH1, and PUT1 (36.Oliveira E.M. Mansure J.J. Bon E.P. FEMS Yeast Res. 2005; 5: 605-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 37.Zaman S. Lippman S.I. Zhao X. Broach J.R. Annu. Rev.

Biol. 2002; 22: 1246-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Finally, it has been demonstrated that the cross-talk between GATA factors and glucose limitation is executed through the phosphorylation of Gln3p by Snf1p, the primary mediator of glucose repression in yeast. Given this, it is possible that Yak1p, a glucose-responsive kinase, may phosphorylate Put3p in response to the limitation of other nutrients. The positive identification of the kinase responsible for Tyr-788 phosphorylation and the further determination of its interactions with Gat1p will allow dissection of the mechanism by which the NCR pathway interacts with a metabolite-specific pathway to increase the adaptability of the cell.
