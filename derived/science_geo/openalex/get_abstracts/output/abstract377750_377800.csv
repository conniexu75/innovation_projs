Although it appears that the useful range of these cells may be extended slightly by working at liquid air and liquid hydrogen temperatures3, it seemed to us more profitable to explore further the possibilities of lead selenide cells as a means of extending the range of photoconductive methods in the infra-red. Reports of war-time work in Germany indicated that lead selenide had a peak sensitivity near 3·4 µ as compared with the lead sulphide peak near 2·6 µ; but no figures have been available on the actual performance of these German cells, relative to some standard such as a good vacuum thermocouple. The fact that lead selenide cells never got beyond the laboratory stage in Germany would seem to indicate that progress there had not reached the stage where the lead selenide cell was superior to the thermocouple or bolometer."

Now, at last, one definite function, and a very important one, has been ascribed to them, on impressive evidence. It appears that the lymphocytes synthesize and afterwards liberate into the blood the normal γ-globulin of the plasma and also the various antibodies which appear in the blood in immunity reactions. The antibodies are known to be simply specific modifications of γ-globulin. Furthermore, it has been shown that this liberation of γ-globulin by the lymphocytes, and in fact the whole activity of the lymphoid tissue, are controlled by one of the hormones of the adrenal cortex. At a conference on lymph held by the New York Academy of Sciences in April 1945, W. E. Ehrich (Ann. New York Acad. Sci., 46, 823; 1946) and A. White and T. F. Dougherty (ibid., p. 859) presented the important contributions which they have made to this new knowledge of the lymphocyte."

These skin samples were fixed either in formol saline or in Zenker and stained by a special combination of safranin, alumcarmine and picro-indigocarmine, details of which will be published elsewhere."
https://openalex.org/W2325579427,"There are four respiratory pigments which circulate in the blood or are found in the body cavity of animals. Two of these, the red haemoglobin and the dichroic red-green chlorocruorin, are close chemical relatives. Chlorocruorin is confined to certain marine polychaete worms and is characteristic of the group Serpulimorpha, comprising the families Serpulidae and Sabellidae. Hitherto it has been thought that all species in this group possess chlorocruorin in their blood. This, however, is not the case. I have found chlorocruorin in twenty-one species of the group, belonging to fifteen genera. One of the species with chlorocruorin is Spirorbis borealis Daudin, but another species of the same genus, namely, S. corrugatus (Montagu), has haemoglobin as its blood pigment. Yet another, species, S. militaris (Claparede), has neither pigment: its blood is colourless. That chlorocruorin and haemoglobin are really absent here, not just dilute, is proved by the fact discovered by my colleague, Miss Jean Hanson, that the benzidine reaction is negative in the blood vessels of S. militaris. These several species of Spirorbis live in similar situations, so that the possession of either or neither respiratory pigment appears to be functionally unimportant."

Lyotropic effects of anions4,5 and effects due to fixation of the anions by the protein6,7,8 can also be observed."

https://openalex.org/W1987663558,"It has long been the practice in carrying out phenol metabolism experiments in animals to measure the increase in ethereal sulphate excretion above the normal average to give an indication of the extent to which the phenol in question is being excreted by sulphate formation. Similarly, a rise in conjugated glucuronic acid excretion above the normal average is taken as proof that the material is being ‘detoxicated’ by glucuronide formation. In many cases it has been possible to obtain figures by this method upon which rough quantitative metabolic data could be based."

https://openalex.org/W2008716210,"Nitrous acid has been found to react readily with chlorophyll, giving four highly coloured crystalline compounds. The reaction was carried out as follows: 10 gm. of chlorophyll (commercial powder) was dissolved in 300 ml. of chloroform and 200 ml. of 3 per cent hydrochloric acid added; 12 gm. of sodium nitrite in 50 ml. of water was then added, with vigorous shaking, over a period of half a minute. The chloroform layer, which underwent a striking colour change from green to dark red, was separated immediately and washed with water. Evaporation of the solvent left a crystalline mass (10 gm.) from which the compounds A, B, C and D were obtained."

The school was attended largely by teachers and welfare-workers, most of whom came from Great Britain, although a few from other nations gave enhanced interest to the proceedings. It was planned to be a blend of work and pleasure, the first week being devoted to regular lecture-sessions, and the second to excursions and personal recreation. The members were housed in groups in various hotels in Berne, while all meetings were held in the University buildings, where lecture-room accommodation had been placed at the Council's disposal free of cost."
