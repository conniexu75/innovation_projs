This modification eliminated the chief sources of uncertainty which inhered in preceding determinations by similar methods such as those made by Sir Joseph Thomson [3], H.A. Wilson [4], Ehrenhaft [5] and Broglie [6], all of whom had deduced the elementary charge from the average behavior in electrical and gravitational fields of swarms of charged particles."

https://openalex.org/W1992762557,"THE honor conferred in the election to be president for the year of the Botanical Section of the British Association imposes the duty of preparing an address. I trust that my selection of a subject will not be attributed by any one to a want of appreciation of the worth and importance of certain sides of botanical research to which I shall have less occasion to refer. These have been eloquently supported by former presidents, and I take this opportunity to express the thanks I owe for the benefit received from their contributions to the advancement of the science of botany. They have told us of the advance in departments of which they could speak as leaders in research, and I do not venture to follow in their steps. My subject is from a field in which I have often experienced the hindrances of which I shall have to speak, both in personal work and still more as a teacher of students, familiar with the many difficulties that impede the path of those who would gladly give of their best, but find the difficulties for a time almost insurmountable, and who are too frequently unable to spare the time or labor to allow of their undertaking scientific investigations that they might well accomplish, and in which they would find keen pleasure under other conditions. Those whose tastes lie in the direction of studying plants in the field rather than in the laboratory are apt to find themselves hampered seriously if they seek to become acquainted with the plants of their own"
