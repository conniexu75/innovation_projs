https://openalex.org/W3092403777,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic presents an urgent health crisis. Human neutralizing antibodies that target the host ACE2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein1–5 show promise therapeutically and are being evaluated clinically6–8. Here, to identify the structural correlates of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, we solved eight new structures of distinct COVID-19 human neutralizing antibodies5 in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer or RBD. Structural comparisons allowed us to classify the antibodies into categories: (1) neutralizing antibodies encoded by the VH3-53 gene segment with short CDRH3 loops that block ACE2 and bind only to ‘up’ RBDs; (2) ACE2-blocking neutralizing antibodies that bind both up and ‘down’ RBDs and can contact adjacent RBDs; (3) neutralizing antibodies that bind outside the ACE2 site and recognize both up and down RBDs; and (4) previously described antibodies that do not block ACE2 and bind only to up RBDs9. Class 2 contained four neutralizing antibodies with epitopes that bridged RBDs, including a VH3-53 antibody that used a long CDRH3 with a hydrophobic tip to bridge between adjacent down RBDs, thereby locking the spike into a closed conformation. Epitope and paratope mapping revealed few interactions with host-derived N-glycans and minor contributions of antibody somatic hypermutations to epitope contacts. Affinity measurements and mapping of naturally occurring and in vitro-selected spike mutants in 3D provided insight into the potential for SARS-CoV-2 to escape from antibodies elicited during infection or delivered therapeutically. These classifications and structural analyses provide rules for assigning current and future human RBD-targeting antibodies into classes, evaluating avidity effects and suggesting combinations for clinical use, and provide insight into immune responses against SARS-CoV-2. Eight structures of human neutralizing antibodies that target the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain are reported and classified into four categories, suggesting combinations for clinical use."
https://openalex.org/W3091894549,"The potential of genome editing to improve the agronomic performance of crops is often limited by low plant regeneration efficiencies and few transformable genotypes. Here, we show that expression of a fusion protein combining wheat GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR 4 (GRF4) and its cofactor GRF-INTERACTING FACTOR 1 (GIF1) substantially increases the efficiency and speed of regeneration in wheat, triticale and rice and increases the number of transformable wheat genotypes. GRF4-GIF1 transgenic plants were fertile and without obvious developmental defects. Moreover, GRF4-GIF1 induced efficient wheat regeneration in the absence of exogenous cytokinins, which facilitates selection of transgenic plants without selectable markers. We also combined GRF4-GIF1 with CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing and generated 30 edited wheat plants with disruptions in the gene Q (AP2L-A5). Finally, we show that a dicot GRF-GIF chimera improves regeneration efficiency in citrus, suggesting that this strategy can be applied to dicot crops."

The study reported that patients with bulky tumors, a known high-risk feature defined as greater than clinical T2 disease, had fewer responses, with pathological complete response rate of 17%2. Here we report on the first pilot combination neoadjuvant trial ( NCT02812420 ) with anti-PD-L1 (durvalumab) plus anti-CTLA-4 (tremelimumab) in cisplatin-ineligible patients, with all tumors identified as having high-risk features (n = 28). High-risk features were defined by bulky tumors, variant histology, lymphovascular invasion, hydronephrosis and/or high-grade upper tract disease3–5. The primary endpoint was safety and we observed 6 of 28 patients (21%) with grade ≥3 immune-related adverse events, consisting of asymptomatic laboratory abnormalities (n = 4), hepatitis and colitis (n = 2). We also observed pathological complete response of 37.5% and downstaging to pT1 or less in 58% of patients who completed surgery (n = 24). In summary, we provide initial safety, efficacy and biomarker data with neoadjuvant combination anti-PD-L1 plus anti-CTLA-4, which warrants further development for patients with localized urothelial carcinoma, especially cisplatin-ineligible patients with high-risk features who do not currently have an established standard-of-care neoadjuvant treatment. Neoadjuvant combination of immune checkpoint therapy in patients with cisplatin-ineligible bladder cancer achieves clinical efficacy and uncovers immune features as potential predictive biomarkers of treatment response."
https://openalex.org/W3092444112,"Vα24-invariant natural killer T (NKT) cells have shown potent anti-tumor properties in murine tumor models and have been linked to favorable outcomes in patients with cancer. However, low numbers of these cells in humans have hindered their clinical applications. Here we report interim results from all three patients enrolled on dose level 1 in a phase 1 dose-escalation trial of autologous NKT cells engineered to co-express a GD2-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) with interleukin-15 in children with relapsed or resistant neuroblastoma (NCT03294954). Primary and secondary objectives were to assess safety and anti-tumor responses, respectively, with immune response evaluation as an additional objective. We ex vivo expanded highly pure NKT cells (mean ± s.d., 94.7 ± 3.8%) and treated patients with 3 × 106 CAR-NKT cells per square meter of body surface area after lymphodepleting conditioning with cyclophosphamide/fludarabine (Cy/Flu). Cy/Flu conditioning was the probable cause for grade 3–4 hematologic adverse events, as they occurred before CAR-NKT cell infusion, and no dose-limiting toxicities were observed. CAR-NKT cells expanded in vivo, localized to tumors and, in one patient, induced an objective response with regression of bone metastatic lesions. These initial results suggest that CAR-NKT cells can be expanded to clinical scale and safely applied to treat patients with cancer. In an interim analysis of a first-in-human phase 1 trial of patients with neuroblastoma, highly pure GD2-specific CAR-NKT cells were well tolerated with no observed dose-limiting toxicities."
https://openalex.org/W3092266204,"Cardiomyocyte loss after injury results in adverse remodelling and fibrosis, inevitably leading to heart failure. The ERBB2–Neuregulin and Hippo–YAP signalling pathways are key mediators of heart regeneration, yet the crosstalk between them is unclear. We demonstrate that transient overexpression of activated ERBB2 in cardiomyocytes (OE CMs) promotes cardiac regeneration in a heart failure model. OE CMs present an epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like regenerative response manifested by cytoskeletal remodelling, junction dissolution, migration and extracellular matrix turnover. We identified YAP as a critical mediator of ERBB2 signalling. In OE CMs, YAP interacts with nuclear-envelope and cytoskeletal components, reflecting an altered mechanical state elicited by ERBB2. We identified two YAP-activating phosphorylations on S352 and S274 in OE CMs, which peak during metaphase, that are ERK dependent and Hippo independent. Viral overexpression of YAP phospho-mutants dampened the proliferative competence of OE CMs. Together, we reveal a potent ERBB2-mediated YAP mechanotransduction signalling, involving EMT-like characteristics, resulting in robust heart regeneration. Aharonov et al. use in vivo genetic approaches to show that ErBB2-mediated YAP activation initiates epithelial–mesenchymal transition-like processes and dedifferentiation of cardiomyocytes to drive heart regeneration."

https://openalex.org/W3091855256,"Aberrant epithelial reprogramming can induce metaplastic differentiation at sites of tissue injury that culminates in transformed barriers composed of scar and metaplastic epithelium. While the plasticity of epithelial stem cells is well characterized, the identity and role of the niche has not been delineated in metaplasia. Here, we show that Gli1+ mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), previously shown to contribute to myofibroblasts during scarring, promote metaplastic differentiation of airway progenitors into KRT5+ basal cells. During fibrotic repair, Gli1+ MSCs integrate hedgehog activation signalling to upregulate BMP antagonism in the progenitor niche that promotes metaplasia. Restoring the balance towards BMP activation attenuated metaplastic KRT5+ differentiation while promoting adaptive alveolar differentiation into SFTPC+ epithelium. Finally, fibrotic human lungs demonstrate altered BMP activation in the metaplastic epithelium. These findings show that Gli1+ MSCs integrate hedgehog signalling as a rheostat to control BMP activation in the progenitor niche to determine regenerative outcome in fibrosis. Cassandras et al. show that Gli1-expressing mesenchymal stromal cells promote metaplastic differentiation of airway progenitors into basal cells by antagonizing BMP signalling in lung fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W3091899539,"As the spread of COVID19 in the US continues to grow, local and state officials face difficult decisions about when and how to transition to a “new normal.” The goal of this study is to project the number of COVID19 infections and resulting severe outcomes, and the need for hospital capacity under social distancing, particularly, shelter-in-place and voluntary quarantine for the State of Georgia. We developed an agent-based simulation model to project the infection spread. The model utilizes COVID19-specific parameters and data from Georgia on population interactions and demographics. The simulation study covered a seven and a half-month period, testing different social distancing scenarios, including baselines (no-intervention or school closure only) and combinations of shelter-in-place and voluntary quarantine with different timelines and compliance levels. The following outcomes are compared at the state and community levels: the number and percentage of cumulative and daily new symptomatic and asymptomatic infections, hospitalizations, and deaths; COVID19-related demand for hospital beds, ICU beds, and ventilators. The results suggest that shelter-in-place followed by voluntary quarantine reduced peak infections from approximately 180K under no intervention and 113K under school closure, respectively, to below 53K, and delayed the peak from April to July or later. Increasing shelter-in-place duration from four to five weeks yielded 2–9% and 3–11% decrease in cumulative infection and deaths, respectively. Regardless of the shelter-in-place duration, increasing voluntary quarantine compliance decreased daily new infections from almost 53K to 25K, and decreased cumulative infections by about 50%. The cumulative number of deaths ranged from 6,660 to 19,430 under different scenarios. Peak infection date varied across scenarios and counties; on average, increasing shelter-in-place duration delayed the peak day by 6 days. Overall, shelter-in-place followed by voluntary quarantine substantially reduced COVID19 infections, healthcare resource needs, and severe outcomes."

https://openalex.org/W3092591914,"5-FU is one of the key drugs in the treatment of gastric cancer (GC). Much evidence has shown that cancer stem cells (CSCs) play a key role in the acquisition of drug resistance. The organoid is a novel 3D cell culture system technology that sustains stem-cell-driven formation of near-physiological, self-renewing tissues using specific niche factors in a dish. In this study, we established GC organoids (GCOs) and gradually treated them with higher concentrations of 5-FU. We successfully harvested four 5-FU-resistant GCOs, which were supported by significant changes in the expression of molecules related to 5-FU metabolism. We then performed microarray analysis using three normal gastric organoids and three pairs of 5-FU-resistant and parental GCOs. Through the comparison of expression profiles and further validation, we chose KHDRBS3 as a target gene. We found KHDRBS3 to be an independent prognostic factor in GC patients, especially in GC patients treated with 5-FU chemotherapy. We also determined that KHDRBS3 might play an important role in the acquisition of stem cell-like features, such as multi-drug resistance and organoid formation, by regulating CD44 variant expression. We found KHDRBS3, which is thought to play an important role in the acquisition of characteristics of CSCs in GC, to be a promising candidate marker for predicting therapeutic effect and prognosis in GC patients."

https://openalex.org/W3092128800,"Portfolio construction is one of the most critical problems in financial markets. In this paper, a new two-phase robust portfolio selection and optimization approach is proposed to deal with the uncertainty of the data, increasing the robustness of investment process against uncertainty, decreasing computational complexity, and comprehensive assessments of stocks from different financial aspects and criteria are provided. In the first phase of this approach, all candidate stocks' efficiency is measured using a robust data envelopment analysis (RDEA) method. Then in the second phase, by applying robust mean-semi variance-liquidity (RMSVL) and robust mean-absolute deviation-liquidity (RMADL) models, the amount of investment in each qualified stock is determined. Finally, the proposed approach is implemented in a real case study of the Tehran stock exchange (TSE). Additionally, a sensitivity analysis of all robust models of this study is examined. Illustrative results show that the proposed approach is effective for portfolio selection and optimization in the presence of uncertain data."
https://openalex.org/W3092058903,"The influence of genetic background on driver mutations is well established; however, the mechanisms by which the background interacts with Mendelian loci remain unclear. We performed a systematic secondary-variant burden analysis of two independent cohorts of patients with Bardet–Biedl syndrome (BBS) with known recessive biallelic pathogenic mutations in one of 17 BBS genes for each individual. We observed a significant enrichment of trans-acting rare nonsynonymous secondary variants in patients with BBS compared with either population controls or a cohort of individuals with a non-BBS diagnosis and recessive variants in the same gene set. Strikingly, we found a significant over-representation of secondary alleles in chaperonin-encoding genes—a finding corroborated by the observation of epistatic interactions involving this complex in vivo. These data indicate a complex genetic architecture for BBS that informs the biological properties of disease modules and presents a model for secondary-variant burden analysis in recessive disorders. Analysis of two independent cohorts of patients with Bardet–Biedl syndrome (BBS) with known recessive biallelic pathogenic mutations in one of 17 BBS genes shows an enrichment of rare nonsynonymous secondary variants in the same gene set, with significant over-representation of secondary alleles in chaperonin-encoding genes."
https://openalex.org/W3092522893,"It is considered that intestinal barrier dysfunction and systemic endotoxemia drive obesity and its related complications. However, what causes barrier dysfunction remains to be elucidated. Here, we showed that the gut microbiota from high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice had impaired ability to degrade dietary flavonoids, and in correspondence, the microbial-derived flavonoid metabolite desaminotyrosine (DAT) was reduced. Supplementation of DAT in the drinking water was able to counter the HFD-induced body fat mass accumulation and body weight increment. This is correlated with the role of DAT in maintaining mucosal immune homeostasis to protect barrier integrity. DAT could attenuate dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced mucosal inflammation in a type I interferon signal-dependent manner. Furthermore, intraperitoneal injection of DAT-protected mice from bacterial endotoxin-induced septic shock. Together, we identified DAT as a gut microbiota-derived anti-inflammatory metabolite that functions to modulate local and systemic immune homeostasis. Our data support the notion of dysbiosis being an important driving force of mucosal barrier dysfunction and systemic metabolic complications."
https://openalex.org/W3092206077,"Immune dysregulation is among the main adverse outcomes of spaceflight. Despite the crucial role of the antibody repertoire in host protection, the effects of spaceflight on the human antibody repertoire are unknown. Consequently, using high-throughput sequencing, we examined the IgM repertoire of five cosmonauts 25 days before launch, after 64 ± 11 and 129 ± 20 days spent on the International Space Station (ISS), and at 1, 7, and 30 days after landing. This is the first study of this kind in humans. Our data revealed that the IgM repertoire of the cosmonauts was different from that of control subjects (n = 4) prior to launch and that two out the five analyzed cosmonauts presented significant changes in their IgM repertoire during the mission. These modifications persisted up to 30 days after landing, likely affected the specificities of IgM binding sites, correlated with changes in the V(D)J recombination process responsible for creating antibody genes, and coincided with a higher stress response. These data confirm that the immune system of approximately half of the astronauts who spent 6 months on the ISS is sensitive to spaceflight conditions, and reveal individual responses indicating that personalized approaches should be implemented during future deep-space exploration missions that will be of unprecedented durations."
https://openalex.org/W3091854824,"Previous research shows that there is a correlation between attitudes and academic achievement. In this article, we analyze for the first time the impact of interactive groups (IG) and dialogic literary gatherings (DLG) on the attitudes that students show towards learning. A quantitative approach has been performed using attitude tests validated by previous research. The data suggest that in both cases, the participants show positive attitudes. The social context has an important influence on students’ attitudes. The items with higher correlations include group work, mutual support, and distributed cognition. In the case of IGs, group work is much more appreciated, while in the case of DLGs, self-image and self-confidence are the two most clearly valued attitudes. The positive impact of IGs and DLGs on students’ attitudes may have potential for teachers in transforming their practices and decision-making within the classroom."
https://openalex.org/W3092300114,"Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) is a commensal bacterium of great importance to human health due to its ability to induce colitis and cause colon tumor formation in mice through the production of B. fragilis toxin (BFT). The formation of tumors is dependent on a pro-inflammatory signaling cascade, which begins with the disruption of epithelial barrier integrity through cleavage of E-cadherin. Here, we show that BFT increases levels of glucosylceramide, a vital intestinal sphingolipid, both in mice and in colon organoids (colonoids) generated from the distal colons of mice. When colonoids are treated with BFT in the presence of an inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase (GCS), the enzyme responsible for generating glucosylceramide, colonoids become highly permeable, lose structural integrity, and eventually burst, releasing their contents into the extracellular matrix. By increasing glucosylceramide levels in colonoids via an inhibitor of glucocerebrosidase (GBA, the enzyme that degrades glucosylceramide), colonoid permeability was reduced, and bursting was significantly decreased. In the presence of BFT, pharmacological inhibition of GCS caused levels of tight junction protein 1 (TJP1) to decrease. However, when GBA was inhibited, TJP1 levels remained stable, suggesting that BFT-induced production of glucosylceramide helps to stabilize tight junctions. Taken together, our data demonstrate a glucosylceramide-dependent mechanism by which the colon epithelium responds to BFT."

https://openalex.org/W3091939014,"Stock market, is one of the most important financial market which has a close relationship with a country's economy, due to which it is often called the barometer of the economy. Over the past 25 years, the stock markets have been affected by different global economic shocks. Various researchers have analyzed different aspects of these effects one by one, however, this study is an assessment of stock market interrelationship of emeriging Asian economies which include most of the East Asian, and Southeast Asian emerging economies with special focus on China for past decades during which different crisis occurred. We used Morgan Stanley capital international (MSCI) daily indices data for each stock market and compared Chinese stock market with the stock markets of India, Pakistan, Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia. We analyzed the data through the individual wavelet power spectrum, cross-wavelet transform and wavelet coherence, to determine the correlation and volatility among the selected stock markets. These model have the power to analyze co-movements among these countries with respect to both frequency and time spaces. Our findings show that there are co-movement patterns of higher frequencies during the crises periods of 1997, 2008 and 2015. The dependency strength among the considered economies is noted to increase in the crisis periods, which implies increased short- and long-term benefits for the investors. From a financial point of view, it has been determined that the co-movement strength among the emerging economies of Asia may have an effect on the VaR (Value at Risk) levels of a multi-country portfolio. Furthermore, the stock market of China shows a high correlation with the other six Asian stock emerging markets in both high and low-frequency spectrums. The association of the south and east Asian stock market with Chinese stock markets show the interconnection of these economies with the economy of China since past two decades. These findings are useful for investors, portfolio managers and the policymaker around the globe."
https://openalex.org/W3092401072,"Background Trauma is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), trauma patients have a higher risk of experiencing delays to care due to limited hospital resources and difficulties in reaching a health facility. Reducing delays to care is an effective method for improving trauma outcomes. However, few studies have investigated the variety of care delays experienced by trauma patients in LMICs. The objective of this study was to describe the prevalence of pre- and in-hospital delays to care, and their association with poor outcomes among trauma patients in a low-income setting. Methods We used a prospective traumatic brain injury (TBI) registry from Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Center in Moshi, Tanzania to model nine unique delays to care. Multiple regression was used to identify delays significantly associated with poor in-hospital outcomes. Results Our analysis included 3209 TBI patients. The most common delay from injury occurrence to hospital arrival was 1.1 to 4.0 hours (31.9%). Most patients were evaluated by a physician within 15.0 minutes of arrival (69.2%). Nearly all severely injured patients needed and did not receive a brain computed tomography scan (95.0%). A majority of severely injured patients needed and did not receive oxygen (80.8%). Predictors of a poor outcome included delays to lab tests, fluids, oxygen, and non-TBI surgery. Conclusions Time to care data is informative, easy to collect, and available in any setting. Our time to care data revealed significant constraints to non-personnel related hospital resources. Severely injured patients with the greatest need for care lacked access to medical imaging, oxygen, and surgery. Insights from our study and future studies will help optimize resource allocation in low-income hospitals thereby reducing delays to care and improving trauma outcomes in LMICs."
https://openalex.org/W3092260179,"Fluorescence flow cytometry is increasingly being used to quantify single-cell expression distributions in bacteria in high-throughput. However, there has been no systematic investigation into the best practices for quantitative analysis of such data, what systematic biases exist, and what accuracy and sensitivity can be obtained. We investigate these issues by measuring the same E. coli strains carrying fluorescent reporters using both flow cytometry and microscopic setups and systematically comparing the resulting single-cell expression distributions. Using these results, we develop methods for rigorous quantitative inference of single-cell expression distributions from fluorescence flow cytometry data. First, we present a Bayesian mixture model to separate debris from viable cells using all scattering signals. Second, we show that cytometry measurements of fluorescence are substantially affected by autofluorescence and shot noise, which can be mistaken for intrinsic noise in gene expression, and present methods to correct for these using calibration measurements. Finally, we show that because forward- and side-scatter signals scale non-linearly with cell size, and are also affected by a substantial shot noise component that cannot be easily calibrated unless independent measurements of cell size are available, it is not possible to accurately estimate the variability in the sizes of individual cells using flow cytometry measurements alone. To aid other researchers with quantitative analysis of flow cytometry expression data in bacteria, we distribute E-Flow, an open-source R package that implements our methods for filtering debris and for estimating true biological expression means and variances from the fluorescence signal. The package is available at https://github.com/vanNimwegenLab/E-Flow."

Antigenic variation of MgpB and MgpC, the immunodominant adherence proteins of M. genitalium, is thought to contribute to immune evasion and chronic infection. We investigated the evolution of mgpB and mgpC sequences in men with non-gonococcal urethritis persistently infected with M. genitalium, including two men with anti-M. genitalium antibodies at enrollment and two that developed antibodies during follow-up. Each of the four patients was persistently infected with a different strain type and each patient produced antibodies targeting MgpB and MgpC. Amino acid sequence evolution in the variable regions of MgpB and MgpC occurred in all four patients with changes observed in single and multiple variable regions over time. Using the available crystal structure of MgpC of the G37 type strain we found that predicted conformational B cell epitopes localize predominantly to the variable region of MgpC, amino acids that changed during patient infection lie in these epitopes, and variant amino acids are in close proximity to the conserved sialic acid binding pocket. These findings support the hypothesis that sequence variation functions to avoid specific antibodies thereby contributing to persistence in the genital tract."
https://openalex.org/W3092329777,"A successful acute inflammatory response results in the elimination of infectious agents by neutrophils and monocytes, followed by resolution and repair through tissue-resident and recruited macrophages. Resolvins (D-series and E-series) are pro-resolving lipid mediators involved in resolution and tissue repair, whose intracellular signaling remains of interest. Here, we report that D-series resolvins (RvD1- RvD5) activate phospholipase D (PLD), a ubiquitously expressed membrane lipase enzyme activity in modulating phagocyte functions. The mechanism for PLD-mediated actions of Resolvin-D5 (RvD5) in polarizing macrophages (M1-like toward M2-like) was found to be two-pronged: (a) RvD5 inhibits post-transcriptional modifications, by miRs and 3'exonucleases that process PLD2 mRNA, thus increasing PLD2 expression and activity; and (b) RvD5 enhances PLD2-S6Kinase signaling required for membrane expansion and efferocytosis. In an in vivo model of second organ reflow injury, we found that RvD5 did not reduce lung neutrophil myeloperoxidase levels in PLD2-/- mice compared to WT and PLD1-/- mice, confirming a novel role of PLD2 as the isoform in RvD5-mediated resolution processes.

https://openalex.org/W3091962561,"Locally produced in human granulosa cells of the developing follicle, bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) plays a crucial role in the regulation of ovarian folliculogenesis and luteal formation. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is an intraovarian neurotrophic factor that has been shown to promote oocyte maturation and subsequent fertilization competency. At present, little is known regarding the intracellular regulation, assembly and secretion of endogenous BDNF in human granulosa cells. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of BMP2 on the expression and production of BDNF in human granulosa cells and the molecular mechanisms underlying this effect. An immortalized human granulosa cell line (SVOG) and primary human granulosa-lutein (hGL) cells were utilized as in vitro study models. Our results showed that BMP2 significantly increased the mRNA and secreted levels of BDNF. Additionally, BMP2 upregulated the expression of furin at the transcriptional and translational levels. Knockdown of endogenous furin partially attenuated the BMP2-induced increase in BDNF production, indicating that furin is involved in the maturation process of BDNF. Using pharmacological (kinase receptor inhibitors) and siRNA-mediated inhibition approaches, we demonstrated that BMP2-induced upregulation of BDNF and furin expression is most likely mediated by the activin receptor-like kinase (ALK)2/ALK3-SMAD4 signaling pathway. Notably, analysis using clinical samples revealed that there was a positive correlation between follicular fluid concentrations of BMP2 and those of BDNF. These results indicate that BMP2 increases the production of mature BDNF by upregulating the precursor BDNF and promoting the proteolytic processing of mature BDNF. Finally, we also investigated the effects of BMP2 on ovarian steroidogenesis and the results showed that BMP2 treatment significantly increased the accumulated level of estradiol (by upregulating the expression of FSH receptor and cytochrome P450 aromatase), whereas it decreased the accumulated level of progesterone (by downregulating the expression of LH receptors and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein) in primary hGL cells. Our findings provide a novel paracrine mechanism underlying the regulation of an intraovarian growth factor in human granulosa cells."

Clinical and molecular characteristics differ between right-sided and left-sided colorectal cancer (CRC). This study aimed to clarify the correlation between CRC sidedness and tumor immunity.
Methods
A total of 102 patients who underwent curative colectomy for stage II/III CRC were included in this study. The expression of programmed cell death (PD)-1, PD1-ligand 1 (PD-L1), forkhead box P3 (Foxp3), transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, and indoleamine-pyrrole 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) were examined using immunohistochemistry and the relationships between sidedness and several prognostic factors were examined.
Results
Clinicopathological factors were not significantly different between right- and left-sided CRC. The tumor immunity-related molecule PD-L1 was more highly expressed in right-sided than in left-sided CRC (62.9% vs. 30.6%, p<0.01). No significant difference was found in overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) by sidedness. PD-1 and Foxp3 expression were significant prognostic factors for OS. Lymph node metastasis (N), lymphatic invasion (ly), and PD-L1 expression were significant prognostic factors for DFS. In right-sided CRC, IDO-positive patients had a poor OS (p<0.05), and IDO was the only independent prognostic indicator for OS. N and venous invasion were identified as independent prognostic indicators for DFS. In left-sided CRC, univariate analysis identified PD-1, PD-L1, and Foxp3 expression as significant predictors of poor OS. Multivariate analysis confirmed PD-L1 expression as an independent prognostic indicator. N, ly, and PD-L1 expression levels were identified as significant predictors of poor DFS.
Conclusions
The prognostic factors were IDO in right-sided CRC and PD-L1 and Foxp3 in left-sided CRC. These findings indicated that tumor immunity might play different roles depending upon sidedness. Tumor location may be an important factor to consider when assessing immune response and therapeutic decisions in CRC patients."
https://openalex.org/W3091944119,"Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) is a member of the Rho family of GTPases that functions as a molecular switch to regulate many important cellular events including actin cytoskeleton remodeling during neurite outgrowth. Engulfment and cell motility 1 (ELMO1)-dedicator of cytokinesis 1 (DOCK180) is a bipartite guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) complex that has been reported to activate Rac1 on the plasma membrane (PM). Emerging evidence suggests that the small GTPase ADP ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) activates Rac1 via the ELMO1/DOCK180 complex. However, the exact mechanism by which ARF6 triggers ELMO1/DOCK180-mediated Rac1 signaling remains unclear. Here, we report that the neuronal scaffold protein FE65 serves as a functional link between ARF6 and ELMO1, allowing the formation of a multimeric signaling complex. Interfering with formation of this complex by transfecting either FE65-binding-defective mutants or FE65 siRNA attenuates both ARF6-ELMO1-mediated Rac1 activation and neurite elongation. Notably, the PM trafficking of ELMO1 is markedly decreased in cells with suppressed expression of either FE65 or ARF6. Likewise, this process is attenuated in the FE65-binding-defective mutants transfected cells. Moreover, overexpression of FE65 increases the amount of ELMO1 in the recycling endosome, an organelle responsible for returning proteins to the PM, whereas knockout of FE65 shows opposite effect. Together, our data indicates that FE65 potentiates ARF6-Rac1 signaling by orchestrating ARF6 and ELMO1 to promote the PM trafficking of ELMO1 via the endosomal recycling pathway, and thus, promotes Rac1-mediated neurite outgrowth."

Recent research conducted under the framework of the PROTON project (Horizon 2020) has analyzed the social and ethical impacts of counter-terrorism and organized crime policies in six European countries. In this article we discuss some identified common features among practices that, developed by organized actors operating at the local level (e.g.: grassroots-based associations, educational institutions, other type of organized networks for prevention, NGOs), are contributing to preventing youth violent radicalization, a phenomenon of growing concern in Europe and beyond. Standing on a solid rejection to violence, these shared features are the following: a bottom-up approach in setting allies with key stakeholders from the community or/and family members to intervene; the promotion of trustworthy and healthy friendship relationships; debunking the lure surrounding violent subjects (“false heroes”) and violence in the different contexts, especially in the socioeducational one."
https://openalex.org/W3091873199,"Inorganic arsenic (iAs/As2 O32- ) is an environmental toxicant found in watersheds around the world including in densely populated areas. iAs is a class I carcinogen known to target the skin, lungs, bladder, and digestive organs, but its role as a primary breast carcinogen remains controversial. Here, we examined a different possibility: that exposure to iAs promotes the transition of well-differentiated epithelial breast cancer cells characterized by estrogen and progesterone receptor expression (ER+/PR+), to more basal phenotypes characterized by active proliferation, and propensity to metastasis in vivo. Our results indicate two clear phenotypic responses to low-level iAs that depend on the duration of the exposure. Short-term pulses of iAs activate ER signaling, consistent with its reported pseudo-estrogen activity, but longer-term, chronic treatments for over 6 months suppresses both ER and PR expression and signaling. In fact, washout of these chronically exposed cells for up to 1 month failed to fully reverse the transcriptional and phenotypic effects of prolonged treatments, indicating durable changes in cellular physiologic identity. RNA-seq studies found that chronic iAs drives the transition toward more basal phenotypes characterized by impaired hormone receptor signaling despite the conservation of estrogen receptor expression. Because treatments for breast cancer patients are largely designed based on the detection of hormone receptor expression, our results suggest greater scrutiny of ER+ cancers in patients exposed to iAs, because these tumors may spawn more aggressive phenotypes than unexposed ER+ tumors, in particular, basal subtypes that tend to develop therapy resistance and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W3092537804,"Acute otitis media (AOM) is the main indication for pediatric antibiotic prescriptions, accounting for 25% of prescriptions. While the use of topical drops can minimize the administered dose of antibiotic and adverse systemic effects compared to oral antibiotics, their use has limitations, partially due to low patient compliance, high dosing frequency, and difficulty of administration. Lack of proper treatment can lead to development of chronic OM, which may require invasive interventions. Previous studies have shown that gel-based drug delivery to the ear is possible with intratympanic injection or chemical permeation enhancers (CPEs). However, many patients are reluctant to accept invasive treatments and CPEs have demonstrated toxicity to the tympanic membrane (TM). We developed a novel method of delivering therapeutics to the TM and middle ear using a topical, thermoresponsive gel depot containing antibiotic-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) microspheres. Our in vitro and ex vivo results suggest that the sustained presentation can safely allow therapeutically relevant drug concentrations to penetrate the TM to the middle ear for up to 14 days. Animal results indicate sufficient antibiotic released for treatment from topical administration 24h after bacterial inoculation. However, animals treated 72h after inoculation, a more clinically relevant treatment practice, displayed spontaneous clearance of infection as is also often observed in the clinic. Despite this variability in the disease model, data suggest the system can safely treat bacterial infection, with future studies necessary to optimize microsphere formulations for scaled up dosage of antibiotic as well as further investigation of the influence of spontaneous bacterial clearance and of biofilm formation on effectiveness of treatment. To our knowledge, this study represents the first truly topical drug delivery system to the middle ear without the use of CPEs."
https://openalex.org/W3091821511,"Background Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have received political attention and commitment, yet surveillance is needed to measure progress and set priorities. Building on global estimates suggesting that Peru is not on target to meet the Sustainable Development Goal 3.4, we estimated the contribution of various NCDs to the change in unconditional probability of dying from NCDs in 25 regions in Peru. Methods Using national death registries and census data, we estimated the unconditional probability of dying between ages 30 and 69 from any and from each of the following NCDs: cardiovascular, cancer, diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases and chronic kidney disease. We estimated the contribution of each NCD to the change in the unconditional probability of dying from any of these NCDs between 2006 and 2016. Results The overall unconditional probability of dying improved for men (21.4%) and women (23.3%). Cancer accounted for 10.9% in men and 13.7% in women of the overall reduction; cardiovascular diseases also contributed substantially: 11.3% in men) and 9.8% in women. Consistently in men and women and across regions, diabetes moved in the opposite direction of the overall reduction in the unconditional probability of dying from any selected NCD. Diabetes contributed a rise in the unconditional probability of 3.6% in men and 2.1% in women. Conclusions Although the unconditional probability of dying from any selected NCD has decreased, diabetes would prevent Peru from meeting international targets. Policies are needed to prevent diabetes and to strengthen healthcare to avoid diabetes-related complications and delay mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3091910281,"Due to the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles, the use of nanomaterials increases over time in industrial and medical processes. We herein report the negative impact of nanoparticles, using solid growth conditions mimicking a biofilm, on the ability of Bacillus subtilis to fight against a stress. Bacteria have been exposed to sublethal doses of nanoparticles corresponding to conditions that bacteria may meet in their natural biotopes, the upper layer of soil or the gut microbiome. The analysis of the proteomic data obtained by shotgun mass spectrometry have shown that several metabolic pathways are affected in response to nanoparticles, n-ZnO or n-TiO2, or zinc salt: the methyglyoxal and thiol metabolisms, the oxidative stress and the stringent responses. Nanoparticles being embedded in the agar medium, these impacts are the consequence of a physiological adaptation rather than a physical cell injury. Overall, these results show that nanoparticles, by altering bacterial physiology and especially the ability to resist to a stress, may have profound influences on a “good bacteria”, Bacillus subtilis, in its natural biotope and moreover, on the global equilibrium of this biotope."

This study aimed to determine the direct effect of PGI2 on renal arteries and/or the whole renal vasculature and how each of these receptors is involved. Experiments were performed on vessels or perfused kidneys of wild-type mice and/or mice with deficiency in TP (TP-/- ) and/or EP3. Here we show that PGI2 did not evoke relaxation, but instead resulted in contraction of main renal arteries (from ~0.001-0.01 µM) or reduction of flow in perfused kidneys (from ~1 µM); either of them was reversed into a dilator response in TP-/- /EP3-/- counterparts. Also, we found that in renal arteries although it has a lesser effect than TP-/- on the maximal contraction to PGI2 (10 µM), EP3-/- but not TP-/- resulted in relaxation to the prostanoid at 0.01-1 µM. Meanwhile, TP-/- only significantly reduced the contractile activity evoked by PGI2 at ≥0.1 µM. These results demonstrate that PGI2 may evoke an overall vasoconstrictor response in the mouse renal vasculature, reflecting activities of TP and EP3 outweighing that of the vasodilator IP. Also, our results suggest that EP3, on which PGI2 can have a potency similar to that on IP, plays a major role in the vasoconstrictor effect of the prostanoid of low concentrations (≤1 µM), while TP, on which PGI2 has a lower potency but higher efficacy, accounts for a larger part of its maximal contractile activity."
https://openalex.org/W3092309792,"Human serum albumin presents in its primary structure only one free cysteine (Cys34) which constitutes the most abundant thiol of plasma. An antioxidant role can be attributed to this thiol, which is located in domain I of the protein. Herein we expressed domain I as a secretion protein using the yeast Pichia pastoris. In the initial step of ammonium sulfate precipitation, a brown pigment co-precipitated with domain I. Three chromatographic methods were evaluated, aiming to purify domain I from the pigment and other contaminants. Purification was achieved by cation exchange chromatography. The protein behaved as a non-covalent dimer. The primary sequence of domain I and the possibility of reducing Cys34 to the thiol state while avoiding the reduction of internal disulfides were confirmed by mass spectrometry. The reactivity of the thiol towards the disulfide 5,5´-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) was studied and compared to that of full-length albumin. A ~24-fold increase in the rate constant was observed for domain I with respect to the entire protein. These results open the door to further characterization of the Cys34 thiol and its oxidized derivatives."
https://openalex.org/W3092492883,"Background As part of a five year plan (2019–2023), the Informed Health Choices Project, is developing and evaluating resources for helping secondary school students learn to think critically about health claims and choices. We will bring together key stakeholders; such as secondary school teachers and students, our main target for the IHC secondary school resources, school administrators, policy makers, curriculum development specialists and parents, to enable us gain insight about the context. Objectives To ensure that stakeholders are effectively and appropriately engaged in the design, evaluation and dissemination of the learning resources. To evaluate the extent to which stakeholders were successfully engaged. Methods Using a multi-stage stratified sampling method, we will identify a representative sample of secondary schools with varied characteristics that might modify the effects of the learning resources such as, the school location (rural, semi-urban or urban), ownership (private, public) and ICT facilities (under resourced, highly resourced). A sample of schools will be randomly selected from the schools in each stratum. We will aim to recruit a diverse sample of students and secondary school teachers from those schools. Other stakeholders will be purposively selected to ensure a diverse range of experience and expertise. Results Together with the teacher and student networks and the advisory panels, we will establish measurable success criteria that reflect the objectives of engaging stakeholders at the start of the project and evaluate the extent to which those criteria were met at the end of the project. Conclusion We aim for an increase in research uptake, improve quality and appropriateness of research results, accountability and social justice."
https://openalex.org/W3092592362,"The serine/threonine protein kinase AKT is frequently over-activated in cancer and is associated with poor prognosis. As a central node in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which regulates various processes considered to be hallmarks of cancer, this kinase has become a prime target for cancer therapy. However, AKT has proven to be a highly complex target as it comes in three isoforms (AKT1, AKT2 and AKT3) which are highly homologous, yet non-redundant. The isoform-specific functions of the AKT kinases can be dependent on context (i.e. different types of cancer) and even opposed to one another. To date, there is no isoform-specific inhibitor available and no alternative to genetic approaches to study the function of a single AKT isoform. We have developed and characterized nanobodies that specifically interact with the AKT1 or AKT2 isoforms. These new tools should enable future studies of AKT1 and AKT2 isoform-specific functions. Furthermore, for both isoforms we obtained a nanobody that interferes with the AKT-PIP3-interaction, an essential step in the activation of the kinase. The nanobodies characterized in this study are a new stepping stone towards unravelling AKT isoform-specific signalling."
https://openalex.org/W3092617712,"Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) leads to offspring obesity. In a maternal food restriction (MFR) during pregnancy-related IUGR rat model, bone marrow stem cells showed enhanced adipogenic programming; however, the effect of IUGR on white adipose tissue (WAT) progenitors is unknown. Here, by mRNA and functional profiling, we determined sex-specific adipogenic programming of WAT progenitors isolated from pups on the postnatal day (PND) 1 and 21. On PND1, PPARγ and Pref-1 expression was significantly downregulated in preadipocytes of both MFR males and females; however, at PND21, preadipocytes of MFR males showed upregulation in these genes. Even following adipogenic induction, both male and female MFR adipocytes exhibited lower PPARγ, ADRP, and adiponectin levels at PND1; however, at PND21 MFR male adipocytes showed an upward trend in the expression of these genes. An adipogenesis-specific RT-PCR array showed that male MFR adipocytes were programmed to exhibit stronger adipogenic propensity than females. Last, serum sex hormone and adipocyte estrogen/testosterone receptor expression profiles provide preliminary insights into the possible mechanism underlying sex-specific adipogenic programming in the IUGR offspring. In summary, IUGR programs WAT preadipocytes to greater adipogenic potential in males. Although the altered adipogenic programming following MFR was detectable at PND1, the changes were more pronounced at PND21, suggesting a potential role of postnatal nutrition in facilitating the sex-specific adipogenic programming in the IUGR offspring."
https://openalex.org/W3091881909,"This retrospective study was conducted to investigate the predictive factors associated with metamorphopsia after reduced-fluence photodynamic therapy (RFPDT) in patients with central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) with good baseline visual acuity. A total of 36 eyes of 36 consecutive patients with resolved CSC after RFPDT and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) better than 1.0 (logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution (logMAR) 0) at baseline were examined. Metamorphopsia was measured using M-CHARTS at 12 months after RFPDT. An average of the horizontal and vertical M-CHARTS scores was applied for defining the extent of metamorphopsia. The association between M-CHARTS score at 12 months after RFPDT and clinical parameters (age, sex, duration of symptoms, BCVA, and findings of optical coherence tomography (OCT)) was investigated at baseline or 12 months after RFPDT. The M-CHARTS score at 12 months correlated significantly with duration of symptoms (P = 0.005), baseline outer nuclear layer (ONL) thickness (P = 0.009), central foveal thickness (CFT) (P = 0.001) at 12 months, and ONL thickness (P = 0.001) at 12 months after RFPDT. In the multivariate analysis of baseline-related factors, thinner ONL thickness before RFPDT (P = 0.010) was significantly associated with large metamorphopsia at 12 months after RFPDT in CSC patients with good baseline BCVA. Baseline ONL thickness may be a useful predictive factor of metamorphopsia after RFPDT in CSC patients with good baseline BCVA."
https://openalex.org/W3091886271,"The Probability of Pharmacology Success, or PoPS, is a powerful metric to inform progression decisions by quantifying a compound's overall pharmacological strength based on its mechanism. It is defined as the probability that X level of pharmacology is achieved in Y proportion of patients at a safe dose. The importance of adequate drug exposure, target engagement and functional pharmacology for enabling a compound's efficacy is widely recognized. The PoPS estimates how well these conditions are met by integrating the compound's pharmacological properties and the target's modulation needs for the intended indication, in a pharmacometric model that includes the knowledge uncertainty. We use examples to illustrate how it can be used to compare drug candidates under specified benefit and risk conditions, support first-in-human decisions based on exposure limits, advise preclinical lead optimisation, and define clinical-trial populations."
https://openalex.org/W3092102299,"In the present study, we attempted to investigate whether it is the game experience that underlies processes leading to increased risk-taking while playing video racing games (VRGs). The aim of the study was to examine the indirect effect of playing VRGs on risky driving behaviour through various dimensions of the game experience. Thus, we examined the subjective experience of participants playing various VRGs and questioned whether this influenced subsequent driving behaviour. The results of the present study show that aspects of the playing experience, in particular “flow” and “competence”, appear to be important in the regulation of risk appetite. It can be assumed that, rather than the mere playing of VRGs, the type of game experience during play is determinant for subsequent risk propensity while driving."
https://openalex.org/W3092297142,"Somatostatin analogs, which are used to treat neuroendocrine tumors, inhibit hormone secretion or promote tumor shrinkage; however, their efficacy varies between patients, possibly because of differential expression of somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) in tumors. In this study, we evaluated the regulatory mechanism underlying the expression of SSTR2, the main octreotide target. Thirty miRNAs were found to be dysregulated in neuroendocrine cells (INS-1 cells) incubated with octreotide compared to that in placebo-treated cells. Among the upregulated miRNAs, miR-16-5p was elevated after short-term octreotide treatment. We conducted in vitro experiments to determine whether the expression of miR-16-5p was associated with the regulation of SSTR2 expression and affected octreotide sensitivity in INS-1 cells. Overexpression of miR-16-5p by transfected mimics induced upregulation of SSTR2 expression. Additionally, the expression of miR-16-5p further enhanced octreotide-induced reduction in cell proliferation in both two- and three-dimensional culture of INS-1 cells. Thus, our results reveal the mechanism underlying SSTR2 expression regulation and may aid in developing therapeutic approaches for enhancing the response to octreotide, particularly in patients unresponsive to SSTR2-targeted somatostatin analog treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3092615326,"Where is the visual aesthetic preference rooted from and what’s its relationship with the perceptual preference that is emerging early? Do young children naturally prefer some visual stimuli or do they learn to appreciate visual stimuli for aesthetic pleasure? Here, for young preschool children who are on the age that the preferences are developing, we provide findings from a study to show that the interplay between early emerging perceptual sensitivity and perceptual exposure promotes the emergence of preschool children’s aesthetic preferences for simple visual patterns. Specifically in the experiments, 4-year-old children were exposed to either symmetric or asymmetric non-figurative forms in a perceptually demanding game; the group of children who received exposure to symmetric patterns showed aesthetic preference to the exposed patterns, while no preference was found in the group that received exposure to asymmetric patterns. The following recognition test then showed that the symmetric objects were differentiated better and remembered more clearly by the children, indicating that the symmetry was perceptually encoded better. These findings suggest that the early emerging perceptual sensitivity to ‘good features’ such as symmetry provides the prior cognitive prerequisites, allowing visual perceptual exposure to nourish the eventual formation of aesthetic preference. Thus, the preferences for aesthetic appreciation are likely the outcome of the interplay between biological and ecological adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W3091889075,"Background Calcium level is associated with sudden cardiac death based on several cohort studies. However, there is limited evidence on the association between ionized calcium, active form of calcium, and resuscitation outcome. This study aimed to evaluate the potential role of ionized calcium in predicting resuscitation outcome in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Methods We analyzed the Korean Cardiac Arrest Research Consortium data (KoCARC) registry, a web-based multicenter registry that included 65 participating hospitals throughout the Republic of Korea. The patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest over 19 years old and acquired laboratory data including calcium, ionized calcium, potassium, phosphorus, creatinine, albumin at emergency department (ED) arrival were included. The primary outcome was successful rate of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and the secondary outcomes were survival hospital discharge and favorable neurological outcome (cerebral performance category 1 or 2) at hospital discharge. Results Eight-hundred and eighty-three patients were enrolled in the final analysis and 448 cases (54%) had ROSC. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, ionized calcium level was associated with ROSC (odds ratio, 1.77; 95% CI1.28-2.45; p = 0.001) even though calcium level was not associated with ROSC (odds ratio, 0.87; 95% CI 0.70-1.08; p = 0.199). However, ionized calcium level was not associated with survival discharge (odds ratio, 0.99; 95% CI 0.72-1.36; p = 0.948) or favorable neurologic outcome (odds ratio, 0.45; 95% CI 0.03-6.55, p = 0.560). Conclusion A high ionized calcium level measured during cardiopulmonary resuscitation was associated with an increased likelihood of ROSC."

Considering costs and risks associated with invasive surveillance endoscopies better methods of risk stratification are required to assist decision-making and move toward more personalised tailoring of Barrett’s surveillance. Methods A Bayesian network was created by synthesizing data from published studies analysing risk factors for developing adenocarcinoma in Barrett’s oesophagus through a two-stage weighting process. Results Data was synthesized from 114 studies (n = 394,827) to create the Bayesian network, which was validated against a prospectively maintained institutional database (n = 571). Version 1 contained 10 variables (dysplasia, gender, age, Barrett’s segment length, statin use, proton pump inhibitor use, BMI, smoking, aspirin and NSAID use) and achieved AUC of 0.61. Version 2 contained 4 variables with the strongest evidence of association with the development of adenocarcinoma in Barrett’s (dysplasia, gender, age, Barrett’s segment length) and achieved an AUC 0.90. Conclusion This Bayesian network is unique in the way it utilizes published data to translate the existing empirical evidence surrounding the risk of developing adenocarcinoma in Barrett’s esophagus to make personalized risk predictions. Further work is required but this tool marks a vital step towards delivering a more personalized approach to Barrett’s surveillance."
https://openalex.org/W3092016262,"It is becoming clear that several human pathologies are caused by altered metabolic adaptations. During liver development, there are physiological changes, from the predominant utilization of glucose (fetal life) to the use of lipids (postnatal life). Fasting is another physiological stress that elicits well-known metabolic adjustments. We have reported the metabolic properties of cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), a member of the interleukin-6 family of cytokines. Here, we aimed at analyzing the role of CT-1 in response to these metabolic changes. We used different in vivo models. Furthermore, a differential study was carried out with wild-type and CT-1 null mice in fed (ad libitum) and food-restricted conditions. We demonstrated that Ct-1 is a metabolic gene induced in the liver via PPARα in response to lipids in mice (neonates- and food-restricted adults). We found that Ct-1 mRNA expression in white adipose tissue directly involved PPARα and PPARγ. Finally, the physiological role of CT-1 in fasting is confirmed by the impaired food restriction-induced adipose tissue lipid mobilization in CT-1 null mice. Our findings support a previously unrecognized physiological role of CT-1 in metabolic adaptations, through the regulation of lipid metabolism and contributes to fasting-induced free fatty acid mobilization."
https://openalex.org/W3092210563,"Background There is increasing demand for post-acute care services, which is amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic. Aims We studied the pattern of spatial association between post-acute care services and acute care facilities and evaluated how geographic variability could influence their use. Methods We compiled data on CMS-certified acute care and critical access hospitals and post-acute health care services (nursing homes, home health care services, inpatient rehabilitation facilities, long-term care hospitals, and hospice facilities). We used the colocation quotient (CLQ) to measure the magnitude and direction of association (clustering or segregation) between post-acute care providers and hospitals. This metric allows pairwise comparison of categorical data; a value <1 indicates spatial segregation and a value >1 spatial clustering. Unity marks the lack of spatial dependence (random distribution). Results With the exception of nursing homes (CLQ 1.26), all other types of post-acute care providers are spatially segregated from rural critical access hospitals. Long-term care facilities ranked first (had the lowest global CLQ, 0.06), hospice facilities ranked last (had the highest global CLQ estimate, 0.54). Instead, post-acute care services either clustered with (inpatient rehabilitation 2.76, long-term care 2.10, nursing homes 1.37) or were only weakly segregated (home health care 0.86) from acute care hospitals. Home health care (1.44), hospice services (1.46), and nursing homes (1.08) spatially clustered with the same category of services. Results were robust in the sensitivity analysis and we provided illustrative examples of local variation for the states of MA and IA. Conclusion Post-acute care services are isolated from critical access hospitals, and have a clustering pattern with the same category services and acute care hospitals. Such misdistribution of resources may result in both underuse and a substitution effect on the type of post-acute care between rural and urban areas and undermine public health during increasing demand, such as the COVID-19 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3092421056,"Water lilies (Nymphaea spp.) have diverse floral morphologies. Water lilies are not only commonly used as ornamental plants, but they are also important for understanding the diversification of basal angiosperms. Although the diversity in floral morphology of water lily provides useful information for evolutionary biology, horticulture, and horticultural science, it is difficult to describe and analyze the three-dimensional morphology of flowers. In this study, we propose a method to describe the floral morphology of water lily using a three-dimensional theoretical morphological model. The theoretical model was constructed based on three components, i.e., (1) the gradual change in size of floral organs, (2) spiral phyllotaxis, and (3) the interpolation of elevation angles, which were integrated into the model. We generated three-dimensional representation of water lily flowers and visualized theoretical morphospaces by varying each morphological parameter. The theoretical morphospace is a mathematical space of morphological spectrum generated by a theoretical morphological model. These morphospaces seems to display the large part of morphological variations of water lily. We measured morphological parameters of real flowers based on our theoretical model and display the occupation pattern of morphological parameters. We also surveyed the relation between morphological parameters and flower shape descriptions found in a catalog. In some parameters, we found breeders' description can link to our morphological model. In addition, the relationship between the global features of floral morphology and the parameters of the theoretical model was calculated with flower silhouettes simulated with a range of parameter values and the global features of the silhouette. We used two simple indices to assess the global morphological features, which were calculated with the convex hull. The results indicated that our method can effectively provide an objective and quantitative overview of the diversity in the floral morphology of water lily."

We use multinomial logistic regression models with the Chinese Household Income Project (CHIP) Survey Data of 2013. The findings show that while financial development has a negative and significant impact on particular trust but no impact on general trust, religion has a positive relationship with general trust but insignificant relationship with particular trust. This study further investigates the impact of interaction between financial development and religion on social trust. The joint effect of financial development and religion has significant and positive relationship with particular trust. This implies that while financialization destroys the traditional relatives and friends trust based on lending and borrowing in rural area, religiosity lessens the negative impact of financialization on particular trust."
https://openalex.org/W3092304358,"Global eutrophication degrades water quality in freshwater ecosystems and limits the availability of freshwater for human consumption. While current wastewater treatment facilities (WWTF) remove pathogens and pollutants, many US WWTF continue to discharge nutrients that contribute to eutrophication. Traditional nutrient removal technologies can effectively reduce eutrophication risk, but can have unintended negative consequences on human and environmental health. Alternatives, such as algae-based treatment systems, improve the sustainability of the nutrient recovery process by producing biomass that can be converted to biofuel. However, research is needed to increase the productivity of algal treatment systems to improve their economic viability. Because algae in wastewater treatment systems are grown in wastewater rich in nutrients, the algae could become limited by dissolved inorganic carbon. This hypothesis was tested in 1.2 m long recirculating floways (n = 8 for each treatment/control) by quantifying algal dry mass and wastewater nutrient concentrations in 3 independent experiments: (1) carbon dioxide gas infused vs air infused control; (2) hydrochloric acid acidified vs neutralized solution control vs no chemical addition control; and (3) sodium bicarbonate addition vs no chemical control. Results showed increases in algal biomass after 18 days in wastewater augmented with dissolved inorganic carbon (carbon dioxide or sodium bicarbonate). In contrast, maintaining wastewater at near neutral pH with hydrochloric acid reduced algal productivity relative to controls. Nutrient reductions generally paralleled algal biomass increases except in the bicarbonate addition experiment. These findings provide evidence for the importance of carbon limitation in algal wastewater treatment floways. These results could help explain why carbon dioxide infusions stimulate algae in treatment systems. Furthermore, these results suggest that algae in nutrient enriched, sun-exposed streams (e.g., agricultural ditches or urbanized streams) may become carbon limited during peak periods of productivity. These findings could have important implications for ecosystems undergoing eutrophication as atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations continue to rise."
https://openalex.org/W3092642018,"Hybrid incompatibility, such as sterility and inviability, prevents gene flow between closely-related populations as a reproductive isolation barrier. F1 hybrids between chickens and Japanese quail (hereafter, referred to as quail), exhibit a high frequency of developmental arrest at the preprimitive streak stage. To investigate the molecular basis of the developmental arrest at the preprimitive streak stage in chicken-quail F1 hybrid embryos, we investigated chromosomal abnormalities in the hybrid embryos using molecular cytogenetic analysis. In addition, we quantified gene expression in parental species and chicken- and quail-derived allele-specific expression in the hybrids at the early blastoderm and preprimitive streak stages by mRNA sequencing. Subsequently, we compared the directions of change in gene expression, including upregulation, downregulation, or no change, from the early blastoderm stage to the preprimitive streak stage between parental species and their hybrids. Chromosome analysis revealed that the cells of the hybrid embryos contained a fifty-fifty mixture of parental chromosomes, and numerical chromosomal abnormalities were hardly observed in the hybrid cells. Gene expression analysis revealed that a part of the genes that were upregulated from the early blastoderm stage to the preprimitive streak stage in both parental species exhibited no upregulation of both chicken- and quail-derived alleles in the hybrids. GO term enrichment analysis revealed that these misregulated genes are involved in various biological processes, including ribosome-mediated protein synthesis and cell proliferation. Furthermore, the misregulated genes included genes involved in early embryonic development, such as primitive streak formation and gastrulation. These results suggest that numerical chromosomal abnormalities due to a segregation failure does not cause the lethality of chicken-quail hybrid embryos, and that the downregulated expression of the genes that are involved in various biological processes, including translation and primitive streak formation, mainly causes the developmental arrest at the preprimitive streak stage in the hybrids."
