https://openalex.org/W975393094,"The presence of relatively high concentrations of y-aminobutyric acid in mammalian brain (1, 2) led to the discovery of a reaction utilizing this amino acid by what appeared to be transamination with a-ketoglutaric acid (3, 4). Studies with brain preparations (3, 4) were, however, handicapped by the particulate nature of the system catalyzing the reaction. Although active, soluble extracts were obtained from microorganisms (5-7), these were not further purified. Recent studies have implicated y-aminobutyric-glutamic transaminase (8) and succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (8, 9) as the successive, terminal steps in the conversion of pyrrolidine to succinic acid by a strain of Pseudomonas JIuorescens. Preliminary evidence suggested (8) that pyrrolidine was metabolized by way of the following successive intermediates: Al-pyrroline,l y-aminobutyric acid, succinic semialdehyde, and succinic acid. The present report summarizes the data on the purification and properties of y-aminobutyric-glutamic transaminase (Reaction 1) and presents a kinetic analysis of the reaction which it catalyzes. dehydrogenase described by Black (10) .2 Alternatively, the substrate specific, succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase from P. Jluorescens (9), utilizing either TPN or DPN, was employed. Although the pH of the standard incubation system was not optimal, considerable endogenous activity, i.e. reduction of pyridine nucleotide, found with the cruder fractions at higher pH values was minimized. Activity was followed at l-minute intervals for 5 minutes. Transaminase activity was a linear function of both time and protein concentration at rates of less than 0.05 pmole of DPNH (or TPNH) formed per minute. A unit of activity was defined as that amount of transaminase allowing the formation of 1 pmole of reduced pyridine nucleotide per minute in the standard assay system. Specific activity was expressed in terms of units ner mg. of protein."

In the standard assay, the mixture contains 0.05 ml of pterin carboxylic acid, 0.8 ml of phosphate buffer, and 0.02 to 0.15 ml of enzyme in a final volume of 1.0 ml. Incubation is carried out at 23° in a 1-ml Beckman quartz cuvette with a light path of 1.00 cm. Reaction is begun by the addition of enzyme, and readings of optical density are taken every 3 minutes thereafter. The control cuvette contains buffer and enzyme, but no pterin carboxylic acid. With crude preparations light measurement at 360 mμ is employed. However, with more purified fractions of the deaminase, it is possible to follow the course of the reaction at 290 mμ, the wavelength at which there is observed the largest AE value between substrate and product. The most satisfactory conditions for storage of enzyme fractions were found to be at pH 9.0 in 0.1 M Tris buffer at 0°. Under such conditions pterin deaminase activity remained almost unchanged for several weeks. The pH optimum for pterin deaminase activity occurs between pH 6.3 and 6.7. Although the reaction proceeds in the complete absence of phosphate, the rate of deamination is slightly faster in phosphate than in Tris buffer."

https://openalex.org/W2163346553,"Crystalline preparations of the glutamic dehydrogenase of beef liver contain from 2 to 4 gm. atoms of zinc per mole of enzyme protein (1). The dependence of the catalytic activity of glutamic dehydrogenase on the metal is inferred from (a) the concomitant increase of zinc to protein and activity to protein ratios during its crystallization and (b) the inhibition of enzyme activity by agents which form stable complexes with zinc ions in aqueous solutions. In this report the inhibition of glutamic dehydrogenase by metal-binding agents, including 1, IO-phenanthroline, is shown to depend on the ability of these agents to form a complex with zinc ions and to be qualitatively similar to that observed with yeast alcohol dehydrogenase, another zinc metallobehydrogenase. A mechanism for the inhibition of glutamic dehydrogenase by metal-binding agents similar to that observed for another zinc metallodehydrogenase, yeast alcohol dehydrogenase, (2, 3) is proposed, although glutamic dehydrogenase differs from alcohol dehydrogenase both with respect to the reaction it catalyzes and its protein size and structure."
https://openalex.org/W45763010,"It has been shown that treatment of animal diets with ethylene oxide results in severe destruction of thiamine, niacin, pyridoxine, riboflavin, and folic acid (2, 3) and of the essential amino acids, histidine, methionine (4)) and lysine (5). Consequently, studies were undertaken to elucidate the nature of the reactions of ethylene oxide with the above nutrients. The realization that a tertiary nitrogen group was common to six of the labile nutrients prompted the investigation of the reaction of ethylene oxide with pyridine and the closely related nicotinamide and nicotinic acid. Lohmann (6), in 1939, reported that the addition of ethylene oxide to pyridine or quinolme results in the formation of highly colored methanol-water soluble products of undetermined structure. Eastham et al. (7-9) demonstrated that ethylene oxide reacts as readily with tertiary as with primary and secondary amines, and that the reaction with pyridine, in the presence of an acid, yields the Nl-(2-hydroxyethyl)pyridinium salt. The rate of reaction in excess pyridine was shown to be second order, being proportional to the concentration of acid and epoxide. The present paper offers evidence that ethylene oxide reacts with nicotinamide under very mild conditions to yield, after acidification with HCl, the chloride of Nl-(2-hydroxyethyl)nicotinamide, and with nicotinic acid to produce the betaine of N1-(2-hydroxyethyl)nicotinic acid."

Subsequent investigations have shown that a heatstable cofactor of undetermined nature present in boiled cell extracts was required (2). Pyridine nucleotide reduction with hydrogen has since been demonstrated in a number of other microorganisms (3-5). The present study was undertaken to explore in greater detail the alternative routes of hydrogen oxidation in C. kluyveri. Particular attention was paid to a comparison of the requirements for pyridine nucleotide, flavin nucleotide, and dye reduction, The available data suggest that the unknown cofactor does not function in the activation of hydrogen but acts between an activated hydrogen intermediate and pyridine nucleotide. Additional evidence is also presented showing that more than one enzyme is required for pyridine nucleotide reduction with hydrogen. A preliminary report of these results has been published (6)."
