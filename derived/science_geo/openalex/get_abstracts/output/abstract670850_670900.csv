https://openalex.org/W3136616180,"The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein contains an immunodominant receptor-binding domain (RBD) targeted by most neutralizing antibodies (Abs) in COVID-19 patient plasma. Little is known about neutralizing Abs binding to epitopes outside the RBD and their contribution to protection. Here, we describe 41 human monoclonal Abs (mAbs) derived from memory B cells, which recognize the SARS-CoV-2 S N-terminal domain (NTD) and show that a subset of them neutralize SARS-CoV-2 ultrapotently. We define an antigenic map of the SARS-CoV-2 NTD and identify a supersite (designated site i) recognized by all known NTD-specific neutralizing mAbs. These mAbs inhibit cell-to-cell fusion, activate effector functions, and protect Syrian hamsters from SARS-CoV-2 challenge, albeit selecting escape mutants in some animals. Indeed, several SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 lineages, harbor frequent mutations within the NTD supersite, suggesting ongoing selective pressure and the importance of NTD-specific neutralizing mAbs for protective immunity and vaccine design."
https://openalex.org/W3138484572,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can have viral or non-viral causes1-5. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is an important driver of HCC. Immunotherapy has been approved for treating HCC, but biomarker-based stratification of patients for optimal response to therapy is an unmet need6,7. Here we report the progressive accumulation of exhausted, unconventionally activated CD8+PD1+ T cells in NASH-affected livers. In preclinical models of NASH-induced HCC, therapeutic immunotherapy targeted at programmed death-1 (PD1) expanded activated CD8+PD1+ T cells within tumours but did not lead to tumour regression, which indicates that tumour immune surveillance was impaired. When given prophylactically, anti-PD1 treatment led to an increase in the incidence of NASH-HCC and in the number and size of tumour nodules, which correlated with increased hepatic CD8+PD1+CXCR6+, TOX+, and TNF+ T cells. The increase in HCC triggered by anti-PD1 treatment was prevented by depletion of CD8+ T cells or TNF neutralization, suggesting that CD8+ T cells help to induce NASH-HCC, rather than invigorating or executing immune surveillance. We found similar phenotypic and functional profiles in hepatic CD8+PD1+ T cells from humans with NAFLD or NASH. A meta-analysis of three randomized phase III clinical trials that tested inhibitors of PDL1 (programmed death-ligand 1) or PD1 in more than 1,600 patients with advanced HCC revealed that immune therapy did not improve survival in patients with non-viral HCC. In two additional cohorts, patients with NASH-driven HCC who received anti-PD1 or anti-PDL1 treatment showed reduced overall survival compared to patients with other aetiologies. Collectively, these data show that non-viral HCC, and particularly NASH-HCC, might be less responsive to immunotherapy, probably owing to NASH-related aberrant T cell activation causing tissue damage that leads to impaired immune surveillance. Our data provide a rationale for stratification of patients with HCC according to underlying aetiology in studies of immunotherapy as a primary or adjuvant treatment."

The most common IDH1 mutation in gliomas affects codon 132 and encodes IDH1(R132H), which harbours a shared clonal neoepitope that is presented on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II4,5. An IDH1(R132H)-specific peptide vaccine (IDH1-vac) induces specific therapeutic T helper cell responses that are effective against IDH1(R132H)+ tumours in syngeneic MHC-humanized mice4,6-8. Here we describe a multicentre, single-arm, open-label, first-in-humans phase I trial that we carried out in 33 patients with newly diagnosed World Health Organization grade 3 and 4 IDH1(R132H)+ astrocytomas (Neurooncology Working Group of the German Cancer Society trial 16 (NOA16), ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02454634). The trial met its primary safety endpoint, with vaccine-related adverse events restricted to grade 1. Vaccine-induced immune responses were observed in 93.3% of patients across multiple MHC alleles. Three-year progression-free and death-free rates were 0.63 and 0.84, respectively. Patients with immune responses showed a two-year progression-free rate of 0.82. Two patients without an immune response showed tumour progression within two years of first diagnosis. A mutation-specificity score that incorporates the duration and level of vaccine-induced IDH1(R132H)-specific T cell responses was associated with intratumoral presentation of the IDH1(R132H) neoantigen in pre-treatment tumour tissue. There was a high frequency of pseudoprogression, which indicates intratumoral inflammatory reactions. Pseudoprogression was associated with increased vaccine-induced peripheral T cell responses. Combined single-cell RNA and T cell receptor sequencing showed that tumour-infiltrating CD40LG+ and CXCL13+ T helper cell clusters in a patient with pseudoprogression were dominated by a single IDH1(R132H)-reactive T cell receptor."
https://openalex.org/W3139423362,"Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a manifestation of systemic metabolic disease related to obesity, and causes liver disease and cancer1,2. The accumulation of metabolites leads to cell stress and inflammation in the liver3, but mechanistic understandings of liver damage in NASH are incomplete. Here, using a preclinical mouse model that displays key features of human NASH (hereafter, NASH mice), we found an indispensable role for T cells in liver immunopathology. We detected the hepatic accumulation of CD8 T cells with phenotypes that combined tissue residency (CXCR6) with effector (granzyme) and exhaustion (PD1) characteristics. Liver CXCR6+ CD8 T cells were characterized by low activity of the FOXO1 transcription factor, and were abundant in NASH mice and in patients with NASH. Mechanistically, IL-15 induced FOXO1 downregulation and CXCR6 upregulation, which together rendered liver-resident CXCR6+ CD8 T cells susceptible to metabolic stimuli (including acetate and extracellular ATP) and collectively triggered auto-aggression. CXCR6+ CD8 T cells from the livers of NASH mice or of patients with NASH had similar transcriptional signatures, and showed auto-aggressive killing of cells in an MHC-class-I-independent fashion after signalling through P2X7 purinergic receptors. This killing by auto-aggressive CD8 T cells fundamentally differed from that by antigen-specific cells, which mechanistically distinguishes auto-aggressive and protective T cell immunity."
https://openalex.org/W3139356564,"The prospect of building quantum circuits1,2 using advanced semiconductor manufacturing makes quantum dots an attractive platform for quantum information processing3,4. Extensive studies of various materials have led to demonstrations of two-qubit logic in gallium arsenide5, silicon6-12 and germanium13. However, interconnecting larger numbers of qubits in semiconductor devices has remained a challenge. Here we demonstrate a four-qubit quantum processor based on hole spins in germanium quantum dots. Furthermore, we define the quantum dots in a two-by-two array and obtain controllable coupling along both directions. Qubit logic is implemented all-electrically and the exchange interaction can be pulsed to freely program one-qubit, two-qubit, three-qubit and four-qubit operations, resulting in a compact and highly connected circuit. We execute a quantum logic circuit that generates a four-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state and we obtain coherent evolution by incorporating dynamical decoupling. These results are a step towards quantum error correction and quantum simulation using quantum dots."
https://openalex.org/W3136996287,"Influenza vaccines that confer broad and durable protection against diverse viral strains would have a major effect on global health, as they would lessen the need for annual vaccine reformulation and immunization1. Here we show that computationally designed, two-component nanoparticle immunogens2 induce potently neutralizing and broadly protective antibody responses against a wide variety of influenza viruses. The nanoparticle immunogens contain 20 haemagglutinin glycoprotein trimers in an ordered array, and their assembly in vitro enables the precisely controlled co-display of multiple distinct haemagglutinin proteins in defined ratios. Nanoparticle immunogens that co-display the four haemagglutinins of licensed quadrivalent influenza vaccines elicited antibody responses in several animal models against vaccine-matched strains that were equivalent to or better than commercial quadrivalent influenza vaccines, and simultaneously induced broadly protective antibody responses to heterologous viruses by targeting the subdominant yet conserved haemagglutinin stem. The combination of potent receptor-blocking and cross-reactive stem-directed antibodies induced by the nanoparticle immunogens makes them attractive candidates for a supraseasonal influenza vaccine candidate with the potential to replace conventional seasonal vaccines3. A nanoparticle influenza vaccine candidate is shown to induce broad cross-reactive antibody responses in animal models."

https://openalex.org/W3137654632,"Our knowledge of copy number evolution during the expansion of primary breast tumours is limited1,2. Here, to investigate this process, we developed a single-cell, single-molecule DNA-sequencing method and performed copy number analysis of 16,178 single cells from 8 human triple-negative breast cancers and 4 cell lines. The results show that breast tumours and cell lines comprise a large milieu of subclones (7-22) that are organized into a few (3-5) major superclones. Evolutionary analysis suggests that after clonal TP53 mutations, multiple loss-of-heterozygosity events and genome doubling, there was a period of transient genomic instability followed by ongoing copy number evolution during the primary tumour expansion. By subcloning single daughter cells in culture, we show that tumour cells rediversify their genomes and do not retain isogenic properties. These data show that triple-negative breast cancers continue to evolve chromosome aberrations and maintain a reservoir of subclonal diversity during primary tumour growth."

https://openalex.org/W3137413464,"The surface mixed layer of the world ocean regulates global climate by controlling heat and carbon exchange between the atmosphere and the oceanic interior1–3. The mixed layer also shapes marine ecosystems by hosting most of the ocean’s primary production4 and providing the conduit for oxygenation of deep oceanic layers. Despite these important climatic and life-supporting roles, possible changes in the mixed layer during an era of global climate change remain uncertain. Here we use oceanographic observations to show that from 1970 to 2018 the density contrast across the base of the mixed layer increased and that the mixed layer itself became deeper. Using a physically based definition of upper-ocean stability that follows different dynamical regimes across the global ocean, we find that the summertime density contrast increased by 8.9 ± 2.7 per cent per decade (10−5–10−4 per second squared per decade, depending on region), more than six times greater than previous estimates. Whereas prior work has suggested that a thinner mixed layer should accompany a more stratified upper ocean5–7, we find instead that the summertime mixed layer deepened by 2.9 ± 0.5 per cent per decade, or several metres per decade (typically 5–10 metres per decade, depending on region). A detailed mechanistic interpretation is challenging, but the concurrent stratification and deepening of the mixed layer are related to an increase in stability associated with surface warming and high-latitude surface freshening8,9, accompanied by a wind-driven intensification of upper-ocean turbulence10,11. Our findings are based on a complex dataset with incomplete coverage of a vast area. Although our results are robust within a wide range of sensitivity analyses, important uncertainties remain, such as those related to sparse coverage in the early years of the 1970–2018 period. Nonetheless, our work calls for reconsideration of the drivers of ongoing shifts in marine primary production, and reveals stark changes in the world’s upper ocean over the past five decades. Oceanographic observations from 1970–2018 reveal substantial changes in the summer upper-ocean structure, showing a thickening of the mixed layer and a density gradient increase at its base."
https://openalex.org/W3137152050,"Estimates of health care costs associated with excess weight are needed to inform the development of cost-effective obesity prevention efforts. However, commonly used cost estimates are not sensitive to changes in weight across the entire body mass index (BMI) distribution as they are often based on discrete BMI categories.We estimated continuous BMI-related health care expenditures using data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) 2011-2016 for 175,726 respondents. We adjusted BMI for self-report bias using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011-2016, and controlled for potential confounding between BMI and medical expenditures using a two-part model. Costs are reported in $US 2019.We found a J-shaped curve of medical expenditures by BMI, with higher costs for females and the lowest expenditures occurring at a BMI of 20.5 for adult females and 23.5 for adult males. Over 30 units of BMI, each one-unit BMI increase was associated with an additional cost of $253 (95% CI $167-$347) per person. Among adults, obesity was associated with $1,861 (95% CI $1,656-$2,053) excess annual medical costs per person, accounting for $172.74 billion (95% CI $153.70-$190.61) of annual expenditures. Severe obesity was associated with excess costs of $3,097 (95% CI $2,777-$3,413) per adult. Among children, obesity was associated with $116 (95% CI $14-$201) excess costs per person and $1.32 billion (95% CI $0.16-$2.29) of medical spending, with severe obesity associated with $310 (95% CI $124-$474) excess costs per child.Higher health care costs are associated with excess body weight across a broad range of ages and BMI levels, and are especially high for people with severe obesity. These findings highlight the importance of promoting a healthy weight for the entire population while also targeting efforts to prevent extreme weight gain over the life course."
https://openalex.org/W3082415818,"Delivering on the revolutionary promise of a universal quantum computer will require processors with millions of quantum bits (qubits)1-3. In superconducting quantum processors4, each qubit is individually addressed with microwave signal lines that connect room-temperature electronics to the cryogenic environment of the quantum circuit. The complexity and heat load associated with the multiple coaxial lines per qubit limits the maximum possible size of a processor to a few thousand qubits5. Here we introduce a photonic link using an optical fibre to guide modulated laser light from room temperature to a cryogenic photodetector6, capable of delivering shot-noise-limited microwave signals directly at millikelvin temperatures. By demonstrating high-fidelity control and readout of a superconducting qubit, we show that this photonic link can meet the stringent requirements of superconducting quantum information processing7. Leveraging the low thermal conductivity and large intrinsic bandwidth of optical fibre enables the efficient and massively multiplexed delivery of coherent microwave control pulses, providing a path towards a million-qubit universal quantum computer."
https://openalex.org/W3137895553,"<h2>Summary</h2> The central pathogen-immune interface in tuberculosis is the granuloma, a complex host immune structure that dictates infection trajectory and physiology. Granuloma macrophages undergo a dramatic transition in which entire epithelial modules are induced and define granuloma architecture. In tuberculosis, relatively little is known about the host signals that trigger this transition. Using the zebrafish-<i>Mycobacterium marinum</i> model, we identify the basis of granuloma macrophage transformation. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis of zebrafish granulomas and analysis of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis-</i>infected macaques reveal that, even in the presence of robust type 1 immune responses, countervailing type 2 signals associate with macrophage epithelialization. We find that type 2 immune signaling, mediated via <i>stat6</i>, is absolutely required for epithelialization and granuloma formation. In mixed chimeras, <i>stat6</i> acts cell autonomously within macrophages, where it is required for epithelioid transformation and incorporation into necrotic granulomas. These findings establish the signaling pathway that produces the hallmark structure of mycobacterial infection."
https://openalex.org/W3136797206,"Mutations in the X-linked gene MECP2 cause Rett syndrome, a progressive neurological disorder in which children develop normally for the first one or two years of life before experiencing profound motor and cognitive decline1–3. At present there are no effective treatments for Rett syndrome, but we hypothesized that using the period of normal development to strengthen motor and memory skills might confer some benefit. Here we find, using a mouse model of Rett syndrome, that intensive training beginning in the presymptomatic period dramatically improves the performance of specific motor and memory tasks, and significantly delays the onset of symptoms. These benefits are not observed when the training begins after symptom onset. Markers of neuronal activity and chemogenetic manipulation reveal that task-specific neurons that are repeatedly activated during training develop more dendritic arbors and have better neurophysiological responses than those in untrained animals, thereby enhancing their functionality and delaying symptom onset. These results provide a rationale for genetic screening of newborns for Rett syndrome, as presymptomatic intervention might mitigate symptoms or delay their onset. Similar strategies should be studied for other childhood neurological disorders. In a mouse model of Rett syndrome, intensive training during the presymptomatic period markedly improves the performance of motor and memory tasks and delays the onset of symptoms, providing a rationale for the genetic screening of newborn babies."
https://openalex.org/W3136151743,"One of the most notable ecological trends-described more than 2,300 years ago by Theophrastus-is the association of small leaves with dry and cold climates, which has recently been recognized for eudicotyledonous plants at a global scale1-3. For eudicotyledons, this pattern has been attributed to the fact that small leaves have a thinner boundary layer that helps to avoid extreme leaf temperatures4 and their leaf development results in vein traits that improve water transport under cold or dry climates5,6. However, the global distribution of leaf size and its adaptive basis have not been tested in the grasses, which represent a diverse lineage that is distinct in leaf morphology and that contributes 33% of terrestrial primary productivity (including the bulk of crop production)7. Here we demonstrate that grasses have shorter and narrower leaves under colder and drier climates worldwide. We show that small grass leaves have thermal advantages and vein development that contrast with those of eudicotyledons, but that also explain the abundance of small leaves in cold and dry climates. The worldwide distribution of leaf size in grasses exemplifies how biophysical and developmental processes result in convergence across major lineages in adaptation to climate globally, and highlights the importance of leaf size and venation architecture for grass performance in past, present and future ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W3138372539,"Systemic insulin sensitivity shows a diurnal rhythm with a peak upon waking1,2. The molecular mechanism that underlies this temporal pattern is unclear. Here we show that the nuclear receptors REV-ERB-α and REV-ERB-β (referred to here as 'REV-ERB') in the GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric acid-producing) neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) (SCNGABA neurons) control the diurnal rhythm of insulin-mediated suppression of hepatic glucose production in mice, without affecting diurnal eating or locomotor behaviours during regular light-dark cycles. REV-ERB regulates the rhythmic expression of genes that are involved in neurotransmission in the SCN, and modulates the oscillatory firing activity of SCNGABA neurons. Chemogenetic stimulation of SCNGABA neurons at waking leads to glucose intolerance, whereas restoration of the temporal pattern of either SCNGABA neuron firing or REV-ERB expression rescues the time-dependent glucose metabolic phenotype caused by REV-ERB depletion. In individuals with diabetes, an increased level of blood glucose after waking is a defining feature of the 'extended dawn phenomenon'3,4. Patients with type 2 diabetes with the extended dawn phenomenon exhibit a differential temporal pattern of expression of REV-ERB genes compared to patients with type 2 diabetes who do not have the extended dawn phenomenon. These findings provide mechanistic insights into how the central circadian clock regulates the diurnal rhythm of hepatic insulin sensitivity, with implications for our understanding of the extended dawn phenomenon in type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W3139222201,"One of the biggest challenges during the pandemic has been obtaining and maintaining critical material to conduct the increasing demand for molecular tests. Sometimes, the lack of suppliers and the global shortage of these reagents, a consequence of the high demand, make it difficult to detect and diagnose patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, negatively impacting the control of virus spread. Many alternatives have enabled the continuous processing of samples and have presented a decrease in time and cost. These measures thus allow broad testing of the population and should be ideal for controlling the disease. In this sense, we compared the SARS-CoV-2 molecular detection effectiveness by Real time RT-PCR using two different protocols for RNA extraction. The experiments were conducted in the National Institute of Health (INS) from Peru. We compared Ct values average (experimental triplicate) results from two different targets, a viral and internal control. All samples were extracted in parallel using a commercial kit and our alternative protocol–samples submitted to proteinase K treatment (3 μg/μL, 56°C for 10 minutes) followed by thermal shock (98°C for 5 minutes followed by 4°C for 2 minutes); the agreement between results was 100% in the samples tested. In addition, we compared the COVID-19 positivity between six epidemiological weeks: the initial two in that the Real time RT-PCR reactions were conducted using RNA extracted by commercial kit, followed by two other using RNA obtained by our kit-free method, and the last two using kit once again; they did not differ significantly. We concluded that our in-house method is an easy, fast, and cost-effective alternative method for extracting RNA and conducing molecular diagnosis of COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3138591607,"Background The world is grappling with an ever-changing COVID-19 pandemic using preventive measures such as personal hygiene, face masks, restrictions on travel and gatherings in communities, in addition to a race to find a vaccine. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the knowledge, attitudes and practices of the western Uganda community on the proper use of face masks to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Methods A cross-sectional study using a structured questionnaire was carried out from 1 st July to 10 th July 2020 among western Ugandans of consent age of 18 years and above. Data was analysed using Stata version 14.2. Results Among the respondents (n = 1114), the mean age was 30.7 (SD 11.1), 51% were males, 53.9% married and 43% had attained secondary education. Most participants (60.1%, n = 670) had satisfactory knowledge on the use of face masks and participants at a tertiary education level [AOR 2.6 (95% CI: 1.42–4.67; p = 0.002)] were likely to have satisfactory knowledge than participants who had not education. On attitude, most respondents (69.4%) were confident enough to correctly put on a face mask; 83.4% believed that a face mask can protect against COVID-19 and 75.9% of respondents had never shared their face mask. The majority of respondents (95.2%) agreed wearing face masks in public places was important to protect themselves against COVID-19; 60.3% reported washing their hands before wearing and after removing the face mask. Unfortunately, 51.5% reported removing the face mask if they needed to talk to someone. Conclusion Despite the satisfactory knowledge, good attitude and practices, there is still much more to be done in terms of knowledge, attitude and practices among participants. Government, non-governmental organizations and civil society should improve sensitization of populations on how to behave with face masks while talking to avoid the spread of the COVID-19 among western Ugandans."

Here, we report ten pre-Hispanic (plus two early colonial) genomes and 84 genome-wide profiles from seven groups presently living in Panama. Our analyses reveal that pre-Hispanic demographic events contributed to the extensive genetic structure currently seen in the area, which is also characterized by a distinctive Isthmo-Colombian Indigenous component. This component drives these populations on a specific variability axis and derives from the local admixture of different ancestries of northern North American origin(s). Two of these ancestries were differentially associated to Pleistocene Indigenous groups that also moved into South America, leaving heterogenous genetic footprints. An additional Pleistocene ancestry was brought by a still unsampled population of the Isthmus (UPopI) that remained restricted to the Isthmian area, expanded locally during the early Holocene, and left genomic traces up to the present day."
https://openalex.org/W3144176184,"Abstract One of the biggest challenges in experimental quantum information is to sustain the fragile superposition state of a qubit 1 . Long lifetimes can be achieved for material qubit carriers as memories 2 , at least in principle, but not for propagating photons that are rapidly lost by absorption, diffraction or scattering 3 . The loss problem can be mitigated with a nondestructive photonic qubit detector that heralds the photon without destroying the encoded qubit. Such a detector is envisioned to facilitate protocols in which distributed tasks depend on the successful dissemination of photonic qubits 4,5 , improve loss-sensitive qubit measurements 6,7 and enable certain quantum key distribution attacks 8 . Here we demonstrate such a detector based on a single atom in two crossed fibre-based optical resonators, one for qubit-insensitive atom–photon coupling and the other for atomic-state detection 9 . We achieve a nondestructive detection efficiency upon qubit survival of 79 ± 3 per cent and a photon survival probability of 31 ± 1 per cent, and we preserve the qubit information with a fidelity of 96.2 ± 0.3 per cent. To illustrate the potential of our detector, we show that it can, with the current parameters, improve the rate and fidelity of long-distance entanglement and quantum state distribution compared to previous methods, provide resource optimization via qubit amplification and enable detection-loophole-free Bell tests."
https://openalex.org/W3138665297,"A fundamental challenge complicates news decisions about covering vaccine side effects: although serious vaccine side effects are rare, less severe ones do occur occasionally. The study was designed to test whether a side effect message could induce vaccine hesitancy and whether that could be countered by pro-vaccine messages about vaccine safety. A large ( N = 2,345), nationally representative experiment was conducted by randomly exposing participants to one of six videos about the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine edited from news programs produced during the 2019 measles outbreak in the United States. The design was a 2x3 factorial crossing the presence or absence of a hesitancy-inducing narrative message with a pro-vaccine science-supporting message (i.e., no message, science-supporting expert message, or pro-vaccine narrative message), leading to a total of six conditions. A general linear model was used to assess the effects of these videos on respondents’ (1) vaccine risk perceptions, (2) policy views on vaccination, (3) willingness to encourage others to vaccinate their children, and (4) intention to send a pro-vaccine letter to their state representative. Findings indicated that the science-supporting expert message about vaccine safety led to higher pro-vaccine evaluations relative to other conditions [e.g., b = -0.17, p &lt; .001, a reduction in vaccine risk perceptions of 0.17 as compared to the control]. There was also suggestive evidence that the hesitancy-inducing narrative may limit the effectiveness of a science-supporting expert message, although this finding was not consistent across different outcomes. When shown alone the hesitancy-inducing narrative did not shift views and intentions, but more research is needed to ascertain whether exposure to such messages can undercut the pro-vaccine influence of science-supporting (expert) ones. All in all, however, it is clear that science-supporting messages are effective and therefore worthwhile in combating vaccine misinformation."
https://openalex.org/W3137136398,"Virtual reality (VR) can create safe, cost-effective, and engaging learning environments. It is commonly assumed that improvements in simulation fidelity lead to better learning outcomes. Some aspects of real environments, for example vestibular or haptic cues, are difficult to recreate in VR, but VR offers a wealth of opportunities to provide additional sensory cues in arbitrary modalities that provide task relevant information. The aim of this study was to investigate whether these cues improve user experience and learning outcomes, and, specifically, whether learning using augmented sensory cues translates into performance improvements in real environments. Participants were randomly allocated into three matched groups: Group 1 (control) was asked to perform a real tyre change only. The remaining two groups were trained in VR before performance was evaluated on the same, real tyre change task. Group 2 was trained using a conventional VR system, while Group 3 was trained in VR with augmented, task relevant, multisensory cues. Objective performance, time to completion and error number, subjective ratings of presence, perceived workload, and discomfort were recorded. The results show that both VR training paradigms improved performance for the real task. Providing additional, task-relevant cues during VR training resulted in higher objective performance during the real task. We propose a novel method to quantify the relative performance gains between training paradigms that estimates the relative gain in terms of training time. Systematic differences in subjective ratings that show comparable workload ratings, higher presence ratings and lower discomfort ratings, mirroring objective performance measures, were also observed. These findings further support the use of augmented multisensory cues in VR environments as an efficient method to enhance performance, user experience and, critically, the transfer of training from virtual to real environment scenarios."

The present study aimed to provide an update and insightful information regarding prevalence of the common Transfusion-Transmitted Infections (TTIs) and associated factors among blood donors in Tanzania. Methods This was a cross-sectional study involving retrospectively collected data of blood donors from the Tanzania Northern Zone Blood Transfusion Center between 2017 and 2019. Descriptive statistics were performed to describe characteristics of the blood donors. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to determine association between prevalence of TTIs and socio-demographic factors. P-value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results A total of 101, 616 blood donors were included in the present study of which 85,053(83.7%) were males while 16,563 (16.3%) were females. Of all participants, the majority 45,400 (44.7%) were aged between 18 and 25 years; 79,582 (78.3%) were voluntary non-remunerated donors while 22,034 (21.7%) were replacement donors. The vast majority of them 99,626 (98%) were first time blood donors while 1990 (2%) were multiple donors. The overall prevalence of TTIs was 10.1% (10,226 out of 101,616) of which the leading was HBV accounting for 5.1% (5,264 out of 101,616). Being a replacement donor was associated with all the four types of TTIs: HIV (AOR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.10–1.35), HBV (AOR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.27–1.44), HCV (AOR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.12–1.46), and syphilis (AOR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.20–1.48). Conclusions Our study has demonstrated that Tanzania has relatively high prevalence of TTIs compared to some countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. HBV infection seems to be the most common infection among blood donors and replacement blood donors are at a higher risk of harboring the commonest TTIs among blood donors."

However, the magnitude of the problem and the associated factors remain unrevealed in the Amhara region. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of HPV infection and factors contributing to the progression of HPV infection to cervical cancer.Facility-based cross-sectional study design was employed among women aged 21 to 49 years of age who came for routine cervical cancer screening to 4 randomly selected hospitals (2 general and 2 referral) of Amhara region from May to October, 2019. The sample size was calculated by using the single population proportion formula, proportionated to hospitals, and women were recruited consecutively. Socio demographic and clinical data were collected using a pretested questionnaire and detection of HPV infection was done using HPV test (OncoE6TM Cervical Test) specific to HPV16/18 in cervical swabs. Visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) was used to determine cervical lesions (precancerous and cancerous). Descriptive statistics and bivariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to describe HR-HPV and cervical lesions burden and association between HR-HPV, and cervical lesions and potential risk factors.Among 337 women 21 to 49 years (median age of 35 years ±SD = 7.1 years) of age enrolled in the study, The overall prevalence of oncogenic HPVs (HPV16/18) and the VIA-positivity rate, possible an indicative of cervical lesions, were 7.1% and 13.1%, respectively. Logistic regression analysis showed a significant association between early age of first sexual intercourse (COR = 2.26; 95% CI: 1.0-5.05) and level of education (COR = 0.31; 95% CI: 0.12-0.78) with cervical lesions. Higher odds of HPV positivity (COR = 1.56; 95% CI: 0.59-4.11, p = 0.36) and VIA positivity (COR = 1.39; 95% CI: 0.64-3.00, p = 0.39) were observed among participants who had a history of sexually transmitted illnesses (STIs).There was a relatively low prevalence of oncogenic HPV 16/18 and VIA-positivity in women attending four hospitals in the Amhara Region. Early age sexual contact, high parity, and being uneducated/low level of education were independently associated factors with HR-HPV infection and development of cervical lesions, highlighting the importance of prioritizing the limited HPV testing to those risk groups."

There are limited data on the prevalence and correlate of STI in Ethiopia, yet pregnant women are not screened for curable STI. Hence in this study, the prevalence of STIs and associated risk factors were assessed.A cross- sectional study was conducted on consecutive women attending the delivery ward at the Hawassa comprehensive and specialized hospital. Vaginal swabs collected at the time of labor and delivery were tested for C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae and T. vaginalis using GeneXpert. Study participants responded to a questionnaire about their previous and current obstetric history and socio-demographic characteristics. Possible independent factors for curable STIs were assessed by chi-square, bivariable, and multivariable, logistic regression.Of the 350 vaginal swabs tested, 51 (14.6%, 95% CI: 10.9-18.3) were positive for one or more curable STIs. The prevalence of C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae and T. vaginalis were 8.3%, 4.3%, and 3.1%, respectively. STIs was associated (p<0.005) with the delivery outcomes birth weight and gestational age. A 3-fold increase in odds of acquisition STIs was found in currently unmarried women (AOR, 3.5; 95% CI: 1.1-10.4; p = 0.028), in women <25 years (AOR, 2.7; 95% CI 1.1-6.6; p = 0.031). Women reporting presence of vaginal discharge (AOR, 7.7; 95% CI: 3.2-18.6; p < 0.001) and reporting pain during urination (AOR, 6.5; 95% CI: 2.6-16.2; p <0.001) found to associate with curable STIs.The higher magnitude of STIs found in this population, and the absence of symptoms in many illustrate the need for systematic follow-up during routine antenatal care primarily history taking and asking for signs and symptoms to provide early management and avoid long term sequelae."
https://openalex.org/W3138729024,"Whole genome sequencing (WGS) provides essential public health information and is used worldwide for pathogen surveillance, epidemiology, and source tracking. Foodborne pathogens are often sequenced using rapid library preparation chemistries based on transposon technology; however, this method may miss random segments of genomes that can be important for accurate downstream analyses. As new technologies become available, it may become possible to achieve better overall coverage. Here we compare the sequence quality obtained using libraries prepared from the Nextera XT and Nextera DNA Prep (Illumina, San Diego, CA) chemistries for 31 Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) O121:H19 strains, which had been isolated from flour during a 2016 outbreak. The Nextera DNA Prep gave superior performance metrics including sequence quality, assembly quality, uniformity of genome coverage, and virulence gene identification, among other metrics. Comprehensive detection of virulence genes is essential for making educated assessments of STECs virulence potential. The phylogenetic SNP analysis did not show any differences in the variants detected by either library preparation method which allows isolates prepared from either library method to be analysed together. Our comprehensive comparison of these chemistries should assist researchers wishing to improve their sequencing workflow for STECs and other genomic risk assessments."

Therefore, the scope of ID in this population is unknown.To determine the prevalence of anemia and ID across pregnancy in the Central Region of Ghana.Women were recruited during their 1st trimester of pregnancy (< 13 weeks; n = 116) and followed through to their 2nd (n = 71) and 3rd (n = 71) trimesters. Data on socio-demographic variables, weekly intake of iron-rich foods and vitamin C-rich fruits were collected. Blood samples were drawn and the concentrations of hemoglobin (Hb), ferritin (Ft), serum iron (sFe), total iron binding capacity (TIBC), were measured; transferrin saturation (TSAT) was calculated. Repeated measures ANOVA was used to determine change in anemia and iron variables over time with groups categorized by 1st trimester iron status.Participants were 27.1 ± 5.2 years, on average. Prevalence of anemia (Hb <11.0 g/dL) was 37%, 63%, 58%; ID (Ft <15 μg/L) was 16%, 20%, 38%; and iron deficiency anemia (IDA; based on low Ft and Hb) was 6%, 12%, 25% in 1st, 2nd and 3rd trimesters, respectively. Significant changes in Hb, Ft and TIBC occurred across time. Iron status at 1st trimester had a significant effect on 2nd but not 3rd trimester iron status.ID is prevalent in pregnant Ghanaian women, especially during the 3rd trimester. Anemia is a major public health problem during pregnancy in Ghana with a significant proportion due to factors other than ID."
https://openalex.org/W3136242631,"Background Radiologic evidence of air trapping (AT) on expiratory computed tomography (CT) scans is associated with early pulmonary dysfunction in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). However, standard techniques for quantitative assessment of AT are highly variable, resulting in limited efficacy for monitoring disease progression. Objective To investigate the effectiveness of a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for quantifying and monitoring AT, and to compare it with other quantitative AT measures obtained from threshold-based techniques. Materials and methods Paired volumetric whole lung inspiratory and expiratory CT scans were obtained at four time points (0, 3, 12 and 24 months) on 36 subjects with mild CF lung disease. A densely connected CNN (DN) was trained using AT segmentation maps generated from a personalized threshold-based method (PTM). Quantitative AT (QAT) values, presented as the relative volume of AT over the lungs, from the DN approach were compared to QAT values from the PTM method. Radiographic assessment, spirometric measures, and clinical scores were correlated to the DN QAT values using a linear mixed effects model. Results QAT values from the DN were found to increase from 8.65% ± 1.38% to 21.38% ± 1.82%, respectively, over a two-year period. Comparison of CNN model results to intensity-based measures demonstrated a systematic drop in the Dice coefficient over time (decreased from 0.86 ± 0.03 to 0.45 ± 0.04). The trends observed in DN QAT values were consistent with clinical scores for AT, bronchiectasis, and mucus plugging. In addition, the DN approach was found to be less susceptible to variations in expiratory deflation levels than the threshold-based approach. Conclusion The CNN model effectively delineated AT on expiratory CT scans, which provides an automated and objective approach for assessing and monitoring AT in CF patients."

Moolchand, Ashram, Sabz Burj, and Lodhi road. The monitoring has been performed during the day and night's peak traffic hours using Sound Level Meter (SLM) Larson & Davis 831as per standard procedure. Then after, 2-D and 3-D noise maps have been prepared, visualized, and analyzed by soundPLAN (acoustic) and MapInfo Pro (Desktop GIS). The maximum noise level is observed at Ashram Chowk [81.1 dB (A)] at 8 pm; however, the minimum noise level is found to be at Lala Lajpat Rai Road [76.4dB (A)] at 7 pm. Monitoring results of noise level show non-compliance of regulatory standards for day time and night time. 2-D noise maps revealed that the noise level is maximum at the centerline of the road and decreases either side with the distance, and remains above the permissible limits at all locations. However, the 3-D noise maps show horizontal as well as vertical noise levels at all locations. The 3-D noise maps also revealed a noise level of 70 dB (A) up to a height of 6.096m at the Ashram Chowk and Moolchand intersection. However, a noise level of 65 dB (A) has been observed at the height of 5.486m at Lala Lajpat Rai Marg and Sabz Burj. This study will explore noise levels in both horizontal and vertical directions near roads surrounded by high-rise buildings. It will help the decision-makers take remedial measures."
https://openalex.org/W3139086264,"Due to ever increasing precision and automation demands in robotic grinding, the automatic and robust robotic grinding workstation has become a research hot-spot. This work proposes a grinding workstation constituting of machine vision and an industrial manipulator to solve the difficulty of positioning rough metal cast objects and automatic grinding. Faced with the complex characteristics of industrial environment, such as weak contrast, light nonuniformity and scarcity, a coarse-to-fine two-step localization strategy was used for obtaining the object position. The deep neural network and template matching method were employed for determining the object position precisely in the presence of ambient light. Subsequently, edge extraction and contour fitting techniques were used to measure the position of the contour of the object and to locate the main burr on its surface after eliminating the influence of burr. The grid method was employed for detecting the main burrs, and the offline grinding trajectory of the industrial manipulator was planned with the guidance of the coordinate transformation method. The system greatly improves the automaticity through the entire process of loading, grinding and unloading. It can determine the object position and target the robotic grinding trajectory by the shape of the burr on the surface of an object. The measurements indicate that this system can work stably and efficiently, and the experimental results demonstrate the high accuracy and high efficiency of the proposed method. Meanwhile, it could well overcome the influence of the materials of grinding work pieces, scratch and rust."
https://openalex.org/W3139152563,"Betweenness Centrality (BC) has proven to be a fundamental metric in many domains to identify the components (nodes) of a system modelled as a graph that are mostly traversed by information flows thus being critical to the proper functioning of the system itself. In the transportation domain, the metric has been mainly adopted to discover topological bottlenecks of the physical infrastructure composed of roads or railways. The adoption of this metric to study the evolution of transportation networks that take into account also the dynamic conditions of traffic is in its infancy mainly due to the high computation time needed to compute BC in large dynamic graphs. This paper explores the adoption of dynamic BC, i.e., BC computed on dynamic large-scale graphs, modeling road networks and the related vehicular traffic, and proposes the adoption of a fast algorithm for ahead monitoring of transportation networks by computing approximated BC values under time constraints. The experimental analysis proves that, with a bounded and tolerable approximation, the algorithm computes BC on very large dynamically weighted graphs in a significantly shorter time if compared with exact computation. Moreover, since the proposed algorithm can be tuned for an ideal trade-off between performance and accuracy, our solution paves the way to quasi real-time monitoring of highly dynamic networks providing anticipated information about possible congested or vulnerable areas. Such knowledge can be exploited by travel assistance services or intelligent traffic control systems to perform informed re-routing and therefore enhance network resilience in smart cities."
https://openalex.org/W3134715432,"The potential for adolescent mental health problems arising from heavy internet use is significant. There is a need to better understand the risk and protective factors related to problematic internet use (PIU) amongst adolescents. This study examined the role of adolescents’ perceptions of school-based relationships as potential contextual antecedents to problematic internet use. Specifically, 6552 adolescent students (55.9% boys, 13.51 ± 2. 93 years) from 22 primary and middle schools in southern China completed questionnaires to measure the degree of adolescent conflict with peers, teachers and other staff, school connectedness, perceived classroom atmosphere and problematic internet use. Self-reported data was collected using a two-level stratified sampling. Multiple regression analyses showed that conflict with peers and teachers was positively associated with higher levels of PIU, while school connectedness and perceived classroom atmosphere were negatively associated with PIU. An interaction effect was found for conflict with peers and grade level, such that the association between conflict with peers and PIU was stronger for secondary students compared to primary school students. The results support the need for school-based interventions for PIU to include a focus on conflict with peers and teachers, and for a focus on the enhancement of school connectedness and classroom atmosphere."
https://openalex.org/W3137032451,"Achromatic, mean-modulated flicker—wherein luminance increments and decrements of equal magnitude are applied, over time, to a test field—is commonly used in both clinical assessment of vision and experimental studies of visual systems. However, presenting flicker on computer-controlled displays is problematic; displays typically introduce luminance artifacts at high flicker frequency or contrast, potentially interfering with the validity of findings. Here, we present a battery of tests used to weigh the relative merits of two displays for presenting achromatic, mean-modulated flicker. These tests revealed marked differences between a new high-performance liquid-crystal display (LCD; EIZO ColorEdge CG247X) and a new consumer-grade LCD (Dell U2415b), despite displays’ vendor-supplied specifications being almost identical. We measured displayed luminance using a spot meter and a linearized photodiode. We derived several measures, including spatial uniformity, the effect of viewing angle, response times, Fourier amplitude spectra, and cycle-averaged luminance. We presented paired luminance pulses to quantify the displays’ nonlinear dynamics. The CG247X showed relatively good spatial uniformity (e.g., at moderate luminance, standard deviation 2.8% versus U2415b’s 5.3%). Fourier transformation of nominally static test patches revealed spectra free of artifacts, with the exception of a frame response. The CG247X’s rise and fall times depended on both the luminance from which, and to which, it responded, as is to be generally expected from LCDs. Despite this nonlinear behaviour, we were able to define a contrast and frequency range wherein the CG247X appeared largely artifact-free; the relationship between nominal luminance and displayed luminance was accurately modelled using a causal, linear time-invariant system. This range included contrasts up to 80%, and flicker frequencies up to 30 Hz. This battery of tests should prove useful to others conducting clinical assessment of vision and experimental studies of visual systems."

After isoform sequence clustering and removal of redundant transcripts, a total of 41,293 transcripts were obtained, and 35,640 of these were annotated in the database of gene products. Structure analysis uncovered 4,307 alternative splicing events, and 3,836 sequences were recognized as lncRNAs. Transcripts with the complete coding region of important detoxification enzymes were further classified. There were 57 transcripts of P450s distributed in CYP2, CYP3, CYP4, and Mito CYP clades, 29 transcripts of ESTs from 4 functional groups, 17 transcripts of GSTs classified into 5 families, 51 transcripts of ABCs distributed in 6 families, and 19 transcripts of UGTs. Twenty-five lncRNAs were predicted to be regulators of these detoxification genes. Full-length transcriptome sequencing is an efficient method for molecular study of P . striolata and it is also useful for gene function analysis."
https://openalex.org/W3138120375,"The annual Melbourne Cup Thoroughbred horse race has iconic status among many Australians but sits in the context of increasing criticism of the welfare of Thoroughbred racing horses and the ethics of gambling. Despite heated debates and protests playing out in the public domain, there is scant empirical research to document Australian attitudes to the Melbourne Cup, or horse racing more generally. Specifically, little is known about how support for or against the Melbourne Cup correlate with age, gender, income and level of education. To provide a more nuanced understanding of attitudes towards the cup beyond the rudimentary binaries of those who are 'for' or 'against' gambling and horse racing, the purpose of the study was to identify clusters of people with particular views. An opportunistic survey collected data on respondents' gender, age, place of residence, weekly income, employment status and highest level of education, and sought their level of agreement with six statements about the Melbourne Cup, gambling and animal cruelty. Ordinal logistic regression and Chi-square analysis were used to evaluate the age and gender of respondents in clusters respectively. Agreement with the statements revealed some significant associations. Male respondents were at greater odds for agreement with the statement: I regularly bet on horse races (OR = 2.39; 95% CI = 1.78-3.22) as were respondents aged 18-19 years (OR = 2.88; 95% CI = 1.13-7.35) and 20-24 years (OR = 1.90; 95% CI 1.00-3.62) compared with the median 35-40 years age bracket. Agreement with the statement: I will watch the Melbourne Cup but will not place a bet was more likely among the full-time employed (OR = 1.60; 95% CI = 1.10-2.32), for those aged 20-24 years (OR = 1.85; 95% CI = 1.16-2.95). The odds of increasing agreement with the statement: I have never been interested in the Melbourne Cup were multiplied by 0.87 (95% CI = 0.82-0.92) with each successive five-year age bracket. The most useful of the predictor variables for agreement was level of education. The odds of increasing with the statement: I have become less interested in the Melbourne Cup over recent years because of my concerns with gambling were multiplied by 1.09 (95% CI = 1.02-1.15) for each increased level of education. Agreement with the statement: I have become less interested in the Melbourne Cup because of my concerns about animal cruelty was weaker amongst male respondents (OR = 0.62; 95% CI = 0.48-0.80), and those in increasing age brackets (OR = 0.88; 95% CI = 0.83-0.93). A series of six clusters were identified that show how certain attributes of respondents characterise their responses. The authors labelled these clusters ""Devotees"" (n = 313; 30.4% of respondents), ""Flaneurs"" (n = 244; 21.8% of respondents), ""Disapprovers"" (n = 163; 15.9% of respondents), ""Casuals"" (n = 148; 14.4% of respondents), ""Gamblers"" (n = 126; 12.3% of respondents) and ""Paradoxical-voters"" (n = 54; 5.3% of respondents).

We investigated the role of miR-212-5p and its downstream target in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation, migration, and contraction. MicroRNA microarray and PCR analyses showed that miR-212-5p expression was increased with angiotensin II treatment in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, miR-212-5p mimic treatment attenuated and miR-212-5p inhibitor treatment increased VSMC proliferation and migration. Additionally, miR-212-5p mimic treatment suppressed VSMC contraction and related gene expression [Ras homolog gene family member A (RhoA) and Rho-associated protein kinase 2], while miR-212-5p inhibitor treatment exerted opposite effects. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase 1B2 (PAFAH1B2) is a target of miR-212-5p. miR-212-5p mimic treatment significantly reduced and miR-212-5p inhibitor treatment increased PAFAH1B2 expression. Furthermore, PAFAH1B2 expression was decreased in angiotensin II-treated aortic tissues and VSMCs. PAFAH1B2 was ubiquitously expressed in most adult rat tissues. In the vasculature, PAFAH1B2 was only distributed in the cytoplasm. PAFAH1B2 overexpression decreased A10 cell proliferation, while PAFAH1B2 knockdown increased A10 cell proliferation and cyclin D1 mRNA levels. PAFAH1B2 knockdown stimulated VSMC contraction and RhoA expression. These results suggest that miR-212-5p and PAFAH1B2 are novel negative regulators of VSMC proliferation, migration, and contraction in hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W3136545962,"Introduction Early Huntington’s disease (HD) patients begin to show planning deficits even before motor alterations start to manifest. Generally, planning ability is associated with the functioning of anterior brain areas such as the medial prefrontal cortex. However, early HD neuropathology involves significant atrophy in the occipital and parietal cortex, suggesting that more posterior regions could also be involved in these planning deficits. Objective To identify brain regions associated with planning deficits in HD patients at an early clinical stage. Materials and methods Twenty-two HD-subjects genetically confirmed with incipient clinical manifestation and twenty healthy subjects were recruited. All participants underwent MRI T1 image acquisition as well as testing in the Stockings of Cambridge (SOC) task to measure planning ability. First, group comparison of SOC measures were performed. Then, correlation voxel-based morphometry analyses were done between gray matter degeneration and SOC performance in the HD group. Results Accuracy and efficiency planning scores correlated with gray matter density in right lingual gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, anterior cingulate gyrus, and paracingulate gyrus. Conclusions Our results suggest that planning deficits exhibited by early HD-subjects are related to occipital and temporal cortical degeneration in addition to the frontal areas deterioration."
https://openalex.org/W3136458842,"We report on developmental vowel dyslexia, a type of dyslexia that selectively affects the reading aloud of vowel letters. We identified this dyslexia in 55 Turkish-readers aged 9–10, and made an in-depth multiple-case analysis of the reading of 17 participants whose vowel dyslexia was relatively selective. These participants made significantly more vowel errors (vowel substitution, omission, migration, and addition) than age-matched controls, and significantly more errors in vowel letters than in consonants. Vowel harmony, a pivotal property of Turkish phonology, was intact and the majority of their vowel errors yielded harmonic responses. The transparent character of Turkish orthography indicates that vowel dyslexia is not related to ambiguity in vowel conversion. The dyslexia did not result from a deficit in the phonological-output stage, as the participants did not make vowel errors in nonword repetition or in repeating words they had read with a vowel error. The locus of the deficit was not in the orthographic-visual-analyzer either, as their same-different decision on words differing in vowels was intact, and so was their written-word comprehension. They made significantly more errors on nonwords than on words, indicating that their deficit was in vowel processing in the sublexical route. Given that their single-vowels conversion was intact, and that they showed an effect of the number of vowels, we conclude that their deficit is in a vowel-specific buffer in the sublexical route. They did not make vowel errors within suffixes, indicating that suffixes are converted as wholes in a separate sublexical sub-route. These results have theoretical implications for the dual-route model: they indicate that the sublexical route converts vowels and consonants separately, that the sublexical route includes a vowel buffer, and a separate morphological conversion route. The results also indicate that types of dyslexia can be detected in transparent languages given detailed error-analysis and dyslexia-relevant stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W3136711709,"Measuring semantic similarity between sentences is a significant task in the fields of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Information Retrieval (IR), and biomedical text mining. For this reason, the proposal of sentence similarity methods for the biomedical domain has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. However, most sentence similarity methods and experimental results reported in the biomedical domain cannot be reproduced for multiple reasons as follows: the copying of previous results without confirmation, the lack of source code and data to replicate both methods and experiments, and the lack of a detailed definition of the experimental setup, among others. As a consequence of this reproducibility gap, the state of the problem can be neither elucidated nor new lines of research be soundly set. On the other hand, there are other significant gaps in the literature on biomedical sentence similarity as follows: (1) the evaluation of several unexplored sentence similarity methods which deserve to be studied; (2) the evaluation of an unexplored benchmark on biomedical sentence similarity, called Corpus-Transcriptional-Regulation (CTR); (3) a study on the impact of the pre-processing stage and Named Entity Recognition (NER) tools on the performance of the sentence similarity methods; and finally, (4) the lack of software and data resources for the reproducibility of methods and experiments in this line of research. Identified these open problems, this registered report introduces a detailed experimental setup, together with a categorization of the literature, to develop the largest, updated, and for the first time, reproducible experimental survey on biomedical sentence similarity. Our aforementioned experimental survey will be based on our own software replication and the evaluation of all methods being studied on the same software platform, which will be specially developed for this work, and it will become the first publicly available software library for biomedical sentence similarity.

https://openalex.org/W3137346234,"Letrozole, an aromatase inhibitor (AI), is the first-line adjuvant drug for treating hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer in postmenopausal women. However, harmful adverse events (AEs) and significant differences in drug response among individuals remain a significant problem in clinical application. Current evidence suggests that the observed individual variation in the treatment outcomes of AI is conferred by genetic variants. Hence, in this study, we examined the association of TCL1A gene polymorphisms with letrozole-induced AEs. The study subjects were postmenopausal HR+ breast cancer patients who were receiving adjuvant letrozole. Genomic DNA was isolated by a routine standard phenol-chloroform method. In total, 198 South Indian patients were genotyped for four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TCL1A gene loci by the TaqMan allelic discrimination assay using the RT-PCR system. We used the odds ratio and 95% confidence interval to assess the genetic association. Musculoskeletal (MS) AEs and vasomotor symptoms (VMSs) are the most common side effects observed in the study cohort. Among 198 patients, 81 experienced musculoskeletal toxicity, reporting MS-AEs, 57 had VMSs, and 33 of them had both. The most frequently identified polymorphic variants in the patient series were rs11849538 (G) , with an allele frequency of about 27.3%, followed by rs7158782-G (27.3%), rs7159713-G (25.8%), and rs2369049-G (22.5%). The genetic association analysis indicated no significant difference in the proportion of TCL1A gene variants between patients with and without AEs on either MS-AEs or VMSs. Though we observed high LD in all patient groups, the inferred haplotypes displayed a non-significant association with letrozole-induced specific AEs. However, the SNP functionality analysis by RegulomeDB provided a 2b rank score for rs7158782 , suggesting a potential biological function. Our findings suggest that TCL1A gene polymorphisms may not play any role in the prediction of letrozole-induced AEs in South Indian HR+ breast cancer patients."

https://openalex.org/W3138314015,"Burkholderia pseudomallei is a soil-dwelling organism present throughout the tropics. It is the causative agent of melioidosis, a disease that is believed to kill 89,000 people per year. It is naturally resistant to many antibiotics, requiring at least two weeks of intravenous treatment with ceftazidime, imipenem or meropenem followed by 6 months of orally delivered co-trimoxazole. This places a large treatment burden on the predominantly middle-income nations where the majority of disease occurs. We have established a high-throughput assay for compounds that could be used as a co-therapy to potentiate the effect of ceftazidime, using the related non-pathogenic bacterium Burkholderia thailandensis as a surrogate. Optimization of the assay gave a Z' factor of 0.68. We screened a library of 61,250 compounds and identified 29 compounds with a pIC50 (-log10(IC50)) greater than five. Detailed investigation allowed us to down select to six ""best in class"" compounds, which included the licensed drug chloroxine. Co-treatment of B. thailandensis with ceftazidime and chloroxine reduced culturable cell numbers by two orders of magnitude over 48 hours, compared to treatment with ceftazidime alone. Hit expansion around chloroxine was performed using commercially available compounds. Minor modifications to the structure abolished activity, suggesting that chloroxine likely acts against a specific target. Finally, an initial study demonstrates the utility of chloroxine to act as a co-therapy to potentiate the effect of ceftazidime against B. pseudomallei. This approach successfully identified potential co-therapies for a recalcitrant Gram-negative bacterial species. Our assay could be used more widely to aid in chemotherapy to treat infections caused by these bacteria."

Methods We implemented a rapid quality improvement project to improve ANC retention at seven health facilities in Eswatini (October-December 2017). All pregnant women attending ANC visits were eligible to participate in anonymous tablet-based audio assisted computer self-interview (ACASI) surveys. The 24-question survey asked about women’s interactions with health facility staff (HFS) (nurses, mentor mothers, receptionists and lab workers) with a three-level symbolic response options (agree/happy, neutral, disagree/sad). Women were asked to self-report HIV status. Survey results were shared with HFS at monthly quality improvement sessions. Chi-square tests were used to assess differences in responses between months one and three, and between HIV-positive and negative women. Routine medical record data were used to compare retention among pregnant women newly enrolled in ANC two periods, January-February 2017 (‘pre-period’) and January-February 2018 (‘post-period’) at two of the participating health facilities. Proportions of women retained at 3 and 6 months were compared using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel and Wilcoxon tests. Results A total of 1,483 surveys were completed by pregnant women attending ANC, of whom 508 (34.3%) self-reported to be HIV-positive. The only significant change in responses from month one to three was whether nurses listened with agreement increasing from 88.3% to 94.8% (p&lt;0.01). Overall, WLHIV had significantly higher proportions of reported satisfaction with HFS interactions compared to HIV-negative women. A total of 680 pregnant women were included in the retention analysis; 454 (66.8%) HIV-negative and 226 (33.2%) WLHIV. In the pre- and post-periods, 59.4% and 64.6%, respectively, attended at least four ANC visits (p = 0.16). The proportion of women retained at six months increased from 60.9% in the pre-period to 72.7% in the post-period (p = 0.03). For HIV-negative women, pre- and post-period six-month retention significantly increased from 56.6% to 71.6% (p = 0.02); however, the increase in WLHIV retained at six months from 70.7% (pre-period) to 75.0% (post-period) was not statistically significant (p = 0.64). Conclusion The type of rapid quality improvement intervention we implemented may be useful in improving patient-provider relationships although whether it can improve retention remains unclear."
https://openalex.org/W3136342235,"Social Anxiety Disorder is among the most widely studied psychiatric conditions. However, the role of attentional and emotional processes in the maintenance of the condition is still not well-established. This study addressed the impact of individual differences in Social Anxiety, by examining the effects of perceptual load and stimulus valence when processing faces vs objects, here used as distractors, within a letter-search task. In addition to RT and accuracy on the letter search task, heart rate, and skin conductance during the task and participants’ self-report emotional evaluation were assessed to help interpret performance effects. Results suggest that distractor stimuli that are either threatening or faces impair performance of high SA participants. Results demonstrate a hypervigilance for threatening faces in SA but indicate that this happens primarily when cognitive resources are available, that is, under low perceptual load."
https://openalex.org/W3138871328,"CCR2 is the major chemokine receptor that regulates appropriate trafficking of inflammatory monocytes, but the role of this chemokine receptor and its ligands during primary and secondary infection with intracellular infections remains incompletely understood. Here we used murine infection with the Live Vaccine Strain (LVS) of Francisella tularensis to evaluate the role of CCR2 during primary and secondary parenteral responses to this prototype intracellular bacterium. We find that mice deficient in CCR2 are highly compromised in their ability to survive intradermal infection with LVS, indicating the importance of this receptor during primary parenteral responses. Interestingly, this defect could not be readily attributed to the activities of the known murine CCR2 ligands MCP-1/CCL2, MCP-3/CCL7, or MCP-5/CCL12. Nonetheless, CCR2 knockout mice vaccinated by infection with low doses of LVS generated optimal T cell responses that controlled the intramacrophage replication of Francisella, and LVS-immune CCR2 knockout mice survived maximal lethal Francisella challenge. Thus, fully protective adaptive immune memory responses to this intracellular bacterium can be readily generated in the absence of CCR2."
https://openalex.org/W3136770135,"Smoking prevalence has decreased significantly among US adolescents and young adults in the past 20 years. It is possible that adolescent and young adult smokers were moving from core to peripheral positions in social networks and thus less influential as suggested in previous research on adult smokers. We construct five sample datasets to test these hypotheses but none of them receives much support. When the proportion of smokers is relatively higher in two sample datasets, smokers tended to be at more marginal network positions than nonsmokers, both smokers and nonsmoker could exert peer influence, and the magnitude of peer influence from smokers was even greater than that from nonsmokers. When smoking was less frequent in the other three sample datasets, smokers and nonsmokers were at random network positions and no peer influence on smoking behavior was detected. Therefore, core/periphery network positions are still the key linking smoking prevalence and peer influence among US adolescents and young adults but operating through a different mechanism from their adult counterparts. When scientists design and conduct prevention programs against adolescent and young adult smoking behavior, core/periphery network positions, smoking prevalence, and peer influence should all be taken into consideration."
