Diffusion barriers seal the root, preventing the loss of internal water and nutrients. Salas-González et al. found that microbes living on and in roots of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana influence diffusion barrier formation, which affects the balance of mineral nutrients in the plant (see the Perspective by Busch and Chory). Plants with modified root diffusion barriers show altered bacterial community composition. Microbes tap into the plant's abscisic acid hormone signals to stabilize the root diffusion barrier against perturbations in environmental nutrient availability, thus enhancing plant stress tolerance.

https://openalex.org/W3106395629,"The advent of biocatalysts designed computationally and optimized by laboratory evolution provides an opportunity to explore molecular strategies for augmenting catalytic function. Applying a suite of nuclear magnetic resonance, crystallography, and stopped-flow techniques to an enzyme designed for an elementary proton transfer reaction, we show how directed evolution gradually altered the conformational ensemble of the protein scaffold to populate a narrow, highly active conformational ensemble and accelerate this transformation by nearly nine orders of magnitude. Mutations acquired during optimization enabled global conformational changes, including high-energy backbone rearrangements, that cooperatively organized the catalytic base and oxyanion stabilizer, thus perfecting transition-state stabilization. The development of protein catalysts for many chemical transformations could be facilitated by explicitly sampling conformational substates during design and specifically stabilizing productive substates over all unproductive conformations."

Outside of Africa, this flavivirus is transmitted by a ubiquitous mosquito subspecies, Aedes aegypti aegypti , which emerged from the African forerunner subspecies A. aegypti formosus and acquired a preference for human blood and a peridomestic lifestyle. Now, this subspecies colonizes many intertropical cities, aided by climate change and human trash. Aubry et al. tested 14 laboratory mosquito colonies for their relative susceptibility to ZIKV. Quantitative trait locus mapping showed differences on chromosome 2 between mosquitoes from Gabon and Guadeloupe. Mouse infection experiments revealed that African mosquitoes transmitted a smaller virus inoculum than the South American insects. Increased susceptibility coupled with the ability of A. aegypti aegypti to breed in any discarded object containing water has amplified the problematic nature of this virus as it has circumnavigated the world.

https://openalex.org/W3098402108,"Neutralizing antibodies elicited by HIV-1 coevolve with viral envelope proteins (Env) in distinctive patterns, in some cases acquiring substantial breadth. We report that primary HIV-1 envelope proteins-when expressed by simian-human immunodeficiency viruses in rhesus macaques-elicited patterns of Env-antibody coevolution very similar to those in humans, including conserved immunogenetic, structural, and chemical solutions to epitope recognition and precise Env-amino acid substitutions, insertions, and deletions leading to virus persistence. The structure of one rhesus antibody, capable of neutralizing 49% of a 208-strain panel, revealed a V2 apex mode of recognition like that of human broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) PGT145 and PCT64-35S. Another rhesus antibody bound the CD4 binding site by CD4 mimicry, mirroring human bNAbs 8ANC131, CH235, and VRC01. Virus-antibody coevolution in macaques can thus recapitulate developmental features of human bNAbs, thereby guiding HIV-1 immunogen design."
https://openalex.org/W3099564404,"Cells and the path of least resistance For processes encompassing proper embryonic development, adult homeostasis, tumor cell dissemination, and immunity, certain cells must translocate from their site of origin. Migrating cells navigate physical features of their microenvironment; however, the in vivo importance of tissue topography for pathfinding is mostly unknown. Studying fruit flies, Dai et al. used border cells within the ovarian egg chamber to study path selection. Live imaging, genetics, mathematical modeling, and simulations showed that tissue microtopography provides an energetically favorable path of least resistance, whereas chemoattractants supply orthogonal guidance information and cell-cell adhesion contributes traction. The results provide insight into how cells integrate and prioritize topographical, adhesive, and chemoattractant cues to choose one path among many. Science , this issue p. 987"
https://openalex.org/W3101010185,"Objective To investigate annual myopia progression in individuals from South Indian states across different age groups, and its association with age of onset and severity of myopia. Methods This retrospective study included the data of 6984 myopes (range: 1–30 years), who visited at least twice to LV Prasad Eye Institute and on whom a standard retinoscopy technique was performed to determine refractive error. Based on spherical equivalent (SE) refractive error, individuals were classified into mild, moderate, high and severe myopic groups. Myopia progression was calculated as difference between SE at 1-year follow-up visit and at baseline. To determine the age-specific myopia progression, individuals were further categorized as myopes who are at least 15 years or younger and those who are above 15. Results The mean annual progression of myopia was influenced by both the age group (p &lt; 0.001) and severity type of myopia (p &lt; 0.001). The overall mean myopia progression ranged from -0.07 ± 0.02 D (standard error) to -0.51 ± 0.02 D across different age groups with maximum change in refractive error noted in children aged 6–10 years and the least in adults aged 26–30 years. Myopia progression was greater in severe myopes, followed by high, moderate, mild myopes and in individuals aged ≤ 15 years compared to those aged &gt;15 years (-0.45 ± 0.01 vs. 0.14 ± 0.01, p &lt; 0.001). Severe myopes alone had similar annual myopia progression rate irrespective of age (i.e ≤15 and &gt;15 years, p = 0.71). Early onset of myopia was associated with high myopia in adulthood. Conclusion The magnitude of myopia progression in children from South Indian states is comparable to that of Caucasians and Chinese. The greater progression in ‘severe myopes’ across different age groups emphasize the need for regular follow-ups, monitoring axial lengths, and anti-myopia strategies to control myopia progression irrespective of the age and degree of myopia."
https://openalex.org/W3099008891,"Palladium(II)-catalyzed carbon-hydrogen (C-H) oxidation reactions could streamline the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and other complex organic molecules. Existing methods, however, commonly exhibit poor catalyst performance with high palladium (Pd) loading (e.g., 10 mole %) and a need for (super)stoichiometric quantities of undesirable oxidants, such as benzoquinone and silver(I) salts. The present study probes the mechanism of a representative Pd-catalyzed oxidative C-H arylation reaction and elucidates mechanistic features that undermine catalyst performance, including substrate-consuming side reactions and sequestration of the catalyst as an inactive species. Systematic tuning of the quinone cocatalyst overcomes these deleterious features. Use of 2,5-di-tert-butyl-p-benzoquinone enables efficient use of molecular oxygen as the oxidant, high reaction yields, and >1900 turnovers by the Pd catalyst."
https://openalex.org/W3103925702,"In this paper, a modified form of the Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller known as the Integral- Proportional Derivative (I-PD) controller is developed for Automatic Generation Control (AGC) of the two-area multi-source Interconnected Power System (IPS). Fitness Dependent Optimizer (FDO) algorithm is employed for the optimization of proposed controller with various performance criteria including Integral of Absolute Error (IAE), Integral of Time multiplied Absolute Error (ITAE), Integral of Time multiplied Square Error (ITSE), and Integral Square Error (ISE). The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been assessed on a two-area network with individual source including gas, hydro and reheat thermal unit and then collectively with all three sources. Further, to validate the efficacy of the proposed FDO based PID and I-PD controllers, comprehensive comparative performance is carried and compared with other controllers including Differential Evolution based PID (DE-PID) controller and Teaching Learning Based Optimization (TLBO) hybridized with Local Unimodal Sampling (LUS-PID) controller. The comparison of outcomes reveal that the proposed FDO based I-PD (FDO-I-PD) controller provides a significant improvement in respect of Overshoot (Osh), Settling time (Ts), and Undershoot (Ush). The robustness of an I-PD controller is also verified by varying parameter of the system and load variation."
https://openalex.org/W3104824749,"Introduction Family carers are cornerstones in the care of older people living with dementia. Family carers report extensive carer burden, reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and extensive time spent on informal care (Time). Health literacy (HL) is a concept associated with people’s ability to access health services, and navigate the healthcare system. This study’s aim was to investigate HL among family carers, and investigate the associations between HL and carer burden, HRQoL, and Time spent on informal care. Method We designed a self-administered survey comprising validated instruments, including the Health Literacy Scale (HLS-N-Q12) to measure HL, Relative Stress Scale (RSS) to measure carer burden, the EQ-5D-5L instrument to measure HRQoL, and some modified questions from the Resource Utilization in Dementia (RUD) questionnaire to measure time spent on informal care (Time). Descriptive analysis in addition to bivariate and multiple linear regressions were undertaken. In multiple linear regression analysis, we used HL as the independent variable to predict the outcomes (carer burden, HRQoL, Time). Analyses were adjusted for the effects of explanatory independent variables: age, gender, education levels, urban residency, having worked as health personnel, caring for someone with severe/mild dementia, and being born abroad. Findings In a non-probability sample of 188 family carers from across Norway, most of them female and over the age of 60, we found high levels of HL. In the bivariate analysis, carer burden and HRQoL (EQvalue) showed significant associations with HL. In the multiple regression analyses, HL was statistically significantly associated with carer burden (B = -0.18 CI:-0.33,-0.02 p = 0.02), HRQoL (EQvalue: B = 0.003 with 95% CI: 0.001, 0.006 p = 0.04), and Time (B = -0.03 with 95% CI: -0.06, 0.000, p = 0.046), after adjusting for the effect of independent variables. Conclusion This is one of the first studies to investigate the associations between HL and different outcomes for family carers of older people living with dementia. Additional research into the associations identified here is needed to further develop our understanding of how to support family carers in their roles. Targeted support that increases family carers’ HL may have potential to enhance their ability to provide sustainable care over time."
https://openalex.org/W3102219281,"Nudibranch molluscs of the family Tritoniidae are widely used neuroscience model systems for understand the behavioural and genetic bases of learning and memory. However species identity and genus-level taxonomic assignment of the tritoniids remain contested. Herein we present a taxonomic review of the family Tritoniidae using integration of molecular phylogenetic analysis, morphological and biogeographical data. For the first time the identity of the model species Tritonia tetraquetra (Pallas, 1788) and Tritonia exsulans Bergh, 1894 is confirmed. T . tetraquetra distributes across the large geographic and bathymetric distances in the North-Eastern (NE) and North-Western (NW) Pacific. In turn, at NE Pacific coasts the separate species T . exsulans is commonly occured. Thus, it reveals a misidentification of T . tetraquetra and T . exsulans species in neuroscience applications. Presence of more hidden lineages within NW Pacific T . tetraquetra is suggested. The long lasting confusion over identity of the species from the genera Tritonia and Tochuina is resolved using molecular and morphological data. We also disprove a common indication about “edible T . tetraquetra ” at the Kuril Islands. It is shown that Tochuina possesses specialized tritoniid features and also some characters of “arminacean nudibranchs”, such as Doridoxa and Heterodoris . Diagnoses for the families Doridoxidae and Heterodorididae are provided. Taxonomy of the genus Doridoxa is clarified and molecular data for the genus Heterodoris presented for the first time. A taxonomic synopsis for the family Tritoniidae is provided. A new genus among tritoniid taxa is proposed. Importance of the ontogeny-based taxonomy is highlighted. The cases when apomorphic characters considerably modified in a crown group due to the paedomorphosis are revealed. Tracing of the character evolution is presented for secondary gills–a key external feature of the family Tritoniidae and traditional dendronotacean nudibranchs."
https://openalex.org/W3102263075,"Introduction Ultrasound-guided internal branch of the upper laryngeal nerve block (USG-guided iSLN block) have been used to decrease the perioperative stress response of intubation. It is more likely to be successful than blindly administered superior laryngeal nerve blocks with fewer complications. Here, we evaluated the efficacy of USG-guided iSLN block to treat postoperative sore throat (postoperative sore throat, POST) after extubation. Methods 100 patients, aged from 18 to 60 years old, ASA I~II who underwent general anesthesia and suffered from the moderate to severe postoperative sore throat after extubation were randomized into two groups(50 cases per group). Patients in group S received USG-guided iSLN block bilaterally (60mg of 2% lidocaine, 1.5ml each side), whereas those in group I received inhalation with 100 mg of 2% lidocaine and 1mg of budesonide suspension diluted with normal saline (oxygen flow 8 L /min, inhalation for 15 minutes). The primary outcome were VAS scores in both groups before treatment (T0), 10 min (T1), 30 min(T2), 1h(T3), 2 h(T4), 4h(T5), 8h(T6), 24h(T7), and 48h(T8) after treatment. The secondary outcome were satisfaction scores after treatment, MAP, HR, and SPO2 fromT0 to T8. The adverse reactions such as postoperative chocking or aspiration, cough, hoarseness, dyspnea were also observed in both groups. Results Patients in group S had significantly lower VAS score than that in group I at points of T 1 ~ T 6 (P &lt; 0.01). HR of group S was lower than that of group I at points of T 1 ~ T 2 and T4 (P &lt; 0.05), and MAP was lower than that of group I at points of T 1 ~ T 3 (P &lt; 0.05). Satisfaction scores of group S were higher than that of group I (P &lt;0.05), In group S, 2 case (4%) needed to intravenous Flurbiprofen Injection 50 mg to relieve pain; in group I, 13 cases (26%) received Flurbiprofen Injection. 2 case of group S appeared throat numbness after treatment for 3 hours; 2 patients have difficult in expectoration after treatment recovered after 3hour. No serious adverse events were observed in both groups. Conclusion Compared with inhalation, USG-guided iSLN block may effectively relieve the postoperative sore throat after extubation under general anesthesia and provided an ideal treatment for POST in clinical work."
https://openalex.org/W3102336775,"Age is an important parameter to better understand wildlife populations, and is especially relevant for interpreting data for fecundity, health, and survival assessments. Estimating ages for marine mammals presents a particular challenge due to the environment they inhabit: accessibility is limited and, when temporarily restrained for assessment, the window of opportunity for data collection is relatively short. For wild dolphins, researchers have described a variety of age-determination techniques, but the gold-standard relies upon photo-identification to establish individual observational life histories from birth. However, there are few populations with such long-term data sets, therefore alternative techniques for age estimation are required for individual animals without a known birth period. While there are a variety of methods to estimate ages, each involves some combination of drawbacks, including a lack of precision across all ages, weeks-to-months of analysis time, logistical concerns for field applications, and/or novel techniques still in early development and validation. Here, we describe a non-invasive field technique to determine the age of small cetaceans using periapical dental radiography and subsequent measurement of pulp:tooth area ratios. The technique has been successfully applied for bottlenose dolphins briefly restrained during capture-release heath assessments in various locations in the Gulf of Mexico. Based on our comparisons of dental radiography data to life history ages, the pulp:tooth area ratio method can reliably provide same-day estimates for ages of dolphins up to about 10 years old."
https://openalex.org/W3103549751,"Background Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is increasingly being integrated into conventional medical care for cancer, used to counter the side effects of conventional cancer treatment, and offered as an alternative to conventional cancer care. Our aim is to gain a broader understanding of trends in CAM interventions for cancer and crowdfunding campaigns for these interventions. Methods GoFundMe campaigns fundraising for CAM were retrieved through a database of crowdfunding campaign data. Search terms were drawn from two National Institutes of Health lists of CAM cancer interventions and a previous study. Campaigns were excluded that did not match these or related search terms or were initiated outside of June 4 th , 2018 to June 4 th , 2019. Results 1,396 campaigns were identified from the US (n = 1,037, 73.9%), Canada (n = 165, 11.8%), and the UK (n = 107, 7.7%). Most common cancer types were breast (n = 344, 24.6%), colorectal (n = 131, 9.4%), and brain (n = 98, 7.0%). CAM interventions sought included supplements (n = 422, 30.2%), better nutrition (n = 293, 21.0%), high dose vitamin C (n = 276, 19.8%), naturopathy (n = 226, 16.2%), and cannabis products (n = 211, 15.1%). Mexico (n = 198, 41.9%), and the US (n = 169, 35.7%) were the most common treatment destinations. Conclusions These findings confirm active and ongoing interest in using crowdfunding platforms to finance CAM cancer interventions. They confirm previous findings that CAM users with cancer tend to have late stage cancers, cancers with high mortality rates, and specific diseases such as breast cancer. These findings can inform targeted responses where facilities engage in misleading marketing practices and the efficacy of interventions is unproven."
https://openalex.org/W3106391808,"UK legislation and government policy favour women’s rights to bodily autonomy and active involvement in childbirth decision-making including the right to decline recommendations of care/treatment. However, evidence suggests that both women and maternity professionals can face challenges enacting decisions outside of sociocultural norms. This study explored how NHS midwives facilitated women’s alternative physiological birthing choices–defined in this study as ‘birth choices that go outside of local/national maternity guidelines or when women decline recommended treatment of care , in the pursuit of a physiological birth’ . The study was underpinned by a feminist pragmatist theoretical framework and narrative methodology was used to collect professional stories of practice via self-written narratives and interviews. Through purposive and snowball sampling, a diverse sample in terms of age, years of experience, workplace settings and model of care they operated within, 45 NHS midwives from across the UK were recruited. Data were analysed using narrative thematic that generated four themes that described midwives’ processes of facilitating women’s alternative physiological births: 1. Relationship building, 2. Processes of support and facilitation, 3. Behind the scenes, 4. Birth facilitation. Collectively, the midwives were involved in a wide range of alternative birth choices across all birth settings. Fundamental to their practice was the development of mutually trusting relationships with the women which were strongly asserted a key component of safe care. The participants highlighted a wide range of personal and advanced clinical skills which was framed within an inherent desire to meet the women’s needs. Capturing what has been successfully achieved within institutionalised settings, specifically how, maternity providers may benefit from the findings of this study."
https://openalex.org/W3100874319,"Background Lung Cancer (LC) is one of the most common malign diseases worldwide. So far, it is unclear if the development of LC incidence and mortality leads to morbidity compression or expansion and whether these developments differ by socioeconomic characteristics. This study analyses time trends in social and gender inequalities in life years with and without LC in Germany. Methods The study is based on data of a large German statutory health insurance provider (N = 2,511,790). Incidence and mortality risks were estimated from multistate survival models. Trends in life years with and without LC were analysed using multistate life table analyses. All analyses were performed separately for gender, time period (2006–2009 and 2014–2017), and income group (&lt;60% and ≥60% of the German average income). Results Among men, declining LC incidence rates resulted in gains of life years free of LC and declining LC- affected life years and led to a relative compression, which was strongest in men with higher incomes. Among women, a clear increase in life years with LC led to an expansion of the lifespan affected by LC. This expansion was mainly driven by increasing incidence rates in women with low incomes. Overall, income inequalities in LC increased in both genders. Conclusions Our analyses reveal that developments in the length of life affected by LC differed substantially by gender and income and led to widening health inequalities over time. Public health efforts should mainly focus on vulnerable groups to reduce the persisting social inequalities in LC."
https://openalex.org/W3102503507,"Many researchers use life cycle assessment methodology to investigate the energy and environmental impacts of energy-saving and new energy vehicles. However, in the context of China, the life cycle energy-saving and emission-reduction effects of extended-range electric vehicles (EREVs), and the optimal applicable vehicle size and driving conditions for EREVs have been rarely studied. In this study, based on the life cycle assessment theory, the resource consumption, energy exhaustion, and environmental impact of EREVs were comprehensively analyzed. In addition, a differential evaluation model of ecological benefits was established for comparing EREVs with other vehicles with different power sources. Finally, scenario analysis was performed in terms of different vehicle sizes and driving conditions. The results have shown that EREV has great advantages in reducing mineral resource consumption and fossil energy consumption. The consumption of mineral resources of EREV is 14.68% lower than that of HEV, and the consumption of fossil energy is 34.72% lower than that of ICEV. In terms of environmental impact, EREV lies in the middle position. The scenario analysis has revealed that, for EREV in China, the optimal vehicle size is the passenger car and the optimal driving condition is the suburban condition. This work helps to understand the environmental performance of EREVs in China and may provide a decision-making reference for the government."
https://openalex.org/W3103352954,"Various incurable eye diseases in companion animals often result in phthisis bulbi and eye removal surgery. Currently, the evisceration method using silicone balls is useful in animals; however, it is not available to those with impaired cornea or severe ocular atrophy. Moreover, ocular implant and prostheses are not widely used because of the diversity in animal size and eye shape, and high manufacturing cost. Here, we produced low-cost and customized artificial eyes, including implant and prosthesis, using computer-aided design and three-dimensional (3D) printing technique. For 3D modeling, the size of the artificial eyes was optimized using B-mode ultrasonography. The design was exported to STL files, and then printed using polycaprolactone (PCL) for prosthesis and mixture of PCL and hydroxyapatite (HA) for ocular implant. The 3D printed artificial eyes could be produced in less than one and half hour. The prosthesis was painted using oil colors and biocompatible resin. Two types of eye removal surgery, including evisceration and enucleation, were performed using two beagle dogs, as a preliminary study. After the surgery, the dogs were clinically evaluated for 6 months and then histopathological evaluation of the implant was done. Ocular implant was biocompatible and host tissue ingrowth was induced after in vivo application. The custom-made prosthesis was cosmetically excellent. Although long-term clinical follow-up might be required, the use of 3D printed-customized artificial eyes may be beneficial for animals that need personalized artificial eye surgery."
https://openalex.org/W3101470436,"Potassium (K + ) acquisition, translocation and cellular homeostasis are mediated by various membrane transport systems in all organisms. We identified and described an ion channel in the ectomycorrhizal fungus Hebeloma cylindrosporum ( Hc SKC) that harbors features of animal voltage-dependent Shaker -like K + channels, and investigated its role in both free-living hyphae and symbiotic conditions. RNAi lines affected in the expression of HcSKC were produced and used for in vitro mycorrhizal assays with the maritime pine as host plant, under standard or low K + conditions. The adaptation of H . cylindrosporum to the downregulation of HcSKC was analyzed by qRT-PCR analyses for other K + -related transport proteins: the transporters HcTrk1 , HcTrk2 , and HcHAK , and the ion channels HcTOK1 , HcTOK2 . 1 , and HcTOK2 . 2 . Downregulated HcSKC transformants displayed greater K + contents at standard K + only. In such conditions, plants inoculated with these transgenic lines were impaired in K + nutrition. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that the reduced expression of HcSKC modifies the pool of fungal K + available for the plant and/or affects its symbiotic transfer to the roots. Our study reveals that the maintenance of K + transport in H . cylindrosporum , through the regulation of HcSKC expression, is required for the K + nutrition of the host plant."

https://openalex.org/W3102368119,"When oral bacteria accidentally enter the bloodstream due to transient tissue damage during dental procedures, they have the potential to attach to the endocardium or an equivalent surface of an indwelling prosthesis and cause infection. Many bacterial species produce extracellular vesicles (EVs) as part of normal physiology, but also use it as a virulence strategy. In this study, it was hypothesized that Granulicatella adiacens produce EVs that possibly help it in virulence. Therefore, the objectives were to isolate and characterize EVs produced by G . adiacens and to investigate its immune-stimulatory effects. The reference strain G . adiacens CCUG 27809 was cultured on chocolate blood agar for 2 days. From subsequent broth culture, the EVs were isolated using differential centrifugation and filtration protocol and then observed using scanning electron microscopy. Proteins in the vesicle preparation were identified by nano LC-ESI-MS/MS. The EVs proteome was analyzed and characterized using different bioinformatics tools. The immune-stimulatory effect of the EVs was studied via ELISA quantification of IL-8, IL-1β and CCL5, major proinflammatory cytokines, produced from stimulated human PBMCs. It was revealed that G . adiacens produced EVs, ranging in diameter from 30 to 250 nm. Overall, G . adiacens EVs contained 112 proteins. The proteome consists of several ribosomal proteins, DNA associated proteins, binding proteins, and metabolic enzymes. It was also shown that these EVs carry putative virulence factors including moonlighting proteins. These EVs were able to induce the production of IL-8, IL-1β and CCL5 from human PBMCs. Further functional characterization of the G . adiacens EVs may provide new insights into virulence mechanisms of this important but less studied oral bacterial species."
https://openalex.org/W3104192062,"An efficient and informative statistical method to analyze genotype-by-environment interaction (GxE) is needed in maize breeding programs. Thus, the objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of multiple-trait models (MTM), random regression models (RRM), and compound symmetry models (CSM) in the analysis of multi-environment trials (MET) in maize breeding. For this, a data set with 84 maize hybrids evaluated across four environments for the trait grain yield (GY) was used. Variance components were estimated by restricted maximum likelihood (REML), and genetic values were predicted by best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP). The best fit MTM, RRM, and CSM were identified by the Akaike information criterion (AIC), and the significance of the genetic effects were tested using the likelihood ratio test (LRT). Genetic gains were predicted considering four selection intensities (5, 10, 15, and 20 hybrids). The selected MTM, RRM, and CSM models fit heterogeneous residuals. Moreover, for RRM the genetic effects were modeled by Legendre polynomials of order two. Genetic variability between maize hybrids were assessed for GY. In general, estimates of broad-sense heritability, selective accuracy, and predicted selection gains were slightly higher when obtained using MTM and RRM. Thus, considering the criterion of parsimony and the possibility of predicting genetic values of hybrids for untested environments, RRM is a preferential approach for analyzing MET in maize breeding."

We have assessed the performance of serum apolipoprotein-A1, the main transporter of HDL-cholesterol, to identify the early spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) in the general population and its diagnostic performance for the Covid-19. Methods We compared the daily mean serum apolipoprotein-A1 during the first 34 weeks of 2020 in a population that is routinely followed for a risk of liver fibrosis risk in the USA (212,297 serum) and in France (20,652 serum) in relation to a local increase in confirmed cases, and in comparison to the same period in 2019 (266,976 and 28,452 serum, respectively). We prospectively assessed the sensitivity of this marker in an observational study of 136 consecutive hospitalized cases and retrospectively evaluated its specificity in 7,481 controls representing the general population. Results The mean serum apolipoprotein-A1 levels in the survey populations began decreasing in January 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. This decrease was highly correlated with the daily increase in confirmed Covid-19 cases in the following 34 weeks, both in France and USA, including the June and mid-July recovery periods in France. Apolipoprotein-A1 at the 1.25 g/L cutoff had a sensitivity of 90.6% (95%CI84.2–95.1) and a specificity of 96.1% (95.7–96.6%) for the diagnosis of Covid-19. The area under the characteristics curve was 0.978 (0.957–0.988), and outperformed haptoglobin and liver function tests. The adjusted risk ratio of apolipoprotein-A1 for survival without transfer to intensive care unit was 5.61 (95%CI 1.02–31.0; P = 0.04). Conclusion Apolipoprotein-A1 could be a sentinel of the pandemic in existing routine surveillance of the general population. NCT01927133, CER-2020-14."
https://openalex.org/W3098195878,"Introduction and aims The non-medical use of prescription stimulants such as methylphenidate, dexamphetamine and modafinil is increasing in popularity within tertiary academic settings. There is a paucity of information on awareness, attitudes, and acceptability by professionals of use in this context. This study aimed to investigate professionals’ knowledge of and attitudes towards the use of cognitive enhancers (CEs) in academic settings, and their willingness to use a hypothetical CE. Design and methods A mail survey was sent to doctors, pharmacists, nurses, accountants and lawyers in New Zealand. These disciplines were chosen as they require professional registration to practice. The questionnaire comprised four sections: (1) demographics, (2) knowledge of CEs, (3) attitudes towards the use of CEs, and (4) willingness to use hypothetical CEs. Results The response rate was 34.5% (414/1200). Overall, participants strongly disagreed that it was fair to allow university students to use CEs for cognitive enhancement (Mdn = 1, IQR: 1,3), or that it is ethical for students without a prescription to use cognitive enhancers for any reason (Mdn = 1, IQR: 1,2). Professions differed in their attitudes towards whether it is ethical for students without a prescription to use CEs for any reason ( p = 0.001, H 31.527). Discussion and conclusion Divergent views and lack of clear consensus within professions and between professionals on the use of CEs have the potential to influence both professionals and students as future professionals. These divergent views may stem from differences in the core values of self-identity as well as extrinsic factors of acceptability within the profession in balancing the elements of opportunity, fairness and authenticity in cognitive enhancement. Further research is required to inform the development of policy and guidelines that are congruent with all professions."
https://openalex.org/W3098915969,"The purpose of this ecological study was to explore the association of weather with severity indicators of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Daily COVID-19-related intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and in-hospital deaths in the Paris region and the daily weather characteristics of Paris midtown were correlated with a time lag. We assessed different study periods (41, 45, 50, 55, and 62 days) beginning from 31 March 2020. Daily ICU admissions and in-hospital deaths were strongly and negatively correlated to ambient temperatures (minimal, average, and maximal). The highest Pearson correlation coefficients and statistically significant p values were found 8 days before the occurrence of ICU admissions and 15 days before deaths. Partial correlations with adjustment on days since lockdown showed similar significant results. The study findings show a negative correlation of previously observed ambient temperature with severity indicators of COVID-19 that could partly explain the death toll discrepancies between and within countries."

However, studies on intraday reliability, sensitivity, and minimum detectable change (MDC) are lacking. This study aimed to investigate and compare the reliability, sensitivity, and MDC values of NPFM in preschool children between the ages of 3.5 to 6 years. Six items of NPFM including 10-m shuttle run, standing long jump, balance beam walking, sit-and-reach, tennis throwing, and double-leg timed hop, were tested for 209 Chinese kindergarten children in Beijing in the morning. Intraday relative reliability was tested using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC 3,1 ) with a 95% confidence interval while absolute reliability was expressed in standard error of measurement (SEM) and percentage of coefficient of variation (CV%). Test sensitivity was assessed by comparing the smallest worthwhile change (SWC) with SEM, while MDC values with 95% confidence interval (MDC 95 ) were established. Measurements in most groups, except 10-m shuttle run test (ICC 3,1 : 0.56 to 0.74 [moderate]) in the 3.5 to 5.5-year-old groups, balance beam test in 4- and 5-year-old (ICC 3,1 : 0.33 to 0.35 [poor]) and 5.5-year-old (ICC 3,1 = 0.68 [moderate]) groups, and double-leg timed hop test (ICC 3,1 = 0.67 [moderate]) in the 4.5-year-old group, demonstrated good to excellent relative reliability (ICC 3,1 : 0.77 to 0.97). The balance beam walking test showed poor absolute reliability in all the groups (SEM%: 11.76 to 22.28 and CV%: 15.40 to 24.78). Both standing long jump and sit-and-reach tests demonstrated good sensitivity (SWC &gt; SEM) in all subjects group, boys, and girls. Pairwise comparison revealed systematic bias with significantly better performance in the second trial ( p &lt;0.01) of all the tests with moderate to large effect size."
https://openalex.org/W3104881676,"Naphtha catalytic reforming (NCR) process has been of tremendous attention all over the world owing to the significant requirement for high-quality gasoline. Industrialized naphtha reforming unit at oil refineries applies a series of fixed bed reactors (FBRs) to improve the quality of the low-octane hydrocarbons and convert them to more valuable products. The prominent purpose of this research is to understand the catalytic reactor of naphtha reforming unit. For this aim, an appropriate mechanistic modeling and its related CFD-based computational simulation is presented to predict the behavior of the system when the reactors are of the axial flow type. Also, the triangular meshing technique (TMT) is performed in this paper due to its brilliant ability to analyze the results of model’s predictions along with improving the computational accuracy. Additionally, mesh independence analysis is done to find the optimum number of meshes needed for reaching the results convergence. Moreover, suitable kinetic and thermodynamic equations are derived based on Smith model to describe the NCR process. The results proved that the proceeding of NCR process inside the reactor significantly increased the concentration amount of aromatic materials, lighter ends and hydrogen, while deteriorated the concentration amount of naphthene and paraffin. Moreover, the pressure drop along the reactor length was achieved very low, which can be considered as one of the momentous advantages of NCR process."

The present study was conducted in 2016 in the state of Rio Grande do Norte, and the aims were to describe the epidemiological and the clinical aspects of the CHIKV outbreak. Biological samples from 284 chikungunya suspected cases were screened for CHIKV and Flavivirus (FV) RNA using qRT-PCR. Negative PCR samples were also screened for anti-CHIKV and anti-FVIgM by ELISA. CHIKV RNA were detected in 125 samples mostly occurring from January through March (46%), mainly affecting adults and older adults. We found a gradual decrease in viral RNA over the disease time. Anti-CHIKV IgM was found in 47.5% after negative CHIKV qRT-PCR. Interestingly, 45.0% simultaneously had positive results for CHIKV and FV IgM, suggesting the occurrence of virus co-circulation. The most frequent symptom was fever (91%). Women presented more chance to develop nausea and abdominal pain compared to men. Our data described and allows us to better understand the clinical and epidemiological aspects of the 2016 chikungunya outbreak in Rio Grande do Norte and can help in the early clinical diagnosis of the virus."
https://openalex.org/W3103884425,"The evaluation of fat-free mass (FFM) in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is useful to investigate disease progression and therapeutic efficacy. This study aimed to validate the Bioelectrical impedance (BIA) method compared with the dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) for estimating the %FFM in boys with DMD. This is a cross-sectional study performed with children and adolescents diagnosed with DMD. Resistance and reactance were measured with a BIA analyzer, from which eight predictive equations estimated the %FFM. The %FFM was also determined by DXA and its used as a reference method. Pearson correlation test, coefficient of determination, the root-mean-square error, the interclass correlation coefficient, and linear regression analysis were performed between %FFM values obtained by BIA and DXA. The agreement between these values was verified with the Bland-Altman plot analysis. Forty-six boys aged from 5 to 20 years were enrolled in the study. All the equations showed a correlation between the %FFM estimated by BIA and determined by DXA (p &lt; 0.05). The Bland-Altman method indicated that two equations have a significant bias (p &lt; 0.05) and six equations showed no significant bias of %FFM (p &gt; 0.05). However, one of them has high variation and wide limits of agreement. Five of eight %FFM predictive equations tested in DMD were accurate when compared with the DXA. It can be concluded that BIA is a validity method to evaluate patients with DMD."
https://openalex.org/W3105863599,"Programmed death-1 (PD-1) is an immunoinhibitory receptor expressed on lymphocytes. Interaction of PD-1 with its ligand PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1) delivers inhibitory signals and impairs proliferation, cytokine production, and cytotoxicity of T cells. In our previous studies, we have developed anti-bovine PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and reported that the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway was closely associated with T-cell exhaustion and disease progression in bovine chronic infections and canine tumors. Furthermore, we found that blocking antibodies that target PD-1 and PD-L1 restore T-cell functions and could be used in immunotherapy in cattle and dogs. However, the immunological role of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway for chronic equine diseases, including tumors, remains unclear. In this study, we identified cDNA sequences of equine PD-1 (EqPD-1) and PD-L1 (EqPD-L1) and investigated the role of anti-bovine PD-L1 mAbs against EqPD-L1 using in vitro assays. In addition, we evaluated the expression of PD-L1 in tumor tissues of equine malignant melanoma (EMM). The amino acid sequences of EqPD-1 and EqPD-L1 share a considerable identity and similarity with homologs from non-primate species. Two clones of the anti-bovine PD-L1 mAbs recognized EqPD-L1 in flow cytometry, and one of these cross-reactive mAbs blocked the binding of equine PD-1/PD-L1. Of note, immunohistochemistry confirmed the PD-L1 expression in EMM tumor tissues. A cultivation assay revealed that PD-L1 blockade enhanced the production of Th1 cytokines in equine immune cells. These findings showed that our anti-PD-L1 mAbs would be useful for analyzing the equine PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. Further research is warranted to discover the immunological role of PD-1/PD-L1 in chronic equine diseases and elucidate a future application in immunotherapy for horses."
https://openalex.org/W3098730796,"Introduction Illusion of movement induced by tendon vibration is an effective approach for motor and sensory rehabilitation in case of neurological impairments. The aim of our study was to investigate which modality of visual feedback in Virtual Reality (VR) associated with tendon vibration of the wrist could induce the best illusion of movement. Methods We included 30 healthy participants in the experiment. Tendon vibration inducing illusion of movement (wrist extension, 100Hz) was applied on their wrist during 3 VR visual conditions (10 times each): a moving virtual hand corresponding to the movement that the participants could feel during the tendon vibration (Moving condition), a static virtual hand (Static condition), or no virtual hand at all (Hidden condition). After each trial, the participants had to quantify the intensity of the illusory movement on a Likert scale, the subjective degree of extension of their wrist and afterwards they answered a questionnaire. Results There was a significant difference between the 3 visual feedback conditions concerning the Likert scale ranking and the degree of wrist’s extension (p&lt;0.001). The Moving condition induced a higher intensity of illusion of movement and a higher sensation of wrist’s extension than the Hidden condition (p&lt;0.001 and p&lt;0.001 respectively) than that of the Static condition (p&lt;0.001 and p&lt;0.001 respectively). The Hidden condition also induced a higher intensity of illusion of movement and a higher sensation of wrist’s extension than the Static condition (p&lt;0.01 and p&lt;0.01 respectively). The preferred condition to facilitate movement’s illusion was the Moving condition (63.3%). Conclusions This study demonstrated the importance of carefully selecting a visual feedback to improve the illusion of movement induced by tendon vibration, and the increase of illusion by adding VR visual cues congruent to the illusion of movement. Further work will consist in testing the same hypothesis with stroke patients."

Methods This is a retrospective study of cataract phacoemulsification combined with intraocular lens implantation in patients with steep curvature cornea (corneal curvature ≥ 46D). The refractive prediction errors of IOL power calculation formulas (SRK/T, Haigis, Holladay, Hoffer Q, and Barrett Universal II) using User Group for Laser Interference Biometry (ULIB) constants were evaluated and compared. Objective refraction results were assessed at one month postoperatively. According to axial length (AL), all patients were divided into three groups: short AL group (&lt;22mm), normal AL group (&gt;22 to ≤24.5mm) and long AL group (&gt;24.5mm). Calculate the refractive error and absolute refractive error (AE) between the actual postoperative refractive power and the predicted postoperative refractive power. The covariance analysis was used for the comparison of five formulas in each group. The correlation between the absolute refractive error and AL from every formula were analyzed by Pearson correlation test, respectively. Result Total 112 eyes of 83 cataract patients with steep curvature cornea were collected. The anterior chamber depth (ACD) was a covariate in the short AL group in the covariance analysis of absolute refractive error ( P &lt;0.001). The SRK/T and Holladay formula had the lowest mean absolute error (MAE) (0.47D), there were statistically significant differences in MAE between the five formulas for short AL group ( P = 0.024). The anterior chamber depth had no significant correlation in the five calculation formulas in the normal AL group and long AL group ( P = 0.521, P = 0.609 respectively). In the normal AL group, there was no significant difference in MAE between the five calculation formulas ( P = 0.609). In the long AL group, Barrett Universal II formula had the lowest MAE (0.35), and there were statistically significant differences in MAE between the five formulas ( P = 0.012). Over the entire AL range, the Barrett Universal II formula had the lowest MAE and the highest percentage of eyes within ± 0.50 D, ± 1.00 D, and ± 1.50 D (69.6%, 93.8%, and 98.2% respectively). Conclusion Compared to SRK/T, Haigis, Hoffer Q, and Holladay, Barrett Universal Ⅱ formula is more accurate in predicting the IOL power in the cataract patients with steep curvature cornea ≥ 46.0 diopters."
https://openalex.org/W3101010369,"Increasing people’s willingness to donate organs after their death requires effective communication strategies. In two preregistered studies, we assessed whether humorous entertainment education formats on organ donation elicit positive effects on knowledge, fears, attitudes, and behavioral intentions–both immediately after the treatment and four weeks later. We test whether perceived funniness mediates expected effects on attitudes and intentions. Study 1 is a quasi-experiment which uses a live medical comedy show (N = 3,964) as an entertainment education format, which either contained or did not contain information about organ donation. Study 2, a lab experiment, tests humor’s causal effect in a pre-post design with a control group (N = 144) in which the same content was provided in either a humorous or non-humorous way in an audio podcast. Results showed that humorous interventions per se were not more effective than neutral information, but that informing people about organ donation in general increased donation intentions, attitudes, and knowledge. However, humorous interventions were especially effective in reducing fears related to organ donation. The findings are discussed regarding the opportunities for sensitive health communication through entertainment education formats, psychological processes that humor triggers, and humor’s role in health communication formats."
https://openalex.org/W3104605053,"Aim The main cause of childhood overweight/obesity is an imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure. The objective was to determine whether the intake by Spanish schoolchildren of sugars from habitually consumed foods and drinks can be related to overweight/obesity. Methods Subjects The study included 657 schoolchildren between 7–10 years from educational centers in Southern Spain. These children live under the influence of the Mediterranean diet. Design Participants completed an encoded questionnaire with three sections: a) data on sex, age, educational center, school year, and life/family habits, among others; b) semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire related to the previous 12 months; and c) information on anthropometrics and physical activities. Results Obesity was observed in 10.9% of the children. The daily activity questionnaire showed a mean energy expenditure of 8.73 (1.33) MJ/day. The study considered foods that supply carbohydrates in any form (total carbohydrates, starch, total sugars, added sugars, and free sugars). The likelihood of overweight/obesity was significantly greater with a higher intake/day of total sugars, starch, added sugars, and free sugars. The likelihood of normal weight was significantly greater with lower energy expenditure in sedentary activities (OR = 3.03), higher energy expenditure in sports activities (OR = 1.72), and higher total activity/day measured as METs (OR = 8.31). Conclusions In this population, overweight/obesity was influenced by the physical activity of the children and by their intake of energy, total sugars, starch, added sugars, and free sugars. Further studies are warranted to verify this observation and explore the implications for public health policies."
https://openalex.org/W3104915657,"Background and aim We sought to determine the association between alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in the normal range and mortality in the absence of liver dysfunction to better understand ALT’s clinical significance beyond liver injury and inflammation. Methods A cohort of 2,708 male and 3,461 female adults aged 20–75 years without liver dysfunction (ALT&lt;30 in males &amp; &lt;19 in females, negative viral serologies, negative ultrasound-based steatosis, no excess alcohol consumption) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)-III (1988–1994) were linked to the National Death Index through December 31, 2015. Serum ALT levels were categorized into sex-specific quartiles (Females: &lt;9, 9–11, 11–14, ≥14 IU/L, Male: &lt;12, 12–15, 15–20, ≥20 U/L). The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated, adjusting for covariates and accounting for the complex survey design. Results Relative to males in the lowest quartile (Q1), males in the highest quartile (Q4) had 44% decreased risk of all-cause mortality (aHR [95% CI]: 0.56 [0.42, 0.74]). Females in Q4 had 45% decreased risk of all-cause mortality (aHR [95% CI]: 0.55 [0.40, 0.77]). Males with BMI &lt;25 kg/m 2 in Q4 had significantly lower risk of all-cause mortality than Q1; however, this association did not exist in males with BMI ≥25 (BMI&lt;25: 0.36 [0.20, 0.64], BMI≥25: 0.77 [0.49, 1.22]). Risk of all-cause mortality was lower in males ≥50 years than in males&lt;50 (age≥50: 0.55 [0.39, 0.77], age&lt;50: 0.81 [0.39, 1.69]). These age- and BMI-related differences were not seen in females. Conclusion ALT within the normal range was inversely associated with all-cause mortality in U.S. adults."
https://openalex.org/W3098157408,"Objective Frequent travel between the Southern border states in the USA, Mexico, and Latin American countries increases the risk of the Zika virus (ZIKV) spread. Patient education on virus transmission is fundamental in decreasing the number of imported cases, particularly among pregnant women. Methods The study used cross-sectional methodology to investigate information sources and knowledge concerning the ZIKV virus among 300 under-served pregnant Latinas recruited from prenatal care clinics in the North Texas region. Bivariate and multiple logistic regression models were used to investigate associations between the primary outcomes and patient characteristics. Results Physicians, nurses, and families are the major sources for pregnancy information, while media/internet (65%) and physician/nurse (33%) are the main sources for ZIKV information. Less than one-half of the mothers reported that their physician/nurse did not discuss safe sexual practices or inquired about their sexual practices. A considerable proportion of women from the community clinic were neither warned nor queried about travel to ZIKV risk countries. There is an overall understanding of Zika virus transmission, symptoms, complications, and recommended guidelines. Younger age and single mother status are risk factors for lack of ZIKV knowledge. Foreign-born mothers are 2.5–3.0 times more likely to have knowledge on disease transmission, symptoms, and microcephaly condition. While, younger mothers (18–24) are less likely to have knowledge of ZIKV infection symptoms (fever, rash and pink eye) and transmission of infection via unprotected sexual (vaginal, anal, or oral) behavior, compared to older mothers. Conclusions Interventions are needed to heighten the knowledge of ZIKV, particularly among women of reproductive age and their male partners in the community health care setting. Our study underscores the need for health care providers to be trained in delivering messages to enhance risk perception during health emergencies to vulnerable and underserved families (lower economic background, language ability, and culture). During health emergencies, clinics must disseminate crucial information via multi modalities to ensure messages reach the targeted patients."
https://openalex.org/W3098590573,"Objective To investigate whether a structured inquiry during pregnancy of medical factors and social factors associated with low socioeconomic status, and subsequent patient-centred maternity care could increase maternal empowerment. Design Cluster-randomised controlled trial. Setting This study was conducted among pregnant women in selected urban areas in the Netherlands. This study was part of the nationwide Healthy Pregnancy 4 All-2 programme. Population Pregnant women listed at one of the sixteen participating maternity care organisations between July 1, 2015, and Dec 31, 2016. Methods All practices were instructed to provide a systematic risk assessment during pregnancy. Practices were randomly allocated to continue usual care (seven practices), or to provide a patient-centred, risk-guided approach to addressing any risks (nine practices) identified via the risk assessment during pregnancy. Main outcome measures Low postpartum maternal empowerment score. Results We recruited 1579 participants; 879 participants in the intervention arm, and 700 participants in the control arm. The prevalence of one or more risk factors during pregnancy was similar between the two arms: 40% and 39%, respectively. In our intention-to-treat analysis, the intervention resulted in a significant reduction in the odds of having a low empowerment score [i.e. the primary outcome; adjusted OR 0.69 ((95% CI 0.47; 0.99), P 0.046)]. Conclusions Implementation of additional risk assessment addressing both medical and social factors and subsequent tailored preventive strategies into maternity care reduced the incidence of low maternal empowerment during the postpartum period. Introducing this approach in routine maternity care may help reduce early adversity during the postpartum period."
https://openalex.org/W3105265185,"Background The benefits of Point of Care Ultrasound (POCUS) are well established in the literature. As it is an operator-dependent modality, the operator is required to be skilled in obtaining and interpreting images. Physicians who are not trained in POCUS attend courses to acquire the basics in this field. The effectiveness of such short POCUS courses on daily POCUS utilization is unknown. We sought to measure the change in POCUS utilization after practicing physicians attended short POCUS courses. Methods A 13-statements questionnaire was sent to physicians who attended POCUS courses conducted at the Soroka University Medical Center between the years 2014–2018. Our primary objective was to compare pre-course and post-course POCUS utilization. Secondary objectives included understanding the course graduates’ perceived effect of POCUS on diagnosis, the frequency of ultrasound utilization and time to effective therapy. Results 212 residents and specialists received the questionnaire between 2014–2018; 116 responded (response rate of 54.7%). 72 (62.1%) participants were male, 64 (55.2%) were residents, 49 (42.3%) were specialists, 3 (2.5%) participants did not state their career status. 90 (77.6%) participants declared moderate use or multiple ultrasound use six months to four years from the POCUS course, compared to a rate of ‘no use at all’ and ‘minimal use of 84.9% before the course. 98 participants [84.4% CI 77.8%, 91.0%] agree and strongly agree that a short POCUS course may improve diagnostic skills and 76.7% [CI 69.0%, 84.3%] agree and strongly agree that the POCUS course may shorten time to diagnosis and reduce morbidity. Conclusions Our short POCUS course significantly increases bedside ultrasound utilization by physicians from different fields even 4 years from course completion. Course graduates strongly agreed that incorporating POCUS into their clinical practice improves patient care. Such courses should be offered to residents and senior physicians to close the existing gap in POCUS knowledge among practicing physicians."
https://openalex.org/W3105820997,"Idiopathic Inflammatory Myopathies (IIMs) have been studied within the framework of autoimmune diseases where skeletal muscle appears to have a passive role in the illness. However, persiting weakness even after resolving inflammation raises questions about the role that skeletal muscle plays by itself in these diseases. ""Non-immune mediated"" hypotheses have arisen to consider inner skeletal muscle cell processes as trigger factors in the clinical manifestations of IIMs. Alterations in oxidative phosphorylation, ATP production, calcium handling, autophagy, endoplasmic reticulum stress, among others, have been proposed as alternative cellular pathophysiological mechanisms. In this study, we used skeletal muscle-derived cells, from healthy controls and IIM patients to determine mitochondrial function and mitochondrial ability to adapt to a metabolic stress when deprived of glucose. We hypothesized that mitochondria would be dysfunctional in IIM samples, which was partially true in normal glucose rich growing medium as determined by oxygen consumption rate. However, in the glucose-free and galactose supplemented condition, a medium that forced mitochondria to function, IIM cells increased their respiration, reaching values matching normal derived cells. Unexpectedly, cell death significantly increased in IIM cells under this condition. Our findings show that mitochondria in IIM is functional and the decrease respiration observed is part of an adaptative response to improve survival. The increased metabolic function obtained after forcing IIM cells to rely on mitochondrial synthesized ATP is detrimental to the cell’s viability. Thus, therapeutic interventions that activate mitochondria, could be detrimental in IIM cell physiology, and must be avoided in patients with IIM."
https://openalex.org/W3106541518,"Cognitive memory and introspection disturbances are considered core features of schizophrenia. Moreover, it remains unclear whether or not participants with schizophrenia are more cognitively impaired with ageing than healthy participants. The aims of this study were to use a metacognitive approach to determine whether elderly participants with schizophrenia are able to improve their memory performance using a specific generation strategy and to evaluate the memory benefits for them using this strategy. 20 younger and 20 older participants with schizophrenia and their comparison participants matched for age, gender and education learned paired associates words with either reading or generation, rated judgment of learning (JOL) and performed cued recall. Participants with schizophrenia recalled fewer words than healthy comparison participants, but they benefited more from generation, and this difference was stable with ageing. Their JOL magnitude was lower than that of healthy comparison participants, but JOL accuracy was not affected by either age or the pathology. In spite of their memory deficit, elderly and younger participants with schizophrenia benefited remarkably from the memory generation strategy. This result gives some cause for optimism as to the possibility for participants with schizophrenia to reduce memory impairment if learning conditions lead them to encode deeply."
https://openalex.org/W3102126903,"Identification of bacterial virulence factors is critical for understanding disease pathogenesis, drug discovery and vaccine development. In this study we used two approaches to predict virulence factors of Burkholderia pseudomallei , the Gram-negative bacterium that causes melioidosis. B . pseudomallei is naturally antibiotic resistant and there are no clinically available melioidosis vaccines. To identify B . pseudomallei protein targets for drug discovery and vaccine development, we chose to search for substrates of the B . pseudomallei periplasmic disulfide bond forming protein A (DsbA). DsbA introduces disulfide bonds into extra-cytoplasmic proteins and is essential for virulence in many Gram-negative organism, including B . pseudomallei . The first approach to identify B . pseudomallei DsbA virulence factor substrates was a large-scale genomic analysis of 511 unique B . pseudomallei disease-associated strains. This yielded 4,496 core gene products, of which we hypothesise 263 are DsbA substrates. Manual curation and database screening of the 263 mature proteins yielded 81 associated with disease pathogenesis or virulence. These were screened for structural homologues to predict potential B-cell epitopes. In the second approach, we searched the B . pseudomallei genome for homologues of the more than 90 known DsbA substrates in other bacteria. Using this approach, we identified 15 putative B . pseudomallei DsbA virulence factor substrates, with two of these previously identified in the genomic approach, bringing the total number of putative DsbA virulence factor substrates to 94. The two putative B . pseudomallei virulence factors identified by both methods are homologues of PenI family β-lactamase and a molecular chaperone. These two proteins could serve as high priority targets for future B . pseudomallei virulence factor characterization."
https://openalex.org/W3105359457,"Background HIV prevalence data among pregnant women have been critical to estimating HIV trends and geographical patterns of HIV in many African countries. Although antenatal HIV prevalence data are known to be biased representations of HIV prevalence in the general population, mathematical models have made various adjustments to control for known sources of bias, including the effect of HIV on fertility, the age profile of pregnant women and sexual experience. Methods and findings We assessed whether assumptions about antenatal bias affect conclusions about trends and geographical variation in HIV prevalence, using simulated datasets generated by an agent-based model of HIV and fertility in South Africa. Results suggest that even when controlling for age and other previously-considered sources of bias, antenatal bias in South Africa has not been constant over time, and trends in bias differ substantially by age. Differences in the average duration of infection explain much of this variation. We propose an HIV duration-adjusted measure of antenatal bias that is more stable, which yields higher estimates of HIV incidence in recent years and at older ages. Simpler measures of antenatal bias, which are not age-adjusted, yield estimates of HIV prevalence and incidence that are too high in the early stages of the HIV epidemic, and that are less precise. Antenatal bias in South Africa is substantially greater in urban areas than in rural areas. Conclusions Age-standardized approaches to defining antenatal bias are likely to improve precision in model-based estimates, and further recency adjustments increase estimates of HIV incidence in recent years and at older ages. Incompletely adjusting for changing antenatal bias may explain why previous model estimates overstated the early HIV burden in South Africa. New assays to estimate the fraction of HIV-positive pregnant women who are recently infected could play an important role in better estimating antenatal bias."
https://openalex.org/W3104194942,"Background HIV prevalence in Mozambique (12.6%) is one of the highest in the world, yet ~40% of people living with HIV (PLHIV) do not know their HIV status. Strategies to increase HIV testing uptake and diagnosis among PLHIV are urgently needed. Home-based HIV testing services (HBHTS) have been evaluated primarily as a 1-time campaign strategy. Little is known about the potential of repeating HBHTS to diagnose HIV infection among persons who have never been tested (NTs), nor about factors/reasons associated with never testing in a generalized epidemic setting. Methods During 2014–2017, counselors visited all households annually in the Chókwè Health and Demographic Surveillance System (CHDSS) and offered HBHTS. Cross-sectional surveys were administered to randomly selected 10% or 20% samples of CHDSS households with participants aged 15–59 years before HBHTS were conducted during the visit. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were used to assess the proportion of NTs, factors/reasons associated with never having been tested, HBHTS acceptance, and HIV-positive diagnosis among NTs. Results The proportion of NTs decreased from 25% (95% confidence interval [CI]:23%–26%) during 2014 to 12% (95% CI:11% –13%), 7% (95% CI:6%–8%), and 7% (95% CI:6%–8%) during 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively. Adolescent boys and girls and adult men were more likely than adult women to be NTs. In each of the four years, the majority of NTs (87%–90%) accepted HBHTS. HIV-positive yield among NTs subsequently accepting HBHTS was highest (13%, 95% CI:10%–15%) during 2014 and gradually reduced to 11% (95% CI:8%–15%), 9% (95% CI:6%–12%), and 2% (95% CI:0%–4%) during 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively. Conclusions Repeated HBHTS was helpful in increasing HIV testing coverage and identifying PLHIV in Chókwè. In high HIV-prevalence settings with low testing coverage, repeated HBHTS can be considered to increase HIV testing uptake and diagnosis among NTs."
https://openalex.org/W3104265727,"For decades, traditional correlation analysis and regression models have been used in social science research. However, the development of machine learning algorithms makes it possible to apply machine learning techniques for social science research and social issues, which may outperform standard regression methods in some cases. Under the circumstances, this article proposes a methodological workflow for data analysis by machine learning techniques that have the possibility to be widely applied in social issues. Specifically, the workflow tries to uncover the natural mechanisms behind the social issues through a data-driven perspective from feature selection to model building. The advantage of data-driven techniques in feature selection is that the workflow can be built without so much restriction of related knowledge and theory in social science. The advantage of using machine learning techniques in modelling is to uncover non-linear and complex relationships behind social issues. The main purpose of our methodological workflow is to find important fields relevant to the target and provide appropriate predictions. However, to explain the result still needs theory and knowledge from social science. In this paper, we trained a methodological workflow with left-behind children as the social issue case, and all steps and full results are included."
https://openalex.org/W3105374702,"In this article, we present the development and validation of an implicit association test for measuring secondary school students’ associations between genetics concepts and teleology concepts on the one hand, and between genetics concepts and essentialism concepts on the other hand. In total, 169 students from 16 school classes took part in the study, from January 2018 to May 2018. We investigated the strength of the aforementioned associations and the influence of various covariates such as gender, age, school class, or previous learning of biology on the association of teleology or essentialism concepts with genetics concepts through an analysis of covariance and a multi-level analysis. We found moderate associations between genetics and teleology concepts, as well as between genetics and essentialism concepts. These results might reflect a tendency of students of different ages and with various backgrounds to think about genes in terms of goals (teleology) and stability (essentialism), which should be investigated further in future research."
https://openalex.org/W3099279734,"Purpose The U.S. federal Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is often considered the most effective antipoverty program for families in the U.S., leading to a variety of improved outcomes such as educational attainment, work incentives, economic activity, income, and health benefits for mothers, infants and children. State EITC supplements to the federal credit can significantly enhance the magnitude of this intervention. In this paper we advance EITC and health research by: 1) describing the diffusion of state EITC policies over 40 years, 2) presenting patterns in important EITC policy dimensions across space and time, and 3) disseminating a robust data set to advance future research by policy analysts and scientists. Methods We used current public health law research methods to systematically collect, conduct textual legal analysis, and numerically code all EITC legislative changes from 1980 through 2020 in the 50 states and Washington, D.C. Results First, the pattern of diffusion across states and time shows initial introductions during the 1990s in the Midwest, then spreading to the Northeast, with more recent expansions in the West and South. Second, differences by state and time of important policy dimensions are evident, including size of credit and refundability. Third, state EITC benefits vary considerably by household structure. Conclusion Continued research on health outcomes is warranted to capture the full range of potential beneficial effects of EITCs on family and child wellbeing. Lawyers and policy analysts can collaborate with epidemiologists and economists on other high-quality empirical studies to assess the many dimensions of policy and law that potentially affect the social determinants of health."
https://openalex.org/W3100442623,"When my adviser asked to speak with me in her office in March, I figured she wanted to discuss plans for a possible lab shutdown. What she actually said took me completely by surprise: She was moving her lab to a new institution. I could go with her, uprooting my life but continuing to work on the science I loved—or I could stay, find a new mentor, and hope to keep some semblance of my original project. “Either way, you will get a Ph.D.,” she reassured me. She emphasized that she would do everything she could to support me, no matter what my decision was. Still, there I was, two-and-a-half years into my Ph.D., with a huge curveball to deal with. When I had heard about other students in similar situations in the past, I had always thought, “I'm so glad that's not me.” Now, it was me. > “If I moved with my adviser, it needed to fit my career aspirations and my personal life.” My initial response was impulsive. When my mentor said the name of the highly regarded institution she was moving to, I committed to relocating in less than 30 seconds. “I love my adviser and my project,” I thought. “I'll transfer and get the new institution's name on my CV.” I was thinking solely about my career. A few days later, my reality check began. I realized I should approach this decision the way I chose my Ph.D. program in the first place: If I moved with my adviser, it needed to fit my career aspirations and my personal life. How would moving affect my significant other? Would my stipend be livable in a new city with a higher cost of living? Would we be happy living in that new city? Did I really want to transfer, potentially starting my Ph.D. over? As each new question arose, I became increasingly uncertain. I didn't want to burden my mentor with my doubts. After all, I had already agreed to move, and she was already going above and beyond to accommodate me, including offering my significant other—also a scientist—a research associate position with our group. So, I downplayed my concerns and buried them at the end of our regular meetings. I mentioned them one at a time, always starting with, “I'm not that worried … .” But I was worried, and this approach left me carrying around the anxiety of each unknown detail for weeks. Ultimately—with the help of friends, family, my significant other, and my mentor—I decided to stick with my decision to move. But that wasn't the end of the challenges. At first, I thought that transferring to the new institution would be simple. I had completed my coursework and teaching requirements, and my mentor's new department thought I should be able to integrate seamlessly. So I was thrown for a loop when my prospective program determined that I would need to retake my qualifying exam and complete several classes and a new teaching requirement, likely adding at least 1 year to my grad school timeline. In the end, I decided to become a visiting student at my new school but earn my degree from my original institution after all. But being halfway in at two schools has its drawbacks. I miss my friends every day, and trying to build a social network in a new city as a fourth-year student amid a pandemic feels impossible. Occasionally I experience waves of impostor syndrome, convinced I do not deserve to be at this new, more prestigious institution. Email chains to work out administrative details are long and often contain some flavor of, “We have never had a student in exactly this position before and are still learning.” Simple tasks such as getting a university-sponsored flu shot are complicated when I can't decide how to answer, “Are you a student here?” Despite these challenges, I still believe I made the right choice—for me. If you are in a similar situation, I can't say you should do exactly what I did. All I can say is that you should work to find a solution that accommodates you , both professionally and personally. And it helps to remember that, as my mentor assured me, either way, you'll get your Ph.D."
https://openalex.org/W3106176215,"An economically valuable woody plant species tree bean ( Cajanus cajan (L . ) Millsp .) is predominantly cultivated in tropical and subtropical areas and is regarded as an important food legume (or pulse) crop that is facing serious sodium ion stress. NAM (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) has been implicated in abiotic and biotic stress tolerance in plants. However, the role of NAM in sodium ion stress tolerance has not been determined. In this study, the effect of NAM was investigated in the economically valuable woody plant species, challenged with stress at 40 mM sodium ion for 3 days. NAM-treated plants (200 μM) had significantly higher fresh weight, average root length, significantly reduced cell size, increased cell number, and increased cytoskeleton filaments in single cells. The expression pattern of one of 10 Tree bean Dynamic Balance Movement Related Protein (TbDMP), TbDMP was consistent with the sodium ion-stress alleviation by NAM. Using TbDMP as bait, Dynamic Balance Movement Related Kinase Protein (TbDBK) was determined to interact with TbDMP by screening the tree bean root cDNA library in yeast. Biochemical experiments showed that NAM enhanced the interaction between the two proteins which promoted resist sodium ion stress resistance. This study provides evidence of a pathway through which the skeleton participates in NAM signaling."
