https://openalex.org/W2039766969,"We report the molecular characterization of a mouse basic helix-loop-helix factor, designated MATH-1, structurally related to the product of the Drosophila proneural gene atonal. MATH-1 mRNA is first detected in the cranial ganglions and the dorsal part of the central nervous system on embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5). From E10.5 onward, prominent expression of MATH-1 continues in the dorsal part of the central nervous system but becomes restricted to the external granular layer of the cerebellum by E18 and is undetectable in the adult nervous system. MATH-1 activates E box-dependent transcription in collaboration with E47, but the activity is completely antagonized by the negative regulator of neurogenesis HES-1. These results suggest that MATH-1 may be a target of HES-1 and play a role in the differentiation of subsets of neural cells by activating E box-dependent transcription.

In mammals, the embryonic ectoderm gives rise to the neural tube and the neural crest, both of which are the origins of the nervous system (Hamilton et al., 1962Hamilton W.J. Boyd J.D. Mossman H.W. Human Embryology: Prenatal Development of Form and Function. W. Heffer and Sons Ltd., Cambridge, United Kingdom1962: 315-388Google Scholar). In the neural tube, which generates the central nervous system (CNS), 1The abbreviations used are:CNScentral nervous systemHLHhelix-loop-helixbHLHbasic HLHEembryonic dayPpostnatal dayPCRpolymerase chain reaction. mitotic germinal cells present in the ventricular zone next to the lumen determine their fate, migrate toward the outer zones, thus forming the mantle layer, and undergo terminal differentiation (Jacobson, 1991Jacobson M. Developmental Neurobiology. 3rd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1991Crossref Google Scholar). During this process, these differentiating cells may receive signals from the floor plate and/or the roof plate, which are the ventral and dorsal end point of the neural tube, respectively, and these cells gain ventral or dorsal phenotypes (Basler et al., 1993Basler K.

Thus, the ventral (basal plate) and dorsal parts (alar plate) of the mantle layer, the boundary of which is delineated by the sulcus limitans near the midpoint of the lateral wall of the neural tube, contain distinct populations of neural precursor cells. The underlying molecular mechanisms of these complex developmental processes are not yet well understood. central nervous system helix-loop-helix basic HLH embryonic day postnatal day polymerase chain reaction. One useful approach to dissect the genetic program of mammalian neurogenesis is the isolation of genes structurally related to those involved in Drosophila neurogenesis, which provides a powerful model system. Many genes involved in Drosophila neurogenesis have been genetically and molecularly characterized. Among them, helix-loop-helix (HLH) factors play an essential role in the early stages of neural development (Jan and Jan, 1993Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

Neurosci. 1991; 14: 399-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The HLH factors encoded by the Drosophila proneural genes, achaete-scute complex and daughterless, are positive regulators for sensory organ formation, whereas those encoded by hairy, Enhancer of split, and extramacrochaetae are negative regulators (Moscoso del Prado and Garcia-Bellido, 1984Moscoso del Prado J.

Trends Genet. 1992; 8: 202-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Mammalian factors homologous to these Drosophila regulators have recently been analyzed and have given us a useful clue for understanding the molecular nature of mammalian neurogenesis. For example, Mash1 (Johnson et al., 1990Johnson J.E. Birren S.J. Anderson D.J. Nature. 1990; 346: 858-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), a mammalian homologue of Drosophila achaete-scute complex, has been shown to be essential for the generation of olfactory and autonomic neurons (Guillemot et al., 1993Guillemot F. Lo L.-C. Johnson J.E. Auerbach A. Anderson D.J. Joyner A.L. Cell. 1993; 75: 463-476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). Mash1 forms a heterodimer with E12/E47 (Murre et al., 1989Murre C. McCaw P.S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 56: 777-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1860) Google Scholar), mammalian homologues of the Drosophila daughterless protein, and activates transcription by binding to the E box (CANNTG) (Johnson et al., 1992Johnson J.E. Birren S.J. Saito T. Anderson D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3596-3600Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In addition, HES-1, a mammalian homologue of Drosophila hairy and Enhancer of split, is expressed at high levels in the developing nervous system and represses Mash1-induced transcription (Sasai et al., 1992Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar; Takebayashi et al., 1994Takebayashi K. Sasai Y. Sakai Y. Watanabe T. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5150-5156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results show that HLH factors structurally related to the Drosophila factors are involved in developmental processes of mammalian neurogenesis. HES-1 is expressed at high levels in neural precursor cells, but its expression level decreases as neural differentiation proceeds (Sasai et al., 1992Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Persistent expression of HES-1 prevents neural differentiation in the CNS (Ishibashi et al., 1994Ishibashi M. Moriyoshi K. Sasai Y. Shiota K. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1799-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The mechanism of how HES-1 prevents neurogenesis is not known, but because HES-1 also inhibits myogenesis by antagonizing the HLH-type myogenic determination factor MyoD (Sasai et al., 1992Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to hypothesize that HES-1 may prevent neurogenesis by antagonizing HLH-type neural determination factors. Here, we have attempted to identify the HLH factors that are involved in mammalian neurogenesis. Whereas Mash1 acts as a neural determination factor in the peripheral nervous system (Guillemot et al., 1993Guillemot F. Lo L.-C. Johnson J.E. Auerbach A. Anderson D.J. Joyner A.L. Cell. 1993; 75: 463-476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar) and is expressed at high levels in the developing CNS (Lo et al., 1991Lo L.-C. Johnson J.E. Wuenschell C.W. Saito T. Anderson D.J. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1524-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar; Guillemot and Joyner, 1993Guillemot F. Joyner A.L. Mech. Dev. 1993; 42: 171-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), Mash1-deficient mice exhibited no apparent abnormalities in the CNS (Guillemot et al., 1993Guillemot F. Lo L.-C. Johnson J.E. Auerbach A. Anderson D.J. Joyner A.L. Cell. 1993; 75: 463-476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar), suggesting that other HLH factors may compensate or be necessary for CNS development. Recently, a novel Drosophila proneural gene, atonal, was molecularly characterized and shown to encode an HLH factor essential for the differentiation of the chordotonal organs (Jarman et al., 1993Jarman A.P. Grau Y. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cell. 1993; 73: 1307-1321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). These results prompted us to search for novel mammalian HLH factors structurally related to the product of atonal in order to investigate the molecular mechanisms of mammalian neurogenesis. We have found that a mammalian HLH factor structurally related to the product of Drosophila atonal is expressed in restricted regions of the developing nervous system, activates E box-dependent transcription, and is antagonized by the negative regulator HES-1. After reverse transcription with oligo(dT) priming of poly(A)+ RNA from the CNS of embryonic day 16 (E16) mouse embryos, the cDNA was subjected to 30-40 cycles of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) under standard conditions (Lee et al., 1988Lee C.C. Wu X. Gibbs R.A. Cook R.G. Muzny D.M. Caskey C.T. Science. 1988; 239: 1288-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar; Saiki et al., 1988Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf S. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13496) Google Scholar), except that the annealing temperature was lowered to 45°C during the first five cycles. The fully degenerate primers corresponding to the amino acid sequences NARER and TLQMA were synthesized for 5′- and 3′-primers, respectively. The third codon positions of 4-fold degeneracy were substituted by inosine. BamHI and EcoRI sites were introduced at the 5′ end of the 5′- and 3′-primers, respectively. Amplified fragments were subcloned into pBluescript and sequenced. Out of 24 clones sequenced, 3 encoded the MATH-1 sequence. The SacI- KpnI fragment containing the MATH-1 cDNA isolated from the subclones was used as a probe for screening the mouse genomic library (Stratagene). One positive clone was obtained, and the ∼2-kilobase pair HindIII- XhoI fragment of the positive clone was sequenced. In situ hybridization experiments were performed, essentially as described previously (Akazawa et al., 1992Akazawa C. Sasai Y. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21879-21885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, Akazawa et al., 1994Akazawa C. Shigemoto R. Bessho Y. Nakanishi S. Mizuno N. J. Comp. Neurol. 1994; 347: 150-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). 35S- or digoxigenin-labeled antisense RNA (∼1.5 kilobases) corresponding to the SphI- SacI fragment, which contained most of the MATH-1 coding region, was synthesized in vitro. The probes were hybridized to whole embryos or 10-μm cryostat sections. For Northern blot analysis, 5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA and 20 μg of total RNA were electrophoresed on a formamide/1.2% agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane. The filter was hybridized with the 32P-labeled SphI- SacI fragment at 42°C in 50% formamide, 5 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 50 m M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, 0.1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml heat-denatured salmon sperm DNA and washed at 65°C in 0.1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS. The proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and prepared as described previously (Kageyama et al., 1991Kageyama R. Sasai Y. Nakanishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15525-15531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA fragments of MATH-1 (amino acid residues 153-218) and E47 (residue 473 to the end) were subcloned into pGEMEX-1 and pMNT T7 expression plasmids, respectively. JM109 (DE3) cells transformed by the expression plasmids were grown, and the protein expression was induced by treatment of 1 m M isopropyl-1-thio-β- D-galactopyranoside. The cells were suspended in a solution of 30 m M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 m M EDTA, and 20% sucrose and were applied to an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The expressed proteins were eluted from the gel, treated in 6 M guanidine HCl for 20 min, and dialyzed against 0.1 M KCl/HM (20 m M HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 m M MgCl2, 2 m M dithiothreitol, and 17% (v/v) glycerol). The E box probes were prepared as follows. For the E1 probe, two oligonucleotides, 5′-GCCACCCTTGAACCAGGTGGACTTTTTGG-3′ and 5′-GCCAAAAAGTCCACCTGGTTCAAGGGTGG-3′, were annealed and labeled at both ends by filling with Klenow enzyme in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP. The E2 and E3 probes contained the same sequence as the E1 probe except for the 6-nucleotide E box element (underlined); the E2 and E3 probes contained CAAATG and CAGCTG, respectively, instead of the CAGGTG sequence. Reactions of the gel mobility shift assay were carried out as described previously (Sasai et al., 1992Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). For eukaryotic expression plasmids, the HindIII- XhoI fragment of the MATH-1 gene and full-length E47 and HES-1 cDNAs were cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector (pSV-CMV) containing the cytomegalovirus promoter and enhancer, as described previously (Sasai et al., 1992Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). The luciferase reporter plasmid pE7-βA-luc was made by inserting seven repeats of the E box (CAGGTG) into the XhoI site (−273 relative to the transcription initiation site) of the pβactin-luc. The luciferase reporter (0.5 μg) and the eukaryotic expression plasmids (0.5 μg each) were cotransfected into C3H10T1/2 cells using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method. The total amounts of DNA were adjusted to 2 μg with pSV-CMV. Two days after transfection, luciferase activities were determined as described previously (Ow et al., 1986Ow D.W. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. de Wet J.R. Helinski D.R. Howell S.H. Science. 1986; 234: 856-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). To isolate a novel HLH factor structurally related to the Drosophila proneural gene atonal, we amplified cDNAs from the CNS of mouse embryos by PCR using degenerate oligonucleotide primers (see “Experimental Procedures”). We obtained two closely related but distinct clones and further characterized one of them (designated MATH-1), the deduced amino acid sequence of which showed the higher homology to the atonal product. Using the PCR fragment as a probe, we screened a mouse genomic library. The ∼2-kilobase pair HindIII- XhoI fragment of the mouse MATH-1 genomic clone was sequenced (Fig. 1 A), and we found one open reading frame that contained the MATH-1 sequence. This open reading frame started from the methionine codon at nucleotide residue 195 (nucleotide residue 1 is the 5′-end of the HindIII site) and ended at the stop codon at 1248 (Fig. 1 B). Preceding the methionine codon at 195, there was an in-frame stop codon at 39 (Fig. 1 B). Reverse transcription-mediated PCR analysis using the primers upstream of the stop codon at 39 and downstream of the stop codon at 1248 showed that this region was transcribed without any introns (data not shown), suggesting that MATH-1 consists of 351 amino acid residues with the calculated molecular size of 37.9 kDa (Fig. 1 B). The feature of an intronless coding region is the same as that of the Mash1 genome, a gene related to the MATH-1 gene (Guillemot and Joyner, 1993Guillemot F. Joyner A.L. Mech. Dev. 1993; 42: 171-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). MATH-1 showed ∼70% identity to the atonal protein in the basic HLH (bHLH) domain (Fig. 2) but had no significant homology outside of this domain. MATH-1 also exhibited similarity to the bHLH domains of other factors such as Mash1 (49% identity) (Johnson et al., 1990Johnson J.E. Birren S.J. Anderson D.J. Nature. 1990; 346: 858-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), Mash2 (51% identity) (Johnson et al., 1990Johnson J.E. Birren S.J. Anderson D.J. Nature. 1990; 346: 858-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), and Xash3 (48% identity) (Zimmerman et al., 1993Zimmerman K. Shih J. Bars J. Collazo A. Anderson D.J. Development (Camb.). 1993; 119: 221-232PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Whereas the bHLH domain of atonal is located at its extreme carboxyl terminus (Jarman et al., 1993Jarman A.P. Grau Y. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cell. 1993; 73: 1307-1321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), that of MATH-1 is present in the middle of the protein, like Mash proteins. Another feature is that MATH-1 is rich in proline (36 out of 351 amino acid residues). These proline residues may be involved in protein-protein interaction (Mermod et al., 1989Mermod N. O'Neill E.A. Kelly T.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1989; 58: 741-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). MATH-1 is also rich in serines, which could be phosphorylated, in the carboxyl terminus (33% in the region between 325 and 351). For example, Ser-328 and Ser-331 are potential protein kinase C phosphorylation sites. Outside of this region, Ser-193 could be phosphorylated by protein kinase A. To determine the temporal and spatial distribution of MATH-1 mRNA, we performed in situ hybridization analysis. We did not detect any MATH-1 transcript in mouse embryos at E8.5 before the process of turning (data not shown). MATH-1 mRNA was first expressed at E9.5 in the cranial ganglions, such as the trigeminal ganglion, as well as in the dorsal wall of the neural tube (Fig. 3, a and b). The expression in the cranial ganglions was transient, becoming much weaker by E10.5 (Fig. 3 c). In contrast, the transcript was much more prominent in the CNS of E10.5 (Fig. 3, c and d) and E11.5 embryos (Fig. 3 e), where high levels of expression were observed throughout the dorsal part of the neural tube. On E12.5, MATH-1 expression was prominent in the alar plate of the hindbrain, which is located dorsolateral to the basal plate at this level (Fig. 4, a and b). High expression of the MATH-1 transcript was also present in the ventrally and dorsally migrating cells of the alar plate of the hindbrain (Fig. 4 b, arrows). The ventrally migrating cells shown are the bulbopontine extension (Fig. 4 b, thin arrows), which later forms the pontine nuclei rostrally and the olivary nuclear complex caudally. The dorsally migrating cells shown form the superficial cortex of the cerebellum (the external granular layer) (Fig. 4 b, thick arrows), which gives rise to the granule cells. In the developing spinal cord, MATH-1 expression remained at high levels on E12.5 and was restricted to the dorsal ventricular zone and alar plates with highest levels in the most dorsal region (Fig. 4, a and c). In contrast, MATH-1 expression became weaker in the dorsal part of the midbrain and was almost undetectable in the forebrain on E12.5 (Fig. 4 a).FIG. 4In situ hybridization analysis of E12.5 embryos. 35S-Labeled antisense MATH-1 RNA probe was hybridized to the frozen sections of E12.5 embryos. a, sagittal section.

However, by E18, MATH-1 expression had disappeared in the spinal cord and became restricted to the cerebellum (Fig. 5 b). On postnatal day 3 (P3), MATH-1 transcripts were observed in the external granular layer of the cerebellum (Fig. 6 A). From the external granular layer, granule cells migrate through the molecular layer and Purkinje cell layer to form the internal granular layer of the cerebellum. MATH-1 expression was only found in the external granular layer and not in the migrating granule cells or the mature granule cells of the internal granular layer (Fig. 6 B). As the external granular layer gradually disappeared during the postnatal periods, MATH-1 expression was also decreased (Fig. 6 A). On P28, MATH-1 mRNA was no longer detected in the nervous system (Fig. 6 A, d). Furthermore, the adult brain, including the cerebellum, produced no detectable levels of the MATH-1 transcript (Fig. 7 A). The finding that MATH-1 is expressed in subsets of differentiating neural cells but subsequently disappears suggests that MATH-1 may be involved in the developmental process of neurogenesis but may not be required for the maintenance of the terminally differentiated neurons.FIG. 6In situ hybridization analysis of postnatal brains.

In the adults, MATH-1 expression was evident in the gastrointestinal tract (Fig. 7 A). In situ hybridization analysis suggested that this MATH-1 expression was confined to the epithelial cells but not to the neural cells of the gastrointestinal tract (Fig. 7 B). Thus, MATH-1 appears to be expressed only in non-neural tissues in the adults, suggesting that MATH-1 may have different functions in early embryos and adults. To characterize the function of MATH-1, we next examined its DNA binding activity. The MATH-1 protein was expressed in E. coli and subjected to gel mobility shift analysis. It was previously shown that the Drosophila atonal product binds to several E box sequences as a heterodimer with the daughterless protein (Jarman et al., 1993Jarman A.P. Grau Y. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cell. 1993; 73: 1307-1321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). We thus tested several E box sequences for MATH-1 binding with or without E47, a mammalian homologue of the Drosophila daughterless product. As shown in Fig. 8, whereas E47 bound to these E box elements with different affinities (Fig. 8, lanes 3, 7, and 11), MATH-1 did not bind to any of the E box sequences tested (Fig. 8, lanes 2, 6, and 10 and data not shown). However, MATH-1 significantly activated the DNA binding of E47 (Fig. 8, lanes 4, 8, and 12). It is possible that this enhanced binding was the result of the formation of a heterodimer of MATH-1 and E47, in a manner similar to that of the atonal and daughterless proteins. Among the E box sequences tested, the mixture of MATH-1 and E47 bound to the CAGGTG sequence with the highest affinity (Fig. 8, lane 4), like the atonal and daughterless heterodimer (Jarman et al., 1993Jarman A.P. Grau Y. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cell. 1993; 73: 1307-1321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Thus, these results suggest that MATH-1 interacts with the E box elements as a heterodimer with E47. To characterize the transcriptional activity of MATH-1, we performed DNA-mediated gene transfer experiments using C3H10T1/2 cells. Previously, these cells have been used to show that the neuronal determination factor Mash1 and the muscle determination factor MyoD activate transcription from the E box-containing promoters (Benezra et al., 1990Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1804) Google Scholar; Johnson et al., 1992Johnson J.E. Birren S.J. Saito T. Anderson D.J.

Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). MATH-1 expression was directed under the control of the cytomegalovirus enhancer and promoter, and reporter plasmids were comprised of the luciferase gene under the control of the β-actin promoter with or without seven repeats of the E box element (CAGGTG). As shown in Fig. 9, MATH-1 significantly activated transcription from the promoter containing the E box element (Fig. 9, lane 3) but did not activate transcription without the E box (Fig. 9, lane 9). This E box-dependent trans-activation may result from either the formation of a homodimer of MATH-1 or a heterodimer of MATH-1 and the endogenous E12/E47, which is ubiquitously expressed. The latter hypothesis seems more likely, because MATH-1 alone did not interact with the E box sequence (Fig. 8). In addition, when E47 expression vector was cotransfected with MATH-1, MATH-1-induced trans-activation was enhanced (Fig. 9, lane 4), further suggesting that the heterodimer of MATH-1 and E12/E47 may be involved in this trans-activation. Recently, we have shown that persistent expression of HES-1 prevents neural differentiation in the CNS (Ishibashi et al., 1994Ishibashi M. Moriyoshi K. Sasai Y. Shiota K. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1799-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). To determine whether the activity of MATH-1 is regulated by HES-1, we co-expressed HES-1 with MATH-1 and E47. Cotransfection of the HES-1 vector resulted in complete inhibition of the MATH-1/E47-induced transcriptional activation (Fig. 9, lane 5), suggesting that the E box-dependent transcriptional activation of MATH-1 and E47 is negatively regulated by HES-1. In this study, we have described the molecular characterization of MATH-1, a novel mammalian factor that has a significant sequence homology in the bHLH domain to the product of the Drosophila proneural gene atonal. MATH-1 does not bind to the DNA template by itself, but, in collaboration with E47, it can interact with some of the E box elements. The sequence recognized by the mixture of MATH-1 and E47 with the highest affinities is the same as the one recognized by Atonal-Daughterless complex. Thus, MATH-1 is also similar in function to atonal. Furthermore, MATH-1 is specifically expressed in the developing nervous system, like atonal. These results raise the possibility that MATH-1 may have a similar function in neural differentiation to that of atonal. MATH-1 expression in the nervous system is transient and not detected in the adult nervous system, suggesting that MATH-1 may be involved in the differentiation process but not in the maintenance of subsets of the neural cells. In our preliminary experiments, we infected the neural precursor cells prepared from E10 mouse embryos with MATH-1-transducing retrovirus. However, we did not observe induction of neural differentiation. 2C. Akazawa, M. Ishibashi, C. Shimizu, S. Nakanishi, and R. Kageyama, unpublished data. Thus, MATH-1 may not be involved in the steps where the neural precursor cells determine their fate and undergo their initial differentiation. Rather, because MATH-1 expression seems specific to subsets of differentiating neurons, it is possible that MATH-1 may be required for the process where the neural cells undergo the neuronal type-specific maturation. Further studies, such as the identification of target genes for MATH-1, will be necessary to understand its exact functions during neurogenesis. It has recently been shown that diffusible factors from the notochord, floor plate, and roof plate play a major role in the determination of dorsal-ventral polarity within the neural tube (Basler et al., 1993Basler K. Edlund T. Jessell T.M. Yamada T. Cell. 1993; 73: 687-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar; Yamada et al., 1993Yamada T. Pfaff S.L. Edlund T. Jessell T.M. Cell. 1993; 73: 673-686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). These diffusible factors may induce transcription factors that activate ventral- or dorsal-specific genes. For example, Sonic hedgehog secreted from the notochord induces the expression of the transcription factor HNF-3β in the floor plate, which may then activate ventral-specific genes and repress the dorsal-specific genes (Echelard et al., 1993Echelard Y.

Cell. 1994; 76: 103-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). It is possible that diffusible factors from the roof plate may induce the expression of MATH-1, which may then activate dorsal-specific gene expression and therefore regulate the development of dorsal neurons. In the adult, MATH-1 is expressed in the epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract but not in the neural cells. Northern blot analysis demonstrated exactly the same size of MATH-1 transcript in the adult and embryonal tissues. Furthermore, we did not detect any additional MATH-1 products in the reverse transcriptase-mediated PCR experiments when the adult and embryonal RNAs were used (data not shown). Thus, a single MATH-1 protein may be expressed in both embryos and adults, although the possibility that different molecules could be produced by alternative splicing has not yet been excluded. Accumulating evidence suggests that, like myogenesis, mammalian neurogenesis is controlled by multiple HLH factors (Johnson et al., 1990Johnson J.E. Birren S.J. Anderson D.J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 1342-1349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Mash1 is expressed in the developing nervous system and is essential for peripheral nervous system development (Guillemot et al., 1993Guillemot F. Lo L.-C. Johnson J.E. Auerbach A. Anderson D.J. Joyner A.L. Cell. 1993; 75: 463-476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). Although Mash1 is present at high levels in the developing CNS, null mutation of this factor does not cause any apparent abnormalities in the CNS (Guillemot et al., 1993Guillemot F. Lo L.-C. Johnson J.E. Auerbach A. Anderson D.J. Joyner A.L. Cell. 1993; 75: 463-476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that other factors may compensate, as in the case of the muscle determination factors MyoD and Myf-5; whereas null mutation of MyoD or Myf-5 gives rise to apparently normal skeletal muscles, lack of both factors shows a complete absence of skeletal muscles (Rudnicki et al., 1992Rudnicki M.A. Braun T. Hinuma S. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 71: 383-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar; Braun et al., 1992Braun T. Rudnicki M.A. Arnold H.-H. Jaenisch R.

Cell. 1993; 75: 1351-1359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). Because MATH-1 and Mash1 seem co-expressed, at least in some regions of the developing nervous system, and have similar transcriptional activity (both activate transcription from E box-containing promoters), MATH-1 may substitute for Mash1 in the development of some regions of the nervous system. Further studies, such as an analysis of the null mutation of MATH-1, will clarify this problem. Equally important is that neurogenesis may be negatively regulated by multiple HLH factors. HES-1 acts as a transcriptional repressor and is down-regulated as neural differentiation proceeds (Sasai et al., 1992Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Forced expression of HES-1 prevents mammalian neurogenesis in the CNS (Ishibashi et al., 1994Ishibashi M. Moriyoshi K. Sasai Y. Shiota K. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1799-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the two activators MATH-1 and Mash1 are negatively regulated by HES-1 (this study and Sasai et al., 1992Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). We thus speculate that HES-1 prevents neurogenesis by negatively regulating positive factors such as MATH-1 and Mash1. Another example concerns Id-1 and Id-2, negative regulators of myogenesis. They are also expressed at high levels in the developing nervous system (Duncan et al., 1992Duncan M. DiCicco-Bloom E.M. Xiang X. Benezra R. Chada K. Dev. Biol. 1992; 154: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar; Neuman et al., 1993Neuman T. Keen A. Zuber M.X. Kristjansson G.I. Gruss P. Nornes H.O. Dev. Biol. 1993; 160: 186-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), suggesting that these factors also participate in the negative regulation of neurogenesis. Thus, the balance between multiple positive and negative regulators may play an important role in mammalian neurogenesis, as in the Drosophila system. Transcription factors that do not belong to the HLH family are also required for proper development of the nervous system. For example, the paired box Pax factors play an essential role in neural development (Gruss and Walther, 1992Gruss P. Walther C. Cell. 1992; 69: 719-722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). In particular, the relationship between MATH-1 and Pax-3 may be interesting, because Pax-3 is produced in the dorsal half of the neural tube (Goulding et al., 1991Goulding M.D. Chalepakis G. Deutsch U. Erselius J.R. Gruss P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1135-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar) and therefore co-expressed with MATH-1. Mutation of Pax-3 (splotch) affects development of the neural tube, resulting in spina bifida and exencephaly (Epstein et al., 1991Epstein D.J. Vekemans M. Gros P. Cell. 1991; 67: 767-774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Pax-3 expression occurs just prior to closure of the neural tube, before MATH-1 is expressed. Thus, Pax-3 may regulate neurogenesis by activating MATH-1 expression, or Pax-3 and MATH-1 may cooperatively activate neural-specific genes. Further studies of the functions and relationship of these factors will lead to an understanding of the complex mechanisms of mammalian neurogenesis. We thank Dr. L. J.

In addition, others have suggested that IL-4R and IL-13R may share a common component that appears to function in signal transduction (4Zurawski S.M. Vega Jr., F. Huyghe B. Zurawski G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2663-2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar).We have previously demonstrated that human renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cells express high affinity IL-4R (19Obiri N.I. Hillman G.G. Haas G.P. Sud S. Puri R.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Since many of the observed effects of IL-13 are similar to those of IL-4, we have examined RCC cells for the expression of IL-13R. We demonstrate that human RCC cells express large numbers of functional IL-13R and that IL-4 and IL-13 interact with each other's receptors. We provide evidence that IL-13R and IL-4R on RCC cells are composed of different subunits and that IL-13R is mainly composed of a single protein similar in size to the smaller of the two IL-4R subunits. The IL-13R protein does not cross-react with anti-γcor anti-IL-4R antibodies. Similarly, to our surprise, the smaller of the two IL-4R proteins does not react with anti-γcantibody. These results suggest that γcchain is not associated with IL-13R or IL-4R on human RCC cells and further suggest that IL-13R is a monomeric or dimeric protein, which itself may be a novel subunit of IL-4R.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCytokines and ReagentsRecombinant human IL-13 (2Minty A.

For some experiments, we used recombinant human IL-13 expressed in Escherichia coli and produced by one of us (W. D.). Prior to use, we compared IL-13 prepared from the two sources and found that they were identical in biological activity (i.e. support of TF-1 cell proliferation) as well as in their ability to displace 125I-IL-13 from the cell surface. Recombinant human IL-4 was provided by Paul Trotta (Schering-Plough Research Institute, Kenilworth, NJ). A polyclonal rabbit antibody to the high affinity human IL-4R (P7) was a kind gift from Immunex Corporation (Seattle, WA).

The bound ligand was cross-linked to its receptor with disuccinimidyl suberate (Pierce) at a final concentration of 2 m M for 30 min. Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 1 m M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.02 m M leupeptin, 5.0 μM trypsin inhibitor, 10 m M benzamidine HCl, 1 m M phenanthroline iodoacetamide, 50 m M aminocaproic acid, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. The cell lysates were cleared by boiling in sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol and analyzed by electrophoresis through 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was subsequently dried and autoradiographed. In some experiments, the receptor-ligand complex was immunoprecipitated from the lysate overnight at 4°C by incubating with protein A-Sepharose beads that had been preincubated with P7 anti-human IL-4R or anti-γcantibody and analyzed as above.Flow Cytometric AnalysisRCC cells were cultured with IL-13 (10 ng/ml) over a 48-h period, washed, and incubated at 4°C for 60 min with anti-human ICAM-1 antibody (84H10). Control cells were incubated in staining buffer alone or with isotype control (IgG1) antibody. Cells were then washed and stained for 60 min with a secondary antibody consisting of F(ab′)2fragment of mouse IgG conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate. After washing, cells were analyzed on FACScan/C32 equipment (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) using a LYSIS II program. Fluorescence intensity was expressed as mean channel number on a 256-channel/104log scale.Northern Blot AnalysisEqual amounts of total RNA were examined by Northern blot analysis (19Obiri N.I.

The membrane was probed with 32P-labeled cDNA for γcor ICAM-1 at 42°C for 18 h. In some experiments, the membrane was stripped and probed with a cDNA probe for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONExpression of IL-13RFour human RCC lines (WS-RCC, HL-RCC, PM-RCC, and MA-RCC) that were examined bound 125I-IL-13 specifically, and the density of IL-13R varied from 2100 sites/cell in WS-RCC cells to 150,000 sites/cell in HL-RCC cells (Fig. 1 and Table I): Scatchard analyses (23Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17759) Google Scholar) revealed that only one affinity class of receptors was expressed on each cell line. The binding affinities (Kd) ranged between 100 p M and 400 p M in three RCC cell lines, while HL-RCC cells expressed lower affinity receptors (Kd ≈ 3 n M).Table I:Expression of IL-13R on human cellsTable I:Expression of IL-13R on human cellsAlthough IL-13 responsiveness has previously been reported in human monocytes, B cells, and premyeloid (TF-1) cells (2Minty A.

Our results show that freshly isolated human monocytes, Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cell line, and TF-1 cell line express very few IL-13 binding sites (100-300 binding sites/cell) compared with human RCC cells (Table I). On the other hand, no binding of 125I-IL-13 was observed on H9 T cells, LAK cells, and resting or phytohemagglutinin-activated peripheral blood lymphocyte. This is compatible with the fact that IL-13 responsiveness has not been observed in T lymphocytes (9Punnonen J. Aversa G. Cocks B.G. Mckenzie A.N.J. Menon S.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2663-2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 24Aversa G. Punnonen J. Cocks B.G. de Waal Malefyt R. Vega Jr., F. Zurawski S.M. Zurawski G. de Vries J.E. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 2213-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). To directly address these possibilities, we first performed radioligand binding experiments on HL-RCC and WS-RCC cells using 125I-IL-4 or 125I-IL-13 in the presence or absence of excess of either cytokine. Our results (Fig. 2) show that unlabeled IL-4 more efficiently inhibited 125I-IL-4 from binding to RCC cells (84 and 72% displacement of total binding in WS-RCC and HL-RCC, respectively) than IL-13, which also displaced 125I-IL-4 binding to these cells (61% of total binding in WS-RCC and 51% in HL-RCC) under similar conditions. On the other hand, while 125I-IL-13 binding was effectively displaced by IL-13 (about 85% of the total in both cell types), it was only minimally displaced by IL-4 (12% of total displacement in WS-RCC and 7% in HL-RCC). These results indicate that IL-4 and IL-13 both interact with each other's receptors; however, the interaction is not identical, since IL-4 inhibition of 125I-IL-13 binding was weak and IL-13 inhibition of 125I-IL-4 binding was not complete. Our results agree with previous observations in which IL-13 was found to compete with IL-4 binding on TF-1 cells (4Zurawski S.M. Vega Jr., F. Huyghe B. Zurawski G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2663-2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). However, in that report the converse experiment was not done. Here we provide results showing that even though IL-13 competed for IL-4 binding, IL-4 did not compete for IL-13 binding.FIG. 2Competition of 125I-IL-4 or 125I-IL-13 binding. RCC cells (1 × 106) were incubated with 125I-IL-4 (0.64 n M) or 125I-IL-13 (0.64 n M) with or without excess IL-4 (128 n M) or IL-13 (128 n M). Competition for radioligand binding is expressed as percentage of total binding. Total 125I-IL-4 bound to two RCC cell cultures was 17,832 ± 1099 and 14,631 ± 780 cpm ± S.D. for HL-RCC and WS-RCC, respectively, and total binding of 125I-IL-13 was 49,945 ± 3164 and 8119 ± 122 cpm ± S.D. to HL-RCC and WS-RCC cells, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We also investigated whether IL-13 competes for the IL-4 binding on lymphoid MLA 144 cells or RAJI cell lines. These cells were incubated with radiolabeled IL-4 with or without excess unlabeled IL-4 or IL-13. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, 125I-IL-4 bound to MLA 144 and RAJI cells, and excess unlabeled IL-4 effectively displaced radiolabeled IL-4, while excess IL-13 could not compete this binding. This observation is at variance to that seen with RCC cells in which IL-13 competed for IL-4 binding. The inability of IL-13 to compete for 125I-IL-4 binding to MLA 144 is consistent with our observation that IL-13 did not bind to peripheral blood T (or MLA 144) cells. However, the inability of IL-13 to compete for IL-4 binding on the RAJI (B cell lineage) cell line is not clear. As discussed below, these cells express common γ chain, and it is possible that common γ chain interferes with the binding of IL-13. Studies are under way to address this point.FIG. 3Lack of competition of 125I-IL-4 binding by IL-13 on MLA 144 and RAJI cells. MLA 144 cells (A) or RAJI (Burkitt's lymphoma) cells (B) were incubated with 0.5 n M of 125I-IL-4 in the absence or presence of 200-fold molar excess (RAJI) or various concentrations (up to 1000-fold molar excess) of IL-13 (MLA 144). Total 125I-IL-4 bound was 4569 ± 36 cpm on MLA 144 cells and 9975 ± 283 cpm on RAJI cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Subunit Structure of IL-13R and IL-4RWe next investigated the subunit structure of IL-13R on RCC cells by cross-linking studies. Our results indicate that 125I-IL-13 cross-linked to one major protein on all four RCC cells and that the complex migrated as a single broad band ranging between 68 and 80 kDa (Fig. 4, A and B). A single band was also observed on human premyeloid TF-1.J61 cells (Fig. 4 B) only after much longer exposure of the gel. After subtracting the molecular mass of IL-13 (12 kDa), the size of the IL-13 binding protein was estimated at 56-68 kDa. The 125I-IL-13 cross-linked band was not observed when the cross-linking was performed in the presence of a 200-fold molar excess of IL-13 (Fig. 4, A, lanes 2 for each tumor cell line, and B, lane 2). In addition to the major band, a faint band of approximately 45 kDa was also observed in HL-RCC and PM-RCC but not on MA-RCC cells (Fig. 4 A). This band appeared to be specifically associated with IL-13R, because unlabeled IL-13 competed for the binding of 125I-IL-13. This band could represent an IL-13R-associated protein or a proteolytic fragment of the larger band. In contrast to the displacement of 125I-IL-13 binding by unlabeled IL-13 (Fig. 2), an excess of unlabeled IL-4 did not prevent the appearance of IL-13R band in RCC cell lines (Fig. 4 A, lanes 3 for each tumor). IL-13 on the other hand competed for 125I-IL-4 binding to both major proteins on WS-RCC cells (Fig. 4 C, lane 3). It is of interest that 125I-IL-13 cross-linked protein was slightly larger in size in TF-1.J61, WS-RCC, PM-RCC, and HL-RCC cell lines compared with that seen in MA-RCC (Figs. 4, A and B, and 5, A and B). Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation or phosphorylation, may account for this difference.FIG. 4SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of 125I-IL-13˙IL-13R or 125I-IL-4˙IL-4R complexes. Five million RCC cells (A) or nine million TF1.J61 cells (B) were labeled with 125I-IL-13 in the absence or presence of 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled IL-13 or IL-4. MA-RCC, HL-RCC, and PM-RCC cells were incubated with 125I-IL-13 alone (A, lane 1 of each tumor type) or in the presence of excess IL-13 (A, lane 2 of each tumor type, or B, lane 2) or IL-4 (A, lane 3 of each tumor type). WS-RCC cells were incubated with 1 n M125I-IL-4 alone (C, lane 1) or in the presence of excess IL-4 (C, lane 2) or IL-13 (C, lane 3).

Matrix. 1989; 9: 468-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 14Hedbom E. Heineg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6898-6905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in vitro studies suggested a preferential binding of decorin to type VI collagen (15Bidanset D.J. Guidry C. Rosenberg L.C. Choi H.U. Timpl R. Hook M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5250-5256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, mediating molecules like type VI collagen are not required to interpret the data on the interaction between decorin and fibrillar collagens (9Hedbom E. Heineg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27307-27312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to collagen binding, the core protein of decorin interacts with other components of the extracellular matrix (16Schmidt G. Robenek H. Harrach B. Glössl J. Nolte V. Hörmann H. Richter H.

Nature. 1990; 346: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar), and with a receptor required for its endocytosis (20Glössl J. Schubert-Prinz R. Gregory J.D. Damle S.P. von Figura K. Kresse H. Biochem. J. 1983; 215: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Decorin belongs to a proteoglycan family that is characterized by core proteins of about 40 kDa that contain 10-12 homologous, leucine-rich repeats of about 25 amino acids in their central sequence and that have disulfide loops located at conserved positions near the N and C termini (21Krusius T. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7683-7687Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 22Day A.A. Ramis C.I. Fisher L.W. Gehron Robey P. Termine J.D. Young M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 9861-9876Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The single glycosaminoglycan chain of decorin is linked with serine 4 of the mature core protein (23Chopra R.K. Pearson C.H. Pringle G.A. Fackre D.S. Scott P.G. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 277-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Previously, it had been attempted to characterize the collagen-binding domain of decorin in detail. Chemical and enzymatic degradation studies indicated that the 17-amino acid N-terminal peptide including the glycosaminoglycan chain was not required for the interaction of the proteoglycan with a collagen matrix (24Vogel K.G. Koob T.J. Fisher L.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 148: 658-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), but the inhibition of fibrillogenesis was abolished by a disulfide bond reduction (25Scott P.G. Winterbottom N. Dodd C.M. Edwards E. Pearson C.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 138: 1348-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Further studies came to the conclusion that neither the N-terminal half nor the central leucine-rich repeats of the core protein can, by itself, interact fully with fibrillar collagen (26Pogány G. Vogel K.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the present study we will describe that at least two domains of decorin core protein are able to bind to fibrillar collagen and that binding does not necessarily correlate with an inhibition of fibrillogenesis. Reference (wild-type) decorin was purified to about 95% purity from the secretions of cultured human skin fibroblasts as described (27Hausser H. Hoppe W. Rauch U. Kresse H. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, the preparation included sequential anion exchange chromatographies in the presence of protease inhibitors on a DEAE-Trisacryl M column (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) and on a Bio-Gel TSK DEAE-5 PW high pressure liquid chromatography column (Bio-Rad). Use of urea and of other denaturing agents was avoided. [35S]Sulfate-labeled decorin was prepared analogously after incubating the cells for 72 h in the presence of 1.48 MBq/ml [35S]sulfate (carrier-free) (Amersham-Buchler, Braunschweig, Germany) and 4% (v/v) fetal calf serum that had been dialyzed against 0.15 M NaCl. Clone D6, which contains the coding region of human decorin core protein, has been described previously (28Beavan L.A. Quentin-Hoffmann E. Schönherr E. Snigula F. Leroy J.G. Kresse H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9856-9862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the context of the present investigation, it is noteworthy that this clone contains a HpaI site in the untranslated downstream region (position 1383) that had not been described in the original publication of decorin cDNA (21Krusius T. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7683-7687Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) but has been found more recently (29Danielson K.G. Fazzio A. Cohen I. Cannizzaro L.A. Eichstetter I. Iozzo R.V. Genomics. 1993; 15: 146-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The clone was used to prepare the following recombinant peptides (see Table I and Fig. 1). P15-329 was cloned into the BamHI/ EcoRI restriction site of the expression vector pRSET A (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). P15-125 was obtained as follows. An EcoRI/ AlwNI fragment of the cDNA was made blunt ended at the AlwNI site and cloned into the EcoRI/ BamHI site of pGEM-4Z (Promega, Heidelberg), which was propagated in Escherichia coli strain DH5α. This procedure generated a stop codon 3′ of leucine 125. The plasmid was digested with BstUI and HindIII and subcloned into the BamHI/ HindIII site of pRSET A. To obtain the P15-183 construct, the cDNA was treated with EcoRI and BsmI, and additionally with HpaI, to distinguish between the two EcoRI sites 5′ and 3′ of the BsmI site. The EcoRI/ BsmI fragment was cloned into the EcoRI/ KpnI site of pGEM-4Z, thus generating the codons for Arg-Tyr-Pro-Gly-Ile-Leu-Stop 3′ of threonine 183, and subcloned into pRSET A as described for P15-125. A cDNA for P33-160 was obtained by digesting the cDNA with EcoRI/ DdeI. Further subcloning was as described for P15-125 except that BstUI was replaced by TaqI for digestion of the pGEM-4Z cloning intermediate. P125-230 was obtained as follows. A HincII digest of the cDNA was cloned into the BamHI site of pGEM-4Z. The orientation of the insert was determined with HinfI before the vector was digested with AlwNI/ HindIII. This fragment was then ligated into the BamHI/ HindIII site of pRSET C (Invitrogen), thereby creating a leucine and a stop codon 3′ of the valine 230 codon. P154-329 was obtained analogously like P15-329, except that the cDNA was treated with BanI/ EcoRI and subcloned into pRSET B (Invitrogen). For the generation of P185-329 a BsmI/ EcoRI fragment of the cDNA was treated with AlwNI for removal of the 5′ sequence and subcloned into pRSET A as in the case of P15-329.Table I:Recombinant decorin peptidesFIG. 1Schematic structure of mature human decorin core protein and restriction sites of decorin cDNA.

The plasmids were used to express recombinant proteins in E. coli strain INVαF′ (Invitrogen) as described (30Schönherr E. Witsch-Prehm P. Harrach B. Robenek H. Rauterberg J. Kresse H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2776-2783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Bacteria were then collected and treated with 10 ml of 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, 0.5 M NaCl, and 20 m M sodium phosphate, pH 7.8/100 ml of original suspension. For purification, 2 ml of a nickel-nitriloacetic acid agarose gel (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) were put into a spin column and equilibrated with 8 M urea and 0.5 M NaCl in 20 m M sodium phosphate, pH 7.8 (buffer A). Solubilized proteins were loaded onto the column by gravity in two 5-ml portions. The column was washed by centrifugation (1000 × gav) using 7-ml portions of buffer A until the A280 was below 0.01. Nine washing steps were usually required. Further washings were by gravity using 8 M urea, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.05% Tween 80 (Sigma) in 20 m M sodium phosphate, pH 6.5 (buffer B) until the A280 was below 0.01 (about 50 ml). Elution was achieved by applying 6 × 1 ml of 8 M urea, 0.5 M NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 80 in 20 m M sodium phosphate, pH 4.0. The four fractions with the highest A280were pooled, diluted with buffer B to an A280 of about 0.03, made 0.05% with BSA 1The abbreviations used are:BSAbovine serum albuminPBSphosphate-buffered saline. , and dialyzed for 48 h at 4°C against 20 times the sample volume of 1 M urea, 2 m M glutathione (reduced), 0.02 m M glutathione (oxidized), 0.005% Tween 80 in 50 m M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. After dialysis overnight against 0.2 × PBS, insoluble proteins were removed by centrifugation, and 1.5-ml aliquots of the supernatant were lyophilized and reconstituted with 300 μl of H2O by brief sonication. bovine serum albumin phosphate-buffered saline. When indicated, much smaller quantities of BSA were added to the renaturing solution. After dialysis, urea was added to a final concentration of 8 M, and the purification and renaturation protocol was repeated, but this time in the presence of the standard concentration of BSA. Radioactively labeled proteins were obtained after incubation with [35S]sulfate exactly as described (30Schönherr E. Witsch-Prehm P. Harrach B. Robenek H. Rauterberg J. Kresse H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2776-2783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Acid-soluble type I collagen from calf skin (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) was dissolved in 17 m M acetic acid (4.4 mg/ml), neutralized by adding 2 volumes of 18 m M sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 0.14 M NaCl (PBS), and incubated for 30 min at 37°C. The fibrils formed were collected by centrifugation, suspended in 300 μl of 5% (w/v) BSA in PBS/mg of collagen, and dispersed by ultrasonication. In most experiments, recombinant peptides were tested in a competition assay. Wild-type [35S]sulfate-labeled decorin (about 8,000 cpm) was mixed with 0.17 mg of reconstituted collagen fibrils and the respective peptides in PBS to give a final volume of 600 μl and a final concentration of 0.875% BSA. Controls were incubated without collagen. After 5 h at 37°C under constant mixing, the pellet was collected by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 10 min) and washed 3 times with PBS. Bound decorin was quantitated after solubilizing the fibrils with 50 μl of 1 M NaOH. All assays were done in duplicate or triplicate. 35S-Labeled recombinant peptides were assayed analogously. Their quantity was estimated from the protein content of larger non-radioactive samples prepared in parallel. Collagen was prepared from bovine tendon, and collagen fibrillogenesis was monitored spectrophotometrically exactly as described (10Vogel K.G. Paulsson M. Heineg D. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). Appropriate mixtures of collagen (100 μg) and either decorin or decorin peptides in a final volume of 1 ml were made on ice and warmed up to 37°C. The turbidity at 400 nm was measured in 5-min intervals. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting was done as described earlier (27Hausser H. Hoppe W. Rauch U. Kresse H. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The polyclonal rabbit antiserum against deglycosylated human decorin (31Witsch-Prehm P. Miehlke R. Kresse H. Arthritis Rheum. 1992; 35: 1042-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) was found to react with all recombinant peptides used in this study, but the number of reactive epitopes of the individual peptides was not determined. For the quantification of recombinant proteins, standard concentrations of BSA (1-30 μg) and samples were separated on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. They were stained with 0.1% Amido Black 10B in methanol/acetic acid/H2O (9/2/9, v/v/v) and destained in methanol/acetic acid/H2O (45/1/4, v/v/v). Stained bands were cut out, eluted with 300 μl of 25 m M NaOH and 0.04 m M EDTA in 50% aqueous ethanol, and quantitated at 630 nm. A variety of recombinant decorin peptides (Table I) were expressed as fusion proteins in E. coli strain INVαF′. These constructs allowed an easy preparation to more than 95% purity by a single chromatographic step as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the peptides prepared in the absence of BSA. Previous attempts to purify peptides directly expressed in bacteria had failed. Proteins solubilized with 8 M urea could not be purified in a single step by chromatography on either DEAE- or CM-Trisacryl. Chromatography of proteins solubilized with 4 M guanidine hydrochloride on octyl-Sepharose (32Choi H.U. Johnson T.L. Pal S. Tang L.-H. Rosenberg L. Neame P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2876-2884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was hampered by low recovery. Purification of P15-329 from 100 ml of bacteria typically yielded 5 mg of peptide. After renaturation in the presence of BSA, about 800 μg of peptide (with a range of 500-1400 μg in seven separate purifications) were obtained in soluble form. Their quantity was determined after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2), electroblotting, and staining of the respective bands with Amido Black. Because the strong denaturing agent 4 M guanidine hydrochloride had to be used to extract the peptide from inclusion bodies, the following criteria for successful renaturation were used. P15-329 becomes insoluble after reduction and alkylation, indicating that solubility depends on the formation of disulfide bonds. As functional tests, the inhibition of binding of wild-type decorin to type I collagen fibrils and to the endocytosis receptor (not shown) was employed. Successful renaturation required the presence of sufficient quantities of BSA (Fig. 3). When only 10 μg/ml BSA were included in the renaturing buffer, the resulting product failed to compete with wild-type decorin for binding to collagen fibrils. However, refolding to an active state occurred even after further treatment with 8 M urea provided that sufficient quantities of BSA were present during renaturation. BSA was therefore considered to act as a chaperone and to enable the proper folding of P15-329. The experiment also demonstrates that solubility is not a sufficient criterion for the functionality of P15-329. It had recently been reported that decorin core protein, functionally active with respect to transforming growth factor-β binding, could be obtained as a fusion protein with E. coli maltose-binding protein (33Hildebrand A. Romars M. Rasmussen L.M. Heineg D. Twardzik D.R. Border W.A. Ruoslahti E. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). Use of this strategy, however, yields a fusion protein twice the size of the wild-type core protein.FIG. 3Requirement of BSA for renaturation of recombinant decorin peptide. After purification, P15-329 was carried through the renaturation procedure in the presence of 10 μg of BSA/ml. 40 μg of the peptides were used in experiment A as a competitor of [35S]sulfatelabeled wild-type decorin (4,000 cpm). In the absence of competitor, 41.3 ± 1.2% of the ligand bound to collagen. In experiment B the same material as in experiment A was treated with 8 M urea in buffer B and renatured in the presence of 500 μg of BSA/ml prior to collagen binding, precisely as in experiment A. The horizontal bars indicate the standard deviation of three parallel experiments taken separately through the whole procedure and assayed in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A quantitative comparison between wild-type decorin and P15-329 for the inhibition of binding of [35S]sulfate-labeled decorin to collagen indicated that the doses required for half-maximal inhibition (IC50) were of the same order of magnitude, although the doses required for the recombinant peptide were always somewhat higher (Fig. 4). In seven different preparations the IC50 of P15-329 was minimally 1.2-fold and maximally 3.5-fold higher than that of wild-type decorin. The specific competition between P15-329 and decorin for collagen binding could also be shown by Western blotting and immune staining instead of using a radioactive ligand. It is shown in Fig. 5 that P15-329 does not precipitate during incubation in the absence of collagen fibrils and that there is indeed competition between the two ligands for binding. In a further set of experiments the influence of the recombinant peptide and of decorin on the kinetics of fibril formation was studied. During fibrillogenesis, decorin has to interact reversibly with the growing fibrils, and there should be no steady state in the quantity of bound decorin. It is seen in Fig. 6 A that P15-329 is equally as efficient as decorin in reducing the turbidity of the fibril suspension, which suggests a similar effect of decorin and P15-329 on the diameter reduction of the collagen fibrils. A prolonged lag phase was also consistently observed in the presence of P15-329. The procedure described above was used to renature a variety of recombinant decorin peptides that were designed to cover several N- and C-terminal regions as well as a central region (Fig. 1). One of the peptides, P33-160, was anticipated to be biologically inactive and to be employable as a negative control because it contained a single cysteine residue only. With the exception of P125-230, which covered the central cysteine-free region, all other peptides contained a paired number of cysteine residues and were anticipated to be capable of forming disulfide bridges. In support of this expectation, these peptides formed insoluble complexes upon reduction and alkylation. When the different peptides were used in a competition assay, the lowest IC50 levels were obtained for the “full-length” peptide, P15-329, and for P15-183, which contains the first six N-terminally located leucine-rich repeats in addition to the N-terminal cysteine-rich region (Table II and Fig. 7). A shortened N-terminal peptide, P15-125, required at least three times higher doses for half-maximal inhibition (three independent experiments). Unexpectedly, two C-terminally located peptides, P154-329 and P185-329, containing 5 and 6 leucine-rich repeats, respectively, were also able to interfere with collagen binding of wild-type decorin, but the centrally located peptide P125-230 was not. Nevertheless, this peptide exhibited functional activity because it was well suited in interfering with the endocytosis of decorin. 2E. Schönherr, H. Hausser, L. Beavan, and H. Kresse, unpublished results.

The interference with decorin binding to collagen by two non-overlapping recombinant peptides prompted us to prepare P15-183 and P185-329 in a radioactively labeled form for use in competition assays. Fig. 8 shows very clearly that the binding of 35S-labeled P185-329 to collagen fibrils can be best inhibited by the peptide itself and by the full-length peptide P15-329. Very minor inhibition only could be achieved by P15-183. The situation is less clear for the inhibition of binding of 35S-labeled P15-183. Although the full-length peptide and P15-183 itself were the best competitors, P185-329 and, to a lesser extent, P125-230 were also able to interfere with binding. This could indicate that the latter two peptides carry a domain interacting with the P15-183 binding site, albeit with lower affinity. Alternatively, the binding of P185-329 affects, by steric hindrance, the binding of P15-183 to an adjacent site, whereas the converse does not occur. Steric hindrance is also a possible explanation for the observation that P15-183 inhibited the binding of native decorin to collagen, whereas the same peptide was not an inhibitor of the interaction between P185-329 and collagen. In the presence of P15-183, an interaction of native decorin via its C-terminal collagen-binding domain should be expected in the absence of steric hindrance. The radioactively labeled recombinant peptides were used for the determination of dissociation constants. The Kd value of P15-329 was 3 × 10−10 mol/liter, an order of magnitude smaller than the Kd values for both P15-183 and P185-329 (Fig. 9). Several of the recombinant decorin peptides were tested for their influence on collagen fibrillogenesis. It is shown in Fig. 6 B that P15-183 was approximately as efficient as P15-329 and wild-type decorin in inhibiting the formation of fibrils. The collagen-binding peptide P185-329, however, was ineffective, although all recombinant peptides had an influence on the length of the lag phase preceding fibrillogenesis. It is also noteworthy that P15-125 is well suited for interfering with fibril formation, although its ability to compete with decorin for collagen binding is only moderate. These general findings were corroborated by the analysis of at least two different peptide preparations. Considering the previous finding that the reduction of disulfide bonds of decorin abolishes its capability to inhibit fibrillogenesis (25Scott P.G. Winterbottom N. Dodd C.M. Edwards E. Pearson C.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 138: 1348-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that the N-terminal region of decorin, which contains 4 cysteine residues and is present in P15-183 and in P15-125, is of special importance for this function. In this study, recombinant decorin core protein fragments were analyzed for their interaction with type I collagen. All the peptides had to be extracted from inclusion bodies by a strong denaturing agent and had to be renatured. This was possible only when BSA was present as a chaperone protein during the renaturation process. The renatured protein P15-329 exhibited a similar, albeit quantitatively not exactly the same, collagen binding activity as wild-type decorin. A strong argument for the general success of the renaturing procedure is the observation that a protein that did not bind to collagen could be converted to a species capable of interacting with collagen, even after additional denaturation with urea, provided that the appropriate conditions for renaturation were employed. The presence of large quantities of BSA, however, precluded the use of physicochemical methods like measurements of CD spectra for an evaluation of the renaturation process. CD spectra of N-glycan-free decorin showed a broad minimum around 212 nm in contrast to the sharper minimum seen for intact decorin (34Scott P.G. Dodd C.M. Connect. Tissue Res. 1990; 24: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These data were explained as an indication of aggregate formation, but it was also demonstrated that oligosaccharide-free decorin retained its ability to bind to collagen fibrils and to retard collagen fibrillogenesis in vitro. An inherent difficulty of the use of protein fragments is the fact that negative results of an assay could be due either to the absence of the active structure within the partial sequence or to improper renaturation. In addition to focusing on the full-length peptide P15-329, we focused our studies on the peptides P15-125, P15-183, P185-329, and P125-230. P125-230 was almost completely inactive with regard to collagen binding. However, other than the full-length peptide, it was the most efficient inhibitor of decorin endocytosis.2Thus, all four of the peptides were consistently found to be active in at least one assay system. The segment of the core protein represented by the recombinant peptide was therefore considered to possess at least a cryptic site for the respective interaction. A surprising diversity of the interacting domains of decorin core protein is the main result of our studies. Separate high affinity binding sites to collagen were observed for P15-183 and P185-329. P15-125 was especially active in the inhibition of collagen fibrillogenesis, whereas higher doses were required to compete with decorin binding to preformed collagen fibrils when compared with P15-183. This could suggest that P15-125 contains a lower affinity binding site. The existence of a low affinity binding site has been proposed previously (13Brown D.C. Vogel K.G. Matrix. 1989; 9: 468-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). A recent preliminary report also arrives at the conclusion that decorin core protein contains at least two functional domains that are involved in the interaction with the collagen-like molecule C1q (35Spiro R.C. Countaway J.L. Gaarde W.A. Garcia J.A. Leisten J. O'Neill J.J. Smiley W.R. Stecker K. Harper J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 303aGoogle Scholar). The existence of two high affinity binding sites may be difficult to understand when one considers the globular structure, determined by rotary shadowing, of the relatively small core protein (36Mörgelin M. Paulsson M. Malmström A. Heineg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12080-12090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the crystal structure of ribonuclease inhibitor, which, like decorin, is a protein with leucine-rich repeats, showed that this protein has the non-globular shape of a horseshoe and represents a new class of α/β protein folds (37Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1993; 366: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Provided that decorin core proteins exhibit an analogous structure, the data presented in this study are compatible with the assumption that the surface area formed by the fifth and/or sixth of the leucine-rich repeats, which are not contained within P15-125 (see Fig. 1), and a repeat from the C-terminal half of the molecule are involved in the binding to collagen fibrils. The flexible N-terminal part of the molecule with its two disulfide bridges is contained within both P15-125 and P15-183 and is considered to be involved in fibrillogenesis. Further studies, however, are needed to elucidate the interacting structures in greater detail. We are indebted to M. Bahl for skillful technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2047072740,"Secretory phospholipases A2(sPLA2) are structurally related enzymes found in mammals as well as in insect and snake venoms. They have been associated with several physiological, pathological, and toxic processes. Some of these effects are apparently linked to the existence of specific receptors for both venom and mammalian sPLA2s. We report here the molecular cloning and expression of one of these sPLA2receptors from human kidney. Two transcripts were detected. One encodes for a transmembrane form of the sPLA2receptor and the other one is an alternatively processed transcript, caused by polyadenylation occurring at a site within an intron in the C terminus part of the transcriptional unit. This transcript encodes for a shortened secreted soluble sPLA2receptor lacking the coding region for the transmembrane segment. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction experiments indicate a 1.6:1 ratio between the levels of transcripts encoding for the membrane-bound and soluble forms of the receptor, respectively. Soluble and membrane-bound human sPLA2receptors both bind sPLA2with high affinities. However, the binding properties of the human receptors are different from those obtained with the rabbit membrane-bound sPLA2receptor. The 180-kDa human sPLA2receptor gene has been mapped in the q23-q24 bands of chromosome 2. Secretory phospholipases A2(sPLA2) are structurally related enzymes found in mammals as well as in insect and snake venoms. They have been associated with several physiological, pathological, and toxic processes. Some of these effects are apparently linked to the existence of specific receptors for both venom and mammalian sPLA2s. We report here the molecular cloning and expression of one of these sPLA2receptors from human kidney. Two transcripts were detected. One encodes for a transmembrane form of the sPLA2receptor and the other one is an alternatively processed transcript, caused by polyadenylation occurring at a site within an intron in the C terminus part of the transcriptional unit. This transcript encodes for a shortened secreted soluble sPLA2receptor lacking the coding region for the transmembrane segment. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction experiments indicate a 1.6:1 ratio between the levels of transcripts encoding for the membrane-bound and soluble forms of the receptor, respectively. Soluble and membrane-bound human sPLA2receptors both bind sPLA2with high affinities.

Some of these effects are apparently linked to the existence of a variety of very high affinity receptors for these toxic svPLA2s (Kd= 5-40 p M), which have been characterized in rat brain (8Lambeau G.

It is secreted from pancreas during digestion and has long been thought to only act as a digestive enzyme (12De Haas G.H. Postema N.M. Nieuwenhuizen W. Van Deenen L.L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 159: 118-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). More recently, in relation with its localization in several tissues of non-digestive origin (13Seilhamer J.J. Randall T.L.

Because of its presence in large amounts in plasma and synovial fluids of patients with inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, acute pancreatitis, and endotoxic shock and its up-regulation by proinflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1 (reviewed in Refs. 19Vadas P.

Lipid Med. 1993; 8: 1-30PubMed Google Scholar), this type II sPLA2is considered to be a potent mediator of the inflammatory processes. Several studies have shown that this group II sPLA2is implicated in the production of potent lipid mediators of inflammation (24Barbour S.E. Dennis E.A. J. Biol.

Some of these effects are thought to be linked to the existence of high affinity sPLA2receptors with molecular masses of 180-200 kDa which have been identified in rabbit, rat, and bovine tissues (9Lambeau G. Schmid-Alliana A. Lazdunski M. Barhanin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9526-9532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lambeau G. Lazdunski M. Barhanin J. Neurochem.

Lazdunski M. Barhanin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9526-9532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with very high affinities (Kdvalues = 5-50 p M). It also tightly binds the porcine pancreatic group I and the human inflammatory group II sPLA2s with Kdvalues of 1-10 n M (28Lambeau G. Ancian P. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol.

These sPLA2receptors have new binding properties as compared with the rabbit sPLA2receptor.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsOS1and OS2were purified as described previously (8Lambeau G. Barhanin J. Schweitz H. Qar J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11503-11510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Porcine pancreatic sPLA2(group I) was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Human pancreatic sPLA2was kindly provided by Dr. Hubertus Verheij (Department of Enzymology and Protein Engineering, 3508 TB, Utrecht, The Netherlands). Human non-pancreatic sPLA2(group II) was a generous gift from Dr. Ruth Kramer (Eli Lilly). It is a recombinant protein expressed in Syrian Hamster AV 12 cells. p-Aminophenyl-α- Dmannopyranoside-BSA (mannose-BSA, catalog no. A4664) was purchased from Sigma.Isolation of cDNA Clones Encoding for the Human sPLA2ReceptorA cDNA fragment corresponding to nucleotides 2564-4687 of the rabbit sPLA2receptor (28Lambeau G. Ancian P. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1575-1578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used to probe 106phage plaques of a dT-primed human lung cDNA library in λgt11 vector (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.) at moderate stringency (hybridization for 16 h at 45°C in 5 × SSC and 30% formamide followed by four washes of the hybridization membranes in 2 × SSC at 45°C, where 1 × SSC = 0.15 M NaCl, 15 m M trisodium citrate, pH 7). Two positive clones were isolated. The longest one, 2.3 kilobase pairs (kbp) in length (HdT319) was subcloned into the pBluescript II plasmid vector (Stratagene Cloning Systems) and sequenced in both strands using the dye-terminator kit and automatic sequencing (Applied Biosystems model 373 A sequencer). DNA for sequencing was prepared with the Erase-A-base system (Promega Corp.) using the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA sequence included only a 1.2-kbp open reading frame, which was 84% homologous to the C-terminal part of the rabbit sPLA2receptor (28Lambeau G. Ancian P. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1575-1578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This 32P-labeled clone was used to probe 500,000 phage plaques of a homemade oligo(dT)-primed human kidney cDNA library in λZAPII (Stratagene Cloning Systems) at high stringency (hybridization for 16 h at 50°C in 5 × SSC, 50% formamide followed by two washes of the membranes in 2 × SSC at 50°C and two final washes in 0.2 × SSC at 60°C). Four positive clones were isolated. The 4.6-kbp clone 2C11 contained the N terminus part of the receptor. The 3.8-kbp clone 2B11 contained the C terminus part of the receptor, and the two other 3.5-kbp partial clones 3B11 and 3B12 contained the sequence corresponding to nucleotides 525-4067 of the rabbit receptor (28Lambeau G. Ancian P. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1575-1578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2C11 and 2B11 were sequenced on both strands as described above. The full-length cDNA clone encoding the membrane-anchored human sPLA2receptor was obtained by ligation at the SphI site (located at nucleotide 3171) of these two latter human kidney partial clones.PCR ExperimentsRT-PCR experiments have been performed on human kidney poly(A) mRNA reverse transcribed with the Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega Corp.). The specific amplification of fragments corresponding to the membrane-anchored and the soluble form of the sPLA2receptor cDNAs was achieved with a sense oligonucleotide called A (5′-CAGATGGTCTGGTTGAATGC-3′, nucleotides 4142-4162) common to both forms of the receptor, in combination with either the antisense oligonucleotide B (5′-ACAAAGTTCCAGCCAAGCAT-3′, nucleotides 4866-4886) or C (5′-GTTTTCAATAGGGAGTTTCT-3′, nucleotides 4450-4470), specific for the membrane-anchored and the soluble form of the sPLA2receptor, respectively (see Fig. 2). PCR conditions were: denaturation at 94°C for 1 min, annealing at 56°C for 1 min, and extension at 72°C for 1.5 min. The same combinations of oligonucleotides have been used on 500 ng of human genomic DNA as template, following a 5-min period of denaturation at 98°C (35 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 1 min, annealing at 56°C for 2 min, and extension at 72°C for 3 min).Quantitative PCR ExperimentsRandom-primed human kidney first strand cDNA were synthetized using the Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase with 1 μg of human kidney poly(A) mRNA as template. For the negative control, the reverse transcriptase was omitted in the reaction mixture. The specific amplification of fragments corresponding to the membrane-anchored and the soluble forms of the sPLA2receptor cDNAs was achieved with a sense oligonucleotide called Qc (5′-CCAATGCCCAATACCTTAGAA-3′, nucleotides 3552-3571) common to both forms of the receptor, in combination with either the antisense oligonucleotide Qm (5′-TGATGGGGCTTGAAGTAGTC-3′, nucleotides 4251-4270) or Qs (5′-CAAGGAGAGTTTTCTGGGTC-3′, nucleotides 4252-4271), specific for the membrane-anchored and the soluble forms of the sPLA2receptor, respectively. The assay mixture (100 μl) contained 20 m M Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 50 m M KCl, 1.5 m M MgCl2, 0.15 μM of primers Qc and Qm (or Qc and Qs), 100 μM each of dATP, dGTP, dTTP, 20 μM dCTP, 12.5 μCi of [32P]dCTP and 25 ng of template. The mixture was heated at 94°C during 2 min after which 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) were added. Amplification was performed in sequential cycles at 94°C, 1 min; 56°C, 1 min; and 72°C, 2 min. From 17 to 30 cycles, 5 μl of the reaction mixture were removed at each cycle and incubated for an additional 10 min at 72°C. The aliquots were electrophoresed on 6% acrylamide gels. Amplified DNA was fixed in the gel using 7% acetic acid and the gels were stained with 2 μg/ml ethidium bromide, photographed, and exposed 2 h for autoradiography. Bands of amplified DNA were cut from the gels and counted for the determination of incorporated radioactivity.Chromosomal Mapping of the Human sPLA2Receptor GeneIn situ hybridization was carried out on chromosome preparations obtained from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated human lymphocytes cultured for 72 h. 5-Bromodeoxyuridine was added for the final 7 h of culture (60 μg/ml of medium) to ensure a posthybridization chromosomal banding of good quality. The sPLA2receptor clone HdT319 containing an insert of 2300 base pairs (bp) corresponding to the C-terminal region of the receptor in the plasmid vector pBluescript II (stratagene) was tritium labeled by nick translation to a specific activity of 2 × 108disintegrations/min/μg. The radiolabeled probe was hybridized to metaphase spreads at a final concentration of 100 ng/ml of hybridization solution as described previously (32Mattéi M.-G. Philip N. Passage E. Moisan J.P. Mandel J.L. Mattéi J.-F. Human Genet. 1985; 69: 268-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). After coating with nuclear track emulsion (Kodak NTB2), the slides were exposed for 15 days at +4°C, then developed. To avoid any slipping of silver grains during the banding procedure, chromosome spreads were first stained with buffered Giemsa solution and metaphase photographed. R-banding was then performed by the fluorochrome-photolysis-Giemsa (FPG) method and metaphases rephotographed before analysis.Northern Blot Analysis of Human sPLA2Receptor ExpressionA human multiple tissue Northern blot (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.) was hybridized with the 32P-labeled HdT319 cDNA at high stringency (hybridization for 16 h at 55°C in 5 × SSC, 50% formamide followed by two washes of the membranes in 2 × SSC at 50°C, and two final washes in 0.2 × SSC at 65°C). As this commercial Northern blot did not show a good resolution in the labeled region of interest, we performed a new Northern blot with 2 μg of human kidney poly(A) mRNA (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.) separated in 1% agarose gel, transferred to a nylon membrane, and hybridized as described above.Expression of the Human sPLA2Receptor into Eukaryotic CellsThe full-length cDNAs encoding for the membrane-anchored and the soluble forms of the human sPLA2receptor were subcloned into the efficient expression vector pcDNA I (Invitrogen Corp.) and transfected into Chinese hamster ovary, 293, or COS cell lines (American Type Cell Collection) by the Ca/PO4procedure (33Graham F.L. Van der Erb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456Crossref PubMed Scopus (6475) Google Scholar). 50% confluent cells were transfected with 20 μg of DNA/75 cm2Petri dish on day 1. On day 2, the cells were trypsinized and replated. On day 3, cells were scraped, and 125I-OS1binding was performed as described previously (9Lambeau G. Schmid-Alliana A. Lazdunski M. Barhanin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9526-9532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For binding experiments to the soluble human sPLA2receptor, the medium from transfected cells was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Aliquots of the supernatant were incubated with 125I-OS1as described for the membrane-bound sPLA2receptor (9Lambeau G. Schmid-Alliana A. Lazdunski M. Barhanin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9526-9532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that reaction mixtures were filtered through Whatman GF/F glass-fiber filters. Mock-transfected cells were obtained by transfection with the parent vector pcDNA I.For internalization experiments, 293 cells were transfected with the cDNA encoding for the membrane bound human sPLA2receptor and plated onto 24-well plates precoated with 10 μg/ml of polylysine. The next day, confluent cells were incubated for 3 h at 4°C with 800 p M of 125I-OS1in the presence or absence of 300 n M unlabeled OS1in 0.25 ml of incubation buffer (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 (50/50) supplemented with 0.1% of BSA and 20 m M HEPES, pH 7.4). The cells were rinsed twice with cold medium and then incubated for the kinetic experiment at 37°C. The incubation medium (0.5 ml) was removed at indicated times, and cells were rinsed once with the above buffer. Cell-surface-associated 125I-OS1was removed by incubating the cells for 5 min in 0.5 ml of a dissociating buffer (50 m M sodium acetate, pH 3.5, 500 m M NaCl, 0.1% BSA, and 0.1 m M CaCl2). Wells were rinsed once with this acidic buffer, and internalized 125I-OS1was counted after cell solubilization in 1 ml of NaOH 0.1 N. The degradation of the ligand was measured by precipitation of the incubation medium with 5% trichloroacetic acid. The radioactivity associated with the trichloroacetic acid-insoluble fraction is referred to as the intact ligand, as confirmed by gel filtration chromatography on Sephadex G-25. The radioactivity associated with the trichloroacetic acid-soluble fraction is refered to as degradation products of 125I-OS1.RESULTSIsolation of cDNA Clones Encoding for the Human Kidney sPLA2ReceptorPrevious experiments have shown that the mRNA encoding the rabbit sPLA2receptor is strongly expressed in rabbit lung (28Lambeau G. Ancian P. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1575-1578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A cDNA fragment corresponding to nucleotides 2564-4687 of the rabbit sPLA2receptor (28Lambeau G. Ancian P. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1575-1578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was therefore used to screen a human lung cDNA library constructed in the λgt11 vector. 106clones were screened at moderate stringency, and two positive clones were isolated. The longest clone called HdT319 has a significant homology (85%) with the 1.2-kbp C-terminal region of the rabbit sPLA2receptor and contains 1.1 kbp of 3′ non-coding sequence as well as a poly(A) stretch consistent with a poly(A) tail (Fig. 1). Northern blot analysis with the clone HdT319 as a probe reveals that the human sPLA2receptor mRNA is expressed at a high level in kidney (see below). In order to obtain the full-length cDNA clone encoding the human sPLA2receptor, 500,000 clones of a oligo(dT)-primed human kidney λZAPII cDNA library were screened with the above 32P-labeled clone. Four positive overlapping clones were isolated (Fig. 1). Sequence analysis revealed that the clone 2C11 of 4.6 kbp contained a 5′-non-coding region of 207 bp, a large open reading frame encoding for the amino acids 1-1325 of the receptor as well as a 3′-non-coding sequence of 466 bp, terminated by a poly(A) tail. The clone 2B11 of 3.8 kbp contained an open reading frame encoding for the amino acid sequence 536-1465 of the receptor followed by 1.1 kbp of 3′-non-coding sequence identical to that of HdT319. The two other clones 3B11 and 3B12 of 3.5 kbp contained a large open reading frame encoding for the amino acid sequence 149-1330 of the receptor.FIG. 1Schematic representation of the human sPLA2 receptor cDNA clones. These clones were obtained by screening of a dT-primed human lung cDNA library (HdT319) and of a dT-primed human kidney cDNA library (others). Open bars, coding regions of the membrane-anchored (2B11-3B11-3B12) or the soluble form (2C11) of the human sPLA2receptor. The black and hatched black boxes represent the 3′-non-coding region of the soluble and membrane-anchored form of the receptor, respectively. The white hatched box shows the 5′-non-coding region of the sPLA2receptor. 5′ end, 3′ end, and nucleotide positions of stop codons (S) are indicated. SphI restriction site (nucleotide 3171) was used to construct the full-length cDNA clone encoding for the membrane-anchored form of the receptor (named BC11).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)None of these cDNA clones contained the expected complete coding region when compared with the rabbit sPLA2receptor. When sequences of clones 2B11 and 2C11 were overlapped, the combined sequence displayed a significant homology with the previously cloned membrane-anchored rabbit sPLA2receptor. Therefore, these clones have been used to construct the full-length cDNA encoding for the human membrane-anchored sPLA2receptor (named BC11), using the SphI restriction site shown in Fig. 1. The open reading frame of this cDNA sequence encodes for a protein of 1465 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 168 kDa (Fig. 2). It has a striking homology with its rabbit (28Lambeau G. Ancian P. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1575-1578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and bovine (29Ishizaki J. Hanasaki K. Higashino K. Kishino J. Kikuchi N. Ohara O. Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5897-5904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) counterparts (84 and 85% of homology at the amino acid level, respectively). The first 25 amino acids following the initiator methionine have the features of a signal sequence (34Von Heijne G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 947: 307-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). An alanine located 26 amino acids downstream of this methionine was deduced to be the N-terminal residue of the mature protein, when compared to the rabbit receptor (28Lambeau G. Ancian P. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1575-1578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence has 15 potential N-glycosylation sites (Fig. 2) while the rabbit equivalent has 16 (28Lambeau G. Ancian P. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1575-1578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like the rabbit receptor, the human protein displays a N-terminal cysteine-rich domain (residues 26-165), a fibronectin-like type II domain (residues 166-222), eight carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs) in tandem (residues 223-1381), a unique transmembrane segment (residues 1398-1423), and a short C-terminal cytoplasmic tail (residues 1424-1465). This cytoplasmic tail of the receptor contains the typical consensus sequence NP XY, which is presumably involved in the internalization of the ligand-receptor complex (35Chen W. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3116-3123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This consensus sequence is also found in the bovine corpus luteum 180-kDa sPLA2receptor (29Ishizaki J. Hanasaki K. Higashino K. Kishino J. Kikuchi N. Ohara O. Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5897-5904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the rabbit sPLA2receptor having the sequence NSYY. It also contains a consensus sequence site for casein-kinase II phosphorylation on Ser-1460, suggesting a possible role of this kinase in the regulation of the receptor activity (Fig. 2). Comparison of the protein sequence with data bases revealed that this human sPLA2receptor has a 29% sequence homology with the human macrophage mannose receptor, a protein involved in the endocytosis of glycoproteins bearing terminal carbohydrates residues and in the phagocytosis of yeast and other pathogenic microorganisms (30Ezekowitz R.A.B. Sastry K. Bailly P. Warner A. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1785-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 31Taylor M.E. Conary J.T. Lennartz M.R. Stahl P.D. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12156-12162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Analysis of the different clones isolated from the human kidney cDNA library shows the presence of a second form of sPLA2receptor transcript in this tissue. The cDNA corresponding to this second form (clone 2C11) has a diverging sequence after the nucleotide 4179 with a 5′ potential consensus splice donor site (36Ohshima Y. Gotoh Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) at this nucleotide position (Fig. 2). Open reading frame analysis shows the presence of a stop codon 5 nucleotides downstream of the diverging sequence, thus changing the amino acids Asn-Glu-Thr (residues 1327-1329 of the membrane-anchored form of the receptor) into the sequence Ser-Lys-stop. This stop codon is followed by an untranslated region of 466 nucleotides which contains a canonical polyadenylation signal AATAAA located 19 bases upstream from a poly(A) tail. This alternatively processed transcript encodes for a sPLA2receptor-related protein, lacking a part of the eighth CRD, the transmembrane segment and the cytoplasmic tail, suggesting the existence of a soluble secreted form of the sPLA2receptor.Since the nucleotide sequences of clones 2B11 and 2C11 are identical in a large overlapping region, it is unlikely that the two forms of sPLA2receptors are generated from two different genes. In agreement with that view, a single labeling has been observed for the chromosomal localization using a probe common to both transcripts (clone HdT319). Taken together, these results show that these two mRNA forms are transcribed from the same gene. To obtain further information relative to the mechanism of generation of the shortened transcript (clone 2C11), PCR experiments have been performed on both human kidney first strand cDNA and human genomic DNA as templates, with a sense oligonucleotide common to both forms (oligonucleotide A), and two antisense oligonucleotides, B and C, specific for the membrane-anchored and the soluble sPLA2receptor, respectively (Figs. 2 and 3 B). As expected, a fragment of 0.75 kbp has been amplified on human kidney first strand cDNA using oligonucleotides A and B, but no amplified product was seen on human genomic DNA (Fig. 3 A), suggesting that the genomic DNA fragment of the sPLA2receptor between these two oligonucleotides is too large to allow the amplification of this gene fragment.

In vitro, apoE has been shown to bind β-amyloid (Aβ), an amyloidogenic peptide that aggregates to form the primary component of senile plaques. In previous work, we demonstrated that apoE3 from tissue culture medium binds to Aβ with greater avidity than apoE4 (LaDu, M. J., Falduto, M. T., Manelli, A. M., Reardon, C. A., Getz, G. S., and Frail, D. E. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 23403-23406). This is in contrast to data using purified apoE isoforms as substrate for Aβ (Strittmatter, W. J., Weisgraber, K. H., Huang, D.

Here we resolve this apparent discrepancy by demonstrating that the preferential binding of Aβ to apoE3 is attenuated and even abolished with purification, a process that includes delipidation and denaturation.

ApoE is also expressed in the brain (1Elshourbagy N.A. Liao W.S. Mahley R.W. Taylor J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 203-207Google Scholar) and in response to injury in both the peripheral (2Boyles J.K. Zoellner C.D. Anderson L.J. Kosik L.M. Pitas R.E. Weisgraber K.H. Hui D.Y. Mahley R.W.

S. A. 1986; 83: 1130-1134Google Scholar) systems. In humans, apoE has three major isoforms, E2 (Cys112, Cys158), E3 (Cys112, Arg158), and E4 (Arg1121, Arg158), which are products of three alleles at a single gene locus. The presence of cysteine in apoE2 and apoE3 allow these isoforms to form disulfide-linked dimers. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the apoE e4 allele is present with increased frequency in patients with sporadic (4Saunders A.M. Strittmatter W.J. Schmechel D. George-Hyslop St., P.H.

Due primarily to this genetic linkage, the role of apoE in the pathogenesis of AD is being actively pursued.A major neuropathological feature of AD is the presence of extracellular senile plaques composed predominantly of aggregated β-amyloid peptide (Aβ). The physiological mechanism by which apoE contributes to AD pathology may be by means of an isoform-specific interaction with Aβ. ApoE and Aβ colocalize in senile plaques (6Wisniewski T. Frangione B. Neurosci. Lett. 1992; 135: 235-238Google Scholar), and synthetic Aβ peptides bind in vitro to apoE from tissue culture medium (7LaDu M.J. Falduto M.T. Manelli A.M. Reardon C.A. Getz G.S. Frail D.E.

Goldgaber D. Roses A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8098-8102Google Scholar). However, studies involving apoE isoform specificity in binding to Aβ have been limited and contradictory. In previous work, we demonstrated that apoE3 from tissue culture medium binds to Aβ with greater avidity than apoE4 (7LaDu M.J. Falduto M.T. Manelli A.M. Reardon C.A. Getz G.S. Frail D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23403-23406Google Scholar). This is in contrast to data from Strittmatter et al. (10Strittmatter W.J. Weisgraber K.H. Huang D.Y. Dong L.-M. Salvesen G.S. Pericak-Vance M. Schmechel D. Saunders A.M. Goldgaber D. Roses A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8098-8102Google Scholar), who used apoE isoforms purified from human plasma as substrate for Aβ. Here we resolve the apparent discrepancy between these studies by demonstrating that the previously observed preferential association of Aβ with apoE3 is attenuated or abolished by purification, a process that includes delipidation and denaturation.MATERIALS AND METHODSExpression of Human ApoE in Cultured CellsHuman apoE3 and apoE4 were expressed in HEK-293 cells stably transfected with human apoE3 or apoE4 (products of the e3 and e4 alleles, respectively) cDNA as described previously (7LaDu M.J. Falduto M.T. Manelli A.M. Reardon C.A. Getz G.S. Frail D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23403-23406Google Scholar). Conditioned medium containing apoE was concentrated (Centriprep, Amicon, Inc.) ~50-fold prior to binding reactions or purification.Purification of ApoEHuman plasma was screened for apoE genotype using a modification of the method of Hixson and Vernier (11Hixson J.E. Vernier D.T. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 545-548Google Scholar). Intermediate and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles (d < 1.02 g/ml) were isolated (12Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 129: 145-166Google Scholar) from the plasma of individuals homozygous for apoE3 and apoE4. Unpurified preparations of VLDL were used within 2 weeks of isolation. Purification of apoE from this lipoprotein fraction and from concentrated conditioned medium was carried out according to standard procedures (13Rall S.C. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 273-287Google Scholar). Briefly, the conditioned medium and lipoproteins were dialyzed against 0.01% EDTA, lyophilized, and delipidated in CHCl3:MeOH (2:1). Delipidated proteins were pelleted in MeOH and solubilized in 6 M guanidine, 0.1 M Tris, 0.01% EDTA (pH 7.4), and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol. Proteins were fractionated on a Sephacryl S-300 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated in 4 M guanidine, 0.1 M Tris, 0.01% EDTA (pH 7.4), and 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol. Fractions containing apoE were dialyzed in 5 m M NH4HCO3, lyophilized, and resuspended in 0.1 M NH4HCO3. Unpurified and purified apoE proteins were quantified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, protein staining, and densitometry (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.) of serial dilutions of apoE-containing samples using a purified apoE standard.ApoE⋅Aβ Complex Formation and DetectionFor binding reactions, synthetic human Aβ- (1Elshourbagy N.A.

A. 1993; 90: 1977-1981Google Scholar) Alzheimer' disease. However, the physiological mechanism by which apoE isoform specificity contributes to the pathogenesis of the disease is unknown. Previously, using unpurified apoE from conditioned medium, we showed that the amount of the apoE3⋅Aβ complex was much greater compared with the apoE4⋅Aβ complex (7LaDu M.J. Falduto M.T. Manelli A.M. Reardon C.A. Getz G.S. Frail D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23403-23406Google Scholar). These results are in contrast to data published by Strittmatter et al. (10Strittmatter W.J. Weisgraber K.H. Huang D.Y. Dong L.-M. Salvesen G.S. Pericak-Vance M. Schmechel D. Saunders A.M. Goldgaber D. Roses A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8098-8102Google Scholar). Using apoE purified from human plasma, they reported that apoE4 binds Aβ more rapidly than apoE3. However, the level of Aβ binding to apoE3 and apoE4 after several hours of incubation was comparable. The major differences between these two studies are the source of apoE (plasma versus secreted by cultured cells) and whether the apoE protein was purified prior to use in the binding assays. In this study, we examined whether these differences could account for the discrepancy between these two reports regarding apoE isoform-specific binding to Aβ. We compared the Aβ binding capacity of unpurified apoE from both conditioned medium and intact human VLDL from plasma of apoE3/3 and apoE4/4 homozygotes with the Aβ binding capacity of apoE purified from these two sources. The purification procedure (13Rall S.C. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 273-287Google Scholar) used was the same as that used by Strittmatter et al. (10Strittmatter W.J. Weisgraber K.H. Huang D.Y. Dong L.-M. Salvesen G.S. Pericak-Vance M. Schmechel D. Saunders A.M. Goldgaber D. Roses A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8098-8102Google Scholar).We first examined the effect of purification of apoE from conditioned medium on the formation of apoE⋅Aβ complexes. ApoE3 and apoE4 were purified from the medium of transfected HEK-293 cells, and the binding of this material to Aβ was compared with the binding of unpurified apoE from medium (Fig. 1). Prior to purification, the amount of the apoE3⋅Aβ complex (Fig. 1, A and B, lane 2) was ~20-fold greater compared with the apoE4⋅Aβ complex (lane 4). These results are consistent with our previous data that demonstrated that this preferential binding of Aβ to apoE3 is maintained over time, pH range, and concentration of apoE and Aβ (7LaDu M.J. Falduto M.T. Manelli A.M. Reardon C.A. Getz G.S. Frail D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23403-23406Google Scholar). Purification of the apoE isoforms from this medium resulted in a decrease in Aβ binding to apoE3 (Fig. 1, A and B, lane 6) and an increase in Aβ binding to apoE4 (lane 8). To determine whether an auxiliary component that influences the isoform specificity of apoE binding to Aβ is present in the medium of HEK-293 cells, we reconstituted purified apoE with mock-transfected conditioned medium. The isoform specificity of apoE binding to Aβ was not restored to pre-purification levels, indicating that purification does not remove a component present in the medium that confers the preferential binding of Aβ to apoE3 (compare Figs. 2 and 1 A, lanes 5-8).Figure 1:ApoE/Aβ binding: effect of purifying apoE isoforms from conditioned medium. Shown are Western blots of binding reactions using 25 μg/ml apoE (~700 n M) incubated with (lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8) or without (lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7) 250 μM Aβ-(1-40)-peptide for 2 h at room temperature. Sources of apoE were as follows: conditioned medium of transfected cells (apoE3, lanes 1 and 2; apoE4, lanes 3 and 4) and purified from conditioned medium (apoE3, lanes 5 and 6; apoE4, lanes 7 and 8).

Similar to the results using unpurified apoE from conditioned medium, we observed an ~20-fold difference in the amount of the apoE3⋅Aβ complex (Fig. 3, A and B, lane 2) compared with the apoE4⋅Aβ complex (lane 4) when using intact VLDL particles as the source of apoE. As with purification of apoE from medium, purification of apoE from the VLDL fraction of human plasma attenuated the preferential binding of apoE3 to Aβ (Fig. 3 A and B, lanes 6 and 8). The level of Aβ binding to both apoE4 and apoE3 dimer was increased after purification of apoE from plasma. In apoE3/3 plasma, the apoE immunoreactive species migrating slightly higher than the apoE⋅Aβ complex (~55 kDa) is the apoE3-apolipoprotein A-II heterodimer (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1 and 2). 2M. J. LaDu and M. T. Falduto, unpublished observations. The autoradiographs shown in Figs. 1 and 3 are representative of several experiments with similar results using different apoE-containing preparations. While some variation in the purification-mediated loss of preferential apoE3 binding to Aβ was observed, in general, purification of apoE from both medium and plasma abolished isoform-specific binding to Aβ.Figure 3:ApoE/Aβ binding: effect of purifying apoE isoforms from human plasma. Shown are Western blots of apoE/Aβ binding reactions assayed under the conditions described in the legend to Fig. 1. Sources of apoE were as follows: intact VLDL from apoE3/3 (lanes 1 and 2) and apoE4/4 (lanes 3 and 4) homozygotes and purified from VLDL of apoE3/3 (lanes 5 and 6) and apoE4/4 (lanes 7 and 8) homozygotes. Samples were run as described in the legend to Fig. 1 and probed with 4G8 antibody (A) or apoE antiserum (B). For apoE3 VLDL, total protein was 95 ng/μl, and triglyceride was 600 ng/μl. For apoE4 VLDL, total protein was 110 ng/μl, and triglyceride was 400 ng/μl.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Strittmatter et al. (10Strittmatter W.J. Weisgraber K.H. Huang D.Y. Dong L.-M. Salvesen G.S. Pericak-Vance M. Schmechel D. Saunders A.M. Goldgaber D. Roses A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8098-8102Google Scholar) used apoE purified from plasma to show that Aβ binds to apoE4 monomer at a faster rate than to apoE3 monomer. However, the contribution of the apoE3-Aβ complex in their time course data is difficult to discern since the blots were probed for apoE and Aβ immunoreactivity simultaneously (10Strittmatter W.J. Weisgraber K.H. Huang D.Y. Dong L.-M. Salvesen G.S. Pericak-Vance M. Schmechel D. Saunders A.M. Goldgaber D. Roses A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8098-8102Google Scholar). Therefore, we repeated the time course study using purified plasma apoE isoforms and probed for Aβ (Fig. 4 A) and apoE (Fig. 4 B) immunoreactivity individually. Similar to the results obtained by Strittmatter et al. (10Strittmatter W.J. Weisgraber K.H. Huang D.Y. Dong L.-M. Salvesen G.S. Pericak-Vance M. Schmechel D. Saunders A.M. Goldgaber D. Roses A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8098-8102Google Scholar), apoE4 monomer did form a complex with Aβ at a faster rate compared with apoE3 monomer. However, when the apoE3 dimer-Aβ complex was taken into account, the total binding of Aβ to apoE3 and apoE4 remained comparable across time.There are several possibilities that could account for the loss of isoform specificity in the binding of purified apoE to Aβ. Purification may result in a change in the oxidative state of apoE that influences its binding to Aβ. Although the apoE isoforms are subject to the same conditions while undergoing purification, oxidation could be specific to the Cys112 in apoE3. This could affect conformation-dependent binding of apoE to Aβ, either directly or via interaction of other amino acids with this residue. However, apoE3 dimer, particularly in its purified form, readily binds Aβ, indicating that at least oxidation of cysteine does not seem to adversely affect apoE3 ⋅ Aβ complex formation. In addition, oxidation provides no obvious explanation for the increase in Aβ binding to purified apoE4 monomer.Another more likely explanation is that apoE acquires a conformation when lipid-associated that confers isoform-specific binding to Aβ. Purification, which includes delipidation, may increase the binding of Aβ to apoE3 dimer and apoE4 monomer by disrupting the endogenous conformation of these apoE species. In each of the unpurified preparations used here, apoE was lipid-associated. ApoE from human plasma was in the VLDL fraction, while the majority of apoE in conditioned medium was in a high density lipid fraction. 3M. J. LaDu, M. T. Falduto, and C. A. Reardon, unpublished observations. Purified apoE has been shown to require lipid to restore its biological activity in other assay systems, presumably by allowing the denatured protein to refold to its functional conformation. These apoE activity assays include such diverse functions as receptor binding and modulation of neuritic growth. While purified apoE is unable to displace 125I-labeled low density lipoprotein (LDL) from LDL receptors (16Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1440-1447Google Scholar), high affinity binding is restored when apoE is added in the presence of a variety of lipid particles, including phospholipid vesicles (17Innerarity T.L. Pitas R.E. Mahley R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 129: 542-565Google Scholar). Similarly, the binding of purified apoE to LDL receptor-related protein is enhanced by the addition of β-migrating VLDL (18Kowal R.C. Herz J. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10771-10779Google Scholar). In primary dorsal root ganglia cultures, purified apoE3 and apoE4 have no effect on neuritic growth. However, when added in the presence of β-migrating VLDL, both apoE isoforms affect neuritic growth, with apoE3 increasing neuritic extension and decreasing branching and apoE4 decreasing both branching and extension (19Nathan B.P. Bellosta S. Sanan D.A. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Pitas R.E. Science. 1994; 264: 850-852Google Scholar). Experiments are in progress using the assay system described here to determine the nature of the interaction of Aβ with lipid-associated apoE using both endogenous lipoproteins and reconstituted lipid vesicles.The data presented here are consistent with a function for apoE in the pathogenesis of AD by sequestering Aβ. Avid binding of apoE3 to soluble Aβ in the neuropil could lead to enhanced clearance or altered fibril formation, both of which could prevent the conversion of Aβ into a neurotoxic species. Since lipid-associated apoE3 and apoE4 bind the LDL receptor and LDL receptor-related protein with equal affinity (18Kowal R.C. Herz J. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10771-10779Google Scholar), efficient uptake and clearance of Aβ may depend on its preferential binding to apoE3. Alternatively, purified apoE3 and apoE4 are known to differ with respect to their effect on Aβ fibril formation (20Ma J. Wee A. Brewer H.B. Das S. Potter H. Nature. 1994; 372: 92-94Google Scholar, 21Sanan D.A. Weisgraber K.H. Russell S.J. Mahley R.W. Huang D. Saunders A. Schmechel D. Wisniewski T. Frangione B. Roses A.D. Strittmatter W.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 860-869Google Scholar, 22Wisniewski T. Castano E.M. Golabek A. Vogel T. Frangione B. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 1030-1035Google Scholar), suggesting that native apoE may play an even greater isoform-specific role in the extracellular aggregation of Aβ due to differences in Aβ binding characteristics. Finally, there is evidence that Aβ-induced toxicity in hippocampal neurons is attenuated by the addition of rabbit apoE (23Whitson J.S. Mims M.P. Strittmatter W.J. Yamaki T. Morrisett J.D. Appel S.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 163-170Google Scholar), leading to the intriguing possibility that human apoE may contribute to Aβ-induced toxicity in an isoform-specific manner.In summary, using unpurified apoE from tissue culture medium and intact VLDL particles, the apoE3⋅Aβ complex was ~20-fold more abundant than the apoE4⋅Aβ complex. This isoform specificity was attenuated or abolished when apoE purified from these two sources was used in binding reactions with Aβ. ApoE is an apolipoprotein, and as such, its endogenous conformation requires lipid. It is therefore not surprising that the type of apoE preparation used can affect the results. The avidity of Aβ binding to apoE3 compared with apoE4 demonstrated here may be involved in the isoform-specific effect underlying the genetic correlation between the apoE e4 allele and AD. The physiological relevance of this complex to plaque formation or neurodegeneration awaits further investigation.

ApoE is also expressed in the brain (1Elshourbagy N.A. Liao W.S. Mahley R.W. Taylor J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 203-207Google Scholar) and in response to injury in both the peripheral (2Boyles J.K. Zoellner C.D. Anderson L.J. Kosik L.M. Pitas R.E. Weisgraber K.H. Hui D.Y. Mahley R.W.

S. A. 1986; 83: 1130-1134Google Scholar) systems. In humans, apoE has three major isoforms, E2 (Cys112, Cys158), E3 (Cys112, Arg158), and E4 (Arg1121, Arg158), which are products of three alleles at a single gene locus. The presence of cysteine in apoE2 and apoE3 allow these isoforms to form disulfide-linked dimers. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the apoE e4 allele is present with increased frequency in patients with sporadic (4Saunders A.M. Strittmatter W.J. Schmechel D. George-Hyslop St., P.H.

Due primarily to this genetic linkage, the role of apoE in the pathogenesis of AD is being actively pursued.A major neuropathological feature of AD is the presence of extracellular senile plaques composed predominantly of aggregated β-amyloid peptide (Aβ). The physiological mechanism by which apoE contributes to AD pathology may be by means of an isoform-specific interaction with Aβ. ApoE and Aβ colocalize in senile plaques (6Wisniewski T. Frangione B. Neurosci. Lett. 1992; 135: 235-238Google Scholar), and synthetic Aβ peptides bind in vitro to apoE from tissue culture medium (7LaDu M.J. Falduto M.T. Manelli A.M. Reardon C.A. Getz G.S. Frail D.E.

In previous work, we demonstrated that apoE3 from tissue culture medium binds to Aβ with greater avidity than apoE4 (7LaDu M.J. Falduto M.T. Manelli A.M. Reardon C.A. Getz G.S. Frail D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23403-23406Google Scholar). This is in contrast to data from Strittmatter et al. (10Strittmatter W.J. Weisgraber K.H. Huang D.Y. Dong L.-M. Salvesen G.S. Pericak-Vance M.

Here we resolve the apparent discrepancy between these studies by demonstrating that the previously observed preferential association of Aβ with apoE3 is attenuated or abolished by purification, a process that includes delipidation and denaturation."

Whereas the specific activity of CPT II increased ∼3-fold during the first month of life, the profile for CPT I, which is composed of both liver (L) and muscle (M) isoforms, was more complex. Exposure of mitochondria to [3H]etomoxir (a covalent ligand for CPT I), followed by fluorographic analysis of the membrane proteins, established that while in the adult heart L-CPT I represents a very minor constituent, its contribution is much greater in the newborn animal. Use of the related inhibitor, 2-[6-(2,4-dinitrophenoxy)hexyl]oxirane-2-carboxylic acid (specific for L-CPT I), allowed the activities of the two CPT I variants to be quantified separately.

CPT II, on the matrix side of the inner membrane, reverses the transacylation reaction, regenerating acyl-CoA (1McGarry J.D. Woeltje K.F. Kuwajima M. Foster D.W. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1989; 5: 271-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Overall control of fatty acid transport, and thus of β-oxidation, is exerted at the level of CPT I by virtue of its unique inhibitability by malonyl-CoA, the product of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase reaction (1McGarry J.D. Woeltje K.F. Kuwajima M. Foster D.W. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1989; 5: 271-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar).

In addition, CPT I has attracted attention as a potential site of pharmacological intervention in poorly controlled diabetes mellitus where fatty acid oxidation is excessive and has a detrimental effect on glucose homeostasis (7Foley J.E.

Efforts to dissect the mitochondrial CPT system 2In this article the terms CPT I and CPT II refer exclusively to the mitochondrial enzymes, although it is recognized that proteins with CPT activity are also associated with peroxisomes and microsomes (9Murthy M.S.R.

Available evidence indicates that in both species CPT II (∼71 kDa) is expressed as the same protein throughout the entire body (12McGarry J.D. Sen A. Brown N.F. Esser V. Weis B.C. Foster D.W.

J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10714-10719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, the regulated enzyme, CPT I, exists in at least two isoforms. These have been designated L-CPT I and M-CPT I, indicating their association with liver and skeletal muscle, respectively (16Weis B.C. Esser V. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18712-18715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Weis B.C. Cowan A.T. Brown N. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26443-26448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two proteins differ not only in monomeric size (∼88 and 82 kDa, respectively) but also in their profoundly different kinetic characteristics (Km for carnitine, ∼30 and 500 μM, respectively; I50 3The term I50 refers to the concentration of malonyl-CoA required to inhibit CPT I activity by 50% under defined assay conditions. 3The term I50 refers to the concentration of malonyl-CoA required to inhibit CPT I activity by 50% under defined assay conditions. for malonyl-CoA, ∼2.7 and 0.03 μM, respectively (18McGarry J.D. Mills S.E. Long C.S. Foster D.W. Biochem. J. 1983; 214: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar)). In examining the features of CPT I in adult rat heart mitochondria we made the unexpected observation that this tissue expresses both the M- and L-type enzymes (16Weis B.C. Esser V. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18712-18715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Weis B.C. Cowan A.T. Brown N. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26443-26448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that the L variant contributed only ∼2-3% to total CPT I activity was puzzling and difficult to rationalize teleologically. In the present study, therefore, we asked the following question: is the 98:2 ratio of M- to L-CPT I activity a fixed property of rat cardiac tissue, or is it possible that the L isoform (low Km for carnitine) makes a more significant contribution in the newborn period when the carnitine content of the heart is known to be low (19Robles-Valdes C. McGarry J.D. Foster D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6007-6012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)? As outlined below, it turns out that soon after birth L-CPT I is probably responsible for a major fraction of fatty acid oxidation in rat heart and that its decline during growth of the pups represents another striking example of developmental isoform switching in heart tissue. The findings might have pathophysiological significance in situations of inherited CPT I deficiency syndromes. Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Inc., Indianapolis, IN) were maintained on regular Purina chow (4% fat) with lighting from 1000 to 2200 h. Organ harvest was performed between 1100 and 1200 h. Animals were bred in-house, with the day of birth designated as day 0 and weaning at day 21. The rats were killed by cervical dislocation, adult males (250-450 g) being first anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of Nembutal. To obtain fetal tissue, timed pregnant females were purchased, and hearts were removed 1-2 days prepartum. The mothers were rendered unconscious by inhalation of Metofane prior to sacrifice. Hearts from 1-3 litters of mixed sex were used for each analysis in animals between the fetal and 29-day-old stages of life. Individual males were used for adult time points. Hearts were rapidly removed, trimmed of visible blood vessels, and homogenized in ∼10 ml/g, wet weight, of 250 m M sucrose, 5 m M Tris-HCl, pH 7.2 (Tissumizer; Tekmar Co., Cincinnati, OH; large probe, 10 s, setting 50). Mitochondria were prepared as described in method A of Ref. 18McGarry J.D. Mills S.E. Long C.S. Foster D.W. Biochem. J. 1983; 214: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar and finally suspended in 150 m M KCl, 5 m M Tris-HCl, pH 7.2 (buffer A) at 4 ml/g of original tissue. For inhibitor treatment, the suspension was diluted with an equal volume of activation mixture (200 m M Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 100 m M KCl, 12 m M MgCl2, 12 m M ATP, 0.7 m M glutathione, 100 μM CoASH, and 1.2% bovine serum albumin) before addition of [3H]etomoxir or unlabeled DNP-etomoxir to a concentration of 3 or 10 μM, respectively. Control samples lacked only the inhibitor. The tubes were then rocked gently for 1 h at room temperature (during this time the inhibitors become activated to their CoA derivatives, and it is in this form that they interact with CPT I, bonding covalently). Subsequently, the mitochondria were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C, resuspended in the same volume of 0.9% NaCl, 0.4% bovine serum albumin, and similarly resedimented. For samples treated with or without DNP-etomoxir, the final pellet was brought to 4 ml/g of original tissue in buffer A for assay of CPT I. The washed [3H]etomoxir-labeled mitochondrial pellets were resuspended to 4 ml/g of original tissue in 5 m M potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, twice frozen and thawed in liquid N2, and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. The labeled membranes were suspended to ∼1 mg of protein/ml in SDS sample buffer and boiled for 3 min, and an aliquot of each sample containing ∼5,000 cpm of protein-bound 3H of the mixture was subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by fluorography (20Declercq P.E. Falck J.R. Kuwajima M. Tyminski H. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9812-9821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For measurement of CPT II activity mitochondria were pelleted by centrifugation and stored at −20°C (studies not shown had established that CPT II is stable for months under these conditions). At the time of assay, the pellets were resuspended in buffer A (4 ml/g of original tissue), octyl glucoside was added to a concentration of 1% (w/v), and the mixtures were kept on ice for 30 min. Such treatment causes inactivation of CPT I and solubilization of CPT II in active form (21Woeltje K.F. Kuwajima M. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9822-9827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CPT activity was assayed at 30°C in the direction of palmitoylcarnitine formation (18McGarry J.D. Mills S.E. Long C.S. Foster D.W. Biochem. J. 1983; 214: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) in the presence of 50 μM palmitoyl-CoA, 1% bovine serum albumin (w/v) and the indicated concentrations of L-carnitine (containing L-[methyl-14C]-carnitine). Reaction rates were linear over the time period studied, usually 4 min. With intact mitochondria, the assay monitors only CPT I, the activity of which is essentially completely inhibited by malonyl-CoA. Protein was measured by the method of Lowry et al. (22Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cardiac myocytes were isolated from 7-day-old litters or adult male rats by collagenase digestion of diced heart tissue and purification of released myocytes by centrifugation through 3% Ficoll as described (16Weis B.C. Esser V. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18712-18715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Glick M.R. Burns A.H. Reddy W.J. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 61: 32-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) except for the inclusion of 10 μg/ml DNase I during collagenase treatment. Preparations contained >90% myocytes as judged by microscopic examination. The cells, suspended in buffer A at a concentration of 0.4-1.0 mg of protein/ml, were broken using eight cycles of a tightly fitting glass homogenizer. The homogenate was then incubated in the absence or presence of DNP-etomoxir and assayed for CPT I as described above for heart mitochondria. Hearts were rapidly excised, frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −70°C until the assay. At that time, samples of frozen tissue (250-500 mg) were pulverized under liquid N2, and the powder was immediately homogenized in 3 ml of ice-cold 3% perchloric acid. After centrifugation, the supernatant was neutralized with KOH and used for the measurement of free and total carnitine (the difference representing short chain acylcarnitines, primarily acetylcarnitine) using an isotopic assay (24McGarry J.D. Foster D.W. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim1985: 474-481Google Scholar). Sources have been given in Refs. 16Weis B.C. Esser V. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol.

J. 1983; 214: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar and 24. Fig. 1 depicts the profile of CPT I and CPT II activities in heart mitochondria from rats at various stages of development. These assays were conducted using our standard procedure in which carnitine was present at a concentration of 200 μM. It is seen that the activity of CPT I (measured in intact mitochondria) remained at its prepartum level until 2 days after birth. Over the next 5 days the value rose by ∼50% and remained constant out to the 29-day time point. By contrast, CPT II activity, measured in octyl glucoside-solubilized mitochondria, increased steadily throughout the course of development, reaching a value at day 29 that was almost 3 times that seen at day −1. The levels of both enzymes declined somewhat between day 29 and adulthood. 4The activities of CPT I and CPT II shown here cannot be compared in absolute terms, since the latter was measured in the presence of octyl glucoside, which might alter its kinetic properties. The CPT II component is not considered further here. The data for CPT I shown in Fig. 1 do not discriminate between the two isoforms of the enzyme, M and L, previously shown to be expressed in adult rat heart (16Weis B.C. Esser V. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18712-18715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Weis B.C. Cowan A.T. Brown N. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26443-26448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain qualitative insight into whether the ratio of these isozymes might vary during development we made use of the irreversible inhibitor, [3H]etomoxir, which, in its CoA ester form, interacts covalently with both proteins (causing complete inactivation) and thus serves as a radiolabeled tagging agent (16Weis B.C. Esser V. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18712-18715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Weis B.C. Cowan A.T. Brown N. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26443-26448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, heart mitochondria from juvenile and adult rats were exposed to [3H]etomoxir in the presence of ATP and CoASH, after which the membranes were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by fluorography. As seen from Fig. 2, both L- and M-CPT I were present at all stages of postnatal development. This was also true in late fetal tissue (results not shown). The important point is that the relative labeling intensity of the higher MrL-CPT I compared with the faster migrating M-CPT I can clearly be seen to diminish with increasing age of the litters. In order to quantify changes in the actual activities of the two CPT I isoforms, mitochondria were preincubated in the absence or presence of DNP-etomoxir (together with ATP and CoASH), a maneuver that completely inhibits L-CPT I while leaving the M variant unaffected (17Weis B.C. Cowan A.T. Brown N. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26443-26448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the Km of L-CPT I for carnitine is substantially lower than that of M-CPT I (30 versus 500 μM(18McGarry J.D. Mills S.E. Long C.S. Foster D.W. Biochem. J. 1983; 214: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar)) the presence of the former is more readily detected in assays conducted at low levels of this substrate (17Weis B.C. Cowan A.T. Brown N. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26443-26448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, a concentration of 20 μM was chosen for the studies illustrated in Fig. 3. As seen in panel A, while DNP-etomoxir caused ∼23% inhibition of CPT I activity in adult hearts, this value was in the region of 70-75% in late fetal and newborn animals and fell progressively with postnatal development. The actual activity of each CPT I isoform under these assay conditions is seen in panel B, which reveals their distinct developmental profiles. Over the first month postpartum the level of M-CPT I rises rapidly and changes little thereafter. L-CPT I displays the converse pattern. All of the assays in the experiment of Fig. 3 were repeated using 10 μM carnitine. Qualitatively similar results were obtained, although, as expected, the percentage of inhibition of CPT I activity by DNP-etomoxir at each time point was even more pronounced (data not shown). Based on the measured activity of the two CPT I isoforms at 10 and 20 μM carnitine (Fig. 3) and on the known Km value of each adult enzyme for this substrate (see above), it is possible, using the Michaelis-Menten equation, to transform the data into a Vmax format if it is assumed (not unreasonably) that throughout development the Km of each enzyme remains unchanged. The picture obtained is shown in Fig. 4. It is seen that the combined maximal capacity of L-CPT I plus M-CPT I rises from ∼20 to 45 nmol ˙ min−1 ˙ mg of protein−1 during the suckling period and falls back to ∼30 nmol ˙ min−1 ˙ mg of protein−1 in adult animals. This is accompanied by a marked change in the contribution of L-CPT I to overall enzyme activity, the value being ∼20-25% in the perinatal stage and declining to ∼2-3% in the adult heart. Since changes in the cellular structure of cardiac muscle are also occurring in the neonatal period (25Jones C.T. Rolph T.P. Physiol. Rev. 1985; 65: 357-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), the possibility that the high level of L-CPT I detected during this time (FIG. 1, FIG. 2, FIG. 3-4) derived from non-myocyte cell types had to be considered. We therefore prepared myocytes that were >90% in purity from 7-day-old and adult hearts. The cells were then broken (under conditions that maintained mitochondrial integrity); incubated with DNP-etomoxir, ATP, and CoASH; and subsequently assayed for CPT I at 20 μM carnitine. In two separate experiments the percentage of inhibition of enzyme activity by the etomoxir derivative was 44.6 and 50.2 in 7-day-old cells and 19.4 and 24.2 in adult cells. These values are very similar to those obtained with mitochondria isolated from whole heart tissue (Fig. 3 A), lending confidence that the changing ratio of L- to M-CPT I observed in the experiments of FIG. 1, FIG. 2, FIG. 3-4 did indeed reflect events in the cardiac myocyte itself. In light of the fact that the L- and M-isoforms of CPT I have such different affinities for carnitine (but similar Km values for palmitoyl-CoA (26Mills S.E. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. Biochem. J. 1984; 219: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar)), it follows that the contribution of each enzyme to the process of fatty acid oxidation in the developing heart will be a function not only of its relative abundance but also of the tissue carnitine concentration at any given time. To explore this matter further we measured both the total 5The term “total carnitine” does not include long chain acylcarnitines. These are removed during perchloric acid treatment of the tissue and, in any event, ordinarily make up only a small fraction of the total carnitine pool. and free carnitine content of the heart throughout the course of development (Fig. 5). The data for total carnitine are very similar to those reported by us earlier (19Robles-Valdes C. McGarry J.D. Foster D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6007-6012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and reaffirm the fact that this is low in the fetal heart and rises rapidly in the postnatal period. A similar profile was found with regard to free (unesterified) carnitine, although at all time points between days −1 and +29 it represented less than half of the total pool. Both free and total carnitine increased further between the 29-day-old and adult stage of life. By dividing the values for free carnitine in nmol/g, wet weight, of tissue by 0.7 (to obtain an approximation of the cytosolic carnitine concentration in μM) and combining these with the data of Fig. 4 (showing the percentage of contribution of each CPT I isoform to total enzyme activity) it is possible, again using the Michaelis-Menten equation, to estimate the relative functional contribution of L-CPT I to overall cardiac fatty acid oxidation in the developing rat. The composite data are shown in Fig. 6. The key finding is that in the immediate newborn period the calculated fraction of total fatty acid flux through the β-oxidation pathway of heart mitochondria that is supported by L-CPT I approaches 60%. This value falls sharply during suckling as the relative expression of L-CPT I diminishes and the tissue carnitine content rises, the majority of theoretical flux shifting to the high Km M-CPT I, which itself is increasing in expression over this time frame. In the adult rat, ∼96% of CPT I catalysis would be predicted to occur via the muscle isoform.FIG. 6Theoretical contribution of L-CPT I to overall CPT I flux in the developing rat heart. Results are expressed as the percentage of CPT I flux estimated to occur via L-CPT I. Derivation of data is detailed under “Results.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The present study was prompted by our recent observation that the adult rat heart expresses both liver and muscle isoforms of mitochondrial CPT I (16Weis B.C. Esser V. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18712-18715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Weis B.C. Cowan A.T. Brown N. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26443-26448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we have explored the development of the cardiac CPT enzymes with emphasis on the distribution of the two CPT I variants. Early reports had described a major increase in CPT activity in rat heart during the postnatal period (27Wittels B. Bressler R. J. Clin. Invest. 1965; 44: 1639-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 28Warshaw J.B. Dev. Biol. 1972; 28: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, at the time of those studies the complexities of the CPT system were not as well understood than they are now, and the assay procedures employed did not adequately discriminate between the CPT I and CPT II components. By carrying out the CPT measurements in intact and octyl glucoside-solubilized mitochondria it is now possible to make this distinction (21Woeltje K.F. Kuwajima M. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9822-9827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using this methodology it is evident that while the specific activity of both CPT I and CPT II increases between the time of birth and weaning there is a greater -fold change for CPT II (∼3) compared with CPT I (∼1.5). It should be noted, however, that the mitochondrial content of the heart cells is also increasing during this period (25Jones C.T. Rolph T.P. Physiol. Rev. 1985; 65: 357-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), which would exaggerate the changes in CPT I and CPT II levels when data are expressed on a per gram of tissue basis. The most striking aspect of the experiment depicted in Fig. 1 is the marked change in the ratio of CPT II to CPT I when assays are performed at our standard carnitine concentration of 200 μM. The data of Fig. 1, however, do not describe the situation fully, since the activity noted for CPT I represents the sum of two kinetically different components, the L and M isoforms of the enzyme. We took two approaches to examining the apparent CPT I profile more closely by analyzing the contribution of each variant to total CPT I activity. Using [3H]etomoxir to label both proteins, fluorographic analysis revealed that they do not follow identical paths of developmental expression. The results with adult heart confirmed our previous finding (16Weis B.C. Esser V. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18712-18715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Weis B.C. Cowan A.T. Brown N. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26443-26448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that both L- and M-CPT I are present but that the former is a very minor constituent. In contrast, the relative intensity of the L-CPT I signal was clearly seen to be higher in the perinatal period. Quantification of the catalytic activity of each isoform was achieved by the use of DNP-etomoxir, which selectively inhibits the liver enzyme (17Weis B.C. Cowan A.T. Brown N. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26443-26448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Three important points emerged. First, it could now been seen that the sum of the Vmax for total CPT I increased only ∼2-fold between days 1 and 29 after birth, returning to an intermediate value in the adult rat. Second, the Vmax capacity of L-CPT I remained fairly consistent from the time of birth to weaning and then fell by a factor of ∼3 as the animals reached maturity, in keeping with the fluorographic data alluded to above. Importantly, however, the contribution of L-CPT I to total enzyme activity in Vmax terms was as high as 25% in the perinatal period, falling precipitously during suckling and to its low point of ∼2-3% in the adult rat. Third, this change in the ratio of L- to M-CPT I in the developing heart was shown to be a characteristic of the cardiac myocytes themselves and not of non-myocyte cell type(s). To gain some appreciation of what these findings might mean as regards the quantitative contribution of L-CPT I to cardiac fatty acid oxidation in the developing rat, the data must be viewed in the context of the carnitine content of the heart at any given stage of life. We had previously shown that total (free plus esterified) carnitine levels in rat heart are low at birth and increase rapidly during the suckling period (19Robles-Valdes C. McGarry J.D. Foster D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6007-6012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we confirm this finding and extend it to the status of the free carnitine pool, which is also seen to be very low at birth, rising some 5-fold during suckling and by a further 3-fold in adult animals. When the changes in carnitine concentration are considered together with the shifting ratio of L- to M-CPT I, it can be estimated that the functional contribution of L-CPT I to overall cardiac CPT flux, while only ∼4% in the adult rat, is almost 60% in 1-day-old pups. Whereas in the adult animal carnitine is largely synthesized in liver (both de novo and from butyrobetaine supplied from skeletal muscle), the major source of this material for the newborn rat is the mother's milk (19Robles-Valdes C. McGarry J.D. Foster D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6007-6012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This may provide a teleological explanation for the high expression of L-CPT I in the neonatal heart. After birth, the animal's diet is rich in fat (derived from maternal milk), and fatty acids, presumably together with ketone bodies, represent important energy sources for heart function (19Robles-Valdes C. McGarry J.D. Foster D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6007-6012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the M isoform of CPT I would be unable to operate efficiently at this time, since sufficient carnitine has not yet accumulated in the tissue. A transient high expression of the low Km L-CPT I would provide a mechanism for fatty acylcarnitine synthesis despite the low tissue content of carnitine. As suckling continues and the heart carnitine pool expands, the L form of CPT I gradually disappears, with concomitant increased expression of the high Km M variant, which then becomes the near exclusive vehicle for initiating the fatty acid oxidation process. In Fig. 6 we have provided a theoretical estimate of the contribution of L-CPT I to cardiac fatty acid oxidation as the rat pup matures. It must be emphasized that nonideal kinetic behavior of the CPT I isozymes with regard to substrates, as well as subcellular compartmentation of the latter, would influence the actual values, but the trend is solidly apparent. The presence of L-CPT I in rat heart might also have relevance to the still puzzling question of how fatty acid oxidation can ever proceed in cardiac tissue given the fact that its content of malonyl-CoA has been found to fluctuate between ∼1 and 4 nmol/g, wet weight, under various conditions (18McGarry J.D. Mills S.E. Long C.S. Foster D.W. Biochem. J. 1983; 214: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 29Awan M.M. Saggerson E.D. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 30Lopaschuk G.D. Witters L.A. Itoi T. Barr R. Barr A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25871-25878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that M-CPT I displays such a low I50 value for the inhibitor (∼0.03 μM). Presumably, most of the cellular malonyl-CoA is in a bound state and unavailable for interaction with CPT I. The additional possibility is now raised that expression of some L-CPT I, whose I50 for malonyl-CoA is 100-fold higher than that of M-CPT I (18McGarry J.D. Mills S.E. Long C.S. Foster D.W. Biochem. J. 1983; 214: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), may permit fatty acid oxidation to occur at a basal level even if the free concentration of malonyl-CoA were to rise into an inhibitory range for the muscle enzyme. In the rabbit, the heart content of malonyl-CoA has been reported to decrease after birth in association with a lowered activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and acceleration of fatty acid oxidation (30Lopaschuk G.D. Witters L.A. Itoi T. Barr R. Barr A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25871-25878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A greater expression of L-CPT I in the perinatal period (if indeed this applies to rabbit myocardium) would presumably offset the higher malonyl-CoA level and allow fatty acid oxidation to occur at a measurable rate. 6If the carnitine content of rabbit myocardium also increases during postnatal development this would obviously make an additional contribution to the enhancement in fatty acid oxidation capacity observed by Lopaschuk et al. (30Lopaschuk G.D. Witters L.A. Itoi T. Barr R. Barr A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25871-25878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the present work adds CPT I to the growing list of proteins known to undergo isoform switching during cardiac development (25Jones C.T. Rolph T.P. Physiol. Rev. 1985; 65: 357-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), we do not yet understand which signals are responsible for the phenomenon. Some regulatory factors must exist that are specific to cardiac tissue. While the L-CPT I level in the heart changes little during the first 48 h after birth (Fig. 4), expression of the enzyme in liver rises 4-fold during this time (31Thumelin S. Esser V. Charvy D. Kolodziej M. Zammit V.A. McGarry D. Girard J. Pegorier J.-P. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 583-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Conversely, whereas hepatic expression of CPT II remains constant in the neonatal period (31Thumelin S. Esser V. Charvy D. Kolodziej M. Zammit V.A. McGarry D. Girard J. Pegorier J.-P. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 583-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the present study shows a substantial up-regulation in the heart. The differential response of the two tissues likely involves dietary components and changes in circulating hormone levels. The intriguing possibility exists that carnitine itself plays a role, in light of the fact that its concentration in liver and heart changes reciprocally in the neonatal rat (Ref. 19Robles-Valdes C. McGarry J.D. Foster D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6007-6012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and Fig. 5). It remains to be established whether skeletal muscle also expresses some L-CPT I at an early age, since carnitine levels in this tissue would also be predicted to be low at birth. Apart from liver, heart, and, as recently documented, fibroblasts (14Britton C.H. Schultz R.A. Zhang B. Esser V. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1984-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), the range of tissues expressing L-CPT I is not known. However, we suspect that kidney and the pancreatic β-cell fall into this category. 7N. F. Brown, B. C. Weis, J. E. Husti, D. W. Foster, and J. D. McGarry, unpublished observations. Nor has it been established at this juncture that the changing pattern of cardiac CPT I isoforms noted here in the developing rat has a parallel in humans (although we have detected both L and M forms of CPT I in adult human heart mitochondria labeled with [3H]etomoxir). If it does, it could have important implications for individuals with the homozygous form of the so-called “hepatic” CPT deficiency syndrome where CPT I has been found to be deficient both in liver and fibroblasts (32Demaugre F. Bonnefont J.-P. Mitchell G. Nguyen-Hoang N. Pelet A. Rimoldi M. DiDonato S. Saudubray J.-M. Pediatr. Res. 1988; 24: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The classic symptoms emphasized to date have been severe hypoketotic hypoglycemia during episodes of starvation in infancy, sometimes resulting in death (33Saudubray J.-M. Mitchell G. Bonnefont J.-P. Schwartz G. Nuttin C. Munnich A. Brivet M. Vassault A. Demaugre F. Rabier D. Charpentier C. Coates P.M. Tanaka K. New Developments in Fatty Acid Oxidation. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1992: 271-288Google Scholar). Is it possible that disturbances of heart and kidney function, both of which have been reported in such patients (34Bergman A.J.I.W. Donckerwolcke R.A.M.G. Duran M. Smeitink J.A.M. Mousson B. Vianey-Saban C. Poll-The B.T. Pediatr. Res. 1994; 36: 582-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), have resulted, at least in part, from diminished CPT I activity in these tissues? Finally, the fact that CPT I is now known to exist in at least two different forms (and possibly more) will need to be considered in the design of CPT I inhibitors should such agents be employed for therapeutic purposes."

This diverse action may result from differences in glucose transport and metabolism between the two cell types.

No other GLUT-like sequences were found among cDNAs from α- or β-cells. Both cell types expressed 43-kDa GLUT1 protein which was enhanced by culture. The 62-kDa β-cell GLUT2 protein was converted to a 58-kDa protein after trypsin treatment of the cells without detectable consequences upon glucose transport kinetics. In β-cells, the rates of glucose transport were 10-fold higher than in α-cells. In both cell types, glucose uptake exceeded the rates of glucose utilization by a factor of 10 or more. Glycolytic flux, measured as D-[53H]glucose utilization, was comparable in α- and β-cells between 1 and 10 mmol/liter substrate.

Mammalian glucose homeostasis is controlled by glucose sensor mechanisms in the endocrine pancreas which adjust release of insulin and glucagon to variations in extracellular glucose concentration (1Gerich J.E. Charles M.A. Grodsky G.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1974; 54: 833-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Experiments on isolated rodent islets of Langerhans indicate that glucose metabolism is necessary for β-cells to sense extracellular glucose (2Meglasson M.D. Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes Metab.

Both proteins are expressed in β-cells and hepatocytes, and their low affinity for glucose results in catalytic rates that are linearly dependent on the blood glucose concentration. GLUT2 gene expression is down-regulated in islets of several diabetic animal models (6Unger R.H. Science. 1991; 251: 1200-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 9Thorens B. Int. Rev.

Virtually no information is available on the glucose sensor in α-cells which represent 10% or less of the cell mass. The ability to purify α-cells from rat pancreata creates the possibility of investigating this cell type (14Pipeleers D.G. in't Veld P.A. Van De Winkel M. Maes E. Schuit F.C. Gepts W. Endocrinology. 1985; 117: 806-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Glucose inhibits glucagon release through a direct effect on α-cells (15Pipeleers D.G. Schuit F.C.

Glucose transport in α-cells is slower than in β-cells and therefore may qualify as a rate-limiting step for overall glucose metabolism (16Gorus F. Malaisse W.J. Pipeleers D. J. Biol.

This study compares purified rat α- and β-cell preparations for their kinetics of glucose transport and their metabolic flux through glycolysis. It investigates to which extent differences in glucose handling are caused by differential expression of glucose transporter genes. D-[5-3H]Glucose (21 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham (Bucks, United Kingdom); L-[1-3H]glucose (20 Ci/mmol), [14C]urea (56 mCi/mmol), and 3-[3H]OMG 1The abbreviations used are:3-OMG3- O-methylglucosekbkilobase pair(s). (79 Ci/mmol) from DuPont NEN. 3- O-methylglucose kilobase pair(s). Preparations of dispersed islet cells (20%α-cells and 65%β-cells), purified β-cells (>90% purity), isolated endocrine non-β-cells (>60%α-cells and <20%β-cells), and purified α-cells (>80%α-cells and <5%β-cells) were isolated from adult male Wistar rats using previously published methods (14Pipeleers D.G. in't Veld P.A. Van De Winkel M. Maes E. Schuit F.C. Gepts W. Endocrinology. 1985; 117: 806-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The purity of these preparations was routinely determined by immunocytochemistry and radioimmunoassays for insulin and glucagon. Cells were more than 90% viable as assessed by neutral red uptake (14Pipeleers D.G. in't Veld P.A. Van De Winkel M. Maes E. Schuit F.C. Gepts W. Endocrinology. 1985; 117: 806-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Mean intracellular space was 622 ± 48 and 270 ± 34 pl/103cells for β-cells (n = 5) and non-β-cells (n = 7), respectively. Dispersed islet cells, α-cells, non-β-cells, and β-cells were cultured for 16 h in Ham's F-10 medium, 1% bovine serum albumin, 2 mmol/liter glutamine, 50 μmol/liter isobutylmethylxanthine, and 6 mmol/liter glucose at 37°C (17Ling Z. Hannaert J.C. Pipeleers D. Diabetologia. 1994; 37: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Zero- trans-3-OMG uptake was measured at 15°C or 37°C using 1 mmol/liter [14C]urea (25 mCi/mmol) as an intracellular space marker and 2 mmol/liter L-[3H]glucose (200 mCi/mmol) to correct for contamination with extracellular volume (16Gorus F.

Chem. 1990; 265: 6548-6551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Initial rates of 3-OMG uptake were measured at 15 s for islet cells and β-cells (1 × 105cells per measurement) or at 1 min for non-β-cells (1.5 × 105cells per measurement). Uptake was stopped by the addition of 150 μl of ice-cold Earle's-Hepes buffer containing 50 mmol/liter glucose and 1 mmol/liter phloridzin and centrifuged through a 150-μl oil phase (4:1 dibutyl/dinonylphthalate). The bottom phase of the tubes was counted in liquid scintillation mixture. 3-OMG uptake was expressed per liter cellular volume after correction for the extracellular space. Apparent Vmax and Kmof glucose uptake were determined by Eadie-Hofstee plots with the best-fit lines drawn using the method of least squares. Glucose utilization was measured as the conversion of D-[5-3H]glucose into tritiated water using batches of 5 × 104cells and 2-h incubations at 37°C (see Ref. 19De Vos A. Schuit F.C. Malaisse W.J. Biochem. Int. 1991; 24: 117-121PubMed Google Scholar). Cellular metabolism was stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 0.4 mol/liter citrate buffer, pH 4.9, containing 5 mmol/liter KCN, 10 μmol/liter antimycin A, and 10 μmol/liter rotenone. Tritiated water production was measured via liquid scintillation counting. Total RNA was isolated from 106cells by microadaptation of the guanidinium isothiocyanate/cesium chloride method (20Rappolee D.A. Brenner C.A. Schultz R. Mark D. Werb Z. Science. 1988; 241: 1823-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar), separated according to its size on 1.5% agarose gels containing formaldehyde and transferred by capillary blot to nylon membranes (GeneScreen, Dupont NEN). Control RNAs were taken from tissues (brain, liver, and muscle) of the same rats as were used for β-cell preparation. The blots were UV-cross-linked and hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA probes (Megaprime, Amersham, Bucks, UK). Two stringent washings were done for 30 min in 0.2 × SSC and 2.5% SDS at 65°C. The intensity of the signals was scanned on an Ultroscan XL densitometer (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). Total RNA extracted from the control tissues and from 2.5 × 104β-cells or α-cells was reverse-transcribed in 50 mmol/liter Tris-Cl, pH 8.3, 40 mmol/liter KCl, 6 mmol/liter MgCl2, 1 mmol/liter dithiothreitol with 1 mmol/liter dNTP, 200 nmol/liter poly(dT), 50 units of RNase inhibitor, and 10 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase for 1 h at 42°C. The negative control contained no RNA. First strand cDNA was dialyzed on a 0.025-mm filter and amplified via polymerase chain reaction (21Saiki R.K. Scharf S. Faloona F. Mullis K. Horn G. Erlich H.A.

PCR products were controlled for their length on a 1.5% agarose gel. Gene-specific primers, recognizing sequences encoding the first extracellular and the third intracellular loop (22Mueckler M.

Mixed oligonucleotide primed amplification of cDNA (23Lee C.C. Wu X. Gibbs R.A. Cook R.C. Muzny D.M. Caskey T. Science. 1988; 239: 1288-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) was performed using two degenerate primer sets, 5′-primer set: 5′GG(A/T)GCC(C/T)TGGG(A/C)AC(A/C/T)CT(C/G/T)(C/A)ACCA (codon 154-161 of GLUT1) and 3′-primer set: 3′GTCGTC(G/A)A(C/G)AG(C/A/T)CC(G/T)TAGTTAC (codon 282-289 of GLUT1), yielding an amplified fragment of 406 base pairs. Polymerase chain reaction products were diluted (1/3, 1/10, and 1/20) and dot-blotted to nylon membranes that were hybridized with 5′-radiolabeled oligonucleotides complementary to isoform-specific sequences encoding parts of the third intracellular loop: GLUT1-3′CTTGGCCCGGTTCTCACACG (codon 221-228), GLUT4-3′CCCCGGACGGGCTTTCTCAG (codon 237-244), and GLUT2-3′TCAGTCCCGTTTCTTTTCGA (codon 251-258). After three washing steps (twice in 3 × SSC, 5% SDS at 50°C for 30 min and once in 1 × SSC, 1% SDS, at 50°C for 30 min), the hybridized membranes were exposed for autoradiography. To facilitate subcloning, EcoRI and XbaI restriction sites were included in all the 5′- and 3′-primers, respectively. Polymerase chain reaction-derived fragments were eluted from agarose gel and cloned in XbaI and EcoRI cut pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene). Clones were sequenced via the dideoxy method using modified T7 DNA polymerase (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). Protein blotting and analysis was performed as described before (5Thorens B. Sarkar H.K. Kaback H.R. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1988; 55: 281-290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar) with some minor adaptations. Cell and tissue samples were homogenized by sonication in 5% SDS, 5%β-mercaptoethanol, 80 mmol/liter Tris-Cl (pH 6.8), 5 mmol/liter EDTA, and 10% glycerol in the presence of 1 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Homogenates were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were incubated with anti-GLUT1 (1/1000) or anti-GLUT2 (1/4000) for 60 min at room temperature. The second antibody (anti-rabbit peroxidase) was incubated at room temperature for 50 min. Peroxidase activity was detected via chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham, Bucks, UK). The intensity of the signals was quantified via laser densitometry. Initial rates of zero- trans-3- O-methylglucose (3-OMG) uptake in islet cells, purified islet β-cells, and non-β-cells were measured at 15°C to slow down the process sufficiently for accurate calculations (Fig. 1). In islet cells, uptake approached saturation at 40 mmol/liter substrate (Fig. 1 a). Transformation of the data into Eadie-Hofstee plots (Fig. 1 b) and calculation of the least squares fit for either a one- or a two-component model revealed that the latter was more adequate (p < 0.05). A predominant kinetic component (Km= 16 mmol/liter; Vmax = 11 mmol/min/liter) was distinguished from a second component with apparent Km= 3 mmol/liter and Vmax = 3 mmol/min/liter. Uptake of 3-OMG in purified β-cells was not saturated at 40 mmol/liter substrate (Fig. 1 c). In contrast to dispersed islet cells, Eadie-Hofstee transformation of data from pure β-cells showed only one component of transport with Vmax = 14 mmol/min/liter and Km= 18 mmol/liter (Fig. 1 d). Transport in islet non-β-cells was at least one order of magnitude slower than that measured in β-cells and dose dependently increased between 1 and 15 mmol/liter 3-OMG (Fig. 1 e). Kinetic analysis of 3-OMG transport in endocrine non-β-cells revealed one component with Km= 8.5 mmol/liter and Vmax = 0.8 mmol/min/liter (Fig. 1 f). Initial velocities of 3-OMG transport were compared with overall rates of glycolysis in pure β- and non-β-cells (Table I). Data were expressed per liter of intracellular space to compensate for the differences in cell size between both cell populations. In contrast to β-cells, 3-OMG uptake in non-β-cells was slow enough to be measured at 37°C, so that direct comparison with glucose utilization was feasible. Rates of glucose utilization increased proportionally to the extracellular substrate concentration between 1 and 10 mmol/liter substrate and were virtually identical in β- and non-β-cells (Table I). On the contrary, 3-OMG uptake was approximately 10 times faster in β-cells than in non-β-cells. Despite the fact that transport was measured at a lower temperature than utilization, rates of 3-OMG uptake in pure β-cells exceeded the corresponding rates of glucose utilization at least by one order of magnitude (Table I). In non-β-cells, the increase from 15°C to 37°C accelerated 3-OMG transport 3- to 6-fold, resulting in a mean calculated Q10 value of approximately 2. Glucose transport in non-β-cells was between 8 and 9 times more rapid than overall glucose utilization, both at 5 and 10 mmol/liter substrate (Table I).Table I:Glucose uptake and glucose utilization in β- and non-β-cellsData represent mean values ± S.E. of (n) independent experiments. ND, not determined. Data represent mean values ± S.E. of (n) independent experiments. ND, not determined. GLUT1 cDNA hybridized with a 2.8-kb transcript in both α- and β-cells (Fig. 2). The ratio of GLUT1 mRNA over β-actin mRNA was higher in β-cells than in α-cells. Hybridization of β-cell RNA with a GLUT2 cDNA probe resulted in detection of two transcripts, one of 2.8 kb that was relatively abundant and also found in liver, and one of 3.9 kb that was found in β-cells but not in liver. No GLUT2 expression was detected in α-cells. GLUT4 was not transcribed in α-cells or in β-cells (data not shown). Isoform-specific oligonucleotide primers were used to amplify reverse-transcribed mRNA from α- and β-cells. Amplification of control cDNAs from brain, liver, and muscle resulted in DNA fragments of expected length (data not shown). While GLUT1 sequences were detected in all cDNA mixtures, GLUT2 and GLUT4 sequences were present only in liver and muscle cDNAs, respectively (data not shown). The partial sequences obtained from purified islet cells were identical with previously published sequences: β-cells contained GLUT1 and GLUT2 sequences and α-cells contained GLUT1 and no GLUT2 sequences (data not shown). To investigate whether new members of the GLUT family were present, we performed mixed oligonucleotide primed amplification of cDNA (23Lee C.C. Wu X. Gibbs R.A. Cook R.C. Muzny D.M. Caskey T. Science. 1988; 239: 1288-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) with degenerate primer sets recognizing highly conserved sequences of the GLUT family (22Mueckler M. Caruso C. Baldwin S.A. Panico M. Blench I. Morris H.R. Allard W.J. Lienhard G.E. Lodish H.F. Science. 1985; 229: 941-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar). Amplified cDNA was concentrated in a single ethidium bromide-stained band with the expected fragment length (data not shown). Dot blots of the polymerase chain reaction products were hybridized with oligonucleotide probes specific for GLUT1, GLUT2, and GLUT4 sequences (15% overall identity). This method was validated on amplified mRNA from brain (GLUT1-positive), liver (GLUT2-positive), and muscle (GLUT4-positive; Fig. 3). From brain mRNA, a fragment was amplified that reproducibly hybridized with the GLUT4-specific oligoprobe. In purified β-cells, GLUT1-cDNA was detected reproducibly, but the predominant glucose transporter was GLUT2. Amplified cDNA from α-cells was only positive for GLUT1 (Fig. 3). When the amplified DNA fragments were cloned and sequenced, both GLUT1 and GLUT2 sequences were found in β-cells (1 GLUT1 clone for 100 GLUT2 clones), while the obtained α-cell cDNA fragments contained GLUT1 sequences (10% of all clones), or sequences that were not homologous to any protein present in the PIR (Protein Identification Resource, Washington D. C.) or Swiss-prot data banks (remaining clones; data not shown). Translation products of the described mRNAs were studied via Western blotting (Fig. 4). Positive control tissues showed the expected 40-kDa band for brain GLUT1 and 62-kDa band for liver GLUT2. Isolated β-cells were weakly positive for GLUT1 and strongly positive for GLUT2 immunoreactivity (Fig. 4). The GLUT1 protein appeared larger in β-cells (approximately 43 kDa) than in brain. GLUT2 immunoreactivity was distributed over an intense band of approximately 58 kDa and a much weaker ≈62-kDa band (Fig. 4). In α-cell preparations with 3-fold more cells, only weak GLUT1 and GLUT2 signals were detected. The ratio of GLUT1 over GLUT2 abundance in α-cells was 60-fold higher than in β-cells. Therefore, the GLUT2 signal in α-cells probably originates from contaminating β-cells, while the GLUT1 signal can be considered as α-cell-specific. In β-cells cultured for 16 h in serum-free medium complemented with 6 mmol/liter glucose, GLUT1 protein was 4-fold more abundant than in freshly isolated β-cells (Fig. 4). A comparable induction of GLUT1 expression by culture in 6 mmol/liter glucose was observed in α-cells. We then investigated whether the molecular heterogeneity of GLUT2 protein was correlated to the rate of glucose uptake. The ratio of the densitometric intensities of the ≈62-kDa versus the 58-kDa band was 10-fold lower in freshly isolated β-cells (0.09 ± 0.05) than in 16-h cultured β-cells (0.90 ± 0.10; p < 0.005; n = 3) (Fig. 5, lanes 1 and 2). This was not influenced by adding the trypsin inhibitor antipain (3 mg/ml) to the culture medium (Fig. 5, lane 3). Incubation of cultured β-cells with trypsin (3 mg/ml, 10 min, 37°C) resulted in a rapid disappearance of the 62-kDa band (Fig. 5, lane 4); this effect did not occur when antipain was present during trypsin exposure (Fig. 5, lane 5). Freshly isolated islet cells exhibited only the 58-kDa GLUT2 protein (Fig. 5, lane 6), but after 16 h of culture only 62-kDa GLUT2 immunoreactivity was found (Fig. 5, lane 7). As for isolated β-cells, short trypsin treatment of cultured islet cells shifted the 62-kDa GLUT2 isoform to the 58-kDa isoform (Fig. 5, lane 8). The untreated and trypsin-treated cultured islet cell preparations, with, respectively, 62-kDa and 58-kDa GLUT2 protein, were compared for their glucose uptake kinetics, using the two-component model. Both preparations displayed low and high Kmuptake with similar kinetic characteristics (Table II).Table II:Effect of trypsin on 3-O-methylglucose transport kinetics of islet cellsTable II:Effect of trypsin on 3-O-methylglucose transport kinetics of islet cellsApparent Vmax and Kmwere determined by Eadie-Hofstee plot of the mean values from five independent experiments with the best-fit lines drawn using the method of least squares. Apparent Vmax and Kmwere determined by Eadie-Hofstee plot of the mean values from five independent experiments with the best-fit lines drawn using the method of least squares. The present study confirms (18Johnson J.H. Newgard C.B. Milburn J.L. Lodish H.F. Thorens B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6548-6551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the kinetics of glucose uptake by unpurified islet cells is characterized by two components, one with a high Kmand high Vmax, the other with a low Kmand low Vmax. Analysis of glucose transport in purified β- and non-β-cells indicates that the high Kmcomponent is a feature of the β-cells. The low Kmcomponent is, however, not recovered in one of the two purified preparations, which suggests its association with islet cells, which are not selected during the purification procedure. Alternatively, low Kmglucose uptake does occur in islet β-cells, but the absence of non-β-cells alters the intrinsic activity of the expressed glucose transporters, for instance by altering their phosphorylation/dephosphorylation state. The preparation of endocrine non-β-cells displayed glucose transport with low capacity and intermediate affinity compared to the low Vmax /low Kmtransport observed in islet cells. Our data do not exclude that high affinity glucose transporters are expressed in non-β-cells and that their intrinsic activity and affinity for glucose are dependent on β-cell factors. Isolated β-cells transcribe the GLUT1 gene and express the protein. The GLUT1 protein was more abundant after overnight culture at 6 mmol/liter glucose, which is compatible with previous data on isolated islets (24Tal M. Liang Y. Najafi H. Lodish H.F. Matschinsky F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17241-17247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Tal M. Thorens B. Surana M. Fleischer N. Lodish H.F. Hanahan D. Efrat S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 422-432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accumulation of GLUT1 through decreased protein degradation at 6 mmol/liter glucose has been proposed as part of the glucose sensing mechanism in fibroblasts (26Haspel H.C. Wilk E.W. Birnbaum M.J. Cushman S.W. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6778-6789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but its biological relevance for β-cells remains elusive. It is for instance conceivable that GLUT1 is a stress protein (27Wertheimer E. Sasson S. Cerasi E. Ben-Neriah Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2525-2529Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) which becomes more abundant during culture at low glucose levels. Since the β-cell GLUT1 protein has not yet been detected in situ, it is possible that its expression was induced by the isolation procedure and maintained in cell culture. Whether this phenomenon influences glucose uptake has not been investigated. At both the mRNA and protein level, GLUT2 was the major glucose transporter in isolated β-cells. The GLUT2(-like) mRNA occurred as a 2.8-kb and a 3.9-kb transcript. The cDNA corresponding to the 2.8-kb mRNA has been cloned (5Thorens B. Sarkar H.K. Kaback H.R. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1988; 55: 281-290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar), but the sequence and significance of the larger transcript is not yet known. GLUT2 protein also displayed molecular heterogeneity, immunoblots reproducibly revealing proteins of 58 and ≈62 kDa. The 62-kDa protein can be rapidly converted to the 58-kDa form by proteolytic cleavage, indicating that the enzymatic procedures of islet isolation and cell preparation may have caused the appearance of the lower molecular weight form. Proteolytic cleavage occurs in the first extracellular loop of GLUT2 (28Thorens B. Gérard N. Dériaz N. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1687-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). By combining functional and molecular measurements, we have now shown that shifts between the 62- and 58-kDa forms do not affect the glucose transport kinetics of β-cells. Our data support the view that residues in the carboxyl-terminal region of GLUT2 determine its kinetic properties for glucose uptake (29Katagiri H. Asano T. Ishihara H. Tsukuda K. Lin J.L. Inukai K. Kikuchi M. Yazaki Y. Oka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22550-22555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They also indicate that the two components of glucose uptake in dispersed islet cells cannot be attributed to heterogeneity in GLUT2 protein. Recovery of the large GLUT2 isoform was more complete after culture of unpurified islet cell preparations than of pure β-cells; it was also enhanced by culture at 20 mmol/liter glucose (data not shown). The presence of endocrine non-β-cells may add to the regulation of GLUT2 gene expression by the β-cells. The glucose effect is probably caused by increased de novo synthesis, since glucose is known to increase GLUT2 gene expression (30Chen L. Alam T. Johnson J.H. Hughes S. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4088-4092Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Endocrine islet non-β-cells did not exhibit specific GLUT2 expression, but they contained both GLUT1 mRNA and protein albeit at low abundance. Preparations with more than 80%α-cells (14Pipeleers D.G. in't Veld P.A. Van De Winkel M. Maes E. Schuit F.C. Gepts W. Endocrinology. 1985; 117: 806-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) also exhibited these GLUT1 signals, suggesting their association with α-cells. Contamination with non-α-cells is still present, but we consider it unlikely that this explains the GLUT1 signals for the following reasons: (a) preparations highly enriched in α-cells were negative or very weakly positive for GLUT2, excluding a major contamination with β-cells; (b) cell culture which leads to selective loss of contaminating exocrine cells did not result in loss of GLUT1 expression in α-cell preparations; and (c) amplification of cDNA from α-cells resulted in GLUT-nucleotide sequences that were identical with GLUT1. So far, GLUT1 protein has not been detected in α-cells by immunocytochemical staining (24Tal M. Liang Y. Najafi H. Lodish H.F. Matschinsky F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17241-17247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but this may be related to the sensitivity limit of this technique. Since we sequenced only 15% of the GLUT1 sequence, the glucose transporter in α-cells may be a GLUT1-related protein, with a specific amino- or carboxyl-terminal region, but cross-reacting on Western blots with an antibody directed against the carboxyl terminus of GLUT1. It has been proposed that insulin plays a permissive role for glucose-induced inhibition of glucagon secretion (31Greenbaum C.J. Havel P.J. Taborsky G.J. Klaff L.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 767-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We therefore screened α-cell RNA for the presence of sequences homologous to the insulin-responsive glucose transporter GLUT4. No GLUT4 sequences were found, which is compatible with the previous observation that insulin does not stimulate glucose transport rates in α-cells (16Gorus F. Malaisse W.J. Pipeleers D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1196-1200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The absence of low Km3-OMG transport in GLUT1-positive β-cells may be explained by cryptic expression of the GLUT1 gene, but this seems unlikely, since GLUT1 protein has been localized in the plasma membrane of cultured islet β-cells (24Tal M. Liang Y. Najafi H. Lodish H.F. Matschinsky F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17241-17247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Tal M. Thorens B. Surana M. Fleischer N. Lodish H.F. Hanahan D. Efrat S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 422-432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, rates of glucose uptake via GLUT1 in β-cells may be too low to detect under conditions of simultaneously elevated rates of high Km/high Vmax transport via GLUT2. Rat pancreatic β-cells display metabolic and functional heterogeneity in terms of glucose responsiveness (32Pipeleers D.G. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 777-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The possibility that β-cell subpopulations with different sensitivity for glucose differ in glucose transporter gene expression has been excluded (10Heimberg H. De Vos A. Vandercammen A. Van Schaftingen E. Pipeleers D. Schuit F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2873-2879Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Indeed, virtually all insulin-positive islet cells also contain membrane-bound GLUT2 immunoreactivity in islet sections (24Tal M. Liang Y. Najafi H. Lodish H.F. Matschinsky F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17241-17247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GLUT1 and GLUT2 may be expressed on the same β-cells at a different subcellular localization, for instance GLUT2 at the afferent pole (glucose sensor) and GLUT1 at the basal pole (33Mueckler M. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 6-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Increased GLUT2 immunoreactivity in the microvillous compartment of β-cells supports this concept (34Orci L. Thorens B. Ravazzola M. Lodish H.F. Science. 1989; 245: 295-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Subcellular immunodetection of GLUT1 and GLUT2 in β-cells by electron microscopy will be required to further examine this possibility. Comparison of overall flux via glucose utilization and 3-OMG uptake is possible since both processes were studied under the same experimental conditions and since the kinetic constants for glucose uptake and 3-OMG uptake are similar (35Gould G.W. Thomas H.M. Jess T.J. Bell G.I. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5139-5145Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In pure rat β-cells, glucose uptake is such a rapid process that its rate largely exceeds that of glycolysis even when measured at low temperatures. Abundant expression of GLUT2 renders the plasma membrane almost freely permeable to glucose, permitting the cytoplasmic glucose sensor to measure minute-to-minute variations in the extracellular glucose concentration. In α-cells, absence of GLUT2 and low expression of GLUT1 result in glucose uptake rates which are 10-fold lower than in β-cells, but they are still 10-fold higher than overall metabolic flux, strongly suggesting that transport in this cell type is not rate-limiting for overall glucose metabolism. It has been proposed that some glucose transporter isoforms may influence the process of glucose sensing via nonmetabolic properties, such as the structural organization of sensor proteins close to or in the plasma membrane (7Hughes S.D. Quaade C. Johnson J.H. Ferber S. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15205-15212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, enzymatic steps distal to glucose transport may be more directly responsible for glucose sensing in rat α- and β-cells. We thank Erik Quartier for his excellent technical assistance, the personnel of the Dept. of Endocrinology and Metabolism for islet cell purification, and Dr. L. Kaufman for statistical advice. We gratefully acknowledge Dr. M. Birnbaum, Harvard Medical School, for providing the rat GLUT1 cDNA."
https://openalex.org/W2003558962,"The NH2-terminal region of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) is highly conserved across species, having two disulfide bridges that cause the formation of an amphipathic hairpin loop structure between the 2nd and 3rd cysteine residues (Cys8to Cys20). The role that the NH2-terminal region of pro-opiomelanocortin plays in acting as a molecular sorting signal for the regulated secretory pathway was investigated by using site-directed mutagenesis either to disrupt one or more of the disulfide bridges or to delete the amphipathic loop entirely. When POMC was expressed in Neuro-2a cells, ACTH immunoreactive material was localized in punctate secretory granules in the cell body and along the neurites, with heavy labeling at the tips. ACTH was secreted from these POMC-transfected cells in a regulated manner. Disruption of both disulfide bridges or the second disulfide bridge or removal of the amphipathic hairpin loop resulted in constitutive secretion of the mutant POMC from the cells and a lack of punctate secretory granule immunostaining within the cells. We have modeled the NH2-terminal POMC Cys8to Cys20domain and have identified it as an amphipathic loop containing four highly conserved hydrophobic and acidic amino acid residues (Asp10-Leu11-Glu14-Leu18). Thus the sorting signal for POMC to the regulated secretory pathway appears to be encoded by a specific conformational motif comprised of a 13-amino acid amphipathic loop structure stabilized by a disulfide bridge, located at the NH2terminus of the molecule.

Endocrine cells and peptidergic neurons contain a regulated secretory pathway, in addition to the “default” constitutive secretory pathway present in all cells (1Brownstein M.J. Russell J.T. Gainer H. Science. 1980; 207: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Prohormones and proneuropeptides are intracellularly routed through the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus to the trans-Golgi network (2Kelly R.B.

In the trans-Golgi network they are actively sorted away from other proteins and packaged into the granules of the regulated secretory pathway where they are proteolytically processed to biologically active peptides that are released from the cell upon stimulation (6Schnabel E.

The nature of the sorting signal involved in directing prohormones and proneuropeptides to these regulated secretory granules has not been determined, because no consensus amino acid sequences have been found. The adrenocorticotropin/endorphin prohormone pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) 1The abbreviations used are:POMCpro-opiomelanocortinN-POMCNH2-terminal POMCACTHadrenocorticotropic hormoneACTHiACTH immunoreactive materialHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatography. is representative of a class of prohormones that is directed to the regulated secretory pathway in neuroendocrine cells (8Burgess T.L.

Other members of this class of prohormones include pro-enkephalin, pro-vasopressin, pro-dynorphin, and pro-oxytocin, all of which have in common in their primary amino acid sequence one or more pairs of cysteine residues that may form a disulfide bridge and thus a hairpin loop structure in their NH2-terminal regions (Fig. 1 A). For example, in POMC the first 26 amino acids contain 4 cysteine residues that are highly conserved (Fig. 1 A) (12Douglass J. Civelli O. Herbert E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 665-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) and have been experimentally shown to form a hairpin loop stabilized by two disulfide bridges (Cys2/Cys24 and Cys8/Cys20) (13Bennett H.P.J.

Recent work in our laboratory (14Tam W.H.H. Andreasson K.A. Loh Y.P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 62: 294-306PubMed Google Scholar) has demonstrated that the NH2-terminal hairpin loop consisting of 26 amino acids of POMC was sufficient for targeting a non-native protein, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, to the regulated secretory pathway in AtT20 cells. However, the first 10 amino acids of NH2-terminal POMC, which lacked the formation of the hairpin loop, were insufficient for sorting chloramphenicol acetyltransferase to the regulated secretory pathway. These data suggested that residues 1-26 contained information necessary for sorting POMC to the regulated secretory pathway. In this study, site-directed mutagenesis was used to identify the specific molecular motif within N-POMC encoding this sorting signal. A unique 13-amino acid amphipathic loop structure, stabilized by one disulfide bridge, at the NH2terminus of POMC was identified as the signal essential for the sorting of this prohormone into the regulated secretory pathway of the mouse neuroendocrine cell line, Neuro-2a. Bovine POMC cDNA (kindly donated by Dr. S. Nakanishi) was subcloned into the cloning vector, dsM13p18 (15Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Using an Amersham mutagenesis system (version 2, RPN 1523), substitution mutations were made by annealing the ssM13-POMC to a 39-nucleotide probe complementary to positions 72-111 in POMC. The probe contained glycine-to-cysteine mutations in position 82, 101, or both, and after annealing was treated with DNA polymerase (Klenow fragment) and T4-ligase to convert the hybrid to dsM13-POMC. The non-mutant strand was nicked with NciI, digested with exonuclease III, and polymerized by DNA polymerase I and T4 ligase. The constructs were transfected into JM101 bacteria and plated. The M13-POMC phages were isolated, and the inserts were sequenced. Wild type and mutated POMC cDNA were cut from the M13 vector by PstI and blunt ended by T4 polymerase, and NheI linkers were ligated. The mixture was digested with NheI and HincII, and the gel was purified. The POMC cDNA was ligated to a NheI- and SmaI-digested pMSG expression vector and transfected into HB101 Escherichia coli bacteria. Deletion mutations were created by restriction digestion of the area to be deleted and blunt end ligation of the fragments. All the POMC cDNA mutations were verified by sequencing. Bacteria containing wild type and mutated POMC plasmids were grown in 500 ml of LB broth and purified using Qiagen Maxi Prep kits (Chatsworth, CA). Stable Neuro-2a cell lines were made by using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) to transfect the plasmids containing wild type or mutated POMC and were selected using the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase selection marker. Ten different clones for each mutant were screened for expression of the mutant POMC, after which three final clones were selected for the experiments. The cells were grown on poly- L-lysine-coated coverslips, and expression of the POMC/mutant POMC was stimulated with 100 n M dexamethasone. After 24 h the cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, blocked with 10% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated for 16 h with antibody to ACTH1–39 (DP4) (16Elkabes S. Loh Y.P. Nieburgs A. Wray S. Dev. Brain Res. 1989; 46: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) at 1:2500 dilution. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and stained using a goat anti-rabbit serum conjugated with rhodamine (Boehringer Mannheim). Wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to fluorescein (1:250 dilution) was used for staining the Golgi apparatus. The labeled cells were photographed using a Nikon Optiphot fluorescent microscope. Neuro-2a cells were grown in 60-mm plates and transfected with 20 μg of POMC or mutated POMC using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.). A comparison between stably and transiently transfected cells indicated that similar amounts of POMC or mutant POMC were produced per well of 106cells. Subsequently, transient transfections were used for the secretion experiments. After 48 h of stimulation with 100 n M dexamethasone in complete media, the transfected cells were incubated for 3 h in a basal release medium (Medium 1) containing 25 m M Hepes, 125 m M NaCl, 4.8 m M KCl, 1.2 m M KH2PO4, 5.6 m M dextrose, 1 m M CaCl2, 0.5 m M MgCl2, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin at pH 7.4. After 3 h the medium was collected and one-half of the cells received Medium 1, while the other half received a stimulated release medium (Medium 2) identical to Medium 1 except for the substitution of 51 m M K+ and 5.4 m M Ca2+. Both media contained 200 kallikrein-inactivating units/ml aprotinin and 1 m M 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (ICN Biochemicals, Aurora, OH). After 3 h of incubation in Medium 2, the medium was collected, extracted on a Sep-Pak C18, and fractionated by HPLC. The system used for HPLC was a Beckman 421 system and a Bio-Rad HiPore RP-304 column (4.6 × 250 mm). Solvent A was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and solvent B was 80% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Samples were injected as 100-μl volumes and separated using a linear gradient from 10 to 20% solvent B in 10 min and from 20 to 70% solvent B in 60 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. 1-ml samples were collected and analyzed for ACTHiby radioimmunoassay using antibody DP6, which is specific for ACTH1–14but also cross-reacts with ACTH1–15, ACTH1–39, and POMC (17Estivariz F.E.

The percentage of total released ACTHiwas calculated by dividing the ACTHiin Medium 2 by the total ACTHi(i.e. ACTHiin Medium 1 + Medium 2 + the cell extract). The peptide structure was built with disulfide bridges between Cys2/Cys24and Cys8/Cys20and was subjected to 250 ps of molecular dynamics at 600 K. At each picosecond, the structure was captured and extensively minimized using a “conjugate-gradient” algorithm. All calculations were performed using the Discover and Insight programs (Biosys, Palo Alto, CA). The backbone of the loop from Cys8to Cys20is shown as an oval ribbon with the side chains shown as shaded sticks. When full-length POMC was expressed in Neuro-2a cells (18Klebe R.J. Ruddle F.H. J.

The values represent the mean ± S.E. for four experiments. Values are the percent of the total released. Because the Cys residues are highly conserved across species (12Douglass J. Civelli O. Herbert E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 665-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) and are present in several prohormones (Fig. 1 A), we first determined whether the two disulfide bridges in N-POMC (Cys2/Cys24and Cys8/Cys20) were involved in the sorting signal motif. Substitution mutations were made to disrupt either one or both of the disulfide bridges (Fig. 4). Disruption of both disulfide bridges (C2S,C8S) resulted in a perinuclear ACTH immunostaining pattern, suggesting localization within the Golgi (Fig. 2 B). Wheat germ staining for the Golgi confirmed this co-localization (Fig. 2 B′). Substantial amounts of ACTHi, primarily as unprocessed POMC (Fig. 5), were released from these cells in a non-stimulated manner, characteristic of constitutive secretion (Table I). Disruption of the first disulfide bridge (Fig. 4, C2S) resulted in punctate secretory granule ACTH immunostaining at the tips and along the length of the neurites, similar to that of cells transfected with wild type POMC (Fig. 2 C). Stimulated secretion of ACTHi(ACTH1–39and ACTH1–14) from these cells was found (Table I). Disruption of the second disulfide bridge (Fig. 4, C8S) resulted in the immunostaining of large (500-2000 nm) cytoplasmic vesicular-like structures containing ACTHi(Fig. 2 D). Stimulated secretion was not observed, but constitutive secretion of ACTHias unprocessed POMC (data not shown) was found (Table I). These data suggest not only that at least one disulfide bridge is necessary for sorting but also that the position of this disulfide bridge (Cys8/Cys20) was critical for sorting.FIG. 5Representative profile of ACTH immunoreactive products released constitutively from Neuro-2a cells expressing C2S,C8S mutant POMC. The number of nanograms of immunoreactive peptide/fraction was determined by radioimmunoassay, with the predominant peak identified as POMC because it co-ran with a 3H-labeled mouse POMC standard prepared as described in Loh et al. (38Loh Y.P. Parish D.C. Tuteja R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7194-7205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The filled circles represent unstimulated release, and the open circles represent stimulated release in the presence of high K+/Ca2+.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The hairpin loop region was further analyzed as a sorting signal by making a deletion mutant to remove the 13 amino acids forming the loop (C8QDLTTESNLLAC20) (Fig. 4, Cys8-Cys20 Loop Deletion). The Cys8to Cys20loop deletion-mutated POMC protein was localized to a perinuclear region characteristic of localization in the Golgi (Fig. 2 E). There was only constitutive release of this mutant POMC (Table I). These data suggest that there is information in the 13 amino acids of the hairpin loop region of POMC that is essential to sort POMC correctly to the regulated secretory pathway. In order to determine whether other regions of NH2-terminal POMC outside the hairpin loop were necessary for sorting to the secretory granules, 78 amino acids spanning the entire region from Lys25 to Arg101 (Fig. 4) were deleted. ACTHiwas found in punctate secretory granules in these cells (Fig. 2 F), similar to those of the wild type POMC, and ACTH products (ACTH1–39 and ACTH1–14) were secreted in a regulated manner (Table I). These results suggest that there is no information in the γ-melanocyte-stimulating hormone or joining peptide region of POMC that is necessary for sorting to the dense core granules. The data presented here identify the regulated secretory pathway sorting signal for POMC as a highly conserved region consisting of a 13-amino acid hairpin loop conformation (C8QDLTTESNLLAC20) stabilized by one disulfide bridge. A three-dimensional model of this NH2-terminal region of POMC shows that the Cys8to Cys20sequence of 13 amino acids assumes a heart-shaped loop with two lobes, one centered on Asp10-Leu11 and the other on Thr13-Glu14(Fig. 6). The structure is clearly amphipathic with a cluster of hydrophobic side chains (i.e. Cys8-Leu17-Leu18-Ala19-Cys20) at the base of the heart and a hydrophilic region at both upper lobes of the heart-shaped loop (Fig. 6). The disulfide bridge between Cys8and Cys20locks this domain in a rigid conformation. If the POMC sequences known for different species are compared (Fig. 1 A), the residues that are conserved in this region in all species would correspond to Asp10-Leu11-Glu14-LeuFig. 1 A). It is therefore likely that some or all of the side chains of these residues within the amphipathic loop play an important role in the sorting mechanism. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that the first 26 amino acids of N-POMC contained information that was sufficient to sort a reporter protein, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, to the regulated secretory pathway in AtT20 cells (14Tam W.H.H. Andreasson K.A. Loh Y.P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 62: 294-306PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we have shown that when 25 amino acids of N-POMC (Cys2 to Pro26) containing the amphipathic loop and both disulfide bridges were deleted, the mutant POMC was sorted to the constitutive secretory pathway in Neuro-2a cells (24Cool D.R. Loh Y.P. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We now show that eliminating just the 13-amino acid amphipathic loop (Cys8to Cys20) was sufficient to cause the mutant POMC to be secreted constitutively. This mutant POMC was not processed in the Neuro-2a cells, further suggesting routing through the constitutive secretory pathway. These results provide evidence that firmly establishes for the first time that the 13-amino acid amphipathic loop region of N-POMC is necessary for sorting POMC to the regulated secretory pathway, and there appears to be no other essential sorting signals in the rest of the POMC molecule. The participation of the disulfide bridges in sorting was also tested by substituting a serine residue for cysteine at position 2, position 8, or both, which effectively disrupted the disulfide bridges. Disruption of the second disulfide bridge or both disulfide bridges resulted in the missorting of POMC to the constitutive secretory pathway. Mutant POMC secreted by the constitutive secretory pathway was not processed. However, disruption of the first disulfide bridge had no effect on sorting to secretory granules. Thus we conclude that sorting of POMC to the regulated secretory pathway is dependent only on the presence of the disulfide bridge closest to the amphipathic loop (Cys8/Cys20). These results are further supported by the observation that, in both salmon II and trout B POMC (25Kawauchi H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 227: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 26Kitahara N. Nishizawa T. Iida K. Okazaki H. Andoh T. Soma G.I. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Comp.

Endocrinol. 1991; 82: 237-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) have reported similar results for two of the mutants described here, C2S,C8S and C2S. However, our results differ concerning the fate of the C8S and POMC-Δ1-26 mutations. Roy et al. (22Roy P. Chevrier D. Fournier H. Racine C. Zollinger M. Crine P. Boileau G. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1991; 82: 237-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) found that both of these mutant proteins were secreted in a regulated manner, were localized to regulated secretory granules in the cells, and were processed in the cells. In our study (Fig. 2 and Table I) and that of Cool and Loh (24Cool D.R. Loh Y.P. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), the same mutant POMC proteins were secreted constitutively, were not localized to regulated secretory granules, and were primarily not processed. Differing methods of analysis and the low number of experiments by Roy et al. (22Roy P. Chevrier D. Fournier H. Racine C. Zollinger M. Crine P. Boileau G. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1991; 82: 237-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) may account for the differences between the results. First, for their secretion studies, Roy et al. (22Roy P. Chevrier D. Fournier H. Racine C. Zollinger M. Crine P. Boileau G. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1991; 82: 237-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) reported the result of only one experiment for the POMC-Δ1-26 mutant. Furthermore, data for the analysis of secretion of the C8S mutant were not shown, but the authors concluded that this mutant was secreted in a regulated manner (22Roy P. Chevrier D. Fournier H. Racine C. Zollinger M. Crine P. Boileau G. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1991; 82: 237-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). On the contrary, our secretion data for this and other mutants, representing the mean from four experiments, provide conclusive proof that this C8S mutant protein as well as the NH2-terminally deleted (Cys8to Cys20loop deletion) mutant are secreted via the constitutive secretory pathway. Second, the use by Roy et al. (22Roy P. Chevrier D. Fournier H. Racine C. Zollinger M. Crine P. Boileau G. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1991; 82: 237-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) of the processing of POMC to β-endorphin in the cell extract only as evidence for targeting POMC to the regulated secretory pathway is ambiguous, because another group has shown that the Neuro-2a cell line can process POMC directly to β-endorphin, which is at the COOH terminus of this prohormone, efficiently bypassing the β-lipotrophic hormone intermediate (30Day N.C. Lin H. Ueda Y. Meador-Woodruff J.H. Akil H. Neuropeptides. 1993; 24: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The subcellular site for this aberrant cleavage is as yet undetermined in the Neuro-2a cell line. Additionally, four antisera were used, each for a different assay in the studies of Roy et al. (22Roy P. Chevrier D. Fournier H. Racine C. Zollinger M. Crine P. Boileau G. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1991; 82: 237-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), each of which reacted with different regions of the POMC molecule. Thus there was a lack of continuity in following one POMC product (e.g. β-endorphin) from immunocytochemical localization through processing and secretion. In contrast, antisera to only the ACTH portion of the POMC molecule were used for our entire study. The requirement for the integrity of the disulfide bridge in sorting proteins to the regulated secretory pathway has also been demonstrated for chromogranin B (31Chanat E. Weiss U. Huttner W.B. Tooze S.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2159-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 32Chanat E. Weiss U. Huttner W.B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Disruption of the disulfide bridge by the addition of the thiol-reducing agent dithiothreitol to PC12 cells caused rerouting of the endogenous chromogranin B to the constitutive pathway. The constitutively secreted chromogranin B, in the reduced state due to treatment with dithiothreitol, lacked the loop structure formed by the disulfide bridge (Fig. 1 A), implicating the involvement of this structure as a sorting signal for the regulated secretory pathway. A sorting signal may also exist for prohormones without cysteine residues, such as pro-somatostatin. In experiments in which the first 82 amino acids of the pro-region of pro-somatostatin were fused to 142 amino acids of α-globin, α-globin fusion protein was targeted to the regulated secretory pathway in GH3 cells (33Stoller T.J. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1647-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The presence of a signal that could sort α-globin to the regulated pathway in pro-somatostatin appears to reside in the first 82 amino acids. However, by deleting different regions of the pro-somatostatin molecule, it was determined that multiple sorting signals might exist in the somatostatin molecule, each of which could independently cause sorting to the regulated secretory pathway (34Sevarino K.A. Stork P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 28: 18507-18513Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). POMC may also contain domains that are not sufficient by themselves to cause sorting but that may act synergistically with the N-POMC amphipathic loop to enhance sorting to the regulated secretory pathway. A previous study suggests that the carboxyl terminus of POMC may contain information that could influence sorting (21Chevrier D. Fournier H. Nault C. Zollinger M. Crine P. Boileau G. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 94: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, our previous work with the N-POMC-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase chimeric constructs (14Tam W.H.H. Andreasson K.A. Loh Y.P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 62: 294-306PubMed Google Scholar) and the Δ2-26 POMC mutant (24Cool D.R. Loh Y.P. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) suggests that the COOH-terminal region is not an absolute necessity for sorting to the regulated secretory pathway. A comparison of the NH2-terminal regions of POMC from different species indicates that in addition to the conserved cysteine residues at positions 2, 8, 20, and 24, which form a pair of disulfide bridges (Cys2/Cys24and Cys8/Cys20), there are also four other highly conserved amino acids, Asp10-Leu11-Glu14-Leu18. It is likely that these residues in the amphipathic loop motif play a role in the sorting mechanism, perhaps through ionic/hydrophobic interactions with a putative sorting receptor. It is also interesting to note that, when only the amphipathic loop region (Cys8to Cys20) was deleted, the two remaining cysteine residues at positions 2 and 24 could potentially form a disulfide bridge, creating a smaller loop with acidic and hydrophobic residues. However, this mutant was not sorted to the regulated secretory pathway, suggesting that this loop, if formed, was not enough to cause sorting. Immediately following the last cysteine residue in the hairpin loop of POMC (Cys24) is another set of highly conserved residues, Asp27-Leu28-Glu31-Val34. The similarity of the acidic and hydrophobic components of these residues to the Asp10-Leu11-Glu14-Leu18motif in the amphipathic loop suggests that they could potentially play a role in sorting to the regulated secretory pathway. However, helical wheel analyses of the other amino acids in this region (e.g. Pro26, Pro32, and Pro35) suggest that they would probably not allow the formation of an amphipathic loop. The lack of targeting to the regulated secretory pathway of the mutants with the amphipathic loop deleted (Cys2 to Cys26 and Cys8to Cys20) shows that these residues (Asp27-Leu28-Glu31-Val34) cannot compensate for the 13-amino acid amphipathic loop motif. This conclusion was further supported by our finding that deletion of the Lys25 to Arg101 region (Fig. 4, 78 Amino Acid Deletion) had no effect on the sorting of this mutant POMC. Misfolding of the natural conformation of proteins has been associated with aggregation or retention and degradation in the early stages of the secretory pathway (35Marquardt T. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 36Yilla M. Doyle D. Sawyer J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Any of the mutations (i.e. disruption of the disulfide bridges, deletion of the amphipathic loop structure, or the 78-amino acid deletion in POMC) could potentially cause such misfolding. However, we found that none of these mutations caused significant retention or degradation in the endoplasmic reticulum, because large amounts of mutant POMC were found to be secreted in a constitutive or regulated manner from these cells. How does the amphipathic heart-shaped loop of N-POMC act as a sorting signal? The modeling results indicate that the acidic side chains of Asp10and Glu14are poised in a position within the amphipathic loop structure of N-POMC that is ideal for ionic interactions with a sorting receptor protein. Whereas a putative “receptor” has long been proposed (37Chung K.N. Walter P. Aponte G.W. Moore H.P.H. Science. 1989; 243: 192-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), no protein has yet been found to play the role of “universal” receptor for the numerous pro-proteins found in the regulated secretory pathway. However, there is evidence from previous studies that N-POMC1–76 can bind in a pH-dependent manner (optimum pH, ∼5.5-6.0) to the luminal side of bovine intermediate lobe secretory vesicle membranes (14Tam W.H.H. Andreasson K.A. Loh Y.P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 62: 294-306PubMed Google Scholar) and that this binding is protease-sensitive. 3D. R. Cool, unpublished results. Thus, the binding of the N-POMC8–20 amphipathic loop to a receptor is one potential mechanism by which POMC is actively sorted to the regulated secretory pathway. In summary, we have provided evidence in this paper for the first time that the regulated secretory pathway sorting signal present in the NH2-terminal region of POMC is a 13-amino acid amphipathic loop conformational signal, dependent upon the integrity of the disulfide bridge and thus upon the stabilization of the amphipathic loop for its activity. The presence of an active sorting signal in POMC for the regulated secretory pathway suggests the possibility that a putative receptor, located in the trans-Golgi network, recognizes the prohormone molecule and thus is responsible for sorting it to the newly forming regulated secretory granule. The model we present for this amphipathic loop sorting signal can now be used as a template by other researchers for molecular modeling to identify similar regions in other prohormones.

The biosynthesis of fucose-containing glycoconjugates requires the action of several glycosyltransferases, of which fucosylation is the last and critical step (18Holmes E.H. Ostrander G.K.

Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16789-16794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant forms of these enzymes allow study of a single enzyme species. The limited studies of acceptor specificity performed to date allow only a partial assignment of a correspondence between cloned enzymes and ones in tissues and cell lines. Our goal was to characterize the enzymatic properties of recombinant forms of Fuc-TIII, Fuc-TIV, and Fuc-TV. Substrate preferences were determined with a matrix of acceptor substrates including oligosaccharides, glycolipids, and glycoproteins. To determine which functional groups on an acceptor are crucial for enzyme recognition, each species of recombinant Fuc-T was analyzed for its ability to transfer fucose to deoxy analogs of acceptors. Recombinant Fuc-Ts share significant amino acid sequence homology (27Weston B.W. Nair R.P. Larsen R.D. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4152-4160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), despite differences in acceptor specificity. As approximately 90% of the amino acid differences between Fuc-TIII and Fuc-TV are confined to the N-terminal part of the proteins (28Weston B.W. Smith P.L. Kelly R.J. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24575-24584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it has been suggested that this domain directs the acceptor specificity. We evaluated this possibility by examining the acceptor specificity of Fuc-Ts truncated in this region by selecting areas that were approximately equally spaced from the transmembrane domain and each other. Constructs encoding amino acids 44–361 and 52–361 of Fuc-TIII were amplified by PCR and subcloned into a vector, which contained a protein A coding sequence preceding the point of insertion, to produce protein A-Fuc-T fusion proteins. Similar constructs were prepared for Fuc-TV (containing amino acids 44–374 and 62–374) and for Fuc-TIV (containing amino acids 58–405). These shortened protein A-Fuc-T chimeric proteins were compared to full-length recombinant enzymes. An aim of this study is to provide insight into structure-function relationships of the fucosyltransferases encoded by the human genome. Significant effort is underway to block selectin-ligand interactions and to identify inhibitors of α1,3-fucosyltransferases to limit the synthesis of selectin ligands, and thus produce anti-inflammatory and possibly anti-metastatic drugs. Knowledge about the active sites of the Fuc-Ts may allow design of effective inhibitors. Moreover, soluble secreted forms of Fuc-Ts will probably be the likely candidates for use in large scale synthesis of potential selectin inhibitors. Therefore, a thorough knowledge of these forms of Fuc-Ts is required. GDP-Fucose and compounds 2, 4, 6, 9, 11, and 12 were kind gifts of Dr. Ole Hindsgaul (University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta).

Truncated forms of the DNA encoding the fucosyltransferases (shortened at the 5′ ends) were similarly prepared by PCR from verified full-length constructs and ligated into a plasmid which contains a protein A sequence preceding the point of insertion (40Wei Z. Swiedler S.J. Ishihara M. Orellana A. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 90: 3885-3888Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). For truncated Fuc-TIII, nucleotides 130 and 157 of the translated Fuc-TIII sequence were starting points for, respectively, long (Fuc-TIIIl) and medium (Fuc-TIIIm) forms. For truncated Fuc-TIV, nucleotide 172 was a starting point for the long (Fuc-TIVl) form. For truncated Fuc-TV, nucleotides 130 and 184 were starting points for long (Fuc-TVl) and medium (Fuc-TVm) forms. A DNA sequence encoding protein A was connected by a polylinker to the 5′ end of the truncated Fuc-T in each plasmid, resulting in production of a chimeric Fuc-T during translation. Following selective amplification in bacteria, plasmids with desired DNA constructs encoding Fuc-Ts and chimeric Fuc-Ts were purified by ultracentrifugation on cesium chloride gradients. Plasmid DNA was dissolved in sterile water at 1 μg/μl before use in transfection. The DNA inserts were verified by sequence analysis by dideoxy chain termination (41Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar), using T7 DNA polymerase (Pharmacia Biotech). DNA was transfected into COS cells by a DEAE-dextran protocol, using from 2 to 10 μg of DNA/100-mm tissue culture dish seeded with 0.4 × 106 cells (42Davis L.G. Dibner M.D. Battey J.F. Basic Methods in Molecular Biology. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., New York1986: 290-292Crossref Google Scholar). COS cell clones expressing the full-length constructs of Fuc-Ts were identified by antibody-linked immunofluorescent display of appropriate fucosylated antigens on the COS cell surface 3 days after transfection. COS cells mock-transfected with irrelevant DNA displayed only background levels of immunofluorescence. Chimeric Fuc-Ts were isolated from the media of similarly transfected COS cells on days 2 through 6 post-transfection, using rabbit IgG-agarose to purify the protein A-Fuc-T chimeras. All enzyme preparations were done on ice. To elute chimeric Fuc-Ts from IgG-agarose beads, the beads (10 μl) were washed with 1 ml of 10mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 150 mM NaCl, and pelleted. The supernatant was removed and 143 μl of 0.1 M sodium citrate, pH 4.4, was added. The tube was vortexed for 5 s, incubated for 1 min, and centrifuged. The supernatant was added to 57 μl of 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, containing 0.1% BSA. Released enzyme was diluted 4-fold with buffer A (50 mM cacodylate, pH 7.2, containing 50% glycerol, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1% BSA, and 0.05% sodium azide) and stored at 4 °C until use. The resulting enzyme preparation was stable for at least 6 months. Activity of the Fuc-T-protein A chimeras is expressed as picomoles˙minute−1˙milliliter−1 (the addition of a carrier protein, BSA, to ensure recovery of Fuc-T protein precluded protein determination of Fuc-T). Thawed pellets of transfected COS-7 cells were resuspended in 50mM cacodylate, pH 6.7, to a protein concentration of 8 – 10 μg/μl. Extracts were prepared as described (43Robinson N.E. de Vries Th. Davis R.E. Stults C.L.M. Watson S.R. van den Eijnden D.H. Macher B.A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The standard reaction mixture contained in 50 μl: 5 nmol of GDP-[14C]Fuc (4–5 Ci/mol), 2.5 μ mol of MOPS/NaOH, pH 7.5, 1.0 μmol of MnCl2, 5 μmol of NaCl, 0.2 μmol of ATP, 50 nmol of acceptor (unless stated otherwise), and an amount of enzyme preparation corresponding to initial velocity and giving similar fucose transfer for each preparation. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 1 h (chimeras) or 4 h (cell extracts). The reaction was stopped by dilution with 200 μl of cold water. The mixture and two additional rinses (200 μl) were applied to a column of 1 ml of Dowex 1-X2 (200–400 mesh, Cl− form). The column was washed with 2 ml of water and the radioactivity in the effluent measured. The column was eluted with 2 ml of 0.5 m acetic acid when sialylated oligosaccharides were used as acceptors. Values were corrected for incorporation into endogenous acceptors. Three replicates were used per data point. A unit of activity was defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the transfer of 1μmol of fucose˙min−1 to an acceptor substrate under standard assay conditions. Acceptor substrates (18.7 nmol) were incubated in the standard reaction mixture for 2 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, the reaction was stopped by adding 200 μl of cold water, and the mixture was applied to a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (44Palcic M.M. Heerze L.D. Pierce M. Hindsgaul O. Glycoconjugate J. 1988; 5: 49-63Crossref Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Two additional rinses (200 μl) were also applied to the Sep-Pak. The cartridge was washed with H2O (3 × 5 ml) and the product eluted with methanol (5 ml). The eluate was dried and the incorporation of [14C]fucose determined by scintillation counting. 0.25 mg of α1-AGP or 0.5 mg of fetuin (native or asialo, 110 nmol of acceptor sites calculated from galactose content of the protein) were incubated in the standard reaction mixture for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 200 μl of cold 1% BSA in water. Incorporation of fucose into the glycoprotein was determined by acid precipitation as described (45Joziasse D.H. Bergh M.L.E. ter Hart H.G.J. Koppen P. Hooghwinkel G.J.M. van den Eijnden D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4941-4951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Twenty μg of glycolipid in 20 μl of 85% ethanol and 5 μl of 5% sodium taurodeoxycholate in CHCl3/CH3 OH (1:1) were dried together at room temperature in a microtiter well. The standard reaction mixture was added together with an amount of enzyme preparation. Before incubation the microtiter plate was sonicated for 1 min to allow the formation of glycolipid/sodium taurodeoxycholate micelles. Incubation was performed for 8.5 h (chimeras) or 24 h (cell extracts). The reaction products were recovered from the wells as follows: 150 μl of 85% ethanol was added to the well, mixed thoroughly with the incubation mixture, and the total mixture was applied to a Sep-Pakcartridge. Wells were rinsed twice with 100 μl of 85% ethanol, rinses were diluted with 5 ml of water, and applied to the Sep-Pak cartridge. The cartridge was washed, and the incorporation of [14C]fucose into the glycolipid was determined. The apparent Km for GDP-fucose was determined at 500 μM of compound 11 for Fuc-TIII and 500 μM of compound 4 for Fuc-TIV and Fuc-TV under the above assay conditions. Apparent kinetic parameters for the acceptor substrates were determined using a close to saturating concentration of GDP-fucose (50 μM). The kinetic parameters were determined using SigmaPlot (Jandel scientific) and fit to the Michaelis-Menten curve. Sensitivity toward NEM (final concentration in the reaction mixture was 10 mM) was determined by preincubation of the enzyme preparation with NEM for 1 h at 0 °C. One-ml suspensions of “enzyme on beads” (Fuc-TVm or Fuc-TIIIm) was treated as above to elute the enzyme from the IgG-beads. The eluted enzyme was added directly to a tube containing: 500 nmol of 10 (for Fuc-TVm), 1500 nmol of GDP-[14C]Fuc (0.2 Ci/mol), 20 μmol of MnCl2, and 4 μmol of ATP or 200 nmol of 3 (for Fuc-TIIIm), 600 nmol of GDP-[14C]Fuc (0.2 Ci/mol), 20μmol of MnCl2, and 4μmol of ATP. Incubation was conducted for 48 h at 37 °C. Each reaction mixture was applied to a 1-ml Dowex 1-X8 (100–200 mesh) column, which was washed with 4 ml of water, and the flow-through was lyophilized. The residual material was dissolved in 500 μl of 50 mM ammonium acetate, pH 5.2, applied to a column (1.6 × 200 cm) of Bio-Gel P-4 (200–400 mesh) equilibrated with, and eluted at a flow of 14 ml/h with 50 mM ammonium acetate, pH 5.2, at 45 °C. Fractions (4 ml) were collected, monitored for radioactivity, pooled (fraction 67–71), lyophilized, and desalted on a column (1 × 40 cm) of Bio-Gel P-2 (200–400 mesh) eluted with water. Yields were 220 nmol of fucosylated 10 (44% relative to acceptor substrate) and 84 nmol of fucosylated 3 (42% relative to acceptor substrate). For structural characterization of fucosylated glycolipid products (i.e. Fuc-TIV, with nLc6 Cer (18) or VI3 NeuAcnLc6 Cer (20) and Fuc-TVm with nLc6 Cer or VI3 NeuAcnLc6 Cer), incubations were performed for 24 h at 37 °C. Two wells were pooled for the reactions of Fuc-TIV1, with nLc6Cer and NeuAcnLc6Cer and four wells for the reactions of Fuc-TVm. The products and unreacted glycolipid substrate were separated from the other components of the reaction mixture by Sep-Pak C18 chromatography. The methanol phase, containing glycosphingolipids, was dried under a stream of nitrogen, dissolved in 500 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1), and dried again. The sample was redissolved in 50 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1) and spotted on an aluminum-backed Silica Gel 60 TLC plate and chromatographed in chloroform/methanol/water (60:35:8). Immunostaining was performed as described (46Buehler J. Macher B.A. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 158: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), with 1B2, My-1, CSLEX-1, or VIM-2 as the primary antibody. Prior to 1H NMR spectroscopic analysis, the acceptor substrates (compounds 3 and 10) and the fucosylated products (100–300 nmol) were exchanged in D2O three times, with intermediate lyophilization. Finally, each sample was redissolved in 400 μl of D2O (99.96 atom% D, Aldrich). 1H NMR spectroscopy was performed on a Bruker MSL 400 spectrometer operating at 400 MHz at a probe temperature of 300 K. Resolution enhancement was achieved by Lorentzian to Gaussian transformation. Chemical shifts are expressed in ppm downfield from internal sodium 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonate but were actually measured by reference to internal acetone (δ 2.225 in D2O). Various forms of Fuc-Ts (full-length and N-terminal truncated chimeras) were tested with different acceptors. In most cases, the acceptor specificity of both full-length and chimeric Fuc-Ts was determined. For truncated forms of enzymes, the following constructs were assayed: Fuc-TIIIl, containing amino acids 44–361; Fuc-TIIIm, 52–361; Fuc-TIVl, 58–405; Fuc-TVl, 44–374; and Fuc-TVm, 62–374, all as chimeras with protein A. However, some forms of a given enzyme lacked activity with a particular class of acceptors (see below). Some significant differences were found in the acceptor specificity of full-length versus chimeric forms of Fuc-Ts, and these novel observations are described in a subsequent section (see below).

https://openalex.org/W2085063650,"Cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) is emerging as an endogenous regulator of Ca2−-induced Ca2−release (CICR), and we have recently demonstrated that its action is mediated by calmodulin (CaM) (Lee, H. C., Aarhus, R., Graeff, R., Gurnack, M. E., and Walseth, T. F. (1994) Nature 370, 307-309). In this study we show by immunoblot analyses that the protein factor in sea urchin eggs responsible for conferring cADPR sensitivity to egg microsomes was CaM. This was further supported by the fact that bovine CaM was equally effective as the egg factor. In contrast, plant CaM was only partially active even at 10-20-fold higher concentrations. This exquisite specificity was also shown by binding studies using 125I-labeled bovine CaM. The effectiveness of various CaMs (bovine > spinach > wheat germ) in competing for the binding sites was identical to their potency in conferring cADPR sensitivity to the microsomes. A comparison between bovine and wheat germ CaM in competing for the sites suggests only 10-14% of the total binding was crucial for the activity. Depending on the CaM concentration, the sensitivity of the microsomes to cADPR could be changed by several orders of magnitude. The requirement for CaM could be alleviated by raising the divalent cation concentration with Sr2−. Results showed that CaM, cADPR, and caffeine all act synergistically to increase the divalent cation sensitivity of the CICR mechanism. The combined action of any of the three agonists was sufficient to sensitize the mechanism so much that even the nanomolar concentration of ambient Ca2−was enough to activate the release. Unlike the CICR mechanism, the microsomal inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive Ca2−release showed no dependence on CaM. Using an antagonist of CaM, W7, it was demonstrated that the cADPR- but not the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent release mechanism could be blocked in live sea urchin eggs. These results indicate cADPR can function as a physiological modulator of CICR and, together with CaM, can alter the sensitivity of the release mechanism to divalent cation by several orders of magnitude.

https://openalex.org/W2019025253,"A new strategy was developed to study the relationship between the translation and degradation of a specific mRNA in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A series of 5′-untranslated regions (UTR) was combined with the cat gene from the bacterial transposon Tn9, allowing us to test the influence of upstream open reading frames (uORFs) on translation and mRNA stability. The 5′-UTR sequences were designed so that the minimum possible sequence alteration, a single nucleotide substitution, could be used to create a 7-codon ORF upstream of the cat gene. The uORF was translated efficiently, but at the same time inhibited translation of the cat ORF and destabilized the cat mRNA. Investigations of various derivatives of the 5′-UTR indicated that cat translation was primarily attributable to leaky scanning of ribosomes past the uORF rather than to reinitiation. Therefore, these data directly demonstrate destabilization of a specific mRNA linked to changes in translational initiation on the same transcript. In contrast to the previously proposed nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway, destabilization was not triggered by premature translational termination in the main ORF and was not discernibly dependent upon a reinitiation-driven mechanism.

This suggests the existence of an as yet not described pathway of translation-linked mRNA degradation. Given that the translational machinery and the RNA degradation apparatus interact with the same mRNA molecules, it would come as no surprise if translation and mRNA decay were to mutually influence each other. It is obvious that mRNA degradation ultimately eliminates the template of translation. Yet the issue as to the role of translation in controlling mRNA decay is far from being resolved (1Sachs A.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 413-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar, 2Belasco J. Brawerman G. Control of Messenger RNA Stability. Academic Press, San Diego1993Google Scholar). This is not for the lack of indications that there could be a link between the two. (a) Rapid degradation of yeast MATα1 (3Caponigro G. Muhlrad D. Parker R. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1993; 13: 5034-5042Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) is dependent on the translation of destabilizing elements within the respective coding regions. (b) Degradation of at least some yeast mRNAs is accelerated by nonsense codons introduced into the coding region (5Losson R. Lacroute F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In yeast, the so-called nonsense-mediated decay pathway is dependent on trans-acting factors (encoded by the UPF genes (9Leeds P. Wood J.M. Lee B.-S. Culbertson M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2165-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar)), one of which (Upf1p) seems to be associated with ribosomes (10Peltz S.W. Trotta C. Feng H. Brown A. Donahue J. Welch E.

(c) Two means of inhibiting translation lead to stabilization of mRNA. These involve the inhibition of elongation using cycloheximide (1Sachs A.B.

Biol. 1992; 12: 5778-5784Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Both of these experimental strategies impose a general, rather than an mRNA-specific, block on translation. (d) Finally, ribosomes have been found associated with certain ribonuclease activities (2Belasco J. Brawerman G. Control of Messenger RNA Stability.

However, other data are not easily reconciled with the above observations. Most importantly, translational initiation can be inhibited by more than 90%, using stem-loops inserted into the 5′-untranslated region (UTR), 1The abbreviations used are:UTRuntranslated regionORFopen reading frameuORFupstream ORFCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferase. without stabilizing the mRNA (14Vega Laso M.R.

This clearly constitutes a challenge to any model proposing tight coupling between translation and mRNA decay. untranslated region open reading frame upstream ORF chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. A required approach toward understanding the relationship between translation and mRNA degradation is to restrict engineered changes in the cell to minimal alterations in the sequence of a specific mRNA. This greatly reduces the risk of misleading or artifactual effects that might be associated with general manipulations of, for example, cellular translational capacity (see point c, above). The present paper approaches this question by making use of a further important property of the eukaryotic 5′-UTR. The presence of one or more additional start codons upstream of the main reading frame inhibits cap-dependent translation (17Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This effect may be more pronounced in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where the context of an AUG codon has a less significant modulating effect upon the efficiency of start-site selection than in higher eukaryotes (18Donahue T.F. Cigan M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 193: 366-372Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). An upstream AUG can be combined with a translational termination codon within the 5′-UTR, thus creating an upstream open reading frame (uORF). There are many examples of uORFs in the 5′-UTRs of vertebrate mRNAs (19Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar), and also a small number of them in S. cerevisiae (20Bossier P. Fernandes L. Rocha D. Rodrigues-Pousada C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23640-23645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Hinnebusch A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 409-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The GCN4 gene of yeast is of special interest in that it is subject to translational regulation mediated by four uORFs in its 5′-UTR (21Hinnebusch A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 409-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The mechanism of induction of GCN4 involves phosphorylation of eIF-2α, which in turn inhibits the eIF-2B-catalyzed exchange of GDP/GTP on eIF-2. Regulation of the availability of eIF-2˙GTP in this way is thought to influence start-site selection within the leader. We show that the creation of a single short uORF in a synthetic 5′-UTR upstream of a reporter gene in yeast strongly inhibits translation. Moreover, given appropriate experimental design, a 5′-UTR that is otherwise free of uAUGs and of stable secondary structure can be converted to an uORF-containing leader by means of a single base change. This approach allows us to compare the translation and degradation of two mRNAs that differ minimally in terms of sequence but greatly in terms of the translational efficiency of a reporter gene (in this case the Tn9 cat gene). In comparison, strong inhibition of translation by secondary structure can only be achieved via the introduction or substitution of several nucleotides in the 5′-UTR. Further manipulations of the 5′-UTR were made in order to influence the pathway and efficiency of start-site selection on the main ORF, thus providing information about the type of mechanism responsible for the observed translation rates. We have investigated how the ribosomal loading of an mRNA is affected by the introduction of an uORF and how this relates to the decay rate. The results provide striking new evidence of a link between mRNA translation and decay. BWG1-7a (MATa, leu2-3, leu2-112, his4-519, ade1-100, ura3-52).

Yeast was cultured and transformed according to standard methods (23Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Laboratory Course Manual for Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986: 117-122Google Scholar). The cloning of short upstream reading frames into the leader region of the cat mRNA was performed by introducing synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides into the YCpCATEX1 plasmid (24Oliveira C.C. van den Heuvel J. McCarthy J.E.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) (see Table I). The oligonucleotide B1A, bearing an ORF of six codons, was inserted into the BamHI site at the 5′-end of the cat leader. A control construct was prepared using the synthetic B1O fragment, which differs from B1A in only one nucleotide (where B1A has AUG, B1O has AAG). The resulting leader does not contain an uORF. In order to increase the leader length upstream or downstream of the uORF, additional spacer fragments were cloned between the EcoRV and BamHI sites, respectively, creating USP10 and USP30. The leader length between the uORF and the cat coding region was increased by inserting a synthetic fragment between the XhoI and NdeI sites of B1A (DSP30). Further extension of the spacer region was achieved by inserting the 50-nucleotide fragment SP50 (24Oliveira C.C. van den Heuvel J. McCarthy J.E.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) into the AflII site of DSP30, giving DSP80. OL136 was generated by destroying the termination codon of the uORF by means of digestion of YCpCATEX1-B1A with AflII, followed by treatment with mung bean nuclease and religation, yielding an extended uORF that overlaps with the cat gene, terminating 136 nucleotides downstream of the A of the cat start codon. uATG has three extra in-frame AUG codons upstream of the original B1A uORF start codon. B1ASS bears a secondary structure with a stability of −22 kcal/mol located inside the uORF, extending the uORF length from 6 to 21 codons. B1SS is a control for B1ASS, bearing the same secondary structure, but no uORF. B1X3 has been described elsewhere (24Oliveira C.C. van den Heuvel J. McCarthy J.E.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and was used as a control for B1AX3, which bears the uORF B1A and a secondary structure (X3) with a predicted stability of −17 kcal/mol, five nucleotides upstream of the cat start codon. The GCN4 leader, which bears four uORFs, was cloned upstream of the cat gene (after mutagenesis by PCR of the plasmid p180 (25Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2349-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) in order to create a BamHI and an NdeI site at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the leader, respectively).Table I:Sequences of the 5′-UTRs Total yeast RNA was isolated by the hot phenol method (26Köhrer K.

Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) was performed using yeast transformants grown in 100 ml of YNB-lactate medium at 24°C for 18 h. Cells from these cultures were inoculated in the same volume of YNB-galactose and incubated at 24°C for 3 h to A600 = 0.8. Cells were then harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in the same volume of prewarmed (36°C) YNB-glucose medium. A 20-ml sample was collected at this time (time 0). The cell cultures were further incubated at 36°C in a shaking water bath, and samples were collected at various time points thereafter. Total RNA isolated from the different samples was used for Northern blots. The resulting labeled bands were excised from the blotting membrane and used for scintillation counting (24Oliveira C.C. van den Heuvel J. McCarthy J.E.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Fresh cultures of the yeast transformants were allowed to grow in YNB-galactose to A600 = 0.8-1.0.

After autoradiography of separated acetylated chloramphenicol forms, spots were counted in a scanning machine (linear analyzer, Chroma 2D, Berthold). Protein quantitation was performed by the BCA method (bicinchoninic acid protein assay (30Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M.

Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed with water, and the pellet was frozen and stored at −20°C until used for CAT assays and RNA analysis. In a procedure adapted from Sagliocco et al. (15Sagliocco F.A. Zhu D. Vega Laso M.R. McCarthy J.E.G. Tuite M.F. Brown A.J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18630-18637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), yeast cell extracts were prepared from cultures in 100 ml of YNB-Gal medium (A600 = 0.8) and loaded on a 12-ml diethyl pyrocarbonate 15-45% sucrose gradient. Total RNA was extracted from 600-μl fractions and resuspended in 10 μl of treated water. 5 μl of RNA suspension was glyoxylated and separated by electrophoresis in a 1.3% agarose gel. After blotting to a nylon membrane, Northern blot analysis was performed using 32P-labeled DNA fragments. Quantitation of the relative amounts of mRNA was performed as above. Short open reading frames (uORFs) were inserted into the leader region of the cat mRNA in the plasmid YCpCATEX1 (24Oliveira C.C. van den Heuvel J. McCarthy J.E.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) using a series of oligodeoxyribonucleotides (Fig. 1 and Table I). The presence of an uORF strongly inhibited translation of the cat gene, as seen, for example, by comparing the CAT levels of yeast cells bearing the constructs B1O and B1A (B1A supports 6.5% of the CAT activity supported by the control B1O; Fig. 2 A). These two constructs differ by only one nucleotide in the 5′-UTR.FIG. 2The relative CAT activities directed by the constructs illustrated in Fig. 1. Panel A shows the activities of all of the constructs relative to the activity of B10, which was normalized to the value of 1.00. Overall, the values demonstrate the strong inhibition of translation caused by the presence of an uORF in the 5′-UTR of the cat gene. The GCN4 construct bears the complete 5′-UTR from this yeast gene inserted upstream of the cat gene. Panel B compares the CAT activities of those constructs with an uORF in the 5′-UTR (except B1AX3). The data are grouped into two sections. The changes in encoded CAT activity relative to B10 in group 1 are most readily explained in terms of reductions in the amount of “leaky scanning” of preinitiation complexes past the uAUGs in the 5′-UTRs. At least part of the remaining cat translational activity is probably attributable to reinitiation of ribosomes subsequent to termination at the uORF stop codons. The changes in encoded CAT activity relative to B1A depicted in group 2 are more easily explained in terms of modulation of the efficiency of reinitiation at the cat start codon following termination on the uORF. The relative values schematically represented here (averages of measurements performed with at least three different sets of cell extracts) were as follows (±S.D. values): B1O, 1,00; B1A, 0.065 ± 0.010; USP10, 0.039 ± 0.007; USP30, 0.041 ± 0.009; DSP30, 0.067 ± 0.008; DSP80, 0.118 ± 0.025; uATG, 0.031 ± 0.006; OL136, 0.052 ± 0.013; B1SS, 0.020 ± 0.005; B1ASS, 0.007 ± 0.002; B1X3, 0.035 ± 0.008; B1AX3, 0.004 ± 0.001; GCN4, 0.011 ± 0.001.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Other constructs were designed with the intention of defining the possible processes responsible for translation of the cat gene (Fig. 2 B). The AUG codon of the uORF in B1A is located 13 nucleotides downstream of the 5′-end of the mRNA, which is a position thought not to allow efficient recognition of this AUG by the ribosome (17Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Donahue T.F. Cigan M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 193: 366-372Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Increasing the leader length upstream of the B1A uORF (constructs USP10 and USP30; Fig. 1) resulted in further attenuation of cat expression. These results can be interpreted in terms of the scanning model of translation initiation (17Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This would predict that translation of the cat gene in the B1A construct is due primarily to leaky scanning. It has been demonstrated that eukaryotic ribosomes need at least 14 nucleotides upstream of the AUG codon for efficient translation initiation to occur (32Sedman S.A. Gelembiuk G.W. Mertz J.E. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 453-457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since USP10 and USP30 provide 23 and 43 nucleotides, respectively, upstream of the AUG of the uORF, the ribosomes can more efficiently recognize this AUG, initiating translation at the uORF and thus inhibiting cat translation more effectively (Fig. 2). By analogy, uATG, with its four in-frame AUGs (Fig. 1), should show decreased leaky scanning past the uORF and thus direct poorer translation of the cat reading frame. The observed reduction in cat translation relative to comparable constructs is consistent with leaky scanning providing many of the ribosomes for initiation on the cat ORF. Analysis of the above data alone does not rule out any contribution of reinitiation to the overall translation of cat. The described mutations in the leaders may not have eliminated leaky scanning completely. Further experimental results provided a stronger case for the occurrence of leaky scanning on the cat 5′-UTRs. Translating 80 S ribosomes are considered less sensitive to secondary structure than 40 S ribosomal subunits (33Liebhaber S.A. Cash F. Eshleman S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 609-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and thus should be relatively insensitive to the presence of secondary structure within the uORF in B1ASS, providing that this structure is sufficiently distant from the uORF start codon to rule out any interference with initiation on the uORF. Thus if reinitiation was responsible for cat translation in B1A, translation of this gene in B1ASS would not be expected to be very different from that of B1A. However, the results show that translation of the cat gene is very strongly inhibited in B1ASS, indicating that the translation of the cat gene in B1A is probably due primarily to leaky scanning and not reinitiation (Fig. 2). Another potential effect of the inserted stem-loop structure should be considered. A stable secondary structure (−22 kcal/mol) positioned downstream of the uAUG, might even allow better recognition of this AUG (probably because it slows ribosome scanning in the vicinity of the start codon, compare Ref. 34Kozak M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8301-8305Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), increasing levels of translation of the uORF. Thus in the case of a reinitiation mechanism, cat translation would have been expected to be at least as efficient in B1ASS as in B1A. Interestingly, the levels of cat expression in cells bearing B1ASS are more similar to those observed with B1SS, which contains the same secondary structure, but no uORF in the leader. Despite the observations discussed above, other evidence seems to indicate that reinitiation also occurs in B1A, albeit to a limited extent, and that its efficiency can be increased (Fig. 2 B). In constructs DSP30 and DSP80, the distance between the uORF and the cat gene was increased by 30 and 80 nucleotides, respectively. As argued by others (31Abastado J.P. Miller P.F. Jackson B.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 486-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 35Kozak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3438-3445Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), increasing the length between two ORFs may increase the probability that scanning ribosomes reinitiate translation at the downstream AUG. In this case, DSP30 and DSP80 should support higher levels of cat translation than B1A. This is indeed the result observed, although the difference between B1A and DSP30 is small (Fig. 2). The construct in which the uORF (+1 relative to the cat reading frame) overlaps the cat coding region (OL136) would be expected to support levels of cat expression not significantly different from that of B1A if leaky scanning was the dominant mechanism. However, if reinitiation was responsible for cat translation in B1A, the latter should decrease dramatically in OL136 (relative to B1A), since the termination codon of the uORF is inside the cat gene, 134 nucleotides downstream of the AUG. The translation of cat in OL136 was found to be reduced relative to B1A, although only by about 20% (Fig. 2). However, correction of the translation values for differences in mRNA abundance (see Fig. 5) would yield a greater inhibitory effect than this (approximately 35%). The B1AX3 construct (Fig. 1) does not allow differentiation between leaky scanning and reinitiation, but the results obtained with it indicate that the effects of the elements introduced into the leader act in series, as would be expected of a cap-dependent screening mechanism. In this construct, the presence of a secondary structure of predicted stability of −17 kcal/mol five nucleotides upstream of the cat initiation codon strongly inhibits translation (Fig. 2; compare Refs. 14Vega Laso M.R. Zhu D. Sagliocco F. Brown A.J.P. Tuite M.F. McCarthy J.E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6453-6462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 24Oliveira C.C. van den Heuvel J. McCarthy J.E.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This degree of inhibition is approximately equivalent to the inhibitory effect of the uORFs present in most of the constructs. Fig. 2B summarizes the results obtained from the various CAT assays and indicates the simplest theoretical explanations of the respective effects observed. Given that the differences between the various CAT values are in some cases quite small, we do not wish to overinterpret the individual results described above, but would rather focus attention on the sum of these data. Overall, this indicates that translation of cat in B1A is largely due to leaky scanning. The remaining translation of the cat gene in B1ASS may be at least partially attributable to reinitiation, since the secondary structure is expected to strongly inhibit leaky scanning. The rate of reinitiation can apparently be increased by lengthening the spacer between the uORF and the cat start codon. For comparative purposes, we investigated the influence of the GCN4 leader on cat translation. It was found to direct a very low level of cat expression. Indeed, after correction for relative mRNA abundance (see Fig. 5 B), the translation rate of the GCN4 construct was lower than any of the other constructs tested. The long leader of this gene, containing four uORFs, evidently inhibits translation of the main ORF very effectively. Since the uORFs in the GCN4 leader are known to mediate up-regulation of this gene in response to amino acid starvation, we investigated how the single uORF leaders used in the present work respond under the same conditions. This situation can be simulated in the cell by adding 3-aminotriazole to the medium (31Abastado J.P. Miller P.F. Jackson B.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 486-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The GCN4 leader directed a 2.5-fold increase of cat expression upon addition of 3-aminotriazole. This result indicates that the starvation-induced reinitiation in the GCN4 leader continues to function when the cat gene is substituted for the main GCN4 ORF. In contrast, translation of the cat constructs bearing single uORFs was not influenced by the addition of 3-aminotriazole (data not shown). Clearly, the single uORF leaders do not fulfill the structural requirements of a system intended to respond to changes in eIF-2˙GTP availability. It could be argued that the uORF in B1A is poorly translated and that leaky scanning is the sole mechanism responsible for cat translation. This would mean that the complete leader as such would allow very restricted initiation (at whatever AUG codon). In order to investigate this more directly, we performed polysomal gradient analysis on cell extracts from cells carrying the constructs B1O, B1A, and OL136 (Figs. 3 and 4). The results demonstrate that the mRNA B1O is mainly associated with polysomes, corroborating the data from the CAT assays showing that this mRNA is efficiently translated (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, the B1A mRNA, which directs only low rates of CAT synthesis, was associated primarily with monosomes and disomes, showing only poor representation in the larger polysomal fractions. The data are compared directly with those of B1O in Fig. 4A. Despite the relatively low steady-state amount of B1A mRNA in the cell (see Fig. 5 B), it is evident that the cat Northern blot signal of this construct in the monosome/disome region is comparable with that of B1O. This result is consistent with relatively efficient initiation on the uORF of B1A, but not on the main cat ORF. Finally, the OL136 mRNA was found associated with larger polysomes than B1A (Figs. 3 B and 4 B). Again, this mRNA is relatively poorly represented in the cell (Fig. 5 B), yet the Northern blot signals (Fig. 4 B) in the monosomal and early polysomal fractions of the gradient are relatively strong. Thus the uORF in this construct was probably also translated considerably more efficiently than the cat coding region, but being considerably"

In this study, we have cloned a cDNA encoding LAP1C. The DNA sequence predicts a 506-amino acid protein of largely hydrophilic character with a single membrane-spanning region between residues 311-333. Mapping of the epitope recognized by the anti-LAP1 monoclonal antibody RL13 indicates that the hydrophilic domain containing residues 1-310 is exposed to the nucleoplasm and thus that LAP1C is a type II integral membrane protein. A second class of LAP1 cDNAs was isolated that contains two protein-coding nucleotide insertions in the LAP1C sequence. These probably encode parts of LAPs1A and/or −1B, suggesting that LAP1 isotypes arise from alternative splicing. Immunoblot analysis of mouse P19 teratocarcinoma cells and the P19MES-differentiated derivative of the latter suggest that LAP1 isotypes are differentially expressed during development, similar to members of the nuclear lamin family.

The nuclear envelope (NE), 1The abbreviations used are:NEnuclear envelopekbkilobase(s)ORFopen reading framentnucleotide(s)PBSphosphate-buffered saline. the membrane boundary of the nucleus in eukaryotic cells, consists of inner and outer nuclear membranes, nuclear pore complexes, and nuclear lamina (1Gerace L. Burke B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 335-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). The lamina is a filamentous protein meshwork lining the inner nuclear membrane, which is thought to provide a structural framework for the NE and an anchoring site at the nuclear periphery for interphase chromosomes (2McKeon F.

Mammalian lamins have been classified into A and B subtypes, based on their sequence properties and state of membrane association during mitosis. B type lamins (lamins B1and B2) are present in somatic cells throughout development and remain membrane attached during M-phase, while A type lamins (lamins A and C) are expressed only during or following terminal differentiation in most cells and are not membrane-associated during mitosis (1Gerace L. Burke B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 335-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 3Nigg E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that both A- and B-type lamins bind to chromatin (5Glass J. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1047-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 6Höger T. Krohne G.

Biol. 1994; 14: 6297-6305Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that lamins play a direct role in the attachment of chromatin to the NE, although integral membrane proteins of the inner nuclear membrane also may contribute to this interaction (11Gerace L. Foisner R. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 127-131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Newly synthesized lamins A, B1, and B2are isoprenylated at carboxyl-terminal Caa X motifs, and this modification is important for their targeting to the inner nuclear membrane (2McKeon F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). While the isoprenylated tail of lamin A is proteolytically removed after the latter is assembled in the NE, B-type lamins remain stably isoprenylated. Lamin-attached lipid is likely to promote the association of the lamina with the inner nuclear membrane, possibly by direct interaction with lipid bilayer. However, by analogy to other systems involving protein prenylation (12Marshall C. Science. 1993; 259: 1865-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), it is likely that integral membrane proteins also are important for the lamina-inner membrane interaction (13Hennekes H. Nigg E. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1019-1029Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have identified several integral membrane proteins localized to the inner nuclear membrane that bind to lamins in vitro, which could play a role in this lamina attachment. These include lamina-associated polypeptides (LAPs)1 and −2 of mammalian cells (14Senior A. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2029-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 15Foisner R.

Also, a 53-kDa protein (otefin) of the inner nuclear membrane of Drosphila cells had been described (20Padan R. Nainudel-Epszteyn S. Goitein R. Fainsod A. Gruenbaum Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7808-7813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although its lamin binding has not been examined. LAP2 is a ∼51-kDa polypeptide that specifically binds to both lamin B and chromatin in a mitotic phosphorylation-regulated manner (15Foisner R. Gerace L. Cell. 1993; 73: 1267-1279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). cDNA cloning has shown that LAP2 contains a large hydrophilic amino-terminal domain exposed to the nucleoplasm and a single predicted membrane-spanning segment near its carboxyl terminus. 2Furukawa, K., Panté, N., Aebi, U., and Gerace, L. (1995) EMBO J. 14, in press. Three different isotypes of LAP1 ranging in size from 55-75 kDa (LAPs1A, −1B, and −1C) have been described in mammalian cells (14Senior A. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2029-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 15Foisner R. Gerace L. Cell. 1993; 73: 1267-1279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). In this study, we carried out cDNA cloning of LAP1C. We have found it to consist of 506 amino acids and have a substantially hydrophilic character, with only a single putative transmembrane segment. Monoclonal antibody epitope mapping combined with previous immunogold electron microscopy demonstrated that LAP1C is a type II integral membrane protein with approximately 60% of its mass exposed to the nucleoplasm. Analysis of LAP1 expression in liver and cultured cells suggested that substantial changes in the expression of LAP1 isotypes occur during development. Since different LAP1 isotypes appear to bind lamins with different affinities, this has important implications for understanding developmentally regulated changes in the organization of the nucleus. RNA was isolated from rat livers (Sprague-Dawley males, 6-8 weeks) using the guanidinium isothiocyanate method (21Lizardi P.M. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 24-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and polyadenylated RNA was prepared by chromatography on an oligo(dT) cellulose column. The poly(A)+RNA was used for preparation of a cDNA library in the λLAPII expression vector (by Marjorie Snead, Stratagene) using a mixture of random and oligo(dT) primers. The cDNA library contained 3.3 × 106primary clones, with a background of 5% non-recombinants. Approximately 4 × 105primary clones were screened with RL13 (α-LAP1) monoclonal antibody (14Senior A. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2029-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) that had been preadsorbed on an Escherichia coli/phage lysate. One positive clone with an insert size of approximately 2 kb (clone CO) was isolated. Oligonucleotides corresponding to the 5′-end of the clone CO were end labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) and used to probe a rat liver λgt11 cDNA library from Clontech, yielding a full-length clone for LAP1C (clone CL). Clone CO differs from clone CL in that it contains two additional short insertions of coding sequence. The first is found after nucleotide 713 of clone CL and extends 81 nucleotides, encoding 27 novel amino acids. The second is found after nucleotide 1059 of clone CL and extends 151 nucleotides, resulting in loss of residue 335 of the CL sequence and addition of 51 novel amino acids. In attempts to isolate additional CO-related clones, CO was labeled via the random-primed labeling method (Stratagene) and was used for nucleic acid screening of this same unamplified library, yielding three more independent clones. Six independent clones were found in a Stratagene rat hepatoma library, and three more were isolated from a rat macrophage library (generously provided by Dr. George Fey), all using this initial clone as a nucleotide probe. Restriction digestion and/or nucleotide sequencing indicated that seven of these clones contained either one or both of the insertions characteristic of CO, depending on whether they were sufficiently long enough to include both insertion sites. However, none of these clones extended sufficiently in the 5′-direction to yield cDNAs that would be predicted to encode the amino-terminal ends of LAP1A or 1B. The longest clone containing these two insertions had a 5′-end coinciding with nt 103 of LAP1C (predicted to begin at residue 17 of LAP1C). The original CL clone lacked a guanine at nt 1264, compared with all other LAP1-related cDNAs that were isolated (with or without the CO-like insertions). This would result in a stop after amino acid 412 of LAP1C (Fig. 1). Since all three LAP1 isotypes contain the sequence predicted at residues 466-479 of LAP1C as shown by reaction with anti-peptide antibodies against this region, this nucleotide loss is very likely a cloning artifact, and a CL clone reconstructed to contain this missing nucleotide (Fig. 1) was used for this study. Plasmids were rescued from λZAPII clones according to the manufacturer's instructions; inserts were subcloned into pBluescript SK (Stratagene) from λgt11 clones. All plasmids were propagated in XL-1 Blue cells (Stratagene). DNA was sequenced using the dideoxy chain termination method. Sequencing primers were synthesized as needed to obtain sequence information from both DNA strands. Sequences were analyzed using IntelliGenetics and GCG software. Total and poly(A)+RNA from HTC cells and poly(A)+RNA from rat liver were subjected to denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). After electroblotting onto HybondN transfer membrane (Amersham Corp.) in 25 m M sodium phosphate buffer at 600 mA for 1.5 h, the RNA was cross-linked to the membrane using ultraviolet light. The 5′- EcoRI fragment of clone CO (containing base pairs 417-1059 of LAP1C plus additional insertions; see above) was used to probe the blot. Hybridization was done in 5 × SSPE (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), 50% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% nonfat dry milk, and 100 μg/ml denatured, sonicated salmon sperm DNA at 37°C.

HTC, NIH 3T3, and P19MES cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and P19 cells were grown in α-minimal essential Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 7.5% bovine serum and 2.5% fetal bovine serum. In vitro transcription and translation was performed on both intact and linearized plasmid DNA using the Promega TNT-coupled transcription translation kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. For pulse labeling of cells in vivo, HTC cells grown to ∼75% confluency were rinsed in L-methionine- and L-cysteine-deficient Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum (starvation medium). Cells were then incubated in starvation medium for 30 min at 37°C. Starvation medium containing 0.5 mCi/ml Tran35S label (ICN Biomedicals) was added to the cells for 30 min, and cells were immediately harvested as described for immunoprecipitation. For overnight labeling, cells were maintained in labeling medium supplemented with cysteine and 20% of the normal level of methionine with 50 μCi/ml Tran35S label. NEs were isolated from rat liver and were salt washed in a buffer containing 0.5 M NaCl as described (24Snow C.A. Senior A. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1143-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). To prepare a NE-enriched fraction from cultured cells, cell monolayers were scraped into cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (10 m M sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 140 m M NaCl) and were pelleted at 100 × g for 5 min. Cells were then washed by resuspension and pelleting in cold homogenization buffer (HB) (10 m M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 m M KCl, 1.5 m M MgCl2, 1 m M dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors (1 m M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin)) and were swelled in one packed cell volume of HB on ice for 20 min. Cells were then disrupted with 20-30 strokes in a tight fitting glass Dounce homogenizer. Nuclei were pelleted at 500 × g for 5 min, resuspended in five packed cell volumes HB, given two more strokes in the Dounce homogenizer, and repelleted. Crude nuclear pellets were then brought to one cell volume of HB containing 50 μg/ml each of DNaseI and RNase A. After 20 min in a room temperature water bath, the digested nuclei were cooled to 0°C. Next, an equal volume of 2 M NaCl, 10 m M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 m M dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors was added, and NEs were immediately pelleted out of this solution at 2300 × g for 10 min and frozen in liquid N2. Antibodies were raised in rabbits against a trpE fusion protein containing a portion of LAP1. The expression construct was made by ligating an EcoRI fragment from clone CO into the PATH1 vector (25Spindler K. Rosser D. Berk A. J. Virol. 1984; 49: 132-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The trpE fusion protein contained the LAP1C region extending from residues 120-334 plus two short additional sequences: the 27 amino acids of the first CO insertion (see above) and the first 5 amino acids of the second. The fusion protein was expressed in E. coli, purified by electrophoresis on an SDS gel, and used to immunize rabbits. To prepare an affinity matrix for purifying anti-LAP1 antibodies from the rabbit antiserum, the EcoRI fragment from clone CO (above) was subcloned into pGEX2T (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). This second fusion protein was expressed, purified on glutathione-Sepharose, and coupled to CnBr-activated Sepharose (Pharmacia) at 0.5-1.0 mg/ml according to the manufacturer's instructions. Antibodies were adsorbed to the affinity column for 1 h at room temperature and, after washing of the column, were eluted with 3 M potassium thiocyanate, 0.5 M ammonium acetate, and 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (26Earnshaw W.C. Rothfield N. Chromosoma. 1985; 91: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Antibodies to a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 466-479 of LAP1C were produced by coupling the peptide to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and injecting the conjugate into guinea pigs. Monoclonal RL13 IgG (14Senior A. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2029-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) was purified on protein G-Sepharose and coupled to CnBr-activated Sepharose at 3-5 mg/ml for use as an immunoadsorbent. Extracts of cultured cells for immunoadsorption were obtained by rinsing cells in PBS and scraping into 1% Triton X-100, 20 m M Tris-HCl (8.8), 500 m M NaCl, 2 m M EDTA, and protease inhibitors (solubilization buffer). The cell lysate was sonicated briefly, incubated on ice for 30 min, and spun at 265,000 × g for 20 min to obtain a supernatant. Isolated rat liver NEs were solubilized in a similar manner, while in vitro translation products were simply diluted with 4 volumes of solubilization buffer. For immunoadsorption of LAP1 antigens from these various extracts, solubilized samples were incubated with RL13-Sepharose immunobeads overnight at 4°C. Antibody beads were then washed four times with solubilization buffer and once with solubilization buffer lacking Triton X-100. Bound proteins were eluted in SDS sample buffer lacking dithiothreitol. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out on 10% polyacrylamide gels as described (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar), and immunoblotting was performed essentially as previously described (24Snow C.A. Senior A. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1143-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). RL13 was used at 2.5 μg/ml and was detected with peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories Inc.) diluted 1:1000. Affinity-purified antifusion protein antibody was detected with peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG 1:1000 (Jackson). Guinea pig anti-peptide serum against residues 466-479 of LAP1C was diluted 1:100. In competition experiments, the diluted antibody was preincubated with 0.5 m M immunizing peptide. Guinea pig antisera against lamins A/C and lamin B were used at 1:500 dilution. Peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-guinea pig IgG 1:5000 (Jackson) was used to detect guinea pig antibodies. ECL reagents (Amersham Corp.) were used to detect all the secondary antibodies. For immunofluorescence microscopy, cells grown on coverslips were fixed for 4 min in 4% formaldehyde in PBS and were permeabilized for 4 min in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. All antibodies were diluted in 0.2% gelatin-containing PBS. RL13 was used at 20 μg/ml, and Texas red anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes Inc.) and rhodamine anti-rabbit (Jackson) were diluted 1:200. Primary antibody incubations were for 1 h at room temperature; secondary antibody incubations were for 20 min. We screened a cDNA expression library prepared from rat liver poly(A)+mRNA with the LAP1-specific monoclonal antibody RL13 to isolate clones encoding LAP1. A single ∼1.9-kb positive clone was isolated from an initial screen. An oligonucleotide corresponding to the 5′-end of this clone was used to screen a second rat liver cDNA expression library, resulting in isolation of additional cDNAs. DNA sequencing indicated that one of these clones (clone CL, 2307 nucleotides long) contained a large open reading frame (ORF) with well defined start and stop sites that could encode a protein having the approximate size of LAP1C. The nucleotide sequence of clone CL and the deduced amino acid sequence of the large ORF are shown in Fig. 1. The cDNA is predicted to encode a protein of 506 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 56,696 and a pI of 6.42. It should be noted that an in-frame stop codon is located nine nucleotides upstream of the predicted start site, indicating that this clone encodes the amino terminus of a protein-coding region. To validate that clone CL encoded a LAP1 isotype, we prepared polyclonal antibodies against a trpE fusion protein containing residues 120-334 of the open reading frame, as well as against a synthetic peptide encoding a second region (residues 466-479) of the ORF (see “Experimental Procedures”). These antibodies were used to analyze various mammalian cell and recombinant protein samples by immunoblotting (Fig. 2). RL13, the monoclonal antibody that originally defined the LAP1 antigens (14Senior A. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2029-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), recognized the ∼75-, ∼68-, and ∼55-kDa bands corresponding to LAPs1A, −1B, and −1C, respectively, in rat liver NEs (Fig. 2, RL13 panel, lane a) and in a sample of LAP1 antigens immunopurified from NEs (Fig. 2, RL13 panel, lane b). In immunopurified LAP1 antigens from cultured rat hepatoma (HTC) cells, RL13 recognized mainly LAP1C (Fig. 2, RL13 panel, lane c), the only major LAP1 isotype expressed in this cell type (14Senior A. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2029-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). However, a weak LAP1A band also was seen in some experiments (e.g. Fig. 2, α peptide panel). RL13 reacted with a number of weak bands in both rat liver and HTC cell samples, but these varied in intensity between different preparations (e.g. compare with Fig. 7) and most likely are proteolytic products. Finally, RL13 reacted with a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing residues 120-334 of the ORF, validating that the ORF we have isolated contains an RL13 epitope (Fig. 2, RL13 panel, lane d).FIG. 7Mapping the RL13 epitope in the LAP1C sequence. Three LAP1C-derived constructs were used for in vitro transcription/translation. Products were immunoadsorbed with the monoclonal antibody RL13 and analyzed by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and fluorography. Lane 1, full-length LAP1C; lane 2, NcoI-truncated LAP1C; lane 3, LAP1C from which the BbsI fragment was removed. Shown are immunoadsorbed fractions (pellets) from the three constructs and the unbound supernatant from BbsI deletion only.

The antibodies also reacted with three bands comigrating with LAPs1A-1C in isolated rat liver NEs, as well as with immunopurified LAPs1A-1C of NEs and immunopurified LAP1C of HTC cells (Fig. 2, α fusion panel). Similarly, the anti-peptide antiserum against residues 466-479 reacted with three bands having the mobility of LAPs1A-1C in isolated NEs, as well as with immunoadsorbed LAPs1A-1C of rat liver NEs and immunopurified LAP1C of HTC cells (Fig. 2, α peptide panel). The reaction of the anti-peptide antibodies with the LAP1 bands was specific, as antibody binding to these bands was selectively abolished by including an excess of immunizing peptide in immunoblot incubations (Fig. 2, α peptide + compet. panel). Thus, polyclonal antibodies raised against two separate regions of the ORF encoded by clone CL reacted specifically with all three rat LAP1 isotypes, arguing that clone CL encodes a LAP1 species. The data also support the possibility that the three LAP1 isotypes are closely related, as previously suggested by their cross-reaction with RL13. To further validate the identity of clone CL, we carried out immunofluorescence staining of cultured rat cells with affinity-purified antibodies against residues 120-334 of the ORF. These antibodies stained the nuclear periphery in an approximately continuous rim-like pattern (Fig. 3 c) that was identical to the labeling obtained with RL13 (Fig. 3 a). In mitotic cells where the NE was disassembled, the antibodies against residues 120-334 labeled the cytoplasm in a diffuse fashion (data not shown), similar to the labeling of mitotic cells obtained with RL13 (14Senior A. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2029-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Thus, not only do the antibodies against the ORF of clone CL react with LAP1 on immunoblots, they also specifically stain NEs in a LAP1-like fashion. Considered together, these results indicate that clone CL is a cDNA for a LAP1 isotype. The ORF encoded by clone CL was expressed by coupled in vitro transcription/translation and analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis (Fig. 4). The translation product was found to have a very similar mobility to pulse-labeled LAP1C that was immunoadsorbed from HTC cells (Fig. 4). Close examination showed that the pulse-labeled LAP1C from the cultured cells, which comigrated with LAP1C of rat liver NEs (data not shown), migrated slightly (∼1 kDa) faster than the in vitro translation product (Fig. 4, compare lanes 1 and 2). This difference was confirmed by coelectrophoresis of the two samples (Fig. 4, lane 3). Moreover, LAP1C immunoadsorbed from HTC cells that had been continuously labeled for 16 h also migrated faster than the in vitro translation product (Fig. 4, lanes 4 and 5). Hence, there is a small but reproducible difference between the gel mobility of the in vitro translation product and LAP1C from cultured hepatoma cells. It is conceivable that this is due to a posttranslational modification associated with LAP1C of HTC cells that is absent from the in vitro translation product. In any case, because the in vitro translation product migrates very close to LAP1C of HTC cells, we conclude that the ORF of clone CL very likely encodes LAP1C. We have attempted to isolate cDNAs encoding LAP1A and LAP1B by nucleotide screening of several cDNA libraries but have been unable to isolate clones sufficiently large enough to encode these proteins. Nevertheless, we have isolated eight independent LAP1C-like cDNAs that are likely to contain partial length clones derived from either or both LAPs1A and −1B (see “Experimental Procedures”). This cDNA class is identical in sequence to corresponding portions of the LAP1C clone except that it contains insertions after nucleotides 713 and 1059 of LAP1C (indicated by arrowheads in the LAP1C sequence of Fig. 1). The three clones of this group that are sufficiently long enough to include both insertion sites contained both insertions. The first insertion extends 81 base pairs and encodes 27 novel amino acids. The second insertion extends 151 base pairs, resulting in loss of residue 335 of LAP1C and addition of 51 novel amino acids (Fig. 5). Considered together, these data sugg"
https://openalex.org/W2063409224,"Rb represses E2F-mediated transcription in part by blocking the trans-activation domain of E2F. In addition, Rb can convert an E2F binding site from a positive to a negative element. To examine the effect of a Rb-DNA-bound complex on transcription, full-length Rb was fused to the DNA binding domain of GAL4. Here, we report that GAL4-Rb can repress transcription mediated by either Sp1, AP-1, or p53, dependent upon the presence of both the GAL4 DNA binding domain and GAL4 binding sites. Moreover, GAL4-Rb inhibited the activity of the herpes simplex virus tk promoter from GAL4 binding sites located at a distance from the promoter. In contrast, GAL4-Rb was unable to repress basal transcription. Cotransfection of specific cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases or SV40 T-antigen abolished the repressive activity of GAL4-Rb. The domains of Rb involved in mediating the repression of transcription were mapped to regions that are overlapping, but not identical, to those required for the interaction with E2F. We propose that Rb can function as a general repressor of transcription when bound to the promoter region."
https://openalex.org/W1992793825,"The formation of higher order protein˙DNA structures often requires bending of DNA strands between specific sites, a process that can be facilitated by the action of nonspecific DNA-binding proteins which serve as assembly factors. A model for this activity is the formation of the invertasome, an intermediate structure created in the Hin-mediated site-specific DNA inversion reaction, which is stimulated by the prokaryotic nucleoid-associated protein HU. Previously, we have shown that the mammalian HMG1/2 proteins substitute for HU in this system and display efficient DNA wrapping activity in vitro. In the present work, we isolate the primary sources of assembly factor activity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as measured by the ability to stimulate invertasome formation, and show that these are the previously identified NHP6A/B proteins. NHP6A/B have comparable or greater activity in DNA binding, bending, and supercoiling with respect to HU and HMG1 and appear to form more stable protein˙DNA complexes. In addition, expression of NHP6A in mutant Escherichia coli cells lacking HU and Fis restores normal morphological appearance to these cells, specifically in nucleoid condensation and segregation. From these data we predict diverse architectural roles for NHP6A/B in manipulating chromosome structure and promoting the assembly of multicomponent protein˙DNA complexes.

Many DNA transactions involve the formation of nucleoprotein structures containing multiple proteins and DNA sites. These complexes have been shown to include not only the DNA molecule and relevant sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins, but in some cases also require nonspecific DNA-binding proteins which serve as accessory factors in these reactions. The exact functions of such “architectural” proteins probably vary between experimental systems, but in most instances studied thus far they have been shown to stimulate complex formation by bending or wrapping the DNA strands into specific configurations such that other proteins can interact productively to carry out the reaction (1Nash H.A.

Cell. 1994; 77: 167-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). One of the best examples of such an assembly factor is the prokaryotic protein HU. This abundant heterodimeric protein binds DNA nonspecifically in vitro and is thought to be associated with the bacterial nucleoid in vivo (6Drlica K. Rouviere-Yaniv J. Microbiol.

Johnson R.C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2503-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Given the known ability of HU to bend DNA (15Hodges-Garcia Y. Hagerman P.J. Pettijohn D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14621-14623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Paull T.T. Haykinson M.J. Johnson R.C. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1521-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), its proposed role in this reaction is to wrap the short length of DNA helix into a loop such that the Hin recombinase and the Fis protein can associate into a stable complex. HU also stimulates formation of the type 1 transpososome, an intermediate structure necessary for transposition by bacteriophage Mu. Its role in this system involves catalyzing the assembly of MuA transposase at the left end of the Mu DNA, perhaps in a manner specific to the spatial configuration of MuA binding sites in this region (12Lavoie B.D. Chaconas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1623-1627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Baker T.A. Mizuuchi K.

In addition, HU partially substitutes for the related but sequence-specific DNA-binding protein IHF (integration host factor) in phage λ excision (18Goodman S.D. Nicholson S.C. Nash H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11910-11914Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 19Segall A.M. Goodman S.D. Nash H.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4536-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The functional replacement of IHF binding sites in the attP region of λ with either phased A-tracts or a cAMP receptor protein binding site supports the interpretation of a primarily structural role for IHF (and HU) in this system (20Goodman S.D.

In mammals, the functional equivalents of HU appear to be the high mobility group (HMG) proteins 1 and 2, which are also abundant and thought to be associated with chromatin in vivo (21Landsman D. Bustin M. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). HMG1 and −2 efficiently substitute for HU in stimulating invertasome formation in the Hin DNA inversion reaction (16Paull T.T. Haykinson M.J. Johnson R.C. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1521-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The mammalian proteins facilitate invertasome formation on substrates containing one helical turn less DNA in the loop between the recombinational enhancer and a hix site (see Fig. 1) compared to the smallest substrates assembled into invertasomes in the presence of HU (16Paull T.T. Haykinson M.J. Johnson R.C. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1521-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). HMG1 and −2 have also been shown to be even more effective than HU in bending DNA as measured by the formation of small DNA circles in the presence of T4 DNA ligase. Both HMG proteins facilitate the formation of 66-bp DNA circles, which are one helical turn shorter than the smallest formed in the presence of HU (16Paull T.T. Haykinson M.J. Johnson R.C. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1521-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). HMG1 can also substitute for HU in promoting the Mu strand cleavage reaction (22Lavoie B.D. Chaconas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15571-15576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in stimulating λ intasome formation (19Segall A.M. Goodman S.D. Nash H.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4536-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). A role for HMG1 and HMG2 in transcription has been implicated in some systems (23Tremethick D.J. Molloy P.L. J. Biol.

Dixon G.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6295-6302Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) although the C-terminal acidic tail apparently does not function as a general transcriptional activator domain (26Landsman D. Bustin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4483-4489Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). HMG1 has also been shown to bind with high affinity to cruciform structures (27Bianchi M.E. Beltrame M. Paonessa G. Science. 1989; 243: 1056-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar), cisplatinated DNA (28Pil P.M. Lippard S.J. Science. 1992; 256: 234-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar), and to associate with histone H1 (29Kohlstaedt L.A. Cole R.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 570-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Despite the large number of in vitro studies performed on HMG1/2, their biological roles in vivo remain to be demonstrated. As the first step in an attempt to characterize these roles genetically, we have identified functional equivalents of HMG1/2 in yeast by using the Hin-mediated DNA inversion reaction as an assay for DNA bending or wrapping activity. In this work, we show that the two yeast proteins detected by this method are the non-histone proteins (NHP) 6A and NHP6B which had previously been isolated on the basis of solubility and amino acid sequence similarity to mammalian HMG proteins (30Kolodrubetz D. Haggren W. Burgum A. FEBS Lett. 1988; 238: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The DNA binding and bending abilities of NHP6A/B are investigated, as well as their effects on DNA supercoiling and on the phenotypes of bacterial mutants lacking general nucleoid-associated proteins. Supercoiling assays and microscopy studies were performed using the following E. coli strains: CAG4000 (MG1655 Δ lacX74, obtained from C. Gross), RJ1975 (CAG4000 hupA::cm hupB::km), RJ1995 (RJ1975 fis-985), and RJ1999 (RJ1975 himA83-Tn 10). Genes were disrupted by P1 transduction using lysates made from NH277 (hupB: km) and NH278 (hupA: cm) (provided by P. Higgins), RJ1803 (fis-985) (65Ball C.A. Osuna R. Ferguson K.C. Johnson R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 8043-8056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and N6127 (himA83-Tn 10, obtained from H. Miller). Recombinant NHP6A/B protein was produced in RJ1878 (BL21 (DE3) (Novagen) hupA::cm hupB::km). λ excision assays (66Ball C.A. Johnson R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4027-4031Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were performed using RJ3031 (CAG4000 himA83-Tn10 λcI857 S7), RJ3030 (RJ1999 λcI857 S7), and RJ3030 containing pRJ1227. Construction of NHP6A/B plasmids was as follows: the NHP6A and NHP6B genes were obtained by polymerase chain reaction of genomic Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA (gift of E. Bensen and G. Payne) with NdeI and BamHI sites engineered at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The polymerase chain reaction products were digested with NdeI and BamHI and were ligated into pET11a (Novagen) to create pRJ1228 (NHP6A) and pRJ1229 (NHP6B) containing the NHP6A/B genes under the control of the T7 promoter. The NdeI- BamHI fragment from pRJ1228 was then inserted into the BamHI site of a pBR322 derivative containing the lacP UV5 promoter between the EcoRI and BamHI sites by ligating the BamHI sites first, filling in the remaining BamHI and NdeI ends with T4 DNA polymerase and dNTPs, and ligating the blunt ends together to create pRJ1226, containing NHP6A under the control of the lac promoter. This plasmid was then cut with SspI and BamHI to excise the lacP-NHP6A region which was ligated between the BclI and ScaI sites on pRJ823 (pACYC184 lacIq), after filling in protruding ends with T4 DNA polymerase and dNTPs, to create pRJ1227. Expression of NHP6A under the control of the lac promoter during exponential growth yielded approximately 5000-10000 molecules of protein per cell as determined by Western blotting of cell lysates (data not shown). Unless otherwise noted, all cleavage assays contained pMS551-83, a plasmid substrate containing hixL1, hixL2, and the Hin recombinational enhancer in pBR322 with 83 bp between the center of hixL1 and the center of the proximal Fis binding site in the enhancer, as described (14Haykinson M.J. Johnson R.C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2503-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In vitro cleavage assays were performed as described previously (14Haykinson M.J. Johnson R.C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2503-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), although in some cases (Fig. 3), 50 m M CHAPS was added to the reactions. Incubations were for 3 min in standard reactions and 0.25 min in reactions containing CHAPS to measure reaction rates. Ligation substrates were made by polymerase chain reaction of the set of recombination substrates containing varying DNA lengths between the enhancer and hixL1 as described (16Paull T.T. Haykinson M.J. Johnson R.C. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1521-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Each fragment was internally labeled with [α-32P]dATP and digested with EcoRI. Note that the protein:DNA molar ratios cited previously (16Paull T.T. Haykinson M.J. Johnson R.C. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1521-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) were 10-fold lower than the actual ratios, due to an error in quantitation. Ligation assays were performed as described previously (16Paull T.T. Haykinson M.J. Johnson R.C. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1521-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Hin, Fis, HU, and bovine HMG1/2 were purified as described (14Haykinson M.J. Johnson R.C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2503-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 16Paull T.T. Haykinson M.J.

NHP6A/B were isolated from both whole cell and nuclear extracts from S. cerevisiae BJ1991(MATα prb1-112 pep4-3 leu2 trp1 ura3-52, obtained from A. Carmen and M. Grunstein). Whole cell extracts were prepared by passage of cells twice through a French press in buffer containing 10 m M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 m M NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 m M dithiothreitol, 10 m M EDTA, 3 m M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, antipain, pepstatin, and chymostatin, followed by centrifugation at 30,000 × g. Nuclear extracts were prepared using a modified combination of protocols (67May R. Z. Allg. Mikrobiol. 1971; 11: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 68Almer A. Horz W.

Mellor, personal communication. which involves spheroplast formation by lyticase (Enzogenetics), osmotic lysis of spheroplasts in a buffered 9% Ficoll solution, and purification of nuclei by centrifugation through a 30% Ficoll cushion. Isolated nuclei were incubated in extraction buffer: 10 m M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.25 M sorbitol, 1 m M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, containing 0.5 M NaCl on ice for ≥1 h. Nuclear debris was then pelleted at 20,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected. Whole cell and nuclear extracts were selectively extracted with 30%, 60%, and 90% saturated ammonium sulfate (removed by overnight dialysis against buffer A: 10 m M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, 0.1 m M EDTA, and 50 m M NaCl) or with 2% followed by 10% trichloroacetic acid (removed by washing the pellet with acetone, lyophilization, and resuspension in buffer A). Activity in the cleavage assay was first seen at this stage of the purification and only in the 60-90% ammonium sulfate and 2-10% trichloroacetic acid precipitates. These were then loaded onto a heparin-agarose column equilibrated in buffer A and eluted in a linear salt gradient from 50 m M to 1 M NaCl. The activity eluted from the column with 0.4-0.5 M NaCl. Fractions were pooled, dialyzed against buffer A, and loaded onto an FPLC Mono Q column (Pharmacia Biotech) in the same buffer. The flow-through fractions were then loaded onto a HR5/10 reverse-phase FPLC column (Pharmacia) and eluted with a continuous gradient from 0 to 100% acetonitrile. Fractions containing NHP6A and NHP6B eluted at 27% and 30% acetonitrile, respectively. Acetonitrile was removed by lyophilization, and pellets were resuspended in buffer A. Amino acid composition analysis and N-terminal sequencing of active fractions identified each peak unambiguously as NHP6A/B. All protein concentrations were determined by Bradford (Pierce) assays, using bovine serum albumin as the standard, adjusted for each protein by values obtained by quantitative amino acid analysis. Recombinant NHP6A and NHP6B were produced in E. coli strain RJ1878 containing pRJ1228 and pRJ1229, respectively. Protein expression was induced by addition of 1 m M IPTG at OD600= 0.5 for 30 min (NHP6A) or 2 h (NHP6B). The lysis procedure was essentially as described for HU (69Johnson R.C. Simon M.I. Cell. 1985; 41: 781-791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), except that the final supernatant was dialyzed into buffer A overnight. The partially purified proteins were loaded onto an EconoPak S cartridge (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in buffer A, washed with 0.35 M NaCl, and eluted with a linear gradient from 0.35 M to 0.65 M NaCl in buffer A. Both NHP6A/B proteins eluted at ∼0.5 M NaCl. Fractions containing the yeast proteins were dialyzed against buffer A overnight and then loaded onto a heparin-agarose column (Bio-Rad), washed with buffer A and 0.3 M NaCl, followed by a linear gradient from 0.3 M to 0.6 M NaCl in buffer A. Both NHP6A/B proteins eluted at ∼0.5 M NaCl, and fractions contained no other polypeptides visible by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels. DNA fragments used in gel-shift assays were: 46-bp (GACGTCAATCTTCTTGAAAACCAAGGTTTTTGATAAGATCAGGCCT), 34-bp (AGCTTACTAGTGCAAATTGTGACCGCATTTTTGA), 26-bp (ATACTAGTGCAAATTGTGACCGCATT), and 21-bp (CTAGTGCAAATTGTGACCGCA). 20-μl reactions contained 20 m M HEPES (pH 7.5), 40 m M NaCl, 10 m M EDTA, 2 μg of bovine serum albumin, 5% glycerol, and 0.5 × TBE. Proteins in each reaction were incubated with ≤1 ng of 32P-labeled DNA fragment at 30°C for at least 10 min before loading onto the gel, which contained 5%, 8%, or 10% acrylamide (60:1 acrylamide:bis) and 0.5 × TBE. Gels were run at 6-8 V/cm for 2-3 h, fixed, dried, and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak). No significant differences in relative affinities were observed in protein˙DNA complex formation between DNA fragments of varying sequences. In vitro assays contained 0.1 pmol of pBR322, 50 m M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 m M KCl, 10 m M MgCl2, 0.1 m M EDTA, 0.5 m M dithiothreitol, and 30 μg/ml bovine serum albumin per 20-μl reaction. Plasmid DNA was first completely relaxed with topoisomerase I (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 1 h at 37°C, then incubated with varying amounts of protein plus 1 unit of additional topoisomerase I for 1 h at 37°C before the addition of 0.5% SDS and 5 μg of proteinase K. Reactions were further incubated for ≥15 min before loading onto a 0.7% agarose gel containing Tris-phosphate-EDTA (TPE) buffer (70Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1982Google Scholar) and electrophoresed at 2 V/cm for approximately 24 h. In vivo assays were done in E. coli strains CAG4000 (wild-type) and RJ1975 (hupAhupB) containing plasmid substrate pRJ1227. Plasmid DNA was isolated from 5-ml cultures of CAG4000, RJ1975, and RJ1975 grown in the presence of 1 m M IPTG. Each strain was grown to an OD600 of 0.5 from a 1:500 dilution of an overnight culture (uninduced), and DNA was recovered using a modified alkaline lysis protocol. DNA obtained was electrophoresed on a 0.7% TPE agarose gel in the presence of 13 μg/ml chloroquine at 2 V/cm for ∼24 h. All E. coli strains described in Fig. 7, Fig. 8, and Table I were inoculated into LB from a single colony, grown to early log phase (OD600 = ∼0.3), and fixed as described (71Hiraga S. Niki H. Ogura T. Ichinose C. Mori H. Ezaki B. Jaffe A. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1496-1505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RJ1975 (hupAhupB) and RJ1995 (hupAhupB fis) strains contained pRJ823 (lacIq) with or without pRJ1226 (lacP-NHP6A). All mutant strains were grown in the presence of 200 μM IPTG. Cells were visualized using a 100× Oel objective lens (Zeiss) on a Microphot-FXA microscope (Nikon) and photographed using 160 tungsten Ektachrome color slide film (Kodak). Cell lengths, nucleoid areas, and percent anucleate cell levels were quantitated using an HP9864A digitizer with the Sigmascan analysis program.FIG. 8Distributions of nucleoid area in E. coli mutants.

A minimum of 500 cells were analyzed for each strain. Our primary assay for DNA-wrapping proteins is the formation of an intermediate structure required for Hin-mediated DNA inversion, shown in Fig. 1(31Johnson R.C. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1991; 1: 404-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A dimer of the Hin recombinase binds to each of the recombination sites, hixL1and hixL2(Fig. 1, A and B). Two dimers of the Fis protein bind to the recombinational enhancer, which associates with the Hin-bound hix sites into a specific intermediate configuration called the invertasome (Fig. 1 C). In the presence of ethylene glycol and the absence of magnesium, invertasome complexes are trapped and do not continue through the inversion pathway. Under these “cleavage” conditions, the amount of Hin-mediated cutting at the center of one or both of the hix sites corresponds to the amount of invertasome complex formed during the reaction. Under standard conditions, however, Hin then catalyzes DNA strand exchange and ligation (Fig. 1 D) such that the DNA segment between the hix sites is inverted (Fig. 1 E). On substrates which contain less than approximately 100 bp between a hix site and the enhancer, the presence of HU, HMG1, or HMG2 is necessary for efficient invertasome formation (14Haykinson M.J. Johnson R.C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2503-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 16Paull T.T. Haykinson M.J. Johnson R.C. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1521-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). To identify yeast proteins which substitute for HU, whole cell and nuclear extracts from S. cerevisiae were assayed using the Hin cleavage reaction on a DNA substrate containing 83 bp between hixL1and the recombinational enhancer. Activity was not seen in initial S30 supernatants, but appeared after either selective ammonium sulfate or trichloroacetic acid precipitations (as described under “Experimental Procedures”). Active fractions were then sequentially separated on heparin-agarose, Mono Q, and reverse-phase chromatography columns. Fractions from the last step of the purification, an HR5/10 reverse-phase FPLC column, are shown in Fig. 2A after electrophoresis on a denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel and silver staining. In cleavage assays, the invertasome-stimulating activities corresponded to the fractions containing protein peaks in lanes 5-8 and lanes 10-14. Amino acid composition analysis and N-terminal sequencing determined that the first peak contained NHP6A and the second peak contained NHP6B. These two related proteins are transcribed from different genes although they are 87% identical and each contains one “HMG box,” a DNA binding motif now found in many different specific and nonspecific proteins (21Landsman D. Bustin M. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 32Kolodrubetz D. Burgum A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3234-3239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The HMG boxes in NHP6A and NHP6B are 45% and 40% identical with domain B of HMG1, respectively. Minor bands above the major ones in Fig. 2A are probably modified forms of the two proteins. To obtain large quantities of NHP6A and NHP6B, recombinant forms of the proteins were expressed under the control of the T7 promoter in bacteria and then purified to homogeneity by ion exchange chromatography. The effect of the yeast proteins on formation of invertasome structures in vitro is clearly seen in Fig. 2 B. Lane 1 contains a cleavage reaction in the presence of 100 ng of HMG1 (arrows indicate the linearized plasmid (one hix site cut), vector, and released intervening segment (two hix sites cut)). The reaction in lane 2 contains no accessory protein, and lanes 3-9 and 10-16 contain titrations of NHP6A and NHP6B, respectively. High levels of cleaved DNA substrate are seen in the presence of both proteins. The modified forms of NHP6A/B seen in Fig. 2 A are not observed in the bacterial extracts and are apparently not necessary for the activity of these proteins in our assays because the recombinant proteins exhibit virtually identical stimulation in cleavage assays compared to their native counterparts. Unless specified, all characterization of NHP6A/B shown in this work was done with the recombinant forms of the proteins. NHP6A/B each exhibit similar activity in the cleavage assay compared to HU and HMG1. Fig. 3 shows the percentage of DNA substrate molecules formed into invertasome complexes in the presence of varying amounts of the native yeast proteins. The optimum ratio of protein to DNA in these reactions is approximately 30-40 protein monomers per plasmid substrate, although significant stimulation is observed even with ratios of 5-10. Unlike HU and HMG1, however, NHP6A/B also completely inhibit invertasome formation at higher concentrations. With more than 50 molecules of protein for each DNA substrate, the amounts of cleaved substrate decrease with increasing protein concentration until even the basal reaction is inhibited (also seen in Fig. 2 B). Unlike HU and HMG1/2, the yeast proteins also do not appear to stimulate the complete inversion reaction under conditions in which the DNA strands are exchanged and religated after DNA strand cleavage (data not shown), an observation perhaps explained by the unique DNA binding characteristics of NHP6A/B (see below). To investigate the relative stability of NHP6A/B˙DNA complexes in comparison to those containing HU or HMG1, each of these proteins was added to a 46-bp 32P-labeled double-stranded DNA and run in a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel to separate the protein-bound DNA from the free DNA fragments. At high protein concentrations (100-1600 ng/reaction), HU and HMG1 form nondistinct high molecular weight complexes (Fig. 4 A). Under the conditions used, HU does not form a ladder of specific complexes with DNA fragments, in contrast to other reports (33Bonnefoy E. Rouviere-Yaniv J.

CD13/APN transcription is initiated from two physically distinct sites in myeloid and intestinal epithelial cells and is directed by separate functional promoters (32Shapiro L.H. Ashmun R.A. Roberts W.M. Look A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11999-12007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here the nucleotide sequences responsible for CD13/APN reporter gene expression in myeloid cells are identified. Because this regulatory region contains both Myb and Ets consensus-binding sites, the possibility that these two important transcription factors control myeloid cell-specific CD13/APN expression was examined. The results presented show that a truncated or full-length form of c-Myb and the full-length Ets-1 or Ets-2 protein cooperate to transactivate the CD13/APN promoter and that the Myb consensus-binding site is essential for transcription of this differentiation-linked gene in hematopoietic cells. Human cell lines included the lymphoid leukemia lines MOLT-4 (ATCC CRL1582) and Jurkat (ATCC TIB152), the myeloid leukemia lines U937 (ATCC CRL1593) and KG1a (ATCC CCL246.1), the epithelial cell line C33A (ATCC HTB31), and the fibroblast line VA-2 (33Lemons R.S. Nash W.G. O'Brien S.J. Benveniste R.E. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1978; 14: 995-1005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells (ATCC CRL1651) were used to transiently express c-Myb proteins for the DNA binding assays. Nonadherent cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 medium, and adherent lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 m ML-glutamine and 10% fetal calf serum. A 1158-bp XbaI/ HaeII CD13/APN genomic restriction fragment ending within exon 1 was ligated into the XbaI site of the promoterless and enhancerless luciferase reporter plasmid (pGL2basic; Promega) to produce the p-1150luc construct. This construct contains sequences from bp −1158 to +65 of the CD13/APN myeloid promoter (32Shapiro L.H. Ashmun R.A. Roberts W.M. Look A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11999-12007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 5′-Deletion mutants constructed in the pGL2basic backbone were designated as −411luc, −291luc, −120luc, and −40luc reporter plasmids. The Myb consensus site in the −411luc reporter construct was changed from TAACGGAC to TCTTGGAC using the Transformer kit (CLONTECH) to produce the mybmutluc plasmid. Plasmids were also constructed that linked genomic sequences to the neoRgene. A 2.34-kb HindIII cassette containing neoR(34Ulrich M.J. Ley T.J. Blood. 1990; 75: 990-999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was ligated into the HindIII site of pBluescript SK+, and CD13/APN genomic sequences (1158-bp XbaI/ HaeII genomic fragment) were inserted into the XbaI site of the vector (pPFMyneo). To facilitate analysis of deletion constructs, the KG1a and Jurkat cell lines were electroporated with 10 μg of the wild-type or deletion constructs and 4 μg of the control MAP1-SEAP (where SEAP represents secreted alkaline phosphatase) plasmid (35Bram R.J. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) as described (36Zhang D.E. Fujioka K. Hetherington C.J. Shapiro L.H. Chen H.M. Look A.T. Tenen D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8085-8095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). C33A epithelial cells were transfected with 1 μg of the wild-type or deletion constructs and 0.5 μg of the control plasmid by the calcium phosphate method (32Shapiro L.H. Ashmun R.A. Roberts W.M. Look A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11999-12007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transfection efficiency with each construct was normalized to the control level of secreted alkaline phosphatase activity (37Bram R.J. Hung D.T. Martin P.K. Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4760-4769Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar); the reported values were calculated as relative light units/unit of secreted alkaline phosphatase activity. To compare results among the different cell lines, transcriptional activity was expressed as the -fold increase over that produced with the enhancerless luciferase vector, pGL2basic, determined in parallel transfections. Each experiment was repeated at least three times. For S1 analysis, the pPFMyneo and p-411neo plasmids were cotransfected with the pRSVneo plasmid into U937 and MOLT-4 cell lines as described (36Zhang D.E. Fujioka K. Hetherington C.J. Shapiro L.H.

For transactivation assays, C33A epithelial cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method (32Shapiro L.H. Ashmun R.A. Roberts W.M. Look A.T. J. Biol.

For transient expression of the Myb protein, COS-7 cells were transfected with the pCMV4cMyb plasmid by the DEAE-dextran method as described (40Aruffo A. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley-Interscience, New York1988: 16.13.1-16.13.7Google Scholar). Assays to detect luciferase activity were performed as described (41Pahl H.L. Burn T.C. Tenen D.G. Exp. Hematol. 1991; 19: 1038-1041PubMed Google Scholar). 100-μl aliquots of total cellular protein from lysates representing each transfection condition were tested for luciferase activity, and the resulting values were normalized according to secreted alkaline phosphatase activity assayed as described (37Bram R.J. Hung D.T. Martin P.K. Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4760-4769Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). S1 mapping was performed with end-labeled DNA probes as described (32Shapiro L.H. Ashmun R.A. Roberts W.M. Look A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11999-12007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pPFMyneo plasmid was digested with BglII, which cuts within the neoRgene, dephosphorylated, and end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Total cellular RNAs (20 μg) were hybridized with the end-labeled DNA fragments (50,000 dpm) for 16 h at 52°C. The samples were digested with S1 nuclease and analyzed by autoradiography after electrophoresis on 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. For DNA binding assays, transiently transfected COS-7 whole cell lysates were freshly prepared by scraping the cells into cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspending the pellet in 0.2 ml of lysis buffer (20 m M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 m M dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, and 50 m M KCl). After the addition of Triton X-100 to a 0.2% (v/v) final concentration, the lysate was incubated on ice for 15 min, and the debris was pelleted for 5 min at 12,500 rpm. Cell lysate (8 μl, ∼15-20 μg) from either mock- or pCMV4cMyb-transfected COS-7 cells or 100 ng of GST-Ets-DBD protein (where GST represents glutathione S-transferase and Ets-DBD represents the Ets DNA-binding domain) was preincubated in binding buffer (10 m M Hepes, pH 7.9, 50 m M KCl, 5 m M MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 m M dithiothreitol, and 1 μg of poly[d(I-C)]) in 25-μl reactions with or without 100 ng of the consensus or mutant double-stranded oligonucleotide competitors (mimAmyb, CTAGGACATTATAACGGTTTTTTAGT (39Badiani P.

For supershift experiments, 1 μl of a murine anti-Myb monoclonal antibody (Type 1; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) or an isotype-matched irrelevant control monoclonal antibody was preincubated with lysate for 10 min at 30°C before probe addition. The 32P-end-labeled oligonucleotide probe containing the CD13/APN Myb consensus site (CD13Myb, CCGGATCCTAACGGACCGGC) or the genomic fragment probe (XbaI/ DdeI fragment, containing bp −411 to −281) was then added and incubated for an additional 15 min at 30°C. Binding reactions were electrophoresed through a 5% acrylamide gel in Tris borate buffer at 4°C. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. Recombinant glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing the bacterially expressed Ets DNA-binding domain (GST-Ets-DBD) was purified from bacterial cell lysates by a standard glutathione-bead method. The GST-Ets-DBD plasmid was the gift of Dr. Michael Ostrowski (Duke University). A 1-kb genomic fragment of the CD13/APN gene, which includes sequences immediately upstream of the myeloid and fibroblast transcription initiation sites, can direct correctly initiated reporter gene expression (32Shapiro L.H. Ashmun R.A. Roberts W.M. Look A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11999-12007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm that this region includes myeloid-specific regulatory elements, the pPFMyneo and control pRSVneo plasmids were cotransfected into a panel of cell lines known to use either the upstream (U937 and VA-2) or the downstream (HepG2) CD13/APN promoter or to lack CD13/APN transcripts altogether (MOLT-4). S1 nuclease analysis of the RNAs produced by the resulting neomycin-resistant stable lines showed substantial levels of correctly initiated transcripts in the U937 myeloid transfectant, which expresses endogenous CD13/APN at high levels, with much lower levels detected in the MOLT-4 lymphoid, HepG2 liver, and VA-2 fibroblast transfectants (Fig. 1 A). Deletional analysis of the promoter fragment showed that constructs containing 411 bp of upstream sequences were sufficient for correctly initiated, tissue-appropriate transcription of the neoRreporter gene (Fig. 1 B). These results indicate that a 411-bp region within the original 1-kb fragment contains the elements responsible for myeloid-specific CD13/APN gene expression. The absence of transcripts in fibroblasts (Fig. 1 A) that normally initiate CD13/APN transcription from the same upstream promoter used by myeloid cells suggests that some of the elements responsible for fibroblast-specific transcription of the CD13/APN gene do not reside within this fragment. A Positive Regulator of CD13/APN Activity Is Located in the Region between bp −291 and −411-To further localize the myeloid-specific region of CD13/APN regulation, 5′-deletion mutants of the myeloid cell promoter were inserted upstream of the luciferase reporter gene. The results of transient transfection of the reporter constructs into the KG1a myeloblastic cell line, the C33A epithelial cell line, and the Jurkat T-ALL cell line (Fig. 2) confirmed the myeloid specificity of the 1-kb fragment used in the preceding experiment: the p-1150luc construct was expressed at ∼6-fold higher levels in the myeloid cell line than in either the T-cell or epithelial cell line. More important, the −411luc construct retained myeloid specificity, while removal of sequences upstream of bp −291 resulted in comparably lower levels of activity in each of the three cell lines, indicating that a positive regulatory element resides between bp −291 and −411.FIG. 2A positive element regulating CD13/APN expression in myeloid cells is located in the region between bp -291 and -411. Reporter constructs with deletions from the 5′ -end of the CD13/APN myeloid promoter, depicted on the left side, were transiently transfected into the myeloblastic cell line KGla, the epithelial cell line C33A, and the Jurkat T-ALL cell line and assayed for luciferase activity. The average promoter activities were generated from at least three separate experiments for each cell line, and the standard deviation of the mean is indicated by the error bars. Luciferase activities were normalized for differences in transfection efficiency between cell lines with secreted alkaline phosphatase activity produced by the cotransfected plasmid MAPl-SEAP. Results are expressed as -fold stimulation above the normalized activity of the empty reporter plasmid pGL2basic in each cell line.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The sequence extending from bp −291 to −411 contains a c-Myb consensus DNA-binding site (YAACKG) between nucleotides −375 and −381 and three Ets consensus-binding sites (GGAW) (Fig. 3 A). As a preliminary step to the functional assessment of these sites, the ability of Myb and Ets proteins to physically bind to the consensus sites in vitro was evaluated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Whole cell lysates from COS-7 cells transfected with vector alone or the pCMV4cMyb expression plasmid were incubated with an end-labeled oligonucleotide probe containing the putative CD13/APN Myb-binding site (Fig. 4 A). Unlabeled oligonucleotides containing self-competitor (CD13Myb), the mimA Myb site from the mim-1 promoter (mimAmyb) (Fig. 3 B), or a mutant Myb site (mybmut) were added to the assays in 100-fold molar excess. The indicated protein-DNA complex was not present in the mock-transfected lysate (Fig. 4 A, lane 1) and was specifically competed by unlabeled oligonucleotide probe (lane 3) as well as by the mimAmyb oligonucleotide (lane 4), but not by the oligonucleotide containing a mutant Myb site (lane 5). To further characterize this specific protein-DNA complex, monoclonal antibodies directed against the C-terminal region of the murine c-Myb protein were added to the electrophoretic mobility shift assay binding reaction. A supershift of the specific complex was apparent with the use of the anti-Myb antibodies (lane 7), but not with isotype-matched inappropriate control antibody (lane 6), confirming the physical interaction of Myb with the CD13/APN promoter. Analogous experiments tested the physical association of the conserved Ets DNA-binding domain with the CD13/APN promoter. A bacterially expressed Ets-1 DNA-binding domain protein (GST-Ets-DBD) was incubated with an end-labeled 130-bp promoter fragment probe containing the functionally defined myeloid-specific CD13/APN regulatory sequences (Fig. 4 B). Binding of GST-Ets-DBD to the promoter fragment was inhibited with a 100-fold excess of an Ets-1 consensus oligonucleotide (ets1con), but not with a 100-fold excess of an oligonucleotide containing a mutant Ets-1 site (ets1mut). Thus, members of the Myb and Ets transcriptional protein families bind specifically to the CD13/APN promoter. Because Myb and Ets family proteins bind to the functionally relevant region of the CD13/APN promoter, and v-Myb and Ets-2 have been shown to cooperate in the regulation of the chicken promyelocyte-specific gene mim-1 (38Dudek H. Tantravahi R.V. Rao V.N. Reddy E.S. Reddy E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1291-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), Myb-Ets cooperation might also be a factor in myeloid-specific regulation of the CD13/APN gene. Indeed, in experiments with the C33A human epithelial cell line, either the truncated form of the Myb protein (pCt plasmid) or the full-length Ets-1 protein (pEBets-1 plasmid) transactivated the CD13/APN minimal promoter in a dose-dependent manner. Use of a truncated form of the Myb protein was prompted by other reports that this form is a more potent activator of transcription (38Dudek H. Tantravahi R.V. Rao V.N. Reddy E.S. Reddy E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1291-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and hence would be expected to amplify any positive results. The initial availability of Ets-1 expression constructs led to its use in the majority of the experiments in this study. Evidence for a synergistic cooperative effect by the two proteins was obtained when the pCt and pEBets-1 plasmids were cotransfected with the −411luc reporter plasmid. Reporter gene mRNA levels seen with the plasmid combination at 0.5 μg of pEBets-1 and 1.0 μg of pCt were approximately twice the sum of results obtained with the separate proteins (Fig. 5). The transactivation capacity of the Myb-Ets combination was specific for the CD13/APN promoter, as indicated by the lack of transcriptional up-regulation with four independent promoters (data not shown). If the protein generated from the Myb expression vector transactivates CD13/APN by binding to the Myb consensus site in the promoter, mutation of this site should have a profound effect on reporter gene levels. Surprisingly, alteration of this site from TAACGG to TCTCGG in the context of the wild-type promoter did not affect its transactivation by the Myb expression plasmid alone in C33A epithelial cells (Fig. 6). Moreover, comparable levels of reporter gene activity were produced by the wild-type, −291luc, and mybmutluc plasmids when Myb and Ets were added separately. Cotransfection of Myb and Ets-1 with the −291luc and mybmutluc plasmids yielded reporter gene activity that was essentially additive, in contrast to the clearly synergistic effect seen with the −411luc (wild-type) plasmid. Hence, mutation of the putative Myb consensus-binding site abolishes the Myb-Ets synergism seen with the intact promoter, despite the presence of other Myb-binding sites in the luciferase reporter plasmid. This suggests that Myb-Ets synergy depends upon features unique to the Myb consensus-binding site in the CD13/APN promoter. To confirm the importance of the Myb consensus sequence in CD13/APN transcription in a more relevant context, the mybmutluc construct was tested in both the CD13-positive myeloblastic (KG1a) and myelomonocytic leukemia (U937) cell lines as well as in the CD13-negative mature T-ALL (Jurkat) and epithelial (C33A) cell lines in comparison with the wild-type −411luc construct in each cell type. As shown in Fig. 7, mutation of the Myb-binding"

Considerable progress has been made toward a molecular description of the structures and signal transduction mechanisms of α1-adrenergic receptors (2Ruffolo Jr., R.R. Nichols A.J. Stadel J.M. Hieble J.P. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 475-505PubMed Google Scholar). The primary structure of the α1-adrenergic receptors identified by molecular cloning corresponds to the predicted topographic model of the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors, which features a motif of seven transmembrane domains (3Savarese T.M. Fraser C.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Substantial evidence indicates the importance of agonist and G protein-regulated phospholipase C to generate phosphoinositide-derived second messengers for Ca2+signaling in response to α1-adrenergic receptor activation (2Ruffolo Jr., R.R.

Despite these important advances, significant gaps remain in our understanding of α1receptor signaling. One area of key interest concerns the disposition of the receptor in the cell membrane, and the influence of agonist on receptor distribution, responsiveness, and metabolism. Desensitization of α1AR responses by agonist has been reported although the kinetics of these processes vary among different systems (14Lurie K.G. Tsujimoto G. Hoffman B.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Attempts to study α1receptor distribution at the subcellular level have been limited by the lack of specific structural probes of the receptor. In other systems, immunological approaches have provided powerful tools for studying receptor localization and organization at the cellular level, as well as revealing important insights into the mechanisms of receptor regulation (22Bahough S.W.

In the present study we have developed a novel anti-peptide antibody directed against a unique decapeptide sequence corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of the α1B-adrenergic receptor. The antibody specifically recognizes the receptor on immunoblots and in situ in human embryonal kidney 293 (HEK 293) cells transfected and selected for stable expression of the cDNA for the α1Breceptor (HEK293/α1B). Using this experimental system we have combined immunocytochemical localization of the receptor with functional measurements of [3H]inositol phosphate production to examine the mechanisms of agonist-induced receptor redistribution and modulation of receptor responsiveness. The results provide evidence for a cyclic mechanism of receptor activation, desensitization, internalization, and recovery upon agonist stimulation.

Additional reagents and supplies were obtained from conventional sources and were the highest purity available. A peptide with the sequence (C)-SNMPLAPGHF corresponding to residues 506-515 at the carboxyl terminus of the hamster α1B-adrenergic receptor (9Cotecchia S. Schwinn D.A. Randall R.R. Lefkowitz R.J.

Purity was higher than 90% as assessed by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. Identity of the peptide was confirmed by mass spectroscopy. The peptide was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin with m-maleimidobenzoyl- N-hydroxysuccinimide through the terminal cysteine residue by Multiple Peptide Systems and rabbit immunizations (two rabbits with boosts at 2-week intervals) were performed by Bethyl Laboratories (Montgomery, TX). Antisera were screened by standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay procedures (26Harlow E. Lane D.P. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) against immobilized peptides, and gave titers up to 1:10,000. [3H]Phenoxybenzamine Labeling and Partial Purification of α1-Adrenergic Receptors-Reaction of α1-adrenergic receptors with [3H]phenoxybenzamine was performed essentially as described previously (27Reece J.F. Brown R.D. Cain C. Amitai G. Segall Y. Taylor P. Abraham S. Amitai G. Calcium Channel Modulators in Heart and Smooth Muscle. VCH, Weinheim, FRG1990: 125-138Google Scholar). Briefly, DDT1 MF-2 cells (0.5 × 106 cells/ml, 3 × 109 cells/preparation) were harvested, washed, and resuspended in 1% of the original volume of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 140 m M NaCl, 5 m M KCl, 10 m M NaPO4, pH 7.4). [3H]Phenoxybenzamine (70-100 n M) was added for 60 min at 30°C with gentle agitation. The reaction was quenched by adding 0.1%β-mercaptoethanol and incubating an additional 30 min. Cells were diluted with 2-3 volumes of PBS, washed by centrifugation, resuspended in one-tenth volume of PBS, and sonicated on ice for 2 min. Membranes were collected by centrifugation (20,000 × g, 60 min, 4°C). Solubilization of membranes with digitonin and wheat germ agglutinin chromatography of [3H]phenoxybenzamine-labeled receptor were performed as described previously (28Terman B.I. Reece J.F. Brown R.D. Insel P.A. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Receptor samples were desalted on Sephadex G-75 columns equilibrated with 50 m M NH4-HCO3, concentrated, and stored at -70°C for use in immunoblotting or autoradiography protocols. Proteins were resolved by electrophoresis through 10% SDS-PAGE minigels and electrotransferred overnight (300 mA) to nitrocellulose in transfer buffer composed of 0.7 M glycine, 25 m M Tris-HCl, pH 7.7 (29Small G.M. Imanaka T. Lazarow P.B. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 169: 405-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Immunoblots were processed according to the manufacturer's procedure (Bio-Rad). Briefly, nitrocellulose strips corresponding to individual lanes from the gel were cut and incubated in blocking buffer (500 m M NaCl, 20 m M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) containing 3% gelatin for 1 h, followed by anti-peptide antisera (1:500-1:1000 dilution) in blocking buffer containing 1% gelatin and 0.05% Tween 20 for 2 h. The strips were washed with blocking buffer and incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase as specified by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad). Immunoblots were developed with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoylphosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium. In some experiments, parallel immunoblotting and autoradiography were performed on [3H]phenoxybenzamine-labeled α1receptor preparations. In this case replicate nitrocellulose strips from the electrotransfer procedure either were immunoblotted as described above, or were subjected to autoradiography by exposure with Kodak X-Omat film with intensifying screens for 2 weeks at −70°C. HEK 293 cells stably expressing α1Breceptor were subcultured in 35-mm dishes containing poly- D-lysine-coated coverslips. At subconfluence (2-4 days), cells were processed for immunostaining. Treatments of cultures with experimental agents were performed in growth medium for the indicated times before processing. Treatment with norepinephrine (NE) was always accompanied with propranolol (1 μM) to prevent activation of endogenous β-adrenergic receptors, and with catalase (10 μg/ml) and superoxide dismutase (10 μg/ml) to prevent catecholamine oxidation. Cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. Fixed specimens were blocked for 2 h at room temperature with PBS containing 10% normal goat serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.05-0.1% Triton. For single antibody labeling, specimens were incubated with receptor antibody (1:500-1:1000 dilutions in blocking solution) at 4°C overnight, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson) at a dilution of 1:400 in the blocking buffer (1 h incubation at room temperature). In double immunofluorescence labeling experiments, mouse monoclonal anti-transferrin antibody (1:100 dilution) was incubated with the fixed cells for 3 h at room temperature followed by addition of anti-receptor antibody and overnight incubation with both antibodies at 4°C. Respective antibody labelings were visualized with Lissamine rhodamine-goat anti-mouse and fluorescein isothiocyanate-goat anti-rabbit IgGs. Coverslips were mounted in Slow Fade mounting solution (Molecular Probes). Immunofluorescence staining was examined by conventional inverted fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss or Nikon) or by confocal fluorescence microscopy with 1-μm optical sections. Confocal fluorescence microscopy was performed at the Electron Microscopy and Imaging Facility, Northwestern University School of Medicine, Chicago. A 2.1-kilobase EcoRI fragment containing the coding sequence of the hamster α1B-adrenergic receptor (pBC12BI/α1B, kindly provided by Dr. Robert J. Lefkowitz, Duke University Medical School) was subcloned into pBluescript SK(+) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The pBluescript/α1Bplasmid was used as the source of a 2.1-kilobase HindIII- XbaI fragment that was inserted at the HindIII and XbaI sites of the eukaryotic expression vector pRc/CMV (Invitrogen). The construct, pCMV/α1B, is capable of high levels of receptor expression in mammalian cells. pCMV/α1Bwas used to transfect cultures of HEK 293 cells (adenovirus-transformed human embryonal kidney cells, Ref. 30Grahan F.L. Smiley J. Russel W.C. Nairn R. J. Gen. Virol. 1977; 36: 59-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (3479) Google Scholar), seeded at 1-2 × 106cells/10-cm dish by the calcium phosphate-mediated gene transfer method of Chen and Okayama (31Chen C.A. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). One day following exposure of cells to the DNA precipitate, cultures were re-plated at a 5-10-fold lower density in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 400 μg/ml G418. Cultures were maintained in selection medium for 2-4 weeks with fresh medium changes twice per week. Resistant colonies were pooled and stock cultures of pooled transfectants stably expressing α1Breceptors (10-20 pmol/mg membrane protein by Scatchard analysis) were propagated in growth medium containing G-418. Measurement of Agonist-elicited [3H]Inositol Phosphate Production-Protocols for equilibration of HEK 293 cell cultures with [3H]inositol, experimental exposure to agonist, and analysis of [3H]inositol phosphate production were performed essentially as described previously (32Ambler S.K. Brown R.D. Taylor P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1984; 26: 405-413PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cultures equilibrated 24-48 h with [3H]inositol (2-5 μCi/ml) were exposed to physiological salt solution supplemented with LiCl (Li-PSS, composition in millimolar: NaCl, 130; LiCl, 10; KCl, 5.4; CaCl2, 1.8; MgCl2, 1.6; Na2HPO4, 1.0; D-glucose, 5.5; HEPES, 10; pH 7.4) and specified agonist additions for indicated times at 37°C. Addition of the α-adrenergic agonist norepinephrine was routinely accompanied by 1 μM propranolol and 10 μg/ml each of superoxide dismutase and catalase. Reactions were terminated with ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. Samples were extracted with ethyl ether, neutralized, and fractionated by anion exchange chromatography (Dowex 1×8-formate). The columns were eluted with water to remove [3H]inositol and then total [3H]inositol phosphates were collected by eluting with 1.2 M ammonium formate in 0.1 M formic acid according to published procedures (32Ambler S.K. Brown R.D. Taylor P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1984; 26: 405-413PubMed Google Scholar). Culture of DDT1MF-2 (28Terman B.I. Reece J.F. Brown R.D. Insel P.A. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and HEK 293 (24von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol.

Virol. 1977; 36: 59-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (3479) Google Scholar) cell lines were performed as described previously. Receptor density was assessed by [3H]prazosin binding to intact cells or membrane preparations by established procedures (16Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. Cotecchia S. De Blasi A. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3098-3105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein determinations were performed by Bradford (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar) or bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Anti-peptide antibodies were prepared in rabbits against a unique amino acid sequence (amino acids 506-515) that corresponds to the cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus of the cloned hamster α1B-adrenergic receptor. The antiserum reacted with high specificity and sensitivity to the cognate peptide by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (data not shown). Specific immunoreactivity of this antibody toward the receptor polypeptide was tested on immunoblots by two approaches, as shown in Fig. 1. First, α1Breceptors from DDT1MF-2 cells were covalently radiolabeled with [3H]phenoxybenzamine, solubilized with digitonin, and partially purified by wheat germ agglutinin chromatography (27Reece J.F. Brown R.D. Cain C. Amitai G. Segall Y. Taylor P. Abraham S. Amitai G. Calcium Channel Modulators in Heart and Smooth Muscle. VCH, Weinheim, FRG1990: 125-138Google Scholar). Replicate samples of this preparation were subjected to SDS-PAGE and examined by autoradiography to visualize the radiolabeled receptor, or by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 1 A, Lane 1, [3H]phenoxybenzamine labeled polypeptides of approximate molecular mass = 80 kDa. The antiserum immunoreacted with a band that co-migrated with the radiolabeled polypeptide (Fig. 1 A, Lane 2). Previous studies have identified this 80-kDa peptide as the α1-adrenergic receptor. Labeling was specifically blocked by the α1-adrenergic antagonist prazosin (Ref. 27Reece J.F. Brown R.D. Cain C. Amitai G. Segall Y. Taylor P. Abraham S. Amitai G. Calcium Channel Modulators in Heart and Smooth Muscle. VCH, Weinheim, FRG1990: 125-138Google Scholar, and confirmed in these experiments, data not shown). The diffuse labeling pattern arises from the glycosylation of the receptor protein (28Terman B.I. Reece J.F. Brown R.D. Insel P.A. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Specific immunoreactivity of the antiserum was further demonstrated by immunoblotting against crude membrane fractions prepared from HEK 293 cells transfected to stably express the α1Breceptor. The antibody reacted with polypeptides of approximate molecular mass = 80 kDa present in membrane extracts from transfected cells (Fig. 1 B, Lane 2), but absent in membranes from untransfected cells (Fig. 1 B, Lane 1). Furthermore, the immunoreactivity of antibody 506-515 was completely abolished by prior absorption with its corresponding peptide (data not shown). The capability of the antibodies to recognize the receptor in situ was tested by immunofluorescence staining of pooled populations of HEK 293 cells selected for stable α1BAR expression. The pattern of immunostaining obtained with this antibody appears diffusely and uniformly distributed over the cell surface (Fig. 2 A). Specificity of the immunostaining was demonstrated by the following criteria (data not shown). First, preabsorption of the antiserum with the corresponding peptide abolished the specific staining. Second, no positive immunofluorescence was observed when the anti-peptide antiserum was substituted with preimmune serum. Third, no immunofluorescence was observed in untransfected HEK 293 cells. Furthermore, no immunostaining was observed if the cells were not first permeabilized with detergent allowing access of the antibody to the cell interior. This latter result is consistent with the proposed cytoplasmic location of the peptide epitope recognized by the antibody. These antibodies were used to study the influence of agonist exposure on α1Breceptor distribution. As shown in Fig. 2 B, exposure of HEK 293/α1Bcells for 3 h to experimental growth medium containing 10 μM norepinephrine produced a striking redistribution of the staining pattern of the receptor and the appearance of highly non-uniform aggregates of intense immunostaining. The α1receptor antagonist prazosin (1 μM) blocked agonist-induced redistribution of immunostaining (Fig. 2 C), confirming that the redistribution was specifically mediated by agonist occupancy of the receptor. The kinetics of agonist-induced redistribution are indicated in Fig. 3. Redistribution was evident within 5 min of agonist exposure, the earliest interval examined, essentially complete by 15 min, and sustained during agonist exposure intervals up to 24 h. The agonist-induced redistribution was reversible. Exposure of cells to norepinephrine for 1 h followed by removal of agonist and addition of fresh growth medium containing prazosin restored the original diffuse pattern of immunostaining within 15-30 min (Fig. 4). Similar reversal of receptor redistribution was observed upon removal of agonist from cultures treated with norepinephrine for 24 h (data not shown). In order to visualize receptor localization at higher spatial resolution, the staining of control and agonist-treated cells was examined by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. Scanning of sequential optical sections (1-μm thickness) of individual cells was performed. Fig. 5 shows representative control and agonist-treated images obtained at comparable focal planes relative to the attachment surface. Control cells (Fig. 5 A) displayed immunostaining on the cell periphery, consistent with localization of the receptor at the cell surface. NE-treated cells (Fig. 5 B) showed non-uniform and bright patches of immunofluorescence localized internally throughout the cytoplasm; some aggregates also appeared to be associated with the cell surface. These images clearly demonstrate that the α-adrenergic agonist elicits a profound redistribution of receptor within these cells, and they strongly suggest that a significant fraction of receptors translocate from the cell surface to an intracellular location. Internalization of many receptors and integral membrane proteins occurs by endocytosis to a common endosomal compartment from which further intracellular sorting or recycling to the cell surface proceeds (34Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). To determine whether α1Breceptor trafficking occurs by a similar pathway we performed immunofluorescence colocalization of the internalized receptors with transferrin receptor, a classic endosomal marker. Each antigen was labeled with its corresponding primary antibody and visualized with fluorescein isothiocyanate-(α1B) or Lissamine rhodamine-(transferrin) conjugated secondary antibodies, respectively. Confocal images obtained from control cells showed that α1Breceptor is mainly localized to the cell surface while transferrin receptors reside in internal vesicles (Fig. 6, A and B). After 1 h NE exposure, the internalized α1Breceptor colocalizes with transferrin receptor in endosomes (Fig. 6, C and D). This result indicates that α1Breceptor translocates to endosomes during agonist exposure. In addition, agonist-induced receptor internalization was completely prevented by pretreatment of cells with hyperosmotic sucrose solutions (0.45 M), a procedure which has been shown previously to inhibit receptor-mediated endocytosis (Ref. 35Daukas G. Zigmond S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1673-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, data not shown). In sum, these results are consistent with an endocytic pathway of α1Breceptor internalization. Recent studies suggest that protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation may regulate α1Breceptor internalization (36Zhu S.J. Toews M.L. Soc. Neurosci. 1993; 19 (abstr.): 500Google Scholar). Using immunocytochemical procedures we tested the involvement of protein kinase C in agonist-induced receptor internalization. The characteristic receptor internalization induced by norepinephrine is shown in F"
https://openalex.org/W1574477586,"The role of the sequence-specific pentasaccharide region of high affinity heparin (HAH) in heparin acceleration of antithrombin-proteinase reactions was elucidated by determining the accelerating mechanism of low affinity heparin (LAH) lacking this sequence. LAH was shown to be free of HAH (<0.001%) from the lack of exchange of added fluorescein-labeled HAH into LAH after separating the polysaccharides by antithrombin-agarose chromatography. Fluorescence titrations showed that LAH bound to antithrombin with a 1000-fold weaker affinity (KD19 ± 6 μM) and 5-6-fold smaller fluorescence enhancement (8 ± 3%) than HAH. LAH accelerated the antithrombin-thrombin reaction with a bell-shaped dependence on heparin concentration resembling that of HAH, but with the bell-shaped curve shifted to ~100-fold higher polysaccharide concentrations and with a ~100-fold reduced maximal accelerating effect. Rapid kinetic studies indicated these differences arose from a reverse order of assembly of an intermediate heparin-thrombin-antithrombin ternary complex and diminished ability of LAH to bridge antithrombin and thrombin in this complex, as compared to HAH. By contrast, LAH and HAH both accelerated the antithrombin-factor Xa reaction with a simple saturable dependence on heparin or inhibitor concentrations which paralleled the formation of an antithrombin-heparin binary complex. The maximal accelerations of the two heparins in this case correlated with the inhibitor fluorescence enhancements induced by the polysaccharides, consistent with the accelerations arising from conformational activation of antithrombin. 1H NMR difference spectroscopy of antithrombin complexes with LAH and HAH and competitive binding studies were consistent with LAH accelerating activity being mediated by binding to the same site on the inhibitor as HAH. These results demonstrate that LAH accelerates antithrombin-proteinase reactions by bridging and conformational activation mechanisms similar to those of HAH, with the reduced magnitude of LAH accelerations resulting both from a decreased antithrombin affinity and the inability to induce a full activating conformational change in the inhibitor.

Heparin is a naturally occurring glycosaminoglycan which acts as a potent antagonist of blood coagulation. This anticoagulant effect of heparin is primarily due to the polysaccharide accelerating the inactivation of blood clotting proteinases by their principal protein inhibitor, antithrombin, several thousandfold (for reviews, see Refs. 1Olson S.T.

Des. 1994; 1: 479-501Google Scholar) The accelerating activity results from a sequence-specific pentasaccharide region, present in about one-third of heparin polysaccharide chains (3Thunberg L.

Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Google Scholar). This conformational change appears to be primarily responsible for heparin acceleration when factor Xa is the target proteinase since the synthesized heparin pentasaccharide region is nearly as active as a full-length heparin containing this sequence in accelerating the inactivation of factor Xa by antithrombin (11Olson S.T. Björk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Google Scholar, 12Lane D.A. Denton J. Flynn A.M. Thunberg L. Lindahl U. Biochem.

However, the conformational change does not appear to be critical for heparin acceleration when thrombin is the target proteinase, since the pentasaccharide has negligible ability to accelerate the inactivation of this enzyme by antithrombin (11Olson S.T. Björk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Google Scholar). Instead, heparin rate enhancement of thrombin inhibition appears to be mostly due to the polysaccharide bridging antithrombin and thrombin in a ternary complex in which both the inhibitor and proteinase are bound to the same polysaccharide chain (12Lane D.A.

Whereas heparin molecules containing the pentasaccharide binding sequence for antithrombin (high affinity heparin) account for the bulk of the anticoagulant activity of heparin preparations, heparin molecules lacking this sequence (low affinity heparin) nevertheless exhibit an anticoagulant effect of 5-10% that of high affinity heparin molecules. Low affinity heparin has been shown to bind antithrombin with about a 1000-fold weaker affinity than the high affinity polysaccharide and appears to induce a conformational change in the inhibitor, although one that is different in kind or extent (6Nordenman B. Danielsson Å. Björk I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 90: 1-6Google Scholar, 7Nordenman B. Björk I. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3339-3344Google Scholar, 22Jordan R. Beeler D. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2902-2913Google Scholar, 23Gettins P.G.W. Fan B. Crews B.C. Turko I.V. Olson S.T. Streusand V.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8385-8389Google Scholar). Low affinity heparin chains also can accelerate antithrombin-proteinase reactions, but the magnitude of these accelerations are relatively small and proteinase-dependent (24Nordenman B. Nordling K. Björk I. Thromb. Res. 1980; 17: 595-600Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the observed binding of low affinity heparin to antithrombin and accelerating effect of the polysaccharide on antithrombin-proteinase reactions may be accounted for by contaminating high affinity heparin in the low affinity heparin preparations studied (22Jordan R. Beeler D. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2902-2913Google Scholar). The purpose of the present study was to determine whether low affinity heparin possesses an intrinsic ability to accelerate antithrombin-proteinase reactions, to establish the mechanism of such an accelerating effect, and thereby to elucidate the role of the antithrombin-binding pentasaccharide in the heparin accelerating mechanism. A further goal was to evaluate whether pentasaccharide activation of antithrombin can potentiate the low affinity heparin acceleration of the antithrombin-thrombin reaction to an extent that duplicates the high affinity heparin acceleration, as has been proposed (25Evans D.L. Marshall C.J. Christey P.B. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12629-12642Google Scholar). The results of our studies provide convincing evidence for an intrinsic accelerating activity of low affinity heparin on antithrombin-proteinase reactions and demonstrate a mechanism for this accelerating effect which resembles that of high affinity heparin. The reduced accelerating activity of the low affinity polysaccharide is further shown to be fully explained by the reduced affinity of the polysaccharide for antithrombin and its inability to induce a full activating conformational change in the inhibitor. Finally, our studies show that pentasaccharide binding to antithrombin diminishes rather than enhances the low affinity heparin acceleration of the antithrombin-thrombin reaction, in keeping with a predominant bridging mechanism of heparin rate enhancement of this reaction and a minimal role of the antithrombin conformational change in the rate enhancement. These findings suggest that nonspecific antithrombin binding sequences may contribute to the anticoagulant effects of clinically administered heparin or of endogenous heparin or heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans involved in maintaining normal hemostasis. Antithrombin was purified from outdated human plasma by heparin-agarose, DEAE-Sepharose and Sephacryl S-200 chromatography as described previously (19Olson S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1698-1708Google Scholar, 26Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Google Scholar). Human α-thrombin was a generous gift of Dr. John Fenton, New York State Department of Health, Albany, NY. Human α-factor Xa was prepared by activation of purified factor X followed by chromatography on soybean trypsin inhibitor-agarose as described elsewhere (27Bock P.E. Craig P.A. Olson S.T. Singh P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 273: 375-388Google Scholar) and, in part, generously provided by Dr. Paul Bock of Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN. All proteins were judged pure by SDS-gel electrophoresis. Antithrombin concentrations were determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 37,700 M-1·cm-1(28Nordenman B. Nyström C. Björk I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 78: 195-203Google Scholar). Proteinase concentrations were determined by active-site titration as described previously (11Olson S.T. Björk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Google Scholar) which indicated >70% active enzyme preparations. Low affinity heparin was isolated from purified, size-fractionated heparin with a molecular weight of 7900 ± 10% by repeated antithrombin-agarose affinity chromatography as previously described (19Olson S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1698-1708Google Scholar). The anti-factor Xa activity was measured after each affinity-purification step from the increase produced by 0.8 μM polysaccharide on the pseudo first-order rate constant for the inactivation of 20 n M factor Xa by 200 n M antithrombin. After three such steps, the anti-factor Xa activity was reduced to 0.08 ± 0.01% of the activity of high affinity heparin with no further reduction observed after a fourth step. The resulting anticoagulant activity of the low affinity heparin measured from the prolongation of the plasma clotting time (29Griffin J.H. Cochrane C.G. Methods Enzymol. 1976; 45: 56-65Google Scholar) was 1 ± 0.2% that of high affinity heparin. 1The dependence of heparin anticoagulant activity measured by clotting assay on polysaccharide molecular weight may partially account for the lower anticoagulant activity of our 7900 molecular weight low affinity heparin as compared to that reported for higher molecular weight preparations of the low affinity polysaccharide (6, 22, 44). High affinity heparin was a preparation previously described, having the same molecular weight as the low affinity polysaccharide (11Olson S.T. Björk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Google Scholar). For NMR difference spectra, low affinity and high affinity heparins with a molecular weight of ~10,000 and with anti-factor Xa activities comparable to the 7900 Mrheparins were employed. The α-methyl glycoside of the pentasaccharide corresponding to the antithrombin binding sequence in heparin was synthesized as described elsewhere (30Petitou M. Duchaussoy P. Lederman I. Choay J. Jacquinet J.C. Sina P. Torri G. Carbohydr. Res. 1987; 167: 67-75Google Scholar). Dextran sulfate with an average molecular weight of 8000 was from Sigma. Fluorescein-labeled high affinity heparin was prepared by reacting intrinsic free amino groups in the 7900 Mrhigh affinity polysaccharide with fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate (Molecular Probes) and purifying the labeled from the unlabeled polysaccharide by hydrophobic chromatography on octyl-Sepharose, as previously described (31Nagasawa K. Uchiyama H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 544: 430-440Google Scholar, 32Uchiyama H. Nagasawa K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1981; 89: 185-192Google Scholar). The labeled polysaccharide was further purified by antithrombin-agarose affinity chromatography. A labeling ratio of 0.90 ± 0.02 mol of fluorescein/mol of heparin was determined by analysis for heparin by an Azure A dye binding assay (33Jacques L.B. Methods Biochem. Anal. 1977; 24: 203-212Google Scholar) and for fluorescein from the absorbance at 493 nm at pH 8.3 using an extinction coefficient of 68,000 M-1cm-1. The latter value was determined for fluorescein isothiocyanate reacted with a 200-fold molar excess of ethanolamine under the same conditions. Titrations of antithrombin with the labeled heparin monitored by protein fluorescence changes (see below) indicated a binding stoichiometry and affinity similar to that of unlabeled high affinity heparin. A mixture of 3 mg of low affinity heparin and 0.03 mg of fluorescein-labeled high affinity heparin or 0.03 mg of labeled high affinity heparin alone in 3.3 ml of equilibration buffer was applied to an antithrombin-agarose affinity column (30 mg of antithrombin coupled to 10 ml of Affi-gel 15 from Bio-Rad; capacity, ~2 mg of high affinity heparin) equilibrated in 20 m M sodium phosphate, 0.25 M NaCl, 0.1 m M EDTA, pH 7.4. Following elution of low affinity heparin with the equilibration buffer, high affinity heparin was eluted by increasing the NaCl concentration in the buffer to 3 M. Fractions (1.8 ml) were assayed for total heparin by the Azure A dye binding method and for labeled heparin by fluorescence detection at λex495 nm (excitation), λem515 nm (emission). All experiments were conducted at 25°C in an ionic strength (I) 0.15, pH 7.4 buffer consisting of 20 m M sodium phosphate, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.1 m M EDTA, 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000 except where otherwise noted. Binding of low affinity and high affinity heparins and heparin pentasaccharide to antithrombin was analyzed by fluorescence titrations in which the enhancement in protein tryptophan fluorescence accompanying polysaccharide binding was used to monitor the interaction (6Nordenman B. Danielsson Å. Björk I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 90: 1-6Google Scholar, 9Olson S.T. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11065-11072Google Scholar, 22Jordan R. Beeler D. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2902-2913Google Scholar). High affinity heparin titrations were done with 10 n M antithrombin, whereas low affinity heparin titrations employed either 1 or 10 μM inhibitor. Measurements were made on an SLM 8000 spectrofluorometer with fluorescence detection at λex280 and λem340 nm except for low affinity heparin titrations of 10 μM antithrombin, in which λexwas set at 295 nm to avoid inner filter corrections. Because the stoichiometry for low affinity heparin binding to antithrombin was indeterminate under the conditions of measurement, the 1:1 binding stoichiometry determined for high affinity heparin binding was assumed for low affinity heparin binding. Corrections for background fluorescence of the titrant were required for low affinity heparin (maximally ~10% for titrations of 1 μM antithrombin and <1% for titrations of 10 μM inhibitor) and made by subtracting the signal observed in parallel titrations of polysaccharide into buffer. Titrations were analyzed by computer fitting to the quadratic binding equation (26Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Google Scholar). 1H NMR spectra of antithrombin and antithrombin-heparin complexes were recorded at 500 MHz on a Bruker AMX500 spectrometer. Difference spectra were generated by computer subtraction as described previously (10Gettins P. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1391-1398Google Scholar). The kinetics of low affinity heparin acceleration of antithrombin-proteinase reactions were measured under pseudo first-order conditions. In one set of experiments, 20 n M antithrombin was reacted with 1 n M thrombin or with 2 n M factor Xa at increasing concentrations of heparin or dextran sulfate. In some experiments, 0.5 or 1 μM heparin pentasaccharide was also present. Reaction mixtures of 50 μl were incubated for increasing times in polyethylene glycol-coated polystyrene cuvettes (34Latallo Z.S. Hall J.A. Thromb. Res. 1986; 43: 507-521Google Scholar) and then quenched with 1 ml of 50 μM tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-7-amido-4-methyl coumarin (Sigma) in the case of the thrombin reaction or with 1 ml 100 or 200 μM Spectrozyme FXa (American Diagnostica) in the case of the factor Xa reaction. Both substrates were in a high salt buffer consisting of 20 m M sodium phosphate, 1.0 M NaCl, 1 m M EDTA, 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000, pH 7.4, plus 0.1 mg/ml Polybrene (Aldrich) (except for dextran sulfate reactions where Polybrene was absent) to quench the reaction. The residual enzyme activity was then determined from the initial linear rate of substrate hydrolysis monitored by the increase in fluorescence of 7-amido-4-methyl coumarin at λex380 nm and λem440 nm or by the increase in p-nitroaniline absorbance at 405 nm. p-Aminobenzamidine (2 m M) was included in the high affinity heparin-catalyzed antithrombin-thrombin reaction to reduce the reaction rate sufficiently for analysis by the discontinuous sampling method. Observed pseudo first-order rate constants (kops) were obtained from the slope of semilog plots of the decrease in enzymatic activity with time or by computer fitting the decay of enzyme activity by an exponential function (26Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Google Scholar). A second set of rapid kinetic experiments were monitored from the decrease in fluorescence accompanying the displacement of the probe, p-aminobenzamidine, from the proteinase by the inhibitor, as in previous studies (15Olson S.T. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14891-14895Google Scholar, 35Craig P.A. Olson S.T. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5452-5461Google Scholar). Antithrombin-thrombin reactions employed 0.25 μM thrombin, 70 μM p-aminobenzamidine, and variable antithrombin and heparin concentrations. Antithrombin-factor Xa reactions were done with 0.5 μM factor Xa, 85 μM p-aminobenzamidine, and either with 10 μM inhibitor and variable heparin or 10 μM heparin and variable inhibitor concentrations. Fluorescence changes were followed in an SLM 8000 spectrofluorometer equipped with a Milli-flow stopped-flow attachment with wavelengths set at λex340 nm and λem370 nm and with excitation and emission slits of 2 nm and 32 nm, respectively. Observed rate constants were obtained by fitting fluorescence decay curves from four to five averaged reaction traces by a single exponential function. The dependence of kopson polysaccharide concentration determined from studies at low antithrombin concentrations (20 n M) was computer fit by equations previously shown to describe the two different mechanisms of polysaccharide acceleration of antithrombin-proteinase reactions, i.e. either by a mechanism requiring antithrombin and proteinase to bind to the same heparin chain or one requiring just antithrombin to bind heparin (11Olson S.T. Björk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Google Scholar, 19Olson S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1698-1708Google Scholar, 20Olson S.T. Björk I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6353-6364Google Scholar). For the former mechanism, which describes the heparin-catalyzed antithrombin-thrombin reaction, the equation for kopsis given by 2The abbreviations used are: ATantithrombinTthrombinHheparinPp-aminobenzamidine. kobs=kT[AT]f+kH,T[AT·H]×kT,HKT,H+[H]f+kH,T''[AT·H]×[H]fKT,H+[H]fkT[AT]f+kH,T[AT·H]f×[H]fKT,H+[H]f+kH,T''[AT·H]×[H]fKT,H+[H]f(Eq.1)where=[AT]o+[H]o+KAT,H-([AT]o+[H]o+KAT,H)2-4[AT]o[H]o2=f[AT]o-[AT.H]=f[H]o-[AT.H](Eq. 1) [AT]o and [H]o are total antithrombin and heparin concentrations, KT,H and KAT,H are dissociation constants for thrombin-heparin and antithrombin-heparin interactions, respectively, and kT, kH,T kH,T, and kH,T represent second-order rate constants for the reactions of antithrombin with thrombin, of antithrombin-heparin binary complex with thrombin, of thrombin-heparin binary complex with antithrombin, and of antithrombin-heparin binary complex with thrombin-heparin binary complex, respectively, In these and the subsequent equations, the symbol, H, also refers to the model heparin-like polysaccharide, dextran sulfate. antithrombin thrombin heparin p-aminobenzamidine. For the heparin-catalyzed antithrombin-factor Xa reaction, the dependence of kobs on heparin concentration was fit by a mechanism requiring heparin binding to just antithrombin. This dependence is given by the equation (11), kobs=kXa[AT]f+kH,Xa[AT.H](Eq. 2) where [AT]f and [AT·H] are as given above and kXa and kH,Xa are second-order rate constants for the reaction of antithrombin with factor Xa and of antithrombin-heparin binary complex with factor Xa, respectively. The dependence of kobs on heparin and antithrombin concentrations in rapid-kinetic studies of the heparin-catalyzed antithrombinthrombin reaction by the p-aminobenzamidine displacement method was fit by the following previously derived equation (19): kobs-kT[AT]f1+[P]o/KP+kH,I[AT]fKAT,TH(1+[P]o/KP)(1+KT,H/[H]f+[AT]f(Eq.3)(Eq. 3) where [P]o is the total p-aminobenzamidine concentration, Kp , the dissociation constant for the p-aminobenzamidine-thrombin interaction, kH,I, the first-order rate constant for irreversible conversion of the heparin-thrombin-antithrombin ternary encounter complex to a stable thrombin-antithrombin complex, KAT,TH, the dissociation constant for interaction of thrombin-heparin binary complex with free antithrombin to form ternary complex, and kT and KT,H are as given above. This equation neglects the reaction between antithrombin-heparin and thrombin-heparin binary complexes due to its negligible contribution in the range of heparin concentrations employed. It should be noted that the second-order rate constant, k'H,T, governing the reaction of antithrombin and thrombin via the ternary complex pathway given above is equal to the ratio, kH,I/KAT,TH. The dependence of kobs on inhibitor and polysaccharide concerrtrations measured in rapid-kinetic studies of the heparin-catalyzed antithrombin-factor Xa reaction were fit by Equation 2 for the factor Xa reaction given above, except that second-order rate constants for heparin-catalyzed and uncatalyzed reactions were divided by the factor, 1 + [P]o/Kp, to account for the competitive effect of p-aminobenzamidine on the reaction kinetics. Previously measured values for Kp of 64 μM for the thrombin-probe interaction (20Olson S.T. Björk I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6353-6364Google Scholar) and 80 μM for the factor Xa-probe interaction (35Craig P.A. Olson S.T. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5452-5461Google Scholar) were used in fitting data. In fitting kinetic data by the above equations, second-order rate constants for uncatalyzed antithrombin-proteinase reactions were fixed at previously measured values for kTand kXagiven in Table I. Similarly, kH, T“was fixed at the value determined for the uncatalyzed reaction, since this parameter was poorly determined and indistinguishable from the uncatalyzed rate constant. Reported errors represent ± 2 S.E.Table I:Second-order rate constants (k) for polysaccharide-accelerated antithrombin-proteinase reactions Open table in a new tab Heparin with low antithrombin affinity was purified by repeated antithrombin-agarose affinity chromatography to a constant specific anti-factor Xa activity (see “Materials and Methods”) equal to ~0.1% that of high affinity heparin. To determine whether this activity was an intrinsic property of low affinity heparin or was due to small amounts of residual high affinity heparin, 30 μg of fluorescein-labeled high affinity heparin were added to 3 mg of low affinity heparin, and the exchange of labeled polysaccharide into unlabeled polysaccharide was measured after separating the polysaccharide mixture by antithrombin affinity chromatography. Fluorescein high affinity heparin was quantitatively separated from the low affinity polysaccharide by this procedure, as indicated by the appearance of 99% of the applied fluorescence in the high affinity polysaccharide fraction (Fig. 1). The residual ~1% fluorescence, corresponding to ~0.3 μg of labeled heparin which coeluted with low affinity heparin was also found in control experiments in which just the labeled high affinity polysaccharide was chromatographed (Fig. 1). Subsequent G-25 chromatography of this nonbinding fluorescent fraction revealed it to be free fluorescein (>90%) that had hydrolyzed from the labeled polysaccharide during the experiment. This indicated the presence of <0.03 μg or <0.001% high affinity heparin in the low affinity polysaccharide. 3It is predicted that 3 μg of high affinity heparin is present in 3 mg of low affinity heparin if the former accounts for the observed anti-factor Xa activity of the latter. Addition of 30 μg of fluorescent-labeled high affinity heparin should thus result in the exchange of (30/33) × 3 or 2.7 μg of labeled high affinity heparin into the low affinity heparin, assuming the affinity separation procedure results in 0.1% residual high affinity heparin in the low affinity heparin. The levels of high affinity heparin predicted to be present in low affinity heparin in the above experiment assumed that the anti-factor Xa activity of high affinity heparin would not be affected by the low affinity polysaccharide. This assumption was confirmed by the finding that addition of 0.2% high affinity heparin to low affinity heparin increased the anti-factor Xa activity of the latter to an extent equal to that of the high affinity polysaccharide alone. Together, these observations suggested that the activity of low affinity heparin was not due to contaminating high affinity heparin. To characterize the mechanism by which low affinity heparin accelerates antithrombin-proteinase reactions, binding of the polysaccharide to antithrombin was quantified by monitoring the protein fluorescence enhancement previously shown to accompany such binding. Titrations of antithrombin with low affinity heparin resulted in a saturable 8 ± 3% enhancement in protein fluorescence and an average dissociation constant (from four titrations) of 19 ± 6 μM (Fig. 2), in agreement with previous studies (6Nordenman B. Danielsson Å. Björk I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 90: 1-6Google Scholar, 7Nordenman B. Björk I. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3339-3344Google Scholar, 22Jordan R. Beeler D. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2902-2913Google Scholar). Similar titrations of antithrombin with high affinity heparin gave a 47 ± 7% fluorescence enhancement and a KDof 19 ± 3 n M (average from four titrations); i.e. 1"

The Na+/Ca2+exchanger was isolated from 32P-labeled cells by immunoprecipitation with a specific polyclonal antibody.

Iwamoto T. Hanada H. Imagawa T. Shigekawa M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 114: 528-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 6Kofuji P. Lederer W.J. Schulze D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5145-5149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, a new Na+/Ca2+exchanger isoform (NCX2) has been cloned that is a product of a different gene and abundantly expressed only in brain and skeletal muscle (7Li Z. Matsuoka S. Hryshko L.V. Nicoll D.A. Bersohn M.M. Burke E.P. Lifton R.P. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17434-17439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NCX1 and NCX2 have amino acid sequence identity of 65%, but their functional properties are rather similar (7Li Z. Matsuoka S. Hryshko L.V. Nicoll D.A. Bersohn M.M. Burke E.P. Lifton R.P. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17434-17439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The regulatory properties of the cardiac Na+/Ca2+exchanger have most extensively been characterized using giant excised membrane patches from cardiomyocytes or Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing the cardiac exchanger. The cardiac exchanger activity is modulated positively by cytoplasmic Ca2+and ATP (8Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1990; 344: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) and negatively by cytoplasmic Na+(9Hilgemann D.W. Matsuoka S. Nagel G.A. Collins A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 905-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) and exchanger inhibitory peptide (10Li Z. Nicoll D.A. Collins A. Hilgemann D.W. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. Weiss J.N. Tomich J.M. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1014-1020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, most of these regulatory properties can be abolished by treating the exchanger with chymotrypsin from the cytoplasmic side (8Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1990; 344: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) or deletion mutagenesis of the cytoplasmic domain (11Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. Reilly R.F. Hilgemann D.W. Philipson K.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3870-3874Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Therefore, the cytoplasmic domain is thought to be involved in the regulation of the exchanger. For the cardiac Na+/Ca2+exchanger, there is currently no strong evidence that protein phosphorylation is involved in the regulation of its activity. In squid giant axons, however, there is much evidence suggesting that protein kinase-dependent phosphorylation is responsible for stimulation of the exchanger activity induced by MgATP (12DiPolo R. Beauge L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1984; 84: 895-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 13DiPolo R. Beauge L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 897: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 14DiPolo R. Beauge L. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1382-C1391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the Na+/Ca2+exchanger in vascular smooth muscle cells is inhibited by depleting cellular ATP (15Smith J.B. Smith L. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: C302-C309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, phorbol esters (16Vigne P. Breittmayer J.-P. Duval D. Frelin C. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8078-8083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 8-bromo-cGMP (17Furukawa K.-I. Ohshima N. Tawada-Iwata Y. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12337-12341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), norepinephrine and high K+(18Khoyi M.A. Bjur R.A. Westfall D.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: C685-C690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and PDGF-BB (19Cirillo M. Quinn S.J. Romero J.R. Canessa M.L. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 847-856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were reported to stimulate the Na+/Ca2+exchange activity in smooth muscle cells and tissues. These findings suggest that phosphorylation of the exchanger itself or associated ancillary proteins may be involved in the exchanger activation in nerve and vascular smooth muscle cells. In the present study, we provide the first evidence that the Na+/Ca2+exchanger in rat aortic smooth muscle cells is phosphorylated and concomitantly activated in response to PDGF-BB, α-thrombin, or phorbol ester. The regulation of this exchanger by growth factors is very interesting, since elevation of [Ca2+]ihas been suggested to be important for cell proliferation (20Block L.H. Emmons L.R. Vogt E.

Biochem. 1990; 44: 39-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Some of these results have been presented in abstract form (22Iwamoto T. Wakabayashi S. Shimamoto A. Morita T. Shigekawa M. Can. J. Pharmacol. Physiol. 1994; 72: 527Google Scholar). Vascular smooth muscle cells were isolated from the thoracic aorta of male Wistar rats (200-300 g) by enzymatic dispersion as described by Chamley et al. (23Chamley J.H. Campbell G.R. McConnell J.D. Groeschel-Stewart U. Cell Tissue Res. 1977; 177: 503-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The resulting cells were grown for 4-5 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. After reaching confluence, cells were cultured in serum-free medium for an additional 24-48 h to enhance redifferentiation. A polyclonal anti-Na+/Ca2+exchanger antibody was raised by immunizing rabbits with a maltose-binding protein fusion protein containing a portion of the cytoplasmic domain (amino acids 273-769) of the dog cardiac Na+/Ca2+exchanger (2Nicoll D.A. Longoni S. Philipson K.D. Science. 1990; 250: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Preparation of the fusion protein and affinity purification of the antibody were described previously (24Iwata Y. Hanada H. Takahashi M. Shigekawa M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Confluent smooth muscle cells in 100-mm dishes were labeled for 5 h at 37°C in a phosphate-free, serum-free medium containing [32P]orthophosphate (10 MBq/ml). The cells were stimulated with growth factors for 2-20 min and washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cell monolayers were scraped, suspended in 800 μl of ice-cold buffer A (50 m M Hepes/Tris (pH 7.4), 150 m M NaCl, 3 m M KCl, 25 m M sodium pyrophosphate, 10 m M ATP, 5 m M EDTA, 1 m M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 m M benzamidine hydrochloride, 10 units/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin A), and then centrifuged for 15 min at 100,000 × g. The pellet was solubilized in 800 μl of ice-cold buffer A containing 1% C12E8for 15 min, and the lysate was centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 × g. The solubilized sample was pretreated with protein A-Sepharose beads at 4°C for 1 h and then incubated with an anti-Na+/Ca2+exchanger antibody at 4°C for 1 h. To this mixture, 50 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose beads previously blocked for at least 1 h with a C12E8extract of Escherichia coli was added and the resultant mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4°C in a rotating shaker. The beads were then washed eight times with buffer A containing 1% C12E8. Labeled proteins solubilized from beads by boiling in Laemmli's buffer were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 7.5% gel and visualized by Bioimage analyzer (BAS2000, Fuji Film Co.). SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed essentially as described (25Iwata Y. Nakamura H. Mizuno Y. Yoshida M. Ozawa E. Shigekawa M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 329: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The immunoblots were visualized using the ECL detection system (Amersham Corp.). Phosphopeptide mapping analysis was carried out as described previously (26Wakabayashi S. Bertrand B. Shigekawa M. Fafournoux P. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5583-5588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that 32P-labeled Na+/Ca2+exchanger protein, which was recovered from SDS-PAGE gel slices and resuspended in 500 μl of 50 m M NH4HCO3(pH 8.0), was digested with 20 μg of TPCK-treated trypsin for 16 h, instead of 24 h, at 37°C. Phosphoamino acid analysis was performed by the method of Cooper et al. (27Cooper J.A. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 387-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar) with modification. Briefly, the 32P-labeled Na+/Ca2+exchanger protein was first digested with TPCK-treated trypsin as described above and then hydrolyzed with 7 M HCl at 105°C for 1 h. The hydrolysate was dried, washed four times with 500 μl of water, and then suspended in 10 μl of water containing internal standards (10 μg each of phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine). Aliquots of the samples were applied onto thin-layer cellulose plates and amino acids were separated by electrophoresis for 1 h at 800 V in pyridine:acetic acid:water (5:45:950, v/v/v) (pH 3.6). Amino acids were reacted with ninhydrin and visualized using Bioimage analyzer. For Na+loading, confluent cells in 24-well dishes were incubated in 1 ml of BSS (10 m M Hepes/Tris (pH 7.4), 146 m M NaCl, 4 m M KCl, 2 m M MgCl2, 1 m M CaCl2, 10 m M glucose, and 0.1% BSA) containing 1 m M ouabain, 10 μM monensin, 10 m M NaHCO3, and 3 m M NaH2PO4at 37°C for 20 min. Cells were then incubated for 3 min with a Ca2+-free Na+loading solution to reduce elevated [Ca2+]ito a basal level. 45Ca2+uptake was initiated by switching the medium to a Na+-free BSS (replacing NaCl with equimolar KCl) or normal BSS, both of which contained 370 KBq/ml 45Ca2+, 1 m M ouabain, and 10 μM verapamil. After a 30-s incubation, 45Ca2+uptake was stopped by washing cells five times with an ice-cold solution containing 10 m M Hepes/Tris (pH 7.4), 120 m M choline chloride, and 10 m M LaCl3. For the growth factor treatment, the solutions contained growth factors from 10 min before the start of 45Ca2+uptake measurement. Cells were solubilized in 1% SDS and 10 m M Na2B4O7, and aliquots were taken for determination of radioactivity and protein. Na+/Ca2+exchange activity was estimated by subtracting 45Ca2+uptake activity in the normal BSS from that in Na+-free BSS. Protein was measured by a modified Lowry method (28Dulley J.R. Grieve P.A. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 64: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar) with BSA as a standard. Measurement of [Ca2+]i-[Ca2+]iin monolayered cultured cells was measured using fura-2 as a fluorescent Ca2+ indicator as described previously (29Furukawa K.-I. Tawada Y. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4844-4849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) . Measurement of [Na+]i-Cell Na+content was measured by equilibrating cells with BSS containing 22Na+(740 KBq/ml), and [Na+]iwas calculated by adopting 4.5 μl/mg protein as the total intracellular water space (30Smith J.B. Zheng T. Smith L. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C147-C154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Confluent cells in 12-well dishes were stimulated with PDGF-BB in 1 ml of BSS. After appropriate intervals, incubation was terminated by adding 1 ml of ice-cold methanol. After extraction of lipids, 1,2-diacylglycerol was measured with the sn-1,2-diacylglycerol assay reagent system (Amersham) using a thin layer chromatography to separate phosphatidic acid converted from 1,2-diacylglycerol. Experimental results are expressed as means ± S.D. Significant differences were assessed with a one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's test. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. 45CaCl2 and 22NaCl were obtained from DuPont NEN, and [32P]orthophosphate and sn-1,2-diacylglycerol assay reagent system were obtained from Amersham. BSA (fatty acid-free), α-thrombin, cyclopiazonic acid, monensin, ouabain, PMA, and verapamil were from Sigma. PDGF-BB was purchased from Becton Dickson Laboratories. Ionomycin was from Calbiochem. Fura-2/acetoxymetylester was from Dojindo Laboratories. Angiotensin II was from the Peptide Institute. C12E8was purchased from Nikkol Chemical Co. Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). All other chemicals were of analytical grade. We investigated growth factor-induced phosphorylation of the Na+/Ca2+exchanger by immunoprecipitation from serum-depleted rat aortic smooth muscle cells metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate. The antibody used, which was raised against a portion of the cytoplasmic domain of the dog cardiac Na+/Ca2+exchanger and affinity-purified, recognized a broad band covering the expected molecular mass for the Na+/Ca2+exchanger (125 kDa), when the immunoprecipitated material was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and protein staining (Fig. 1 A). This broad band may be caused by glycosylation of the exchanger protein (1Philipson K.D. Nicoll D.A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1993; 137C: 199-227PubMed Google Scholar) or the presence of alternatively spliced exchanger isoforms (3Nakasaki Y. Iwamoto T. Hanada H. Imagawa T. Shigekawa M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 114: 528-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 6Kofuji P. Lederer W.J. Schulze D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5145-5149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that this protein band was phosphorylated in serum-depleted, unstimulated cells (Fig. 1 B). When these cells were treated with 10 or 20 ng/ml PDGF-BB for 10 min, the extent of phosphorylation increased to 146 ± 9% or 166 ± 15% (n = 3) of that for the untreated cells (Fig. 1 B). Treatment of cells with 10 n Mα-thrombin or 100 n M PMA for 10 min also increased the phosphorylation to 140 ± 9% or 145 ± 11% (n = 3), respectively (Fig. 1, B and C). However, 100 n M angiotensin II did not increase the phosphorylation significantly (118 ± 6%, n = 3) under the equivalent experimental conditions (Fig. 1 C). Thus PDGF-BB, α-thrombin, and PMA induced Na+/Ca2+exchanger phosphorylation in serum-depleted aortic smooth muscle cells. We found that removal of extracellular Ca2+decreased the basal and PDGF-BB-induced exchanger phosphorylation slightly; in 4 m M EGTA, the basal phosphorylation was 83% (n = 2) of the control value, whereas PDGF-BB (10 ng/ml, 10 min) increased the exchanger phosphorylation to 132% (n = 2) under the same conditions. A time course of PDGF-BB-induced phosphorylation of the Na+/Ca2+exchanger is shown in Fig. 2, and the results of three similar experiments analyzed densitometrically are summarized in Fig. 3. In the same latter figure, we also show the time courses of PDGF-BB-induced changes in [Ca2+]iand a 1,2-diacylglycerol level. The PDGF-BB-induced phosphorylation increased with time, reaching 169 ± 17% (n = 3) of the control level at 20 min. Under the same conditions, [Ca2+]ireached a peak (450 ± 40 n M, n = 4) within 2 min, followed by a slow decline. The formation of 1,2-diacylglycerol, on the other hand, increased from a basal level of 91 ± 8 pmol/106cells (n = 4) to a high level of 191 ± 20 pmol/106cells at 20 min. In contrast to PDGF-BB, 100 n M angiotensin II, which did not enhance the exchanger phosphorylation significantly (Fig. 1 C), increased the formation of 1,2-diacylglycerol to a lower level (126 ± 16 pmol/106cells (n = 4) at 10 min), as compared with PDGF-BB (189 ± 30 pmol/106cells (n = 4) at 10 min).FIG. 3Time courses of PDGF-BB-induced changes in Na+/Ca2+ exchanger phosphorylation, [Ca2+], and 1,2-diacylglycerol level. In cells stimulated with 10 ng/ml PDGF-BB for indicated periods of time, changes in the Na+/Ca2+exchanger phosphorylation, [Ca2+], and the1,2-diacylglycerol content were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.”32P incorporation into the Na+/Ca2+exchanger (cf. Fig. 2) was quantified by densitometry using Bioimage analyzer. Results are presented as the mean ± S.D. (n = 3 or 4). *, significant difference from cells at 0 min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To characterize sites for the basal and stimuli-enhanced phosphorylation in the Na+/Ca2+exchanger, we performed two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide mapping as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 4). Tryptic digestion of the 32P-labeled Na+/Ca2+exchanger in unstimulated cells generated four major phosphopeptides (P1, P2, P3, and P4). Occasionally one minor spot (P5), which may represent a partially digested phosphopeptide, was observed. Stimulation of cells with PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) and PMA (100 n M) for 20 min resulted in a significant increase in the amounts of 32P label incorporated into P1 and, to a lesser extent, into P2. In unstimulated cells, P1 was weakly phosphorylated, representing less than 15% of the total 32P label incorporated. In contrast, it accounted for 40-50% of the total 32P label in PDGF-BB- and PMA-stimulated cells. These results indicate that phosphorylation of the Na+/Ca2+exchanger occurs at multiple sites and that PDGF-BB and PMA enhance phosphorylation of the same phosphopeptides. Phosphoamino acid analysis was performed on the phosphorylated Na+/Ca2+exchanger (Fig. 5). The Na+/Ca2+exchanger phosphorylation in the basal, and PDGF-BB- and PMA-stimulated cells occurred exclusively on serine residues, not on threonine or tyrosine residues. The result indicates the involvement of serine kinase(s) in the Na+/Ca2+exchanger phosphorylation. We examined the effect of treatment with PDGF-BB (10 or 20 ng/ml), α-thrombin (10 n M), angiotensin II (100 n M), or PMA (100 n M) for 10 min on Na+i-dependent 45Ca2+uptake (reverse mode of the Na+/Ca2+exchanger) in Na+-loaded rat aortic smooth muscle cells, as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 6). Because these agents except for PMA increased [Ca2+]ifrom basal levels of 100-150 n M to peak levels of 400-550 n M and because Na+/Ca2+exchange depends on [Ca2+]i, cells had been exposed to a Ca2+-free solution containing these agents during the last 3 min of the 10-min treatment in order to reduce [Ca2+]ito a basal level. As shown in Fig. 6, treatment of cells with PDGF-BB or α-thrombin caused a significant increase (120-130% of the control value) in Na+i-dependent 45Ca2+uptake. The extent of such PDGF-BB-induced activation was similar, when cells had been incubated with 30 to 146 m M Na+and loaded with different levels of Na+(data not shown). It should be mentioned that cell Na+loading itself was not affected by prior treatment with PDGF-BB; when cells were equilibrated with 146 m M22Na+in the presence and absence of 20 ng/ml PDGF-BB, [22Na+]iimmediately after the transfer of cells to the 45Ca2+uptake medium were 97 ± 4 and 99 ± 5 m M (n = 4) in control and PDGF-BB-treated cells, respectively. On the other hand, angiotensin II did not affect Na+i-dependent 45Ca2+uptake (Fig. 6). However, PMA enhanced the 45Ca2+uptake significantly. It is important to note that there is apparent parallelism between these growth factor-induced increases in Na+/Ca2+exchange activity and the phosphorylation of the exchanger (Fig. 6). We also examined whether PDGF-BB was able to enhance Na+o-dependent decline in [Ca2+]ivia the forward mode of Na+/Ca2+exchanger in aortic smooth muscle cells (Fig. 7). We treated cells with 50 μM cyclopiazonic acid in Ca2+- and Na+-free, high pH (pH 8.8) BSS containing 20 m M Mg2+, which inhibits Ca2+extrusion via the Na+/Ca2+exchanger and the ATP-dependent Ca2+pump (31Furukawa K.-I. Tawada Y. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8058-8065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After [Ca2+]ireached a plateau level of about 300 n M (about 2 min later), Na+was added extracellularly to a final concentration of 50 m M. In unstimulated cells, Na+oevoked a decline in [Ca2+]i(initial rate of decline, 33 ± 6 n M/10 s (n = 3)) (Fig. 7 A), although addition of choline chloride, in place of NaCl, did not affect [Ca2+]i(data not shown). When cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml PDGF-BB for 20 min, the initial rate of Na+o-induced [Ca2+]idecline significantly increased to 89 ± 12 n M/10 s (n = 3), and [Ca2+]ireached a lower steady state level (Fig. 7 A). Interestingly, the PDGF-BB-induced stimulation of Na+o-dependent decline in [Ca2+]iwas abolished (initial rate of decline, 36 ± 8 n M/10 s (n = 3)) by pretreatment of cells with 100 n M PMA for 24 h, suggesting that protein kinase C is involved in such activation of Na+/Ca2+exchanger (Fig. 7 B). In the present study, we demonstrated that the Na+/Ca2+exchanger was phosphorylated in quiescent smooth muscle cells and that the phosphorylation was enhanced by up to 1.7-fold in response to PDGF-BB, α-thrombin, or PMA (Figs. 1, 3, and 6). This is the first demonstration of phosphorylation of the Na+/Ca2+exchanger in response to the physiological ligands. PDGF-BB was the most potent stimulator of exchanger phosphorylation among the agents tested. Tryptic phosphopeptide map analysis revealed that the same four major phosphopeptides (P1, P2, P3, and P4) were generated in unstimulated as well as PDGF-BB- or PMA-stimulated cells, suggesting that the exchanger phosphorylation occurs at multiple sites (Fig. 4). Phosphorylation of P1 and, to a lesser extent, of P2 was enhanced in PDGF-BB- and PMA-treated cells, and the phosphopeptide maps were essentially the same for these cells. P1 contains major site(s) for phosphorylation by PDGF-BB and phorbol ester, because 32P label incorporation into P1, which accounted for less than 15% of the total exchanger phosphorylation, increased to 40-50% of the total phosphorylation after PDGF-BB and PMA treatment. Furthermore, phosphorylated amino acids in the exchanger were exclusively serine residues in both quiescent and PDGF-BB- or PMA-stimulated cells (Fig. 5), indicating the involvement of serine protein kinase(s). Taken together, these results suggest that the Na+/Ca2+exchanger in vascular smooth muscle cells is phosphorylated in response to PDGF-BB or α-thrombin via a protein kinase C-dependent pathway. We do not know, however, whether protein kinase C directly phosphorylates the exchanger or whether it phosphorylates and activates a secondary serine/threonine kinase. The involvement of protein kinase C is consistent with the well known facts that signaling by PDGF-BB and α-thrombin occurs through activation of phospholipase C-γ1 and phospholipase C-β1, respectively, that produce inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and 1,2-diacylglycerol from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (32Rhee S.G. Choi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12393-12396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, we observed elevation of 1,2-diacylglycerol in PDGF-BB-stimulated cells (Fig. 3). At present, however, we cannot rule out the possibility that other protein kinases such as Ca2+/calmodulin kinase II were also involved in the exchanger phosphorylation, because PDGF-BB induced a prolonged increase in [Ca2+]i(Fig. 3) and because increased [Ca2+]iseemed to be able to enhance the exchanger phosphorylation (see “Results”). Primary structure of the Na+/Ca2+exchanger in rat aortic smooth muscle cells is highly homologous to the canine cardiac exchanger except for the NH2-terminal portion, which is presumably a cleaved signal sequence, and part (amino acid residues 570-621) of the large cytoplasmic domain (3Nakasaki Y. Iwamoto T. Hanada H. Imagawa T. Shigekawa M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 114: 528-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain is considered to be involved in the regulation of the exchanger as briefly discussed in the introduction. The cytoplasmic domain of the smooth muscle Na+/Ca2+exchanger contains several candidate phosphorylation site sequences for serine/threonine kinases such as protein kinase C, Ca2+/calmodulin kinase II, and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (33Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). One of such sequences Arg-Lys-Ala-Val-Ser357, which is also conserved in the cardiac Na+/Ca2+exchanger (2Nicoll D.A. Longoni S. Philipson K.D. Science. 1990; 250: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar), is a good candidate for the phosphorylation site. Regulation of the Na+/Ca2+exchanger in vascular smooth muscle cells is important to maintain cellular Ca2+homeostasis. Recently, phorbol esters (16Vigne P. Breittmayer J.-P. Duval D. Frelin C. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8078-8083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cGMP (17Furukawa K.-I. Ohshima N. Tawada-Iwata Y. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12337-12341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), norepinephrine and high K+(18Khoyi M.A. Bjur R.A. Westfall D.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: C685-C690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and PDGF-BB (19Cirillo M. Quinn S.J. Romero J.R. Canessa M.L. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 847-856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been reported to stimulate Na+/Ca2+exchange in A7r5 cells, rat aortic smooth muscle cells, and rabbit aortic rings. However, there has been no information about the mechanism by which these agents enhance the exchange activity, except that norepinephrine and high K+were later shown to cause cytoplasmic Na+retention that may partially explain the observed increase in Na+/Ca2+exchange (34Khoyi M.A. Bjur R.A. Westfall D.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1325-C1331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we determined the effects of PDGF-BB and other agents on Na+i-dependent 45Ca2+uptake (the reverse mode of Na+/Ca2+exchange) in rat aortic smooth muscle cells. We found that PDGF-BB, α-thrombin, and PMA significantly enhanced the Na+i-dependent 45Ca2+uptake (Fig. 6). Furthermore, PDGF-BB stimulated Na+o-dependent [Ca2+]idecline under conditions in which the plasma membrane and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+pumps were inhibited (Fig. 7). It should be noted that PDGF-BB stimulated Na+i-dependent 45Ca2+uptake only by about 1.3-fold, whereas it stimulated Na+o-dependent [Ca2+]idecline to a greater extent (about 3-fold when the initial rate of [Ca2+]idecline was measured) (cf. Figs. 6 and 7). For this apparent discrepancy, we are currently unable to provide an explanation. It should also be noted that stimulation of Na+o-dependent [Ca2+]idecline by PDGF-BB was abolished by prolonged pretreatment of cells with PMA, a procedure that down-regulates the protein kinase C content in the plasma membrane (35Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1986; 2: 149-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). All these results suggest that activity of the Na+/Ca2+exchanger is positively regulated by growth factors and that the PDGF-BB-induced increase in Na+/Ca2+exchange activity, like the phosphorylation of the exchanger, is mediated via a protein kinase C-dependent pathway. In contrast to other growth factors tested, angiotensin II did not significantly increase both Na+/Ca2+exchange and phosphorylation of the exchanger (Figs. 1 C and 6). α-Thrombin and PMA induced intermediate levels of activation of these parameters (Fig. 6). Thus, there is apparently a good correlation between the extents of stimulation of Na+/Ca2+exchange and phosphorylation of the exchanger induced by different growth factors. We found that angiotensin II increased 1,2-diacylglycerol content to a low level under our experimental conditions when compared with PDGF-BB (see “Results”). Therefore, the inability of angiotensin II to enhance Na+/Ca2+exchange and the exchanger phosphorylation seems to be due to a low level of 1,2-diacylglycerol produced. Production of different levels of 1,2-diacylglycerol in response to PDGF-BB and angiotensin II seems to indicate that these two growth factors differ in their capacity to activate protein kinase C in the primary cultured smooth muscle cells used in this study. PDGF and α-thrombin are powerful mitogens for cells of mesenchymal origin including vascular smooth muscle cells (36Pouyssegur J. Seuwen K. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 195-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). They increase [Ca2+]itransiently and induce cascades of events such as activation of ion transporters, phosphorylation of proteins, and expression of a number of genes that are associated with cell proliferation. The increase in [Ca2+]imay be required for mitogenic signaling at least in certain cell types, since Ca2+blockers and chelators are able to inhibit growth factor-induced mitogenesis in those cells (20Block L.H.

Biochem. 1990; 44: 39-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). On the other hand, transient exposure of growth-arrested vascular smooth muscle or other types of cells to PDGF, α-thrombin, or phorbol esters result in activation of the Na+/H+exchanger and Na+/K+/Cl+cotransporter (37Moolenaar W.H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1986; 48: 363-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 38Huang C.-L. Cogan M.G. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Ives H.E. J. Biol.

In addition, phorbol esters are able to stimulate the plasma membrane Ca2+pump in vascular smooth muscle cells and other cell types (29Furukawa K.-I. Tawada Y. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4844-4849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Smallwood J.I. Gugi B. Rasmussen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2195-2202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We presented evidence suggesting that protein kinase C directly phosphorylates and activates the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (41Fukuda T. Ogurusu T. Furukawa K.-I. Shigekawa M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 108: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 42Ogurusu T. Wakabayashi S. Furukawa K.-I. Tawada-Iwata Y. Imagawa T. Shigekawa M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 108: 222-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Our finding that PDGF-BB, α-thrombin, and PMA stimulate the Na+/Ca2+exchanger in aortic smooth muscle cells indicate that this exchanger is also one of the targets involved in the growth factor-induced ionic changes that may be required for the cellular proliferative cycle to proceed properly. Regulation of the Na+/Ca2+exchanger has been studied most extensively in canine cardiomyocytes and squid giant axons (1Philipson K.D. Nicoll D.A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1993; 137C: 199-227PubMed Google Scholar). In squid giant axons, ATP and its slowly hydrolyzable analog ATPγS have been shown to activate the Na+/Ca2+exchanger in the presence of Mg2+and micromolar cytoplasmic Ca2+(13DiPolo R. Beauge L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 897: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and inorganic phosphate and vanadate have been shown to markedly enhance the ATP-dependent stimulation (12DiPolo R. Beauge L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1984; 84: 895-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 14DiPolo R. Beauge L. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1382-C1391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings strongly support the view that the Na+/Ca2+exchanger is regulated by phosphorylation in squid axons. In contrast, ATP-dependent stimulation of Na+/Ca2+exchange in cardiomyocytes under patch clamp conditions does not require intracellular Ca2+, cannot be mimicked by ATPγS, and is not enhanced by phosphatase inhibitors (43Collins A. Somlyo A.V. Hilgemann D.W. J. Physiol. 1992; 454: 27-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). These results suggest no involvement of kinases or phosphatases in regulation of the cardiac exchanger, although it was once reported that the exchange activity of cardiac sarcolemma vesicles was modulated by a calmodulin-dependent kinase and phosphatase (44Caroni P. Carafoli E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 132: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The stimulation of the cardiac exchanger by ATP under patch conditions is thus thought to be caused indirectly by phospholipid asymmetry in the sarcolemma generated by a lipid flipase (45Hilgemann D.W. Collins A. J. Physiol. 1992; 454: 59-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Therefore regulation of the Na+/Ca2+exchanger by phosphorylation currently seems to be a property shared only by squid axon and smooth muscle exchangers, although we have no information regarding how similar are these mammalian and non-mammalian exchanger isoforms with respect to their structure and regulation. Regulation of the cardiac isoform by protein phosphorylation obviously requires further investigation."

Freedman N.J. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23735-23738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Much less is known about the desensitization mechanisms of PLC-coupled receptors, although the available evidence suggests that, again, phosphorylation may play a critical role (5Tobin A.B. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9817-9823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Takano T. Honda Z. Sakanaka C. Izumi T. Kameyama K. Haga K. Haga T. Kurokawa K. Shimizu T. J. Biol.

One would expect that such desensitization-defective receptors, when activated, mediate prolonged rather than short-lived generation of second messengers. Prolonged signal generation is likely to affect long-term cellular responses such as cell growth and differentiation. Our approach makes use of the receptor for the decapeptide neurokinin A (NKA, also known as substance K; tachykinin receptor subtype, NK-2) (7Masu Y. Nakayama K. Tamaki H. Harada Y. Kuno M. Nakanishi S. Nature. 1987; 329: 836-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 8Gerard N.P. Eddy Jr., R.L. Shows T.B. Gerard C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20455-20462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The neurokinins (tachykinins) are a family of neuropeptides involved in diverse physiological and pathological processes, ranging from inflammation to neurotransmission. Where tested, the neurokinin receptors couple to stimulation of PLC with subsequent mobilization of Ca2+from intracellular stores (9Nakajima Y. Tsuchida K. Negishi M. Ito S. Nakanishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2437-2442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Debernardi M.A. Seki T. Brooker G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In some cell systems, there is additional coupling to stimulation of adenylyl cyclase, either directly via Gs(9Nakajima Y. Tsuchida K. Negishi M. Ito S. Nakanishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2437-2442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or secondary to Ca2+mobilization (10Debernardi M.A. Seki T. Brooker G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9257-9261Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), or arachidonate metabolism (13Eistetter H.E. Church D.J. Mills A. Godfrey P.P. Capponi A.M. Brewster R. Schulz M.F. Kawashima E. Arkinstall S.J. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 767-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Like other G protein-coupled receptors, the neurokinin receptors undergo agonist-induced desensitization, but the molecular basis is not known, although C-terminal phosphorylation would be a plausible mechanism. However, a recent study (14Cyr C.R. Rudy B. Kris R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26071-26074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reports that the C-terminal domain of the NK-2 receptor is not involved in desensitization.To address the possible role of the cytoplasmic tail in NK-2 receptor signaling and desensitization, we have constructed and selected mutant receptors that lack various parts of the C-terminal tail and yet remain coupled to PLC activation in an agonist-dependent manner. We expressed these mutant receptors in various cell systems, including Rat-1 fibroblasts, COS cells, and Sf9 insect cells, and examined how their signaling properties are altered. Our results indicate that truncated receptors mediate enhanced and prolonged activation of signaling pathways, apparently due to loss of regulatory phosphorylation sites in the C-terminal domain.DISCUSSIONDesensitization of G protein-coupled receptors is a complex process involving various molecular mechanisms. Deletion or mutation of putative phosphorylation sites in G protein-coupled receptors has indicated the importance of receptor phosphorylation in mediating desensitization (28Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6044-6050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Strader C.D. Sigal I.S. Blake A.D. Cheung A.H. Register R.B. Rands E. Zemcik B.A. Candelore M.R. Dixon R.A.F.

Chem. 1993; 268: 13650-13656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, agonist-induced Ser/Thr phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tail has been implicated in receptor desensitization. We have used the NK-2 receptor as a model system for investigating the role of the C-terminal domain in receptor signaling, desensitization, and phosphorylation. Our major findings can be summarized as follows: (i) C-terminal deletion of 60 or 70 residues results in a receptor that is still functional but fails to undergo desensitization in response to agonist; (ii) truncated receptors are resistant to inhibition by PKC-activating phorbol ester; and (iii) wild-type receptor, but not truncated receptor, is phosphorylated upon addition of either NKA or phorbol ester. From these results, we conclude that C-terminal tail phosphorylation is responsible for both homologous and heterologous desensitization of the human NK-2 receptor.That truncated receptors (Δ328 and Δ338) are desensitization defective is indicated by their sustained stimulation of both PLC and AC as compared with the transient activation observed with wt receptor. It is noteworthy that despite sustained PLC activation, the kinetics of NKA-induced Ca2+signal from intracellular stores (reflecting IP3action) were the same for wt and mutant receptors. This indicates that the rate-limiting step for termination of Ca2+signaling occurs downstream of the receptor, most likely at the level of IP3catabolism and/or IP3receptor regulation.Generation of cAMP by deletion mutants follows a pattern similar to IPnformation. All our results point to a pivotal role of PKC in stimulating AC activity, although PKC-activating phorbol ester alone is incapable of raising cAMP levels in Rat-1 cells; hence, additional mechanisms are likely to participate in AC activation by (truncated) NK-2 receptors. In transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells, the neurokinin receptors also couple to stimulation of both PLC and AC, although it is not clear whether AC activation is PKC dependent as it is in Rat-1 cells (9Nakajima Y. Tsuchida K. Negishi M. Ito S. Nakanishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2437-2442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In another study on transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells, the NK-2 receptor reportedly mediates enhanced cAMP generation as a secondary response to eicosanoid production (13Eistetter H.E. Church D.J. Mills A. Godfrey P.P. Capponi A.M. Brewster R. Schulz M.F. Kawashima E. Arkinstall S.J. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 767-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, our results argue against a role for eicosanoids in NKA-induced cAMP formation. Whatever the exact mechanisms of enhanced cAMP generation, the data show that at least two distinct effectors, PLC and AC, are constitutively activated by truncated receptors, indicating the importance of the C-terminal tail in controlling signal termination.In a recent study on desensitization of endothelin and NK-2 receptors, Cyr et al. (14Cyr C.R. Rudy B. Kris R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26071-26074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that a truncated human NK-2 receptor (Δ336), nearly identical to the Δ338 construct used in the present study, behaves like wild-type receptor; the authors conclude that the C-terminal tail of the NK-2 receptor has no apparent role in desensitization. The discrepancy with the present study remains unexplained. However, direct comparison should be made with caution because the expression systems used were very different (Xenopus oocytes versus mammalian cells).Our results strongly suggest that receptor phosphorylation occurs at the C-terminal tail and is causally related to the observed receptor desensitization. Basal and agonist-induced phosphorylation of wt and mutant receptors is readily detected in COS cells and baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells. In both systems, the unstimulated wt receptor exists in a phosphorylated state. It remains to be seen whether this represents a normal physiological state, since our efforts to measure receptor phosphorylation at “normal” expression levels (as in Rat-1 transfectants) were unsuccessful. In COS cells and Sf9 cells, both NKA and phorbol ester induce a significant increase in basal phosphorylation of wt but not mutant receptors. We also find that the deletion mutants become resistant to inhibition by PKC and that inhibition or down-regulation of PKC results in enhanced NKA-induced PLC activity in stable transfectants. From these results, we conclude that by phosphorylating one or more C-terminal Ser/Thr residues, PKC mediates (feedback) inhibition of receptor signaling and thus participates in both homologous and heterologous desensitization.The apparent involvement of PKC does not, of course, exclude the involvement of specific receptor kinases in mediating receptor phosphorylation and desensitization. The deleted part of the NK-2 receptor C terminus contains several consensus phosphorylation sites for both PKC (three sites) and βARK (six sites). In fact, the related NK-1 receptor can be phosphorylated by the β-adrenergic receptor kinases βARK1 and βARK2 (32Kwatra M.M. Schwinn D.A. Schreurs J. Blank J.L. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. Krause J.E. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9161-9164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), at least in vitro. The visual receptor rhodopsin is a target for both PKC and a specific rhodopsin kinase in a ligand-dependent manner (33Newton A. Williams D.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 275-277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Signal attenuation by the PLC-coupled thrombin receptor is also mediated, at least in part, by βARK (34Ishii K. Chen J. Ishii M. Koch W.J. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1125-1130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the PLC-coupled receptor for platelet-activating factor may be a target for βARK (6Takano T. Honda Z. Sakanaka C. Izumi T. Kameyama K. Haga K. Haga T. Kurokawa K. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22453-22458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Future studies should reveal whether the βARKs, which recognize only the ligand-activated form of the receptor, are also involved in NK-2 receptor phosphorylation and desensitization.In conclusion, our results indicate a close link between C-terminal tail phosphorylation and signal attenuation of the human NK-2 receptor. Phosphorylation somehow leads to decreased coupling efficiency to the relevant G protein(s). The exact phosphorylation sites and the protein kinase(s) responsible remain to be identified in further experiments. Another outstanding question is whether sustained PLC stimulation mediated by truncated NK-2 receptors leads to altered long-term cell behavior, such as cell cycle progression and induction of mitogenesis. We hope to address these questions in further studies. Signal transduction via G protein-coupled receptors is characterized by rapid desensitization, i.e. attenuation of cellular responses upon prolonged or repeated agonist exposure (1Dohlman H.G.

We are interested to examine how signal transduction via PLC-coupled receptors and their cellular actions are altered when the putative “desensitization domain” of the receptor is deleted or mutated. One would expect that such desensitization-defective receptors, when activated, mediate prolonged rather than short-lived generation of second messengers. Prolonged signal generation is likely to affect long-term cellular responses such as cell growth and differentiation. Our approach makes use of the receptor for the decapeptide neurokinin A (NKA, also known as substance K; tachykinin receptor subtype, NK-2) (7Masu Y. Nakayama K. Tamaki H. Harada Y. Kuno M. Nakanishi S. Nature. 1987; 329: 836-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 8Gerard N.P. Eddy Jr., R.L. Shows T.B. Gerard C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20455-20462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The neurokinins (tachykinins) are a family of neuropeptides involved in diverse physiological and pathological processes, ranging from inflammation to neurotransmission. Where tested, the neurokinin receptors couple to stimulation of PLC with subsequent mobilization of Ca2+from intracellular stores (9Nakajima Y. Tsuchida K. Negishi M. Ito S. Nakanishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2437-2442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Debernardi M.A. Seki T. Brooker G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In some cell systems, there is additional coupling to stimulation of adenylyl cyclase, either directly via Gs(9Nakajima Y. Tsuchida K. Negishi M. Ito S. Nakanishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2437-2442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or secondary to Ca2+mobilization (10Debernardi M.A. Seki T. Brooker G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Arkinstall S.J. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 767-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Like other G protein-coupled receptors, the neurokinin receptors undergo agonist-induced desensitization, but the molecular basis is not known, although C-terminal phosphorylation would be a plausible mechanism. However, a recent study (14Cyr C.R. Rudy B. Kris R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26071-26074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reports that the C-terminal domain of the NK-2 receptor is not involved in desensitization. To address the possible role of the cytoplasmic tail in NK-2 receptor signaling and desensitization, we have constructed and selected mutant receptors that lack various parts of the C-terminal tail and yet remain coupled to PLC activation in an agonist-dependent manner. We expressed these mutant receptors in various cell systems, including Rat-1 fibroblasts, COS cells, and Sf9 insect cells, and examined how their signaling properties are altered. Our results indicate that truncated receptors mediate enhanced and prolonged activation of signaling pathways, apparently due to loss of regulatory phosphorylation sites in the C-terminal domain. DISCUSSIONDesensitization of G protein-coupled receptors is a complex process involving various molecular mechanisms. Deletion or mutation of putative phosphorylation sites in G protein-coupled receptors has indicated the importance of receptor phosphorylation in mediating desensitization (28Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6044-6050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Strader C.D. Sigal I.S. Blake A.D. Cheung A.H. Register R.B. Rands E. Zemcik B.A. Candelore M.R. Dixon R.A.F.

Chem. 1993; 268: 13650-13656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, agonist-induced Ser/Thr phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tail has been implicated in receptor desensitization. We have used the NK-2 receptor as a model system for investigating the role of the C-terminal domain in receptor signaling, desensitization, and phosphorylation. Our major findings can be summarized as follows: (i) C-terminal deletion of 60 or 70 residues results in a receptor that is still functional but fails to undergo desensitization in response to agonist; (ii) truncated receptors are resistant to inhibition by PKC-activating phorbol ester; and (iii) wild-type receptor, but not truncated receptor, is phosphorylated upon addition of either NKA or phorbol ester. From these results, we conclude that C-terminal tail phosphorylation is responsible for both homologous and heterologous desensitization of the human NK-2 receptor.That truncated receptors (Δ328 and Δ338) are desensitization defective is indicated by their sustained stimulation of both PLC and AC as compared with the transient activation observed with wt receptor. It is noteworthy that despite sustained PLC activation, the kinetics of NKA-induced Ca2+signal from intracellular stores (reflecting IP3action) were the same for wt and mutant receptors. This indicates that the rate-limiting step for termination of Ca2+signaling occurs downstream of the receptor, most likely at the level of IP3catabolism and/or IP3receptor regulation.Generation of cAMP by deletion mutants follows a pattern similar to IPnformation. All our results point to a pivotal role of PKC in stimulating AC activity, although PKC-activating phorbol ester alone is incapable of raising cAMP levels in Rat-1 cells; hence, additional mechanisms are likely to participate in AC activation by (truncated) NK-2 receptors. In transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells, the neurokinin receptors also couple to stimulation of both PLC and AC, although it is not clear whether AC activation is PKC dependent as it is in Rat-1 cells (9Nakajima Y. Tsuchida K. Negishi M. Ito S. Nakanishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2437-2442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In another study on transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells, the NK-2 receptor reportedly mediates enhanced cAMP generation as a secondary response to eicosanoid production (13Eistetter H.E. Church D.J. Mills A. Godfrey P.P. Capponi A.M. Brewster R. Schulz M.F. Kawashima E. Arkinstall S.J. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 767-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, our results argue against a role for eicosanoids in NKA-induced cAMP formation. Whatever the exact mechanisms of enhanced cAMP generation, the data show that at least two distinct effectors, PLC and AC, are constitutively activated by truncated receptors, indicating the importance of the C-terminal tail in controlling signal termination.In a recent study on desensitization of endothelin and NK-2 receptors, Cyr et al. (14Cyr C.R. Rudy B. Kris R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26071-26074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that a truncated human NK-2 receptor (Δ336), nearly identical to the Δ338 construct used in the present study, behaves like wild-type receptor; the authors conclude that the C-terminal tail of the NK-2 receptor has no apparent role in desensitization. The discrepancy with the present study remains unexplained. However, direct comparison should be made with caution because the expression systems used were very different (Xenopus oocytes versus mammalian cells).Our results strongly suggest that receptor phosphorylation occurs at the C-terminal tail and is causally related to the observed receptor desensitization. Basal and agonist-induced phosphorylation of wt and mutant receptors is readily detected in COS cells and baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells. In both systems, the unstimulated wt receptor exists in a phosphorylated state. It remains to be seen whether this represents a normal physiological state, since our efforts to measure receptor phosphorylation at “normal” expression levels (as in Rat-1 transfectants) were unsuccessful. In COS cells and Sf9 cells, both NKA and phorbol ester induce a significant increase in basal phosphorylation of wt but not mutant receptors. We also find that the deletion mutants become resistant to inhibition by PKC and that inhibition or down-regulation of PKC results in enhanced NKA-induced PLC activity in stable transfectants. From these results, we conclude that by phosphorylating one or more C-terminal Ser/Thr residues, PKC mediates (feedback) inhibition of receptor signaling and thus participates in both homologous and heterologous desensitization.The apparent involvement of PKC does not, of course, exclude the involvement of specific receptor kinases in mediating receptor phosphorylation and desensitization. The deleted part of the NK-2 receptor C terminus contains several consensus phosphorylation sites for both PKC (three sites) and βARK (six sites). In fact, the related NK-1 receptor can be phosphorylated by the β-adrenergic receptor kinases βARK1 and βARK2 (32Kwatra M.M. Schwinn D.A. Schreurs J. Blank J.L. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. Krause J.E. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9161-9164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), at least in vitro. The visual receptor rhodopsin is a target for both PKC and a specific rhodopsin kinase in a ligand-dependent manner (33Newton A. Williams D.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 275-277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Signal attenuation by the PLC-coupled thrombin receptor is also mediated, at least in part, by βARK (34Ishii K. Chen J. Ishii M. Koch W.J. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1125-1130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the PLC-coupled receptor for platelet-activating factor may be a target for βARK (6Takano T. Honda Z. Sakanaka C. Izumi T. Kameyama K. Haga K. Haga T. Kurokawa K. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22453-22458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Future studies should reveal whether the βARKs, which recognize only the ligand-activated form of the receptor, are also involved in NK-2 receptor phosphorylation and desensitization.In conclusion, our results indicate a close link between C-terminal tail phosphorylation and signal attenuation of the human NK-2 receptor. Phosphorylation somehow leads to decreased coupling efficiency to the relevant G protein(s). The exact phosphorylation sites and the protein kinase(s) responsible remain to be identified in further experiments. Another outstanding question is whether sustained PLC stimulation mediated by truncated NK-2 receptors leads to altered long-term cell behavior, such as cell cycle progression and induction of mitogenesis. We hope to address these questions in further studies. Desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors is a complex process involving various molecular mechanisms.

This repertoire of enzymes, in addition to the β- N-acetylglucosaminidase, includes a β-galactosidase, three endoglycosidases, and a neuraminidase that are thought to aid the organism in the breakdown of oligosaccharides in its surrounding environment for use as a carbon source. In particular, the neuraminidase has been implicated in the process of pathogenesis. By cleaving the terminal sialic acids on cell-surface glycolipids, it is thought that the neuraminidase can expose the carbohydrate ligand by which the S. pneumoniae attaches to the host (4Krivan H.C. Roberts D.D. Ginsburg V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6157-6161Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 5Linder T.E. Daniels R.L. Lim D.J. Demaria T.F. Microb. Pathog. 1994; 16: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). S. pneumoniae also synthesizes and secretes a hyaluronidase that is capable of degrading a component of the extracellular matrix and may aid the organism to invade underlying host tissue (6Boulnois G.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Since GlcNAcβ1-linked residues are common components of several cell-surface molecules in host tissues, it is possible that β- N-acetylglucosaminidase also has a pathogenic role. All of these glycosidases are important reagents for oligosaccharide analysis. β- N-Acetylglucosaminidase has been demonstrated to have broad specificity using GlcNAc-Gal, hydrolyzing both β1-3 and β1-6 linkages that are commonly found in mucins. By contrast, the hydrolysis of N-linked sugars at low enzyme concentrations is restricted to GlcNAcβ1-2Man linkages except when the Man-α1-6 arm is substituted with a GlcNAc at both C-2 and C-6 positions, or the Man β-linked to the chitobiose core is substituted at the C-4 position by a bisecting GlcNAc (7Yamashita K. Ohkura T. Yoshima H. Kobata A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 100: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This limited activity can be a useful tool in the sequencing of oligosaccharides, giving specific structural information about the cleaved bond and the surrounding sugar residues. It also raises the issue of defining the intrinsic properties of the enzyme that govern this phenomenon. The aim of this study was to use an expression cloning strategy to obtain the gene for β- N-acetylglucosaminidase and to investigate the interaction between the enzyme and its N-linked carbohydrate substrates at the molecular level. By the expression of truncated portions of the β- N-acetylglucosaminidase gene, we have been able to examine defined regions of the protein that determine glycosidase specificity.

A limited trypsin digest of β- N-acetylglucosaminidase followed by amino-terminal amino acid sequencing was used to obtain two tryptic peptide sequences, a major sequence, EGADIPIIGGMVA, and a minor sequence, LQPMAFND.

Clones were amplified and purified using the maxi-prep pZ523™ spin column plasmid purification kit (5 Prime ⟶ 3 Prime, Inc.). DNA was also purified using Magic Mini Preps (Promega). Southern transfer of DNA to nylon membranes (Hybond, Amersham Corp.) was made according to published methods (8Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar, 9Southern E. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 503-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (21469) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide probes designed from the amino acid sequence of the major tryptic peptide from the purified protein, GAA GG(T/A) GC(T/A) GAT AT(T/C) CC(A/T) AT(T/C) AT(T/C) GG(T/A) GG(T/A) ATG GT, were labeled with [γ-32P]dATP using polynucleotide kinase (8Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). After hybridization at 56°C overnight, filters were washed and subjected to radioautography. Nucleotide sequences were determined using the dideoxy chain termination method (10Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52653) Google Scholar) using the Sequenase DNA sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp. Cambridge BioScience, Cambridge, UK). Both strands of DNA were sequenced in their entirety by a combination of specific oligonucleotide primers and the transposon-facilitated DNA sequencing TN1000 nested set kit (Gold BioTechnology, Inc., St. Louis, MO). Sequence analysis was accomplished using MacVector and Assembly-Lign software (IBI, Cambridge, UK) and on-line NCBI data bases. Total RNA was prepared from S. pneumoniae using guanidinium thiocyanate (11Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63171) Google Scholar). RNA (10 μg) was separated on a denaturing formaldehyde agarose gel with RNA molecular sizing fragments ranging from 0.24 to 9.5 kb and Northern blotted. The nylon filter was probed with a 570-bp 32P-labeled BglII- EcoRI fragment used to rescreen the genomic library. The vector pGEX-3X (Pharmacia, Milton Keynes, UK) was digested with EcoRI and dephosphorylated. The inserts from clones pBStrH7, −8, and −17 were prepared by digestion with EcoRI and gel purification. The insert and vector were ligated overnight and transformed into NM554 E. coli by electroporation. Colonies were ampicillin-selected on LB/amp plates, and 20 were randomly chosen for analysis. Mini-prepped DNA was digested with EcoRI and separated on an agarose gel for verification of vector and insert sizes. The expression and purification were carried out according to published methods (12Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5046) Google Scholar). 50-ml cultures of E. coli transformed with pGEX clones were induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β- D-galactopyranoside (1 m M), and the cells were sonicated. Affinity beads were mixed with bacterial cell lysates for 2 h at 4°C and washed 3 times with buffer, and the fusion protein was eluted from the affinity beads by the addition of fresh 5 m M reduced glutathione. Where appropriate, factor Xa cleavage was conducted by incubating factor Xa (Denzyme, Aarhus, Denmark) at 1 mg/ml with beads coupled to fusion protein at room temperature overnight. Supernatants were assayed for enzyme activity after centrifuging the beads. Tritium-labeled biantennary, triantennary, tetraantennary, bisected-biantennary, and bisected-hybrid oligosaccharide alditols were obtained from Oxford GlycoSystems (Abingdon, UK). (GlcNAcβ1,4GlcNAc)3was obtained from a partial chitin hydrolysis, and a degalactosylated biantennary native oligosaccharide was purified from human asialotransferrin (13Butters T.D. Scudder P. Rotsaert J. Petursson S. Fleet G.W.J. Willenbrock F.W. Jacob G.S. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Native oligosaccharide substrate was incubated at different concentrations (0.2-1.0 m M) with 2.5 milliunits/ml of wild-type or recombinant β- N-acetylglucosaminidase in 50 m M citric acid/sodium phosphate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 37°C for 1 h. The reactants were desalted, and hydrolysis was monitored by Dionex HPAEC (Dionex BioLC system) using a CarboPac PA-1 column eluted at 1 ml/min with 150 m M NaOH, 30 m M NaOAc, and the reaction products were detected using triple-pulsed amperometric detection with the following pulse potentials and durations: E1= 0.01 V (t1= 120 ms), E2= 0.6 V (t2= 120 ms), and E3= −0.93 V (t3= 130 ms). The extent of hydrolysis was calculated from empirically derived response factors for substrate and reaction products, and the data were plotted using a weighted nonlinear regression analysis (Multifit 2.0, Day Computing, Cambridge, UK). Radiolabeled oligosaccharide alditols were separated using an isocratic eluant of 200 m M NaOH and the fractions taken for radioactivity determination by scintillation counting. Bio-Gel P-4 chromatography (Oxford GlycoSystems) was also used to separate the reaction products after enzyme digestion, and the radioactivity in each fraction was determined as above. An expression cloning strategy was adapted from published procedures (14Robbins P.W. Overbye K. Albright C. Benfield B. Pero J. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 111: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) to obtain the gene encoding S. pneumoniae β- N-acetylglucosaminidase. A S. pneumoniae expression library of 5 × 106 primary recombinants, generated in the vector λ-ZapII (Stratagene), was amplified in the E. coli host strain XL1-blue, and 300,000 clones were screened for β- N-acetylglucosaminidase activity using the substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl N-acetylglucosaminide (4-MU-GlcNAc). 32 positive clones were identified by fluorescent halos encircling each plaque when visualized under 366-nm ultraviolet light. Hydrolysis was confirmed to be specific for N-acetylglucosaminide by the inclusion of a control substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl xyloside in the screening protocol. No hydrolysis of this substrate was seen. From the group of positive clones, 20 were selected at random and subcloned into pBluescript plasmids via in vivo excision according to the manufacturer's procedures and analyzed by restriction digestion to determine the sizes of the genomic DNA inserts. Restriction-digested DNA of the four largest inserts ranging in size from 1584 to 2504 bp were Southern blotted and probed with a degenerate 32P-labeled oligonucleotide designed from the amino acid sequence of the major tryptic peptide (Fig. 1). Hybridization of the radiolabeled probe to each clone selected by the enzyme activity of its translated product confirmed that they encoded the same protein that had been biochemical purified from the S. pneumoniae cells (Fig. 1). These clones (Fig. 2 a) were nucleotide sequenced and were found to compose a 2.7-kb continuous open reading frame with no start or stop codons, indicating that further screening of the genomic library was required to locate the missing gene sequences. 32P-Labeled DNA probes from the 5′ and 3′ ends of this 2.7-kb partial gene were used to identify two clones that contained the 5′ and 3′ ends of the strH gene (Fig. 2 b). Complete sequence analysis of these three contiguous clones revealed a single, continuous open reading frame of 3933 bp designated strH (str, streptococcus; H, hexosaminidase) (Fig. 3). The ATG (methionine) start codon, designated +1, was identified by the positions of three consensus sequences: the AGGAGG Shine-Dalgarno ribosome binding sequence located 7 bases upstream from the ATG translation initiation codon, and the two putative promoter sequences TTGACT resembling a “[minus]35” transcription initiation sequence beginning at −87 and TATAAT “[minus]10” transcription initiation sequence beginning at −43. The ochre stop codon located at base 3934 was followed by a hairpin-loop sequence resembling a rho independent transcription termination sequence.FIG. 2Alignment of overlapping clones. a, the clones, selected by screening for β- N-acetylglucosaminidase activity, were sequenced and aligned using MacVector and Assembly-lign software.

Both tryptic peptide sequences obtained from a purified preparation of β- N-acetylglucosaminidase were found (Fig. 3), and a comparison with all other published sequences in computer data bases did not reveal significant homology, confirming that the strH gene was unique. However, two amino acid sequence motifs common to other Gram-positive surface proteins were discovered (15Goward C.R. Scawen M.D. Murphy J.P. Atkinson T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 136-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The first was a putative secretion signal peptide at the amino terminus revealed by Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity analysis (Fig. 4 a). This sequence motif is characterized by a positively charged amino terminus followed by a hydrophobic core and a string of polar residues (16Abrahamsen L. Moks T. Nilsson B. Hellman U. Uhlen M. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3901-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The proposed cleavage site of this signal peptide is between the two alanine residues at sites 33 and 34 in strH between the hydrophobic core region and the polar residues (17von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 173: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Within this region is a KQQRFSIRKXXXGAASLIG consensus sequence that appears to be highly conserved in many of the cell surface proteins of Streptococcus and Staphylococcus (Table I). The carboxyl terminus contained a sequence homologous to a membrane spanning/cell wall anchorage sorting signal found in more than 20 Gram-positive surface proteins to date (18Schneewind O. Model P. Fischetti V.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 267-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) (Table I), identified by the consensus amino acid sequence LPXTGX where LPT and G are the conserved amino acids. In the translated sequence, we obtained LPETGT, followed by a hydrophobic stretch of amino acids proposed to be the membrane spanning region, and a short charged tail (Fig. 4 b). The LPETGT sequence is directly preceded by two lysine residues that may be of importance in anchoring the enzyme to the cell wall. It has been suggested (18Schneewind O. Model P. Fischetti V.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 267-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) that the two lysines preceding the LPXTGX motif of protein A may be covalently attached via a transpeptide linkage to the peptidoglycan of the cell wall of Staphylococcus aureus. The authors based this proposal on the finding that the murein of the peptidoglycan in E. coli is covalently attached to lipoprotein via lysine and arginine residues (19Braun V. Sieglin U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 13: 336-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Another striking feature found within the amino acid sequence of the β- N-acetylglucosaminidase is a tandem repeat of approximately 335 amino acids from site 180 to 522 and again between sites 625 and 956. This repeat is apparent in both nucleotide sequence and amino acid sequence self-alignments, although greater homology is conserved when comparing the amino acid sequences than is found between the nucleotide sequences in these repeat regions. Within each of these tandem repeat regions lies a sequence spanning 30 amino acids which, when compared to each other, are 67% identical and 93% similar when considering conservative amino acid substitutions. Interestingly, both of these 30 amino acid sequences have considerable homology to protein sequences found in six other hexosaminidases isolated from a wide variety of species including bacteria and humans (Table II).Table I:Aligned consensus sequences at the amino and carboxy termini of proteins from Streptococcus and Staphylococcus speciesTable I:Aligned consensus sequences at the amino and carboxy termini of proteins from Streptococcus and Staphylococcus speciesβ-GlcNAc′ase is the abbreviation for β- N-acetylglucosaminidase.

A total RNA preparation from S. pneumoniae was used to identify the transcript of β- N-acetylglucosaminidase. A major band hybridizing at 4.0 kb (results not shown) was consistent with the size of the 4.0-kb DNA obtained from sequencing. Clones pBStrH8 and −17, as expected, showed arylglycoside hydrolytic activity, but to determine that these had the same activity as wild type β- N-acetylglucosaminidase using a native biantennary N-glycan, they were subcloned into the pGEX-3X expression vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) for the high-level production of recombinant enzyme. The Km and Vmax values were determined for the two recombinant enzymes from clones pGXStrH17, the longest clone, and pGXStrH8, the most truncated clone. Wild-type enzyme demonstrated the highest affinity for the natural oligosaccharide with a Km of 132 μM compared with the Km values of the smaller length enzymes from clones pGXStrH17 and pGXStrH8, which were 2-2.5 times greater (Table III). The rates of hydrolysis, however, followed an opposite trend, where the Vmax measured for the smallest enzyme clone pGXStrH8, was 4 times faster than the wild-type enzyme and 3 times faster than the largest recombinant enzyme from clone pGXStrH17.Table III:Kinetic analysis of wild-type and recombinant S. pneumoniae β-N-acetylglucosaminidaseA desialylated, degalactosylated biantennary glycan was incubated with recombinant enzymes from clone pGXStr8 and −17, the corresponding factor Xa-cleaved enzyme, StrH8 and −17 or wild-type β- N-acetylglucosaminidase. Kinetic measurements were made as described in the text. The length of the pGX constructs includes 232 amino acids from the 26-kDa glutathione S-transferase fusion protein tag. A desialylated, degalactosylated biantennary glycan was incubated with recombinant enzymes from clone pGXStr8 and −17, the corresponding factor Xa-cleaved enzyme, StrH8 and −17 or wild-type β- N-acetylglucosaminidase. Kinetic measurements were made as described in the text. The length of the pGX constructs includes 232 amino acids from the 26-kDa glutathione S-transferase fusion protein tag. The Km and Vmax was also determined for the factor Xa cleaved enzymes from clones pGXStrH8 and pGXStrH17 (Table III). The Km of the fusion protein, from clone pGXStrH17, and the Xa-cleaved enzyme, StrH17, were very similar. By contrast, the Km values of the clone pGXStrH8 and StrH8 recombinant enzymes differed by a factor of two. However, the standard error of the Km of the StrH8 enzyme was quite large (Table III). Affinity-purified fusion proteins were assayed for their ability to hydrolyze a panel of radiolabeled oligosaccharide alditol substrates to compare aglycon specificity with the wild-type purified β- N-acetylglucosaminidase (Fig. 5). The reaction products from enzyme digestions were separated by HPAEC. Because this technique shows a shift in retention times between the substrate and hydrolysis product indicating cleavage has occurred, the structures of hydrolysis products were verified using Bio-Gel P-4 analysis, which gave actual sizes of the reaction products in glucose units. The minimum enzyme concentration (units/ml, using 4-MU-GlcNAc) for each enzyme that was chosen showed no hydrolysis of (GlcNAcβ1-4GlcNAc)3 and thus retained exclusive β1-2 GlcNAc hydrolysis. Recombinant pGXStrH8 enzyme, from the most truncated clone, at 0.025 units/ml and wild-type β- N-acetylglucosaminidase at 0.012 units/ml, hydrolyzed the biantennary alditol to completion (Fig. 5 a). Only the β1-2-linked GlcNAc residues were removed from a triantennary glycan (Fig. 5 b). However, only partial hydrolysis of a tetraantennary alditol was observed using the recombinant pGXStrH8 enzyme compared with wild-type enzyme (Fig. 5 c), and no GlcNAcs were removed from either bisected-biantennary or bisected-hybrid oligosaccharide substrates (Figs. 5, d and e). Concentrations of 0.25 units/ml of recombinant pGXStrH8 enzyme were required to hydrolyze completely the susceptible β1-2-linked GlcNAc of tetraantennary structures, but even at 45 units/ml, bisected oligosaccharides remained refractory to digestion. By contrast, the recombinant enzymes from the longest and intermediate clones pGXStrH17 and pGXStrH7, respectively, at low concentrations (0.025 units/ml) showed the same specificity as the wild-type enzyme, but only partially hydrolyzed those oligosaccharides with a bisecting GlcNAc. At a concentration of 1.5 units/ml, recombinant enzyme from pGXStrH17 exhibited the same activity as the wild-type enzyme when assayed using both bisected-biantennary and bisected-hybrid substrates. At higher enzyme concentrations (5 units/ml), this recombinant enzyme removed both terminal GlcNAc residues and the bisecting GlcNAc from bisected-biantennary substrates, an activity also achievable at high concentrations (0.1 units/ml) of the wild-type enzyme. The recombinant enzyme from clone pGXStrH7 exhibited partial activity against the bisected substrates at the highest enzyme concentration tested (17 units/ml). Thus the recombinant enzyme with the greatest number of amino acids, pGXStrH17 (Fig. 2, 1067 amino acids including the fusion tag, see Table III) shared the same aglycon specificity as the wild-type β- N-acetylglucosaminidase, whereas the smallest length clone, pGXStrH8 (612 amino acids, Table III) was completely unable to hydrolyze β1-2-linked GlcNAc residues from bisected oligosaccharide alditols at extremely high enzyme concentrations (the maximum tested was 120 units/ml of factor Xa-cleaved enzyme). The intermediate length clone pGXStrH7 (641 amino acids, see Fig. 2) was partially active in hydrolyzing bisected substrates. A summary of these results is shown in Fig. 6.FIG. 6Oligosaccharide structures hydrolyzed by S. pneumoniae β- N-acetylglucosaminidase. A summary of the data presented on the aglycon specificity of wild-type and recombinant β- N-acetylglucosaminidase.

N, GlcNAc; M, Man.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Recombinant enzymes that had the glutathione S-transferase fusion tag removed by cleavage with factor Xa were checked for activity against the five substrates used in Fig. 5 to confirm that the fusion tag did not affect the activity of the recombinant fusion proteins assayed above. At the same enzyme concentration, the factor Xa-cleaved recombinant enzymes showed identical aglycon specificities to the uncleaved enzymes (results not shown), demonstrating that the fusion tag did not change the substrate specificity of the recombinant enzymes. The peculiar aglycon specificity exhibited by β- N-acetylglucosaminidase from S. pneumoniae not only makes it a useful tool for oligosaccharide sequencing, it also makes it an interesting candidate for the investigation of substrate-enzyme interactions. At low enzyme concentrations, this enzyme will only hydrolyze β1-2-linked GlcNAc residues and is restricted by further N-acetylglucosaminidase substitutions of the α1-6 mannose arm of N-glycans and by bisecting GlcNAc residues of the core mannose. Little is known about the factors that might govern this restricted activity, though it might partly be explained by the potential steric hindrance created by the flexibility of 1-6-linked sugars, which have the additional ω angle of rotation. However, because these restricted β1-2-linkages are cleaved by higher concentrations of β- N-acetylglucosaminidase as well as by other hexosaminidases, the intrinsic properties of the enzyme itself, which correlate with this narrow substrate specificity, remain to be clearly defined. In this paper we have shown that S. pneumoniae β- N-acetylglucosaminidase is encoded by a unique 3933-bp gene, strH, which terminates in an ochre stop codon and possesses typical Gram-positive bacterial transcription initiation and termination sequences. The computer-translated amino acid sequence revealed two consensus motifs at both the amino and carboxyl terminus that are common to other Gram-positive surface proteins. A tandem repeat was identified in the strH gene, and within each repeat lies a stretch of 30 amino acids homologous to sequences in six other hexosaminidases found in a wide variety of species, suggesting that perhaps these amino acids may be important for the catalytic function of the enzyme. The tandem repeat regions of protein may be correlated with the ability of the clones to hydrolyze substrate. Substrate specificity experiments revealed that the longest enzyme clone, pGXStrH17, was able to hydrolyze β1-2-linked GlcNAc residues of bisected oligosaccharides similar to the wild-type enzyme. The intermediate sized cloned enzyme from pGXStrH7 demonstrated only a partial ability to hydrolyze these substrates, whereas the enzyme from shortest clone, pGXStrH8, was completely deficient in this activity. At the protein level, the differences between these clones are clearly defined by the presence or absence of the second tandem repeat region. Recombinant enzyme from pGXStrH17 contains both tandem repeats; pGXStrH7 contains all of the first and 95 amino acids (of 330) of the second tandem repeat region; and pGXStrH8 contains only the first tandem repeat. Sequence alignment revealed that these tandem repeat regions each contain a 30-amino acid consensus sequence present in six other hexosaminidases from divergent species, which leads us to speculate that this region may be part of an extended site of the enzyme, which is required for substrate orientation around the active site. In situations where this portion is partially missing, as with the shortest clone, efficient association with the some substrates may be affected and hydrolysis impaired. Further insights into the function of these tandem repeat regions may be gained by the separate expression of the second tandem repeat region followed by experiments addressing the substrate specificity. However, it is noteworthy that expression cloning failed to identify a clone that only contained the second repeat region and possibly indicates that the presence of this domain alone is not sufficient to maintain catalytic activity. The weaker affinity and increased rate of hydrolysis of biantennary oligosaccharides, together with changes in aglycon specificity, correlate with an amino acid-specific extension of the polypeptide carboxyl terminus. This suggests that there is either a minimum amino acid residue requirement for active site conformation, or a requirement for protein domains outside the active site to recognize and direct substrates into the enzymes catalytic center. A better understanding of the cellular location of the Streptococcal β- N-acetylglucosaminidase can be derived from the sequence information of the gene. The identification of a characteristic Streptococcal secretion signal at the amino terminus and a carboxyl-terminal sorting motif found in a variety of Gram-positive cell-surface proteins predicts a membrane-bound enzyme with an active site extending into the extracellular space. This structural model explains the origin of the β- N-acetylglucosaminidase purified from the media. Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that this form of the enzyme originates from the cell surface and is released during protease-assisted autolysis. First, the cell-associated enzyme was found to be present in much greater quantities than the enzyme found in the medium over an 8-h growth period (3Clarke V.A. Willenbrock F.W. Scudder P. Rotsaert J. Jacob G.S. Butters T.D. Int. J. Biochrom. 1994; 1: 151-158Google Scholar). Purification of the wild-type enzyme from Streptococcal cells revealed multiple amino termini, and the presence of a number of isoforms when examined by native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (3Clarke V.A. Willenbrock F.W. Scudder P. Rotsaert J. Jacob G.S. Butters T.D. Int. J. Biochrom. 1994; 1: 151-158Google Scholar). The major protein and activity stained band of this preparation analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis migrates with a molecular mass of 120 kDa, 24 kDa smaller than the 144-kDa translated gene, providing further evidence that proteolysis, additional to signal peptide cleavage, occurs during the release of the cell-associated enzyme. Second, only a single gene was obtained from expression cloning. If more than one β- N-acetylglucosaminidase was expressed by this organism, then more than one gene might have been isolated by enzyme activity. Although 32 clones were selected by their β- N-acetylglucosaminidase activity, further analysis of five of these selected at random revealed that they were overlapping fragments of the same gene. This evidence, together with the substrate specificity data (3Clarke V.A. Willenbrock F.W. Scudder P. Rotsaert J. Jacob G.S. Butters T.D. Int. J. Biochrom. 1994; 1: 151-158Google Scholar), implies with great certainty that both forms of the β- N-acetylglucosaminidase are derived from the same protein located at the cell-surface. The contribution to substrate configuration made by amino acid residues outside the active site in glycohydrolytic enzymes is a largely unexplored phenomenon. The availability of truncated enzymes that have altered substrate specificities as described here provides a unique opportunity to study the mechanism by which glycosidases bind and hydrolyze complex oligosaccharides.

The activity of the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase-1 (PP-1c) 1The abbreviations used are:PP-1ccatalytic subunit of protein phosphatase-1DARPP-32dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein, Mr= 32,000TBAPtetrabutyl ammonium phosphatePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyNTCB2-nitro-5-thiocyanobenzoic aciddCTPαS2′-deoxycytosine 5′- O-(1-thiotriphosphate). is under the control of several inhibitory proteins that are regulated by phosphorylation (reviewed in Ref. 1Shenolikar S. Nairn A.C. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1991; 23: 1-121PubMed Google Scholar). Among these, DARPP-32 (dopamine- and c AMP- regulated phospho protein, Mr= 32,000 on SDS-PAGE) and inhibitor-1 become potent inhibitors of PP-1c when they are phosphorylated on threonine by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The two proteins display a high degree of sequence homology in their amino-terminal part, but differ in their carboxyl terminus (2Williams K.R. Hemmings Jr., H.C. LoPresti M.B. Konigsberg W.H. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1890-1903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DARPP-32 is highly enriched in specific cell populations (reviewed in Ref. 3Girault J.-A. Neurochem. Int. 1993; 23: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), whereas inhibitor-1 has a more widespread distribution (4Hemmings Jr., H.C. Girault J.-A. Nairn A.C. Bertuzzi G. Greengard P. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 1053-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). During development, DARPP-32 is expressed only at a differentiated stage of these cell populations, whereas inhibitor-1 is maximally expressed in the embryo and shortly after birth (4Hemmings Jr., H.C. Girault J.-A. Nairn A.C. Bertuzzi G. Greengard P. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 1053-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 5Sakagami H. Ebina K. Kondo H. Mol.

Brain Res. 1990; 54: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A striking feature of DARPP-32 expression is its correlation with that of the dopamine D1 receptor (7Ouimet C.C. Miller P.E. Hemmings Jr., H.C. Walaas S.I. Greengard P. J. Neurosci. 1984; 4: 111-124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it has been shown that its state of phosphorylation is regulated by dopamine in striatonigral neurons (8Walaas S.I. Aswad D.W. Greengard P. Nature. 1983; 301: 69-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase-1 dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein, Mr= 32,000 tetrabutyl ammonium phosphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis high performance liquid chromatography 2-nitro-5-thiocyanobenzoic acid 2′-deoxycytosine 5′- O-(1-thiotriphosphate). In striatonigral neurons, DARPP-32 is phosphorylated under basal conditions on serine by casein kinase II, whereas inhibitor-1 is not a substrate for this kinase (9Girault J.-A. Hemmings Jr., H.C. Zorn S.H. Gustafson E.L. Greengard P. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 1772-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 10Girault J.-A. Hemmings Jr., H.C. Williams K.R. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21748-21759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, phosphorylation by casein kinase II accounts only in part for the phosphorylation of DARPP-32 on serine in the striatum. The other major site of in vivo phosphorylation of rat DARPP-32 is located in a very acidic peptide on thermolytic maps (10Girault J.-A. Hemmings Jr., H.C. Williams K.R. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21748-21759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the rat DARPP-32 sequence contains a stretch of 18 acidic amino acids followed by a serine at position 137, which provides a casein kinase I consensus site, we have suggested previously that DARPP-32 might be a substrate for casein kinase I (10Girault J.-A. Hemmings Jr., H.C. Williams K.R. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21748-21759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Casein kinase I is a highly conserved protein kinase, identified in yeast, plants, and mammals (11Robinson L.C. Hubbard E.J.A. Graves P.R. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Roach P.J. Kung C. Haas D.W.

It is a ubiquitous enzyme which can be found in the nucleus and the cytosol and bound to the cytoskeleton or to the membrane (13Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1991; 23: 123-164PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro, membrane-bound casein kinase I can be inhibited by exogenous phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (14Brockman J.L. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2508-2512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but this effect, which is the only form of regulation observed so far, may not be physiological (15Chauhan V.P.S. Singh S.S. Chauhan A. Brockerhoff H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1177: 318-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Thus, very little is known about the modulation of casein kinase I activity in vivo. Moreover, very few substrates have been shown to be phosphorylated by casein kinase I in intact cells, and substrates of this kinase remain to be identified in neurons, where casein kinase I has been shown to be tightly bound to neurofilaments (16Link W.T. Dosemeci A. Floyd C.C. Pant H.C. Neurosci. Lett. 1993; 151: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 17Floyd C.C. Grant P. Gallant P.E. Pant H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4987-4994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we show that DARPP-32 is an excellent substrate for casein kinase I and that one of the two serines phosphorylated in vitro is also phosphorylated in intact cells. In addition, phosphorylation of this serine induces an unusual shift in migration of the protein on SDS-PAGE, allowing the easy assessment of casein kinase I activity in intact cells. Recombinant rat DARPP-32 was produced in Escherichia coli and purified as previously described (18Neyroz P. Desdouits F. Benfenati F. Knutson J.R. Greengard P. Girault J.-A. J. Biol.

PP-1c was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle (22McGowan C.H. Cohen P. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 416-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Phosphorylase a was prepared as previously described (22McGowan C.H. Cohen P. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 416-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Rats were purchased from Charles River France, [γ32P]ATP from DuPont NEN, acrylamide from National Diagnostic, thin layer chromatography cellulose sheets from Eastman Kodak Co., thermolysin and dithiothreithol from Calbiochem, CKI-7 from Seikagaku America Inc., nitrocellulose membranes (0.2-μm pore size) from Schleicher & Schuell, and autoradiographic films from Kodak and Amersham Corp. Site-directed mutagenesis of the single-stranded form of an M13 phage containing the sense full-length rat DARPP-32 cDNA sequence was carried out with a commercially available kit (Amersham) based on the method of Eckstein and colleagues (23Taylor J.W. Ott J. Eckstein F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 8765-8785Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 33-nucleotide long antisense oligonucleotide (GACGAAGAAGAAGACGCCCAGGCGGAGGTCCTG) was used to prime cDNA synthesis. It matched the sequence of rat DARPP-32 cDNA with the exception of two base replacements, underlined in the sequence, corresponding to a single amino acid substitution from serine (AGC) to alanine (GCC). The second strand of DNA was synthesized with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase, in the presence of dCTPαS, and ligated with T4 DNA ligase. Double-stranded DNA was purified by filtration on nitrocellulose and incubated with NciI, a restriction enzyme that recognizes a unique site (CCCGG) in the heteroduplex, but cannot cut the phosphorothioate-containing strand. The nicked heteroduplex was digested by exonuclease III and repolymerized by polymerase I. TG1 bacteria were transformed with the resulting double-stranded DNA. Successful mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The buffer used for phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase contained 50 m M HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 m M magnesium acetate, and 1 m M EGTA. The buffers used for phosphorylation by casein kinases I and II contained 50 m M Tris-HCl, pH 7.1, 10 m M magnesium acetate, and 100 or 150 m M KCl, respectively. All phosphorylation reactions were carried out at 30°C using an ATP concentration of 100 μM, except for the stoichiometric phosphorylation of DARPP-32, where it was 150 μM. Phosphoproteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (13 or 15% acrylamide, w/v) (10Girault J.-A. Hemmings Jr., H.C. Williams K.R. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21748-21759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were loaded on gels in “stop solution” (3% SDS (w/v), 62 m M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% glycerol (v/v), 0.3 Mβ-mercaptoethanol, and traces of pyronine Y and bromphenol blue). Study of the time course of phosphorylation of recombinant rat DARPP-32, bovine DARPP-32 and inhibitor-1 were carried out in a final volume of 400 μl containing 40 μg of substrate and 10 ng of casein kinase I. Aliquots were removed at various times, mixed with stop solution, boiled for 2 min, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Experiments to determine the kinetic constants of the phosphorylation of DARPP-32 by casein kinase I were as described elsewhere (10Girault J.-A. Hemmings Jr., H.C. Williams K.R. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21748-21759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In initial rate conditions, phosphorylation was linear with time and corresponded to incorporation of phosphate into less than 10% of the substrate. Three hundred μg of DARPP-32 or S137A-DARPP-32 were phosphorylated with 150 μM [γ32P]ATP (specific activity, 950 cpm/pmol) and 4 μg of casein kinase I in a final volume of 1 ml, for 90 min, at 30°C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 500 μl of acetic acid. ATP was removed by anion exchange chromatography on a Dowex AG1-X8 column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in 30% acetic acid (v/v) (10Girault J.-A. Hemmings Jr., H.C. Williams K.R. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21748-21759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The eluted proteins were lyophilized and resuspended in 150 μl of 1 M ammonium carbonate. After adding 50 μl of 8 M urea and 50 μl of 100 m M dithiothreitol, samples were kept at 50°C for 15 min, then 750 μl of water and 30 μg of trypsin were added. Reactions were carried out at 37°C for 36 h. The reaction mixtures were kept at −20°C until they were injected on reverse phase HPLC. HPLC was performed on a Vydac C18 column (25 cm × 2.1 mm) which had been equilibrated at a flow rate of 1 ml/min in 5 m M tetrabutyl ammonium phosphate (TBAP), pH 5.4. Peptides were eluted with linear gradients of increasing concentrations of acetonitrile in the presence of 5 m M TBAP: 0-35% acetonitrile (5-10 min), 35-70% acetonitrile (10-50 min). Radioactivity of the eluate was monitored on line. Fractions were collected, every 30 s, in polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes, and dried before Cerenkov radiation was measured. Peak fractions, with the exception of peak 10, were resuspended in 400 μl of water and subjected to a second purification on the same column equilibrated at a flow rate of 1 ml/min in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The peptides were eluted with increasing concentrations of acetonitrile in the presence of 0.075% trifluoroacetic acid: 0-14% acetonitrile (1-3 min), 14-49% acetonitrile (3-20 min), 49-70% acetonitrile (20-25 min). The large peak 10 was resuspended in 400 μl of 25 m M ammonium carbonate. Two hundred μl of this sample were incubated with 10 μg of thermolysin, overnight, at 37°C. Phosphopeptides were then purified by reversed phase HPLC in TBAP buffer as described above. Before sequencing of the peptides, phosphoserine was chemically converted to S-ethylcysteine (24Meyer H.E. Hoffman-Posorske E. Korte H. Heilmeyer L.M. FEBS Lett. 1986; 204: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Dried samples were resuspended, under nitrogen, in 50 μl of a mixture containing 60 μl of 10 M ethanethiol, 200 μl of water, 200 μl of dimethylsulfoxide, 80 μl of ethanol, and 65 μl of 5 M NaOH. After incubation for 1 h at 50°C, samples were cooled to room temperature and 10 μl of acetic acid were added. For studying DARPP-32 mobility shift, rapidly dissected substantia nigra was incubated at 30°C, in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (25Siciliano J.C. Menegoz M. Chamak B. Girault J.-A. Neuroprotocols. 1992; 1: 185-192Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar), for 0, 10, 20, or 30 min and frozen in liquid nitrogen. For estimation of the stoichiometry of phosphorylation by casein kinase I in vivo, striata and substantia nigra of four rats were rapidly dissected and directly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissues were homogenized in boiling 1% SDS in water (w/v) by sonication and subjected to SDS-PAGE. DARPP-32 in striatum and substantia nigra was analyzed by immunoblotting with a mixture of two monoclonal antibodies (C24-5a and C24-6a), as previously described (26Hemmings Jr., H.C. Greengard P. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 1469-1481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except that a horseradish peroxidase-coupled donkey-anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody was used and that immunoreactivity was detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence method (Amersham). The relative amounts of immunoreactive bands were quantified by computer-assisted densitometry measurement of the films. To analyze the phosphorylation of DARPP-32 in striatonigral neurons, prelabeling of striatal slices and immunoprecipitation of DARPP-32 were carried out as described elsewhere (10Girault J.-A. Hemmings Jr., H.C. Williams K.R. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21748-21759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two-dimensional thin layer phosphopeptide mapping and phosphoamino acid analysis of DARPP-32 and S137A-DARPP-32 were carried out as previously described (27Hemmings Jr., H.C. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14491-14497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2-Nitro-5-thiocyanobenzoic acid (NTCB) cleavage of phosphoproteins was carried out as described previously (10Girault J.-A. Hemmings Jr., H.C. Williams K.R. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21748-21759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that NTCB was dissolved by sonication. PP-1c inhibition was studied as described, using phosphorylase a as substrate (10Girault J.-A. Hemmings Jr., H.C. Williams K.R. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21748-21759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant DARPP-32 was phosphorylated efficiently by casein kinase I, whereas the rate of phosphorylation of inhibitor-1 was 8-fold lower (Fig. 1 A). Recombinant rat DARPP-32 was phosphorylated by casein kinase I with an apparent Km = 3.4 ± 0.3 μM (mean ± S.D., n = 3) (Fig. 1 B). The Vmax of phosphorylation ranged from 30 to 100 pmol/min/μg depending on enzyme batches, values which were approximately 10 times lower than that observed for casein. The stoichiometry of phosphorylation of recombinant DARPP-32 was approximately 2 mol of phosphate per mol of protein (Fig. 2 A), suggesting the existence of at least two sites of phosphorylation. When phosphorylated by casein kinase I, DARPP-32 migrated more rapidly on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 B). DARPP-32, phosphorylated to a low stoichiometry (e.g. ≈0.2 mol of phosphate/mol of DARPP-32, Fig. 3 A), appeared as a doublet of phosphoproteins on autoradiograms, suggesting that phosphorylation of one site, but not the other, could modify the migration of the protein. This shift in migration on SDS-PAGE was not observed in the presence of 4.6 M urea (not shown) or when DARPP-32 was phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase or casein kinase II (Fig. 3 A).FIG. 2Phosphorylation of recombinant DARPP-32 by casein kinase I shifts its electrophoretic mobility. A, stoichiometry of phosphorylation of DARPP-32 incubated with casein kinase I, in moles of phosphate incorporated per mol of DARPP-32. One mg of recombinant DARPP-32 was incubated with 10 μg of casein kinase I and 150 μM [γ32P]ATP, at 30°C for 4 h. After 2 h of incubation, 5 μg of kinase were added to the reaction mixture (arrow). At the indicated times, aliquots of the reaction mixture were removed and the incorporated radioactivity measured as described in the legend to Fig. 1. B, Coomassie Blue staining of the aliquots was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (15% (w/v) acrylamide, and 2.5 μg of DARPP-32 were loaded on each lane).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIG. 3Phosphorylation of DARPP-32 and S137A-DARPP-32. A, DARPP-32 was phosphorylated, in initial rate conditions, by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (lane 1), casein kinase II (lane 2), or casein kinase I (lane 3) using [γ32P]ATP. B, DARPP-32 (lanes 1 and 2) and S137A-DARPP-32 (lanes 3 and 4) were incubated in the absence (lanes 1 and 3) or the presence (lanes 2 and 4) of casein kinase I in conditions leading to a stoichiometry of phosphorylation of ≈2 mol of phosphate/mol of DARPP-32 (see Fig. 2). C, DARPP-32 phosphorylated by casein kinase I (lane 1), cAMP-dependent protein kinase (lane 3), or casein kinase II (lane 4) and S137A-DARPP-32 phosphorylated by casein kinase I (lane 2) were subjected to cysteine-specific cleavage by NTCB, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The position of amino-terminal (1-71) and carboxyl-terminal (72-205) fragments of the proteins are indicated. cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylates DARPP-32 on Thr-34 (1-71 fragment), and casein kinase II phosphorylates DARPP-32 on Ser-45 and Ser-102 (1-71 and 72-205 fragments, respectively).

Phosphoproteins (A, B, and C) were separated by SDS-PAGE (13% (A) or 15% (B and C) acrylamide, w/v) and analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining or autoradiography as indicated. Phosphoamino acids were separated by high voltage thin layer electrophoresis and detected by autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In several cases, casein kinase I phosphorylates serines located on the carboxyl-terminal side of a phosphoamino acid, usually phospho-Ser at position −3, a process called hierarchal phosphorylation (28Flotow H. Graves P.R. Wang A. Fiol C.J. Roeske R.W. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14264-14269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14139-14142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of DARPP-32 by casein kinase I was not enhanced by prior phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase or casein kinase II (not shown). Furthermore, recombinant DARPP-32 purified from E. coli, in an unphosphorylated form (not shown), was nevertheless an excellent substrate for casein kinase I. Thus it appears that casein kinase I is not dependent on hierarchal phosphorylation of DARPP-32. The effects of phosphorylation of DARPP-32 by casein kinase I on PP-1c inhibition were investigated. Phosphorylation of DARPP-32 by casein kinase I did not convert the protein into an inhibitor of PP-1c and the inhibitory activity of phospho-Thr-34-DARPP-32 was not altered by its phosphorylation by casein kinase I (not shown). In DARPP-32, the best consensus sequence for casein kinase I precedes Ser-137. S137A-DARPP-32 (in which Ser-137 was mutated to alanine) incubated with casein kinase I incorporated less phosphate than DARPP-32, and its migration on SDS-PAGE was not altered by phosphorylation (Fig. 3 B). When DARPP-32 was phosphorylated by casein kinase I to a low stoichiometry, it migrated as a doublet (Fig. 3 A), and the thermolytic maps of the lower band contained a major acidic peptide absent from the maps obtained from the upper band (Fig. 4, A and B). This acidic peptide was also absent from the maps of S137A-DARPP-32 phosphorylated by casein kinase I, demonstrating that it contained phospho-Ser-137 (Fig. 4 C). On the other hand, two basic peptides corresponding to additional phosphorylation site(s), were the major phosphopeptides in thermolytic maps of the upper band and S137A-DARPP-32 and minor ones in maps of the lower band. Taken together, these results demonstrate that phosphorylation of Ser-137 is responsible for the more rapid migration of DARPP-32 on SDS-PAGE. Since phosphorylation of S137A-DARPP-32 by casein kinase I was still significant, attempts to localize the other phosphorylated residue(s) were made. Phospho-DARPP-32 and phospho-S137A-DARPP-32 were chemically cleaved at the unique Cys-72 with NTCB into two peptides corresponding to residues 1-71 and 72-205, respectively. DARPP-32 and S137A-DARPP-32 were phosphorylated by casein kinase I almost exclusively on the 72-205 fragment (Fig. 3 C). Interestingly, the 72-205 fragment from DARPP-32 phosphorylated either by casein kinase I or by casein kinase II had the same electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 3 C). Phosphoamino acid analysis of DARPP-32 and S137A-DARPP-32 phosphorylated by casein kinase I revealed that the proteins were phosphorylated only on serine (Fig. 3 D). To demonstrate directly that Ser-137 was phosphorylated and to identify the other phosphorylated serine(s), we sequenced tryptic phosphopeptides obtained from DARPP-32 phosphorylated by casein kinase I. Tryptic peptides were resolved on reverse phase HPLC into about 10 phosphopeptides (Fig. 5 A). Seven of these phosphopeptides were sequenced successfully (Table I). The two major peaks (peptides 5 and 10) corresponded to phospho-Ser-189 and phospho-Ser-137, respectively. Ser-137 is located at the carboxyl-terminal end of a stretch of 18 acidic amino acids which is conserved among species (Table II). Surprisingly, the peptide containing phospho-Ser-137, which is very acidic and hydrophilic, was strongly retained on the C18column and eluted as a broad asymmetrical peak (Fig. 5 A). Moreover, the use of a mobile phase containing TBAP, at a pH ≈ 5.4, was required to purify this peptide since it was not eluted by 70% acetonitrile in standard acidic buffer containing 1% trifluoroacetic acid (not shown). The peptide containing phospho-Ser-189 was the major phosphopeptide from the tryptic digest of S137A-DARPP-32 (Fig. 5 B). Ser-189 is not conserved among species (Table II) and is not located in a typical casein kinase I consensus site (Table III). However, its phosphorylation was inhibited by CKI-7, a specific inhibitor of casein kinase I (30Chijiwa T. Hagiwara M. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4924-4927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Zhai L. Graves P.R. Longenecker K.L. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Roach P.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 944-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), with the same efficiency as that of Ser-137 (not shown), indicating that phosphorylation of this residue is attributable to bona fide casein kinase I and not to another protein kinase contaminating the enzyme preparation. A minor contribution of phosphorylation of Ser-18 was also detected (Table I, peptides 2 and 3), and a few minor peaks did not yield identifiable sequence (peptides 7, 8, and 9). However, the very low phosphorylation of the 1-71 NTCB fragment (Fig. 3 C) indicates that Ser-18 is, at best, a poor substrate for casein kinase I.Table I:Sequencing of tryptic phosphopeptides from DARPP-32 phosphorylated by casein kinase ITable I:Sequencing of tryptic phosphopeptides from DARPP-32 phosphorylated by casein kinase IPhosphopeptides obtained by tryptic cleavage of casein kinase I-phosphorylated DARPP-32 were sequenced as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The peptide numbers refer to the peaks in Fig. 5 A.

The genes for three of these low molecular weight basic nuclear proteins exist as a single linear array of PRM1, PRM2, and TNP2 on human chromosome 16p13.2. To begin to address the mechanism governing their transcriptional potentiation, a region of ∼40 kilobases of the human genome encompassing these genes was introduced into the germ line of mice. Fluorescence in situ hybridization and Southern analysis showed that this segment of the human genome integrated into independent chromosomal sites while maintaining its fidelity. Transcript analysis demonstrated that the expression of the endogenous mouse protamine Prm1 and Prm2 genes as well as the mouse transition protein Tnp2 gene were expressed along with their human transgene counterparts. The pattern of expression of these transgenic human genes within this multigenic cluster faithfully represented that observed in vivo. In addition, all members of this transgenic gene cluster were expressed in proportions similar to those in human testis. Copy number-dependent and position-independent expression of the transgenic construct demonstrated that the corresponding biological locus was contained within this segment of the human genome. Furthermore, DNase I sensitivity established that in sperm the human PRM1→ PRM2→ TNP2 genic domain was contained as an ∼28.5-kilobase contiguous segment bounded by an array of nuclear matrix associated topoisomerase II consensus sites.

Protamines are highly basic, sperm-specific nuclear proteins that are characterized by an arginine rich core segment (cf. Refs. 1Dixon G.H. Aiken J.M. Jankowski J.M. McKenzie D.I. Moir R. States J.C.

Deletion analysis has shown that the tissue-specific element(s) resides within a 113-bp segment, 5′ of the initiator codon of the Prm1 gene (15Zambrowicz B.P. Harendza C.J. Zimmerman J.W.

Reprod. 1994; 50: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Their significance remains to be assessed, since both testis-specific and ubiquitous protein factors bind to this segment. Although this directly addressed transcriptional regulation, the issue of how these linked genes are selected from the genome for expression remains. Our understanding of how a multigenic locus assumes a potentiated conformation, i.e. readied for expression, or how this state is maintained for transcription is limited to somatic cells. The concept that transcriptionally competent chromatin assumed an altered nuclear structure was validated when it was shown that the β-globin gene acquired a DNase I-sensitive conformation within cells in which it was expressed (17Weintraub H. Goudine M. Science. 1976; 193: 848-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar). These studies were extended to the chicken ovalbumin, x, y locus, which was one of the first chromatin domains containing a multigenic loci to be defined (18Lawson G.M. Knoll B.J. March C.J. Woo S.L.C. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1501-1507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The complete characterization of the β-globin locus has extended the concept of the genic domain as the primary regulatory unit to mammalian systems (19Smith R.D. Yu J. Annunziato A. Seale R.L. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 2970-2976Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 20Forrester W.C. Thompson C. Elder J.T. Groudine M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1359-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The subsequent identification of the LCR, i.e. locus control region (21Grosveld F. van Assendelft G.B. Greaves D.R. Kollias G. Cell. 1987; 51: 975-985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar), provided a key element requisite to understanding the mechanism of gene potentiation. In contrast to the well characterized in vivo and in vitro β-globin locus, our understanding of haploid expressed genic domains and how these genes, i.e. PRM1→ PRM2→ TNP2, assume a potentiated conformation is lacking. Significant progress toward understanding the underlying mechanism governing male germ cell gene expression has been hampered by the lack of a permanent spermatogenic cell line and the short life span of primary cells in culture. A coculture system using virus-transformed 15-p1 cells has been developed (22Rassoulzadegan M. Paquis-Flucklinger V. Bertina B. Sage J. Jasin M. Miyagawa K. van Heyningen V. Besmer P. Cuzin F. Cell. 1993; 75: 997-1006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), although it has yet to be widely adopted. This has left cell purification by separation or transgenic analysis as the only tools that can be used to address these issues within the differentiating sperm cell. To permit the dissection of the molecular potentiative mechanism that governs the expression of the male gamete a transgenic mouse model was constructed. A segment of human chromosome 16 harboring the PRM1→ PRM2→ TNP2 gene cluster (8Nelson J.E. Krawez S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2932-2936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Nelson J.E. Krawetz S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31067-31073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was introduced into fertilized mouse eggs. This 40,255-bp fragment contained sufficient information to faithfully express all of the members of this multigene family in a copy number-dependent, position-independent manner in the heterologous system. A DNase I-sensitive domain of ∼28.5 kb encompassing the h PRM1→h PRM2→h TNP2 gene cluster is bounded by an array of topoisomerase II consensus sites. These results establish that like somatic cells, the genes transcribed by the male gamete are organized at specific loci as functional domains. The role of organizing the male nucleus in this manner as a means of achieving first order control during male gametogenesis is discussed in the proposed model of haploid-specific gene determination. Mouse Cot-1 DNA and the Bio-Nick labeling system were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. CENTRI-SEP− spin columns were from Princeton Separations, and the biotin-FITC detection kit and PBD solution were purchased from Oncor. Positively charged Quiabrane− nylon membranes were purchased from Quiagen. Lyophilized bovine pancreatic DNase I (EC 3.1.21.1) was purchased from Amersham/USB. The mouse pTRI-β-actin probe was from Ambion. All other reagents were of ACS or molecular biology grade and purchased from sources described previously (23Svinarich D.M. Twomey T.A. Macauley S.P. Krebs C.J. Yang T.P. Krawetz S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14382-14387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 40,573-bp genomic DNA segment encompassing the human protamine PRM1 gene, PRM2 gene, and the transition protein TNP2 gene cluster from chromosome 16p13.2 was isolated and characterized (24Nelson J.E. Krawetz S.A. DNA Sequence. 1995; 5: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The corresponding 40,255-bp genomic fragment containing this human gene cluster was isolated by electroelution of the NotI restriction-digested hP3.1 cosmid DNA, then purified by DEAE-ion exchange chromatography. The purified DNA was then microinjected into the pronuclei of 20 C57BL/6 × SJL F2 hybrid recipient fertilized mouse eggs. Transgenic offspring were identified by slot blot analysis of mouse tail tip DNA using the human-specific TNP2 probe. Their identity was confirmed by gene fingerprint analysis. Transgene copy number was determined using concentration standardized mouse tail tip DNAs isolated essentially as described (25Hogan B. Constantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986: 174-175Google Scholar). Mouse tail tip DNAs and cosmid hP3.1 DNA were digested to completion with EcoRI. Equal genomic equivalents of the various transgenic mouse genomic DNAs and cosmid DNA were electrophoretically resolved then transferred onto positively charged nylon membranes. The membranes were then prehybridized in the hybridization solution of 5 × SSPE containing 0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.1% Ficoll 400, 50% formamide, 1% SDS, 0.1 mg/ml yeast tRNA, plus 1.25% polyethylene glycol 8000 for at least 1 h at 42°C. The membranes were then hybridized overnight at 42°C in fresh hybridization solution that contained 106cpm/ml of each individual [α-32P]dCTP-radiolabeled probe. The human PRM1 probe (3F1), PRM2 probes (7D9 plus 8B5), and the TNP2 probe (7F8) were purified from pTZ18R-subcloned fragments of cosmid hP3.1. They encompass nucleotide positions 14,637-15,802, 19,556-20,003, 19,635-20,164, and 26,736-27,307, respectively. Following hybridization, the membranes were washed for 30 min at room temperature in 2 × SSPE with 0.1% SDS, then for 30 min at 65°C in 0.1 × SSPE with 0.1% SDS, prior to autoradiography for 7 days at −70°C. Copy number was then determined utilizing cosmid hP3.1 as the Whole Band Analysis copy number calibration standard, as described (26Sellos D. Krawetz S.A. Dixon G.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Primary cell cultures were established as explants from either mouse tail tissue or muscle tissue (27Freshney R.I. Culture of Animal Cells: A Manual of Basic Techniques. Alan R. Liss, New York1987: 113-115Google Scholar). The cells were grown in α-minimal essential medium, Earles' salts, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 m M glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycinin in Corning T-25 flasks. Cells were then harvested and metaphase chromosomal spreads prepared (28Beisel J. Mouer F. Priest J.H. Barch M. The ACT Cytogenetics Laboratory Manual. Raven Press, New York1991: 183-184Google Scholar). To permit chromosomal assignment of the integrated human loci and karyotype analysis, the transgenic mouse chromosomes were QFQ-banded (29Lin C.C. van de Sande H. Smicnk W.K. Newton D.R. Can. J. Genet. Cytol. 1975; 17: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) prior to FISH analysis. Approximately 1 μg of the purified 40,255-bp NotI-digested fragment from cosmid hP3.1 was labeled with biotin-14-dATP by nick translation using the Bio-Nick labeling system as recommended by the manufacturer. After incubation for 1 h at room temperature, the reaction was terminated. Unincorporated nucleotides were then separated from the labeled DNA using CENTRI-SEP− spin columns. The eluted biotinylated DNA probe was then brought to a final volume of 100 μl with TE for storage at −20°C. The slides containing the various preparations of transgenic metaphase chromosomes were prewarmed in 2 × SSPE at 60°C for 10 min. After warming, the slides were denatured in a solution of 2 × SSPE containing 70% formamide at 70°C for 2 min. They were then dehydrated through a series of graded −20°C ethanol washes of 70%, 80% then 95%, then air dried. After drying, 50 μl of the hybridization solution containing 100 ng of the heat-denatured biotinylated hP3.1 probe containing 2.5 ng of nonspecific sequence competitor mouse Cot-1 DNA was applied to each slide. The slides were coverslipped and sealed with rubber cement, then incubated at 37°C overnight in a moisture retentive chamber. Subsequent to hybridization, the slides were washed in 2 × SSPE at 72°C for 5 min, followed by a 5-min wash in 1 × PBD solution at room temperature. Hybridization products were then detected using biotin-FITC, and the chromosomes were counterstained with propidium iodide. Chromosomes were viewed with an Axioskop fluorescence microscope using a Zeiss wide-pass FITC filter and 50-watt mercury vapor bulb. Assignment of each integrant to its respective chromosome was determined as a function of coincident QFQ banding. Total RNA was isolated using the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (30Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63191) Google Scholar), and then equal amounts of each sample were fractionated on a 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel (31Lehrach H. Diamond D. Wozney J. Boedtker H. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4743-4751Crossref PubMed Scopus (2402) Google Scholar). RNAs thus resolved were then electroblotted onto positively charged nylon membranes. The corresponding human sequences and the mouse β-actin sequence were detected using a specific series of random primed probes. The h PRM1, h PRM2, and h TNP2 probes were as described above. The mouse actin probe was a 250-bp fragment of the pTRI-β-actin clone spanning codons 220-303. The membranes were prehybridized in the hybridization solution for at least 8 h at 42°C. They were subsequently hybridized overnight at 42°C in fresh hybridization solution that contained 106cpm/ml of each individual [α-32P]dCTP-radiolabeled probe corresponding to the various members of the gene cluster. Following hybridization the membranes were washed at room temperature in a solution of 2 × SSPE containing 0.1% SDS for 30 min, then at 65°C in 0.1 × SSPE containing 0.1% SDS for 30 min. The membranes were then autoradiographed −70°C for various times to visualize the human PRM1, PRM2, TNP2, and mouse actin mRNAs. The corresponding mouse Prm1, Prm2, and Tnp2 mRNAs were detected using a series of γ-32P 5′-end labeled mouse-specific oligonucleotide probes. The sequences of the mouse-specific oligonucleotide probes were as follows: Prm1, CGGCGACGGCAGCATCTT; Prm2, CTGGGGAGGCTTAGTGATG and Tnp2, CTGATGCCCTCTCCTGGTGTGT. The corresponding membranes were prehybridized for 1 h at 37°C in the oligonucleotide hybridization solution comprising 6 × SSC containing 50 m M sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, buffer, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, 2 m M EDTA, plus 0.1 mg/ml yeast tRNA. The membranes were then hybridized overnight at 37°C in fresh oligonucleotide hybridization solution that contained a single labeled oligonucleotide probe. Following hybridization the membranes were washed at room temperature in a solution of 2 × SSPE containing 0.1% SDS for 30 min, then at 58°C in 0.1 × SSPE containing 0.1% SDS for 45 min. The membranes were then autoradiographed at −70°C for 14 days to visualize the mouse mRNAs. Autoradiographic images that were within the linear response range of the film were quantitated using the Millipore 60S version 3.0 Whole Band Image Analysis system. Comparative values were calculated as a function of exposure time. RNA sample loading was normalized as a function of the intensity of the hybridization signal of the mouse β-actin mRNA and/or the internal ethidium bromide-stained rRNAs. Deviation among samples averaged 16.7%, when compared to the expected values. Approximately 20 × 106permeabilized human sperm were treated with 250 units of DNase I at 37°C and equal individual aliquots removed at 0, 5, 15, 30, and 60 min. The reactions were terminated with the addition of a 50 m M Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, buffered solution containing 50 m M NaCl, 25 m M EDTA plus 0.5% SDS. Proteinase K was then added to the DNase I-treated samples to a concentration of 200 μg/ml, and the resulting mixture incubated at 50°C for 2 h. The DNA was subsequently purified by organic extraction then precipitated with ethanol. Purified DNAs were then denatured in 10 m M EDTA plus 0.4 N NaOH at 95°C for 10 min prior to slot blotting onto positively charged nylon membranes. The membranes were hybridized at 42°C for 18 h to eight different [α-32P]dCTP-labeled probes from unique sequence fragments of human genomic DNA essentially as above. Six of these fragments, denoted as A-F, spanned the region of human chromosome 16p13.2 that encompassed the PRM1→ PRM2→ TNP2 locus. Fragment A encompassed the region from 6,678-7,488; B, 15,035-15,304; C, 19,927-20,327; D, 22,516-23,088; E, 27,940-28,360; and F, 35,296-35,894. The 1,126-bp human, β-actin probe was synthesized using Clontech PCR primer set 5402 and the 268-bp β-globin probe using Perkin-Elmer PCR primer set PCO4/GH20. Both probes recognize sequences on different chromosomes and were used as controls. Subsequent to hybridization, the membranes were washed at 50°C for 15 min in 0.1 × SSPE that contained 0.1% SDS. The membranes were then autoradiographed at −70°C overnight. Autoradiographic images were quantitated using the Millipore 60S slot blot image analysis system. The intensity of hybridization of each DNase I-treated sample data point was expressed relative to that of the zero time point. Mean percent hybridization as a function of time was then plotted. The relative DNase I sensitivity, i.e. t50, of each fragment was defined as the time required to produce a 50% reduction in the total amount of hybridization signal detected. A 40,255-bp NotI fragment of cloned human genomic DNA from cosmid hP3.1 was microinjected into the pronucleus of fertilized C57BL/6J × SJL F2 hybrid eggs of mice. This fragment contained the linear arrayed human PRM1, PRM2 protamine genes and the TNP2 transition protein gene. This gene cluster is juxtaposed by ∼14 kb of non-coding sequence 5′ to the proximal PRM1 gene and ∼11 kb of non-coding sequence 3′ of the distal TNP2 gene nestled among 42 Alu elements. Six founding transgenic animals including two females were produced. Gene fingerprint analysis from each resulting integration event did not reveal any gross rearrangement of this cluster or its members within the founding members or offspring (data not shown). The fidelity of this segment of the human genome containing these numerous repetitive elements was thus maintained, when introduced into and propagated in the transgenic state. Five founding animals showed germ line transmission of the integrated loci. The number of loci integrated within the different lines varied from 4 to 12 copies. FISH analysis, presented in Fig. 1, revealed that animals 892-34 and 884-10 had integrated the h PRM1→h PRM2→h TNP2 gene cluster into mouse chromosome 2, whereas animals 882-21 and 883-00 had integrated the h PRM1→h PRM2→h TNP2 gene cluster into mouse chromosomes 6 and X, respectively. Animals from lines 882, 892, 884, and 885 were then bred further, whereas animal line 883 was excluded from breeding since the human PRM1→ PRM2→ TNP2 locus had integrated into the mouse X chromosome and was subject to X-inactivation. Animal 885-00 lost the h PRM1→h PRM2→h TNP2 locus during the F1generation and was excluded from further analysis. Comparative transcript analysis was undertaken to assess whether this fragment of the human genome from cosmid hP3.1 contained the necessary information to express the human PRM1, PRM2, and TNP2 transgenes in the appropriate context. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the h PRM2 transcript was the most abundant of the spermatid-specific h PRM1, h PRM2, and h TNP2 transcripts in human testis. Comparatively, h PRM1 was present at a level of ∼50% of that of h PRM2, and h TNP2 was present at a level of ∼3% of that of h PRM2. The relative proportions of each of the human PRM2, PRM1, and TNP2 mRNAs present in transgenic mouse testis shown in Fig. 2 B were similar to that observed in human testis shown in Fig. 2A. There was no evidence of any significant cross-hybridization or lack of specificity among the mouse or human probes. Furthermore, transgenic ovary, brain, lung, heart, kidney, and liver RNAs did not hybridize to any of the human or mouse probes (data not shown). The appropriate spatial expression of each member of the human PRM1→ PRM2→ TNP2 transgenic gene cluster was independent of the cognate mouse cluster. One can conclude that this segment of the human genome contains the requisite information for tissue-specific regulation and expression of each of its members in a manner similar if not identical to that observed in vivo. The tenet that this human genomic fragment of ∼40 kb containing the h PRM1→h PRM2→h TNP2 gene cluster acts as a single locus, i.e. domain, similar to that of the β-globin locus (21Grosveld F. van Assendelft G.B. Greaves D.R. Kollias G. Cell. 1987; 51: 975-985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar) was supported by three observations. FISH analysis demonstrated that every transgenic mouse bearing the h PRM1→h PRM2→h TNP2 locus integrated this multigenic human domain into the mouse genome in a position-independent manner. All transgenic animals expressed the h PRM1, h PRM2, and h TNP2 genes in the correct spatial manner. The relative proportion of each member of the transgenic h PRM1→h PRM2→h TNP2 cluster was similar to that observed in vivo. However, this did not demonstrate the hallmark of a genic locus, i.e. copy number-dependent expression of the independently integrated loci. To address this remaining issue, the relative expression of each member of the cluster as a function of the number of copies of the integrated locus was determined. For example, Fomouse 892-00 containing nine copies of the human PRM1→ PRM2→ TNP2 locus showed an ∼2-fold higher level of the corresponding human mRNAs than founder 890-00, which only contained four copies. The relative expression of each member of the human PRM1→ PRM2→ TNP2 locus within each of the F1generation transgenic mice analyzed is shown in Table I. Transgenic animals from lines 884, 892, 882 harbored 6, 9, and 12 copies of the locus, respectively. As expected, the relative level of each of the three gene products of the human PRM1→ PRM2→ TNP2 locus was directly proportional, i.e. 1:1.5:2, to the number of copies, i.e. 6:9:12, of the integrated locus. Furthermore, within each animal the relative level of each gene product was similar to that observed in normal human testis. As expected, their coordinate proportional expression remained dependent upon the number of copies of the integrated loci. The creation of this series of transgenic animals that demonstrate position-independent copy number-dependent expression of each of the members of the human PRM1→ PRM2→ TNP2 cluster, confirms that the entire biological locus is contained within this 40,255-bp NotI fragment of the human genome. Accordingly, this region must contain all elements that ensure locus activation in order to permit correct temporal and spatial expression. This region must also demarcate the boundaries of the genic domain.Table I:Copy number dependent expression of the human PRM1, PRM2, and TNP2 genes in transgenic miceTotal mRNA was prepared from transgenic and non-transgenic mouse testes, then analyzed by Northern transcript analysis. Each mRNA that hybridized to the hPRM1, hPRM2, hTNP2, and mouse actin probes was quantified using the Bio-Image version 3.0 Whole Band Analysis system. The integrated intensity for each of the hybridizing transgenic mRNAs was appropriately normalized to the internal mouse actin control. The relative expression of the PRM1→PRM2→TNP2 cluster in the three F1animals 884-11:892-34:882-19 was 1:1.5:2. Total mRNA was prepared from transgenic and non-transgenic mouse testes, then analyzed by Northern transcript analysis.

The relative expression of the PRM1→PRM2→TNP2 cluster in the three F1animals 884-11:892-34:882-19 was 1:1.5:2. To assess whether this biologically defined locus demarcated the physical domain, individual aliquots of permeabilized human sperm were treated with DNase I for various periods of time. The digested DNAs were then analyzed by slot blot analysis using six unique genomic DNA fragments designated as probes A-F, that encompass the h PRM1→h PRM2→h TNP2 transgenic locus as shown in Fig. 3. Relative hybridization to human β-actin, which is constitutively expressed, provided a DNase I-sensitive control possessing a t50= 13.3 min, whereas human β-globin, which is expressed only in cells of erythroid lineage, served as a DNase I-insensitive control, possessing a t50= 34 min in human sperm. As shown in Fig. 3, fragments B-E displayed varying degrees of enhanced DNase I sensitivity. Their t50values were 11.7, 10.6, 12, and 16 min, respectively, similar to t"

The nucleotide sequence of a 3270-base pair DNA fragment was determined, and the two structural genes, pyoS3A and pyoS3I, and the 3′- and 5′-flanking regions were localized. Transcription (Northern blot) analysis showed that the two genes were co-transcribed. The genes pyoS3A and pyoS3I code for polypeptides of 767 and 154 amino acids, respectively, with calculated molecular weights of 81,385 and 17,047. Pyocin S3 was produced in Escherichia coli from a plasmid and purified as a complex of two components (S3A and S3I) corresponding to the pyoS3A and pyoS3I gene products, respectively. The S3A component, like pyocin S3, had a killing effect involving DNase activity and was inhibited by the S3I protein. Comparisons of the predicted amino acid sequence of the two components of pyocin S3 to those of pyocins S1, S2, and AP41 indicate that pyocin S3 is a new type of S-type pyocin.

Pyocins are proteins produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa that have killing activity against strains of the same species (Jacob, 1954Jacob F. Ann. Inst.

The bactericidal properties of pyocins have been extensively studied and used for typing P. aeruginosa strains (Govan, 1978Govan J.R.W. Bergan T. Norris J.R. Pyocin Typing of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Vol. 10. Academic Press Inc., London1978: 61-91Google Scholar; Fyfe et al., 1984Fyfe J.A.M. Harris G. Gowan J.R.W. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1984; 20: 47-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pyocin synthesis is regulated such that only a few cells in a population actively produce them. Production can be increased by treatments that cause DNA damage such as ultraviolet irradiation (Higerd et al., 1967Higerd T.B. Baechler C.A. Berk S. J. Bacteriol. 1967; 93: 1976-1986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and mitomycin C treatment (Kageyama, 1964Kageyama M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1964; 55: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The killing activity is initiated by absorption of pyocin onto specific outer membrane receptors on susceptible cells. Broadly classified as bacteriocins (Govan, 1986Govan J.R.W. Scand. J. Infect. Dis. Suppl. 1986; 49: 31-37PubMed Google Scholar), a particular feature of the pyocins is that their genetic determinants are all chromosomal (Sano et al., 1990Sano Y. Matsui H. Kobayashi M. Kageyama M. Silver S. Chakrabarty A.M. Iglewski B. Kaplan S. Pseudomonas Biotransformations Pathogenesis and Evolving Biotechnology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington D. C.1990: 352-358Google Scholar). Most P. aeruginosa strains produce various types of pyocins, namely R, F, and S. Particular (R and F) type pyocins have structures similar to bacteriophage tails. The former has a contractile sheath, and the latter a flexible rod-like structure (Ito et al., 1970Ito S. Kageyama M. Egami F. J. Gen. Appl. Microbiol. 1970; 16: 205-214Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar; Kageyama, 1964Kageyama M. J. Biochem.

S-type pyocins are smaller proteins which are soluble and sensitive to proteases (Ito et al., 1970Ito S. Kageyama M. Egami F. J. Gen. Appl. Microbiol. 1970; 16: 205-214Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To date, three S-type pyocins have been extensively studied: S1, S2, and AP41 (Sano and Kageyama, 1981Sano Y. Kageyama M. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 146: 733-739Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Sano and Kageyama, 1984Sano Y. Kageyama M. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 562-570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Sano and Kageyama, 1993Sano Y.

Each pyocin is a complex of two proteins. The large protein (Mrof 65,000, 74,000, and 84,000 for S1, S2, and AP41, respectively) is responsible for the killing activity, degrading chromosomal DNA due to its intrinsic DNase activity. The small protein (Mraround 10,000) has an immunity function, protecting in an equivalent molar ratio the pyocin-producing strain against the DNase activity of the large protein by an as yet uncharacterized mechanism (Sano, 1993Sano Y. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 912-915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The structural genes of these three pyocins have been cloned and sequenced and have been found to be organized in a similar manner (Sano et al., 1990Sano Y. Matsui H. Kobayashi M. Kageyama M. Silver S. Chakrabarty A.M. Iglewski B. Kaplan S. Pseudomonas Biotransformations Pathogenesis and Evolving Biotechnology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington D. C.1990: 352-358Google Scholar). P. aeruginosa regularly colonizes the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients, and the persistence of these bacteria is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Interestingly, a single or a predominant pyocin-producing strain is generally involved in this chronic infection (Fegan et al., 1991Fegan M. Francis M.P. Hayward A.C. Fuerst J.A. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1991; 29: 2151-2157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Godard et al., 1993Godard C. Plesiat P. Michel-Briand Y. Eur. J. Med. 1993; 2: 117-120PubMed Google Scholar). The synthesis of an S-type pyocin with particular bactericidal properties or with a wide killing activity spectrum may contribute to the establishment of such a strain. We report here the selection of the pyocin-producing strain P. aeruginosa P12 which was isolated from a cystic fibrosis patient. The structural genes from P12 encoding a new S-type pyocin were cloned in Escherichia coli and sequenced. Expression of these genes resulted in the synthesis of a protein complex of two components (which we named pyocin S3) with a molecular structure different from those of the three known S-type pyocins. Reagents and enzymes used for sequencing and restriction were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim (Meylan, France) or Pharmacia SA (Saint Quentin en Yvelines, France) and used as recommended. [α-35S]dATP and [γ-32P]ATP were obtained from Du Pont Nemours (Les Ulis, France). Antibiotics and supplements for bacterial growth were purchased from Difco (OSI, Paris, France) and Sigma (l'Isle d'Abeau Chesnes, France). All other chemicals were obtained from standard suppliers and were of reagent grade. P. aeruginosa strains used were P12 (this study), and the 13 indicator strains were labeled 1-8 and A-E (Govan, 1978Govan J.R.W. Bergan T. Norris J.R. Pyocin Typing of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Vol. 10. Academic Press Inc., London1978: 61-91Google Scholar). The hosts and vectors used for gene cloning were E. coli HB101 (Boyer and Roulland-Dussoix, 1969Boyer H.W. Roulland-Dussoix D. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 41: 459-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (2571) Google Scholar), DH5α (Life Technologies, Inc., Eragny, France), XL1-blue (Stratagene), and vector plasmids pGV1122 (Leemans et al., 1982Leemans J. Langenakens J. De Greve H. Deblaere R. Van Montagu M. Schell J. Gene (Amst.). 1982; 19: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and pUC18 and pUC19 (Yanisch-Perron et al., 1985Yanisch-Perron C. Viera J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11465) Google Scholar), and pBluescript KS+ (Stratagene). Plasmid pYK211 carries the AP41 pyocin genes (Sano and Kageyama, 1993Sano Y. Kageyama M. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1993; 237: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), pYMSS1 the S1 pyocin genes (Sano et al., 1993bSano Y. Matsui H. Kobayashi M. Kageyama M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2907-2916Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and pYMPS1 the S2 pyocin genes. E. coli strains were routinely grown aerobically at 37°C in rich (YT or LB) media (Sambrook et al., 1989Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar) with the following antibiotics: ampicillin, 50 μg/ml; tetracycline, 20 μg/ml; spectinomycin, 100 μg/ml. Isopropyl-1-thio-β- D-galactopyranoside and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β- D-galactopyranoside were used at 100 and 50 μg/ml, respectively. P. aeruginosa strains were grown aerobically at 37°C in Mueller-Hinton medium (MH, Diagnostics Pasteur, Marnes-la-Coquette, France) or in minimal G medium (Ito et al., 1970Ito S. Kageyama M. Egami F. J. Gen. Appl. Microbiol. 1970; 16: 205-214Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Standard procedures were used for plasmid preparations, DNA digestions, agarose gel electrophoresis, and cloning (Sambrook et al., 1989Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). Electroporation of E. coli was done in a 0.2-cm cuvette with a Bio-Rad apparatus. DNA fragments were extracted from agarose gels using the PrepA-gene kit (Bio-Rad, Ivry-sur-Seine, France). Partially deleted subclones were constructed using the double strand Nested Deletion kit (Pharmacia SA), purified as DNA templates by the Qiagen procedure (Coger, Paris, France), and sequenced by European Sequencing Gene Service (Montigny le Bretonneux, France). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 1The abbreviations used are:PCRpolymerase chain reactionbpbase pair(s)kbkilobase pair(s). was carried out in automated thermal cycler (Crocodile II, Appligene, Illkirch, France) for 35 cycles, each consisting of 1 min at 95°C, 2 min at 45°C, and 3 min at 72°C, followed by a 7-min incubation at 72°C. The primers used for PCR had the following sequences: 5′-gggggatcCTCATGGTCGTGTGGAGGG-3′ and 5′-GCGACTGACGttcAGGC-3′. Bases complementary to the pPYS3-3 template are in capital letters. The PCR product was cleaved with BamHI and EcoRV and introduced into the corresponding sites of pUC18. Total in vivo-synthesized RNA was isolated from a 100-ml culture of P. aeruginosa P12 cells grown in G medium with or without mitomycin C (1 μg/ml). RNA was extracted 90 min after induction by a hot phenol method (Schatt et al., 1989Schatt E. Jouanneau Y. Vignais P.M. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6218-6226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Restriction fragments used as probes for Northern analysis were 32P-labeled by random-primed DNA labeling (Multiprime DNA labeling system, Amersham, les Ulis, France). The pyoS3A-specific probe was a 1788-base pair (bp) SmaI- BglII fragment, and the pyoS3I-specific probe was a 300-bp Sau3A- EcoRI fragment from pPYS3-3. polymerase chain reaction base pair(s) kilobase pair(s). Total genomic DNA from P12 was prepared by the procedure of Marmur, 1961Marmur J. J. Mol. Biol. 1961; 3: 208-218Crossref Scopus (8999) Google Scholar. The gene bank was constructed with Sau3A DNA fragments approximately 10-20 kilobase pairs (kb) long. These fragments were obtained by partial digestion of total DNA and purified on a 5-25% linear sucrose gradient. They were cloned into the 10.8-kb broad host range plasmid vector pGV1122. Ligation and electrotransformation into E. coli HB101 were performed as described by Kieffer, 1991Kieffer B.L. Gene (Amst.). 1991; : 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar. Transformants were selected on LB plates containing spectinomycin and tested for tetracycline sensitivity. A total of 4,000 tetracycline-sensitive transformants were stored individually at −70°C in 96-well microtiter plates. To screen for pyocin-producing clones, each storage plate was replicated on MH agar using a 96-prong replicator. The plates were incubated at 37°C overnight, exposed to chloroform vapor (20 min) to prevent residual growth, and then overlaid with G medium soft agar containing an indicator strain (3 × 108cells in 5 ml). Plates were examined after overnight incubation at 37°C for clear zones around pyocin-producing colonies. P aeruginosa P12 and E. coli HB101 harboring pGV1122 were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. A culture (1 liter) of strain DH5α carrying pPYS3-3 was grown overnight at 37°C in YT medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once with 25 m M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, centrifuged again, and the pellet was collected and resuspended in 25 m M Tris, pH 7.5, containing 1 m M EDTA and 120 μg/ml lysozyme. The cells were incubated at 37°C for 30 min and centrifuged (10,000 × g) for 15 min at 4°C. The resulting cell-free extract, designated as pyocin lysate, was diluted 2.5-fold in water and applied to a 50-ml DEAE-cellulose column (DE52, Whatman) equilibrated with 10 m M Tris, pH 7.5 (Tris buffer). The proteins were eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 0.25 M NaCl in Tris buffer (2 × 250 ml). Peak fractions with pyocin activity were collected and concentrated to less than 2 ml by ultrafiltration. The pyocin was further purified by gel filtration chromatography. The concentrated protein fraction was applied to a column (1 × 100 cm) of Sephacryl S-200 equilibrated with 25 m M Tris, pH 7.5, containing 0.25 M NaCl. The column was run at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/h. The 2 components of pyocin complex were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified pyocin complex was applied to a 15% acrylamide denaturing gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was stained with CuCl2(Lee et al., 1987Lee C. Levin A. Branton D. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 308-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), and the two colorless protein bands corresponding to pyocin components were excised. The slices were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes and washed with 0.25 M Tris, pH 9, 0.25 M EDTA for 1 h. The proteins were then eluted overnight at 4°C by diffusion in 10 m M phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, 5 m M nitrilotriacetic acid, 0.5 m M EDTA. Protein samples were analyzed by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with a 4.5% acrylamide stacking gel using a small slab gel unit (Bio-Rad). The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue or silver (Wray et al., 1981Wray W. Boulikas T. Wray V.P. Hancock R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2501) Google Scholar). UV-visible spectra were recorded on a Beckman DU650 spectrophotometer. For N-terminal sequencing, purified pyocin samples were subjected to preparative electrophoresis and then electrotransferred to a prewetted polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon PVDPSQ, Millipore, Saint Quentin en Yvelines, France) in 50 m M Tris base, 50 m M boric acid for 18 h at 30 V. Following electrophoretic transfer, the positions of the two pyocin components were identified by staining the membrane briefly with Coomassie Blue. The strips containing the proteins were excised, extensively washed with water, and dried at room temperature. The N-terminal amino acid sequences from these samples were determined using an Applied Biosystems 470 A gas phase protein sequenator at the Institut Pasteur (Paris, France). Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as standard. The isoelectric points were measured using the Pharmacia Phast Gel System, and the proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Pyocin typing of P. aeruginosa strains was performed, with or without trypsin (100 μg/ml) added to soft agar, as described by Fyfe et al., 1984Fyfe J.A.M. Harris G. Gowan J.R.W. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1984; 20: 47-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. Pyocin activity in lysates or purified fractions was detected using the spot testing method (Govan, 1978Govan J.R.W. Bergan T. Norris J.R. Pyocin Typing of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Vol. 10. Academic Press Inc., London1978: 61-91Google Scholar). To estimate the pyocin activity, serially diluted samples were spotted on a indicator strain 1 lawn on MH plates. One unit of activity was defined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution which showed inhibition of growth (Govan, 1974Govan J.R.W. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1974; 80: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To measure the killing activity more precisely, the effect of pyocin on colony formation was determined. The surviving bacteria were counted as described by Ohkawa et al., 1980Ohkawa I. Shiga S. Kageyama M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1980; 87: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar with the following modifications: aliquots of 10 μl were withdrawn after the indicated periods at 37°C, diluted with G medium, and plated on MH agar medium. Colonies were counted after a 24-h incubation at 37°C. The DNase activity associated with the pyocin was determined using the nuclease gel assay consisting of SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing heat-denatured salmon sperm DNA (20 μg/ml) in the separating gel following a previously described procedure (Seo and Galloway, 1990Seo Y. Galloway D.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In vitro, DNase activity was determined with λ phage DNA or chromosomal DNA isolated from indicator strain 1 as substrate (Sano et al., 1993bSano Y. Matsui H. Kobayashi M. Kageyama M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2907-2916Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo, DNA breakdown was detected in pyocin-treated indicator strain 1 cells as described by Sano et al., 1993aSano Y. Kobayashi M. Kageyama M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6179-6185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. In both cases, DNA was examined after electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels. A collection of 77 wild-type P. aeruginosa strains selected from clinical isolates of cystic fibrosis patients were pyocin-typed. Twelve of the strains produced pyocin pattern type 10/a that corresponds to the growth inhibition of the 13 standard indicator strains, 1-8 and A-E (Govan, 1978Govan J.R.W. Bergan T. Norris J.R. Pyocin Typing of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Vol. 10. Academic Press Inc., London1978: 61-91Google Scholar). These 12 wild-type P. aeruginosa strains were then assayed for their pyocin activities against 170 different clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa. One of them, strain P12, exhibited pyocin activity against 87% of the tested strains. We therefore used strain P12 for further analysis and determined the structural class(es) of the produced pyocin(s). Strain P12 produced growth inhibition zones of 7-9 mm in diameter with indicator strains 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, A, B, C and 4 mm with the 5 other indicators on MH agar plates. However, when trypsin was included in the medium, the inhibition zone size was 4 mm for all 13 indicator strains. These results suggest that P12 produces two types of pyocin activity (Fyfe et al., 1984Fyfe J.A.M. Harris G. Gowan J.R.W. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1984; 20: 47-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One of these activities was readily diffusible and sensitive to trypsin and thus corresponds to an S-type pyocin(s). The other activity was less diffusible and resistant to trypsin and is therefore due to particular pyocin(s). The S-type pattern of P12, designated as S1, −2, −3, −4, −5, -A, -B, and -C, is uncommon (Holloway, 1960Holloway B.W. J. Pathol. Bacteriol. 1960; 80: 448-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar; Fyfe et al., 1984Fyfe J.A.M. Harris G. Gowan J.R.W. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1984; 20: 47-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is different from those obtained with the three previously cloned S-type pyocins S1, S2, and AP41 (78/O, S6, E, 22/J, respectively). A genomic library of P. aeruginosa P12 DNA consisting of Sau3A fragments of approximately 10-20 kb cloned into pGV1122 was screened for pyocin-producing clones using each of the 8 indicator strains sensitive to P12 S-type pyocin(s). Two pyocin producer clones (13E4 and 24B7) showing the same S-type pattern as the P12 strain were isolated. Restriction analyses of p13E4 and p24B7 revealed the presence of 10.4- and 20-kb inserts with a common 9-kb DNA, presumably carrying the pyocin genetic determinant (Fig. 1 A). These results suggest that P12 produces only one S-type pyocin, which we call S3. To localize the pyocin S3 genetic determinant in the 9-kb genomic DNA fragment, a series of DNA fragments were subcloned into pUC plasmids using EcoRI, PstI, and HindIII restriction enzymes. A 6.5-kb HindIII fragment in pPYS3-1 expressed the pyocin activity, and a 4.2-kb Sau3A fragment of this plasmid was subcloned into pBluescript KS+ to give pPYS3-2. A nested set of 200-250-bp deletions were constructed from pPYS3-2 with exonuclease III. Plasmid pPYS3-3 carrying a 3270-bp fragment was the smallest construct that contained all the components required for pyocin S3 expression. A restriction map of the 3270-bp fragment of pPYS3-3, with the location of the pyocin S3 genes indicated, is shown in Fig. 1 B. The entire 3270-bp DNA fragment from pPYS3-3 was sequenced (Fig. 1 B). It contains two open reading frames (ORFs) designated pyoS3A and pyoS3I, respectively. The nucleotide sequences and the deduced translation products of the predicted coding sequences are shown in Fig. 2. pyoS3A is 2.3-kb in length and is predicted to encode a 767-amino acid protein with a molecular weight of 81,385 and a pI of 8.54. pyoS3I (462 bp) appears to be translationally coupled to pyoS3A, as the predicted start codon of pyoS3I (ATG) and the stop codon of pyoS3A (TGA) overlap. The nucleotide sequence of pyoS3I predicts a protein of 154 amino acids with a molecular weight of 17,047 and a pI of 5.83. Both of these ORFs are preceded by potential ribosomal binding sites located 8 bases upstream of the methionine start codons. Although these proposed ribosome binding sites are somewhat different from the E. coli consensus Shine-Dalgarno sequence (Rosenberg and Court, 1979Rosenberg M. Court D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1979; 13: 319-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1702) Google Scholar), many P. aeruginosa genes have been reported to have similar ribosome binding sites. The G + C contents of the 2 ORFs, 56.5 and 42.7%, respectively, are somewhat lower than the average G + C content of P. aeruginosa genes (60.1 to 69.5%; West and Iglewski, 1988West S.E.H. Iglewski H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9323-9335Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Two regions with limited similarity to the canonical −35 (TTccag at nucleotide 93) and −10 (TATttT at nucleotide 114) regions of E. coli σ70-type promoter were identified in the region upstream of pyoS3A. The region upstream of these two putative promoter signals contains a 50-bp sequence in which the ATTG nn(n)GT nn(n) motif is repeated four times (Fig. 2). This sequence is remarkably similar to the P box consensus sequence involved in the regulation of pyocin promoters (Matsui et al., 1993Matsui H. Sano Y. Ishihara H. Shinomiya T. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1257-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Downstream of the stop codon TGA of pyoS3I, there is an inverted repeat followed by 4 thymidine residues (nucleotides 2921 to 2941) which may act as a ρ-independent transcriptional terminator (Carlomagno et al., 1985Carlomagno M.S. Riccio A. Bruni C.B. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 362-368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In plasmid pPYS3-3, the pyocin S3 genes were in the same orientation as the lacZ′ of the vector pBluescript KS+. This provides an inducible promoter (P lac) for the genes and may allow expression of the P. aeruginosa DNA in E. coli. Plasmid pPYS3-3 was used to transform the lacIqstrain XL1-blue. The same pyocin activity was detected both in the presence and absence of isopropyl-1-thio-β- D-galactopyranoside suggesting that the expression of the pyocin S3 genes were not under lac promoter control (data not shown). A DNA fragment encompassing the region upstream pyoS3A, extending to the EcoRV site (Fig. 1 B), was generated by PCR (see “Experimental Procedures”). A BamHI restriction site was introduced at the 3′ end of the fragment. The PCR product was subcloned into the BamHI and SmaI sites of pUC18 such that the pyocin S3 genes were oriented in the opposite direction with respect to P lac and thus were not under lac promoter control. This plasmid was called pPYS3-4. The E. coli strain DH5α carrying plasmid pPYS3-4 exhibited the same pyocin activity as DH5α (pPYS3-3). Thus, pyocin S3 genes on the cloned fragment are expressed in E. coli from their native promoter. Northern blots of total RNA from P12 cells treated with mitomycin C (lanes 1 and 3) or not treated (lanes 2 and 4) are shown in Fig. 3. Restriction fragments specific for pyoS3A (lanes 1 and 2) and pyoS3I (lanes 3 and 4) were used as probes in hybridizations. In both cases, a single transcript of approximately 2900 bases was revealed in mitomycin C-induced cells. The size of the transcript was only slightly greater than the 2 coding regions suggesting that the two genes are co-transcribed. RNA from untreated cells gave no detectable signal with either DNA probe. Thus, transcription of pyocin S3 genes can be induced by addition of mitomycin C. Pyocin S3 was purified from DH5α(pPYS3-3) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The specific activity of the purified sample was 1 × 106units/mg. The purified pyocin S3 appeared as a single protein upon Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration (Mrof 90,000) and as a single polypeptide in nondenaturing gel electrophoresis (data not shown). However, two protein bands were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 4 A). As the two proteins were dissociated only under denaturing conditions, pyocin S3 is presumably a complex of two components with Mr= 80,000 (large component) and 17,000 (small component). These sizes agree with the predicted sizes of the products encoded by pyoS3A and pyoS3I. Isoelectric focusing of the purified complex gave a pI of 6.5, and those of the large and small components were 8.25 and 6, respectively. The UV absorption curve of pyocin showed a typical protein spectrum. The ratio of absorption at 280 nm to that at 260 nm was 0.8. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of the two proteins were determined to verify that they were the same as those predicted from the nucleotide sequences. Ten amino acids of the large component were determined and corresponded exactly to the deduced amino acid sequence (Fig. 2). The N-terminal methionine was absent, indicating that the protein was processed in E. coli. The 10 N-terminal residues of the small component agreed with those predicted from pyoS3I. Unlike the large component, the N-terminal methionine was present in the small component. We conclude that the two pyocin S3 components synthesized in E. coli are the products of the genes pyoS3A and pyoS3I. The large and small components of pyocin S3 are designated S3A and S3I, respectively. The biological activity of the purified pyocin S3 was measured by testing its killing efficiency on indicator 1 cells grown in G medium. The number of viable cells in culture decreased exponentially with time and was less than 2% after 30 min of treatment with 3 μg of pyocin (Fig. 5). However, a small proportion of the cells survived even in the presence of a large excess of pyocin (data not shown). Treatment by trypsin completely inactivated the killing activity of pyocin S3 (Fig. 5). The killing activity of S3A was very similar to that of the complex S3, whereas S3I had no activity (Fig. 5). Thus, the S3A component carries the pyocin S3 killing activity. Chromosomal DNA extracted from indicator 1 cells which had been exposed to the pyocin S3 showed extensive degradation (Fig. 6). This result suggests that killing activity of pyocin S3 is associated with a DNase activity. Using the nuclease gel assay (Seo and Galloway, 1990Seo Y. Galloway D.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), this DNase activity was co-localized with the 80,000 protein band, whereas no DNase activity was associated with the 17,000 protein band (Fig. 4 B). We therefore conclude that the large component, S3A, kills the cell by damaging host cell DNA. The purified S3 complex (which includes the S3I protein) had no DNase activity in vitro, whereas the isolated S3A component degraded chromosomal DNA of both phage or indicator strain 1 (Fig. 7). These results suggest that the activity of S3A is inhibited by the S3I component.FIG. 7DNase activity of pyocin S3A against λ phage and indicator strain 1 DNAs. The r"

GTP binding regulatory proteins (G proteins) are heterotrimers consisting of three subunits, α, β, and γ (1Spiegel A.M. Jones T.L.Z. Simonds W.F. Weinstein L.S. G Proteins. R. G.

Findings from several laboratories have demonstrated selectivity in βγ heterodimer assembly so that while both β1and β2can assemble with γ2or γ2-C68S (γ2*), β1but not β2can form heterodimers with γ1or γ1-C71S (γ1*) (8Pronin A.N.

To determine which residues in γ1were responsible for its inability to interact with β2, we made chimeras between γ1* and γ2* with the aim of identifying the minimal sequence of γ2, which might confer β2interaction in the context of a γ1* polypeptide. For convenience in this paper, chimeras are identified by subscripts in a three- or four-digit binary code in which 1 indicates that γ1sequence was used, 2 that γ2sequence was used. A schematic overview of the chimeras employed in this study is presented in Fig. 1, A and B. Three-part chimeras were initially constructed using the conserved sequence motifs Gln-Leu-Lys (QLK, residues 21-23 in γ1and 18-20 in γ2) and Glu-Asp-Pro-Leu (EDPL, residues 50-53 in γ1and 47-50 in γ2) as junctions between chimeric components (Fig. 1 A). Thus chimera γ121* refers to the chimera containing γ1sequence from the N terminus to the QLK motif and from the EDPL motif to the C terminus, with the γ2sequence in between. A second set of chimeras further divided the middle segment into two regions with a junction at the Val-Ser-Lys sequence motif (VSK, residues 33-35 in γ1and 30-32 in γ2) (Fig. 1, B and C). These chimeras are described by a four-digit subscript such that chimera γ2 (12Hurley J.B. Fong H.K. Teplow D.B. Dreyer W.J. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To study the subunit selectivity of the chimeras, they were cotransfected into COS-7 cells with either β1or β2. βγ assembly was determined by assessing the ability of these nonisoprenylated mutant γ subunits to direct expression of β subunit to the soluble protein fraction (6Simonds W.F.

Transfection of β1or β2cDNA alone produced an increase in β immunoreactivity over vector-transfected controls in the crude particulate fraction (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 3 and 5, cf. lane 1) but not in the soluble fraction (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 4 and 6). The increase in β immunoreactivity in the crude membrane fraction due to transfection of β cDNA alone was more marked than observed previously (6Simonds W.F. Butrynski J.E. Gautam N. Unson C.G. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5363-5366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but is consistent with work from other laboratories (31Muntz K.H. Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. Mumby S.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). While these differences in the crude membrane fraction may result from variations in the efficiency of separation of the low speed nuclear pellet from the postnuclear fractions (6Simonds W.F. Butrynski J.E. Gautam N. Unson C.G. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5363-5366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), they were not explored further in this study. Cotransfection in COS cells of β1with either γ1* or γ2* resulted in the expression of both β and γ subunits in the cytosol (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 8). In contrast, β2cotransfection with γ2* but not γ1* resulted in the cytosolic expression of both subunits (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 10), confirming the previously described incompatibility of β2with γ1and γ1* (8Pronin A.N. Gautam N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6220-6224Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 9Schmidt C.J. Thomas T.C. Levine M.A. Neer E.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 23409-23417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It should be noted that in cotransfected cells, the appearance of significant γ immunoreactivity in the cytosol correlates with the presence of a β signal there (Fig. 2, A and B, cf. lanes 8 and 10). This results presumably from subunit stabilization engendered by cotransfection of compatible β and γ subunits as recently described (32Pronin A.N. Gautam N. FEBS Lett. 1993; 328: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Subsequent screening of nonprenylated γ chimeras for their ability to assemble with β1or β2was therefore performed by analysis of cytosolic fractions only. Soluble βγ heterodimers containing nonisoprenylated γ subunits show no functional interaction with effector molecules such as adenylyl cyclase (10Iiguez-Lluhi J.A. Simon M.I. Robishaw J.D.

Chem. 1992; 267: 23409-23417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although reports to the contrary have appeared (35Wildman D.E. Tamir H. Leberer E. Northup J.K. Dennis M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To verify that the global folding of the subunits in the soluble nonprenylated βγ complex mimics that of functional βγ complexes, analysis by limited tryptic digestion was performed (Fig. 3) (23Fung B.K. Nash C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10503-10510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Winslow J.W. Van Amsterdam J.R. Neer E.J. J. Biol.

A ∼26-kDa C-terminal β fragment was protected from trypsin in the cytosolic fraction of COS cells cotransfected with β1γ1*, β1γ2*, and β2γ2*, which comigrated with the fragment generated by identical treatment of authentic brain βγ (Fig. 3) consistent with previous reports (31Muntz K.H. Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. Mumby S.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Prior heat denaturation abolished the trypsin resistance of the C-terminal fragments (Fig. 3). These findings support the contention that soluble, nonprenylated βγ complexes resemble native βγ heterodimers in the global conformation of their subunits. Because our strategy was to estimate the ability of γ chimeras to assemble with β subunits by monitoring cytosolic β immunoreactivity, we sought experimental conditions that would minimize variability because of unequal distribution of β and γ cDNAs during cotransfection or due to small variations in the quality of chimeric γ cDNA plasmid preparations. We wanted conditions therefore in which the amount of β but not γ cDNA would be limiting with respect to the expression of cytosolic β subunit. Under these conditions, any observed differences in soluble β expression among cotransfectants employing different mutant γ constructs would be more likely to reflect differences in subunit expression and protein-protein interaction. To establish these conditions, a constant amount of β2cDNA was cotransfected with increasing amounts of γ2* cDNA and the level of cytosolic β expression monitored. β2was chosen because the gain of β2interaction by γ1* mutants substituted with γ2-specific residues was the principal end point of mutagenesis. The β signal generated from 5 μg of β2cDNA became saturated at 10-15 μg of γ2* cDNA (not shown). For subsequent screening of γ1/γ2chimeras, therefore, a 3:1 ratio of γ to β cDNA (w/w) was employed. The first set of nonisoprenylated γ chimeras was constructed using the conserved QLK and EDPL sequence motifs as junctions dividing the γ subunit into three regions (Fig. 1 A). Transfection of vector or β1 cDNA alone produced no β immunoreactivity in the cytosol (Fig. 4, A, lanes 1 and 2) as previously shown. In contrast cotransfection of β1 with γ1* (γ111*), γ2* (γ222*), and each of six three-part chimeras, γ121*, γ211*, γ221*, γ112*, γ122*, and γ212*, all promoted the appearance of cytosolic β-immunoreactivity (Fig. 4 A, lanes 3-10 upper panel). Immunoblotting with γ-specific C-terminal antibodies confirmed the expression of all of the chimeric constructs (Fig. 4 A, lanes 3-10, lower panels). In contrast to the results with β1, only chimeric γ constructs γ121*, γ221*, and γ122* along with γ2* (γ222*) supported cytosolic β expression when β2was cotransfected (Fig. 4 B, lanes 4, 6, 8, and 10). These results focussed our attention on the region of the γ subunit between the QLK and EDPL sequence motifs as chimeras containing γ2but not γ1sequence here proved capable of assembling with β2. A second set of γ chimeras derived from γ121* and γ212* was created by subdividing the middle region around a conserved Val-Ser-Lys (VSK) sequence motif (Fig. 1 B). Like the parental chimera γ121* (γ1 (22Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) 1*), chimera γ1 (12Hurley J.B. Fong H.K. Teplow D.B. Dreyer W.J. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6948-6952Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) 1* was capable of directing the expression of both β1and β2to the cytosol (Fig. 5 A, upper panel, lanes 5, 6, 8, and 9). Similarly, expression of both chimeras γ1 (22Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) 1* and γ1 (12Hurley J.B. Fong H.K. Teplow D.B. Dreyer W.J. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6948-6952Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) 1* was demonstrable in γ immunoblots of cells cotransfected with either β1or β2(Fig. 5 A, lower panel, lanes 5, 6, 8, and 9). In contrast chimera γ1 (21Cullen B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 684-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar) 1* displayed a γ1*-like phenotype, interacting with β1but not with β2(Fig. 5 A, lanes 11 and 12). These results suggested that residues within the region between the VSK and EDPL motifs of γ1and γ2determine the ability to dimerize with β2(Fig. 1 C). Consistent with this interpretation was the finding that chimera γ2 (12Hurley J.B. Fong H.K. Teplow D.B. Dreyer W.J. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6948-6952Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) 2* but not γ2 (21Cullen B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 684-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar) 2* (Fig. 1 B) interacted with β2in the cytosolic shift assay (data not shown). These results confirm a recent report by Spring and Neer (36Spring D.J. Neer E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22882-22886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) who utilized γ subunit chimeras synthesized by in vitro translation to map the β discrimination region to this same 14-amino acid region (Fig. 1 C). As noted previously with nonchimeric γ* subunits (7Garritsen A. van Galen P.J.M. Simonds W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7706-7710Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 11Garritsen A. Simonds W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24418-24423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), when transfected alone, none of the three γ* chimeras produced significant cytosolic β or γ immunoreactivity (Fig. 5 A, lanes 4, 7, and 10). Among the 14 amino acids that lie between the conserved VSK and EDPL sequence motifs, 12 residues differ between γ1and γ2(Fig. 1 C). A pair of cysteine residues at positions 36 and 37 in γ1, represented by twin alanine residues in γ2, can be linked by disulfide bond formation to Cys25of the β1subunit in the presence of cupric phenanthroline (37Bubis J. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12995-12999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This pair of γ1cysteines lies closely apposed to the N-terminal α-helical region of β in a recent model of βγ interaction based on a coiled coil interaction (7Garritsen A. van Galen P.J.M. Simonds W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7706-7710Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In a study of the effect on βγ assembly of point mutations in the putative coiled coil region of γ1, it was found that mutation of both Cys36and Cys37to Ala failed to confer the ability to assemble with β2. 2A. Garritsen, R. Collins, and W. F. Simonds, manuscript in preparation. The 10 remaining divergent residues in γ1were therefore replaced with γ2sequence in three mutant constructs, each containing a cluster of three or four point mutations. In mutant γ2*-ADL, residues 38-40 of γ1*, Glu-Glu-Phe, were replaced with Ala-Asp-Leu. Mutant γ1*-MAYC was made by replacing residues 41-44 of γ1* with the sequence Met-Ala-Tyr-Cys (the Tyr is conserved in both γ1and γ2). In mutant γ1*-AHAK residues 46-49 were replaced by the γ2sequence Ala-His-Ala-Lys. Fig. 5 B shows the results of cotransfection of the three γ2* cluster mutants with β1and β2. When transfected alone, none of the three γ2* cluster mutants produced significant cytosolic β or γ immunoreactivity (Fig. 5 B, lanes 4, 7, and 10). While cotransfection of all three cluster mutants with β1resulted in the cytosolic expression of β immunoreactivity, only γ2*-ADL produced a significant cytosolic β signal when the cotransfection employed β2(Fig. 5 B, upper panel, lane 6, cf. lanes 9 and 12). As expected, steady-state γ chimera immunoreactivity in the cytosol of β2-cotransfected cells correlated with the strength of the β signal and was greatest in the case of γ2*-ADL (Fig. 5 B, lower panel, lane 6, cf. lanes 9 and 12). These observations identify this triplet of amino acids as the dominant locus between the conserved VSK and EDPL motifs of γ1and γ2determining the ability to interact with β2(Fig. 1 C). This region forms part of an α-helix in both γ1and γ2according to secondary structure predictive algorithms (38Garnier J. Osguthorpe D.J. Robson B. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 120: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (3426) Google Scholar, 39Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11532) Google Scholar). In order to analyze the individual contribution of residues within this triplet of amino acids, a series of point mutants were made exchanging individual residues in this region between γ1* and γ2*. Point mutants E38A, E39D, and F40L of γ1* were made and transfected alone or in combination with either β1or β2(Fig. 6 A). When transfected alone, none of the three point mutants of γ1* produced significant β or γ immunoreactivity in the cytosol (Fig. 6 A, lanes 4, 7, and 10). Cotransfection of all three γ1*-derived point mutants with β1, however, resulted in a significant cytosolic shift of β (Fig. 6 A, upper panel, lanes 5, 8, and 11) and definite γ-immunoreactivity (Fig. 6 A, lower panel, lanes 5, 8, and 11). Upon cotransfection with β2, only γ1*-F40L interacted significantly as seen in both β and γ blots (Fig. 6 A, lane 12, cf. lanes 6 and 9). When residues from this region of γ1were substituted into γ2* to create γ2*-EEF and γ2*-L37F, these mutants, like the parental construct γ2*, were expressed and directed β-immunoreactivity to the cytosol when cotransfected with β1bu"

To examine whether the region needed for stimulation of RNA polymerase II and that for suppression of 6-azauracil sensitivity in the S-II molecule could be separated, we constructed various deletion mutants of S-II and expressed them in the null mutant using the GAL1 promoter to see if the mutant proteins suppressed 6-azauracil sensitivity. We also expressed these constructs in Escherichia coli, purified the mutant proteins to homogeneity, and examined if they stimulated RNA polymerase II. We found that a mutant protein lacking the first 147 amino acid residues suppressed 6-azauracil sensitivity but that removal of 2 additional residues completely abolished the suppression. A mutant protein lacking the first 141 residues had activity to stimulate RNA polymerase II, whereas removal of 10 additional residues completely abolished this activity. We also examined arrest-relief activity of these mutant proteins and found that there is a good correlation between RNA polymerase II-stimulating activity and arrest-relief activity. Therefore, at least the last 168 residues of S-II are sufficient for expressing these three activities. The yeast S-II null mutant is viable, but the mutation induces sensitivity to 6-azauracil.

EMBO J. 1983; 2: 2071-2073Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It is not known why the S-II null mutant is sensitive to 6-azauracil. However, 6-azauracil sensitivity is the only prominent phenotype of the S-II null mutant, and the function of S-II as a transcription factor may be indispensable for suppressing 6-azauracil sensitivity. To gain more insight into the structure-function relationship of S-II, we created various deletion mutants of S-II and examined their abilities to stimulate RNA polymerase II, relieve arrest, and suppress the 6-azauracil sensitivity of the S-II null mutant. Results indicated that all of these activities are due to the same motif in the S-II molecule, suggesting that 6-azauracil sensitivity is caused by loss of function of S-II as a transcription factor. The S-II null mutant was established previously from ANY102 (Mata/Matα, leu2/leu2, his/his, trp1/trp1, ura3/ura3) by inserting the LEU2 gene into the S-II gene (26Nakanishi T. Nakano A. Nomura K. Sekimizu K. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13200-13204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the null mutant required uracil and could not be used for assay of suppression of 6-azauracil sensitivity. So, we established a new S-II null mutant by inserting the URA3 gene. Gene disruption method used was essentially as reported before (26Nakanishi T. Nakano A. Nomura K. Sekimizu K. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13200-13204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, pBSM13 carrying a 4.0-kilobase fragment of YSII::LEU2 was digested with XbaI and ClaI to remove the LEU2 gene, and the URA3 gene was ligated instead of the LEU2 gene. The insert was purified and used for transformation of TNY04 obtained by tetrad dissection of ANY102 (34Gietz D. Jean A.S. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2895) Google Scholar). One of the URA+ transformants thus obtained was named TNY14. Disruption of the S-II gene in TNY14 was confirmed by Southern blot analysis as described before (26Nakanishi T. Nakano A. Nomura K. Sekimizu K. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13200-13204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast cells were transformed essentially as described by Gietz et al. (34Gietz D. Jean A.S. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2895) Google Scholar). They were grown in 5 ml of YPD medium (1% polypeptone, 1% yeast extract, 2% glucose) at 30°C to an optical density at 600 nm (A600) of 2.0 and then collected and suspended in 50 μl of TELiAc (10 m M Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 1 m M EDTA, 100 m M CH3COOLi). This suspension was incubated with 100 ng of plasmids, 50 μg of heat-denatured calf thymus DNA, and 300 μl of TELiAc containing 40% polyethylene glycol 4000 for 30 min at 30°C and then for 20 min at 42°C. The cells were collected, suspended in sterilized water, and spread on YNBD plates (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% glucose), supplemented with 20 μg/ml each of adenine sulfate, tryptophan, histidine, and 30 μg/ml of leucine, and incubated for 3 days at 30°C. Plasmids containing S-II deletion mutants were constructed as follows. S-II deletion mutants were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the S-II gene (pYSII-2) as a template, and the resulting DNA fragments were ligated to the GAL1 promoter in pYO324. Mutant S-II proteins were induced by galactose. Transformed cells were cultured in EMD medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 0.5% casamino acids technical, 2% glucose) with an appropriate supplement(s) at 30°C until A600 reached about 2.0. Then 2.5 × 106cells were transferred to 0.5 ml of fresh medium and incubated at 30°C for 2 h. The cell suspension was diluted 1000-fold with sterilized water, and 120 μl of the diluted cell suspension was spread on YNBD or YNBGS (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 5% galactose, and 0.2% sucrose) plates containing an appropriate supplement(s) with or without 100 μg/ml 6-azauracil. Colonies on YNBGS plates were examined after incubation at 30°C for 5 days. This assay was done essentially as described before in the presence and absence of each recombinant S-II deletion mutant protein (26Nakanishi T. Nakano A. Nomura K. Sekimizu K. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13200-13204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (60 μl) contained 50 m M Tris/HCl (pH 7.9), 1.6 m M MnCl2, 0.5 m M each of ATP, GTP, and CTP, 0.01 m M UTP, 18.5 kBq of [3H]UTP, 10 m M 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 μg of calf thymus DNA, and 8 units of partially purified S. cerevisiae RNA polymerase II. The reaction mixture was incubated for 20 min at 30°C, and then the radioactivity incorporated into the acid-insoluble fraction was counted. 1 unit of RNA polymerase II was defined as the amount incorporating 1 pmol of UMP into the acid-insoluble fraction. This assay was done essentially as described by Christie et al. (29Christie K.R. Awrey D.E. Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 936-943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using a 3′-deoxycytidine-extended template (35Kadesch T.R. Chamberlin M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5286-5295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of the TaqI fragment containing the human histone H3.3 gene (36Reines D. Wells D. Chamberlin M.J. Kane C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 196: 299-312Google Scholar), RNA polymerase II, and S-II mutant proteins. The dC-tailed template used was kindly provided by Dr. C. M. Kane (University of California, Berkeley Dept. of Molecular and Cell Biology). Recombinant S-II mutant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli using the T7 expression system, as described before (37Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4834) Google Scholar). Plasmids containing S-II deletion mutants were constructed as follows. S-II deletion mutants were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using pYSII-2 as a template, and the resulting DNA fragments were ligated into an expression vector, pET-3d. The resulting plasmids were transfected into E. coli BL21(DE3)/pLysE, and induction of S-II mutant proteins was performed by treating the E. coli cells with isopropyl-1-thio-β- D-galactopyranoside. Recombinant S-II mutant proteins were purified as follows. Freshly harvested E. coli cells were lysed by treatment with lysozyme-EDTA and deoxycholate, and the lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The resulting supernatant was diluted with buffer 1 (50 m M Tris/HCl, pH 7.9, 5 m M 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Triton X-100) and then subjected to fast protein liquid chromatography on a Mono-S HR 5/5 column equilibrated with buffer 1. Recombinant S-II deletion mutant proteins were eluted with buffer 1 containing 0.05-0.2 M NaCl. The fraction of Δ3-151 protein from the Mono-S column was further purified on a column of Superose 12 with buffer 1 containing 1 M NaCl. Recombinant S-II mutant proteins were detected by immunoblotting with antibody against yeast S-II. S-II and partially purified RNA polymerase II from S. cerevisiae were prepared as described before (26Nakanishi T. Nakano A. Nomura K. Sekimizu K. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13200-13204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antibody against S-II was raised by injecting purified S-II into male albino rabbits. On immunoblotting, this antibody detected S-II in the crude extract of yeast as a single band. DNA manipulations including restriction enzyme digestion, gel electrophoresis, DNA ligation, plasmid isolation, and E. coli transformation were carried out by standard methods. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis were performed as described before (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar, 39Homma K. Kurata S. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15258-15264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein was determined by the method of Bradford (40Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar). Previous studies showed that S-II, the PPR2/DST1 gene product, and STPα are almost certainly the same protein (26Nakanishi T. Nakano A. Nomura K. Sekimizu K. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13200-13204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Hubert J.-C. Guyonvarch A. Kammerer B. Exinger F. Liljelund P. Lacroute F.

We are interested in the functional motifs in the S-II molecule. To examine whether the region needed for stimulation of RNA polymerase II and that needed for 6-azauracil sensitivity in the S-II molecule could be separated, we constructed plasmids carrying the genes for various S-II deletion mutant proteins and used these plasmids for in vivo and in vitro experiments. We examined the ability of S-II deletion mutant proteins to suppress 6-azauracil sensitivity by introducing these plasmids into the yeast S-II null mutant and expressing the mutant proteins in vivo. We also expressed these plasmids in E. coli, isolated mutant S-II proteins, and examined their ability to stimulate yeast RNA polymerase II in vitro. The S-II null mutants that we established previously required uracil (26Nakanishi T. Nakano A. Nomura K. Sekimizu K. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13200-13204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), so they could not be used for testing suppression of 6-azauracil sensitivity. Therefore, we constructed a new S-II null mutant. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA derived from TNY14 showed that its S-II gene was disrupted. We further confirmed that S-II is not present in TNY14 by an immunofluorescence study with affinity-purified anti-S-II antibody. Immunofluorescence was exclusively detected in the nuclei of wild type yeast, whereas no immunofluorescence was detected in TNY14 (data not shown). Thus, we concluded that S-II is a nuclear protein and that TNY14 lacks this protein. TNY14 was sensitive to 6-azauracil and did not form colonies on MVD agar plates containing 100 μg/ml of 6-azauracil (Fig. 1, A and B). When pYSG6 (an expression vector containing the GAL1 promoter-yeast S-II gene coding region) was introduced into TNY14, the resulting transformant could form colonies on MVGS agar plates in the presence of 6-azauracil (Fig. 1, C and D), indicating that introduction of full-length S-II cDNA suppressed the 6-azauracil sensitivity of TNY14. However, it did not form colonies on MVD plates as expected. Using this system, we examined the suppressions of 6-azauracil sensitivity by various S-II deletion mutants. The amino acid sequence of S-II is known to be conserved in various eukaryotes. In particular, about 50 residues in the carboxyl-terminal region are highly conserved (about 70% similarity), and about 80 residues in the amino-terminal region are also relatively well conserved (about 38% similarity) (10Hirashima S. Hirai H. Nakanishi Y. Natori S. J Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3858-3863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Kanai A. Kuzuhara T. Sekimizu K. Natori S. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 936-943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that in yeast S-II, lacking the first 113 residues has the same activity as the full-length form to read-through the pausing site. On the bases of these results, we constructed seven clones of S-II deletion mutants. Of these, five were deletion mutants of the amino-terminal side, and two were those of the carboxyl-terminal side. We found that the amino-terminal mutants Δ2-123 (in which residues 2-123 were deleted), Δ2-141, and Δ3-147 suppressed the 6-azauracil sensitivity of TNY14 but that Δ2-149 and Δ2-151 did not. These results indicated that residues 1-147, including the relatively well conserved sequence in the amino-terminal region, are not essential for suppression of 6-azauracil sensitivity. The carboxyl-terminal mutant, Δ260-309, did not suppress 6-azauracil sensitivity, indicating that the 49 carboxyl-terminal residues are necessary for suppressing 6-azauracil sensitivity. We confirmed the expression of each deletion mutant protein in the corresponding transformant by immunoblot analysis, as shown in Fig. 2. We then expressed these S-II deletion mutants in E. coli, purified each protein to near homogeneity, and examined its ability to stimulate RNA polymerase II and relieve arrest in vitro. As shown in Fig. 3 A, each protein gave essentially a single band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunoblotting again showed that all the mutant proteins reacted with antibody against S-II (Fig. 3 B). As is evident from Fig. 4, wild type S-II and the Δ2-123 protein had almost the same stimulatory activity, but the Δ2-141 protein had less, and the Δ2-151 protein had none. Therefore, it is clear that the first 141 residues are not essential for stimulation of RNA polymerase II. As the Δ266-309 protein had no stimulatory activity, the last 44 residues in the carboxyl-terminal region are essential for stimulation of RNA polymerase II.FIG. 4Stimulation of RNA polymerase II by S-11 deletion mutant proteins. Increasing amounts of purified recombinant S-II mutant proteins were added to 8 units of partially pU!;fied yeast RNA polymerase II, and their activity in stimulating RNA polymerase II was measured under standard assay conditions. Lines indicate activity of mutant proteins and S-II (wt) as shown on the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also examined arrest-relief activity of these mutant proteins. As shown in Fig. 5, wild type S-II, Δ2-123, and Δ2-141 proteins promoted read-through by RNA polymerase II at specific blocks to elongation in the human histone H3.3 gene, sites designated TIa, TIb, and TII (36Reines D. Wells D. Chamberlin M.J. Kane C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 196: 299-312Google Scholar, 41Kerpolla T.K. Kane C.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, Δ3-151 and Δ266-309 proteins had no appreciable activity to relieve transcription arrest at these sites. Summary of two independent arrest-relief experiments is shown in Table I. These results strongly suggested that the ability to stimulate RNA polymerase II and to relieve arrest at specific pausing sites are the same activity, and that this activity is essential for suppression of 6-azauracil sensitivity of S-II null mutants, as summarized in Fig. 6.Table I:Summary of activities of S-II mutant proteins to promote read-through of RNA polymerase IITable I:Summary of activities of S-II mutant proteins to promote read-through of RNA polymerase IIData were obtained from the quantitation of the read-through experiments described in the legend to Fig. 5.

Each value represents the average of two experiments with S.D. Using various S-II deletion mutants of yeast, we demonstrated that at least 1-147 residues from the amino-terminal are not essential, and the last 162 residues are sufficient for suppression of the 6-azauracil sensitivity of an S-II null mutant. We also showed that for activity to stimulate RNA polymerase II and relieve arrest, there is a critical point in S-II between residues 142 and 151, and that 168 but not 158 of the carboxyl-terminal residues were necessary for stimulation of RNA polymerase II and relief of transcription arrest in vitro. Therefore, this region should contain binding regions for both RNA polymerase II and nucleic acid (6Horikoshi M. Sekimizu K. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 608-611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Agarwal K. Beak K.-H. Jeon C.-J. Miyamoto K. Ueno A. Yoon H.-S.

Weiss M.A. Nature. 1993; 365: 277-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). For technical reasons, we could not purify the Δ2-147 and Δ2-149 proteins in an E. coli lysate and thus could not examine their abilities to stimulate RNA polymerase II and relieve arrest. Nonetheless, it is quite clear that there is a good correlation between the activity for suppression of 6-azauracil sensitivity in vivo and that for stimulation of RNA polymerase II (and thus for arrest relief) in vitro, and that nearly half of the 309 residues of S-II are not directly related to these activities. Christie et al. (29Christie K.R. Awrey D.E. Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 936-943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also reported that there is essentially no difference in the cleavage or read-through activities between complete yeast S-II and a mutant S-II lacking the first 113 residues. Probably, the functional motif of S-II is in the carboxyl-terminal half, and the amino-terminal half is the regulatory motif, since this region of S-II of Ehrlich cell has been shown to contain phosphorylation sites (7Horikoshi M. Sekimizu K. Hirashima S. Mitsuhashi Y. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5739-5744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, read-through mechanism of S-II may not be so simple because Cipres-Palacin and Kane (44Cipres-Palacin G. Kane C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8087-8091Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) recently reported S-II mutants that are inactive for promoting read-through, although they stimulated cleavage of the nascent transcript in stalled elongation complexes (44Cipres-Palacin G. Kane C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8087-8091Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Unlike mutants lacking regions of the amino-terminal half, those lacking about 50 residues from the carboxyl-terminal were shown to have lost all the stimulatory, arrest-relief, and suppressive activities. Again, we could not examine these activities with a single mutant for technical reasons, but we deduced that the Δ260-309 protein had no stimulatory and arrest-relief activity from the fact that the 6-residue-longer Δ266-309 protein had no activity. These genetical and biochemical results strongly suggest that 6-azauracil sensitivity is due to loss of function of S-II as a transcription factor. There seem to be two possible reasons why the S-II null mutant has acquired the phenotype of 6-azauracil sensitivity. One is that S-II is essential for the transcription of another gene that causes 6-azauracil sensitivity, and the S-II null mutant lacks this gene product. This gene product may not be essential for the growth of yeast, since the S-II null mutant is not lethal (26Nakanishi T. Nakano A. Nomura K. Sekimizu K. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13200-13204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Hubert J.-C. Guyonvarch A. Kammerer B. Exinger F. Liljelund P. Lacroute F.

The other possibility is that many pausing sites are introduced into the yeast genome in the presence of 6-azauracil, and the S-II null mutant becomes lethal in the presence of 6-azauracil, as these pausing sites cannot be read-through by RNA polymerase II in the absence of S-II. With respect to the latter possibility, Exinger and Lacroute (45Exinger F. Lacroute F. Curr. Genet. 1992; 22: 9-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) reported that 6-azauracil inhibits GTP synthesis in S. cerevisiae and also causes significant decrease in the UTP content. In vitro transcription experiments showed that reduction of at least one of four nucleoside triphosphates in the reaction mixture induced pause of transcription elongation and that addition of S-II released this cessation of transcription elongation (18Izban M.G. Luse D.S. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 1342-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 20Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3795-3800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Reines D.

Chem. 1994; 269: 936-943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that many pausing sites are created in various class II genes and that their transcriptions are inhibited in the presence of 6-azauracil, interfering with the growth of the S-II null mutant (46Archambault J. Lacroute F. Ruet A. Friesen J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4142-4152Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). If the former possibility is the case, there should be a specific gene(s) responsible for 6-azauracil sensitivity that is transcribed only in the presence of S-II. Identification and isolation of this gene(s) may give a clue to the function of S-II in vivo. If the latter possibility is correct, this S-II null mutant should become lethal when the nucleoside triphospate pool in the cells is reduced by other methods. It is unlikely that S-II itself has activity to detoxify 6-azauracil or to disturb the uptake of 6-azauracil, thus making the S-II null mutant sensitive to 6-azauracil, because, in general, metabolic enzymes are present in the cytoplasm and barrier proteins are present in the membrane, whereas S-II was found almost exclusively in the nuclei. We thank Dr. Caroline M. Kane for supplying the template and protocol for arrest-relief assay."

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3577-3588Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar; Nilsson et al., 1991Nilsson T. Lucocq J.M. Mackay D. Warren G.

However, these membrane-spanning domains appear not to share sequence homology. One way to explain retention by means of transmembrane regions is by “kin recognition” (Nilsson et al., 1993Nilsson T. Slusarewicz P. Mee H.H. Warren G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, Nilsson et al., 1994Nilsson T. Hoe M.H. Slusarewicz P. Rabouille C. Watson R. Hunte F. Watzele G. Berger E.G. Warren G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 562-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). According to this model, upon their arrival at the appropriate cisterna of the stack, Golgi proteins will form large heterooligomers possibly mediated by their membrane-spanning domains. Within any one cisterna these oligomers would comprise the different proteins that localize to this particular cisterna. Nilsson et al., 1993Nilsson T. Slusarewicz P. Mee H.H. Warren G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar have argued that the retention may also be facilitated by the cytoplasmic tails of these proteins possibly by binding to a cytosolic intercisternal matrix. A consequence of this retention mechanism is that the ensuing complexes are thought to be so large that they are physically excluded from transport vesicles (Nilsson et al., 1993Nilsson T. Slusarewicz P. Mee H.H. Warren G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, Nilsson et al., 1994Nilsson T. Hoe M.H. Slusarewicz P. Rabouille C. Watson R. Hunte F. Watzele G. Berger E.G. Warren G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 562-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Although not mutually exclusive, the putative formation of oligomers in the Golgi complex may also be induced by the microenvironment of a specific Golgi cisterna, for instance its lipid composition (Machamer, 1993Machamer C.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). So far, only one example of complex formation or detergent insolubility of a Golgi-retained protein has been described in vivo (Weisz et al., 1993Weisz O.A. Swift A.M. Machamer C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1185-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Other studies have emphasized that Golgi membrane proteins have generally shorter and less hydrophobic transmembrane domains compared with plasma membrane proteins and that this may explain retention of the former (Masibay et al., 1993Masibay A.S. Balaji P.V. Boeggeman E.E. Qasba P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9908-9916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Bretscher and Munro, 1993Bretscher M.S. Munro S. Science. 1993; 261: 1280-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). Bretscher and Munro, 1993Bretscher M.S. Munro S. Science. 1993; 261: 1280-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar pointed out that the plasma membrane is relatively enriched in cholesterol, a lipid that tends to make the bilayer “thicker.” Golgi-resident proteins, according to this view, will be retained simply because they are sorted away from the thick bilayers. In three cases experimental evidence appeared to be consistent with this hypothesis (Munro, 1991Munro S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3577-3588Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar; Swift and Machamer, 1991Swift A.M. Machamer C.E. J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 9908-9916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The M protein of coronaviruses has been extensively used as a tool to study Golgi retention (see above; Swift and Machamer, 1991Swift A.M. Machamer C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar; Armstrong et al., 1990Armstrong J. Patel S. Riddle P. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 95: 191-197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Armstrong and Patel, 1991Armstrong J. Patel S. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 98: 567-575PubMed Google Scholar). The overall structure is well conserved among different coronaviruses; it invariably contains a short luminal domain of about 25 amino acids that is either O (mouse hepatitis virus, MHV)- or N-glycosylated (IBV-M), three membrane-spanning domains and a long amphiphilic cytoplasmic domain (see e.g. Rottier et al., 1986Rottier P.J.M. Welling G.W. Welling-Wester S. Niesters H.G. Lenstra J.A. van der Zeijst B.A.M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1335-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The O-glycosylation of the MHV-M protein has been analyzed extensively (Niemann et al., 1984Niemann H. Geyer R. Klenk H.-D. Linder D. Stirm S. Wirth M. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 665-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar; Tooze et al., 1988Tooze S.A. Tooze J. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1475-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In SDS-PAGE one can distinguish up to five electrophoretically different forms, which we have referred to as M0through M5. Since these forms correspond to the arrival of the protein in different intracellular compartments (see Fig. 1; Krijnse Locker et al., 1992aKrijnse Locker J. Griffiths G. Horzinek M.C. Rottier P.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14094-14101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, Krijnse Locker et al., 1994aKrijnse Locker J. Ericsson M. Rottier P.J.M. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 55-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), the extent of O-glycosylation can be used as a marker of transport of the M protein. When expressed independently the IBV-M protein localizes to the cis-Golgi region, where it co-localizes with markers of the IC (Machamer et al., 1990Machamer C.E. Mentone S.A. Rose J.K. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6944-6948Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar; Sodeik et al., 1993Sodeik B. Doms R.W. Ericsson M. Hiller G. Machamer C.E. van't Hof W. van Meer G. Moss B. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 521-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar; Klumperman et al., 1994Klumperman J. Krijnse Locker J. Meier A. Horzinek M.C. Geuze H.J. Rottier P.J.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6523-6534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, and for reasons that remain elusive, the MHV-M protein localizes to the trans side of the Golgi and the TGN (Krijnse Locker et al., 1992aKrijnse Locker J. Griffiths G. Horzinek M.C. Rottier P.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14094-14101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Klumperman et al., 1994Klumperman J. Krijnse Locker J. Meier A. Horzinek M.C. Geuze H.J. Rottier P.J.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6523-6534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This difference in localization also seems to have implications for their retention signals. In the IBV-M protein, but not in MHV-M, the first transmembrane domain appears to be sufficient for retention (Swift and Machamer, 1991Swift A.M. Machamer C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), whereas the cytoplasmic tail of the MHV-M protein, in contrast to that of IBV-M, appears to contain information for retention (Armstrong and Patel, 1991Armstrong J. Patel S. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 98: 567-575PubMed Google Scholar; Krijnse Locker et al., 1994bKrijnse Locker J. Klumperman J. Oorschot V. Horzinek M.C. Geuze H.J. Rottier P.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28263-28269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we have analyzed the oligomerization of the MHV-M protein with the aim of testing the hypothesis that retention of this protein may correlate with the formation of detergent-insoluble aggregates. COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% fetal calf serum. SA:48 cells, a kind gift of Tommy Nilsson (Imperial Cancer Research Foundation, London), were kept in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% FCS containing 200-400 μg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, Scotland). The vaccinia virus (VV) recombinants expressing the wild-type MHV-M protein (vvMHV-M) and the M protein lacking the cytoplasmic tail (vvMHV-MΔCOOH) have been described (Krijnse Locker et al., 1992bKrijnse Locker J.

The VSV-G protein was expressed using a VV recombinant expressing the tsO45 mutant of the G protein under the control of an early, 7.5 kDa, VV promotor (vvVSV-GtsO45; a kind gift of Robert Doms, University of Pennsylvania). The VV recombinant expressing the IBV-M protein (vvIBV-M) was a kind gift of Carolyn Machamer (John Hopkins University, Baltimore) and has been described before (Machamer et al., 1990Machamer C.E. Mentone S.A. Rose J.K. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6944-6948Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used to detect these proteins: the polyclonal anti-MHV serum (Rottier et al., 1981Rottier P.J.M. Horzinek M.C. van der Zeijst B.A.M. J. Virol. 1981; 40: 350-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a peptide serum recognizing the 18 COOH-terminal amino acids of the MHV-M protein (Krijnse Locker et al., 1992b); a rabbit serum raised against the VSV-G protein was a kind gift of Jean Gruenberg (University of Geneva, Switzerland); the rabbit peptide serum recognizing the IBV-M protein (Machamer et al., 1990Machamer C.E. Mentone S.A. Rose J.K. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6944-6948Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Carolyn Machamer. To detect sialyltransferase in the SA:48 cells we used the monoclonal antibody P5D4 recognizing the VSV-G P5D4 epitope (Kreis, 1986Kreis T.E. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 931-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The M and G proteins were expressed by infecting COS-1 cells grown in 35- or 60-mm dishes with the respective VV recombinants as described (Krijnse Locker et al., 1992b). Except for the IBV-M protein (see below), infected cells were pulse-labeled at 5.30 h post-infection with 100-200 μCi of 35S Express-label (NEN Dupont GmbH, Dreiech, Germany) for the indicated time. The cells were either lysed immediately or chased for 2 h before lysis. The lysis buffer consisted of 50 m M Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 62.5 m M EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma-Aldrich, Deisenhofen, Germany), 0.5% sodium deoxycholic acid (Sigma). After lysis on ice, the samples were layered on top of a continuous 15-30% (w/v) sucrose gradient layered on top of a cushion of 0.2 ml of 60% (w/v) sucrose. The sucrose solutions were in 50 m M Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 62.5 m M EDTA, 0.1% of Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% sodium deoxycholic acid. The gradients were spun for 15-16 h at 40,000 rpm and 4°C in a SW 60 rotor. Each gradient was fractionated in ten fractions of 450 μl, each fraction was diluted with 500 μl of lysis buffer and the labeled proteins they contained were immunoprecipitated with 1-3 μl of the respective antibody. The immunoprecipitation was carried out as described (Krijnse Locker et al., 1992b), and the proteins were analyzed in a 10 or 15% SDS-PAGE. The treatment with brefeldin A was carried out as described (Krijnse Locker et al., 1992aKrijnse Locker J. Griffiths G. Horzinek M.C. Rottier P.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14094-14101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The endo-β- N-acetylglucosaminidase H treatment of the VSV-G protein was as described earlier (Klumperman et al., 1994Klumperman J. Krijnse Locker J. Meier A. Horzinek M.C. Geuze H.J. Rottier P.J.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6523-6534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since the IBV-M protein was difficult to detect by immunoprecipitation, this protein was analyzed by ECL. COS cells infected with vvIBV-M were lysed as above at 9 h post-infection. The lysate was layered on a sucrose gradient and spun as described above, but the M protein present in the collected fractions was trichloroacetic acid-precipitated as follows; each fraction of the gradient was adjusted to 10% sucrose with lysis buffer, and an equal volume of 20% trichloroacetic acid, 50% acetone, and 10 μg of myoglobin as carrier was added. The samples were left on ice for 60 min, spun for 15 min at 14,000 rpm at 4°C, and the pellets were dissolved in Leammli sample buffer. The precipitates were run in a 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose (ECL, Hybond, Amersham International, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). The blot was extensively blocked with 5% milk powder in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20. The blot was incubated for 1 h with the anti-IBV-M peptide serum at a 1/1000 dilution. The secondary antibody, goat anti-rabbit conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was from Cappel (Cooper Biomedical, West Chester, PA). The IBV-M protein was detected by ECL (Amersham) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. For the estimation of the size of the M protein complexes two proteins with known s20,ω were used; catalase (11.3 s20,ω) and thyroglobulin (19.3 s20,ω) were centrifuged as described above, the proteins in the gradient fractions were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, run in SDS-PAGE, and stained with Coomassie Blue. The size estimation of the M protein and the mutant protein MΔCOOH complexes was carried out according to Martin and Ames, 1961Martin R.G. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 1372-1379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. The surface immunoprecipitation of the mutant M protein MΔCOOH was done as described (Krijnse Locker et al., 1994bKrijnse Locker J. Klumperman J. Oorschot V. Horzinek M.C. Geuze H.J. Rottier P.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28263-28269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SA:48 cells were infected with the recombinant VV expressing the MHV-M protein as described (Krijnse Locker et al., 1992b). At 6 h post-infection 16 nm bovine serum albumin-gold at an OD of 4 was added to the culture medium, as well as 100 μg/ml cycloheximide. Before fixation the cells were permeabilized with streptolysin O and fixed as described (Krijnse Locker et al., 1994aKrijnse Locker J. Ericsson M. Rottier P.J.M. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 55-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The cells were prepared for cryosectioning and subsequently double-labeled as described (Slot et al., 1988Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Weerkamp A.J. Methods Microbiol. 1988; 20: 211-236Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar, Slot et al., 1991Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Gigengack S. Lienhard G.E. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). Each gradient fraction was subjected to immunoprecipitation and the labeled proteins were separated in 15% SDS-PAGE. The gel was fixed for 1 h in 20% methanol, 7% acetic acid and dried. The quantitation of the bands was performed by PhosphorImager. In the first fraction from the bottom of the gradient as well as in the pellet we consistently observed a labeled band of approximately 25 kDa, most likely derived from VV, that almost co-migrated with the M3form of the M protein. We therefore quantitated the 25-kDa protein in the pellet fraction and substracted its value from that of the first fraction of the gradient. We have recently shown that the M protein, when expressed using a vaccinia virus recombinant localized to late Golgi and the TGN (Krijnse Locker et al., 1992aKrijnse Locker J. Griffiths G. Horzinek M.C. Rottier P.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14094-14101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, we observed that the M protein, unlike TGN38 and furin (Humphrey et al., 1993Humphrey J.S. Peters P.J. Yaun L.C. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1123-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar; Bos et al., 1993Bos K. Wraight C. Stanley K.K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2219-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar; Molloy et al., 1994Molloy S.S. Thomas L. VanSlyke J.K. Stenberg P.E. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 18-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), does not appear to recycle between the plasma membrane and the TGN (Krijnse Locker et al., 1994bKrijnse Locker J. Klumperman J. Oorschot V. Horzinek M.C. Geuze H.J. Rottier P.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28263-28269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the present study we wanted to determine in more detail how much of the M protein would reach the TGN after a 2-h chase with cycloheximide. For this we made use of a HeLa cell line stably transfected with the human α-2,6 sialyltransferase tagged on its COOH terminus (the luminal side) with the P5D4 epitope of the VSV-G protein. 2C. Rabouille, K. Hunte, B. Kiekbusch, E. Berger, G. Warren, and T. Nilsson, submitted for publication. These cells were infected with the recombinant VV expressing the M protein. Six hours after infection we treated the cells for 2 h with the endocytic marker bovine serum albumin-gold in the presence of cycloheximide. Under these conditions, by blocking protein synthesis we chased the M protein to its final location, whereas the cells internalized the gold to essentially all endocytic compartments. The intracellular distribution of the M protein was determined using the P5D4-tagged sialyltransferase as a marker of the TGN (Roth et al., 1985Roth J. Taatjes D.J. Lucocq J.M. Weinstein J. Paulson J.C. Cell. 1985; 43: 287-295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In most of the cells the M protein was clearly located on one side of the stack, co-localizing in part with sialyltransferase in the TGN (Fig. 2). Only very little label for the M protein was found in endosomes that were labeled with the internalized gold (not shown). In some cells considerable amounts of the M protein were also found throughout the Golgi stack extending beyond the label for sialyltransferase, probably due to accumulation of the protein as a result of overexpression. These data confirm earlier results showing that the MHV-M protein localizes to the trans side of the Golgi stack and to the TGN. They show in addition that under our experimental conditions we were unable to chase the M protein quantitatively into the TGN (see below). In MHV infected murine cells the two viral membrane glycoproteins, M and the spike (S), interact. This interaction can be followed by co-immunoprecipitation under specific detergent conditions (Opstelten et al., 1994aOpstelten D.-J.E. de Groote P. Horzinek M.C. Rottier P.J.M. Arch. Virol. 1994; 9 (suppl.): 319-328Google Scholar). When analyzed in sucrose gradients the complexes of the M and S proteins appeared to consist of large heterogeneous heterooligomers of M and S (Opstelten et al., 1994bOpstelten D.-J.E. Horzinek M.C. Rottier P.J.M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1994; 342: 189-195Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Since the S protein, when expressed independently as well as in infected cells, is assembled into trimers (Delmas and Laude, 1990Delmas B. Laude H. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5367-5375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) 3H. Vennema, H. Blaak, G. J-Godeke, M. Horzinek, P. Rottier, manuscript in preparation. it seemed likely that the M protein was responsible for this multimer formation. We decided, therefore, to analyze the oligomeric structure of the M protein in more detail. COS-1 cells were infected with vvMHV-M expressing the M protein. The cells were pulse-labeled and chased and lysed with the same detergent combination used previously to demonstrate the M/S complexes, consisting of 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and 0.5% sodium deoxycholic acid (Opstelten et al., 1994aOpstelten D.-J.E. de Groote P. Horzinek M.C. Rottier P.J.M. Arch. Virol. 1994; 9 (suppl.): 319-328Google Scholar; see also “Materials and Methods”). The lysates were loaded onto 15-30% sucrose gradients, centrifuged, and after fractionation the M protein was immunoprecipitated from each fraction. The unglycosylated ER form of the M protein (M0; see Fig. 1) labeled during the pulse, stayed at the top of the gradient (in the upper four fractions). However, the glycosylated Golgi forms, formed during the 60-min chase, were heterogeneously distributed over the gradient (Fig. 3 A). This heterogeneous pattern did not change after a 120-min chase or after chasing for up to 6 h (not shown). It also remained unchanged when intact, or streptolysin O permeabilized cells were treated with the cross-linker dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate), a membrane-permeable cross-linker, before lysis (not shown). It is significant to note in Fig. 3 A that the residual fraction of the M protein that did not acquire Golgi-specific modifications during the chase (M0and M1) remained in the upper fractions of the gradient. To show the M0and M1forms more clearly, an overexposed autoradiogram of the chase is shown in Fig. 3 B. When testing the effect of different detergents, CHAPS (20 m M) appeared to give a similar heterogeneous distribution of the glycosylated forms, whereas non-ionic detergents such as Triton X-100 and Nonidet P-40 failed to preserve any complexes (not shown). We next quantitated the distribution of the immunoprecipitated forms of the M protein over the different fractions by PhosphorImager (see “Materials and Methods”). As expected from Fig. 3, after the pulse labeling the bulk of the label was present at the top of the gradient, whereas after the chase the M protein was found more or less evenly distributed over the gradient with a slight increase toward the bottom (Fig. 4). In the bottom fraction we consistently noted a 25-kDa protein (as well as two other proteins that were not co-migrating with the M protein), probably derived from the vaccinia virus infection, that almost co-migrated with the M3form of the MHV-M protein. Since some of this 25-kDa protein was apparently also present in fraction number 1, we quantitated the 25-kDa protein in the bottom fraction and substracted this amount from that of the first fraction (see Fig. 3 and “Materials and Methods”). In order to estimate the size of the M protein complexes, two proteins with known s20,ω value were used as sedimentation markers. From Fig. 4 it is clear that the largest complexes of the glycosylated M protein migrated with sedimentation values larger than 19 s20,ω; the largest complexes near the bottom of the gradient migrated around 30 s20,ω. Assuming that these multimers consist of the M protein only (see “Discussion”) the complexes in the first fraction of the gradient corresponded to approximately 1000 kDa, equivalent to about 40 molecules of the M protein. Collectively these data indicate the M protein occurs in heterogeneous complexes in the Golgi complex. The specificity of the above described observations was investigated by making use of another well characterized viral membrane protein, the VSV-G protein. This latter protein, like the M protein, was expressed using a recombinant VV (see “Materials and Methods”). The trimerization of the VSV-G protein has been described in detail, and the preservation of the trimers analyzed using sucrose gradients requires a low pH (Doms et al., 1987Doms R.W. Keller D.S. Helenius A. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1957-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Likewise, using the detergent mixture used in this study that requires a neutral to alkaline pH (Helenius and Simons, 1975Helenius A. Simons K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 415: 29-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (2387) Google Scholar), the G protein remained at the top of the gradient both after the pulse labeling as well as after the chase, peaking in the second and third fraction from the top (Fig. 5). It seemed thus that the G protein migrated as a monomer, both after the pulse and after the chase. Clearly, the protein was transported through the Golgi complex during the chase, since it became almost completely endo-β- N-acetylglucosaminidase H-resistant (Fig. 5). When transport to the plasma membrane was prevented and the G protein was accumulated in the TGN by chasing at 20°C (Griffiths et al., 1985Griffiths G. Pfeiffer S. Simons K. Matlin K. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 949-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), no higher order oligomeric structures were observed under our experimental conditions (not shown). From the preceding results it is clear that the M protein occurs in heterogeneous complexes in the Golgi complex, whereas a plasma membrane protein failed to do so. Therefore, it was of interest to analyze the behavior of a mutant M protein that fails to be retained in the TGN but rather is transported to the plasma membrane. Deletion of the 22 COOH-terminal amino acids of the M protein results in the delivery of the mutant protein to the plasma membrane (Armstrong and Patel, 1991Armstrong J. Patel S. J.

https://openalex.org/W2024722013,"Two DNA clones encoding rabbit β-galactoside α1,2-fucosyltransferase (RFT-I and RFT-II) have been isolated from a rabbit genomic DNA library. The DNA sequences revealed open reading frames coding for 373 (RFT-I) and 354 (RFT-II) amino acids, respectively. The deduced amino acid sequences of RFT-I and RFT-II showed 56% identity with each other, and that of RFT-I showed 80% identity with that of human H blood type α1,2-fucosyltransferase. Northern blot analysis of embryo and adult rabbit tissues revealed that the RFT-I gene was expressed in adult brain, and that the RFT-II gene was expressed in salivary and lactating mammary glands. The identities of these enzymes were confirmed by constructing recombinant fucosyltransferases in which the N-terminal part including the cytoplasmic tail and signal anchor domain was replaced with the immunoglobulin signal peptide sequence. RFT-I expressed in COS-7 cells exhibited similar transferase activity to that of human H blood type α1,2-fucosyltransferase. RFT-II expressed in COS-7 cells showed higher affinity for type 1 (Galβ1,3GlcNAc) and type 3 (Galβ1,3GalNAc) acceptors than type 2 (Galβ1,4GlcNAc) ones, which suggested that RFT-II was a putative secretor-type α1,2-fucosyltransferase.

We previously reported histochemical investigation of glycoconjugates containing a terminal Fucα1,2Gal residue in the human and rabbit nervous systems, using polyclonal and monoclonal anti-fucosyl GM1antibodies, and UEA-1 lectin (5Kusunoki S.

The anti-fucosyl GM1antibodies and UEA-1 lectin recognized a subpopulation of neurons in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and dorsal horn of the spinal cord. The anti-fucosyl GM1antibodies also bound to the satellite cells surrounding the fucosyl GM1-positive neurons (5Kusunoki S. Inoue K. Iwamori M. Nagai Y. Mannen T.

In addition, in rabbits, the anti-fucosyl GM1antibodies bound to the axons and the myelin of the small myelinated fibers in the dorsal root, and the large neurons in the ventral horn (8Kusunoki S.

Since these fucosylated glycoconjugates showed developmental changes, especially during the perinatal period (7Kusunoki S. Inoue K. Iwamori M. Nagai Y. Mannen T. Kanazawa I. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 15: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), they may function as important molecules in the development of the nervous system, such as axon elongation or myelination. Some fucosylated glycoconjugates are known to play an important role in cell adhesion (9Bird J.M. Kimber S.J. Dev. Biol. 1984; 104: 449-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 10Fenderson B.A. Zehavi U. Hakomori S. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1591-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 11Eggens I.

However, the significance of glycoconjugates bearing a Fucα1,2Gal residue remains to be clarified. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the regulation of fucosylation and the possible functional roles of the glycoconjugates with a Fucα1,2Gal residue, molecular analysis of the α1,2-FT gene is indispensable. Recent genetic and biochemical studies indicated that human H blood-type α1,2-FT and Se-type α1,2-FT are encoded by distinct but closely linked structural genes, the H and Se genes (12Le Pendu J. Lemieux R.U. Lambert F. Dalix A.-M. Oriol R. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1982; 34: 402-415PubMed Google Scholar, 13Le Pendu J. Cartron J.P. Lemieux R.U. Oriol R. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1985; 37: 749-760PubMed Google Scholar). Enzymatic characterization of the two α1,2-FTs revealed differences in the Kmvalues for various oligosaccharide acceptors (14Sarnesto A. Köhlin T. Thurin J. Blaszczyk-Thurin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15067-15075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Sarnesto A. Köhlin T. Hindsgaul O. Thurin J. Blaszczyk-Thurin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2737-2744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further analysis of the structures and in their regulation of the α1,2-FT genes requires molecular cloning, and one α1,2-FT gene for an H blood-type determinant has been cloned so far (16Larsen R.D. Ernst L.K. Nair R.P. Lowe J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6674-6678Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). We have tried to clone rabbit α1,2-FTs in order to reveal the role of the Fucα1,2Gal epitope in the development of the nervous system. A rabbit genomic DNA library was screened, because the entire open reading frame of human H blood-type α1,2-FT is encoded by one exon (17Kelly R.J. Ernst L.K. Larsen R.D. Bryant J.G. Robinson J.S. Lowe J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5843-5847Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Here we report the molecular cloning of two types of rabbit α1,2-FTs, one of which is a counterpart of human H blood-type α1,2-FT and the other a putative Se-type α1,2-FT as judged on kinetic analysis. GDP-Fuc, phenyl-β- D-Gal, p-nitrophenyl-α- D-Gal, p-nitrophenyl-β- D-Gal, p-nitrophenyl-β- D-GalNAc, galactose β1,3- N-acetyl-glucosaminide (Galβ1,3GlcNAc), Galβ1,4GlcNAc, Galβ1,3GalNAc, lactose, Fucα1,2lactose, lacto- N-tetraose, lacto- N-neotetraose, asialofetuin, α1-acid glycoprotein, bovine submaxillary mucin, and FITC-labeled UEA-1 lectin were from Sigma. Asialo-α1-acid glycoprotein and bovine submaxillary asialomucin were obtained by mild acid treatment of the respective glycoproteins. GDP-[14C]Fuc (10.5 GBq/mmol) was from DuPont Corp. (France). GM1was from Biosynth AG (Switzerland). Paragloboside was from Dia-Iatron (Tokyo, Japan). Monoclonal antibodies to blood groups A and B were from Biomeda (Foster City, CA). FITC-labeled anti-mouse Ig(G and M) was from Tago (Burlingame, CA). Restriction endonucleases were from Takara (Kyoto, Japan). The standard molecular cloning techniques described by Maniatis and co-workers were used (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA was prepared from rabbit brain and then partially digested with Sau3AI. Size-fractionated DNA (10-15 kb) was ligated to λ-EMBL3 (Stratagene) and then packaged in vitro with the Gigapack II Gold packaging extract (Stratagene). The resulting genomic DNA library was plated using Escherichia coli strain MRA as a host for screening. The PCR fragments used as probes for screening of the rabbit genomic DNA library were amplified using primers as to the deduced catalytic region of human H blood-type α1,2-FT. Sense primer FT12, TCGTGGTCACCAGCAACGGCATG, and antisense primer FT14, TCAGAGTCTGGCAGGGTGAAGTT, were synthesized with an Applied Biosystem 394 DNA Synthesizer, and rabbit genomic DNA was used as a template for PCR. PCR amplification was carried out using a DNA thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer), with 40 cycles consisting of denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, annealing at 55°C for 30 s, and extension at 72°C for 30 s. The PCR products (229 bp) were blunt-ended, phosphorylated, and then subcloned into the EcoRV site of plasmid pBluescript SK(+). About 2 × 106plaques of the rabbit genomic DNA library were screened by the standard hybridization method with the 32P-labeled random-primed (Amersham Corp.) PCR product (229 bp) as a probe. Two independent positive plaques containing 12.6-kb (RG11) and 14.9-kb (RG101) inserts were isolated to homogeneity. The RG11 and RG101 DNA fragments were digested with appropriate restriction enzymes and then subcloned into vector plasmid pUC 119. The DNA sequences were determined by the dideoxynucleotide chain-termination method using an Autocycle DNA sequencing kit and an ALF DNA sequencer (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The sequences were analyzed using a PC/Gene (Teijin System Technology, Japan). Total RNA was prepared by the guanidium thiocyanate method and purified by ultracentrifugation through 5.7 M CsCl. Poly(A)-rich RNA was purified with Oligotex-dT30 (Takara). The poly(A)-rich RNA (5 μg) was fractionated on a denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gel (1.2%), and then transferred onto a nylon membrane (Nytran; Schleicher & Schell). Genomic DNA (10 μg) was digested for 2 h with several restriction enzymes and then loaded onto a 0.6% agarose gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was denatured (1 h) with 0.5 N NaOH and 1.5 M NaCl, and then the DNA was transferred to a nylon membrane. Both Northern and Southern filters were prehybridized in 50% formamide, 5 × SSPE, 5 × Denhardt's, 0.5% SDS, 0.25% sodium lauryl sarcosine, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA at 37°C for 2 h. Hybridization was then performed overnight at 37°C with the PstI fragment (680 bp) for RFT-I and with the NaeI fragment (446 bp) for RFT-II labeled with 32P, using the random priming method. The filters were washed twice in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65°C, and finally in 0.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65°C for 30 min. A SmaI fragment (1.5 kb) of RG11 DNA containing the full open reading frame of RFT-I was ligated into mammalian expression vector pcD-SRα (19Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which had previously been digested with EcoRI, blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase, and dephosphorylated with bacterial alkaline phosphatase. RG101 DNA was digested with SalI and partially digested with XhoI, and a XhoI- SalI fragment (2.3 kb) containing the full open reading frame of RFT-II was ligated into pcD-SRα, which had previously been digested with XhoI and then dephosphorylated. The single insertion in the correct orientation was finally analyzed with restriction enzymes. To express the soluble forms of RFT-I and RFT-II, comprising recombinant fucosyltransferases in which the N-terminal part was replaced with the immunoglobulin signal peptide sequence, expression plasmids pUGS-RFT-I and pUGS-RFT-II were constructed. The genes encoding the putative catalytic domain and 3′-untranslated region were specifically amplified by PCR using a synthetic sense primer, 5′-TGTCTGGAATTCCAGCCGGTGCCAGCCCC-3′, and an antisense primer, 5′-TCTCCCGAATTCTGCCCAGGTAGAATCACT-3′, for RFT-I, and another sense primer, 5′-GTGGTCGAATTCCCCGGACACCTACCCC-3′, and another antisense primer, 5′-AAGTCTGAATTCAGACTCCGTGTGGGATCC-3′, for RFT-II (synthetic EcoRI site underlined). The amplified DNA fragments were digested with EcoRI and then ligated into the EcoRI site of pUGS (20Kurosawa N. Hamamoto T. Lee Y.-C. Nakaoka T. Kojima N. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1402-1409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to generate pUGS-RFT-I and pUGS-RFT-II. The fusion constructs were verified by DNA sequencing to confirm fusion junction sequences. COS-7 cells (100-mm culture dish) were transiently transfected with 10 μg of pcD-SRα-RFT-I or pcD-SRα-RFT-II using the DEAE-dextran procedure (21McCutchan J.H. Pagano J.S. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1968; 41: 351-357PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were trypsinized and divided into several smaller dishes 24 h post-transfection. The cells were stained with FITC-labeled UEA-1 lectin or with monoclonal antibodies to blood group A or B at 72 h post-transfection. After washing with PBS, the cells were fixed with formaldehyde for 3 min, washed, and then incubated in 3% bovine serum albumin/PBS. After washing briefly with PBS, the cells were incubated in 2 ng/ml FITC-labeled UEA-1 lectin in 3% bovine serum albumin/PBS for 1.5 h, or in monoclonal antibodies to blood group A or B for 1.5 h, and then washed with PBS, followed by incubation with FITC-labeled anti-mouse Ig(G and M) for 1 h. After washing three times with PBS, the cells were observed under a fluorescence microscope. The cells from another dish were washed with PBS and then with 25 m M MES for 10 min, and then collected with a rubber policemen and pelleted by centrifugation. The pellets were resuspended in cold 1% Triton X-100 and then sonicated briefly (22Rajan V.P. Larsen R.D. Ajmera S. Ernst L.K. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11158-11167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain the soluble forms, COS-7 cells (100-mm culture dish) were transiently transfected with 10 μg of pUGS-RFT-I or pUGS-RFT-II by the DEAE-dextran method. The culture medium was concentrated 10-fold on Centricon 30 filters (Amicon) and then subjected to the fucosyltransferase assay. The fucosyltransferase assays were performed according to the previous report (22Rajan V.P. Larsen R.D. Ajmera S. Ernst L.K. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11158-11167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in a mixture of 25 m M sodium phosphate (pH 6.1), 5 m M ATP, 30 μM GDP-fucose, 3 μM GDP-[14C]fucose (10.5 Bq/pmol), the enzyme solution and substrates in a final volume of 10 μl. Each reaction mixture was incubated at 37°C for 2 h, and then applied to a Silica Gel 60 HPTLC plate (Merck, Germany). The plate was developed with ethanol:pyridine:1-butanol:water:acetic acid (100:10:10:30:3) for oligosaccharide acceptors, and with chloroform:methanol:0.5% CaCl2(55:45:10) for glycolipid acceptors, respectively. When glycolipids and benzyl-oligosaccharides were used as substrates, the reaction mixture was applied to C-18 Sep-Pak cartridge (Waters-Millipore), washed with 2 ml of water, and then eluted with 1 ml of methanol. The eluate was then applied to a HPTLC plate and developed. The radioactivity on each plate was visualized and determined with a BAS2000 radioimage analyzer (Fuji Film, Japan). A DNA fragment (229 bp; Fig. 2 A, underlined) was obtained by PCR amplification with sense primer FT-12 and antisense primer FT-14 from rabbit genomic DNA. To obtain DNA encoding rabbit α1,2-FT, a rabbit genomic DNA library was screened with the PCR product as a probe. Two positive clones, RG11 (Fig. 1 A) and RG101 (Fig. 1 B), were obtained. Sequence analysis revealed that RG11 contained an entire open reading frame, encoding 373 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 42 kDa (RFT-I, Fig. 2 A) and that RG101 contained an entire open reading frame, encoding 354 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 40 kDa (RFT-II, Fig. 2 B).FIG. 1Restriction maps for RG11 (A) and RG101 (B), and the sequence-analysis strategy. The coding region is depicted as a shaded box and the non-coding region as a solid line. The arrows indicate the direction and extent of sequencing.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Comparison of the primary structure of RFT-I and RFT-II revealed 56% of significant amino acid identity (Fig. 2 C). Deduced amino acid sequences of RFT-I and RFT-II showed 80% and 55% identity with that of human α1,2-FT, respectively. When the entire coding region was used as a probe, more than one band was detected on genomic Southern blot analysis. We then used the PstI fragment (680 bp) of RFT-I and the NaeI fragment (446 bp) of RFT-II as probes that hybridized to one band on Southern blotting (data not shown). Northern blot analysis revealed that a 3.8-kb mRNA of RFT-I was expressed in adult cerebrum and cerebellum (Fig. 3 A), and that a 1.6-kb mRNA of RFT-II was detected in salivary and lactating mammary glands (Fig. 3 B). The transcription of RFT-I in brain was first detected on embryonic day 28 and increased thereafter. The probe for RFT-II did not hybridize to embryonic tissues. Cell extracts from COS-7 cells transfected with pcD-SRα-RFT-I or pcD-SRα-RFT-II, and concentrated culture medium from COS-7 cells transfected with pUGS-RFT-I or pUGS-RFT-II were subjected to the fucosyltransferase assay. When phenyl-β- D-Gal was used as a substrate, radiolabeled fucose was incorporated into the substrate with any of the enzyme preparations (Fig. 4), which meant both RFT-I and RFT-II were fucosyltransferases. FITC-labeled UEA-1 lectin staining, however, showed that pcD-SRα-RFT-I transfected COS-7 cells were positive but that pcD-SRα-RFT-II transfected COS-7 cells were negative (Fig. 5), which suggested differences in acceptor specificity between RFT-I and RFT-II. COS-7 cells transfected with pcD-SRα-RFT-I or pcD-SRα-RFT-II were positive for blood group A, but both were negative for blood group B (Fig. 5).FIG. 5Expression of UEA-1 lectin-reactive glycoconjugates and blood group A antigens on RFT-I and RFT-II transfected COS-7 cells. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with 10 μg of pcD-SRα, pcD-SRα-RFT-I, or pcD-SRα-RFT-II using the DEAE-dextran procedure. The cells were divided into five dishes by trypsinization 24 h post-transfection, and were stained with UEA-1 lectin, anti-blood group A or B antibodies, or negative control IgG 72 h post-transfection. Transfection of RFT-I or RFT-II was verified by measuring fucosyltransferase activity using cell extract from another dish.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because the fucosyltransferase activity of the cell extracts was virtually identical with and stronger than that of concentrated culture medium, respectively, the cell extracts were used for further kinetic analysis. Both RFT-I and RFT-II could transfer fucose to pNP-β-Gal but not to pNP-α-Gal or pNP-β-GalNAc. Both enzymes could also fucosylate lactose to form fucosyl lactose, which comigrated with Fucα1,2lactose on HPTLC with several solvent systems. As shown in Table I, RFT-I exhibited almost the same reactivity with type 1 (Galβ1,3GlcNAc), type 2 (Galβ1,4GlcNAc), and type 3 (Galβ1,3GalNAc) acceptors, but RFT-II showed higher reactivity with type 1 or type 3 than type 2 acceptors. Lineweaver-Burk plots for LNT, LNnT, phenyl-β- D-Gal, and types 1, 2, and 3 oligosaccharides are shown in Fig. 6. RFT-I and RFT-II could transfer fucose not only to asialoglycoproteins but also to glycolipids. Experiments were performed in triplicate, and typical plots and values of Kmand Vmax / Kmwere shown in Fig. 6 and Table I, respectively.Table I:Acceptor specificities of RFT-I and RFT-IIThe table shows the apparent Kmand Vmax / Kmvalues and relative activities as to the incorporation of fucose into phenyl-β- D-Gal as a substrate.FIG. 6Lineweaver-Burk plots.

RFT-I and RFT-II catalyze the transfer of GDP-fucose to a β-Gal residue but not to α-Gal or β-GalNAc. Fucosyl lactose formed from fucose and lactose by both enzymes comigrated with standard Fucα1,2lactose on HPTLC with several solvent systems. COS-7 cells transfected with RFT-I were stained with UEA-1 lectin, which is thought to recognize the fucosylated type 2 chain of glycoproteins with an α1,2 linkage (23Pereira M.E.A. Kisailus E.C. Gruezo F. Kabat E.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 185: 108-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Whereas COS-7 cells maintain N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase activity, both RFT-I and RFT-II transfected COS-7 cells were positive for monoclonal antibodies to blood group A, which is specific to GalNAcα1,4-(Fucα1,2)-β-galactoside. These observations support the notion that RFT-I and RFT-II could be α1,2-FTs. The deduced amino acid sequence of RFT-I showed 80% identity with that of human H blood-type α1,2-FT (16Larsen R.D. Ernst L.K. Nair R.P. Lowe J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6674-6678Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), whereas the deduced amino acid sequence of RFT-II showed 55% and 56% identity with those of RFT-I and human H blood-type α1,2-FT, respectively. The Km values of RFT-I are comparable for phenyl-β- D-Gal, and types 1, 2, and 3 acceptors, which suggests that the binding specificity of RFT-I is primarily restricted to terminal β- D-Gal residues of acceptors. This observation is consistent with the kinetic properties of human H blood-type α1,2-FT (14Sarnesto A. Köhlin T. Thurin J. Blaszczyk-Thurin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15067-15075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RFT-I exhibited reactivity with glycolipids that share the same terminal determinant with a free oligosaccharide, but there were some discrepancies regarding the reactivity of H blood-type α1,2-FT with glycolipids among previous reports (14Sarnesto A. Köhlin T. Thurin J. Blaszczyk-Thurin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15067-15075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Pacuszka T. Koscielak J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 64: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 25Beyer T.A. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5373-5379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The structural and kinetic characteristics support that RFT-I is a rabbit counterpart of human H blood-type α1,2-FT. Human H blood-type α1,2-FT is expressed in tissues of mesodermal origin (1Watkins W.M. Adv. Hum. Genet. 1980; 10: 1-136PubMed Google Scholar, 12Le Pendu J. Lemieux R.U. Lambert F. Dalix A.-M. Oriol R. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1982; 34: 402-415PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the expression of RFT-I is limited in the brain. It is not uncommon that an expression pattern differs from species to species. RFT-II has higher affinity to types 1 and 3 acceptors than type 2 ones. It exhibits significantly lower affinity for phenyl-β- D-Gal and type 2 acceptors, compared with RFT-I. The kinetic parameters of RFT-II are comparable with those of human Se-type α1,2-FT, which has higher affinity for types 1 and 3 acceptors than type 2 ones and phenyl-β- D-Gal (15Sarnesto A. Köhlin T. Hindsgaul O. Thurin J. Blaszczyk-Thurin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2737-2744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transcription distribution of RFT-II in secretory glands is similar to that of human Se-type α1,2-FT (13Le Pendu J. Cartron J.P. Lemieux R.U. Oriol R. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1985; 37: 749-760PubMed Google Scholar). We conclude that RFT-II is a rabbit counterpart of putative human Se-type α1,2-FT. RFT-II transfected COS-7 cells were negative for UEA-1 lectin staining but were positive for blood group A. RFT-II is possibly unable to accept type 2 glycochains as acceptors, and, in this case, the blood group A antigens of RFT-II transfected COS-7 cells comprise type 1 glycochains. Another possible explanation is that RFT-II transfers fucose in a lower amount to type 2 glycochains, which are then completely converted to blood group A active molecules. Comparison of the rabbit α1,2-FTs and recently cloned rat DNA fragments of the putative α1,2-FTs (26Piau J.-P. Labarriere N. Dabouis G. Denis M.G. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 623-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) revealed that the deduced amino acid sequence of RFT-I showed more homology with that of rat FTA (84% identity) than with that of rat FTB (72% identity). The deduced amino acid sequence of RFT-II showed 74% and 80% identity with those of rat FTA and rat FTB, respectively. However, this does not necessarily mean that rat FTA and FTB are genes corresponding to RFT-I and RFT-II, respectively, because there might be additional and closely related α1,2-FTs other than RFT-I and RFT-II. Molecular cloning of the entire genes and kinetic analysis of putative rat α1,2-FTs are necessary before coming to a conclusion regarding the relationship between RFT-I, RFT-II, and rat FTA and FTB. Our previous histochemical study revealed that the expression of fucosyl GM1and UEA-1 lectin reactive antigens was strictly regulated during development, especially during the perinatal period (7Kusunoki S. Inoue K. Iwamori M. Nagai Y. Mannen T. Kanazawa I. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 15: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 8Kusunoki S. Chiba A. Shimizu T. Kanazawa I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1214: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In rabbit DRG neurons, fucosyl GM1is readily detected immunohistochemically on embryonic day 25, followed by the appearance of UEA-1 lectin-reactive antigens postnatally (7Kusunoki S. Inoue K. Iwamori M. Nagai Y. Mannen T. Kanazawa I. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 15: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). UEA-1 lectin-reactive antigens of DRG neurons in postnatal rabbits could be formed through fucosylation catalyzed by RFT-I, although we could not analyze the developmental expression pattern of RFT-I in DRG because of the scarcity of the tissue and the relative non-abundance of RFT-I expression. On the contrary, fucosyl GM1observed in DRG neurons of embryonic day 25 rabbits might not be the product of RFT-I because UEA-1 lectin-reactive antigens are not detected at that stage. This observation suggests the existence of another type of α1,2-FT that catalyzes preferential fucosylation of glycolipids. We thank Drs. Nobuyuki Kurosawa, Takashi Nakaoka, Naoya Kojima, and Toshiro Hamamoto for helpful discussions."

(1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 15943-15951). In this work, we have directly probed this region for actin binding sites using five peptide analogs covering different stretches of the sequence Thr133-Ile163. Co-sedimentation with F-actin, actomyosin ATPase measurements, and zero-length cross-linking reactions demonstrated that the 19-residue sequence Ala145-Ile163is essential for actin interaction and ATPase inhibition. Furthermore, each peptide was tested for binding to the Ca2+-dependent proteins, caltropin and calmodulin, in both an actomyosin ATPase assay and an affinity chromatographic assay. The results revealed the 11-residue segment Gln153-Ile163, representing the COOH-terminal moiety of the F-actin binding sequence, as a crucial region for the high affinity binding of these regulatory proteins with concomitant removal of the ATPase inhibition. The 153-163 stretch contained also interactive sites for tropomyosin as assessed by affinity chromatography and spectrofluorometry. Collectively, the data support our initial results and highlight the ability of the multifunctional 145-163 region to serve as a potent regulatory domain of the smooth muscle calponin. Earlier, we proposed that the interaction of gizzard calponin with F-actin, promoting the inhibition of the actomyosin ATPase activity, involves the NH2-termi-nal portion of the calponin segment Ala145-Tyr182(Mezgueldi, M., Fattoum, A., Derancourt, J., and Kassab, R.

Collectively, the data support our initial results and highlight the ability of the multifunctional 145-163 region to serve as a potent regulatory domain of the smooth muscle calponin. Smooth muscle calponin is an actin- and tropomyosin-binding protein which may modulate at the thin filament level the actin-myosin interactions and force generation (1Takahashi K. Hiwada K. Kokubu T.

Solution studies and in vitro motility assays have shown that its binding to F-actin or F-actin-tropomyosin promotes the inhibition of the actin-stimulated myosin ATPase (4Winder S.J. Walsh M.P. J.

This inhibitory activity can be reversed by complexation of calponin to a calcium-dependent protein, like calmodulin, caltropin, or protein S100b (10Wills F.L. Mc Cubbin W.D. Kay C.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 11Wills F.L. Mc Cubbin W.D. Kay C.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5562-5569Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) as well as by its site-specific phosphorylation by protein kinase C or Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (4Winder S.J.

The identification of a calponin phosphatase has suggested that a cycle of phosphorylation-dephosphorylation of the protein may regulate the cross-bridge activity in vivo (4Winder S.J. Walsh M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10148-10155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Winder S.J. Pato M.D. Walsh M.P. Biochem.

Physiol. 1994; 427: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The recently described occurrence of calponin in the actomyosin domain of the smooth muscle cell further strengthens its proposed involvement in the regulation of smooth muscle contraction (17North A.J. Gimona M. Cross R.A. Small J.V. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 437-444PubMed Google Scholar). To define the molecular basis of calponin functions, we have earlier investigated the distribution of its regulatory F-actin and calmodulin interactive sites over three chymotryptic fragments isolated from gizzard calponin and accounting for its entire primary structure (18Mezgueldi M. Fattoum A. Derancourt J. Kassab R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15943-15951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that all the known biological activities of the protein were associated with its NH2-terminal segment spanned by residues 7-182 whereas no detectable function was displayed by the remaining COOH-terminal 183-292 region. Essentially similar observations were subsequently reported by others (13Nakamura F. Mino T. Yamamoto J. Naka M. Tanaka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6194-6201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most importantly, our studies, using proteolytic digestions and zero-length cross-linking of the F-actin-calponin complex, strongly suggested but did not prove that the inhibitory binding of actin takes place on the 38-residue stretch between Ala145and Tyr182, the most exposed and protease-sensitive region on the surface of calponin (3Takahashi K. Nadal-Ginard B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 226: 13284-13288Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Residues present toward the amino-terminal end of this sequence have been proposed to interact with actin. Our data also led to the conclusion that the segment spanning amino acids 61-182 includes major determinants for the recognition of F-actin, calmodulin, and tropomyosin. More recently, the binding stoichiometry for the complex of calponin and calmodulin or caltropin was determined to be 1:2 with the interaction of either calcium-dependent protein at a low and at a high affinity site on the calponin molecule (10Wills F.L. Mc Cubbin W.D. Kay C.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 11Wills F.L. Mc Cubbin W.D. Kay C.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5562-5569Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The existence of the two different sites was confirmed by briefly described titration analyses of the binding of the former proteins to a recombinant fragment of calponin spanning residues 1-228 (19Wills F.L. Mc Cubbin W.D. Gimona M. Strasser P. Kay C.M. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 198aGoogle Scholar); these data further indicated that the weaker binding site was within the NH2-terminal segment 2-51 and the stronger binding site was residing between residues 52 and 228, a region which also comprises our putative inhibitory F-actin interactive domain. However, the functional and structural relationships between the latter crucial site and the pair of sites involved in the recognition of the calcium-dependent proteins remain to be elucidated. In the present work, we have assessed the functional coupling between the actin site and the site of tight binding of the calcium-dependent proteins, by determining more precisely the relative location of their respective critical determinants within the covalent structure of calponin. Taking advantage of our recent findings with caldesmon revealing the juxtaposition of the regulatory F-actin and calmodulin binding sequences on the primary structure of its COOH-terminal domain (20Mezgueldi M. Derancourt J. Calas B. Kassab R. Fattoum A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12824-12832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we have synthesized a series of oligopeptides corresponding to different stretches of the calponin amino acid sequence from Thr133to Ile163. This segment encompasses the NH2-terminal moiety of our proposed F-actin binding region of residues 145-182 (18Mezgueldi M. Fattoum A. Derancourt J. Kassab R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15943-15951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have probed in detail their biological properties using F-actin co-sedimentation, actomyosin-S-1 ATPase assays, cross-linking reactions with F-actin or calmodulin, and affinity chromatography over immobilized calmodulin or tropomyosin. The data demonstrate for the first time the direct interaction of the 19-residue segment Ala145-Ile163with F-actin, Ca2+-calmodulin, Ca2+-caltropin, and tropomyosin. Its complexation to actin occurs competitively with the binding of the functional calponin fragment of residues 7-182 and causes the inhibition of ATPase activation in a calmodulin- or caltropin-regulated manner, whereas its association with tropomyosin was without consequences. The interaction of the calcium-dependent proteins and tropomyosin was restricted to the COOH-terminal portion Gln153-Ile163; in contrast, actin recognition required the entire 145-163 segment. These studies highlight several interaction properties of calponin and provide the experimental evidence for the previously assigned location of its inhibitory actin binding site (18Mezgueldi M. Fattoum A. Derancourt J. Kassab R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15943-15951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They also suggest that the multifunctional features of the 145-163 sequence combined with its close proximity in calponin primary structure to the phosphorylatable residues, Ser175/Thr184, are likely reflecting the ability of this particular region to act as a potent regulatory domain of the native protein. α-Chymotrypsin was purchased from Worthington Biochemical Corp. Calmodulin-Sepharose and CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. The latter material was coupled to tropomyosin according to the manufacturer's specifications. Fmoc amino acids were obtained from Milligen (Millipore). 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) 1The abbreviations used are:EDC1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimideNHSN-hydroxysuccinimideHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyCaTcaltropinCaMcalmodulinCaPcalponinTMtropomyosin. and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) were from Sigma and Serva, Heidelberg, respectively. 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide N-hydroxysuccinimide high performance liquid chromatography caltropin calmodulin calponin tropomyosin. Calponin and tropomyosin from fresh turkey gizzards, F-actin, and chymotryptic myosin subfragment-1 (S-1) from rabbit skeletal muscle were prepared as described previously (18Mezgueldi M. Fattoum A. Derancourt J. Kassab R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15943-15951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bovine brain calmodulin and chicken gizzard caltropin were purified by published procedures (20Mezgueldi M. Derancourt J. Calas B. Kassab R. Fattoum A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12824-12832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Mani R.S. Kay C.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1398-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Tropomyosin was labeled at Cys190with pyrene- N-maleimide as reported earlier (22Lehrer S.S. Betteridge D.R. Graceffa P. Wong S. Seidel J.C. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1591-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The 22-kDa and 13-kDa NH2-terminal chymotryptic fragments of calponin (CH22 and CH13N, respectively) were produced according to Mezgueldi et al. (18Mezgueldi M. Fattoum A. Derancourt J. Kassab R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15943-15951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and were purified over immobilized tropomyosin. Synthetic peptides were prepared and purified as reported earlier (20Mezgueldi M. Derancourt J. Calas B. Kassab R. Fattoum A. J. Biol.

They were subjected to amino acid analysis, sequence determination, and molecular mass measurement using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The concentrations of S-1, F-actin, tropomyosin, calmodulin, caltropin, and calponin were measured spectrophotometrically using A1%280nm = 7.5, 11.7, 2.2, 2.0, 6.8, and 7.0 (18Mezgueldi M. Fattoum A.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1398-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), respectively. The concentration of the chymotryptic or synthetic peptides was determined from their absorbance at 280 nm and calculated on the basis of their tryptophan content (24Gill S.C. Von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5059) Google Scholar). The concentrations obtained were in good agreement with those determined from the amino acid composition. The concentrations of TY12, AF8, and QI11 were estimated by amino acid analysis. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out in 3-18% or 7.5-20% gradient acrylamide gels (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207192) Google Scholar). The running buffer was 50 m M Tris, 100 m M boric acid, pH 8.0. Marker peptides used were myoglobin CNBr fragments: 2.6 kDa, 6.4 kDa, 14.6 kDa, and 17.2 kDa. The immunoblotting with polyclonal actin antibodies was performed as reported earlier (18Mezgueldi M. Fattoum A. Derancourt J. Kassab R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15943-15951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction of F-actin and peptides was analyzed by co-sedimentation in 10 m M imidazole-HCl, 30 m M NaCl, 2 m M MgCl2, 1 m M NaN3, pH 7.0, using a Beckman Airfuge at 140,000 × g, for 30 min at 25°C. The pellets were homogenized in the same buffer and analyzed either qualitatively by gel electrophoresis or quantitatively by HPLC on a reverse-phase Aquapore C-8 column (4 mm × 250 mm) eluted with 0-60% acetonitrile gradient containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (20Mezgueldi M. Derancourt J. Calas B. Kassab R. Fattoum A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12824-12832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Calponin or its 22-kDa fragment was treated with chymotrypsin at 25°C using a protease to substrate weight ratio of 1:100, in 10 m M imidazole HCl, 30 m M NaCl, 2 m M MgCl2, 1 m M NaN3, pH 7.0. At the desired time intervals (0-60 min), protein aliquots were analyzed by gel electrophoresis and assayed for inhibition of the acto-S-1 ATPase after the addition of 2.5 m M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. TW31 (0.15 mg/ml) in 10 m M imidazole HCl, 30 m M NaCl, 2 m M MgCl2, 1 m M NaN3, pH. 7.0, was mixed with F-actin (0.21 mg/ml) (TW31:actin molar ratio = 8:1) in the presence of 2 m M EDC and 5 m M NHS. The reaction was carried out at 25°C for 0-30 min in the absence or presence of Ca2+-calmodulin (5.5 mg/ml) (TW31:Ca2+-calmodulin molar ratio = 1:8) and was monitored by SDS-gel electrophoresis. The binding of peptides to calmodulin was assayed by calmodulin-Sepharose affinity chromatography as described previously (20Mezgueldi M. Derancourt J. Calas B. Kassab R. Fattoum A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12824-12832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Affinity chromatography of the peptides over tropomyosin-Sepharose was performed in 10 m M Tris-HCl, 10 m M KCl, 1 m M MgCl2, 0.1 m M dithiothreitol, and 1 m M NaN3, pH 7.0. Bound peptides were eluted with the same buffer containing 200 m M KCl. Fluorescence emission spectra of the calmodulin-TW31 complex and of the complexes between pyrene-tropomyosin and synthetic peptides were recorded as reported earlier (20Mezgueldi M. Derancourt J. Calas B. Kassab R. Fattoum A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12824-12832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Lehrer S.S. Betteridge D.R. Graceffa P. Wong S. Seidel J.C. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1591-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The Mg2+-ATPase of the skeletal acto-S-1 was determined in a medium (1 ml) containing 50 m M Tris-HCl, 5 m M ATP, 10 m M KCl, 2.5 m M MgCl2, pH 7.5, using 0.42 mg/ml F-actin and 0.050 mg/ml S-1. Piwas determined colorimetrically as described previously (18Mezgueldi M. Fattoum A. Derancourt J. Kassab R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15943-15951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Effect of the Limited Chymotryptic Digestion of the Calponin Fragment of Residues 7-182 on Its Inhibitory Activity-When the isolated 22-kDa NH2-terminal chymotryptic fragment of calponin spanning amino acids 7-182 was further incubated with chymotrypsin at a protease to substrate weight ratio of 1:100, it was rapidly and quantitatively converted into the stable peptide designated CH13N (Fig. 1 A). Earlier, this component was shown to derive from the cleavage, under identical conditions, of the intact calponin at Tyr144-Ala145and was identified as the NH2-terminal segment of residues 7-144 (18Mezgueldi M. Fattoum A. Derancourt J. Kassab R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15943-15951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Vancompernolle K. Gimona M. Herzog M. Van Damme J. Vandekerckhove J. Small V. FEBS Lett. 1990; 274: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, the direct proteolysis of the 22-kDa fragment did result only in the excision of its COOH-terminal 38-residue stretch, between Ala145and Tyr182, thought to contain the inhibitory actin-binding region (18Mezgueldi M. Fattoum A. Derancourt J. Kassab R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15943-15951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most interestingly, when the whole digest of the 22-kDa peptide was subjected in parallel to acto-S-1 ATPase assays during the entire course of the proteolytic process, no change in the inhibitory capability of the peptide was noticed even after a 60-min reaction (Fig. 1 B). The digestion, under the same experimental conditions, of the parent calponin, used as control, also failed to alter significantly the extent of ATPase inhibition. The initial 70% inhibition of the activity tended to level off to the same value (≃60%) as that found for the digested 22-kDa fragment (Fig. 1 B). These observations strongly suggest that the proteolysis had no deleterious effect on the major structural determinants for specific binding to F-actin that are still operant in the released 38-residue peptide or in its chymotryptic subfragments. There is no doubt that only the presence of the latter fragment(s) in the digest solution is responsible for the observed maintenance of the ATPase inhibition since, as indicated in Fig. 1 C, only the intact 22-kDa fragment but not its isolated 13-kDa NH2-terminal portion could inhibit the acto-S-1 ATPase in a concentration-dependent manner. The inefficiency of the 13-kDa fragment was not caused by its isolation since, earlier, we have shown that this material did not co-sediment with F-actin directly added to the total digest of calponin (18Mezgueldi M.

Also, all of the 13-kDa peptide remained in the supernatant upon centrifugation of a mixture of F-actin and the 60-min digest of the 22-kDa peptide (data not shown). The apparent conservation of the inhibitory function in the proteolytically detached 145-182 region encouraged us to prepare various synthetic peptides covering the NH2-terminal sequence 145-163 as probes of the interaction between actin and this region. The peptides we have synthesized corresponded to different stretches of the main sequence Thr133-Ile163. In some peptides, Ile163was replaced by a tryptophan residue. This amino acid conferred characteristic spectral features without influencing the biological activities of the peptide as verified by comparing the functional properties of the peptide analogs comprising either isoleucine or tryptophan at position 163. The synthetic peptides used in this study were designated TW31 (spanning the 31-residue sequence Thr133-Trp163), TY12 (spanning the 12-residue sequence Thr133-Tyr144), AW19 (spanning the 19-residue sequence Ala145-Trp163), AF8 (spanning the 8-residue sequence Ala145-Phe152), and QI11 (spanning the 11-residue sequence Gln153-Ile163). Each peptide represented a single major component showing less than 2% impurity as assessed by reversed-phase HPLC and mass spectrometry (Fig. 2). Amino acid composition analyses, sequence determinations, and molecular masses were consistent with the expected sequences. All peptides were readily soluble in aqueous buffer. We investigated comparatively their binding to F-actin by co-sedimentation as well as by EDC cross-linking in the absence or presence of Ca2+-calmodulin. We also tested their ability to inhibit the acto-S-1 ATPase and the influence of the Ca2+-dependent proteins, caltropin and calmodulin, on their inhibitory activity. Following centrifugation of each peptide in the absence or presence of F-actin (actin:peptide molar ratio, 1:8), the corresponding pellets and supernatants were analyzed either by electrophoresis on a 7.5-20% gradient acrylamide gel or by reverse-phase HPLC. As illustrated in Fig. 3, TW31 and AW19 displayed significant binding to F-actin, and no pelleting of either peptide occurred without actin. The peptide analogs including isoleucine instead of tryptophan at the COOH terminus behaved essentially similarly (data not shown). Because TY12 (Fig. 3) as well as AF8 and QI11 were small-sized peptides, their respective pellet and supernatant fractions could not be analyzed by gel electrophoresis and were subjected to reverse-phase HPLC. No trace of either peptide was found associated with F-actin (data not shown). The actin-binding peptides TW31 and AW19 share a common sequence, spanned by Ala145-Ile(Trp)163, which must include the critical determinants for F-actin binding; this proposal is consistent with the absence of F-actin binding to the difference peptide TY12. On the other hand, the lack of actin interaction with its separated NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal moieties, represented by AF8 and QI11, respectively, strongly suggests that the structural integrity of the full-length 19-residue sequence between Ala145and Ile163is required for F-actin recognition. To assess that the latter critical sequence also significantly contributes to the complexation of the functional 22-kDa chymotryptic fragment of calponin (residues 7-182) to F-actin, we investigated the competition between this fragment and TW31 for binding to F-actin. Fig. 4, A and B, shows the potency of TW31 to displace the proteolytic fragment from actin in a concentration-dependent manner. About 60% of the bound fragment was dissociated from actin at a TW31:CH22 molar ratio near 10. This finding indicates that TW31 competes with CH22 for a common binding site on F-actin. Previously, we have shown that native calponin or CH22 could be specifically cross-linked to F-actin by EDC, and we identified the cross-linked site on the actin carboxyl-terminal region between residues 326 and 355 (18Mezgueldi M. Fattoum A. Derancourt J. Kassab R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15943-15951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The actin binding activity observed for the synthetic TW31 led us to analyze its EDC cross-linking to F-actin. The time course of the reaction is depicted in Fig. 5 A, lane c, using a molar ratio of actin to peptide of 1:8. A new major species of 45 kDa, migrating just above the actin monomer, was generated and its yield increased with the reaction time. It was immunostained with the actin antibodies (Fig. 5 B). The 45-kDa derivative likely represents a 1:1 molar covalent complex of actin and TW31. Its production strongly suggests that the zero-length cross-linking of either calponin or CH22 to F-actin reported earlier (18Mezgueldi M. Fattoum A. Derancourt J. Kassab R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15943-15951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was mediated by the active sequence Ala145-Ile163. Significantly, Fig. 5 A, lane g, shows that the formation of the 45-kDa adduct is almost completely suppressed in the presence of Ca2+-calmodulin added at an 8-fold molar excess over the synthetic peptide. Instead, a new entity of 21 kDa, with a mobility slightly lower than calmodulin, was progressively produced. The same species was also detected, under the same conditions, by reacting a Ca2+-calmodulin and TW31 mixture with the cross-linking reagents (Fig. 5 A, lane e). The 21-kDa band did not appear in the presence of EGTA (data not shown) and when Ca2+-calmodulin or TW31 was separately treated with EDC (Fig. 5, lanes d and b, respectively). Furthermore, the preformed 21-kDa material failed to co-sediment with added F-actin both in the absence or presence of calcium (Fig. 5 C). These results are consistent with the idea that the 21-kDa material is resulting from a specific conjugation between TW31 and Ca2+-calmodulin whose reversible or permanent attachment to the peptide interferes with F-actin recognition. This conclusion implies that the sequence Ala145-Ile163harbors interactive sites not only for F-actin but also for Ca2+-calmodulin.FIG. 5EDC cross-linking of the F-actin-TW31 and Ca2+-calmodulin-TW31 complexes. A, F-actin and TW31 mixed at a 1:8 molar ratio were covalently coupled with EDC-NHS as described under “Experimental Procedures.” At the times indicated, the cross-linking reaction was analyzed by 3-18% gradient acrylamide gel electrophoresis in the absence (lane c) or presence (lane g) of Ca2+-calmodulin.

The supernatants (lanes a and c) and the pellets (lanes b and d) were examined by gel electrophoresis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As depicted in Fig. 6 A, TW31 as well as AW19 inhibited significantly the skeletal acto-S-1 ATPase activity in a dose-dependent manner. The presence of tropomyosin in the ATPase assays did not affect their inhibitory potency. In contrast, the three other peptides, TY12, AF18, and QI11, which were unable to co-sediment with F-actin, were inefficient. When the inhibition of ATPase by TW31 was related to the amount of peptide bound to actin, it was found that at least 70% inhibition was reached with about 1 mol of peptide bound/mol of actin (Fig. 6 B). Thus, the actin binding sequence Ala145-Ile163also promotes the ATPase inhibition. Moreover, Fig. 7 shows that the addition of Ca2+-calmodulin or Ca2+-caltropin leads to the reversal of a large extent of the peptide inhibition. In the absence of calcium, no effect was observed at any concentration of either protein (data not shown). As previously reported for the inhibition by native calponin (11Wills F.L. Mc Cubbin W.D. Kay C.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5562-5569Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), caltropin was at least twice as efficient as calmodulin in restoring the acto-S-1 ATPase inhibited by AW19. The data clearly indicate that the interaction of the Ca2+-binding proteins with the stretch Ala145-Ile163is functionally coupled with the binding of F-actin to adjacent or overlapping sites within the same region.FIG. 7Reversal of the AW19 inhibition of the acto-S-1 ATPase activity by Ca2+-binding proteins.

Their structures were determined by composition analysis, enzymatic analysis, and 1H NMR spectroscopy. Nine of them have the common tetrasaccharide backbone, ΔHexAα1–4GlcNα1–4IdoAα1–4GlcN, where ΔHexA and IdoA represent 4,5-unsaturated hexuronic acid and L-iduronic acid, respectively, and their structural variations are based upon the positions of sulfate groups. The nine compounds include one hexasulfated, three pentasulfated and five tetrasulfated compounds, and four of them have not been isolated previously as discrete structures. The other two of the 11 tetrasaccharides have the following hitherto unreported structures with novel glucuronate 2-O-sulfate at the internal position: ΔHexA(2-sulfate)α 1 – 4GlcN(N ,6-disulfate)α 1 – 4GlcA(2-sulfate) β 1 – 4GlcN( N -sulfate) and ΔHexA(2-sulfate)α 1 – 4GlcN( N ,6-disulfate)α 1 – 4GlcA(2-sulfate) β 1 – 4GlcN(N ,6-disulfate). Thus, 2-O-sulfated glucuronate in the highly sulfated tetrasaccharide structures typical of heparin has been demonstrated. The former and the latter tetrasaccharides account for 0.31 and 0.32% (w/w) of the starting heparin, respectively. Their yield, however, is an underestimation, since these tetrasaccharide structures in longer sequences will be degraded by heparinase. Although the latter tetrasaccharide described above was unexpectedly cleaved by heparinase into two disaccharide units, the former was not degraded by the enzyme most likely due to the lack of the 6-O-sulfate group on the GlcN residue at the reducing terminus. The results indicate its capability of catalyzing both anti and syn elimination, a property shared by heparitinases I and II and chondroitinase ABC. Both tetrasaccharides were degraded into disaccharides by heparitinase II. Therefore, it is necessary to reevaluate the disaccharide composition of heparin/heparan sulfate or oligosaccharide structures, which were previously determined after heparinase or heparitinase II digestion. It is no longer possible to conclude that the 2-O-sulfated unsaturated uronic acid residues obtained from heparin/heparan sulfate by lyase digestions are always derived from iduronate 2-O-sulfate residues in the original polymer. It is quite possible that the novel glucuronate 2-O-sulfate structure in the highly sulfated region of heparin is involved in some of the biological activities of heparin.

It is quite possible that the novel glucuronate 2-O-sulfate structure in the highly sulfated region of heparin is involved in some of the biological activities of heparin. Heparin is a highly sulfated polysaccharide with various biological activities and is synthesized on a serine residue of a protein core through the specific structure, GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser, the so-called carbohydrate-protein linkage region (1Lindahl U.

Synthesized on this linkage region is a long stretch of a repeating disaccharide region consisting of alternating 1–4-linked glucosamine and hexuronic acid residues, which are variably sulfated.

We have been studying the structure of heparin to clarify the structural basis of its various biological activities. Previously, we demonstrated its structural variability by isolating two glycoserines from the carbohydrate-protein linkage region (11Sugahara K. Yamada S. Yoshida K. de Waard P. Vliegenthart J.F.G.

Chem. 1992; 267: 1528-1533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a number of oligosaccharides from the repeating disaccharide region of porcine intestinal heparin after extensive digestion with a mixture of Flavobacterium heparinase as well as heparitinases I and II (12Yamada S.

In this study, we isolated and characterized 11 tetrasaccharides including six hitherto unisolated components from the same heparin preparation but after extensive digestion only with Flavobacterium heparinase. We encountered two unique tetrasaccharides, which contain the novel glucuronate 2-sulfate structure but appear to be derived from the highly sulfated region. Using these tetrasaccharides as substrates, we also investigated the specificities of the bacterial lyases and revealed the unexpected specificity of heparinase in particular. The glucuronate 2-sulfate structure is discussed in terms of its implication regarding the biological activities of heparin. Heparinase (EC 4.2.2.7), heparitinase I (EC 4.2.2.8), and heparitinase II (no EC number) were obtained from Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo; Δ4,5-glycuronate-2-O-sulfatase (no EC number) was purified from Flavobacterium heparinum (14McLean M.W. Bruce J.S. Long W.F. Williamson F.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 145: 607-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Sephadex gels were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc., and Bio-Gel resins were from Bio-Rad. Seven standard unsaturated disaccharides were prepared from heparin and heparan sulfate as described (15Yamada S. Yoshida K. Sugiura M. Sugahara K. J. Biochem. 1992; 112 (Tokyo): 440-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). NaB3 H4 (15 Ci/mmol) was from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc., St. Louis, MO. Standard heparin disaccharides prepared by deaminative cleavage (16Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) were gifts from Dr. H . E. Conrad, University of Illinois. Stage 14 heparin was purified by anion-exchange chromatography as described previously (11Sugahara K. Yamada S. Yoshida K. de Waard P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1528-1533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the purified heparin lithium salt (300 mg) was digested with heparinase (2.4 units) in a total volume of 8 ml of 100 mM acetate-NaOH buffer, pH 7.0, containing 3 mM Ca(OAc)2 at 37 °C. Aliquots were withdrawn at 0.5–1-h intervals to monitor the reaction by measurement of absorption at 232 nm. The reaction reached a plateau after 20 h. To complete the reaction, 1.25 units of heparinase was added, and the incubation was continued for a further 20 h. The reaction was terminated by treatment in boiling water for 2 min. The digest was fractionated into oligosaccharides and disaccharides on a column (1.5 × 46 cm) of Sephadex G-25 (fine) using 0.25 M NH4HCO3, 7% 1-propanol as an eluent. Eluates were monitored by absorption at 232 nm. The oligosaccharide fraction was further fractionated by gel filtration on a column (1.6 × 95 cm) of Bio-Gel P-10 using 1.0 M NaCl, 10% ethanol as an eluent. Fractions (2 ml) were collected and monitored by absorption at 232 nm. Eluates were separated into Fractions 1 – 8 (see Fig. 1). Each fraction was concentrated, desalted by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25, and lyophilized. The main fraction, Fraction 7, which is presumed to contain tetrasaccharides, was subfractionated by HPLC on an amine-bound silica column (11Sugahara K. Yamada S. Yoshida K. de Waard P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1528-1533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each peak was purified by rechromatography under the same conditions as the first step and desalted by gel filtration. Digestion of the Isolated Tetrasaccharides with Heparinase, Heparitinases, or Δ4,5-glycuronate-2-O-sulfatase—Tetrasaccharides (0.3–1.0 nmol) were digested using 0.5–1.5 mIU of heparinase, heparitinases I, II or Δ4,5-glycuronate-2-O-sulfatase as described previously (13Yamada S. Sakamoto K. Tsuda H. Yoshida K. Sugahara K. Khoo K.H. Morris H.R. Dell A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Successive enzymatic digestions of the tetrasaccharides with Δ4,5-glycuronate-2-O-sulfatase and then heparitinase II were carried out as follows. Each tetrasaccharide (1 nmol) was first incubated with 2 mIU of Δ4,5-glycuronate-2-O-sulfatase for 1 h at 37 °C in a total volume of 20 μl of 50 mM imidazole-HCl buffer, pH 6.5. Half (10 μl) of the reaction mixture was analyzed by HPLC on an amine-bound silica column (11Sugahara K. Yamada S. Yoshida K. de Waard P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1528-1533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The other half was mixed with 70 μl of water and 20 μl of 100 mM acetate-NaOH buffer, pH 7.0, containing 10 mM Ca(OAc)2 and 2 mIU of heparitinase II and then incubated at 43 °C for 1 h. Reactions were terminated by boiling for 1 min, and the reaction mixture was analyzed by HPLC as reported previously (11Sugahara K. Yamada S. Yoshida K. de Waard P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1528-1533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Heparin tetrasaccharides were treated with 40 μl of 0.5 N HNO2, pH 1.5, for 30 min at room temperature (16Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). The samples were adjusted to pH ˜9 by the addition of 25 μl of 1 M Na2CO3 and reduced by the addition of 5 μl of 3.3 mM NaB3H4 (0.25 mCi) dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide at 4 °C overnight. Sixty-five μl of 1 M NaBH4, 0.05 N NaOH was added to the sample to complete the reduction. After the treatment for 2 h at room temperature, samples were acidified with 15 μl of glacial acetic acid, neutralized with 30 μl of 1 M Na2CO3, and dried by repeated evaporation with intermittent addition of methanol. The samples were dissolved in 0.2 M NH4HCO3 and subjected to gel filtration chromatography on a column (1.0 × 56 cm) of Bio-Gel P-2 using 0.2 M NH4HCO3 as an eluent. The fractions containing disaccharides were pooled, lyophilized, and dissolved in water. The disaccharides were separated by HPLC on an amine-bound silica column at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Samples were eluted with a stepwise concentration gradient of NaH2PO4 as indicated (see Fig. 4, dashed line) and collected at 1.0-min intervals for radioactivity measurement by liquid scintillation counting using an Aloka LSC-700. Individual peaks were identified by comparison with authentic heparin disaccharides as reported previously (17Bienkowski M.J. Conrad H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 356-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 500-MHz 1H NMR spectra of oligosaccharides were measured on a Varian VXR-500 at a probe temperature of 26 °C as reported previously (12Yamada S.

Chemical shifts are given relative to sodium 4 ,4 -dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonate, but were actually measured indirectly relative to acetone (δ 2.225) in 2H2O (18Vliegenthart J.F.G. Dorland L. Van Halbeek H. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1983; 41: 209-374Crossref Scopus (797) Google Scholar). Oligosaccharides for NMR analysis were fully sodiated by cation-exchange chromatography through a column of Dowex 50-X8 (Na+ form) (7 × 18 mm) and then repeatedly exchanged in 2H2O with intermediate lyophilization. The homogeneity of each fraction was judged by capillary electrophoresis using a fused silica capillary as reported previously using a Waters capillary ion analyzer (19Sugahara K. Tohno-oka R. Yamada S. Khoo K.H. Morris H.R. Dell A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 535-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Uronic acid was determined by the carbazole method (20Bitter M. Muir H. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (5202) Google Scholar). Unsaturated uronic acid was spectrophotometrically quantified based upon an average millimolar absorption coefficient of 5.5 at 232 nm (21Yamagata T. Saito H. Habuchi O. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1523-1535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Amino sugars were identified using a Beckman 6300E amino acid analyzer (22Sugahara K. Okamoto H. Nakamura M. Shibamoto S. Yamashina I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 258: 391-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Purified stage 14 heparin from porcine intestine was digested with heparinase and fractionated into disaccharides and larger oligosaccharides by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 (data not shown). The oligosaccharide fraction was separated into Fractions 1–8 by gel filtration on a column of Bio-Gel P-10, as indicated in Fig. 1. Amino sugar and uronic acid analyses indicate that Fraction 7, the major peak, contains approximately 2 mol each of GlcN and HexA/mol of ΔHexA (data not shown), namely tetrasaccharides. Fraction 7 was subfractionated by HPLC on an amine-bound silica column into Fractions I–XIII (Fig. 2). Eleven major fractions, which accounted for 95% (mol/mol, as ΔHexA) of the oligosaccharides obtained from Fraction 7, were further purified by rechromatography to homogeneity as judged by HPLC and capillary electrophoresis and then subjected to structural analysis. The amounts of each fraction isolated from 100 mg of the starting purified heparin are summarized in Table I.Table IEnzymatic analysis of the isolated oligosaccharidesTable IEnzymatic analysis of the isolated oligosaccharidesAfter each oligosaccharide fraction was incubated with heparitinase II or with Δ4,5-glycuronate-2-O-sulfatase (2-sulfatase) and then heparitinase II, the reaction products were characterized by HPLC. Recoveries of the disaccharides calculated based on absorption at 232 nm are shown in parentheses. After each oligosaccharide fraction was incubated with heparitinase II or with Δ4,5-glycuronate-2-O-sulfatase (2-sulfatase) and then heparitinase II, the reaction products were characterized by HPLC. Recoveries of the disaccharides calculated based on absorption at 232 nm are shown in parentheses. The disaccharide composition of the isolated tetrasaccharides was determined by digestion with heparitinase II followed by HPLC on an amine-bound silica column. All of the tetrasaccharides were digested into two disaccharides. The sequential arrangement of the two disaccharide units in each parent tetrasaccharide was determined based upon the sensitivity to Δ4,5-glycuronate-2-O-sulfatase, which acts only on the 4,5-unsaturated hexuronic acid 2-sulfate structure at the nonreducing end (14McLean M.W. Bruce J.S. Long W.F. Williamson F.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 145: 607-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Successive digestions of a tetrasaccharide with Δ4,5-glycuronate-2-O-sulfatase and then heparitinase II led to localization of a disaccharide unit containing a 2-sulfated unsaturated uronic acid residue. The results are summarized in Table I. As a representative chromatogram, those obtained with Fraction IX are shown in Fig. 3 together with that of the standard disaccharides (top panel). Fraction IX yielded ΔDiHS-diS2 and ΔDiHS-triS upon heparitinase II digestion (middle panel). When Fraction IX was digested successively with Δ4,5-glycuronate-2-O-sulfatase and then heparitinase II, it yielded ΔDiHS-diS1 and ΔDiHS-diS2 (bottom panel), indicating that ΔDiHS-triS was located on the nonreducing side of Fraction IX. Therefore, the structure of the compound in Fraction IX was ΔHexA(2-sulfate)α1–4GlcN(N,6-disulfate)α1–4HexA(2-sulfate) 1–4GlcN(N-sulfate). The internal uronic acid residue was identified by HPLC disaccharide analysis of the deamination products after HNO2 degradation and 500-MHz lH NMR analysis (see below). Fractions IX, X, and XI were degraded by the lyase, yielding equimolar amounts of ΔDiHS-diS2 and ΔDiHS-triS (Table I). The major component in these fractions was a pentasulfated tetrasaccharide composed of a disulfated and a trisulfated disaccharide unit. When Fraction XI was successively digested with Δ4,5-glycuronate-2-O-sulfatase and then heparitinase II, it yielded ΔDiHS-NS and ΔDiHS-triS, indicating that ΔDiHS-diS2 was located on the nonreducing side and yielded ΔDiHS-NS by successive digestion. Thus, the structure of the compound in Fraction XI was ΔHexA(2-sulfate)α1–4GlcN(N-sulfate)α1–4HexA(2-sulfate)1–4GlcN(N,6-disulfate). The identification of the internal uronic acid residue by 1H NMR analysis will be described below. Likewise, the sequential arrangement of the disaccharide units in Fractions IX and X was determined enzymatically. The sequential digestions of both tetrasaccharides yielded equimolar amounts of ΔDiHS-diS1 and ΔDiHS-diS2, indicating that the compounds in Fractions IX and X were isomers with the common structure ΔHexA(2-sulfate)α1–4GlcN(N,6-disulfate)α1–4HexA(2-sulfate)1–4GlcN(N-sulfate). Based upon the elution position on HPLC and the yield from the starting heparin (Table I) (13Yamada S. Sakamoto K. Tsuda H. Yoshida K. Sugahara K. Khoo K.H. Morris H.R. Dell A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 23Linker A. Hovingh P. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 127: 75-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 24Linhardt R.J. Wang H. Loganathan D. Bae J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2380-2387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Fraction X was assumed to have a structure identical to that of the tetrasaccharide ΔHexA(2-sulfate)α1–4GlcN(N,6-disulfate)α1–4IdoA(2-sulfate)α1–4GlcN(N-sulfate), designated as ΔT-2 (13Yamada S. Sakamoto K. Tsuda H. Yoshida K. Sugahara K. Khoo K.H. Morris H.R. Dell A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This structure and that of the compound in Fraction IX were characterized also by HPLC analysis of the deaminative cleavage products and 1H NMR analysis, which will be described below. Upon heparitinase II digestion of Fractions XII and XIII, the absorption at 232 nm doubled, and only one disaccharide species, ΔDiHS-triS, was observed (Table I). The results indicate that the compounds in Fractions XII and XIII were isomers with the common hexasulfated tetrasaccharide structure ΔHexA(2-sulfate)α1–4GlcN(N,6-disulfate)α1–4HexA(2-sulfate)1–4GlcN(N,6-disulfate). Based upon the elution position on HPLC and the yield from the starting heparin, Fraction XIII was judged to have a structure identical to that of the tetrasaccharide ΔHexA(2-sulfate)α1–4GlcN(N,6-disulfate)α1–4IdoA(2-sulfate)α1–4GlcN(N,6-disulfate), designated as ΔT-3 (13Yamada S. Sakamoto K. Tsuda H. Yoshida K. Sugahara K. Khoo K.H. Morris H.R. Dell A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This structure and that of the compound in Fraction XII were investigated also by HPLC analysis of the deaminative cleavage products and 1H NMR analysis (see below). In order to identify the internal uronic acid residues of the compounds in Fractions IX, X, XII, and XIII, nitrous acid degradation products were analyzed by HPLC. Bacterial lyase treatment converts the original structure of the internal uronic acid residue, glucuronate or iduronate, of the oligosaccharides into the same 4,5-unsaturated hexuronic acid, 4-deoxy-α-L-threo-hex-4-enepyranosyluronic acid. In contrast, nitrous acid treatment retains the original uronic acid structure, despite loss of an N-sulfate group and production of an artificial structure, anhydromannitol, at the reducing end (16Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 25Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3943-3950Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Fractions IX and X were treated with HNO2/NaB3H4 (see “Experimental Procedures”), and the resultant disaccharides isolated by gel filtration were analyzed by HPLC on an amine-bound silica column. Their elution profiles are shown in Fig. 4 together with that of the disaccharide standards prepared from heparin. Each tetrasaccharide was degraded into a monosulfated and a disulfated disaccharide component as judged from their elution positions (17Bienkowski M.J. Conrad H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 356-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based upon the tetrasaccharide structure estimated above by the enzymatic analysis, it is reasonable to assume that the disulfated component was the common constituent of the tetrasaccharides in Fractions IX and X, and contained the structure ΔHexA(2-sulfate)α1–4anManR(6-sulfate), designated ΔUSMS. In contrast, the monosulfated components from Fractions IX and X were eluted at different positions, indicating that these disaccharides contained different uronic acid residues. The monosulfated component derived from Fraction X was eluted at the position of the authentic IdoA(2-sulfate)α1–4anManR, which was designated ISM. Thus, the component in Fraction X was a tetrasaccharide identical to authentic ΔT-2, which is consistent with the assumption made based on the results of HPLC analysis of the enzymatic cleavage products (see above). The yield of Fraction X from the starting heparin was also comparable with that of ΔT-2 (13Yamada S. Sakamoto K. Tsuda H. Yoshida K. Sugahara K. Khoo K.H. Morris H.R. Dell A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 23Linker A. Hovingh P. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 127: 75-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The monosulfated disaccharide component derived from Fraction IX was eluted at around the same position as that of GlcAβ1–4anManR(6-sulfate) designated GMS, which is comparable with the reported position of GlcA(2-sulfate)β1–4anManR, designated GSM (17Bienkowski M.J. Conrad H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 356-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the compound in Fraction IX was shown above by enzymatic cleavage to have the structure ΔHexA(2-sulfate)α1–4GlcN(N,6-disulfate)α1–4HexA(2-sulfate)1–4GlcN(N-sulfate), the structure of this tetrasaccharide was assumed to be ΔHexA(2-sulfate)α1–4GlcN (N,6-disulfate,)α1–4GlcA(2-sulfate)β1–4GlcN(N-sulfate), which was confirmed by 500-MHz 1H NMR as described below. Deaminative cleavage products of Fractions XII and XIII were also analyzed by HPLC (results not shown). Each tetrasaccharide was degraded into two kinds of disulfated disaccharide components, one of which from both tetrasaccharides eluted at the same position. Based upon the tetrasaccharide structure presumed above from the results of enzymatic analysis, this common disaccharide component was most likely ΔHexA(2-sulfate)α1–4anManR(6-sulfate). The other disulfated components derived from Fractions XII and XIII were eluted at different positions, indicating that these disaccharides contained different uronic acid residues. The elution position of the other disulfated component derived from Fraction XIII was the same as that of authentic IdoA(2-sulfate)α1–4anManR(6-sulfate), suggesting that the compound in Fraction XIII was the same as the tetrasaccharide ΔT-3. The elution position on HPLC and the yield of this compound were consistent with those reported for ΔT-3 (13Yamada S. Sakamoto K. Tsuda H. Yoshida K. Sugahara K. Khoo K.H. Morris H."

Activation of phospholipase C is to date the only known biochemical signal via the Gq-coupled PGF2αreceptor (2Nakao A. Watanabe T. Taniguchi S. Nakamura M. Honda Z. Shimizu T. Kurokawa K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 155: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Such being the case, this Gq-coupled pathway is likely to be linked to the mitogenic response, and NIH-3T3 cells may be a useful model system to examine G-protein-mediated intracellular mechanisms linked to mitogenic responses. Possible intracellular mechanisms that may explain PGF2αeffects are the activation of specific serine/threonine and/or tyrosine protein kinases (PKs). Activation of phospholipase C leads to elevation of intracellular Ca2+([Ca2+]i) and/or formation of diacylglycerol, which in turn leads to activation of [Ca2+]i/calmodulin-dependent PKs and/or PKC, a family of multipotent serine/threonine kinases that elicits cellular responses, including mitogenesis (3Nishizuka Y. Science. 1986; 233: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (4033) Google Scholar), respectively. We recently found that PGF2α receptor-mediated, [Ca2+]i-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular components including p125FAKcorrelated well with PGF2α-induced mitogenesis (4Watanabe T.

Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases (MAPKs) are activated during differentiation and cell cycle transition triggered by a variety of stimuli (5Ray L.B. Sturgill T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sci. 1993; 18: 128-131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). MAPK seems to transmit mitogenic signals by phosphorylating downstream components such as transcription factors (c- myc (7Seth A. Alvatez E. Gupta S. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23521-23524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), c-jun (8Baker S.J. Kerppola T.K. Luk D. Vanderberg M.T. Marshak D.R. Curran T. Abate C. Mol. Cell.

A pathway leading from the tyrosine kinase receptor to MAP kinase activation has been elucidated; ligand-receptor interaction causes formation of the Ras·GTP complex, which in turn activates a kinase cascade comprising p74 (10Wood K.W. Sarnecki C. Roberts T.M. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 68: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar), MAP kinase kinase (MAPKK), and MAPK. However, another protein with MAP kinase kinase kinase activity (MEKK) has been cloned (11Lange-Carter C.A. Pleoman C.M. Gardner A.M. Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Science. 1993; 260: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). As overexpressed MEKK can activate MAPKK without activating p74, p74 and MEKK may converge on MAPKK. Recent studies revealed that MAPK is also activated through heterotrimeric G-protein-mediated mechanisms (12Gupta S.K. Gallego C. Johnson G.L. Heasley L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7987-7990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Kahan C. Seuwen K. Meloche S. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13369-13375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was suggested that receptor tyrosine kinase may activate MAPKK via p21 and p72, while G-protein coupled receptors may be linked to MEKK (11Lange-Carter C.A. Pleoman C.M. Gardner A.M. Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Science. 1993; 260: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is supported by our recent observation that transfected platelet-activating factor receptor cDNA into Chinese hamster ovary cells mediates platelet-activating factor-induced activation of MAPK and MAPKK without detectable increase in GTP form of Ras (14Honda Z.

Chem. 1993; 268: 19196-19199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) agonists stimulate formation of the GTP form of Ras and MAPK activity via an islet-activating protein (IAP)-sensitive pathway. Moreover, MAPK activation by lysophosphatidic acid can be blocked by dominant negative p21 or p74 (15Howe L.R. Marshall C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20717-20720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, MAPK can be activated by an IAP-sensitive G-protein-coupled pathway that requires both p21 and p74. Even though MAPK activation induced by endothelin via an IAP-insensitive G-protein has been reported (21Wang Y. Simonson M.S. Pouyssegur J. Dunn M.J. Biochem.

Several subtypes of α-subunit of IAP-insensitive G-proteins have shown to link to phospholipase C-β; these include α-subunit of Gq(Gqα) family (Gqα, G11α, G14α, and G16α) (23Strathmann M. Simon M.I.

Subtypes of phospholipase C; phospholipase C-β1 and phospholipase C-β2, are known to be stimulated by specific types of Gqα family. Phospholipase C-β2 is also activated by βγ dimers of G-protein (26Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1992; 71: 1069-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The activity of Gα is regulated by the exchange of GDP and GTP and by intrinsic GTPase activity. Agonist binding to cell surface receptors stimulate Gα by enhancing GDP-GTP exchange, and the intrinsic GTPase activity reverses this state to inactivate Gα. It was reported that substitution of arginine 183 or glutamine 209 of Gqα with cysteine or leucine, respectively, constitutively activates Gqα by inhibiting intrinsic GTP hydrolysis (27Conklin B.R. Chabre O. Wong Y.H. Federman A.D. Bournet H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 31-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Wu D. Lee C.H. Rhee S.G. Simon M.I. J. Biol.

It was also reported that NIH-3T3 cells stably expressing Gqα with a mutation of conserved glutamine residue or overexpressing the wild-type of Gqα exhibited transformation of the cells (29Kalinec G. Nazarali A.J. Hermouet S. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4687-4693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30de Vivo M. Chen J. Codina J. Iyengar R. J. Biol.

These recent advances have led us to direct examination of the interrelationship between activation of Gqα and PGF2α-induced cellular responses in NIH-3T3 cells. We report here that in NIH-3T3 cells, PGF2α stimulates MAPKK and MAPK by a mechanism that is inhibited by staurosporine and H-7 but is independent of classical TPA-sensitive PKC or Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent PKs and that Gqα and Ras may mediate this MAPK activation. Materials were obtained from the following sources: [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, >5,000 Ci/mmol) from Amersham Corp.; [3H]thymidine (specific activity, 20.1 Ci/mmol) and myo-[3H]inositol (specific activity, 45.1 Ci/mmol) from DuPont NEN; 32P-labeled carrier-free Pifrom ICN; myelin basic protein (MBP), 12- O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA), epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin, forskolin, staurosporine, H-7, W-7, and KN-62 from Sigma; IAP from Funakoshi Biochemicals (Tokyo); 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane- N, N, N′, N′-tetraacetic acid tetraacetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA-AM) from Dojin (Kumamoto, Japan); protein G-Sepharose and Q-Sepharose Fast Flow from Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology Inc; anti-v-H-ras monoclonal antibody Y13-259 from Oncogene Science; anti-MAPK (erk2) monoclonal antibody against murine recombinant p42, anti-rat MAPK R2 (erk1-CT), and anti-phosphotyrosine-conjugated Sepharose from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY); Pansorbin from Calbiochem; Transfectam from Sepracor (Marlborough, MA); P-81 phosphocellulose papers from Whatman; polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates from Merck. PGF2α, PGE2, and PGD2were donated by Ono Pharmaceuticals (Osaka, Japan). A cDNA encoding guinea pig Gqα and that encoding a GTPase deficient mutant, in which glutamine 209 was replaced with leucine (27Conklin B.R. Chabre O. Wong Y.H. Federman A.D. Bournet H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 31-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Wu D. Lee C.H. Rhee S.G. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1811-1817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (M6 mutant), were subcloned into an expression vector (pCDNA-1: Invitrogen Corp., San Diego, CA). All other chemicals were of analytical grade. Reagents for cell culture were from Nissui (Tokyo) and Life Technologies, Inc. NIH-3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), under the conditions described elsewhere (2Nakao A. Watanabe T. Taniguchi S. Nakamura M. Honda Z. Shimizu T. Kurokawa K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 155: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The cells were washed 3 times with FCS-free DMEM and cultured for 24 h before the assays of MAPKK and MAPK, analysis of GTP-bound Ras, or Western blot analysis. Each plasmid DNA was transfected into NIH-3T3 cells by DEAE-dextran method, as described (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.42-16.44Google Scholar) or using Transfectam, as described in the manual provided by the supplier (Sepracor, Marlborough, MA). Typically, 2 μg of plasmid DNA was transfected into 5 × 105cells (counted 1 day before transfection)/60-mm2dish. One day after transfection, cells from one 60-mm2dish were seeded onto two wells on a six-well coaster for the measurement of [3H]thymidine incorporation and phosphoinositide breakdown. Three days after transfection, the cells were washed 3 times with DMEM without FCS and cultured in FCS-free DMEM for 24 h prior to the measurement of [3H]thymidine incorporation, phosphoinositide breakdown, MAPK assay, and analysis of Ras-bound GTP and GDP. Quiescent Cells were washed twice with Tyrode buffer containing 20 m M HEPES pH 7.4 and 1 m M CaCl2(HEPES-Tyrode) and then stimulated with agonists in HEPES-Tyrode for the indicated times. After a wash with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 m M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 m Mβ-glycerophosphate, 2 m M EGTA, 1 m M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 m M dithiothereitol, and 1 m M sodium orthovanadate) and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was used as the source of MAPK and MAPKK. The immune complex MAPK assay was carried out essentially as described (32Tobe K. Kadowaki T. Tamemoto H. Ueki K. Hara K. Koshio O. Momomura K. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Akamuma Y. Yazaki Y. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24793-24803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MAPK was immunoprecipitated with anti-MAPK (erk2) monoclonal antibody, with the aid of Pansorbin, washed with lysis buffer, and resuspended in the same buffer. In the transfection experiments, MAPK was partially purified by batch treatment with Q-Sepharose; the cell lysate was mixed with 0.5 volume of Q-Sepharose beads equilibrated with lysis buffer containing 0.12 M NaCl for 30 min at 4°C and then briefly centrifuged (3,000 × g for 5 min). The resultant pellet was washed twice with the same buffer and incubated with the original volume of lysis buffer containing 0.3 M NaCl for 30 min at 4°C. MAPK was recovered in the supernatant by centrifugation. The sample for MAPK assay was incubated with MBP (1 mg/ml) in 25 μl of kinase buffer (20 m M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 m M MgCl2, 1 m M MnCl2, and 40 m M ATP) containing 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 25 min at 25°C. A 12-μl aliquot was spotted onto P-81 phosphocellulose paper and extensively washed with 0.5% phosphoric acid. The paper was dried, and 32P incorporation into MBP was measured by Cerenkov counting (14Honda Z. Takano T. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Ito K. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2307-2315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the kinase detection assay in the MBP-containing gel (gel kinase assay), the supernatant of the cell lysate was electrophoresed onto an SDS-polyacylamide gel containing 1 mg/ml MBP. Proteins were denatured in 6 M guanidine-HCl and renatured as described previously (33Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Yamashita T. Hoshi M. Kawasaki M. Sakai H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of MBP was carried out in 5 ml of kinase buffer containing 25 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and the gel was extensively washed with 7% acetic acid. The dried gel was subjected to an image analyzing system using FUJI BAS 2000. MAPKK activity was assayed by measuring 32P incorporation into a kinase-negative mutant of a recombinant Xenopus MAPK (rMAPK) (34Kosako H. Nishida E. Gotoh Y. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 35Matsuda S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3277-3281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which was kindly provided by Drs. Y. Gotoh and E. Nishida of Kyoto University. MAPKK was partially purified by batch treatment with Q-Sepharose; the cell lysate was mixed with 0.5 volume of Q-Sepharose beads equilibrated with lysis buffer containing 0.12 M NaCl and briefly centrifuged. Under these conditions, MAPKK activity was recovered in the supernatant. The supernatant was incubated with rMAPK (final concentration, 50 μg/ml) in 12.5 μl of the kinase buffer containing 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 20 min at 25°C. The sample was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and 32P incorporation into the rMAPK band was measured using a Fuji image analyzer (FUJI BAS 2000). Immunoprecipitation and Western blot Analysis- Quiescent cultures of NIH-3T3 cells on a 60-mm2culture dish (3 × 106) were washed twice with HEPES-Tyrode, treated with each agonist in HEPES-Tyrode at 37°C for 3 min and then frozen in liquid nitrogen. The cells were lysed on ice in 1 ml of solution containing 10 m M Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 m M EDTA, 50 m M NaCl, 30 m M sodium pyrophosphate, 50 m M NaF, 100 μM sodium orthovanadate, and 1% Triton X-100 (immunoprecipitaion buffer). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min. Resultant supernatants were precleared by incubation with agarose at 4°C for 1 h. After removal of agarose by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 5 min, the supernatants were incubated with 100 μl of anti-phosphotyrosine conjugated to agarose at 4°C for 4 h and then cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 5 min. Immunoprecipitates were washed 3 times with 1 ml of immunoprecipitaion buffer and then treated with 30 μl of Laemmli's sample buffer. After proteins were separated by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Western blot analysis was performed using 2 μg/ml of anti-Rat MAPK (erk1-CT) as the first antibody and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (200-fold dilution) as the second antibody as described (36Watanabe T. Shimizu T. Nakao A. Taniguchi S. Arata Y. Teramoto T. Seyama Y. Ui M. Kurokawa K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1074: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Quiescent cells were labeled with 0.1 mCi/ml 32P-labeled carrier-free Piin phosphate-free DMEM medium for 4 h, and then stimulated with agonists for 3 min, unless otherwise stated. Next, the cells were lysed in Triton X-114 buffer (50 m M HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-114, 100 m M NaCl, 5 m M MgCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 m M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μM GTP, 100 μM GDP, and 1 m M ATP) supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors (1 m M sodium pyrophosphate and 1 m M sodium orthovanadate). Membrane-bound Ras was recovered by detergent phase splitting, as described (37Burgering B.M.T. Medema R.H. Maassen J.A. van de Wetering M.L. van der Eb A.J. McCormic F. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1103-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody Y13-259 with the aid of protein G-Sepharose (38Satoh T. Endo M. Nakafuku M. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5993-5997Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The immune complex was extensively washed with washing buffer (50 m M HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.05 M NaCl, 5 m M MgCl2, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) (37Burgering B.M.T. Medema R.H. Maassen J.A. van de Wetering M.L. van der Eb A.J. McCormic F. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1103-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors (1 m M sodium pyrophosphate and 1 m M sodium orthovanadate). Guanine nucleotides bound to Ras were eluted and analyzed by thin-layer chromatography on a polyethyleneimine-cellulose plate. The GTP/(GTP + GDP) ratio was measured using an image analyzer (FUJI BAS 2000). Formation of inositol phosphates (IPs) for 1 min in the presence or absence of PGF2α was examined as described (2Nakao A. Watanabe T. Taniguchi S. Nakamura M. Honda Z. Shimizu T. Kurokawa K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 155: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) using the methods of Bijsterbosch et al. (39Bijsterbosch M.K. Meade C.J. Turner G.A. Klaus G.G. Cell. 1985; 41: 999-1006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). [3H]Thymidine incorporation into DNA was measured by the method of Nakamura et al. (40Nakamura T. Tomita Y. Ichihara A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1983; 94: 1029-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), with slight modifications. Quiescent cells (6-well coaster) were washed twice with DMEM at 37°C and then incubated for 24 h in 1 ml of DMEM in the presence or absence of PGF2α. One μCi of [3H]thymidine was added to each dish 6 h before harvest. [3H]Thymidine incorporation into trichloroacetic acid-insoluble materials was determined. Protein concentration was measured by Bio-Rad protein assay kits using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Statistical analyses were made by the procedure of analysis of variance. The addition of 1 μM PGF2α caused a transient activation of MAPK and MAPKK with a peak at around 3 min, while 1 μM TPA induced a time-dependent increase of MAPK activity up to 30 min and EGF/insulin activated MAPK with a peak value at around 5 min and a sustained phase within 60 min (Fig. 1). Dose dependence of PGF2α on MAPK and MAPKK activation with ED50of around 10−8M was similar to that for elevation of [Ca2+]i, formation of IPs, and [3H]thymidine incorporation, as described previously (2Nakao A. Watanabe T. Taniguchi S. Nakamura M. Honda Z. Shimizu T. Kurokawa K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 155: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Pretreatment of the cells with IAP did not affect the dose-dependence of PGF2α on MAPKK activation, even under conditions that are assumed to ADP ribosylate almost all of the IAP substrate, as described (2Nakao A. Watanabe T. Taniguchi S. Nakamura M. Honda Z. Shimizu T. Kurokawa K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 155: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). A gel MAPK assay of the supernatant of cell lysate (see “Experimental Procedures”) (Fig. 3 A) and that of anti-42-kDa MAPK immunoprecipitates (data not shown) showed that a 42-kDa MAPK was the main MAPK activated by PGs in the NIH-3T3 cells. We also found that MAPK and MAPKK were activated by PGs (1 μM); PGF2α > PGE2, PGD2, which correlates with the order of potencies of these PGs to activate the elevation of [Ca2+]i, formation of IPs, and [3H]thymidine incorporation, as described previously (2Nakao A. Watanabe T. Taniguchi S. Nakamura M. Honda Z. Shimizu T. Kurokawa K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 155: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, A and B). These two kinases (MAPK and MAPKK) were also activated by EGF (100 ng/ml)/insulin (1 μM) ≫ TPA (1 μM) > ionomycin (100 n M), but not by forskolin (10 μM) (Fig. 3, A and B). Western blot analysis with anti-rat MAPK (erk1-CT) of immunoprecipitates with antiphosphotyrosine-conjugated Sepharose of cellular lysates demonstrated that a MAPK with a molecular mass around 42-44 kDa was tyrosine phosphorylated (Fig. 4). The PGF2α -induced activation of MAPK was almost completely inhibited by staurosporine (20 n M) and by H-7 (20 μM) at concentrations that inhibit PKC (41Tamaoki T. Nomoto H. Takahashi I. Kato Y. Morimoto M. Tomita F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 135: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (2215) Google Scholar, 42Hidaka H. Inagaki M. Kawamoto S. Sasaki Y. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5036-5041Crossref PubMed Scopus (2327) Google Scholar), but not by Ca2+/calmodulin kinase inhibitors; W-7 or KN-62, even at concentrations that inhibit calmodulin-dependent kinases (20 μM) (43Kanamori M.

Pretreatment of the cells with TPA (2.5 μM, 24 h), which is assumed to down-regulate classical PKC, did not affect the PGF2α -induced activation of MAPK (Table II).FIG. 2Dose-response of PGF2α on MAPK and MAPKK activities. Quiescent NIH-3T3 cells (3 × 106/60-mm diameter culture dish) in HEPES-Tyrode stimulated with the indicated concentrations of PGF2α at 37°C for 3 min, and then immersed in liquid nitrogen.

https://openalex.org/W2080380767,"The topological organization of the Na,K-ATPase α subunit is controversial. Detection of extracellular proteolytic cleavage sites would help define the topology, and so attempts were made to find conditions and proteases that would permit digestion of Na,K-ATPase in sealed right-side-out vesicles from renal medulla. The β subunit is predominantly extracellular and could mask the surface of the α subunit. Most of the tested proteases cleaved β, and some digested it extensively. However, without further disruption of structure, there was still no digestion of the α subunit. Reduction (at 50°C) of disulfide bonds that might stabilize the β subunit fragments, or heating alone at 55°C, permitted tryptic digestion of α at a site close to the C terminus, while simultaneously increasing digestion of β. A 90-kDa N-terminal fragment of α was recovered, but the C-terminal fragment was further digested. Heating and reduction resulted in the extracellular exposure of a protein kinase A phosphorylation site, Ser-938, and the C terminus, both of which have been proposed to be located on the intracellular surface. At the same time, access to a distant protein kinase C phosphorylation site was not increased. The data suggest that the harsh treatment simultaneously resulted in alteration of the β subunit and the extrusion of a segment of α that normally spans the membrane, without causing complete denaturation or opening the sealed vesicles. Preincubation with Rb+was protective, consistent with prior evidence that it stabilizes the protein segments in the C-terminal third of α. We conclude that this portion of the α subunit contains a transmembrane structure with unique lability to heating. The topological organization of the Na,K-ATPase α subunit is controversial.

It has a catalytic subunit, α, with a molecular mass of 110 kDa, and a smaller glycoprotein subunit, β, with an apoprotein molecular mass of 32 kDa.

According to current models, the N and C termini of the α subunit are located inside the cell, and there is a large central intracellular portion, anchored by 6-10 transmembrane segments. The models predict that very little of α is exposed on the extracellular surface, mostly in the C-terminal third where the structure is much debated. In contrast, the majority of the β subunit is exposed outside the cell (11Dzhandzhugazyan K.N. JP L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 817: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).

Right-side-out vesicles, i.e. those in which Na,K-ATPase has the same orientation as in the cell, are formed during homogenization of renal medulla by the resealing of involuted basolateral membrane fragments.

Attempts to get tryptic cleavage of the α subunit at the extracellular surface have been unsuccessful, however (14Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12678-12684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Farley R.A. Miller R.P. Kudrow A. Biochim. Biophys.

To explain the discrepancy, one hypothesis is that the β subunit masks the α subunit. In this paper we report that exposure of a certain stretch of the α subunit at the extracellular surface can be achieved in right-side-out vesicles, and the data implicate the close interaction of the α and β subunits. Independent work by Karlish et al. (22Goldshleger R. Tal D.M. Shainskaya A. Or E. Karlish S.J.D. Bamberg E. Schoner W. The Sodium Pump.

J. 1994; 66: A235Google Scholar) has produced evidence for the exposure of sites at the extracellular surface of α as a consequence of heating. Evidence for substantial reorganization of the C-terminal domain is described here within the framework of topological models of Na,K-ATPase structure. Antiserum K1 (24Sweadner K.J. Gilkeson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9016-9022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was raised against the purified α subunit of rat kidney Na,K-ATPase. Antipeptide directed antisera 757 (25Sun Y. Ball Jr., W.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C1491-C1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 845 (26Ball Jr., W.J. Loftice C.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 916: 100-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) were the gift of Dr. William J. Ball, Jr., University of Cincinnati. Polyclonal antiserum FPβ1 was provided by Dr. Alicia McDonough, University of Southern California; polyclonal antibody UBI β1 was purchased from United Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY); these two antibodies were prepared by the same procedure (27Shyjan A.W. Levenson R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4531-4535Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody McK1 was raised against rat kidney Na,K-ATPase (16Felsenfeld D.P. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10932-10942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Peptide-directed antibody ETYY (28Bayer R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2251-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) was the gift of Dr. Jack Kyte, University of California at San Diego. All proteases and secondary antibodies used for staining blots were obtained from Sigma. Purification of Na,K-ATPase from pig or rat kidney outer medulla microsomes, determination of protein concentration, ATPase activity assay, and [3H]ouabain binding were performed as described elsewhere (29Arystarkhova E. Gasparian M. Modyanov N.N. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13694-13701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Right-side-out vesicles from rat kidney outer medulla were prepared by modification of published methods (11Dzhandzhugazyan K.N. JP L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 817: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, freshly prepared crude microsomes were loaded onto step gradients consisting of 20 and 5% metrizamide (Sigma, grade I) in 0.25 M sucrose, 25 m M MOPS, pH 7.4, 1 m M Tris-EDTA. Centrifugation was at 27,000 rpm for 4 h at 4°C in the SW 50.1 rotor of a Beckman ultracentrifuge. The vesicle fraction was collected from the interface between the two metrizamide solutions and stored without further manipulation at −70°C after the addition of dimethyl sulfoxide to 5% as a cryoprotectant. The extent of vesicle sealing was assessed in a latency test by measuring the hydrolysis of ATP before and after permeabilization, which was with 0.016% sodium dodecyl sulfate in the presence of 3 m M ATP to protect activity. For the preparations used here, activity was stimulated 5.5-7.7-fold, indicating that vesicles were 82-88% sealed. With cryoprotection, vesicle sealing was changed very little by storage for weeks or months at −70°C. Right-side-out vesicles (0.5-0.6 mg/ml) were incubated with different proteases (in all cases, 1:3 w/w with respect to vesicle protein) for periods of time from 1 min to 1 h as indicated, in medium containing 250 m M sucrose, 25 m M MOPS, pH 7.4, 1 m M Tris EDTA. For some experiments, different ligands were added as specified in the text and tables; for others, digestion was preceded by treatment with reducing agent (dithiothreitol or β-mercaptoethanol) at different temperatures, or by heating at 55°C for 30 min (the latter condition according to Ref. 23Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: A235Google Scholar). Proteolysis was performed at 37°C, and the reaction was stopped either with the addition of acidified electrophoresis sample buffer (125 m M Tris, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 5%β-mercaptoethanol, pH < 2.0) or by addition of 3 m M diisopropylfluorophosphate (Sigma), a covalent inhibitor of serine proteases. As shown previously, acidified sample buffer is more effective at preventing digestion by trypsin during gel electrophoresis than addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor (30Sweadner K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1029: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and it was successful with other proteases as well. The acidification of the sample lasts only until it penetrates the gel, but it appears to cause irreversible denaturation of the protease. For most experiments, gel electrophoresis was performed according to Laemmli (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), using 7.5%, 10%, or gradient 5-15% polyacrylamide for separating gels. To resolve short peptides, the Tricine-SDS buffer system of Schagger and von Jagow (32Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar) was employed with 16% polyacrylamide gels. Electrophoretic transfer was performed in a buffer containing 20 m M Tris, 150 m M glycine, and 20% methanol, at 100 mA overnight at 4°C. Nitrocellulose was quenched with Tris-buffered saline, 0.5% Tween 20, and stained with antibodies as described previously (16Felsenfeld D.P. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10932-10942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with visualization with ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence) (Amersham). For autoradiography of 32P, nitrocellulose blots, stained with 0.1% Amido Black, were exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film. Densitometry was accomplished with a Molecular Dynamics laser densitometer. The renal medulla preparation used here contains the α1 and β1 isoforms of the Na,K-ATPase. Without digestion, both subunits migrate on SDS gels at anomalous positions. The α subunit migrates as if it had a molecular mass of 95-99 kDa, slightly faster than the 112-kDa mass deduced from the cDNA. This is thought to be due to peculiarities in the interaction of very hydrophobic domains with the detergent (30Sweadner K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1029: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The β subunit, with its protein molecular mass of 32 kDa, migrates as a fuzzy band of roughly 60 kDa because of its carbohydrate groups. The extra band of 70 kDa which stained with an antiserum against α1 (K1) seen in Fig. 1 was absent from Na,K-ATPase purified from renal medulla microsomes by SDS extraction (data not shown), and it was not investigated further as it was not digested. Heated (55°C, 30 min) or unheated vesicles were used directly or permeabilized by treatment with 0.016% SDS in the presence of 3 m M ATP for 15 min at room temperature. Various concentrations of vesicles were preincubated with fixed concentrations of antibody in a solution containing 250 m M sucrose, 25 m M MOPS, 1 m M EDTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 37°C. Vesicle-bound antibody was removed by centrifugation in an Airfuge for 15 min. Unbound antibody was measured on microtiter plates (Nunc Maxi-Sorp immunoplates) coated with rat kidney microsomes (0.7 μg/well in phosphate-buffered saline) and quenched with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline. Detection was performed with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Life Technologies, Inc.), and color was developed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin and o-phenylenediamine as a substrate. The wells were read on a EIA plate reader (Bio-TEK Instruments, Inc.). Pretreated or untreated right-side-out vesicles (10 μg) or purified Na,K-ATPase from rat kidney (1 μg) were preincubated in a buffer containing 20 m M HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 m M EGTA, 5-10 m M MgCl2in a total volume 10-20 μl. After 15 min, 0.05% Triton X-100 (if specified) and 100 ng of protein kinase A catalytic subunit (Sigma) were added. After 5 min, the reaction was started by addition of 200 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP (DuPont NEN) (specific activity 10,000 cpm/pmol). Phosphorylation was allowed to proceed for 15 min at 30°C and was stopped with an equal volume of electrophoresis sample buffer containing 125 m M Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 5%β-mercaptoethanol. When trypsinolysis of phosphorylated Na,K-ATPase was performed, vesicles were first heated at 55°C for 30 min, next phosphorylated by protein kinase A catalytic subunit without Triton as described above, and then trypsin was added at 1:3 ratio with respect to vesicle protein. Proteolysis was for 1 h at 30°C and was stopped with acidified electrophoresis sample buffer. An aliquot of right-side-out vesicles containing 3 m M ATP (sodium salt) was first treated with 0.016% SDS for 15 min at room temperature for permeabilization. Then opened and sealed vesicles were subjected to treatment with 200 m M dithiothreitol (DTT) at 50°C for 15 min or heated at 55°C for 30 min. For optimal phosphorylation by protein kinase C (PKC), samples (10 μg) were preincubated in the presence of 10 m M Tris phosphate, pH 7.4, 5 m M magnesium acetate, 500 μM CaCl2, 100 n M phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Sigma), and 50 ng of protein kinase C (Calbiochem). The reaction was started with 200 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 1,000 cpm/pmol) and stopped after 15 min by the addition of an equal volume of electrophoresis sample buffer. Ion-induced conformation changes are well-known to alter the digestion of cytoplasmic loops of the α subunit (33JP L. Farley R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 291-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether such changes would also affect the extracellular portion of either subunit, trypsinolysis of right-side-out vesicles was performed after overnight incubation in either 15 m M Na+or 15 m M K+, to induce the E1 or E2 conformation, respectively (Fig. 1). Digestion from the extracellular surface was unaffected by the cations. Staining with a polyclonal antibody against α (K1) revealed no digestion even at 30 min (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, the β subunit was readily cleaved at 1 min (Fig. 1 B; the blot shown in A was reprobed with a second antibody, and the β stain is the difference between the two images). Prior work (34Capasso J.M. Hoving S. Tal D.M. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1150-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has established that β is preferentially cleaved at Arg-142, dividing the 302-amino acid protein into roughly equal pieces. Only the C-terminal half contains carbohydrate groups, however, and, accordingly, staining of the tryptic digest with an antibody raised against a fusion protein containing amino acids 150-302 (UBI β1) revealed a large, smudgy band with an apparent molecular mass of 50 kDa. The N-terminal 16-kDa fragment, which contains the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of the β subunit, was detected with a peptide-directed antiserum (757) raised against the first 12 amino acids of the β subunit. This fragment also appeared after 1 min of trypsinolysis, and as a doublet still containing the N-terminal epitope at longer times. This is seen in Fig. 2, which shows digestion in the absence of added ligands. In both figures, there was reduction of total staining by the UBI β1 antibody of the 60-kDa β subunit and its 50-kDa fragment, which could be explained by digestion of epitopes very close to the C terminus. 2Indeed, in further experiments, we have been able to demonstrate that most of the antigenic determinants responsible for binding of FPβ1 antibody (the equivalent of the UBI β1 antibody used here) are localized within the C-terminal quarter (amino acids 230-302) of the β subunit. More direct confirmation was obtained in experiments using the peptide-directed antibody 940 against amino acids 294-302 (gift of W. J. Ball, Jr.), which indicated that the extreme C terminus of the β subunit can be easily clipped off when rat kidney right-side-out vesicles are proteolyzed even under mild conditions. In similar experiments performed with pig kidney vesicles, we did not see any loss of staining of the β subunit or its 50-kDa fragment with monoclonal antibody M17-P5-F11 (gift of W. J. Ball, Jr.), which recognizes amino acids 234-236 in β. Data not shown. Thus, while exposure of the α subunit could not be detected, a site in the middle of the β subunit was easily accessible at the extracellular surface, as well as a site near the C terminus. Similar tryptic digestion patterns were observed when other physiological ligand combinations were used. The tested conditions are listed in Table I. The pretreatments did not cause the opening of more than a small fraction of the sealed vesicles, as determined by measuring the latency of ATP hydrolysis. Regardless of conditions, the α subunit was resistant to digestion. Cleavage of the β subunit was restricted to formation of the N-terminal 16-kDa and C-terminal 50-kDa fragments at early times, with some additional cleavage at the C-terminal end of each fragment.Tabled 1Tryptic cleavage of β and resistance of α is unaffected by Na,K-ATPase ligandsRat kidney vesicles were presoaked in media containing various ligands for the indicated periods of time. The latency of the vesicles was determined by the stimulation of Na,K-ATPase activity by mild detergent treatment. The latency of untreated vesicles (kept on ice after thawing) in a medium containing no external ligands was taken as 100%. Rat kidney vesicles were presoaked in media containing various ligands for the indicated periods of time. The latency of the vesicles was determined by the stimulation of Na,K-ATPase activity by mild detergent treatment. The latency of untreated vesicles (kept on ice after thawing) in a medium containing no external ligands was taken as 100%. Fig. 2 also shows the pattern of β subunit fragments detected when gels were run under reducing (lanes 1-4) and nonreducing (lanes 5-8) conditions. In A, the blot was probed with the antibody against amino acids 150-302, while in B it was reprobed with antibody against amino acids 1-12. It appears that the initial digestion occurred within a stretch of protein stabilized by a disulfide bond, which prevented the separa-tion of the fragments when β-mercaptoethanol was omitted. These results are in agreement with previous reports (19Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4555-4564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Capasso J.M. Hoving S. Tal D.M. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1150-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6737-6743Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). By 30 min, however, another cleavage occurred outside the region connected by the disulfide, permitting the sepa-ration of the fragments. The delayed appearance of frag-ments on nonreducing gels is probably because cleavage at the initial points (Arg-135, Arg-142, or Lys-146, i.e. within the disulfide bond between Cys-125 and Cys-148) causes the protein to lose its tight globular structure, allowing trypsin access to Arg-149 or Arg-151 (Fig. 2 C). The results verify the accessibility of the β subunit to limited tryptic digestion, as well as the inaccessibility of the extracellular surface of the α subunit, and establish that there is little effect of ligands which alter Na,K-ATPase conformation. A variety of other specific and nonspecific proteases was tried for digestion of either subunit at the extracellular surface; Table II summarizes the results. The α subunit was not cleaved with any of them. This indicates how inaccessible its surface is and also serves as an internal control establishing that proteolysis did not occur during gel electrophoresis. Digestion patterns of the β subunit were different with different proteases. No digestion was detected with papain, which was surprising because it had been reported previously to cleave the β subunit at the extracellular surface (15Farley R.A. Miller R.P. Kudrow A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 873: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 36Chin G.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5943-5947Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Like trypsin, chymotrypsin and elastase digested some, but not all, of the β. Subtilisin, ficin, proteinase K, and bromelain caused extensive digestion, leaving only 15-20% of β intact. A 16-kDa N-terminal fragment like that generated by trypsin was detected after digestion by chymotrypsin, elastase, subtilisin, and ficin, indicating that this marks a generally accessible site on the surface of the protein. A new N-terminal fragment with an apparent molecular mass of 40 kDa was detected after digestion by chymotrypsin, ficin, and proteinase K, marking a second exposed region. After digestion by bromelain, no major fragments were seen, indicating extensive digestion at secondary sites.Tabled 1Digestion of right-side-out vesicles with various proteases reveals two “hot spots” in the structure of β subunitRat kidney vesicles were pre-equilibrated for 1 h at 4°C in different media prior to proteolysis. Digestion was performed for 30 min at 37°C. Blots were stained with peptide-directed antibody 757 to detect any fragments containing the N terminus of the β subunit. Rat kidney vesicles were pre-equilibrated for 1 h at 4°C in different media prior to proteolysis. Digestion was performed for 30 min at 37°C. Blots were stained with peptide-directed antibody 757 to detect any fragments containing the N terminus of the β subunit. The most complete trypsinolysis of the β subunit described in the literature was achieved after first treating it with 300 m Mβ-mercaptoethanol to disrupt tertiary structure by reduction of its three disulfide bonds (37Ovchinnikov Yu.A. Arzamazova N.M. Arystarkhova E.A. Gevondyan N.M. Aldanova N.A. Modyanov N.N. FEBS Lett. 1987; 217: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that such a reorganization of the extracellular domain of β could result in exposure of hidden stretches of the α subunit. Preincubation of vesicles with 100 m M DTT at 37°C did not inhibit the activity of the Na,K-ATPase and did not make the vesicles leaky, as measured by the latency of ATP hydrolysis. Trypsinolysis after this treatment resulted in typical cleavage of the β subunit into 16-kDa and 50-kDa fragments and no digestion of the α subunit. Increasing the concentration of DTT to 200 m M and varying the duration of treatment and the temperature over the range from 4−37°C did not promote digestion of α. Although at least partial reduction of β's disulfide bonds should occur under some of these conditions, as shown for purified enzyme (38Kirley T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4227-4232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the digestion pattern in vesicles was unchanged. Heating of the vesicles to 50°C during incubation with 200 m M DTT or 250 m Mβ-mercaptoethanol, however, led to significant changes in the subsequent tryptic digestion of both subunits, accompanied by loss of most of the ATPase activity. Table III demonstrates the correlation between the disappearance of the 16-kDa fragment of the β subunit and the exposure of the tryptic site on the α subunit.Tabled 1Effect of heating and reduction on proteolysis of α and β subunits of Na,K-ATPase in right-side-out vesiclesRat kidney vesicles were treated with various concentrations of DTT for the indicated periods of time prior to trypsinolysis. No external ligands were added to the incubation media. Detection of digestion fragments was performed with K1 antiserum (α subunit) or peptide-directed antibody 757 (β subunit). Rat kidney vesicles were treated with various concentrations of DTT for the indicated periods of time prior to trypsinolysis. No external ligands were added to the incubation media.

Fig. 3 illustrates the result of trypsinolysis of rat kidney vesicles after incubation with 200 m M DTT at 37°C (lanes 1-4) and 50°C (lanes 5-8) for 15 min. A distinct doublet of the α subunit was seen in lanes 6-8 but not in lanes 2-4, thus demonstrating access to a new cleavage site. As calculated from several experiments, the fragment of the α subunit was 8-9 kDa"
https://openalex.org/W2024009782,"All species of Leishmania express a major surface protease (Msp or gp63) that facilitates the interactions of the parasite with its environment at several steps in its life cycle. The msp gene family in Leishmania chagasi contains three classes of genes whose mRNAs are differentially expressed during parasite growth. Logarithmic phase (low infectivity) promastigotes express only 63-kDa versions of Msp, whereas stationary phase (high infectivity) promastigotes express both 63- and 59-kDa Msps. The different migrations of the 59- and 63-kDa proteins on acrylamide gels are not due to differences in N-linked glycosylation or the membrane anchor. Plasmid transfections of Leishmania demonstrate that mspS2 of the stationary gene class encodes a 59-kDa protein. Expression of the 59-kDa protein in stationary phase promastigotes ceases after about 12 weeks of in vitro cultivation when the parasites become attenuated. Attenuated parasites can be stimulated to re-express the 59-kDa Msp by passage through mice followed by several in vitro passages of recovered promastigotes. Amastigotes express yet another subset of Msp proteins. Thus, the 59-kDa product of mspS2 is expressed only in stationary phase promastigotes and only after recent exposure to environmental changes encountered in the mammalian host cell."

GH receptor belongs to a newly described gene family that includes the receptors for GH and prolactin, a number of cytokines such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, erythropoietin, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and a wide variety of interleukins (1Kelly P.A.

Whereas detailed information about the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of expression of the GH gene is available (2Theill L.E. Karin M. Endocr.

In addition, there is a distinct tissue-specific pattern of expression of the receptor with maximum expression in the liver and lesser degrees of expression in the heart, kidney, and intestine (7Waters M.J.

The factors controlling the temporal and tissue-specific expression of the GH receptor are not known, but much of their effect is probably manifested at the level of GH receptor gene transcription. The regulated expression of the GH receptor in various tissues and cell types plays a critical role in numerous physiologic and pathologic processes. Hence, elucidation of the molecular mechanisms involved in the modulation of GH receptor expression requires identification and characterization of the transcriptional regulatory regions of the GH receptor gene. In this report, we describe the structure and organization of the 5′-flanking region of the murine GH receptor gene, including identification of the transcription initiation sites used in liver. We also demonstrate that the 5′-flanking region of this gene contains a functional promoter as well as at least one enhancer element. Our investigations have also resulted in the identification of sequence-specific protein binding activity within the enhancer element and suggest that the protein(s) binding to the enhancer region are novel. A mouse genomic library (Stratagene) was screened with a mouse cDNA probe. The genomic library was prepared by partial Sau3AI digestion of spleen DNA, with subsequent size fractionation and cloning into the XhoI site of the Lambda FIX II phage vector. Based on the published sequence of the mouse GH receptor cDNA (8Smith W.C. Kuniyoshi J. Talamantes F. Mol.

These primers were used in the PCR to amplify a 906-bp fragment from adult mouse liver total RNA. The amplified DNA was then cloned into the plasmid vector PCR1000 (Invitrogen). To select for 5′-sequences, the 191-bp cDNA probe used for screening the genomic library was obtained by EcoRI- HindIII digestion of the 906-bp cDNA. The cDNA was 32P labeled by random primer extension and used to screen filters by standard techniques (9Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Positive clones were plaque purified, and the purified DNA was used for subsequent analytical and cloning procedures. Detailed restriction maps of the genomic clones identified were obtained by the rapid restriction mapping method (10Wahl G.M. Lewis K.A. Ruiz J.C. Rothenberg B. Zhao J. Evans G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2160-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), which exploits the mapping cassettes included in the Lambda FIX II phage vector (Stratagene). The λ DNA clones were partially sequenced directly by PCR sequencing using the dsDNA Cycle System (Life Technologies, Inc.) with synthesized oligonucleotides complementary to the 5′-region of the cDNA. For other DNA sequence analyses, convenient fragments of the λ clone were subcloned into the plasmid pBluescript II SK+ (Stratagene). Sequencing was carried out by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method of Sanger et al. (11Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52648) Google Scholar) using the Seque-nase 2.0 kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Sequencing primers were either complementary to the T3 or T7 sites flanking the multiple cloning site of the vector or were complementary to experimentally established sequences. The sequence data were managed using the sequence analysis program Geneworks (IntelliGenetics, Inc. Mountain View, CA). Total RNA was prepared from tissue or cells using RNAzol as recommended by the supplier (Biotecx, Houston, TX) and quantitated by absorbance at 260 nm. Poly(A)+RNA was prepared by oligo(dT) affinity chromatography using the Poly(A)Quik kit (Stratagene). Extension reaction was carried out on ≈5 μg of adult mouse liver poly(A)+RNA with synthetic oligonucleotide complementary to portions of the GH receptor mRNA. The 18-base oligonucleotide designated mGHR1 is defined by complementarity of its 5′-end beginning 49 nucleotides (nt) upstream of the translation start site of the GH receptor mRNA (8Smith W.C. Kuniyoshi J. Talamantes F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 984-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The primer was 32P end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and hybridized with RNA in 50 m M Tris-HCl, 50 m M KCl, 10 m M MgCl2, 20 m M dithiothreitol, 1 m M dNTPs, and 0.5 m M spermidine. The extension reaction was initiated by the addition of 2.8 m M sodium pyrophosphate and 1 unit of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) and allowed to proceed for 30 min at 41.5°C. After termination of the reaction, the reaction products were size fractionated by denaturing gel electrophoresis. The sizes of the extension products were determined both by including kinased DNA markers on the gel and by counting the number of nucleotides in a concurrently run sequencing ladder. Using experimentally established sequence information, PCR was used to amplify a genomic DNA sequence upstream of mGHR1. This 211-nt fragment was then subcloned into the plasmid pBluescript II SK+ to create pSK(−200). This construct was used to generate 32P-labeled antisense RNA, which was hybridized to ≈20 μg of adult mouse liver total RNA at 42°C for 12 h. Following digestion with RNase A and RNase T1, the RNase-resistant radioactivity was size fractionated on 5% urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiographed. The sizes of the protected fragments were determined by comparison with kinased DNA markers and a sequencing ladder as described above. Luciferase reporter gene constructs were engineered to contain various portions of the GH receptor 5′-flanking region in the promoterless pGL2-Basic vector (Promega). Construction of the reporter gene-GH receptor 5′-flanking region hybrids were as follows: a 6.5-kb HindIII fragment cloned into the corresponding site in the polylinker of pGL2-Basic was digested with SacI and religated to obtain pGL2B-3.6. Exonuclease III digestion was performed to delete exon 1-intron 1 junction from pGL2B-3.6 so that the modified fusion construct (pGL2B-3.6[+53]kb) contained 53 base pairs of the first non-coding exon (exon 1). pGL2B-3.6[+53]kb was digested with ApaI and SacI and, following blunt ending, religated to obtain pGL2B-3.0[+53]kb. Progressive unidirectional deletions of the GH receptor 5′-flanking DNA in this pGL2B-3.0[+53]kb construct were engineered by exonuclease III digestion such that all the constructs had identical 3′-ends defined by the inclusion of the first 53 bp of exon 1. All constructs were partially sequenced through their vector-insert junction to verify directionality. Expression of the pGL2-Control plasmid (Promega), which contains the SV40 promoter and enhancer sequences, was measured to monitor transfection efficiency. The activities of putative enhancer elements were also tested via the ability to exhibit activity in the context of an heterologous promoter. For this purpose, luciferase vector pTK81 (ATCC) containing the thymidine kinase promoter was chosen (12Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-458PubMed Google Scholar). The fusion constructs were engineered by exploiting convenient restriction sites in the vector polylinker. The culture media and the hormones used for tissue culture experiments were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. and Sigma, respectively, unless otherwise stated. HepG2 cells (ATCC) were maintained in Williams' Medium E containing 2 m M glutamine, 5% fetal calf serum, and penicillin G (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml); Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin G (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). 1 × 106cells were plated on 60-mm plates 24 h prior to transfection. 15 μg of plasmid DNA was transfected per plate using the calcium phosphate transfection method (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 6 h of incubation, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then supplemented with medium for 40 h prior to harvest for luciferase assay. Adult hepatocytes were obtained from 80-100-g Wistar rats by the in situ perfusion method of Berry and Friend (13Berry M.N. Friend D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1969; 43: 506-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (3628) Google Scholar), and fetal hepatocytes were isolated by in vitro collagenase digestion (14DeSante D.C. Little L. Peavy D.E. Vinicor F. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) after harvesting the liver from fetuses of 19-day gestation. Following separation on a Percoll gradient, the hepatocytes (>90% viability as assessed by Trypan Blue exclusion) were resuspended in adhesion medium (75% minimum essential medium, 25% Waymouths medium, 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml fungizone) before plating onto 60-mm Primaria plates (Falcon, Lincoln Park, NJ) at a density of 2 × 106in 2 ml of adhesion medium per plate. After incubation in 95% O2, 5% CO2at 37°C for 4-5 h, the medium was replaced by transfecting medium (75% minimum essential medium, 25% Waymouths medium, 20 μg/ml gentamycin, 10 μg/ml transferrin, 30 μM selenium, 100 microunits/ml hGH, 1.5 μM porcine insulin, 1 μM dexamethasone, and 1 μM 3,5,3′-triiodo- L-thyronine). The transfection was performed according to the method of Graham and Van Der Eb (15Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (6490) Google Scholar), as modified by Ginot et al. (16Ginot F. Decaux J.F. Cognet M. Berbar T. Levrat F. Khan A. Weber A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). 18 h after transfection, the plates were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells were harvested by the addition of 200 microliters of lysis buffer (25 m M Tris-phosphate, pH 7.8, 2 m M dithiothreitol, 2 m M EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100). Following a brief freeze-thaw cycle, the insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation at 4°C for 2-3 min at 12,000 × g. The supernatant was then immediately assayed for luciferase activity. All transfections were performed at least in triplicate. Protein concentration of the supernatant was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Luciferase activity was measured in the cell lysates using reagents from Analytical Luminescence Laboratory (San Diego, CA). Briefly, using the automatic injectors of the Monolight 2010 Luminometer (Analytical Luminescence), 100 microliters (≈200 μg) of cell extract was mixed sequentially with 100 microliters of buffer (3 m M ATP, 15 m M MgSO4, 30 m M Tricine, 10 m M dithiothreitol, pH 7.8) and 100 microliters of 1 m M luciferin; the light output was measured for 30 s. Determinations of protein concentration were used to convert raw activity values to specific activities for all samples. The results of the luciferase assay are expressed as -fold increase over the background specific activity determined by transfecting equimolar amounts of the appropriate vector DNA (i.e. pGL2-Basic or pTK81) in each experiment. Nuclear extracts from mouse liver were prepared as described by Gorski et al. (17Gorski K. Carneiro M. Schibler U. Cell. 1986; 47: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). Protease inhibitors (2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1% aprotinin) were included in the buffers used to prepare the nuclear extracts. Double-stranded DNA fragments used as probes were obtained either by restriction enzyme digestion and subsequent gel purification after agarose electrophoresis or by annealing complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides. The DNA was labeled with 32P using Klenow enzyme. Approximately 6 fmol of DNA was added to 4 μg of nuclear extract in a final volume of 50 microliters containing 1.7 μg of poly(dI˙dC), 20 m M Hepes, pH 7.9, 100 m M KCl, 5% glycerol, 1 m M EDTA, and 1 m M dithiothreitol. Following incubation at room temperature for 30 min, DNA-protein complexes were resolved on a 6-10% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel with 90 m M Tris borate, 2 m M EDTA buffer. Competition experiments included the addition of excess unlabeled DNA fragments to the reaction mix. The pTK81 vector containing the 552-bp DNA was linearized with HindIII and end labeled with Klenow enzyme. After a secondary digest with KpNI, the purified labeled 552-bp fragment was incubated with nuclear extracts in a final volume of 50 microliters with buffer containing 1.7 μg of poly(dI˙dC), 20 m M Hepes, pH 7.9, 100 m M KCl, 5% glycerol, 1 m M EDTA, and 1 m M dithiothreitol for 30 min at 4°C, after which varying concentrations of DNase I were added and allowed to react for 10-30 s. The reactions were stopped with EDTA, phenol-chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation. The digested DNA was size fractionated on 6% urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiographed. The exact locations of the DNase I footprints were determined by comparison to a Maxam-Gilbert sequencing reaction electrophoresed concurrently. Six λ clones were isolated after screening approximately 2 × 106plaque-forming units with the 5′-end of mouse GH receptor cDNA. As the genomic structure of the mouse GH receptor gene was not known, we synthesized a panel of non-overlapping oligonucleotides that spanned the 131 bp of the most 5′-region of the mouse GH receptor cDNA. These oligonucleotides were then used to screen the λ clones isolated. One of the clones, designated λ167A, hybridized to the oligonucleotide containing the most 5′-nucleotide. Direct PCR sequencing of λ167A revealed that this clone contained the first 88 bases (hereafter referred to as exon 1) of the most 5′-sequence of the published cDNA (8Smith W.C. Kuniyoshi J. Talamantes F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 984-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) and about 8 kb of the first intron (Fig. 1). Since λ167A did not contain exon 2, the exact size of intron 1 remains to be determined. Primer extension was performed using reverse transcriptase after end-labeled antisense oligonucleotide (mGHR1) was hybridized to poly(A)+-enriched RNA from pregnant adult mouse liver. The extension of mGHR1 produced two major specific bands of 61 and 87 nucleotides (Fig. 2 A). In addition, three minor bands were noticed in close proximity (within 2 nucleotides) of the 61-nucleotide product. Identical extension products were obtained from RNA extracted from non-pregnant female and male mice. To demonstrate that the full 5′-untranslated region was contained within the putative first exon (exon 1), ribonuclease protection assays were performed. 32P-Labeled antisense RNA, transcribed from the appropriate strand of pSK(−200), was hybridized to total cellular RNA from liver of female mice and digested with RNase A and T1. The major protected fragments were 61 and 87 nucleotides in length (Fig. 2 A). In a pattern identical to that obtained with the primer extension experiment, three additional protected fragments were detectable clustered around the 61-nucleotide band. Since the 5′-end of the antisense probe is defined by mGHR1, the demonstration that the size of these protected fragments is identical to the length of the primer extension products confirms the location of the transcription start sites at 100 and 126 bp upstream of the exon 1-intron 1 junction (Fig. 1). Sequence analysis in the immediate upstream region from these transcription start sites revealed consensus sequences for TATA boxes located −23 and −52 from the proximal transcription start site (Fig. 1). In addition, this sequence analysis revealed the presence of consensus binding sequences for some common transcription factors such as AP-2 and NF-IL6 (Fig. 1). The functional role of the 5′-flanking region in the regulation of transcription of the GH receptor gene was assessed by its ability to drive expression of the luciferase reporter gene. A 3.6-kb fragment of the 5′-flanking region of the GH receptor gene, devoid of the exon 1-intron 1 junction, was inserted immediately upstream of the luciferase reporter gene contained in the promoterless expression vector pGL2-Basic. This fusion construct (pGL2B-3.6[+53]) exhibited significant luciferase expression when transiently transfected into HepG2 hepatoma cells (Fig. 3). In multiple transfection experiments, the relative expression of luciferase using pGL2B-3.6[+53] was consistently about 10-fold greater than the background measured with the promoterless vector and 30% of that observed with the positive control that contains the SV40 promoter/enhancer. Ribonuclease protection assays with RNA isolated from the transfected cells indicated that the transcription initiation sites utilized by the fusion construct corresponded to the two major start sites identified in RNA extracted from whole liver tissue (Fig. 2 B). Hence, we conclude that expression of the reporter gene in the fusion construct was initiated at sites identical to that used by the GH receptor gene in liver tissue. We observed that cotransfection of plasmid pCAT (Promega) as an internal reference significantly decreased the expression of the luciferase fusion construct. This decrease occurred with various preparations of pCAT and luciferase fusion construct DNA and over a range of molar ratios between the two DNAs. Transcriptional interference between a cotransfected reference plasmid and expression plasmids containing gene-specific promoters has also been observed by other investigators (18Ponder K.P. Dunbar R.P. Wilson D.R. Darlington G.J. Woo S.L.C. Hum. Gene Ther. 1991; 2: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 19O'Mahoney J.V. Brandon M.R. Adams T.E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 101 (abstr.): 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although this interference precluded the cotransfection of pCAT for purposes of normalization of transfection efficiency between experiments, we believe that the conclusions derived from our transient transfection experiments are valid for the following reasons. 1) The activity of pGL2B-3.6[+53] construct was tested at least six times in triplicate, and the same relative increase in transcriptional activity was observed in each experiment. 2) Triplicate samples in a single experiment varied by less than 20%. 3) Similar results were obtained when DNA prepared by different methods (i.e. cesium chloride-ethidium bromide gradient (9Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), polyethylene glycol precipitation (9Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), or anion exchange resin (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA)) was used for transient transfection. 4) Ribonuclease protection assays established that expression of the reporter gene in the fusion construct was initiated at sites identical to that used by the GH receptor gene in liver tissue. 5) The magnitude of promoter activity is similar to that reported for the recently described ovine GH receptor gene (19O'Mahoney J.V. Brandon M.R. Adams T.E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 101 (abstr.): 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To localize putative cis-acting elements regulating transcription of the GH receptor gene, we used exonuclease III to obtain progressively shorter fragments of GH receptor 5′-DNA (Fig. 3), and the expression of these deletion mutants was examined by transient transfection assays. Whereas deletion of the 552-bp of the 5′-upstream region (pGL2B-3.0[+53]) resulted in a significant decrease (60%) in promoter activity (Fig. 3), serial deletions of the next 2845 nucleotides (pGL2B-1.3[+53], pGL2B-422[+53], and pGL2B-385[+53]) did not result in a significant change in expression. These results indicate that the sequence between −3.6 and −3.0 kb is involved in regulation of expression, and the region between −3.0 and −385 bp is devoid of significant regulatory activity. The shortest fragment of DNA that exhibited activity was the 385-bp fragment; the luciferase-fusion construct containing the 155-bp fragment of the 5′-flanking DNA of the GH receptor DNA (pGL2B-155[+53]) did not show any significant activity (Fig. 3). Thus, the deletional analysis demonstrates that a fragment extending from +53 to between −155 and −385 is sufficient for basal promoter activity, and the 552-bp region between −3.6 and −3.0 kb is essential for enhanced expression of the reporter gene. To examine the potential cell-type specificity of the GH receptor promoter, the activities of the various reporter gene constructs were assayed in CHO and 3T3 fibroblasts. The expression profiles of these various constructs were essentially similar in HepG2, CHO, and 3T3 fibroblasts (data not shown). These results showed that the deletion of the 552-bp region between −3.6 and −3.0 kb resulted in a significant loss of activity in all of the cell lines tested (Fig. 4), suggesting that the enhancer element located within this 552-bp region may not be involved in tissue-specific regulation of GH receptor gene expression. The reduced expression consequent on deletion of the 552-bp region located between 3.0 and 3.6 kb upstream of the transcription start site suggested the presence of an enhancer element(s) within this region. To localize and characterize the putative enhancer element, DNase I footprint assays were conducted to identify the protein binding regions within this DNA fragment. Based on the observation that expression of the GH receptor gene is maximum in liver tissue, crude nuclear extracts from female mouse liver were used in DNase I footprint assays. DNase I digestion of the 552-bp fragment labeled with 32P on one strand established that nuclear extracts from adult mouse liver protected a 30-bp region (designated FP1) within the 552 fragment (Fig. 5). Separate footprint assays performed with each strand of DNA uniquely labeled established that an identical region was protected on both strands. EMSA was used to test the protein binding activity of the FP1 sequence with crude nuclear extracts from female mouse liver. Addition of nuclear extracts from female mouse liver to an aliquot of 32P-labeled FP1 resulted in the formation of a single protein-DNA complex (Fig. 6). To determine whether the DNA-protein complex was sequence specific, we performed competition experiments in which the binding reaction was carried out in the presence of increasing concentrations of either unlabeled FP1 or an unlabeled 30-bp oligonucleotide with random sequence (5′-CCCATGTTAGAATCCCAGCTTATACCCGCAGGCACAACA-3′). Whereas a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled FP1 eliminated the formation of the DNA-protein complex, the random sequence oligonucleotide did not affect the binding even at a 400-fold molar excess (Fig. 6). Thus, these results demonstrate that these protein-DNA complexes are sequence specific. Experiments with nuclear protein extracts from liver tissue of adult male mice and adult male rats (Fig. 7) also revealed sequence-specific DNA-protein complexes of similar size. Since GH receptor expression in the kidney is second only to that in the liver (7Waters M.J. Barnard R.T. Lobie P.E. Lim L. Hamlin G. Spencer S.A. Hammonds R.G. Leung D.W. Wood W.I. Acta Paediatr. Scand. 1990; 366: 60-72Crossref Google Scholar), we tested the ability of nuclear proteins from the kidney to bind to FP1. Nuclear extracts from adult mouse kidney formed a DNA-protein complex with FP1 that migrated with similar electrophoretic mobility as the complex formed with liver nuclear proteins (Fig. 7). Crude nuclear extracts from HepG2 human hepatoma cells also formed a sequence-specific DNA-protein complex with FP1 that migrated with an electrophoretic mobility similar to that formed with mouse liver and kidney nuclear proteins (data not shown), suggesting that there is a human homolog of the FP1 binding protein(s) present in rodent liver. In contrast to the experiments using FP1, no specific binding of nuclear proteins from liver was found with other regions of the 552-bp fragment (data not shown). Thus, these experiments along with the DNase I footprint assay demonstrate that the 30-bp FP1 sequence is the only element within the 552-bp fragment that exhibits protein binding activity. Computer analysis of the nucleotide sequence of FP1 did not reveal any potential DNA binding motifs for known transcription factors. To exclude the possibility that this region contained binding sites for known transcription factors that did not closely match consensus sequences, competition experiments were also performed using readily available oligonucleotides with consensus sequences for some common transcription"
https://openalex.org/W1550582981,"Squalene synthetase (SQS, EC 2.5.1.21) catalyzes the first committed step in the formation of cholesterol and thus represents an ideal site for selectively inhibiting sterol formation. Previous studies have demonstrated that the fungal metabolite, zaragozic acid A (ZGA-A), inhibits SQS activity by mimicking the substrate farnesyl pyrophosphate, the reaction intermediate presqualene pyrophosphate, or both, through a process that confers increased apparent potency in the presence of reduced enzyme concentrations, an observation consistent with either tight binding reversible competitive inhibition or mechanism-based irreversible inactivation. The studies outlined in this report provide multiple lines of evidence indicating that ZGA-A acts as a mechanism-based irreversible inactivator of SQS. 1) Inhibition of SQS by ZGA-A is dependent on the [SQS] present in the incubation reaction, and this inhibition is time-dependent and follows pseudo-first order reaction kinetics, exhibiting kobsvalues that range between 2 × 10−4/s and 23 × 10−4/s for [ZGA-A] within the log-linear range of the inhibition curve, and a bimolecular rate constant of 2.3 × 105 m−1 s−1. 2) SQS activity is titratable by ZGA-A, such that for each [ZGA-A] evaluated, inactivation exhibits a threshold [SQS] whereby enzyme activity at lower [SQS] is totally inhibited. 3) Time-dependent inactivation exhibits saturation kinetics with a Km for the process of 2.5 n M, which is approximately equal to the IC50for SQS inhibition under these conditions, suggesting that inactivation results from selective modification of a functional group of the enzyme active center rather than from a nonspecific bimolecular reaction mechanism and that most, if not all of the inhibition results from irreversible inactivation. 4) Saturable, time-dependent inactivation occurs with similar inactivation kinetics for both the microsomal and trypsin-solubilized forms of the enzyme, indicating that irreversible inactivation by ZGA-A is not a consequence of membrane modification but is a direct effect of the inhibitor on the enzyme. 5) Inactivation is biphasic, exhibiting a rapid (“burst”) phase followed by a second, pseudo-first order phase, similar to that previously noted for irreversible inactivators in other enzyme systems, and occurs even in the presence of 5 m M concentrations of the nucleophylic scavenger dithiothreitol, suggesting that the reaction between ZGA-A and SQS occurs at or near the active center prior to diffusion of reactive species out of the catalytic cleft. 6) Inactivation can be prevented through competition with the substrate, farnesyl pyrophosphate, further identifying the active center as the site of modification. 7) The inhibitory effects of ZGA-A cannot be reversed either by lowering the [ZGA-A] to noninhibitory levels by dilution or by removal of unreacted ZGA-A from the enzyme by repetitive centrifugation, suggesting that enzyme modification is covalent. 8) The α,β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety of ZGA-A, which is similar to related Michael acceptor moieties present in a variety of mechanism-based inactivators identified in other enzyme systems, appears to be required for eliciting the time-dependent irreversible inactivation of SQS by ZGA-A and related α,β-unsaturated carbonyl-containing analogs. 9) Observations similar to those described above were not noted for any of a number of other competitive inhibitors of SQS from a variety of diverse structural classes, whose Ki values for SQS inhibition ranged from 3 to 700 n M, suggesting that the mechanism-based irreversible inactivation of SQS by ZGA-A appears to be specific to this class of compounds rather than to inhibition of SQS per se. These observations strongly suggest that inhibition of SQS by ZGA-A and related analogs occurs through a mechanism-based irreversible inactivation process, presumably with formation of a covalent ZGA-A-SQS adduct that is catalytically incompetent. ZGA-A and related analogs may thus serve as useful tools for probing the substrate binding sites and catalytic reaction centers within the active center of SQS and for further evaluating the unique catalytic mechanisms of this important enzyme.

A series of receptor-active glycolipids with Galα4Gal in common, previously shown to be recognized by these bacteria, was identified by use of specific monoclonal antibodies, fast-atom bombardment and electron-impact mass spectrometry, and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy: galabiosylceramide (Galα4GalβCer), globotriaosylceramide (Galα4Galβ4GlcβCer), globoside (GalNAcβ3Galα4Galβ4GlcβCer), the Forssman glycolipid (GalNAcα3GalNAcβ3Galα4Galβ4GlcβCer), Galβ4GlcNAcβ6(Galβ3)GalNAcβ3Galα4Galβ4GlcβCer, and Galβ4(Fucα3)GlcNAcβ6(Galβ3)GalNAcβ3Galα4Galβ4GlcβCer.The binding pattern for mouse kidney glycolipids differed from that for kidney glycolipids of man and monkey. In particular, the dominant 8-sugar glycolipid in the mouse was not detected in the primates. A second difference was found in the binding of E. coli to kidney glycoproteins on blots after electrophoresis; the mouse showed distinct receptor-active bands while human and monkey did not.

An important factor in the pathogenesis of bacterial infections is the ability of the bacteria to adhere to host tissues (1Beachey E.H. J. Infect. Dis. 1981; 143: 325-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar), often by means of specific binding of bacterial adhesins to host cell carbohydrates (2Mirelman D. Ofek I. Mirelman D.

With respect to human and dog urinary tract infection, clinical isolates of E. coli differ in adhesin class, which is related to different glycolipid patterns of the two species. In isolates of human origin, the class II adhesin predominates.

It is therefore of interest to investigate the carbohydrate basis for E. coli adhesion in this animal. Thus, model C3H/HeN mice were analyzed for the presence of receptor-active glycoconjugates in various parts of the urinary tract using both clinical isolates and recombinant strains of uropathogenic E. coli. It was found that the isoreceptor pattern differed significantly from that found in human and monkey urinary tract with respect to both glycolipids and glycoproteins. Female C3H/HeN mice (original breeding stock, Charles River Laboratories, Margate, Kent, UK) were kept at the animal facilities at the Department of Infection and Immunology, Astra Arcus, S-181 85 Södertälje, Sweden, where the model infections were performed.2The mice were used at 8-10 weeks of age. The animals were anesthetized with diethyl ether and tissues were removed using sterile instruments. Kidneys from 60 animals, and urethers, bladders, and urethrae (in one piece) from 10 animals were obtained. The tissues were immediately frozen using cryostat spray and stored at −70°C until analysis was performed. Before lipid extraction the urethers were separated from bladders plus urethrae. Lipids were extracted with a Soxhlet apparatus using chloroform/methanol (2:1 for 24 h, and 1:9 for 24 h). The combined extracts were subjected to mild-alkaline hydrolysis (0.2 M KOH in methanol, 3 h), dialyzed against water, and purified on a silica straight-phase column. No further purification of lipids from urethers and bladders plus urethrae, 2.1 and 2.7 mg, respectively, was carried out, while the purification of the mouse kidney preparation continued as described by Karlsson (19Karlsson K.-A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The kidney glycosphingolipids were separated into two main fractions, a neutral one containing uncharged lipids, 8.5 mg, and an acid fraction containing gangliosides and other charged lipids. Fractionation of neutral glycolipids was achieved by HPLC chromatography on a Spherisorb S10W silica column, 250 × 8-mm inner diameter, particle size 10 μm (Phase Separation Ltd., Queensferry, UK). The glycolipid mixture, 6 mg, was applied and eluted with a gradient starting with chloroform/methanol/water, 60:35:8 (by volume unless otherwise stated), and ending with 10:10:3, 2 ml/min. Mild hydrolysis of acid glycosphingolipids to remove sialic acid was achieved in 1 ml of acetic acid/water, 1:100 (300 μg of lipid), 100°C, 1 h. Reference glycosphingolipids were obtained as follows: globotriaosylceramide, globoside, and P1 glycolipid from human erythrocytes (20Stults C.L.M. Sweeley C.C. Macher B.A. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 179: 167-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), Leaand Lebfrom human small intestine (21Björk S. Breimer M.E. Hansson G.C. Karlsson K.-A. Leffler H. J.

Strömberg N. FEBS Lett. 1982; 139: 291-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Reference mixtures of glycolipids were obtained from dog intestine, calf brain, human kidneys, human erythrocytes (blood group A), and human primary liver cancer, which contains Lexstructures (20Stults C.L.M. Sweeley C.C. Macher B.A. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 179: 167-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). For analysis of glycolipid mixtures using bacteria and antibodies, the glycolipids were separated on TLC with chloroform/methanol/water, 60:35:8, on aluminum backed silica nano plates of 0.2-mm phase thickness (Merck, Germany). Chemical detection was done with anisaldehyde (25Waldi D. Stahl E. Dunnschichts-Chromatographie. Springer Verlag, Berlin1962: 496-515Google Scholar) or resorcinol staining (26Svennerholm L. J. Neurochem. 1963; 10: 613-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). The procedure used for incubation of TLC plates with labeled biological reagents has been described (27Karlsson K.-A. Strömberg N. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 220-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Radioactivity was detected by autoradiography (Kodak XAR-5 film, Eastman Kodak). Dried residues (20 mg) remaining after the lipid extraction of C3H/HeN mice and cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis) kidneys were mixed with 1 ml of 50 m M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 2.5% SDS. The mixture was incubated at room temperature overnight (gentle shaking), heated to 95°C for 10 min, and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. To extract residual lipids from the SDS-solubilized material, this was treated with 1-butanol/water, 9:1, three times. Prior to SDS-PAGE of the supernatant, the samples were diluted to 2-4 mg of protein/ml (determined by BCA Protein Assay, Pierce), and 2-mercaptoethanol (5%) was added. SDS-PAGE (gradient gel, 8-25%) and Coomassie R-350 (PhastGel™Blue R, Pharmacia) staining were carried out with a Pharmacia Phast System™(Pharmacia, Sweden) according to the protocols of the manufacturer. Briefly, samples were heated to 95°C for 5 min and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 2 min before electrophoresis to remove unsolubilized material. After electrophoresis the gel was either stained for protein or sugar (Glycan detection kit, Boehringer, Germany), or electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (0.45 μm) in 20% methanol containing 192 m M glycine and 25 m M Tris at pH 8.3. For incubation with bacteria, the nitrocellulose membrane with electroblotted proteins was preincubated in blocking solution (3% bovine serum albumin, 50 m M Tris-HCl, 200 m M NaCl, 0.1% NaN3, pH 8.0) for 1.5 h. The membrane was then incubated with 35S-labeled E. coli in phosphate-buffered saline (0.14 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 0.14 M NaCl, 5 m M KCl). After 1.5-2 h the membrane was washed in 50 m M Tris-HCl, 0.2 M NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20 (pH 8.0), dried at room temperature, and exposed to x-ray film overnight. Mass spectra were obtained with a ZAB-2F/HF (VG Analytical, Manchester, UK) and a Jeol SX 102A (Jeol, Tokyo, Japan), both sector instruments, either in the positive-EI or negative-FAB mode (Xe atom bombardment, 8 kV). Triethanolamine was used as matrix. Methylation was performed according to Ref. 28Larson G. Karlsson H. Hansson G.C. Pimlott W. Carbohydr. Res. 1987; 161: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar (and references therein) and gas chromatography-mass spectroscopic analysis of partially methylated alditol acetates was done according to Refs. 29Stellner K.

Chem. 1971; 246: 1192-1200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. For analysis of partially methylated alditol acetates, a quadropole MS (Trio-II, VG Masslab, Altricham, UK) was used. The capillary column was a DB-1, 15 m × 0.25 mm, inner diameter, 0.2-μm film thickness (J& Scientific). FAB-MS analysis of glycolipids was performed directly from the TLC plate as described (31Karlsson K.-A. Lanne B. Pimlott W. Teneberg S. Carbohydr. Res. 1991; 221: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) with the first MS of a Jeol HX/HX110A instrument. The conditions for the aquisition of EI spectra were: 70 eV electron ionization potential, 10 kV accelerating voltage, 300 μA trap current, ion source temperature 375°C, and scan time 26 s. 1H NMR spectra on deuterium-exchanged glycolipid fractions were acquired at 11.74 telsa on a JEOL ALPHA-500 (Jeol, Tokyo, Japan). Samples were dissolved in 0.5 ml of Me2SO/D2O, 98:2, and spectra recorded at 30°C with a digital resolution of 0.4 Hz. Chemical shifts are given relative to tetramethylsilane using the internal solvent peak. Nuclear Overhauser enhancements were measured using the standard software of the instrument. The recycle time was at least five times the longitudinal relaxation time (T1). Four different P-fimbriated E. coli strains were used, HB101/pPIL291-15 (a gift from Dr. I. van Die, Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and Dr. B. Westerlund, University of Helsinki, Finland (32de Ree J.M. Schwillens P. van den Bosch J.F. FEMS Microbiol. 1985; 29: 91-97Google Scholar)), HB101/pPAP5 (33Lindberg F.P. Lund B. Normark S.

Tullus, S:t Görans barnsjukhus, Stockholm, Sweden (36Tullus K. Hörlin K. Svenson S.B. Källenius G. J. Infect. Dis. 1984; 150: 728-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar)). The bacteria were cultivated on colonization factor agar plates supplemented with [35S]methionine (400 μCi/10 ml, Amersham International, UK) at 37°C overnight. They were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline to approximately 1 × 109colony-forming units/ml. The bacteria were diluted to an activity of approximately 1 × 106cpm/ml. The following mouse monoclonal antibodies were used: anti-Lex(BL-G15, Monosan, Bio-Zak, Järfälla, Sweden), three antibodies binding to terminal Galα4Gal sequences, pk002, P001, and MC2102 = 87:5 (all obtained from Accurate Chemical & Science Corp., New York); and anti-Forssman (MAS033b, Seralab, Göteborgs Termometerfabrik, Sweden). The secondary antibodies used (rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins, Z109, DAKO A/S, Denmark) were labeled with 125I (37Aggarwal B.B. Eessalu T.E. Haas P.E. Nature. 1985; 318: 665-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Minimum energy conformers of the GL-III glycolipid, identified below as Galβ4(Fucα3)GlcNAcβ6(Galβ3)GalNAcβ3Galα4Galβ4GlcβCer, were calculated within the Biograf molecular modeling program (Molecular Simulations Inc.) using the Dreiding-II force field (38Mayo S.L. Olafson B.O. Goddard III, W.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1990; 94: 8897-8909Crossref Scopus (5061) Google Scholar) on a Silicon Graphics 4D/35TG workstation. Partial atomic charges were generated using the charge equilibration method (39Pappé A.K. Goddard III, W.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1991; 95: 3358-3363Crossref Scopus (2658) Google Scholar), and a distance dependent dielectric constant ϵ = 3.5r was used for the Coulomb interactions. In addition a special hydrogen bonding term was used in which Dhb was set to 4 kcal/mol. The acid and neutral glycosphingolipids of C3H/HeN mouse kidneys were isolated and purified separately. TLC separations of the neutral glycosphingolipids visualized chemically with anisaldehyde are shown in Fig. 1 A. For comparison, glycolipids from human kidneys, as well as purified globoside, were included in the chromatogram. The neutral glycolipids from mouse kidneys are dominated by a very slow-moving band with more than 6 sugars (GL-III, Fig. 1) although several more weakly-staining bands, particularly in the 3-4-sugar region, are also seen. The mixture of acid glycolipids from mouse kidneys and the crude preparations of lipids from urethers and bladders plus urethrae were used for bacterial binding studies. The latter preparations were not purified sufficiently for chemical staining (the bands seen in Fig. 1 of urethers and bladders plus urethrae do not have the green color characteristic of glycoconjugates stained with anisaldehyde). Initially P-fimbriated E. coli, HB101/pPIL291-15, which binds very strongly to Galα4Gal-containing glycolipids, was used to screen the glycolipid preparations as shown in Fig. 1 B. Globotriaosylceramide, globoside, and the Forssman glycolipid were applied in the first three lanes as references. The bacteria bound strongly to neutral glycolipids from mouse kidneys in the 4-5-sugar region. In addition, four slower moving bands were strongly bound by the bacteria (GL-I, GL-II, GL-III, and GL-IV). The urethers and bladders plus urethrae both contained binding glycolipids in the 4- and 5-sugar regions, while in the preparation of bladders plus urethrae weak binding is also seen to a band in the 3-sugar region and also to a band comigrating with GL-II. For the urether a weak binding band was obtained which had the same mobility as GL-III. The acid glycolipids obtained from the mouse kidneys showed two distinct binding bands (Fig. 1 B) which had the same mobility as GL-II and GL-III. No chemical identification was made of these glycolipids. Antibodies were used to reveal the presence of terminally placed Galα4Gal structures in glycolipids from mouse kidneys. In the 2-sugar region, the binding of the antibody MC2001 showed that Galα4GalβCer was present in mouse kidneys (Fig. 2 A). The three bands probably differed in ceramide composition. Dog intestine was included in the analysis as a positive reference. 3K.-A. Karlsson, unpublished data. In the 3-sugar region, the antibody pk002 bound weakly, Fig. 2 B, but strongly to the reference globotriaosylceramide. The lack of a clear binding by monoclonal antibody P001 indicated that the P1 antigen is absent from mouse kidneys (Fig. 2 C). Further investigation with an antibody specific for the Forssman glycolipid (Fig. 2 D), showed that this glycolipid was present in the mouse but not in human kidneys. A weak band was also detected in the preparation of mouse bladders plus urethrae but not in the urethers. To elucidate the structure of GL-II, GL-III, and GL-IV in the mouse kidneys, the neutral glycolipid mixture was subjected to HPLC fractionation on a silica column. The separation conditions were chosen to optimize separation of slow-moving compounds. Analysis by TLC of the fractions obtained is shown in Fig. 3. Fractions 4 and 5 were analyzed by FAB-MS in two ways after separation by TLC. First, the 3- and 4-sugar regions were scraped off the plates separately, extracted in chloroform/methanol, 2:1, and their mass spectra were collected. Second, they were analyzed by direct TLC FAB-MS. The 2-sugar region gave spectra consistent with (Hex)2Cer, the 3-sugar region with (Hex)3Cer, and the 4-sugar region gave spectra showing that the glycolipid was HexNAcHexHexHexCer. All three compounds had similar ratios of hydroxylated to unhydroxylated ceramide (1:1). HPLC fractions 8 (GL-II), 11 (GL-III), and 15 (GL-IV) were subjected to negative-ion FAB-MS analysis (Fig. 4, A-C, respectively). The glycolipid in fraction 8 was composed of five hexoses (of which at least one was terminal) and two internal N-acetylhexosamines. One of the N-acetylhexosamines was located next to a terminal hexose. The FAB-MS obtained from fraction 11 (Fig. 4 B) showed the presence of five hexoses, two N-acetylhexosamines, and one Fuc. The Fuc and at least one hexose were terminally placed. This glycolipid had two dominating ceramide species which differed by two carbon atoms. The mass spectrum of fraction 15 closely resembled that of fraction 11. However, fraction 15 contained one dominating ceramide species with six carbons less than the light ceramide species of fraction 11. This conclusion was also consistent with the difference in mobility on the TLC plate. Because of the high intensity of m/z 1736.8 and 1387.8 relative to m/z 1590.8 and 1225.7, it is probable that the molecule contained two branching points. This irregular intensity of ions is also seen for fraction 11 (Fig. 4 B). Fractions 11 and 12 were pooled and analyzed by EI-MS as the methylated derivative (Fig. 4 D). Molecular ions of m/z 2347.1 and 2375.2 were obtained which correspond to ceramides with sphingosine and 22- and 24-carbon fatty acids, respectively. These ceramides are also seen at m/z 632.6 and 660.6. Large peaks appear at 638.3, 1087.5, and 1291.5, which correspond to the following oxonium ions: HexHexNAcFuc, (Hex)2(HexNAc)2Fuc, and (Hex)3(HexNAc)2Fuc, respectively. These three oxonium ions, [Ox]+, lose either Fuc [Ox-Fuc+H]+or Hex [Ox-Hex+H]+giving rise to the following sets of ions: m/z 450.2 and 420.2 from 638.3, m/z 899.4 and 869.4 from 1087.5, and m/z 1073.5 and 1103.5 from 1291.5. Ions from terminal Hex (219.1 and 219.1-32 = 187.1) and Fuc (189.1 and 189.1-32 = 157.1) were also obtained. The presence of a set of m/z at 692.6 (Cer), 2173.4 (M-Hex), and 2203.1 (M-Fuc), indicates that minor amounts of the glycolipid might carry phytosphingosine. Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopic analysis of partially methylated alditol acetates was performed on the pooled fractions 13-15 in parallel to analysis of the reference compounds gangliotetraosylceramide and Ley. The following monosaccharides were identified; terminal Gal and Fuc, 4-substituted Gal and Glc, 3-substituted Gal, and 3,4-substituted GlcNAc. A second di-substituted HexNAc, with a longer retention time, but similar MS, was obtained. The anomeric region of the 1H NMR spectrum (Fig. 5 C, Table I) of GL-III (HPLC fraction 10) shows two α-signals (J ≤ 4 Hz) at 4.82 and 4.80 ppm (a and b in Fig. 5 C) corresponding to Fucα3 and Galα4, respectively. These signals can be conclusively assigned from the nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE, magnetic dipole coupling through space) experiments. The NOE between the 4.80 ppm signal and a typical Gal H4 signal at 3.82 ppm (40Scarsdale J.N. Yu R.K. Prestegard J.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 6778-6784Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 41Dabrowski J. Hanfland P. Egge H. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5652-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), as well as a quartet at 3.76 ppm (H2 of Galα), are shown in Fig. 5 B. The Fuc H5 gave rise to a quartet of 4.67 ppm (c in Fig. 5 C). Of the two HexNAcβ signals at 4.61 and 4.49 ppm (d and e in Fig. 5C) the former showed NOEs (Fig. 5 A) to Galα H5 (4.19 ppm) and Galα H4 (3.98 ppm) and also a large NOE to a signal at 3.59 ppm. This corresponds well with published values for the Galα H3 (40Scarsdale J.N. Yu R.K. Prestegard J.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 6778-6784Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 41Dabrowski J. Hanfland P. Egge H. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5652-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and thus confirms the 4.61 ppm signal as arising from the GalNAcβ3 of a globo-core structure. The signal at 4.49 ppm is within the region for GlcNAc shifts, see for example, Ref. 42Hanfland P. Egge H. Dabrowski U. Kuhn S. Roelcke D. Dabrowski J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 5310-5319Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar. Two well separated Galβ signals were seen at 4.29 and 4.26 ppm (f and g in Fig. 5C), respectively, the latter arises from the internal Galβ4 linked to Glc, which in turn was seen at 4.19 ppm, overlapping two other signals. The former Gal is consistent with a terminal Galβ4 of a Lexterminal (43Levery S.B. Nudelman E.D. Andersen N.H. Hakomori S.-i. Carbohydr. Res. 1986; 151: 311-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The other signals at 4.19 ppm (overlapping the Glc anomer) were triplets from the H5 of Galα and a terminal Galβ3 (41Dabrowski J. Hanfland P. Egge H. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5652-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). NOEs were measured from all anomeric protons (not shown), and they confirmed the saccharide sequence as determined above. Since most non-anomeric signals are unassigned, the NOE analysis was based on the multiplicity of signals and their chemical shifts compared to model structure"

Our data establish that Mcm1p is a downstream target of the Sln1 signaling pathway. Yeast Sln1p was recently shown to be involved in osmoregulation and to depend on the Hog1 MAP kinase (Maeda, T., Wurgler-Murphy, S., and Saito, H. (1994) <i>Nature</i> 369, 242-245). We show that <i>SLN1</i>-mediated regulation of Mcm1p activity is independent of the Hog1 MAP kinase, and suggest that the role of <i>SLN1</i> is not restricted to osmoregulation."

Scr. 1987; 27: 199-205Google Scholar reported the first example that preD3⇌ vitamin D3isomerization could be altered in vivo in the sea urchin Psammechinus miliaris. There were three remarkable features for the reaction in the sea urchin. First and most important, the equilibrium of the reaction is dramatically altered and shifted toward preD3at equilibrium (45% in the sea urchin versus 8% in n-hexane at 10°C). The second striking feature for the reaction in the sea urchin was that the rate of conversion of vitamin D3 ⟶ preD3was greatly increased. For example, at 10°C less than 5% of vitamin D3converted to previtamin D3in n-hexane after 1 month (Tian et al., 1993Tian X.Q. Chen T.C. Matsuoka L.Y. Wortsman J. Holick M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14888-14892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast in the sea urchin at the same temperature, it took only about 1-2 days to convert as much as 30-45% of vitamin D3into preD3(Hobbs et al., 1987Hobbs R.N. Hazel C.M. Smith S.C. Carney D.A. Howells A.C. Littlewood A.J. Pennock J.F. Chem. Scr. 1987; 27: 199-205Google Scholar). Last and most unusual was the percentage of vitamin D3at equilibrium was increased as temperature was increased (72 and 78% at 17.5 and 20°C, respectively), which is in contrast to all other known reaction systems reported to date which showed a decrease in the amount of vitamin D3with increasing temperature (Cassis and Weiss, 1982Cassis Jr., E.G.

The shell tissue of sea urchin has been found to have the greatest ability to alter the rate and equilibrium of preD3⇌ vitamin D3isomerization (Hobbs et al., 1987Hobbs R.N. Hazel C.M. Smith S.C. Carney D.A. Howells A.C. Littlewood A.J. Pennock J.F. Chem. Scr. 1987; 27: 199-205Google Scholar). However, the active agent within the shell has not been identified. It is known that more than 90% of mollusk shell consists of inorganic salts, mainly calcium carbonate, and the remainder are proteins and polysaccharides (Rieke et al., 1992Rieke P.C. Tarasevich B.J. Bentjen S.B. Fryxell G.E. Campbell A.A. Bein T. Supramolecular Architecture: Synthetic Control in Thin Films and Solids. Maple Press, York1992: 61-75Google Scholar). Both protein component and pure mineral salts fail to catalyze the isomerization, and the effect of saccharides has not been examined (Hobbs et al., 1987Hobbs R.N. Hazel C.M. Smith S.C. Carney D.A. Howells A.C. Littlewood A.J. Pennock J.F. Chem. Scr. 1987; 27: 199-205Google Scholar). Cyclodextrins, the naturally occurring, truncated cone-shaped oligosaccharides, have received increasing attention in recent years for their ability to complex a variety of guest molecules including steroids into their hydrophobic cavities in aqueous solution (Saenger, 1984Saenger W.

It is known that β-cyclodextrin is capable of forming 2:1 (host/guest) inclusion complexes with vitamin D3(Szejtli et al., 1980Szejtli J. Bolla . Szabó P. Ferenczy T. Pharmazie. 1980; 35: 779PubMed Google Scholar; Szejtli, 1984Szejtli J. Atwood J.L. Davies J.E.P. MacNicol D.D. Inclusion Compounds. Vol. 3.

Therefore, we evaluated β-cyclodextrin as a possible model to mimic the preD3⇌ vitamin D3reaction in the sea urchin and investigated the mechanism by which the reaction kinetics was modulated by this constrained medium. Crystalline β-cyclodextrin, methyl-β-cyclodextrin (mean degree of substitution, 10.5-14.7), α-cyclodextrin, vitamin D3(>99%), and 7-DHC (98%) were purchased from Sigma and were used as received without further purification. n-Butanol (>99%) was obtained from Aldrich. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade n-hexane and 2-propanol were obtained from EM Science (Gibbstown, NJ). PreD3was chemically synthesized by photolysis of 7-DHC solution according to a previous reported method (Tian et al., 1993Tian X.Q. Chen T.C. Matsuoka L.Y. Wortsman J. Holick M.F. J. Biol.

PreD3in n-hexane solution was stored in argon-flushed glass ampoules at −70°C until use, and the purity was checked by HPLC analysis and its UV absorption spectrum. The inclusion complex was prepared by a modified method described by Duveneck et al., 1989Duveneck G.L. Sitzmann E.V. Eisenthal K.B. Turo N.J. J. Phys. Chem. 1989; 93: 7166-7170Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar, i.e. addition of one volume of 1 m M 7-DHC in ethanol to 50 volumes of aqueous β-cyclodextrin solution (15 mg/ml). The prepared solutions were stirred at room temperature for at least 4 h and then filtered to remove possible precipitates to obtain a clear solution. The formation of the inclusion complex was verified by the appearance of characteristic UV absorption spectrum of 7-DHC (MacLaughlin et al., 1982MacLaughlin J.A. Anderson R.R. Holick M.F. Science. 1982; 216: 1001-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Due to 7-DHC's very low water solubility, no UV absorption for 7-DHC could be detected when using pure water as the solvent. The same procedure was used to prepare the inclusion complexes of 7-DHC with α-cyclodextrin and methyl-β-cyclodextrin in aqueous solution. Solutions of 7-DHC inclusion complex were placed in argon-flushed quartz tubes and irradiated on ice by UV-B Medical Sunlamps (National Biological Corp., Cleveland, OH) for 1 min (40 mJ cm−2) (Tian et al., 1993Tian X.Q. Chen T.C. Matsuoka L.Y. Wortsman J. Holick M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14888-14892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For kinetic studies, triplicate exposed solutions were incubated at 5, 30, 37, and 50°C for various durations. Aliquots sampled at each time interval were immediately extracted with a precooled n-butanol/ n-hexane solution (15:85, v/v). The amount of vitamin D3and preD3in each sample was quantified by a previously described HPLC method (Tian et al., 1993Tian X.Q. Chen T.C. Matsuoka L.Y. Wortsman J. Holick M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14888-14892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, Tian et al., 1994Tian X.Q. Chen T.C. Lu Z. Shao Q. Holick M.F. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Due to high excess of β-cyclodextrin (host/guest = 660:1) and the virtual insolubility of free 7-DHC in water, it was expected that 7-DHC, preD3, and vitamin D3were completely complexed with β-cyclodextrin forming readily water-soluble inclusion complexes (Szejtli et al., 1980Szejtli J. Bolla . Szabó P. Ferenczy T. Pharmazie. 1980; 35: 779PubMed Google Scholar; Szejtli, 1984Szejtli J. Atwood J.L. Davies J.E.P. MacNicol D.D. Inclusion Compounds. Vol. 3. Academic Press, New York1984: 331-390Google Scholar). Therefore, the following reversible thermal isomerization existed in the exposed solutions: preD3-(β-cyclodextrin)2 ⇌ vitamin D3-(β-cyclodextrin)2(Eq. 1) In analogy to the thermal interconversion between free preD3and vitamin D3in solutions, rate constants (k1and k2), equilibrium constant (K), and thermodynamic activation parameters were calculated by using standard methods for reversible first-order reactions (Tian et al., 1993Tian X.Q. Chen T.C. Matsuoka L.Y. Wortsman J. Holick M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14888-14892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, Tian et al., 1994Tian X.Q. Chen T.C. Lu Z. Shao Q. Holick M.F. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In brief, the rate constants were obtained from the slopes of the plots of ln[(De - Do)/(De - Dt)] versus reaction time t. The equilibrium constants were equal to the ratios of forward rate constants (k1) over reverse rate constants (k2). The standard enthalpy change (Δ Ho) for the reaction was calculated from the van't Hoff plot, and activation energy (Ea) was obtained from Arrhenius plot. Finally, the activation parameters were calculated from Eyring's equation. Incubation of purified preD3in β-cyclodextrin aqueous solution at 37°C for 30 min resulted in the conversion of 60% of preD3into vitamin D3, in contrast to only 1% of conversion in n-hexane (Fig. 2, A and B). For the reverse reaction, in β-cyclodextrin, 19% of vitamin D3was converted into preD3at 37°C within 30 min, whereas in n-hexane no conversion of vitamin D3into preD3was detected at the end of 1 h of incubation (Fig. 2, C and D). The integrated rate equation for the thermal interconversion between preD3and vitamin D3inclusion complexes (Eq. 1) was expressed as ln[(De − Do)I(De − Dt)] = (k1 + k2)t = kt(Eq. 2) where k was the total rate constant, k1 and k2 were the rate constants for the preD3 → vitamin D3 reaction and vitamin D3 → preD3 reaction, respectively. De, D0, and Dt were vitamin D3 concentration at time t reached equilibrium, t = 0 and t = t, respectively. Based on Equation 2, it was expected, and demonstrated (Fig. 3) that the plot of ln [(De - D0)/(De - Dt)] versus reaction time t was linear, and the total rate constant was calculated from the slope of the straight line by least-squares analysis. The determined total rate constants in β-cyclodextrin at 5, 30, 37, and 50°C were 0.0000171 ± 0.0000028 s-1 (correlation coefficient r = 0.973), 0.000246 ± 0.000003 s-1 (r = 0.985), 0.000477 ± 0.000017 (r = 0.992) and 0.00210 ± 0.00021 s-1 (r = 0.993), respectively. The kinetic values (k1, k2, and K) for the preD3 ⇌ vitamin D3 reaction in n-hexane (Tables I and II) were determined at 5 and 37°C (Fig. 3), and at other temperatures, they were calculated based on previously reported data (Tian et al., 1993Tian X.Q. Chen T.C. Matsuoka L.Y. Wortsman J. Holick M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14888-14892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Compared to the preD3 ⇌ vitamin D3 reaction in n-hexane at 5°C, complexing with β-cyclodextrin dramatically accelerated the thermal isomerization rates between preD3 and vitamin D3 resulting in a 49- and 606-fold catalysis for the forward preD3 → vitamin D3 conversion and reverse preD3 → vitamin D3 conversion, respectively (Table I), the highest isomerization rate for the reaction reported to date. At equilibrium the percentage of preD3 in β-cyclodextrin was shifted from less than 8% in n-hexane at 5°C to 49% in β-cyclodextrin.Table I:Temperature dependence on the rate constants of preD3⇌ vitamin D3isomerization in an aqueous solution of β-cyclodextrin (A) and in n- hexane (B)Table I:Temperature dependence on the rate constants of preD3⇌ vitamin D3isomerization in an aqueous solution of β-cyclodextrin (A) and in n- hexane (B)Table II:Temperature dependence on the equilibrium constants of preD3⇌ vitamin D3isomerization in an aqueous solution of β-cyclodextrin and in n- hexaneTable II:Temperature dependence on the equilibrium constants of preD3⇌ vitamin D3isomerization in an aqueous solution of β-cyclodextrin and in n- hexane The temperature dependence of the rate constant was defined by Arrhenius' equation k = A exp(−Eα/RT) or lnk = −Eα/RT + lnA(Eq. 3) where Eα was the activation energy of the reaction, lnA was an integration constant, and A was defined as the frequency factor. Arrhenius plot (Ink against l/T) for the preD3 ⇌ vitamin D3 interconversion was linear over the experimental temperature range (5-50°C), with Ea1 = 82.37 kJ mol-1, Eα2 = 69.34 kJ mol-1, correlation coefficients r1 = -0.998 and r2 = -0.999 (Table III). Compared to the reaction in n-hexane, the activation energies were reduced by 2.53 and 31.16 kJ mol-1 for the forward and reverse process, respectively.Table III:Arrhenius rate parameters and thermodynamic values for preD3⇌ vitamin D3isomerization in an aqueous solution of β-cyclodextrin (A) and in n- hexane (B) The equilibrium constant for preD3⇌ vitamin D3interconversion depends strongly on temperature. The effect of temperature on the equilibrium constant K was given by the van't Hoff equation lnK = − ΔH°/RT + C(Eq. 4) where ΔH˚ was the standard enthalpy change or the heat of the reaction at 25°C, R was the gas constant, and C was an integration constant. Plotting InK against the reciprocal of the absolute temperature (1/T) gave a straight line (r = -0.982) (Fig. 4). The slope of the line (-ΔH˚/R) was -1570, and thus the ΔH˚ was 13.05 kJ mol-1. Therefore, the determined van't Hoff equation for the isomerization between preD3 and vitamin D3 in β-cyclodextrin was expressed as lnK = − 1570/T + 5.63(Eq. 5) Whereas the reported van't Hoff equation (Tian et al., 1993Tian X.Q. Chen T.C. Matsuoka L.Y. Wortsman J. Holick M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14888-14892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for the reaction in n-hexane was lnK = 1882/T − 4.24(Eq. 6) in which ΔH˚ was -15.65 kJ mol-1 These results demonstrate for the first time that whereas in n-hexane and other media the preD3 ⇌ vitamin D3 reaction is exothermic, when the reaction was carried out in β-cyclodextrin solution this isomerization became endothermic (ΔH˚ > 0) (Equations 4 and 5). Fig. 4 compared the effects of temperature on equilibrium constants K in n-hexane and in the β-cyclodextrin solution. It was apparent from Fig. 4 that there existed two distinct mechanisms by which the equilibrium were affected by the changes of temperature. The preD3 ⇌ vitamin D3 interconversion in n-hexane followed the classic mechanism, i.e. as temperature was increased the percentage of vitamin D3 at equilibrium was decreased (Fig. 4 and Equation 6). On the contrary, the isomerization in β-cyclodextrin solution represented a novel mechanism, i.e. the percentage of vitamin D3 at equilibrium was increased as temperature was increased (Fig. 4 and Equation 5). The determined values of standard thermodynamic parameters Δ Go, Δ Ho, and Δ Sofor preD3⇌ vitamin D3interconversion in β-cyclodextrin solution are given in Table III together with the reported values for the reaction carried out in n-hexane (Tian et al., 1993Tian X.Q. Chen T.C. Matsuoka L.Y. Wortsman J. Holick M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14888-14892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). According to transition-state theory, the rate of a reaction at any given temperature depends solely on the concentration of the high energy activated complex. Eyring's equation relates the rate constant to quasithermodynamic parameters by the following expressions k=(kBTκ/h)exp(−ΔG‡/RT)=(kBTκ/h)exp(ΔS‡/R−ΔH‡/RT)(Eq. 7) where kB was Boltzmann's constant, h was Planck's constant, and κ was the transmission coefficient and its value was assumed to be unity during the calculations. The enthalpy and entropy of activation ΔH‡ and ΔS‡ are measures of the heat and entropy changes when reactants are converted to activated complexes, and the determined values for the reaction in β-cyclodextrin solution are listed in Table IV and compared with the reported values for the reaction in n-hexane (Tian et al., 1993Tian X.Q. Chen T.C. Matsuoka L.Y. Wortsman J. Holick M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14888-14892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The free energies of activation, ΔG1‡ (preD3 → vitamin D3) and ΔG2‡~ (vitamin D3 → preD3) were smaller for the reaction carried out in β-cyclodextrin than those in n-hexane (Table IV), which means less energy was needed to bring the reactants to their transition states, and therefore the rate constants were increased for the reaction in β-cyclodextrin solution compared to those in n-hexane (Equation 7 and Table I).Table IV:Activation parameters for preD3⇌ vitamin D3isomerization in an aqueous solution of β-cyclodextrin (A) and in n- hexane (B) Compared to the rate constant in β-cyclodextrin at 37°C, the determined k values in α-cyclodextrin ((2.18 ± 0.0035)×10−5 s−1) and in methyl-β-cyclodextrin ((7.66 ± 0.038) × 10−5 s−1) were decreased by more than 20- and 6-fold, respectively. Whereas the percentage of vitamin D3at equilibrium at 37°C were increased from 64.2 ± 1.8 in β-cyclodextrin to 96.7 ± 0.2 in α-cyclodextrin and 96.6 ± 0.2 in methyl-β-cyclodextrin (Fig. 5). A change in the reaction medium such as polarity, viscosity, etc., can have a substantial influence on the kinetics of chemical reactions. However, from a chemical point of view, these parameters usually do not have a major impact on an intramolecular concerted process. It has been assumed that the rate and equilibrium of preD3⇌ vitamin D3interconversion was only affected by temperature (Hanewald et al., 1961Hanewald K.H. Rappoldt M.P. Roborgh Jr., X. Recl. Trav. Chim. Pays-Bas Belg. 1961; 80: 1003-1014Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar; Schlatmann et al., 1964; Sanders et al., 1969). However, in a biological system, the conventional chemical media have been replaced with diversified physiological environments, such as lipid bilayers, micelles, proteins, nucleic acids, and polysaccharides. In contrast to isotropic solutions, these organized and constrained media have the unusual ability to dramatically modulate the conformational equilibrium of guest molecules that may ultimately lead to catalysis or inhibition by favoring or disfavoring particular conformations. PreD3is conformationally flexible and undergoes rotation around C5-C6single carbon bond to create cZc (s- cis,s- cis) and tZc (s- trans,s- cis) conformations (Fig. 1) (Dauben and Funhoff, 1988aDauben W.G. Funhoff D.J.H. J. Org. Chem. 1988; 53: 5070-5075Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar, Dauben and Funhoff, 1988bDauben W.G. Funhoff D.J.H. J. Org.

Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13811-13819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In isotropic solutions cZc conformation is energetically less stable due to steric interactions between C19 methyl group and C/D rings. The cZc conformers are able to undergo alternative reaction pathways. They can either thermally isomerize to vitamin D3or photochemically convert to lumisterol, whereas the tZc conformers are the precursors solely responsible for the photoproduction of tachysterol (Dauben and Funhoff, 1988aDauben W.G. Funhoff D.J.H. J. Org. Chem. 1988; 53: 5070-5075Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar, Dauben and Funhoff, 1988bDauben W.G. Funhoff D.J.H. J. Org.

Struct. 1992; 267: 93-98Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that the complexation of preD3with β-cyclodextrin shifts its conformational equilibrium in favor of formation of cZc conformation, and therefore the rate constant is increased. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that irradiation of 7-DHC˙β-cyclodextrin complex results in marked increase in the formation of lumisterol with a concomitant decrease in the amount of tachysterol compared with the reaction carried out in isotropic solutions. 2X. Q. Tian and M. F. Holick, unpublished results. The thermodynamics and kinetics of preD3⇌ vitamin D3reaction in β-cyclodextrin solution medium showed striking similarities to those in the sea urchin. First, the equilibrium of the reaction was greatly shifted to preD3, i.e. from 8% in n-hexane to 48% in β-cyclodextrin solution at 10°C, which agrees well with the reported value in the sea urchin (more than 45%) (Hobbs et al., 1987Hobbs R.N. Hazel C.M. Smith S.C. Carney D.A. Howells A.C. Littlewood A.J. Pennock J.F. Chem. Scr. 1987; 27: 199-205Google Scholar). Second, like the reaction in sea urchin, the rate of the isomerization in β-cyclodextrin solution is among the fastest ever known, i.e. more than 40- and 600-fold increases in k1and k2, respectively (Table I). Third, the percentage of vitamin D3at equilibrium in β-cyclodextrin solution is increased as the temperature is raised (Fig. 4), which is determined by the negative slope of the van't Hoff plot (Δ Ho> 0) (Equations 4 and 5). And this is in contrast to all other reported reaction media to date (Schlatmann et al., 1964; Cassis and Weiss, 1982Cassis Jr., E.G. Weiss R.G. Photochem. Photobiol. 1982; 35: 439-444Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar; Yamamoto and Borch, 1985Yamamoto J.K. Borch R.F.

Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Since Δ Ho= Ea1- Ea2, the mechanism responsible for the positive Δ Hois that the activation energy for the reverse reaction (Ea2) is markedly reduced and becomes smaller than Ea1(Table III), i.e. Ea1- Ea2= ΔHo> 0. Based on Arrhenius' equation (Equation 3) it is evident that the rate constant can be increased either by lowering the activation energy (Ea) through the formation of inclusion complex, or by increasing frequency factor (A) through properly orienting C19 and C9of the preD3and vitamin D3molecules, or a combination of both. For the forward reaction, preD3 ⟶ vitamin D3both effects exist and are additive, with Ea1 being lowered by 2.5 kJ mol−1and A1being increased by 17-fold. By this mechanism, the forward rate constant k1for the reaction carried out in β-cyclodextrin solution was increased more than 40 times compared to that in n-hexane at 5°C (Table I). However, the dramatically increased k2is a consequence of a significantly lowered Ea2 being offset by a smaller A2 (Table III). If A2were not decreased, we could have expected that at 5°C, k2for the vitamin D3 ⟶ preD3isomerization in β-cyclodextrin would be increased by a million fold. To examine the effects of cavity size of cyclodextrin on the reaction rate of preD3⇌ vitamin D3isomerization, kinetic studies were carried out in α-cyclodextrin. We found that when the cavity diameter of cyclodextrin was decreased from 6.2 Å (β-cyclodextrin) to 4.9 Å (α-cyclodextrin), the rate constant was decreased by more than 20 times. These results indicate that similar to an enzymatic reaction, the size of the hydrophobic cavity had a great influence on the reaction rate. To assess the influence of outer surface hydroxyl groups of cyclodextrin on the reaction rate, comparisons were made between the reactions in β-cyclodextrin and in methyl-β-cyclodextrin. It was found that reaction rate in β-cyclodextrin was six times faster than that in methyl-β-cyclodextrin. Since partial permethylation had no effect on the cavity size and basic conformation of the cyclodextrin (Myles et al., 1994Myles A.M.C. Barlow D.J. France G. Lawrence M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1199: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), these data suggest for the first time that the host hydroxyl groups can accelerate the reaction rate of the [1,7]-sigmatropic hydrogen shift between preD3and vitamin D3. It is interesting to note that the degree of the acceleration of the reaction rate by intermolecular hydroxyl groups is similar to the reported values for intramolecular hydroxyl-directing effects (π-facial selectivity) on the reactions involving [1,7]-sigmatropic hydrogen shift (Hoeger et al., 1987Hoeger C.A. Johnston A.D. Okamura W.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 4690-4698Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar, Wu and Okamura, 1990Wu K.-M. Okamura W.H. J. Org.

The observation that either changing cavity size or masking host hydroxyl groups resulted in a dramatic increase in the percentage of vitamin D3at equilibrium revealed a novel mechanism by which the equilibrium of preD3⇌ vitamin D3isomerization can be modulated by constrained media. A similar mechanism may exist in vivo by which the preD3⇌ vitamin D3endocrine system is modulated to meet various physiological requirements.

The enzyme has been most extensively characterized in ciliates, where the RNA component has been cloned from several species, and its elongation properties have been characterized in detail. To understand the substrate specificity and protein composition of telomerase, we have used gel shift and UV cross-linking to characterize the enzyme from the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila. In a mobility shift assay, a complex was identified that contained telomerase RNA, co-purified with telomerase activity, and was sensitive to nuclease treatment. The mobility shift complexes specifically formed using several different single-stranded, telomeric sequences but not non-telomeric primers. These results suggest that the specificity of telomerase for G-rich primer sequences occurs at least in part at the level of primer binding. UV cross-linking analysis identified a 100-kDa cross-linked protein that may be a telomerase component. Telomerase is an unusual ribonucleoprotein that synthesizes new telomeres onto chromosome ends.

UV cross-linking analysis identified a 100-kDa cross-linked protein that may be a telomerase component. Chromosome ends are maintained by the unusual DNA polymerase, telomerase. This polymerase, first discovered in Tetrahymena, adds telomeric sequences de novo to chromosome ends to make up for sequence loss during replication (Greider and Blackburn, 1985Greider C.W. Blackburn E.H. Cell. 1985; 43: 405-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2628) Google Scholar; Yu et al., 1990Yu G.L. Bradley J.D. Attardi L.D. Blackburn E.H. Nature. 1990; 344: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Telomerase represents a unique class of DNA polymerase in that it contains an essential RNA component, which serves as an internal template for the addition of telomeric repeat sequences. In Tetrahymena, telomerase processively adds hundreds of telomeric d(TTGGGG)n repeats, one nucleotide at a time, using an internal RNA sequence CAACCCCAA as a template (Greider and Blackburn, 1989Greider C.W. Blackburn E.H. Nature. 1989; 337: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar). The role of the telomerase RNA was demonstrated in two ways. First, inactivation of Tetrahymena telomerase using RNA-complementary oligonucleotides and RNase H cleavage abolished telomerase activity in vitro (Greider and Blackburn, 1989Greider C.W. Blackburn E.H. Nature. 1989; 337: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar). Second, when a telomerase RNA gene mutation in the CAACCCCAA template region was introduced into Tetrahymena, telomeres corresponding to the mutant sequence were synthesized (Yu et al., 1990Yu G.L. Bradley J.D. Attardi L.D. Blackburn E.H. Nature. 1990; 344: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). These results demonstrated that not only is the CAACCCCAA sequence used as a template but also that telomerase is the enzyme which synthesizes telomere sequences in vivo. Telomerase activities with similar properties to the Tetrahymena enzyme have been identified in several different organisms, including hypotrichous ciliates, human, mouse, and Xenopus laevis cells (Lingner et al., 1994Lingner J. Hendrick L.L. Cech T.R. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1984-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar; Mantell and Greider, 1994Mantell L.L. Greider C.W.

Blackburn E.H. Nature. 1989; 337: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar; Lingner et al., 1994Lingner J. Hendrick L.L. Cech T.R.

Science. 1990; 247: 546-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Unlike the binding specificity of many DNA-binding proteins, telomerase primer specificity is not precise. Telomerase can elongate G-rich single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides regardless of the exact sequence of the primer. However, non-telomeric sequence primers are not efficiently elongated (Blackburn et al., 1989Blackburn E.H. Greider C.W. Henderson E. Lee M. Shampay J. Shippen-Lentz D. Genome. 1989; 31: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar; Greider and Blackburn, 1987Greider C.W. Blackburn E.H. Cell. 1987; 51: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). For a given primer 3′ end, telomerase will correctly add the next base in the telomeric sequence. The ability to correctly “fill out” any permutation of the telomeric sequence d(TTGGGG) is likely due to primer alignment with the telomerase RNA sequence CAACCCCAA (Greider and Blackburn, 1989Greider C.W. Blackburn E.H. Nature. 1989; 337: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar). The Tetrahymena telomerase enzyme can be reconstituted in vitro using synthetic telomerase RNA and partially purified telomerase proteins (Autexier and Greider, 1994Autexier C. Greider C.W. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 563-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The reconstituted enzyme has similar elongation specificities as the wild type telomerase. Mutations in the 5′-CAACCCCAA-3′ sequence showed that the 5′ six nucleotides provide template information while the 3′ most CAA sequence is required for aligning primer 3′ ends with the template region. Thus the template region helps determine the specificity for both primer 3′ end sequence and the nucleotides incorporated by telomerase. The “hybridization-directed” model of telomerase elongation predicts that alignment of the substrate 3′ end with telomerase RNA is important for elongation. However, in vivo chromosome healing by telomere addition has been observed in ciliates, yeast, and humans at broken ends that have little or no G-rich sequence (reviewed in Greider (1991a)). In vitro, telomerase will elongate “chimeric” oligonucleotides containing two d(TTGGGG) repeats at the 5′ end followed by up to 36 bases of non-telomeric DNA at the 3′ end (Harrington and Greider, 1991Greider C.W. Cell. 1991; 67: 645-647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). A similar analysis of human telomerase primer specificity in vitro showed that the 3′ end of a primer does not have to be strictly complementary to the RNA template to be elongated (Morin, 1991Morin G.B. Nature. 1991; 353: 454-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the sequences necessary for primer recognition can be spatially separated from the site of telomere addition, and led to the hypothesis that there may be a site of primer recognition, or binding, that is distinct from the site of telomere synthesis (Harrington and Greider, 1991Greider C.W. Cell. 1991; 67: 645-647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar; Morin, 1991Morin G.B. Nature. 1991; 353: 454-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Kinetic analysis using primers with a fixed 3′ but different 5′ end sequences also suggests that there must be a contribution of a site distinct from the template region in primer binding (Lee and Blackburn, 1993Lee M.S. Blackburn E.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6586-6599Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Finally, the non-processive elongation of short primers implies that there must be a second site, or “anchor site” for primer binding (Collins and Greider, 1993Collins K. Greider C.W. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1364-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar; Lee and Blackburn, 1993Lee M.S. Blackburn E.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6586-6599Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). By analogy to RNA polymerases, a primer 10 nucleotides or longer can always be bound at one site or the other during processive elongation, while shorter primers may only be bound at the template site (Collins and Greider, 1993Collins K. Greider C.W. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1364-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). To date all experiments on primer specificity have assayed elongation as the end point. The relative contribution of primer binding and elongation have not been separately determined. We have used a mobility shift assay to directly examine whether the telomerase primer recognition step, like primer elongation, is specific for G-rich sequences. In addition, we have identified a 100-kDa protein which cross-links to telomerase products. The UV cross-linking and gel shift analysis may be useful for the identification of telomerase proteins in other organisms. At all steps in the purification, telomerase elongation activity was assayed as described previously (Harrington and Greider, 1991Greider C.W. Cell. 1991; 67: 645-647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 μl of extract was incubated with 20 μl of a 2 × reaction buffer, such that the final concentration of the added components was 100 μM TTP (Pharmacia), 1 μM [32P]dGTP, 0.1 μg of d(GGGGTT)3in 1 × telomerase buffer (1 m M spermidine, 60 m M K-acetate, 5 m Mβ-mercaptoethanol, and 50 m M Tris acetate, pH 8.5). Incubation at 30°C for 1 h was followed by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation of the radiolabeled products. The dried pellets were resuspended in 2.5 μl of sequencing gel loading buffer (37%, v/v, formamide, and approximately 0.25%, w/v, bromphenol blue, 0.25%, w/v, xylene cyanol), and resolved on a 10%, w/v, denaturing acrylamide gel as described previously (Greider and Blackburn, 1987Greider C.W.

Tetrahymena cells were grown and harvested after 12-18 h of starvation, without subsequent mating (Avilion et al., 1992Avilion A.A. Harrington L.A. Greider C.W. Dev.

Typically, 36 liters of Tetrahymena cells were grown to a density of 3.0-3.5 × 105cells/ml in PPYS (2% w/v proteose peptone (Difco), 0.2%, w/v, yeast extract (Difco), 10 m M FeCl2) at 30°C, pelleted, and starved by resuspension in 8-12 liters of Dryls medium (1.3 m M Na2HPO4, 1.2 m M NaH2PO4, 1.7 m M Na-citrate, 2 m M CaCl2) at 30°C for 12-18 h. Cells were harvested and the cell pellet was lysed at 4°C in 3 volumes of TMG (10 m M Tris, pH 8.0, 1 m M MgCl2, 10%, v/v, glycerol, 5 m Mβ-mercaptoethanol, 100 μM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.25 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, chymostatin, and antipain) and 0.2%, v/v, Nonidet P-40, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g in a SW41 Beckman rotor at 4°C for 1 h. All subsequent purification was carried out at 4°C, and telomerase fractions were quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70°C. Heparin-agarose-purified telomerase was obtained as described previously (Greider and Blackburn, 1987Greider C.W. Blackburn E.H. Cell. 1987; 51: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar) or as follows. The S100 was loaded onto a heparin-agarose (Bio-Rad) column equilibrated with TMG, washed with TMG, and eluted with TMG containing 0.2 M potassium glutamate. The eluate was loaded onto DEAE-agarose (Bio-Rad) column equilibrated with TMG, washed with TMG, 0.15 M potassium glutamate, and eluted with a linear salt gradient of 0.15-0.6 M potassium glutamate in TMG. Some purifications were carried out using a similar procedure as above, except the order of columns was changed to DEAE-agarose, phenyl-Sepharose, and heparin-agarose, followed by spermine-agarose, concentration on a DEAE-agarose column, and sucrose gradient sedimentation (Harrington, 1993Harrington, L. A., 1993, Characterization and Purification of Tetrahymena Telomerase. Ph.D. thesis, University at Stony Brook, Stony, Brook, NY.Google Scholar). Briefly, S100 extract prepared from approximately 1010-1011 cells was loaded onto DEAE-agarose (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in TMG, 0.15 M potassium glutamate (KGlu), and eluted with a linear salt gradient of 0.15 M KGlu to 0.6 M KGlu in TMG. Active fractions were pooled and loaded onto phenyl-Sepharose equilibrated in TMG, 0.4 M KGlu, and eluted with TM, 50%, v/v, ethylene glycol. The pooled active fraction was adjusted to approximately 0.05 M KGlu, loaded onto heparin-agarose (Pharmacia) equilibrated in TMG, and eluted with TMG, 0.2 M KGlu. Active fractions were pooled and loaded onto spermine-agarose (Sigma) equilibrated in TMG, 0.2 M KGlu, and eluted with TMG, 0.6 M KGlu. To concentrate the enzyme, active fractions were diluted to 0.15 M KGlu with TMG, loaded onto a small DEAE-agarose column, and eluted with TMG, 0.4 M KGlu. A portion of the most active eluate (100-150 μl) was loaded onto a 3.6-3.8-ml 7-30%, w/v, sucrose gradient in TMG, 0.4 M KGlu, and centrifuged in a Beckman SW50.1 rotor for 17 h, 150,000 × g at 4°C. Fractions were collected from the bottom to the top of the gradient using a glass capillary tube and a fraction collector, and the samples were immediately assayed for telomerase activity before storage in liquid nitrogen. In this purification scheme, telomerase was purified approximately 100-1000-fold based on measuring the enrichment for the telomerase RNA component (Harrington, 1993Harrington, L. A., 1993, Characterization and Purification of Tetrahymena Telomerase. Ph.D. thesis, University at Stony Brook, Stony, Brook, NY.Google Scholar). The fold purification relative to activity was not possible to determine accurately because activity increased over the first few columns suggesting that inhibitors were being removed. Affinity purification of telomerase extracts was carried out by a modification of the method of Franza et al., 1987Franza B.R. Josephs S.F. Gilman M.Z. Ryan W. Clarkson B. Nature. 1987; 330: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar. Approximately 1 ml of partially purified extract (sizing column, heparin-agarose, DEAE-agarose) was incubated with 75 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads (Bethesda Research Laboratories), and rocked at 4°C for 30 min. The agarose beads were pelleted in a microcentrifuge, and the supernatant was removed to a new tube. To this supernatant was added 30-100 μg of the nonspecific competitor, pBR oligonucleotide (Harrington and Greider, 1991Greider C.W. Cell. 1991; 67: 645-647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and the sample was rocked at 4°C for another 30 min. Fifty to 100 μg of biotinylated (TTGGGG)8was added, and the sample was rocked for 1 h at 4°C (Photoprobe Biotin obtained from Vector Laboratories and DNA prepared according to manufacturer's instructions). The supernatant was then divided into three, and serially precipitated with approximately 200 μl of streptavidin-agarose for 20 min at 4°C. After each incubation, the beads were pelleted, the supernatant was removed, and another one-third supernatant was added. After all supernatant had been exposed to the agarose beads, the beads were extensively washed in TMG. A small amount of TMG remained over the washed pellet. The beads were assayed directly for telomerase activity and UV cross-linking. All oligonucleotides were obtained from Operon Technologies, Inc. and were gel-purified as described previously (Harrington and Greider, 1991Greider C.W. Cell. 1991; 67: 645-647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). For generation of probes for the mobility shift assay, 0.1 μg of gel-purified oligonucleotide was added to 1 × kinase buffer (Sambrook et al., 1989Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), 100 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (DuPont NEN), and 5 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (BRL) in a final volume of 20 μl, and incubated at 37°C for 15-30 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of 80 μl of 1 × TE (10 m M Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 m M EDTA) and stored at −20°C. The probe was diluted to a final concentration of 1 ng/μl and 1 μl was used for each reaction in the mobility shift assay. For the standard mobility shift, 10 μl of extract was incubated with 10 μl of a mixture containing 1 μl of 32P-d(TTGGGG)3(or 32P-d(GGGGTT)3in some experiments), 3.0 μl of mobility shift buffer (33 m M Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 3.3 m M MgCl2, 33%, v/v, glycerol), 1.5 μl of 100 ng/ml d(T)18, and 4.5 μl of sterile water. The sample was incubated on ice for 10-30 min, and was loaded directly onto a pre-run 6%, w/v, nondenaturing acrylamide gel (20:1 acrylamide:bis-acrylamide) in 1 × TBE (Sambrook et al., 1989Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), electrophoresed for 4 h at 240 V, dried, and exposed to XAR-5 film. For the competition assays, the standard mobility shift assay was performed as described above, except that 1 μl of the appropriate concentration of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide was added to the probe mixture. For the nuclease experiments, 10 μl of telomerase extract was incubated with 1-2 units of micrococcal nuclease and 1 m M CaCl2(final concentration) at 30°C for 10 min. The sample was returned to ice, and brought to 10 m M EGTA and 10 m M MgCl2, followed by addition of 10 μl of probe mixture as described above. Control samples were treated identically, except micrococcal nuclease was omitted. For treatment with ribonuclease ONE (Promega) or ribonuclease CL3 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), the appropriate units as indicated in Fig. 3 were added to 10 μl of partially purified telomerase extract, and incubated on ice for 10 min prior to the addition of 10 μl of probe mixture. polymerase chain reaction base pair(s) 5-[N-(p-azidobenzoyl)-allyl]-deoxyuridine monophosphate. polymerase chain reaction base pair(s) 5-[N-(p-azidobenzoyl)-allyl]-deoxyuridine monophosphate. Telomerase RNA was isolated from telomerase preparations with one phenol extraction, and ethanol precipitated with 5 μg of yeast tRNA (Sigma) as a carrier. In vitro transcribed telomerase RNA was used as a positive control for the PCR, and was prepared using T7 polymerase as described previously (Avilion et al., 1992Avilion A.A. Harrington L.A. Greider C.W. Dev. Genet. 1992; 13: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For isolation of RNA from excised gel slices as indicated in Fig. 4, the gel slices were crushed into 0.3 M sodium acetate, 0.2%, w/v, SDS and eluted overnight at 30°C, and the RNA was precipitated from the supernatant with 600 μl of absolute ethanol. The sequence of the primers used in the PCR reaction are: “oligo 10′,” 5′-AAAAATAAGACATCCATTGATAAATAGTGTATCAAATG-3′, and “oligo 9′,” 5′-ATACCCGCTTAATTCATTCAGA-3′. Telomerase RNA samples (ranging from 50 pg to 1 ng) were brought to 4.5 μl with diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated sterile water, and added to a 20 μl of mixture containing 1 × reaction buffer (50 m M Tris-Cl, pH 8.3, 6 m M MgCl2, 40 m M KCl), 100 pmol of primer (oligo 10), 1.0 m M each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and TTP, 1.0 m M dithiothreitol, 20 units of RNasin (Promega), and 2-5 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Life Sciences, Inc.). The sample was incubated at room temperature for 10 min, and subsequently at 52°C for 60 min, and 95°C for 5 min. To this sample was added a 80-μl mixture containing 1 × PCR buffer (20 m M Tris-Cl, pH 8.4, 50 m M KCl, 1.2 m M MgCl2), 200 μM each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and TTP, 1.0 μM of each primer (oligo 10, oligo 9), and 2.5 to 5 units of AmpliTaq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). The sample was overlaid with 100 μl of light white mineral oil (Sigma), and amplified in a Perkin-Elmer PCR machine for 30 cycles of 1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 46°C, and 1 min at 72°C. To visualize the products, 10-30 μl of each reaction were resolved on a 1%, w/v, agarose gel and the gel was stained in 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide. For the N3RdUTP elongation assay, all reactions were carried out in subdued light. Ten μl of telomerase extract was incubated with a 4-μl reaction mixture, consisting of 1 μl of 10 × telomerase buffer, 1 μl of [32P]dGTP (400 Ci/mmol; NEN), 1.0 μl of 1 m M N3RdUTP (synthesized according to Bartholomew et al., 1990Bartholomew B.

Biol. 1991; 11: 5181-5189Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar)), and 0.5 μg of gel-purified d(G4T2)3primer. Elongation reactions proceeded for 6-10 min at 30°C. Samples to be cross-linked were placed in a 96-well microtiter plate pre-blocked with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin or approximately 50 μl of Sigmacote (Sigma), covered in plastic wrap, and placed at room temperature directly underneath a hand-held UV monitor at 254 nm for 5-10 min. For unirradiated controls, the samples remained at room temperature in the dark during the course of cross-linking. The sample was removed, and approximately 5 units each of RNase ONE, DNase, and MNase were added to the sample, and incubated at 30°C for 10 min. The sample was boiled in protein gel loading buffer and resolved on a 7-16%, w/v, acrylamide linear gradient protein gel, with a 3%, w/v, acrylamide stack. The specificity of Tetrahymena telomerase primer elongation has been extensively characterized (Blackburn et al., 1989Blackburn E.H. Greider C.W. Henderson E. Lee M. Shampay J. Shippen-Lentz D.

However, since it is not possible to distinguish between primer binding and nucleotide addition in the previously used elongation reactions, we used a mobility shift assay to directly study the primer binding specificity of highly purified telomerase. Radiolabeled telomeric d(TTGGGG)3oligonucleotide was incubated with fractions containing telomerase and resolved on a nondenaturing gel. Using partially purified extracts, we identified a protein-DNA complex that was specific for telomeric DNA and that migrated with the 344-bp DNA marker (Fig. 1). This complex was efficiently competed by a 20-fold excess of unlabeled competitor telomeric oligonucleotide, d(TTGGGG)3, but was not competed by up to a 2500-fold excess of non-telomeric oligonucleotide, pBR (Fig. 1). Other telomeric or telomere-like oligonucleotides that are substrates for telomerase elongation, such as d(TTGGGG), d(GGGGTT)3, d(TTAGGG)3, d(TG)9, d(TGTGTGGG)2TG, and d(TTGGGG)2pBR (Blackburn et al., 1989Blackburn E.H.

Cell. 1987; 51: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar; Harrington and Greider, 1991Harrington L.A. Greider C.W. Nature. 1991; 353: 451-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), also competed for formation of this complex (data not shown). An oligonucleotide complementary to the telomerase RNA template region, oligo 3, also competed for 32P-d(TTGGGG)3-binding (Fig. 1). This oligonucleotide contains 21 nucleotides complementary to the RNA, including the nine nucleotides, TTGGGGTTG, covering the RNA template (Greider and Blackburn, 1989Greider C.W. Blackburn E.H. Nature. 1989; 337: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar). A second RNA complementary oligonucleotide, oligo 8, which hybridizes adjacent to but does not cover the CAACCCCAA RNA template (Greider and Blackburn, 1989Greider C.W. Blackburn E.H. Nature. 1989; 337: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar) did not efficiently compete for 32P-d(TTGGGG)3binding (data not shown). The telomere-specific mobility shift did not require Mg2+, TTP, or dGTP for complex formation (data not shown). This complex was not formed when telomerase extracts were incubated with the 32P-labeled non-telomeric oligonucleotide, pBR, or when telomerase extracts were treated with Proteinase K (data not shown). To determine whether the 32P-d(TTGGGG)3-binding activity corresponds to telomerase or to some other telomere-binding protein, we followed telomerase elongation activity and the mobility shift complex throughout telomerase purification (Fig. 2). Tetrahymena S100 extracts were purified over gel filtration, heparin-agarose, and DEAE-agarose (Fig. 2 A). The 32P-d(TTGGGG)3-binding activity further co-purified with telomerase over the series: DEAE-agarose, phenyl-Sepharose, heparin-agarose, spermine-agarose, a DEAE concentrating column, and finally sucrose gradient sedimentation (Fig. 2 B). Co-purification of the band shift with telomerase on the final gradient is shown in Fig. 2 C. In this experiment the band shift appeared as a doublet. This doublet, seen in several highly purified preparations, has identical specificity as the single shift and may be due to limited telomerase degradation in these fractions (data not shown). Since telomerase contains an essential RNA component, we tested whether the complex was sensitive to RNase treatment. Partially purified telomerase extracts were preincubated with different ribonucleases, and then assayed for complex formation. Treatment with either RNase ONE, which cleaves after any nucleotide, or RNase CL3, which cleaves primarily at C residues, eliminated the complexes migrating with the 344-bp DNA marker (Fig. 3). Incubation with each RNase resulted in the formation of other complexes at lower mobilities than the telomerase complex (Fig. 3). The reason for this effect is not known. Pre-treatment with active MNase also eliminated the 344-bp complex, whereas the complex was unaffected by incubation of telomerase extracts with MNase that had been inactivated with EGTA (data not shown). These results indicate that the telomeric primer binding complex contains an RNA component necessary for complex stability. We next assayed directly for telomerase RNA in the mobility shift complex. Telomerase fractions were incubated either with or without radiolabeled telomeric primer and electrophoresed on adjacent lanes on a nondenaturing gel (Fig. 4 A). The two lanes were subsequently excised, cut into 10 slices and RNA eluted from each gel slice. Reverse transcription and PCR using telomerase RNA specific primers showed that telomerase RNA was present in gel slice number 3 that contained the mobility shift complex in the presence of primer (Fig. 4 B). Telomerase RNA was not detected at this position in the gel when telomerase extracts were not incubated with the 32P-d(TTGGGG)3probe. Telomerase RNA was also detected near the wells of the mobility shift gel, possibly as a result of enzyme that did not enter the acrylamide gel (Fig. 4 B). Thus, the presence of telomerase RNA in the gel section containing the (TTGGGG) binding complex suggests that this complex represents telomerase. To identify the protein components present in the telomerase complex, we generated a photoreactive telomeric oligonucleotide probe containing the TTP analog, N3RdUTP (Bartholomew et al., 1990Bartholomew B. Kassavetis G.A. Braun B.R. Geiduschek E.P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2197-2205Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, Bartholomew et al., 1991Bartholomew B. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5181-5189Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We first attempted to directly bind telomerase to the 32P-labeled N3RdUTP-containing DNA, and then cross-link the complex. However, using the mobility shift assay it was apparent that telomerase would not bind a probe that contained N3RdUTP (data not shown). We therefore took advantage of the ability of telomerase to incorporate the photoreactive TTP analog, N3RdUTP, during the elongation of telomeric primers. In this assay, the generation of a radioactive, cross-linkable primer depends upon the action of t"

Incubation (37°C, up to 2 h) of 125I-ubiquitin-loaded cells resulted in the recovery of 125I-ubiquitin with the cytosolic proteins (9.22 ± 0.4 μg/ml RBC) and conjugated to membrane proteins (2.18 ± 0.05 μg/ml RBC). This conjugation was time-dependent, and the predominant membrane protein band that became labeled showed an apparent molecular mass of 240 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Western blotting experiments with three different anti-ubiquitin antibodies revealed that this protein is also ubiquitinated in vivo. Cell-free experiments have shown that fraction II (a DEAE-bound protein fraction eluted by 0.5 M KCl) prepared from both mature erythrocytes and reticulocytes is able to conjugate ubiquitin to this protein.Ubiquitin conjugation was ATP-dependent (Km0.09 m M), time-dependent, and fraction II-dependent (8 ± 0.5 pmol of 125I-ubiquitin/h/mg of fraction II). Isolation of the major RBC membrane protein that is ubiquitinated was obtained by using biotinylated ubiquitin. Membrane proteins, once ubiquitinated with this derivative, were extracted and purified by affinity chromatography on immobilized avidin. The major components retained by the column were two peptides of molecular masses 220 and 240 kDa. Both proteins are recognized by a monoclonal anti-spectrin antibody, but only the 240-kDa component is detected by streptavidin peroxidase conjugate. That indeed the ubiquitinated membrane protein of 240-kDa is α-spectrin was confirmed by immunoaffinity chromatography using 125I-ubiquitin and a monoclonal anti-spectrin antibody. Antigen-antibody complexes were purified by protein A chromatography and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Again two bands of 240 and 220 kDa were eluted (α- and β-spectrin), but only one band corresponding to the electrophoretic mobility of α-spectrin was detected by autoradiography. Thus, α-spectrin is a substrate for the ATP-dependent ubiquitination system, suggesting that the cytoskeleton is covalently modified by ubiquitination both in reticulocytes and mature RBC.

In multi-Ub chains successive Ub are linked by an isopeptide bond involving the side chain of Lys-48 and the carboxyl group of Gly-76. The Ub conjugates may be: 1) degraded by an ATP-dependent protease releasing amino acids and intact ubiquitin, or 2) the Ub moiety may be removed by Ub-protein isopeptidases releasing free intact protein and intact ubiquitin. Moreover, isopeptidases may release free Ub from proteolytic breakdown products (5Sullivan M.L. Callis J. Viestra R.D. Plant Physiol.

Virology. 1988; 165: 310-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, the best known function of Ub is the (14Magnani M. Crinelli R. Corsi D. Serafini G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 673: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) marking of proteins destined (15Chau V. Tobias J.W. Bachmair A. Marriot D. Ecker D.J. Gonda D.K. Varshavsky A. Science. 1989; 243: 1576-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar) for selective elimination, but protein ubiquitination must have other regulatory roles too. It is becoming increasingly evident (see above) that the ligation of Ub to proteins is implicated in the control of a great variety of biological processes (16Kong S.-K. Chock P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14189-14192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In particular monoubiquitination may serve such a role (17Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 761-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar, 18Haas A. Reback P.M. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21664-21669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact the ligation of a single or few Ub molecules to proteins appears to be implicated in the direct altering of the structure and function of conjugates, affecting their interaction with other cellular components (19Fried V.A. Smith H.T. Hildebrandt E. Weiner K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3685-3689Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and accounting for a nonproteolytic role for Ub and for the existence of metabolically stable Ub-protein conjugates (20Finley D. Chau V. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 25-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 21Mayer R.J. Arnold J. Lszl L. Landon M. Lowe J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1089: 141-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) without a certain known role(s). Most of our knowledge about the Ub pathway comes from the characterization of this pathway in rabbit reticulocytes or from in vitro studies using cell-free rabbit reticulocyte extracts (22Haas A.L. Magnani M. De Flora A. Red Blood Cell Aging. Plenum Press, New York1991: 191-205Google Scholar). Reticulocytes contain both a stable and labile pool of Ub conjugates, whereas erythrocytes contain a pool of conjugates that is relatively stable (23Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12464-12473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Maturation of reticulocytes to erythrocytes, and subsequent erythrocyte aging involves significant cellular remodeling (22Haas A.L. Magnani M. De Flora A. Red Blood Cell Aging. Plenum Press, New York1991: 191-205Google Scholar). During this maturation the activities of a large number of pathways are lost by selective turnover of key enzymes. Mature erythrocytes have virtually no Ub- and ATP-dependent protein degradation, but substantial levels of Ub-protein conjugates remain (24Pickart C.M. Vella A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12028-12035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Comparisons of conjugate pools within these two types of cells showed that 83% in reticulocytes and 31% in erythrocytes of total intracellular Ub exist covalently bound to target proteins. The absence of energy-dependent proteolysis in mature erythrocytes is not a consequence of loss in active Ub or a consequence of limited substrate availability (23Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12464-12473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), rather it mainly results from the decay in the level of some components required for conjugation and subsequent breakdown such as active E2s (20Finley D. Chau V. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 25-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 24Pickart C.M. Vella A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12028-12035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The highly active reticulocyte Ub system is excellent for studying the Ub pathways and for identifying Ub conjugates in vitro (25Hershko A. Ganoth D. Pehrson J. Palazzo R.E. Cohen L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16376-16379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, mature erythrocytes represent an ideal system for investigating protein ubiquitination when this process is not followed by protein degradation. This fact, and the availability of a procedure for the encapsulation of labeled ubiquitin without affecting the main cellular functions, allowed us to investigate ubiquitin conjugation in intact mature erythrocytes providing clear evidence for the conjugation of Ub to a previously unidentified substrate, namely the cytoskeletal protein α-spectrin. The functional role of this process is not yet clear; however, spectrin represents the major ubiquitinatable substrate in mature red cells. ubiquitin phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride red blood cell polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Ubiquitin, chloramine T, monoclonal antibody to human spectrin (clone SB-SP1), and anti-ubiquitin were obtained from Sigma. Reticulocytes and erythrocyte fractions were prepared as previously reported (2Hershko A. Heller H. Elias S. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8206-8214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lysate was fractionated on a DEAE-52 column. The unadsorbed material was designated fraction I and contained ubiquitin, whereas proteins adsorbed into the resin and eluted by 0.5 M KCl at pH 7.9 were fraction II (2Hershko A. Heller H. Elias S. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8206-8214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 1 m M PMSF, 1 μM leupeptin, 1 μM pepstatin, 0.5 m M diisopropyl fluorophosphate, and 20% (v/v) glycerol were present in the chromatographic buffer used in the preparation of fraction II. N-Hydroxysuccinimide biotin, Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent, and immobilized avidin (1-ml prepacked columns) were from Pierce. Immobilized protein A was from Repligen. The ECL Western blotting detection reagents and iodine-125 (100 mCi/ml) were from Amersham International (Milan, Italy). Ubiquitin was radiolabeled with carrier-free Na125I (Amersham Corp.) by the chloramine-T method as described in Ref. 26Feber S. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3128-3134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. The specific activity obtained was 1.7˙106cpm/g. Ubiquitin (1 mg/ml) was biotinylated by N-hydroxysuccinimide biotin (Pierce) following the manufacturer's protocol. Human erythrocytes were washed twice in 10 m M Hepes containing 140 m M NaCl, 5 m M glucose, pH 7.4 (buffer A) to remove leukocytes and platelets and were resuspended at 70% hematocrit. These cells were dialyzed for 45 min using a tube with a cutoff of 12-14 kDa against 50 volumes of 10 m M NaH2PO4containing 20 m M glucose, 4 m M MgCl2, 3 m M reduced glutathione, 2 m M ATP, pH 7.4. The osmolarity of this buffer was 58 mOsm. After this time the dialyzed erythrocytes were transferred to a tube with a cutoff of 3 kDa and 30 μg/ml of 125I-ubiquitin were added. Dialysis was continued for a further 15 min. All these procedures were performed at 4°C. Resealing of the erythrocytes was obtained by adding 0.1 volume of 5 m M adenine, 100 m M inosine, 2 m M ATP, 100 m M glucose, 100 m M sodium pyruvate, 4 m M MgCl2, 0.194 M NaCl, 1.6 M KCl, 35 m M NaH2PO4, pH 7.4, per volume of dialyzed erythrocytes and by incubation at 37°C for 20 min. Resealed cells were then washed three times in buffer A and used for the experiments reported under “Results.” The resealed RBC had normal glycolytic rates (2.8 ± 0.2 μmol of lactate/h/ml of RBC) and normal ATP concentrations (1.4 ± 0.1 m M). Determinations were performed as described previously (27Rossi L. Bianchi M. Magnani M. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1992; 15: 207-216PubMed Google Scholar). Erythrocyte membranes were prepared by hemolysis in 5 m M Na2HPO4, 1 m M PMSF, pH 8.0, and washed until white. The cytoskeleton was prepared as described in Ref. 28Sobue K. Muramoto Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 100: 1063-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar with slight modifications. Triton X-100 was 0.5% (v/v), and urea extraction was omitted. Spectrin dimers were prepared by extraction of human erythrocyte membranes in low ionic strength buffer, at 37°C, pH 9.5, as described in Ref. 29Sato S.E. Ohnishi S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 130: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, and gel filtration (30Morrow J.S. Speicher D.W. Knowles W.J. Hsu C.J. Marchesi V.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 6592-6596Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Spectrin concentration was obtained by using Centriprep concentrators from Amicon with a cutoff of 30-kDa. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was carried out using a mini-gel apparatus (Bio-Rad), unless otherwise indicated, according to Laemmli (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). Samples were boiled at 100°C for 5 min in sample buffer containing 4% mercaptoethanol. Staining was with Coomassie Blue R-250 or with silver (Bio-Rad). The gels were then fixed, dried, and autoradiographed with Kodak X-Omat AR film at −70°C in the presence of Du Pont Lighting Plus intensifying screens. Exposure times were adjusted so that signal was within the linear response range of the film. Quantitative determinations were performed by direct counting the bands excised from the dried gels in a Beckman 5500 γ-counter. Molecular mass standards used were 200 kDa, 116 kDa, 97 kDa, 66 kDa, 45 kDa, from Bio-Rad. The amount of ubiquitin bound was calculated from the specific radioactivity of 125I-Ub as described in Ref. 32Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13258-13267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. Alternatively, the exposed films were scanned with an LKB Ultroscan XL enhanced laser densitometer and the densitometric values compared with those obtained by known amounts of 125I-Ub. In some experiments the gels were electroblotted according to Towbin et al. (33Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Blots involving biotinylated ubiquitin were developed using streptavidin horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:3,000 dilution, Amersham Life Science) and ECL. Blots involving native Ub were first incubated with affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-Ub antibodies 1:1,000 dilution (provided by A. Haas, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI) or with anti-Ub antibodies (provided by J. Callis, University of California, Davis, CA) and then with goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad) 1:3,000 dilution or with protein A-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:1,000 dilution) was used as a secondary antibody. Blots involving native spectrin were first incubated with monoclonal antibody anti-spectrin (Sigma) and then with goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad) 1:3,000 dilution. Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) was used as detection system. The conjugation of ubiquitin to red cell membranes was assayed by incubation of rabbit or human red cell membranes with 125I-Ub in the presence of fraction II. The reaction mixture contained (unless otherwise indicated), in a final volume of 150 μl, 75 m M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 m M MgCl2, 3 m M dithiothreitol, 3 m M ATP, 10 m M creatine phosphate, 10 μg of creatine phosphokinase, 60 μg of fraction II, 0.8˙106cpm of 125I-Ub, 0.5 m M diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 1 m M PMSF, 1 M leupeptin, 1 M pepstatin, and 50 μg of membranes. At time 0, 60, and 120 min of incubation at 37°C aliquots of the reaction mixture (45 μl) were removed and the membranes pelleted by centrifugation in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. The supernatants were discharged (unreacted 125I-Ub and other components of the reaction mixture), whereas the pellets were resuspended in 150 μl of PBS, pH 7.4, containing 1 m M PMSF and centrifuged again. The final membrane pellet was boiled for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) containing 2% (v/v) mercaptoethanol. Control samples without ATP and the ATP regenerating system were incubated as above. All samples were then electrophoresed in SDS-polyacrylamide gels, fixed, dried, and autoradiographed. Human erythrocyte membranes were incubated in the presence of biotinylated ubiquitin and the other components of the reaction mixture as described under “Assay of Ubiquitin Conjugation.” Crude spectrin was extracted (see above) and concentrated to a final volume of 2 ml. This protein solution was loaded onto a column of immobilized avidin (Pierce), equilibrated, washed, and eluted according to the manufacturer's suggestions. Eluted proteins were then precipitated by adding 1 volume of cold 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid in methanol. After 20 min at 0°C the solution was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min and the protein pellet resuspended in sample buffer, pH 9, and used in the electrophoretic and Western blotting procedures. As an alternative procedure for the identification of ubiquitinated membrane proteins the erythrocyte membranes were incubated with 125I-Ub and then spectrin was extracted as above. A monoclonal antibody against spectrin (clone SB-SP1, Sigma) was added to the spectrin solution (66 μg of IgG/ml of spectrin solution) and incubated for 3 h at room temperature. Antigen-antibody complexes were isolated by adding 0.25 ml of immobilized protein A and agitated overnight at 4°C. The resin suspension was packed into a small column, the column was washed with 20 volumes of 10 m M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.3 N NaCl and then eluted using 150 μl of hot (80°C) sample buffer. Eluted samples were then used for electrophoresis and autoradiography. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217547) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Alternatively, protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm. Scanning of autoradiograph was by an LKB laser scan densitometer. Human red blood cells were submitted to a procedure of hypotonic dialysis, isotonic resealing, and reannealing to encapsulate 125I-Ub. The first dialysis step (see “Experimental Procedures” for details) was performed using a dialysis tube with a 12-kDa cutoff that allowed the removal of unbound ubiquitin (70% of total Ub, Ref. 32Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13258-13267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the second dialysis was done in a dialysis tube with a cutoff of 3 kDa in the presence of 125I-Ub (30 μg/ml RBC; 1.7 106cpm/g) to encapsulate the labeled protein. At the end of the procedure 11.4 ± 0.6 μg of 125I-Ub were encapsulated into each ml of packed RBC (38% of the 125I-Ub used). Preparation of the “soluble fraction” and of the membranes from this sample showed that 89% of encapsulated 125I-Ub was in the cytosol while 6% was membrane bound (Table I). One unexpected finding was the evidence of bound ubiquitin to the RBC membranes. The experiments reported above were repeated preparing the cytosol and the membranes after 0, 30, 60, and 120 min of incubation at 37°C of the intact RBC loaded with 125I-Ub. As shown in Fig. 1 there was a time-dependent incorporation of 125I-Ub into a membrane protein of 240 kDa with an electrophoretic mobility similar to α-spectrin. This protein appears to be the major ubiquitinatable substrate in mature RBC. Quantitative evaluation of 125I-Ub bound to membrane protein after 2-h incubation was performed by γ counting of the membrane fraction and showed 80 ± 3 pg of Ub/g of membrane protein. Since the conjugation of ubiquitin is usually an ATP-dependent process, we have also measured the ATP concentration of resealed RBC at the same time points. After 2-h incubation the cells still contained 70% of the ATP present at time 0 (1.4 m M).Table I:Intracellular distribution of 125I-Ub encapsulated into human RBCHuman RBC were submitted to a procedure of hypotonic dialysis, isotonic resealing and reannealling as reported under “Experimental Procedures” using 30 μg of 125I-Ub/ml of RBC (1.7˙106cpm/μg). The cells were then incubated at 37°C for 1 h and the amount of radioactivity determined in the cytosol and membrane fractions. All values are the mean ± S.D. of five experiments.FIG. 1Conjugation of ubiquitin to human erythrocyte proteins. 125I-Ub was encapsulated into human erythrocytes as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 125I-Ub-loaded cells were then incubated at 37°C in 10 mM. Hepes containing 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM glucose, 3 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at a hematocrit of 30%. At time 0, 30, 60, and 120 min, samples were collected and the erythrocytes washed in a physiological saline solution and hemolyzed by addition of 5 volumes of 5 mM NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, containing 1 mM PMSF (lysis buffer). After 30 min on ice the lysate wa centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatant contained the cytosolic fraction with most of 125I-Ub (see Table I), whereas the pellet, containing the membranes, was further washed with ly is buffer until colorless. The membrane and cytosol fractions were then submitted to SDS-PAGE in 10% polyacrylamide gel (16 × 16 cm), stained with Coomassie Blue (labeled “SDS-PAGE“ in the figure) and autoradiographed. Each lane received 50 μg of protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Human RBC were submitted to a procedure of hypotonic dialysis, isotonic resealing and reannealling as reported under “Experimental Procedures” using 30 μg of 125I-Ub/ml of RBC (1.7˙106cpm/μg). The cells were then incubated at 37°C for 1 h and the amount of radioactivity determined in the cytosol and membrane fractions. All values are the mean ± S.D. of five experiments. In an attempt to investigate whether the conjugation of 125I-Ub to membrane protein is a natural event or is caused by the procedure of encapsulation used, we tested (by Western blotting) the presence of ubiquitin conjugates on human and rabbit erythrocyte membranes. Three polyclonal anti-ubiquitin antibodies were used. One antibody was from a commercial source (Sigma) and two others were kindly obtained from A. Haas (Medical College of Wisconsin) and J. Callis (University of California at Davis). All three antibodies recognize different protein bands. However, after the absorption of these antibodies with free ubiquitin, only a membrane protein of molecular mass 240 kDa appears to be specifically detected. The results obtained with one of these antibodies (A. Haas' antibody) are shown in Fig. 2. Qualitatively similar results were obtained with the other antibodies. Thus, it must be concluded that the staining with anti-ubiquitin antibodies is specific and that ubiquitin in vivo is normally conjugated to the same membrane protein of 240 kDa detected by loading intact erythrocytes with 125I-Ub. The conjugation of ubiquitin to the 240-kDa membrane protein was characterized in a cell-free system consisting of erythrocyte membranes and fraction II as a source of conjugating enzymes. First of all, since several proteins present in fraction II can be substrates for ubiquitin conjugation, we developed a new Ub conjugation assay. In our assay the incubation mixture was centrifuged at each time point, the pelleted membranes were washed, resuspended in sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (or by Western blotting and ECL using a streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate to detect biotinylated ubiquitin when this was used instead of 125I-Ub). This system allows the unequivocal detection of a major component in the membrane pellet that is ubiquitinated in an ATP-dependent and time-dependent process (Fig. 3). Determination of initial rates provided values of 8 ± 0.5 pmol of Ub conjugated per h/mg of fraction II and show an optimum pH value of 7.6 (Fig. 3 B). 125I-Ub conjugation depends on the concentration of the acceptor substrate (membrane protein), shows saturable hyperbolic kinetics with a K0.5 of 0.22 ± 0.02 mg of membrane protein/ml of reaction mixture, and also depends on the concentration of ubiquitin with a K0.5 of 0.15 ± 0.03 μM (not shown). Fraction II prepared from both rabbit reticulocytes or human erythrocytes are able to conjugate 125I-Ub to the 240-kDa membrane protein at a similar rate (7 ± 0.5 pmol of Ub conjugated per h/mg of fraction II from reticulocytes and 8 ± 0.5 pmol of Ub conjugated per h/mg Fraction II from erythrocytes). Biotinylated ubiquitin was also tested as a substrate for protein ubiquitination essentially for two reasons, i.e. first to validate 125I-Ub as a tracer for ubiquitin conjugation and second for the experiments that will be reported below. In these experiments detection was by streptavidin peroxidase and ECL after Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 4 biotinylated ubiquitin is conjugated to the same 240-kDa membrane protein both in human and rabbit membranes in an ATP-dependent process. Particularly when using rabbit erythrocytes few membrane bands of lower molecular mass are recognized by the second reagent (streptavidin peroxidase) but could be easily distinguished from the specific ubiquitin conjugates (data not shown), since these also appear in the absence of biotinylated ubiquitin and independently of ATP and incubation time. The formation and decay of ubiquitin conjugates with protein membranes were examined by using both 125I-ubiquitin and biotinylated ubiquitin. Human erythrocyte membranes were first incubated with 125I-Ub in the presence of fraction II and ATP. Samples were taken at different incubation times and processed for SDS-PAGE as above. After 1 h at 37°C the membranes from this first incubation were collected by centrifugation, washed in PBS, and submitted to a second incubation in the presence of biotinylated ubiquitin, new fraction II, and ATP. Further samples were taken at different intervals and processed in duplicate for SDS-PAGE. Half of the gel was dried and autoradiographed, and the second half was transferred by Western blotting on a nitrocellulose membrane that was processed for the detection of ubiquitinated proteins by streptavidin peroxidase and ECL. As shown in Fig. 5, 125I-Ub is incorporated into the 240-kDa membrane protein in a time-dependent process. This 125I-Ub-protein complex dissociates upon incubation in the presence of biotinylated ubiquitin that becomes incorporated by replacing the iodinate derivative. Direct counting in a γ-counter of the gel slices corresponding to the 240-kDa membrane protein provided values for ubiquitin incorporation of 8 pmol/h/mg of fraction II and decay values of 6.3 pmol/h/mg of fraction II. Similar results were obtained with fraction II from reticulocytes or erythrocytes. Thus, the conjugation of ubiquitin to the erythrocyte membrane 240-kDa protein is a dynamic process. The apparent molecular masses of α- and β-spectrin are 240 and 220 kDa, respectively (although cDNA-deduced amino acid sequences provide values of 280 and 260 kDa). α-Spectrin is present on the erythrocyte membrane cytoskeleton in 200,000 copies/cell and represents one of the most abundant membrane proteins (12.5% of total protein). Based on these considerations and on the data reported above, it seems reasonable to suggest that α-spectrin may be the protein substrate for ubiquitination on the erythrocyte membrane. However, to obtain direct evidence for this, we used two approaches. In one case we ubiquitinated the erythrocyte membranes with biotinylated ubiquitin. The membranes were then washed and solubilized in a low ionic strength buffer at 37°C. The solubilized proteins were chromatographed onto an avidin column that retains biotinylated proteins. The column was eluted with 8 M guanidiniun chloride, and the eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using streptavidin-peroxidase or a monoclonal antibody against spectrin (both α- and β-spectrin are recognized by this antibody, although the affinity for β-spectrin is higher). As shown in Fig. 6, two proteins with electrophoretic mobilities corresponding to α- and β-spectrin and a minor band corresponding to 4.1 are retained by the avidin column. The first two major protein bands have been identified as spectrin by a monoclonal anti-spectrin antibody. Only α-spectrin is also detected by streptavidin-peroxidase. In another experiment, ubiquitination was obtained using 125I-ubiquitin. Membranes were then washed and crude spectrin was extracted as above. The solubilized proteins were concentrated by ultrafiltration and incubated for 3 h with a monoclonal anti-spectrin antibody at room temperature. Antigen-antibody complexes were purified by chromatography on immobilized protein A. After extensive washing the column was eluted with hot (80°C) Laemmli sample buffer (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 7, four proteins (240, 220, 80, and 43 kDa) are immunoprecipitated by the anti-spectrin antibody but only α-spectrin is ubiquitinated.FIG. 7Isolation of 125I-ubiquitinated spectrin. Human erythrocyte membranes (0.4 mg) were incubated with 125I-Ub (20 μg) in the presence of ATP (3.5 m M) and fraction II (300 μg) in a final volume of 1,350 μl, for 1 h at 37°C. The membranes were then pelleted, washed, and crude spectrin extracted by a low ionic strength buffer. The sample was concentrated to 0.8 ml by Centricon (Amicon) ultrafiltration, and 78 μg of anti-spectrin monoclonal antibody (Sigma) was added in a final volume of 1.2 ml containing 10 m M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. After 3 h at room temperature with gentle agitation, 250 μl of immobilized protein A (Pierce) (equilibrated in 10 m M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.3% bovine serum albumin) were added overnight at 4°C. The suspension was loaded onto a small plastic column, washed with 10 m M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.3 M NaCl, and eluted by Laemmli sample buffer (150 μl at 80°C). The eluate was then separated by SDS-PAGE. Detection was with Coomassie stain and autoradiography.

Cell. 1991; 66: 615-618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In recent years, however, there has been increasing evidence that the ligation of Ub to proteins is implicated in a great variety of biological processes, including cell cycle control (8Glotzer M. Murray A.W. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1991; 349: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1903) Google Scholar), the modulation of receptor function (36Paolini R. Kinet J.P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and heat-shock response (11Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15237-15240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In reticulocytes, most of ubiquitin is conjugated to endogenous proteins. An active ubiquitin and ATP-dependent proteolytic system in this cell is responsible for the transition from the reticulocyte stage to the mature erythrocyte stage (22Haas A.L. Magnani M. De Flora A. Red Blood Cell Aging. Plenum Press, New York1991: 191-205Google Scholar). Mature erythrocytes no longer have an active ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic system, essentially because of the maturation-dependent decay of some of the E2s responsible for Ub conjugation (23Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12464-12473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in mature erythrocytes the total ubiquitin content is similar to that found in reticulocytes (22Haas A.L. Magnani M. De Flora A. Red Blood Cell Aging. Plenum Press, New York1991: 191-205Google Scholar), and 30% of this is still conjugated to endogenous proteins. Mature erythrocytes thus represent an exceptional cell model to investigate protein ubiquitination independently of their commitment to degradation. Based on these considerations, we started a study aimed at identifying the natural substrates of ubiquitination in mature erythrocytes. The experimental approaches selected aimed at investigating ubiquitination under conditions as close as possible to those found in intact cells. Toward this end we used an encapsulation procedure based on hypotonic hemolysis and isotonic resealing (37Magnani M. De Loach J.R. The Use of Resealed Erythrocytes as Carriers and Bioreactors. Plenum Press, New York1992Crossref Google Scholar) for the entrapment of 125I-Ub in mature human erythrocytes. This procedure allows the internalization of molecules into erythrocytes without modifying their normal biochemical, immunological, and morphological properties (35Rechsteiner M. Cell. 1991; 66: 615-618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). By this approach we found that most of 125I-Ub that become conjugated in mature erythrocytes is bound to a 240-kDa membrane protein. In a cell-free system this conjugation was shown to be ATP-dependent, to show an optimum at physiological pH values, and is catalyzed by enzymes present into fraction II prepared both from reticulocytes and mature erythrocytes. Furthermore, ubiquitination of the 240-kDa membrane protein is a dynamic process with relatively fast rates of formation (8 pmol of Ub/h/mg of fraction II) and decay (6.3 pmol/h/mg of fraction II) of bound ubiquitin. By different methods the 240-kDa protein has been identified as α-spectrin. Why only this membrane protein is ubiquitinated in mature erythrocytes is presently unknown. From the stoichiometry of ubiquitin conjugation we calculated that only a small fraction (1.71 ± 0.02%) of total α-spectrin is ubiquitinated into mature erythrocytes. This limited ubiquitination does not depend on the presence of α-spectrin in the membrane, cytoskeleton, or as a complex with β-spectrin/band 4.1/actin. In fact, similar fractions of ubiquitinated α-spectrin were found in all cases except on crude spectrin extracts (not shown). Furthermore, based on the electrophoretic mobility of ubiquitinated α-spectrin, only few (one or two) molecules of ubiquitin are likely be incorporated per molecule of α-spectrin. In reticulocytes α-spectrin is usually synthesized 2-3-fold in excess of β-spectrin (38Hanspal M. Palek J. Semin. Hematol. 1992; 29: 305-319PubMed Google Scholar). The molecules not involved in the formation of αβ-spectrin dimers are rapidly degraded. No data are currently available on the mechanism(s) responsible for this degradation. However, in mature erythrocytes protein synthesis is not longer active, and free α-spectrin is not present. Furthermore, we have clearly shown that ubiquitination occurs on α-spectrin when already assembled in dimers and tetramers in the cytoskeleton. This ubiquitination occurs at similar rates in erythrocyte and reticulocyte lysates (see “Results”), whereas the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes responsible for the ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis are active only in reticulocytes (23Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12464-12473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, α-spectrin ubiquitination is catalyzed by one of the E2s that are usually utilized for functions others then the marking of proteins for degradation. The principal function of the spectrin skeleton in erythrocytes is to provide structural support to the lipid bilayer (39Cohen C.M. Semin. Hematol. 1983; 20: 141-158PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, all mechanisms that modulate protein interactions in the erythrocyte membrane skeleton could influence cell deformability and stability. Among the factors so far reported to regulate membrane skeletal organization are Ca2+ and β-spectrin phosphorylation (40Vann Bennett Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 1029-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). It could be speculated that ubiquitination of α-spectrin may play a similar role in the control of cell deformability. However, no experimental data are yet available. In conclusion, a new physiological substrate for protein ubiquitination has been found. Others (12Murti K.G. Smith H.T. Fried V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3019-3023Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 41Ball E. Karlik C.C. Beall C.J. Saville D.L. Sparrow J.C. Bullard B. Fyrberg E.A. Cell. 1987; 51: 221-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) have previously reported the ubiquitination of cytoskeletal proteins. In the erythrocyte, α-spectrin ubiquitination does not yet have a role; however, occurring in mature cells, it may serve for functions other than ATP-dependent proteolysis. The results reported in this paper along with those of other investigators (12Murti K.G. Smith H.T. Fried V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3019-3023Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) should prove valuable in defining a further role(s) of ubiquitination in cell deformability. We gratefully thank A. Haas (Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI) for helpful discussion and suggestions, J. Callis (University of California, Davis, CA) for the generous supply of anti-ubiquitin antibodies. We are very thankful to P. S. Low (Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN) for teaching one of us (D. Corsi) several methods used in studies involving the erythrocyte membrane."

The required energy for the reaction, stored as a proton motive force (Mitchell, 1961Mitchell P. Nature. 1961; 191: 144-148Google Scholar), is supplied by oxidations in the respiratory chain. Although the coupling reaction, that is, the manner in which proton flux is utilized to drive ATP formation, is only poorly understood, progress has been made in elucidating the mechanism of action of the mitochondrial ATPase in catalyzing ATP synthesis (for reviews see Penefsky and Cross, 1991Penefsky H.S. Cross R.L. Adv. Enzymol. Rel. Areas Mol. Biol. 1991; 64: 173-214Google Scholar; Hatefi, 1993Hatefi Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 759-767Google Scholar). The elementary steps in the hydrolysis of ATP by both the soluble (Grubmeyer et al., 1982Grubmeyer C. Cross R.L. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12092-12100Google Scholar; Cross et al., 1982Cross R.L. Grubmeyer C. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12101-12105Google Scholar) and membrane-bound forms of beef heart mitochondrial F1(Penefsky, 1985aPenefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13728-13734Google Scholar, Penefsky, 1985bPenefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13735-13741Google Scholar) supported a model for ATP synthesis in oxidative phosphorylation in which ATP could be formed from bound ADP and Piwith little or no change in free energy (K2for the catalytic step was near unity). The free energy of binding of product ATP in high affinity catalytic sites of F1was viewed as the driving force for ATP formation (K1for the binding step was 1012M−1). Thus, the major requirement for energy in oxidative phosphorylation was for the dissociation of product ATP from high affinity catalytic sites (Penefsky and Cross, 1991Penefsky H.S. Cross R.L. Adv. Enzymol. Rel. Areas Mol. Biol. 1991; 64: 173-214Google Scholar). Insight into the nature of the coupling device was provided by further observations suggesting long range interactions, apparently involving the transmission of conformational changes, between proton-binding sites in F0and the catalytic sites of F1(Penefsky, 1985cPenefsky H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1589-1593Google Scholar; Matsuno-Yagi et al., 1985Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. Hatefi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7550-7554Google Scholar).

Acta. 1993; 1140: 215-250Google Scholar in the binding change mechanism of oxidative phosphorylation. membrane-imbedded portion, and F1, extrinsic, easily solubilized portion of the F0F1-ATPase carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethyoxyphenylhydrazone trinitrophenyl oligomycin sensitivity-conferring protein. The dissociation constant of 10−12M for dissociation of ATP from high affinity catalytic sites of soluble (Grubmeyer et al., 1982Grubmeyer C. Cross R.L. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12092-12100Google Scholar) or non-energized membrane-bound F1(Penefsky, 1985aPenefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13728-13734Google Scholar) suggested that during oxidative phosphorylation the catalytic sites would have to undergo a decrease in affinity for ATP of many orders of magnitude. Experimental precedent for cyclic changes in the affinity of catalytic sites was established in studies of the hydrolysis of trinitrophenyl-ATP (TNP-ATP) by soluble F1. TNP-ATP and TNP-ADP both were bound at site 1 of the enzyme with an affinity too high to be measured. Nevertheless, the enzyme catalyzed the hydrolysis of TNP-ATP (Grubmeyer and Penefsky, 1981aGrubmeyer C. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3718-3727Google Scholar, Grubmeyer and Penefsky, 1981bGrubmeyer C. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3728-3734Google Scholar). However, a dissociation constant of 10−12M is equivalent to a standard free energy change of about 16 kcal/mol, whereas the standard free energy change accompanying ATP hydrolysis was reported to be about −8.5 kcal/mol (Rosing and Slater, 1972Rosing J. Slater E.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 267: 275-290Google Scholar) and the phosphorylation potential generated by respiring submitochondrial particles (Δ Gp) was reported to be 10.6 kcal/mol (Ferguson and Sorgato, 1977Ferguson S.J. Sorgato M.C. Biochem. J. 1977; 168: 299-303Google Scholar). This apparent discrepancy is resolved by observations presented in this paper that the dissociation constant for ATP (KdATP) from submitochondrial particles under conditions of oxidative phosphorylation used in these experiments was about 60 μM. Thus, the observed free energy change relevant to the dissociation of ATP during the transition from non-energized to energized states was 9.7 kcal/mol. The changes in affinity for ATP were expressed largely as an increase in the rate of ATP dissociation under energized conditions. It was found that the rate of dissociation of ATP was accelerated five orders of magnitude in the presence of NADH and about six orders of magnitude in the presence of NADH and 0.1 m M ADP. The observed energized dissociation constant of 3 μM (in the presence of NADH alone) is in the same range as values reported for the chloroplast thylakoid of 7 μM (Magnusson and McCarty, 1976Magnusson R.P. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7417-7422Google Scholar) and for Paracoccus denitrificans of 16 μM (Perez and Ferguson, 1990aPerez J.A. Ferguson S.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10503-10518Google Scholar, b). Materials 32Pi(enzyme grade) was purchased from ICN and used without further purification. [γ-32P]ATP was prepared as described (Glynn and Chappell, 1964Glynn I.M. Chappell J.B. Biochem. J. 1964; 90: 147-149Google Scholar). The specific radioactivity of most preparations was 5 × 107counts/min/nmol. Hexokinase, ATP, ADP, and bovine serum albumin were purchased from Sigma. NADH (“100% pure”) was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Methods Submitochondrial particles, ETPH(Mg2+), were prepared from beef heart mitochondria (Beyer, 1967Beyer R.E. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 186-194Google Scholar) and activated by washing with buffered solutions of KCl (Penefsky, 1985aPenefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13728-13734Google Scholar). The specific ATPase activity of preparations of submitochondrial particles was about 0.8-1.0 units/mg of protein and that of KCl-washed particles 10 units/mg of protein. The amounts of 32Piand [γ-32P]ATP in reaction mixtures were determined by scintillation counting of organic and aqueous phases after extraction of perchloric acid-quenched samples with isobutanol/benzene (Lindberg and Ernster, 1956Lindberg O. Ernster L. Glick D. Methods of Biochemical Analysis. Vol. 3. John Wiley & Sons, New York1956: 1-23Google Scholar). Aliquots of each of the phases were added to a scintillation mixture described earlier (Penefsky, 1977Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2891-2899Google Scholar) and counted in a Beckman LS-6500 liquid scintillation counter. F1(Penefsky, 1977Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2891-2899Google Scholar) and OSCP (Senior, 1979Senior A.E. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 391-397Google Scholar) were prepared as described. The preparation of OSCP was carried out through the step of extraction with ammonia. The resulting supernatant solution was treated with 42% solid ammonium sulfate, and the precipitate was collected and dissolved with 20 ml of a solution containing 50 m M Tris-SO4, pH 8, 0.1 m M dithiothreitol, and 0.1 m M EDTA. The solution was stored at −70°C. After thawing, the solution was centrifuged at 165,000 × g to remove the precipitate that formed. The supernatant was stored at −70°C and dialyzed before use versus a solution containing 50 m M Tris-SO4, pH 8, 0.1 m M dithiothreitol, and 0.1 m M EDTA. F1(3.7 mg), OSCP (2.8 mg), and albumin (35 mg) were incubated with 44 mg of KCl-washed ETPH(Mg2+) in a buffer containing 0.25 M sucrose, 50 m M Tris acetate, pH 7.4, 12 m M Pi, pH 7.4, 5 m M ATP, 1 m M dithiothreitol, 0.5 m M EDTA, and 20 m M succinate for 5 min at room temperature with rapid stirring. The final volume was 17.5 ml. Succinate was essential for maximal and stable reconstitution. The reconstituted particles were separated from the soluble ATPase by centrifugation for 20 min at 40,000 revolutions/min in a Beckman Ti 50.2 rotor (4°C). The pellets were washed once by resuspension in 15 ml of a buffer containing 0.25 M sucrose, 5 m M MgSO4, 40 mg of albumin, and 1 m M dithiotheitol, followed by centrifugation under the same conditions, and resuspended at 15 mg/ml in the same buffer. Energy-dependent Dissociation of [γ-32P]ATP Bound in High Affinity Catalytic Sites of Submitochondrial Particles-The reaction mixture contained 20 m M Tris-SO4, pH 8, 5 m M Pi, 5 m M MgSO4, 0.25 M sucrose, 50 m M glucose, 0.1 μM [γ-32P]ATP, 200 units of hexokinase, 1 m M NADH, and 1-2 mg of the particles. The final volume was 1.0 ml. The particles were incubated for 1 min at room temperature with all additions except NADH, hexokinase, and radioactive ATP. After incubation for 5-10 s with [γ-32P]ATP (in order to form the enzyme-substrate complex), hexokinase was added and an additional 5 s of incubation was allowed to convert any free [γ-32P]ATP to glucose-6-32P. In a separate experiment, 5 s of incubation in the presence of 200 units of hexokinase was sufficient to convert all added [γ-32P]ATP to glucose-6-32P. Respiration was initiated with NADH. The reaction was terminated at the times indicated in the figures by adding 1.0 ml of 2 N HCl. [γ-32P]ATP and 32Piwere determined by scintillation counting of aqueous and organic phases after extraction of samples with isobutanol/benzene as described by Penefsky, 1977Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2891-2899Google Scholar. Glucose-6-32P was determined by the same methods after hydrolysis of the samples in 1 N HCl at 100°C for 7 min. The amount of [γ-32P]ATP bound in catalytic sites at each time point was determined by carrying out a cold chase measurement as described under Measurement of Unisite Catalysis. Submitochondrial particles (the type and amounts indicated in the figure legends) were mixed with substoichiometric amounts of [γ-32P]ATP in a reaction mixture containing 20 m M Tris-SO4, pH 8, 5 m M Pi, 5 m M MgSO4, and 0.25 M sucrose. The final volume was 1.0 ml. The reaction was carried out at room temperature in a flat bottom, glass scintillation vial with rapid stirring via a magnetic stirring bar and was started by adding the [γ-32P]ATP. At the times indicated in the figures, the reaction was stopped by adding 1 ml of 2 N HCl (acid quench), or a cold chase was carried out by adding 40 μl of 150 m M MgATP, permitting the reaction to proceed for an additional 5 s and then quenching with HCl as before. The amounts of [γ-32P]ATP and 32Piin reaction mixtures were determined by scintillation counting of aqueous and organic phases after extraction of deproteinized reaction mixtures with isobutanol/benzene. In separate experiments, it was determined that the extent of hydrolysis of the cold chase in these experiments was less than 2% of the added nonradioactive ATP. Thus, no correction was made for cold chase hydrolysis. Corrections were made for the 1-2% of free 32Pipresent in the [γ-32P]ATP. Binding was determined using acid quench and cold chase techniques as described earlier (Penefsky, 1985aPenefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13728-13734Google Scholar). Reconstituted, KCl-washed ETPH(Mg2+), 0.25 mg, or 2 mg of ETPH(Mg2+), were mixed with 0.01 nmol or 0.1 nmol, respectively, of [γ-32P]ATP, and the enzyme-substrate complex was allowed to form for periods of time indicated on the abscissae before the reactions were quenched with acid (lower curves) or chased by an excess of cold ATP (upper curves). The difference between hydrolysis in the acid quench and hydrolysis in the cold chase is set equal to the amount of radioactive ATP bound in catalytic sites. The amount of 32Piformed in cold chase experiments (upper curves) was set equal to the amount of enzyme-substrate complex formed (F1⋅32P). This latter value was used to calculate the bimolecular rate constants for ATP binding. The results are plotted in the form of a second order rate equation, as explained in the legends to Fig. 1 and 2.Figure 2:Rates of binding of [γ-32P]ATP in catalytic sites of ETPH(Mg2+). The composition of the reaction mixtures was exactly the same as described in Fig. 1 except that the concentration of ETPH(Mg2+) was 2 mg/ml. The concentration of [γ-32P]ATP was 0.01 μM for the experiments in panel A and 0.1 μM for the experiments in panels B-D. Experiments in panels A and B were done in the absence of NADH and ADP, in panel C, in the presence of 0.1 m M ADP, in panel D, in the presence of 1 m M NADH, and in panel E, in the presence of both NADH and ADP. The designations in panel F on each of the slopes refer to panels B-E. The calculated rate constant in the absence of ADP and NADH was 2.3 × 105M−1s−1; in the presence of 0.1 m M ADP, 1.6 × 105M−1s−1; in the presence of 1 m M NADH, 1.0 × 105M−1s−1and in the presence of both ADP and NADH, 3.8 × 104M−1s−1. The calculated k+1in panel A was 1.53 × 105M−1s−1. The calculated rate constant in a different preparation in the absence of ADP and NADH was 2.0 × 105M−1s−1; in the presence of 0.1 m M ADP, 0.23 × 105M−1s−1; in the presence of 1 m M NADH, 0.45 × 105M−1s−1, and in the presence of both ADP and NADH, 2.1 × 104M−1s−1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The reaction mixture contained 50 m M Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 0.25 M sucrose, 50 m M glucose, 5 m M magnesium acetate, 0.4 m M EDTA, 20 m M potassium phosphate, 32Pi(100-300 counts/min/nmol), 1 m M ADP, 50 units of hexokinase, and 60-70 μg of submitochondrial particles. After 5 min of incubation at 30°C, the reaction was initiated by adding 1 m M NADH. The final volume was 0.65 ml. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.05 ml of 70% perchloric acid. Glucose-6-32P formed was determined after extraction with isobutanol/benzene as described (Penefsky, 1977Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2891-2899Google Scholar). Negligibly small amounts of glucose-6-32P were formed during the 5-min preincubation period. The rate of oxidation of NADH was measured polarographically using a Yellow Springs Instruments model 53 device under exactly the same conditions used for the ATP synthesis measurement except that 32Piwas omitted and the final volume of the reaction mixture was 1.35 ml. ATPase was determined using a regenerating system for ATP as described by Pullman et al., 1960Pullman M.E. Penefsky H.S. Data A. Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 3322-3329Google Scholar. One unit of ATPase activity is defined as 1 μmol of ATP hydrolyzed per min. Specific activity is defined as units/milligram of protein. The concentration of mitochondrial proteins was determined by a modified Biuret procedure (Pullman et al., 1960Pullman M.E. Penefsky H.S. Data A. Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 3322-3329Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. A summary of the specific activities of the submitochondrial particles used in these experiments is shown in Table I. The ATPase activity of ETPH(Mg2+), 0.8-1 μmol of ATP/min/mg, line 1, was in the range commonly observed with these particles and a substantial rate of ATP synthesis with NADH as substrate also was found (1.06 μmol of ATP formed/min/mg protein). Washing with KCl increased the ATPase activity of the particles to a value of 11 units/mg, line 2, but reduced the rate of ATP synthesis as well as the P/O ratio. Reconstitution of KCl-washed particles with F1, line 3, was without effect on ATPase activity but substantially enhanced the rate of ATP synthesis. It should be noted that ATPase activity of the particles in lines 1-3 of the table was inhibited more than 90% by oligomycin. Binding measurements were carried out using the techniques of acid quench and cold chase as described previously (Penefsky, 1985aPenefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13728-13734Google Scholar, Penefsky, 1985bPenefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13735-13741Google Scholar). Fig. 1 A, lower curve, shows that relatively little hydrolysis of 0.005 μM [γ-32P]ATP (8%) occurred during 4 s of incubation with 0.125 mg of KCl-washed ETPH(Mg2+). However, the cold chase revealed that substantial binding of [γ-32P]ATP (50%) as such occurred during the same time period, Fig. 1 A, upper curve. The apparent rate of binding was similar to that previously reported (Penefsky, 1985aPenefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13728-13734Google Scholar), but reflected instead the lower ligand concentrations used. Throughout this paper it was assumed that each milligram of submitochondrial particles contained 0.4 nmol of F1(Harris et al., 1977Harris D.A. Radda G.K. Slater E.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 459: 560-572Google Scholar; Ferguson et al., 1976Ferguson S.J. Lloyd W.J. Radda G.K. Biochem. J. 1976; 159: 347-353Google Scholar; Beltran et al., 1986Beltran C. Tuena de Gomez-Puyou M. Darszon A. Gomez-Puyou A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 160: 163-168Google Scholar; Matsuno-Yagi and Hatefi, 1988Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 335-340Google Scholar). Thus, the molar ratio of F1to ATP in the experiment was calculated to be 10. Fig. 1 B shows that hydrolysis of 0.01 μM [γ-32P]ATP in the acid quench measurement, lower curve, was considerably enhanced in the presence of 0.1 m M ADP and that the acceleration of hydrolysis in the cold chase, upper curve, was correspondingly reduced. This observation is reminiscent of earlier findings that ADP promoted the hydrolysis of ATP bound in high affinity catalytic sites (Penefsky, 1985aPenefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13728-13734Google Scholar). The rate of hydrolysis in the acid quench of 0.01 μM[γ-32P]ATP in the presence of 1 m M NADH, Fig. 1 C, lower curve, was similar to that found in the absence of NADH, Fig. 1 A, lower curve. The cold chase experiment, Fig. 1 C, upper curve, indicates that a substantial amount of [γ-32P]ATP (23% of that which was added) was bound in catalytic sites after 5 s of incubation in the presence of NADH. However, in the presence of both ADP and NADH (Fig. 1 D), that is, under the conditions of oxidative phosphorylation, almost no ATP as such was found in the high affinity catalytic site. Hydrolysis in the acid quench was 14% after 5 s while hydrolysis in the cold chase was only 19%. The lower concentrations of enzyme and [γ-32P]ATP used in Fig. 1 A permitted better resolution of the initial portion of the “on” reaction. The results for Fig. 1, A- D, were plotted in the form of a second-order rate equation in Fig. 1 E. The calculated bimolecular rate constants (k+1), that is, the on rates, are summarized in Table II. k+1in the absence of any additions, Fig. 1 A, 3.5 × 106M−1s−1, compares well with the value previously reported for KCl-washed submitochondrial particles, Penefsky, 1985aPenefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13728-13734Google Scholar, of 4.0 × 106M−1s−1. The small differences in the values of k+1for the various experimental conditions of Fig. 1 were reproducible (Table II).Table II:Rate constants, equilibrium constants and free energy changes during ATP synthesis catalyzed by ETPH(Mg2+) and KCl-washed ETPH(Mg2+)Preparation of submitochondrial particles and the conditions used for each of the measurements are described under “Experimental Procedures.”Δ G (the observed free energy change) was calculated from the expression Δ G = - RT lnΔ KdATP. Open table in a new tab Preparation of submitochondrial particles and the conditions used for each of the measurements are described under “Experimental Procedures.”Δ G (the observed free energy change) was calculated from the expression Δ G = - RT lnΔ KdATP. The measurements with ETPH(Mg2+) were carried out under exactly the same conditions used for the study of KCl-washed and reconstituted submitochondrial particles except that the protein and [γ-32P]ATP concentrations were somewhat higher in the former. The experiments of Fig. 2, ETPH(Mg2+), panel A, were done using an 80-fold excess of enzyme over [γ-32P]ATP, 2 mg of particles (0.8 nmol of F1) and 0.01 nmol of [γ-32P]ATP, may be compared with those of Fig. 1 A, KCl-washed and reconstituted particles. When the concentration of [γ-32P]ATP was increased 10-fold, the rate of hydrolysis in the acid quench, panel B of Fig. 2, lower curve, was considerably higher than that in panel A of Fig. 2, lower curve. Nevertheless, the on rate constants were virtually identical in both experiments (Fig. 2, legend). In addition, the cold chase showed that 37% of added [γ-32]ATP was bound as such (calculated from the difference between cold chase and acid quench hydrolysis) in catalytic sites of ETPH(Mg2+) and activated particles (Fig. 2, panel A and Fig. 1, panel A, respectively) but only 24% in ETPH(Mg2+) in panel B of Fig. 2. The presence of 100 μM ADP was without effect on acid quench hydrolysis but reduced the level of bound [γ-32P]ATP as such to only 10% of that added, Fig. 2 C. Similar low levels of [γ-32P]ATP binding were seen in the presence of NADH, Fig. 2 D, and even less binding in the presence of NADH and ADP, Fig. 2 E. Piwas present in all of these experiments but had little effect on either the on rates or the “off” rates. Calculations of k+1from the slopes of second-order plots, Fig. 2 F, were carried out on the assumption that the particles contained 0.4 nmol of F1/mg of protein and that the observed binding took place in a single catalytic site. The results are shown in. Similar to experiments with KCl-washed particles, small but reproducible decreases in k+1were observed when the particles were energized (Table II). Measurement of the Rate of Binding of [γ-32P]ATP in High Affinity Catalytic Sites of ETPH(Mg2+) Using Hexokinase-The rate of binding of [γ-32P]ATP was determined as hexokinase-inaccessible ATP (see legend to Fig. 3) in order to allow for the possibility that the presence of ADP, which is known to inhibit ATPase activity (Pullman et al., 1960Pullman M.E. Penefsky H.S. Data A. Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 3322-3329Google Scholar; Vasilyeva et al., 1982Vasilyeva E.A. Minkov I.B. Fitin A.F. Vinogradov A.D. Biochem. J. 1982; 202: 9-14Google Scholar; Feldman et al., 1985) would interfere with measurements made via the cold chase technique. 2A.-K. Souid and H. S. Penefsky, unpublished observations. The on rate in the absence of ADP by the hexokinase method was 8 × 105M−1s−1and may be compared with a value of 2.3 × 105M−1s−1obtained by the cold chase technique, Fig. 2 A. The higher value of the on rate by the hexokinase method reflects the fact that 20-30% of the bound radioactive ATP that is inaccessible to hexokinase, cannot be chased into 32Pi. The on rate by the hexokinase technique in the presence of 0.1 m M ADP was 1.6 × 105M−1s−1and was the same in the presence of 1 m M NADH. The on rate constants in ETPH(Mg2+) in the presence of NADH and 0.1 m M ADP were also measured under the exact conditions used in but without Pi(Fig. 3). This was done in order to eliminate the possibility that ATP synthesis might interfere if it occurred during the on rate measurements. k+1in the absence of Piwas 5.0 × 104M−1s−1by the hexokinase method and 2.1 × 104M−1s−1by cold chase (Fig. 3, panels B and D, respectively). In reconstituted, KCl-washed ETPH(Mg2+), the on rate in the presence of NADH and 0.1 m M ADP and in the absence of Piwas 1.0 × 105M−1s−1. The Effect of ADP on the Energy-dependent Dissociation of [γ-32P]ATP from High Affinity Catalytic Sites on ETPH(Mg2+)-Incubation of submitochondrial particles, containing [γ-32P]ATP bound in high affinity catalytic sites, under the conditions of oxidative phosphorylation, that is, in the presence of NADH, ADP, and Pi, resulted in a kinetically competent, energy-dependent dissociation of the bound radioactive nucleotide. That is, the rate of dissociation of [γ-32P]ATP was at least as fast as the rate of ATP synthesis catalyzed by the same particles, Penefsky, 1985bPenefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13735-13741Google Scholar. Fig. 4 B, upper curve shows that 10 μM ADP was sufficient to provide maximal dissociation of bound [γ-32P]ATP during a 2-s incubation with NADH. In the presence of NADH and FCCP, Fig. 4 A, lower curve, only about 4% of added [γ-32P]ATP was dissociated in the presence of 300 μM ADP. Two points of importance emerged from this experiment. First, proton flux was itself sufficient to cause an energy-dependent dissociation of bound ATP (Fig. 4 A, upper curve (no added ADP) and Penefsky, 1985bPenefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13735-13741Google Scholar). Second, ADP served, in a cooperative manner, to enhance the energy-dependent dissociation of bound [γ-32P]ATP. In contrast to earlier observations (Penefsky, 1985bPenefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13735-13741Google Scholar), addition of NADH to submitochondrial particles containing [γ-32P]ATP bound in high affinity catalytic sites did not result in an increase in hydrolysis of [γ-32P]ATP.2NADH used in the earlier studies apparently contained a contaminant responsible for the stimulation of hydrolysis. The Rate of Dissociation of [γ-32P]ATP Bound in High Affinity Catalytic Sites-The rate of dissociation of bound [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of NADH or NADH and ADP was too fast to be measured by manual methods. Fig. 5 shows the results of a series of experiments with a rapid mixing device described earlier (Grubmeyer et al., 1982Grubmeyer C. Cross R.L. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12092-12100Google Scholar). The enzyme-substrate complex was formed in the first section of aging hose and was then mixed in a second section of aging hose with NADH and hexokinase or NADH, 0.1 m M ADP, and hexokinase. The time of incubation in the energized state is shown on the abscissa and was determined by a delay programmed into the instrument. It was necessary to use very large amounts of hexokinase (800 units/ml) in order to compensate for the relatively slow rate of the hexokinase reaction. Nevertheless, it was not possible to use higher concentrations of ADP or temperatures greater than 23°C because the resulting higher rates of dissociation would not have been resolved by the rate-limiting hexokinase reaction. The Rate of Dissociation of [γ-32P]ATP Bound in High Affinity Catalytic Sites of F1-reconstituted, KCl-washed ETPH(Mg2+)- shows that the rate of dissociation of bound ATP in the absence of any additions was 10−6s−1, in agreement with earlier values for the soluble, Grubmeyer, et al. (1982) and the membrane-bound, Penefsky, 1985aPenefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13728-13734Google Scholar, forms of the ATPase. The presence of 100 μM ADP in the reaction mixture was without effect on the rate of dissociation. However, in the presence of NADH or NADH and ADP, the rate of dissociation was 0.083 and 0.24 s−1, respectively. Thus, under the conditions of oxidative phosphorylation, that is, in the presence of NADH, ADP, and Pi, the rate of dissociation of [γ-32P]ATP bound in high affinity catalytic sites was increased about 105times above the non-energized rate.Figure 5:Rate of energy-dependent dissoci"

Pancreatic islet endocrine cells share common evolutionary and developmental origins with gut endocrine cells (1Pictet R. Rutter W.J. Steiner D.F. Freinkel N. Handbook of Physiology, Section 7: Endocrinology. Vol. 1. Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore, MD1972: 25-66Google Scholar). This relationship is emphasized by the transient expression of hormones such as gastrin, peptide-YY, and secretin in fetal islets even though these peptides are expressed largely in the luminal gastrointestinal tract in the adult (2Brand S.J.

Although little gastrin is expressed in the adult pancreas, it can be re-expressed when islets undergo neoplastic transformation. Therefore, the molecular mechanisms controlling gastrin gene transcription in islet cells represent an interesting example of developmental control of gene expression. Transgenic mouse studies have shown that 1300 bp 1The abbreviations used are:bpbase pair(s)WTwild typegATgastrin-ATRINrat insulinomaGNEgastrin negative element. of 5′-flanking DNA of the human gastrin gene appropriately regulates the transient expression of gastrin in fetal islets (9Wang T.C. Brand S.J. Yale J. Biol. Med. 1992; 65: 705-713PubMed Google Scholar). Detailed promoter analysis utilizing cultured gastrin-expressing rat insulinoma cell lines has identified regulatory elements that lie within 200 bp of the transcriptional start site (10Brand S.J. Wang T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16597-16603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Wang T.C. Brand S.J. J. Biol.

These include a sequence between −109 and −75 of the gastrin promoter that binds three transcription factors. A transcriptional activator binds to a CACC element at the 5′ end of this domain (12Tillotson L.G. Wang T.C. Brand S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2234-2240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, a repressor binds to an immediately adjacent 3′ sequence, the Gastrin Negative Element (GNE), which is similar to a repressor binding sequence in the β-interferon promoter (11Wang T.C. Brand S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8908-8914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immediately 3′ to the GNE sequence is another positive element containing an E-box motif (CANNTG), which has been shown to bind multiple helix-loop-helix transcription factors (13Demediuk B.H.

These elements were identified by deletional analysis, a method which may fail to detect other upstream sequences that regulate gastrin transcription. For this reason, we carried out systematic scanning mutagenesis of the 200-bp sequence upstream of the transcriptional start site and identified a new cis-regulatory domain from −163 to −140 which controls gastrin transcription in islet cells. There was mutually exclusive binding of two nuclear proteins to this domain, in which binding of one factor blocked the transcriptional activation by the other. Thus, the gastrin promoter comprises a tandem array of switch-like cis-regulatory elements in which activation can be blocked by factors binding to adjacent sequences. This tandem array of regulatory sequences may provide the molecular mechanism to explain the transient activation and subsequent repression of gastrin transcription in fetal islets. Linker scanning mutagenesis was performed utilizing a promoter construct containing 200 bp of 5′-flanking DNA of the human gastrin gene subcloned into the promoterless luciferase vector pXP2, as described previously (12Tillotson L.G. Wang T.C. Brand S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2234-2240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 11 linker scanning mutant constructs were generated by substituting a 10-bp cassette specifying adjacent XhoI and ScaI restriction sites (CTCGAGTACT) in sequential 10-bp blocks from −170 to −60 bp utilizing the unique site elimination method (15Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). The mutagenic primers contained 13 complementary nucleotides flanking both ends of the 10-bp substitution. The second primer set mutated a unique BglII site in the pXP2 vector. After heat-denaturing at 100°C and snap-cooling to 0°C, the plasmid vector with a 1000-fold molar excess of both primers was incubated with T4 DNA polymerase, T4 DNA ligase (both New England Biolabs), and all 4 dNTPs. Newly synthesized double-stranded plasmid constructs were digested with BglII (New England Biolabs) and transformed into the mismatch repair deficient mutS−Escherichia coli strain (16Zell R. Fritz H.J. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1809-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), miniprep DNA was prepared via a modified alkaline lysis procedure (Qiagen), and mutants were selected by digestion again with BglII and re-transformation into E. coli DH5-α cells. All mutant constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Minimal promoter constructs containing the wild-type (WT) or point mutant elements spanning −163 to −140 bp (see legend in Fig. 3) were created by ligation of kinased double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides into the BamHI site of the heterologous thymidine kinase promoter vector pT81 with a luciferase reporter (17Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-457PubMed Google Scholar), as described previously (12Tillotson L.G. Wang T.C. Brand S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2234-2240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All constructs were sequenced to confirm proper head-to-tail orientation of multimeric inserts. RIN 1046-38A (10Brand S.J. Wang T.C. J. Biol.

In Vitro (Rockville). 1980; 16: 212Google Scholar), Rat 2 (ATCC CRL 1764), Panc-1 (ATCC CRL 1469), and HepG2 (ATCC HB 8065) cells were cultured as described in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2% penicillin-streptomycin (all Bio-Whittaker). The RIN 38A cell line expresses gastrin, as determined by Northern blot hybridization with a rat gastrin Exon III riboprobe (data not shown). RIN 38A cells were transiently transfected with a modified DEAE-dextran protocol followed by a 10% dimethyl sulfoxide shock, as described previously (12Tillotson L.G. Wang T.C. Brand S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2234-2240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was assayed 48 h after transfection with luciferin, ATP, and coenzyme A (Promega) utilizing a monolight luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory). Transfections were performed at least 3 times and variation between experiments was not greater than 15%. Nuclear extracts were prepared by the method of Dignam (20Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (9159) Google Scholar) and quantitated utilizing a Bradford protein assay (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216261) Google Scholar). Partial purification of crude RIN 38A extracts was performed by passage over a phosphocellulose column (Whatman) or a DEAE-Sepharose column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) as described previously (22Samuels M. Fire A. Sharp P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14419-14427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to partially purify Sp1 and the gastrin AT-binding factor (gAT factor), respectively. Proteins adsorbed to the phosphocellulose or DEAE-Sepharose column were eluted with a 0.5 or 0.25 M KCl solution, respectively. The trace amount of gAT factor that was eluted off the phosphocellulose column was removed by incubation with the AT-rich oligo (gatccCTGACACTAAATGAAAGGGa) at a final concentration of 0.15 μM prior to passage over the phosphocellulose column again. All samples were then dialyzed against buffer A (20 m M HEPES (pH 8), 10% glycerol, 1.5 m M MgCl2, 75 m M KCl, 1 m M dithiothreitol, 0.2 m M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a 0.5 μg/ml mixture of aprotinin, antipain, pepstatin A, and leupeptin). Gel mobility shift assays were performed by incubating the various extracts with 4 fmol of double-stranded oligonucleotide probe (40,000 cpm) end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (DuPont NEN) by T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) in a 20-μl binding reaction containing 25 m M HEPES (pH 7.9), 100 m M KCl, 5 m M MgCl2, 1 m M EDTA, 1 m M dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.5-1.0 μg of poly(dA-dT)/poly(dA-dT) (Pharmacia) as a nonspecific competitor. The 30-bp wild-type synthetic probe used in this study (gatccACACTAAATGAAAGGGCGGGGCAGa) spans the gastrin promoter from −163 to −140 bp and was polyacrylamide gel-purified. Competition experiments were carried out by preincubating the nuclear extract with a 25-125-fold excess of cold competitor oligonucleotides prior to the addition of probe. For Sp1 supershift assays, extracts were preincubated with varying amounts of a polyclonal Sp1 antibody (Santa Cruz) or control rabbit antiserum (12CA5 polyclonal antisera, gift from Anil K. Rustgi) for 10 min. Zinc chelation assays were performed by preincubating the nuclear extracts in buffer containing either 10 or 25 m M EGTA prior to the addition of probe. EGTA was selected for its ability to efficiently chelate Zn2+but not Mg2+cations (23Gegenheimer P. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 174-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), the latter being a component of the gel shift assay buffer. All samples were then incubated for 10 min at room temperature prior to loading onto a 0.5 × TBE, 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel run at 10 V/cm. For oligonucleotide sequences, upper case letters represent gastrin gene sequence and lower case letters represent BamHI or BglII cloning sites added onto the native sequence. Methylation interference assays were performed as described previously (24Baldwin A.S. Ausubel F.A. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Vol. 2. John Wiley & Sons, New York1988: 12.3.1-12.3.6Google Scholar). The 32P singly end-labeled double-stranded 30-bp WT oligonucleotide was partially methylated with dimethyl sulfate (Aldrich) and then purified with two rounds of ethanol precipitation. 20,000 cpm of probe was incubated with nuclear extracts in a typical gel shift reaction and run on a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel as described earlier. An autoradiogram of the gel revealed bands corresponding to Sp1 and gAT binding complexes as well as unbound probe, all of which were excised and electroeluted. After piperidine cleavage, the samples representing bound and free probe were resolved on an 8% sequencing gel. Probes for footprinting assays were derived from the wild-type gAT-Sp1 pT81 plasmid construct. Probes were 3′ Klenow end-labeled on the lower strand with all 4 [α-32P]dNTPs (DuPont NEN) after restriction digestion with BamHI. After complete excision of the labeled fragment by digestion with SalI, 20,000 cpm of gel-purified probe was incubated with gAT-factor-enriched nuclear extract C for 10 min at room temperature in a 100-μl binding reaction containing 10 m M Tris (pH 8.0), 5 m M MgCl2, 1 m M CaCl2, 2 m M dithiothreitol, 100 m M KCl, and 3 μg of poly(dA-dT)/poly(dA-dT). The samples were digested with varying amounts of deoxyribonuclease I (Promega) for 2 min at 20°C and then immediately ethanol precipitated with 5 M ammonium acetate and 2.5 μg of yeast tRNA (Sigma). The digested samples were resolved on an 8% sequencing gel. Linker Scanning Mutagenesis Identifies Important Gastrin Regulatory Elements Between −160 and −141 bp-To identify additional cis-regulatory elements controlling gastrin transcription in islet cells not seen by 5′-deletional analysis, a series of linker scanning mutations was constructed. Prior deletional analysis demonstrated that 200 bp of 5′-flanking DNA of the human gastrin gene contained the regulatory elements that conferred most of the transcriptional activity in gastrin-expressing RIN 38A insulinoma cells (11Wang T.C. Brand S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8908-8914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Tillotson L.G. Wang T.C. Brand S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2234-2240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The linker scanning mutations systematically substituted 10-bp blocks from −170 to −61 bp. The 11 linker scanning mutant constructs were confirmed by direct sequencing and then transiently transfected into 38A islet cells. Reporter gene activity was compared to that of the wild-type gas200 pXP2 vector. Fig. 1 shows the functional domains identified within the proximal 200 bp of the gastrin promoter which regulate transcription in islet cells. The first includes block mutants 2 and 3, which correspond to an AT-rich sequence CTAAATGAAA (−160 to −151 bp) and an Sp1 consensus binding site GGGCGGGGCA (−150 to −141 bp), neither of which has been described previously as an important regulatory element in the gastrin gene. Mutations in these elements led to a 25-30% fall in transcriptional activity. The second domain is defined by block mutant 6 which mutates the CACC element, known to be a transcriptional activator in 38A cells (12Tillotson L.G. Wang T.C. Brand S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2234-2240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There was an augmentation of activity with block mutant 7, corresponding to a de-repression of the inhibitory GNE (11Wang T.C. Brand S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8908-8914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The final domain spans blocks 9 and 10, which mutate the previously characterized gastrin E-box (11Wang T.C. Brand S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8908-8914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and another Sp1 binding site which interacts with the gastrin-epidermal growth factor response element (25Merchant J.L. Demediuk B. Brand S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2686-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This linker scanning data corroborates earlier analyses which characterized these aforementioned promoter elements. Prior studies, however, had not identified this gastrin AT-rich (gAT) element and adjacent Sp1 consensus site as important regulatory elements. Gel mobility shift assays were performed by incubating crude nuclear extracts prepared from RIN 38A insulinoma cells with a 30-bp double-stranded wild-type probe encompassing both new elements (gatccACACTAAATGAAAGGGCGGGGCAGa) in order to characterize the islet nuclear proteins binding to the −160 to −141 sequence. Fig. 2 A shows the presence of 3 binding complexes, labeled Ia, Ib, and II (lane 1). Complexes Ia and Ib were competed by a 125-fold excess of a consensus Sp1 oligonucleotide, suggesting that they represent Sp1 factor binding to the downstream GC-rich element (lane 2). Complex II was not affected by competition with the GC-rich Sp1 sequence, indicating that it represents binding by a distinct factor to another sequence. However, complex II was competed away by an oligonucleotide containing only the upstream AT-rich sequence (lane 3). This AT-rich sequence did not compete for binding of the Sp1-like factor found in complex Ia and Ib, again suggesting the factors recognize discrete sites. Addition of Sp1 antisera to 38A nuclear extracts in gel mobility shift assays supershifted the slower migrating complex Ia (Fig. 2 B, lanes 2-4), confirming that the Sp1 transcription factor does bind to this sequence. A control antibody did not supershift any complex (Fig. 2 B, lane 5). Since Sp1 binding is dependent upon its zinc finger domains, chelation of zinc abolishes Sp1 binding to DNA (26Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar). Accordingly, addition of the chelator EGTA to the islet nuclear extracts quantitatively reduced complex Ia and Ib formation but not complex II (Fig. 2 C). Significantly, abolition of Sp1 binding by EGTA enhanced complex II formation, suggesting that there was competition between Sp1 binding and the binding of the gAT factor to the adjacent AT-rich sequence. Complex Ib may also represent binding by Sp1 or an Sp1-like factor because of the identical sequence specificity, sensitivity to zinc chelation, and chromatographic co-purification with Sp1. However, the anti-Sp1 antisera does not apparently supershift the Ib complex. This may be a consequence of the species difference between the 38A extract (rat) and the antigenic specificity of the antibody (human Sp1), or that complex Ib may represent binding by an immunologically distinct member of the Sp1 family (27Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 28Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4251-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, complex Ib does not represent simultaneous binding of both Sp1 and gAT factors. The factors binding in complex I and II could be separated physically by ion-exchange chromatography. Crude nuclear preparations from 38A islet cells were first applied to a cation exchange phosphocellulose column. Subsequent elution with 0.5 M KCl yielded extract B, a fraction enriched for Sp1 (complex I) without contamination by the factor in complex II which binds the AT-rich sequence (Fig. 2 D, lane 1). The gAT factor was enriched by passage of the crude nuclear extract over an anion exchange DEAE-Sepharose column. The subsequent 0.25 M KCl eluate (extract C) contained only the AT-binding factor (Fig. 2 D, lane 7). Reconstitution experiments were performed to test whether various stoichiometric mixtures of the two enriched fractions showed any evidence of cooperative interactions (Fig. 2 D, lanes 2-6). In no combination did a new binding complex appear in gel mobility shift assays. While this is suggestive of mutually exclusive binding by the two factors, it is possible that other complexes form which are not stable during electrophoresis. The nucleotides within the −163 to −140 sequence necessary for DNA binding of these two factors were then localized more precisely. First, the nucleotides necessary for DNA binding of the Sp1 factor were defined utilizing gel mobility shift assays with mutant oligonucleotide competitors which sequentially spanned the sequence from −163 to −140 bp (Fig. 3 A, legend). Utilizing the Sp1-enriched 38A nuclear fraction B in a gel shift assay, specific binding residues were identified (Fig. 3 A). Mutant oligonucleotides M1 and M2 competed as well as the wild-type oligonucleotide (lanes 2-4). Mutant oligonucleotides M3, M4, and M5 were unable to compete, however, indicating that those mutated base pairs interacted with the Sp1 factor (lanes 5-7). As expected, an Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide competed away all binding activity to the gastrin probe (lane 8). These binding interactions were directly confirmed in a methylation interference assay by delineating the specific G and A residues in this gastrin promoter sequence that interact with Sp1 (Fig. 3 B). The nucleotides in the sequence necessary for Sp1 binding are summarized in Fig. 3 C, as defined first by competition analysis and then corroborated by methylation interference. The nucleotides necessary for binding of the gAT factor were also defined by competition with mutant oligonucleotides. The gAT factor binding site lay adjacent to the Sp1 site but did not overlap with nucleotides necessary for Sp1 binding since oligo M2 failed to compete for gAT factor binding (Fig. 4 A, lane 4) but effectively competed Sp1 binding (Fig. 3 A, lane 4). Conversely, oligos M3, M4, and M5 bound the gAT factor but not Sp1 (Fig. 4 A, lanes 5-7). Furthermore, an oligonucleotide containing a consensus Sp1 sequence did not displace gAT factor binding (Fig. 4 A, lane 8). Oligo M1 competed as well as the wild-type (Fig. 4 A, lane 2), indicating that the critical residues for gAT factor binding were mutated in the M2 oligo. Methylation interference assays were unsuccessful probably due to the relative paucity of G residues in the gAT factor binding domain. DNase I footprinting was therefore performed, which demonstrated footprinting of the gAT factor over the AT-rich sequence (Fig. 4 B, lane 1). The close agreement between the nucleotides for binding shown in the competition assays and the residues footprinted (Fig. 4 C) indicate that the AT-rich element is directly adjacent to the GC-rich sequence necessary for Sp1 binding. Such proximity of these two sites makes steric interference the likely mechanism which prevents simultaneous binding of the two factors to the adjacent sequences. To determine the functional significance of this mutually exclusive interaction between these 2 factors, heterologous promoter pT81 reporter genes containing the WT and mutant oligonucleotides listed in Fig. 3 A (WT, M1-M5) were designed. These constructs were transfected into the gastrin-expressing islet cell line RIN 38A and luciferase reporter gene activity was measured. A single copy of the −163 to −140 WT gastrin promoter sequence weakly activated transcription (2.3-fold above the basal enhancerless pT81), indicating that the intact bipartite domain functions as a weak activator in islet cells (Fig. 5). Construct M1, which can bind both the gAT and Sp1 factors (lane 3, Figs. 3 A and 4 A), behaved similarly to the wild-type, weakly activating transcription. However, construct M2, which cannot bind the gAT factor but can bind Sp1 (lane 4, Figs. 3 A and 4 A), showed a 4.8-fold increase in activity above the wild-type and an 11.0-fold increase over basal, indicating that the gAT factor functions to inhibit the strong transcriptional activation mediated by Sp1. Constructs M3, M4, and M5 which all bind the gAT factor but not Sp1 (lanes 5-7, Figs. 3 A and 4 A) only weakly activated transcription to levels comparable to the wild-type construct. These findings suggest that in RIN 38A insulinoma cells, the wild-type gastrin promoter preferentially binds the gAT factor, which behaves as a weak activator. Binding of the gAT factor prevents Sp1 binding to the adjacent sequence, blocking the stronger transcriptional activation mediated by Sp1. To further characterize the gAT factor, competition studies were then performed with AT-rich consensus motifs of known transcription factors expressed in the pancreas and gastrointestinal tract. Fig. 6 indicates that there was only partial competition for gAT factor binding with binding sequences derived from the ubiquitous POU-domain factor Oct-1 (29Herr W. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional Regulation. Vol. 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 1103-1135Google Scholar), the liver and intestinal homeodomain factors HNF-1 and HNF-3 (30Xanthopoulos K.G. Prezioso V.R. Chen W.S. Sladek F.M. Cortese R. Darnell J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3807-3811Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and the glucagon G2 element (31Philippe J. Drucker D.J. Knepel W. Jepeal L. Misulovin Z. Habener J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4877-4888Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). There was minimal competition with elements for the pancreatic islet homeodomain factors isl-1 (32Karlsson O. Thor S. Norberg T. Ohlsson H. Edlund T. Nature. 1990; 344: 879-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar) and STF-1/idx-1 (33Leonard J. Peers B. Johnson T. Ferreri K. Lee S. Montminy M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1275-1283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Miller C.P. McGehee Jr., R.E. Habener J.F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1145-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Only one competitor completely displaced binding, the “B” element found in the elastase I promoter which binds the islet transcription factor βTF-1 (35Kruse F. Rose S.D. Swift G.H. Hammer R.E. MacDonald R.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 774-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The 8-bp core binding sequence in the elastase promoter for βTF-1 (ATAAATGA) is nearly identical to the gastrin AT-rich element (CTAAATGA) and both include the important binding residues (underlined) in the gastrin promoter for the gAT factor (CTAAATGA). DNA sequence elements with this core consensus motif are also found within the insulin promoter (GAAATGA) (35Kruse F. Rose S.D. Swift G.H. Hammer R.E. MacDonald R.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 774-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and an oligonucleotide competitor containing this insulin sequence competed away gAT factor binding from the gastrin probe as effectively as the elastase B oligo (data not shown). Prior studies defined the βTF-1 factor as islet-cell specific because it was detected in 38A islet cells but not in acinar AR42J cells or fibroblast Rat 2 cells (35Kruse F. Rose S.D. Swift G.H. Hammer R.E. MacDonald R.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 774-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In order to characterize the tissue distribution of the gAT factor, gel shift studies were performed with nuclear extracts from these cell lines utilizing the wild-type gastrin probe. Fig. 7 indicates that the identical gAT factor complex is identifiable in both 38A and AR42J cells but not in Rat 2 cells, suggesting that the gAT factor is therefore distinct from βTF-1. These differences in electrophoretic patterns were also observed when the elastase B element and gastrin wild-type probes were run in parallel gel mobility shift assays with 38A and AR42J nuclear extracts (data not shown). Furthermore, a survey of additional cell lines revealed that binding activity was also detected in the ductular pancreatic cell line Panc-1 and weaker activity was observed in the hepatic cell line HepG2. This study has identified additional cis-regulatory elements within the gastrin promoter lying between −163 and −140, upstream of previously characterized regulatory sequences (11Wang T.C. Brand S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8908-8914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Brand S.J. Babyatsky M. Bachwich D. Demediuk B. Tillotson L. Wang T.C. Walsh J.H. Gastrin. Raven Press, New York1993: 73-89Google Scholar, 25Merchant J.L. Demediuk B. Brand S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2686-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The proximal 200 base pairs of the gastrin promoter contain multiple positive and negative cis-regulatory sequences, and scanning mutagenesis studies indicate that no single element is essential for transcription but rather that transcriptional activity is dependent upon the combined action of the CACC, E-box, and proximal and distal Sp1 positive cis-regulatory elements. Adjacent to each of these positive sites are negative cis-regulatory elements which modulate the activity of these activating elements. Transactivation by the CACC and E-box binding factor is antagonized by a factor binding to the GNE (11Wang T.C. Brand S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8908-8914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sp1 transactivation via the proximal Sp1 site (−68) is inhibited by factors interacting with the adjacent epidermal growth factor-response element (36Merchant J. Shiotani A. Marks P. Gastroenterology. 1994; 106: A827Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Similarly, the present study demonstrated that Sp1 transactivation at the distal Sp1 site (−150) is inhibited by a competing factor binding to an adjacent AT-rich site. Although the gAT factor has not been fully characterized, it binds a TAAT motif recognized by many homeodomain transcription factors (37Levine M. Hoey T. Cell. 1988; 55: 537-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 38Kornberg T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26813-26816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Homeodomain factors often regulate tissue-specific gene expression and in islet cells, isl-1 and STF-1/idx-1 are well characterized pancreatic endocrine homeodomain factors which regulate insulin and somatostatin gene expression, respectively (32Karlsson O. Thor S. Norberg T. Ohlsson H. Edlund T. Nature. 1990; 344: 879-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 33Leonard J. Peers B. Johnson T. Ferreri K. Lee S. Montminy M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1275-1283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Miller C.P. McGehee Jr., R.E. Habener J.F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1145-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). However, the gAT factor displayed minimal affinity for these homeodomain factor binding sites in gel mobility shift assays. Rather, the gAT factor recognized a sequence bound by the islet cell nuclear protein βTF-1. Although their sequence specificity is similar, the gAT binding factor differs from βTF-1 in electrophoretic mobility and cell specificity in gel shift assays. Interestingly, βTF-1 was first identified as a factor which binds the B cis-regulatory element (ATAAATGA) in the enhancer of the elastase I gene (35Kruse F. Rose S.D. Swift G.H. Hammer R.E. MacDonald R.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 774-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Although the elastase gene is specifically expressed in pancreatic exocrine cells, a transgene comprising multiple copies of the isolated βTF-1 element is expressed only in islet β-cells (35Kruse F. Rose S.D. Swift G.H. Hammer R.E. MacDonald R.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 774-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The islet cell factors binding to the βTF-1 sequence also activate insulin gene transcription via a βTF-1-like element found within the insulin enhancer (35Kruse F. Rose S.D. Swift G.H. Hammer R.E. MacDonald R.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 774-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Multiple copies of both the isolated elastase and insulin βTF-1 elements strongly activate islet-specific transcription of a basal promoter reporter gene in RIN 38A cells (35Kruse F. Rose S.D. Swift G.H. Hammer R.E. MacDonald R.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 774-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In contrast, 5 tandem copies of the gastrin-AT element subcloned into the minimal promoter construct pT81-Luc activated transcription only a modest 2-fold above basal levels in RIN 38A cells (data not shown). Collectively, these results indicate that the gAT factor is not βTF-1 even though both bind similar DNA sequences. Further characterization of both βTF-1 and the gAT binding factor will be necessary to more precisely define their relationship. Transactivation of gastrin transcription by Sp1 appears to be attenuated by binding of the gAT factor to the adjacent AT-rich sequence. Down-regulation of Sp1 transactivation by steric effects of neighboring transcription factors has been shown to be important in regulating transcription of other genes. In the collagen α(I) gene promoter, the GC-rich Sp1 binding site directly overlaps with the CCAAT box binding site such that Sp1 and nuclear factor-1 interactions are mutually exclusive (39Nehls M.C. Rippe R.A. Veloz L. Brenner D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4065-4073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Nehls M.C. Grapilon M.L. Brenner D.A. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Although each factor can activate the collagen gene independently, nuclear factor-1 functions as an inhibitor of Sp1-mediated transcriptional activation. Other examples of transcriptional regulation mediated by the displacement of Sp1 by competing factors include the ornithine decarboxylase gene (41Li R.S. Abrahamsen M.S. Johnson R.R. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7941-7949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the δ-globin gene (42Yu C. Chen J. Lin L. Tam M. Shen C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 282-294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A more complex interaction has been described between Sp1 and the pituitary-specific homeodomain factor Pit-1 in the regulation of the growth hormone gene (43Schaufele F. West B.L. Reudelhuber T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17189-17196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Lemaigre F. LaFontaine D. Courtois S. Durviaux S. Rousseau G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1811-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Binding studies indicate that their interactions are also mutually exclusive. Although they do not bind simultaneously, maximal growth hormone gene activity occurs when the binding sites for both factors are intact, indicating that transcriptional regulation is mediated by sequential rather than simultaneous binding of the two factors. Activation of gastrin transcription in islet cells is strongly dependent upon the ubiquitous transactivator Sp1 even though gastrin gene expression is highly cell-specific and temporally restricted to the neonatal period. Although negative regulation is probably a highly important determinant of this tissue and temporal specificity, Sp1 levels can vary dramatically in different developmental stages (45Saffer J.D. Jackson S.P. Annarella M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). In the mouse, it is expressed at highest levels in tissues undergoing final differentiation, such as in spermatids or hematopoietic cells. Lower levels are seen in terminally differentiated cells. Within the gastrointestinal tract, expression in the stomach is high at the time of weaning and persists throughout adult life (45Saffer J.D. Jackson S.P. Annarella M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Since there is continuous differentiation of gut endocrine cells from the population of endodermal stem cells throughout adult life, the concurrent high level of Sp1 expression may be relevant. The developmental expression of Sp1 within the pancreas has not been examined but such studies would be of great interest. The developmental regulation of Sp1 may thus influence the developmental expression of Sp1-regulated genes, such as gastrin. Thus far, two Sp1 binding sites have been identified in the gastrin promoter. Sp1 binding to a proximal G-rich element (−68 to −53) is an important component of epidermal growth factor-stimulated gastrin gene expression in rat pituitary GH4 cells, as described previously (25Merchant J.L. Demediuk B. Brand S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2686-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). As the current report demonstrates, an additional upstream Sp1 binding site is strongly activating in gastrin-expressing islet cell lines. Mutations in either Sp1 site (Fig. 1, constructs 1 and 10) are associated with diminished transcriptional activity compared to the wild type. Prior studies have established that Sp1 binding at multiple elements has a synergistic effect on transcriptional activation (46Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). One proposed mechanism for such long range interactions involves DNA looping mediated by tetramers of Sp1 binding to proximal and distal enhancers simultaneously (47Mastrangelo I.A. Courey A.J. Wall J.S. Jackson S.P. Hough P.V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5670-5674Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Such cooperative interactions between Sp1 elements may similarly play a role in activating gastrin transcription during islet cell differentiation. Inhibiting binding at just one of these Sp1 sites by an islet cell factor binding to the adjacent gAT site may be a critical determinant in switching off gastrin transcription. Such an interaction may explain why repression of gastrin expression coincides with full differentiation of the pancreatic islets, when many pancreas-specific transcription factors are maximally expressed. Future studies will need to focus on identifying the relative levels of these different factors at different times in pancreatic development. In addition to elucidating the molecular mechanisms controlling pancreatic development, these studies may provide insight into the reactivation of gastrin expression with the neoplastic transformation of pancreatic islets.

The predominant model for the motif that promotes rapid internalization proposes a requirement for a tyrosine located in the first position of a tight turn. In this report we show that an internalization motif can be created de novo by substituting a tyrosine for the first or last residues of a tetrapeptide GDNS (residues 31-34) that is predicted to form a tight turn within the cytoplasmic domain of the human transferrin receptor. These substitutions restore wild-type levels of internalization to transferrin receptors that are poorly internalized due to missense mutations in the native internalization motif. The introduction of a tyrosine at the first or last position of the GDNS tetrapeptide in a transferrin receptor containing an unmodified wild-type internalization motif significantly increases the internalization rate above that of the wild-type receptor. Our results indicate that a functional novel internalization motif can be created by placing specific aromatic amino acids within the overall structure of an existing β-turn in a cytoplasmic domain of a receptor.

https://openalex.org/W2035318317,"The human alcohol dehydrogenase 5 gene (ADH5) differs from all other human alcohol dehydrogenase genes in its ubiquitous expression, although there are tissue-specific differences in the level of expression. To understand the expression of ADH5, we characterized the structure and function of its 5′ region by DNase I footprinting and transient transfection assays. The region from base pair (bp) −34 to +61, flanking the major transcription start site, had strong promoter activity in three different cell lines: HeLa, H4IIE-C3, and CV-1, and could explain the ubiquitous expression. Two Sp1 sites within that region are footprinted by nuclear extracts from all tissues and cells tested. There are sites further upstream that show cell- and tissue-specific differences in both their patterns of occupancy and their effects on promoter activity. The region between bp −34 and −64 strongly increases promoter activity in H4IIE-C3 cells, weakly activates in CV-1 cells, but has no effect in HeLa cells. The region between bp −127 and −163 is a positive element in both HeLa cells and CV-1 cells, but is a negative regulatory element in H4IIE-C3 cells. These differences in part explain the levels of expression of ADH5 in various tissues. Two regions (bp −64 to −127 and bp −163 to −365) contain negative regulatory elements that reduce promoter activity in all three cells. The 5′-nontranslated region of ADH5 contains two upstream ATGs. Insertion of 12 bp within the putative coding region of these upstream ATGs led to a 1.6-2.3-fold increase in activity. This suggests that the 5′-nontranslated region has regulatory significance.

The human ADH5 gene encodes χ-alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.1), which is expressed in all tissues tested and at all stages of development.

ADH5 was recently cloned in our laboratory (18Hur M.-W. Edenberg H.J. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 121: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The 5′ nontranslated region of ADH5 is unusual; it contains two upstream ATG codons that are in frame with each other but out of frame with the χ-ADH coding sequence (18Hur M.-W. Edenberg H.J. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 121: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The high conservation and presumed physiological importance of χ-ADH, the quantitative differences in expression in different tissues, and the unusual 5′ nontranslated region all make ADH5 an interesting gene to study. To analyze the molecular mechanisms underlying the expression of ADH5 in different tissues, we used DNase I footprinting to detect cis-acting elements. We carried out functional assays of the promoter using transient transfections of a reporter gene into three different cell lines: H4IIE-C3 (a rat hepatoma line), HeLa (a human cervical carcinoma line), and CV-1 (a monkey kidney fibroblast line). We found that a small promoter region functions well in all three cell lines, and we detected multiple positive and negative regulatory regions further upstream. Several cis-acting elements act as positive regulatory elements in one cell line but as negative regulatory elements in another. We also showed that a minor alteration in the 5′-nontranslated region can have a significant effect on gene expression. All enzymes were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., Promega (Madison, WI), and Boehringer Mannheim. The buffers for restriction enzymes were supplied by the manufacturers. Poly(dI˙dC) was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim and Pharmacia Biotech Inc. The exonuclease III nested deletion kit and phosphorothioate dNTP were purchased from Promega (Erase a Base System, Promega). Other nucleotides were purchased from Pharmacia. [γ-32P]ATP and [α-32P]dNTPs were purchased from DuPont. Silica gel TLC plates were purchased from Eastman Kodak Co. or J. T. Baker (Baker Flex; Phillipsburg, NJ). pCAT Control and pCAT Basic were purchased from Promega. pCAT Control contains the SV40 promoter, enhancer, and CAT coding sequence. pCAT Basic contains the CAT coding sequence but lacks a eukaryotic promoter and enhancer. pCMV-Luc (19de Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2478) Google Scholar) contains a firefly luciferase gene driven by a Cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter in a vector called pCDNAI (Invitrogen); it was obtained from Dr. Y.-C. Yang (Indiana University School of Medicine). pCAT-X-1342 contains the 1.4-kb FokI fragment of ADH5 subcloned into pCAT Basic at a blunted XbaI site in front of the CAT gene; it contains ADH5 sequences extending from bp −1342 to +61 relative to the transcription initiation site. The pCAT-X series of plasmids was derived from pCAT-X-1342 by 5′ nested deletions using exonuclease III or using restriction endonucleases followed by Klenow treatment to create blunt ends before subcloning. All pCAT-X plasmids extend to bp +61; their 5′ ends are at the positions designated in their names (i.e. pCAT-X-163 contains from bp −163 to +61 of the ADH5 promoter; see Fig. 2). pCAT-AA was created by cloning the AvaI restriction fragment (bp −726 to −61) into pCAT Basic at the PstI site (blunted). pCAT-H-1342 contains the same 1.4-kb FokI fragment of ADH5 as in pCAT-X-1342 (bp −1342 to +61), except that it is subcloned into pCAT Basic at a blunted HindIII site in front of the CAT gene. pCAT-H-253 was made from pCAT-H-1342 by 3′ deletion as described above; it contains ADH5 sequences from bp −1342 to −253 (Fig. 2). The deleted plasmids were sequenced from both direction using primers flanking the insertion site (HE13, CAGGAAACAGCTATGACC and HE66, CAACGGTGGTATATCCAGTG). Two additional oligonucleotides were used to sequence regions originally obtained in only one direction. Nuclear extracts were prepared from liver, kidney, spleen, and brain of C57BL/6J mice according to Gorski et al. (20Gorski K. Carneiro M. Schibler U. Cell. 1986; 47: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts from cultured cells (CV-1, H4IIE-C3) were made according to Shapiro et al. (21Shapiro D.J. Sharp P.A. Wahli W.W. Keller M.J. DNA (N. Y.). 1988; 7: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). HeLa cell nuclear extract, Sp1, AP-2, and TFIID were purchased from Promega. Antibodies to Sp1 (Sp1(PEP2)) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). To examine the proximal region, pCAT-H-1342 was digested with NarI (at bp −128), dephosphorylated with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase, and labeled with polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. After removal of the free nucleotides by Sephadex G25 spin column chromatography (22Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar), the DNA was digested with XbaI (a restriction site in the polylinker). For footprinting from the opposite end of the fragment, the order of digestion was opposite, so the XbaI site was labeled. The NarI to XbaI fragment was purified by anion exchange HPLC column chromatography (Gen-Pak Fax column, Waters, Milford, MA). For footprinting upstream of the NarI site, the AvaI fragment from pCAT-X-1342 was dephosphorylated, kinased with [γ-32P]ATP, and digested with HinfI; the 331-bp fragment (bp −402 bp to −61) was isolated by HPLC as described above. For footprinting in opposite direction, the AvaI fragment was digested with HinfI and HaeIII, the resulting HinfI to AvaI fragment was separated, dephosphorylated, kinased, and further digested with EcoRII. The HinfI/ EcoRII fragment was separated by HPLC and used for the DNase I footprint assays. DNase I digestion and electrophoresis were as described previously (23Brown C.J. Baltz K.A. Edenberg H.J. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 121: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Nuclear extract (10-40 μg), probe (40,000 cpm) and poly(dI˙dC) (1-2 μg) were mixed in binding buffer (10 m M HEPES (pH 7.9), 60 m M KCl, 1 m M EDTA, 7% glycerol, 0.2 m M dithiothreitol) and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. 5 μl of DNase I (0.2-0.4 unit) was added and incubated for 2 min. When extract was omitted, 0.04 unit of DNase I were used. For purified transcription factors and their control reactions, 60 ng of factors (Sp1, AP-2, TFIID), 0.004 unit of DNase I, and no poly(dI˙dC) were used. DNase I digestion was stopped by adding 75 μl of DNase I stop solution (20 m M Tris (pH 7.5), 20 m M EDTA, 5 m M EGTA, and 5 μg/ml yeast tRNA). The mixture was extracted once with phenol/CHCl3and precipitated by the addition of 0.5 volume of 7.5 M ammonium acetate and 2.5 volume of ethanol. The pellets were resuspended in 5 μl of sequencing loading buffer. The digested DNA (10,000 cpm) was electrophoresed in a 6% polyacrylamide/7 M urea sequencing gel (Life Technologies, Inc.) for about 50 min. An autoradiogram was obtained by exposing the dried gel to film (XAR-5, Eastman Kodak Co.) overnight at −70°C with a Quanta III image enhancing screen (DuPont). Gel mobility shift assays were carried out as described previously (23Brown C.J. Baltz K.A. Edenberg H.J. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 121: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The site B oligonucleotide was a double-stranded oligonucleotide with the sequence (top strand) TAGGCGCTCGCCACGCCCATGCCTCCGTC. The mutant site B oligonucleotide had the sequence TAGGCGCTCGCTCTAGATATGCCTCCGTC. The site C oligonucleotide was a double-stranded oligonucleotide with the sequence (top strand) CCCCCACGCCCCGCCCCCCTCGCTAGGCGC. The mutant site C oligonucleotide had the sequence CCCCCCACGCAAGATCTCACTCGCTAGGC. One strand of each oligonucleotide was labeled using polynucleotide kinase as described above, and the complementary oligonucleotides were annealed. Each assay contained (in 20 μl) 10 m M HEPES (pH 7.9), 60 m M KCl, 1 m M dithiothreitol, 1 m M EDTA, 7% glycerol and the appropriate extract (5.2 μg of HeLa nuclear extract or 1 footprinting unit of purified Sp1. Where indicated, 0.5 or 2.0 μl of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide (at 4 pmol/μl) or 1 μg of antibody against Sp1 was added to the incubation. Electrophoresis was at 80 V for 4 h in 4% polyacrylamide gel with 0.167 × TAE buffer (1 × TAE, 40 m M Tris, 20 m M acetic acid, 1 m M EDTA). CV-1 (African green monkey kidney cells), H4IIE-C3 (rat hepatoma cells), and HeLa (human cervical carcinoma cells) were grown on 10-cm dishes in minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (CV-1 and HeLa) or in SWIM'S medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (H4IIE-C3). Medium was replaced 4 h before the transfections. 15 μg of pCAT-X-1342 (or the molar equivalent of other plasmids), 2 μg of pCMV-Luc, and sufficient pUC18 to bring the total DNA to 25 μg were transfected into the cells by the CaCl2-DNA coprecipitation method (24Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1983; 52: 456-457Crossref Scopus (6491) Google Scholar). The DNA was allowed to remain on the cells for 4 h (CV-1, HeLa cells) or 18 h (H4IIE-C3 cells), then the medium was removed and replaced for 2 min with medium containing either 20% (CV-1, HeLa) or 15% (H4IIE-C3) glycerol. The glycerol-containing medium was replaced with the appropriate growth medium, and incubation was continued for a total of 48 h. The plates were gently washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were harvested, and cell pellets were resuspended in 150 μl of lysis buffer (100 m M K˙PO4(pH 7.8), 1 m M dithiothreitol) and broken by sonication. Luciferase activity was used as an internal control to normalize the plate to plate variation in transfection efficiency. Luciferase activity was assayed (19de Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2478) Google Scholar) using 30 μl of each supernatant in 370 μl of assay buffer (25 m M Gly-Gly (free base), 15 m M MgCl2, 5 m M ATP). 100 μl of luciferin (6 mg/ml) was added automatically, and activity was measured as relative light units for 10 s in a LB9501 Luminometer (Berthold Analytical Instruments, Nashua, NH). CAT assays (25Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5294) Google Scholar) were conducted by incubating cell extracts containing 20,000 relative light units of luciferase activity in 0.25 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 50 m M acetyl-CoA, 75 nCi [14C]chloramphenicol, 5 m M EDTA in 200 μl at 37°C for 2.5 h. The acetylation of chloramphenicol was analyzed by silica gel thin layer chromatography (25Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5294) Google Scholar) and quantitated with the AMBIS Radioanalytic Imaging System (AMBIS, San Diego, CA). CAT activity is expressed as percent chloramphenicol acetylated per 20,000 luciferase units (average of three to four independent experiments). When CAT activity was high, smaller aliquots were reassayed for shorter times to keep the reactions in the linear range, and the results were normalized to 2.5 h assays containing 20,000 relative light units of luciferase. The proximal promoter region does not contain either a TATA box or a CCAAT box (Fig. 1). It is very high in G + C content (73% in the first 200 bp upstream of the translation initiation codon and 61% in the 358 bp upstream region). This region has the characteristics of a CpG island (26Gardiner-Garden M. Frommer M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 261-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (2655) Google Scholar, 27Bird A.P. Nature. 1986; 321: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (3018) Google Scholar) : CpGs are found approximately as often as expected from the base composition, and CpGs are about equal in frequency to GpCs (18Hur M.-W. Edenberg H.J. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 121: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These are characteristics of the promoters of housekeeping genes. ADH5 is the only human alcohol dehydrogenase gene with these characteristics (28Edenberg H.J. Brown C.J. Pharmacogenetics. 1992; 2: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). There are consensus sequences for Sp1 (29Kadonaga J.T. Jones K.A. Tijan R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 20-24Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (878) Google Scholar, 30Courey A.J. Tjian R. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Plainview, NY1992: 743-769Google Scholar) and Sp1-related factors (31Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 32Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3663-3671Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) and for AP-2 (34Williams T. Admon A. Luscher B. Tjian R. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 1557-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) clustered around the transcription start point (Fig. 1); these factors create footprints in this region (see below). There are consensus sequences (35Locker J. Hames B.D. Higgins S.J. Gene Transcription: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1993: 321-345Google Scholar) for C/EBP and other CCAAT-binding proteins, and for HNF5, which might be involved in the higher expression of ADH5 in liver. Consensus sequences for other nuclear transcription factors, e.g. E-boxes, AP1, SRE, and XRE, are also found. It is interesting that there are five regions that contain groups of heat shock elements. Normally three or more clustered nGAAn sites are needed; the group of sites from −290 to −258 is the most likely of these to be functional. There are as yet no data about the induction of ADH5 by heat shock, but since the protein is protective against formaldehyde and other potential toxins, this might be physiologically relevant. We prepared a series of plasmids in which various portions of the ADH5 promoter were placed in front of the cat gene in the vector pCAT Basic (Fig. 2). We carried out transient expression assays in three different cell lines (H4IIE-C3, HeLa, and CV-1) to determine the extent to which each promoter fragment could direct transcription. In H4IIE-C3 cells, pCAT-X-1342 produced high levels of CAT activity, 42% of that obtained with the SV40 promoter plus enhancer construct pCAT Control (Fig. 3 A). Deletions extending down to bp −365 had little effect on CAT activity. The next three deletions each increased CAT activity: pCAT-X-163 showed 57% more CAT activity than pCAT-X-365, pCAT-X-127 showed 65% more activity than pCAT-163, and pCAT-X-64 showed 39% more activity than pCAT-X-127. pCAT-X-127 and pCAT-X-64 were more active than the SV40 promoter/enhancer combination in pCAT Control. Further deletion to −34 bp (pCAT-X-34) reduced activity 4-fold. This smallest promoter tested, pCAT-X-34, was nearly as active as the entire 1.4-kb fragment contained in pCAT-X-1342. pCAT-H-253, a derivative of pCAT-H-1342 in which the promoter is deleted from the 3′ end to bp −253 was not active (data not shown). In HeLa cells, pCAT-X-1342 produced high levels of CAT activity, 31% of that obtained with pCAT Control (Fig. 3 B). The effects of deletions differed from those seen in H4IIE-C3 cells. Deletion of the region between bp −1342 and −838 and between bp −583 and −465 reduced CAT activity by 15 and 25%, respectively. Deletion of the region between bp −365 and −163 increased activity 77%. Deletion of the region from bp −163 to −127 decreased activity 3-fold, and there was a 27% increase in activity upon further deletion to bp −64. pCAT-H-253 was not active (Fig. 3 B and data not shown). In CV-1 cells, as in the other cells tested, pCAT-X-1342 produced high levels of CAT activity, 44% of that obtained with pCAT Control (Fig. 3 C). The effects of the deletions differed from those seen in either H4IIE-C3 or HeLa cells. Deletions extending to bp −583 did not substantially affect the activity of the ADH5 promoter, and further deletions to bp −365 increased activity slightly. In CV-1, as in the other two cell lines, deletion of the region between bp −365 and −163 increased activity by 58%. Deletion of the region from bp −163 to −127 decreased activity 2-fold. Deletion to bp −64 increased activity by 55%, and further deletion to bp −34 decreased activity by 31%. pCAT-H-253 was not active (Fig. 3 C). Both pCAT-X-1342 and pCAT-H-1342 contain the same 1.4-kb promoter fragment, cloned into different positions in the polylinker of pCAT Basic (see “Experimental Procedures”). Both contain the two upstream ATGs that are found in the ADH5 gene itself (18Hur M.-W. Edenberg H.J. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 121: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), followed by in-frame (and also out of frame) termination codons, as they are in ADH5. pCAT-H-1342 has an additional 12 nucleotides (from the polylinker) inserted within the putative coding region of these upstream ATGs (Fig. 4). Both upstream ATGs are out of frame with the ATG of the cat gene, just as they are out of frame with the ATG of ADH5 (18Hur M.-W. Edenberg H.J. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 121: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In all three cell lines, pCAT-H-1342 directed from 1.6- to 2.3-fold more CAT activity than did pCAT-X-1342 (Fig. 4). Primer extension assays (18Hur M.-W. Edenberg H.J. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 121: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) showed two major transcription start sites (bp +1 and +3 in Fig. 1) and one minor transcription start site (at bp −82). The minor start site suggested that ADH5 might have a second promoter upstream. To investigate this, pCAT-AA was analyzed. pCAT-AA contains sequences from bp −726 to −61 bp, which includes the putative upstream transcription start site at bp −82 but not the major downstream sites at bp +1 and +3. pCAT-AA showed no promoter activity in any of the cell lines tested (Fig. 3). To identify the location of cis-acting elements in the proximal ADH5 promoter, we carried out DNase I footprinting assays (36Galas D.J. Schmitz A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 3157-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar) on fragments spanning the region from bp −401 to +61 relative to the major transcription start point of ADH5 (18Hur M.-W. Edenberg H.J. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 121: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Footprinting experiments were carried out using nuclear extracts prepared from the cell lines used for transfection studies and from various mouse tissues; we also examined the binding of purified transcription factors Sp1, AP-2, and TFIID. Extracts from mouse liver, kidney, and spleen showed footprints B, C, and D at bp +3 to +22, bp −38 to −4 and bp −57 to −40, respectively (Fig. 5, A and B). Liver showed a cluster of hypersensitive sites from bp +24 to +27 (Fig. 5 A). The pattern in mouse brain extract is more similar to that of the other cells when 20 μg of extract was used (data not shown; it did not footprint well in Fig. 5 A, lane 7, where only 10 μg of brain extract was used). Among these tissues, only kidney showed footprint A (bp +32 to +61), and only on one strand (Fig. 5, A versus B). Further upstream, additional DNase I footprints were detected (Fig. 5 C). There were differences among the cell lines. CV-1 showed a strong footprint J (bp −384 to −343) that was not seen with other extracts (Fig. 5 C). Footprint I (bp −318 to −284) just downstream of that is seen in liver extracts and also in CV-1 and H4IIE-C3 extracts. Fig. 7 summarizes the footprints. There are differences in the boundaries of the footprints, e.g. the footprint in the region from bp −57 to −40 is slightly shorter in brain and spleen than in liver and kidney (Fig. 5 A, lanes 7-10). Footprint F (bp −151 to −112) is seen in liver extract but not seen with the other tissue extracts; a slightly smaller footprint F (−151 to −118) is detected in CV-1 and H4IIE-C3 extracts but not in HeLa cells.FIG. 7Summary of DNase I footprints and their effects on gene expression. Boxes indicate footprints (see Fig. 5); solid boxes are footprints seen in liver; stippled boxes A and J are seen in other tissues. The arrows beneath reflect the regions tested in successive deletion mutants (Fig. 3); their effects on CAT activity are represented as + for positive, 0 for no effect, and - for negative effect.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Nuclear extracts prepared from H4IIE-C3, HeLa, and CV-1 produced two strong footprints, B and C, immediately flanking the transcription start point (Fig. 5, A lanes 4-6, and B, lanes 3-5). There are hypersensitive sites right around the transcription start site (+1) in all tissues except brain. There are two weaker footprints flanking B and C: D from bp −57 to −40 and A from bp +32 to +61 (Fig. 5, A and B). The HeLa extracts produced the strongest footprints B and C and looked most like the pattern seen with purified Sp1 (see below). Both H4IIE-C3 and CV-1 produced several footprints upstream of bp −60, whereas HeLa cells did not. As was seen for different tissues, the patterns of protection differ slightly among the extracts from different cells (Fig. 5). Footprint J was seen in CV-1 cells. Given the high G + C content and presence of Sp1 consensus sequences, we tested the binding of Sp1 and AP-2 to this region of the ADH5 promoter. Sp1 produced four footprints; two strong footprints, B and C, correspond to footprints seen in the cell extracts. To further test whether Sp1 was the protein responsible for the footprinting of sites B and C, gel mobility shift assays were carried out using antibodies to Sp1. Fig. 6 A shows that purified Sp1 can bind to site B (lane 8) but not to a mutated site B (lane 12). Antibody to Sp1 shifts the retarded band to lower mobility. The protein(s) in the HeLa extract also bind specifically to site B, as shown in lane 4, and most of the retarded band is shifted to lower mobility by the antibody to Sp1, indicating that Sp1 is indeed the major protein binding to the site. The small residue of unshifted band might be due to insufficient antibody or to the presence of a second protein able to bind to the oligonucleotide. The mobility of the shifted band in the HeLa extract is slightly greater than that due to purified Sp1; this might be due to post-translational modifications in the protein, since the Sp1 gene product can produce bands with mobilities approximating 95 and 105 kDa. Fig. 6 B shows that the predominant protein that binds to site C is also Sp1; again a fraction of the band does not shift with antibody, and again the mobility of the shifted band in the HeLa extract is slightly greater than that due to purified Sp1, but similar to that which binds to site B. These data demonstrate that the bulk of the protein binding to sites B and C in the HeLa extract is Sp1. The pattern of AP-2 binding differs from that seen in any of the cell lines. AP-2 protects both strands at site A; this differs from the footprinting on only one strand seen in the cell extracts. AP-2 also produces weak footprints in sites extending from bp −66 to +27, partially overlapping footprints produced by various extracts and Sp-1. TFIID did not produce detectable footprints under our conditions. The human ADH5 gene has characteristics of both a housekeeping gene and a tissue-specific gene. It is expressed in all tissues and in all stages of development, but at higher levels in liver and kidney. The data presented here demonstrate that although the proximal promoter of ADH5 has some characteristics of a housekeeping gene, particularly a G + C-rich and TATA-less promoter, it also contains several tissue-specific cis-acting elements that affect expression differently in different cellular contexts. A small region between bp −34 and +61 (contained in pCAT-X-34) has surprisingly strong promoter activity in all three cell lines tested. Its activity in these cells ranges from 18 to 46% of the activity of the SV40 promoter + enhancer combination. This small region contains two Sp1 sites flanking the major transcription start site (sites B and C) that were footprinted by all nuclear extracts (Fig. 5). These two sites are bound strongly by purified Sp1 protein. The protein in HeLa extract that binds to these sites is Sp1, as shown by antibody double-gel shifts (Fig. 6). In the absence of a TATA box, Sp1 bound to this unusual arrangement of sites might directly stimulate transcription by actively recruiting the TFIID complex to the promoter (37Pugh B.F. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 61: 1187-1197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 38Pugh B.F. Tjian R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 679-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tazi and Bird (39Tazi J. Bird A. Cell. 1990; 60: 909-920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) showed that the G + C-rich promoters of housekeeping genes are depleted of histones and actively transcribed. Croston et al. (40Croston G.E. Kerrigan L.A. Lira L.M. Marshak D.R. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 1991; 251: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) suggested that Sp1 can act as an antirepressor by actively displacing histone. Sp1 or related factors might also displace histones from the ADH5 promoter region. Sp1 is expressed in all tissues, but the mRNA level can vary as much as 100-fold (30Courey A.J. Tjian R.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3663-3671Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) may be important in the widespread expression of χ-ADH. Upstream of this minimal promoter, there are cell- and tissue-specific differences in both the binding of transcription factors and the effects of the cis-acting sequences on gene expression (Fig. 7). For example, the region containing site D had different effects in different cells. Site D was footprinted by all nuclear extracts and strongly by Sp1 (Fig. 5, A and B). Its effect on promoter function, however, differed. In H4IIE-C3 cells, it was a strong positive regulatory element, stimulating CAT expression 5-fold (cf. pCAT-X-64 and pCAT-X-34, Fig. 3 A). pCAT-X-64 was a better promoter in the hepatoma cells than the SV40 promoter and enhancer (by 1.5-fold). In CV-1 cells, this sequence was a weak positive element that increased CAT expression by 45% (Fig. 3 C). In contrast, the same sequence did not have any effect in HeLa cells (Fig. 3 B). Thus the differential expression of Sp1 (30Courey A.J. Tjian R. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Plainview, NY1992: 743-769Google Scholar, 41Saffer J.D. Jackson S.P. Annarella M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) and/or related proteins may be important in the differential expression of this promoter. The region from bp −163 to −128 is another cell-specific element; it acts as positive element in CV-1 and HeLa cells, causing the 2-2.8-fold higher CAT expression of pCAT-X-163 compared with pCAT-X-127 (Fig. 3, B and C). Surprisingly, this region down-regulated gene expression in H4IIE-C3 cells by 39% (Fig. 3 A). Thus the sequences between bp −163 and −128 bp can act as either a positive or negative regulatory element in different cellular contexts. The cell-specific function of this element suggests that it is bound by different transcription factors in different cells or that the factor(s) bound interact differently with other tissue-specific factors also bound to the promoter. We observed a footprint in the region from bp -to −130 bp in CV-1 and H4IIE-C3 extracts and a larger footprint from bp −151 to −112 in liver extracts (Fig. 5 C). This region contains a consensus sequence for C/EBP or other CAAT-binding proteins (35Locker J. Hames B.D. Higgins S.J. Gene Transcription: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1993: 321-345Google Scholar). The region from bp −127 to −65 acted as a weak negative element in all three cell lines tested, as evidenced by the lower expression of pCAT-X-127 relative to pCAT-X-64 (Fig. 3). A reduction in CAT activity by 21, 28, and 36% was seen in HeLa, H4IIE-C3, and CV-1 cells, respectively. A very weak footprint was observed in region from bp −100 to −61 only with CV-1 nuclear extract (Fig. 5 C). The region between bp −163 and −365 reduced CAT activity to the level of pCAT-X-34 in all three cell lines tested (Fig. 3). This region contains several footprinted sequences (Figs. 5 and 7). Regions further upstream did not substantially change promoter activity in H4IIE-C3 or CV-1 cells (Fig. 3, A and C), but in HeLa cells there was a modest stimulation by sequences located between bp −464 to −583 and between bp −837 to −1342 (Fig. 3 B). The 5′ non-translated region of ADH5 is unusual in having two upstream ATGs. pCAT-X-1342 and pCAT-H-1342 have the same 1.4 kb ADH5 upstream sequence inserted at different sites in the polylinker of pCAT Basic. This introduces an extra 12 bp in front of the CAT coding sequence in pCAT-H-1342, relative to pCAT-X-1342 (Fig. 4A). pCAT-H-1342 produced a 1.6-2.3-fold higher CAT activity than pCAT-X-1342 in all cell lines tested (Fig. 4 B). The higher CAT activity in pCAT-H-1342 may be due to the slightly longer upstream coding sequences (4 amino acids longer) in pCAT-H-1342, which may affect the translocation and reinitiation of ribosomes (43Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, the enhancement may be the result of an alteration in the secondary structure of the 5′-nontranslated region. We thank Ronald E. Jerome for excellent technical assistance with tissue culture, Lu Zhang and Jinghua Zhao for assistance with the antibody shift experiments, and Dr. Celeste Brown, Dr. Mang Yu, and Lu Zhang for their helpful advice."

In this cell line, alkaline phosphatase mRNA was not constitutively expressed but was progressively induced by treatment with 1 μM retinoic acid, detectable by 6 h. Combining retinoic acid with 0.6 n M TNF α resulted in alkaline phosphatase mRNA appearing by 2 h, as well as enhanced expression above that observed with retinoic acid alone at 6, 12, and 24 h. Nuclear run-on analysis showed constitutive transcription of the alkaline phosphatase gene in control and TNF α-treated cells. At 4 h, retinoic acid, alone or combined with TNF α, increased alkaline phosphatase gene transcriptional rate by 2-fold. However, at 24 h, while no retinoic acid effect was retained, retinoic acid plus TNF α resulted in a 5-fold increase in alkaline phosphatase transcriptional rate. Examination of the distribution of nuclear alkaline phosphatase mRNA demonstrated that pre-spliced precursor mRNA was localized to the nuclear matrix in control and all treatment groups. Retinoic acid caused a time-dependent accumulation of mature, spliced alkaline phosphatase mRNA located in the non-matrix and cytoplasmic fractions, implying a post-transcriptional action of retinoic acid in nuclear processing and nucleocytoplasmic transport. Adding TNF α with retinoic acid greatly enhanced this effect, which was observed after 4 h, prior to any detectable interaction between TNF α and retinoic acid on gene transcription. In sharp contrast, only a negligible amount of nuclear processing occurred in control and TNF α-treated cells. This study reveals distinct interactions between TNF α and retinoic acid at post-transcriptional as well as transcriptional levels to regulate expression of the alkaline phosphatase gene in preosteoblasts.

The actions of TNF α are mediated by specific cell surface receptors present on virtually all cells examined. Binding of TNF α followed by internalizaton of the cytokine-receptor complex results in the activation of multiple signal transduction pathways, transcription factors, and regulation of transcription of a wide array of genes (for reviews, see Refs. 1Fiers W.

Cytokines characteristically possess multiple functions with considerable overlap in their biological actions (5Green A.R. Lancet. 1989; 1: 705-707Abstract PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). There are many examples of interaction between TNF α and other cytokines. For instance, many of its functions are synergistic with interleukin 1. Together, they have pivotal roles in immune and inflammatory responses, mediating host reactions to stimuli as diverse as infections and tumor growth. Some of the mechanisms of cytokine interaction have been studied in detail. Thus, it has been shown that the induction of interleukin 6 by TNF α or interleukin 1 required the participation of at least three different cis-acting elements in the promoter region of the interleukin 6 gene, which, in turn, came about through the activation of more than one signaling pathway or transcription factor (6Ray A. Sassone-Corsi P. Sehgal P.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5537-5547Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 7Akira S. Isshiki H. Sugita T. Tanabe O. Kinoshita S. Nishio Y. Nakajima T. Hirano T.

TNF α also cooperates with systemic factors such as 1,25(OH)2-dihydroxyvitamin D3or retinoic acid to induce the differentiation of human leukemia-derived myeloid cell lines (9Trinchieri G. Rosen M. Perussia B. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 2236-2242PubMed Google Scholar, 10Trinchieri G. Rosen M. Perussia B. Blood. 1987; 69: 1218-1224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the manner in which these interactions occur remains largely unexplored. We have previously reported that TNF α potentiated retinoic acid-induced increase in alkaline phosphatase activity in a rat clonal pre-osteoblastic cell line, UMR 201 (11Ng K.W. Hudson P.J. Power B.E. Manji S.S. Gummer P.R. Martin T.J. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Other investigators have also shown that osteoblasts are targeted by TNF α. For instance, treatment with TNF α decreased collagen synthesis in fetal rat calvariae (12Bertolini D.R. Nedwin G.E. Bringman T.S. Smith D.D. Mundy G.R. Nature. 1986; 319: 516-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar) and stimulated proliferation in human osteosarcoma as well as trabecular bone cells (13Sugarman B.J. Aggarwal B.B. Hass P.E.

Arthritis Rheum. 1988; 31: 1500-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). TNF α has also been shown to stimulate osteoclastic bone resorption in organ culture (12Bertolini D.R. Nedwin G.E. Bringman T.S. Smith D.D. Mundy G.R. Nature. 1986; 319: 516-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar), possibly by stimulating the proliferation of marrow mononuclear cells and enhancing the differentiation of committed osteoclast progenitors (15Pfeilschifter J. Mundy G.R. Roodman G.D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1989; 4: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The effects of TNF α on mature osteoclasts in vitro are likely to be indirect, requiring the mediation of cytokines secreted by co-cultured osteoblasts (16Thomson B.M. Mundy G.R. Chambers T.J. J.

The object of this study was to examine in detail the manner in which TNF α interacted with retinoic acid in the expression of the alkaline phosphatase gene at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. We have recently identified an important mechanism of action of retinoic acid whereby the steady state mRNA levels of alkaline phosphatase were increased primarily by enhancement of nuclear processing rather than by an increase in gene transcription (20Zhou H. Manji S.S. Findlay D.M. Martin T.J. Heath J.K. Ng K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22433-22439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present results show that TNF α regulates alkaline phosphatase gene expression by facilitating the actions of retinoic acid at post-transcriptional as well as transcriptional levels. α-Modified minimum essential medium (α-MEM) was purchased from Flow Laboratories Australia, Pty Ltd. (Mt. Waverley, Victoria, Australia). Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was a product from Grand Island Biological Co. Laboratories (Melbourne, Victoria, Australia). [α-32P]dCTP, [α-32P]UTP, and [γ-32P]ATP were purchased from Amersham, Australia, Pty. (Sydney, New South Wales, Australia). All- trans retinoic acid (retinoic acid) was purchased from Sigma. Dr. M. Young (NIDR, National Insitutes of Health) provided the cDNA for chicken actin. Dr G. Rodan (Merck Sharpe and Dohme) provided the cDNA for rat alkaline phosphatase (21Thiede M.A. Yoon K. Golub E.E.

Hammonds, Jr. (Genentech Inc., San Francisco). Nuclease S1 and RNase-free DNase I were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim GmbH (Mannheim, Germany). All other reagents were of analytical grade obtained from standard suppliers. UMR 201 cells were routinely grown in α-MEM containing 10% FBS (11Ng K.W. Hudson P.J. Power B.E. Manji S.S. Gummer P.R. Martin T.J. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Incubation was carried out at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere equilibrated with 5% CO2in air. Total RNA was isolated with guanidine thiocyanate (23Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63139) Google Scholar), separated in a 1.5% agarose-formaldehyde gel, and transferred to nylon filters (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Filters (Hybond-N, Amersham, UK) were hybridized overnight in SSPE buffer (1 × SSPE = 150 m M NaCl, 10 m M NaH2P04H20, 1 m M sodium EDTA, pH 7.4) as previously described (20Zhou H. Manji S.S. Findlay D.M. Martin T.J. Heath J.K. Ng K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22433-22439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). cDNA probes were nick-translated with [α-32P]dCTP to a specific activity of 1 × 109dpm/μg of DNA (Boehringer Mannheim). The filters were washed sequentially in 2 × SSPE with 0.1% SDS at 42°C for 15 min, 1 × SSPE with 0.1% SDS at 65°C for 30 min, and finally 0.1 × SSPE with 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 15 min. Specifically bound probe was visualized by autoradiography and quantified by densitometry at appropriate exposures (Molecular Dynamics, model 300A). Relative mRNA levels were normalized for loading variability by comparison with actin mRNA levels in the same filters. Transcriptional rates of alkaline phosphatase and actin genes were determined by nuclear run-on analysis as previously described (25Zhou H. Hammonds Jr., R.G. Findlay D.M. Martin T.J. Ng K.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 155: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). UMR 201 cells were grown in 500 cm2trays in α-MEM containing 10% FBS until 80% confluent before the medium was changed to α-MEM containing 2% vitamin A-deficient FBS, and treatment commenced with 1 μM retinoic acid, 0.6 n M TNF α, or 1 μM retinoic acid together with 0.6 n M TNF α for 4 and 24 h, respectively. The cDNA for alkaline phosphatase (10 μg) and actin (5 μg) were denatured and immobilized on nitrocellulose (Hybond-C, Amersham, UK). Quantitation was carried out by densitometry of submaximal signals and normalized with reference to the actin signal on the same filter. Subcellular fractions of UMR 201 cells, consisting of nuclear matrix with which precursor mRNA is almost exclusively associated, pooled DNase I/salt eluate enriched in mature mRNA, nuclear membrane, and cytoplasm were obtained as previously described (20Zhou H.

EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2329-2336Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). UMR 201 cells were grown in 500-cm2trays in α-MEM containing 10% FBS until 80% confluent before treatment with 1 μM retinoic acid, 0.6 n M TNF α, or 1 μM retinoic acid together with 0.6 n M TNFα in α-MEM containing 2% vitamin A-deficient FBS for the indicated incubation times. Total RNA from the subfractions was prepared using the method described by Gough (27Gough N.M. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 173: 93-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Supernatant from the various RNA-containing subfractions was added to 4 ml of protein-denaturing buffer containing 7 M urea, 350 m M NaCl, 10 m M EDTA, 1% SDS, and 10 m M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. RNA was extracted by adding 8 ml of phenol/chloroform/isoamylalcohol (50:50:1) and precipitated with 8 ml of isopropanol. The RNA pellet was washed once with 70% ethanol and resuspended in TE buffer (10 m M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 m M EDTA, pH 8.0) at a concentration of 2 μg/μl. For Northern blot analysis, total RNA was separated in a 1.5% agarose-formaldehyde gel as described above. Equal loading was confirmed by staining the gels with ethidium bromide. S1 nuclease protection assay was performed as previously described (20Zhou H. Manji S.S. Findlay D.M. Martin T.J. Heath J.K. Ng K.W. J. Biol.

A 27-nucleotide (5′-CAATATAGCTGCCACATGCCTGCTCAC-3′) complementary to the start of the second intron of the rat liver alkaline phosphatase gene (30Toh Y. Yamamoto M. Endo H. Misumi Y. Ikehara Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP at the 5′-end. 50,000 cpm of the labeled nucleotide was hybridized to 20 μg of total RNA from each of the subcellular fractions obtained as described above. The protected DNA-RNA hybrid was extracted with phenol-chloroform, ethanol precipitated, and electrophoresed on a 20% acrylamide gel containing 8 M urea; the dried gel was then subjected to autoradiography. First strand cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA by incubating for 1 h at 42°C with 15 units of AMV reverse transcriptase (Promega) following oligo(dT) priming. 2 μl of this reaction mixture was submitted to PCR to amplify the region of the rat alkaline phosphatase gene transcript across exons 4 and 5 to include intron 4 (see Fig. 5 A). Primers were a 5′-primer (5′-AGAAAGAGAAAGACCCCAGTT-3′) representing nucleotides 1-21 of exon 4 and a 3′-primer (5′-CTTGGAGAGAGCCACAAAGG-3′) representing nucleotides 97-116 of exon 5 (30Toh Y. Yamamoto M. Endo H. Misumi Y. Ikehara Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). 20 cycles of amplification were sufficient to yield a PCR product corresponding to spliced mRNA, whereas 30 cycles of amplification were required to demonstrate product corresponding to intron-containing (unspliced) mRNA. Amplification using Taq DNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) with an annealing temperature of 55°C was employed in a Perkin-Elmer Corp. 480 thermal cycler. 20 μl of each PCR reaction mixture was run on a 2% agarose gel and transferred to nylon; products were authenticated by probing with a mixture of 3 digoxigenin-labeled oligonucleotides corresponding to sequences within exons 4 and 5 as well as in intron 4 (see Fig. 5A). Oligonucleotides were labeled with digoxigenin-dUTP using a 3′-tailing kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Hybridization was carried out with 2 pmol/ml labeled oligonucleotide in a buffer containing 5 × SSC, 0.02% SDS, 0.1% sarcosine, and 100 μg/ml poly(A) at 55°C for 14 h. Detection was by chemiluminescence using Lumigen PPD (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Products of the expected sizes were obtained, viz. 636 bp for unspliced and 236 bp for spliced species. To ensure equal starting quantities of RNA in each sample, the reverse-transcribed material was also amplified using oligonucleotide primers specific for rat GAPDH (31Tso T.Y. Sun X.-H. Kao T.-H. Reece K.S. Wu R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 2485-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1759) Google Scholar). A 414-bp fragment was amplified using as 5′-specific olignucleotide, GAPDH-4 (5′-CATGGAGAAGGCTGGGGCTC-3′, representing nucleotides 306-325 of rat GAPDH) and 3′-specific oligonucleotide, GAPDH-5 (5′-AACGGATACATTGGGGGTAG-3′, representing nucleotides 701-720). Products were verified with a digoxigenin-labeled internal sense strand oligonucleotide, GAPDH-1 (5′-GCTGTGGGCAAGGTCATCCC-3′, representing nucleotides 640-659) using the hybridization conditions described above. We have previously reported that alkaline phosphatase activity was highly induced in UMR 201 cells by retinoic acid with a peak effect observed at 1 μM (32Ng K.W. Gummer P.R. Michelangeli V.P. Bateman J.F. Mascara T. Cole W.G. Martin T.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1988; 3: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Although TNF α was without effect in inducing alkaline phosphatase activity, retinoic acid-induced alkaline phosphatase activity was greatly enhanced when UMR 201 cells were treated with TNF α and retinoic acid together. This effect was dose dependent with respect to TNF α, plateauing after 0.06 n M (33Ng K.W. Manji S.S. Young M.F. Findlay D.M. Mol.

In the present study, UMR 201 cells were treated with a maximal concentration of 0.6 n M TNF α, 1 μM retinoic acid, or retinoic acid together with TNF α. Total RNA prepared from the cells after treatment for 2, 6, 12, or 24 h, respectively, was separated in a 1.5% formaldehyde-agarose gel, transferred to nylon filters, and probed for alkaline phosphatase mRNA in a Northern blot analysis. The results show that retinoic acid progressively stimulated the expression of alkaline phosphatase mRNA, detectable by 6 h (Fig. 1). Combined treatment with retinoic acid and TNF α resulted in much earlier expression of alkaline phosphatase mRNA, now detectable at 2 h. In addition, an increase in the steady state level of alkaline phosphatase mRNA, above that obtained with retinoic acid treatment alone, was observed at all other time points. mRNA for alkaline phosphatase was not expressed in control (untreated) UMR 201 cells, and TNF α alone had no effect on alkaline phosphatase mRNA expression. These results correlate very well with our previous report on the action of TNF α and retinoic acid on alkaline phosphatase enzymatic activity in these cells (33Ng K.W. Manji S.S. Young M.F. Findlay D.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 2079-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To achieve a clearer understanding of the mechanisms of action of TNF α and the manner in which it interacts with retinoic acid, the individual and combined effects of these factors on the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of expression of the alkaline phosphatase gene were examined. Transcription of the alkaline phosphatase gene was examined by nuclear run-on analysis after UMR 201 cells were treated, as described above, for 4 or 24 h, respectively (Fig. 2). The first time point of 4 h was chosen to precede the earliest detectable increase in alkaline phosphatase mRNA induced by retinoic acid (6 h, Fig. 1). The alkaline phosphatase gene was found to be constitutively transcribed by untreated (control) UMR 201 cells and those treated with TNF α alone, despite the absence of detectable alkaline phosphatase mRNA (Fig. 1). After 4 h, there was a small, approximately 2-fold increase in the transcriptional rate of the alkaline phosphatase gene in cells treated with 1 μM retinoic acid alone. There was also an increase in the rate of transcription in cells treated with retinoic acid and 0.6 n M TNF α but only to a similar extent as that induced by retinoic acid alone. After treatment for 24 h, the significant feature was the striking 5-fold increase in the rate of transcription of the alkaline phosphatase gene in cells treated with retinoic acid and TNF α (Fig. 2, bottom row). The earlier effect of retinoic acid alone in stimulating alkaline phosphatase gene transcription was transient and no longer observed at 24 h, as previously reported (20Zhou H. Manji S.S. Findlay D.M. Martin T.J. Heath J.K. Ng K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22433-22439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Clearly, there is a discrepancy between the small increase in transcriptional rate of the alkaline phosphatase gene, as well as the time course of those increases in response to the various treatments, and the observed changes in the steady state levels of the alkaline phosphatase mRNA in the Northern blot analysis shown in Fig. 1. To examine post-transcriptional events, therefore, UMR 201 cells were subfractionated to isolate the nuclear matrix, DNase I/salt eluate, nuclear membrane, and cytoplasmic fractions. The extent of nuclear processing is indicated by the relative distribution of precursor and mature alkaline phosphatase mRNA between the subnuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. UMR 201 cells were treated for 4, 12, and 24 h with 0.6 n M TNF α, 1 μM retinoic acid, or TNF α combined with retinoic acid, respectively, and compared with untreated cells. The cells were subfractionated, and total RNA from the various fractions was analyzed in two ways. First, to detect pre-spliced precursor mRNA, solution hybridization to a 27-nucleotide oligomer, complementary to the start of the second intron of the rat alkaline phosphatase gene, was carried out before S1 nuclease digestion of single-stranded nucleic acid was performed (Fig. 3). The protected DNA-RNA hybrid was only detected in the nuclear matrix fraction of control and treated cells, confirming that precursor alkaline phosphatase mRNA was present specifically in that fraction. Although the band in the nuclear matrix fraction of control cells was only faintly visible, it was consistently present in repeated experiments. Fig. 3 shows the results from an experiment where cells were treated for 4 h, but similar results were obtained after 24 h (data not shown). The second analysis was designed to determine whether the precursor mRNA was being processed into mature mRNA, which can be translocated from the nucleus into the cytoplasm. Total RNA from the various subcellular fractions was separated in a 1.5% formaldehyde-agarose gel, transferred to nylon filters, and probed with a 2.4-kilobase full-length cDNA encoding rat alkaline phosphatase (Fig. 4). In contrast to the results obtained in Fig. 3, there was only a minute amount of mature, spliced alkaline phosphatase mRNA in the nuclear membrane fraction of control and TNF α-treated cells, despite the presence of precursor mRNA in the nuclear matrix fraction. On the other hand, retinoic acid treatment resulted in the accumulation of mature alkaline phosphatase mRNA mainly within the non-matrix and cytoplasmic fractions, as previously reported (20Zhou H. Manji S.S. Findlay D.M. Martin T.J. Heath J.K. Ng K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22433-22439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the cells were treated with the combination of TNF α and retinoic acid, not only was there a considerable increase in the amount of mature alkaline phosphatase mRNA located in the subcellular fractions, but it occurred to such an extent that it was present even in the nuclear matrix fraction. This enhancement of nuclear processing of alkaline phosphatase mRNA transcripts with the combined treatment was evident at all time points, beginning at 4 h. This early time point clearly preceded the effect of the combined treatment on increasing the rate of alkaline phosphatase gene transcription beyond that induced by retinoic acid treatment alone (Fig. 2). Importantly, TNF α alone did not have any notable influence on nuclear processing. Although we have previously reported that co-treatment with cycloheximide significantly inhibited the effect of retinoic acid on nuclear processing (20Zhou H. Manji S.S. Findlay D.M. Martin T.J. Heath J.K. Ng K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22433-22439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a similar experiment could not be performed in this study because the combination of cycloheximide and TNF α was toxic to the cells. To verify these results and at the same time to seek evidence of elongation of the nascent transcript, we employed reverse transcriptase-PCR to amplify a sequence corresponding to intron 4 of the alkaline phosphatase gene, using primers complementary to exons 4 and 5 (see Fig. 5 A). UMR 201 cells were subfractionated after treatment with TNF α, retinoic acid, or TNF α combined with retinoic acid for 8 h. Consistent with the S1 nuclease results, a 636-base pair amplified product corresponding to RNA containing intron 4 was present in the nuclear matrix fractions only of control and treated cells (Fig. 5 B). In addition, a 236-base pair product corresponding to spliced mRNA was seen in cells treated with retinoic acid alone or when combined with TNF α. There was clearly a much greater abundance of spliced alkaline phosphatase mRNA in all of the subcellular fractions in response to the combined treatment (Fig. 5 B). DNase treatment during the nuclear fractionation procedure ensured that this product did not result from contaminating genomic DNA. We have used a non-transformed clonal rat cell line, UMR 201, with features characteristic of pre-osteoblasts in our studies of osteoblast differentiation. Retinoic acid significantly stimulates the expression of mRNA for alkaline phosphatase, osteopontin, osteonectin, matrix Gla protein, and type I collagen in these cells (22Zhou H. Hammonds Jr., R.G.

Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 2079-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that retinoic acid and TNF α acted in concert to control the level of alkaline phosphatase mRNA in UMR 201 cells (11Ng K.W. Hudson P.J. Power B.E. Manji S.S. Gummer P.R. Martin T.J. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The present results advance our understanding of this interaction. TNF α itself had no effect on the transcriptional rate of the alkaline phosphatase gene. When combined with retinoic acid, there was a significant increase in transcriptional rate of this gene over and above the increase caused by retinoic acid alone, but this was clearly evident only when the cells had been treated for 24 h. The Northern blot analysis, however, showed that the increase in steady state level of alkaline phosphatase mRNA induced by the combination of TNF α and retinoic acid was demonstrable after treatment for only 2 h, which significantly preceded the induction of alkaline phosphatase mRNA by retinoic acid treatment alone. These results point to the need to consider a potential role for post-transcriptional regulatory events in determining the steady state level of cytoplasmic alkaline phosphatase mRNA. The alkaline phosphatase gene is constitutively transcribed in control and TNF α-treated UMR 201 cells, and this was verified by the demonstration of precursor alkaline phosphatase mRNA in the nuclear matrix fraction of all treatment groups using the sensitive S1 nuclease protection assay as well as reverse transcriptase-PCR. The detection of only minute amounts of mature alkaline phosphatase mRNA in the nuclear membrane fraction of control and TNF α-treated cells testifies to the inefficiency of nuclear processing in cells grown under those conditions. It further implies that newly transcribed precursor alkaline phosphatase mRNA must be rapidly degraded within the nuclear matrix fraction. We have previously described a novel action of retinoic acid, in that it greatly increases the proficiency of nuclear processing of newly transcribed alkaline phosphatase mRNA, enabling the accumulation of mature mRNA in the non-matrix nuclear fractions prior to translocation into the cytoplasm (20Zhou H. Manji S.S. Findlay D.M. Martin T.J. Heath J.K. Ng K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22433-22439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of action of retinoic acid in enhancing nuclear processing is unclear. Factors that will need to be considered include the role of RNA binding proteins and their participation in regulation of the splicing mechanism, stability of native and spliced RNA transcripts, as well as translocation of the spliced product from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. In contrast to our findings, another group has shown that in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, retinoic acid induced interleukin-1α and interleukin-1β precursor mRNA, but these were not processed into mature mRNA, requiring treatment with cycloheximide to facilitate nuclear processing (34Jarrous N. Kaempfer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23141-23149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These recent findings may imply that the effect of retinoic acid on nuclear processing might be cell-type and/or gene specific. An additional implication of those results is that retinoic acid requires collaboration with additional cofactor(s) to direct or enable intranuclear processing of transcripts. In the present case, TNF α serves as one such cofactor to greatly enhance the retinoic acid-induced nuclear processing. Although TNF α alone appeared not to influence either the transcription of the alkaline phosphatase gene or the nuclear processing of the mRNA, it significantly enhanced the post-transcriptional actions of retinoic acid early in the course of the interaction and, later on, also with the transcriptional events. Although it must still be suggested that the enhancement of retinoic acid-induced nuclear processing by TNF α may be a consequence of the greatly increased transcriptional rate of the alkaline phosphatase gene induced by the combined treatment, the considerable delay before this became evident is not consistent with this possibility. A locally secreted cytokine such as TNF α or transforming growth factor β, acting as an autocrine or paracrine regulator of cell function, is ideally located to modulate the effects of systemic agents. It is interesting to note that the mechanisms of action of TNF α in the regulation of alkaline phosphatase gene expression shown in this study contrasted significantly with that of transforming growth factor β (20Zhou H. Manji S.S. Findlay D.M. Martin T.J. Heath J.K. Ng K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22433-22439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike TNF α, transforming growth factor β increased the transcriptional rate of alkaline phosphatase gene, but that action was not accompanied by increased nuclear processing of precursor mRNA. In conclusion, this study has revealed that TNF α interacts with retinoic acid at post-transcriptional as well as transcriptional levels to regulate alkaline phosphatase gene expression. Since alkaline phosphatase expression is a marker of differentiation in osteoblasts, the enhancement of retinoic acid action by TNF α suggests that this cytokine may further promote the differentiation of preosteoblastic UMR 201 cells. Furthermore, this system will be an excellent model in which to study the mechanisms involved."

Eco SSB exists as a stable homotetramer over a wide range of protein concentrations and solution conditions, and it is this tetrameric form of Eco SSB that binds to single-stranded DNA (Lohman and Ferrari, 1994Lohman T.M.

Ferrari M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 527-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), which differ in the number of nucleotides occluded by a single Eco SSB tetramer. These binding modes are referred to as the binding size (SSB)n, where n indicates the average number of nucleotides bound by the Eco SSB tetramer in that mode. Variation in early estimates of the binding site sizes (Krauss et al., 1981Krauss G. Sindermann H. Schomburg U. Maass G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 5346-5352Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar; Weiner et al., 1975Weiner J.H. Bertsch L.L. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1972-1980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was explained by a series of experiments showing that the different complexes of Eco SSB and ssDNA which form depend on the salt concentrations, cation and anion valence or type, temperature, pH (Lohman and Overman, 1985Lohman T.M. Overman L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3594-3603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Bujalowski et al., 1988Bujalowski W. Overman L.B. Lohman T.M. J. Biol.

Lohman and co-workers showed that by increasing the ionic strength of the medium, the Eco SSB tetramer can form three distinct binding modes in complexes with poly(dT) at 25°C, pH 8.1, where n = 35, 56, or 65 (Lohman and Overman, 1985Lohman T.M. Overman L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3594-3603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and one additional binding mode of n = 42 at 37°C (Bujalowski and Lohman, 1986Bujalowski W. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7799-7802Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Although complexes with native ssDNA appear to undergo the same salt-dependent size transitions, reported values of n have been larger than those for poly(dT) (Lohman and Overman, 1985Lohman T.M. Overman L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3594-3603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Morrical and Cox, 1990Morrical S.W. Cox M.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 837-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These larger values may be due to stabilization of secondary structures in the native ssDNA as salt levels are raised, excluding protein from these regions.Comparison of the physical properties of the three Eco SSB binding modes shows substantial differences. Eco SSB can exhibit a very high cooperativity when mixed with DNA at the low concentration of NaCl required to form the (SSB)35binding mode. In this low salt mode, ssDNA interacts with only two subunits of the Eco SSB and seems to form unlimited clusters (Lohman and Ferrari, 1994Lohman T.M. Ferrari M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 527-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). This may be the binding mode of smooth contoured complexes visualized in the electron microscope, where approximately 60% compaction of M13 occurs (Griffith et al., 1984Griffith J.D. Harris L.D. Register III, J. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1984; 49: 553-559Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Bujalowski and Lohman, 1986Bujalowski W. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7799-7802Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). However, (SSB)35exhibits a transient or “metastable” unlimited cooperativity, which is not a property of the binding mode at equilibrium (Lohman et al., 1986bLohman T.M. Overman L.B. Datta S. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 603-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In both the (SSB)56and (SSB)65modes, all four subunits of the Eco SSB tetramer interact with ssDNA (Lohman and Ferrari, 1994Lohman T.M. Ferrari M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 527-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), and it is thought that these forms produce the beaded SSB-ssDNA morphology observed in the electron microscope. Conditions that favor formation of both the (SSB)56and the (SSB)65binding modes are associated with approximately 80% compaction of M13 DNA (Griffith et al., 1984Griffith J.D. Harris L.D. Register III, J. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1984; 49: 553-559Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Lohman and Bujalowski, 1990Lohman T.M. Bujalowski W. Revzin A. The Biology of Nonspecific DNA- Protein Interactions. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1990: 131-168Google Scholar).Because of the multiple roles that Eco SSB plays in the life cycle of E. coli, it has been suggested that the different properties of the SSB binding modes might allow it to selectively participate in this wide range of processes (Lohman et al., 1986bLohman T.M. Overman L.B. Datta S. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 603-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 1988; Lohman and Bujalowski, 1990Lohman T.M. Bujalowski W. Revzin A. The Biology of Nonspecific DNA- Protein Interactions. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1990: 131-168Google Scholar). Studies to support this suggestion have been limited to the effect of Eco SSB binding modes on the activities of E. coli RecA protein and these have shown that the (SSB)35mode selectively inhibits reactions of this protein (Griffith et al., 1984Griffith J.D. Harris L.D. Register III, J. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1984; 49: 553-559Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Morrical and Cox, 1990Morrical S.W. Cox M.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 837-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar; Muniyappa et al., 1990Muniyappa K. Williams K. Chase J.W. Radding C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3967-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The fact that (SSB)35displays unlimited cooperative binding has been used as evidence to support the suggestion that this mode might be present at the replication fork since this form can completely coat the ssDNA (Lohman and Bujalowski, 1990Lohman T.M. Bujalowski W. Revzin A. The Biology of Nonspecific DNA- Protein Interactions. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1990: 131-168Google Scholar; Lohman et al., 1986bLohman T.M. Overman L.B. Datta S. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 603-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). There are no experimental data that address this possibility.This paper is a continuation of our systematic study of the mechanisms by which SSB stimulates DNA synthesis. The goal of the present study is to determine if the different binding modes of Eco SSB differentially effect DNA synthesis and the mechanisms by which any differences occur. To address these questions we have used a chloride-free potassium glutamate buffer (KGB) system (McClelland et al., 1988McClelland M. Hanish J. Nelson M. Patel Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16 (364): 364Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) that did not inhibit DNA synthesis at the high concentrations required to induce the highest binding site modes. We incorporated these buffer conditions into an in vitro system, comprising a single-stranded viral DNA template hybridized to an oligonucleotide pentadecamer primer, which serves as a model for lagging strand DNA synthesis. In this study we show that the magnitude of stimulation of the T7 DNA polymerase and molecular mechanism which induces this stimulation is dependent on the binding site size with which Eco SSB interacts with the single-stranded template.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials Bacterial Strains and BacteriophagesE. coli JM103 and bacteriophage M13mp9 and M13mp7 have been described (Messing and Vieira, 1982Messing J.

The excitation wavelength of 300 nm and excitation band pass = 0.9 nm (0.5-mm slit width) were used, while the emission at 347 nm was monitored; emission bandpass = 4.5 nm (2.5-mm slit width). All titrations were carried out in a cell compartment maintained at 37.0 ± 0.2°C using a thermostated cuvette holder and a circulating water bath. A 3.0-ml solution of SSB in a 4.0-ml quartz fluorescence cell (Starna, 10 × 10 × 4.5 cm) was stirred constantly with a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (8 × 8 mm) while concentrated ssM13mp9 DNA was titrated in 2-5-μl aliquots at 2-min intervals, with a 5-s acquisition time.The fluorescence measurements were corrected for dilution, photobleaching, and inner filter effects using the method of Lohman and Mascotti (1992). The fluorescence signal from a blank containing the standard KGB buffer solution was subtracted from all data. Photobleaching of SSB was determined under each set of buffer conditions that were used in the experimental titrations and was found to be less than 2%. The SSB concentration used in these experiments was 1.11 × 10−7M (tetramer) (8.47 μg/ml). At a given salt concentration, the SSB binding sizes are constant over a 5-fold range of SSB concentration (6.3-29.7 μg/ml). Using the method of Lohman and Overman, 1985Lohman T.M. Overman L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3594-3603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, no precipitation of SSB was detected at the salt and SSB concentrations used in these studies. The relationship between the corrected fluorescence intensity and concentration of SSB (Lohman and Mascotti, 1992) was determined in total reaction buffer over the range of 1.0 to 2.0 × KGB at 37.0 ± 0.2°C. A linear response was observed over a range of [SSB] from 0.41 to 20.5 μg/ml, which corresponds to 5.0% to greater than 200% of the concentration of SSB (8.47 μg/ml) used in binding site size determinations.DNA Synthesis AssaysM13 single-stranded DNA (either 95 or 150 μg/ml) and 7-fold molar excess 15-mer primer (5′-TCCCAGTCACGACGT-3′) or (dA)1000-2500(65 μg/ml) and a 1:1 molar ratio of the hexadecamer (dT)16were annealed in 100 m M potassium glutamate by heating to 65°C for 3 min, then allowing the solutions to cool for 1 h. The indicated amounts of primed DNA were added to a reaction containing the indicated level of KGB, 5 m M 2-mercaptoethanol, 200 μM dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and [3H]dTTP (approximately 100 cpm/pmol). Reactions using poly(dA) as a template contained only 300 μM [3H]dTTP. T7 DNA polymerase and Eco SSB were added to the reaction mix as indicated. The reaction mixtures (100 μl) were incubated at 37°C for 30 min and stopped by the addition of 3 ml of ice-cold 100 m M Na4P2O7in 1 M HCl. DNA synthesis was determined by measuring the amount of acid-insoluble radioactivity by a modification of the procedure described by Richardson, 1971Richardson C.C. Cantoni G.L. Davies D.R.

The precipitate was collected on Whatman GF/C filter discs, then rinsed three times with 3 ml of the acid solution and once with 95% ethanol. Acid-precipitable counts were measured in 5 ml of a nonaqueous scintillation mixture on a Beckman LS 7500 liquid scintillation counter.Formation of Linear Single-stranded M13mp7L1 DNALinear single-stranded M13mp7L1 DNA was prepared as described (Banerjee et al., 1990Banerjee S.K.

The reaction mixture (80 μl) contained 50 m M Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 10 m M MgCl2, 10 m M 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.48 μg (96 pmol) of primer, 5 μM [α-32P]dATP(7000 Ci/mmol), and 20 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase. Incubation was for 90 min at 37°C, followed by 10 min at 75°C to inactivate the kinase. The DNA synthesis reactions were carried out as described above except the dTTP was unlabeled. The reactions were then incubated with proteinase K (80 μg) at 65°C for 20 min. This step was repeated twice, to insure maximum removal of Eco SSB from DNA synthesis products. To remove the possibility that different levels of Eco SSB affected the electrophoresis or sample loading, either the Eco SSB concentration was adjusted so that all reactions had the same concentration of Eco SSB prior to loading the gel, or it was verified that reactions were identical except for their Eco SSB level appeared the same on the gel. Reactions were diluted 1:1 with a mixture of 100% formamide, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 0.1% xylene cyanol, then boiled for 5 min and quick cooled in ice water and immediately loaded onto a 10% wedge denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Gels were autoradiographed at −70°C using Kodak XAR-5 film and a DuPont Cronex Lighting Plus intensifying screen. Gels were also scanned using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager SF and radioactivity quantitated using ImageQuant software.Alkaline Agarose Gel ElectrophoresisDNA synthesis reactions (50 μl) were carried out as described above except that dTTP was unlabeled and 300 μM [α-35S]dATP (1000 Ci/mmol) was used. Eco SSB was present as indicated. To determine the extent of strand displacement DNA synthesis, DNA synthesis reactions (50 μl) were carried out as described above except that 300 μM dATP was present and the pentadecamer primer labeled at the 5′ end with 32P as described above. The reactions were stopped by addition of 5 μl of 0.2 M EDTA (pH 8). Eleven μl of 300 m M NaOH, 6 m M EDTA (pH 8), 18% Ficoll type 400 (in water), 0.15% bromcresol green, and 0.25% xylene cyanol was added to each reaction and the samples were loaded onto a 0.7% alkaline agarose gel prepared as described (Sambrook et al., 1989Sambrook J.

Gels were soaked in 7% trichloroacetic acid for 15 min, then dried and autoradiographed at room temperature using Kodak XAR-5 film.

All incubations were carried out at 25°C. The preincubation mixture (120 μl) contained indicated amounts of primed DNA, the indicated level of KGB, and 5 m M 2-mercaptoethanol. Eco SSB was present or not, as indicated. Preincubation from 2 to 15 min gave identical results. A standard preincubation time of 2 min was chosen. The reaction was started by the addition of a 80-μl start mix containing dCTP, dGTP, dTTP, [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol), and the indicated amount of primed (dA)1000-2500in the indicated level of KGB to give final concentrations of 50 μM dCTP, dGTP, [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol), and 150 μM dTTP. Eco SSB (13.2 μg) was present as indicated. Reactions were stopped by addition of 60 μl of 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8) at the indicated times. The reactions containing Eco SSB were ethanol-precipitated as described (Sambrook et al., 1989Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

Overman L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3594-3603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Lohman and Mascotti, 1992) (data not shown). This procedure was performed over a range of KGB concentrations, with at least four replicate determinations at each salt concentration (Table I). Two binding site sizes were obtained for which n = 72 ± 4 in 0.8-1.0 × KGB, corresponding to 80-100 m M potassium glutamate and 8-10 m M magnesium acetate, and n = 91 ± 4 in 2-2.5 × KGB, corresponding to 200-250 m M potassium glutamate and 20-25 m M magnesium acetate. We believe that these binding modes correspond to the two largest Eco SSB binding modes determined for Eco SSB-poly(dT) complexes (Bujalowski and Lohman, 1986Bujalowski W. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7799-7802Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) of n = 56 and 65 nucleotides/ Eco SSB tetramer (see Discussion). The relationship between fluorescence and concentration of Eco SSB was verified to be linear in both 1 × and 2 × KGB over a range of Eco SSB concentrations from 5% to greater than 200% of the concentration used in fluorescence determinations of Eco SSB binding mode. At a given salt level, the Eco SSB binding sizes are constant over a 5-fold range of Eco SSB concentration (6.3-29.7 μg/ml) (data not shown), suggesting that our measurements of binding site size are not influenced by Eco SSB affinity (Lohman and Mascotti, 1992). We also found that the fluorescence of Eco SSB by ssM13mp9 was dependent on salt concentration, and the fluorescence of free Eco SSB was independent of salt concentration (not shown).Table I:Eco SSB binding site size and quenching determined in KGBStimulation of DNA Synthesis by Eco SSB Is Dependent on the Binding Site SizePrior studies have shown that Eco SSB can stimulate DNA synthesis by the T7 DNA polymerase and gene 4 protein on a duplex template (Scherzinger et al., 1977Scherzinger E. Lanka E. Morelli G. Seiffert D. Yuki A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 72: 543-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar; Romano and Richardson, 1979aRomano L.J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10476-10482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and this stimulation is greatest for RNA-primed lagging strand synthesis (Romano and Richardson, 1979aRomano L.J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10476-10482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, Romano and Richardson, 1979bRomano L.J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10483-10489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been shown that on single-stranded templates the T7 DNA polymerase can use short RNA primers synthesized by the T7 gene 4 protein to initiate DNA synthesis (Romano and Richardson, 1979aRomano L.J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10476-10482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, Brown and Romano, 1989Brown W.C. Romano L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6748-6754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For this study, we used oligonucleotide-primed single-stranded DNA templates as a model for T7 gene 4 protein-primed lagging strand synthesis. Addition of Eco SSB to this system (Myers and Romano, 1988Myers T.W. Romano L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17006-17015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to many in vitro replication systems (Meyer and Laine, 1990Meyer R.R. Laine P.S. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 342-380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) results in a substantial stimulation of DNA synthesis.To determine if the binding site size affected the stimulation induced by Eco SSB, we have measured DNA synthesis by the T7 DNA polymerase on a primed single-stranded M13 template under conditions that span the transition from (SSB)72to (SSB)91in both the absence and presence of Eco SSB (Fig. 1). In the absence of Eco SSB, synthesis levels remained in the 10-20 pmol range, showing that this change in salt concentration has little or no effect on synthesis when Eco SSB is not present (Fig. 1). However, in the presence of Eco SSB, we obtained a dramatic increase in the level of synthesis when the binding site size was increased from 72 to 91 (Fig. 1). These increased levels of synthesis correspond to a 4-fold stimulation of DNA synthesis by (SSB)72, while (SSB)91provided a 14-fold stimulation.FIG. 1Stimulation of T7 DNA polymerase by Eco SSB depends on SSB binding mode. DNA synthesis by the T7 DNA polymerase (0.005 units) was performed on a primed M13mp9 DNA template (0.60 μg) in the absence or presence of Eco SSB (15.8 μg) using the indicated concentration of KGB as described under “Experimental Procedures.” DNA synthesis levels were measured by the incorporation of [3H]dTTP into acid-precipitable DNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The data presented in Fig. 1 used conditions where the template was in large molar excess, conditions that provide the largest effect by Eco SSB. Prior studies (Myers and Romano, 1988Myers T.W. Romano L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17006-17015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that under these conditions Eco SSB stimulates synthesis by increasing the affinity of the polymerase for the template. It was also found that when the polymerase is present at high concentrations, it binds stably to the template in the absence of Eco SSB and the stimulation in this situation was the result of other Eco SSB properties. Therefore, it is important to explore the effect Eco SSB binding site size has on synthesis under conditions where the template is limiting. We carried out a similar set of experiments to that shown in Fig. 1, but used a 40-fold higher level of polymerase."
