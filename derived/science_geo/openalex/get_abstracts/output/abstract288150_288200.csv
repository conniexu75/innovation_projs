https://openalex.org/W2109975826,"Transformed petunia, tobacco, and tomato plants have been produced by means of a novel leaf disk transformation-regeneration method. Surface-sterilized leaf disks were inoculated with an Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain containing a modified tumor-inducing plasmid (in which the phytohormone biosynthetic genes from transferred DNA had been deleted and replaced with a chimeric gene for kanamycin resistance) and cultured for 2 days. The leaf disks were then transferred to selective medium containing kanamycin. Shoot regeneration occurred within 2 to 4 weeks, and transformants were confirmed by their ability to form roots in medium containing kanamycin. This method for producing transformed plants combines gene transfer, plant regeneration, and effective selection for transformants into a single process and should be applicable to plant species that can be infected by Agrobacterium and regenerated from leaf explants."

Not much is known about the effect of wind speed on gas exchange in such systems. In the experiment described here, sulfur hexafluoride was dissolved in lake water, and the rate of escape of the gas with wind speed (at wind speeds up to 6 meters per second) was determined over a 1-month period. A sharp change in the wind speed dependence of the gas-exchange coefficient was found at wind speeds of about 2.4 meters per second, in agreement with the results of wind-tunnel studies. However, the gas-exchange coefficients at wind speeds above 3 meters per second were smaller than those observed in wind tunnels and are in agreement with earlier lake and ocean results."
https://openalex.org/W2008809700,"The geologic record of terminal Cretaceous environmental events indicates that iridium and other associated elements were not deposited instantaneously but during a time interval spanning some 10,000 to 100,000 years. The available geologic evidence favors a mantle rather than meteoritic origin for these elements. These results are in accord with the scenario of a series of intense eruptive volcanic events occurring during a relatively short geologic time interval and not with the scenario of a single large asteroid impact event."
https://openalex.org/W15736289,"The pattern of messenger RNA synthesis in suspension-cultured bean cells (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) was analyzed by blot hybridization and in vitro translation of newly synthesized messenger RNA. The RNA was separated from preexisting RNA by organomercurial affinity chromatography after in vivo labeling with 4-thiouridine. The elicitor induced the synthesis of messenger RNA's encoding phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, chalcone synthase, and chalcone isomerase, three enzymes of phenylpropanoid metabolism involved in the synthesis of isoflavonoidderived phytoalexins. This is part of a rapid and extensive change in the pattern of messenger RNA synthesis directing production of a set of proteins associated with expression of disease resistance."

https://openalex.org/W2099361743,Linear relations of the form DeltapK = pK(D) - pK(H) = a + b pK(H) relating ionization constants of acids in light and heavy water must have the same slope b for any kind of acid unless the previously unconsidered charge type is important or this equation is not valid.
https://openalex.org/W2065966673,"Hybridoma clones secreting specific monoclonal antibodies against the aster yellows agent, a mycoplasma-like organism, were produced by using partially purified salivary gland preparations from infected leafhopper vectors as the immunogen. After 3947 hybridomas from 20 independent fusions were screened for specific antibody against the aster yellows agent, two table clones were obtained. With these monoclonal antibodies the aster yellows agent in diseased lettuce, periwinkles, and inoculative insects was specifically identified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The aster yellows agent was serologically differentiated from the mycoplasma-like organisms associated with ash yellows, loofah witches'-broom, paulownia witches'-broom, sweet potato witches'-broom, peanut rosette, maize bushy stunt, and elm phloem necrosis."

Our new determination agrees with earlier high-temperature work but is significantly different from previous low-temperature work. The equilibrium curve obtained can be used to interpret formation of aragonite during metamorphism."
https://openalex.org/W2041882532,"One of the major unresolved questions in Pleistocene paleoclimatology has been whether continental climatic transitions are consistent with the glacial δ18O marine record. Searles Lake in California, now a dry salt pan, is underlain by sediment layers deposited in a succession of lakes whose levels and salinities have fluctuated in response to changes in climate over the last 3 × 106 years. Uranium-series dates on the salt beds range from 35 × 103 to 231 × 103 years. This range of dates allows identification of lake-sediment horizons that are time correlatives of the boundaries of marine isotope stages from the recent 3/4 boundary back to the 8/9 boundary. The 5/6 boundary coincided with a deepening of the lake, but the analogous 1/2 boundary coincided with desiccation. The 3/4, 4/5, 6/7, 7/8, and 8/9 boundaries correspond in age to horizons that record little or no change in sedimentation or climate. These hydrologic results demonstrate that the continental paleoclimate record at this mid-latitude site does not mimic the marine record."

https://openalex.org/W2121701285,"The abnormally large values of the energy and the entropy of activation encountered in protein denaturations and enzyme destructions are illusory, since the customary method of calculating these quantities by the comparison of rates at constant p(H) alone is fallacious. This procedure includes, in addition to the true energy of activation, the heat of dissociation of all acidic equilibria involved in preparing the initial molecules for the kinetic step of activation. Steinhardt has shown by a simple and concrete mechanism that the kinetics of pepsin destruction obey the simple laws of chemical kinetics when correction is made for the preliminary acidic dissociation equilibria which are not part of the activation process."
https://openalex.org/W1969131130,"Oliver Wendell Holmes (14) said 100 years ago, ""I firmly believe that if the whole materia medica as now used could be sunk to the bottom of the sea, it would be all the better for mankind-and all the worse for the fishes."" This is still true for the fishes; in fact, with our more potent drugs, it would be even worse for them. So far as mankind is concerned, however, I disagree; I need point only to our vastly improved mortality and morbidity rates. But mankind would be still better off if the physician treated the products of modern science with due regard for the principles of science; if there were no pressures distracting him from these principles; and if, in attacking disease, he viewed the large problem, with its long-range implications, as well as the immediate effects on a number of dissociated diseases. I think that the physician must transcend the businessman's ethic, and also that the safe and effective clinical use of new drugs requires a new and acceptable image of the physician, one which combines the qualities of Dr. Christian and the discipline and special skill and logic of the scientist."

https://openalex.org/W2072245251,"Radioisotope-fueled generators are classed by (i) application (space or terrestrial), (ii) fuel (alpha-emitter or fission product, short or long half-life), and (iii) converter type (thermoelectric or thermionic). The environment determines the design of the heat sink mechanism. The type of fuel is chosen according to the application and the availability and cost of the fuel. The space systems are suitable for low-powered (less than 1 kw), long-lived, earth-orbit missions, making storage batteries unnecessary. They are independent of radiation belts and solar transients and are suitable for lunar missions, where power is needed during the long lunar night; for probes into the dense atmosphere of Venus; and in general, for missions away from the sun."

https://openalex.org/W2071367504,"IN the early years of the Association, a favourite theme in the annual address of the retiring president was the relation between science and religion. To a majority of modern scientists nothing is more dull and fruitless than attempts to make science the handmaid of theology. But there is an aspect of religion with which science is vitally concerned, namely, ethics, and this has been well called “the religion of science”."
