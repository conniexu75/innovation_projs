https://openalex.org/W2007263482,"The mean trophic level of the species groups reported in Food and Agricultural Organization global fisheries statistics declined from 1950 to 1994. This reflects a gradual transition in landings from long-lived, high trophic level, piscivorous bottom fish toward short-lived, low trophic level invertebrates and planktivorous pelagic fish. This effect, also found to be occurring in inland fisheries, is most pronounced in the Northern Hemisphere. Fishing down food webs (that is, at lower trophic levels) leads at first to increasing catches, then to a phase transition associated with stagnating or declining catches. These results indicate that present exploitation patterns are unsustainable."

https://openalex.org/W2106389606,"The calcium-calmodulin–dependent kinase II (CaMKII) is required for hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and spatial learning. In addition to its calcium-calmodulin (CaM)–dependent activity, CaMKII can undergo autophosphorylation, resulting in CaM-independent activity. A point mutation was introduced into the αCaMKII gene that blocked the autophosphorylation of threonine at position 286 (Thr 286 ) of this kinase without affecting its CaM-dependent activity. The mutant mice had no N -methyl- d -aspartate receptor–dependent LTP in the hippocampal CA1 area and showed no spatial learning in the Morris water maze. Thus, the autophosphorylation of αCaMKII at Thr 286 appears to be required for LTP and learning."

https://openalex.org/W2020258831,"At the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, the prion protein (PrP) can be synthesized in several topological forms. The role of these different forms was explored with transgenic mice expressing PrP mutations that alter the relative ratios of the topological forms. Expression of a particular transmembrane form (termed CtmPrP) produced neurodegenerative changes in mice similar to those of some genetic prion diseases. Brains from these mice contained CtmPrP but not PrPSc, the PrP isoform responsible for transmission of prion diseases. Furthermore, in one heritable prion disease of humans, brain tissue contained CtmPrP but not PrPSc. Thus, aberrant regulation of protein biogenesis and topology at the endoplasmic reticulum can result in neurodegeneration."

Here, a large number of mutants called dot (defective for organelle trafficking) that were unable to replicate intracellularly because of an inability of the bacteria to alter the endocytic pathway of macrophages were isolated. The dot virulence genes encoded a large putative membrane complex that functioned as a secretion system that was able to transfer plasmid DNA from one cell to another."

https://openalex.org/W2126733133,"In the biosynthesis of steroid hormones, P450c17 is the single enzyme that catalyzes both the 17α-hydroxylation of 21-carbon steroids and the 17,20-lyase activity that cleaves the C17-C20 bond to produce C19sex steroids. Cytochrome b 5 augments the 17,20-lyase activity of cytochrome P450c17 in vitro, but this has not been demonstrated in membranes, and the mechanism of this action is unknown. We expressed human P450c17, human P450-oxidoreductase (OR), and/or human cytochromeb 5 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and analyzed the 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activities of the resulting yeast microsomes. Yeast expressing only P450c17 have 17α-hydroxylase and trace 17,20-lyase activities toward both Δ4 and Δ5 steroids. Coexpression of human OR with P450c17 increases the V max of both the 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase reactions 5-fold; coexpression of human b 5 with P450c17 also increases theV max of the 17,20-lyase reactions but not of the 17α-hydroxylase reactions. Simultaneous expression of humanb 5 with P450c17 and OR, or addition of purified human b 5 to microsomes from yeast coexpressing human P450c17 and OR, further increases theV max of the 17,20-lyase reaction without altering 17α-hydroxylase activity. Genetically engineered yeast and mixing experiments demonstrate that OR is both necessary and sufficient for microsomal 17,20-lyase activity. Addition of purified human holo-b 5, apo-b 5, or cytochrome c to microsomes containing both human P450c17 and OR demonstrate that the stimulatory action ofb 5 does not require electron transfer fromb 5 to P450c17. These data suggest that humanb 5 acts principally as an allosteric effector that interacts primarily with the P450c17·OR complex to stimulate 17,20-lyase activity. In the biosynthesis of steroid hormones, P450c17 is the single enzyme that catalyzes both the 17α-hydroxylation of 21-carbon steroids and the 17,20-lyase activity that cleaves the C17-C20 bond to produce C19sex steroids. Cytochrome b 5 augments the 17,20-lyase activity of cytochrome P450c17 in vitro, but this has not been demonstrated in membranes, and the mechanism of this action is unknown.

Yeast expressing only P450c17 have 17α-hydroxylase and trace 17,20-lyase activities toward both Δ4 and Δ5 steroids. Coexpression of human OR with P450c17 increases the V max of both the 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase reactions 5-fold; coexpression of human b 5 with P450c17 also increases theV max of the 17,20-lyase reactions but not of the 17α-hydroxylase reactions.

Among the many chemical transformations catalyzed by cytochrome P450 enzymes, steroid hormone hydroxylations, and cleavages are of particular interest because of their mechanistic complexities and essential roles in physiology (1Miller W.L. Endocr. Rev. 1988; 9: 295-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar). P450c17 catalyzes both 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activities (2Nakajin S. Hall P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3871-3876Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (for review see Ref.3Miller W.L. Auchus R.J. Geller D.H. Steroids. 1997; 62: 135-144Crossref Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and also has a modest degree of 16α-hydroxylase activity (4Nakajin S. Takahashi M. Shinoda M. Hall P.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 132: 708-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In human beings, the 17α-hydroxylase reaction leads to the glucocorticoid, cortisol, and the subsequent 17,20-lyase reaction leads to precursors of sex steroids. As the sole pathway leading to biosynthesis of circulating sex steroids, the regulation of this 17,20-lyase activity is central to understanding the developmental regulation of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA) 1The abbreviations used are: DHEA, dehydroepiandrosterone; OR, P450-oxidoreductase;b 5, cytochrome b 5; V10, vector pYeDP10; V60, vector pYeDP60; cDE2, vector pYcDE-2; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. 1The abbreviations used are: DHEA, dehydroepiandrosterone; OR, P450-oxidoreductase;b 5, cytochrome b 5; V10, vector pYeDP10; V60, vector pYeDP60; cDE2, vector pYcDE-2; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. with adrenarche and aging, and to the pathogenesis of the polycystic ovary syndrome (3Miller W.L. Auchus R.J. Geller D.H. Steroids. 1997; 62: 135-144Crossref Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The 17,20-lyase activity, involving the oxidative cleavage of a carbon-carbon bond, is regulated in a tissue-specific and developmentally programmed manner by factors such as the abundance of the electron donor flavoprotein P450-oxidoreductase (OR) (5Lin D. Black S.M. Nagahama Y. Miller W.L. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 2498-2506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Yanagibashi K. Hall P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8429-8433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the co-existence of 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and P450c21 (7Conley A.J. Bird I.M. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 56: 789-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), and post-translational modification of P450c17 (8Zhang L. Rodriguez H. Ohno S. Miller W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10619-10623Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar).To perform catalysis, P450c17, like all other microsomal P450 oxygenases, must receive two electrons from NADPH via OR. Cytochromeb 5 has also been implicated as a component of the 17,20-lyase reaction, as b 5 augments 17,20-lyase activity and occasionally 17α-hydroxylase activity of P450c17 in reconstituted systems (9Onoda M. Hall P.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 108: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 10Kominami S. Ogawa N. Morimune R. Huang D.Y. Takemori S. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 42: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar); however, our laboratory could not confirm this effect in transfected monkey kidney COS-1 cells (5Lin D. Black S.M. Nagahama Y. Miller W.L. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 2498-2506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inconsistencies in the animal species of P450c17, OR, and b 5 used in previous studies preclude extrapolation of the available biochemical data to human adrenal and gonadal physiology; furthermore, the mechanism(s) of these reportedb 5-mediated increases in 17,20-lyase activity remain unknown.Among the various systems developed to study mammalian cytochromes P450, transfection of genetically modified yeast cells provides the opportunity to study the activities of a cytochrome P450 in the presence of various combinations of electron transfer proteins in the native microsomal environment (11Pompon D. Louerat B. Bronine A. Urban P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 272: 51-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To clarify the function of cytochrome b 5 in 17,20-lyase activity, we systematically varied the abundance of putative electron transfer proteins in yeast microsomes containing human P450c17. We find that human, but not yeast cytochrome b 5 can selectively augment the rate of the 17,20-lyase reaction by more than 10-fold. However, this augmentation requires OR and occurs without electron transfer to or from cytochrome b 5.DISCUSSIONThe 17,20-lyase/17α-hydroxylase ratio in the human adrenal rises dramatically with the onset of adrenarche at age 8–10, reaches maximal values at age 25–35, and then falls progressively with aging (39Orentreich N. Brind J.L. Rizer R.L. Vogelman J.H. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1984; 59: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar); as these phenomena occur only in human beings and great apes (40Cutler G.B. Glenn M. Bush M. Hodgen G.D. Graham C.E. Loriaux D.L. Endocrinology. 1978; 103: 2112-2118Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), their study is difficult. These selective, physiologic, developmentally programmed changes in human adrenal 17,20-lyase activity imply regulatory mechanisms beyond transcription of P450c17 or OR (3Miller W.L. Auchus R.J. Geller D.H. Steroids. 1997; 62: 135-144Crossref Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 8Zhang L. Rodriguez H. Ohno S. Miller W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10619-10623Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Most P450 enzymes catalyze multiple reactions, but the ratio of their activities remains fixed. The developmentally and possibly hormonally programmed changes in the ratio of 17,20-lyase to 17α-hydroxylase activities of human P450c17 provide a unique system for studying the differential regulation of two reactions catalyzed by a single P450 enzyme.An augmentation of the 17,20-lyase activity of P450c17 byb 5 has been observed in vitro (9Onoda M. Hall P.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 108: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 25Katagiri M. Kagawa N. Waterman M.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 317: 343-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) but was not seen in transfected COS-1 cells (5Lin D. Black S.M. Nagahama Y. Miller W.L. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 2498-2506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), possibly because the endogenous b 5 in those cells was sufficient to stimulate 17,20-lyase activity maximally. Thus, it has not been clear how or if b 5 regulates human P450c17 activitiesin vivo. The use of microsomes from yeast engineered to express human P450c17, OR, or b 5 from inducible promoters permits the quantitative manipulation of each protein in a membrane environment that should simulate events in vivo. This permits greater experimental flexibility than the use of bicistronic plasmids (41Parikh A. Gillam E.M.J. Guengerich F.P. Nature Biotech. 1997; 15: 346-354Crossref Scopus (279) Google Scholar), fusion proteins (29Shet M.S. Fisher C.W. Arlotto M.P. Shackleton C.H.L. Holmans P.L. Martin-Wixtrom C.A. Saeki Y. Estabrook R.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 402-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), or viral vectors (42Aoyama T. Nagata K. Yamazoe Y. Kato R. Matsunaga E. Gelboin H.V. Gonzalez F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5425-5429Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and obviates concerns about the relevance of data from detergent-solubilized systems to in vivo systems.Titration experiments with purified human holo-b 5, apo-b 5, and cytochrome c showed that the stimulatory effect ofb 5 on 17,20-lyase activity is not mediated by electron transfer from b 5 and suggest thatb 5 exerts an allosteric effect on the P450c17·OR complex. This proposed mechanism could explain three observations from other laboratories. First, b 5facilitates electron transfer from OR to P450 3A4 only when all three proteins are premixed before adding NADPH and substrate, but not whenb 5 is premixed with P450 3A4 and added to OR, NADPH, and substrate in stop-flow experiments (24Yamazaki H. Johnson W.W. Ueng Y.F. Shimada T. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27438-27444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). These data suggested that the stimulatory action of b 5 on testosterone 6β-hydroxylation by P450 3A4 was an allosteric effect and was not mediated by an action of b 5 as an alternate electron donor (24Yamazaki H. Johnson W.W. Ueng Y.F. Shimada T. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27438-27444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Second, b 5 is a more potent stimulator of 17,20-lyase activity when the abundance of OR is low, and this stimulation is quite sensitive to small changes in these low amounts of OR (10Kominami S. Ogawa N. Morimune R. Huang D.Y. Takemori S. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 42: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Our results corroborate these studies and suggest that b 5 interacts primarily with the P450c17·OR complex and not with P450c17 alone. Third, the redox-active core 1 segment of porcine b 5 alone cannot augment the 17,20-lyase activity of human P450c17 (43Lee-Robichaud P. Kaderbhai M.A. Kaderbhai N. Wright J.N. Akhtar M. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 857-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), consistent with our findings that electron transfer from humanb 5 is not required to stimulate 17,20-lyase activity.Three conclusions about human physiology emerge from our analysis of the kinetics of human P450c17. First, human androgen biosynthesis proceeds predominantly through the pathway 17α-hydroxypregnenolone → DHEA → androstenedione, rather than through the pathway 17α-hydroxypregnenolone → 17α-hydroxyprogesterone → androstenedione. The pathway via DHEA predominates because the apparentK m for Δ4 17α-hydroxyprogesterone is about 10-fold higher and its V max is one-tenth as fast as the corresponding values for Δ517α-hydroxypregnenolone. Thus, the catalytic efficiencyV max/K m for the 17,20-lyase reaction is nearly 100-fold greater for Δ517α-hydroxypregnenolone than for Δ417α-hydroxyprogesterone. Second, significant androgen biosynthesis via the Δ4 pathway can only occur in the presence of very high Δ4 17α-hydroxyprogesterone concentrations, as found in untreated patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency (44Miller W.L. Morel Y. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1989; 23: 371-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Third, considerable microsomal 17,20-lyase activity is found even in the complete absence of b 5; therefore, b 5 deficiency cannot cause a syndrome of complete 17,20-lyase deficiency (23Geller D.H. Auchus R.J. Mendonça B.B. Miller W.L. Nature Genet. 1997; 17: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) as has been suggested (45Giordano S.J. Kaftory A. Steggles A.W. Hum. Genet. 1994; 93: 568-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).The structural nature of the interaction of P450c17 with OR is not known, but the x-ray crystal structures of rat OR (46Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Masters B.S.S. Kim J.-J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8411-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar) and P450-BMP (47Ravichandran K.G. Boddupalli S.S. Hasemann C.A. Peterson J.A. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1993; 261: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar) provide useful clues. The redox-partner binding site for P450-BMP, a Type II (microsomal) P450, comprises the surface surrounding a depression in the “proximal” face of the protein that extends down to the face of the heme opposite the substrate-binding pocket (47Ravichandran K.G. Boddupalli S.S. Hasemann C.A. Peterson J.A. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1993; 261: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar, 48Hasemann C.A. Kurumbail R.G. Boddupalli S.S. Peterson J.A. Deisenhofer J. Structure. 1995; 3: 41-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). This crevasse is lined on one side with positively charged residues from the J′ and K helices (in P450-BMP, lysines 325, 328, and 331) which appear to participate in electrostatic pairing with negatively charged residues in OR. Molecular modeling shows that human P450c17 has a similarly located crevasse of positively charged residues that interact with redox partners (23Geller D.H. Auchus R.J. Mendonça B.B. Miller W.L. Nature Genet. 1997; 17: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The electron-donating FMN moiety of rat OR also lies at the base of a concave cleft formed by the butterfly-shaped apposition of the FMN and FAD domains (46Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Masters B.S.S. Kim J.-J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8411-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). However, the FMN domain joins the remainder of the protein via a disordered, flexible hinge that must flex about 90° for the FMN moiety to extend out from the concave cleft of OR (46Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Masters B.S.S. Kim J.-J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8411-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar) to approach the concave redox-partner binding site of P450c17 (23Geller D.H. Auchus R.J. Mendonça B.B. Miller W.L. Nature Genet. 1997; 17: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar).Because b 5 normally participates in redox reactions such as methemoglobin reduction (49Kuma F. Prough R.A. Masters B.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 172: 600-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and stearyl-CoA desaturation (50Oshino N. Imai Y. Sato R. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1971; 69: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) and can serve as an alternate electron donor in some other P450 reactions (51Yamazaki H. Gillam E.M. Dong M.S. Johnson W.W. Guengerich F.P. Shimada T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 342: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), our demonstration thatb 5 serves a role as an allosteric facilitator of electron transfer from OR to P450c17 was unexpected. The binding of redox partners to P450c17 must transmit subtle changes to the substrate-binding pocket, as evidenced by the lowerK m values for Δ5 substrates in the presence of human OR (Table III) and by analogy to the altered regiospecificity of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine oxygenation by P450 2D6 in the presence of OR (28Modi S. Gilham D.E. Sutcliffe M.J. Lian L.Y. Primrose W.U. Wolf C.R. Roberts G.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4461-4470Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the oxidative scission of the C17-C20 bond of 17α-hydroxypregnenolone appears to impose much more stringent constraints on the active-site topology of P450c17 than does the 17α-hydroxylase reaction. Therefore, we propose thatb 5 optimizes the geometry of the P450c17·OR complex for the more sensitive 17,20-lyase reaction perhaps by forming a ternary complex (Fig. 7). The structural core 2 domain of b 5 may be the region that stimulates 17,20-lyase activity, as core 2 adopts a similar conformation in the NMR structures of both isolated holo-b 5 (52Muskett F.W. Kelly G.P. Whitford D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 172-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and apo-b 5(53Falzone C.J. Mayer M.R. Whiteman E.L. Moore C.D. Lecomte J.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6519-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), whereas the heme-binding core 1 domain is disordered in apo-b 5 (53Falzone C.J. Mayer M.R. Whiteman E.L. Moore C.D. Lecomte J.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6519-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Furthermore, core 2 retains its overall topology during molecular dynamics simulations of apo-b 5, while core 1 loses secondary structure and exhibits conformational mobility (54Storch E.M. Daggett V. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11596-11604Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).A role for b 5 as an allosteric effector protein is consistent with our observation that serine phosphorylation of P450c17 selectively increases 17,20-lyase activity (8Zhang L. Rodriguez H. Ohno S. Miller W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10619-10623Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) and that mutations of arginine residues in the redox-partner binding site of human P450c17 cause isolated 17,20-lyase deficiency (23Geller D.H. Auchus R.J. Mendonça B.B. Miller W.L. Nature Genet. 1997; 17: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The precise orientation of OR in the electron-donor docking region of P450c17 required to assemble the active oxygenating complex for the 17,20-lyase reaction is impaired by mutation of this surface and enhanced byb 5 or apo-b 5. Phosphorylation of P450c17 probably favors assembly of productive complexes so that electron transfer is more rapid and coupling efficiency is higher; however, the exact mechanism by which phosphorylated serine residues enhance 17,20-lyase activity is not yet known. A more detailed understanding of these complexes is essential for understanding the regulation of 17,20-lyase activity; this in turn may permit development of agents to inhibit this activity, which will aid in the treatment of sex steroid-dependent malignancies and disorders of androgen excess. Among the many chemical transformations catalyzed by cytochrome P450 enzymes, steroid hormone hydroxylations, and cleavages are of particular interest because of their mechanistic complexities and essential roles in physiology (1Miller W.L. Endocr. Rev. 1988; 9: 295-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar). P450c17 catalyzes both 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activities (2Nakajin S. Hall P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3871-3876Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (for review see Ref.3Miller W.L. Auchus R.J. Geller D.H. Steroids. 1997; 62: 135-144Crossref Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and also has a modest degree of 16α-hydroxylase activity (4Nakajin S. Takahashi M. Shinoda M. Hall P.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In human beings, the 17α-hydroxylase reaction leads to the glucocorticoid, cortisol, and the subsequent 17,20-lyase reaction leads to precursors of sex steroids.

The 17,20-lyase activity, involving the oxidative cleavage of a carbon-carbon bond, is regulated in a tissue-specific and developmentally programmed manner by factors such as the abundance of the electron donor flavoprotein P450-oxidoreductase (OR) (5Lin D. Black S.M. Nagahama Y. Miller W.L. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 2498-2506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Yanagibashi K. Hall P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8429-8433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the co-existence of 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and P450c21 (7Conley A.J. Bird I.M. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 56: 789-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), and post-translational modification of P450c17 (8Zhang L. Rodriguez H. Ohno S. Miller W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10619-10623Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). To perform catalysis, P450c17, like all other microsomal P450 oxygenases, must receive two electrons from NADPH via OR. Cytochromeb 5 has also been implicated as a component of the 17,20-lyase reaction, as b 5 augments 17,20-lyase activity and occasionally 17α-hydroxylase activity of P450c17 in reconstituted systems (9Onoda M. Hall P.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 108: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 10Kominami S. Ogawa N. Morimune R. Huang D.Y. Takemori S. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 42: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar); however, our laboratory could not confirm this effect in transfected monkey kidney COS-1 cells (5Lin D. Black S.M. Nagahama Y. Miller W.L. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 2498-2506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inconsistencies in the animal species of P450c17, OR, and b 5 used in previous studies preclude extrapolation of the available biochemical data to human adrenal and gonadal physiology; furthermore, the mechanism(s) of these reportedb 5-mediated increases in 17,20-lyase activity remain unknown. Among the various systems developed to study mammalian cytochromes P450, transfection of genetically modified yeast cells provides the opportunity to study the activities of a cytochrome P450 in the presence of various combinations of electron transfer proteins in the native microsomal environment (11Pompon D. Louerat B. Bronine A. Urban P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 272: 51-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To clarify the function of cytochrome b 5 in 17,20-lyase activity, we systematically varied the abundance of putative electron transfer proteins in yeast microsomes containing human P450c17. We find that human, but not yeast cytochrome b 5 can selectively augment the rate of the 17,20-lyase reaction by more than 10-fold. However, this augmentation requires OR and occurs without electron transfer to or from cytochrome b 5. DISCUSSIONThe 17,20-lyase/17α-hydroxylase ratio in the human adrenal rises dramatically with the onset of adrenarche at age 8–10, reaches maximal values at age 25–35, and then falls progressively with aging (39Orentreich N. Brind J.L. Rizer R.L. Vogelman J.H. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1984; 59: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar); as these phenomena occur only in human beings and great apes (40Cutler G.B. Glenn M. Bush M. Hodgen G.D. Graham C.E. Loriaux D.L. Endocrinology. 1978; 103: 2112-2118Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), their study is difficult. These selective, physiologic, developmentally programmed changes in human adrenal 17,20-lyase activity imply regulatory mechanisms beyond transcription of P450c17 or OR (3Miller W.L. Auchus R.J. Geller D.H. Steroids. 1997; 62: 135-144Crossref Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 8Zhang L. Rodriguez H. Ohno S. Miller W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10619-10623Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Most P450 enzymes catalyze multiple reactions, but the ratio of their activities remains fixed. The developmentally and possibly hormonally programmed changes in the ratio of 17,20-lyase to 17α-hydroxylase activities of human P450c17 provide a unique system for studying the differential regulation of two reactions catalyzed by a single P450 enzyme.An augmentation of the 17,20-lyase activity of P450c17 byb 5 has been observed in vitro (9Onoda M. Hall P.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 108: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 25Katagiri M. Kagawa N. Waterman M.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 317: 343-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) but was not seen in transfected COS-1 cells (5Lin D. Black S.M. Nagahama Y. Miller W.L. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 2498-2506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), possibly because the endogenous b 5 in those cells was sufficient to stimulate 17,20-lyase activity maximally. Thus, it has not been clear how or if b 5 regulates human P450c17 activitiesin vivo. The use of microsomes from yeast engineered to express human P450c17, OR, or b 5 from inducible promoters permits the quantitative manipulation of each protein in a membrane environment that should simulate events in vivo. This permits greater experimental flexibility than the use of bicistronic plasmids (41Parikh A. Gillam E.M.J. Guengerich F.P. Nature Biotech. 1997; 15: 346-354Crossref Scopus (279) Google Scholar), fusion proteins (29Shet M.S. Fisher C.W. Arlotto M.P. Shackleton C.H.L. Holmans P.L. Martin-Wixtrom C.A. Saeki Y. Estabrook R.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 402-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), or viral vectors (42Aoyama T. Nagata K. Yamazoe Y. Kato R. Matsunaga E. Gelboin H.V. Gonzalez F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5425-5429Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and obviates concerns about the relevance of data from detergent-solubilized systems to in vivo systems.Titration experiments with purified human holo-b 5, apo-b 5, and cytochrome c showed that the stimulatory effect ofb 5 on 17,20-lyase activity is not mediated by electron transfer from b 5 and suggest thatb 5 exerts an allosteric effect on the P450c17·OR complex. This proposed mechanism could explain three observations from other laboratories. First, b 5facilitates electron transfer from OR to P450 3A4 only when all three proteins are premixed before adding NADPH and substrate, but not whenb 5 is premixed with P450 3A4 and added to OR, NADPH, and substrate in stop-flow experiments (24Yamazaki H. Johnson W.W. Ueng Y.F. Shimada T. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27438-27444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). These data suggested that the stimulatory action of b 5 on testosterone 6β-hydroxylation by P450 3A4 was an allosteric effect and was not mediated by an action of b 5 as an alternate electron donor (24Yamazaki H. Johnson W.W. Ueng Y.F. Shimada T. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27438-27444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Second, b 5 is a more potent stimulator of 17,20-lyase activity when the abundance of OR is low, and this stimulation is quite sensitive to small changes in these low amounts of OR (10Kominami S. Ogawa N. Morimune R. Huang D.Y. Takemori S. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 42: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Our results corroborate these studies and suggest that b 5 interacts primarily with the P450c17·OR complex and not with P450c17 alone. Third, the redox-active core 1 segment of porcine b 5 alone cannot augment the 17,20-lyase activity of human P450c17 (43Lee-Robichaud P. Kaderbhai M.A. Kaderbhai N. Wright J.N. Akhtar M. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 857-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), consistent with our findings that electron transfer from humanb 5 is not required to stimulate 17,20-lyase activity.Three conclusions about human physiology emerge from our analysis of the kinetics of human P450c17. First, human androgen biosynthesis proceeds predominantly through the pathway 17α-hydroxypregnenolone → DHEA → androstenedione, rather than through the pathway 17α-hydroxypregnenolone → 17α-hydroxyprogesterone → androstenedione. The pathway via DHEA predominates because the apparentK m for Δ4 17α-hydroxyprogesterone is about 10-fold higher and its V max is one-tenth as fast as the corresponding values for Δ517α-hydroxypregnenolone. Thus, the catalytic efficiencyV max/K m for the 17,20-lyase reaction is nearly 100-fold greater for Δ517α-hydroxypregnenolone than for Δ417α-hydroxyprogesterone. Second, significant androgen biosynthesis via the Δ4 pathway can only occur in the presence of very high Δ4 17α-hydroxyprogesterone concentrations, as found in untreated patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency (44Miller W.L. Morel Y. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1989; 23: 371-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Third, considerable microsomal 17,20-lyase activity is found even in the complete absence of b 5; therefore, b 5 deficiency cannot cause a syndrome of complete 17,20-lyase deficiency (23Geller D.H. Auchus R.J. Mendonça B.B. Miller W.L. Nature Genet. 1997; 17: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) as has been suggested (45Giordano S.J. Kaftory A. Steggles A.W. Hum. Genet. 1994; 93: 568-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).The structural nature of the interaction of P450c17 with OR is not known, but the x-ray crystal structures of rat OR (46Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Masters B.S.S. Kim J.-J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8411-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar) and P450-BMP (47Ravichandran K.G. Boddupalli S.S. Hasemann C.A. Peterson J.A. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1993; 261: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar) provide useful clues. The redox-partner binding site for P450-BMP, a Type II (microsomal) P450, comprises the surface surrounding a depression in the “proximal” face of the protein that extends down to the face of the heme opposite the substrate-binding pocket (47Ravichandran K.G. Boddupalli S.S. Hasemann C.A. Peterson J.A. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1993; 261: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar, 48Hasemann C.A. Kurumbail R.G. Boddupalli S.S. Peterson J.A. Deisenhofer J. Structure. 1995; 3: 41-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). This crevasse is lined on one side with positively charged residues from the J′ and K helices (in P450-BMP, lysines 325, 328, and 331) which appear to participate in electrostatic pairing with negatively charged residues in OR. Molecular modeling shows that human P450c17 has a similarly located crevasse of positively charged residues that interact with redox partners (23Geller D.H. Auchus R.J. Mendonça B.B. Miller W.L. Nature Genet. 1997; 17: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The electron-donating FMN moiety of rat OR also lies at the base of a concave cleft formed by the butterfly-shaped apposition of the FMN and FAD domains (46Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Masters B.S.S. Kim J.-J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8411-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). However, the FMN domain joins the remainder of the protein via a disordered, flexible hinge that must flex about 90° for the FMN moiety to extend out from the concave cleft of OR (46Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Masters B.S.S. Kim J.-J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8411-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar) to approach the concave redox-partner binding site of P450c17 (23Geller D.H. Auchus R.J. Mendonça B.B. Miller W.L. Nature Genet. 1997; 17: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar).Because b 5 normally participates in redox reactions such as methemoglobin reduction (49Kuma F. Prough R.A. Masters B.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 172: 600-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and stearyl-CoA desaturation (50Oshino N. Imai Y. Sato R. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1971; 69: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) and can serve as an alternate electron donor in some other P450 reactions (51Yamazaki H. Gillam E.M. Dong M.S. Johnson W.W. Guengerich F.P. Shimada T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 342: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), our demonstration thatb 5 serves a role as an allosteric facilitator of electron transfer from OR to P450c17 was unexpected. The binding of redox partners to P450c17 must transmit subtle changes to the substrate-binding pocket, as evidenced by the lowerK m values for Δ5 substrates in the presence of human OR (Table III) and by analogy to the altered regiospecificity of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine oxygenation by P450 2D6 in the presence of OR (28Modi S. Gilham D.E. Sutcliffe M.J. Lian L.Y. Primrose W.U. Wolf C.R. Roberts G.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4461-4470Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the oxidative scission of the C17-C20 bond of 17α-hydroxypregnenolone appears to impose much more stringent constraints on the active-site topology of P450c17 than does the 17α-hydroxylase reaction. Therefore, we propose thatb 5 optimizes the geometry of the P450c17·OR complex for the more sensitive 17,20-lyase reaction perhaps by forming a ternary complex (Fig. 7). The structural core 2 domain of b 5 may be the region that stimulates 17,20-lyase activity, as core 2 adopts a similar conformation in the NMR structures of both isolated holo-b 5 (52Muskett F.W. Kelly G.P. Whitford D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 172-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and apo-b 5(53Falzone C.J. Mayer M.R. Whiteman E.L. Moore C.D. Lecomte J.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6519-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), whereas the heme-binding core 1 domain is disordered in apo-b 5 (53Falzone C.J. Mayer M.R. Whiteman E.L. Moore C.D. Lecomte J.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6519-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Furthermore, core 2 retains its overall topology during molecular dynamics simulations of apo-b 5, while core 1 loses secondary structure and exhibits conformational mobility (54Storch E.M. Daggett V. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11596-11604Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).A role for b 5 as an allosteric effector protein is consistent with our observation that serine phosphorylation of P450c17 selectively increases 17,20-lyase activity (8Zhang L. Rodriguez H. Ohno S. Miller W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10619-10623Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) and that mutations of arginine residues in the redox-partner binding site of human P450c17 cause isolated 17,20-lyase deficiency (23Geller D.H. Auchus R.J. Mendonça B.B. Miller W.L. Nature Genet. 1997; 17: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The precise orientation of OR in the electron-donor docking region of P450c17 required to assemble the active oxygenating complex for the 17,20-lyase reaction is impaired by mutation of this surface and enhanced byb 5 or apo-b 5. Phosphorylation of P450c17 probably favors assembly of productive complexes so that electron transfer is more rapid and coupling efficiency is higher; however, the exact mechanism by which phosphorylated serine residues enhance 17,20-lyase activity is not yet known. A more detailed understanding of these complexes is essential for understanding the regulation of 17,20-lyase activity; this in turn may permit development of agents to inhibit this activity, which will aid in the treatment of sex steroid-dependent malignancies and disorders of androgen excess. The 17,20-lyase/17α-hydroxylase ratio in the human adrenal rises dramatically with the onset of adrenarche at age 8–10, reaches maximal values at age 25–35, and then falls progressively with aging (39Orentreich N.

These selective, physiologic, developmentally programmed changes in human adrenal 17,20-lyase activity imply regulatory mechanisms beyond transcription of P450c17 or OR (3Miller W.L. Auchus R.J.

Masters B.S.S. Kim J.-J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8411-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). However, the FMN domain joins the remainder of the protein via a disordered, flexible hinge that must flex about 90° for the FMN moiety to extend out from the concave cleft of OR (46Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Masters B.S.S. Kim J.-J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8411-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar) to approach the concave redox-partner binding site of P450c17 (23Geller D.H. Auchus R.J. Mendonça B.B. Miller W.L. Nature Genet. 1997; 17: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Because b 5 normally participates in redox reactions such as methemoglobin reduction (49Kuma F. Prough R.A. Masters B.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 172: 600-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and stearyl-CoA desaturation (50Oshino N. Imai Y. Sato R. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1971; 69: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) and can serve as an alternate electron donor in some other P450 reactions (51Yamazaki H. Gillam E.M. Dong M.S. Johnson W.W. Guengerich F.P. Shimada T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 342: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), our demonstration thatb 5 serves a role as an allosteric facilitator of electron transfer from OR to P450c17 was unexpected. The binding of redox partners to P450c17 must transmit subtle changes to the substrate-binding pocket, as evidenced by the lowerK m values for Δ5 substrates in the presence of human OR (Table III) and by analogy to the altered regiospecificity of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine oxygenation by P450 2D6 in the presence of OR (28Modi S. Gilham D.E. Sutcliffe M.J. Lian L.Y. Primrose W.U. Wolf C.R. Roberts G.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4461-4470Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the oxidative scission of the C17-C20 bond of 17α-hydroxypregnenolone appears to impose much more stringent constraints on the active-site topology of P450c17 than does the 17α-hydroxylase reaction. Therefore, we propose thatb 5 optimizes the geometry of the P450c17·OR complex for the more sensitive 17,20-lyase reaction perhaps by forming a ternary complex (Fig. 7). The structural core 2 domain of b 5 may be the region that stimulates 17,20-lyase activity, as core 2 adopts a similar conformation in the NMR structures of both isolated holo-b 5 (52Muskett F.W. Kelly G.P. Whitford D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 172-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and apo-b 5(53Falzone C.J. Mayer M.R. Whiteman E.L. Moore C.D. Lecomte J.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6519-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), whereas the heme-binding core 1 domain is disordered in apo-b 5 (53Falzone C.J. Mayer M.R. Whiteman E.L. Moore C.D. Lecomte J.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6519-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Furthermore, core 2 retains its overall topology during molecular dynamics simulations of apo-b 5, while core 1 loses secondary structure and exhibits conformational mobility (54Storch E.M. Daggett V. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11596-11604Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A role for b 5 as an allosteric effector protein is consistent with our observation that serine phosphorylation of P450c17 selectively increases 17,20-lyase activity (8Zhang L. Rodriguez H. Ohno S. Miller W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10619-10623Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) and that mutations of arginine residues in the redox-partner binding site of human P450c17 cause isolated 17,20-lyase deficiency (23Geller D.H. Auchus R.J. Mendonça B.B. Miller W.L. Nature Genet. 1997; 17: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The precise orientation of OR in the electron-donor docking region of P450c17 required to assemble the active oxygenating complex for the 17,20-lyase reaction is impaired by mutation of this surface and enhanced byb 5 or apo-b 5. Phosphorylation of P450c17 probably favors assembly of productive complexes so that electron transfer is more rapid and coupling efficiency is higher; however, the exact mechanism by which phosphorylated serine residues enhance 17,20-lyase activity is not yet known. A more detailed understanding of these complexes is essential for understanding the regulation of 17,20-lyase activity; this in turn may permit development of agents to inhibit this activity, which will aid in the treatment of sex steroid-dependent malignancies and disorders of androgen excess.

In vascular endothelial cells and in cardiac myocytes, the cycle of eNOS activation and deactivation is intimately coupled to the changes in intracellular Ca2+ that are promoted by stimulation of diverse G protein-coupled receptors (12Moncada S. Palmer R.M.J. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar, 13Vanhoutte P.M. Hypertension. 1989; 13: 658-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe a series of experiments that have explored the relationships between intracellular Ca2+ regulation and the dynamics of eNOS-caveolin interactions in living cells. We also document the role of eNOS palmitoylation in the reversible caveolar targeting of the eNOS-caveolin complex following muscarinic cholinergic stimulation. cDNA constructs encoding wild-type eNOS and the palmitoylation-deficient eNOS mutant (palm−) have previously been described (14Robinson L.J.

Bovine aortic endothelial cell and COS-7 cell culture conditions and cDNA transfection protocols were as described previously (2Feron O. Belhassen L. Kobzik L. Smith T.W. Kelly R.A. Michel T. J.

Transfected COS-7 cells or endothelial cells were extensively washed with phosphate-buffered saline, harvested, pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in OG buffer (60 mmol/liter OG, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 125 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm EGTA, and protease inhibitors (1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride)) and sonicated as described previously (2Feron O.

When cell fractionation was performed, cells were first lysed by sonication in a detergent-free hypotonic buffer and separated into soluble and particulate fractions by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 1 h) (9Feron O.

Aliquots of cell homogenates were incubated with a rabbit caveolin-1 polyclonal antibody (lot 5, Transduction Labs) at a final concentration of 4 μg/ml; antibody titration experiments (not shown) documented that this concentration led to quantitative immunoprecipitation (IP) of caveolin from cell lysates. The isoform specificity and lack of cross-reactivity of these antibodies have been previously established (2Feron O. Belhassen L. Kobzik L. Smith T.W. Kelly R.A. Michel T. J. Biol.

After 1 h at 4 °C, protein G-Sepharose beads (50 μl of a 50% slurry) were added to the supernatant for a further 1-h incubation at 4 °C. Bound immune complexes were washed three times with OG buffer and then once with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl. In some experiments, the supernatant fraction (remaining following pelleting of the protein G-Sepharose immune complexes) was precipitated by addition of trichloroacetic acid and buffered with a Tris-HCl solution, pH 7.4. The immunoprecipitates and/or the corresponding supernatant precipitates were then eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels, immunoblotting with eNOS or caveolin antibodies (Transduction Labs), and chemiluminescent detection protocols were performed as described previously (2Feron O. Belhassen L. Kobzik L. Smith T.W. Kelly R.A. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22810-22814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, treatment of endothelial cells with the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 leads to the dissociation of caveolin from eNOS. The fraction of eNOS that is liberated from caveolin by Ca2+ ionophore treatment can be recovered in its entirety from the supernatant fraction following the caveolin immunoprecipitation; there is no change in the recovery of caveolin in these or the other drug treatments (Fig. 1, lower panel). Following addition of the Ca2+ chelator EGTA to the ionophore-activated cells, the eNOS-caveolin complex re-forms, as shown by the quantitative immunoprecipitation of eNOS by the caveolin antibody after Ca2+ chelation (Fig. 1, lanes labeled 75). The re-formation of the inhibitory eNOS-caveolin complex may represent a mechanism whereby the enzyme can become de-activated following the return of intracellular Ca2+ to basal levels. Prolonged agonist treatment of endothelial cells leads also to the translocation of eNOS from caveolae to a soluble subcellular compartment (17Michel T. Li G.K. Busconi L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6252-6256Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 18Dudek R. Wildhirt S. Suzuki H. Winder S. Bing R.J. Pharmacology. 1995; 50: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 19Fukuda S.-I. Takaichi S. Naritomi H. Hashimoto N. Nagata I. Nozaki K. Kikuchi H. Brain Res. 1995; 696: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), but the role of caveolin in this enzyme translocation is entirely unknown. It seems plausible that this eNOS translocation represents a means for the desensitization of the enzyme upon prolonged agonist stimulation. We therefore examined the subcellular distribution of the eNOS-caveolin complex following treatment of endothelial cells with the Ca2+ ionophore. In resting endothelial cells, nearly all (>95%) of the eNOS is in the particulate subcellular fraction, and the enzyme can be almost quantitatively immunoprecipitated by antibodies directed against caveolin (Fig. 2). Following treatment of endothelial cells with Ca2+ ionophore and the consequent dissociation of the caveolin-eNOS complex, the newly liberated caveolin-free eNOS is now detected in both particulate and soluble subcellular fractions following differential ultracentrifugation. When the Ca2+ chelator EGTA is subsequently added, eNOS located in both the particulate and soluble subcellular fractions re-associates with caveolin, and the soluble complex is then re-targeted to caveolae, as shown in Fig. 2. Taken together, these data suggest a regulatory cycle in which agonist stimulation initially leads to eNOS activation by the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent disruption of the eNOS-caveolin heteromeric complex, followed later by enzyme translocation and re-formation of the inhibitory caveolin-eNOS heteromer; finally, this inactive complex is re-targeted to caveolae, ready for another round of agonist activation. Although the agonist-evoked modulation of caveolin-eNOS binding affinity may account for changes in the hydrophobicity of eNOS and explain, in part, the reversible translocation of eNOS to and from caveolae, such a mechanism also probably involves cycles of de-palmitoylation/re-palmitoylation of the enzyme. We have indeed previously reported that eNOS is targetedto plasmalemmal caveolae by palmitoylation (20Shaul P.W. Smart E.J. Robinson L.J. German Z. Yuhanna I.S. Ying Y. Anderson R.G.W. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6518-6522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar) but also that agonists promote enzyme de-palmitoylation leading to eNOS translocation from caveolae (21Robinson L.J. Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 995-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Palmitoylation is a reversible post-translational modification characteristic of diverse signaling proteins targeted to caveolae and involves the addition of the 16-carbon fatty acid palmitate to specific cysteine residues within the protein. Palmitate is attached to signaling proteins via a labile thioester bond, and for eNOS as well as some other signaling proteins, agonist activation promotes de-palmitoylation and protein translocation from caveolae (21Robinson L.J. Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 995-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 22Milligan G. Parenti M. Magee A.I. Trends Biochem.

Michel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11776-11780Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 20Shaul P.W. Smart E.J. Robinson L.J. German Z. Yuhanna I.S. Ying Y. Anderson R.G.W.

However, the membrane-associated palm−mutant is still able to bind caveolin (9Feron O. Michel J.B. Sase K. Michel T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), suggesting that this post-translational modification does not affect the eNOS-caveolin interaction per se, even if selective targeting of the palm− eNOS mutant to caveolae is impaired. We devised a series of experiments to explore further the relationships between eNOS palmitoylation, caveolin binding, and enzyme recycling following agonist activation and exploited a heterologous expression system in transiently transfected COS cells. To reconstitute the palm− eNOS mutant with a receptor-coupled eNOS pathway in COS cells, we co-transfected cDNA encoding either wild-type or palm− eNOS mutant, along with a cDNA construct encoding the m2 muscarinic cholinergic receptor (mAchR). We chose to study the m2 mAchR because (a) this receptor is well known to function in a physiologically important pathway that regulates eNOS activation in several cell types (12Moncada S.

Physiol. 1995; 429: 426-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We found that the muscarinic agonist carbachol induces the dissociation of wild-type eNOS from caveolin in COS cells co-transfected with eNOS and m2 mAchR cDNAs; this process is agonist-dependent and is blocked by the cholinergic antagonist atropine (Fig. 3 A). The carbachol-induced dissociation of the eNOS-caveolin complex shows an appropriate agonist dose dependence, with an EC50 of ∼1 μm (Fig. 3, B and C). It must be emphasized that the eNOS released from the heteromeric immune complex with caveolin is recovered in the supernatant of the immunoprecipitations, indicating that the enzyme is released and not degraded following drug treatments (as shown in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). Having validated the pharmacological characteristics of this response, we next turned to a series of time course experiments exploring the agonist-regulated association and dissociation of caveolin from wild-type and palm− eNOS using co-immunoprecipitation protocols. For the wild-type enzyme, treatment of co-transfected COS cells with carbachol led to the rapid dissociation of eNOS from caveolin; the wild-type enzyme became fully dissociated from caveolin within 5 min following the addition of carbachol, after which time the proteins were found to re-associate, with the heteromeric complex entirely reformed by 7–10 min (Fig. 4 A). Although this time course parallels that seen with receptor-mediated nitric oxide release from the vascular endothelium studied in situ (29Malinski T Taha Z. Nature. 1992; 358: 676-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar), it is difficult to directly compare the temporal sequence of these events because of the important differences in experimental conditions. For example, the NO-dependent transient hypotensive response seen following the infusion of acetylcholine in vivo is much less rapid than the cellular responses elicited by muscarinic cholinergic activation in vitro, although there is a generally similar temporal pattern (27Dell'Acqua M.L. Carroll R.C. Peralta E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5676-5685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Ishizaka N. Noda M. Kimura Y. Hashii M. Fukuda K. Katayama M. Brown D.A. Higashida H. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1995; 429: 426-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We next performed a series of identically configured time course experiments, now studying the palm− eNOS mutant instead of the wild-type enzyme. In contrast to the wild-type enzyme, even prior to agonist addition a significant fraction of the palm−mutant is found unassociated with caveolin, consistent with the mutant's impaired targeting to caveolae in the resting cell. However, after the addition of carbachol, the entire fraction of the palm− mutant that had been complexed to caveolin rapidly dissociates, and within 5 min, no heteromeric caveolin-palm− eNOS complex could be found, just as for the wild-type enzyme, and the entirety of the eNOS could be recovered in the post-immunoprecipitation supernatant (Fig. 4 B). However, at this point, the palm− eNOS mutant shows a dramatic divergence from the wild-type enzyme: the re-association of the caveolin-palm− complex is markedly delayed. In contrast to the wild-type eNOS, in which the entirety of the enzyme is recovered in a heteromeric complex within 7–10 min, the palm− mutant shows only a sluggish re-formation of the heteromer, a process delayed in its onset and barely at completion a full hour after the addition of drug. There is no substantive change in agonist-mediated Ca2+ transients (assessed using fura-2 epifluoresence) between COS cells transfected with the wild-typeversus palm− mutant eNOS (data not shown). We therefore interpret this marked divergence in the kinetics of re-formation of the heteromeric palm− eNOS-caveolin complex to reflect the essential role for re-palmitoylation in facilitating the re-targeting of eNOS to caveolae, thereby facilitating the protein-protein interactions between eNOS and caveolin that permit the heteromeric complex to re-form. In summary, we have shown for the first time in cells that the eNOS-caveolin complex can be rapidly disrupted and subsequently restored following agonist activation, associated with the reversible translocation of the enzyme. We therefore postulate the existence of a dynamic cycle of eNOS-caveolin interactions initiated by agonist-promoted increases in [Ca2+]i that disrupt the caveolin-eNOS complex, leading to enzyme activation. Following more prolonged agonist stimulation, eNOS is de-palmitoylated (21Robinson L.J. Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 995-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) and is no longer selectively sequestered in caveolae. The translocated enzyme probably partitions both into noncaveolar plasma membrane and into more hydrophilic regions of the cell, the precise identity of which has not been established. Subsequent to the enzyme's translocation into this more “soluble” cell compartment and following the decline in [Ca2+]i to basal levels, caveolin may once again interact with eNOS, leading to enzyme inhibition. The re-association of eNOS with caveolin may occur either at the membrane level or in the cytosol through which caveolin complexes may shuttle between caveolae and an internalized caveolar vesicle/trans-Golgi network (3Couet J. Li S. Okamoto T. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1997; 4: 103-110Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 30Kurzchalia T.V. Dupree P. Parton R.G. Kellner R. Virta H. Lehnert M.

Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1421-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The re-association and re-targeting of the heteromeric eNOS-caveolin complex appears to be accelerated (or stabilized) by enzyme palmitoylation, which takes place either within caveolae or en route to this organelle. The re-palmitoylation of eNOS facilitates rapid and efficient stabilization of the inactivated enzyme in the caveolar environment ready for another cycle of stimulation by agonists. This dynamic cycle of eNOS intracellular regulation adds another level of complexity to the post-translational life history of this vital signaling protein and may represent an important control point for the modulation of NO-dependent signaling in the vascular wall."

Expression of the D1 and D2 receptors for dopamine was reduced in the ventral striatum of mutant mice, and the response of double null mutant mice to cocaine, which affects dopamine signaling in the mesolimbic system, was blunted. Thus, retinoid receptors are involved in the regulation of brain functions, and retinoic acid signaling defects may contribute to pathologies such as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia."

PS-1 proteins are proteolytically processed by an unknown protease to two stable fragments of ∼30 kDa (N-terminal fragment (NTF)) and ∼20 kDa (C-terminal fragment (CTF)) (Thinakaran, G., Borchelt, D.

Fractionating proteins from 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid-extracted membrane preparations by velocity sedimentation reveal a high molecular mass SDS and Triton X-100-sensitive complex of approximately 100–150 kDa. To prove if both proteolytic fragments of PS-1 are bound to the same complex, we performed co-immunoprecipitations using multiple antibodies specific to the CTF and NTF of PS-1. These experiments revealed that both fragments of PS-1 occur as a tightly bound non-covalent complex.

In contrast, the non-cleavable, FAD-associated PS-1 Δexon 9 sediments at a molecular weight similar to that observed for the endogenous proteolytic fragments. This result may indicate that the Δexon 9 mutation generates a mutant protein that exhibits biophysical properties similar to the naturally occurring PS-1 fragments. This could explain the surprising finding that the Δexon 9 mutation is functionally active, although it cannot be proteolytically processed (Baumeister, R., Leimer, U., Zweckbronner, I., Jakubek, C., Grünberg, J., and Haass, C.

This conclusion was further supported when knock-outs of the PS-1 gene were generated in mice, since the loss of PS-1 expression resulted in a phenotype reminiscent of Notch knock-outs (24Shen J.

In contrast, expression of PS-1 lacking exon 9 due to a naturally occurring FAD causing splicing mutation (26Perez-Tur J. Froehlich S. Prihar G. Crook R. Baker M. Duff K. Wragg M. Busfield F.

Interestingly, PS proteins have been found to occur predominantly as stable C-terminal and N-terminal fragments (CTF and NTF; see Fig. 1), whereas only low levels of unclipped PS holoprotein can be detected within all cell lines and tissues analyzed to date (1Thinakaran G.

Surprisingly, mutations within the TM domains of the PS-1 NTF appear to result not only in the hyperaccumulation of the NTF by itself but also in the accumulation of the complementary CTF (4Lee M.K. Borchelt D.R. Kim G. Thinakaran G. Slunt H.H. Ratovitski T. Martin L.J. Kittur A. Gandy S. Levey A.I. Jenkins N. Copeland N. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Nat.

In this regard, it is interesting to note that overexpression of PS proteins does not result in a linear increase of fragment formation (1Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Spitzer L.

These results indicate a highly regulated mechanism that allows the accumulation of only certain levels of both fragments. Any disturbance in this regulation, such as hyperaccumulation of the PS fragments or of the unclipped PS-1 Δexon 9 protein (4Lee M.K. Borchelt D.R. Kim G. Thinakaran G. Slunt H.H. Ratovitski T.

However, nothing is known about the nature of the regulation mechanism. We have therefore analyzed whether PS-1 fragments interact with each other. We find that the NTF of PS-1 co-immunoprecipitates with the CTF. Moreover, both fragments form a 100–150-kDa complex in untransfected cells. Binding of PS fragments might therefore explain their concomitant accumulation in transgenic animals expressing mutations within the N-terminal portion of the PS protein. These results might also suggest that the highly regulated fragment formation could be due to the formation of a stoichiometric high molecular weight complex. K293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Glutamax1; Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (30Haass C. Schlossmacher M.

The cell pellet was washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then resuspended in 5 ml of RSB buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgAc2) containing protease inhibitors as described (30Haass C. Schlossmacher M. Hung A.Y. Vigo-Pelfrey C.

Gradients were centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 16 h at 4 °C in a SW40 rotor (Beckman L-70 ultracentrifuge). After centrifugation, 13 fractions of 1 ml were collected from bottom to top. Proteins were precipitated with an equal volume of 20% trichloroacetic acid, and the precipitated proteins were washed with 90% acetone.

For co-immunoprecipitation, membranes were prepared as described above and extracted either with 2% CHAPS, 1% Triton X-100, or 0.5% SDS. For SDS extraction, K+ was substituted by Na+ in the HEPES buffer. To remove undissolved membrane fragments, the extracts were pelleted by ultracentrifugation for 1 h at 100,000 × g at 4 °C.

SDS extracts were diluted 10 × prior to antibody addition; CHAPS and Triton X-100 extracts were immunoprecipitated without further dilution. Immunoprecipitations of CHAPS-extracted proteins were washed 4 × for 20 min in CHAPS washing buffer (0.5% CHAPS, 200 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6).

To determine whether PS-1 fragments occur as a complex, we analyzed membrane protein fractions from human K293 cells. In most experiments, we specifically used untransfected K293 cells to allow the analysis of endogenous PS proteins under in vivo conditions. Moreover, this cell line is highly appropriate for the analysis of the biochemistry of the FAD-associated proteins (βAPP and PS-1/PS-2), since βAPP metabolism and the effects of βAPP and PS mutations originally sorted out in K293 cells (13Citron M.

Electron microscopy of oocytes from females homozygous for either of two meiotic mutants ( mei-W68 and mei-P22 ), which eliminate both meiotic crossing over and gene conversion, revealed normal synaptonemal complex formation. Thus, synapsis in Drosophila is independent of meiotic recombination, consistent with a model in which synapsis is required for the initiation of meiotic recombination. Furthermore, the basic processes of early meiosis may have different functional or temporal relations, or both, in yeast and Drosophila ."

https://openalex.org/W2053972916,"PML, a RING finger protein with tumor suppressor activity, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute promyelocytic leukemia that arises following a reciprocal chromosomal translocation that fuses the PML gene with the retinoic acid receptor α (RARα) gene. Immunocytochemical analysis has demonstrated that PML is co-localized with a novel ubiquitin-like protein in the nuclear bodies, which could be disrupted by the PML-RARα fusion protein. The physical nature of this co-localization is unknown. Using a COS cell expression system, we show that PML is covalently modified by all three members of the sentrin family of ubiquitin-like proteins. Covalent modification of PML requires the conserved Gly residue near the C termini of sentrin proteins. Sentrinization of PML is highly specific because neither NEDD8 nor ubiquitin could modify PML. Similar specificity is also observed for the covalent modification of RanGAP1 by the sentrin member of ubiquitin-like proteins. These observations highlight the fine substrate specificity of the sentrinization pathway. In acute promyelocytic leukemia, two forms of PML-RARα fusion proteins have been reported. Remarkably, both forms of PML-RARα fusion proteins could not be sentrinized. Thus differential sentrinization of PML and PML-RARα could play an important role in regulating the biological function of PML and in the pathogenesis of acute promyelocytic leukemia."

These findings are of particular significance due to the need for new antifungal agents. The elongation phase of translation in fungi requires the soluble elongation factors EF1α, EF2, and EF3. EF1α and EF2 are members of the GTPase superfamily of proteins and are characterized by common structural motifs and their ability to alternate between conformational states in response to binding GDP or GTP. These proteins are required for translation in all eukaryotes, while EF3 is unique to fungi and essential for fungal protein synthesis (1Belfield G.P. Tuite M.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). EF2 catalyzes the translocation of the ribosome along messenger RNA, presumably by stimulating a gross rearrangement of the ribosome that results in peptidyl-tRNA transfer and the movement of mRNA by one codon. The protein sequence of EF2 has been highly conserved throughout evolution, with Saccharomyces cerevisiae EF2 sharing 66% identity and 85% homology to human EF2. Despite this high degree of similarity, a class of tetracyclic diterpene glycoside natural products, the sordarins, has now been identified as selective inhibitors of EF2 function in fungal protein synthesis. Sordarin, produced by species of the fungal genus Sordaria, was described as an antifungal agent in 1970 (2Hauser D. Sigg H.P. Helv. Chim.

In this report, we show that sordarins specifically bind to the S. cerevisiae EF2-ribosome complex and block protein synthesis by inhibiting the release of EF2 from the post-translocational ribosome. Our observations show that it is possible to inhibit fungal EF2 specifically, which may provide an opportunity for developing antifungal agents with a unique and selective mechanism of action.

Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) on SC medium (4Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Laboratory Course Manual for Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar) containing 5 μg/ml sordarin. The haploid S. cerevisiae strain YEFD12h/ pURA3-EFT1 (MATaade2 lys2 ura3 his3 leu2 trp1 eft1Δ1:HIS3 eft2 Δ:TRP1), deleted for the genomic copies of EFT1 and EFT2, and harboring the plasmid pURA3-EFT1 for viability, has been described (10Phan L.D. Perentesis J.P. Bodley J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8665-8668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Strain YEFD12h/YCpEFT2 was generated by transforming YEFD12h/ pURA3-EFT1 to leucine prototrophy with plasmid YCpEFT2, followed by eviction of the plasmid pURA3-EFT1. Strains deleted for either EFT1 or EFT2 were constructed by mating YEFD12h/pURA3-EFT1 with the strain YPH54 (MATα ade2 his3 lys2 trp1 ura3) (9Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to obtain spores with the genotype EFT1/eft2 Δ:TRP1 or EFT2/eft1Δ1:HIS3. TheEFT2 yeast expression plasmid YCpEFT2 was constructed by subcloning a 5-kilobase pair BamHI-PstI fragment of DNA that includes the native promoter and the entire EF2 coding region into plasmid Ycplac111 (11Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2522) Google Scholar). Plasmid-dependent sordarin-resistant mutants were spontaneously generated from theeft1Δ/eft2Δ deletion strain YEFD12h harboring an episomal copy of EFT1 (pEFT1URA) or EFT2(YCpEFT2). 1 × 107 and 1 × 108yeast cells were plated on SC medium containing 2% agar and sordarin at 5 μg/ml and incubated at 29 °C until colonies appeared (3–7 days). Plasmid DNA was recovered and transformed into theEscherichia coli strain DH5α (Life Technologies, Inc.) by established methods (4Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Laboratory Course Manual for Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar, 12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was prepared from E. coli using Qiaprep spin columns (Qiagen) and transformed into the yeast strains YEFD12h/pEFT1URA or YEFD12h/ YCpEFT2 to demonstrate plasmid-dependent resistance to sordarin. Plasmids that conferred resistance were sequenced with an ABI Prism 373 DNA sequencer according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Applied Biosystems). Sequences were analyzed using Sequencher DNA analysis software (Gene Codes Corp.). The mutations in the sR1 and sR2 strains were identified by sequencing the PCR products. Based on the locations of the plasmid mutations, specific regions of approximately 0.4 kilobase pairs were amplified from genomic DNA using Klentaq (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following initial identification of a mutation, five additional independent PCR reactions were performed and the products sequenced to rule out the possibility of errors due to misincorporation. Exposure of intact S. cerevisiae to low concentrations of sordarin rapidly inhibits the incorporation of [3H]threonine into proteins while having no effect on incorporation of uracil into RNA or adenine into DNA. 2J. Nielsen, unpublished results. The IC50for this effect (6 μg/ml) corresponds closely to the IC50values for growth inhibition of wild-type strains in YPAD medium. In contrast, sordarin has no effect on HeLa protein synthesis (leucine incorporation) or cell proliferation at concentrations of ≥100 μg/ml.2 In vitro translation experiments using S30 extracts of S. cerevisiae and a poly(U) message revealed that sordarin inhibits phenylalanine incorporation (IC50≈30 ng/ml) while having no effect on similar systems from rabbit reticulocyte or wheat germ at levels of up to 100 μg/ml.2Based on these findings it appears that sordarin is a specific inhibitor of protein synthesis in fungi while having no effect on other eukaryotic systems, a specificity within eukaryotes that is without precedent for known translation inhibitors. Hydrolytic cleavage of sordarin to sordarose and sordaricin abolishes activity both for inhibition of whole cell growth and for in vitro translation. However activity is restored by replacement of the sugar with a short chain alkyl ether. L-793,422 (Fig. 1 A), a sordaricin derivative with an isobutyl ether side chain, is 1000-fold more active in growth inhibition assays than sordarin (IC50 of 6 ng/ml) with the wild-type strain. A tritiated analog (2,3-ditrito-2-methyl propyl ether) of specific radioactivity high enough for a sensitive binding assay was prepared. With the addition of both Mg2+ and GTP, or the nonhydrolyzable analog GTPγS or GDP, to desalted S30 extracts, binding of [3H]L-793,422 was associated with a complex excluded by filtration through Sephadex G-75. Binding of [3H]L-793,422 is displaced by cold sordarin with an IC50 of 3 ng/ml. A Scatchard plot of binding indicated a single binding site with a K d of <3 nm. S30 extracts of wild-type yeast bound a maximum of 80 pmol/mg of protein. Resolution of the S30 extract into a soluble S100 fraction and salt-washed ribosomes showed that both ribosomes and a soluble component are necessary for the reconstitution of binding. The S100 protein was concentrated by precipitation with 70% ammonium sulfate, desalted, and subjected to anion exchange chromatography. Binding activity, reconstituted with ribosomes and GTP, was recovered in the large protein peak eluted at 0.2–0.3 m KCl. Assay of EF2 by ADP-ribosylation and of EF3 by ribosome-dependent GTPase activity showed that they overlap within this peak. When EF2 and EF3 are resolved by CM Sepharose chromatography (6Skogerson L. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 60: 676-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the soluble binding component comigrates with EF2. The ability of EF2 and ribosomes purified from rat liver and from wheat germ to bind [3H]-L793,422 in the presence of GTP was examined. In contrast to S. cerevisiae EF2, neither rat liver nor wheat germ EF2 shows any binding when tested with ribosomes from rat liver, wheat germ, or yeast. Nor does binding occur using S. cerevisiae ribosomes and either higher eukaryotic EF2. However, substantial binding is conferred by S. cerevisiae EF2 upon addition of ribosomes from either rat liver or wheat germ (Fig. 1 A). Thus EF2 is the determinant of the observed fungal specificity of sordarin. Furthermore, fungal specificity in polymerization can be demonstrated in reconstituted translation assays dependent on added purified EF2. Polyphenylalanine formation from [3H]Phe-tRNA as precursor by rat liver ribosomes plus rat liver EF1 is insensitive to sordarin when rat liver EF2 is used, but sensitive with yeast EF2. Incorporation by yeast ribosomes plus yeast EF1 and EF3 is sensitive with yeast EF2, reconstituting the sensitivity of the unfractionated system, but becomes insensitive when rat liver EF2 is used (Fig. 1 B). During the translocation cycle, GTP is bound by the EF2-ribosome complex, followed by an extremely rapid hydrolysis to EF2-GDP, and a conformational change that releases EF2 for the next round of translocation (13Czworkowski J. Moore P.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 54: 293-332Google Scholar). Fusidic acid is a universal EFG and EF2 inhibitor that inhibits translocation by stabilizing the EF2-GDP-ribosome complex (14Bodley J.W. Lin L. Salas M.L. Tao M. FEBS Lett. 1970; 11: 153-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Fusidic acid stabilization was demonstrated for the S. cerevisiaecomplex by measuring cold excess GTP exchange with prebound ring-labeled [3H]GTP to EF2 plus ribosomes. In similar experiments sordarin increases the half-life of the GDP-EF2-ribosome complex (Fig. 2), from less than 0.5 min to approximately 6 min (t½ for fusidic acid ∼10 min). Sordarin analogs that show little or no effect in vivofail to cause stabilization in vitro. Fusidic acid levels up to 5 mm fail to compete with the binding of [3H]L-793,422 to the S. cerevisiaeEF2-ribosome complex. Thus the universal binding site for fusidic acid appears not to overlap the fungal specific sordarin binding site. Genetic confirmation that fungal EF2 confers specificity to sordarin was demonstrated by analysis of mutant yeast strains resistant to sordarin. Spontaneous mutants resistant to sordarin were selected on SC medium containing 5 μg/ml sordarin, and these appeared at a frequency of approximately 1 × 10−8. Progeny from crosses of the sordarin-resistant strains sR1 and sR2 with strain YEFT2Dh (eft2Δ:TRP1) that is deleted for the genomic copy of theEFT2 gene were analyzed. Dissection of 20 tetrads from each cross showed that sordarin resistance was never associated with tryptophan prototrophy, confirming genetic linkage, and that a mutant allele of eft2 is responsible for sordarin resistance in both sR1 and sR2 strains. To facilitate determining which substitutions can result in sordarin resistance, mutants conferring plasmid-dependent resistance were spontaneously generated by plating cells on solid medium containing sordarin, usingeft1Δ/eft2Δ deletion strains that harbor an episomal copy of EFT1 or EFT2. Fifteen mutant strains were chosen that range in resistance from having an IC50 ≅ 10 μg/ml sordarin, to an IC50 ≥ 100 μg/ml (Table I). Plasmids conferring sordarin resistance were recovered, clonally purified, and sequenced. A single base change causing an amino acid substitution was identified in each clone, with the exception of pSR7, which has a three base pair deletion, resulting in the loss of G790 (Table I). Based on the locations of the mutations in the episomal copies of theEFT1 and EFT2 genes, we used PCR to amplify specific regions of EFT2 from genomic DNA prepared from the original sR1 and sR2 mutants. Single base changes that result in amino acid substitutions in each mutant were identified. The amino acid changes conferring resistance to sordarin are clustered into three regions of the EF2 protein (Fig. 3). Amino acid sequence alignment of EF2 with its prokaryotic counterpart EFG demonstrates that the EF2 substitutions are located in regions with homology to domains I, III, and IV in EFG. These domains of EFG are thought to interact with one another during GTP hydrolysis and translocation (15Jurnak F. Structure. 1994; 2: 785-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 16Czworkowski J. Wang J. Steitz T.A. Moore P.B.

EMBO J. 1994; 16: 3669-3677Crossref Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The sequence alignment also revealed that mutations in EF2 conferring resistance to sordarin are located in proximity to mutations in EFG that give rise to fusidic acid resistance (18Johanson U. Hughes D. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 143: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 19Johanson U. Evarsson A. Liljas A. Hughes D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 420-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). Since fusidic acid does not permeate yeast cells, translational sensitivity to fusidic acid was determined in S30 extracts prepared from each sordarin-resistant mutant. Many mutations that confer resistance to sordarin also confer resistance to fusidic acid (Table I), although levels of resistance to the two drugs are not closely correlated. The partial cross resistance of mutations and the proximity of mutations that confer sordarin and fusidic acid resistance in the alignment of EF2 with EFG support the biochemical evidence of mechanistic similarity of the two drugs. One or more of the EF2 residues altered in the resistant mutants may be located in the sordarin binding site, but there is not sufficient evidence, without cross-linking or other biochemical approaches, and a three-dimensional structure for EF2, to identify the binding site.Table ISummary of EF2 MutationsA.PlasmidMutationIC50SordarinFusidic acidμg/mlμmEFT1(Wild-type)0.53EFT2(Wild-type)13pSR4Y521 → S356pSR5Y521 → D6020pSR6I529 → T303pSR7G790Δ>100No polymerizationpSR8Q490 → E453pSR9P559 → L>100>200pSR11P559 → R>100100pSR12P727 → S>1003pSR13R180 → G15>200pSR15S523 → P>100>200pSR16Y521 → N2060pSR17V774 → F>1003pSR20V187 → F2010pSR26A562 → P>10015pSR27S523 → F>10020B.Genomic mutationssR1A562→P>10015sR2V187→F15200 Open table in a new tab Sordarin belongs to a class of natural products with multiple functional groups readily accessible to chemical modification. The addition of this class to the small number of known EF2 inhibitors (fusidic acid family, ADP-ribosylators, both universal for eukaryotic translocation) provides a powerful new tool for dissecting the EF2 and ribosomal sites involved in translocation. Furthermore, the ability to inhibit protein synthesis specifically in fungi with sordarin demonstrates the potential for exploiting EF2 as a target for developing novel antifungal agents at a time when resistance to current agents is increasing. These findings show that homology between essential proteins and processes in the host and pathogen does not necessarily exclude them as potential targets for selective chemotherapy.

The combinatorial expression of the LIM homeodomain proteins Isl1, Isl2, Lhx1, and Lhx3 in subsets of developing motor neurons correlates with the future organization of these neurons into motor columns with distinct innervation targets, implying a functional role for LIM homeodomain protein combinations in the specification of neuronal identity. NLI is a widely expressed, dimeric protein that has been shown to specifically interact with the LIM domains of LIM domain-containing transcription factors. The present studies demonstrate that NLI mediates homo- and heteromeric complex formation between LIM domain transcription factors, requiring both the N-terminal dimerization and C-terminal LIM interaction domains of NLI. Although the interaction between most LIM homeodomain proteins is dependent on NLI, a direct interaction between the LIM domains of Lhx3 and the homeodomains of Isl1 and Isl2 was also observed. This interaction was disrupted by NLI, demonstrating that the conformational state of Lhx3-Isl1/Isl2 complexes is modified by NLI. Evidence indicating that NLI facilitates long range enhancer-promoter interactions suggests that NLI-dependent LIM domain transcription factor complexes are involved in communication between transcriptional control elements.

The LIM domain transcription factor family includes LIM homeodomain proteins, which consist of two N-terminal LIM domains and a C-terminal DNA-binding homeodomain, and LIM-only (LMO) 1The abbreviations used are: LMO, LIM-only; HA, hemagglutinin; IP, immunoprecipitation; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; LID, LIM interaction domain; MMCm, medial subdivision of the median motor column. proteins, which contain little more than two LIM domains (for review see Refs. 1Dawid I.B.

Studies investigating the role of LIM homeodomain proteins in neuronal development have largely focused on motor neuron differentiation, for which expression of the LIM homeobox gene Isl1 is required (3Pfaff S.L. Mendelsohn M. Stewart C.L. Edlund T. Jessell T.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 309-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Along with Isl1, the LIM homeodomain proteins Isl2, Lhx1, and Lhx3 show overlapping patterns of expression in developing motor neurons, which are located in the ventral, postmitotic region of the spinal cord (8Tsuchida T. Ensini M. Morton S.B. Baldassare M. Edlund T. Jessell T.M. Pfaff S.L. Cell. 1994; 79: 957-970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the combinatorial expression patterns of these four proteins in subsets of developing motor neurons correlates with the future organization of these neurons into specific motor columns that innervate distinct targets. Because the expression of these factors precedes the organization of motor columns and axonal migration, the combinatorial pattern of LIM homeodomain gene expression appears to play a functional role in the specification of motor neuron identity. The combinatorial expression of other LIM domain transcription factors may similarly dictate neuronal identity and axonal pathway selection in the development of interneurons and commissural neurons, which are located dorsal to the motor neurons in the neural tube, and of sensory neurons located in the dorsal root ganglia. Indeed, theDrosophila LIM homeodomain protein apterous has been demonstrated to mediate axonal pathway selection of embryonic interneurons (10Lundgren S.E. Callahan C.A. Thor S. Thomas J.B. Development. 1995; 121: 1769-1773PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that LIM domain transcription factors regulate the expression of cell surface molecules involved in axon fasciculation and pathfinding (10Lundgren S.E. Callahan C.A. Thor S. Thomas J.B. Development. 1995; 121: 1769-1773PubMed Google Scholar, 14Tosney K.W. Hotary K.B. Lance-Jones C. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, neuron-specific gene targets for the LIM homeodomain proteins have not yet been identified, and little is understood about the biochemical basis for the proposed LIM homeodomain combinatorial code for neuronal identity. NLI (Ldb1), a recently identified nuclear protein, binds with high affinity to the LIM domains of all LIM homeodomain and nuclear LMO proteins but not to cytoplasmic LIM domain-containing proteins (15Jurata L.W.

Although widely expressed, highest levels of NLI protein are found in postmitotic cells of the embryonic neural tube and in other regions of the developing central nervous system, significantly overlapping the expression patterns of many LIM domain transcription factors (15Jurata L.W. Kenny D.A. Gill G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11693-11698Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The functional domains of NLI include an N-terminal homodimerization domain and a C-terminal LIM interaction domain (16Jurata L.W. Gill G.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5688-5698Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that NLI forms a tetrameric complex with the LIM homeodomain protein Lmx1.1, in which each NLI molecule of an NLI homodimer interacts independently with an Lmx1.1 molecule (16Jurata L.W. Gill G.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5688-5698Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we sought to determine if NLI is capable of mediating interactions between heterologous LIM domain transcription factors in an effort to understand the biochemical basis for the motor neuron combinatorial code. The Lmx1.1, Lhx1, and Lhx3 cDNA clones were generous gifts from M. German, W. Shawlot, and H. Westphal. The LMO2 and NLI cDNAs were isolated previously (15Jurata L.W. Kenny D.A. Gill G.N. Proc. Natl.

Similar double immunoprecipitation experiments to those described for the previous figures were performed except that only two proteins (a FLAG and an HA-epitope tagged) were cotranslated for lanes 1–6. In lane 7, untagged NLI was additionally cotranslated from pcDNA3L, and the reaction volume was correspondingly increased.

Okayama H. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology.

Nuclei were prepared as described previously (16Jurata L.W. Gill G.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5688-5698Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and then lysed in 100 μl of RIPA buffer containing 200 μg/ml ethidium bromide and diluted to 1 ml with FLAG lysis buffer. After shearing, clarified extracts were subjected to the double immunoprecipitation procedure described above. Binding was visualized by 10% SDS-PAGE and fluorography, with 24 h of exposure at −70 °C. For Western blotting, nuclear extracts from unlabeled, parallel transfections were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-FLAG/anti-HA (HA.11) and anti-NLI (4508) antibodies (15Jurata L.W. Kenny D.A. Gill G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11693-11698Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). To determine if NLI is capable of mediating homodimeric and heterodimeric association between LIM homeodomain proteins, a double immunoprecipitation procedure that allows visualization of protein-protein interactions between similarly sized species was used. This method has been utilized in the past to illustrate the ability of NLI to form homodimers (16Jurata L.W. Gill G.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5688-5698Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In the assay, FLAG epitope-tagged, HA epitope-tagged, and untagged proteins were cotranslated in vitro, after which complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies. Following denaturation of the complexes, coprecipitating HA-tagged proteins were isolated with anti-HA antibodies and visualized by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Thus, this assay allows evaluation of direct interactions occurring between FLAG and HA-tagged proteins as well as indirect interactions occurring through an untagged protein. The cell free system also provides an efficient means for producing and labeling LIM domain proteins in a eukaryotic environment, avoiding the insolubility and misfolding problems that occur when LIM domain transcription factors are produced in Escherichia coli. In addition, because all cell lines thus far tested have been shown to express NLI (15Jurata L.W. Kenny D.A. Gill G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11693-11698Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar,16Jurata L.W. Gill G.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5688-5698Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) 2L. W.

DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 1163-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), this in vitro system provides a sensitive method for investigating interactions between relatively pure proteins. Because Isl1 is expressed in all pancreatic Islet cell types (22Dong J. Asa S.L. Drucker D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1633-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 25Thor S. Ericson J. Brannstrom T. Edlund T. Neuron. 1991; 7: 881-889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) and Lmx1.1 has similarly been shown to be expressed in pancreatic Islet cells (26German M.S. Wang J. Chadwick R.B. Rutter W.J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2165-2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), the ability of these LIM homeodomain proteins to form NLI-mediated homo- and heterodimers was examined (Fig. 1). Although FLAG-Isl1 and HA-Isl1 were incapable of interacting directly with one another (Fig. 1, lane 1), the addition of untagged NLI to the binding reaction allowed coprecipitation of HA-Isl1 with FLAG-Isl1 (Fig. 1, lane 2). Likewise, FLAG-Lmx1.1 and HA-Lmx1.1 were only capable of interacting with each other in the presence of NLI (Fig. 1, lanes 5 and 6). Similarly, heterodimeric association between FLAG-Isl1 and HA-Lmx1.1 depended on the presence of NLI (Fig. 1, lanes 9 and 10). NLI has been shown to be coexpressed and associated with Isl1 in the Tu6 pancreatic tumor cell line (16Jurata L.W. Gill G.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5688-5698Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), suggesting that the NLI-dependent interaction observed between Isl1 and Lmx1.1 is likely to represent a physiologically significant complex found in the endocrine cells of the pancreas. If the NLI-dependent association between two LIM domain transcription factors results from the simultaneous binding of an NLI homodimer to two LIM domain proteins, both the homodimerization domain (amino acids 1–200) and LIM interaction domain (LID) (amino acids 300–338) of NLI (16Jurata L.W. Gill G.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5688-5698Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) should be required for this effect. Indeed, deletion of either the dimerization domain or the LID was sufficient to prevent the NLI-dependent association between LIM domain proteins (Fig. 1, lanes 3, 4, 7, 8, 11, and 12). The dimerization domain deletion mutant binds LIM domains as efficiently as full-length NLI, and the LID deletion mutant is capable of homodimerization (16Jurata L.W. Gill G.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5688-5698Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Reduced signal intensity of the dimerization domain deletion in the translation reaction results from less efficient labeling of this protein compared with full-length NLI due to fewer methionine residues rather than decreased protein expression. Thus, through its ability to simultaneously homodimerize and bind monomerically to LIM domains in the formation of a tetrameric complex, NLI mediates the indirect association between LIM domain transcription factors. Because motor neuron subtypes express combinations of the LIM homeodomain proteins Isl1, Isl2, Lhx1, and Lhx3 (8Tsuchida T. Ensini M. Morton S.B. Baldassare M. Edlund T. Jessell T.M. Pfaff S.L. Cell. 1994; 79: 957-970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar), we investigated whether NLI was also capable of mediating interactions between these factors. NLI-dependent association between FLAG-Lhx1 and HA-Lhx1 was demonstrated (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1 and 2). Likewise, NLI-dependent heterodimerization was clearly evident between Isl1 and Lhx1, Isl2 and Lhx1, and Isl2 and Isl1 (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3–8). A minor amount of NLI protein, which migrates at approximately 50 kDa, can also be seen in the double immunoprecipitation panel and results from the coprecipitation of partially renatured NLI with HA-tagged LIM proteins. We have previously shown that the highest levels of NLI protein in the developing embryo are found in the postmitotic cells of the neural tube, including the motor neurons, and that NLI is coexpressed with Isl1 early in motor neuron development (15Jurata L.W. Kenny D.A. Gill G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11693-11698Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Thus it is likely that the NLI-dependent complexes of LIM homeodomain proteins demonstrated in vitro also occur in vivo. The LIM-only protein LMO2 was also capable of interacting with Isl1 in the presence of NLI (Fig. 2 A, lanes 9 and 10). LMO2 is widely expressed in the embryo including the central nervous system (13Foroni L. Boehm T. White L. Forster A. Sherrington P. Liao X.B. Brannan C.I. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Rabbitts T.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 747-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and expression of the closely related LMO1 is restricted to the ventral postmitotic cells of the brain and spinal cord during embryonic development (11Greenberg J.M. Boehm T. Sofroniew M.V. Keynes R.J. Barton S.C. Norris M.L. Surani M.A. Spillantini M.G. Rabbitts T.H. Nature. 1990; 344: 158-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 13Foroni L. Boehm T.

Spillantini M.G. Sofroniew M.V. Surani M.A. Rabbitts T.H. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 695-703PubMed Google Scholar). Intriguingly, Isl1 is also expressed in the thymus (23Dandoy-Dron F. Deltour L. Monthioux E. Bucchini D. Jami J. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 209: 58-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), where overexpression of LMO1 and LMO2 results in leukemogenesis (28McGuire E.A. Rintoul C.E. Sclar G.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4186-4196Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 29Fisch P. Boehm T. Lavenir I. Larson T. Arno J. Forster A. Rabbitts T.H. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2389-2397PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that an NLI-dependent complex between Isl1 and LMO proteins may play a role in the development of cancer by misdirecting T cell development. Thus, although LIM-only proteins lack a DNA binding homeodomain, they are able to interact with other LIM homeodomain proteins through NLI dimers. This result explains a previous observation that the LIM domains of Isl1 were capable of redirecting the subcellular localization of LMO1 when these proteins were coexpressed in cells (30Arber S. Caroni P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Because direct LIM-LIM interactions were not observed in our study, the apparent LIM-LIM interactions observedin situ were most likely a consequence of NLI-mediated complex formation. Next we evaluated the ability of the LIM homeodomain protein Lhx3 to interact with other LIM homeodomain proteins expressed in the developing nervous system (Fig. 2 B). Although NLI was required for the formation of Lhx3-Lhx3 homodimers, Lhx1-Lhx3 heterodimers, and Lmx1.1-Lhx3 heterodimers (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1–6), a direct NLI-independent interaction between Lhx3 and the related proteins Isl1 and Isl2 was observed (Fig. 2 B, lanes 7 and 9). Significantly, Lhx3 and Isl1 are coexpressed early in the development of most motor neurons, 3S. L. Pfaff, unpublished observations. and Lhx3, Isl1, and Isl2 are later coexpressed specifically in the developing neurons of the medial subdivision of the median motor column (MMCm) (8Tsuchida T. Ensini M. Morton S.B. Baldassare M. Edlund T. Jessell T.M. Pfaff S.L. Cell. 1994; 79: 957-970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar) that eventually innervate the axial muscles (14Tosney K.W. Hotary K.B. Lance-Jones C. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In addition, coexpression of the homologues of the Lhx3 and the Islet genes in motor neuron subsets is conserved in Drosophila and zebrafish, suggesting that the direct interaction between Lhx3 and Isl1/Isl2 may be evolutionarily conserved (31Appel B. Korzh V. Glasgow E. Thor S. Edlund T. Dawid I.B. Eisen J.S. Development. 1995; 121: 4117-4125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 4J. Thomas and S. Thor, personal communication. Aside from motor neurons, Lhx3 and Isl1 are coexpressed in the anterior pituitary, retina, and pineal gland (22Dong J. Asa S.L. Drucker D.J. Mol.

A. 1995; 92: 2720-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), indicating that the interaction between these proteins may occur in additional physiological environments. To investigate the determinants of the direct interaction between Lhx3 and Isl1, deletion mutants of both proteins were tested using the double immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 3). The direct interaction between Lhx3 and Isl1 was of comparable affinity to the interaction between Lhx3 and NLI (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 2). Deletion of the LIM domain-containing N terminus of Isl1 did not affect the interaction with Lhx3 (Fig. 3, lane 3). However, deletion of the N terminus of Lhx3, which contains an alternatively spliced 32-amino acid leader sequence (33Zhadanov A.B. Bertuzzi S. Taira M. Dawid I.B. Westphal H. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 202: 354-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and the LIM domains, completely abolished the Lhx3-Isl1 interaction (Fig. 3, lane 4), suggesting that the N-terminal LIM domains of Lhx3 interact with the homeodomain-containing C terminus of Isl1. In agreement, the N-terminal 153 amino acids of Lhx3 as well as the LIM domains alone were sufficient to provide interaction with the Isl1 C terminus (Fig. 3, lanes 5 and 6). The LIM domains of Isl1 were incapable of interacting with Lhx3, and the Lhx3-Isl1 interaction was completely abolished by dissection of the Isl1 C terminus into the homeodomain and the recently defined Islet-specific domain (35Thor S. Thomas J.B. Neuron. 1997; 18: 397-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Therefore, it appears that both the highly conserved homeodomain and Islet-specific domain of Islet family members are required for binding to the Lhx3 LIM domains. Of interest, the LIM domains of Lhx3 have also been shown to interact with the POU-specific domain and homeodomain of the pituitary transcription factor Pit-1 (34Bach I. Rhodes S.J. Pearse R.V., II Heinzel T. Gloss B. Scully K.M. Sawchenko P.E. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2720-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), suggesting that the LIM domains of Lhx3 may be specialized for interaction with certain homeodomain elements. LIM domain specificity is apparent because Lmx1.1, Lhx1, Isl1, Isl2, and LMO2 were all incapable of interacting with Isl1 and Isl2 in the absence of NLI (Figs. 1 and 2 A). Homeodomain specificity also clearly exists because Lhx3 was not able to interact directly with itself, Lhx1, or Lmx1.1 (Fig. 2 B). The effect of NLI on the direct interaction between Lhx3 and Isl1 was evaluated by the addition of untagged NLI to the FLAG-Lhx3 LIMs and HA-Isl1 C terminus binding reaction. NLI potently inhibited the Lhx3-Isl1 direct interaction, suggesting that NLI competes with the Isl1 C terminus for interaction with the LIM domains of Lhx3 (Fig. 3, lane 7). Indeed, the transition from a direct interaction between Isl2 and Lhx3 to an indirect NLI-dependent interaction is also evident in lanes 7 and 8 of Fig. 2 B and less clearly in the interactions between Isl1 and Lhx3 in lanes 9 and 10 of Fig. 2 B. Thus, Lhx3 can either interact directly with Isl1 or Isl2 or interact indirectly with these proteins through NLI; which complex is formed is likely to be dictated by the relative amount of NLI expressed in the cell. Interactions between LIM transcription factors were also evaluatedin vivo. Cotransfected FLAG-Lmx1.1 and HA-Isl1 were capable of interacting even in the absence of transfected NLI (Fig. 4, lane 1), suggesting that these proteins utilize endogenously expressed NLI to form a complex in 293 cells. Of interest, overexpression of NLI diminished Lmx1.1-Isl1 complex formation (Fig. 4, lane 2), presumably by diluting out the LIM proteins with excess NLI, thereby preventing tetrameric complex formation. The exact stoichiometry of NLI-LIM proteins is thus critical for formation of the tetrameric complex, and precise regulation of the expression levels of each protein throughout developmental processes is likely to dictate whether or not tetrameric complexes are formed and which LIM proteins are incorporated into such complexes. As expected, deletion of the LIM domains of Isl1 prevented interaction between Lmx1.1 and Isl1 (Fig. 4, lane 3). Although incapable of interacting with Lmx1.1, the Isl1 C terminus interacted strongly with full-length Lhx3. In this experiment, a significant amount of FLAG-Lhx3 renatured and coprecipitated with the HA-Isl1 C terminus. As demonstrated in vitro, the Lhx3-Isl1 C terminus interaction was dependent on the LIM domains of Lhx3 (Fig. 4, lanes 4 versus 5). Curiously, the phosphorylation state of the Isl1 C terminus appeared to be altered by the coexpression of full-length Lhx3 (Fig. 4, top panel, lanes 3–5). A higher proportion of the slower migrating component of the Isl1 C terminus doublet was observed when unbound to Lhx3, suggesting that interaction with Lhx3 blocks a major phosphorylation site in Isl1. Multiple phosphorylated forms of full-length Isl1 have previously been observed in vivo (16Jurata L.W. Gill G.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5688-5698Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The Drosophila homologue of NLI (Chip) has recently been identified as a gene capable of facilitating enhancer-promoter interactions over very long distances (85 kilobases), mediating expression of both the cut and Ultrabithoraxgenes (36Morcillo P. Rosen C. Baylies M.K. Dorsett D. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2729-2740Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Although the role of LIM domain transcription factors in this function has not been established, Chip interacts both physically and genetically with the Drosophila LIM homeodomain protein apterous. The very high level of conservation between NLI and Chip suggests that NLI may also be capable of mediating long range interactions, potentially by bridging an enhancer-bound LIM domain transcription factor and a promoter-bound LIM domain transcription factor (Fig. 5 A). By recruiting the enhancer to within close proximity of the promoter, additional enhancer-bound factors may help to activate transcription, or enhancer-associated histone acetylases may destabilize chromatin structure in the promoter region, allowing access to other positive regulatory factors (37Wade P.A. Pruss D. Wolffe A.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 128-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Because LIM domain transcription factors show little transcriptional activity in the absence of other proteins (26German M.S. Wang J. Chadwick R.B. Rutter W.J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2165-2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar,34Bach I. Rhodes S.J. Pearse R.V., II Heinzel T. Gloss B. Scully K.M. Sawchenko P.E. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2720-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) and because NLI shows no intrinsic transcriptional activity (16Jurata L.W. Gill G.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5688-5698Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar),2 it is probable that such additional factors are necessary to activate gene transcription. One apparent exception to the NLI dependence of LIM transcription factor association is the direct interaction observed between Lhx3 and Isl1/Isl2. This interaction appears to be a special case, although our experiments did not exhaustively test every possible combination of LIM domain transcription factors. The LIM homeodomain protein Lhx4 (Gsh-4) is highly related to Lhx3 (38Li H. Witte D.P. Branford W.W. Aronow B.J. Weinstein M. Kaur S. Wert S. Singh G. Schreiner C.M. Whitsett J.A. Scott Jr., W.J. Potter S.S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2876-2885Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 39Yamashita T. Moriyama K. Sheng H.Z. Westphal H. Genomics. 1997; 44: 144-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and is coexpressed with Lhx3 throughout motor neuron development.3 However, evaluation of whether the LIM domains of Lhx4 are also capable of interacting directly with Isl1 and Isl2 awaits the isolation of a full-length Lhx4 cDNA. In the presence of NLI, NLI-containing complexes appear to be preferential to the direct Lhx3-Isl1/Isl2 complex. We have previously described a similar effect of NLI in which NLI disrupted the transcriptional synergy between Lmx1.1 and E47 from the rat insulin I mini-enhancer by competing with E47 for direct interaction with the LIM domains of Lmx1.1 (16Jurata L.W. Gill G.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5688-5698Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 40Johnson J.D. Zhang W. Rudnick A. Rutter W.J. German M.S. Mol Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 3488-3496Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In addition, it is possible that phosphorylation of the Isl1 C terminus blocks the interaction between Isl1 and Lhx3, further promoting the formation of NLI-dependent complexes. Alternatively, the Lhx3-Isl1 interaction may prevent Isl1 phosphorylation, thereby affecting Isl1 activity in some way. Due to the superficial resemblance of the Lhx3-Isl1/2 interaction to the Lhx3-Pit-1 interaction that results in transcriptional synergy from pituitary-specific promoters (34Bach I. Rhodes S.J. Pearse R.V., II Heinzel T. Gloss B. Scully K.M. Sawchenko P.E. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2720-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that the direct interaction between Lhx3 and the Islet proteins occurs at a local DNA level and results in transcriptional synergy. The regulation of NLI levels, either through transcriptional or translational control or subcellular relocalization, might therefore be involved in a molecular switch between short range and long range interactions (Fig. 5 B). Such a switch might occur at a particular time in development and significantly affect which genes are transcribed in cells coexpressing Lhx3 and Isl1/Isl2. Indeed, there is evidence that Isl1, Lhx3, and Lhx4 may have both early and late functions in motor neuron development. Lhx3 and Lhx4 are expressed in motor neuron precursor cells prior to the onset of Isl1 expression and then coexpressed with Isl1 after the final cell division, implying a general role for these factors in motor neuron development.3 Later, Lhx3 and Lhx4 expression is down-regulated in all but the MMCm neurons, which maintain Isl1 expression and up-regulate Isl2 expression, at which time these factors are likely to be involved in determining neuronal subtype identity and directing axon guidance (8Tsuchida T. Ensini M. Morton S.B. Baldassare M. Edlund T. Jessell T.M. Pfaff S.L. Cell. 1994; 79: 957-970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). It will be important, therefore, to investigate the exact timing of the onset of NLI expression in developing motor neurons to determine when NLI-dependent and NLI-independent complexes between Lhx3 and Isl1/Isl2 are likely to exist. The current studies suggest that NLI-dependent and NLI-independent complexes between LIM domain transcription factors are involved in the proposed LIM homeodomain combinatorial code for the specification of motor neuron identity. Because nearly all postmitotic neurons of the developing neural tube express NLI (15Jurata L.W. Kenny D.A. Gill G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11693-11698Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and various combinations of LIM domain transcription factors (8Tsuchida T. Ensini M. Morton S.B. Baldassare M. Edlund T. Jessell T.M. Pfaff S.L. Cell. 1994; 79: 957-970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar, 9Tanabe Y. Jessell T.M. Science. 1996; 274: 1115-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar), it is likely that these factors and the complexes they form are involved in the specification of neuronal identity for sensory, commissural, and interneurons, in addition to motor neurons. However, to evaluate the molecular significance of NLI-LIM domain transcription factor complexes, neuron-specific gene targets for LIM domain transcription factors must be identified. We thank Dale Dorsett, John Thomas, and Stefan Thor for sharing unpublished data and Don van Meyel for insightful discussion."

Highest homology (36% identity, 57% positives) was found with human Rap-2b, followed closely by a number of other Ras subfamily members, suggesting that Dexras1 is probably a member of the Ras subfamily of GTPases (members include Ras and Rap). Dexras1is the first Ras superfamily member identified that is induced in response to steroids. The function of this gene is unknown; however, its wide distribution and rapid induction by Dex suggests the possibility of a role in glucocorticoid action in a variety of tissues. Differential display was used to identify a new Ras superfamily gene (Dexras1) induced by dexamethasone (Dex) in AtT-20 cells. Treatment of AtT-20 cells with Dex for 30 min resulted in increased mRNA for Dexras1; the highest concentrations appeared after 2 h of treatment.

The intracellular mechanism mediating glucocorticoid inhibition of stimulated corticotropin (ACTH) 1The abbreviations used are: ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; Dex, dexamethasone; GEF, guanine-nucleotide exchange factor; GAP, GTPase-activating protein. release from the corticotrophs in the anterior pituitary gland in the early time domain is unknown. Exposure of corticotrophs to glucocorticoids for periods ranging from approximately 10 min to 3 h (early time domain) inhibits ACTH secretion induced by a variety of secretagogues, including corticotropin-releasing hormone and arginine vasopressin (1Shipston M.J. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1995; 6: 261-266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Results of several studies indicate that the inhibitory effect in this time domain is mediated through induction of new protein synthesis, because this suppression can be blocked by inhibitors of transcription and translation (1Shipston M.J. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1995; 6: 261-266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 2Woods M.D. Shipston M.J. Mullens E.L. Antoni F.A. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2873-2880Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Several proteins have been proposed as mediating feedback (1Shipston M.J. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1995; 6: 261-266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar); however, it is presently unclear if they are involved in the process. Differential display is a method for identifying and cloning induced genes (3Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4700) Google Scholar). The method involves synthesis of cDNA from mRNA by reverse transcription followed by PCR amplification of 3′-termini of the cDNA fragments using combinations of downstream (oligo(dT)) and upstream arbitrary primers. The labeled, amplified fragments are separated on polyacrylamide gels, and induced fragments are identified by comparison with bands originating from RNA isolated from noninduced cells or tissues. In an attempt to identify the gene(s) and protein(s) mediating early feedback, we used differential display to isolate dexamethasone (Dex)-induced genes in AtT-20 cells. These mouse-derived corticotroph tumor cells have been shown to be an appropriate model for study of feedback regulation of ACTH secretion (2Woods M.D. Shipston M.J. Mullens E.L. Antoni F.A. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2873-2880Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 4Clark T.P. Kemppainen R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: R463-R469PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was collected from AtT-20/D16–16 cells cultured using standard methods (4Clark T.P. Kemppainen R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: R463-R469PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in 75-cm2 flasks and treated either with Dex at 100 nm for 2–24 h or with an equivalent volume of ethanol (vehicle). RNA was collected using phenol/guanidine isothiocyanate (TRIzol, Life Technologies, Inc.) and was treated with DNase I to remove chromosomal DNA. Differential display was performed using the RNAimage system (GenHunter, Nashville, TN) using combinations of three one-base-anchored oligo(dT) primers (-G, -A, and -C) and 80 upstream primers for PCR. 33P-Labeled PCR products were separated on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and subjected to autoradiography. Unique cDNAs originating from Dex-treated cells were cut from the dried gel, eluted from the blotting paper by boiling in water, and precipitated and washed using sodium acetate and ethanol. The cDNAs were reamplified by PCR using the same set of primers and cloned into the pCR-TRAP plasmid (GenHunter). A directional cDNA library was constructed in the λZipLox vector (Life Technologies, Inc.) using poly(A)+ RNA obtained from AtT-20 cells treated for 2 h with 100 nm Dex. The library was screened using standard hybridization methods with random prime labeled cDNA. Northern blots were performed using 2–5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA (Poly(A)Tract System, Promega, Madison, WI) loaded onto formaldehyde containing agarose gels. RNA was transferred to charged nylon membranes (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) by capillary transfer. Membranes were hybridized (42 °C) with random prime labeled cDNA for 12–16 h and then washed with 1 × saline sodium citrate with 0.1% SDS twice for 15 min at 25 °C, followed by two washes with 0.25 × saline sodium citrate containing 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 60 °C. Autoradiographs were prepared exposing membranes to BioMax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY) for 0.5–4 days. The gene was sequenced using Thermo Sequenase radiolabeled terminator cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Life Science). Male Hsd:ICR mice (30–35 g) were injected intraperitoneally with Dex (10 μg/mouse) or an equivalent volume of vehicle. 1 h later, mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and killed by exsanguination. Liver, heart, brain (excluding pituitary), and kidneys were collected and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA was obtained as described above for Northern analysis. One cDNA was identified using differential display (from screening 240 primer combinations) that was strongly and consistently induced by Dex (replicated in three experiments) in AtT-20 cells (Fig. 1). The induced band was excised from the gel and reamplified by PCR using the same primer set, and the resulting band (approximately 260 base pairs) was cloned into pCR-TRAP. Ten clones were partially sequenced and were found to represent three different cDNAs. Representative cDNAs from each clone type were excised from the plasmid and used to probe Northern blots containing poly(A)+ RNA from vehicle and Dex-treated AtT-20 cells. Hybridization with one of the three cDNAs identified a 1.6-kilobase pair band strongly induced by Dex (Fig. 2 A).Figure 2A, Northern analysis showing mRNA band induced by Dex treatment in AtT-20 cells.

Several positive clones were identified, and two were selected for sequencing. The nucleotide sequence and deduced protein sequence are shown in Fig. 3. Comparison of the deduced protein (Dexras1) to the Swiss Protein data base using gapped BLAST analysis (5Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59926) Google Scholar) showed the highest homology to a variety of Ras superfamily members. The highest homology was to human Rap-2b (36% identity, 57% positives, over 180 amino acids) followed closely by a large number of Ras-related proteins. The deduced Dexras1 protein shows several conserved regions specific to members of the Ras superfamily. Alignment analysis (Fig. 4) of Dexras1 with human Rap-2b and human R-Ras (37% identity, 54% positives, over 172 amino acids) showed the highest homology over a core of amino acids, extending approximately from amino acids 28 to 188 of Dexras1 between the three proteins. At a predicted length of 280 amino acids, Dexras1 is considerably longer than Rap-2b or R-Ras (and most other Ras subfamily members).Figure 4Alignment analysis (Clustal method, Lasergene Software, DNASTAR Inc.) of Dexras1, human Rap-2b (GenBank™ accession number ), and human R-Ras (GenBank™ accession number ).

H, human.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To evaluate distribution of the gene, tissues were collected from mice treated with Dex or vehicle. Northern analysis showed Dexras1 expression in multiple tissues and strong mRNA induction following Dex treatment (Fig. 2 B). A time course study (Fig. 2 C) using poly(A)+ RNA from AtT-20 cells treated with Dex for varying periods showed that the steroid inducedDexras1 mRNA within 30 min of exposure (earliest time studied) with the highest induction occurring at 2 h. TheDexras1 signal gradually diminished over the period from 4 to 24 h, despite the continued presence of Dex. A final experiment (data not shown) determined if the gene is transcriptionally induced by Dex. Pretreatment of AtT-20 cells with an inhibitor of transcription (5,6-dichlorobenzimidizole riboside), but not with an inhibitor of translation (puromycin) (2Woods M.D. Shipston M.J. Mullens E.L. Antoni F.A. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2873-2880Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 4Clark T.P. Kemppainen R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: R463-R469PubMed Google Scholar), totally blocked the ability of Dex to induce Dexras1 mRNA. Differential display was used to identify a new Ras superfamily member, Dexras1, which was rapidly induced by glucocorticoids (Dex) in AtT-20 cells. The induction appears to be mediated at the transcriptional level. The gene is expressed in several tissues in mice, and interestingly, its expression appears to be regulated positively by Dex in these tissues. The Dexras1 gene is, to our knowledge, the first member of the Ras superfamily that is induced in response to glucocorticoids specifically or steroids in general. A relatively newly described subfamily within the Ras superfamily consisting of Rad, Gem, Kir, and Rem is unique in that its members are also transcriptionally regulated (6Maguire J. Santoro T. Jensen P. Siebenlist U. Yewdell J. Kelly K. Science. 1994; 265: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 7Finlin B.S. Andres D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21982-21988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). For example, the Gem gene was induced by mitogen treatment of T cells (6Maguire J. Santoro T. Jensen P. Siebenlist U. Yewdell J. Kelly K. Science. 1994; 265: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), whereas Rem expression was repressed in several tissues in mice following lipopolysaccharide treatment (7Finlin B.S. Andres D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21982-21988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The activity of most Ras proteins is modified by other regulatory proteins including guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which enhance the release of GDP bound to Ras and the rate of GTPase hydrolysis, respectively (8Kjeldgaard M. Nyborg J. Clark B.F.C. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1347-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Because Ras proteins act as molecular switches, active when GTP is bound and inactive when GDP is bound, GEFs and GAPs serve important roles in controlling Ras protein activity (8Kjeldgaard M. Nyborg J. Clark B.F.C. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1347-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 9Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2690) Google Scholar). It is apparent from data related to the Rad/Gem/Kir/Rem subfamily and now Dexras1 that an additional level of regulation is present for some Ras superfamily members. Specifically, extracellular signals can alter the expression of genes for these molecules and likely affect intracellular concentrations of their proteins. In addition, regulatory proteins such as GEFs and GAPs likely exist to affect their activity as well (10Zhu J. Reynet C. Caldwell J.S. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4805-4812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The deduced structure of the Dexras1 protein contains several characteristic Ras superfamily motifs, including the phosphate/magnesium binding regions GXXXXGK(S/T) (the P-loop) and DXXG and the guanine base binding loops NKXD and EXSAK (9Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2690) Google Scholar, 11Valencia A. Chardin P. Wittinghofer A. Sander C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4637-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The motif regions G-1 through G-5, characteristic of GTPases (9Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2690) Google Scholar), are present in Dexras1. In addition, the C terminus has a typical CAAX motif (9Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2690) Google Scholar, 11Valencia A. Chardin P. Wittinghofer A. Sander C.

Trans. 1996; 24: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In Ras family members, this C-terminal region characteristically undergoes prenylation (in this case, farnesylation), involving addition of a hydrophobic farnesyl group to the cysteine and removal of the three C-terminal amino acids (11Valencia A. Chardin P. Wittinghofer A. Sander C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4637-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 12Del Villar K. Dorin D. Sattler I. Urano J. Poullet P. Robinson N. Mitsuzawa H. Tamanoi F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This process is necessary for membrane localization of many Ras proteins (12Del Villar K. Dorin D. Sattler I. Urano J. Poullet P. Robinson N. Mitsuzawa H. Tamanoi F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 13Zerial M. Huber L.A. Guidebook to the Small GTPases. Oxford University Press, New York1995Google Scholar). The Ras superfamily of small GTPases currently consists of six subfamilies: Ras, Rho, Rab, Ran, ARF, and Rad/Gem/Kir (7Finlin B.S. Andres D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21982-21988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 13Zerial M. Huber L.A. Guidebook to the Small GTPases. Oxford University Press, New York1995Google Scholar). Rap is considered a member of the Ras subfamily (13Zerial M. Huber L.A. Guidebook to the Small GTPases. Oxford University Press, New York1995Google Scholar). By virtue of motif and BLAST comparison, Dexras1 appears most closely related to members of the Ras subfamily. However, the predicted length of the Dexras1 protein (280 amino acids) is longer than most Ras subfamily members (180–220 amino acids) (13Zerial M. Huber L.A. Guidebook to the Small GTPases. Oxford University Press, New York1995Google Scholar), and amino acid differences exist between Dexras1 and typical Ras subfamily members within some of the GTPase characteristic motifs (e.g. in regions G-2 and G-3) (9Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2690) Google Scholar, 11Valencia A. Chardin P. Wittinghofer A. Sander C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4637-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Interestingly, members of the other transcriptionally regulated GTPases, the Rad/Gem/Kir/Rem subfamily, also code for larger proteins (295–310 amino acids) (6Maguire J. Santoro T. Jensen P. Siebenlist U. Yewdell J. Kelly K. Science. 1994; 265: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 7Finlin B.S. Andres D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21982-21988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Classically, Ras proteins are thought to act to link signals from receptor tyrosine kinases to a variety of intracellular processes controlling proliferation and differentiation (13Zerial M. Huber L.A. Guidebook to the Small GTPases. Oxford University Press, New York1995Google Scholar, 14Marshall M. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1311-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Other data support an even wider possible range of Ras effectors (14Marshall M. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1311-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Rap proteins, for example, have been identified tightly associated with the cytoplasmic face of secretory vesicles in rat parotid gland, suggesting a role for these proteins in vesicular transport and exocytocis (15D'Silva N.J. DiJulio D.H. Belton C.M. Jacobson K.L. Watson E.L. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Glucocorticoids have myriad effects on diverse processes, affecting activity of virtually all tissues in the body (16Orth D.N. Kovacs W.J. DeBold C.R. Wilson J.D. Foster D.W. Williams Textbook of Endocrinology. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia, PA1992: 489-619Google Scholar). BecauseDexras1 appears to be rapidly induced by glucocorticoids in several body tissues, it will be of interest to determine how and where this gene participates in glucocorticoid action. In summary, a new Ras superfamily small GTPase gene, Dexras1, has been identified in AtT-20 cells. The gene is induced in these cells and in several tissues in mice in response to Dex. Dexras1 is the first member of the Ras superfamily induced by steroids or glucocorticoids. Roles for this gene in pituitary cells or other tissues in mediating the effects of glucocorticoids await investigation. In particular, we are interested in investigating whether Dexras1 is involved in negative feedback regulation of pituitary ACTH secretion. Thus far, the only evidence supporting such a role is that the mRNA forDexras1 is induced rapidly in AtT-20 cells following Dex treatment, in a time frame consistent with the appearance of early glucocorticoid inhibition of stimulated ACTH secretion.

https://openalex.org/W2079110553,"The description of chemical reaction dynamics often assumes that vibrational modes are well coupled (ergodic) and redistribute energy rapidly with respect to the course of the reaction. To experimentally probe nonergodic, nonstatistical behavior, studies of a series of reactions induced by femtosecond activation for molecules of varying size but having the same reaction coordinates [CH 2 − (CH 2 ) n − 2 − C = O † → products, with n = 4, 5, 6, and 10] were performed. Comparison of the experimental results with theoretical electronic structure and rate calculations showed a two to four orders of magnitude difference, indicating that the basic assumption of statistical energy redistribution is invalid. These results suggest that chemical selectivity can be achieved with femtosecond activation even at very high energies."

The most conspicuous rearrangement involves disruption of 24 base pairs between U4 and U6 small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs). Here, the yeast RNA binding protein Prp24 is shown to reanneal these snRNAs. When Prp24 is absent, unpaired U4 and U6 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) accumulate; with time, splicing becomes inhibited. Addition of purified Prp24 protein regenerates duplex U4/U6 snRNPs for new rounds of splicing. The reannealing reaction catalyzed by Prp24 proceeds more efficiently with snRNPs than with deproteinized snRNAs."

Thus, determinants in addition to the “essential arginine” must be required for substrate recognition. More recent reports have suggested that, in addition to the −3 Arg, particular residues are preferred by CaMKII, specifically at the −5 (10Stokoe D. Caudwell B. Cohen P.T.W. Cohen P. Biochem.

These more recent studies on the substrate specificity of CaMKII utilized different substrates and kinetic methods and examined different positions within the respective substrates (10Stokoe D.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 955-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Hence, the importance for CaMKII of these additional proposed specificity determinants relative to each other, and relative to the −3 Arg, has remained unclear. As a result, R-X-X-S*/T* is still the only generally accepted consensus sequence for CaMKII (2Braun A.P. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 417-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). Compared with CaMKII, the substrate specificity of CaMKIV has received relatively little study. CaMKIV was demonstrated to require in its substrates an Arg, three residues amino-terminal to the phosphorylated Ser or Thr (15Cruzalegui F.H. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26171-26178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, like CaMKII, CaMKIV phosphorylates Kemptide (LRRASLG) poorly, despite the presence of an Arg at the −3 position in this peptide (15Cruzalegui F.H. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26171-26178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that the recognition motif of CaMKIV, like that of CaMKII, has yet to be fully defined. The idea that the substrate specificities of CaMKII and IV are more complex than is currently appreciated raises the possibility that these enzymes may exhibit differences in the patterns of their responses to specific substrate sequence elements. This hypothesis is consistent with observations that, despite overlap in the set of proteins phosphorylated by the two kinases (15Cruzalegui F.H. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26171-26178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Miyano O. Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1198-1203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), certain sequences, for example, Ser-9 of synapsin (17Ohmstede C.A. Jensen K.F. Sahyoun N.E. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar), are preferentially phosphorylated by CaMKIV or CaMKII, respectively. The present study was therefore conducted to: 1) define an optimal substrate recognition motif for CaMKIV; 2) assess the relative importance of additional specificity determinants of CaMKII, and define its optimal motif; and 3) compare the motifs to define distinguishing features of substrate recognition by these two important signal-transducing protein kinases. Syntide-2 (PLARTLSVAGLPGKK) was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. All other peptides were synthesized as COOH-terminal amides according to Merrifield's methodology (19Stewart J.M. Young J.D. Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis. 2nd Ed. Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL1984Google Scholar) and purified by high performance liquid chromotography as described previously (20Lee J.C. Kwon Y.-G. Lawrence D.S. Edelman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6413-6417Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The concentrations of peptides were determined spectrophotometrically by the quantitative ninhydrin reaction (ε = 2.53 × 104m−1 cm−1, 570 nm) (20Lee J.C. Kwon Y.-G. Lawrence D.S. Edelman A.M. Proc.

Chem. 1954; 211: 907-913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the exception of syntide-2, LRRRLSDDNF, and LRRQLSDANF. Concentrations of the latter peptides were quantified by stoichiometric phosphorylation using CaMKIIα. Recombinant CaMKIV and CaMKIIα were expressed using the baculovirus system and were the generous gifts of Kristin Anderson, Jon Schreiber, and Anthony Means (Duke University). CaM kinase kinase (CaMKK), utilized to phosphorylate and activate CaMKIV prior to kinetic experiments was purified from rat brain as an approximately equimolar mixture of the CaMKKα and -β isoforms (22Edelman A.M. Mitchelhill K.I. Selbert M.A. Anderson K.A. Hook S.S. Stapleton D. Goldstein E.G. Means A.R. Kemp B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10806-10910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Lowry procedure (23Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously (24DeRemer M.F. Saeli R.J. Edelman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13460-13465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. CaMKIV requires phosphorylation at Thr-196 for expression of its catalytic activity (25Selbert M.A. Anderson K.A. Huang Q.-H. Goldstein E.G. Means A.R. Edelman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17616-17621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Therefore, the enzyme was preincubated with a maximally stimulating concentration of purified CaMKKα/β at 30 °C for 10 min in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 μm CaM. Peptide kinase activity was then measured at 30 °C in a reaction mix containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mm[γ-32P]ATP (∼0.2 × 103 cpm/pmol), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 μm calmodulin, various concentrations of peptides, and residual buffer components from protein storage buffers. CaMKIIα was assayed under the same reaction conditions but without preincubation with CaMKK. 32P incorporation was determined by adsorption of phosphorylated peptides onto P-81 filter paper, followed by washing in 75 mmH3PO4 and ethanol and liquid scintillation spectrometry as described (24DeRemer M.F. Saeli R.J. Edelman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13460-13465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In control reactions, all peptides were tested, but none were found to be detectably phosphorylated by CaMKK in the absence of CaMKIV. Other control reactions were performed with CaMKIIα in the absence of peptide substrate to control for apparent activity that might be due to CaMKIIα autophosphorylation. Although this activity was routinely subtracted as a “blank” for CaMKIIα assays, it was only detectable at the highest enzyme concentrations used (which were needed to phosphorylate the poorest substrates). For each experiment, the substrate concentrations (typically five) were chosen to bracket theK m, with the rate at each concentration determined at multiple time points to ensure both linearity of activity and utilization of ≤20% of substrate during the course of the reaction. The rate at each concentration/time point was determined in duplicate or triplicate. K m and V maxvalues were computed by non-linear regression analysis using the program, ENZFITTER (Elsevier-BioSoft, Cambridge, United Kingdom).

Open table in a new tab The synaptic vesicle-associated protein synapsin I is efficiently phosphorylated by CaMKII at two COOH-terminal sites, termed sites 2 and 3, but only very slowly phosphorylated at the NH2-terminally located site 1 (Ser-9) (17Ohmstede C.A. Jensen K.F. Sahyoun N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5866-5875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Czernik A.J. Pang D.T. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7518-7522Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). By contrast, CaMKIV phosphorylates either or both of sites 2 and 3 as well as site 1 (17Ohmstede C.A. Jensen K.F. Sahyoun N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5866-5875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By peptide mapping, the ratio of 32P incorporation by CaMKIV is approximately 1:2 (site 1:sites 2/3), suggesting that within about a factor of 2 the sites are equivalent as substrates for the latter enzyme. These observations are consistent with the determinants of substrate recognition by CaMKII and IV as being overlapping but nonidentical. Consequently, it may be concluded that the sequence in the vicinity of site 1 discriminates between the two kinases, either by the absence of positive determinants and/or the introduction of negative determinants, for CaMKII. Therefore, in the present study, we examined the substrate specificities of both kinases using the same set of peptides, modeled on site 1 of synapsin, and synthesized with systematic variation in the sequence: LRRRLSDANF. This peptide serves as a reference against which the effects of deletions and substitutions can be gauged and is referred to here as the synapsin site 1 “parent” peptide. As shown in Table I, the parent peptide is an excellent substrate for CaMKIV, with K m and V max values of 0.18 μm and 1.64 μmol/min/mg, respectively, and is actually a better substrate (due to a 6.2-fold lower K m and 1.7-fold higherV max) than one commonly used in CaMKIV assays (16Miyano O. Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1198-1203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), syntide-2. Table I also presents, in systematic fashion in an NH2- to COOH-terminal direction, kinetic parameters for 16 additional peptides incorporating deletions and substitutions in the sequence of the parent peptide. Since the positions of importance for CaMKIV were unknown (except for the −3 Arg), initial experiments were performed with peptides incorporating sequential NH2-terminal deletions. Deletion of Leu at the −5 position dramatically raises theK m, resulting in a 285-fold decrease in theV max/K m ratio. Thus, −5 is a critical position for substrate recognition. Absence of a residue at the −5 position would therefore explain the inability of Kemptide to be significantly phosphorylated by CaMKIV (15Cruzalegui F.H. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26171-26178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of the residues at both the −5 and −4 positions results in an additional, although modest, decrease inV max/K m, suggesting that the −4 position may have some influence on substrate recognition. Since an effect of deletion could conceivably be due to reduction in peptide length, the kinetic parameters of substituted peptides were then determined. At the −5 position, the aliphatic hydrophobic Leu, was replaced by either the aromatic hydrophobic Phe, the basic Arg, the non-polar, relatively non-hydrophobic Ala, or the acidic Asp. Whereas the Phe-substituted peptide is a good substrate, displaying only a 3.6-fold decrease in V max/K mrelative to that of the parent peptide, the other three substituted peptides are poorly phosphorylated with from 55- to >4000-fold reductions in V max/K m. Thus, a hydrophobic amino acid residue at the −5 position is important for substrate recognition by CaMKIV. The small decrease inV max/K m after substitution of Leu with Phe suggests that either an aliphatic or an aromatic side chain is accommodated in the active site, although the former may be slightly favored. The role of Arg residues at the −4, −3, and −2 positions on phosphorylation kinetics by CaMKIV was then assessed. Peptides with Ala substituted for Arg at the −4 position or with Ala or Gln at the −2 position are relatively good substrates, although these substitutions lead to decreases in V max/K mof 3.9-fold and 5.7–6.1-fold, respectively. By contrast, substitution of Arg at the −3 position with Ala results in an approximately 100-fold decrease in V max/K m. Thus, an Arg at the −3 position is of approximately similar importance as is a hydrophobic amino acid at the −5 position. The modest inhibitory effects of replacement of Arg at the −4 and −2 positions may help explain why syntide-2 (which lacks these determinants) is a somewhat poorer substrate than the synapsin site 1 parent peptide, LRRRLSDANF. The nature of the amino acids at the −1, +1, and +2 positions exerts relatively little influence on substrate recognition by CaMKIV since non-conservative substitutions at these positions lowersV max/K m by only 1.8–5.1-fold. Similarly, the residue at the +4 position appears to be of minor importance since its deletion or substitution (Ala for Phe) lowers V max/K m by only 5-fold. Fig. 1 (panel A) is a plot of the effects of all substitutions onV max/K m values relative to those of the parent peptide. Based on these results, the optimal substrate recognition motif for CaMKIV is Hyd-X-Arg-X-X-Ser*/Thr*. Although residues at other positions, specifically −4, −2, −1, and +4 do exert some influence on phosphorylation kinetics, their overall effect is exceedingly modest and they are therefore not incorporated as determinants in this motif. Syntide-2 is phosphorylated by CaMKIIα with a 35-fold higherV max/K m than the synapsin site 1 parent peptide (Table II). The relatively poor substrate efficacy of the latter peptide is consistent with the inability of CaMKII to phosphorylate this site in the context of the intact protein (18Czernik A.J. Pang D.T. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7518-7522Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). This strong preference of CaMKIIα for syntide-2 is in marked contrast to CaMKIV, for which syntide-2 is actually an approximately 10-fold poorer substrate than the synapsin site 1 parent peptide (Table I). Thus, the two enzymes demonstrate differential substrate selectivity. The basis for this selectivity was explored with peptides based on the synapsin site 1 parent peptide (Table II). Since the nature of the amino acid residue at the −5 position is critical for substrate recognition by CaMKIV, peptides substituted at this position were evaluated as substrates for CaMKIIα. Whereas another hydrophobic residue (Phe) is well tolerated at this position (displaying only a 4.5-fold decrease inV max/K m), substitution of basic (Arg), non-polar (Ala), or acidic (Asp) residues leads to decreases of 79–172-fold in their respectiveV max/K m values. Therefore, as is the case with CaMKIV, the presence of a hydrophobic residue at the −5 position is a strong positive determinant for CaMKIIα. This requirement explains the inability of some peptides, which have an Arg at −3 but lack a residue at the −5 position, to serve as substrates for CaMKII (6Pearson R.B. Woodgett J.R. Cohen P. Kemp B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14471-14476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The role of Arg residues at the −4, −3, and −2 positions was then examined. The −4 position has little influence on phosphorylation kinetics since a non-conservative substitution (Ala for Arg) changes V max/K m by only 2.6-fold. By contrast, Ala substitution at the −3 position dropsV max/K m by 343-fold. At the −2 position, substitutions yield changes in kinetic parameters using CaMKIIα clearly distinct from those observed with CaMKIV. Here, replacement of Arg with the non-polar amino acids, Ala or Gln, leads to 6-fold decreases in V max/K mfor CaMKIV (Table I), whereas these substitutions result in increases of 17-fold and 28-fold, respectively, for CaMKIIα (Table II). These results indicate that, while a positively charged Arg residue at the −2 position may be a (modest) positive determinant for CaMKIV, it is a strong negative determinant for CaMKIIα. The next position examined (−1) does not discriminate between the kinases since substitution of Ala for Leu, lowersV max/K m by about the same extent (4.3-fold) with CaMKIIα as with CaMKIV (5.1-fold). However, at the +1 position, CaMKIIα phosphorylates the peptide containing a hydrophobic Leu residue with aV max/K m value 5.8–9.7-fold higher than those of the Asp- and Ala-substituted peptides, respectively. This is in clear contrast to CaMIV for which substitution of Leu at the +1 position creates, if anything, a slightly poorer substrate than either the Asp- or Ala-substituted peptides (Table I). It may also be noted that the presence of a hydrophobic residue at the +1 position in combination with a non-basic residue at the −2 position fully accounts for the improved ability of syntide-2 to serve as substrate for CaMKIIα, compared with the synapsin site 1 parent peptide. Finally, non-conservative substitutions at the +2 (Asp for Ala) and +4 (Ala for Phe) positions, respectively, have little effect on kinetic parameters with CaMKIIα. The lack of influence of the +4 position is also demonstrated by the similar kinetics exhibited by a COOH-terminally deleted peptide as compared with the parent peptide. Fig. 1 (panel B) is a plot of the effects of all substitutions on V max/K mvalues relative to that of the parent peptide. It indicates an optimal substrate recognition motif for CaMKIIα of Hyd-X-Arg-NB-X-Ser*/Thr*-Hyd. We have delineated in this report optimal substrate recognition motifs for CaMKIV and CaMKIIα. These motifs explain the previously demonstrated abilities of these kinases to discriminate between highly similar sequences in protein substrates. Furthermore, the identification of substrate determinants that differentiate between the two kinases may assist in the identification of potential in vivo phosphorylation sites, allowing the distinct physiological roles of these enzymes to be discerned. Of the eight positions evaluated in this study, determinants at −5 and −3 are the most critical and are of approximately equivalent importance for both kinases (Tables I and II). For CaMKIIα, the >300-fold decrease inV max/K m upon replacement of the −3 Arg with Ala is consistent with th"

Molecular modeling has revealed an arch-shaped molecule with a concave surface capable of interacting with various other proteins (5Weber I.T. Harrison R.W. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31767-31770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Targeted disruption of the decorin gene leads to mice with a skin fragility phenotype and altered collagen fibril morphology (6Danielson K.G. Baribault H. Holmes D.F. Graham H. Kadler K.E. Iozzo R.V. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 729-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar), thereby providing genetic evidence that decorin is a “modifier” of collagen fibrillogenesis during development. Increasing evidence suggests an inhibitory role for this secreted proteoglycan in cell proliferation (7Iozzo R.V. Murdoch A.D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 598-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). In a variety of cell types, overexpression of decorin inhibits cell growth (8Santra M. Skorski T. Calabretta B. Lattime E.C. Iozzo R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7016-7020Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 9Santra M. Mann D.M. Mercer E.W. Skorski T. Calabretta B. Iozzo R.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Furthermore, levels of decorin are markedly increased in quiescent cells and reduced in transformed cells (10Mauviel A. Santra M. Chen Y.Q. Uitto J. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11692-11700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 11Coppock D.L. Kopman C. Scandalis S. Gilleran S. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 483-493PubMed Google Scholar). Decorin may also play an important role in tumorigenesis, because not only is decorin expression decreased in various tumor cell types, but secretion of decorin by stromal cells surrounding tumors is increased (12Adany R. Heimer R. Caterson B. Sorrell J.M. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11389-11396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This may represent a response by the host to reduce the rate of carcinoma spread. Although decorin overexpression is associated with an up-regulation of p21 (13De Luca A. Santra M. Baldi A. Giordano A. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18961-18965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases required for progression through the cell cycle (14El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7957) Google Scholar), upstream targets for decorin, and the exact mechanism by which decorin inhibits cellular growth are unknown. Recently, we have shown that decorin stimulates phosphorylation of the EGF receptor and activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway (15Moscatello D.K. Santra M. Mann D.M. McQuillan D.J. Wong A.J. Iozzo R.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; (in press)Google Scholar). Because EGF receptors can couple to PLC, decorin may also elevate [Ca2+]i, implicating a role for Ca2+in the inhibitory effects of decorin on cell proliferation. Here, we report for the first time that activation of the EGF receptor by decorin results in elevation of [Ca2+]i in single A431 squamous carcinoma cells. Therefore, Ca2+ signals may be important in mediating decorin-induced growth inhibition, which ultimately may retard tumor progression in vivo. Human squamous carcinoma A431 cells were obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD). Highly purified human recombinant decorin and biglycan synthesized by human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells using the vaccinia virus/T7 phage expression system were purified as described previously (16Hocking A.M. Strugnell R.A. Ramamurthy P. McQuillan D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19571-19577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 17Ramamurthy P. Hocking A.M. McQuillan D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19578-19584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Fura-2 and Pluronic F-127 acid were from Teflabs, ionomycin was from Calbiochem, and human recombinant EGF was from Life Technologies, Inc. All other reagents were from Sigma or Fisher. A431 cells were cultured on glass coverslips coated with poly-d-lysine (5 μg/cm3) and maintained at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin in an atmosphere of CO2/air (5%:95%). At 70% confluence, the cells were cultured for a further 48 h in serum-free medium prior to imaging experiments. Imaging experiments were performed at room temperature in a medium composed of 121 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mmMgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm glucose, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.25% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 at room temperature). [Ca2+]i was determined by loading the cells with fura-2 by incubation with fura-2/acetoxymethyl ester (5 μm) in the presence of Pluronic F-127 acid (0.02% w/v) for 20 min. Coverslips were then mounted on an inverted epifluorescence microscope, and fura-2 was excited at 340 and 380 nm and emission (420–600 nm) collected using a charged coupled device camera. Autofluorescence was determined following quench of fura-2 by Mn2+ in Ca2+-free medium supplemented with 1 mm MnCl2 and 2 μm ionomycin. The ratio of the fluorescence at 340 and 380 nm was converted to [Ca2+] according to Grynkiewicz et al. (18Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that decorin-mediated growth inhibition in A431 cells is associated with phosphorylation of the EGF receptor (15Moscatello D.K. Santra M. Mann D.M. McQuillan D.J. Wong A.J. Iozzo R.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; (in press)Google Scholar). Generally, EGF stimulates cell growth and proliferation, but the proliferation of certain cells is paradoxically inhibited by this growth factor (19Barnes D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The prototype of such cells is the A431 human squamous carcinoma cell, which expresses a high number of EGF receptors (∼2 × 106/cell) (20Fan Z. Lu Y. Wu X. DeBlasio A. Koff A. Mendelsohn J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Because activation of EGF receptors results in autophosphorylation and can potentially stimulate PLC-γ, we examined the effects of decorin on [Ca2+]i in individual fura-2-loaded A431 cells. Fig. 1 demonstrates typical [Ca2+]i increases in response to stimulation of A431 cells with decorin. From five separate cell passages, decorin increased [Ca2+]i in 49 ± 12% of cells. In the 498 responding cells, [Ca2+]i increased from a resting level of 30 ± 1 nm to a peak of 123 ± 3 nm. Similar responses were observed after removal of Ca2+ from the extracellular medium (Fig. 1 C). These results indicate that decorin mobilizes Ca2+primarily from intracellular stores as opposed to directly stimulating Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane. Biglycan is another member of the family of small leucine-rich proteoglycans sharing 57% amino acid homology with decorin (4Iozzo R.V. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 32: 141-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). In contrast to decorin, biglycan did not cause growth inhibition (9Santra M. Mann D.M. Mercer E.W. Skorski T. Calabretta B. Iozzo R.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and did not affect [Ca2+]i (Fig. 2). Taken together, these data support a specific effect of decorin on A431 cells. To establish whether decorin-mediated increases in [Ca2+]i were via activation of the EGF receptor, we examined the effects of the tyrphostin AG1478, an EGF-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor on responses to EGF (21Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar) and decorin (15Moscatello D.K. Santra M. Mann D.M. McQuillan D.J. Wong A.J. Iozzo R.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; (in press)Google Scholar). From nine separate cell passages, EGF elevated [Ca2+]i in 90 ± 4% of cells from a resting level of 28 ± 1 nm to a peak level of 191 ± 3 nm (1369 responding cells out of 1492 cells, Fig. 3 A). Pretreatment of the cells with AG1478 (2 μm) reduced the number of cells responding to EGF (Fig. 3 B) by 97 ± 2% (27 responding cells out of 533 cells from five separate cell passages). AG1478 completely abolished the [Ca2+]i responses to decorin (0 responding cells out of 499 cells from two separate cell passages; Fig. 3 C). Notably, we used a concentration of AG1478 that is about 150 of that required to inhibit c-src kinase activity (21Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar) but that effectively blocks activation of the EGF receptor kinase and MAP kinase caused by either EGF or exogenous decorin (9Santra M. Mann D.M. Mercer E.W. Skorski T. Calabretta B. Iozzo R.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Moreover, we found that MAP kinase activation by platelet-derived growth factor was unaffected by the same concentrations of AG1478 (9Santra M. Mann D.M. Mercer E.W. Skorski T. Calabretta B. Iozzo R.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In addition, AG1478 did not affect [Ca2+]i responses to ATP. In five separate cell passages, ATP (200 μm) elevated [Ca2+]i by 776 ± 44 nm (907 cells) and 870 ± 14 nm (670 cells) in the absence and the presence of AG1478, respectively. The inhibitory effects of AG1478 on EGF responses were reversed if AG1478 was washed out 45 min prior to stimulation (not shown). We next examined the effects of EGF and decorin on [Ca2+]i in A431 cells in which EGF receptors had been down-regulated. Prolonged exposure of cells to EGF has been shown to reduce the number of EGF receptors at the cell surface (22Carpenter G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 881-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the number of cells responding to EGF (Fig. 4 A) and decorin (Fig. 4 B) was reduced by 96 ± 3% (4 responding cells out of 255 cells from three separate cell passages) and 99% (3 responding cells out of 424 cells from two separate cell passages), respectively. Down-regulation of EGF receptors reduced [Ca2+]iincreases in response to ATP by 58 ± 9%. Our results show that decorin mediates [Ca2+]iincreases in A431 cells. These responses may occur in vivo, because the concentration of decorin used in the present study (∼1 μm) is much lower than that estimated to be bound to dermal collagen, the site of interaction between keratinocytes and the mesenchyme. The effects of decorin on [Ca2+]i are unlikely to be mediated by activation of integrins, which has been reported previously for other extracellular matrix constituents, because decorin does not contain the tripeptide RGD consensus sequence characteristic of integrin-binding proteins (23Sjaastad M.D. Nelson W.J. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that syndecan-4, a transmembrane proteoglycan, can activate protein kinase C (24Oh E.-S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8133-8136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 25Oh E.-S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11805-11811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Our results, however, are consistent with decorin activating PLC-γ via the EGF receptor, because decorin mediates [Ca2+]i increases that are abolished by either inhibition of EGF receptors with AG1478 or down-regulation of EGF receptors. Because EGF also inhibits proliferation in this cell type, our results provide a possible mechanism by which decorin mediates its negative effects involving direct activation of the EGF receptor and increases in cytosolic Ca2+.

Sequence-selective peptide binding is a difficult problem because small peptides are highly flexible and there are no clear rules for designing peptide-binding molecules as there are for the nucleic acids. The signaling system involved the application of fluorescence energy transfer and provided large, real-time fluorescence increases (300 to 500 percent) upon peptide binding. With it, these sensors were sensitive enough to detect unlabeled cognate peptides both in organic solution and in the solid state at low micromolar concentrations."

G-CSF stimulates both the activation of protein tyrosine kinases Lyn, Jak1, and Jak2 and the association of these enzymes with the G-CSF receptor. Wild-type, lyn-deficient, and syk-deficient chicken B lymphocyte cell lines were transfected with the human G-CSF receptor, and stable transfectants were studied. G-CSF-dependent tyrosyl phosphorylation of Jak1 and Jak2 occurred in all three cell lines. Wild-type and syk-deficient transfectants responded to G-CSF in a dose-responsive fashion with increased thymidine incorporation, but none of the clones of lyn-deficient transfectants did. Ectopic expression of Lyn, but not that of c-Src, in thelyn-deficient cells restored their mitogenic responsiveness to G-CSF. Ectopic expression in wild-type cells of the kinase-inactive form of Lyn, but not of the kinase-inactive form of Jak2, inhibited thymidine incorporation in response to G-CSF. These studies show that the absence of Lyn results in the loss of mitogenic signaling in the G-CSF signaling pathway and that activation of Jak1 or Jak2 is not sufficient to cause mitogenesis."

The synthetic dsRNA poly(I)·poly(C) has been commonly used to stimulate these enzymesin vitro. In previous work, the interaction between 2–5A synthetase and the stimulatory dsRNA has been studied with a particular focus on poly(I)·poly(C) (and modifications thereof), showing that a 10-base pair ideal helix in a 60-nucleotide-long dsRNA was necessary for the stimulation of 2–5A synthetase activity (4Minks M.A. West D.K.

However, the RNA species used in those pioneering studies were all synthetic polymers not having a well defined length or structure. Several small viral RNAs such as VAI encoded by adenovirus and the TAR RNA of HIV-1 have been found to activate 2–5A synthetase (6Desai S.Y. Patel R.C. Sen G.C. Malhotra P. Ghadge G.D. Thimmapaya B.

Suhadolnik R.J. Virology. 1995; 206: 913-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It was shown recently that mutating the VAI RNA in a way that induced extra base pairing in the stem structure of this RNA increased the activation of 2–5A synthetase by VAI (6Desai S.Y. Patel R.C. Sen G.C. Malhotra P. Ghadge G.D. Thimmapaya B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3454-3461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Many dsRNA-binding proteins, including PKR, possess dsRNA binding domains (dsRBMs) with related structures, and consensus sequences for these structures have been proposed (Refs. 11Johnston D.S. Brown N.H. Gall J.G. Jantsch M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10979-10983Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar and 12Green S.R. Mathews M.B.

However, despite the fact that the members of the 2–5A synthetase family are in general believed to be activated by similar types of RNA to those that activate PKR, the structural basis of the RNA-protein interactions in these enzymes might be rather different. Notably, the 2–5A synthetase family does not contain characteristic dsRBMs (14Patel R.C. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7671-7676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, the binding of TAR to PKR involves interaction of the minor groove of the double-stranded helix with a dsRNA binding motif (dsRBM) (15Bevilacqua P.C. Cech T.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9983-9994Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). However, this motif is not present in any of the known 2–5A synthetase sequences, and no other structural similarity has been found between PKR and 2–5A synthetase. Several other RNA binding motifs have been identified over the last few years in both cellular and viral proteins (16Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar). No obvious homology is found between these proteins and 2–5A synthetase, but deletion mapping has suggested that the RNA binding domain of 2–5A synthetase is situated in the N-terminal region of the protein (17Ghosh S.K. Kusari J. Bandyopadhyay S.K. Samanta H. Kumar R. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15293-15299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the nature of the interaction between 2–5A synthetase and its activating RNAs, we have produced the 46-kDa form of human 2–5A synthetase in a baculovirus expression system and purified it from the infected insect cells. Subsequently, we tested the stimulation of enzymatic activity using a number of artificial aptamers selected through a SELEX procedure from a population of RNA molecules of 103 nucleotides in length containing internal sequences of 34 random nucleotides. We report the identification of small well characterized RNA molecules, which activate 2–5A synthetase at lower concentrations than any previously reported RNAs. Despite the absence of extensive secondary structure in these RNA aptamers, they function as potent activators of 2–5A synthetase in vitro. Annealing of complementary RNAs to the single-stranded aptamers increased the ability of these molecules to activate the enzyme in a sequence-specific manner. Complementary DNAs for the 1.6- and 1.8-kilobase forms of 2–5A synthetase (18Benech P. Mory Y. Revel M. Chebath J.

EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1761-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) were cloned into the EcoRI site of the baculovirus transfer vector pVL1393. Co-transfection with CsCl-purified recombinant transfer vector and linearized baculovirus (Autographa californica multiple nuclear polyhedrosis virus) DNA was performed as described by the suppliers (BaculoGold, PharMingen). Spodoptora frugiperda (Sf9) cells (from ATCC CRL1711) were grown in Ex-Cell 401 medium (Sera Lab), supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (100 international units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin) (Life Technologies, Inc.), and adapted to growth in suspension in roller flasks. Pure recombinant viruses were isolated using either plaque purification or a virus dilution method. Insect cells in 96-well microtiter plates were infected with serial dilutions of transfection solution, and cellular DNA was then examined for the presence of the 2–5A synthetase gene by dot-blot analysis (20King C.A. Possee R.D. The Baculovirus Expression System: A Laboratory Guide. Chapman & Hall, London1991Google Scholar). Recombinant baculoviruses were tested for their ability to produce 2–5A synthetase by an enzymatic activity test (21Justesen J. Ferbus D. Thang M.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 3073-3085Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). High Five™ (Trichoplucia ni from InVitrogen) cells were grown to 1.5 × 106 cells/ml and infected with recombinant virus at a multiplicity of infection of 10. The infected cultures were harvested after 72 h by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 20 min. Large scale protein production was optimized in 400-ml roller flasks (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark). Cells were lysed on ice for 10 min in 1% Nonidet P-40 in buffer E (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm KOAc, 10 mm Mg(OAc)2, and 1 mm EDTA). Cell extracts were cleared by centrifugation, and ammonium sulfate was added to a final concentration of 1.1 m. After incubation for 30 min on ice and centrifugation for 10 min at 20,000 ×g, ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 1.7 m and the mixture was loaded on a Phenyl-Sepharose 6FF column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The column was washed with a decreasing ammonium sulfate gradient (1.7 m-0m). The proteins were eluted with a gradient of ethylene glycol (0–50%) in buffer E. Peak fractions were identified by enzyme activity tests using the rapid pyrophosphate assay (see below), and protein concentrations were measured using the BCA method (Pierce). An oligonucleotide library containing a random insert of 34 nucleotides was constructed as summarized in Fig. 1. Oligonucleotides 3, 4, and 5 were ligated together using oligonucleotides 1 and 2 as bridging molecules (22Tuerk C. Gold L. Science. 1990; 249: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (8178) Google Scholar, 23Schneider D. Tuerk C. Gold L. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 862-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Ligation was performed using the temperature cycling method described in Ref. 24Lund A.H. Duch M. Pedersen F.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 800-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholarusing a Perkin-Elmer 480 thermal cycler. Oligonucleotides were denatured by heating to 94 °C for 5 min, followed by cooling to 10 °C over 30 min. T4 DNA ligase was added and a temperature cycling program started, cycling between 10 °C and 30 °C over a period of 45 s for 20 cycles. The temperature was then raised to 94 °C and reduced to 10 °C again. Fresh enzyme was added and another 20 cycles of ligation performed. In total, three such rounds were performed. The 130-nucleotide ligation products were purified on a 12% sequencing polyacrylamide gel (Sequagel, National Diagnostic). Template for the first transcription was prepared by annealing 400 pmol (18 μg) of the ligation products to the same molar amount of oligonucleotide 1 (forward primer). This mixture was added to 900 μl of transcription mix (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 8 mm MgCl2, 2 mm spermidine, 30 mm DTT, 0.5 mmrNTPs, 0.8 unit/μl RNasin (Promega) and 2000 units of T7RNA polymerase) and incubated at 37 °C for 4.5 h. After digestion with 0.4 units/μl DNase I (Stratagene, RNase-free) for 15 min at 37 °C, the products were precipitated using isopropanol and ammonium acetate. The RNA products were redissolved in renaturation buffer (150 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, and 0.25 mg/ml BSA). A total of 4.3 nmol (158 μg) of RNA was recovered. This RNA was split in two pools, one for the selection of species binding to 2–5A synthetase and one for the Rev control experiment (see below). The same procedure was used to transcribe RNA in later rounds, except that the templates were the products of RT-PCR reactions on selected RNAs. RNA (2.2 nmol, 10 μl) was denatured for 3 min at 70 °C and renatured at 4 °C for 5 min. It was then mixed with 12 pmol of the 46-kDa form of human 2–5A synthetase and 2 μg of poly(I)·poly(C) in buffer E in a final volume of 100 μl on ice for 10 min, and then incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. The RNA-protein complex was retained on a nitrocellulose filter (BA85, Schleicher & Schuell) by filtering the mixture through a manifold under vacuum, and was washed twice for 5 min with 2–3 ml of buffer E. The retained RNA was eluted by incubating the filter in elution buffer (300 mm NaCl, 1% SDS, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and 1 mm EDTA) for 10 min. The recovered RNA was phenol-extracted and precipitated. The isolated RNA species were reverse transcribed in 50 μl using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). This first strand synthesized DNA was used for amplification in a 500-μl PCR reaction using oligonucleotides 1 and 5 as primers (see Fig. 1). PCR was performed as follows: 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min. In the first round of selection, 25 cycles were used, and this was gradually decreased to 15 cycles in the final round of selection. The PCR product was purified on a 2% NuSieve (FMC) low melting point agarose gel. After the first round of selection, the yield of pure PCR product was about 5.5 μg of DNA. A control experiment using the HIV-1 Rev protein instead of 2–5A synthetase was performed using the same method, except that the binding reaction was performed in Rev binding buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm potassium acetate, 2 mmMgCl2, 10 mm DTT). Rev protein was a gift from Dr J. Kjems (IMSB, University of Aarhus) and was prepared as described in Ref. 25Kjems J. Brown M. Chang D.D. Sharp P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 683-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar. After either 8 or 11 rounds of selection, a portion of the RT-PCR product was cut withBamHI and HindIII and cloned into pBluescript-KS+ cloning vector (Stratagene). DNA was prepared from a number of colonies and sequenced using standard primers (M13–21 and M13 reverse). Sequencing was done automatically on an Applied Biosystems 373A sequencer, using the ABI Prism dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Perkin-Elmer). The template was prepared by PCR, using a primer containing a T7 promoter at its 5′ end and 21 bases complementary to the 3′ end of the aptamer (antisense T7 primer) and a primer identical to the 5′ end of the aptamer (antisense 5′ primer). The antisense RNA product was extended with an additional three G residues since the T7 RNA polymerase initiates most efficiently if the first three bases are GGG. The primer sequences were as follows: antisense T7 primer, 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCCGGATCCGTTTCAATAGAG-3′; antisense 5′-primer, 5′-GGGAGCCAACACCACAAT-3′. RNA was transcribed using the T7-MEGAshortscript™ kit (Ambion). Templates were generated by PCR, using the same primer as in the SELEX experiment. The transcription product was phenol-extracted, precipitated with ammonium acetate and isopropanol, washed with 80% ethanol, and redissolved in formamide loading buffer. After electrophoresis on a 6% sequencing gel, the RNA was visualized by UV shadowing, cut out, and eluted overnight in 0.25 msodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, then phenol-extracted and isopropanol-precipitated. RNA used for assaying PKR activity in the rabbit reticulocyte lysates system was additionally purified on a 10% native polyacrylamide gel, to avoid low levels of contaminating dsRNA known to be associated with T7 transcript (26Mellits K.H. Pe'ery T. Manche L. Robertson H.D. Mathews M.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5401-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). RNA was redissolved in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 150 mmpotassium acetate, and 10 mm magnesium acetate and renatured by heating to 85 °C for 5 min, followed by slow cooling to 37 °C. The rapid pyrophosphate (RPA) assay for 2–5A synthetase activity was performed essentially as described in Ref. 27Justesen J. Kjeldgaard N.O. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 207: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, except that buffer EM containing the coupling enzymes was prepared as two separate buffers. Buffer EMa contained 1.5 ml of 100 mmNADP+, 1 ml of 100 mm UDP-Glc, 150 μl of 10 mm glucose 1,6-bisphosphate, 15 ml of TM (70 mmtriethanolamine base, 20 mm Mg(OAc)2, 20 mm KOAc, 2 mm EDTA, and 2 mm DTT) buffer and 32.5 ml of H2O. Buffer EMb contained 50 units of UDP-galactose pyrophosphorylase, 34 units of phosphoglucomutase, and 27 units of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (all from Boehringer Mannheim) in 700 μl of buffer TM with 50% glycerol. This change was made to prolong the lifetime of the enzymes in buffer EM. A master mix containing 2.4 μg (3 μl) of pure 2–5A synthetase (46-kDa form), 35 μl of buffer EMa, 1 μl of buffer EMb, and 11 μl of buffer AM (25 mm ATP, 75 mm triethanolamine base, 50 mm Mg(OAc)2 and 2 mm EDTA) per assay was made prior to each experiment. In the kinetic experiments, the mix contained 0.5 μg of 2–5A synthetase, 35 μl of EMa, 4 μl of EMb, and 11 μl of AM, to avoid saturation of the coupling enzyme system. RNA was diluted in buffer TM and added to 96-well microtiter plates in a total volume of 50 μl on ice. The reaction was started by adding the master mix with a multi-pipette (Ripette®) and raising the temperature to 37 °C. Optical density at 340 nm was measured in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader (Bio-Tek™, Bio Kinetics EL 340) connected to a computer. Data obtained from the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader were used to calculate 2–5A synthetase-catalyzed reaction velocities by linear regression within the linear range of the time courses (at least four points). The apparent dissociation constant (K app) and the maximal reaction velocity (V max) were estimated using the following relations: V = (V max/(1 +K app/[RNA])), where [RNA] is the concentration of the RNA agonist. Calculations were performed by making a non-linear curve fit of V to [RNA] using Sigmaplot® software. 2–5A synthetases were synthesized according to Ref. 21Justesen J. Ferbus D. Thang M.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 3073-3085Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar using [α-33P]ATP and separated on polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin layer plates, developed with 2 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.63. Only intact triphosphorylated oligo-adenylates were detected, as well as the produced PPi. No Pi due to contaminating phosphatase activity was detected. The filter binding assay was performed using [α-32P]UTP-labeled RNA. Approximately 50,000 cpm was incubated with the indicated concentration of 2–5A synthetase in binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mmKCl, 8 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mg/ml RNase-free BSA (Boehringer Mannheim)) in a total volume of 25 μl for 15 min at 30 °C. 20 μl of the binding reaction was passed through a nitrocellulose membrane under vacuum. The membranes were washed three times with 300 μl of wash buffer (10 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 8 mm MgCl2). The stability of the RNA-protein complex was measured by diluting the binding reaction into 2 ml of wash buffer and incubating for various times prior to loading onto the nitrocellulose membrane. Complexes were stable for at least 10 min under these conditions. All measurements were performed on a BIAcore 2000 instrument (Biosensor, Uppsala, Sweden) equipped with SA sensor chip. The SA sensor chip has a streptavidin-coated surface in all four flow channels ready to bind biotinylated ligands. A continuous flow of Mg2+-HBS buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 0.005% surfactant P20) passing over the sensor surface was maintained at 5 μl/min. Biotinylated RNA was produced using the biotin RNA labeling mix from Boehringer Mannheim. The reaction mixture was precipitated using ammonium acetate and isopropanol and subsequently passed through a G50 Sephadex spin column to remove unincorporated biotin-UTP. The biotinylated RNA samples were diluted in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml and injected over the immobilized streptavidin surface. Typically, 500–1000 response units (RU) of each RNA species was bound to the immobilized streptavidin corresponding to 0.016–0.032 pmol/mm2. Analyses of the 2–5A synthetase protein were performed by injecting 40 μl of protein solution into the derivatized sensor chip flow channels using a blank flow channel as a control. The protein was dissolved in Mg2+-HBS buffer and injected in concentrations of 40–600 nm. Regeneration of the sensor chip after each analysis cycle was performed by injecting 2 × 5 μl of 0.05% SDS. Kinetic parameters were determined by using the BIAevaluation 2.1 software. Assays were performed as described in Ref. 28Clemens M.J. Hames B.D. Higgins S.J. Transcription and Translation. IRL Press, Oxford1984: 270Google Scholar. The reaction volume was 10 μl. At the end of the incubation, 7 μl was taken for precipitation of acid-insoluble radioactivity, which was counted in a liquid scintillation counter. The 46-kDa isoform of 2–5A synthetase was used as the protein target in a SELEX experiment, using an RNA population of 103-mers containing randomized sequences within a 34-nucleotide stretch near the center of the molecule (Fig. 1 B). RNA ligands for 2–5A synthetase were selected by either 8 or 11 rounds of selection using binding of the RNA-protein complexes on nitrocellulose filters. After elution of the RNA and amplification by RT-PCR, the products were cloned and sequenced. Out of a total of 20 aptamers obtained, two were identical (sx112 and sx118). Two others (sx106 and sx108) differ only at one nucleotide position. The sequences of the aptamers are shown in Fig. 2. As a positive control for the procedure, selection for ligands with high affinity for the HIV-1 protein Rev was done in parallel, starting with RNA from the same stock. The sequences selected in this procedure corresponded to the three consensus motifs reported in Ref. 29Tuerk C. MacDougal Waugh S. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 137: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar in a similar experiment (data not shown). This shows that the SELEX protocol used was valid for the purposes required. Following the selection of aptamers by binding to 2–5A synthetase, RNA was prepared from the series of 20 aptamer clones and the ability of each RNA aptamer to activate 2–5A synthetase (46-kDa isoform) was tested in an in vitro assay (Fig. 3). The activity observed in the presence of the different aptamers varied between 0.5- and 3.8-fold of the activity obtained with the random (preselection) RNA mixture. It should be noted that the RNA used in this initial screen was not gel-purified. Subsequently, we found that the activity stimulated by the random RNA decreased substantially if the RNA was gel-purified, as in the case of all subsequent experiment (see Table I). The activity stimulated by aptamers was not influenced significantly by the degree of purification.Table IBinding affinities of various aptamersType of RNAK onK offK DActivitym−1s−1s−1mnmol ATP/minsx1123.8 × 1041.6 × 10−44.2 × 10−90.3sx1373.4 × 1041.4 × 10−44.1 × 10−90.19sx952.3 × 1049.4 × 10−54.1 × 10−90.05sx1394.0 × 1041.1 × 10−42.7 × 10−90.06Random3.3 × 1042.4 × 10−47.3 × 10−90.02 Open table in a new tab A negative control using actin mRNA gave 12% of this activity. A positive control using poly(I)·poly(C) gave a level of activation that was 2–3-fold of that of the random RNA (data not shown). The data presented in Fig. 3 is the result of a total of four experiments, using two independent RNA preparations. The aptamers were divided into groups with high, medium, and low activation potential. (The borders between these divisions were somewhat arbitrary, except that the random RNA was considered to define the low activity group). The results obtained in the initial screen were confirmed by making dilution series of selected aptamers, using a range of concentrations covering two orders of magnitude, as exemplified by the data for the sx112 aptamer shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 5shows a comparison of three aptamers together with actin mRNA and random RNA, each assayed at three different RNA concentrations.Figure 5Comparison of 2–5A synthetase activity stimulated by various concentrations of different aptamers or control RNAs. Enzyme activity was measured as described in Fig. 4 in the presence of three different concentrations of the RNA species indicated. A, 12.5 μg/ml; B, 3 μg/ml;C, 0.75 μg/ml.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The sx92, sx112, and sx137 aptamers showed a strong ability to activate the 2–5A synthetase, giving detectable activity at a concentration as low as 0.2 μg/ml in the case of sx112 (Fig. 4). At a concentration of 0.75 μg/ml, all three aptamers still exhibited a strong activity, whereas the control RNAs did not activate even at a concentration of 3 μg/ml. The results obtained in the RPA assay (Fig. 5) were confirmed in a direct assay using [α-33P]ATP with subsequent separation of the radioactive 2–5A products by thin layer chromatography on polyethyleneimine plates (21Justesen J. Ferbus D. Thang M.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 3073-3085Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6). No difference in the size distribution of the oligomers produced was observed whether poly(I)·poly(C) or an aptamer was used as activator. Aptamers from different groups (sx93, sx97, sx106, and sx112) were individually analyzed for binding to 2–5A synthetase by filter binding assays. All these RNAs bound to nitrocellulose filters in the presence, but not in the absence, of the enzyme. Fig. 7 shows the result obtained with the sx112 aptamer. This aptamer also bound to 2–5A synthetase in a concentration-dependent manner (data not shown), and binding was partially competed by poly(I)·poly(C). To further characterize the binding capability of the aptamer, we measured the dissociation constant for the RNA/2–5A synthetase complex using a Biacore machine. Four different aptamers and random RNA were biotinylated by incorporation of biotinylated UTP and subsequently bound to a streptavidin coated chips. The binding was analyzed by injecting 2–5A synthetase protein in five different concentrations ranging from 40 nm to 600 nm. The obtained kinetic parameters are presented in Table I. There is no apparent correlation between binding and activation. It is somewhat surprising that the random RNA binds 2–5A synthetase rather strongly; nevertheless, this might reflect a general RNA binding ability of 2–5A synthetase. The three groups of aptamers (according to stimulatory activity) were compared at the sequence level (Fig. 2). In general, the selected aptamers have a high content of cytosine, and the presence of oligo(C) stretches is striking. This suggests an involvement of such sequences in the high activation of 2–5A synthetase by those RNAs. The strong agonists have a low content of G residues, with an average of only 3 G nucleotides in the 34 central randomized nucleotides. They are also characterized by two motifs, APyAPy(N)nCC and UU(N)nACCC in different parts of the molecule. These motifs are also found in some of the medium and poor activators, but they are only partial (Fig. 2). We used the RNA DRAW computer program to examine possible secondary structures of the selected aptamers. A surprisingly low extent of base pairing was obtained for the aptamers, which were the best 2–5A synthetase agonists. The sx137 RNA had only a 3-base pair putative stem structure within the random region and the sx112 RNA had only a 6-base pair stem structure, which could be formed between the random region and part of the linker sequences (Fig. 8). In addition to the 2–5A synthetase another IFN-inducible enzyme, the protein kinase PKR, is also activated by binding structured RNA species. PKR inhibits protein synthesis by virtue of its ability to phosphorylate the α subunit of polypeptide chain initiation factor eIF2 (30Clemens M.J. Hershey J.W.B."
https://openalex.org/W2020387146,"Bap31 is a polytopic integral membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum and forms a complex with Bcl-2/Bcl-XL and procaspase-8 (Ng, F. W. H., Nguyen, M., Kwan, T., Branton, P. E., Nicholson, W. D., Cromlish, J. A., and Shore, G. C. (1997) J. Cell Biol.139, 327–338). In co-transfected human cells, procaspase-8 is capable of interacting with Ced-4, an important adaptor molecule inCaenorhabditis elegans that binds to and activates theC. elegans procaspase, proCed-3. Here, we show that the predicted death effector homology domain within the cytosolic region of Bap31 interacts with Ced-4 and contributes to recruitment of procaspase-8. Bcl-XL, which binds directly but weakly to the polytopic transmembrane region of Bap31, indirectly and cooperatively associates with the Bap31 cytosolic domain, dependent on the presence of procaspase-8 and Ced-4. Ced-4Δc does not interact with Bcl-XL but rather displaces it from Bap31, suggesting that an endogenous Ced-4-like adaptor is a normal constituent of the Bap31 complex and is required for stable association of Bcl-XL with Bap31 in vivo. These findings indicate that Bap31 is capable of recruiting essential components of a core death regulatory machinery. Bap31 is a polytopic integral membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum and forms a complex with Bcl-2/Bcl-XL and procaspase-8 (Ng, F. W. H., Nguyen, M., Kwan, T., Branton, P. E., Nicholson, W.

These findings indicate that Bap31 is capable of recruiting essential components of a core death regulatory machinery. Genetic studies in the nematode Caenorhabditis eleganshave identified and ordered a core machinery for regulation of apoptotic programmed cell death in which the Bcl-2 homolog, Ced-9, prevents Ced-4 from activating the caspase, Ced-3, and thus blocks ensuing cell death (1Yuan J.-Y.

Initiator caspases such as procaspase-8, on the other hand, are well characterized constituents of the Fas and TNFR1 apoptosis signaling complexes in the plasma membrane (25Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 26Wallach D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 107-109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 27Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar). These complexes, however, are highly restricted in the death signals to which they respond and are not directly influenced by Bcl-2 family proteins. The ability of Bap31 to associate with both procaspase-8 and Bcl-2/Bcl-XL, therefore, raises the possibility that the Bap31 complex in the ER might cooperate with events in the mitochondrion to control proximal and distal steps in a Bcl-2-regulated caspase cascade. If so, the ability of Ced-4 to bridge Bcl-XL and procaspase-8 (6Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Lane B.R. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 275: 1122-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar) predicts that a Ced-4-like adaptor molecule may also be a part of the Bap31 complex. cDNAs encoding proteins tagged with specific epitopes were constructed in expression vectors. Flag epitope was inserted toward the C terminus of Bap31, immediately upstream of the KKEE ER retrieval signal; Myc and HA epitopes were placed at the C termini of Bcl-XL and proFLICE, respectively.

The predicted death effector homology domain in Bap31 (amino acids 165–238) is flanked on either side by sites that are cleaved by caspase-8 or a related caspase during adenovirus E1A-induced apoptosis (20Ng F.W.H. Nguyen M. Kwan T. Branton P.E. Nicholson W.D. Cromlish J.A. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 327-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) (summarized in Fig. 1 A). The resulting p20 Bap31 product is a potent inducer of apoptosis when expressed ectopically in otherwise normal cells, presumably because it has a dominant-negative effect on endogenous Bap31 (20Ng F.W.H. Nguyen M. Kwan T. Branton P.E. Nicholson W.D. Cromlish J.A. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 327-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). In vitro mapping has revealed that Bcl-2 proteins bind directly to the N-terminal domain of Bap31, which includes the polytopic membrane-associated region, and weakly if at all with the cytosolic domain (20Ng F.W.H. Nguyen M. Kwan T. Branton P.E. Nicholson W.D. Cromlish J.A. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 327-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). As expected, therefore, full-length Flag-tagged Bap31, but not the Bap31 cytosolic domain alone (Bap31ΔN119), interacted with Bcl-XL in co-transfected human 293T cells, as judged by co-immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag antibody (Fig. 1 B, compare lanes 3 and 4). However, when Bap31ΔN119 was coexpressed with both Bcl-XL and procaspase-8 (proFLICE), a strong association between Bcl-XL and the Bap31 cytosolic domain was recorded (lane 5). Thus, Bcl-XL may be tethered at the N terminus of Bap31 and associate indirectly and cooperatively with the Bap31 cytosolic domain, dependent on the presence of procaspase-8. Failure to achieve reconstitution of these interactions in vitro (not shown), however, suggested that an adaptor molecule might be required. As a preliminary step indicating that Ced-4 might associate with Bap31, a transcription-translation product of the proapoptotic short splice form of Ced-4 (28Shaham S. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1996; 86: 201-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) was found to interact in vitrowith a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing the Bap31 cytosolic domain (GST-Bap31ΔN119) (Fig. 2). Furthermore, when Ced-4 was co-expressed with Bap31-Flag in 293T cells and total cell extracts were incubated with anti-Flag antibody, Ced-4 co-immunopreciptated with Bap31-Flag but not with Control-Flag (Fig. 3 A, lanes 3 and 4). This association was significantly reduced using a Bap31 construct lacking the putative death effector homology domain (Bap31Δ167–240-Flag, lane 2). In fact, the residual amount of Ced-4 that was recovered in association with the Bap31 deletion mutant (lane 2) may have resulted because immunoprecipitation of Bap31Δ167–240-Flag with anti-Flag antibody also precipitated endogenous Bap31 (lanes 7). The latter is consistent with our findings that Bap31 forms homooligomers bothin vitro and in vivo. 2F. W. H. Ng and G. C. Shore, unpublished observation. Of note, expression of Ced-4 did not lead to significant caspase-dependent cleavage of Bap31. This is concordant with the observation that Ced-4 does not independently induce apoptosis in 293T cells (9Wu D. Wallen H.D. Inohara N. Nuñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21449-21454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).Figure 3Ced-4 interacts with Bap31 in 293T cells. A, Ced-4 associates with the cytosolic domain of Bap31. 293T cells were transfected with the indicated vectors, and after 30 h, protein complexes were recovered from cell extracts (lysate) with anti-Flag antibody (Flag ip), resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and treated with either anti-HA (α HA) antibody to detect Ced-4 (lanes 1–6) or chicken anti-Bap31 (α p28-M; Ref. 20Ng F.W.H.

B, as in A, except that protein complexes were recovered from cell extracts (lysate) with anti-Flag antibody (Flag ip), and Ced-4 and procaspase-8 (proFLICE) visualized with anti-HA antibody. C, as in A and B, except that the association of procaspase-8 (proFLICE) with Bap31 and Bap31Δ167–240 was determined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Importantly, the presence of Bcl-XL did not influence the ability of Ced-4 to associate with Bap31 in 293T cells (Fig. 3 A, lanes 4 and 6), suggesting that Bcl-XL does not function to prevent Ced-4 from engaging the Bap31 complex. Moreover, this was also extended to procaspase-8, where it was found that Ced-4 and procaspase-8, when expressed individually in co-transfected 293T cells, associated with Bap31-Flag (Fig. 3 B, lanes 3 and 5) to the same extent as in the situation where Ced-4 and procaspase-8 were expressed together (lane 7). Again, as was the case for Ced-4 (Fig. 3 A), the ability of procaspase-8 to associate with Bap31 was significantly reduced by deleting the putative Bap31 death effector homology domain (Fig. 3 C). One obvious explanation to account for the ability of Ced-4 to associate with the Bap31 complex is that Ced-4 may be substituting for an endogenous Ced-4-like adaptor molecule. Earlier studies identified a means of testing this hypothesis (Ref. 6Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Lane B.R. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 275: 1122-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, see schematic in Fig. 4). A mutant Ced-4 lacking the C-terminal 248 amino acids, Ced4Δc, failed to interact with Ced-9 or Bcl-XL but retained the ability to associate with Ced-3 or procaspase-8 in co-transfected 293T cells. Thus, it competes in vivo with an endogenous adaptor that bridges Bcl-XLand procaspase-8 and prevents precipitation of procaspase-8 by an antibody directed to Bcl-XL (6Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Lane B.R. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 275: 1122-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Similarly, we found that Ced-4Δc lacking the C-terminal 246 amino acids also competed for the ability of Bcl-XL to bind to Bap31 in vivo (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 3, upper panel), strongly implying that it does so by displacing an endogenous adaptor that otherwise would make contact with Bcl-XL. Wild-type Ced-4 also reduced somewhat the level of Bcl-XL that was recovered with Bap31 (lanes 1 and 2), suggesting that Ced-4 is less efficient than the endogenous adaptor molecule at contributing to the association of Bcl-XL with the Bap31 complex. Taken together, the results in Fig. 4 and those in Fig. 1 B demonstrate that cooperative interactions between Bcl-XL and both Ced-4 and procaspase-8 contribute to the stable binding of Bcl-XL to Bap31 in vivo. In conclusion, the ability of Ced-9 to bind to and prevent Ced-4 from activating Ced-3 provides a simple explanation to account for the molecular control over apoptotic cell death. Nevertheless, it remains to be explained how the corresponding molecular complexes in mammalian cells are linked to the multitude of signals that can trigger activation of procaspases and how they interface with the numerous proapoptotic and antiapoptotic regulators that modulate these signals (24Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar, 29Yang E. Korsmeyer S.J. Blood. 1996; 88: 386-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cooperative associations between Bcl-XL, Ced-4, procaspase-8, and the Bap31 cytosolic domain observed here, on the other hand, suggest that Bap31 may provide one such bridge and predict that an endogenous Ced-4-like adaptor molecule may be a normal constituent of the Bap31 complex.

Specificity in ligand receptor systems is achieved at the extracellular level by the specific interaction of a ligand with its distinct receptor components and at the intracellular level by the interaction of the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor subunits with a distinct set of signal transducing proteins. Many cytokine systems share receptor subunits (1Kishimoto T. Taga T. Akira S. Cell. 1994; 76: 253-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar, 2Taga T. Kishimoto T.

For instance, the IL2R 1The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; IL2R, IL-2 receptor; IFN, interferon; IFN-R, IFN receptor; Stat, signal transducer and activator of transcription; ISGF3, interferon-stimulated gene factor 3; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay. has a binding subunit (α chain) and two signaling chains designated as β and γc. The IL2Rγc chain is also common to the IL4, IL7, and IL9 receptors and functions in association with specific receptor subunits for each of these cytokines (i.e. IL4Rα, IL7Rα, and IL9Rα chains). Therefore, these cytokines have the ability to produce both redundant and distinct biological effects (1Kishimoto T. Taga T. Akira S.

Although expression of the α chain with either βL or βS produces high affinity receptors in murine L-929 cells, only coexpression of α and βL allows activation of the Jak-Stat pathway and induction of an antiviral state in response to stimulation by both huIFNα2 and huIFNβ (13Domanski P.

Interestingly, although both of these human IFNs bind to the same receptor and activate the same components of the Jak-Stat pathway, there are some signaling and biological differences. IFNβ signaling has two distinctive features: (i) induction of a very strong association of the α and βL subunits of the type I IFN-R (15Platanias L.C. Uddin S. Domanski P. Colamonici O.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23630-23633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and (ii) transcriptional activation of the β-R1 gene (16Rani M.R.S. Foster G.R. Leung S. Leaman D. Stark G.R. Ransohoff R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22878-22884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). These signaling differences could be responsible for the disparity in biological effects among the members of the IFNα family. For example, IFNβ is more effective than other type I IFNs in the treatment of multiple sclerosis (17Group A.R. J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry. 1989; 52: 566-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 18Johnson K.P. Neurology. 1990; 40 (abstr.): 261PubMed Google Scholar). However, unlike other cytokines, the differences in signaling and biological activities between IFNα and IFNβ do not appear to result from the utilization of different receptor subunits. This has been demonstrated by the finding that mouse L-929 cells stably expressing the human α and βL subunits respond equally well to the induction of an antiviral state by huIFNα and huIFNβ (13Domanski P. Witte M. Kellum M. Menachen R. Larner A. Pitha-Rowe P. Colamonici O.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21606-21611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), and yet only IFNβ triggers the aforementioned association of the α and βL chains (15Platanias L.C. Uddin S. Domanski P. Colamonici O.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23630-23633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In this report we show that IFNα2 and IFNβ require distinct intracytoplasmic regions of the βL chain to elicit an antiviral response. L-929 cells expressing βL truncated at amino acid 417 show a marked decrease in the antiviral response to IFNβ but not to IFNα2. However, no differences in the activation of ISGF3 or SIF factors by IFNα2 or IFNβ were detected. These data suggest that other signaling components, in addition to the Stat pathway, should be activated to obtain an antiviral response. Moreover, IFNβ seems to activate this unknown pathway through a distinct mechanism that requires the 417–462 region of the βLsubunit. Human recombinant IFNα2 and IFNβ were kindly provided by Drs. Paul Trotta (Schering-Plow) and S. Goelz (Biogen). The anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Monoclonal antibodies against Jak1 and Stat1 were purchased from Transduction Labs. (Lexington, KY). The anti-Stat1 and anti-Stat2 and anti-Jak1 sera were kindly provided by Drs. A.

These constructs were made by polymerase chain reaction using proofreading Vent polymerase and primers with an early termination codon at positions 346, 417, and 462 (see Fig. 1), respectively (20Domanski P.

Transfectants were grown in medium containing G-418 (500 μg/ml) and hygromycin B (500 μg/ml).

Chem. 1996; 271: 12408-12413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and analyzed by EMSA using end labeled ISRE oligonucleotides to detect ISGF3. We hypothesized that the differences observed between IFNα and IFNβ signaling occur within the same receptor complex and not by an additional ligand-specific subunit as in other cytokine systems (1Kishimoto T. Taga T. Akira S. Cell. 1994; 76: 253-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar, 2Taga T. Kishimoto T. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3387-3396Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 3Schindler S. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar). Such a model assumes that a particular subtype of the IFN family will use regions of the receptor complex that are not used by another subtype. Thus, we studied the ability of huIFNα2 and huIFNβ to induce an antiviral state in mouse L-929 cells stably coexpressing the wild type α subunit with a βL chain truncated at amino acid 462, 417, or 346, respectively (Fig. 1). All cell lines established were able to respond to huIFNα2 as well as to muIFNαβ (positive control), indicating that the transfected receptor and the IFNα signaling pathway are functional. However, cells expressing the βLchain truncated proximal to amino acid 462 (Table I, αβL417.7, αβL417.9, αβL346.2, and αβL346.4 cells) required significantly higher amounts of huIFNβ to obtain 50% protection against encephalomyocarditis virus.Table IInduction of an antiviral state by huIFNα2 and huIFNβ in L-929 cells expressing truncations of the βL subunit and wild type α chainTransfectantmuIFNαβhuIFNβhuIFNα2αβL462.2244248αβL417.77045034αβL417.923>50042αβL346.2193508αβL346.4935014 Open table in a new tab To demonstrate that the differences in the response to IFNα2 and IFNβ were not due to alterations in IFNβ binding, we tested the ability of unlabeled IFNα2 and IFNβ to displace radioiodinated IFNα2 from the human receptor subunits in the αβL417and αβL462 cell lines. If the defect in the induction of an antiviral state by IFNβ was a consequence of impaired binding of this IFN to the receptor, then unlabeled huIFNβ should be less effective as a competitor for binding of 125I-IFNα2 to the receptor than unlabeled IFNα2. Fig. 2 shows that in αβL417.7and αβL462.2 cells, unlabeled IFNβ was even more effective in displacing 125I-IFNα2 from the receptor than equivalent concentrations of unlabeled IFNα2. Thus, the lack of induction of an antiviral state by IFNβ in αβL417cells is not due to impaired recognition of the receptor by this IFN but rather by deletion of the 417–462 region of βL, indicating that this region may contain a specific IFNβ response element. To further examine the differences observed in the antiviral response, time course and dose response experiments were performed in αβL417.7 and αβL462.2 cells to determine the length and intensity of tyrosine phosphorylation for components of the Jak-Stat pathway. Fig. 3 A shows that IFNβ (lanes 3, 5, and 7) induced even higher levels of Jak1 tyrosine phosphorylation than IFNα2 (lanes 1, 4, and 6) in αβL417.7 cells at all time points studied. Intense phosphorylation could be detected at 10 min and returned to base-line levels by 90 min. Dose response experiments showed that activation of Jak1 was achieved at doses as low as 300 units/ml of IFNα2 or IFNβ (Fig. 3 A, lower panel, lanes 2–5). Similar results were obtained in time course and dose response experiments performed with αβL462.2 (data not shown). We also studied the activation of Tyk2 kinase in both cell lines. Fig. 3 B shows that Tyk2 tyrosine phosphorylation was induced by both IFNα2 and IFNβ in αβL417.7 and αβL462.2 cells at 10 min (lanes 2, 3, 9, and 10) and subsequently decreased at 30 min (lanes 4, 5, 11, and 12). The level of Tyk2 phosphorylation returned to base-line levels by 90 min in αβL462.2 cells (lanes 13 and 14) and significantly decreased in αβL417.7 cells (lanes 6 and 7). Tyk2 tyrosine phosphorylation was also detected with concentrations of IFNα2 or IFNβ as low as 300 units/ml (Fig. 3 C, lanes 2, 3, 7, and 8). It is worth mentioning that the level of tyrosine phosphorylation detected in αβL462 cells were slightly higher than in αβL417 cells (Fig. 3 C, compare αβL417 and αβL462 cells). We next studied the activation of the Stat proteins. Fig. 4 shows that at all time points studied there were no differences in the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 by IFNα2 or IFNβ in αβL417.7 (panel A) or αβL462.2 (panel B) cells. Tyrosine phosphorylation was maximal at 30 min and then progressively declined. Fig. 4 (A and B) also shows that after IFNα2 or IFNβ treatment the anti-Stat1 serum coimmunoprecipitates another tyrosine phosphorylated protein that has an electrophoretic mobility similar to that of Stat2. The lower panels inA and B of Fig. 4 show that equivalent amounts of Stat1 were immunoprecipitated in all conditions. Similar results were obtained when the activation of Stat1 and Stat2 (ISGF3) was studied by EMSA with an ISRE probe. Fig. 4 C shows that equivalent levels of the ISGF3 were induced by huIFNα2 and huIFNβ in αβL417.7 cells even though these cells are resistant to the induction of an antiviral state by huIFNβ but remain sensitive to IFNα2. Similar results were observed with αβL462.2cells (Fig. 4 C, lower panel). Dose response experiments were then performed to examine the ability of varying concentrations of huIFNα2 or huIFNβ to affect activation of Stat proteins. Fig. 4 D shows that Stat1 and Stat2 activation are equivalent for human IFNα and IFNβ at concentrations as low as 300 units/ml. The higher levels of tyrosine phosphorylation observed after treatment with 300 units/ml of IFNα or IFNβ in αβL462 cells are likely due to the higher amounts of Stat1 protein precipitated in these lanes (Fig. 4 D, lower panel, anti-Stat1 immunoblot). The middle panel in Fig. 4 D shows an immunoblot with an anti-Stat2 antibody that identifies Stat2 as the protein coprecipitated by the anti-Stat1 antibody. Coprecipitation of Stat2 is proportional to the intensity of tyrosine phosphorylation as expected from a SH2-phosphotyrosine interaction. In summary, the study of activation of the Jak kinases and Stat factors in αβL417 and αβL462 cells did not reveal significant differences that would account for the impaired response to IFNβ observed in αβL417 cells. Cytokine systems that share subunits usually show both overlapping and distinct biological effects that result from activation of common and discrete receptor chains, respectively (3Schindler S. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar). In the type I IFN system, however, several lines of evidence indicate that the different subtypes of IFNα, IFNβ, and IFNω utilize a common type I IFN-R. For example, all type I IFNs compete for binding to the same receptor (reviewed in Refs. 4Domanski P. Colamonici O.R. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar and 22Langer J.A. Pestka S. Immunol. Today. 1988; 9: 393-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) and specific monoclonal antibodies that recognize the α and β chains, block binding, and inhibit biological activity of several type I IFNs (11Colamonici O.R.

Immunol. 1993; 150: 707-716PubMed Google Scholar). Other anti-α subunit antibodies precipitate radiolabeled huIFNα2, huIFNα7, huIFNα8, huIFNβ, and huIFNω cross-linked to the α subunit (24Colamonici O.R. Platanias L.C. Domanski P.D. Handa R. Gilmour K.C. Diaz M.O. Reich N. Pitha-Rowe P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8188-8193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Finally, expression of the human wild type α and βL subunits in mouse L-929 cells gives them the ability to mount an antiviral response after treatment by either huIFNα2 or huIFNβ (13Domanski P. Witte M. Kellum M. Menachen R. Larner A. Pitha-Rowe P. Colamonici O.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21606-21611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Our data for the type I IFN system indicate that binding of different ligands to the same receptor chains produces changes that go beyond simple dimerization of receptor subunits. IFNα2 and IFNβ apparently utilize different regions of the intracellular domain of the βL subunit to generate an antiviral state. One possible explanation is that each IFN promotes distinct conformational changes in the receptor that affects signaling through the 417–462 region of βL, similar to the mechanism proposed for the Tar protein (25Tatsuno I. Homma M. Oosawa K. Kawagishi I. Science. 1996; 274: 423-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 26Gardina P.J. Manson M.D. Science. 1996; 274: 425-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This model theoretically increases the number of distinct biological responses that can be promoted by different ligands utilizing a common set of receptor subunits, which may explain how different type I IFNs exert slightly different biological responses (27Pestka S. Langer J.A. Zoon K.C. Samuel C.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 727-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar). The presence of two binding sites on the α subunit of the type I IFN-R receptor (28Bazan J.F. Cell. 1990; 61: 753-754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) may contribute to the diverse biological responses induced by different subtypes of type I IFNs. This is supported by the finding that the splice variant of the α subunit, which lacks the N-terminal binding site, preferentially binds certain type I IFNs (29Cook J.R. Cleary C.M. Mariano T.M. Izotova Pestka S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13448-13453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Finally, the differences in induction of an antiviral state by IFNα and IFNβ do not correlate with differences in activation of the Jak-Stat pathway. This is not surprising because mutant U4 cells complemented with kinase deficient Jak1 can induce IFNγ-activating factor and the interferon-stimulated gene but not an antiviral state in response to IFNγ (30Briscoe J. Rogers N.C. Witthuhn B.A. Watling D. Harpur A.G. Wilks A.F. Stark G.R. Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 799-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Therefore, although activation of these DNA binding complexes is required (31Durbin J.E. Hackenmiller R. Simon M.C. Levy D.E. Cell. 1996; 84: 443-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar, 32Meraz M.A. White J.M. Sheehan K.C.F. Bach E.A. Rodij S.J. Dighe A.S. Kaplan D.H. Riley J.K.

Cell. 1996; 84: 431-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar), it is not sufficient to elicit an antiviral effect. Similarly, the IFNβ response is partially conserved in mutant cells that lack Tyk2 (35Pellegrini S. John J. Shearer M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4605-4612Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 36Velazquez L. Mogensen K.E. Barbieri G. Fellous M. Uzé G. Pellegrini S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3327-3334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that additional signaling mechanisms should be triggered by IFNs. It is tempting to speculate that the IFNβ-induced activation of the IFNβ response element (IBR) region of βL is responsible for the formation of other DNA binding complexes that interact with an element different from the ISRE or IRE. The existence of such elements has been also proposed by others to explain the differences in induction of the IFNβ-specific gene βR-1 (16Rani M.R.S. Foster G.R. Leung S. Leaman D. Stark G.R.

The Nudix hydrolases are a family of widely distributed enzymes (1Bessman M.J. Frick D.N. O'Handley S.F. J. Biol.

Microbiol. 1993; 11: 323-330Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Searches of the protein data banks have uncovered over 100 putative proteins containing the Nudix structural motif, within all three kingdoms, the prokaryota, archaea, and eukaryota, in organisms ranging in complexity from viruses to humans. To date, about 20 of these proteins have been identified as enzymes, and their substrates include nucleoside triphosphates, co-enzymes, sugar nucleotides, and dinucleoside polyphosphates. Although seemingly diverse, these compounds share a common structural feature. They are all nucleosidediphosphates linked to some other moiety, x; hence the acronym, Nudix (1Bessman M.J. Frick D.N. O'Handley S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25059-25062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). In addition to the structural similarity of these substrates, they are all either potentially toxic or deleterious compounds, cell signaling molecules, regulators, or metabolic intermediates whose concentrations require modulation during the vicissitudes of the cellular environment. The subject of this paper, Orf186, was identified in a BLAST search (7Altschul S.F. Gish W. Meyers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 203: 403-410Crossref Scopus (71363) Google Scholar) as a putative 186-amino acid protein, locus YRFE, in Escherichia coli (GenBank accession no. P45799). Herein, we describe the cloning and expression of the orf186 gene, and the purification and initial characterization of the resulting protein. Orf186 is a novel enzyme, contains the Nudix box, and hydrolyzes the sensitive metabolic intermediates, adenosine(5′)triphospho(5′)adenosine (Ap3A), 1The abbreviations used are: Ap3A, adenosine(5′)triphospho (5′)adenosine; Ap2A, adenosine(5′)diphospho(5′)adenosine; Ap4A, adenosine(5′)tetraphospho(5′)adenosine. ADP-ribose, and NADH, all derivatives of the nucleoside diphosphate, ADP. Thus, Orf186 is a new member of the Nudix hydrolase family. Primers were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Biochemicals and enzymes were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise noted. E. coli strain MG1655 was kindly provided by Dr. Frederick R. Blattner (University of Wisconsin). Other common organisms and vectors were from laboratory stocks. The orf186 gene was amplified fromE. coli strain MG1655 chromosomal DNA using the polymerase chain reaction. The oligonucleotides d(GCGCGCGGTACCGATGAGCAAATCATTACAAAAACC) and d(GCGCGCGGATCCTTACACTCGCCCCTGCCC) were used as primers to amplify the gene and incorporate a KpnI restriction site at the start of the gene and a BamHI restriction site at the end of the gene. The amplified gene was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, digested with KpnI and BamHI, and ligated into the KpnI and BamHI restriction sites of plasmid pTRC99A. The resulting plasmid pTRCorf186 was used to transform E. coli strain HB101. The orf186 gene was subcloned from pTRCorf186 using a modification (8Barik S. White B.A. PCR Protocols: Current Methods and Applications. 15. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1993: 277-286Google Scholar) of the megaprimer method (9Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar) for site-directed mutagenesis. The oligonucleotides d(GGCCGCTGGCGCACATGATGGATTTG) and d(GCCAGGCAAATTCTG) were used to create a megaprimer containing a silent mutation of T to C at position 462 of orf186, thereby eliminating the NdeI site in the orf186 gene but retaining the histidine encoded for at this position. The purified megaprimer and the oligonucleotide d(GCGCGCGCATATGAGCAAATCATTACAAAAACC) were used as primers to amplify the orf186 gene, incorporating the mutation described above, as well as anNdeI site at the start of the gene, and a BamHI site at its end. The amplified gene was digested with NdeI and BamHI restriction enzymes and ligated into theNdeI and BamHI restriction sites of plasmid pET11b to place the orf186 gene under control of a T7lac promoter for expression. The resulting plasmid, pETorf186(mut462) was used to transform E. coli strain DH5α for storage and E. coli strain BL21(DE3) for expression. E. coli strain BL21(DE3) containing pETorf186(mut462) was grown at 37 °C in three stages. A single colony was inoculated into 10 ml of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and grown to anA 600 of 0.4. The cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with 0.9% NaCl, and added to 100 ml of fresh LB medium plus ampicillin. These cells were grown to anA 600 of 0.6, collected and washed as above, and added to 2 liters of fresh medium plus ampicillin. When growth reached an A 600 of 0.6, the culture was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and grown for an additional 2 h. The induced cells were harvested, washed by suspension in a buffered saline solution, resuspended in 2 volumes of buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmdithiothreitol), sonicated, centrifuged, and the precipitate was discarded. The protein concentration of the supernatant was adjusted to 10 mg/ml with buffer A (Fraction I). A typical preparation yielded approximately 200 mg of protein from 3 g of cells. To Fraction I was added 0.1 volume of 10% streptomycin sulfate, and after 15 min on ice, the precipitate was discarded. Approximately 60% of the enzymatic activity remained in the supernatant. The concentration of streptomycin was raised to 2% with 25% streptomycin sulfate, and this solution was stored on ice overnight. The precipitate was collected and dissolved in 4 ml of buffer A containing 10% ammonium sulfate (Fraction II). Fraction II was loaded onto a 2.5 × 60-cm column of Sephadex G100 and eluted with buffer A containing 50 mm NaCl. The fractions containing the bulk of the enzyme were combined (Fraction III), and concentrated by precipitation in 45% ammonium sulfate (Fraction IV). The purified enzyme was stable for months when stored at −80 °C. In the standard assay, the hydrolysis of Ap3A to AMP and ADP was measured by converting the products to Pi and adenosine with calf intestinal phosphatase. The reaction mixture contained (in 50 μl): 2 mmAp3A, 50 mm Tris, pH 9, 0.5 mmMgCl2, 1% glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.2 unit of calf intestinal phosphatase, and 0–1 milliunit of enzyme. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 250 μl of 4 mm EDTA. The Piproduced was measured by the colorimetric method of Ames and Dubin (10Ames B.N. Dubin D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A unit of Orf186 cleaves 1 μmol of substrate/min. The identity of the products and the stoichiometry of the reaction were analyzed by paper electrophoresis (11Markham R. Smith J.D. Biochem. J. 1952; 52: 552-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and high performance liquid chromatography in scaled-up standard reaction mixtures, from which calf intestinal phosphatase was omitted. Elimination of the NdeI restriction site in the wild type orf186 gene, by making a silent mutation at position 462, enabled us to place orf186 between the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET11b, directly down stream from a ribosome binding site and under control of a T7 lac promoter for optimal expression. The sequence of the cloned gene agrees with that reported for orf186 (accession no. P45799), except for the engineered T → C transition at position 462 (data not shown). The pETorf186 plasmid was unstable in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) when the culture was grown to high cell density, presumably due to a selective disadvantage upon depletion of ampicillin. Therefore, the cultures were grown stepwise, centrifuged, and suspended in fresh medium containing ampicillin, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” With this procedure, virtually 100% of the cells retained the plasmid, as determined by plating aliquots on selective agar. Expression of the gene results in the appearance of a major band on a denaturing gel (Fig. 1), corresponding to a 21.5-kDa protein not detectable in the strain containing pET11b without the insert. When the crude extract is brought to a concentration of 1% streptomycin sulfate to remove nucleic acids, approximately 40% of the enzyme precipitates and 60% remains in solution. Increasing the concentration of streptomycin in the supernatant to 2% results in a quantitative precipitation of the remainder of the enzyme, while leaving many of the other proteins behind. Subsequent fractionation by gel filtration and concentration by ammonium sulfate precipitation led to a preparation substantially free of contaminating proteins (Fig. 1). Orf186 migrated on the SDS gel as expected for the 21-kDa polypeptide predicted from its amino acid composition. However, when chromatographed on a pre-calibrated gel filtration column, it appeared as a symmetrical peak in a region expected for a 43-kDa protein. Thus, it is quite possible that the enzyme exists as a homodimer in its native state; however, at present, no further work has been done to investigate this issue. The enzyme has optimal activity at a distinctly alkaline pH. In Tris buffer, the maximum rate of hydrolysis for Ap3A is at pH 9.0, with the rate falling to <50% at pH 7.5. In glycine buffer, the maximum is at pH 10 with a 50% reduction in rate at pH 8. This alkaline pH optimum is typical of four other Nudix hydrolases we have characterized, namely MutT dGTPase, pH 9 (12Bhatnagar S.K. Bullions L.C. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9050-9054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); NADH pyrophosphatase, pH 8.5 (13Frick D.N. Bessman M.J. J. Biol.

These relatively high pH optima may implicate the guanido group of arginine in the binding of the pyrophosphate-containing substrates, and in the mechanism of catalysis, as has been implied for several other enzymatic reactions involving phosphate esters (16Riordan J.F. McElvaney K.D. Borders C.L.J. Science. 1977; 195: 884-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). We have noted that arginine is one of the four absolutely conserved amino acids in all of the proteins containing the Nudix box (1Bessman M.J. Frick D.N. O'Handley S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25059-25062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar), and we have observed that the Nudix hydrolases are inactivated by carbonyl reagents targeting arginine. 2C. A. Dunn and M. J. Bessman, unpublished observations. The enzyme has an absolute requirement for a divalent cation, achieving optimal activity with 0.5 mm Mg2+, but Zn2+ and Mn2+ can partially substitute, sustaining rates of hydrolysis of 34% and 17%, respectively, on Ap3A. No activity was detected in the presence of Co2+ or Ca2+. These metal ion effects clearly distinguish the Orf186 enzyme from another Ap3A hydrolase purified from E. coli (17Hurtado C. Ruiz A. Sillero A. Sillero M.A.G. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 1718-1723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that cannot substitute Mg2+ with Mn2+ or Zn2+. Furthermore, it does not hydrolyze NAD+ as does Orf186 (see below), and it has a specific activity (units per mg) about 300-fold lower than Orf186. Table I lists a number of biochemicals tested as potential substrates for Orf186. Several features are noteworthy. In contrast to MutT, the first member of the Nudix family studied (18Bhatnagar S.K. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8953-8957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Orf17 (15O'Handley S.F. Frick D.N. Bullions L.C. Mildvan A.S. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24649-24654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), both of which hydrolyze ribo- and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, Orf186 has no detectable activity on these compounds. Instead, it seems to be specific for nucleoside pyrophosphates in which one of the moieties is ADP. Thus, Ap2A, Ap3A, ADP-ribose, and NADH are all good substrates, as well as Ap3G and Ap37-methyl-G. However, when the remaining adenine is replaced by guanine, as in Gp3G, the activity falls dramatically. Activity on the sugar nucleotides reinforces this observation. Both ADP-glucose and ADP-mannose, although not indigenous to E. coli, are hydrolyzed at a significant rate, whereas the corresponding GDP- and UDP-sugars, more characteristic metabolites, are not. Additionally, when adenine is replaced by hypoxanthine as in deamino-NADH, the presence of the 6-amino instead of a keto group reduces the activity 100 fold.Table ISubstrate specificity of Orf186Substrate1-aAp3A, adenosine (5′)triphospho(5′)adenosine.

Open table in a new tab In the ApnA series, activity falls off sharply whenn > 3. This could be due to steric constraints at the active site of the enzyme, or to electrostatic effects related to the additional phosphates, since ATP, itself, is not a significant substrate. Table II compares kinetic constants for some of the favored substrates. Their turnover numbers (k cat) are all in the same range. This is true, also, for the K m values of the first four compounds. However, the K m for NAD+ is approximately 100-fold higher than the rest, leading to a “catalytic efficiency” (k cat/K m) 50–80-fold lower than the other substrates. This may have important physiological consequences for the cell (see “Discussion”).Table IIKinetic parameters for Orf186SubstrateV maxk catK mk cat/K munits mg−1s−1nm104M−1s−1Ap3A31.5 ± 0.911.1 ± 0.30.147 ± 0.0167.6 ± 1.0Ap2A24.3 ± 0.48.6 ± 0.10.151 ± 0.0095.7 ± 0.4ADP-ribose28.0 ± 1.09.9 ± 0.40.220 ± 0.0274.5 ± 0.7NADH22.1 ± 0.57.8 ± 0.20.119 ± 0.0116.6 ± 0.8NAD+39.3 ± 2.413.9 ± 0.914.9 ± 2.20.090 ± 0.018 Open table in a new tab The course of hydrolysis of Ap3A was measured in a standard reaction mixture (minus alkaline phosphatase) scaled up 20-fold. At intervals, aliquots were removed and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. Fig. 2 shows the disappearance of Ap3A and the commensurate appearance of AMP and ADP. For every molecule of Ap3A hydrolyzed, one molecule each of AMP and ADP was formed, e.g. at 7.5 min, 37 nmol of Ap3A were lost, and 35 and 34 nmol of AMP and ADP were formed, respectively. At 30 min, the values (in order) were 69, 67, and 67. No Pi was detected throughout the course of the reaction. Therefore, the reaction may be written as shown below. Ap3A+H2O→AMP+ADPREACTION 1 The products formed from NADH, ADP-ribose, Ap2A, Ap3G, and adenosine(5′)tetraphospho(5′)adenosine (Ap4A) were also examined. In each case, AMP was always formed as one of the products, and the remainder of the molecule was liberated intact. Two of the substrates are of special interest. Ap3G+H2O→AMP+GDPREACTION 2 Neither GMP nor ADP is produced, indicating that the substrate is oriented asymmetrically at the catalytic site. Nucleophilic attack by water could occur on the α or β phosphorus (with respect to the adenosine moiety) leading to the observed products. It is noteworthy that H218O studies have shown that two other Nudix hydrolases, the MutT dGTPase and the Orf17 dATPase, attack the less favorable (more shielded) β phosphorus, forming dGMP (or dAMP) and PPi (15O'Handley S.F.

It would be of interest to do similar studies with the Orf186 diadenosine triphosphatase to test the generality of this mechanism. Another substrate worth noting is Ap4A. Although it is hydrolyzed at only 1% of the rate of Ap3A, our analysis of the products (data not shown) indicate that it is cleaved according to the following reaction. Ap4A+H2O→AMP+ATPREACTION 3 This is the first example of an “asymmetric” Ap4A hydrolase in prokaryotes. Previous reports had relegated this activity to eukaryotes, since all other enzymes prepared from eubacteria or archaea hydrolyze Ap4A “symmetrically,” producing 2 mol of ADP (for review, see Ref. 20Guranowski A. Sillero A. McClennan A.G. Ap4A and Other Dinucleoside Polyphosphates. CRC Press, Inc, Boca Raton1992: 81-133Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows the results of a recent BLAST search (7Altschul S.F. Gish W. Meyers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 203: 403-410Crossref Scopus (71363) Google Scholar) for polypeptide sequences homologous to the Nudix box. The broad biodiversity is self-evident, suggesting that representatives of this family of proteins are of primordial origin and were conserved during evolution. We have instituted a systematic study of the members of the group to delimit the scope of reactions they catalyze, and to ascertain whether they exhibit a functional commonality in cellular metabolism. At present, the genes coding for 11 of the proteins listed in Fig. 3 have been cloned, and the expressed proteins were identified as enzymes. These are shown in Fig. 4along with their major substrates, which, although quite different in structure and metabolic origin, are all derivatives of nucleoside diphosphates. The first of these enzymes, the MutT nucleoside triphosphatase (12Bhatnagar S.K. Bullions L.C. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9050-9054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Bhatnagar S.K. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8953-8957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was found to be defective in the originalmutT1 mutator strain (21Bhatnagar S.K. Bullions L.C. Lew G. Bessman M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2802-2803Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thereby accounting for the >1000-fold increase in spontaneous mutation frequency in organisms defective in this gene (22Treffers H.P. Spinelli V. Belser N.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1954; 40: 1064-1071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since then, homologous enzymes containing the Nudix box have been found in Streptococcus pneumoniae(6Mejean V. Salles C. Bullions L.C. Bessman M.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 11: 323-330Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar), Proteus vulgaris (23Kamath A.V. Yanofsky C.

Chem. 1995; 270: 25942-25948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This subset of Nudix hydrolases most likely prevent the specific AT → CG transversions seen in the mutator strains (27Yanofsky C. Cox E., C. Horn V. Genetics. 1966; 55: 274-281Google Scholar) by sanitizing the nucleotide pool of a mutagenic form of dGTP (12Bhatnagar S.K. Bullions L.C. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9050-9054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), possibly 8-oxo-dGTP (28Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Nature. 1992; 355: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). The next enzyme in Fig. 4, Orf17 dATPase (15O'Handley S.F. Frick D.N. Bullions L.C. Mildvan A.S. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24649-24654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), may play a similar role in hydrolyzing the recently discovered, and potentially mutagenic, 2-hydroxy-dATP (29Kamiya H. Kasai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19446-19450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), or in monitoring the accumulation of dATP, the major negative effector of deoxynucleotide synthesis (30Thelander L. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 133-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). The following enzyme, Orf257, is an unusual NADH pyrophosphatase, 100 times more active on the reduced form of the coenzyme than on NAD+ (13Frick D.N. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1529-1534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). It could play a role in maintaining the pivotal cellular NADH/NAD+ ratio important in balancing the anabolic versus catabolic pathways, as has been suggested previously for hydrolases active on NAD+(31McCreanor G. Bender D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 759: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The next enzyme, GDP-mannose hydrolase, could play a role in recycling nucleoside diphosphate sugar intermediates and diverting them for reutilization in different pathways during cell maturation, as originally suggested for other sugar nucleotides (32Glaser L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 101: 6-15PubMed Google Scholar, 33Sonnino S. Carminatti H. Cabib E. Archiv. Biochem. Biophys. 1966; 116: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Also in Fig. 4, the Ap4A hydrolase, purified from human placenta (34Lazewska D. Starzynska E. Guranowski A. Protein Exp. Purif. 1993; 4: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) contains the Nudix box signature sequence, as does the enzyme from pig (35Thorne N.M.H. Hankin S. Wilkinson M.C. Nunez C.

Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Ap4A is a member of the general class of diadenosine polyphosphates, ApnA, where n = 2–6. Since the discovery of these compounds (37Zamecnik P.C. Stephenson M.L. Janeway C.M. Randerath K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1966; 24: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), considerable interest has been generated by reports of their involvement in several areas of cell physiology including the responses to heat shock, oxidative stress, and starvation, in cell proliferation and DNA replication and repair, as neurotransmitters, effectors of platelet aggregation, vasotone regulators etc. (for reviews, see Refs. 38Baxi M.D. Vishwanatha J.K. J. Pharmacol. Toxicol. Methods. 1995; 33: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar and39McLennan A.G. Ap4A and Other Dinucleoside Polyphosphates. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992Google Scholar). Although the mechanism(s) of action of these compounds is still in question, the plethora of reports citing their complicity augurs their importance.Figure 4Enzymes of the Nudix hydrolase family.Listed are those proteins containing the Nudix box characterized as enzymes, along with their preferred substrates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Orf186, described in this paper, is a bona fide member of the Nudix hydrolases, of particular interest, since it recognizes three different substrates characteristic of this family of enzymes. A role played by its NADH hydrolase activity in maintaining the optimal NADH/NAD+ ratio, referred to above, may be of particular importance during periods of anaerobiosis, since the essentially reversible NAD+-linked oxidoreduction reactions would shut down due to the accumulation of NADH in the absence of acceptor oxygen. A second major substrate of Orf186 is Ap3A, a member of the broadly distributed ApnA family implicated in the diverse physiological responses mentioned above. Recently, Barnes et al. (40Barnes L.D. Garrison P.N. Siprashvili Z. Guranowski A. Robinson A.K. Ingram S.W. Croce C.M. Masataka O. Huebner K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11529-11535Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) reported that the human fragile histidine triad protein (FHIT) is an Ap3A hydrolase. This enzyme is the product of the putative human tumor suppressor gene, FHIT, at 3p14.2, found to be aberrant in cell lines derived from cancers of the lung, esophagus, stomach, and colon (41Ohta M. Inoue H. Cotticelli M.G. Kastury K. Baffa R. Palazzo J. Siprashvili Z. Mori M. McCue P Druck T. Croce C.M. Huebner K. Cell. 1996; 84: 587-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar, 42Sozzi G. Veronese M.L. Negrini M. Baffa R. Cotticelli M.G. Inoue H. Tornielli S. Pilotti S. De Gregorio L. Pastorino U. Pierotti M.A. Ohta M. Huebner K. Croce C.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 17-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). The connection between neoplasia and a defect in Ap3A hydrolysis is not readily apparent, but it focuses attention on this member of the ApnA family and stimulates interest in the role of Ap3A inE. coli metabolism, which may be more amenable to investigation than human cell lines. The third significant substrate, ADP-ribose, is a by-product of the ubiquitous NAD+-linked ADP-ribosylation reactions implicated in a broad range of cellular regulatory processes (for review, see Refs. 43Ueda K. Hayaishi O. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 73-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar and 44Moss J. Zahradka P. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; : 138Google Scholar). Hydrolytic removal of the mono- or poly(ADP-ribosyl) groups from modified proteins produces free ADP-ribose. In addition, the normal cellular turnover of NAD+ itself, which amounts to approximately 30% and 90% of the total NAD+ synthesis in E. coli and HeLa cells, respectively (45Olivera B.M. Hughes K.T. Cordray P. Roth J.R. Jacobson M.K. Jacobson E.L. ADP-Ribose Transfer Reactions. Springer-Verlag, New York1989: 353-360Crossref Google Scholar), is in part due to the production of ADP-ribose and nicotinamide by NAD+-glycohydrolase. A role for Orf186 would be the recycling of the ADP-ribose moiety thus formed. Perhaps a more important function is to sanitize the metabolic pool of the potentially harmful accumulation of ADP-ribose. Because of its free aldehydic group, ADP-ribose can modify proteins in non-enzymatic glycation reactions, derivatizing terminal amino groups, cysteines, and lysines (46Jacobson E.L. Cervantes-Laurean D. Jacobson M.K. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 138: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 47McDonald L.J. Moss J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 138: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Non-enzymatic glycation of long-lived proteins by reducing sugars increases with age, producing what have been called advanced glycosylation end products, which may be targets for degradation and thereby trigger apoptosis in eukaryotic cells (48Vlassara H. Brownlee M. Cerami A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5588-5592Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 49Bucala R. Cerami A. Adv. Pharmacol. 1992; 23: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 50Kaneto H. Fujii J. Myint T. Miyazawa N. Islam K.N. Yamasaki Y. Taniguchi M. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 855-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Ridding the metabolic pool of ADP-ribose may be especially important for two reasons. First, ADP-ribose is a more active glycating agent, by several orders of magnitude, than the free sugars (51Cervantes-Laurean D. Jacobson E.L. Jacobson M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10461-10469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Second, random or nonspecific ADP-ribosylation could misdirect the cellular recognition systems to, or away from, impostors masquerading as properly tagged proteins. A testimony to the importance of this ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase activity is its widespread distribution. We are presently characterizing an additional highly active ADP-ribose hydrolase from E. coli (Orf209), and other ADP-ribose pyrophosphatases from yeast (YSA1), from Bacillus subtilis (YQKG), from Haemophilus influenzae (YZZG), and from an archaeon, Methanococcus janaschii (MJ1149), all of which contain the Nudix box. 3C. A. Dunn, S. F. O'Handley, S. Sheikh, D. N. Frick, K. Finney, and M. J. Bessman, unpublished observations. One of the human genome expressed sequence tags (EST 348875) codes for a Nudix polypeptide highly homologous to the yeast (YSA1) enzyme, and specific ADP-ribose pyrophosphatases have been partially purified from rat liver and Artemia (52Fernandez A. Ribeiro J.M. Costas M.J. Pinto R.M. Canales J. Cameselle J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1290: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) although the sequences of the latter two enzymes have not been reported. At present, no mutants defective in Orf186 are available to test whether the loss of these enzymatic activities elicits a recognizable phenotype. We are in the process of constructing a null mutant of the yeast YSA1 gene (mentioned above), coding for a highly active ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase, to address the question of phenotype. However, ablating one gene may not seriously compromise the cell, since in our experience, there are several Nudix hydrolases with overlapping specificities that might compensate for the loss of one. This is not altogether unexpected, if the enzymatic process is important for survival. In this respect, it is interesting to note that in a recent search of the partially sequenced genome of Deinococcus radiodurans, an organism noted for its extraordinary resistance to ionizing radiation, we have identified 17 distinct polypeptides containing the Nudix box. Orf186 has proven to be an interesting new member of the Nudix hydrolases, a broadly distributed family of enzymes sharing a common structural motif, a related series of substrates and, perhaps, a common function, i.e. securing the cellular environment. As a result of the vigorous activity in cloning and sequencing of the various genomes, new candidates containing the Nudix box motif are being uncovered at a rapid pace. At present, over 100 have been reported in various prokaryotes, 5 in yeast, and in terms of expressed sequence tags, 2 in rice, 3 in Caenorhabditis elegans, 2 in Arabidopsis, 4 in mouse, and 7 in human. In our limited experience, the Nudix hydrolase activities so far identified in the prokaryotes and archaea have their counterparts in yeast and and higher eukaryotes. If this pattern continues, the use of prokaryotes to discover and characterize new members of this family should simplify the task of identifying their activities, and perhaps their physiological functions in the more complex organisms.

A Src homology-2 (SH2) domain-coding region of a mouse protein was cloned based on its interaction with IR. It was designated mSH2-B based on its high similarity to an earlier reported rat sequence SH2-B. A role of mSH2-B in IGF-I and insulin action was suggested by the interaction of the SH2 domain with activated IGF-IR and IR catalytic fragments but not with an inactive IR catalytic fragment in the yeast two-hybrid system in vivo and by the hormone-dependent association of a glutathione S-transferase (GST) SH2 domain fusion protein of mSH2-B with both receptors in cell extracts. A comparison of IGF-IR and IR mutants lacking individual Tyr autophosphorylation sites for association with GST mSH2-B showed that homologous juxtamembrane (IR960/IGF-IR950) and C-terminal (IR1322/IGF-IR1316) receptor motifs were required. Synthetic phosphopeptides representing IR960 and IR1322 competed for GST mSH2-B binding to the receptor, suggesting that both motifs participate in the association with mSH2-B. Antibodies raised against GST mSH2-B identified a cellular protein of 92 kDa that was not found to be phosphorylated on Tyr. It co-immunoprecipitated with IGF-IR or IR, which was strictly dependent on receptor activation. IR and IGF-IR Tyr phosphorylation motifs were not identified in the complete SH2-B primary structure, suggesting that it may participate as an adapter rather than a substrate in the IGF-I and insulin signaling pathways. Insulin receptor (IR) and the related insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor (IGF-IR) mediate a variety of metabolic and mitogenic cellular responses, some of which may involve unidentified receptor targets.

The insulin receptor (IR) and the closely related IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) have served as a model system for the elucidation of receptor Tyr kinase-mediated signaling mechanisms (3Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 615-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The nature for the physiologic differences between the IGF-I and insulin signals is unclear and may involve cellular targets such as Grb10 and pp120 that exhibit a preference for one of the receptors (4Laviola L.

Major cellular targets that are shared by both receptors include the insulin receptor substrates IRS-1, IRS-2, IRS-3, and Shc, most of which also play established roles in other signaling pathways (6Sun X.J Rothenberg P.

Some of the metabolic responses to insulin must be mediated by mechanisms that parallel PI 3′-kinase, which suggests a role of an undefined alternative IR signaling pathway (11Frevert E.U Kahn B.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). A role of IRS-1 and PI 3′-kinase has been proposed in the insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by GLUT4 glucose transporter translocation (12Kanai F. Ito K. Todaka M. Hayashi H. Kamohara S. Ishii K.

Insulin activates glycogen synthase in CHO cells by an unidentified, Ras- and PI 3′-kinase-independent (wortmannin-independent) mechanism (16Sakaue M. Botwell D. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Despite normal Ras binding to Raf-1, truncation of the IR C terminus impairs Raf-1, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, and MAPK activities, glucose transport, glycogen synthesis, PI 3′-kinase, and phosphoprotein phosphatase-1 activities, whereas mitogenic responses remain largely unimpaired (17Jhun B.H. Haruta T. Meinkoth J.L. Leitner J.W. Draznin B. Saltiel A.R. Pang L. Sasaoka T. Olefsky J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7996-8004Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 18Carel K. DePaolo D. Reusch J.E.-B. Leitner J.W. Draznin B. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2362-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Overexpression of IRS-1 was shown to restore the mitogenic response of a defective IR (Y960A, which fails to activate IRS-1) including activation of PI 3′-kinase but restored only partial glycogen synthesis and failed to restore MAPK activation (19Chen D. VanHorn D.J. White M.F. Backer J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4711-4717Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). IR mutants in the tyrosine kinase region (R1174Q and L1178P) suggest a role of unidentified signaling mediators in the impaired glycogen synthesis, DNA synthesis, and MAPK activation in response to insulin in CHO cells, because IRS-1 appears to be normally activated (20Krook A. Moller D.E. Dib K. O'Rahilly S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7134-7140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Mitogen-activated protein kinase and PI 3′-kinase signaling pathways are not sufficient for IGF-I-induced mitogenesis and tumorigenesis, suggesting a role of unidentified signaling mediators in these important IGF-I actions (21Scrimgeour A.G. Blakesley V.A. Stannard B.S. LeRoith D. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2552-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Such mediators may act in parallel to IRS-1 and IRS-2 and may resemble other adapters known to associate with other receptor tyrosine kinases (22Pawson T Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar). In this study we have characterized the association of a newly identified protein target of 92 kDa, designated mSH2-B, with IGF-IR and IR that is strictly dependent on ligand stimulation for both receptors and was found in a yeast two-hybrid screen (23Riedel H. Wang J. Hansen H. Yousaf N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 1105-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We find that the SH2 domain of mSH2-B as well as the juxtamembrane regions and the C-terminal regions of both receptors are required for the association and that synthetic peptides representing these receptor motifs compete with receptor binding to mSH2-B. These characteristics suggest a role of mSH2-B as a Pro-rich and SH2 domain-containing mediator in IGF-I and insulin action. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against the IGF-IR or IR β subunit were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., monoclonal anti-phospho Tyr antibody PY20 was from Transduction Laboratories, and horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-IgG antibody was from Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories. mSH2-B antiserum was produced by HRP Inc.

We employed the cytoplasmic domains of the IR and IGF-IR as baits in a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify unknown signaling mediators in both receptor pathways from mouse libraries (24Hansen H.

Wang J. Hansen H. Yousaf N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 1105-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) that was scanned against the sequence data base. It was designated mSH2-B because one sequence with high similarity was identified that had earlier been reported in rat as SH2-B (40Osborne M.A. Dalton S. Kochan J.P. Biotechnology. 1995; 13: 1474-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). SH2-B (GenBank™ data base accession number U57391) had been found based on its association with the Fc epsilon RI receptor in a modified yeast two-hybrid screen, and its complete protein-coding region was isolated and shown to contain several Pro-rich sequences (40Osborne M.A. Dalton S. Kochan J.P. Biotechnology. 1995; 13: 1474-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The C-terminal fragment encoding the SH2 domain and adjacent sequences of mSH2-B that was identified in our two-hybrid screen displayed only few nucleotide replacements C1900T, C1918T, G1945A, C1981T, A1982G, A2023G, T2065C, T2077C, T2098A, T2257C, and A2261G, which resulted in a single aa change S547G when compared with the rat SH2-B sequence, which is represented by the first letter and its position number (40Osborne M.A. Dalton S. Kochan J.P. Biotechnology. 1995; 13: 1474-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). These changes are likely explained by species-specific differences. A second related human sequence (GSDB, DDBJ, EMBL, and NCBI data base accession number AB000520) was identified that encodes a putative adapter designated APS that appears to represent a related but distinct gene based on a considerable number of aa replacements when compared with mSH2-B and rat SH2-B (41Yokouchi M. Suzuki R. Masuhara M. Komiya S. Inoue A. Yoshimura A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). When introduced into yeast strains carrying different test bait plasmids, all identified sequences including mSH2-B specifically associated with the activated IGF-IR and IR cytoplasmic domains but not with control baits including the Ser/Thr protein kinase Cδ, the insulin receptor substrate IRS-1, and the commonly used test protein lamin C (Fig. 1). The kinase-inactivated IR mutant K1018A scored negative, demonstrating the requirement of an activated receptor kinase for any of the SH2 domain associations (Fig. 1). We investigated this association biochemically by testing a GST mSH2-B fusion protein for its association with IGF-IR and IR in cell extracts. A GST mSH2-B fusion construct was prepared, and the protein was expressed in and partially purified from E. coli and mixed with detergent extracts of IGF-IR or IR overexpressing cells. IGF-IR and IR co-precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose beads directed against GST as detected in immunoblots with receptor-specific antibodies (Fig. 2). The association was strictly dependent on receptor activation by the respective ligand. Similarly, the association of the SH2 domain of mSH2-B in the two-hybrid screen had been observed with an active but not with an inactivated IR cytoplasmic domain under in vivo conditions in the yeast nucleus. If the observed associations were indirect the same adaptor protein would need to be present and active in the yeast nucleus and in mammalian detergent cell extracts under very different experimental conditions. Because this is unlikely our data suggest that mSH2-B binds directly to the receptors without the involvement of an intermediate protein. Various IR and IGF-IR mutants in the juxtamembrane or C-terminal receptor regions were employed to test their impact on the association with the SH2 domain of mSH2-B. Cell lines overexpressing individual mutants were ligand-stimulated, and detergent cell extracts were mixed with GST mSH2-B. Precipitation with glutathione-Sepharose failed to precipitate juxtamembrane mutants IGF-IR Y950F and IR Y960F as well as C-terminal mutants IGF-IR Y1316F, IR Y1322C, IR Y1316F/Y1322F (YF2), or dCT lacking 43 aa of the IR C terminus (Fig. 3, A and B). To test whether these motifs are in fact able to bind to mSH2-B, synthetic phosphopeptides representing these regions were tested for competition with normal IR binding to GST mSH2-B. In accordance with the receptor mutant analysis, peptides representing Tyr960 and Tyr1322 abolished IR binding in contrast to peptides representing other receptor regions (Fig. 3 C). These data suggest that homologous sites of both receptors at IGF-IR Tyr950/IR Tyr960 in the juxtamembrane region and at IGF-IR Tyr1316/IR Tyr1322 at the C terminus are involved in the interaction with the SH2 domain of mSH2-B. To learn more about the cellular SH2-B protein, a rabbit antiserum was raised against GST mSH2-B that identified a 92-kDa protein in immunoblots of CHO and mouse fibroblast cell extracts (Fig. 4, A and B). To evaluate the association of this protein with the IR and IGF-IR, fibroblasts overexpressing either receptor were ligand stimulated, and detergent cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with receptor-specific antibodies followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with mSH2-B antiserum. A 92-kDa protein of identical migration was specifically co-precipitated with either receptor, strictly dependent on ligand activation (Fig. 4, A and B). When cell extracts were precipitated with mSH2-B antiserum in complementary experiments, IR (Fig. 4 A) and IGF-IR (Fig. 4 B) were co-precipitated from the respective cell lysates in a ligand-dependent fashion. Our data indicate that mSH2-B associates with IR and IGF-IR upon receptor activation in three independent approaches based on 1) two-hybrid constructs, 2) GST mSH2-B fusion protein, and 3) authentic cellular SH2-B. These findings strongly suggest that mSH2-B plays an as yet unidentified role in insulin and IGF-I action as a direct receptor target. The molecular size of the detected 92-kDa protein is in line with the predicted size for an expression product of 768 aa for the complete rat SH2-B coding sequence based on the observation that proteins frequently migrate more slowly in SDS-PAGE than predicted from their primary structure (40Osborne M.A. Dalton S. Kochan J.P. Biotechnology. 1995; 13: 1474-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We cannot exclude that other forms of SH2-B may exist that have not been detected. The 92-kDa protein was consistently observed in several cell lines, specifically recognized by mSH2-B antiserum, and co-precipitated with IGF-IR and IR in a strictly ligand-dependent fashion. It represents a promising candidate for a Pro-rich and SH2 domain-containing mediator involved in the IGF-IR and IR signaling pathways that appears to be shared by both receptors similar to most known IGF-IR and IR targets. The cloned C-terminal SH2 domain coding fragment of mouse mSH2-B displays high sequence homology to the published rat sequence, designated SH2-B (40Osborne M.A. Dalton S. Kochan J.P. Biotechnology. 1995; 13: 1474-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), suggesting that the observed changes are explained by species-specific differences. In our efforts to clone the complete mouse mSH2-B coding sequence we have isolated a number of sequence variants that suggest the existence of a family of SH2-B-related mediators including APS, some of which may be generated by differential splicing (41Yokouchi M. Suzuki R. Masuhara M. Komiya S. Inoue A. Yoshimura A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 42Rui L. Mathews L.S. Hotta K. Gustafson T., A. Carter-Su C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6633-6644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because many IR and IGF-IR targets including IRS-1 (6Sun X.J Rothenberg P. Kahn C.R. Backer J.M. Araki E. Wilden P.A. Cahill D.A. Goldstein B.J. White M.F. Nature. 1991; 352: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar), IRS-2 (8Sun X.J. Wang L.M. Zhang Y. Yenush L. Myers Jr, M.G. Glasheen E. Lane W.S. Pierce J.H. White M.F. Nature. 1995; 377: 173-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar), and Shc (7Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I. Grignani F. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 93-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar) are receptor substrates that are phosphorylated on Tyr by the ligand-activated receptor Tyr kinase, we began to investigate whether mSH2-B may be a new member of this group. The analysis of its primary structure did not reveal any consensus target sites YMXM or YXXM for the IGF-IR or IR Tyr kinases (6Sun X.J Rothenberg P. Kahn C.R. Backer J.M. Araki E. Wilden P.A. Cahill D.A. Goldstein B.J. White M.F. Nature. 1991; 352: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar), which strongly suggested against a role of mSH2-B as an IGF-IR and IR substrate. This was confirmed in biochemical experiments to evaluate whether SH2-B was phosphorylated on Tyr upon IGF-I or insulin stimulation and recognized by phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies in immunoblots. With these antibodies we consistently failed to detect SH2-B directly in cell lysates or after prior immunoprecipitation with mSH2-B antiserum. Similarly, immunoprecipitation with phosphotyrosine antibodies failed to bring down SH2-B based on subsequent immunoblots with mSH2-B antiserum. IR and IGF-IR autophosphorylation in these experiments confirmed appropriate experimental conditions and ligand stimulation (not shown). Given that an insulin-stimulated IR-associated Ser kinase has been implicated in insulin action (43Carter W.G. Asamoah K.A. Sale G. Biochemistry. 1995; 84: 9488-9499Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) we also addressed the putative phosphorylation of SH2-B on Ser or Thr. However, preliminary experiments failed to identify SH2-B as a phosphoprotein after32P labeling of various fibroblasts (not shown), independent of ligand stimulation (44Riedel H. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 411-424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We consider that SH2-B may not be phosphorylated in response to IGF-I or insulin stimulation or that a weaker SH2-B phosphorylation may not have been detected due to limitations in the sensitivity of the assay (42Rui L. Mathews L.S. Hotta K. Gustafson T., A. Carter-Su C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6633-6644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). mSH2-B may function like other signaling adapter proteins such as Grb2 by forming complexes with other proteins and by directing their intracellular localization (22Pawson T Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar). It may undergo phosphorylation in response to other stimuli that remain to be defined (42Rui L. Mathews L.S. Hotta K. Gustafson T., A. Carter-Su C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6633-6644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Possible functions of mSH2-B may include a positive role in any of the pleiotropic responses to IGF-I and insulin. Alternatively, mSH2-B may be a negative regulator by counter balancing IRS-1, IRS-2, IRS-3, Shc-mediated, or other signals. There are few precedents for such a function, which may, however, provide important regulatory controls in analogy to the opposing actions of Tyr kinases and phosphatases (45Matozaki T. Kasuga M. Cell. Signal. 1996; 8: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A negative regulatory role in insulin action has recently been proposed for the IR target Grb10/IR as one example for such a mechanism (37Liu F Roth R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10287-10291Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Given that other IR and IGF-IR targets have been mapped to associate with the IR Tyr960/IGF-IR Tyr950 motif including GTPase-activating protein and Grb10 or with the IR Tyr1322/IGF-IR Tyr1316 motif including p85 PI 3′-kinase, Syp, SHP-2, and Grb10, mSH2-B is expected to compete with some of these mediators for receptor association and activation (24Hansen H.

https://openalex.org/W2034911857,"Prolonged agonist stimulation of β2-adrenergic receptors results in receptor down-regulation, which is closely associated with a reduction of the corresponding mRNA, an effect mediated in part by changes in mRNA stability. Transfection experiments with human β2-adrenergic receptor cDNAs bearing or lacking the untranslated regions suggested that the essential agonist sensitivity of the mRNA resides within the 3′-untranslated region. The importance of this region was further confirmed in gel shift experiments; cytosolic preparations from agonist-stimulated DDT1-MF2 smooth muscle cells caused a shift of β2-adrenergic receptor mRNAs containing the 3′-untranslated region. Progressive 3′-terminal truncations of the receptor cDNA led to the identification of an AU-rich element at positions 329–337 of the 3′-untranslated region as the responsiblecis-acting element. Substitution of this motif by cytosine residues almost completely abolished mRNA down-regulation and inhibited the formation of the RNA-protein complex. Even though the β2-adrenergic receptor AU-rich element showed two U → A transitions compared with the recently proposed AU-rich element consensus sequence, it revealed an almost identical destabilizing potency. Fusion of the β2-adrenergic receptor 3′-untranslated region to the β-globin coding sequence dramatically reduced the half-life of the chimeric transcript in an agonist- and cAMP-dependent manner.

Long term desensitization often involves a significant reduction of receptor numbers, which is termed receptor down-regulation. Several distinct molecular mechanisms affecting both mRNA and protein levels contribute to receptor down-regulation (2Lohse M.J. Biochim. Biophys.

Shyu A.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar, 10Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AU-rich elements (AREs) are often found in the 3′-UTRs of these mRNAs and appear to be key determinants of their short half-lives, even if mRNA turnover does not strictly depend on these motifs. The optimal destabilization motif was recently suggested to be UUAUUUA(U/A)(U/A) (11Lagnado C.A. Brown C.Y. Goodall G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7984-7995Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 12Zubiaga A.M. Belasco J.G. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2219-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), but there is also evidence that an AUUUA pentamer need not be an integral part of a functional ARE (13Peng S.S.Y. Chen C.Y.A. Shyu A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1490-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). On the contrary, it appears that each ARE represents a combination of structurally distinct domains, such as AUUUA motifs, AU nonamers, and U-rich elements, and that it is the combination of these sequence elements that determines its ultimate destabilizing function (14Chen C.Y.A. Shyu A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8471-8482Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). AREs appear to represent recognition sites for several cytoplasmic and nucleus-associated RNA-binding proteins, which mediate RNA degradation (15Malter J.S.

For the β2AR mRNA, three binding proteins have been described so far: (i) the β-adrenergic receptor mRNA-binding protein (βARB), a M r 35,000 cytosolic protein identified in hamster DDT1-MF2 smooth muscle cells (20Port J.D. Huang L.Y. Malbon C.C. J. Biol.

Cell. Physiol. 1995; 163: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar); and (iii) the M r 37,000 AU-rich element RNA-binding/degradation factor (AUF1), which has been shown to bind also β1AR mRNA (22Pende A. Tremmel K.D. DeMaria C.T. Blaxall B.C. Minobe W.A. Sherman J.A. Bisognano J.D. Bristow M.R. Brewer G. Port J.D. J. Biol.

During the preparation of this manuscript, Tholanikunnel and Malbon (25Tholanikunnel B.G. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11471-11478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) reported the first characterization of such an element, a 20-nucleotide AU-rich domain with an unusual AUUUUA hexamer core, which is obligate for the destabilization of the hamster β2AR mRNA. However, a sequence alignment revealed no equivalent within the human β2AR transcript (26Kobilka B.K. Dixon R.A.F. Frielle T. Dohlman H.G. Bolanowski M.A. Sigal I.S. Yang-Feng T.L. Francke U.

In this study, we report the identification of a nonconsensus AU-rich nonamer within the β2AR 3′-UTR as a critical determinant for the agonist-induced destabilization of the human receptor transcript and provide evidence that the participation of a RNA-binding protein and of cAMP are required for β2AR mRNA down-regulation in vivo. The β2AR vectors used for transient transfections were constructed based on the plasmid pBC12BI-β2 (26Kobilka B.K. Dixon R.A.F. Frielle T. Dohlman H.G. Bolanowski M.A. Sigal I.S. Yang-Feng T.L.

A. 1987; 84: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar), from which a 1.95-kb fragment corresponding to the complete human β2AR transcript was excised and inserted into the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Deletion constructs lacking either one or both untranslated regions were obtained by PCR amplification of the respective cDNA fragments from pBC12BI-β2. β2AR 3′-UTR C-terminal truncation mutants were generated by deletion of a PvuII–SmaI (Δ157) and aPpuMI–SmaI fragment (Δ313), respectively, from plasmid pBC12BI-β2. The vectors used as templates for in vitro transcription reactions were constructed by amplification of two ∼1-kilobase pair fragments, each comprising one-half of the receptor transcript. These two fragments, β2AR5′ and β2AR3′, were cloned into pGEM9Zf(−) (Promega) under the control of the T7 promoter. A 130-bp poly(A) stretch was inserted downstream of the β2AR cDNAs to obtain polyadenylated mRNAs. The mutations of the ARE at positions 329–337 of the β2AR 3′-UTR were introduced by PCR. 247-bp fragments covering the 3′-halves of the 3′-UTR were amplified using the mutagenesis primers β 2 AR.seq.4, β 2 AR.seq.41, β 2 AR.seq.42, and β 2 AR.seq.43, respectively, and β 2 fus.rev (for all primers see Table I). These fragments were subsequently used as “reverse primers” in a second PCR together with β 2 fus.seq.2. The resulting 571-bp mutated 3′-UTRs were fused to the β2AR coding sequence in the vector pcDNA3-β2Δ3′UTR. Additonally, pGEM vectors bearing the mutated AREs were constructed analogous to β2AR3′ as templates for in vitrotranscription.Table IList of the primers used in this studyPrimerSequencePositionβ2AR coding β2AR.seq.25′-GGGCAACCCGGGAACGGCAG-3′4–23 β2AR.rev.45′-GGCCTCCTGAAAGACCCTGG-3′678–659β2AR 3′-UTR β2AR.seq.45′-AGTATTAGGGGCCCCCCCCCGCTGCTGG-3′318–347 β2AR.seq.415′-AGTATTAGGGGTTATTTATTGCTGCTGG-3′318–347 β2AR.seq.425′-AGTATTAGGGGTCCTCTATTGCTGCTGG-3′318–347 β2AR.seq.435′-AGTATTAGGGGTAACCCATTGCTGCTGG-3′318–347 β2fus.seq.25′-CCCAGCGGCCGCAGCAGTTTTTCTAG-3′1–14 β2fus.rev.25′-CCCATCTAGACATGGTCAAACATTT-3′554–540αB-crystallin cry.seq5′-CCCTTCTTTCCTTTCCACTCCCC-3′62–84 cry.rev5′-CAGCAGGCTTCTCTTCACGGGT-3′530–509β-globin hβg.seq5′-CACCATGGTGCACCTGACTCC-3′−4–17 hβg.rev5′-CCTGAAGTTCTCAGGATCCAC-3′315–295 Open table in a new tab For the generation of the β-globin/β2AR 3′-UTR fusion plasmid a 2.2-kilobase pair fragment corresponding to the β-globin primary transcript was excised from pGEM1β-globin and inserted into pcDNA3. After that, a 540-bp DraI–XbaI fragment comprising the β-globin 3′-UTR was replaced by the 546-bp β2AR 3′-UTR excised from pcDNA3-β2Δ5′UTR. The correctness of all constructs was confirmed by double-stranded DNA sequencing. Hamster DDT1-MF2 smooth muscle cells and human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all purchased from Life Technologies, Inc.). Monolayer cultures were harvested at 60–70% confluence, and DDT1-MF2 suspension cultures were maintained at a cell density of about 5 × 105cells/ml. The calcium phosphate precipitation method (28Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar) was used for transfection of HEK293 cells. Transfection efficiencies were determined by cotransfection of a β-galactosidase encoding plasmid, pSVβgal. 48 h after transfection the cells were stimulated with 10 μm (−)-isoproterenol (Sigma) or 10 μmforskolin (Sigma) for the times indicated. To block transcription and/or translation, 5 μg/ml actinomycin D (Roth) and/or 0.5 μg/mlPseudomonas exotoxin A (Sigma), respectively, were added 30 min after the begin of agonist stimulation. At the times indicated, the cells were harvested, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and subjected to RNA analysis. Total RNA was isolated by the AGPC extraction method (29Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63176) Google Scholar), separated on formaldehyde gels, and subsequently transferred to nylon membranes (Qiagen) by downward alkaline capillary transfer (30Chomczynski P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Single-stranded DNA probes were prepared in two steps. First, the respective region was amplified in a “standard” PCR. The resulting double-stranded DNA fragment served as a template in a second, asymmetric PCR that included only the 3′-primer. 20 μm DIG-11-dUTP (Boehringer Mannheim) was added for labeling along with 30 μm dNTPs. The primers used for the preparation of the β2AR probe wereβ 2 AR.seq.2 and β 2 AR.rev.4, spanning a 672-bp fragment immediately downstream of the start codon. Probes specific for αB-crystallin (468 bp, used as an internal standard) and β-globin (319 bp) were amplified using the primerscry.seq/cry.rev and hβg.seq/hβg.rev, respectively. Hybridization was done at 37 °C for 24–48 h in 50% formamide, 5 × SSC, 3 × Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, 0.2% sodium laurylsarcosinate, and 5% dextran sulfate. Chemiluminescent detection was performed using the DIG Luminescent Detection kit (Boehringer Mannheim). The signal intensity on the x-ray films was analyzed densitometrically. Transcripts were generated from 1 μg of linearized template DNA in a total reaction volume of 20 μl in the presence of 1 unit/μl RNase inhibitor, 1 mmATP/CTP/GTP, 0.65 mm UTP, 0.35 mm DIG-UTP, and 2 units/μl T7-RNA-polymerase (all reagents purchased from Boehringer Mannheim). Cotranscriptional capping was performed by using the cap analogue m7(5′)Gppp(5′)G (New England Biolabs) in a concentration 10 times that of GTP. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. RNase-free DNase I (Boehringer Mannheim) was added to remove template DNA. The labeled transcripts were extracted twice with phenol and then once with chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. After a 12-h treatment with either (−)-isoproterenol (10 μm) or vehicle, DDT1-MF2 smooth muscle cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into 20 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 30 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 20 mg/liter benzamidine, 20 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20% glycerol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Samples were sonicated for 20 s, incubated on ice for 30 min, and centrifuged at 50,000 ×g for 20 min. 20–50 μg of supernatant protein was incubated for 30 min at room temperature with ∼1 μg of DIG-labeled RNA in a buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 0.5 μg/μl heparin, and 1 unit/μl RNase inhibitor. Samples were electrophoresed at 20–30 mA for 3 h on nondenaturing 4% polyacrylamide gels and blotted onto nylon membranes as described above. Signals were visualized using the DIG Luminescent Detection kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Since in many cell types the β2AR mRNA down-regulation appears to be mediated by several different processes (2Lohse M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 3Collins S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 497-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 4Hadcock J.R. Malbon C.C. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), we decided to use a transient transfection system to identify the agonist-sensitive region(s) within the β2AR transcript. For this purpose, HEK293 cells were chosen due to their very low level of endogenous βAR as well as the very high transfection efficiency compared with other cell lines. 48 h after the transfection of vectors bearing human β2AR cDNAs corresponding to the complete receptor transcript and to mutants lacking either one or both UTRs, respectively, the cells were stimulated for 12 h with 10 μm isoproterenol, and the β2AR mRNA levels were quantified in Northern analyses (Fig. 1 A). αB-Crystallin, a widely expressed heat-shock protein, was used as an internal standard in all experiments. Cotransfection of a β-galactosidase encoding plasmid and subsequent staining of the cells revealed transfection efficiencies of about 90% in all samples (not shown), so that influences resulting from different transfection efficiencies of various constructs should be minimal. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the β2AR wild-type transcript and the 5′-UTR deletion mutant were down-regulated upon agonist stimulation by 60 ± 6% and 68 ± 8%, respectively, compared with unstimulated controls. The predominant role of elements encoded within the 3′-UTR for transcript destabilization was further confirmed by the respective deletion mutant which showed only a small reduction of the β2AR mRNA level by 12 ± 8%. The mRNA concentration of the transcript covering only the coding sequence remained almost unchanged. These results suggested that the agonist sensitivity of the human β2AR mRNA resides essentially within the 3′-UTR. In a recent study (31Danner S. Lohse M.J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 331: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), we have demonstrated that the agonist-induced β2AR mRNA down-regulation occurs in a cell type-specific manner. In DDT1-MF2 smooth muscle cells, it is caused predominantly at the posttranscriptional level via decreased mRNA stability. It has been shown for several highly labile mRNAs that destabilization motifs may function as recognition sequences for RNA-binding proteins (15Malter J.S. Science. 1989; 246: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 16Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 11: 2460-2466Crossref Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 17Vakalopoulou E. Schaack J. Shenk T.

Biol. 1993; 13: 7652-7665Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Therefore, we attempted to prove the existence of such a factor in DDT1-MF2 cells and to analyze a possible interaction with the human β2AR transcript. DDT1-MF2 cells were grown in suspension cultures, and transcription was blocked by adding actinomycin D to the medium. After various incubation periods, the β2AR mRNA concentrations were quantified in Northern analyses (Fig. 2). The β2AR mRNA half-life of untreated control cells was determined to be about 120 min, whereas in agonist-stimulated cells a ∼50% reduction was observed, resulting in a half-life of ∼50 min. These values are similar to those measured under similar conditions (suspension cultures) by Collins et al. (5Collins S. Bouvier M. Bolanowski M.A. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4853-4857Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Translational blockade by exotoxin A increased the β2AR mRNA half-life to about 80 min in stimulated cells, which indicates that β2AR stimulation indeed induces the synthesis of a protein component, which accounts, at least in part, for receptor mRNA destabilization. To identify the region(s) of the human β2AR mRNA that might be interacting with such a protein component, we established a gel shift assay using the human β2AR mRNA as a template. In vitro transcribed, DIG-labeled, capped, and polyadenylated RNAs corresponding to the 5′-half (189-nucleotide 5′-UTR plus 806-nucleotide coding sequence) and the 3′-half (441-nucleotide coding sequence plus 554-nucleotide 3′-UTR) of the β2AR mRNA, respectively, were incubated with cytosolic extracts prepared either from DDT1-MF2 control cells or cells stimulated with isoproterenol for 12 h. The samples were separated on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto nylon membranes. After chemiluminescent detection, a protein-mRNA complex was only found if cytosolic fractions of stimulated cells were mixed with the 3′-half of the β2AR mRNA (Fig. 3). The addition of exotoxin A to the cells to block de novo protein synthesis inhibited the formation of this complex. These observations are a further indication that the 3′-UTR contains elements critical for the stability of the human β2AR mRNA. Furthermore, they provide evidence that binding protein(s) induced in hamster DDT1-MF2 cells can bind to the human transcript and are apparently involved in this regulation. For a more detailed characterization of the human β2AR 3′-UTR, two truncation mutants lacking the 3′-terminal 157 bp and 313 bp of the receptor cDNA, respectively, were generated, and their degree of agonist-induced β2AR mRNA down-regulation after transient transfection into HEK293 cells was determined (Fig. 4 A). The mRNA level changes of the mutant lacking 157 bp were comparable with those of the wild-type receptor, whereas deletion of 313 bp completely abolished agonist-mediated down-regulation. The respective levels of αB-crystallin mRNA remained unchanged in all three cases. These results provide evidence that the region between positions 241 and 397 of the β2AR 3′-UTR is critical for receptor mRNA destabilization (Fig. 4 B). AU-rich elements have been shown to be key determinants for the destabilization of several highly regulated mRNAs (9Chen C.Y.A. Shyu A.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar, 10Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Their consensus sequence has recently been proposed to be UUAUUUA(U/A)(U/A) (11Lagnado C.A. Brown C.Y. Goodall G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7984-7995Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 12Zubiaga A.M. Belasco J.G. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2219-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Therfore, we looked for elements consisting of at least nine consecutive adenosine or uridine residues within the β2AR 3′-UTR. None of the four regions identified (Table II and Fig. 4 B) exactly fits the proposed consensus sequence. Because of its location in the region shown to be critical for β2AR mRNA destabilization, the motif UAAUAUAUU found at positions 329–337 was of special interest. The sequence differed from the consensus only at positions 2 and 5. To test the importance of this element for β2AR mRNA stability, the wild-type sequence (Fig. 5, WT) was replaced by a stretch of nine cytosine residues (M), and the two constructs were transiently transfected into HEK293 cells as before. Upon agonist stimulation, the mutant β2AR mRNA levels, normalized for the respective values for αB-crystallin, were reduced to only 90 ± 8% of control levels compared with 35 ± 5% for the wild type (Fig. 5). Therefore, this element appears to be absolutely essential for the destabilization of the human β2AR transcript. Three additional ARE point mutants (M1–3, Table III) were generated to provide further insights in the minimal sequence requirements of this motif. In mutant M1, positions 2 and 5 were changed (A → U) so that the resulting ARE corresponded to the suggested consensus sequence (11Lagnado C.A. Brown C.Y. Goodall G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7984-7995Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 12Zubiaga A.M. Belasco J.G. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2219-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The respective transcript showed an almost identical degree of down-regulation in HEK293 cells compared with the wild-type sequence, with a reduction to 32 ± 8% of the unstimulated control (Fig. 5). The flanking adenosine residues of the consensus sequence have been shown to be critical for the destabilizing potency of an ARE (11Lagnado C.A. Brown C.Y. Goodall G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7984-7995Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 12Zubiaga A.M. Belasco J.G. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2219-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). In mutant M2, the adenosine residues at positions 2, 3, and 7, respectively, were exchanged for cytosines. The β2AR mRNA levels after agonist stimulation were only slightly reduced to 87 ± 8%, which confirms the importance of these residues. Finally, in the mutant M3, the three central nucleotides were replaced by cytosines to investigate the function of the ARE core domain. A small but significant decrease in the respective β2AR mRNA levels to 75 ± 7% was observed (Fig. 5), demonstrating that at least for the β2AR ARE the core is not as essential as proposed for the consensus sequence (11Lagnado C.A. Brown C.Y. Goodall G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7984-7995Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 12Zubiaga A.M. Belasco J.G. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell.

As shown in Fig. 6, a gel shift was observed with both the wild-type transcript and the mutant M1, indicating that the protein does not discriminate between these two sequences. No interaction was found with the mutants M and M2, supporting the idea that the flanking adenosine residues are critical for ARE function. For mutant M3, two signals were identified, one corresponding to the free mRNA template and a second with a lower intensity comigrating with the RNA-protein complex (Fig. 6). This agrees with the slight isoproterenol-induced down-regulation of the M3 mutant mRNA shown in Fig. 5. Summarizing these results, the agonist-induced β2AR mRNA destabilization appears to be mediated, at least in part, by an RNA-binding protein recognizing a nonconsensus AU-rich motif at positions 329–337 of the β2AR 3′-UTR, probably via a specific regulatory mechanism. To test the hypothesis of a β2AR-specific regulation of mRNA stability, we asked whether the elements within the β2AR 3′-UTR are sufficient to destabilize a normally stable gene. To consider a possible participation of sequence motifs beside the ARE, the complete human β2AR 3′-UTR was fused to the coding se"

In an attempt to identify proteins present in these structures, GLUT4-enriched vesicles prepared from rat adipocytes treated with or without insulin were prepared by sucrose velocity gradient centrifugation and immunoadsorbed with anti-GLUT4 antibody. We report here the sequence identification by high performance liquid chromatography-ion trap mass spectrometry of a p75 protein band, long chain acyl-CoA synthetase-1, specifically present in immunoadsorbed GLUT4-containing vesicles but not in vesicles adsorbed by nonimmune serum. Acyl-CoA synthetase activity detected in GLUT4-enriched vesicles prepared by gradient centrifugation from insulin-treated adipocytes was decreased to about the same extent as GLUT4 protein. Additionally, immunoadsorbed GLUT4 vesicles were found to catalyze palmitoylation of proteins when incubated with labeled palmitate, a pathway that requires palmitate esterification with CoA. These data indicate that the insulin-sensitive membrane compartment that sequesters GLUT4 in fat cells contains long chain acyl-CoA synthetase-1 and its product fatty acyl-CoA, shown previously to be required for budding and fusion in membrane trafficking processes.

We report here the sequence identification by high performance liquid chromatography-ion trap mass spectrometry of a p75 protein band, long chain acyl-CoA synthetase-1, specifically present in immunoadsorbed GLUT4-containing vesicles but not in vesicles adsorbed by nonimmune serum. Acyl-CoA synthetase activity detected in GLUT4-enriched vesicles prepared by gradient centrifugation from insulin-treated adipocytes was decreased to about the same extent as GLUT4 protein. Additionally, immunoadsorbed GLUT4 vesicles were found to catalyze palmitoylation of proteins when incubated with labeled palmitate, a pathway that requires palmitate esterification with CoA. These data indicate that the insulin-sensitive membrane compartment that sequesters GLUT4 in fat cells contains long chain acyl-CoA synthetase-1 and its product fatty acyl-CoA, shown previously to be required for budding and fusion in membrane trafficking processes. One of the most important actions of insulin in vivo is that it causes increased glucose utilization in fat and muscle tissues. It is now widely accepted that a major mechanism by which insulin mediates this effect is to increase the number of GLUT4 glucose transporters present on the plasma membrane (1Jhun B. Rampal A.L.

In the resting cell, GLUT4 appears to concentrate in small tubules and specialized vesicles clustered in the vicinity of the endosomal/trans-Golgi network system (4Yang J. Holman G.D. J. Biol.

Biol. 1991; 113: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar) while recycling through exocytosis and endocytosis pathways. Insulin is thought to act primarily by enhancing GLUT4 exocytosis (6Stagsted J. Olsson L. Holman G.D. Cushman S.W. Satoh S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22809-22813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although inhibition of endocytosis also occurs (7Czech M.P. Buxton J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9187-9190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A number of proteins found to be present in GLUT4-containing membranes may relate to the mechanism of GLUT4 recycling (8Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 34: E1-E14Crossref Google Scholar). For example, insulin appears to direct phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, known to be essential for protein sorting in yeast, to GLUT4-containing vesicles isolated from both 3T3-L1 and rat adipocytes (9Heller-Harrison R.A.

Members of the VAMP family have also been documented to colocalize with GLUT4 vesicles (10Cain C.C. Trimble W.S. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol.

Similarities between GLUT4 vesicle trafficking and synaptic vesicle docking and fusion are suggested by the specific cleavage of vesicle proteins by toxins that can inhibit the ability of insulin to stimulate translocation of GLUT4 (14Cheatham B.

In synaptic systems, a core complex of proteins binds NSF1 and a soluble NSF attachment protein (SNAP) to form a large 20 S complex. Subsequent hydrolysis of ATP by NSF, resulting in disruption of this complex, is thought to facilitate the membrane fusion event. NSF and the SNAP proteins have recently been shown to be highly enriched in GLUT4-containing vesicles and low density microsomes under steady state conditions (17Mastick C.C. Falick A.L. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2391-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In this study we present the polypeptide composition of GLUT4-containing vesicles and the identification of sequences corresponding to the long chain acyl-CoA synthetase-1 (EC 6.2.1.3). We demonstrate acyl-CoA synthetase activity to be associated with these vesicles, consistent with the proposed hypothesis (18Glick B.S. Rothman J.E.

Adipocytes were isolated from the epididymal fat pads of male Sprague-Dawley rats (150–175 g) by collagenase digestion using Krebs-Ringer/Hepes, pH 7.4, supplemented with 2% bovine serum albumin and 2 mm pyruvate (7Czech M.P. Buxton J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9187-9190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and incubated in the absence or presence of insulin (10−7m) for 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were immediately homogenized and subjected to differential centrifugation as described previously (21Clancy B.M. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 265: 12434-12443Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) to obtain membrane preparations. GLUT4-enriched vesicles were isolated from low density microsomes by sucrose velocity gradient centrifugation as described (9Heller-Harrison R.A. Morin M. Guilherme A. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10200-10204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 22Kandror K.V. Coderre L. Pushkin A.V. Pilch P.F. Biochem.

This material was resuspended in Buffer B (50 mm Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm NaF, 100 mm Na3V04, 1 mmNaPPi, 5 mg/ml aprotinin, and 5 mg/ml leupeptin) and represents the starting GLUT4-enriched vesicles used for all immunoabsorption experiments. For each experiment, 500–1000 μg of GLUT4-enriched vesicles were precleared with Sepharose beads, and the supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes and incubated for 18 h with either anti-GLUT4 IgG (polyclonal 1288) or nonimmune IgG prebound to protein A-Sepharose as described previously (9Heller-Harrison R.A.

The immunoadsorbed vesicles were washed several times and then eluted in sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE 1The abbreviations used are: NSF, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; IC-16, 16-iodohexadecanoic acid; LC, liquid chromatography; NI, nonimmune. and immunoblotting. In labeling experiments GLUT4-enriched vesicle proteins were conjugated to 125I using Bolton-Hunter reagent essentially as described by the manufacturer's instructions. The radiolabeled GLUT4-enriched vesicle proteins were dissolved in SDS-lysis buffer, denatured at 95 °C and then resolved by SDS-PAGE on 5–15% gradient gels. Proteins were then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and exposed to X-AR film (Kodak). The bands corresponding to proteins of interest were excised from two single dimensional, 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels after being visualized by copper staining (Bio-Rad). After in gelS-carboxyamidomethylation, the band(s) were subjected to in gel endoproteinase LysC (Wako) digestion. Sequences were determined by capillary high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to the electrospray source of a quadruple ion trap mass spectrometer (Finnigan LCQ) as described by Nash et al. (23Nash H.M. Bruner S.D. Scharer O.D. Kawate T. Addona T.A. Spooner E. Lane W.S. Verdine G.L. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 968-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The instrument was programmed to acquire successive sets of three scan modes consisting of full scan MS over the m/z range 395–1200, followed by two data-dependent scans on the most abundant ion in that full scan. These data-dependent scans allowed the automatic acquisition of a high resolution scan to determine charge state and exact mass and collisionally induced dissociation spectra for peptide sequence information. Manual interpretation of the resulting MS/MS spectra of GLUT4-associated peptides was facilitated with the data base searching algorithm SEQUEST (24Eng J.K. McCormick A.L. Yates III, J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5472) Google Scholar). An acyl-CoA synthetase activity was measured at 30 °C using exogenous fatty acid as substrate by a colometric-spectrophotometric method (25Ichihara K. Shibasaki Y. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 1709-1712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assay involves initial conversion of the fatty acids to their CoA derivative by the endogenous acyl-CoA synthetase with the addition of CoA (500 μm) and ATP (0.5 mm) in AC buffer (150 mm MOPS, pH 7.1, 12 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% methanol, 0.1% Triton X-100). The acyl-CoA product is detected by a series of reactions (acyl-CoA oxidase, 0.2 units/μl; methanol, 1% catalase, 2 units/μl, and 0.6% 4-amino-3-hydrazino-5-mercapto-1,2,4-triazole), which upon oxidization by IO4− (0.375%) gives a purple heteroaromatic dye that can be detected at 550 nm. All assays were carried out within the linear range with respect to reaction time, and the initial rate of reaction was proportional to the amount of enzyme added. Fractions were mixed with AC buffer, and the reaction was started with addition of 0.5 mm ATP, 500 mm CoA, 0.5 mm palmitic acid (10 mCi:0.5 mm, hot to cold). The 16-[125I]-iodohexadecanoic acid (IC-16) (Dr. Marilyn Resh, Rockefeller University, New York, NY) was labeled as outlined in Peseckis et al. (26Peseckis S.M. Deichaite I. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5107-5114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 20 min and quenched by adding 4 × SDS sample buffer and heating the samples to 100 °C. Palmitoylation of IgG was performed by incubating the purified anti-GLUT4 IgG fraction (4 mg/ml) diluted in AC buffer, acyl-CoA synthetase (20–40 milliunits, Boehringer Mannheim), 200 mm CoA, 2 mm ATP, and [125I]IC-16 palmitate for 20 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of sample buffer, and the proteins were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, dried between sheets of cellophane, and then exposed to film at −80 °C with intensifying screens. GLUT4-enriched vesicles were fixed in a final concentration of 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, adsorbed to Formvar-coated nickel grids (300 mesh, Ladd Company) and processed for double labeling as outlined in Martinet al. (27Martin S. Tellum J. Livingstone C. Slot J.W. Gould G.W. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Grids were incubated with 10 μl of primary antibody diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline as follows: anti-GLUT-4 IgG (4 μg/ml) and anti-vp165 IgG (5 μg/ml). After incubation with each primary antibody, grids were labeled with either 5 or 15 nm gold particles conjugated to the secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit). Grids were stained with 1% uranyl acetate, dried, and viewed using a transmission electron microscope (JOEL 100CX, 80 kV short beam). GLUT4-enriched vesicles were prepared by a sucrose velocity gradient sedimentation technique previously reported (22Kandror K.V. Coderre L. Pushkin A.V. Pilch P.F. Biochem. J. 1995; 30: 383-390Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and all fractions taken from the gradient were analyzed by Western blot with specific antibodies for the presence of GLUT4 protein. Fractions 8 to 18 were pooled, and recovery of GLUT4 protein was consistently 5% of the low density microsomal fraction. Analysis of these pooled fractions by double label immuno-electron microscopy revealed the presence of intact rounded, vesicular-like structures (50–80 nm) that intensely labeled with anti-GLUT4 as well as antibodies against vp165, an aminopeptidase that exhibits nearly 100% overlap with GLUT4 in cellular distribution (28Keller S.R.

Importantly, virtually all vesicles that were labeled by anti-GLUT4 also labeled with anti-vp165, indicating colocalization of GLUT4 and vp165 in the same vesicles as previously proposed (8Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 34: E1-E14Crossref Google Scholar, 9Heller-Harrison R.A. Morin M. Guilherme A. Czech M.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 11681-11684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data also confirm the utility of gradient sedimentation as a means for partially purifying GLUT4-enriched vesicles from fat cell membranes. To determine whether additional protein components are specific to these vesicles, equal amounts of GLUT4-enriched vesicles were125I-labeled and immunoadsorbed with an antibody raised against the COOH terminus of GLUT4 or an equal amount of nonimmune IgG. Fig. 2 depicts the SDS-PAGE profile of the immunoadsorbed vesicles derived from adipocytes treated for 10 min with or without insulin. Proteins (designated a–i in Fig. 2) that are present in vesicles immunoadsorbed with anti-GLUT4 but are absent or present at lower levels in vesicles immunoadsorbed with nonimmune IgG migrate at the molecular masses of 165, 120, 110, 92, 75, 67, 48, 36, and 35 kDa. Specific decreases in these same protein bands are observed in response to insulin treatment of intact cells prior to fractionation (Fig. 2, lane 1 versus lane 3). The identification of the same proteins by the two different approaches (anti-GLUT4 versus anti-nonimmune IgG adsorption and controlversus insulin treatment) provides high confidence that these proteins actually colocalize to GLUT4-containing vesicles. To identify proteins designated in the profile shown in Fig. 2, the immunoadsorption procedure was scaled up to obtain proteins in sufficient quantities for protein microsequencing. The eluted proteins were analyzed by copper and silver stain (Fig. 3), and the protein bands corresponding to p165 and p75 were excised and subjected to proteolytic cleavage followed by online LC/MS/MS sequencing by ion trap mass spectrometry. Six peptide sequences (NFAATQFEPLAAR, GSVTISLQALQDTR, KGTELLLQQER, LLGMSFMNR, LPTAIIPQR, and GFPLVTVQR) from the p165 band identified this protein as the insulin-regulated aminopeptidase, vp165 (28Keller S.R.

Analysis of two internal peptide sequences isolated from the p75 band (GYLKDPAR and NAGLKPFEQVK) exhibited 100% identity with the amino acid sequence of long chain acyl-Coenzyme A synthetase-1 (EC 6.2.1.3) isolated from rat liver. Long chain acyl-CoA synthetase-1 has a molecular mass of 78 kDa, which corresponds to the molecular mass of the specifically immunoadsorbed protein band labeled e in Fig. 3. It is the best characterized of the four known mammalian isoforms of ligases that activate free fatty acids, is abundant in liver, adipose tissue, and heart, and shows broad fatty acid specificity (30Suzuki H. Kawarabayasi Y. Kondo J. Abe T. Nishikawa K. Kimura S. Hashimoto T. Yamamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8681-8685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, fatty acid esterification to the activated CoA form occurs in distinct intracellular compartments such as microsomes, outer mitochondrial membranes, and peroxisomal membranes (31Mangaroo D. Trigatti B.L. Gerber G.E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Analysis of freshly prepared GLUT4-enriched vesicles from adipocytes for acyl-CoA synthetase activity using the exogenous substrate palmitic acid revealed significant activity (672 ± 90 pmol/min/mg) that was inhibited by Triacsin-C, a known competitive inhibitor of acyl-CoA synthetase (Fig. 4 b). Insulin treatment of intact fat cells significantly reduced the total acyl-CoA synthetase activity for GLUT4-enriched vesicles recovered from the velocity gradient fractions when both palmitic (16:0) and oleic (18:1) acids were used as substrates. No corresponding increase in acyl-CoA synthetase activity in other membrane or cytosolic fractions could be detected in response to insulin (not illustrated), but such increases may be too small to detect. Importantly, the decrease in activity observed in GLUT4-containing vesicles was similar to that observed for GLUT4 and vp165 protein (Fig. 4 a), suggesting that the amount of acyl-CoA synthetase is decreased in GLUT4-enriched vesicle preparations in response to insulin. These data are consistent with the conclusion that acyl-CoA synthetase is a component of the insulin-sensitive membrane compartment. To confirm that acyl-CoA synthetase is present in GLUT4-enriched vesicles, we used a sensitive assay that couples the fatty acyl esterification reaction to the acylation of an artificial protein substrate, in this case, rat IgG. In this reaction acyl-CoA synthetase catalyzes the esterification of the 125I-labeled palmitic acid analog, [125I]IC-16, to palmitoyl-CoA, providing a labeled acyl group that can be transferred to proteins even in the absence of any specific palmitoyl-transferase. Results from a control reaction of purified rat IgG with CoA, ATP, [125I]IC-16, and acyl-CoA synthetase shows the incorporation of the labeled fatty acyl group into the heavy chain of IgG (Fig. 5 a). As indicated in the results from this experiment, the reaction is dose-dependent for both active acyl-CoA synthetase and substrate. To assess the acyl-CoA synthetase activity associated with purified GLUT4-containing vesicles, equal amounts of GLUT4-enriched membranes prepared by gradient centrifugation from nontreated and insulin-treated adipocytes were immunoabsorbed with anti-GLUT4 IgG. The immobilized vesicles were the only source of synthetase in these reactions. As shown in Fig. 5 b, the anti-GLUT4-IgG, is intensely labeled during the reaction of immunoadsorbed GLUT4-enriched vesicles with [125I]IC-16 (Fig. 5 b, first lane). Importantly, the immunoadsorbed GLUT4-containing vesicles derived from insulin-treated fat cells exhibited decreased activity compared with controls (Fig. 5 b, first and third lanes) as shown by the marked reduction in labeling of the IgG band. Furthermore this band is not present following heat inactivation of the vesicles or in the absence of GLUT4-containing vesicles (Fig. 5 b, last two lanes). These data provide compelling evidence for an association of acyl-CoA synthetase-1 with immunopurified GLUT4-containing vesicles prepared from control and insulin-treated rat adipocytes. The fatty acyl-CoA species that are the products of acyl-CoA synthetase activity serve as substrates for β-oxidation and phospholipid biosynthesis. A role in promoting budding and fusion of transport vesicles was also proposed from studies that highlighted fatty acyl-CoA as a cofactor to the Golgi-associated protein, NSF, a factor that is required for transport between cisternae of the Golgi stack in a cell-free system (18Glick B.S. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1987; 326: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 19Pfanner N. Orci L. Glick B.S. Amherdt M. Arden S.R. Malhotra V. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1989; 59: 95-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). An inhibitor of long chain acyl-CoA synthetase, Triacsin-C, demonstrated that the fatty acid has to be activated by CoA to stimulate membrane transport (20Osterman J. Orci L. Tani K. Amherdt M. Ravazzola M. Elazar Z. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 1015-1025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy and biochemical studies have also indicated that fatty acyl-CoA is required for budding of coated transport vesicles from Golgi cisternae and that budding is inhibited by a nonhydrolyzable analog of palmitoyl-CoA (19Pfanner N. Orci L. Glick B.S. Amherdt M. Arden S.R. Malhotra V. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1989; 59: 95-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Unfortunately the mechanism has been elusive, and neither the targets of palmitoyl-CoA nor the exact function of palmitoyl-CoA in these in vitro reactions are known. Previous studies designed to identify molecular elements within the intracellular GLUT4-enriched membranes have yielded the identities of a number of proteins known to be involved in membrane trafficking of other cellular systems such as synaptic vesicle exocytosis and transport between Golgi membranes. This is also the case for the present finding that long chain acyl-CoA synthetase is a component of insulin-sensitive GLUT4-containing vesicles (Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5), because long chain fatty acyl-CoA is required for Golgi membrane fusion and fission events in vitro (20Osterman J. Orci L. Tani K. Amherdt M. Ravazzola M. Elazar Z. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 1015-1025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems likely that the basic elements of GLUT4 recycling to the plasma membrane involve mechanisms common to other better characterized membrane trafficking systems. An important goal of future studies is to determine the molecular basis of fatty acyl-CoA function in GLUT4 recycling and other membrane trafficking pathways. We thank R. Robinson, D. Kirby, and E.

Although structurally similar, the two receptors appear to invoke different signal transduction pathways, as indicated by the distinctive phenotypes associated with inactivation of each receptor gene (8Shalaby F.

Rossant J. Yamaguchi T.P. Gertsenstein M. Wu X. Breitman M.L. Schuh A.C. Nature. 1995; 376: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (3352) Google Scholar). Mice lacking Flt-1 also died in utero at day 8.5. However, although endothelial cells were present, they failed to organize into normal vascular channels (9Fong G.-H. Rossant J. Gertsenstein M. Breitman M.L. Nature. 1995; 376: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (2213) Google Scholar). Most of the work in the field has focused on the Flk-1/KDR receptor due to its strong VEGF-induced tyrosine autophosphorylation and its role in mitogenesis (10Terman B.I. Dougher-Vermazen M.

Although Flt-1 does exhibit VEGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation, the signal is very weak compared with that seen with Flk-1/KDR (12Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.

Oncogene. 1995; 10: 135-147PubMed Google Scholar), and Flt-1 has not been shown to be directly involved in endothelial cell mitogenesis. However, Flt-1 also binds a VEGF-like molecule placenta growth factor (PlGF), which does not bind to Flk-1/KDR (15Maglione D. Guerriero V. Viglietto G. Delli-Bovi P. Persico M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad.

However, in monocytes that express Flt-1, but not Flk-1/KDR, stimulation by either VEGF or PlGF leads to the production of tissue factor and chemotaxis (18Barleon B. Sozzani S. Zhou D. Weich H.

Consistent with the ability of VEGF but not PlGF to bind to Flk-1/KDR, it has been shown that the PlGF/VEGF heterodimers can bind Flk-1/KDR (17Cao Y. Chen H. Zhou L. Chiang M.-K. Anand-Apte B.

In vivo mouse corneal neovascularization assays revealed that the PlGF/VEGF heterodimers could induce new vessel growth with similar vessel lengths as VEGF homodimers, although vessel density was reduced (21Cao Y.

Further analysis identified several charged residues that appeared to be associated with receptor binding (13Keyt B.A. Nguyen H.V. Berleau L.T. Duarte C.M. Park J. Chen H. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5638-5646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Residues Arg82, Lys84, and His86were found to be critical for binding to Flk-1/KDR, while negatively charged amino acids Asp63, Glu64 and Glu67, were associated with Flt-1 binding (13Keyt B.A. Nguyen H.V. Berleau L.T. Duarte C.M. Park J. Chen H. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5638-5646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Recently, we and others demonstrated that of the seven Ig-like domains within the extracellular domain (ECD) of Flt-1, the second Ig-like domain is critical for ligand binding (23Davis-Smyth T. Chen H. Park J. Presta L.G. Ferrara N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4919-4927Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 24Cunningham S.A. Stephen C.C. Arrate M.P. Ayer K.G. Brock T.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 1997; 272: 10382-10388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In the context of a recombinant chimeric receptor, the second domain of Flt-1 was sufficient for either VEGF or PlGF to bind and initiate a signal transduction cascade (23Davis-Smyth T. Chen H. Park J. Presta L.G. Ferrara N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4919-4927Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that a soluble receptor immunoadhesin (26Capon D.J. Chamow S.M. Mordenti J. Marsters S.A. Gregory T. Mitsuya H. Byrn R.A. Lucas C. Wurm F.M. Groopman J.E. Broder S. Smith D.H. Nature. 1989; 337: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) possessing only the first three ECD domains was sufficient to bind VEGF with the same affinity as the full-length ECD (23Davis-Smyth T. Chen H. Park J. Presta L.G. Ferrara N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4919-4927Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In addition, PlGF can compete with VEGF for binding to constructs possessing the first three domains of Flt-1, further supporting the concept that PlGF and VEGF share similar contact sites on the receptor (23Davis-Smyth T. Chen H. Park J. Presta L.G. Ferrara N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4919-4927Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 24Cunningham S.A. Stephen C.C. Arrate M.P. Ayer K.G. Brock T.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 1997; 272: 10382-10388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). To better understand VEGF and PlGF action, analysis of the Flt-1 ligand-binding site would be useful. In the present study, using alanine-scanning mutagenesis, we examine the role of charged residues within the first three domains of Flt-1 in ligand binding. We demonstrate that at least one charged residue within the second domain serves a critical role in maintaining proper conformation of the domain and that only two of the charged residues within the second domain appear to be directly involved in ligand interaction. Furthermore, we examine the contribution of both the second and third domains of Flt-1 in distinguishing VEGF from PlGF binding. Mutants were created via oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis performed according to the method of Kunkel (27Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4897) Google Scholar). A plasmid vector, pHEBO23 (28Su W. Middleton T. Sudgen B. Echols H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10870-10874Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), containing cDNA encoding the signal peptide and first three Ig-like domains of Flt-1 fused to the human heavy chain IgGγ1 (23Davis-Smyth T. Chen H. Park J. Presta L.G. Ferrara N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4919-4927Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) was used for mutagenesis and expression. Variants were screened and verified by sequence analysis using the Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (Perkin Elmer) followed by application of the Sequencher 3.01 program (Gene Codes Corp.). Double-stranded DNA encoding each selected variant was prepared using the Qiagen DNA purification kit (catalog number 12163, QIAGEN Inc.) and used for transfection into CEN4 cells via calcium phosphate precipitation. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, conditioned medium was collected from transiently expressing cells, and the concentration of soluble receptor was determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay detecting human Fc-IgG. Radiolabeling ofEscherichia coli-derived recombinant human VEGF165, recombinant human PlGF152 purified from conditioned medium of stably expressing CEN4 cells, and purified rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Cappel) was performed using a modification of the chloramine T-catalyzed iodination reaction (29Hunter W.M. Greenwood F.C. Nature. 1962; 194: 495-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (5859) Google Scholar). A typical reaction consisted of 10 μg of VEGF, 3 μg of PlGF, or 10 μg of rabbit anti-mouse IgG in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.01% Tween 20 added to a half-volume of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, with 0.01% Tween 20, followed by the addition of 0.5 mCi of sodium iodide-125 (NEN Life Science Products). The reaction was catalyzed with 10 μg of chloramine T (Aldrich), resuspended in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and incubated at room temperature for 1 min. Following the termination of the reaction by the addition of 20 μg of sodium metabisulfate (Aldrich) dissolved in sodium phosphate buffer, the radiolabeled protein was isolated on a PD-10 Sephadex G-25 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) that was preequilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.01% Tween 20. The average specific activity of the iodinated recombinant human VEGF165 and recombinant human PlGF152 was 29.01 × 106 cpm/μg and 54.65 × 106 cpm/μg, respectively. Rabbit anti-mouse IgG labeled with a specific activity of 29.5 × 106cpm/μg. Assays were performed as described previously (23Davis-Smyth T. Chen H. Park J. Presta L.G. Ferrara N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4919-4927Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) with a few modifications. In brief, 96-well breakaway immunoabsorbent assay plates (Nunc) were coated overnight at 4 °C with 1 μg/well rabbit IgG anti-human Fc-IgG (Cappel) in 50 mm sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.6. Prior to the addition of 100 μl of binding reaction per well, the wells were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% fetal bovine serum (buffer B) at room temperature for 1 h. Binding reactions consisted of 10 ng/ml soluble receptor-IgG, either 125I-labeled recombinant human VEGF165 or 125I-labeled recombinant human PlGF152 (∼9000 cpm/100-μl reaction), and cold competitor protein where indicated. The reactions were assembled and allowed to equilibrate overnight at 4 °C prior to loading into the coated wells. Incubation in the wells proceeded either for 4 h at 25 °C or overnight at 4 °C. Following removal of the supernatant from the wells and several washes with buffer B, the amount of bound protein was determined by counting individual wells in a γ-counter. In addition, the unbound radiolabeled proteins in the supernatant was also determined. The data were analyzed and reported as percentage relative to the amount bound to wild-type Flt(1–3)IgG. For competition studies, a four-parameter nonlinear curve-fitting program (Kaleidagraph, Synergy Software) was used to determine the point of inflection. Monoclonal antibodies were generated against the Flt-1 ECD region (Hybridoma Group, Genentech, Inc.). For binding, 1 ng of a receptor-IgG variant was incubated with 2 ng of monoclonal antibody (mAb) and 125I-labeled rabbit anti-mouse IgG (∼6000 cpm/100-μl reaction) in buffer B at 4 °C overnight. The reactions were then placed in immunoabsorbent assay plates that had been treated as described above, and incubation continued to proceed either for 4 h at 25 °C or overnight at 4 °C. After the removal of unbound supernatant and several washes with buffer B, the amount of monoclonal antibody bound to receptor-IgG variant was determined by counting the amount of radiolabeled material bound to the well. The results were then normalized to that bound to the wild-type Flt(1–3)IgG. The model of human Flt-1 domain 2 (Flt-1d2) was based on the crystal structure of telokin (30Holden H.M. Ito M. Hartshorne D.J. Rayment I. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 840-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The sequence alignment of human Flt-1 domain 2, as well as human KDR domain 2, with telokin is shown in Fig. 1. Telokin was transformed into Flt-1d2 in three steps. First, all residues in the β-strands were changed to the Flt-1d2 sequence using the INSIGHT-II program (Biosym Technologies, San Diego, CA). If possible, conformations of Flt-1d2 side chains were kept similar to those of telokin; otherwise, they were based on INSIGHT-II rotamer libraries, packing, and hydrogen bond considerations. Second, loop structures connecting the β-strands were gleaned from a search of loops of similar size from the Protein Data Bank (31Bernstein F.C. Koetzle T.F. Williams G.J.B. Meyer Jr., E.F. Brice M.D. Rodgers J.R. Kennard O. Shimanouchi T. Tasumi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 112: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (8176) Google Scholar) using the loop search algorithm in the INSIGHT-II program. Finally, the relatively large segment connecting β-strands C and E (20 residues long; Phe172–Gly191) was modeled in several conformations by a combination of loop searching and manual adjustment. The Flt-1d2 models were subjected to energy minimization using the DISCOVER program (Biosym Technologies, San Diego, CA). The all atom AMBER force field (32Weiner S.J. Kollman P.A. Nguyen D.T. Case D.A. J. Comput. Chem. 1986; 7: 230-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (3595) Google Scholar) as provided in the DISCOVER program was used for all calculations, employing a 14-Å cutoff for nonbonded interactions, a linear dielectric (e = 4.0 × r), and 1–4 atom-atom interactions (i.e. atoms connected by two intervening covalently bonded atoms) scaled by a 0.5 factor. Prior to minimization, hydrogen atoms were added to the structure using INSIGHT-II, and positions of hydrogens on Ser, Thr, and Tyr side chains were checked visually for proper alignment in hydrogen bonds, if present. Energy minimization was performed in three stages. In stage one, 500 cycles of steepest descents minimization was employed with 53 nitrogen donor-oxygen acceptor atom pairs constrained to be within hydrogen bonding distance (2.90 Å; force constant of 50 kcal/Å). The latter were included to retain the β-strand nature of the immunoglobulin-like domain. In stage two, conjugate-gradient minimization was employed for 2000 iterations, and the hydrogen bond constraints were retained. In stage three, another 3000 cycles of conjugate-gradient minimization were employed with the hydrogen bond constraints released. The sequences of mature, secreted human VEGF165 and PlGF152 were aligned based upon the 10 conserved cysteine residues (Fig. 2). PlGF shares 47% sequence identity with VEGF within the first 110 residues and 63% similarity overall. Two of the negatively charged residues previously identified as being important in the interaction of VEGF with Flt-1, Asp63 and Glu64, are conserved in PlGF, whereas a histidine replaces Glu67, which has also been implicated in VEGF binding to Flt-1 (13Keyt B.A. Nguyen H.V. Berleau L.T. Duarte C.M. Park J. Chen H. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5638-5646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). It is also noteworthy that positively charged VEGF residues identified as being involved in Flk-1/KDR binding (Arg82, Lys84, and His86) are not conserved in PlGF (13Keyt B.A. Nguyen H.V. Berleau L.T.

Based on the involvement of charged residues in the binding site on VEGF, we opted to examine the influence of charged residues within the first three domains of Flt-1 on ligand binding. Thirty-five mutants of the Flt(1–3)IgG soluble receptor were generated where 1–5 neighboring charged amino acids were replaced with alanine(s) (Table I). This analysis focused on both acidic and basic amino acids (Asp, Glu, Lys, Arg, and His). Each of the resulting mutant receptors was then tested for its ability to bind either 125I-VEGF or 125I-PlGF relative to wild-type Flt(1–3)IgG. The overall ligand binding profiles of the variant receptors were very similar (Table I).

Two of these antibodies were mapped to domain 1 (mAbs 3 and 12), and the remaining three antibodies were mapped to domain 2 (mAbs 1, 6, and 8) using Flt-1 domain deletion mutants and Flt-1/KDR domain swap chimeras described previously (23Davis-Smyth T. Chen H. Park J. Presta L.G. Ferrara N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4919-4927Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Only mAb 6 is able to fully neutralize VEGF binding in soluble receptor-binding assays (Fig. 3). The entire set of antibodies bound poorly to the alanine scan variant AS170, implying that this receptor was incorrectly folded and thus unable to bind either ligand (Table I). Alanine scan variants AS180 and AS187 may also have structural problems as evidenced by at least one of the individual alanine mutants comprising these multiple mutants binding poorly to the panel of antibodies (see below). Since several of the multiple alanine mutations resulted in an impaired conformation, we further analyzed domain 2 by separating some of the clusters of mutations and generating variants of Flt(1–3)IgG, which had single residue charge-to-alanine changes. The variants were tested for their ability to bind both VEGF and PlGF. The single residue mutations can be separated into three classes: those that had minimal or no effect on binding (D175A, K182A, R183A, R189A, K190A, and K200A), those that affected binding of both VEGF and PlGF, and those that affect binding of PlGF but not VEGF (Table I). Although several individual charge-to-alanine mutants did exhibit decreases in the amount of both VEGF and PlGF bound (R159A, K170A, D187A, and E208A), only D187A showed a significant reduction in bound ligand (Table I). D187A also bound poorly to the panel of antibodies and hence is probably conformationally impaired. In the model of Flt-1 domain 2, the Asp187 side chain accepts hydrogen bonds from the Arg189 and Lys190 backbone nitrogens, thereby stabilizing a single turn of α-helix (Asp187–Gly191) (Fig. 4). Altering Asp187 to alanine might disrupt this single turn of α-helix, but since neither Arg189 nor Lys190 affected binding when altered to alanine, this suggests that there might be an effect on other, noncharged amino acids adjacent to it that disrupt binding; alternatively, this loop could be interacting at the domain 1/domain 2 interface. To determine whether the reduced binding of the D187A mutation could be attributed to the lack of a negative charge or the difference in size of the residue, Asp187 was changed to either glutamic acid (D187E), which retains the negative charge on the side chain, or to asparagine (D187N), which eliminates the charge but maintains the general size and polarity of the residue. Although both alterations resulted in an increase in ligand binding over the alanine mutation (D187A), neither substitution fully restored the binding observed with the wild-type Flt(1–3)IgG (Table I). Hence, both the negative charge and size of the side chain appear to be important at residue 187 for the receptor to maintain its ability to bind either ligand. Upon analysis with the set of monoclonal antibodies, we observed a significant decrease in binding by the antibodies that recognize domain 2 and a more modest reduction in binding by antibodies recognizing domain 1 (Table I). Interestingly, all three mutants affected antibody binding to domain 1 equivalently, whereas they differed in their effect on antibodies that map to domain 2. These results suggest that residue 187 is critical for maintaining the structure of domain 2 and/or the integrity of the domain 1/domain 2 interface. Of the other single charge-to-alanine mutations that affected binding of VEGF and PlGF, K170A bound poorly only to the antibodies mapped to domain 2, and R159A and E208A showed reduced binding only to mAb 8 and could thus be part of the mAb 8 epitope on domain 2 (Table I). In the model, the Lys170 side chain forms a salt bridge with the Glu208 side chain. Disruption of the salt bridge might effect a conformational change, but the difference in the K170A and E208A antibody-binding patterns suggests that disruption of the salt bridge, as predicted in the model, does not result in an impaired conformation. Alternatively, the aliphatic segment of the Lys170 side chain could be required for maintenance of the conformation, which would be removed by replacement with an alanine. Several single charge-to-alanine mutants affected binding of PlGF but not VEG"

Glucagon and glucocorticoids stimulate PEPCK gene transcription, whereas insulin has a dominant inhibitory effect. We have shown that inhibitors of 1-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) block this action of insulin. In contrast, three distinct agents, all of which prevent activation of p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, have no effect on the regulation of PEPCK transcription by insulin. However, a subsequent report has suggested that this pathway is involved in the inhibition of cAMP-induced PEPCK gene transcription by insulin. To address these conflicting data, we re-examined the Ras MAP kinase pathway, not only with respect to regulation of PEPCK gene transcription, but also for regulation of PI 3-kinase and p42/p44 MAP kinase. Overexpression of constitutively active Ras (V61) (or Raf-1 (RafCAAX)) partially represses PEPCK transcription in hepatoma cells. However, an inhibitor of MAP kinase kinase blocks this action of RafCAAX but has no effect on regulation of PEPCK gene transcription by insulin. Second, the action of a dominant negative Ras (N17Ras) on PEPCK gene transcription correlates more closely with the inhibition of PI 3-kinase than with the inhibition of p42/p44 MAP kinase. Third, insulin cannot activate p42/p44 MAP kinase in the presence of cAMP even though cAMP-induced PEPCK gene transcription is inhibited by insulin. This data confirms that the Ras MAP kinase pathway is not required for the regulation of PEPCK gene transcription by insulin and demonstrates the importance of employing multiple techniques when investigating the function of signaling pathways.

Biol. 1994; 69: 203-281PubMed Google Scholar) have been well characterized, the molecular mechanisms that mediate the repression of transcription by insulin are less well defined. An insulin response sequence (IRS) positioned between −413 and −407 mediates the repression of PEPCK gene transcription by insulin in stably transfected cell lines (10Forest C.D. O'Brien R.M. Lucas P.C. Magnuson M.A. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1302-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and in a heterologous context (11O'Brien R.M. Noisin E.L. Suwanichkul A. Yamasaki T. Lucas P.L. Wang J.-C. Powell D.R. Granner D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1747-1758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This sequence mediates both an insulin and a phorbol ester response within the PEPCK promoter (12O'Brien R.M. Bonovich M.T. Forest C.D. Granner D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6580-6584Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A second IRS (that equally contributes to the total insulin response) is located more proximal to the transcription start site of the promoter, although its precise location has not yet been determined (10Forest C.D. O'Brien R.M. Lucas P.C. Magnuson M.A. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1302-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Similarly, although the signaling mechanisms employed to induce PEPCK gene transcription by glucocorticoids, retinoic acid, and glucagon are relatively well characterized, the signaling pathways leading to repression of this gene are only now beginning to be elucidated (6Sutherland C.

Interestingly, it is becoming clear that insulin uses distinct signaling pathways to regulate the activity of different gene promoters (1O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Physiol.

For example, the regulation of expression of certain immediate early genes requires activation of the Ras MAP kinase pathway (1O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1109-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 17Karin M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), whereas the regulation of PEPCK gene expression in hepatoma cells by insulin is sensitive to inhibitors of PI 3-kinase but not to either rapamycin (an inhibitor of p70S6 kinase activation) or inhibitors of the Ras MAP kinase pathway (13Sutherland C. O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15501-15506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 14Gabbay R.A. Sutherland C. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. O'Brien R.M.

However, the induction of hexokinase II gene expression in myotubes by insulin is blocked by both PI 3-kinase inhibitors and rapamycin but not inhibitors of the Ras MAP kinase pathway (16Osawa H.

Recently, in contrast to the previous work, another group described a loss of insulin repression of PEPCK gene transcription in the presence of a dominant negative Ras mutant (N17Ras) (18Nakajima T. Fukamizu A. Takahashi J. Gage F.H. Fisher T. Blenis J. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1996; 86: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The existence of an insulin signaling pathway to the PEPCK gene that requires activation of the Ras MAP kinase pathway and the subsequent translocation of the p90 ribosomal S6 protein kinase (p90RSK) to the nucleus was proposed. p90RSK is postulated to interact with the co-activator molecule CREB binding protein (CBP/p300), thereby blocking the ability of cAMP to regulate gene transcription through CBP/p300. The CBP/p300 protein has been implicated in the binding of many proteins and could have a role in the regulation of transcription of multiple genes by distinct effectors (for review see Refs.19Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar, 20Janknecht R. Hunter T. Curr.

Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 230-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). As this scenario is contrary to our previous work, which dissociated the Ras MAP kinase pathway from regulation of PEPCK gene transcription by insulin (13Sutherland C. O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15501-15506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 14Gabbay R.A. Sutherland C. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Flier J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1890-1897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), we decided to re-examine the role of this pathway in the regulation of PEPCK gene transcription to attempt to determine the basis for this discrepancy. We determined that the inhibitor of the Ras MAP kinase pathway employed by Nakajima et al. (18Nakajima T. Fukamizu A. Takahashi J. Gage F.H. Fisher T. Blenis J. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1996; 86: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) can affect the activity of the PI 3-kinase pathway as well as the MAP kinase pathway if it is expressed at high enough levels. This action of the inhibitor could explain the apparently discordant results. In addition, we present further evidence that eliminates the Ras MAP kinase pathway as the mediator of insulin repression of PEPCK gene transcription, even though the activation of this pathway can partially repress PEPCK gene transcription. The H4IIE rat hepatoma-derived stable transfectant, HL1C, contains the PEPCK promoter sequence from −2100 to +69 ligated to the CAT reporter gene (10Forest C.D. O'Brien R.M. Lucas P.C. Magnuson M.A. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1302-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). HL1C cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 2.5% (v/v) fetal calf serum and 2.5% newborn calf serum. Hormone and inhibitor treatments were carried out in serum-free medium for the times and at the concentrations indicated in the figure legends. Cells were harvested by tryptic digestion and then sonicated in 400 μl of 250 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.8) before CAT activity was determined (10Forest C.D. O'Brien R.M. Lucas P.C. Magnuson M.A. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1302-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). HL1C cells were serum-starved overnight and treated with hormone/inhibitor for the times and at the concentrations indicated in the figure legends. Total cellular RNA (∼100 μg/106 cells) was isolated using Tri-Reagent (Molecular Research Center Inc.) according to the supplier's instructions. A primer extension assay was used to analyze PEPCK and β-actin mRNA accumulation as described previously (10Forest C.D. O'Brien R.M. Lucas P.C. Magnuson M.A. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1302-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and autoradiographs were quantified by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics). HL1C cells (2–4 × 106) were incubated in serum-free medium with hormones and inhibitors at the concentrations and for the times indicated in the figure legends. Cells were then scraped into 0.5 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaF, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmbenzamidine, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 13000 × g for 5 min, and the protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford using bovine serum albumin as an internal standard. After incubation with or without insulin for 15 min, cells were lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (above) and cleared by centrifugation, and p42/p44 MAP kinase was immunoprecipitated using anti-extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2 antibodies (Santa Cruz). The precipitated kinase was assayed using myelin basic protein as a substrate (16Osawa H. Sutherland C. Robey R.B. Printz R.L. Granner D.K. J. Biol.

After incubation with or without insulin for 15 min, cells were lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (as above) and cleared by centrifugation, and activated PI 3-kinase was immunoprecipitated using an anti-IRS-1 antibody (Santa Cruz). The precipitated kinase was assayed using phosphatidylinositol as substrate in the presence of phosphatidyl serine, MgCl2 (10 mm) and (γ-32P)ATP (50 μm, 10 μCi) for 15 min at 37 °C. The products were separated by TLC using an ammonia running system (methanol:chloroform:ammonia:water 20:14:3:5), and the radiolabeled PI 3-phosphate was visualized by autoradiography and/or quantified by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The preparation of the PEPCK promoter-CAT reporter construct (pPL32) has been described previously (22Petersen D.D. Magnuson M.A. Granner D.K. Mol. Cell.

Plaque-forming unit calculations were determined by measuring A 260 (A 260 = 1 represents 1011 plaque-forming units/ml). Various combinations (as indicated in the figure legends) of plasmids encoding PEPCK promoter-CAT reporter (pPL32 (22Petersen D.D. Magnuson M.A. Granner D.K. Mol. Cell.

Cells were incubated for 20 h with hormones as indicated in the figure legends and then harvested by tryptic digestion and sonicated in 200 μl of 250 mmTris/HCl (pH 7.8) before CAT activity was determined (10Forest C.D. O'Brien R.M. Lucas P.C. Magnuson M.A. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1302-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the Ras MAP kinase pathway is required for insulin repression of cAMP-induced PEPCK gene transcription (18Nakajima T. Fukamizu A. Takahashi J. Gage F.H. Fisher T. Blenis J. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1996; 86: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to a previous study where expression of a dominant negative mutant of Ras (N17Ras), using an adenovirus expression system (adN17Ras), had no effect on the regulation of PEPCK gene transcription by insulin (14Gabbay R.A. Sutherland C. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Flier J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1890-1897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This particular Ras mutant had no effect on PEPCK gene transcription when expressed at a level sufficient to completely inhibit the activation of p42/p44 MAP kinase by insulin (14Gabbay R.A. Sutherland C. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Flier J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1890-1897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). To resolve this disparity, we re-examined the effect of this mutant Ras on the regulation of PEPCK-CAT fusion gene expression in a stably transfected hepatoma cell line (HL1C) as well as on the regulation of endogenous PEPCK gene transcription (Fig. 1). There is no effect of adN17Ras on the hormone responsiveness of the PEPCK promoter when cells are treated with an amount sufficient to completely inhibit p42/p44 MAP kinase activation (Fig. 1, N17Ras-5 μl and Fig. 2). However, at much higher levels of adN17Ras treatment, the ability of insulin to repress PEPCK gene transcription is indeed partially lost (Fig. 1, N17Ras-20 μl). The extremely high efficiency of DNA transfer is a major advantage of using an adenovirus transfection system. The efficiency of DNA transfer in H4IIE cells increases from <0.1% with conventional transfection techniques to 70–100% with adenovirus treatment. 2C. Sutherland and D. K. Granner, unpublished observations. The efficient transfer provided by the latter allows for the measurement of multiple endogenous parameters in each experiment. Thus we were able to determine the activities of p42/p44 MAP kinase and PI 3-kinase (Fig. 2) in parallel with the measurement of PEPCK gene expression (Figs. 1 and2). The level of adN17Ras treatment required for inhibition of insulin action on PEPCK gene transcription is much higher than that required for complete inhibition of p42/p44 MAP kinase induction (Fig. 2) but does produce partial inhibition of PI 3-kinase activity (Fig. 2). In fact, the effect of N17Ras expression on PEPCK gene transcription correlates more closely with its effect on PI 3-kinase activity rather than with its effect on p42/p44 MAP kinase activity (Fig. 2). Thus the effect of N17Ras on PEPCK transcription reported elsewhere (18Nakajima T. Fukamizu A. Takahashi J. Gage F.H. Fisher T. Blenis J. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1996; 86: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) may be due to inhibition of PI 3-kinase rather than the MAP kinase pathway (Fig. 2).Figure 2The effect of N17Ras on the regulation of PEPCK gene transcription by insulin correlates with inhibition of PI 3-kinase, not p42/p44MAP kinase. HL1C cells were treated with the indicated amount of either LacZ or N17Ras-expressing adenovirus preparations (1011 plaque-forming units (pfu)/ml). After 24 h, the medium was replaced with serum-free DMEM, and the cells were incubated for a further 20 h before the addition of fresh serum-free DMEM plus or minus 1 nm insulin. After a 15-min incubation at 37 °C, the cells were lysed, and MAP kinase or PI 3-kinase activity was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A comparison of MAP kinase and PI 3-kinase activities induced by insulin treatment after treatment with the indicated amounts of LacZ or N17Ras adenovirus is shown. In addition, the results from Fig. 1 A are included in order to demonstrate the correlation between inhibition of PI 3-kinase and loss of PEPCK gene repression. Results are presented as a percentage of the maximal effect of insulin on each parameter. The experiments measuring MAP kinase and PI 3-kinase are the average ± range of two experiments performed in duplicate; those measuring PEPCK repression are the average ± S.E. of four experiments performed in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Interestingly, in most cell types studied, activation of p42/p44 MAP kinase is antagonized by agents that increase intracellular cAMP (25Cook S.

One such study demonstrated that elevated cAMP blocks hepatocyte growth factor-induced MAP kinase activity in isolated rat hepatocytes (30Gines P. Li X. Brown S.E.S. Nakamura T. Guzelian P.S. Heasley L.E. Schrier R.W. Nemenoff R.A. Hepatology. 1996; 23: 1167-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, it was important to determine whether this kinase could be activated by insulin under the hormonal conditions used to examine the regulation of PEPCK gene transcription. Indeed, in H4IIE cells, p42/p44 MAP kinase is not activated by insulin in the presence of 8CPT-cAMP (Fig. 3). The repression of PEPCK gene transcription by insulin is dominant over the induction of transcription by cAMP (1O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1109-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). This is strong evidence that activation of the p42/p44 MAP kinase pathway cannot mediate the repression of cAMP-induced PEPCK gene transcription by insulin. The results presented above (and previously (13Sutherland C. O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15501-15506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 14Gabbay R.A. Sutherland C. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Flier J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1890-1897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar)) suggest that PI 3-kinase but not p42/p44 MAP kinase is required for the repression of the PEPCK promoter by insulin. However this does not preclude the possibility that activation of the Ras MAP kinase pathway is sufficient for repression of PEPCK gene transcription. To address this possibility, a plasmid encoding oncogenic Ras (V61Ras, kindly donated by Dr. M. Montminy) and a PEPCK promoter-CAT reporter fusion gene construct (pPL32, containing −468 to +69, relative to the transcription start site) were coexpressed in H4IIE cells. V61Ras expression partially reduces the induction of this PEPCK-CAT fusion gene by glucocorticoids or cAMP (PKA catalytic subunit, Fig. 4 A). In addition, the expression of an active mutant of c-Raf (RafCAAX), a protein kinase that lies downstream of Ras on the p42/p44 MAP kinase activation pathway, also partly represses PEPCK gene transcription (Fig. 4 B). Thus, strong activation of the Ras-Raf MAP kinase pathway does appear to repress PEPCK gene transcription. However, an inhibitor of MEK, the kinase that links Raf to p42/p44 MAP kinase (Fig. 5), blocks the action of RafCAAX on PEPCK gene transcription without affecting the action of insulin on this gene (Fig. 4 C). Again, this is consistent with the idea that the Ras-Raf-MAP kinase pathway is not required for the regulation of PEPCK gene transcription by insulin.Figure 5Repression of PEPCK gene transcription by insulin is PI 3-kinase-dependent, Ras-Raf-independent, but activation of the Ras-Raf pathway can partially repress PEPCK transcription. PDK/PKB/PKC/?, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase/protein kinase B/protein kinase C/unknown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The delineation of signal transduction pathways routinely involves the use of dominant negative molecules, selective inhibitors of enzymes and expression of active mutants. Each method has inherent drawbacks. The specificity of inhibitors can be questioned. Dominant negative forms of signaling molecules are usually inactive mutants of a protein that are presumed to sequester an interacting molecule (upstream or downstream in the pathway), thus blocking the normal function of the endogenous signaling protein. This mode of action cannot preclude the possibility that an effect of a dominant negative protein predicts a role for the binding protein rather than the molecule itself. The overexpression of a constitutively active form of a signaling molecule can produce a loss of substrate specificity. In addition, many signaling pathways are activated transiently by a given agent and in a more sustained fashion by a second agent (e.g. epidermal growth factor and nerve growth factor activation of p42/p44 MAP kinase in PC12 cells (31Traverse S. Gomez N. Paterson H. Marshall C. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar)). Thus, overexpression of a constitutively active mutant produces effects similar to sustained activation, since the mutant cannot be down-regulated. This may result in a phenotype that is very different from that achieved by the transient activation of the same pathway that is typical of many physiological effectors. We previously employed a combined approach, including the use of a dominant negative form of Ras (N17Ras), Ras farnesyltransferase inhibitors, and an inhibitor of MEK to block activation of p42/p44 MAP kinase in H4IIE cells by insulin. All three approaches prevented p42/p44 MAP kinase activation but had no effect on the regulation of PEPCK gene transcription by insulin (14Gabbay R.A. Sutherland C. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Flier J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1890-1897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We now extend these studies by presenting additional evidence that the Ras MAP kinase pathway cannot mediate the repression of PEPCK expression by insulin. First, high level expression of a dominant negative Ras molecule inhibits insulin activation of PI 3-kinase as well as insulin activation of the Ras MAP kinase pathway. Thus the reported effects of this Ras mutant on the regulation of PEPCK gene transcription by insulin could well be due to effects on PI 3-kinase, an enzyme known to be involved in the repression of PEPCK gene transcription by insulin (13Sutherland C. O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15501-15506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) rather than the p42/p44 MAP kinase cascade. It is posssible that Ras lies upstream of PI 3-kinase in an insulin signaling cascade that leads to the PEPCK promoter; however, this seems unlikely for two reasons. Ras-dependent insulin activation of p42/p44 MAP kinase is much more sensitive to N17Ras expression than is the inhibition of PI 3-kinase (Fig. 4 A). Also, inhibitors of Ras farnesyltransferase that prevent the proper localization of Ras in the cell have no effect on the ability of insulin to regulate PEPCK gene transcription (14Gabbay R.A. Sutherland C. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Flier J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1890-1897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Ras can interact with PI 3-kinase in vitro (32Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Gout I. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. Nature. 1994; 370: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar, 33Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2442-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), so the inhibitory action of N17Ras could be due to a direct interaction with PI 3-kinase in vivo. Whatever the mechanism, it appears that the inhibition of PI 3-kinase and not the inhibition of the Ras MAP kinase pathway, correlates best with the loss of insulin repression of PEPCK gene transcription in H4IIE cells seen with N17Ras expression (Fig. 2). Second, cAMP prevents activation of p42/p44 MAP kinase by hepatocyte growth factor in isolated hepatocytes and partially antagonizes epidermal growth factor-induced p42/p44 MAP kinase activity (30Gines P. Li X. Brown S.E.S. Nakamura T. Guzelian P.S. Heasley L.E. Schrier R.W. Nemenoff R.A. Hepatology. 1996; 23: 1167-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In many cell types, cAMP activates the small GTPase Rap1, and this may underlie the inhibitory action of cAMP on Ras function (34Altschuler D.L. Peterson S.N. Ostrowski M.C. Lepetina E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10373-10376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In addition, cAMP activation of PKA leads to the phosphorylation of Raf (26Wu J. Dent P. Jelinek T. Wolfman A. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1993; 262: 1065-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). In vitro phosphorylation of Raf on Ser-621 by PKA inhibits Raf activity (35Mischak H. Seitz T. Janosch P. Eulitz M. Steen H. Schellerer M. Philipp A. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5409-5418Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Either or both of these mechanisms could explain how cAMP blocks p42/p44 MAP kinase induction by insulin. We show here that the induction of p42/p44 MAP kinase by insulin in H4IIE cells is completely blocked by 8CPT-cAMP. Since the induction of PEPCK gene transcription by 8CPT-cAMP is completely prevented by insulin, there seems to be no association between this process and the effect of insulin on p42/p44 MAP kinase. Third, although expression of an active Raf mutant can partially mimic the action of insulin on PEPCK gene transcription, its effects are blocked by PD98059 (an inhibitor of MEK activation (36Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2595) Google Scholar)), whereas insulin action on PEPCK expression is unaffected by this agent. Thus, insulin does not invoke a Raf MAP kinase pathway to regulate the transcription of PEPCK. These data demonstrate the importance of employing as many distinct techniques as possible to address the role of a given signaling molecule (pathway) in specific cellular processes. Although insulin uses a PI 3-kinase-dependent, Ras MAP kinase-independent mechanism to repress PEPCK gene transcription, activation of the Ras-Raf MAP kinase pathway is sufficient to partially repress PEPCK gene transcription, and it is possible that this cascade is used by other agents to repress PEPCK expression (Fig. 5). This pathway could converge with the insulin pathway at some point below p42/p44 MAP kinase. It is of interest that other workers have found that the repression of cAMP-induced PEPCK transcription by insulin is blocked by N17Ras overexpression (18Nakajima T. Fukamizu A. Takahashi J. Gage F.H. Fisher T. Blenis J. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1996; 86: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). We have shown that N17Ras overexpression can partially block activation of PI 3-kinase by insulin in H4IIE cells. However, since N17Ras expression levels were not examined in either report, and Nakajima et al. (18Nakajima T. Fukamizu A. Takahashi J. Gage F.H. Fisher T. Blenis J. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1996; 86: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) could not measure PI 3-kinase activity in their system, it is not possible to be certain that PI 3-kinase was inhibited in these experiments. Also, a much shorter PEPCK promoter construct was employed previously rather than the pPL32 construct used in this report. It is possible that the insulin signaling pathway to this short promoter construct is Ras-dependent, whereas the larger, more physiologic construct (pPL32), contains multiple redundant elements that can be regulated in a Ras-independent fashion by insulin. Consistent with this concept, we demonstrate that activation of the Ras MAP kinase pathway can partially repress pPL32, whereas we have previously reported that the PEPCK promoter contains at least two distinct IRSs (see Ref. 1O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1109-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar for review). The best described PEPCK IRS was not present in the construct employed by Nakajima et al (18Nakajima T. Fukamizu A. Takahashi J. Gage F.H. Fisher T. Blenis J. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1996; 86: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The Ras MAP kinase pathway has been implicated in the regulation of immediate early gene expression through DNA elements such as the AP-1 motif and the serum response element/ternary complex factor element. However, there are no consensus AP-1 or serum response element elements within the PEPCK promoter. It is clear that all of the genes induced by cAMP are not repressed by insulin; thus, the PEPCK promoter as well as other genes regulated in a similar fashion, must contain some inherent mechanism that dictates which signal is dominant. A novel mechanism has been proposed for regulation of gene expression by insulin involving the CBP/p300 co-activator protein (18Nakajima T. Fukamizu A. Takahashi J. Gage F.H. Fisher T. Blenis J. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1996; 86: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). CBP/p300 is a target for multiple signaling pathways and overexpression of part of this molecule, in a stably transfected H4IIE cell line, antagonizes insulin regulation of PEPCK gene transcription (18Nakajima T. Fukamizu A. Takahashi J. Gage F.H. Fisher T. Blenis J. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1996; 86: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The CBP/p300 protein receives an inhibitory signal after the activation of the Ras MAP kinase pathway that antagonizes the effect of cAMP on gene transcription. Although the Ras MAP kinase pathway is not required for the repression of the PEPCK gene by insulin, the data presented here does not preclude a role for CBP/p300 in the regulation of PEPCK gene transcription by insulin. However, if such a mechanism is employed, a distinct signaling pathway must lead to the regulation of CBP/p300. The data presented in this paper provide further evidence that the Ras MAP kinase pathway is not required for the regulation of PEPCK gene transcription by insulin. Activation of this pathway does partially repress PEPCK gene transcription, so it is possible that other agents that repress PEPCK gene transcription in an insulin-independent manner utilize this pathway. This work clearly illustrates the importance of employing multiple techniques when manipulating signaling pathways and shows the usefulness of a transfection system that allows the measurement of endogenous signaling molecules during such manipulations.

However, contrasting with other NF-κB inducers that trigger IκB-α degradation through a phosphorylation step, amino acid analogs did not change IκB-α isoform composition. Antioxidant conditions inhibited amino acid analog stimulatory action toward NF-κB. This suggests that aberrant protein conformation probably generates a pro-oxidant state that is necessary for IκB-α proteolysis by the proteasome.

These stimuli regulate the transcription of the HIV-1 provirus through the modulation of the complex eukaryotic promoter localized in the long terminal repeat (LTR). This promoter contains binding sites for many transcription factors, including NF-κB, SP1, USF, and AP1 (11Steffy K. Wong-Staal F. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 193-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Garcia J. Gaynor R. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1994; 49: 157-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the case of oxidative stress mediated by either hydrogen peroxide or tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), the transcriptional activation of HIV-1 LTR was clearly shown to depend on NF-κB (7Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3420) Google Scholar). In contrast, HIV-1 LTR activation by protein kinase inhibitors has not yet been demonstrated to require any specific transcription factor (3Brown F.L. Tahaoglu E. Graham G.J. Maio J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5245-5254Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Similarly, despite striking similarities between the kinetics of thermal activation of the LTR and the heat shock promoter (HSE), the molecular mechanism leading to the activation of HIV-1 LTR by heat shock is still not understood (9Stanley S.K. Bressler P.B. Poli G. Fauci A.S. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 1120-1126PubMed Google Scholar,10Kretz-Remy C. Arrigo A.-P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 337-344Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Heat shock, which induces the accumulation of misfolded or damaged proteins, results in the preferential expression of heat shock or stress proteins (hsp), which contribute in helping the cell to recover from thermal damage (13Lindquist S.

Other conditions or agents that interfere with protein folding as well as denatured proteins are usually stress protein inducers. They include denatured bovine serum albumin, mutated actin, heavy metals, arsenite, and amino acid analogs (18Beckman R.P. Lovett M. Welch W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 6: 1137-1150Crossref Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 19Hightower L.E. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 102: 407-427Google Scholar, 20Anathan J. Goldberg A.L. Voelmy R.

The latter agents are structural analogs of natural amino acids and are therefore rapidly incorporated into newly synthesized proteins (19Hightower L.E. J.

Hence, they induce irreversible aberrant protein conformations that lead to the induction of stress proteins, such as hsp70, and glucose-regulated proteins, i.e. Grp78/Bip (17Hightower L.E.

NF-κB belongs to a family of inducible transcription factors, the Rel/NF-κB family (26Grimm S. Baeuerle P.-A. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 27Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1662) Google Scholar). In addition to being a major enhancer of the HIV-1 LTR promoter, NF-κB regulates the expression of numerous cellular genes, particularly those involved in the immune and inflammatory responses (29Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 47: 921-928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar, 30Baeuerle P.-A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 63-80PubMed Google Scholar, 31Grilli M.

Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4599) Google Scholar). NF-κB activation is under the control of the IκB family of inhibitory subunits. The most studied IκB protein is IκB-α which associates in the cytoplasm with NF-κB dimer (33Baeuerle P.-A. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar, 34Brown K. Park S. Kanno T. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1995; 15: 2166-2172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and therefore inhibits the nuclear translocation of this dimeric factor. NF-κB is activated by a large number of signals, which include inflammatory cytokines, phorbol esters (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate) (39Thompson J.E. Phillips R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar), pathogenic agents (32Baeuerle P.-A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4599) Google Scholar), UV irradiations (40Devary Y. Rosette C. DiDonato J.A. Karin M. Science. 1993; 261: 1442-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), oxidative stress (7Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3420) Google Scholar), or protein accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum (41Pahl H.L. Baeuerle P.-A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2580-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). In activated cells, the cytoplasmic NF-κB-IκB-α complex is disrupted, and NF-κB is then allowed to migrate into the nucleus where it can bind to κB elements (42Henkel T. Machleidt T. Alkalay I. Krönke M. Ben-Neriah Y. Baeuerle P.-A. Nature. 1993; 365: 182-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). The NF-κB-IκB-α complex is disrupted through IκB-α phosphorylation at the level of serines 32 and 36 (43Mellits K.H. Hay R.T. Goodbourn S. Nucleic.

Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar), which triggers the ubiquitination of this protein and its specific degradation by the proteasome (44Traenckner E.B.-M. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5433-5441Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 48Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T.

Commun. 1995; 215: 292-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This pathway is inhibited by antioxidant drugs (7Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3420) Google Scholar) or by the overexpression of detoxifiant enzymes such as catalase (51Schmidt K.N. Amstad P. Cerutti P. Baeuerle P.A. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 13-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar) or glutathione peroxidase (52Kretz-Remy C. Mehlen P. Mirault M.-E. Arrigo A.-P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1083-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), suggesting that crucial redox events or intracellular reactive oxygen species are involved in NF-κB activation. Recently, an alternative mechanism of NF-κB activation has been reported to occur in Jurkat T cells stimulated with pervanadate. In this case, tyrosine phosphorylation of IκB-α activates NF-κB without proteolytic degradation of IκB-α (53Imbert V. Rupec R.A. Livolsi A. Pahl H.L. Traenckner E.B.-M. Mueller-Dieckmann C. Farahifar D. Rossi B. Auberger P. Baeuerle P.A. Peyron J.-F. Cell. 1996; 86: 787-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). However, redox modulation of this phenomenon, (ROS are potent inhibitors of tyrosine phosphatases (54Heffetz D. Rutter W.J. Zick Y. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar)) is still a matter of debate (53Imbert V. Rupec R.A. Livolsi A. Pahl H.L. Traenckner E.B.-M. Mueller-Dieckmann C. Farahifar D.

Independently of its rapid breakdown induced by several stimuli and compared with NF-κB protein subunits, IκB-α is inherently unstable and undergoes a continuous turnover. This phenomenon does not require the prior phosphorylation or ubiquitination of IκB-α but still appears mediated by the proteasome (57Krappmann D. Wulczyn F.G. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1997; 15: 6716-6726Crossref Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Since HIV-1 LTR is transcriptionally activated by several cellular stress, including heat shock (6Geelen J.L.M.C. Minnaaar R.P. Boom R. Van Der Noordaa J. Goudsmith J. J. Gen. Virol. 1988; 69: 2913-2917Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 8Re M.C. Furlini G. La Placa M. J. Virol.

Arrigo A.-P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 337-344Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar), we tested whether the accumulation of aberrantly conformed proteins could trigger the activity of this promoter. To this end, the inducible activity of amino acid analogs have been tested. We demonstrate here that azetidine or canavanine, which mimic proline and arginine, respectively, are powerful transcriptional activators of HIV-1 LTR. This stimulation, which necessitated the κB sites present in the LTR, was impaired by antioxidizing conditions. In contrast, hsp70 promoter activation by amino acid analogs was stimulated by antioxidant conditions. Concomitantly with HIV-1 LTR activation, we show that amino acid analogs induced the proteasome-mediated degradation of the inhibitory subunit IκB-α without a prior change in its isoform distribution. Hence, aberrant protein conformation appears to generate pro-oxidant conditions that trigger the degradation of short lived and probably misfolded proteins, such as IκB-α, and subsequently the activation of NF-κB, a phenomenon that results in HIV-1 transcriptional stimulation. HeLa cells were grown at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. The human breast carcinoma T47D cell derivatives T47D-Hygro and the corresponding cell line T47D-GPx that overexpress selenoglutathione peroxidase have already been described (52Kretz-Remy C. Mehlen P. Mirault M.-E. Arrigo A.-P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1083-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 58Mirault M.-E. Tremblay A. Beaudoin N. Tremblay M. J. Biol.

They were grown at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2 in Hepes-buffered RPMI medium (Sigma Chimie, Saint-Quentin Fallavier, France) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc., France), 0.1 μm fresh sodium selenite, 2 mml-glutamine, 0.5 μg/ml insulin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. Prior to amino acid analog treatments, cells were incubated 30 min in DMEM or RPMI medium supplemented with 5 or 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum. The proteasome inhibitorN-Cbz-Ile-Glu(O-t-butyl)-Ala-leucinal (PSI) (Sigma Chimie, Saint-Quentin Fallavier, France), which had been dissolved in Me2SO at a concentration of 60 mm, was added 50 min prior to stimulation with amino acid analogs, at the final concentration of 60 μm. Actinomycin D, azetidine (l-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid), canavanine, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), PSI, hydrogen peroxide, and type B gelatin were from Sigma Chimie (Saint Quentin Fallavier, France). The calcium chelator [1,2-bis-(O-aminophenoxy)ethane-N, N, N′, N′-tetraacetic acid tetra(acetoxy-methyl)ester] (BAPTA-AM) was from Calbiochem (Meudon, France). Anti-p65/RelA, anti-p50, and anti-IκBα/MAD-3 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). pLTR-cat, p17-cat-neo, and pSV2-cat plasmids were described elsewhere (10Kretz-Remy C. Arrigo A.-P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 337-344Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). p2xκB-37TKcat vector, which is made of two artificially constructed κB sites in front of a cat gene, has already been described (60Meyer M. Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2005-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). pCMVβ is a plasmid from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA) that contains the β-galactosidase gene under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. pLTR-PstI is identical to pLTR-cat except that the first two bases of the two consensus κB sequences present in the LTR were mutated. This mutant was produced by megaprimer polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis (61Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar). Primer for the entire HIV-1 LTR were upstream primer (5′-GGGCTCGAGACCTAGAAAAACATGG-3′), containing a XhoI site (underlined) and downstream (reverse) primer (5′-GGGTCTAGAAGCTTTATTGAGGCTTAAGCAG-3′), containing sites for XbaI and HindIII. The mutagenic primer (5′-TTGCTACAACAGACTTCCGCTGCAGACTTTCCAG-3′) created a PstI site between the two mutated NF-κB consensus binding sites. Mutated bases are in boldface type. A first round of amplification with the mutagenic and down stream primers was used to amplify the 3′ region of the HIV-1 LTR. The resulting fragment which was mutated in both NF-κB sites was gel purified and used as downstream primer in a subsequent reaction to amplify the entire HIV-1 LTR. The final polymerase chain reaction product of 0.7 kilobase pair was gel purified and the presence of the PstI site verified by digestion. The fragment was then digested withXhoI-XbaI and ligated into the pLTR-cat vector from which the wild type HIV-1 LTR had been removed byXhoI-XbaI digestion. Mutant plasmids which contained the full-length sequence with PstI and HindIII sites were sequenced to confirm the mutated sites and the absence of other mutations. HeLa cells were seeded out 12 h before transfection at a density of 3 × 106 cells/100-mm dishes. Transfection experiments were performed as described by Kretz-Remy and Arrigo (10Kretz-Remy C. Arrigo A.-P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 337-344Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Briefly, 8 μg of the desired cat-containing plasmid described above were added to a transfection buffer containing 24 μl of Transfectam reagent (Promega, France) and then mixed with the 2-ml culture medium. Ten hours after transfection, cells were trypsinized and replated into four to six 60-mm dishes. Twelve hours later, cells were submitted to various amino acid analog treatments and were allowed to recover for 24 h prior to harvesting. Transfected cells were lysed, and 50 μg of total cellular proteins were analyzed using the Boehringer CAT-ELISA test according to the manufacturer's instructions. The percentage of cells expressing β-galactosidase was monitored by 5-bromo-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactosidase staining (62Lim K. Chae C.B. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 576-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). HeLa cells growing on glass coverslips coated with 0.1% of type B gelatin were submitted to various treatments with amino acid analogs. They were then rinsed with PBS at 37 °C and fixed for 90 s in cold methanol; anti-p65/RelA antibody was diluted 1:100 in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin coupled to isothiocyanate was used as a second antibody (Organon Teknica-Cappel, Fresnes, France). The stained cells were examined and photographed with a Zeiss Axioskop photomicroscope. Fluorescent images were recorded onto Tri-X Pan (Eastman Kodak Co.) film. Extraction of DNA-binding proteins and binding conditions have been previously described (10Kretz-Remy C. Arrigo A.-P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 337-344Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of protein from nuclear extracts were incubated with a 20,000 cpm (Cerenkov) 32P-labeled κB DNA probe in the presence of 4 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Pharmacia) and 1 μl of 10 × BB buffer. Reaction was for 15 min at room temperature following the addition of the 32P-labeled κB probe. The double-strand oligonucleotide used to detect the DNA binding activity of NF-κB was as described previously (52Kretz-Remy C. Mehlen P. Mirault M.-E. Arrigo A.-P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1083-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 63Zabel U. Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 252-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the competition experiments, 10 or 40 ng of cold κB probe were added to the binding mix including proteins just before the incubation with the32P-labeled κB probe. Supershift experiments were also performed by adding, 30 min before the incubation with the32P-labeled κB probe, 2 μg of an antibody raised against the p65/RelA subunit of NF-κB to the binding mix including proteins. Native 4% acrylamide gels were used to analyze the samples. Autoradiographs of the gels were recorded onto BioMax MR films (Eastman Kodak Co.). HeLa cells were pulse labeled wih [35S]methionine and -cysteine (Tran35S-label, 1504 Ci/mmol, ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) for different periods of time in methionine- and cysteine-free DMEM (ICN) containing 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum. Thereafter, cells were rinsed with PBS and scrapped off the dish. Before cellular extraction, aliquots were withdrawn for determination of protein concentration. For cellular extraction, 1.5 × 106 HeLa or T47D cells grown in 60-mm cell culture dishes and submitted to various amino acid analog treatments were washed with cold PBS. The cells were then scraped from the dishes and pelleted for 5 min at 1000 ×g. The cellular pellet was then lysed and boiled in Laemmli sample buffer for 5 min. One- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and immunoblots were performed as already described using gels that contained 10% (45Traenckner E.B.-M. Pahl H.L. Henkel T. Schmidt K.N. Wilk S.

Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1083-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) acrylamide. The isoelectrofocusing gels were made up with 60% of pH 4–6 and 40% of pH 3–10 Ampholines (Sigma Chimie, Saint-Quentin Fallavier, France). Isoelectrofocusing sample buffer contained pH 6–8 Ampholine. Immunoblots were probed with p65/RelA, p50, or IκB-α/MAD-3 antisera as primary antibodies and were revealed with the ECL kit from Amersham Corp. (United Kingdom). The duration of exposure was calculated to be in the linear response of the film. For immunoprecipitation under native conditions, a constant number of radiolabeled cells was analyzed. [35S]Methionine-labeled cells were rinsed in PBS, lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) and clarified for 10 min at 10,000 ×g. Immunoprecipitation was performed by incubating cell lysates with anti-IκB-α or preimmune serum for 3 h on ice before incubation of 1 h in the presence of protein A-Sepharose CL4B (Sigma Chimie, Saint-Quentin Fallavier, France). Thereafter, the protein A-immunocomplexes were centrifuged for 15 s at 10,000 × g, washed several times with radioimmune precipitation buffer, and boiled in SDS sample buffer. After removal of protein A-Sepharose by centrifugation, samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The transcriptional activity of HIV-1 LTR was tested in HeLa cells transiently transfected with pLTR-cat, a plasmid that contains the cat gene under the control of the HIV-1 LTR (see “Materials and Methods”). Parallel experiments were also performed with p17-cat-neo plasmid that contains the cat gene under the control of the promoter of the human hsp70 gene. Transfection efficiency at about 60%, tested by using the β-galactosidase gene-bearing pCMVβ plasmid, was similar in all experiments (not shown). Fig. 1 A shows the pattern of activation of pLTR-cat and p17-cat-neo plasmids in HeLa cells exposed for 6 h to increasing concentrations of the proline analog, azetidine. The level of CAT polypeptide was quantified after a 24-h recovery period in a medium devoid of azetidine by CAT-ELISA testing (see “Materials and Methods”). A gradual increase of CAT polypeptide driven by pLTR-cat or p17-cat-neo plasmids was observed following treatment with increasing doses of azetidine. Of interest, the intensity of LTR activation was about 4-fold that of the hsp70 promoter. The reverse was observed when cells were exposed to heat shock (Fig. 1 A). In addition, following exposure to 15 mm azetidine for different time periods, the kinetics of activation of HIV-1 LTR peaked after 6 h of treatment (Fig. 1 B). As seen in Fig. 1, C and D, similar kinetics of activation of HIV-1 LTR and hsp70 promoter were also observed when canavanine, an arginine analog, was used instead of azetidine. In this case, however, the difference in the inducibility of the LTR versus hsp70 promoter was only 2.5-fold instead of the 4-fold induced by azetidine. Control experiments were performed using the pSV2-cat plasmid that contains the cat gene under the control of the constitutive early promoter of SV40 virus. In this case, no change in the level of CAT polypeptide was induced by azetidine, canavanine (Fig. 1, E and F) or heat (not shown) (10Kretz-Remy C. Arrigo A.-P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 337-344Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Hence, amino acid analogs act as potent activators of HIV-1 LTR. We next investigated whether the amino acid analog activation of HIV-1 LTR resulted in transcriptional events. This was assessed by analyzing the effect of actinomycin D (0.5 μg/ml) on the production of the CAT polypeptide driven by HIV-1 LTR. To this end, transfected HeLa cells were treated for 6 h with increasing concentrations of either azetidine (Fig. 2 A) or canavanine (Fig. 2 B) and then allowed to recover for 3 h in a medium devoid of amino acid analogs. Actinomycin D was added 10"

https://openalex.org/W1970989980,"The insulin-stimulated uptake of 2-(methylamino)isobutyric acid (MeAIB), a nonmetabolizable substrate for system A, in 3T3-L1 adipocytes was investigated. As cells took on a more adipogenic phenotype, the insulin-stimulatedversus the saturable basal MeAIB uptake increased by 5-fold. The induced transport activity showed properties characteristic of system A, with a K m value of 190 μm. The half-life of the induced system A activity was independent of de novo mRNA and protein synthesis and was not accelerated by ambient amino acids, therefore, it was mechanistically distinct from the previously described adaptive and hormonal regulation of system A. Inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase by PD98059, Ras farnesylation by PD152440 and B581, p70S6K by rapamycin, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3′-K) by wortmannin and LY294002 revealed that only wortmannin and LY294002 inhibited the insulin-induced MeAIB uptake with IC50 values close to that previously reported for inhibition of PI 3′-K. These results suggest that the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase and pp70S6K insulin signaling pathways are neither required nor sufficient for insulin stimulation of MeAIB uptake, and activation of PI 3′-K or a wortmannin/LY294002-sensitive pathway may play an important role in regulation of system A transport by insulin in 3T3-L1 cells.

Mammalian cells contain multiple systems for uptake of neutral amino acids. System A is an ubiquitous amino acid transport system that mediates the Na+-dependent uptake of a wide range of neutral amino acids (1Collarini E.J. Oxender D.L. Annu. Rev.

Regul. 1985; 25: 133-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In a number of cell types system A is regulated by a variety of external stimuli and conditions, such as hormones, amino acid starvation (adaptive regulation), cell growth, differentiation, hyperosmotic stress, and trans-inhibition produced by high levels of endogenous amino acid substrates (1Collarini E.J. Oxender D.L. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1987; 7: 75-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 2Christensen H.N. Biochim. Biophys.

It is generally believed that hormonal and adaptive regulation of system A occurs at the level of transcription (4Kilberg M.S. Barber E.F. Handlogten M.E. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1985; 25: 133-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 5McGivan J.D. Pastor-Anglada M. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 321-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanisms of the signal transduction in insulin action have been extensively investigated (6Saltiel A.R. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1034-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the mechanism responsible for hormonal regulation of system A transport remains largely unknown. An insulin-insensitive Chinese hamster ovary cell line has been isolated (7Moffett J. Perier F. Jones M. Englesberg E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8040-8043Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). These authors proposed that, when insulin binds to its receptor, it regulates system A activity directly or indirectly by inactivation of a regulatory protein designated r2, but the molecular events leading to neutralizing this protein by insulin have not been resolved (5McGivan J.D. Pastor-Anglada M. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 321-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar).

However, the specificity and kinetics of the insulin-induced amino acid uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and the signaling events potentially involved in insulin stimulation of system A transport in mammalian cells have not previously been explored in great detail. In this report, we investigate the regulation of system A transport by insulin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Cell culture reagents, epidermal growth factor, PDGF, IGF-I, and IGF-II were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. [14C]MeAIB was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc., and [γ-32P]ATP from Amersham Corp. Wortmannin, LY294002, B518, and rapamycin were purchased from BIOMOL Research Laboratories, Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Anti-p42/p44 MAP kinase antiserum used for Western blotting was prepared from rabbits immunized with a C-terminal peptide (amino acids 425–445) of p44 MAP kinase (p44MAPK) expressed as a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein. PD98059 and PD152440 were synthesized by Parke-Davis. Phosphatidylinositol was purchased from Avanti (Birmingham, AL). The S6 kinase kit and the mouse anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The GH and insulin were obtained from Eli Lilly; IL-11 from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), and all other chemicals from Sigma. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% calf serum in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, air. Differentiation to adipocytes was induced by incubating confluent monolayers (day 0) for 2 days in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and 0.4 μg/ml dexamethasone, followed by incubation for 2 more days in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 μg/ml insulin. Two days after transfer to the same medium without insulin, greater than 90% of the cells expressed the adipocyte phenotype. Unless otherwise stated, experiments were performed on adipocytes 2–4 days after withdrawal from the differentiation medium (days 6–8). This assay was carried out as described previously (9Lazar D.F. Wiese R.J. Brady M.J. Mastick C.C. Waters S.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Cuatrecasas P. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol.

After hormone stimulation for 10 min, the cells (10-cm culture dishes) were harvested in cold lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm Na3VO4, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 20 μm leupeptin, 20 μm pepstatin A) and kept on ice for 30 min. Insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation and the supernatants were incubated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody under agitation at 4 °C for 1 h. Protein A-agarose beads were added and incubated for another hour. The immunoprecipitates were sequentially washed with lysis buffer, washing buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 m LiCl, 1 mmNa3VO4, 100 μm PMSF, 20 μm leupeptin, 20 μm pepstatin A), and PI 3′-kinase buffer (20 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na3VO4, 100 μm PMSF, 20 μm leupeptin, 20 μm pepstatin A). The precipitates were suspended in 50 μl of PI 3′-kinase buffer. The reaction was carried out at 25 °C for 20 min in the presence of 0.4 mg/ml phosphatidylinositol and 10 μm ATP (containing 0.2 mCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP). The reaction was terminated by adding to each tube 100 μl of CHCl3:MeOH:HCl (100:200:2). To the mixture 100 μl of CHCl3 and H2O each were then added, and the mixture was vortexed. After centrifugation, the lower phase (organic phase) was spotted on a thin layer chromatography plate. The plate was developed in CHCl3:MeOH:H2O:NH4OH (43:38:7:5). The dried plate was visualized by autoradiography on x-ray film. For the assay of p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K), 3T3-L1 adipocytes were serum-starved for 16 h. The cells were treated with or without rapamycin (100 ng/ml) for 1 h followed by treatment with insulin for 10 min. The cells were harvested and the S6 kinase activity of cytosolic extracts was detected according to the procedure provided by Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. using a peptide substrate. The S6 kinase activity was obtained by subtracting the values for unstimulated cells from the values for the insulin-induced cells. MAP kinase was assayed as described previously (9Lazar D.F. Wiese R.J. Brady M.J. Mastick C.C. Waters S.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Cuatrecasas P. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20801-20807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). In brief, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were serum-starved overnight and then pretreated or untreated with 50 μm PD98059 for 1 h before stimulation by 100 nm insulin for 15 min. Cell lysates were collected in cold buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 10 mmNa-pyrophosphate, 1 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 mm benzamidine). The precleared lysates (10,000 × g, 10 min) containing 10 μg of protein were subjected to 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with 75:1 of acrylamide:bisacrylamide (w/w) and 0.5m Tris-HCl. After electrophoresis, the gel was transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with anti-p42/p44 MAP kinase antiserum. The immunoreactive proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection. The sodium-containing buffer for transport assay was phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) consisting of 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10.6 mmNa2HPO4, and 1.5 mmKH2PO4. Prior to use, PBS buffer (pH 7.4) was supplemented with 20 mmd-glucose, 0.49 mm MgCl2, 0.9 mm CaCl2, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin. Before stimulation, the cells were incubated in serum-free DMEM for 3–4 h and then switched to the same medium containing stimuli and incubated for 5–6 h. The cluster tray transport assay was used as described previously (11Su T.Z. Campbell G.W. Oxender D.L. Brain Res. 1997; 757: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To eliminate trans-inhibition, the intracellular pool of amino acids was depleted by incubation in PBS for 40 min, with a change to fresh PBS at 20 min in the presence or absence of stimuli. An appropriate amount of choline chloride was added to each reaction mixture to keep all solutions at equal osmolarity. Since uptake of MeAIB was linear at 37 °C for at least 15 min, 10-min uptake was used for determining initial uptake rates. Unless otherwise noted, the MeAIB concentration for initial rate of transport measurements was 50 μm, the concentration of insulin was 100 nm, and all transport rates were referred to as saturable uptake rates. The saturable uptake rates were calculated by subtracting the MeAIB uptake rates in the presence of 10 mm excess unlabeled MeAIB from the total uptake rates. The differentiation of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts to adipocytes is accompanied by a dramatic increase in insulin sensitivity (12Rubin C.S. Lai E. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3554-3557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To evaluate the regulation of amino acid transport in these cells, the uptake of 50 μm MeAIB was determined for a period of 14 days after induction of differentiation. In preadipocytes insulin produced only about a 2-fold increase over the saturable basal uptake of MeAIB (Fig. 1). The maximal insulin response occurred 3 days after induction of differentiation. The maximal insulin-stimulated transport decreased from days 4 to 5, reaching levels about 2-fold higher than that of preadipocytes. Basal MeAIB uptake was increased 3–4 days after initiation of differentiation. However, the basal uptake rates at these time points were determined 8 h after switching from insulin-containing to insulin-free medium, suggesting that the increased basal uptake may represent residual activity resulting from previous stimulation (see below). As cells took on a more adipogenic phenotype, basal activity was reduced to about 20% of that seen in fibroblasts. Thus the effects of insulin to stimulate amino acid transport increased to 10-fold. This pattern of reduced basal and increased insulin-dependent activity in fully differentiated adipocytes is similar to that observed for glycogen synthesis in these cells (13Brady M.J. Nairn A.C. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29698-29703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Protein synthesis in 3T3-L1 cells was also significantly enhanced during the incubation with insulin for 2 days (days 3 to 4) and reached a steady state level after switching to insulin-free medium (Fig. 1). An increase in adipocyte protein content (about 20%) was consistently observed during 5–6 h of stimulation of amino acid transport by insulin. Thus the transport velocity when expressed as the amount of substrate incorporated per unit surface area of cell monolayer (8Grunfeld C. Jones D.S. Endocrinology. 1983; 113: 1763-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) may not be representative of the insulin action specific for system A transport (14Marshall S. Monzon R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2037-2042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To evaluate the kinetics of stimulation of amino acid transport, MeAIB uptake was assayed after exposure to insulin for different times (Fig. 2 A). The effect of insulin was maximal by 5–6 h. Evaluation of the dose response to insulin revealed an EC50 of 5.2 nm (Fig. 2 B). To determine the initial uptake rate kinetics in differentiated adipocytes, the concentration dependence of the process was examined. The basal MeAIB uptake increased in direct proportion to concentration (Fig. 2 C), suggesting that the unstimulated or basal entry of MeAIB in adipocytes was predominantly mediated by a nonsaturable process (60–70%). In contrast, the insulin-stimulated MeAIB uptake was saturable, exhibiting typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics with aK m value of 190 μm and V max of 390 pmol/min/mg of protein. Saturable uptake of MeAIB has been regarded as the simplest indication for mediation by system A (2Christensen H.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 779: 255-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). To determine that system A mediates the insulin-stimulated amino acid transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, the MeAIB transport was characterized. Inhibition of MeAIB uptake by various amino acids produced a typical system A transport pattern (Fig. 3, left). Alanine, serine, cysteine, proline, and histidine inhibited MeAIB uptake by more than 90%, whereas the cationic amino acids, arginine and lysine, had no effect. It is noteworthy that the anionic amino acids, glutamate and aspartate, showed moderate inhibition of MeAIB uptake (30–40%). Inhibition by glutamate was inversely proportional to pH (data not shown), indicating that the anionic amino acids could be interacting with system A as uncharged zwitterions (2Christensen H.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 779: 255-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Consistent with the major properties of system A transport, uptake of MeAIB in 3T3-L1 adipocytes was strictly Na+-dependent. More than 90% of the MeAIB entry was eliminated when sodium was replaced with choline. In addition, system A activity decreased by 35% in cells preloaded with 50 μm MeAIB for 40 min (trans-inhibition), and by 65% at pH 5.0 as compared with pH 7.4 (Fig. 3, right). The substrate specificity, hormonal stimulation, Na+ dependence, decreased transport activity at lower pH, and trans-inhibition indicate that the insulin-stimulated MeAIB uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes is mediated by a typical A-type transport system (1Collarini E.J. Oxender D.L. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1987; 7: 75-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In contrast to the insulin-stimulated MeAIB uptake, the basal or unstimulated transport was resistant to inhibition by histidine, leaving open the possibility that the constitutively expressed low transport activity is mediated by a different subtype of system A. Instability is a mechanistically important feature of the regulation of system A transport (15Handlogten M.E. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3519-3525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Bracy D.S. Handlogten M.E. Barber E.F. Han H.P. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1514-1520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kilberg M.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 183-186Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To determine the half-life of the stimulated MeAIB transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, the time course of its activity was followed after removal of insulin from the adipocyte growth medium. At the onset of adipocyte differentiation (day 2), the insulin-stimulated uptake decayed rapidly with an estimated half-life of 1.5 h (Fig. 4, PBS), similar to what is observed in hepatocytes (15Handlogten M.E. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3519-3525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fully differentiated adipocytes, the insulin-induced transport activity decayed at much slower rates, with at½ of 4.3 h. To determine if the decay of system A activity was associated with a newly synthesized repressor-type protein or repression by ambient amino acids (15Handlogten M.E. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3519-3525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Bracy D.S. Handlogten M.E. Barber E.F. Han H.P. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1514-1520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cycloheximide and actinomycin D (1 μg/ml) were added 1 h before removal of insulin, or the cells were incubated in insulin-free medium in the presence or absence of ambient amino acids. As shown in Fig. 4, these agents had no effect on the half-life. Moreover, the similarity in half-life between amino acid-free and amino acid-containing media (PBS versus DMEM) suggests that the decay is not caused by ambient amino acids. Following decay of the insulin-stimulated uptake, the MeAIB transport activity could be re-established by switching to insulin-containing medium. As with the stimulated transport activity before the decay, most of the re-established MeAIB uptake was also substantially inhibited by cycloheximide (81 ± 2%) and actinomycin D (95 ± 2%) (Fig. 3, right), suggesting that the insulin-induced or the decayed MeAIB uptake is associated, respectively, with de novo synthesis or degradation of protein(s) essential for system A function. The regulation of protein phosphorylation is believed to play a central role in insulin action (6Saltiel A.R. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1034-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The two best characterized pathways leading to insulin-dependent serine phosphorylation involve either MAP kinase or p70S6K (18Cheatham B. Vlahos C.J. Cheatham L. Wang L. Blenis J. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4902-4911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). To determine if Ras/MAP kinase pathway is required for the stimulation of system A transport by insulin, PD98059, a specific inhibitor of MEK (19Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2593) Google Scholar), was examined. At 10 μm concentration, PD98059 is sufficient to block the activation of MEK, MAP kinase, and pp90rsk, and the induction of c-fos transcription (9Lazar D.F. Wiese R.J. Brady M.J. Mastick C.C.

However, this agent did not significantly affect the insulin-stimulated MeAIB uptake even at concentrations up to 50 μm, while the same concentration of PD98059 caused nearly complete inhibition of the insulin-induced activation of MAP kinases (Fig. 5). To further exclude involvement of this signaling pathway, inhibition of the farnesylation of Ras, the upstream mediator for activation of the MAP kinase pathway, by specific inhibitors PD152440 (20Gabbay R.A.

Rowell C. Ackermann K. Kowalczyk J.J. Lewis M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18415-18418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was tested. At concentrations of 10 and 50 μm, respectively, these two compounds have been shown to effectively block activation of MAP kinase (20Gabbay R.A. Sutherland C. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. O'Brien R.M.

Fig. 5 shows that rapamycin at concentrations up to 200 ng/ml did not produce significant inhibition of the insulin-stimulated MeAIB uptake, while 100 ng/ml of rapamycin eliminated activation of p70S6K by 90%. The same results were obtained when rapamycin and PD98059 were added together, suggesting that the pp70S6K signaling pathway is not likely involved in the insulin stimulation of system A transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. To explore the role of PI 3′-K in the regulation of system A transport, the two structurally distinct inhibitors of PI 3′-K, wortmannin and LY294002, were employed (24Ui M. Okada T. Hazeki K.

As seen in Fig. 5, both compounds were potent inhibitors of the insulin-stimulated system A activity with IC50 values of 17 nm and 9.8 μm, respectively. These IC50 values are similar to those reported for inhibition of insulin-activation of PI 3′-K (20Gabbay R.A. Sutherland C. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Flier J.S. J. Biol.

To explore the link between activation of PI 3′-K and stimulation of system A transport by insulin, we examined the effects of a series of hormones and growth factors that differentially regulate these processes. As seen in Fig. 6, epidermal growth factor, glucagon, and TPA were ineffective in activation of PI 3′-K, however, GH, PDGF, and IL-11 produced a marked elevation of PI 3′-K as detected in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates. However, capability for activation of PI 3′-K did not correlate well with stimulation of MeAIB uptake. GH, PDGF, and IL-11 did not produce substantial stimulation of system A activity. Several models have been proposed to interpret the kinetic and genetic bases for the regulation of system A amino acid transport (5McGivan J.D. Pastor-Anglada M. Biochem.

According to these models, a “transport inactivation protein” or an active form of “repressor/inactivator” is thought to be responsible for the decay or adaptive regulation of system A activity. Evidence suggests that the histone-like nuclear proteins (16Bracy D.S. Handlogten M.E. Barber E.F. Han H.P. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol.

However, data presented here indicate that the decay of system A transport in adipocytes is not caused by synthesis of a repressor-type protein. Moreover, it also appears to be independent of ambient amino acids. Taken together, these data suggest that the insulin-stimulated system A transport in adipocytes is mediated by a mechanism different from that reported in hepatocytes (15Handlogten M.E. Kilberg M.S.

These include the retinoid X receptor (RXR), whose interaction with IκBβ is significantly stimulated by the RXR ligand 9-cis-retinoic acid, as shown in the yeast system as well as the glutathione S-transferase pull down assays. RXR is a nuclear protein, whereas IκBβ accumulates in the nucleus only in cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide or other inducers that result in prolonged activation of NFκB. Consistent with this, cotransfection with IκBβ specifically repressed the 9-cis-RA-induced transcriptional activities of RXR in an lipopolysaccharide-dependent manner. These results suggest a novel IκBβ-mediated antagonism between the signaling pathways of NFκB and RXR.

These results suggest a novel IκBβ-mediated antagonism between the signaling pathways of NFκB and RXR. The transcription factor NFκB is important for the inducible expression of a wide variety of cellular and viral genes (1Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Van Antwerp D. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar, 2Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). NFκB is composed of homo- and heterodimeric complexes of members of the Rel/NFκB family of polypeptides. In vertebrates, this family comprises p50, p65 (RelA), c-Rel, p52, and RelB. These proteins share a 300-amino acid region, known as the Rel homology domain, which binds to DNA and mediates homo- and heterodimerization. This domain also is the target of the IκBβ inhibitors, which include IκBα, IκBβ, IκBγ, Bcl-3, p105, and p100 (3Gilmore T.D. Morin P.J. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 427-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In the majority of cells, NFκB exists in an inactive form in the cytoplasm, bound to the inhibitory IκB proteins. Treatment of cells with various inducers results in the degradation of IκB proteins. The bound NFκB is released and translocates to the nucleus, where it activates appropriate target genes. IκBα is degraded in response to all of the known inducers of NFκB, whereas IκBβ is degraded only when cells are stimulated with inducers such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 1The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; RXR, retinoid X receptor; TR, thyroid hormone receptor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; β-gal, β-galactosidase; CAT, chloramphenical acetyltransferase; RA, retinoic acid. and interleukin-1 that cause persistent activation of NFκB (4Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Following degradation of the initial pool of IκBβ in response to LPS or interleukin-1, newly synthesized IκBβ accumulates in the nucleus as an unphosphorylated protein that forms a stable complex with NFκB and prevents it from binding to newly synthesized IκBα (5Suyang H.

To understand the molecular action of IκBβ, we exploited the yeast two-hybrid system (8Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar) to isolate a series of cDNAs encoding proteins that specifically interact with IκBβ. Interestingly, these include retinoid X receptor (RXR), a member of the nuclear hormone receptors that comprise a large family of ligand-dependent transcription factors, bind as homodimers or heterodimers to their cognate DNA elements, and regulate genes involved in critical aspects of cell proliferation, differentiation, and homeostasis (9Mangelsdorf D.J.

Herein, we show that the RXR-IκBβ interactions are stimulated by the RXR ligand 9-cis-RA and that cotransfection with IκBβ specifically represses the 9-cis-RA-induced transcriptional activities of RXR in an LPS-dependent manner. These results are consistent with a novel IκBβ-mediated antagonism between the signaling pathways of NFκB and RXR. Polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragments encoding IκBβ, Bcl-3, p50, and p65 were cloned intoEcoRI and SalI restriction sites of the LexA fusion vector pEG202PL or EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites of the B42 fusion vector pJG4–5 (8Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). B42/IκBβΔ1, IκBβΔ2, and IκBβΔ3 were previously isolated as independent isolates of Trip9 in the yeast two-hybrid screening as described (10Lee J.W. Choi H.-S. Gyuris J. Brent R. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 243-254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding LexA fusions to glucocorticoid receptor, RXR, TR, and TR459 as well as T7 vectors to express RXR-LBD, TR-LBD, TRΔ, TR459 and TR-ABC are as described (11Lee J.W. Ryan F.

To express GST fusions, polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragments encoding full-length IκBβ and IκBβΔ1 were cloned into EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites of pGEX4T (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). For mammalian expressions, full-length IκBα and IκBβ were constructed into the CDM8 vector. The expression vector for RXR, the reporter construct TREpal-CAT, and the transfection indicator construct pRSV-β-gal are as described (12Seol W. Mahon M.J. Lee Y.-K. Moore D.D. Mol.

The expression vector for Gal4-VP16 and the reporter construct Gal4-TKLuc were as described (14Forman B.M. Umesono K. Chen J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 541-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Candidate IκBβ interacting clones were isolated from a mouse liver cDNA library (13Seol W. Choi H.-S. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 72-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the yeast two-hybrid system as described (8Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar), with slight modifications. Approximately 106 primary yeast transformants of a derivative of EGY48 expressing the LexA-IκBβΔ1 were generated from an initial transformation with the cDNA library with selection for Trp auxotrophy. Library transformed cells were pooled and selected for Leu auxotrophy and expression of the LexA-β-galactosidase construct. A number of leucine-independent colonies harboring cDNAs encoding candidate LexA-IκBβΔ1 interactors were obtained. The cDNA library plasmids were recovered from appropriate yeast strains, propagated in Escherichia coli, and reintroduced into EGY48 derivatives expressing LexA alone, LexA-IκBβΔ1, or other LexA chimeras to confirm specific interaction. Finally, identities of isolated cDNAs were determined by DNA sequencing. For the yeast two-hybrid tests, plasmids encoding LexA fusions and B42 fusions were cotransformed intoSaccharomyces cerevisiae EGY48 strain containing the β-gal reporter plasmid, SH/18–34 (8Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). Plate and liquid assays of β-gal expression were carried out as described (10Lee J.W. Choi H.-S. Gyuris J. Brent R. Moore D.D. Mol.

Similar results were obtained in more than two similar experiments. The GST fusions or GST alone was expressed in E. coli, bound to glutathione-Sepharose-4B beads (Pharmacia), and incubated with labeled receptors or luciferase expressed by in vitro translation by using the TNT-coupled transcription-translation system, with conditions as described by the manufacturer (Promega, Madison, WI). Specifically bound proteins were eluted from beads with 40 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electorphoresis and autoradiography as described (12Seol W. Mahon M.J. Lee Y.-K. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1646-1655PubMed Google Scholar). CV1 cells were grown in 24-well plates with medium supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped serum for 24 h and transfected with 150 ng of β-galactosidase expression vector pRSV-β-gal and 100 ng of a reporter gene TREpal-CAT along with 10 ng of RXRα and increasing amounts (10–200 ng) of IκBβ expression vectors. For control experiments, Gal4-TKLuc and Gal4-VP16 (14Forman B.M. Umesono K. Chen J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 541-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar) replaced TREpal-CAT and RXR, respectively. Total amounts of expression vectors were kept constant by adding decreasing amounts of the CDM8 expression vector to transfections containing increasing amounts of the IκBβ vector. After 12 h, cells were washed and refed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum. After 12 h, cells were left unstimulated or stimulated with 2 μg/ml LPS either in the presence or the absence of 10−7m 9-cis-RA. Cells were harvested 24 h later, and CAT or luciferase activity was assayed as described (15Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Assoc., New York1995Google Scholar), and the results were normalized to the β-galactosidase expression. Similar results were obtained in more than two similar experiments. The validity of the yeast two-hybrid system (8Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar) in isolating IκBβ interactors was tested by examining interaction properties of IκBβ with various components of the NFκB complex in yeast. As expected from the published results (1Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Van Antwerp D. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar, 2Baldwin A.S.

Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar), IκBβΔ1, a N-terminal deletion mutant of IκBβ (depicted in Fig. 1), interacted specifically with p65 but not with p50. Similarly, p50 interacted with p65, Bcl-3, and p50, whereas p65 did not interact with Bcl-3 or p65 (Table I). In addition, Bcl-3 readily interacted with IκBβ and IκBβΔ1. 2S. Y. Na and J. W. Lee, unpublished observations. Full-length IκBβ was a transcriptional activator in yeast when fused to a heterologous DNA binding domain, whereas IκBβΔ1 was transcriptionally inert.2 Thus, we used IκBβΔ1 as a bait to isolate IκBβ interactors in the yeast two-hybrid system. One of the strongest IκBβ interactors isolated from a mouse liver cDNA library (13Seol W. Choi H.-S. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 72-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) encoded the RXR sequences from the third cysteine residue of the first zinc finger motif within the DNA-binding domain to the C termini. This result is consistent with our previous report in which IκBβ (initially referred to as Trip9) was first identified as one of a series of TR or RXR interacting proteins (10Lee J.W. Choi H.-S. Gyuris J. Brent R. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 243-254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results immediately raised a possibility of a novel, IκBβ-mediated cross-talk between NFκB and nuclear receptor signaling pathways.Table IInteractions between various components of the NFκB complex in yeastLexA/−LexA/IκBβΔ1LexA/p50LexA/p65B42/−WWWWB42/IκBβΔ1WWWLBB42/Bcl-3WBBWB42/p50WWBLBB42/p65WLBLBW Open table in a new tab The interaction of IκBβ with receptors was further characterized using the yeast two-hybrid system and GST pull down assays. As shown in Table II, the full-length IκBβ and three N-terminal deletion mutants (depicted in Fig. 1) corresponding to independent isolates of Trip9 (10Lee J.W. Choi H.-S. Gyuris J. Brent R. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 243-254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) all interacted strongly with TR or RXR in a hormone-stimulated manner. In contrast, the related Bcl-3 protein interacted relatively weakly only with RXR in a 9-cis-RA-stimulated manner. Both IκBβ and Bcl-3 failed to interact with glucocorticoid receptor. As shown in Fig. 1, IκBβ contains six ankyrin repeats that constitute the interaction interface with the Rel homology domain of NFκB, whereas Bcl-3 contains seven ankyrin repeats. Among these, ankyrin repeats 1, 5, and 6 of IκBβ and ankyrin repeat 3 of Bcl-3 contain a single amino acid motif LXXLL, recently shown to be an interaction interface for the nuclear hormone receptors (16Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar, 17Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). This motif apparently mediates the ligand-dependent interaction of the AF-2 transactivation domain of the receptors with transcription cofactors such as RIP-140, SRC-1, and CBP (16Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar, 17Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, all of the N-terminal deletion mutants of IκBβ capable of interacting with the receptors retain the last two LXXLL motifs (Fig. 1). Thus, we tested whether IκBβ and the N-terminal deletion mutants interact with LexA/TR459, a mutant TR-LBD that lacks AF-2 function but retains wild type affinity for thyroid hormone (T3) (10Lee J.W. Choi H.-S. Gyuris J. Brent R. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 243-254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Lee J.W. Ryan F. Swaffield J.C. Johnston S.A. Moore D.D. Nature. 1995; 374: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). This mutation blocked interaction with all of the IκBβ proteins, suggesting that the interaction interface may involve the AF-2 domain of nuclear receptors and the LXXLL motifs in the ankyrin repeats of IκBβ.Table IIIκBβ Interacts with RXR and TR in YeastLigandLexA/GRLexA/RXRLexA/TRLexA/TR459−+−+−+−+B42/−WWWWWWWWB42/Bcl-3WWWLBWWWWB42/IκBβWWLBBWLBWWB42/IκBβΔ1WWLBBWBWWB42/IκBβΔ2WWLBBWBWWB42/IκBβΔ3WWLBBWBWW Open table in a new tab To further characterize these interactions in vitro, GST fusions to IκBβ and IκBβΔ1 were expressed, purified, and tested for interaction with various in vitro translated receptor constructs. These include the ligand binding domains of RXR and TR (RXR-LBD and TR-LBD), the ABC domains of TR (TR-ABC), and full-length TRs deleted or point-mutated for the AF2 domain (TRΔ and TR459, respectively). As shown in Fig. 2, IκBβ and IκBβΔ1 interacted weakly with TR-LBD and RXR-LBD in the absence of ligand. In agreement with the yeast results, however, interactions of IκBβ with TR-LBD or RXR-LBD were significantly enhanced in the presence of each cognate ligand. IκBβΔ1 behaved similarly. In contrast, the AF2 mutants TRΔ and TR459 as well as TR-ABC showed relatively weak and hormone-independent interaction with IκBβ and IκBβΔ1. Thus, these results confirm the importance of the AF-2 for the ligand-dependent interactions and also suggest an additional ligand-independent interaction interface at the N-terminal ABC domains. To assess the functional consequences of these interactions, IκBβ was cotransfected into CV1 cells along with an RXR expression vector and a reporter construct controlled by TREpal, which is transactivated by RXR-RXR homodimers as well as various receptor heterodimers (18Baniahmad A. Steiner C. Kohne A.C. Renkawitz R. Cell. 1990; 61: 505-574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Increasing amounts of cotransfected IκBβ had no significant effect on transcriptional activities of the TREpal-driven reporter, either in the presence or the absence of 9-cis-RA (Fig. 3). Similarly, RXR did not affect the ability of either IκBβ or IκBα to inhibit transactivation by p65. 3M. Chung and D. D. Moore, unpublished observations. However, addition of 2 μg/ml LPS specifically inhibited 9-cis-RA-induced transcription in an IκBβ dose-dependent manner, with cotransfection of 200 ng of IκBβ decreasing transcriptional activities to near background levels (Fig. 3). In contrast, cotransfection of IκBβ did not affect the transcriptional activity of Gal4-VP16, either in the presence or the absence of LPS, as assessed using the Gal4-TKLuc reporter construct (14Forman B.M. Umesono K. Chen J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 541-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Similarly, IκBβ did not significantly affect β-galactosidase expression of the transfection indicator construct pRSV-β-gal in the presence or the absence of LPS or 9-cis-RA (data not shown). These results are consistent with the proposal that IκBβ translocation into the nucleus is dependent on stimulation by chronic inducers such as LPS (5Suyang H. Phillips R. Douglas I. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5444-5449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Weil R. Laurent-Winter C. Israel A J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 17: 4390-4396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and suggests that only this nuclear IκBβ is capable of interacting with nuclear receptors. These results along with the yeast and in vitro interaction results suggest that this nuclear IκBβ may mask the AF-2 domain of nuclear receptors from interacting with receptor coactivators. Alternatively, IκBβ bound to the AF-2 domain may have more direct inhibitory interactions with the transcriptional machinery. Consistent with this, LexA/IκBβ was a transcriptional activator in yeast, whereas LexA/IκBβΔ1 was not, suggesting the existence of an autonomous transactivation domain at the N terminus of IκBβ (amino acids 1–173).2 In addition, full-length IκBβ also showed specific binding to a novel transcription cofactor we recently isolated. 4H.

In conclusion, we have identified RXR as an IκBβ interactor and shown that this interaction decreases RXR-driven transcriptional activities in an LPS-dependent manner. This antagonism is in marked contrast to the glucocorticoid-dependent inhibition of NFκB activities, in which glucocorticoids increase the synthesis of IκBα, which should then sequester NFκB in an inactive cytoplasmic form (19Auphan W. DiDonato J.A. Rosette C. Helmberg A. Karin M. Science. 1995; 270: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2169) Google Scholar). However, it was recently suggested that glucocorticoid-induced IκBα synthesis and inhibition of NFκB activity are two separable biochemical processes (20Heck S. Bender K. Kullmann M. Gottlicher M. Herrlich P. Cato A.C.B. EMBO J. 1997; 15: 4698-4707Crossref Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Accordingly, glucocorticoid-mediated inhibition of NFκB activity may involve other mechanisms such as the IκBβ-RXR interactions described here. The antagonistic interaction is consistent with the fact that LPS is one of the best known pro-inflammatory agents (21McDonald P.P. Bald A. Cassatella M.A. Blood. 1997; 89: 3421-3433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas retinoids are anti-inflammatory (22Orfanos C.E. Ehlert R. Gollnick H. Drugs. 1987; 34: 459-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 23Gollnick H. Dermatologica. 1987; 175: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 24Orfanos C.E. Bauer R. Br. J. Dermatol. 1983; 109: 55-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, exploration of these interactions may lead to new insights into mechanisms of inflammatory signal transduction pathways and possibly the development of new anti-inflammatory agents.
