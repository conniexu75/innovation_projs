https://openalex.org/W2051192888,"OB-R is a high affinity receptor for leptin, an important circulating signal for the regulation of body weight. We identified an alternatively spliced transcript that encodes a form of mouse OB-R with a long intracellular domain. db/db mice also produce this alternatively spliced transcript, but with a 106 nt insertion that prematurely terminates the intracellular domain. We further identified G --> T point mutation in the genomic OB-R sequence in db/db mice. This mutation generates a donor splice site that converts the 106 nt region to a novel exon retained in the OB-R transcript. We predict that the long intracellular domain form of OB-R is crucial for initiating intracellular signal transduction, and as a corollary, the inability to produce this form of OB-R leads to the severe obese phenotype found in db/db mice."
https://openalex.org/W2122506044,"The JAK-STAT signaling pathway has been implicated in mediating biological responses induced by many cytokines. However, cytokines that promote distinct cellular responses often activate identical STAT proteins, thereby raising the question of how specificity is manifest within this signaling pathway. Here we report the generation and characterization of mice deficient in STAT1. STAT1-deficient mice show no overt developmental abnormalities, but display a complete lack of responsiveness to either IFN alpha or IFN gamma and are highly sensitive to infection by microbial pathogens and viruses. In contrast, these mice respond normally to several other cytokines that activate STAT1 in vitro. These observations document that STAT1 plays an obligate and dedicated role in mediating IFN-dependent biologic responses and reveal an unexpected level of physiologic specificity for STAT1 action."
https://openalex.org/W2079357798,"The STAT1 transcription factor is activated in response to many cytokines and growth factors. To study the requirement for STAT1 in vivo, we disrupted the Stat1 gene in embryonic stem (ES) cells and in mice. Stat1−/− ES cells were unresponsive to interferon (IFN), but retained responsiveness to leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and remained LIF dependent for undifferentiated growth. Stat1−/− animals were born at normal frequencies and displayed no gross developmental defects. However, these animals failed to thrive and were extremely susceptible to viral disease. Cells and tissues from Stat1−/− mice were unresponsive to IFN, but remained responsive to all other cytokines tested. Thus, STAT1 appears to be specific for IFN pathways that are essential for viability in the face of otherwise innocuous pathogens."

https://openalex.org/W2084107396,"Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), an important component of cholinergic synapses, colocalizes with amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) deposits of Alzheimer's brain. We report here that bovine brain AChE, as well as the human and mouse recombinant enzyme, accelerates amyloid formation from wild-type Aβ and a mutant Aβ peptide, which alone produces few amyloid-like fibrils. The action of AChE was independent of the subunit array of the enzyme, was not affected by edrophonium, an active site inhibitor, but it was affected by propidium, a peripheral anionic binding site ligand. Butyrylcholinesterase, an enzyme that lacks the peripheral site, did not affect amyloid formation. Furthermore, AChE is a potent amyloid-promoting factor when compared with other Aβ-associated proteins. Thus, in addition to its role in cholinergic synapses, AChE may function by accelerating Aβ formation and could play a role during amyloid deposition in Alzheimer's brain."

https://openalex.org/W2055938779,"Hippocampal synaptic inhibition is mediated by distinct groups of inhibitory cells. Some contact pyramidal cells perisomatically, while others terminate exclusively on their dendrites. We examined perisomatic and dendritic inhibition by recording from CA3 inhibitory and pyramidal cells and injecting biocytin to visualize both cells in light and electron microscopy. Single perisomatic inhibitory cells made 2-6 terminals clustered around the soma and proximal pyramidal cell processes. Dendritic cells established 5-17 terminals, usually on different dendrites of a pyramidal cells. Perisomatic terminals were larger than those facing dendritic membrane. Perisomatic inhibitory cells initiated the majority of simultaneous IPSPs seen in nearby pyramidal cells. Single IPSPs initiated by perisomatic sodium-dependent action potentials. Activation of inhibitory fibers terminating on dendrites could suppress calcium-dependent spikes. Thus, distinct inhibitory cells may differentially control dendritic electrogenesis and axonal output of hippocampal pyramidal cells."

https://openalex.org/W2017457582,"Most theories of the origin of biological organization assume that polymers with lengths in the range of 30-60 monomers are needed to make a genetic system viable. But it has not proved possible to synthesize plausibly prebiotic polymers this long by condensation in aqueous solution, because hydrolysis competes with polymerization. The potential of mineral surfaces to facilitate prebiotic polymerization was pointed out long ago. Here we describe a system that models prebiotic polymerization by the oligomerization of activated monomers--both nucleotides and amino acids. We find that whereas the reactions in solution produce only short oligomers (the longest typically being a 10-mer), the presence of mineral surfaces (montmorillonite for nucleotides, illite and hydroxylapatite for amino acids) induces the formation of oligomers up to 55 monomers long. These are formed by successive 'feedings' with the monomers; polymerization takes place on the mineral surfaces in a manner akin to solid-phase synthesis of biopolymers."
https://openalex.org/W2056217914,"Kinesin is the founding member of a superfamily of microtubule based motor proteins that perform force-generating tasks such as organelle transport and chromosome segregation. It has two identical approximately 960-amino-acid chains containing an amino-terminal globular motor domain, a central alpha-helical region that enables dimer formation through a coiled-coil, and a carboxy-terminal tail domain that binds light chains and possibly an organelle receptor. The kinesin motor domain of approximately 340 amino acids, which can produce movement in vitro, is much smaller than that of myosin (approximately 850 amino acids) and dynein (1,000 amino acids), and is the smallest known molecular motor. Here, we report the crystal structure of the human kinesin motor domain with bound ADP determined to 1.8-A resolution by X-ray crystallography. The motor consists primarily of a single alpha/beta arrowhead-shaped domain with dimensions of 70 x 45 x 45 A. Unexpectedly, it has a striking structural similarity to the core of the catalytic domain of the actin-based motor myosin. Although kinesin and myosin have virtually no amino-acid sequence++ identity, and exhibit distinct enzymatic and motile properties, our results suggest that these two classes of mechanochemical enzymes evolved from a common ancestor and share a similar force-generating strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2074557265,"In plants, resistance to pathogens is frequently determined by dominant resistance genes, whose products are proposed to recognize pathogen-encoded avirulence gene (Avr) products. The tomato resistance locus Cf-2 was isolated by positional cloning and found to contain two almost identical genes, each conferring resistance to isolates of tomato leaf mould (C. fulvum) expressing the corresponding Avr2 gene. The two Cf-2 genes encode protein products that differ from each other by only three amino acids and contain 38 leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs. Of the LRRs, 20 show extremely conserved alternating repeats. The C-terminus of Cf-2 carries regions of pronounced homology to the protein encoded by the unlinked Cf-9 gene. We suggest that this conserved region interacts with other proteins involved in activating plant defense mechanisms."

https://openalex.org/W2077557886,"VERTEBRATES have characteristic and conserved left–right (L–R) visceral asymmetries, for example the left-sided heart. In humans, alterations of L–R development can have serious clinical implications, including cardiac defects1. Although little is known about how the embryonic L–R axis is established, a recent study in the chick embryo revealed L–R asymmetric expression of several previously cloned genes, including Cnr-1 (for chicken nodal-related-1), and indicated how this L–R molecular asymmetry might be important for subsequent visceral morphogenesis2. Here we show that nodal3 is asymmetrically expressed in mice at similar stages, as is Xnr-1 (for Xenopus nodal related-1)4 in frogs. We also examine nodal expression in two mouse mutations that perturb L–R development, namely situs inversus viscerum (iv)5, in which assignment of L–R asymmetry is apparently random and individuals develop either normally or are mirror-image-reversed (situs inversus), and inversion of embryonic turning (inv)6, in which all individuals develop with situs inversus. In both, nodal expression is strikingly affected, being reversed or converted to symmetry. These results further support a key role for nodal and nodal-related genes in interpreting and relaying L–R patterning information in vertebrates. To our knowledge, our results provide the first direct evidence that iv and inv normally function well before the appearance of morphological L–R asymmetry."
https://openalex.org/W2108765087,"With prolonged stimulation, voltage-activated K+ channels close by a gating process called inactivation. This inactivation gating can occur by two distinct molecular mechanisms: N-type, in which a tethered particle blocks the intracellular mouth of the pore, and C-type, which involves a closure of the external mouth. The functional motion involved in C-type inactivation was studied by introducing cysteine residues at the outer mouth of Shaker K+ channels through mutagenesis, and by measuring state-dependent changes in accessibility to chemical modification. Modification of three adjacent residues in the outer mouth was 130-10,000-fold faster in the C-type inactivated state than in the closed state. At one position, state-dependent bridging or crosslinking between subunits was also possible. These results give a consistent picture in which C-type inactivation promotes a local rearrangement and constriction of the channel at the outer mouth."

https://openalex.org/W1976175452,"It has been hypothesized that the direction of synaptic weight change elicited by synaptic activity depends on the magnitude of the activity-dependent rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Several aspects of this hypothesis were examined at the Schaffer collateral CA1 synapse, where both long-term depression (LTD) and long-term potentiation (LTP) can be elicited and are Ca2+ dependent. Brief tetanic stimulation, which normally generated LTP, could induce LTD when Ca2+ entry via NMDA receptors was limited either by moderate concentrations of D-APV or by voltage clamping cells at negative membrane potentials. Repetitive activation of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels in the absence of afferent stimulation could also elicit an LTD that was Ca2+ dependent and was occluded by prior generation of homosynaptic LTD using prolonged low frequency stimulation. These results provide strong evidence that the minimal requirements for inducing LTD involve simply a transient influx of Ca2+ into the postsynaptic cell, via either NMDA receptors or voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels."
https://openalex.org/W2090648172,"The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-independent form of long-term potentiation (LTP) at hippocampal mossy fiber synapses requires presynaptic Ca(2+)-dependent activation of adenylyl cyclase. To determine whether this form of LTP might occur at other synapses, we examined cerebellar parallel fibers that, like hippocampal mossy fiber synapses, express high levels of the Ca2+/calmodulin-sensitive adenylyl cyclase I. Repetitive stimulation of parallel fibers caused a long-lasting increase in synaptic strength that was associated with a decrease in paired-pulse facilitation. Blockade of glutamate receptors did not prevent LTP induction, nor did loading of Purkinje cells with a Ca2+ chelator. LTP was occluded by forskolin-induced potentiation and blocked by the protein kinase A inhibitor Rp-8-CPT-cAMPS. These findings suggest that parallel fiber synapses express a form of LTP that is dependent on the activation of a presynaptic adenylyl cyclase and is indistinguishable from LTP at hippocampal mossy fiber synapses."
https://openalex.org/W2169622416,"Actin filaments assembled at the leading edge of neuronal growth cones are centripetally transported via retrograde F-actin flow, a process fundamental to growth cone guidance and other forms of directed cell motility. Here we investigated the role of myosins in retrograde flow, using two distinct modes of myosin inhibition: microinjection of NEM inactivated myosin S1 fragments, or treatment with 2,3-butanedione-2-monoxime, and inhibitor of myosin ATPase. Both treatments resulted in dose-dependent attenuation of retrograde F-actin flow and growth of filopodia. Growth was cytochalasin sensitive and directly proportional to the degree of myosin inhibition, suggesting that retrograde flow results from superimposition of two independent processes: actin assembly and myosin-based filament retraction. These results provide the first direct evidence for myosin involvement in neuronal growth cone function."
https://openalex.org/W1965255559,"Recent studies of GroE-mediated protein folding indicate that substrate proteins are productively released from a cis ternary complex in which the nonnative substrate is sequestered within the GroEL channel underneath GroES. Here, we examine whether protein folding can occur in this space. Stopped-flow fluorescence anisotropy of a pyrene-rhodanese-GroEl complex indicates that addition of GroES and ATP (but not ADP) leads to a rapid change in substrate flexibility at GroEL. Strikingly, when GroES release is blocked by the use of either a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog or a single-ring GroEL mutant, substrates complete folding while remaining associated with chaperonin. We conclude that the cis ternary complex, in the presence of ATP, is the active state intermediate in the GroE-mediated folding reaction: folding is initiated in this state and for some substrates may be completed prior to the timed release of GroES triggered by ATP hydrolysis."

https://openalex.org/W2053695860,"Voltage-gated K+ channels are protein complexes composed of ion-conducting integral membrane α subunits and cytoplasmic β subunits. Here, we show that, in transfected mammalian cells, the predominant β subunit isoform in brain, Kvβ2, associates with the Kv1.2 α subunit early in channel biosynthesis and that Kvβ2 exerts multiple chaperone-like effects on associated Kv1.2 including promotion of cotranslational N-linked glycosylation of the nascent Kv1.2 polypeptide, increased stability of Kvβ2/Kv1.2 complexes, and increased efficiency of cell surface expression of Kv1.2. Taken together, these results indicate that while some cytoplasmic K+ channel β subunits affect the inactivation kinetics of α subunits, a more general, and perhaps more fundamental, role is to mediate the biosynthetic maturation and surface expression of voltage-gated K+ channel complexes. These findings provide a molecular basis for recent genetic studies indicating that β subunits are key determinants of neuronal excitability."
https://openalex.org/W2044237630,"Transplantation studies have been used to show that tangential migration of olfactory bulb interneuron precursors is retarded in NCAM-mutant mice, and that this defect reflects loss of NCAM polysialic acid (PSA). In contrast, radial migration of cells within the bulb did not require PSA. Reciprocal transplantations between wild-type and mutant mice have revealed that the mutation affects the in vivo migration environment in the subventricular zone, and not movement of individual cells. However, in vitro migration of the cells into a PSA-negative collagen matrix environment was also PSA-dependent. The surprisingly similar results obtained in the in vivo and in vitro environments is consistent with the observation that migration of subventricular cells occurs as streams of closely apposed cells in which the PSA-positive cells appear to serve as their own migration substrate."

https://openalex.org/W1984425610,"Mammalian hairy and Enhancer of split homolog 1 (HES1), a basic helix-loop-helix factor gene, is expressed in retinal progenitor cells, and its expression decreases as differentiation proceeds. Retinal progenitor cells infected with HES1-transducing retrovirus did not differentiate into mature retinal cells, suggesting that persistent expression of HES1 blocks retinal development. In contrast, in the retina of HES1-null mutant mice, differentiation was accelerated, and rod and horizontal cells appeared prematurely and formed abnormal rosette-like structures. Lens and cornea development was also severely disturbed. Furthermore, in the mutant retina, bipolar cells extensively died and finally disappeared. These studies provide evidence that HES1 regulates differentiation of retinal neurons and is essential for eye morphogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W1994780702,"Carbon monoxide (CO) is an activator of soluble guanylyl cyclase and is implicated as a neuronal messenger. CO production, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity, and guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) levels were quantitated in cerebellar granule cell cultures. Metabolic labeling experiments enabled the direct measurement of neuronal CO production in vitro. CO production is significant, and peaked during early stages of culture. NOS activity and cGMP levels synchronously increased as cells matured. Whereas inhibition of NOS depleted cGMP in mature cultures, inhibitors of CO production potentiated the nitric oxide (NO)-mediated cGMP increase. Exogenous CO at similar concentrations to endogenous levels blocked the NO-mediated cGMP increase. These results directly demonstrate that endogenous neuronal CO production is high and indicate that while NO is the major regulator of cGMP in these neurons, CO may modulate the NO-cGMP signaling system."
https://openalex.org/W2009225669,"In pancreatic acinar cells low (physiological) agonist concentrations evoke cytosolic Ca2+ spikes specifically in the apical secretory pole that contains a high density of secretory (zymogen) granules (ZGs). Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) is believed to release Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum, but we have now tested whether the Ca2+-releasing messengers IP3 and cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPr) can liberate Ca2+ from ZGs. In experiments on single isolated ZGs, we show using confocal microscopy that IP3 and cADPr evoke a marked decrease in the free intragranular Ca2+ concentration. Using a novel high resolution method, we have measured changes in the Ca2+ concentration in the vicinity of an isolated ZG and show that IP3 and cADPr cause rapid Ca2+ release from the granule, explaining the agonist-evoked cytosolic Ca2+ rise in the secretory pole."

To determine the in vivo regulatory pattern of the Drosophila clock gene period (per), we generated transgenic strains carrying a luciferase cDNA fused to the promoter region of the per gene. This has allowed us to monitor circadian rhythms of bioluminescence from pacemaker cells within the head for several days in individual living adults. These high time-resolution experiments permitted neuronal per transcription and opens the door to vastly simplified experiments in general chronobiology and studies of temporally regulated transcription in a wide range of experimental systems."

https://openalex.org/W2127480062,"A combination of Ca2+ imaging and current clamp recording in cultured cortical neurons was used to evaluate the reliability of coupling between the action potential and rises in Ca2+ at distal release sites as a possible source of variability in CNS synaptic transmission. Local domains of enhanced Ca2+ influx were observed at varicosities on axon collaterals. Functional assay of vesicle turnover using FM1-43 and parallel electron microscopy confirmed that these varicosities were release sites. Single action potentials reliably ( > 95% of the time) resulted in a presynaptic Ca2+ transient at all presumed release sites including those on distal collaterals. Variability in the amplitude of presynaptic Ca2+ transients at individual boutons was estimated to be on average less than 20%. We conclude that the coupling of somatic action potentials to distal release sites is generally a reliable process, although nonlinearity in the relationship between Ca2+ influx and neurotransmitter release may amplify the effects of relatively small fluctuations in Ca2+ influx."

https://openalex.org/W2087931726,"Long-term depression (LTD) at the parallel fiber–Purkinje cell synapse in the cerebellum is a well-known example of synaptic plasticity. Although LTD is thought to reflect an enduring loss of postsynaptic AMPA receptor sensitivity, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) are able to modulate ionotropic receptor function and are enriched in Purkinje cells. Using intracellular recording from Purkinje cells, it is shown that two structurally and mechanistically distinct PTK inhibitors, lavendustin A and herbimycin A, block LTD induced by pairing parallel fiber stimulation with postsynaptic Ca2+ spiking. Intracellular application of the protein kinase C (PKC) activator, (−)-indolactam V, consistently depressed parallel fiber–Purkinje cell EPSPs and occluded pairing-induced LTD. Herbimycin A nullified the run-down produced by (−)-indolactam V. These data suggest that PTKs are necessary for LTD at the parallel fiber–Purkinje cell synapse and that PKC-induced synaptic depression requires PTK activity."

https://openalex.org/W2148112832,"Single, double, and triple mutations progressively shift Shaker activation to more hyperpolarized potentials, resulting in an increase in the fraction of inactivated channels at negative resting voltages. The most negatively shifted mutation, the triple mutant, behaves like an inward rectifier. What is usually considered activation of an inward rectifier is, for the triple mutant, recovery from inactivation, and what is usually considered deactivation is inactivation. This conversion from outward rectifier to inward rectifier does not rely on a difference in sign or direction of charge movement of the voltage sensor, since activation of the Shaker outward rectifier is due to a different gate than activation of the triple mutant inward rectifier. Other voltage-dependent inward rectifiers in the Shaker family may work by a similar mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2125858205,"Synaptic activity is known to modulate neuronal connectivity in the nervous system. At developing Xenopus neuromuscular synapses in culture, repetitive postsynaptic application of ACh near the synapse leads to immediate and persistent synaptic depression, which was shown to be caused by reduction of presynaptic evoked transmitter release. However, little depression was found when ACh was applied to the muscle 20 microns or further from the synapse. Fluorescence imaging of cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) showed that each ACh pulse induced a transient elevation of myocyte [Ca2+]i that spread approximately 20 microns. Local photoactivated release of Ca2+ from the caged Ca2+ chelators nitr-5 or nitrophen in the postsynaptic cell was sufficient to induce persistent synaptic depression. These results support a model in which localized Ca2+ influx into the postsynaptic myocyte initiates transsynaptic retrograde modulation of presynaptic secretion mechanisms."
