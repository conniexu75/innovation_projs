https://openalex.org/W2012614132,The accumulation of sugar alcohols and other low molecular weight metabolites such as proline and glycine-betaine is a widespread response that may protect against environmental stress that occurs in a diverse range of organisms. Transgenic tobacco plants that synthesize and accumulate the sugar alcohol mannitol were engineered by introduction of a bacterial gene that encodes mannitol 1-phosphate dehydrogenase. Growth of plants from control and mannitol-containing lines in the absence and presence of added sodium chloride was analyzed. Plants containing mannitol had an increased ability to tolerate high salinity.

Immobile taxa on hard surfaces and mobile taxa diversified. Extinction rates of ISOSS were significantly greater than in other benthos. These changes in the structure of benthic communities are attributed to increased biological disturbance of the sediment (bioturbation) by diversifying deposit feeders."
https://openalex.org/W1971855321,"Seismic data from the ultrafast-spreading (150 to 162 millimeters per year) southern East Pacific Rise show that the rise axis is underlain by a thin (less than 200 meters thick) extrusive volcanic layer (seismic layer 2A) that thickens rapidly off axis. Also beneath the rise axis is a narrow (less than 1 kilometer wide) melt sill that is in some places less than 1000 meters below the sea floor. The small dimensions of this molten body indicate that magma chamber size does not depend strongly on spreading rate as predicted by many ridge-crest thermal models. However, the shallow depth of this body is consistent with an inverse correlation between magma chamber depth and spreading rate. These observations indicate that the paradigm of ridge crest magma chambers as small, sill-like, midcrustal bodies is applicable to a wide range of intermediate- and fast-spreading ridges."

They are highly efficient tools for the synthesis of biologically active materials, such as pharmaceuticals and crop-protection chemicals, in which enantiomeric purity can be critical. The design of chiral ligands is the key to developing new enantioselective catalysts. Three unusual families of ligands have been used to develop practical technology for enantioselective hydrocyanation of olefins, ring-opening of epoxides, and hydrogenation of various compounds."
https://openalex.org/W1967415472,Natural hollandite and romanechite are widespread barium-containing manganese minerals. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy indicates that intergrowths of the two minerals occur in a coherent manner on the unit-cell level with no apparent ordering of the hollandite and romanechite. Other structures have been imaged that are based on the hollandite and romanechite structures. Electron microscopy holds a key to unraveling the myriad structural complexities of the manganese oxides.

https://openalex.org/W2085258299,"Thermohaline observations in the water column beneath the Ross Ice Shelf and along its terminal face show significant vertical stratification, active horizontal circulation, and net melting at the ice shelf base. Heat is supplied by seawater that moves southward beneath the ice shelf from a central warm core and from a western region of high salinity. The near-freezing Ice Shelf Water produced flows northward into the Ross Sea."

https://openalex.org/W2009118438,"Transient, symmetry-breaking, spatial patterns were obtained in a closed, gradient-free, aqueous medium containing chlorine dioxide, iodine, malonic acid, and starch at 4 degrees to 5 degrees C. The conditions under which these Turing-type structures appear can be accurately predicted from a simple mathematical model of the system. The patterns, which consist of spots, stripes, or both spots and stripes, require about 25 minutes to form and remain stationary for 10 to 30 minutes."
https://openalex.org/W1970898070,"Samples and observations under 420 meters of ice and 430 kilometers from the open sea on the Ross Ice Shelf at a water depth of 597 meters revealed an unusual assemblage of benthic organisms. Scavenging amphipods, an isopod, and fish were present but a living infauna was absent. The observations may be accounted for by sampling or spatial bias, or by extremely low or fluctuating trophic resources."
https://openalex.org/W2034289971,"Apatite fission-track analysis of samples that cover a 4-kilometer vertical section from the western flank of Denali (Mount McKinley), North America's highest mountain, suggests that the mountain massif was formed by rapid uplift (> 1 kilometer per million years) beginning approximately 6 million years ago (Ma). Uplift was a result of the morphology of the Denali fault and a change in motion of the Pacific plate with respect to North America at approximately 5 Ma, which created opposing tangential vectors of relative movement along the fault and forced the intervening crustal blocks upward."
https://openalex.org/W1998722064,"Baited traps and a camera lowered through the Ross Ice Shelf, Antarctica, at a point 475 kilometers from the open Ross Sea and to 597 meters below sea level revealed the presence of fish, many amphipods, and one isopod. Biological or current markings were not evident on a soft bottom littered with subangular lumps. A fish was caught through a crevasse 80 kilometers from the shelf edge."
https://openalex.org/W2076977575,"A cesium continuum that fills the channels and cavities of zeolite X has been prepared, and its structure has been determined by single-crystal x-ray crystallography. The three-dimensional continuum is cationic to balance the negative charge of the zeolite framework. Its valence electrons, only 0.3 per Cs(+) ion, are widely delocalized over 95 percent of the cesium ions in the crystal. The continuum has a unit cell formula of (Cs(122))(86+) and contains Cs(13) and Cs(14) clusters (one per supercage) arranged like the atoms in diamond, with one Cs(2) appendix (in the sodalite cavity) per cluster."
https://openalex.org/W1997373184,"Seawater samples below the Ross Ice Shelf were collected through an access hole at J9, approximately 400 kilometers from the Ross Sea, Antarctica. The 237-meter water column had sparse populations of bacteria (8.7 × 106 to 1.2 × 107 per liter), microplankters (102 to 103 per cubic meter), and zooplankters (10 to 20 per cubic meter) at the depths studied. Microbial biomass estimates from cellular adenosine 5′-triphosphate measurements were very low (10 to 150 nanograms of carbon per liter), comparable with values for the abyssal ocean. Microbial populations assimilated tritiated D-glucose, thymidine, uridine, and adenosine triphosphate at extremely low rates, comparable with deep-sea heterotrophic populations. Sediment samples had 107 to 108 bacteria per gram (dry weight), which were metabolically active as shown by respiration of uniformly labeled D-[14C]glucose. From this study it cannot be determined whether these organisms in the water column and sediments constitute a functioning food web."
https://openalex.org/W2062885544,"Sediment accumulation rate curves from 95 drilled cores from the Pacific basin and sea-level curves derived from continental margin seismic stratigraphy show that high biogenous sediment accumulation rates correspond to low eustatic sea levels for at least the last 48 million years. This relationship fits a simple model of high sea levels producing lower land/sea ratios and hence slower chemical erosion of the continents, and vice versa."
https://openalex.org/W2017868182,The tritium and carbon-14 activities of seawater samples collected from 22 to 200 meters below the ice at the Ross Ice Shelf Project ice hole are reported. The tritium results show that the waters below the ice have exchanged with Ross Sea water since the advent of nuclear testing. The carbon-14 results indicate that waters in the upper layer exchange in time periods of less than 6 years. Measurements of these isotopes in seawater under the Ross Ice Shelf in McMurdo Sound show that this water has a different history.
https://openalex.org/W1973262253,"The correlation of long-wavelength gravity anomalies in northern Eurasia with seismic velocity anomalies in the upper mantle reverses in sign between western and eastern Eurasia. The difference between western and eastern Eurasia can be explained by the presence of a low-viscosity zone in the uppermost mantle beneath eastern Eurasia that is absent to the west. The location of the lateral change in viscosity corresponds with the geologic boundary between the older shields and platforms of the Baltics, Russia, and Siberia and the younger, geologically active mountain belts of eastern Asia. This relation provides evidence that differences in the strength of the upper mantle control the locus of intracontinental deformation."
https://openalex.org/W2087334819,"The ocean tide in the southern Ross Sea is principally diurnal. The tropic tide range (double amplitude) is between 1 and 2 meters, depending on the location, and is closely related to the local water-layer thickness. The range of the tropic tide is more than three times the range of the equatorial tide. Cotidal and coamplitude charts were made for the largest diurnal constituents, K(1) and O(1) and a provisional cotidal map was made for the semidiurnal constituent M(2). The amplitudes of the diurnal tide constituents are larger in the Ross Sea than in the adjacent southern Pacific Ocean, indicating the existence of a diurnal resonance related to the shape and depth of the sea. Waves related to ocean swell propagate into the ice-covered region from the northern Ross Sea. These waves have amplitudes near 1 centimeter, and periods in the range 1 to 15 minutes. The speed at which these waves travel is successfully predicted by flexural wave theory."
https://openalex.org/W2079924918,The terrestrial ages of three Allan Hills meteorites are between 3 x 10(4) and 3 x 10(5) years and one is (1.54(-0.28)(+0.14)) x 10(6) years old. The Antarctic ice sheet is therefore older than (1.54(-0.28)(+0.14)) x 10(6) years and the meteorite accumulation process at Allan Hills probably began between 3 x 10(4) and 3 x 10(5)years ago.
https://openalex.org/W2111441930,"Two temperature profiles recorded by a sensitive bathythermograph at the Ross Ice Shelf Project site (82 degrees 22.5'S, 168 degrees 37.5'W) are presented. From the shape of the profiles it is concluded that an inflow of water at intermediate depths provides a source of heat to drive a regime in which ice is melted from the interface at a depth of 360 meters. Melting maintains the temperature of a thick layer under the ice at about -2.14 degrees C, close to the ambient freezing temperature. A very well mixed layer about 35 meters thick was found at the seabed."
https://openalex.org/W2049985039,"This technical comment questions the use of polyethylene bags to collect and store samples in a previously reported study on the effects of solar ultraviolet radiation on natural phytoplankton assemblages in Antarctic waters. A significant difference in the photosynthetic rates was noted for samples in glassware as opposed to bags, although the overall conclusions remained similar. A response by the original authors is included. 1 tab."

New images and measurements of stars, galaxies, cosmic microwaves, and mysterious gamma rays, along with an exciting nova explosion, made it a bright year for those working with existing orbiting satellites and ground-based telescopes, though uncertain funding clouds the future."
