https://openalex.org/W4206377678,"The role of human behavior to thwart transmission of infectious diseases like COVID-19 is evident. Psychological and behavioral science are key areas to understand decision-making processes underlying engagement in preventive health behaviors. Here we adapt well validated methods from behavioral economic discounting and demand frameworks to evaluate variables (e.g., delay, cost, probability) known to impact health behavior engagement. We examine the contribution of these mechanisms within a broader response class of behaviors reflecting adherence to public health recommendations made during the COVID-19 pandemic. Four crowdsourced samples (total N = 1,366) completed individual experiments probing a response class including social (physical) distancing, facemask wearing, COVID-19 testing, and COVID-19 vaccination. We also measure the extent to which choice architecture manipulations (e.g., framing, opt-in/opt-out) may promote (or discourage) behavior engagement. We find that people are more likely to socially distance when specified activities are framed as high risk, that facemask use during social interaction decreases systematically with greater social relationship, that describing delay until testing (rather than delay until results) increases testing likelihood, and that framing vaccine safety in a positive valence improves vaccine acceptance. These findings collectively emphasize the flexibility of methods from diverse areas of behavioral science for informing public health crisis management."
https://openalex.org/W4226216760,"The extracellular matrix (ECM) in skeletal muscle plays an integral role in tissue development, structural support, and force transmission. For successful adaptation to mechanical loading, remodeling processes must occur. In a large cohort of older adults, transcriptomics revealed that genes involved in ECM remodeling, including matrix metalloproteinase 14 (MMP14), were the most upregulated following 14 weeks of progressive resistance exercise training (PRT). Using single-cell RNA-seq, we identified macrophages as a source of Mmp14 in muscle following a hypertrophic exercise stimulus in mice. In vitro contractile activity in myotubes revealed that the gene encoding cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is robustly upregulated and can stimulate Mmp14 expression in macrophages. Functional experiments confirmed that modulation of this muscle cell-macrophage axis facilitated Type I collagen turnover. Finally, changes in LIF expression were significantly correlated with MMP14 expression in humans following 14 weeks of PRT. Our experiments reveal a mechanism whereby muscle fibers influence macrophage behavior to promote ECM remodeling in response to mechanical loading."
https://openalex.org/W4206549910,"In the 1930s, the Home Owners' Loan Corporation categorized neighborhoods by investment grade along racially discriminatory lines, a process known as redlining. Although other authors have found associations between Home Owners' Loan Corporation categories and current impacts on racial segregation, analysis of current health impacts rarely use these maps.To study whether historical redlining in Baltimore is associated with health impacts today.Fifty-four present-day planning board-defined community statistical areas are assigned historical Home Owners' Loan Corporation categories by area predominance. Categories are red (""hazardous""), yellow (""definitely declining"") with blue/green (""still desirable""/""best"") as the reference category. Community statistical area life expectancy is regressed against Home Owners' Loan Corporation category, controlling for median household income and proportion of African American residents.Red categorization is associated with 4.01 year reduction (95% CI: 1.47, 6.55) and yellow categorization is associated with 5.36 year reduction (95% CI: 3.02, 7.69) in community statistical area life expectancy at baseline. When controlling for median household income and proportion of African American residents, red is associated with 5.23 year reduction (95% CI: 3.49, 6.98) and yellow with 4.93 year reduction (95% CI: 3.22, 6.23). Results add support that historical redlining is associated with health today."
https://openalex.org/W4205345213,"British supermarket-panel data suggest no increases in overall sales and purchases of alcohol following COVID-19 lockdowns, yet survey and mortality data suggest otherwise. This paper attempts to unravel the paradox. Based on purchase data of 79,417 British households from Kantar Worldpanel, we undertake controlled interrupted time series analysis of the impact of COVID-19 confinement introduced on 23rd March 2020, and variably applied during 2020, compared to purchases during 2015 to 2019 as controls. We also undertook Poisson regression analyses to estimate if changes in purchases differed by household socio-demographic and economic factors. Excess off-trade household alcohol purchases (expressed as grams of ethanol) following the introduction of confinement, were 29.2% higher (95% CI = 25.8% to 32.5%) for the post-confinement months of 2020, being larger until mid-July 2020 (37.5%, 95%CI = 33.9 to 41.26%) when pubs re-opened with restrictions, and smaller (24.6%, 95%CI = 21.6 to 27.7) thereafter. During the time of complete pub closures, and fully adjusting for no on-trade purchases, household purchases of alcohol did not change when compared with the same time period during 2015-2019 (coefficient = -0.9%, 95%CI = -5.6 to 3.8). Excess purchases from 23rd March to 31st December 2020 varied by region of Great Britain, being higher in the north of England, and lower in Scotland and Wales. Excess purchases were greater in the most deprived households, compared with the least deprived households. Excess purchases increased substantially as the amount of alcohol normally purchased by a household increased, with the top one fifth of households that normally bought the most alcohol increasing their purchases more than 17 times than the bottom one fifth of households that bought the least alcohol. That the heaviest buyers of alcohol increased their purchases the most, with some independent impact of socio-economic disadvantage, might explain why reported alcohol problems and recent alcohol-related death rates might have increased. A conclusion of this is that alcohol policy to reduce high consumption of alcohol, and the availability of help and treatment to reduce alcohol consumption become more important during extraordinary times, such as COVID lockdowns."
https://openalex.org/W4206021577,"Optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) have recently become so sensitive that they are suitable for use in magnetoencephalography (MEG). These sensors solve operational problems of the current standard MEG, where superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) gradiometers and magnetometers are being used. The main advantage of OPMs is that they do not require cryogenics for cooling. Therefore, they can be placed closer to the scalp and are much easier to use. Here, we measured auditory evoked fields (AEFs) with both SQUID- and OPM-based MEG systems for a group of subjects to better understand the usage of a limited sensor count OPM-MEG. We present a theoretical framework that transforms the within subject data and equivalent simulation data from one MEG system to the other. This approach works on the principle of solving the inverse problem with one system, and then using the forward model to calculate the magnetic fields expected for the other system. For the source reconstruction, we used a minimum norm estimate (MNE) of the current distribution. Two different volume conductor models were compared: the homogeneous conducting sphere and the three-shell model of the head. The transformation results are characterized by a relative error and cross-correlation between the measured and the estimated magnetic field maps of the AEFs. The results for both models are encouraging. Since some commercial OPMs measure multiple components of the magnetic field simultaneously, we additionally analyzed the effect of tangential field components. Overall, our dual-axis OPM-MEG with 15 sensors yields similar information to a 62-channel SQUID-MEG with its field of view restricted to the right hemisphere."

The present study aimed to provide a comprehensive analysis of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the brain (MDA-MB-231 BrM2) and lung (MDA-MB-231 LM2) metastatic cell lines obtained from breast cancer patients compared with those who have primary breast cancer. We identified 981 and 662 DEGs for brain and lung metastasis, respectively. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis revealed seven shared ( PLCB1 , FPR1 , FPR2 , CX3CL1 , GABBR2 , GPR37 , and CXCR4) hub genes between brain and lung metastasis in breast cancer. Moreover, GNG2 and CXCL8 , C3 , and PTPN6 in the brain and SAA1 and CCR5 in lung metastasis were found as unique hub genes. Besides, five co-regulation of clusters via seven important co-expression genes (COL1A2, LUM, SPARC, THBS2, IL1B, CXCL8, THY1) were identified in the brain PPI network. Clusters screening followed by biological process (BP) function and pathway enrichment analysis for both metastatic cell lines showed that complement receptor signalling, acetylcholine receptor signalling, and gastric acid secretion pathways were common between these metastases, whereas other pathways were site-specific. According to our findings, there are a set of genes and functional pathways that mark and mediate breast cancer metastasis to the brain and lungs, which may enable us understand the molecular basis of breast cancer development in a deeper levele to the brain and lungs, which may help us gain a more complete understanding of the molecular underpinnings of breast cancer development."
https://openalex.org/W4206197811,"It is necessary to identify factors that influence nurses' intention to care for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients to improve the quality of care during the pandemic. This study identifies factors that influence nurses' intention to care for COVID-19 patients, focusing on positive psychological capital and nursing professionalism.This study adopted a descriptive correlational design. Data were collected between August 16 and August 30, 2020, through self-administered questionnaires from 148 bedside nurses caring for COVID-19 patients, from four hospitals designated for COVID-19 treatment. Modified versions of the Nursing Intention Questionnaire for SARS Patient Care, Psychological Capital Questionnaire, and Hall's Professional Inventory were used. The collected data were analyzed using stepwise multiple regression.In total, 165 questionnaires were distributed, and 148 questionnaires (89.7%) were included in the final analysis. Factors influencing nurses' intention to care were: age (30<: β = .18, p = .026; ≥50: β = .23, p = .005), department (ICU: β = -.26, p = .001), sufficient clinical experience and skills to care for COVID-19 patients (sufficient: β = .18, p = .019), and positive psychological capital (β = .22, p = .044). The model's explanatory power (R2) was 48%.Strategies to increase nurses' positive psychological capital are necessary to improve nursing care quality by increasing intention to care when facing novel infectious diseases such as COVID-19. Furthermore, adequate education and training on managing novel infectious diseases should be implemented to provide nurses with relevant experience and skills regarding caring for patients infected with these diseases. Through various studies, strategies for improving nurses' positive psychological capital need to be suggested to improve the quality of care by increasing the nurses' intention to care during the emergence of a novel infectious disease, such as COVID-19. Additionally, adequate education and training on managing the novel infectious diseases, sufficient for the nurses to believe they have the experience and skills for caring for the infected patients, will be needed."
https://openalex.org/W4206468458,"COVID-19 has placed unprecedented pressure on dementia health and social care systems worldwide. This has resulted in reduced services and support for people with dementia and their family carers. There are gaps in the evidence on the impact of the pandemic on Quality of Life (QoL). We carried out a study on the impact of the pandemic on the QoL of a group of people with dementia and their family carers who were part of a larger existing cohort study.We quantitatively measured QoL, on two occasions during the two national lockdowns in 2020 and compared these data with those obtained when they entered the study (before the pandemic). Measures used included: DEMQOL-Proxy, Clinical Dementia Rating Scale and C-DEMQOL. To understand how QoL changed over time, a repeated measures ANOVA was run for each dependent variable with the following variables entered as co-variates: duration in study, baseline dementia severity, gender of the family carer, gender of the person with dementia, family carer relationship, dementia type, living status, age of the person with dementia, and age of the family carer.248 participants took part in the study. QoL scores did not significantly decline between either time period for the person with dementia or their family carer. There was variation in subgroups; with co-resident status, carer relationship, gender of the person with dementia, age of the person with dementia, and baseline cognitive status influencing QoL outcomes in family carers.It is striking that people with dementia and their carers did not report a decline in QoL during the pandemic or in the months following restrictions suggesting the possibility of resilience. Variation in subgroups suggests that specific groups of family carers were more vulnerable to lower QoL; indicating the need for more tailored, nuanced support during this period."
https://openalex.org/W4205282697,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized by the loss of kidney function. The molecular mechanisms underlying the development and progression of CKD are still not fully understood. Among others, the urinary peptidome has been extensively studied, with several urinary peptides effectively detecting disease progression. However, their link to proteolytic events has not been made yet. This study aimed to predict the proteases involved in the generation of CKD-associated urinary excreted peptides in a well-matched (for age, sex, lack of heart disease) case-control study. The urinary peptide profiles from CKD (n = 241) and controls (n = 240) were compared and statistically analyzed. The in-silico analysis of the involved proteases was performed using Proteasix and proteases activity was predicted based on the abundance changes of the associated peptides. Predictions were cross-correlated to transcriptomics datasets by using the Nephroseq database. Information on the respective protease inhibitors was also retrieved from the MEROPS database. Totally, 303 urinary peptides were significantly associated with CKD. Among the most frequently observed were fragments of collagen types I, II and III, uromodulin, albumin and beta-2-microglobulin. Proteasix predicted 16 proteases involved in their generation. Through investigating CKD-associated transcriptomics datasets, several proteases are highlighted including members of matrix metalloproteinases ( MMP7 , MMP14 ) and serine proteases ( PCSK5 ); laying the foundation for further studies towards elucidating their role in CKD pathophysiology."
https://openalex.org/W4205774956,"Several studies in different countries have reported that part of the population does not fully comply with the measures recommended to prevent COVID-19, and therefore poses a risk to public health. For this reason, several measures have been developed to assess the level of compliance, although many of them have methodological limitations or do not include a comprehensive set of items. The main goal of the current study was to develop a new instrument with suitable psychometric properties, which includes a more complete set of items and controls the impact of acquiescence bias. The participants were 1410 individuals (59.2% women) from Spain, who answered the new questionnaire and several items on sociodemographic and attitudinal issues. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were carried out, and the results suggested that only one content factor was underlying the data. This solution was replicated in a different subsample, which shows the stability of the solution. Furthermore, the relationships between the scores of the new questionnaire and the sociodemographic and attitudinal variables are similar to those obtained in previous studies, which can be regarded as evidence of the validity of the new questionnaire."
https://openalex.org/W4206556020,"This study was carried out with the objective of determining the antioxidant properties and quantification of total phenolics and flavonoids in relation to quercetin and rutin in some of the monofloral honeys produced in Minas Gerais (Brazil). In this study, 15 monofloral honey samples were obtained from different geographic regions of Minas Gerias, Brazil. The honeys were obtained from Cooperative of Beekeepers and Family Farmers of Northern Minas. To determine the antioxidant properties of honey samples, the test methods of total phenolic content, flavonoids (rutin and quercetin) and DPPH were used. As a result of the analysis of phenolic and flavonoid contents, the samples with the best results were A1-Aroeira and A4-Assa peixe. In antioxidant activity, the honey with the best EC50 results was A6-Aroeira. Differences between the antioxidant activities of the honey samples were found significantly (p< 0.01)."
https://openalex.org/W4205254421,"The objective of this study was to conduct a reliability analysis on photovoltaic (PV) modules from the oldest PV installation site in Pakistan. Four sets of modules; Type A & B (30 years old), Type C (10 years old), and Type D (35 years old) were identified for this analysis. It has been observed that modules have shown degradation after working for a good number of years in the field. Comparing with nameplate data (available for Type B & C only), a drop of 28.68% and 2.99 percentage points (pp) was observed in the output power (Pmax) and efficiency (Eff.) respectively for Type B, while a drop of 22.21% and 4.05 pp was observed in Pmax and Eff. respectively for Type C. A greater drop in ISC and Pmax was observed in Type B, which is attributed to severe browning of EVA in them. While the greater drop in Pmax, in case of Type C, is attributed to the poor quality of materials used. Amongst the different defects observed, the junction box defects which include cracking and embrittlement, etc., and backsheet defects which include discoloration, delamination and cracking, etc. were found in all four types of modules. Other defects include browning of EVA, observed in Type B and D, and corrosion of frame and electrical wires, found in Type A, B, and D. This first-ever study will provide valuable information in understanding the degradation mechanism and henceforth, improving the long term reliability of PV modules in the humid-subtropical conditions of Pakistan."
https://openalex.org/W4206466317,"Aiming at the problems of low segmentation accuracy and inaccurate object boundary segmentation in current semantic segmentation algorithms, a semantic segmentation algorithm using multiple loss function constraints and multi-level cascading residual structure is proposed. The multi-layer cascaded residual unit was used to increase the range of the network layer receptive field. A parallel network was constructed to extract different depth feature information, then different depth feature information and encoder output features are fused to obtain multiple outputs feature which build multiple losses with the label, thereby constraining the model to optimize the network. The proposed network was evaluated on Cityscapes and CamVid datasets. The experimental results show that the mean Intersection over Union ratio (MIoU) of the proposed algorithm is 3.07% and 3.59% higher than the original Deeplabv3+ algorithm, respectively."

Expressions for bias and mean square error up to first order of approximation, are derived. Impact of measurement errors is examined using real data sets, including the survey conducted at Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad. Simulated data sets are also used to observe the performance of the proposed estimators in comparison to some other estimators. We obtain the empirical bias and MSE values for the proposed and the competing estimators."
https://openalex.org/W4205612209,"Cell viability, an essential measurement for cell therapy products, lacks traceability. One of the most common cell viability tests is trypan blue dye exclusion where blue-stained cells are counted via brightfield imaging. Typically, live and dead cells are classified based on their pixel intensities which may vary arbitrarily making it difficult to compare results. Herein, a traceable absorbance microscopy method to determine the intracellular uptake of trypan blue is demonstrated. The intensity pixels of the brightfield images are converted to absorbance images which are used to calculate moles of trypan blue per cell. Trypan blue cell viability measurements, where trypan blue content in each cell is quantified, enable traceable live-dead classifications. To implement the absorbance microscopy method, we developed an open-source AbsorbanceQ application that generates quantitative absorbance images. The validation of absorbance microscopy is demonstrated using neutral density filters. Results from four different microscopes demonstrate a mean absolute deviation of 3% from the expected optical density values. When assessing trypan blue-stained Jurkat cells, the difference in intracellular uptake of trypan blue in heat-shock-killed cells using two different microscopes is 3.8%. Cells killed with formaldehyde take up ~50% less trypan blue as compared to the heat-shock-killed cells, suggesting that the killing mechanism affects trypan blue uptake. In a test mixture of approximately 50% live and 50% dead cells, 53% of cells were identified as dead (±6% standard deviation). Finally, to mimic batches of low-viability cells that may be encountered during a cell manufacturing process, viability was assessed for cells that were 1) overgrown in the cell culture incubator for five days or 2) incubated in DPBS at room temperature for five days. Instead of making live-dead classifications using arbitrary intensity values, absorbance imaging yields traceable units of moles that can be compared, which is useful for assuring quality for biomanufacturing processes."
https://openalex.org/W4206466205,"Voluntary attentional control is the ability to selectively focus on a subset of visual information in the presence of other competing stimuli-a marker of cognitive control enabling flexible, goal-driven behavior. To test its robustness, we contrasted attentional control with the most common source of attentional orienting in daily life: attention shifts prior to goal-directed eye and hand movements. In a multi-tasking paradigm, human participants attended at a location while planning eye or hand movements elsewhere. Voluntary attentional control suffered with every simultaneous action plan, even under reduced task difficulty and memory load-factors known to interfere with attentional control. Furthermore, the performance cost was limited to voluntary attention: We observed simultaneous attention benefits at two movement targets without attentional competition between them. This demonstrates that the visual system allows for the concurrent representation of multiple attentional foci. Since attentional control is extremely fragile and dominated by premotor attention shifts, we propose that action-driven selection plays the superordinate role for visual selection."
https://openalex.org/W4206957188,"Frailty is an established risk factor for adverse outcomes following non-cardiac surgery. The Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) is a recently described frailty assessment tool that harnesses administrative data and is composed of 109 International Classification of Disease variables. We aimed to examine the incremental prognostic utility of the HFRS in a generalizable surgical population. Using linked administrative databases, a retrospective cohort of patients admitted for non-cardiac surgery between October 1st, 2008 and September 30th, 2019 in Alberta, Canada was created. Our primary outcome was a composite of death, myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest at 30-days. Multivariable logistic regression was undertaken to assess the impact of HFRS on outcomes after adjusting for age, sex, components of the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) and peri-operative biomarkers. The final cohort consisted of 712,808 non-cardiac surgeries, of which 55·1% were female and the average age was 53·4 +/- 22·4 years. Using the HFRS, 86.3% were considered low risk, 10·7% were considered intermediate risk and 3·1% were considered high risk for frailty. Intermediate and high HFRS scores were associated with increased risk of the primary outcome with an adjusted odds ratio of 1·61 (95% CI 1·50-1.74) and 1·55 (95% CI 1·38-1·73). Intermediate and high HFRS were also associated with increased adjusted odds of prolonged hospital stay, in-hospital mortality, and 1-year mortality. The HFRS is a minimally onerous frailty assessment tool that can complement perioperative risk stratification in identifying patients at high risk of short- and long-term adverse events."
https://openalex.org/W4207060520,"Both social causation and health-related selection may influence educational gradients in alcohol use in adolescence and young adulthood. The social causation theory implies that the social environment (e.g. at school) influences adolescents' drinking behaviour. Conversely, the health-related selection hypothesis posits that alcohol use (along other health-related characteristics) predicts lower educational attainment. From past studies it is unclear which of these mechanisms predominates, as drinking may be both a cause and consequence of low educational attainment. Furthermore, educational gradients in alcohol use may reflect the impact of 'third variables' already present in childhood, such as parental socioeconomic status (SES), effortful control, and IQ. We investigated social causation and health-related selection in the development of educational gradients in alcohol use from adolescence to young adulthood in a selective educational system. We used data from a Dutch population-based cohort (TRAILS Study; n = 2,229), including measurements of educational level and drinking at ages around 14, 16, 19, 22, and 26 years (waves 2 to 6). First, we evaluated the directionality in longitudinal associations between education and drinking with cross-lagged panel models, with and without adjusting for pre-existing individual differences using fixed effects. Second, we assessed the role of childhood characteristics around age 11 (wave 1), i.e. IQ, effortful control, and parental SES, both as confounders in these associations, and as predictors of educational level and drinking around age 14 (wave 2). In fixed effects models, lower education around age 14 predicted increases in drinking around 16. From age 19 onward, we found a tendency towards opposite associations, with higher education predicting increases in alcohol use. Alcohol use was not associated with subsequent changes in education. Childhood characteristics strongly predicted education around age 14 and, to a lesser extent, early drinking. We mainly found evidence for the social causation theory in early adolescence, when lower education predicted increases in subsequent alcohol use. We found no evidence in support of the health-related selection hypothesis with respect to alcohol use. By determining initial educational level, childhood characteristics also predict subsequent trajectories in alcohol use."
https://openalex.org/W4205278735,"An automatic non-contact cough detector designed especially for night audio recordings that can distinguish coughs from snores and other sounds is presented. Two different classifiers were implemented and tested: a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and a Deep Neural Network (DNN). The detected coughs were analyzed and compared in different sleep stages and in terms of severity of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), along with age, Body Mass Index (BMI), and gender. The database was composed of nocturnal audio signals from 89 subjects recorded during a polysomnography study. The DNN-based system outperformed the GMM-based system, at 99.8% accuracy, with a sensitivity and specificity of 86.1% and 99.9%, respectively (Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of 78.4%). Cough events were significantly more frequent during wakefulness than in the sleep stages (p < 0.0001) and were significantly less frequent during deep sleep than in other sleep stages (p < 0.0001). A positive correlation was found between BMI and the number of nocturnal coughs (R = 0.232, p < 0.05), and between the number of nocturnal coughs and OSA severity in men (R = 0.278, p < 0.05). This non-contact cough detection system may thus be implemented to track the progression of respiratory illnesses and test reactions to different medications even at night when a contact sensor is uncomfortable or infeasible."
https://openalex.org/W4205381752,"The problems of acid mine drainage (AMD) in coal mine acidic wastewaters arise from a range of sources, including severe pollution with heavy metals and SO 4 2- and difficulties during treatment. Based on the ability of Maifan stone to adsorb heavy metals and the dissimilatory reduction of SO 4 2- by sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), Maifan stone-sulfate-reducing bacterium-immobilized particles were prepared via immobilization techniques using Shandong Maifan stone as the experimental material. The effects of Maifan stones containing SRB on mitigating AMD were investigated by constructing Dynamic Column 1 with Maifan stone-sulfate-reducing bacterium-immobilized particles and by constructing Dynamic Column 2 with SRB mixed with Maifan stones. By the use of adsorption isotherms, adsorption kinetics, a reduction kinetics model and X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies, the mechanism by which Maifan stone-sulfate-reducing bacterium-immobilized particles mitigate AMD was revealed. The results showed that the total effect of Maifan stone-sulfate-reducing bacterium-immobilized particles on AMD was better than that of biological Maifan stone carriers. The highest rates for the removal of Fe 2+ , Mn 2+ , and SO 4 2- in AMD were 90.51%, 85.75% and 93.61%, respectively, and the pH value of the wastewater increased from 4.08 to 7.64. The isotherms for the adsorption of Fe 2+ and Mn 2+ on Maifan stone-sulfate-reducing bacterium-immobilized particles conformed to the output of the Langmuir model. The adsorption kinetics were in accordance with Lagergren first-order kinetics, and the kinetics for the reduction of SO 4 2- conformed to those of a first-order reaction model."
https://openalex.org/W4205486727,"Lymphatic filariasis (LF) affects more than 120 million people globally. In Tanzania, nearly six million people are estimated to live with clinical manifestations of the disease. The National LF control program was established in 2000 using Mass drug administration (MDA) of Ivermectin and Albendazole to individuals aged 5years and above. This study assessed the infection status in individuals aged 15 years and above who are eligible for participation in MDA. The level of compliance to MDA and the reasons for non-compliance to MDA were also assessed.A community based cross-sectional study was conducted in two villages of Masasi District. A total of 590 participants aged 15 years and above were screened for the circulating filarial antigen (CFA) using the rapid diagnostic test. Night blood samples from CFA positive individuals were further analyzed for detection and quantification of Wuchereria bancrofti microfilaria (Mf) using the counting chamber technique. A pre-tested questionnaire was administered to collect information on compliance to MDA and the factors affecting continued transmission. Data were analyzed using SPSS Version 20. Chi-square test was used to compare the prevalence of CFA by gender and village where a P-value ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant.Out of 590 participants, 30 (5.1%) were positive for CFA and one (0.2%) was found positive for microfilaria of Wuchereria bancrofti. Compliance during the last round of MDA, in the year 2019 was 56% which is below the minimum coverage recommended by WHO. Absence from home during MDA and perceptions of being free from hydrocele or elephantiasis were the major reasons for non-compliance.There is a significant decline in LF transmission in Masasi District after seven rounds of MDA. However, the presence of individuals who are persistently non-compliant may delay elimination of LF in the District."
https://openalex.org/W4205814616,"Currently, peripheral tissue distribution of cannabinoids after treatment is poorly understood. This pilot study sought to examine the early tissue distribution of major cannabinoids 30 minutes following an intraperitoneal injection of vehicle (1:9 Tween 80/SAL), and doses of THC (1 mg/kg) and CBD (5 mg/kg) that are feasible for human consumption in serum, adipose, brain, lung, liver, jejunum, and muscle of male Sprague-Dawley rats. The jejunum and adipose were most enriched in THC. Similarly, CBD was enriched in the jejunum and adipose but also the liver. In contrast, the brain had the lowest concentration of cannabinoids relative to other tissues. The liver had the greatest concentration of the THC metabolites, 11-OH-THC and COOH-THC, compared to all other tissues. Overall, these findings highlight broad tissue distribution and marked differences in tissue concentration not previously appreciated. Thus, as cannabinoid research continues to rapidly grow, consideration of the potential bioactive effects of these molecules in peripheral tissues is warranted in future studies."
https://openalex.org/W4206265115,"This study investigated temporal trends in the epidemiology of primary myopia and associations with key environmental risk factors in a UK population. Data were collected at recruitment (non-cycloplegic autorefraction, year of birth, sex, ethnicity, highest educational attainment, reason and age of first wearing glasses and history of eye disease) from 107,442 UK Biobank study participants aged 40 to 69 years, born between 1939 and 1970. Myopia was defined as mean spherical equivalent (MSE) ≤-1 dioptre (D). Temporal changes in myopia frequency by birth cohort (5-year bands using date of birth) and associations with environmental factors were analysed, distinguishing both type (childhood-onset, <18 years versus adult-onset) and severity (three categories: low -1.00 to -2.99D, moderate -3.00 to -5.99D or high ≥-6.00D). Overall myopia frequency increased from 20.0% in the oldest cohort (births 1939-1944) to 29.2% in the youngest (1965-1970), reflecting a relatively higher increase in frequency of adult-onset and low myopia. Childhood-onset myopia peaked in participants born in 1950-54, adult-onset myopia peaked in the cohort born a decade later. The distribution of MSE only shifted for childhood-onset myopia (median: -3.8 [IQR -2.4, -5.4] to -4.4 [IQR -3.0, -6.2]). The magnitude of the association between higher educational attainment (proxy for educational intensity) and myopia overall increased over time (adjusted Odds Ratio (OR) 2.7 [2.5, 2.9] in the oldest versus 4.2 [3.3, 5.2] in the youngest cohort), being substantially greater for childhood-onset myopia (OR 3.3 [2.8, 4.0] to 8.0 [4.2, 13]). Without delineating childhood-onset from adult-onset myopia, important temporal trends would have been obscured. The differential impact of educational experience/intensity on both childhood-onset and high myopia, amplified over time, suggests a cohort effect in gene-environment interaction with potential for increasing myopia frequency if increasing childhood educational intensity is unchecked. However, historical plateauing of myopia frequency does suggest some potential for effective intervention."
https://openalex.org/W4206463653,"The prevalence of overweight and obesity is greatest amongst Black women in the U.S., contributing to disproportionately higher type 2 diabetes prevalence compared to White women. Insulin resistance, independent of body mass index, tends to be greater in Black compared to White women, yet the mechanisms to explain these differences are not completely understood. The gut microbiome is implicated in the pathophysiology of obesity, insulin resistance and cardiometabolic disease. Only two studies have examined race differences in Black and White women, however none characterizing the gut microbiome based on insulin sensitivity by race and sex. Our objective was to determine if gut microbiome profiles differ between Black and White women and if so, determine if these race differences persisted when accounting for insulin sensitivity status. In a pilot cross-sectional analysis, we measured the relative abundance of bacteria in fecal samples collected from a subset of 168 Black ( n = 94) and White ( n = 74) women of the National Growth and Health Study (NGHS). We conducted analyses by self-identified race and by race plus insulin sensitivity status (e.g. insulin sensitive versus insulin resistant as determined by HOMA-IR). A greater proportion of Black women were classified as IR (50%) compared to White women (30%). Alpha diversity did not differ by race nor by race and insulin sensitivity status. Beta diversity at the family level was significantly different by race (p = 0.033) and by the combination of race plus insulin sensitivity (p = 0.038). Black women, regardless of insulin sensitivity, had a greater relative abundance of the phylum Actinobacteria (p = 0.003), compared to White women. There was an interaction between race and insulin sensitivity for Verrucomicrobia (p = 0.008), where among those with insulin resistance, Black women had four fold higher abundance than White women. At the family level, we observed significant interactions between race and insulin sensitivity for Lachnospiraceae (p = 0.007) and Clostridiales Family XIII (p = 0.01). Our findings suggest that the gut microbiome, particularly lower beta diversity and greater Actinobacteria , one of the most abundant species, may play an important role in driving cardiometabolic health disparities of Black women, indicating an influence of social and environmental factors on the gut microbiome."
https://openalex.org/W4225471984,"Larval insects use many methods for locomotion. Here we describe a previously unknown jumping behavior in a group of beetle larvae (Coleoptera: Laemophloeidae). We analyze and describe this behavior in Laemophloeus biguttatus and provide information on similar observations for another laemophloeid species, Placonotus testaceus. Laemophloeus biguttatus larvae precede jumps by arching their body while gripping the substrate with their legs over a period of 0.22 ± 0.17s. This is followed by a rapid ventral curling of the body after the larvae releases its grip that launches them into the air. Larvae reached takeoff velocities of 0.47 ± 0.15 m s-1 and traveled 11.2 ± 2.8 mm (1.98 ± 0.8 body lengths) horizontally and 7.9 ± 4.3 mm (1.5 ± 0.9 body lengths) vertically during their jumps. Conservative estimates of power output revealed that some but not all jumps can be explained by direct muscle power alone, suggesting Laemophloeus biguttatus may use a latch-mediated spring actuation mechanism (LaMSA) in which interaction between the larvae's legs and the substrate serves as the latch. MicroCT scans and SEM imaging of larvae did not reveal any notable modifications that would aid in jumping. Although more in-depth experiments could not be performed to test hypotheses on the function of these jumps, we posit that this behavior is used for rapid locomotion which is energetically more efficient than crawling the same distance to disperse from their ephemeral habitat. We also summarize and discuss jumping behaviors among insect larvae for additional context of this behavior in laemophloeid beetles."
https://openalex.org/W3131188869,"During the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered the release of individuals incarcerated in New York City jails who were at high risk of contracting the disease and at low risk of committing criminal reoffense. Using public information, we construct and analyze a database of nearly 350,000 incarceration episodes in the city jail system from 2014-2020, paying special attention to what happened during the week of March 23-29, 2020, immediately following the mayor's order. In concordance with de Blasio's stated policy, we find that being discharged during this focus week is associated with a lower probability of readmission as compared to being discharged during the same calendar week in previous years. Furthermore, comparing the individuals discharged during the focus week of 2020 to those discharged during the same calendar week in previous years, we find that the former group was, on average, slightly older than the latter group, although the difference is not large. Additionally, the individuals in the former group had spent substantially longer in jail than those in the latter group. With the release of long-serving individuals demonstrated to be feasible, we also examine how the jail population would have looked over the past six years had caps in incarceration been in place. With a cap of one year, the system would experience a 15% decrease in incarceration. With a cap of 100 days, the reduction would be over 50%. Because our results are only as accurate as New York City's public-facing jail data, we discuss numerous challenges with this data and suggest improvements related to the incarcerated individual's age, gender, race, and more. Finally, we discuss the policy implications of our work, highlight some opportunities and challenges posed by incarceration caps, and suggest key areas for reform. One such reform might involve identifying and discharging low-risk individuals sooner in general, which might be feasible given the de Blasio administration's actions during the early stages of COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W4205751758,"Upside-down jellyfish (Cassiopea sp.) are mostly sedentary, benthic jellyfish that have invaded estuarine ecosystems around the world. Monitoring the spread of this invasive jellyfish must contend with high spatial and temporal variability in abundance of individuals, especially around their invasion front. Here, we evaluated the utility of drones to survey invasive Cassiopea in a coastal lake on the east coast of Australia. To assess the efficacy of a drone-based methodology, we compared the densities and counts of Cassiopea from drone observations to conventional boat-based observations and evaluated cost and time efficiency of these methods. We showed that there was no significant difference in Cassiopea density measured by drones compared to boat-based methods along the same transects. However, abundance estimates of Cassiopea derived from scaling-up transect densities were over-inflated by 319% for drones and 178% for boats, compared to drone-based counts of the whole site. Although conventional boat-based survey techniques were cost-efficient in the short-term, we recommend doing whole-of-site counts using drones. This is because it provides a time-saving and precise technique for long-term monitoring of the spatio-temporally dynamic invasion front of Cassiopea in coastal lakes and other sheltered marine habitats with relatively clear water."
https://openalex.org/W4205842863,"Objective We investigated prevalence and predictors of glucose metabolism disorders (GMDs) among People Living with HIV (PLWH) on efavirenz- and atazanavir/ritonavir-based combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Methods This cross-sectional study involved adult PLWH on efavirenz- (n = 240) and atazanavir/ritonavir-based (n = 111) cART. The prevalence of GMDs was determined by fasting serum glucose, insulin, and homeostasis model assessment. A logistic regression model was used to determine predictors. Results The overall prevalence of GMDs for all regimens was 27.6% (97/351) [95% CI 23.0–32.6%] s, with 31.1% (75/240) [95% CI 25.4–37.5%] for efavirenz-based and 19.8% (22/111) [95% CI 12.9–28.5%)] for atazanavir/ritonavir-based cART group. The prevalence of impaired fasting glycemia was significantly higher (p = 0.026) in the efavirenz- [(15.4%) (37/240); 95%CI (11.1–20.6%)] than atazanavir/ritonavir-based [(7.2%) (8/111), (95%CI (3.2–13.7%)] cART. However, no significant difference was observed in the prevalence of diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance between the two regimens. Age ≥46 years old and specific type of ARV contained in cART, such as TDF, were independent predictors of GMD in both groups. Whereas the male gender and BMI category were predictors of GMDs among EFV-based cART group, AZT- and ABC- containing regimens and triglyceride levels were predictors in the ATV/r-based group. Conclusions GMDs were highly prevalent among adults on EFV- than ATV/r-based cARTs. Age ≥46 years and TDF-containing cARTs are common predictors in both regimens. Close monitoring for impaired fasting glucose during long-term EFV-based cART is recommended for early diagnosis of type-2 diabetes and management."
https://openalex.org/W4206005633,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become a popular wildlife survey tool. Most research has focused on detecting wildlife using UAVs with less known about behavioral responses. We compared the behavioral responses of breeding blue-winged teal (Spatula discors) (n = 151) and northern shovelers (Spatula clypeata) (n = 46) on wetlands flown over with a rotary DJI Matrice 200 quadcopter and control wetlands without flights. Using a GoPro camera affixed to a spotting scope, we conducted focal individual surveys and recorded duck behaviors for 30 minutes before, during, and 30 minutes after UAV flights to determine if ducks flushed or changed in specific activities. We also conducted scan surveys during flights to examine flushing and movement on the entire wetland. Between 24 April and 27 May 2020, we conducted 42 paired (control and flown) surveys. Both teal and shovelers increased proportion of time engaged in overhead vigilance on flown wetlands from pre-flight to during flight (0.008 to 0.020 and 0.006 to 0.032 of observation time, respectively). Both species left the wetland more frequently during flights than ducks on control wetlands. Despite similarities between species, we observed marked differences in time each species spent on active (e.g., feeding, courtship, swimming), resting, and vigilant behaviors during flights. Overall, teal became less active during flights (0.897 to 0.834 of time) while shovelers became more active during this period (0.724 to 0.906 of time). Based upon scan surveys, ducks flushed in 38.1% of surveys while control wetlands only had a single (2.4%) flush during the flight time. We found launch distance was the most important predictor of whether ducks swam for cover or away from the UAV which could result in inaccurate counts. Ducks appear aware of UAVs during flights, but minimal behavioral shifts suggest negative fitness consequences are unlikely."

This study was carried out with data from the Brazilian health system and had as metrics incidence of breast cancer, total and standardized rate hospitalizations by breast cancer, hospitalization and ambulatory costs by breast cancer and prevalence of physical inactivity. The Population Attributable Fraction (PAF) calculation was used. The total hospitalization cost by breast cancer in women aged ≥ 20 years in Brazil from 2015 to 2017 was US$ 33,484,920.54. Of this total, US$ 182,736.76 was due to physical inactivity. Outpatient expenses related to breast cancer in the Brazilian female population from 2015 to 2017 was US$ 207,993,744.39. Of this total, US$ 1,178,841.86 was due to physical inactivity. Outpatient and hospitalization expenses were higher in the states of Southeastern, Southern and Northeastern regions. Physical inactivity has contributed to the high number of hospitalizations for breast cancer in Brazil, which resulted in economic burden for health services (inpatient and outpatient) of more than US$ 1,300,000.00 from 2015 to 2017."
https://openalex.org/W4206573640,"The genus Ardisia (Myrsinoideae, Primulaceae) has 16 subgenera and over 700 accepted names, mainly distributed in tropical Asia and America. The circumscription of Ardisia is not well-defined and sometimes confounded with the separation of some small genera. A taxonomic revision focusing on Ardisia and allies is necessary. In the Ardisia subgenus Crispardisia, symbiotic association with leaf-nodule bacteria is a unique character within the genus. The endosymbionts are vertically transmitted, highly specific and highly dependent on the hosts, suggesting strict cospeciation may have occurred in the evolutionary history. In the present study, we aimed to establish a phylogenetic framework for further taxonomic revision. We also aimed to test the cospeciation hypothesis of the leaf-nodulate Ardisia and their endosymbiotic bacteria. Nuclear ITS and two chloroplast intergenic spaces were used to reconstruct the phylogeny of Asian Ardisia and relatives in Myrsinoideae, Primulaceae. The 16S-23S rRNA were used to reconstruct the bacterial symbionts' phylogeny. To understand the evolutionary association of the Ardisia and symbionts, topology tests and cophylogenetic analyses were conducted. The molecular phylogeny suggested Ardisia is not monophyletic, unless Sardiria, Hymenandra, Badula and Oncostemum are included. The results suggest the generic limit within Myrsinoideae (Primulaceae) needs to be further revised. The subgenera Crispardisia, Pimelandra, and Stylardisia were supported as monophyly, while the subgenus Bladhia was separated into two distant clades. We proposed to divide the subgenus Bladhia into subgenus Bladhia s.str. and subgenus Odontophylla. Both of the cophylogenetic analyses and topology tests rejected strict cospeciation hypothesis between Ardisia hosts and symbiotic Burkholderia. Cophylogenetic analyses showed general phylogenetic concordance of Ardisia and Burkholderia, and cospeciation events, host-switching events and loss events were all inferred."

The present study examines the relationship between economic growth, poverty, inequality, remittances, and foreign aid in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries using panel data methods from 1991 to 2019. The study focuses on the MENA region due to the rise in labor immigration and significant foreign aid. The empirical findings reveal that remittances, foreign aid, and economic growth play a significant role in bringing down the MENA region’s poverty levels. Besides, a rise in income share accruing to the lowest quintile is observed despite the negative income growth, which indicates that on average, the income increased more rapidly of the poor in comparison to the non-poor households. Thus, the study finds evidence supporting the hypothesis that remittances and foreign aid augment per capita income and income share in the MENA member countries."
https://openalex.org/W4226237000,"There is growing interest in the role that morphological knowledge plays in literacy acquisition, but there is no research directly comparing the efficacy of different forms of morphological instruction. Here we compare two methods of teaching English morphology in the context of a memory experiment when words were organized by affix during study (e.g., a list of words was presented that all share an affix, such as <doing>, <going>, <talking>, <walking>, etc.) or by base during study (e.g., a list of words was presented that all share a base, such as <doing>, <done>, <redo>, <undo>). We show that memory for morphologically complex words is better in both conditions compared to a control condition that does not highlight the morphological composition of words, and most importantly, show that studying words in a base-centric format improves memory further still. We argue that the morphological matrix that organizes words around a common base may provide an important new tool for literacy instruction."
https://openalex.org/W4205232379,"The interaction between plant, soil and microorganism plays a crucial role in sustainable development of terrestrial ecosystem function and diversity. However, little information is known about how plant growth, soil organic carbon (C) fractions and microorganism respond to exogenous C addition in soils with low organic C content. Three levels of 13C-glucose (equal to 0, 100% and 500% of initial microbial biomass C) were added to non-sterilized (corresponding to treatment abbreviation of CK, Glu-1, Glu-2, respectively) and sterilized soils (corresponding to treatment abbreviation of SS, SS+Glu-1, SS+Glu-2, respectively) planted with apple rootstock (Malus baccata (L.) Borkh.) seedings. The objectives of this study were to analyse the dynamics of soil organic C (SOC) fractions and soil bacterial community diversity with glucose levels and soil sterilization, and to explore the morphology of roots and nitrogen (N) metabolism by plant after glucose addition to sterilized/non-sterilized soils. Results showed that the contents of labile organic C fractions were significantly varied (P<0.05) with the levels of glucose addition and soil sterilization. SS+Glu-2 and Glu-2 treatments increased the contents of labile organic C fractions, on average, by 48.47% and 35.33% compared with no glucose addition, respectively. About 21.42% and 16.17% of glucose-C remained in sterilized and non-sterilized soils, respectively at the end of experiment (day 45). Regardless of soil sterilized or not, the glucose addition increased the richness and diversity indices of soil bacterial community compared with no-glucose addition. The glucose addition optimized root zone conditions, and enhanced root vitality, morphology and biomass. Both SS+Glu-2 and Glu-2 treatments significantly enhanced (P<0.05) the contents of nitrate (NO3-N) and nitrite (NO2-N), but sharply decreased (P<0.05) the ammonium (NH4+-N) content compared with no glucose addition. Also, these two treatments significantly (P<0.05) increased the enzymic activities and gene transcript levels involved in root N metabolism, which demonstrated that the high level of glucose addition promoted N assimilation and transformation into free amino acids by root. Overall, the addition of exogenous C to not only promotes its fixation and bacterial community diversity in C-poor soils, but also improves root morphology and N absorption by plant."
https://openalex.org/W4205322193,"Climate change has been discussed as to exert shifts in geographical range of plants, animals or insect species by increasing, reducing or shifting its appropriate climatic habitat. Globally, Pakistan has been ranked at 5 th position on the list of countries most vulnerable to climate change in 2020. Climate change has resulted in the losses of biodiversity and alteration in ecosystem as a result of depletion of natural habitats of species in Pakistan as well as in the world. Ants have been regarded as indicators of environmental change and ecosystem processes. Brachyponera nigrita (Emery, 1895) was reported for the first time from Pakistan (Pothwar region). Objective of our studies was to model geographic distribution of newly recorded ant species, B . nigrita based on two representative concentration pathways (RCP) (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) for 2050s using maximum entropy model (Maxent) in Pakistan. In modeling procedure, 21occurrence records and 8 variables namely Bio4 (Temperature seasonality), Bio8 (Mean temperature of wettest quarter), Bio10 (Mean temperature of warmest quarter), Bio12 (Annual precipitation), Bio13 (Precipitation of wettest month), Bio15 (Precipitation seasonality), Bio17 (Precipitation of driest quarter) and Bio18 (Precipitation of warmest quarter) were used to determine the current and future distributions. Performance of the model was evaluated using AUC (area under curves) values, partial ROC, omission rates (E = 5%) and AICc (Model complexity).The results showed the average AUC value of the model was 0.930, which indicated that the accuracy of the model was excellent. The jackknife test also showed that Bio4, Bio18, Bio17 and Bio15 contributed 98% for the prediction of potential distribution of the species as compared to all other variables. Maxent results indicated that distribution area of B . nigrita under future predicted bioclimatics 2050 (RCP 4.5 and RCP8.5) would be increased in various localities of Pakistan as compared to its current distribution. In Pothwar region, moderately suitable and highly suitable areas of this species would increase by 505.932321km 2 and 572.118421km 2 as compared to current distribution under 2050 (RCP 4.5), while under 2050 (RCP 8.5), there would be an increase of 6427.2576km 2 and 3765.140493km 2 respectively in moderately suitable and highly suitable areas of B . nigrita . This species was associated with termites, collembolans and larval stages of different insects. White eggs, creamy white pupae and many workers of this species were observed in a variety of habitats. Unknown nesting ecology, species identification characters supported with micrographs has been given which will help researchers for further ecological studies."
https://openalex.org/W4205475884,"A popular strategy for mitigating climate change is to persuade or incentivize individuals to limit behaviors associated with high greenhouse gas emissions. In this study, adults in the mid-Atlantic United States bid in an auction to receive compensation for eliminating beef consumption or limiting vehicle use. The auction incentivized participants to reveal their true costs of accepting these limits for periods ranging from one week to one year. Compliance with the conditions of the auction was confirmed via a random field audit of the behavioral changes. The estimated median abatement costs were greater than $600 per tCO2e for beef consumption and $1,300 per tCO2e for vehicle use, values much higher than the price of carbon offsets and most estimates of the social cost of carbon. Although these values may decline over time with experience or broader social adoption, they imply that policies that encourage innovations to reduce the costs of behavior change, such as meat alternatives or emission-free vehicles, may be a more fruitful than those that limit beef consumption or vehicle use."
https://openalex.org/W4205790975,"Risk quantification algorithms in the ICU can provide (1) an early alert to the clinician that a patient is at extreme risk and (2) help manage limited resources efficiently or remotely. With electronic health records, large data sets allow the training of predictive models to quantify patient risk. A gradient boosting classifier was trained to predict high-risk and low-risk trauma patients, where patients were labeled high-risk if they expired within the next 10 hours or within the last 10% of their ICU stay duration. The MIMIC-III database was filtered to extract 5,400 trauma patient records (526 non-survivors) each of which contained 5 static variables (age, gender, etc.) and 28 dynamic variables (e.g., vital signs and metabolic panel). Training data was also extracted from the dynamic variables using a 3-hour moving time window whereby each window was treated as a unique patient-time fragment. We extracted the mean, standard deviation, and skew from each of these 3-hour fragments and included them as inputs for training. Additionally, a survival metric upon admission was calculated for each patient using a previously developed National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB)-trained gradient booster model. The final model was able to distinguish between high-risk and low-risk patients to an AUROC of 92.9%, defined as the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve. Importantly, the dynamic survival probability plots for patients who die appear considerably different from those who survive, an example of reducing the high dimensionality of the patient record to a single trauma trajectory."
https://openalex.org/W4205841238,"Technical elements are related to shooting performance; however, the importance of each factor regarding performance, especially in elite-level pistol shooters, remains controversial. The objective of this study was to determine the technical factors that influence pistol performance. One elite-level shooter was analysed during the season before the Olympic classification European championship through a total of six competitions (n = 360 shots). Aiming point trajectories were measured with the SCATT optoelectronic system. Variables were classified into six categories: performance; aiming time; stability of hold; aiming accuracy; cleanness of triggering and shooting delta. Principal component analysis, multiple regressions, Pearson correlations and ANOVAs were used to analyse the data. The results showed that five components (aiming time, stability of hold, aiming accuracy, cleanness of triggering and shooting delta) determined a total of 79.68% of the shooting variance. Specifically, aiming accuracy and cleanness of triggering explained up to 25% of the shooting score, with cleanness of triggering serving as the determining factor. Correlations were found among the performance and stability of hold, aiming accuracy, cleanness of triggering and shooting delta. Last, significant differences were found among 8-score, 9-score and 10-score shots. We conclude that while aiming accuracy seems to be related to the performance, cleanness of triggering could be the most critical technical element; furthermore, while stability of hold does not seem to be a determining factor of the score, it could be a general prerequisite to achieve high levels of performance in elite-level air pistol shooters."
https://openalex.org/W4205852568,"In recent years, interest has grown in whether and to what extent demographic diversity sparks discovery and innovation in research. At the same time, topic modeling has been employed to discover differences in what women and men write about. This study engages these two strands of scholarship to explore associations between changing researcher demographics and research questions asked in the discipline of history. Specifically, we analyze developments in history as women entered the field.We focus on author gender in diachronic analysis of history dissertations from 1980 (when online data is first available) to 2015 and a select set of general history journals from 1950 to 2015. We use correlated topic modeling and network visualizations to map developments in research agendas over time and to examine how women and men have contributed to these developments.Our summary snapshot of aggregate interests of women and men for the period 1950 to 2015 identifies new topics associated with women authors: gender and women's history, body history, family and households, consumption and consumerism, and sexuality. Diachronic analysis demonstrates that while women pioneered topics such as gender and women's history or the history of sexuality, these topics broaden over time to become methodological frameworks that historians widely embraced and that changed in interesting ways as men engaged with them. Our analysis of history dissertations surface correlations between advisor/advisee gender pairings and choice of dissertation topic.Overall, this quantitative longitudinal study suggests that the growth in women historians has coincided with the broadening of research agendas and an increased sensitivity to new topics and methodologies in the field."
https://openalex.org/W4206093834,"Vigna stipulacea (Lam.) Kuntz., commonly known as Minni payaru is an underutilized legume species and has a great potential to be utilized as food crop. To evaluate and select the best germplasm to be harnessed in the breeding programme, we assessed the genetic diversity of V. stipulacea (94 accessions) conserved in the Indian National Genebank, based on morphological traits and microsatellite markers. Significant variation was recorded for the morphological traits studied. Euclidean distance using UPGMA method grouped all accessions into two major clusters. Accessions were identified for key agronomic traits such as, early flowering (IC331436, IC251436, IC331437); long peduncle length (IC553518, IC550531, IC553557, IC553540, IC550532, IC553564); and more number of seeds per pod (IC553529, IC622865, IC622867, IC553528). To analyse the genetic diversity among the germplasm 33 SSR primers were used anda total of 116 alleles were detected. The number of alleles varied from two to seven, with an average of 3.52 per loci. The polymorphic information content values varied from 0.20 to 0.74, with a mean of 0.40. The high number of alleles per locus and the allelic diversity in the studied germplasm indicated a relatively wider genetic base of V. stipulacea. Phylogenetic analysis clustered accessions into seven clades. Population structure analysis grouped them into five genetic groups, which were partly supported by PCoA and phylogenetic tree. Besides, PCoA and AMOVA also decoded high genetic diversity among the V. stipulacea accessions. Thus, morphological and microsatellite markers distinguished V. stipulacea accessions and assessed their genetic diversity efficiently. The identified promising accessions can be utilized in Vigna improvement programme through introgression breeding and/or can be used for domestication and enhanced utilization of V. stipulacea."

We tabulate rates of screening and other results across students by grade and student characteristics, highlighting the expansion of SVP in community schools beginning in 2015-16.The SVP screens about 87% of students in Pre-K through 1st Grade each school year. Of the 22% of screened students who failed the screening in 2018-19, 69% received follow-up efforts, and 39% completed eye exams. Among students with completed eye exams, 13% of students in Pre-K through 1st grade were diagnosed with amblyopia, and 70% needed glasses. Less advantaged students in terms of race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status were less likely to pass vision screenings and less likely to receive eye exams after failing the screening. The SVP's expansion to all grades in community schools and its provision of eye exams and glasses increased the rate of eye exams to 90% of students with a failed vision screening and distributed glasses to over 22,000 students in grades Pre-K to 12 in 2018-19.The expansion of SVP services in community schools suggests large potential benefits from school districts connecting students who fail vision screenings directly to eye doctors. Otherwise, low rates of follow-up eye exams in younger grades can lead to unidentified and unmet need for vision services in older grades, especially among disadvantaged students."

To investigate this possibility, we analyzed all link shares and reshares on Meta's Facebook platform (e.g., shares and reshares of news articles) in the United States from August 2019 to December 2020 (containing billions of aggregated and de-identified shares and reshares). We then identified all link shares and reshares on ""climate change"" and ""global warming"" from this repository to develop a social media salience index-the Climate SMSI score-and found an 80% decrease in climate change content sharing and resharing as COVID-19 spread during the spring of 2020. Climate change salience then briefly rebounded in the autumn of 2020 during a period of record-setting wildfires and droughts in the United States before returning to low content sharing and resharing levels. This fluctuating pattern suggests new climate communication strategies-focused on ""systemic sustainability""-are necessary in an age of competing global crises."
https://openalex.org/W4206704777,"Little is known about the association between maternal depressive symptoms and attendance at safety promotion interventions. This study used latent class analysis (LCA) to identify the profile of attendance within a toddler safety intervention and assessed its relation with maternal depressive symptoms at baseline and reduction of home safety problems over time, separately.The analytic sample included 91 mothers of toddlers (mean maternal age 28.16 years) who were assigned to the safety promotion intervention group as part of a randomized trial and assessed at baseline, 6-month and 12-month follow-ups. Using LCA, we classified mothers into low and high attendance classes based on their attendance at 8 intervention sessions. We assessed maternal depressive symptoms with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and home safety problems with a 9-item home safety problem observation.The mothers were classified into low attendance (45%) and high attendance classes (55%). The posterior probability of attending each session ranged from 0-0.29 for the low attendance class and 0.68-0.92 for the high attendance class. Each one unit increase of BDI sum score at baseline was associated with an 8% reduced odds of being in the high attendance class (aOR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.86, 1.00, p = 0.037). The home safety problem score reduction was greater among high attendance class participants than low attendance class participants at the 6-month follow-up (b = -1.15, 95% CI:-2.09, -0.20, p = 0.018).Maternal depressive symptoms were associated with the reduced probability of maternal attendance at toddler safety promotion sessions; high session attendance was related to greater reduction of toddler home safety problems. Identifying risk factors for maternal low attendance to interventions and developing strategies to promote attendance should lead to reductions in home safety problems and reductions in unintentional injuries among young children."
https://openalex.org/W4206908393,"In order to establish natural social synchrony between two humans, two requirements need to be fulfilled. First, the coupling must be bi-directional. The two humans react to each other's actions. Second, natural social bodily synchronization has to be intentional or unintentional. Assuming that these essential aspects of human-human interactions are present, the present paper investigates whether similar bodily synchrony emerges between an interacting human and an artificial agent such as a robot. More precisely, we investigate whether the same human unintentional rhythmic entrainment and synchronization is present in Human Robot Interaction (HRI). We also evaluate which model (e.g., an adaptive vs non adaptive robot) better reproduces such unintentional entrainment. And finally, we compare interagent coordination stability of the HRI under 1) unidirectional (robot with fixed frequency) versus bidirectional (robot with adaptive frequency) rhythmic entrainment and 2) human intentional versus unintentional coupling. Fifteen young adults made vertical arm movements in front of the NAO robot under five different conditions of intentional/unintentional and unidirectional/bidirectional interactions. Consistent with prior research investigating human-human interpersonal coordination, when humans interact with our robot, (i) unintentional entrainment was present, (ii) bi-directional coupling produced more stable in-phase un-intentional and intentional coordination, (iii) and intentional coordination was more stable than unintentional coordination. To conclude, this study provides a foundation for modeling future social robots involving unintentional and bidirectional synchronization-aspects which seem to enhance humans' willingness to interact with robots."
https://openalex.org/W4225511318,"The world population is aging and no country is immune to the consequences. We are not aware of any country-specific skin aging risk factors data for the Mongolian people. Thus, we aimed to study the risk factors associated with skin aging in the Mongolian population. A population-based cross-sectional study of 2720 study participants 18 years of age and older was performed evaluating the severity of skin aging based on cutaneous microtopography. Questionnaire data and skin physiological measurements were obtained. The odds ratios for skin aging grades associated with risk factors were estimated using ordinal logistic regression. Study participant's mean age was 45 years, ranging from 18 to 87. After adjustment for known risk factors, skin aging was associated with demographic risk factors such as increasing age (aOR = 1.19, 95% CI 1.18-1.20), living in an urban area (aOR = 1.31, 95% CI 1.12-1.55) and lifestyle factors including being a smoker (aOR = 1.32, 95% CI 1.09-1.61), having a higher body mass index (aOR = 1.04, 95% CI 1.02-1.06) and higher levels of sun exposure time (aOR = 1.03, 95% CI 1.00-1.06) were significantly associated with higher skin aging grades. Having dry (aOR = 1.94, 95% CI 1.45-2.59) and combination skin (aOR = 1.62, 95% CI 1.22-2.16) types were also independent risk factors associated with skin aging. Having very low skin surface moisture at the T-zone (aOR = 2.10, 95% CI 1.42-3.11) was significantly related to skin aging. Older age, urban living and toxic working conditions were independent demographic risk factors related to skin aging. Smoking, higher BMI, greater levels of sun exposure were significant lifestyle risk factors. Having a skin type other than normal was a physiologic risk factor for skin aging."
https://openalex.org/W4205118423,"In drug trials, adverse events (AEs) burden can induce treatment non-adherence or discontinuation. The non-adherence and discontinuation induce selection bias, affecting drug safety interpretation. Nested case-control (NCC) study can efficiently quantify the impact of the AEs, although choice of sampling approach is challenging. We investigated whether NCC study with incidence density sampling is more efficient than NCC with path sampling under conditional logistic or weighted Cox models in assessing the effect of AEs on treatment non-adherence and participation in preventive antimalarial drug during pregnancy trial.Using data from a trial of medication to prevent malaria in pregnancy that randomized 600 women to receive chloroquine or sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine during pregnancy, we conducted a NCC study assessing the role of prospectively collected AEs, as exposure of interest, on treatment non-adherence and study non-completion. We compared estimates from NCC study with incidence density against those from NCC with path sampling under conditional logistic and weighted Cox models.Out of 599 women with the outcomes of interest, 474 (79%) experienced at least one AE before delivery. For conditional logistic model, the hazard ratio for the effect of AE occurrence on treatment non-adherence was 0.70 (95% CI: 0.42, 1.17; p = 0.175) under incidence density sampling and 0.68 (95% CI: 0.41, 1.13; p = 0.137) for path sampling. For study non-completion, the hazard ratio was 1.02 (95% CI: 0.56, 1.83; p = 0.955) under incidence density sampling and 0.85 (95% CI: 0.45, 1.60; p = 0.619) under path sampling. We obtained similar hazard ratios and standard errors under incidence density sampling and path sampling whether weighted Cox or conditional logistic models were used.NCC with incidence density sampling and NCC with path sampling are practically similar in efficiency whether conditional logistic or weighted Cox analytical methods although path sampling uses more unique controls to achieve the similar estimates.ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01443130."
https://openalex.org/W4205245660,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a 12% carbohydrate (CHO) beverage on tackling technique and running performance during rugby league activity. Using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, crossover design, 15 academy rugby league players ingested a 250 ml bolus of a 12% CHO solution (30 g maltodextrin and 30 g sucrose in 500 ml) 15 minutes before two bouts of rugby activity. The rugby league match simulation for interchange players was used to standardise the movement patterns of activity and provide reliable outcome measures, whilst also reflecting the duration of a typical field-based conditioning session. Measures of tackling technique, external responses (e.g., fatigue index from sprint data) and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were recorded throughout. Gut discomfort was measured before each bout. The interaction effect was largely compatible with the hypothesis for relative distance (P<0.001, η2 = 0.217) and fairly compatible for tackling technique (P = 0.068, η2 = 0.0640). The time effect for tackling technique, relative and high-intensity distance, sprint, and sprint to contact velocity, time at high metabolic power, PlayerLoad™, and RPE (all P<0.05; η2 = 0.131-0.701) was compatible with the hypothesis. Data for tackling technique, relative and high-intensity distance, sprint, and sprint to contact velocity, sprint, and sprint to contact fatigue index (all P<0.05; η2 = 0.189-0.612) was compatible with a supplement effect overall despite few differences in the pattern of change (interaction). Minimal gut discomfort was reported for the CHO (bout 1 = 27 ± 17; bout 2 = 23 ± 17 AU) and placebo (bout 1 = 23 ± 18 AU; bout 2 = 24 ± 13) trials. This study shows that a 12% CHO beverage before two bouts of standardised rugby activity is a practical and effective strategy for retaining tackling technique, increasing external responses, and reducing RPE without compromising gut comfort."
https://openalex.org/W4205554235,"Food processing methods may influence the health of dogs. However, previous studies have mostly been based on a comparison of several commercial dog foods with different ingredients. In this study, eighteen adult beagles of the same age and health status (assessed by routine blood tests) were used in the experiments. This study analyzed the effects of the following different processing methods: raw, pasteurized, and high temperature sterilization (HTS) made with the same ingredients and nutrients (based on dry matter) on serum parameters, apparent total-tract macronutrient digestibility, fecal microbiota and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) content in beagle dogs. The data showed, after a test lasting 56-days, the apparent digestibility (ATTD) of protein and fat in HTS food was 91.9%, which was significantly higher (P< 0.05) than that in dry food (89.2%, P < 0.05). The serum content of triglyceride increased in beagles fed HTS food (P < 0.05), and the number of neutrophils in beagles fed raw food and pasteurized food increased significantly (P < 0.05), and the platelet count in beagles fed raw food showed an increasing trend compared with the beagles fed HTS food. Different processing methods had an impact on the intestinal microbiota and SCFA of beagles; at least 14 genera were significantly affected by the food produced using different processing methods. In particular, the abundance of Allprevotella, Escherichia-Shigella and Turicibacter, and the total acid content were lower in beagles fed the raw diet, whereas Streptococcus, Collinsella, Bacteroides and Ruminococcus gnavus were more abundant following the HTS diet, and Lactococcus showed the highest abundance in beagles fed the pasteurized diet. This study showed that dog food produced by different processing methods affected the health of adult beagles."
https://openalex.org/W4205845936,"In stem cell research, DNA-binding dyes offer the ability to purify live stem cells using flow cytometry as they form a low-fluorescence side population due to the activity of ABC transporters. Adult neural stem cells exist within the lateral ventricle and dentate gyrus of the adult brain yet the ability of DNA-binding dyes to identify these adult stem cells as side populations remains untested. The following experiments utilize the efflux of a DNA-binding dye, Vyrbant DyeCycle Violet (DCV), to isolate bona fide side populations in the mouse dentate gyrus and subventricular zone (SVZ), and test their sensitivity to ABC transporter inhibitors. A distinct side population was found in both the adult lateral ventricle and dentate gyrus using DCV fluorescence and forward scatter instead of the conventional dual fluorescence approach. These side populations responded strongly to inhibition with the ABC transporter antagonists, verapamil and fumitremorgin C. The majority of the cells residing in the side populations of dentate gyrus and SVZ were characterized by their expression of CD31. Additionally, at least 90% of all CD31+ cells found in the dentate gyrus and SVZ were negative for the hematopoietic marker CD45, leading to the hypothesis that the CD31+ cells in the side population were endothelial cells. These findings, therefore, suggest that the side population analysis provides an efficient method to purify CD31-expressing endothelial cells, but not adult neural stem cells."
