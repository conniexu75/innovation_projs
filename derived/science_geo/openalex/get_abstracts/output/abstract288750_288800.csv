https://openalex.org/W2093808053,The heavy-ion mass spectrum obtained in the inner coma of comet Halley with the PICCA instrument on the Giotto spacecraft has been examined. Short polymer chains of polyoxymethylene and their decay products are identified as the source for the spectrum with six mass peaks between about 45 and 120 atomic mass units. The properties of polyoxymethylene are consistent with many of the unexpected observations in the coma.

Phonon-assisted tunneling of a distribution of glassy bistable configurations, or two-level systems, can account for these anomalies. A unified understanding of the low-temperature properties is required for an understanding of the glassy state. Persistent nonphotochemical hole burning of impurity optical transitions allows a glass state to be produced that is thermally inaccessible to the preburn state, and that allows the probing of tunneling dynamics on time scales that range between picoseconds and days. These data combined with recently obtained distribution functions for the two-level systems offer new insights into the tunneling dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2006014326,"The pheromone-mediated flight behavior of male Oriental fruit moths was observed in the field to test the hypothesis that male activation far downwind of a female is initiated by the major, or most abundant, component of the pheromone blend. Males responded at significantly greater distances to the three-component pheromone blend produced by females than to the major component alone or to either binary mixture containing the major component and one minor component. These results support the alternative hypothesis that the active space of a multicomponent pheromone is a function of male perception of the female-released blend of components, rather than of the major component alone, and that so-called minor components have a greater impact on male behavior farther downwind of a female than previously thought."
https://openalex.org/W2149599537,"Recent developments in laser spectroscopy of atomic ions stored in electromagnetic traps are reviewed with emphasis on techniques that appear to hold the greatest promise of attaining extremely high resolution. Among these techniques are laser cooling and the use of single, isolated ions as experimental samples. Doppler shifts and other perturbing influences can be largely eliminated. Atomic resonances with line widths of a few parts in 10(11) have been observed at frequencies ranging from the radio frequency to the ultraviolet. Experimental accuracies of one part in 10(18) appear to be attainable."
https://openalex.org/W2055509386,"In situ measurements of the composition and spatial distribution of heavy thermal positive ions in the coma of comet Halley were made with the heavy-ion analyzer RPA2-PICCA aboard the Giotto spacecraft. Above 50 atomic mass units an ordered series of mass peaks centered at 61, 75, 91, and 105 atomic mass units were observed. Each peak appears to be composed of three or more closely spaced masses. The abundances decrease and the dissociation rates increase smoothly with increasing mass. These observations suggest the presence of chain molecules that are enriched in carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen, such as polyoxymethylene (polymerized formaldehyde), in comet Halley."
https://openalex.org/W2024542201,"Laser techniques in conjunction with the diamond-anvil cell can be used to study high-pressure properties of materials important to a wide range of problems in earth and planetary science. Spontaneous Raman scattering of crystalline and amorphous solids at high pressure demonstrates that dramatic changes in structure and bonding occur on compression. High-pressure Brillouin scattering is sensitive to the pressure variations of single-crystal elastic moduli and acoustic velocities. Laser heating techniques with the diamond-anvil cell can be used to study phase transitions, including melting, under deep-earth conditions. Finally, laser-induced ruby fluorescence has been essential for the development of techniques for generating the maximum pressures now possible with the diamond-anvil cell, and currently provides a calibrated in situ measure of pressure well above 100 gigapascals."
https://openalex.org/W1992120902,"High-resolution transmission electron microscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy have been combined to examine the structure of the thin ""native"" oxide that forms on silicon surfaces at room temperature. Differences in the cleaning procedures for silicon wafers may affect the morphology of this oxide and critically influence further processing on the silicon substrates. An etch that ended with a dip in hydrofluoric acid provided a thinner oxide and a lower interface step density than did a sulfuric peroxide treatment. The availability of complementary information from high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy is discussed."

The treatment consisted of daily intravenous injections of 5 micrograms of l. casei factor (""folic acid""). The treated animals lived longer than the controls, especially the healed mice. The incidence of the development of new tumors was decreased among the treated mice as compared with the controls."

https://openalex.org/W2006331882,"One year after US citizen diplomats signed a remarkable pact with the Soviet Union to monitor nuclear bomb tests, they are running into some of the obstacles that regular diplomats encounter - political flak from the Pentagon and harassment by the Soviet military. But they have devised some technical solutions that they hope will get them around the roadblocks. These solutions are discussed."
