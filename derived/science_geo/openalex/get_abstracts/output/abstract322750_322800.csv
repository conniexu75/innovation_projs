https://openalex.org/W2028187255,Soybean lectin labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate combined specifically with all but 3 of 25 strains of the soybean-nodulating bacterium Rhizobium japonicum. The lectin did not bind to any of 23 other strains representative of rhizobia that do not nodulate soybeans. The evidence suggests that an interaction between legume lectins and Rhizobium cells may account for the specificity expressed between rhizobia and host plant in the initiation of the nitrogen-fixing symbiosis.

https://openalex.org/W2021085604,Whether two species competing for the same limited resources can stably coexist has been subject to controversy for several decades. The relative fitnesses of two species of Drosophila under competition in laboratory populations are shown to be inversely related to the relative frequencies of these species. This frequency-dependent fitness leads to a stable coexistence of the two species in spite of their competition for limited resources.
https://openalex.org/W1969371365,"cis-9, trans-12-Tetradecadien-1-yl acetate was isolated from the female Indian meal moth, Plodia interpunctella (Hübner), and the female almond moth, Cadra cautella (Walker). It is the major if not the sole component of the sex stimulatory and attractant pheromone of female Plodia. It is present in the pheromone of the female Cadra along with at least one synergist."
https://openalex.org/W2049277460,"The local electronic structures of the surface regions of tungsten, tungsten carbide, and platinum have been compared. Contrary to the hypothesis that the platinum-like catalytic activity of tungsten carbide results from the contribution of carbon valence electrons to the 5d band of tungsten, the width of the unfilled portion of the d band increases on going from tungsten to tungsten carbide."
https://openalex.org/W1977942462,"Female moths of different species but belonging to the same subfamily produce an identical compound as their sex pheromone. The sex pheromone of the almond moth, Cadra cautella (Walker), and the Indian meal moth, Plodia interpunctella (Hübner), has been isolated and identified as cis-9, trans-12-tetradecadienyl acetate."
https://openalex.org/W2012399689,"Land-plant type spores occur in argillaceous limestones and platform graptolitic mudstones of Wenlock-Ludlow age in Sweden. Analysis of the stratal sequence demonstrates that occurrence of abundant spores is a function of depositional ecology, particularly water depth and shoreline proximity. This ecological analysis and the seeming absence of any correlation between the first appearances of abundant spores and megafossils of land-plant type raise the possibility that land plants evolved far earlier than the megafossil record suggests."
https://openalex.org/W2076043144,"N-Methyl,N-phenyl-2-aminonaphthalene-6-sulfonate, a fluorescence probe, adsorbs to cycloheptaamylose with a stoichiometry of 1 : 1. The fluorescence of the complex is similar to that observed when the dye is dissolved in organic solvents. Similar fluorescence is observed with the dye in ice. The results are interpreted in terms of ""solvent"" relaxation during the excited state lifetime of the dye."

https://openalex.org/W2026217293,"Analysis of discoloration patterns on the camera of the spacecraft Surveyor 3, after the Apollo 12 lunar module landed nearby, indicates that lunar surface particles were eroded and entrained by lunar modute exhaust during the landing and were ejected almost horizontally at 70 meters per second or faster. These particles struck the Surveyor camere and whitenzed its surface."

https://openalex.org/W2055366680,"Sodic and aluminous orthoamphiboles from metamorphosed volcanic rocks develop helicoidal fractures upon cooling, due to elastic strain gradients radial to the c-axis. This condition may arise from radial composition gradients involving substitution of tetrahedral silicon by aluminum in the double chain structure or from intergranular boundary constraints with adjacent quartz."
