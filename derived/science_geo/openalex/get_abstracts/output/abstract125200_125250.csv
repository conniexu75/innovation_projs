https://openalex.org/W1995584424,"We report the isolation of three full-length cDNAs corresponding to the mRNAs of closely related glutathione S-transferase (GST) Pi genes, designated hGSTP1*A, hGSTP1*B, and hGSTP1*C, expressed in normal cells and malignant gliomas. The variant cDNAs result from A → G and C → T transitions at nucleotides +313 and +341, respectively. The transitions changed codon 104 from ATC (Ile) in hGSTP1*A to GTC (Val) in hGSTP1*B and hGSTP1*C and changed codon 113 from GCG (Ala) to GTG (Val) in hGSTP1*C Both amino changes are in the electrophile-binding active site of the GST Pi peptide. Computer modeling of the deduced crystal structures of the encoded peptides showed significant deviations in the interatomic distances of critical electrophile-binding active site amino acids as a consequence of the amino acid changes. The encoded proteins expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by GSH affinity chromatography showed a 3-fold lower Km (CDNB) and a 3-4-fold higher Kcat/Km for the hGSTP1*A encoded protein than the proteins encoded by hGSTP1*B and hGSTP1*C Analysis of 75 cases showed the relative frequency of hGSTP1*C to be 4-fold higher in malignant gliomas than in normal tissues. These data provide conclusive molecular evidence of allelopolymorphism of the human GST Pi gene locus, resulting in active, functionally different GST Pi proteins, and should facilitate studies of the role of this gene in xenobiotic metabolism, cancer, and other human diseases.

Based on their biochemical, immunological, and structural properties, the currently known soluble human GSTs are categorized into four main classes, namely Alpha, Mu, Pi, and Theta (5Mannervik B.

J. 1992; 282: 305-307Google Scholar). GSTs are involved in many cellular functions, the best characterized of which is their role as phase II enzymes in which they catalyze the S-conjugation of glutathione (GSH) with a wide variety of electrophilic compounds, including many mutagens, carcinogens, anticancer agents, and their metabolites (1Mannervik B.

In many human tumors and pre-neoplastic lesions, the GST Pi protein is over-expressed, even though in the corresponding normal tissues the protein either is absent or else is expressed at very low levels. The GST Pi gene has been mapped to a relatively small region of chromosome 11q13 in which is localized a number of cancer-associated genes and proto-oncogenes, including bcl1/prad1, int2, hstf1, and sea, some of which have been reported to be co-amplified with the GST Pi gene in some tumors (18Lammie G.A.

In malignant gliomas, a positive correlation has been demonstrated between the level of GST Pi expression by immunocytochemistry and both the histological grade of the tumor and patient survival 2F. Ali-Osman, J. M. Bruner, T. Cutluk, K. Hess, manuscript in preparation. (19Saint-Ruf C. Malfoy B. Scholl S. Zafrani B. Dutrillaux B. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 403-406Google Scholar, 20Hare A. Yamaha H. N.

Earlier data from our laboratory using human glioma cell lines have also shown an association between high GST Pi protein expression and 2-chloroethylnitrosourea resistance (22Ali-Osman F. Stein D. Renwick A. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6976-6980Google Scholar). To date, the nucleotide sequences of the complete human GST Pi cDNA and GST Pi gene reported from different laboratories (23Kano T. Sakai M. Muramatsu M. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 5626-5630Google Scholar, 24Moscow J.A. Townsend A.J. Goldsmith M.E. Whang-Peng J. Vickers P.J. Legault-Poisson S. Myers C.E. Cowan K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Gene. 1989; 75: 3-11Google Scholar) have been identical, leading to the notion that only one human GST Pi gene exists (5Mannervik B. Awasthi Y.C. Board P.G. Hayes J.D. Illio C.D. Ketterer B. Listowsky L. Morgenstern R. Muramatsu M. Pearson W.R. Pickett C.B. Sato K. Widerstern M. Wolf C.R. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 305-307Google Scholar). The isolation of two different GST Pi proteins from human placenta (27Ahmad H. Wilson D.E. Fritz R.R. Singh S.V. Medh R.D. Singh S.V. Nagle G.T. Awasthi Y.C. Kurosky A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 278: 398-448Google Scholar), however, strongly indicates that genetic polymorphism may exist in the human GST Pi gene locus. In the present study, we describe the isolation and molecular characterization of full-length cDNAs of three polymorphic GST Pi genes that are expressed in human malignant glioma cells and in other normal cells and tissues. The intracellular stabilities of the variant mRNAs were examined, and the proteins encoded by the variant cDNAs were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified by GSH affinity chromatography, and used in enzyme kinetic analyses to examine the functional consequences of the structural differences. Computer modeling was performed following introduction of the amino acid changes into the three-dimensional structure of the placental GST Pi protein that had been previously isolated and co-crystallized with S-hexylglutathione (28Reinemer P. Dirr H.W. Ladenstein R. Lo Bello M. Federici G. Parker M.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 214-226Google Scholar). The frequency of each of the gene variants in primary specimens and cell lines of malignant gliomas and in normal brain, normal placenta, and peripheral blood lymphocytes was investigated, and the concordance of the observed genotype and phenotype was determined by DNA- and RNA-PCR of representative specimens. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy donors using a single step Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation (29Ali-Osman F. Jones G.E. J. Mol. Biol.Methods in Molecular Medicine. Human Cell Culture Protocols. Human Press Inc., 1996: 63-80Google Scholar). Full-term human placentas were obtained after normal vaginal delivery. Primary malignant glioma specimens were obtained incidental to surgery. All specimens were acquired on institutionally approved protocols. Glioma cell lines were established in our laboratories from primary specimens, as we previously described (30Maurer H.R. Maschler R. Dietrich R. Goebel B. J. Immun. Meth. 1977; 18: 353Google Scholar), and were in less than 40 in vitro passages. Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals were from Sigma. Restriction enzymes and biochemicals were from Boehringer Mannheim, and PCR reagents from Perkin-Elmer. Polyclonal antibodies against human GST Alpha, GST Mu, and GST Pi were obtained from Biotrin Inc. (Dublin, Ireland). Polyadenylated RNA was purified on oligo(dT) cellulose columns from total RNA isolated from glioma cells by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate phenol-chloroform method (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular cloning: A laboratory manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989Google Scholar) and used in λgt 11 cDNA library synthesis according to the modified procedure of Gubler and Hoffman (32Gubler U. Hoffmann B.J. Gene. 1983; 25: 263-267Google Scholar), using the protocol of Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). After first and second strand cDNA synthesis, the cDNA pool was size-fractionated at a 500-bp cut-off to reduce the proportion of truncated GST Pi cDNAs. The double-stranded cDNAs were then blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase, methylated with EcoRI methylase, and ligated to EcoRI linkers. Following EcoRI digestion to remove excess linkers, the cDNAs were ligated into bacteriophage λgt 11 EcoRI arms and packaged using the Gigapack II Gold packaging extract (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Serial dilutions of the resulting cDNA library was screened using a rapid PCR screening procedure (33Takumi T. Lodish H.F. Biotechniques. 1994; 17: 443-444Google Scholar), which we had previously modified (34Ali-Osman F. Akande O. Biochimica. 1995; 4: 28Google Scholar) by the use of the Expand™ PCR system (Boehringer Mannheim). Positive cDNA pools were plated on E. coli strain Y109 Or−, screened with a 32P-labeled GST Pi cDNA probe, and GST Pi positive clones were amplified. The DNA was isolated, purified, and sequenced. Nucleotide sequencing was performed with the 35S-labeled dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (35Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar) using the circumvent thermal cycle sequencing protocol (New England Biolabs, MA) either directly or after subcloning into Bluescript phagemid II. Sequencing primers were designed to overlap internal GST Pi cDNA regions as well as to the vector. Each clone was sequenced twice in both directions. Amplification of GST Pi cDNAs for subcloning and for structural analyses was performed by PCR on templates of isolated GST Pi cDNAs or first strand cDNA synthesized from total RNA prepared, as described earlier, from cells and tissues. For the latter, first strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription (RT) in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 100 ng of reverse primer, 1 μg of total RNA, 250 μM dNTP, 3.2 mM sodium pyrophosphate, and 0.4 unit/ml each of placental RNase inhibitor and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. After 2 min at 94°C, followed by 1 h at 42°C, the mixture was heated to 95°C for 2 min and rapidly cooled to 25°C. The PCR reaction mixture contained approximately 200 ng of template cDNA (or 20 μl of the first strand cDNA reaction mixture), 500 ng of the appropriate forward and reverse GST Pi primers, 200 μM dNTP, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.025 unit/ml of Amplitaq polymerase and PCR buffer (to 100 μl). PCR amplification was performed for 34 cycles of 94°C (1 min), 58°C (2 min), and 72°C (3 min). Computerassisted analysis of restriction endonuclease sites in the variant GST Pi cDNAs was used to identify restriction enzymes, which had gained or lost restriction motifs as a consequence of the nucleotide transitions identified from the sequence data of the cDNAs. From these, two low frequency cutting enzymes, MaeII and XcmI, were selected for restriction site mapping of the cDNAs. A 484-bp cDNA fragment, spanning positions +112 to +596 of the GST Pi cDNA, was amplified by RT-PCR from each specimen, as described earlier, using the primers: 5′-ACGTGGCAGGAGGGCTCACTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TACTCAGGGGAGGCCAGCAA-3′ (reverse). The cDNA product was purified and after restriction with MaeII and XcmI was electrophoresed in 2% agarose and stained with 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide, and the restriction pattern was photographed under ultraviolet illumination. Fragment sizes were determined relative to marker DNA (φX174 DNA-HaeIII digest) and the structures were confirmed, in representative cases, by nucleotide sequencing. Oligodeoxynucleotide probes were designed to cover the region +312 to +342 of the GST Pi cDNA and to contain the nucleotide changes specific to each of the GST Pi cDNAs. The probe sequences were: 5′-CATCTCCCTCATCTACACCAACTA-TGAGGCG-3′ (hGSTP1*A), 5′-CG*TCTCCCTCATCTACACCAACTATGAGGCG-3′ (hGSTP1*B), and 5′-CG*TCTCCCTCATCTACACCAACTATGAGGT*G-3′ (hGSTP1*C). The asterisks indicate the transition nucleotides. Each probe was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP to a specific activity of approximately 4 × 106 cpm/ml using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Southern hybridization was performed using standard methods (36Chomcznski P. Saachi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar) but at the higher, more stringent temperature of 65°C. Following autoradiography photodocumentation, the membranes were stripped off the hybridized oligonucleotide probe and rehybridized with the next probe. To determine the concordance between the GST Pi genotype and phenotype in a given specimen, we examined the nucleotide sequences of exons 5 and 6, which contained the nucleotide transitions observed in the GST Pi mRNA variants. For this, nine representative samples were selected to represent each of the three GST Pi mRNA variants. Using genomic DNA, a 305-bp DNA fragment spanning nucleotides +1219 to +1524 of the GST Pi gene and containing the entire exon 5 and its flanking regions in introns 4 and 6 as well as a 321-bp fragment spanning nucleotides +2136 to +2467 including all of exon 6 and its flanking regions in introns 5 and 7 were amplified by PCR. Primers for these amplifications were as follows: 5′-CCAGGCTGGGGCTCACAGACAGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGTCAGCCCAAGCCACCTGAGG-3′ (reverse) for exon 5 and 5′-TGGCAGCTGAAGTGGACAGGATT-3′ (forward) and 5′-ATGGCTCACACCTGTGTCCATCT-3′ (reverse) for exon 6. Full-length cDNAs of the GST Pi gene variants were amplified by PCR from the respective GST Pi cDNA clones. To facilitate directional subcloning into the expression vector, forward and reverse primers were designed to contain restriction sites for EcoRI and XbaI at the 5′- and 3′-termini, respectively, of the resulting cDNA probes. Both restriction sites are absent in the GST Pi cDNA. After nucleotide sequencing to ensure the absence of PCR-induced mutations, the cDNA products were ligated into the pBK-CMV phagemid vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), in which prokaryotic gene expression is driven by the lac promoter and eukaryotic expression by the immediate early CMV promoter. Strain XL1 Blue bacteria were transformed with the resulting cDNA constructs, screened for positive clones and bacterial cultures of these grown overnight in LB broth. Isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside was added to 1 mM in the last hour of culture. The bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 2 μg/ml lysozyme for 1 h at 37°C, and ultrasonicated. The crude homogenates were centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatants were concentrated 10-fold by membrane filtration at a 10-kDa molecular mass cut-off. Protein content of the supernatants was determined (37Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar) and GST enzyme activity was assayed as described previously (22Ali-Osman F. Stein D. Renwick A. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6976-6980Google Scholar) using CDNB as substrate. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with polyclonal antibodies against human GST Alpha, Mu, and Pi were performed as described previously (22Ali-Osman F. Stein D. Renwick A. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6976-6980Google Scholar). Functional consequences of the structural differences in the GST Pi variant proteins was determined by the differential ability of the recombinant GST Pi proteins to catalyze the conjugation of GSH with 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB), a universal GST substrate. After expression in E. coli, the three GST Pi proteins were purified by GSH affinity chromatography on S-hexylglutathione linked to epoxy-activated Sepharose 6B as described previously (38Simons P.C. Van der Jagt D.L. Jacoby W Methods in Enzymology. 77. 1981: 235-237Google Scholar) and then used for enzyme kinetic analysis. For determining the enzyme kinetic constants for CDNB, reaction mixtures (25°C) in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) contained CDNB (over the range of 0.5-4 mM), 2.5 mM GSH, and 0.015 unit of purified GST Pi protein. Similar reaction mixtures were set up for determining the Km of GSH as a co-substrate, except that the concentration of GSH was varied from 0 to 5 mM, with the concentration of CDNB maintained at 0.1 mM. Changes in absorbance were monitored at 340 nm over two minutes in a Beckman DU 60 spectrophotometer equipped with a kinetic module and used to compute reaction rates. The rates of the spontaneous reactions of GSH with CDNB, determined with reaction mixtures in which the GST Pi enzyme was replaced with buffer, were subtracted from the rates of the enzyme catalyzed reactions. The resulting reaction rates were used to generate double reciprocal plots. Km, Vmax, and Kcat values were determined using standard methodology (39Segel I.H. Biochemical Calculations. John Wiley and Sons, New York, Chicheter, Brisbane, Singapore1976: 208-318Google Scholar). To determine possible effects of the amino acid changes on the three-dimensional architecture of the three GST Pi proteins, the x-ray crystallographic co-ordinates (2.8 Å resolution) of the placental GST Pi (GSTP1a) co-crystallized with S-hexylglutathione (28Reinemer P. Dirr H.W. Ladenstein R. Lo Bello M. Federici G. Parker M.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 214-226Google Scholar) were imported from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank into the SYBYL molecular modeling program (version 6.2, 1995; Tripos Associates, St. Louis, MO) running on a Silicon Graphics Indigo 2 workstation (IRIX 5.2, 64 MB). GSTP1b was created by substituting Ile with Val at amino acid residue 104, and GSTP1c was obtained by substituting Val for Ile at amino acid residue 104 and Val for Ala at 113, using the SYBYL BIOPOLYMER module. Each monomeric subunit of 209 amino acids was energy minimized using the amber all-atom force field in SYBYL. The energy minimized structures were superimposed using the match function of SYBYL. Changes in atomic co-ordinates and in interside chain distances of amino acid residues lining the putative H-site were examined to determine how these structural changes might predict changes in functional activity. Transcriptional block by actinomycin D has been shown in previous studies to be a reliable method with which to determine mRNA turnover and stability in cells (40Dani Ch Blanchard J.M. Piechaczyk M. Sabouty S.E. Marty I. Jeanteur P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 1984; 81: 7046-7050Google Scholar). We therefore applied this technique to investigate differences in the intracellular stability of the transcripts of the different GST Pi genes. Three glioma cell lines expressing different GST Pi gene variants were grown to approximately 70% confluency and then refed with fresh culture medium containing 5 μg/ml actinomycin D. Controls were similarly set up but without actinomycin D treatment. At 0, 6, 12, and 24 h after actinomycin D exposure, total RNA was isolated from each culture and electrophoresed as described earlier at 7.5 μg of RNA/lane. After electrophoresis, the gels were stained with ethidium bromide, viewed under ultraviolet light to ensure equal RNA loading of the lanes, and transferred to nylon filters. Northern hybridization for GST Pi transcript levels was performed as described previously. Hybridization bands were quantitated by densitometry and plotted against time. To further determine the effects of the amino acid changes on the variant GST Pi proteins, we compared the thermal stabilities of the enzymatic function of the three variant GST Pi proteins based in part on the expected differences in α-helix stability of the region of the GST Pi peptides containing the amino acid changes and on a previous study (41Zimniak P. Pikula S. Bandorowicz Pikula J. Singhal S.S. Srivastava S.K. Awasthi S. Awasthi Y.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 893-899Google Scholar) that showed that a recombinant GST Pi enzyme corresponding to GSTP1b-1b, created by site-directed mutagenesis, was functionally more heat-stable than the parent enzyme. Each variant GST Pi protein was incubated at approximately 0.1 unit/ml at 45°C in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2) in a water bath. Every 15 min, over 1 h, a 50-μl aliquot was removed from each incubate, and total GST activity was determined as described previously using CDNB as substrate. Residual GST activity was computed relative to the activity of controls maintained at 25°C and plotted against time. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were performed as described earlier to determine if degradation of the GST Pi peptides had occurred during the incubation. We analyzed approximately 3 × 106 plaque forming units of each cDNA library using the rapid PCR procedure and obtained GST Pi positive clones, from which selected clones were subjected to secondary and tertiary screening and subsequent sequencing. Three clones, Pi 3A-7, Pi 3B-2, and Pi 3C-9, corresponding to each of three GST Pi mRNA variants, were obtained containing full-length GST Pi cDNAs and including both 5′- and 3′-termini. The cDNAs were designated hGSTP1*A, hGSTP1*B, and hGSTP1*C, in accordance with the proposed nomenclature for allelic GST gene variants (5Mannervik B. Awasthi Y.C. Board P.G. Hayes J.D. Illio C.D. Ketterer B. Listowsky L. Morgenstern R. Muramatsu M. Pearson W.R. Pickett C.B. Sato K. Widerstern M. Wolf C.R. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 305-307Google Scholar). The nucleotide transitions giving rise to the three cDNA variants are shown in the sequence autoradiographs in Fig. 1. The sequencing strategy is shown in Fig. 2A, and the complete nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the cDNAs are shown in Fig. 2B Each cDNA contained an open reading frame of 630 nucleotides, encoding 210 amino acids, including the initiating methionine. hGSTP1*A was completely identical in nucleotide sequence to the previously reported human GST Pi cDNA (23Kano T. Sakai M. Muramatsu M. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 5626-5630Google Scholar, 24Moscow J.A. Townsend A.J. Goldsmith M.E. Whang-Peng J. Vickers P.J. Legault-Poisson S. Myers C.E. Cowan K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6518-6522Google Scholar). It consisted of 712 nucleotides, of which 9 were in the 5′ noncoding region. hGSTP1*B differed from hGSTP1*A by having an A → G transition at nucleotide +313, thus changing codon 104 from ATC (Ile) → GTC (Val). Of the 719 nucleotides, 12 were in the 5′ noncoding region. hGSTP1*C was characterized by two active nucleotide transitions, the A → G transition at +313 observed in hGSTP1*B and a C → T transition at +341, resulting in changes of ATC (Ile) → GTC (Val) GTC in codon 104 and of GCG (Ala) → GTG (Val) in codon 113. hGSTP1*C consisted of 723 nucleotides, 13 of which were 5′ of the ATG start codon. The 3′ noncoding regions of all three cDNAs were similar and contained the AATAAA polyadenylation signal at +689 to +696. In 8 cases examined, there was complete concordance between the nucleotide sequences of exons 5 and 6 in the genomic DNA and that of the corresponding regions of the mRNA. In addition to the transitions at nucleotide positions +313 and +341, a silent C → T transition at +555 was observed in hGSTP1*B and hGSTP1*C This transition, also previously observed in the GST Pi cDNA isolated by Moscow et al. (24Moscow J.A. Townsend A.J. Goldsmith M.E. Whang-Peng J. Vickers P.J. Legault-Poisson S. Myers C.E. Cowan K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The sequences were obtained from clones Pi 3A-7 (hGSTP1*A), Pi 3B-2 (hGSTP1*B), and Pi 3C-9 (hGSTP1*C). Nucleotide position +1 is assigned to the first nucleotide of the initiating ATG codon. Nucleotides identical to all three cDNAs are given once and only for hGSTP1*A The transition nucleotides and the altered codons are in bold type The polyadenylation signal sequences present in all three cDNAs is underlined Codons are numbered beginning with the first one after the ATG start codon.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The partial restriction endonuclease maps of the 484-bp cDNA region containing the nucleotide transitions in the three GST Pi cDNAs are shown in Fig. 3A The A → G transition at +313 created a MaeII recognition sequence (A′CGT) in hGSTP1*B and hGSTP1*C, whereas the C → T transition at +341 resulted in the gain of an XcmI recognition sequence (CCANNNNN′NNNNTGG) in hGSTP1*C The 484-bp GST Pi cDNA was amplified by RNA-PCR from representative normal and malignant specimens and after purification was subjected to MaeII or XcmI digestion. As expected from the restriction map (Fig. 3A), MaeII or XcmI did not restrict the cDNAs from specimens that express hGSTP1*A alone (lanes 1, 2, 3, and 8), because both restriction endonuclease sites are absent in this cDNA variant. However, following MaeII digestion, cDNAs from specimens that expressed hGSTP1*B (lane 6) and hGSTP1*C genes (lane 9) alone were cleaved completely to yield the two fragments, 199 and 285 bp in size, as expected from the restriction endonuclease map in Fig. 3A Similarly, XcmI digestion of hGSTP1*C cDNA (lane 9) yielded the expected 224- and 260-bp fragments. In contrast to the specimens that expressed only one GST Pi gene variant, specimens expressing two different GST Pi genes yielded, upon digestion of their cDNAs with MaeII or XcmI, restriction fragments representative of the mixture of mRNAs. Thus, cDNA from specimens that express a mixture of hGSTP1*A and hGSTP1*B genes (lane 5) is partially restricted by MaeII and is unrestricted by XcmI. On the other hand, cDNAs from specimens expressing a mixture of hGSTP1"

The cDNA encodes the predicted protein of 572 amino acid residues with 12 putative membrane-spanning domains. The amino acid sequence has moderate homology with a nonspecific peptide transporter found in the plant. When expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, PHT1 cRNA induced high affinity proton-dependent histidine transport activity. This transport process was inhibited by dipeptides and tripeptides but not by free amino acids such as glutamate, glycine, leucine, methionine, and aspartate. Dipeptide carnosine transport activity was also confirmed by direct uptake measurement. By in situ hybridization analysis, PHT1 mRNA was widely distributed throughout whole brain. Especially, intense hybridization signals were found in the hippocampus, choroid plexus, cerebellum, and pontine nucleus. Signals were located in both the neuronal and small nonneuronal cells in these areas. PHT1 protein could contribute to uptake of oligopeptides, which function as neuromodulators, and clearance of degraded neuropeptides and be a new member in the growing superfamily of proton-coupled peptide and nitrate transporters, although its structure, localization, and pharmacological characteristics are unique among these members."
https://openalex.org/W2156654096,"Ras proteins are small GTP-binding proteins which are critical for cell signaling and proliferation. Four Ras isoforms exist: Ha-Ras, N-Ras, Ki-Ras4A, and Ki-Ras4B. The carboxyl termini of all four isoforms are post-translationally modified by farnesyl protein transferase (FPT). Prenylation is required for oncogenic Ras to transform cells. Recently, it was reported that Ki-Ras4B is also an in vitro substrate for the related enzyme geranylgeranyl protein transferase-1 (GGPT-1) (James, G. L., Goldstein, J. L., and Brown, M. S. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 6221-6226). In the current studies, we compared the four isoforms of Ras as substrates for FPT and GGPT-1. The affinity of FPT for Ki-Ras4B (Km = 30 nM) is 10-20-fold higher than that for the other Ras isoforms. Consistent with this, when the different Ras isoforms are tested at equimolar concentrations, it requires 10-20-fold higher levels of CAAX-competitive compounds to inhibit Ki-Ras4B farnesylation. Additionally, we found that, as reported for Ki-Ras4B, N-Ras and Ki-Ras4A are also in vitro substrates for GGPT-1. Of the Ras isoforms, N-Ras is the highest affinity substrate for GGPT-1 and is similar in affinity to a standard GGPT-1 substrate terminating in leucine. However, the catalytic efficiencies of these geranylgeranylation reactions are between 15- and 140-fold lower than the corresponding farnesylation reactions, largely reflecting differences in affinity. Carboxyl-terminal peptides account for many of the properties of the Ras proteins. One interesting exception is that, unlike the full-length N-Ras protein, a carboxyl-terminal N-Ras peptide is not a GGPT-1 substrate, raising the possibility that upstream sequences in this protein may play a role in its recognition by GGPT-1. Studies with various carboxyl-terminal peptides from Ki-Ras4B suggest that both the carboxyl-terminal methionine and the upstream polylysine region are important determinants for geranylgeranylation. Furthermore, it was found that full-length Ki-Ras4B, but not other Ras isoforms, can be geranylgeranylated in vitro by FPT. These findings suggest that the different distribution of Ras isoforms and the ability of cells to alternatively process these proteins may explain in part the resistance of some cell lines to FPT inhibitors.

https://openalex.org/W2062083574,"Phosphorylation of PHAS-I by mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase in vitro decreased PHAS-I binding to eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)-4E. The decrease in binding lagged behind the phosphorylation of PHAS-I in Ser64, the preferred site of MAP kinase. Binding of the Ala64 mutant of PHAS-I to eIF-4E was abolished by MAP kinase, indicating that phosphorylation of sites other than Ser64 control binding. To identify such sites, PHAS-I was phosphorylated with MAP kinase and [γ-32P]ATP and then cleaved proteolytically before the resulting phosphopeptides were isolated by reverse phase chromatography and directly identified by amino acid sequencing. Phosphorylated residues were located by determining the cycles in which 32P was released when phosphopeptides were subjected to sequential Edman degradation. With an extended incubation in vitro, MAP kinase phosphorylated Thr36, Thr45, Ser64, Thr69, and Ser82. In rat adipocytes, the phosphorylation of all five sites was increased by insulin and decreased by rapamycin although there were differences in the magnitude of the effects. A form of PHAS-I phosphorylated exclusively in Thr36 remained bound to eIF-4E, indicating that phosphorylation of Thr36 is insufficient for dissociation of the PHAS-I·eIF-4E complex. In summary, our results indicate that multiple phosphorylation sites are involved in the control of PHAS-I. All five sites identified fit a (Ser/Thr)-Pro motif, suggesting that the phosphorylation of PHAS-I in cells is mediated by a proline-directed protein kinase.

Insulin and growth factors act within minutes to stimulate protein synthesis (1Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Google Scholar, 2Proud C.G. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1992; 32: 243-369Google Scholar). This rapid response is due to activation of mRNA translation and involves phosphorylation of multiple translation factors. One of these factors is PHAS-I (also known as 4EBP-1) (3Hu C. Pang S. Kong X. Velleca M. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3730-3734Google Scholar, 4Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.-C. Donzé O. Lin T.-A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Google Scholar), a protein of Mr≈ 12,500 that was first identified in 32P-labeled adipocytes as a heat- and acid-stable species that was markedly phosphorylated in response to insulin (5Denton R.M. Brownsey R.W. Belsham G.J. Diabetologia. 1981; 21: 347-362Google Scholar). PHAS-I is now known to be expressed in a wide variety of cell types and to act as a regulator of eIF-4E, the mRNA cap-binding protein (6Lawrence Jr., J.C. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lin T.-A. Weber G. Advances in Enzyme Regulation. Elsevier Science Ltd., 1997Google Scholar, 7Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 245-269Google Scholar). eIF-4E is one of the least abundant of the known translation factors (8Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3017-3020Google Scholar, 9Sonenberg N. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 839-846Google Scholar), and the amount of eIF-4E is believed to be limiting for initiation, which is generally the rate-limiting phase of protein synthesis (1Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Google Scholar, 2Proud C.G. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1992; 32: 243-369Google Scholar). Thus, increasing eIF-4E in cells increases mRNA translation, particularly of those messages which possess a high degree of secondary structure in their 5′-untranslated regions (10Koromilas A.E. Lazaris-Karatzas A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4153-4158Google Scholar). eIF-4E is a key component of the eIF-4F complex, which catalyzes melting of secondary structure in the 5′-untranslated region of the mRNA and allows efficient binding and/or scanning by the 40 S ribosomal subunit (1Hershey J.W.B.

Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 839-846Google Scholar). eIF-4F contains two other subunits, eIF-4A, an ATP-dependent helicase, and eIF-4G, a relatively large subunit that binds to both eIF-4A and eIF-4E (1Hershey J.W.B.

Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4990-4997Google Scholar). Consequently, increasing PHAS-I inhibits cap-dependent mRNA translation both in vitro and in intact cells (4Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.-C. Donzé O. Lin T.-A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Google Scholar). However, when PHAS-I is phosphorylated in response to insulin or certain growth factors, the PHAS-I·eIF-4E complex dissociates (6Lawrence Jr., J.C. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lin T.-A. Weber G.

Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 245-269Google Scholar), thereby increasing eIF-4E available to bind to eIF-4G. Increasing the eIF-4F complex by this mechanism provides an explanation of the preferential stimulation by insulin of the translation of messages, such as ornithine decarboxylase, which have a high degree of secondary structure in their 5′-untranslated region (14Manzella J.M.

Samples (160 μg/ml) of PHAS-I, [H6]PHAS-I, or [H6]PHAS-IAla64 were incubated at 23°C in a solution containing activated MAP kinase (34Scott A. Haystead C.M.M. Haystead T.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24540-24547Google Scholar) (62 μg/ml), 1 mM dithiothreitol, 200 μM [γ-32P]ATP (500-1000 cpm/pmol), 10 mM MgCl2, and 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The reactions were stopped by heating at 95°C for 5 min. Samples of [H6]PHAS-I and [H6]PHAS-IAla64 used in far-Western analyses of FLAG-4E binding (described later) were phosphorylated in parallel incubations with unlabeled ATP, and the reactions were stopped by adding SDS sample buffer. [32P]PHAS-I samples (300 μl) from either in vitro phosphorylation reactions or immunoprecipitated from 32P-labeled adipocytes were incubated at 37°C for 15 h with lysyl endopeptidase (17 μg/ml). The digests were acidified by adding 30 μl of 1% trifluoroacetic acid solution and applied at 30°C to a reverse phase column (Waters Nova-Pak C18, 3.9 × 150 mm) that had been equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (Buffer A). The flow rate was maintained at 1 ml/min. The column was washed for 5 min with Buffer A before peptides were eluted with a linear gradient of acetonitrile (0-60% in 120 min) produced by increasing the proportion of Buffer B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile). Fractions (1 ml) were collected, and peptides containing 32P were identified by measuring Cerenkov emissions. A second digestion was required to resolve phosphorylation sites present in phosphopeptides in fractions 62 through 72. These fractions were pooled and evaporated to dryness before the peptides were dissolved in 250 μl of solution containing 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1% hydrogenated Triton X-100 (Calbiochem), and 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The samples were incubated for 15 h at 37°C with chymotrypsin (5 μg) and then acidified by adding 25 μl of 1% trifluoroacetic acid before peptides were resolved by reverse phase HPLC as described above. The 32P-labeled peptides generated by phosphorylating recombinant PHAS-I with [γ-32P]ATP and MAP kinase were identified by using a vapor phase amino acid sequencer (Applied Biosystems Procise 494). Phosphorylated residues within phosphopeptides were located by determining the cycles in which 32P was released when samples were subjected to sequential Edman degradation under conditions that optimize recovery of 32P (35Russo G.L.

Protein samples were subjected to electrophoresis in 20% polyacrylamide gels in the presence of SDS by using the method of Laemmli (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Dried gels were exposed to film to enable detection of 32P-labeled PHAS-I, and bands containing the protein were excised. The amounts of 32P in the gel slices were determined by measuring Cerenkov emissions. Binding of PHAS-I proteins to eIF-4E was assessed by far-Western blotting performed using a 32P-labeled recombinant eIF-4E fusion protein (FLAG-4E) as described previously (17Lin T.-A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30199-30204Google Scholar). Phosphoamino acid analyses were performed by subjecting samples of phosphopeptides that had been purified by reverse phase HPLC to limited hydrolysis (5.7 N HCl for 2 h at 110°C) (37Geer P. Luo K. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Hardie D.G. Protein Phosphorylation: A Practical Approach. University Press, Oxford1994: 31-59Google Scholar). After removing the acid under vacuum, samples were subjected to high voltage electrophoresis at pH 1.9, which provides superior separation of phosphoserine and phosphothreonine. The fact that phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine are not resolved at this pH was not a problem as PHAS-I from adipocytes is not phosphorylated on tyrosyl residues (27Blackshear P.J. Nemenoff R.A. Avruch J. Biochem. J. 1983; 214: 11-19Google Scholar, 28Blackshear P.J. Nemenoff R.A. Avruch J. Biochem. J. 1982; 204: 817-824Google Scholar, 29Diggle T.A. Denton R.M. Biochem.

PHAS-I contains seven Ser/Thr-Pro motifs that represent potential sites of phosphorylation by MAP kinase (Fig. 1), the most effective of the protein kinases that have been found to phosphorylate PHAS-I in vitro (6Lawrence Jr., J.C.

In previous experiments Ser64 was identified as the preferred site of phosphorylation by MAP kinase (24Haystead T.A.J. Haystead C.M.M. Hu C. Lin T.-A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23185-23191Google Scholar). However, with extended incubation with MAP kinase, the stoichiometry of PHAS-I phosphorylation exceeded 1 mol/mol (24Haystead T.A.J. Haystead C.M.M. Hu C. Lin T.-A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23185-23191Google Scholar), and some phosphorylation of an Ala64 mutant PHAS-I was observed (11Lin T.-A. Kong X. Haystead T.A.J. Pause A. Belsham G. Sonenberg N. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Science. 1994; 266: 653-656Google Scholar), indicating that MAP kinase phosphorylated more than one site in PHAS-I. Results from peptide mapping experiments provide further evidence of multisite phosphorylation (Fig. 2). Three peaks of 32P-labeled peptides, designated LE-P2, LE-P3, and LE-P4 in order of elution, were resolved when a sample of recombinant [H6]PHAS-I that had been phosphorylated in a 10-min incubation with [γ-32P]ATP and MAP kinase was digested with lysine endopeptidase and subjected to reverse phase HPLC (Fig. 2A, inset). LE-P2 was completely absent in digests of [H6]PHAS-IAla64 that had been phosphorylated by MAP kinase, indicating that LE-P2 represents the 32P-labeled Ser64 phosphopeptide. After 2 h with MAP kinase, relatively more 32P was found in sites in LE-P3 plus LE-P4 than in Ser64 (Fig. 2A). 3The Ser64 phosphopeptide contains a cysteine residue, which may be oxidized to cysteic acid. Partial oxidation of this residue was previously shown to account for the resolution of two peaks of a comparable Ser64 phosphopeptide (24Haystead T.A.J. Haystead C.M.M. Hu C. Lin T.-A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23185-23191Google Scholar). In addition, a relatively small peak, LE-P1, eluting very early in the acetonitrile gradient was observed. The phosphorylation of other sites by MAP kinase was more pronounced in Fig. 2 than in our previous studies (11Lin T.-A. Kong X. Haystead T.A.J. Pause A. Belsham G. Sonenberg N. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Science. 1994; 266: 653-656Google Scholar, 24Haystead T.A.J. Haystead C.M.M. Hu C. Lin T.-A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23185-23191Google Scholar) because approximately 10-fold higher concentrations of MAP kinase were used in the present experiments. However, consistent with previous findings (11Lin T.-A. Kong X. Haystead T.A.J. Pause A. Belsham G. Sonenberg N. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Science. 1994; 266: 653-656Google Scholar, 24Haystead T.A.J. Haystead C.M.M. Hu C. Lin T.-A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23185-23191Google Scholar), the initial rate of phosphorylation of Ser64 (LE-P2) occurred more rapidly than the initial rate of phosphorylation of the other sites (Fig. 3A), which were phosphorylated at least as rapidly in the Ala64 mutant as in the wild-type protein (Fig. 3B).Fig. 2Resolution of [32P]phosphopeptides generated by lysyl endopeptidase digestions of PHAS-I proteins phosphorylated in vitro by MAP kinase.

The results represent the amount of 32P recovered in fractions (1 ml), which were collected each min. B, LE-P3 and LE-P4 fractions derived from [H6]PHAS-I that had been incubated for 2 h with MAP kinase in a separate experiment were pooled and incubated with chymotrypsin. The resulting [32P]phosphopeptides were isolated by reverse phase HPLC. The results represent the amount of 32P recovered in each fraction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 3Phosphorylation of Ser64 does not correlate with the loss of PHAS-I binding to eIF-4E. [H6]PHAS-I and [H6]PHAS-IAla64 were incubated for increasing times with MAP kinase before incubations were terminated. A, incubations were conducted with [γ-32P]ATP before samples of 32P-labeled [H6]PHAS-I were digested with lysyl endopeptidase, and the resulting [32P]phosphopeptides were resolved by HPLC as described in Fig. 2. 32P incorporated into Ser64 (•) or other sites (▪) were determined from radioactivity present in LE-P2 or the other peaks, respectively. B, samples of [H6]PHAS-IAla64 were processed as described for [H6]PHAS-I before 32P incorporated into sites other than Ser64 (□) were determined. C, incubations with MAP kinase were conducted with unlabeled ATP before reactions were terminated, and samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE. eIF-4E binding activities were determined by far-Western blotting with 32P-labeled FLAG-4E. The relative amounts of 32P-labeled FLAG-4E bound to [H6]PHAS-I (♦) or [H6]PHAS-IAla64 (▵) were determined by phosphoimaging. The results are expressed as percentages of the 32P-labeled FLAG-4E bound to PHAS proteins that had not been incubated with MAP kinase. The inset shows binding to [H6]PHAS-I and [H6]PHAS-IAla64 prior to incubation with MAP kinase and after a 120-min incubation with the kinase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The influence of Ser64 and other sites on eIF-4E binding was assessed by far-Western blotting using a 32P-labeled FLAG-4E. MAP kinase markedly decreased binding of [H6]PHAS-I to FLAG-4E (Fig. 3C, inset). However, the initial rate of decline in eIF-4E binding activity (Fig. 3C) produced by MAP kinase did not correlate well with the initial rate of Ser64 phosphorylation (Fig. 3A). For instance, almost no decrease in eIF-4E binding was observed after 5 min of incubation with MAP kinase, even though over half of the Ser64 in PHAS-I had been phosphorylated. The decrease in binding activity correlated much better with the phosphorylation of sites recovered in LE-P2 and LE-P3, indicating that phosphorylation of sites other than Ser64 control binding of PHAS-I to eIF-4E. Findings with [H6]PHAS-IAla64 provide additional support for this interpretation. The initial decrease in eIF-4E binding activity produced by phosphorylation of the mutant protein occurred with a time course that was similar to that obtained with [H6]PHAS-I (Fig. 3C), and extended incubation with MAP kinase abolished binding of the mutant PHAS-I to FLAG-4E (Fig. 3C, inset). The first approach to identify the sites other than Ser64 was to attempt to identify the phosphopeptides derived from lysyl endopeptidase digests of PHAS-I. Except for the 4-amino acid peptide that would result from cleavage at Lys68 and Lys72, all of the predicted peptides contain at least 12 amino acids (Fig. 1) and would be expected to elute relatively late in the acetonitrile gradient. For this reason, the 4-amino acid peptide containing Thr69 was considered the most likely candidate for LE-P1. Phosphoamino acid analysis supported this assignment, as LE-P1 was found to contain phosphothreonine but little if any phosphoserine.2 Amino acid sequencing indicated that the peptide contained Pro residues in the second and third positions (Fig. 4). Other than the Thr69 peptide, the only two other occurrences of adjacent prolines in PHAS-I are Pro29-Pro30 and Pro88-Pro89 (Fig. 1). Determining the position of the phosphorylated residue within the LE-P1 phosphopeptide solidified the assigment of Thr69 as the phosphorylation site. This was accomplished in a separate sequencing run, where the 32P in LE-P1 was found to be released in cycle 1 (Fig. 4). Even without the sequence data, finding release in the first cycle with a peptide generated by lysyl endopeptidase would be indicative of Thr69 as this residue is the only Ser or Thr adjacent to a Lys in PHAS-I (Fig. 1).

To elucidate the mechanism underlying this process, we investigated the effect of S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), a nitric oxide-releasing agent, on the smooth muscle cell cycle. When G0 cells were stimulated with fetal bovine serum and basic fibroblast growth factor, DNA synthesis assessed by [3H]thymidine incorporation started about 15 h later. SNAP dose-dependently inhibited this incorporation, and this effect was maximal at 100 μM. This inhibition was attenuated when SNAP was added after 9-12 h. SNAP inhibited the activity of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) and phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein, both of which usually increased from about 9 h, whereas it did not inhibit the activities of cyclin D-associated kinase(s), Cdk4, and Cdk6, which normally increased from 0-3 h. Although SNAP reduced the mRNA levels of cyclins E and A, it neither reduced their protein levels nor impaired their association with Cdk2. SNAP did not reduce the mRNA levels of cyclins G, C, and D1, Cdk2, Cdk4, and Cdk5, which were normally elevated from 0-3 h. The mRNA and protein levels of the Cdk inhibitor p21 were high in the early G1 phase, peaking at 3 h and then rapidly decreasing after 6 h. In the presence of SNAP, however, p21 expression was enhanced, and moreover, the later decrease disappeared. SNAP also increased the amount of Cdk2-associated p21.

We observed that the UV sensitivity of a panel of SCLC lines and the activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNKs) by UV in the individual SCLC lines, assessed by binding and phosphorylation of glutathione S-transferase (GST)-c-Jun fusion proteins, ranged widely. In fact, increased JNK activity in this assay was closely correlated with decreased sensitivity to apoptosis following UV irradiation.

Emerging evidence suggests that the sensitivity of tumor cells such as SCLC to ionizing radiation and cytotoxic drugs is not related to their rapid rate of cell division, but to the ability of these cell stresses to induce programmed cell death, or apoptosis, relative to growth arrest of untransformed cells (5Fisher D.E. Cell. 1994; 78: 539-542Google Scholar). However, as with many cancers, selection for SCLC tumor cells that are relatively resistant to the cytotoxic insult frequently occurs and is followed by relapse, translating to a cure rate of 10% or less.

Recent advances in the understanding of cellular responses to cytotoxic stresses such as ionizing and UV radiation, tumor necrosis factor-α, heat shock, and toxic drugs have defined the regulation of a protein kinase signaling cascade that targets specific transcription factors including c-Jun, c-Fos, ATF-2, and NFκB (9Buscher M.

Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 269: 403-407Google Scholar). UV irradiation is the prototypical activator of this highly conserved cellular pathway referred to as the UV response (16Engelberg D. Klein C. Martinetto H. Struhl K. Karin M. Cell. 1994; 77: 381-390Google Scholar). Transactivation of genes by c-Jun and ATF-2 is achieved by phosphorylation by specific mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase family members, the stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs), or c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNKs) (12Gupta S.

Molecular cloning has defined three genes encoding rodent SAPK or human JNK enzymes, and alternative splicing of the mRNAs yields as many as 12 distinct enzymes (19Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P.

Sci. 1995; 766: 303-319Google Scholar). In a manner parallel to that previously defined for the related extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) or p42/44 MAP kinases (23Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-122Google Scholar), the JNKs are activated following their phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine by dual specificity MAP kinase kinases (24Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.-H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Google Scholar). While DNA damage is often a consequence of exposure to agents that stimulate the UV response, the regulation of JNKs and NFκB proceeds normally in enucleated cells (11Devary Y. Rosette C. DiDonato J.A. Karin M. Science. 1993; 261: 1442-1445Google Scholar), indicating that DNA damage is not the initiating signal. In fact, the Ras and Rho families of low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins, which integrate signaling via a host of extracellular signals, play a role in mediating the UV response in mammalian cells and yeast (11Devary Y. Rosette C. DiDonato J.A. Karin M. Science. 1993; 261: 1442-1445Google Scholar, 16Engelberg D. Klein C. Martinetto H. Struhl K. Karin M. Cell. 1994; 77: 381-390Google Scholar). This finding further supports the notion that the UV-induced transcriptional activation through JNK protein kinase cascades is independent of DNA damage and is probably initiated at the plasma membrane. Studies suggest that the UV response serves a protective role in lower organisms such as yeasts (16Engelberg D. Klein C. Martinetto H. Struhl K. Karin M. Cell. 1994; 77: 381-390Google Scholar). Yet, the functional significance of the UV response in mammalian cells is unclear. Ras-transformed mammalian cells are often more resistant to UV and ionizing radiation (25Sklar M.D. Science. 1988; 239: 645-647Google Scholar, 26Suzuki K. Watanabe M. Miyoshi J. Radiat. Res. 1992; 129: 157-162Google Scholar). However, the profound and rapid activation of JNKs by many cytotoxic stimuli suggests that the JNKs may, in fact, initiate cell death in mammalian cells rather than a protective response. Support for this possibility is provided by findings that MAP kinase/ERK kinase kinase, which has recently been defined as a proximal activator of the JNK pathway (27Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Google Scholar), can induce apoptosis when expressed in fibroblast cell lines (28Johnson N.L. Gardner A.M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 3229-3237Google Scholar), and cellular expression of molecular inhibitors of the JNK pathway reduces the induction of apoptosis (29Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X.-H. Yar B. Jarvis W.D.

To investigate the role of the JNK pathway in SCLC, we examined the influence of UV irradiation on induction of cell death and signal transduction through JNKs in a panel of cultured SCLC lines. Recombinant GST-c-Jun(1–79) and ATF2-NT(1–254) were expressed in bacteria and purified using glutathione agarose (Sigma) and Ni+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Studio City, CA), respectively, as described previously (17Hibi M.

The rabbit polyclonal antibodies to JNK-1 (C-17), p38 MAP kinase (C-20), ERK1 (C-16), and ERK2 (C-14) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The mouse monoclonal antibody directed against the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope (12CA5), dUTP-fluorescein, and terminal deoxytransferase were from Boehringer Mannheim. Protein A- and protein G-Sepharose were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. NCI-H345 and H187 cells were cultured in HITES medium (RPMI 1640 containing 10 nM hydrocortisone, 5 μg/ml insulin, 10 μg/ml transferrin, 10 nM 17β-estradiol, 30 nM sodium selenite, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin). SCLC lines N417, SHP-77, and H69 were routinely cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cell lines H69, H187, and H345 exhibit features of classic SCLC (1Carney D.N. Gazdar A.F. Bepler G. Guccion J.G. Marangos P.J. Moody T.W. Zweig M.H. Minna J.D. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 2913-2923Google Scholar), whereas N417 is a variant SCLC line (1Carney D.N. Gazdar A.F. Bepler G.

Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. For experiments examining the influence of UV irradiation on cell growth and signaling, suspensions (2 ml) of SCLC cells in HITES medium were placed in 6-cm plastic tissue culture plates and irradiated uncovered with a Mineralight R-52G (UVP, Inc., San Gabriel, CA) short wave UV lamp. The radiance of the lamp at 254 ± 20 nm at a distance of 2 inches was 3.2 J/m2/s. Following irradiation, the cells were incubated at 37°C for the indicated times in a CO2 incubator. For determination of cell counts, SCLC cell suspensions were mixed with an equal volume of 0.4% trypan blue in 0.85% NaCl, and cells excluding dye were counted with a hemocytometer. Swiss 3T3 cells were similarly counted after trypsinization. The cDNAs (18Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J.

Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8376-8384Google Scholar) encoding HA-JNK1-APF and HA-JNK2-APF were ligated between the HindIII and HpaI sites of pLNCX (34Miller A.D. Rosman G.J. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 980-990Google Scholar) and packaged into replication-defective retrovirus using 293T cells and the retrovirus component-expression plasmids SV-Ψ−-A-MLV and SV-Ψ−-env−-MLV as described previously (35Landau N.R. Littman D.R. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5110-5113Google Scholar, 36Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Google Scholar). Conditioned growth medium containing secreted retrovirus was collected, supplemented with 8 μg/ml polybrene, filtered through a 0.45-μm filter, and incubated with the indicated SCLC lines for 24 h. SCLC cells expressing the retrovirus-encoded cDNAs were selected for growth in medium containing G418, and pooled cultures of G418-resistant cells were used for the described studies. Following UV irradiation (96 J/m2) as described above, the SCLC cultures were returned to the CO2 incubator for 24 h. Aliquots (1.5 ml) of control and irradiated cultures of SCLC were centrifuged (500 × g, 5 min) and washed once in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cells were fixed for 15 min in PBS containing 1.5% paraformaldehyde and 1.5% sucrose and then washed with 1 ml of PBS and then with 250 μl of terminal deoxytransferase buffer (25 mM Tris-Cl (pH 6.6 at 25°C), 200 mM potassium cacodylate, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). The cell pellets were finally suspended in 50 μl of terminal deoxytransferase buffer containing 1.5 mM CoCl2, 3 μM fluorescein-dUTP, and 5 units of terminal deoxytransferase and incubated for 2 h at 37°C. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 20 mM EDTA and the labeled cells were collected by centrifugation, washed once with PBS, and resuspended in 50 μl of PBS. The cells were immobilized onto coverslips precoated with Cell-Tak (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA) and viewed at × 60 magnification with a fluorescence microscope. Twenty-four and forty-eight hours later, aliquots of control and UV-irradiated cultures containing ∼200,000 cells were centrifuged (5 min, 1000 × g), and the cell pellets were gently suspended in 100 μl of PBS. The cells were fixed by addition of 400 μl of methanol and stained for 15 min with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml). The cells were again collected by centrifugation, suspended in PBS containing 50% glycerol, and mounted under glass coverslips. Slides were viewed and photographed on a fluorescence microscope. SCLC cells were collected by centrifugation and lysed for 30 min at 4°C in 0.5 ml of 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.7), 20 mMβ-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mM sodium vanadate, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.3 M NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 4 μg/ml aprotinin as described elsewhere (17Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Google Scholar). Following a 5-min microcentrifugation (10,000 × g), aliquots of the extracts containing 200 μg of protein were incubated for 2 h at 4°C with GST-c-Jun(1–79) immobilized to glutathione-agarose (10 μl of packed beads per sample containing ∼10 μg of protein). The GST-c-Jun(1–79)-agarose complexes were washed three times by repetitive centrifugation in 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.7), 50 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.05% Triton X-100, and then incubated for 20 min at 30°C in 40 μl of 50 mMβ-glycerophosphate (pH 7.6), 0.1 mM sodium vanadate, 10 mM MgCl2, 20 μM [γ-32P]ATP (25,000 cpm/pmol). The reactions were terminated with 10 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled, and submitted to 12% SDS-PAGE. The GST-c-Jun(1–79) polypeptides were identified in Coomassie-stained gels, excised, and counted in a scintillation counter. SCLC cultures were collected by centrifugation and lysed in MAP kinase lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mMβ-glycerophosphate (pH 7.2), 0.1 mM sodium vanadate, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 4 μg/ml aprotinin). Clarified extracts containing 200 μg of protein were incubated (4°C, 2 h) with 1 μg of anti-JNK1, 1 μg of anti-p38 MAP kinase, or 1 μg each of anti-ERK1 and anti-ERK2 and 10 μl of packed protein A-Sepharose in a total volume of 0.5 ml. The immune complexes were washed three times in lysis buffer and then suspended in 40 μl of 50 mMβ-glycerophosphate (pH 7.2), 0.1 mM sodium vanadate, 10 mM MgCl2, 100 μM [γ-32P]ATP (5000 cpm/pmol), 25 μg/ml IP-20 (TTYADFIASGRTGRRNAIHD), 1 mM EGTA, and either 100 μg/ml ATF2-NT, an excellent substrate for JNKs and p38 MAP kinase (12Gupta S. Campbell D. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Google Scholar), or 200 μM EGFR662-681 peptide for analysis of ERK activity (37Heasley L.E. Storey B. Fanger G.R. Zamarripa J. Maue R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 648-656Google Scholar). Following a 20-min incubation at 30°C, the ATF2 kinase reactions were terminated with 10 μl of SDS sample buffer and submitted to SDS-PAGE. The ATF2 polypeptides were excised from the Coomassie-stained and dried gels, and incorporated radioactivity was determined in a scintillation counter. The EGFR662-681 peptide kinase reactions were terminated with 10 μl of 25% trichloroacetic acid, and phosphorylated peptide was quantified by P81 binding as described previously (37Heasley L.E. Storey B. Fanger G.R. Zamarripa J. Maue R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 648-656Google Scholar). Samples were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The filters were blocked in Tris-buffered saline (10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 140 mM NaCl) containing 0.1% Tween-20 (TTBS) and 3% nonfat dry milk and then incubated with blocking solution containing the indicated antibodies at 1 μg/ml for 12-16 h. The filters were extensively washed in TTBS, and bound antibodies were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-coupled protein A or horseradish peroxidase-coupled sheep anti-mouse antibodies and ECL (Amersham Corp.) according to the manufacturer's directions. The radiosensitivity of SCLC is well established, and the survival of a variety of SCLC lines following ionizing radiation has been previously compared (2Carney D.N. Mitchell J.B. Kinsella T.J. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 2806-2811Google Scholar, 4Carmichael J. DeGraff W.G. Gamson J. Russo D. Gazdar A.F. Levitt M.L. Minna J.D. Mitchell J.B. Eur. J. Cancer Clin. Oncol. 1989; 25: 527-534Google Scholar). The growth and viability of control SCLC line H345 or cultures irradiated with a UV-C (200 to 290 nM) source at intensities of 32 or 192 J/m2 is shown in Fig. 1A After 4 days in culture, the density of control H345 cultures increased 3-fold, while cultures of H345 cells UV-irradiated at 32 J/m2 failed to grow. In fact, cell number decreased slightly, suggesting limited cell death. UV irradiation of H345 cells at 192 J/m2 resulted, after a lag of approximately 24 h, in a progressive and marked decrease in cell number below the initial cell density, such that less than 5% of the irradiated cells were viable as assessed by trypan blue exclusion after 4 days of culture. Examination of the dose dependence of UV-induced cell killing of five independent SCLC lines and Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts was performed (Fig. 1B). UV irradiation at intensities ranging from 6 to 192 J/m2 resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in viable cells measured 4 days later compared with untreated controls in all the cell lines tested. Notably, the SCLC lines were more sensitive to UV-induced cell killing than Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts at UV intensities of 16-64 J/m2, consistent with the known sensitivity of SCLC to ionizing radiation (2Carney D.N. Mitchell J.B. Kinsella T.J. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 2806-2811Google Scholar, 3Carmichael J. Mitchell J.B. DeGraff W.G. Gamson J. Gazdar A.F. Johnson B.E. Glatstein E. Minna J.D. Br. J. Cancer. 1985; 57: 540-547Google Scholar, 4Carmichael J. DeGraff W.G. Gamson J. Russo D. Gazdar A.F. Levitt M.L. Minna J.D. Mitchell J.B. Eur. J. Cancer Clin. Oncol. 1989; 25: 527-534Google Scholar). Among the SCLC lines, H187 was the most sensitive to UV-induced killing such that less than 50% of the cells survived the lowest UV intensity tested, 6 J/m2 (Fig. 1B). H69 was somewhat more resistant and H345 cells were significantly more resistant to UV-C-induced killing than were H187 cells, but were still highly sensitive compared with cell lines SHP-77 and N417. H187, H69, and H345 cells exhibit features of classic SCLC, while SHP-77 and N417 cells express elevated c-Myc and/or lack of detectable neuropeptide autocrine loops, features indicative of the variant SCLC phenotype (1Carney D.N. Gazdar A.F. Bepler G. Guccion J.G. Marangos P.J. Moody T.W. Zweig M.H. Minna J.D. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 2913-2923Google Scholar). Significantly, H69, H187, H345, and N417 have been previously examined for sensitivity to ionizing radiation, and a similar order of sensitivity to ionizing radiation was observed (2Carney D.N. Mitchell J.B. Kinsella T.J. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 2806-2811Google Scholar, 4Carmichael J. DeGraff W.G. Gamson J. Russo D. Gazdar A.F. Levitt M.L. Minna J.D. Mitchell J.B. Eur. J. Cancer Clin. Oncol. 1989; 25: 527-534Google Scholar). The time-dependent decrease in viable cell number following UV irradiation was suggestive of apoptosis, which is defined as cell death that is physiologically regulated and is characterized morphologically by DNA breakage and nuclear condensation (38Kroemer G. Petit P. Zamzami N. Vayssiere J.-L. Mignotte B. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1277-1287Google Scholar). Induction of DNA breaks following UV was assessed by terminal deoxytransferase-mediated labeling of nuclei with fluorescein-dUTP (Fig. 2). The terminal deoxytransferase assay resulted in the labeling of ∼1-5% of a control untreated suspension of H345 cells, while ∼50% of H345 cells were labeled when assayed 24 h after UV irradiation (96 J/m2). Pronounced condensation of chromatin, another feature of apoptosis, was assessed by microscopic inspection of UV-irradiated SCLC lines H187 and N417 that had been fixed and then stained with the DNA dye, propidium iodide. The results from these experiments revealed marked nuclear condensation that was apparent 24 h after UV irradiation (Fig. 3). Forty-eight hours after exposure to UV radiation (96 J/m2), greater than 95% of the H187 cell nuclei were highly condensed relative to the nuclei observed in untreated control cells. Compared with H187 cells, fewer N417 cells (∼50%) exhibited condensed nuclei 2 days after UV irradiation, consistent with the decreased sensitivity of N417 cells to UV-induced cell death shown in Fig. 1B Thus, the data indicate that UV irradiation induces cell death of five independent SCLC lines with variable efficacy and that the response occurs by apoptosis.Fig. 3Nuclear condensation in UV-irradiated SCLC cells. SCLC lines H187 and N417 were UV-irradiated (96 J/m2), and 24 and 48 h later, cells were fixed, stained with propidium iodide, and photographed with a fluorescence microscope as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Note the progressive appearance of cells with highly condensed nuclei 24 and 48 h after irradiation. The experiment shown is representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) An understanding of the molecular regulation of the JNK/SAPKs initiated by cell stresses such as UV radiation has recently emerged. To examine the regulation of JNKs by UV in the panel of SCLC lines, an assay was employed in which the JNKs are adsorbed to a glutathione agarose-immobilized GST fusion protein encoding the NH2-terminal 79 amino acids of the transcription factor c-Jun and then assayed for phosphotransferase activity toward the resident GST-c-Jun(1–79) polypeptide (17Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments in which H345 cells were UV-irradiated at 96 J/m2 indicated that protein kinase activity collected with GST-c-Jun(1–79) increased rapidly following irradiation and was maximal by 10–30 min of incubation following the UV exposure. Furthermore, this JNK activity was sustained for at least 2 h, the longest time point examined. The UV dose response for activation of the GST-c-Jun-binding JNKs was determined in the five SCLC lines (Fig. 4A). SCLC lines H187 and H69, which are the most sensitive to UV-induced cell death (Fig. 1B), exhibited a modest 2-4-fold activation of protein kinase activity at a UV dose of 192 J/m2. In comparison, N417 and SHP-77, which are the most UV-resistant of the SCLC lines, exhibited marked UV-stimulated GST-c-Jun kinase activity. Note that a 5-10-fold activation was observed with N417 at a UV intensity of only 16 J/m2. Finally, H345 cells, which are of intermediate sensitivity to UV irradiation (Fig. 1B), exhibited an intermediate UV-stimulated JNK activation. When the UV-induced GST-c-Jun kinase activation observed at 64 J/m2 (Fig. 4A) was compared with the fraction of cells surviving the same UV dose (Fig. 1B), an excellent correlation was observed (r2 = 0.93, slope very significantly (p < 0.01) different from zero). Thus, the data in Figs. 1B and 4A reveal that the fold stimulation of a UV-regulated, GST-c-Jun-binding protein kinase activity correlates with the relative resistance of the SCLC lines to UV-induced cell death. A polyclonal antiserum directed against the C terminus of the p46 JNK1 isoform was also used to measure the UV-regulated protein kinase activity in an immune complex assay. The findings (Fig. 4B) revealed a 3-8-fold stimulation of immune complex-associated protein kinase activity by UV in extracts prepared from the panel of SCLC lines. Similar analysis of ERK and p38 MAP kinases immunoprecipitated from extracts prepared from control and UV-irradiated H345 and SHP-77 cells revealed a 3.8- and 2-fold stimulation of ERKs, respectively, and a 1.1- and 2.8-fold stimulation of p38 MAP kinase, respectively. Thus, the ERK and p38 MAP kinases displayed little or no regulation by UV in SCLC, despite reports of strong regulation of p38 MAP kinase by UV in other cell types (39Raingeaud J. Gupta S.

Note that the fold stimulation by UV (96 J/m2) of anti-JNK1-precipitated protein kinase activity from H345, N417, and SHP-77 cells was significantly less than that observed in the GST-c-Jun complex assay (Fig. 4A). Also, the fold stimulations observed with the immune complex assay did not correlate with the relative resistance to UV-induced cell death (r2 = 0.04, slope is not significantly different from zero).

https://openalex.org/W1972319496,"Interleukin-4 (IL-4), an immunoregulatory cytokine secreted from activated T-helper 2 lymphocytes, eosinophils, and mast cells, stimulates the expression of a number of immune system genes via activation of the transcription factor, STAT6. However, IL-4 can concomitantly suppress the expression of other immune-related gene products, including κ light chain, FcγRI, IL-8, and E-selectin. We demonstrate that IL-4 activates STAT6 in human vascular endothelial cells and that two STAT6 binding sites are present in the promoter of the E-selectin gene. IL-4-induced STAT6 binding does not activate E-selectin transcription but instead suppresses tumor necrosis factor α-induced expression of the E-selectin gene. STAT6 was found to compete for binding to a region in the E-selectin gene promoter containing overlapping STAT6 and NF-κB binding sites, effectively acting as an antagonist of NF-κB binding and transcriptional activation. This novel mechanism for IL-4-mediated inhibition of inflammatory gene expression provides an example of a STAT factor acting as a transcriptional repressor rather than an activator.

IL-4 promotes the differentiation of premature lymphocytes to the TH2 subset, induces immunoglobulin class switching in B-lymphocytes, and is present at high levels in tissues of patients with chronic inflammatory diseases such as asthma, where it appears to play an important role in disease progression (3Moser R.

STAT proteins (Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription) are a novel family of transcription factors which mediate the biological effects of many cytokines (12Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 69-74Google Scholar). Binding of cytokines to cell surface receptors, expressed on a wide variety of cells, activates receptor-associated Janus kinases (JAKS) resulting in tyrosine phosphorylation of cytoplasmic STAT monomers and subsequent homodimerization, nuclear translocation and transactivation of genes containing STAT regulatory elements (13Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Google Scholar). STAT6 phosphorylation and activation is associated with JAK1 and JAK3 activation (14Johnston J.A. Kawamura M. Kirken R.A. Chen Y.-Q.

Paradoxically, IL-4 also suppresses the expression of many immune-related proteins. For instance, by promoting the maturation of TH2 lymphocytes, IL-4 indirectly inhibits the release of the TH1-derived inflammatory mediators, interferon-γ and IL-2 (1Paul W.E. Blood. 1991; 77: 1859-1870Google Scholar). IL-4 also directly inhibits the secretion of IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNFα), and IL-6 in monocytes (17TeVelde A.A Huijbens R.J.F. Heije K. De Vries J.E. Figdor C.G. Blood. 1990; 76: 1392-1397Google Scholar) and antagonizes many of the stimulatory actions of interferon-γ and lipopolysaccharide including metalloproteinase biosynthesis in macrophages (18Lacraz S. Nicod L. Galve de Rochemonteix B. Baumberger C. Dayer J.-M. Welgus H.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 382-388Google Scholar), IgG receptor (FcγRI/CD64) expression in monocytes (19TeVelde A.A. Huijbens R.J.F. De Vries J.E. Figdor C.G. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 3046-3051Google Scholar), and κ light chain in murine pre-B cells (20Clarke C.J.P. Taylor-Fishwick D.A. Hales A. Chernajovsky Y. Sugamura K. Feldmann M. Foxwell B.M.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 2961-2966Google Scholar). The immunosuppressing character of IL-4 has heightened interest in its use as a therapeutic agent, and clinical investigations of this cytokine are in progress (2Rocken M. Racke M. Shevach E.M. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 225-231Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms by which IL-4 suppresses gene expression are not currently understood. Such an understanding would not only provide a mechanistic appreciation of the biologic action of this cytokine but might also indicate opportunities for the rational design of pharmacologic agents with enhanced biological specificity. The endothelium presents a critical barrier between blood and surrounding tissues, thereby serving as a key component of the immune system in regulating leukocyte and macromolecular trafficking and maintaining a nonthrombotic surface (21Rubanyi G.M. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1993; 22: S1-S14Google Scholar). Proinflammatory mediators such as lipopolysaccharide, IL-1β, and TNFα stimulate the endothelium to express cell adhesion molecules such as E-selectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-8 (22Chen C.C. Manning A.M. Cytokine. 1996; 8: 58-65Google Scholar, 23Carlos T.M. Harlan J.M. Blood. 1994; 84: 2068-2101Google Scholar). Together, cell adhesion molecules and cytokines promote the adhesion and migration of leukocytes from the blood to sites of inflammation in surrounding tissues (23Carlos T.M. Harlan J.M. Blood. 1994; 84: 2068-2101Google Scholar). Lipopolysaccharide, IL-1β, and TNFα treatment of endothelium results in the activation of the transcription factor, NF-κB, which is a key regulator of cell adhesion molecule and cytokine gene expression (24Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Google Scholar). The most well studied form of NF-κB is a heterodimer composed of p50 and p65 (RelA) subunits, although homodimers and complexes comprised of additional family members are known to exist (25Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 80: 529-532Google Scholar). NF-κB is sequestered as an inactive form in the cytoplasm by the presence of an inhibitor protein, IκB, which masks the nuclear localization signal present on the p50 and p65 subunits. Activation of NF-κB requires both the phosphorylation and proteolytic degradation of IκB and results in the translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus where it can bind to specific promoter sequence elements and induce gene transcription (26Grimm S. Baeuerle P.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 297-308Google Scholar). In vascular endothelium, IL-4 differentially regulates the expression of cell adhesion molecules such as E-selectin and VCAM-1, and proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-8 (16Seidel H.M. Milocco L.H. Lamb P. Darnell J.E. Stein R. Rosen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3041-3045Google Scholar, 17TeVelde A.A Huijbens R.J.F. Heije K. De Vries J.E. Figdor C.G.

IL-4 augments the expression of VCAM-1 and IL-6 but concomitantly suppresses the expression of E-selectin and IL-8 (22Chen C.C. Manning A.M. Cytokine. 1996; 8: 58-65Google Scholar, 27Thornhill M.H. Haskard D.O. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 865-872Google Scholar, 28Iademarco M.F. Barks J.L. Dean D.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 264-271Google Scholar), thereby modulating leukocyte recruitment to sites of inflammation (19TeVelde A.A. Huijbens R.J.F. De Vries J.E. Figdor C.G. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 3046-3051Google Scholar). Treatment with IL-4 alone increases VCAM-1 protein levels via stabilization of the VCAM-1 mRNA (30Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which IL-4 suppresses E-selectin and IL-8 levels is unknown. The studies we describe in this report were designed to explore a possible role for STAT6 in the IL-4 modulation of endothelial E-selectin gene expression. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were isolated from umbilical cords and cultured as described (29Chen C.C. Rosenbloom C.L. Anderson D.C Manning A.M. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3538-3545Google Scholar). Briefly, HUVECs were plated in tissue culture flasks pretreated with 0.1% gelatin and grown in medium M199 (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 2 mML-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.), 60 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement (Collaborative Research, Medford, MA), 10 units/ml heparin (Sigma), and 100 units/ml penicillin G with 100 μg/ml of streptomycin sulfate (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells used in experiments were from passages 3 to 5. HUVECs were grown to confluence in 96-well microtitre plates. Cytokine was added as a 10-μl addition to the well medium. Treatments were either TNFα (300 units/ml; specific activity, 2 × 109 units/mg) or IL-4 (10 ng/ml) (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA) or both as described in the text. At the end of the incubation period, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde solution, pH 7, for 60 min. Plates were then washed once with PBS, blocked overnight at 4°C with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS, washed once with PBS, and incubated with 1 μg/ml primary antibody in 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS at 37°C for 2 h. Monoclonal antibody to VCAM-1 (CL40) was from Pharmacia & Upjohn, whereas monoclonal antibody to E-selectin was from R & D Systems (BBA1, Minneapolis, MN). After incubation with primary antibody, the cells were washed three times with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS, incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:500) (Organon Teknika Corp., West Chester, PA) in 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS at 37°C for 1 h, washed three times with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS, and washed once with PBS. The cells were then incubated in chromogenic substrate (1 mg/ml ρ-nitrophenyl phosphate in 1 M diethanolamine, 0.5 mM MgCl2, pH 9.8) at 37°C for 10-30 min, and absorbance was measured at 405 nm using a ThermoMax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). The results are presented as mean ± standard deviation of quadruplicate samples. Statistical significance was determined using two way analysis of variance. HUVECs were treated with TNFα (300 units/ml; specific activity, 2 × 109 units/mg) or IL-4 (10 ng/ml) or both for 30 min. Cells were suspended by treatment with trypsin and pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min. Nuclear proteins were isolated as described previously (29Chen C.C. Rosenbloom C.L. Anderson D.C Manning A.M. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3538-3545Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts (125 μg) were subjected to electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the fractionated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) using a Multiphor II semi-dry blotting device (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The membrane was blocked with 4% nonfat milk powder in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T), incubated with 0.1 μg/ml rabbit polyclonal antibody to STAT6 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) in PBS-T, washed, and then incubated with a polyclonal donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:2000) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Corp.). After extensive washing with PBS-T, chemiluminescent substrate was added (ECL detection system, Amersham Corp.), and the membrane was subjected to autoradiography with Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Corp.). Oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase as single strands prior to annealing to form double stranded target molecules. The NF-κB consensus DNA, 5′ AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC 3′, was purchased as a double stranded oligonucleotide from Promega (Madison, WI). The oligonucleotide sequences used for E-selectin and FcγRI are given under “Results.” For each assay, 10 μg of nuclear protein extract was incubated with 35 fmol of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe in binding buffer (4% glycerol, 10 mM Tris.Cl, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, and 50 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), pH 7.5) for 30 min at room temperature. Competition studies were performed by the addition of a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide to the binding reaction. Supershifting experiments were performed by the addition of antibody to the binding reaction for 20 min following the normal 20-min binding reaction. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to p50 and p65 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Resultant protein-DNA complexes were resolved on native 6% polyacrylamide gels using a 0.5 × TBE buffer (0.1 M Tris-Cl, 90 mM boric acid, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.4). The gels were prerun for 45 min at 150 V, and the samples were then electrophoresed at 250 V for 2-3 h at 4°C, dried onto paper under vacuum, and subjected to autoradiography. HUVECs were co-transfected with pCMVβ (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), a mammalian vector containing the β-galactosidase reporter driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter, and pE-luc, a mammalian vector containing 861 base pair of the E-selectin promoter (−9 to −870 base pairs from translation start site) inserted upstream of the luciferase reporter plasmid pGL2 (Promega, Madison, WI). Site-directed mutagenesis of pE-luc was performed using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) extension of both plasmid strands from mutated primers. The sense primers were; 5′-GCATCGTGGATA(T)(T)CCCGGGAAAG-3′ where the Ts in parentheses were changed to Cs to construct two separate point mutants. Clones were sequenced and shown to contain only the introduced mutation. The transfection procedure used Lipofectin reagent as outlined in the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). Briefly, cells were seeded into gelatin coated 6-well plates and allowed to grow to 60% confluency. Cells were transfected with 6 μl of Lipofectin and 500 ng of each vector in 800 μl of serum-free medium for 3.5 h and then incubated in normal medium for 24-48 h. In experiments where total cytokine treatment was for 5 h, the cytokine was added 48 h after transfection. In experiments involving cytokine pretreatment, the cytokine was added 30 h after transfection. Following cytokine treatment cells were washed once in ice-cold PBS, solubilized by incubation in 200 μl of reporter lysis buffer for 15 min (Promega, Madison, WI), transferred to a 96-well plate, and centrifuged to pellet cellular debris, and the supernatant was stored at −80°C. Luciferase activity was measured using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI), and β-galactosidase activity was determined by the Luminescent β-galactosidase Genetic Reporter System (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Both activities were quantified in a model ML1000 Luminometer with version 3.993 software (Dynatech, Chantilly, VA). Final E-selectin-luciferase activities were normalized against β-galactosidase activity. HUVECs were grown to confluency on gelatin-coated coverslips, treated with TNFα (300 units/ml; specific activity, 2 × 109 units/mg) and/or IL-4 (10 ng/ml) for 30 min and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. Fixed cells were washed in PBS, permeabilized in 100% methanol −20°C for 6 min, washed again in PBS, and incubated with polyclonal antibody to STAT6 or p65 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) (1 μg/ml) in PBS with 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 60 min. Cells were then incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated to biotin (Sigma) for 60 min, washed in PBS, and incubated with 20 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled avidin (Sigma) for 20 min in the dark. Coverslips were washed and fixed face down onto microscope slides in the presence of 1 mg/ml o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma) dissolved in PBS-glycerine (1:5, v/v). Cells were viewed at 400× magnification with a Nikon Optiphot-2 microscope equipped with epiillumination and a fluorescein excitation filter and photographed on Kodak Gold 400 print film. Total RNA was isolated from HUVECs using the reagent RNAzol (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX) based on the procedure of Chomczynski and Sacchi (30Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). RNA was resuspended in 15 μl of 1 mM EDTA and quantified by absorbance at 260 nm. Total RNA was size fractionated on a 1% agarose 0.6 M formaldehyde gel (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Chapter 7. Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 43-45Google Scholar). After electrophoresis the gel was blotted onto Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Corp.) using the manual capillary blot transfer system (Life Technologies, Inc.), and the RNA was cross-linked to the membrane by UV irradiation in a Stratalinker 2400 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). cDNAs of approximately 500 base pairs in length were isolated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction from HUVECs using the primer pair 5′-TGGTCTTACAACACCTC-3′ and 5′-CAGGCTTCCATGCTCAG-3′ for human E-selectin (32Bevilacqua M.P. Stengelin S. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Seed B. Science. 1989; 243: 1160-1164Google Scholar) and 5′-TTGCAGCTTCTCAAGCT-3′ and 5′-ATCCTCAATGACAGGAG-3′ for human VCAM-1 (33Osborn L. Hession C. Tizard R. Vassallo C. Luhowskyj S. Chi-Rosso G. Lobb R. Cell. 1989; 59: 1203-1211Google Scholar). A glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA was isolated from an amplimer kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). cDNA probes were prepared by random prime labeling with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) using the Prime-It II labeling kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Group means and standard deviations were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance. To establish that IL-4 can differentially modulate cytokine-induced E-selectin and VCAM-1 levels, we examined the cell surface expression of E-selectin and VCAM-1 in HUVECs stimulated with TNFα in the presence or the absence of IL-4 (Fig. 1). Treatment with IL-4 alone for 5 or 23 h had no effect on E-selectin expression (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 3). However, consistent with previous reports (28Iademarco M.F. Barks J.L. Dean D.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 264-271Google Scholar), treatment with IL-4 alone significantly increased VCAM-1 levels above control (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 3). Treatment with TNFα resulted in significant increase in E-selectin and VCAM-1 cell surface levels (Fig. 1, lanes 4). IL-4 treatment in conjunction with TNFα resulted in an augmentation of VCAM-1 protein levels and a significant, although not complete, inhibition of E-selectin expression. Of note, although no pretreatment was necessary to observe the IL-4 enhancement of VCAM-1 expression, pretreatment was required for inhibition of E-selectin. The IL-4-dependent increase in VCAM-1 levels is known to result from a stabilization of VCAM-1 mRNA (28Iademarco M.F. Barks J.L. Dean D.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 264-271Google Scholar). We therefore explored whether treatment with IL-4 also affected E-selectin mRNA stability. IL-4 treatment augmented the levels of VCAM-1 mRNA after 4 h and stabilized VCAM-1 transcripts over the following 12 h as previously reported. In contrast, IL-4 treatment had no effect on the half-life of E-selectin mRNA (t1/2 = 5.5 h, t1/2 + IL-4 = 6 h) but did result in a 22% decrease in the levels of steady state E-selectin mRNA at 4 h (data not shown). Therefore, IL-4-dependent stabilization of mRNA is specific for VCAM-1 and was not found to occur with the mRNA for another cell adhesion molecule, namely E-selectin. The observed decrease in E-selectin mRNA levels suggested that the IL-4 effect on E-selectin expression was being mediated at the level of transcription. To demonstrate this further we examined the effect of IL-4 on the cytokine-induced transcriptional activation of the E-selectin promoter, using an E-selectin promoter-luciferase reporter gene construct. HUVEC monolayers were co-transfected with a constitutively expressed β-galactosidase reporter gene construct and 861 base pairs of the E-selectin promoter fused to the luciferase reporter gene. After 48 h, cells were treated with either TNFα or IL-4 alone, TNFα and IL-4 added simultaneously, or IL-4 added as a pretreatment of 20 min prior to TNFα (Fig. 2). Cells in growth medium alone (lane 1) or treated with IL-4 for 5 h (lane 2) showed equal luciferase activity, demonstrating that IL-4 treatment alone cannot activate transcription from the E-selectin promoter above levels observed in untreated cells. TNFα treatment (lane 3) resulted in a 4.5-fold increase in luciferase activity, an observation consistent with studies showing a key role for TNFα-induced signal transduction mechanisms in E-selectin transcriptional activation (34Schindler U. Baichwal V.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5820-5831Google Scholar). Cells treated simultaneously with both TNFα and IL-4 (lane 4) showed a pronounced decrease in E-selectin promoter activity as compared with cells treated with TNFα alone. If cells were treated with IL-4 for 20 min (lane 5) prior to TNFα addition, the inhibitory effect of IL-4 was enhanced, with E-selectin promoter activity being inhibited by 50% compared with TNFα-treated cells (p < 0.001). This result indicated that IL-4 inhibition of TNFα-induced expression of E-selectin was likely due to inhibition of transcriptional activation of the E-selectin gene. In leukocytes, IL-4 has been shown to activate STAT6, a key component of the IL-4-dependent transcription factor, IL-4 STAT (7Hou J. Schindler U. Henzel W.J. Ho T.C. Brasseur M. McKnight S.L. Science. 1994; 265: 1701-1706Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether STAT6 was present in endothelial cells and activated in response to IL-4 treatment. Nuclear extracts from HUVECs treated with TNFα or IL-4 were examined for immunoreactive STAT6 protein (Fig. 3A). An immunoreactive species of a molecular weight identical to STAT6 was observed in nuclear extracts from IL-4-treated cells but not in extracts from quiescent or TNFα-treated cells. Immunofluorescence studies with HUVECs treated with TNFα and IL-4, either individually or in combination, were used to examine in situ the activation and nuclear translocation of STAT6 and p65, a subunit of the TNFα-inducible transcription factor NF-κB (35Sen A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 46: 705-716Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B). Quiescent cells exhibited diffuse cytoplasmic staining but no specific nuclear staining for NF-κB or STAT6. Treatment with TNFα resulted in the nuclear localization of NF-κB. STAT6 staining was no different from that observed with untreated cells. In contrast, IL-4 treatment had no effect on NF-κB activation but resulted in the nuclear translocation of STAT6 to the nucleus. Treatment with both TNFα and IL-4 resulted in the simultaneous activation and nuclear localization of both NF-κB and STAT6. These results demonstrate that STAT6 is present in endothelial cells and is specifically activated by IL-4 and not by TNFα. A previous report has shown that IL-4 directly inhibits the activation of NF-κB in monocytes but not fibroblasts (36Donnelly R.P. Crofford L.J. Freeman S.L. Buras J. Remmers E. Wilder R.L. Fenton M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 5603-5612Google Scholar). To investigate this mechanism we treated HUVECs with TNFα for 20 min, with and without a 20-min IL-4 pretreatment, and examined nuclear extract DNA binding activity to STAT6 and NF-κB oligonucleotides (Fig. 4). STAT6 binding activity was only observed in cell extracts from IL-4-treated cells. We observed a minor decrease in NF-κB DNA binding activity from cells treated with TNFα and IL-4 compared with cells treated with TNFα alone (see legend to Fig. 4). Therefore, IL-4 did not appear to markedly inhibit NF-κB activation in HUVECs. We hypothesized that STAT6 binding sites may be present in the E-selectin gene promoter and that STAT6 binding may mediate the IL-4-induced inhibition of E-selectin expression. Computer analysis of the E-selectin promoter revealed two potential STAT6 recognition sequences (TTCN3-4GAA) (16Seidel H.M. Milocco L.H. Lamb P. Darnell J.E. Stein R. Rosen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3041-3045Google Scholar) at positions −112 to −121 (E-selectin A) and −41 to −50 (E-selectin B) relative to the transcription initiation site (Fig. 5A). Oligonucleotides corresponding to these sites were synthesized, and the ability of nuclear proteins to interact with these two putative sequence elements was examined (Fig. 5B). IL-4-inducible complexes of identical electrophoretic mobility were observed binding to both of the E-selectin oligonucleotides and to an oligonucleotide containing a known STAT6 binding site from the FcγRI gene (7Hou J. Schindler U. Henzel W.J. Ho T.C. Brasseur M. McKnight S.L. Science. 1994; 265: 1701-1706Google Scholar). The IL-4-inducible complex formed with the FcγRI oligonucleotide was diminished in the presence of STAT6 antibody, confirming that the DNA-protein complex contained STAT6 (Fig. 5B, lane 3). The presence of excess FcγRI oligonucleotide resulted in the complete loss of the IL-4-induced E-selectin A and B complexes, demonstrating that the factor interacting with the E-selectin sites was the same as that binding to the FcγRI sequence (lanes 6 and 10). Addition of STAT6 antibody to the binding reactions inhibited complex formation similar to that observed with FcγRI (lanes 7 and 11). Therefore, STAT6 specifically recognizes two sites within the E-selectin gene promoter, and STAT6 binding to these sites is induced by IL-4 treatment. To determine whether IL-4-induced activation of STAT6 correlated directly with the observed inhibition of E-selectin expression, we used EMSA and ELISA analyses to compare the dose dependence of IL-4 activation of STAT6 (Fig. 6A) and inhibition of E-selectin cell surface protein levels (Fig. 6B). The dose-dependent concentration range of STAT6 nuclear localization and DNA binding activity to the E-selectin A site was 0.1-10 ng/ml IL-4. Similarly, IL-4 inhibition of TNFα-induced E-selectin expression was observed at concentrations between 0.1 and 10 ng/ml IL-4, with maximal inhibition at 10 ng/ml. Inspection of the sequences surrounding the E-selectin A site revealed that this STAT6 recognition sequence overlaps two adjacent, well characterized NF-κB binding sites critical for TNFα-induced transcriptional activation (Fig. 7A) (34Schindler U. Baichwal V.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5820-5831Google Scholar). This observation suggested that binding of STAT6 to this site might antagonize NF-κB binding and account for the observed"

Little is known about the molecular genetics of the enzyme. In the present investigation the gene for dipeptidyl-peptidase I was cloned and characterized. The gene spans approximately 3.5 kilobases and consists of two exons and one intron. The genomic organization is distinct from the complex structures of the other members of the papain-type cysteine proteinase family. By fluorescence in situ hybridization, the gene was mapped to chromosomal region 11q14.1-q14.3. Analysis of the sequenced 5′-flanking region revealed no classical TATA or CCAAT box in the GC-rich region upstream of cap site. A number of possible regulatory elements that could account for tissue-specific expression were identified. Northern analyses demonstrated that the dipeptidyl-peptidase I message is expressed at high levels in lung, kidney, and placenta, at moderate to low levels in many organs, and at barely detectable levels in the brain, suggesting tissue-specific regulation. Among immune/inflammatory cells, the message is expressed at high levels in polymorphonuclear leukocytes and alveolar macrophages and their precursor cells. Treatment of lymphocytes with interleukin-2 resulted in a significant increase in dipeptidyl-peptidase I mRNA levels, suggesting that this gene is subjected to transcriptional regulation.

The results provide initial insights into the molecular basis for the regulation of human dipeptidyl-peptidase I. Granule-associated serine proteinases are major constituents of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL), 1The abbreviations used are: PMNLpolymorphonuclear leukocytesDPP-Idipeptidyl-peptidase IUTRuntranslated regionPCRpolymerase chain reactionntnucleotide(s)IL-2interleukin-2kbkilobase(s). cytotoxic lymphocytes, and mast cells, accounting for up to 30% of the cellular protein in these cells. They are involved in many physiologic and pathologic processes. Unlike the more extensively characterized serine proteinases such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, or pancreatic elastase that are stored as inactive zymogens in the secretory vesicles of cells and activated only after secretion into the intestinal lumen, granule-associated serine proteinases of leukocytes and mast cells are stored as fully active enzymes. Nevertheless, based on their known cDNA sequences, these immune/inflammatory cell proteinases are initially translated as zymogens and then processed in several steps including the cleavage of signal peptides and the subsequent removal of short propeptides that typically consist of two amino acid residues (1Salvesen G. Enghild J.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5304-5308Google Scholar, 2Rao N.V. Rao G.V. Marshall B.C. Hoidal J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2972-2978Google Scholar). The cleavage of the propeptides is unusual in that it occurs at an acidic residue in contrast to most proteinase zymogens that are processed at a basic or, rarely, an aromatic residue. Thus, a major mechanism of control of leukocyte or mast cell granule-associated serine proteinases occurs at the level of dipeptidase activation. polymorphonuclear leukocytes dipeptidyl-peptidase I untranslated region polymerase chain reaction nucleotide(s) interleukin-2 kilobase(s). Dipeptidyl-peptidase I (DPP-I, EC 3.4.14.1), a cysteine proteinase, was recently demonstrated to play a requisite role in removing the activation dipeptide from many of the leukocyte and mast cell granule-associated proteinases including human cathepsin G, leukocyte elastase, mast cell chymase and tryptase, and lymphocyte granzymes B and H (3McGuire M.J. Lipsky P.E. Thiele D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2458-2467Google Scholar, 4Dikov M.M. Springman E.B. Yeola S. Serafin W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25897-25904Google Scholar, 5Murakami M. Karnik S.S. Husain A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2218-2223Google Scholar). DPP-I, originally called cathepsin C, was discovered when extracts of kidney were found to catalyze the hydrolysis of Gly-Phe-β-naphthylamide (6Gutmann H.R. Fruton J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1948; 174: 851-858Google Scholar). It is a lysosomal enzyme widely expressed in many tissues that is felt to be important in intracellular degradation of proteins. The enzyme was purified from human spleen and characterized as a glycoprotein with a pI of 5.4, a molecular mass of 200 kDa as determined by gel filtration under non-denaturing conditions, and a subunit size of 24 kDa (7McGuire M.J. Lipsky P.E. Thiele D.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 295: 280-288Google Scholar). The strong circumstantial evidence that DPP-I is the central coordinator for activation of many serine proteinases contained in immune/inflammatory cells and that it is differentially expressed in human tissues (8Vanha-Perttula T. Kalliomäki J.L. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1973; 44: 249-258Google Scholar) emphasizes the need for in-depth studies to define factors regulating its expression. A human and a rat DPP-I cDNA have recently been cloned (9Paris A. Strukelj B. Pungercar J. Renko M. Dolence I. Turk V. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 326-330Google Scholar, 10Ishidoh K. Muno D. Sato N. Kominami E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16312-16317Google Scholar), but the reported sequences contained only a portion of the 5′-untranslated regions (UTRs). Moreover, information on gene expression and regulation has not been reported. In the present investigation we describe the structure, localization, and expression of the gene for DPP-I. We also demonstrate its regulation in cytokine-stimulated lymphocytes. Maximum strength Nytran membranes were from Schleicher & Schuell, Inc. Multiple tissue Northern blots, ExpressHyb hybridization solution, human spleen total RNA, and Marathon cDNA amplification kits were from CLONTECH. MicroFastTrack kits, cDNA cycle kits, and TA Cloning kits were from Invitrogen. LA PCR kits were from Panvera. TRI REAGENT was from Molecular Research Center Inc. [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) were from Amersham Life Science, Inc. Sequenase DNA sequencing kits were from U. S. Biochemical Corp. RPMI 1640, minimum Eagle's medium, nonessential amino acids, and Cot1 DNA were from Life Technologies, Inc. Defined fetal bovine serum was from Hyclone Laboratories (Logan, UT). Hybrisol VI was from Oncor Inc. Actinomycin D, cycloheximide, and other chemicals not specifically mentioned were high quality grade from Sigma. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from human spleen using a MicroFastTrack kit. The first strand cDNA was synthesized with a combination of oligo(dT) and random primers. A portion of the cDNA was amplified using the PCR primers that represent the 5′ (743-760 nt) and 3′ (complementary to 1429-1446 nt) termini for the rat mature protein coding region (10Ishidoh K. Muno D. Sato N. Kominami E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16312-16317Google Scholar). The PCR product represented 756-1455 nt of human DPP-I cDNA and was used as a probe to screen a human genomic PAC (1 bacteriophage-derived rtificial hromosome) library (GenomeSystems, Inc.). Phage DNA from the PAC clones was purified by alkali lysis, and the insert was released with NotI followed by digestion with EcoRI. The digested DNA was analyzed by Southern blot hybridization with the human DPP-I cDNA probe used in the library screening, and the relevant DNA fragments were purified from the gel using a Prep-A-Gene kit. To determine the exon and intron organization, fragments of genomic DNA were amplified by PCR and sequenced. To locate intron sequences, the following oligonucleotide primer pairs were selected to amplify overlapping regions spanning the entire length of the human DPP-I cDNA: 1) 13-37 nt and complementary to 855-878 nt, 2) 855-872 nt and complementary to 1438-1455 nt, and 3) 1385-1408 nt and complementary to 1661-1684 nt. The primer pairs used to obtain the 5′-flanking sequence and identify the polyadenylation site were 1) T7 sequencing primer and complementary to 139-162 nt and 2) 1621-1641 nt and SP6 sequencing primer. To obtain data on the intron size and splice junction site, long and accurate PCR was performed to amplify the fragments of genomic DNA using a GeneAmp™PCR system 9600. The PCR amplification reaction consisted of an initial denaturation at 94°C for 1 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 15 s, annealing at 62°C for 15 s, and extension at 72°C for 2 min. Each PCR product was analyzed on an agarose gel, directly subcloned into the pCR™II vector using the TA cloning kit, and sequenced. The genomic plasmid clone was used as a probe for chromosomal localization of DPP-I by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The genomic clone was nick translation-labeled with biotin, hybridized to metaphase chromosomes, and detected with Cy3-conjugated streptavidin. Human metaphase chromosome spreads were prepared by standard procedures and G-banded after trypsin treatment and Wright's staining. Hybridization and detection conditions on metaphase chromosomes were performed as described previously (11Pinkel D. Straume T. Gray J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2934-2938Google Scholar). Briefly, the G-banded preparations were destained with a fixative containing methanol and glacial acetic acid (3:1), dehydrated by successive washings in 70, 90, and 100% ice-cold ethanol, and dried at 37°C. Probe signals were detected with Cy3 conjugate viewed through a triple pass filter using an epifluorescence microscope. The fluorescence in situ hybridization image was overlaid on the G-banded metaphase image to localize the gene. To determine the transcription start site, anchored PCR was performed. Briefly, the first strand cDNA was synthesized at 50°C using spleen total RNA (1 μg) and a gene-specific primer that was complementary to 855-878 nt. The 5′-end of purified cDNA was (dA)-tailed with terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase and anchored. The second strand cDNA was synthesized using oligo(dT) containing a 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends adapter primer. After purification, the double-stranded cDNA was amplified by PCR using a primer pair of an abridged universal amplification primer (Life Technologies, Inc.) and a gene-specific primer complementary to 828-851 nt. The PCR product was re-amplified with an abridged universal amplification primer and a nested gene-specific primer complementary to 751-774 nt. The PCR product was analyzed on an agarose gel, subcloned into PCR™II vector, and sequenced. Primer extension was performed to confirm the transcription start site. Briefly, the 18-nt primer complementary to 17-34 nt was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. An annealing reaction was carried out with 100 fmol of labeled primer and 25 μg of human spleen total RNA at 58°C for 20 min. To this reaction, avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (1 unit) was added to a 20-μl final volume containing 1 mM dNTPs, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mM spermidine. The extension reaction was carried out at 42°C for 30 min and terminated by adding 20 μl of loading dye. The primer extension samples were boiled for 10 min and loaded onto a 6% sequencing gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried and developed. Multitissue blots were used to determine expression of the DPP-I gene within human tissues. For studies of gene expression in immune/inflammatory cells, U937, PLB 985, or HL-60 cells were grown as described previously (12Senior R.M. Campbell E.J. Landis J.A. Cox F.R. Kuhn C. Koren H.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1982; 69: 384-393Google Scholar). Studies of gene regulation were conducted in IL-2-stimulated lymphocytes. Experiments were performed on cells having viabilities of >95% as judged by trypan blue exclusion. Cells were changed to fresh medium before the exposure to possible agonists/modulators at concentrations specified for the indicated periods of time. The cells were harvested at the end of each time period and kept frozen at −80°C until further analysis. Actinomycin D stock (5 mg/ml) was prepared in 95% (v/v) ethanol. Cycloheximide stock (10 mg/ml) was prepared in phosphate-buffered saline. Total RNA was prepared by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate phenol/chloroform method (13Chomczynski P. Sachhi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar) and quantified by measuring absorbance at 260 nm. RNA (10 μg/lane) was size-fractionated on 1% agarose, 0.4 M formaldehyde gels containing formamide and transferred to Nytran membranes by capillary action. The RNA was cross-linked to the membrane by exposure to UV light, prehybridized at 68°C for 30 min, and hybridized with an [α-32P]dCTP-labeled probe at 68°C for 1 h. After several low stringency washes, the blot was washed twice at high stringency and developed. Overall, the human DPP-I gene spans 3.5 kb and contains two exons separated by 1645 nt of intronic DNA (Fig. 1). The first exon comprises the 5′-UTR followed by 889 nt that encode the signal peptide, propeptide, and partial mature protein region. The second exon contains the remainder of the mature protein-coding sequence of 501 nt, the stop codon, and the 3′-UTR including a polyadenylation signal. The location of the intron was confirmed by sequence analysis. As shown in Fig. 1, the exon-intron boundaries conform to classical splice donor and acceptor consensus sequences (14Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Google Scholar). The single intron splice site occurred between nucleotides 952 and 953, the first and second nucleotides of the codon for Gly297 in the cDNA sequence, which was indicative of a phase 1 intron. The exon sequence agrees with that determined for the cDNA, indicating that the obtained cDNA using reverse transcription PCR is free of PCR artifacts. The cDNA is similar in size and composition to that recently reported for human ileum DPP-I (9Paris A. Strukelj B. Pungercar J. Renko M. Dolence I. Turk V. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 326-330Google Scholar) but contains an additional 30 nt of the 5′-UTR, including the transcription initiation site (see below). The DPP-I cDNA sequence spans 1888 nucleotides and includes a 1392-nt open reading frame that encodes for 463 amino acids. This includes a 24-amino acid residue signal peptide, a 206-amino acid residue propeptide region, and a 233-amino acid residue mature enzyme. The coding region of human DPP-I shows 78% identity to the rat at nucleotide and amino acid levels. The mature protein shows 88% identity at nucleotide and amino acid levels with the respective rat sequences. The cDNA sequence differs from that reported for the ileum at nucleotides 276 (C → G, Leu73 unchanged) and 1440 (G → A, Pro459 unchanged) in the protein coding region and at nucleotides 1461 (C → G), 1503 (A → G), and 1861 (G → A) in the 3′-UTR. In addition, there is a five-nucleotide (ACTGC) deletion immediately 5′ to the poly(A)+ tail in the spleen cDNA when compared with that of the ileum. These five nucleotides (ACTGC) preceding the poly(A)+ tail reported for human ileum DPP-I by Paris et al. (9Paris A. Strukelj B. Pungercar J. Renko M. Dolence I. Turk V. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 326-330Google Scholar) are identical to those we observed in the genomic sequence. The basis for this difference is not presently known but may result from the existence of limited genetic variability. Of the 20 metaphase cells that were located, all showed Cy3 signals on the long arms of chromosome 11. Fourteen of 20 showed four hybridization signals (one per chromatid, two on each chromosome 11) whereas 6 showed only one signal on one chromosome 11 and two signals on the other chromosome 11. No other chromosomes showed signals with the genomic probe, suggesting a single genomic sequence with high homology to the DPP-I gene locus. Imaging techniques further localized DPP-I to 11q14.1-q14.3 (Fig. 2) with a 92.5% efficiency of hybridization. Sequence analysis of independent subclones generated by anchored PCR indicated that transcription initiates at the A nucleotide located 63 nt upstream from the ATG that represents the translation initiation codon. Primer extension analysis with the antisense primer positioned 30 nt 5′ to the ATG yielded a 34-nt-long product (Fig. 3) calculated to end at the A nucleotide located 63 nt 5′ from the ATG and is, therefore, consistent with the results obtained by anchored PCR. The sequence of the region encompassing the transcription initiation site revealed that the A nucleotide is preceded by an invariant C nucleotide and matches the consensus cap signal that has been found in the majority of eukaryotic promoters (15Bucher P. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 563-578Google Scholar). The 5′-regulatory region was determined by sequencing the ∼3-kb PCR fragment that contained a portion of the first exon and the adjoining upstream region (Fig. 4). Computer analysis of this region revealed several features that are characteristic of promoters. The first 200 nt of the immediate 5′-region relative to the transcription initiation site is GC-rich (65%) as compared with the GC composition (50%) of the whole 5′-region. Further analysis of this region revealed neither a classical TATA box nor a CCAAT box. However, a potential cis-acting DNA element, GC-box/imian virus 40 rotein (Sp1) binding site (position −55 in reverse orientation) (16Briggs M.R. Kadonaga J.T. Bell S.P. Tjian R. Science. 1986; 234: 47-52Google Scholar) was identified. The 5′-region contains recognition sequences for several other transcription factors including three sites for the yclic AMP esponse lement inding rotein (CRE-BP) (17Benbrook D.M. Jones N.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1463-1469Google Scholar) at positions −519, −950 (reverse orientation), and −953; five sites for CAAT/nhancer inding rotein (C/EBP) (18Ryden T.A. Beemon K. Mol. Cell.

Other sites of interest in the 5′-region include binding sites for several cell-specific transcription factors involved in the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. These include five yeloid inc inger (MZF1) sites (21Morris J.F. Hromas R. Rauscher F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1786-1795Google Scholar) at positions −73 (reverse orientation), −116 (reverse orientation), −349 (reverse orientation), −435, and −1070; nine GATA (22Orkin S.H. Blood. 1992; 80: 575-581Google Scholar) family binding sites including four GATA-1 sites at positions −76 (reverse orientation), −731 (reverse orientation), −939, and −1055 (reverse orientation), four GATA-2 sites at positions −76 (reverse orientation), −550, −731 (reverse orientation), and −939, and one site for GATA-3 at position −77 (reverse orientation); two sites for aros (IK-2) (23Molnár A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4915-4922Google Scholar). Potential recognition sequences for the Ets (26 ransformation pecific) family of transcription factors c-Ets-1 (31Macleod K. Leprince D. Stehelin D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 251-256Google Scholar) and ts-ie (Elk-1) (32Hipskind R. Rao V. Mueller C. Reddy E. Nordheim A. Nature. 1991; 354: 531-534Google Scholar) are also present in reverse orientation at positions +29, −42, −1052, and −1054 and at position −39, respectively. The expression pattern of DPP-I in adult human tissues was determined by Northern blot analysis. The human DPP-I cDNA probe hybridized to a transcript of ∼2 kb in all the tissues but with varying intensities. The strongest signal for human DPP-I mRNA was detected in the lung, kidney, and placenta. A signal of moderate intensity was detected in the small intestine, colon, spleen, and pancreas. A low intensity signal was observed in the heart, reproductive organs (testis and ovary), and peripheral blood leukocytes. A weak signal was present in the thymus, prostate, liver, and skeletal muscle. Transcripts were barely detectable in the brain. Because of our interest in DPP-I as a central coordinator in activating granule-associated serine proteinases, we determined the expression of human DPP-I mRNA in immune/inflammatory cells and their precursors. A representative Northern blot is shown in Fig. 5. Among the fully differentiated cells, the strongest hybridization signal was observed in PMNL and alveolar macrophages. A weak signal was detected in unstimulated lymphocytes and monocytes. Among precursor cells, strong signals were observed in PLB 985, a myelomonoblastic cell line, U937, a myelomonocytic cell line, and HL-60, a promyelocytic cell line. Because granzymes present in lymphokine-activated lymphocytes are presumably activated by DPP-I that is present in only low levels in unstimulated lymphocytes, we studied the regulation of the human DPP-I gene in lymphocytes stimulated by IL-2. As shown in Fig. 6, low levels of human DPP-I mRNA were present in lymphocytes not exposed to IL-2. When lymphocytes were exposed to IL-2, induction of human DPP-I mRNA occurred as early as 12 h, peaked at 48 h, and then declined by 72 h. Actinomycin D prevented the induction of human DPP-I mRNA in lymphocytes stimulated by IL-2. Treatment of lymphocytes with cycloheximide also prevented the induction of human DPP-I mRNA by IL-2 (data not shown). These results indicate that the induction of human DPP-I mRNA observed in lymphocytes treated with IL-2 most likely occurred at the level of gene transcription and was dependent on protein synthesis. DPP-I is a lysosomal cysteine proteinase differentially expressed in a variety of tissues and thought to play an important role in intracellular protein degradation. To date, it is the only cysteine proteinase that has been demonstrated in PMNL, and recent studies have focused on the importance of this enzyme as a central coordinator for activation of granule-associated serine proteinases contained in PMNL and mast cells. In this investigation, to better understand the molecular basis for the regulation and physiologic effects of DPP-I and to gain insight into its tissue-specific and cytokine-induced expression, we have determined the organization, chromosomal location, and expression of the human DPP-I gene. DPP-I has been classified as a member of the lysosomal papain-type cysteine proteinase family that also includes cathepsins B, H, L, O, and S. This classification is based on its localization within the cell, acidic pH optimum for enzyme activity, and conserved amino acid sequence with respect to the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal regions that form the substrate-binding pocket of the enzyme. However, unlike cathepsin B, H, L, O, and S, which are monomeric proteins (molecular mass 20-30 kDa) with endopeptidase activity, DPP-I is an oligomeric protein (200 kDa) with exopeptidase activity. In addition, the overall amino acid sequence homology of DPP-I shows relatively little identity with other members of this group of proteinases. We now report that the organization of the human DPP-I gene contrasts strikingly with that of the other enzymes contained within the papain group. The human DPP-I gene is of limited size and complexity, existing as a single copy that spans approximately 3.5 kb, contains two exons divided by a single intron, and is expressed as a single transcript. Reports of genes previously described for cathepsin B (33Gong Q. Chan S.J. Bajkowski A.S. Steiner D.F. Frankfater A. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 299-309Google Scholar), cathepsin H (34Ishidoh K. Suzuki K. Katunuama N. Kominami E. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1991; 50: 541-547Google Scholar), cathepsin L (35Chauhan S.S. Popesecu N.C. Ray D. Fleischmann R. Gottesman M.M. Troen B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1039-1045Google Scholar), and cathepsin S (36Shi G.P. Webb A.C. Foster K.E. Knoll J.H. Lemere C.A. Munger J.S. Chapman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11530-11536Google Scholar) emphasize complex structures consisting of multiple exons and introns, some undergoing alternative splicing that gives rise to multiple transcripts that are differentially expressed. Recently, an alignment/phylogeny of the papain superfamily of cysteine proteases was created (37Berti P.J. Storer A.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 273-283Google Scholar) in which cathepsin B and DPP-I were placed in the same class, appearing to have diverged from the other papain group of sequences before the origin of kinetoplastids. However, the grouping of cathepsin B and DPP-I was not well supported statistically. Based on the results of the current investigation demonstrating the strikingly different genomic organization, we question the grouping of cathepsin B and DPP-I and speculate that rather than having a common ancestral origin with the other mammalian cysteine proteinases of the papain superfamily, DPP-I may have evolved into the class through convergence by selective evolutionary pressure. Also of note, human DPP-I is neither located on the chromosomes of other cysteine proteinase groups (36Shi G.P. Webb A.C. Foster K.E. Knoll J.H. Lemere C.A. Munger J.S. Chapman H.A. J. Biol.

Cell Genet. 1989; 51: 996Google Scholar) in which it is classified nor on chromosomes of granule-associated serine proteinases (40Jenne D.E. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1994; 150: 147-154Google Scholar) to which it functions as a processing enzyme. To begin to address the regulation of human DPP-I gene expression, we analyzed the 5′-flanking sequence for potential upstream regulatory elements. The transcription initiation site is located −63 nt from the translation initiation site and is surrounded by a canonical cap signal sequence. Consensus transcription sequences such as TATA and CCAAT are notably absent in the GC-rich upstream region of the cap site. Eukaryotic promoters lacking a TATA or CCAAT sequence frequently encode proteins or enzymes with housekeeping functions. Most of these constitutively expressed genes exhibit multiple transcription initiation sites distributed over a limited region (41Reynolds G.A. Goldstein J.L. Bown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10369-10377Google Scholar) and multiple Sp1 binding sequences. In contrast, the human DPP-I promoter has a single transcription initiation site and a single Sp1 site. This is similar to the cathepsin S (36Shi G.P. Webb A.C. Foster K.E. Knoll J.H. Lemere C.A. Munger J.S. Chapman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11530-11536Google Scholar), the thrombin receptor (42Schmidt V.A. Vitale E. Bahou W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9307-9312Google Scholar), and the nerve growth factor receptor (43Sehgal A. Patil N. Chao M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3160-3167Google Scholar) genes that are also subject to regulated expression. The 5′-flanking region of the human DPP-I gene contains putative regulatory elements. Many of these elements (e.g. MZF1, v-Myb, GATA) have been shown to be important in proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. The promoter region contains T cell-specific transcription factor binding sites (e.g. IK-2/Lyf-1, p300) as well as NF-κB recognition sites reported to be involved in the cytokine-stimulated gene expression (44Michael J.L. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 58: 227-229Google Scholar). Further functional analysis of the promoter region will be necessary to determine which of the factors are involved in the regulation of the human DPP-I gene. It has been reported previously that DPP-I mRNA is widely expressed in all rat tissues (10Ishidoh K. Muno D. Sato N. Kominami E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16312-16317Google Scholar) and that the relative level of message in different tissues mirrored the protein content (45Kominami E. Ishidoh K. Muno D. Sato N. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1992; 373: 367-373Google Scholar) as well as the enzyme activity (8Vanha-Perttula T. Kalliomäki J.L. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1973; 44: 249-258Google Scholar). This also appears true for the human, where the level of expression of DPP-I transcripts observed in the current investigation is in close agreement with reports of the distribution of DPP-I enzyme activity in tissues (8Vanha-Perttula T. Kalliomäki J.L. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1973; 44: 249-258Google Scholar) and hematopoietic cells (3McGuire M.J. Lipsky P.E. Thiele D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2458-2467Google Scholar, 7McGuire M.J. Lipsky P.E. Thiele D.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 295: 280-288Google Scholar). However, there are notable differences in the expression of DPP-I in the human and the rat. In the human, for example, DPP-I is expressed at low or barely detectable levels in the liver and brain, whereas in the rat DPP-I is highly expressed in the liver and moderately expressed in the brain. These results suggest species-specific expression of the enzyme. Importantly, the pattern of expression of DPP-I transcripts in immune/inflammatory cells is distinct from that observed for granule-associated serine proteinases. Results from the current investigation suggest that DPP-I is expressed at all stages of myeloid cell development. In contrast, mRNA expression of granule-associated serine proteinases is restricted to specific stages of myeloid cell development (46Hanson R. Connolly N. Burnett D. Campbell E. Senior R. Ley T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1524-1530Google Scholar, 47Bories D. Raynal M.C. Solomon D.H. Darzynkiewicz Z. Cayre Y.E. Cell. 1989; 59: 959-968Google Scholar, 48Zimmer M. Medcalf R.L. Fink T.M.

Nukiwa T. Basset P. Crystal R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2543-2547Google Scholar). This suggests a role for DPP-I in immune/inflammatory cells that extends beyond that of a processing enzyme for the granule-associated enzymes. In summary, we isolated and characterized the human DPP-I gene including a 1.2-kb promoter region. The gene contains a single intron and maps to chromosome 11q14.1-q14.3. The putative promoter region has neither consensus TATA nor CCAAT sequences, a characteristic of housekeeping genes, but it appears to be regulated, at least in certain settings. Further studies are needed to determine the basis for this regulated expression."

The retinoblastoma proteins (pRB, p107, and p130) are thought to be critical in controlling cell cycle progression by binding to and regulating the activity of the E2F transcription factors. We show here that p130/p107 protein levels, p107 mRNA levels, and E2F DNA binding complexes are regulated during 3T3-L1 adipogenesis. The predominant E2F binding complex in day 0 preadipocytes was p130-E2F with no detectable free E2F or p107. On Day 1, during mitotic clonal expansion, there was a distinct switch to free E2F and p107-E2F complexes associated with increased p107 mRNA and protein along with decreased p130 protein levels. Following differentiation, the day 0 pattern is reestablished. The switch is not just a consequence of reentry into the cell cycle, in that p107 protein levels are both detectable and unchanged in dividing, serum-restricted, or serum restimulated preconfluent cells. Interestingly, hormonal stimulation of 3T3-C2 cells, a related nondifferentiating cell line, also induces a mitotic clonal expansion phase that is associated with the p130:p107 switch in a pattern very similar to 3T3-L1 cells, suggesting the block in differentiation observed in 3T3-C2 cells occurs after clonal expansion. Combined, these findings suggest that the regulatory mechanisms of the p130:p107 switch are not specific to differentiation but may play a key role in regulating the mitotic clonal expansion necessary for adipocyte differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells.

We found recently that Cbl associates directly with a member of the 14-3-3 protein family (14-3-3τ) in T cells and that the association is increased as a consequence of anti-CD3-mediated T cell activation. We report here that phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate stimulation of T cells also enhanced the interaction between Cbl and two 14-3-3 isoforms (τ and ζ). Tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl was not sufficient or required for this increased interaction. Thus, cotransfection of COS cells with Cbl plus Lck and/or Syk family protein-tyrosine kinases caused a marked increase in the phosphotyrosine content of Cbl without a concomitant enhancement of its association with 14-3-3. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate stimulation induced serine phosphorylation of Cbl, and dephosphorylation of immunoprecipitated Cbl by a Ser/Thr phosphatase disrupted its interaction with 14-3-3. By using successive carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants of Cbl, the 14-3-3-binding domain was mapped to a serine-rich 30-amino acid region (residues 615-644) of Cbl. Mutation of serine residues in this region further defined a binding motif distinct from the consensus sequence RSXSXP, which was recently identified as a 14-3-3-binding motif.

The receptor for SF, c-Kit, contains intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, and binding of SF induces rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of several cellular proteins, including c-Kit itself. Activation of c-Kit is shown here to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of CRKL, and CRKL coprecipitated with c-Kit through an interaction that required the CRKL SH3 domains and not the SH2 domain. CRKL associated with c-Kit indirectly as part of a larger complex of proteins. Two proteins in this complex were identified as the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (p85PI3K) and the proto-oncoprotein p120CBL. Because p85PI3K is known to bind to the activated c-Kit receptor, the possibility that CRKL interacted with c-Kit indirectly through p85PI3K was investigated.

SF and c-Kit have also been linked to several hematologic and nonhematologic neoplastic disorders. It has been suggested that one mechanism could include autocrine production of SF, leading to a clonal expansion of c-Kit expressing cells. For example, coexpression of SF and c-Kit has been reported in breast tumor cells, small cell lung cancer cells, and malignant glioma cell lines (15Hines S.J. Organ C. Kornstein M.J. Krystal G.W. Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 769-779PubMed Google Scholar, 16Rygaard K. Nakamura T. Spang-Thomsen M. Br. J. Cancer. 1993; 67: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 17Stanulla M. Welte K. Hadam M.R. Pietsch T. Acta Neuropathol. 1995; 89: 158-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Also, it has been shown that the tyrosine phosphorylation pattern of cellular proteins in chronic myelogenous leukemia resembles the pattern observed after SF stimulation in normal cells (18Wisniewski D. Strife A. Berman E. Clarkson B. Leukemia. 1996; 10: 229-237PubMed Google Scholar). With the diverse effects of SF on cells of different lineages, there has been considerable interest in identifying the critical signal transduction pathways activated by c-Kit. The ligand is believed to induce dimerization or oligomerization of the receptor, activating the tyrosine kinase activity and inducing rapid but transient tyrosine phosphorylation of several cellular proteins, including c-Kit itself. Some substrates of c-Kit have been described to associate with c-Kit after activation, including phospholipase C-γ, p85PI3K, and SHP2 (19Rottapel R. Reedijk M. Williams D.E. Lyman S.D. Anderson D.M.

These proteins are believed to link c-Kit directly to various enzymatic pathways. However, as is the case for most receptors, the intermediate signaling events are not well understood. In this study we have investigated the specific role of CRKL, an adapter protein containing one SH2 domain and two SH3 domains, in c-Kit signaling. CRKL is widely expressed and belongs to the family of CRK adapter proteins that includes v-Crk and c-CRK (22ten Hoeve J. Morris C. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2469-2474PubMed Google Scholar). The CRKL SH2 domain can bind to the proto-oncoprotein p120CBL, p130CAS, and the focal adhesion protein paxillin (23de Jong R. ten Hoeve J.

The CRKL SH3 domain, like the c-CRK SH3 domain, binds in vitro and associates in vivo with c-ABL, SOS, and C3G (24Sattler M. Salgia R. Okuda K. Uemura N. Durstin M.A. Pisick E. Xu G. Li J.L.

CRKL is therefore likely to be involved in the regulation of the enzymatic pathways associated with these proteins. Using a human megakaryoblastic cell line, MO7e, SF stimulation was found to result in the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of CRKL and coprecipitation of CRKL with c-Kit. However, although this interaction was inducible, it was mediated through the CRKL SH3 domain. This suggested the possibility that CRKL was not binding to c-Kit directly, but associated with c-Kit as part of a larger complex of proteins. We found that the coprecipitation of CRKL with c-Kit is, at least in part, likely to be mediated through binding of p85PI3K to c-Kit as well as to CRKL. Other proteins are likely to be involved in this complex, with the most prominent identified as the proto-oncoprotein p120CBL. These data demonstrate that CRKL is involved in the formation of a complex of signaling proteins that bind to c-Kit through PI3K and further suggest that CRKL, and its SH2-binding partners such as p120CBL, may function downstream of PI3K. The human promegakaryoblastic cell line MO7e (obtained from Dr. Steve Clark, Genetics Institute, Cambridge, MA) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech, Washington, DC), 10 ng/ml granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (Genetics Institute), and 20% (v/v) fetal calf serum (PAA Laboratories Inc., Newport Beach, CA) at 37°C with 10% CO2. For stimulation studies, MO7e cells were deprived of growth factors for 18 h at 37°C in serum-free medium containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (Sigma). Starved MO7e cells were left untreated or stimulated with recombinant human SF (Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at a concentration of 5 × 106 cells/ml. Cells were washed in cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, and cell lysates were prepared as described (33Sattler M. Durstin M.A. Frank D.A. Okuda K. Kaushansky K. Salgia R. Griffin J.D. Exp. Hematol. 1995; 23: 1040-1048PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting using a chemiluminescence technique was performed as described (33Sattler M. Durstin M.A. Frank D.A. Okuda K. Kaushansky K. Salgia R. Griffin J.D. Exp. Hematol. 1995; 23: 1040-1048PubMed Google Scholar). Immunochemical detection of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins in Western blots utilized monoclonal antibody 4G10 (kindly provided by Dr. B. Druker, Oregon Health Science University, Portland, OR). Polyclonal rabbit antisera were obtained against c-Kit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), p120CBL (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), CRKL (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and p85PI3K (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY). A murine monoclonal antibody was generated against the N-terminal SH3 domain of CRKL and used for immunoblotting in this study. The pGEX vectors containing the N-terminal or C-terminal SH2 domain and the SH3 domain of p85PI3K were kindly provided by Dr. L. Cantley (Beth Israel Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). pGEX vectors containing the SH2 and the SH3-SH3 domains of CRKL were kindly provided by Dr. J. Groffen (Children's Hospital, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA). The GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli (DH-5α) by isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside induction and isolated from sonicated bacterial lysates using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) according to the manufacturer's directions. Using previously established techniques (34ten Hoeve J. Kaartinen V. Fioretos T. Haataja L. Voncken J.W. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2563-2567PubMed Google Scholar), far Western blotting was performed as described (24Sattler M. Salgia R. Okuda K. Uemura N. Durstin M.A. Pisick E. Xu G. Li J.L. Prasad K.V. Griffin J.D. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 839-846PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, immunoprecipitated proteins were transferred after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to Immobilon-P (polyvinylidene difluoride) membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in 0.1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4). The specific direct in vitro binding was evaluated by probing the membrane with GST fusion proteins and visualized with a combination of anti-GST monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse IgG antibody by chemiluminescence. The activity of PI3K was measured in anti-c-Kit, CRKL, p120CBL, and preimmune control immunoprecipitates of unstimulated and SF-stimulated MO7e cell lysates. The kinase assay was performed as described (35Prasad K.V. Janssen O. Kapeller R. Raab M. Cantley L.C. Rudd C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7366-7370Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 36Prasad K.V. Kapeller R. Janssen O. Repke H. Duke-Cohan J.S. Cantley L.C. Rudd C.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7708-7717Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Stimulation of c-Kit induces tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins and the receptor itself. For initial experiments we stimulated MO7e cells with SF for different time points between 0 and 60 min. Fig. 1 shows that SF induces rapid and transient tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins with apparent molecular masses of 39, 55, 70, 80, 120, and 155 kDa. The tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins followed different kinetics. Whereas proteins with apparent molecular masses of 55, 70, 80, and 120 kDa had maximum tyrosine phosphorylation at 1 min, the tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins with apparent molecular masses of 39 and 155 kDa peaked at 10 min and decreased thereafter. To investigate the potential role of the 39-kDa adapter protein CRKL in SF signaling, we looked for tyrosine phosphorylated proteins that coprecipitated with CRKL. SF induced tyrosine phosphorylation of CRKL itself and association of CRKL with prominent phosphotyrosine proteins with apparent molecular masses of 120 and 155 kDa (Fig. 2A). In addition, a single 39-kDa tyrosine phosphorylated band was also detected in CRKL immunoprecipitates of SF-stimulated but not of unstimulated denatured lysates, suggesting that this band is indeed CRKL (data not shown). The tyrosine phosphorylation of CRKL and association with the 120-kDa phosphotyrosine protein was maximal within 1 min, and the association with the 155-kDa phosphotyrosine protein was maximal within 10 min of SF stimulation. The 155-kDa tyrosine phosphorylated protein that coimmunoprecipitated with CRKL comigrated with c-Kit. This membrane was therefore reblotted, and the 155-kDa protein was identified by immunoblotting as c-Kit (Fig. 2A). The lowest panel in Fig. 2A demonstrates that equal amounts of CRKL were loaded. Similarly, we found that a 39-kDa tyrosine phosphorylated protein was detected in c-Kit immunoprecipitates. This 39-kDa protein was identified as CRKL by reblotting with anti-CRKL antibodies (Fig. 2B). We also noted inducible coprecipitation of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins in c-Kit immunoprecipitates with apparent molecular masses of 55, 70, and 120 kDa. Preimmune rabbit serum did not precipitate tyrosine phosphorylated proteins. The upper panel on the right side of Fig. 2B demonstrates that equal amounts of c-Kit were loaded. In BCR/ABL-transformed cells, we and others have previously demonstrated that CRKL can bind to tyrosine phosphorylated p120CBL. We therefore also asked if CRKL coprecipitates with p120CBL after SF stimulation. Fig. 2C shows immunoprecipitates of p120CBL after 0-60 min SF stimulation, demonstrating rapid association with CRKL within 1 min of SF stimulation, which decreased thereafter. p120CBL coimmunoprecipitated also with a major tyrosine phosphorylated protein of an apparent molecular mass of 155 kDa. Similarly, in both the CRKL and c-Kit immunoprecipitations, the 120-kDa tyrosine phosphorylated protein was identified as p120CBL (data not shown). The middle panel in Fig. 2C demonstrates that equal amounts of p120CBL were loaded. These data suggest that CRKL forms an inducible complex with c-Kit and p120CBL after SF stimulation. We have previously shown that the BCR/ABL oncoprotein induces formation of a complex containing p210BCR/ABL, p120CBL, CRKL, and p85PI3K (24Sattler M. Salgia R. Okuda K. Uemura N. Durstin M.A. Pisick E. Xu G. Li J.L. Prasad K.V. Griffin J.D. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 839-846PubMed Google Scholar). Because p85PI3K is known to bind to c-Kit after SF activation (37Serve H. Hsu Y.-C. Besmer P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6026-6030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we looked for association of PI3K with CRKL or p120CBL after SF stimulation of MO7e cells. In lysates of SF-stimulated MO7e cells, p85PI3K was associated with tyrosine phosphorylated proteins with apparent molecular masses of 155, 120, 70, 55, and 39 kDa (Fig. 3, left panel). The 155-kDa protein was identified as c-Kit, the 120-kDa protein was identified as p120CBL, and the 39-kDa protein was identified as CRKL by specific immunoblotting (Fig. 3, right panels). Whereas the association of p85PI3K with c-Kit and p120CBL was dependent on SF stimulation, a small amount of CRKL was already preassociated with p85PI3K. The association of p85PI3K with CRKL increased considerably upon SF stimulation of MO7e cells. These data suggest the formation of a multimeric signaling complex after SF stimulation that includes CRKL, c-Kit, p120CBL, and p85PI3K. The previous results suggested that c-Kit, CRKL, and p120CBL form a complex with p85PI3K, suggesting that the p110PI3K enzymatic subunit is also present. To determine if enzymatically active PI3K is present in this complex, we immunoprecipitated c-Kit, CRKL, and p120CBL from lysates of unstimulated and SF-stimulated MO7e cells. Fig. 4 demonstrates that significant PI3K activity was detected in c-Kit, CRKL, and p120CBL immunoprecipitates of SF-stimulated MO7e cells and in CRKL immunoprecipitates of unstimulated cells. However, very little PI3K coimmunoprecipitated with anti-p120CBL compared with anti-c-Kit and CRKL immunoprecipitates; preimmune serum did not immunoprecipitate PI3K activity. These results also demonstrate that CRKL is preassociated with active PI3K, and after SF stimulation the association of active PI3K with CRKL and c-Kit is markedly increased. The above results suggest the potential induction of one or more multimeric c-Kit receptor complexes containing CRKL, p85PI3K, and p120CBL. The association of c-Kit with CRKL and also with p85PI3K and p120CBL appears to require tyrosine phosphorylation of some of these proteins. Because CRKL has one SH2 and two adjacent SH3 domains, we sought to determine the mechanism of binding of CRKL to the proteins in this complex using GST fusion proteins containing various segments of each protein. Surprisingly, the SH3 domain of CRKL precipitated c-Kit from lysates of stimulated but not unstimulated cells. Using denatured lysates of unstimulated and SF-stimulated MO7e cells, we did not observe precipitation of the CRKL SH2 or CRKL SH3 domains with c-Kit (data not shown). In contrast, the SH2 domain of CRKL precipitated p120CBL from cell lysates of stimulated but not unstimulated MO7e cells. However, both the SH2 and the SH3 domains precipitated p120CBL from SF-stimulated and unstimulated lysate with increased specific binding of CRKL fusion protein to p120CBL following stimulation (Fig. 5A). Because p85PI3K contains two proline-rich motifs, we tested whether the CRKL-SH3 interacts with p85PI3K. Fig. 5B demonstrates that p85PI3K binds constitutively to the CRKL SH3 domain but does not associate with the CRKL SH2 domain or the ABL-SH3 domain. We next tested whether GST fusion proteins containing the N-terminal SH2 domain, the C-terminal SH2 domain, or the SH3 domain of p85PI3K could precipitate c-Kit or p120CBL. Fig. 5C demonstrates that the C-terminal and the N-terminal SH2 domain of p85PI3K can associate with the c-Kit receptor. This is consistent with earlier findings demonstrating binding of p85PI3K to c-Kit (37Serve H. Hsu Y.-C. Besmer P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6026-6030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This membrane was reblotted with antibodies to p120CBL demonstrating in vitro association of p120CBL with the SH3 domain and both SH2 domains of PI3K. The in vitro GST fusion protein precipitations with c-Kit, p85PI3K, and p120CBL do not indicate whether binding of the SH2 or SH3 domains is direct or indirect. We therefore used a far Western technique to identify direct in vitro interactions. Cellular lysates from unstimulated and SF-stimulated MO7e cells were used for immunoprecipitations with c-Kit, CRKL, and anti-p120CBL antibodies. Fig. 5D shows that GST protein alone does not bind to proteins in immunoprecipitations. Direct binding of a single 120-kDa protein band in p120CBL immunoprecipitations using the GST-CRKL-SH2 protein as a probe was found after SF stimulation. We also observed in vitro binding of the CRKL SH3 domain to p85PI3K, this interaction was not changed upon SF stimulation. However, we also observed inducible binding of the CRKL SH3 and the CRKL SH2 domains to a 155-kDa protein in anti-c-Kit and p85PI3K immunoprecipitations but not in anti-p120CBL immunoprecipitations. The identity of this protein remains unknown but we do not believe that it is c-Kit because we could not precipitate c-Kit with the CRKL SH2 domain. The p85PI3K SH3 domain was found to bind directly to p120CBL and the C-terminal SH2 domain to c-Kit. We did not observe significant binding of the N-terminal SH2 domain of p85PI3K to c-Kit, CRKL, or p120CBL. These results suggest that in MO7e cells, CRKL is linked through its SH3 domain to the PI3K pathway, whereas the SH2 domain of CRKL binds to p120CBL after SF stimulation. In addition, the results also suggest direct binding of the C-terminal p85PI3K SH2 domain to c-Kit and binding of the p85PI3K SH3 domain to p120CBL. Although there are a number of signaling molecules known to be tyrosine phosphorylated by c-Kit, most downstream signaling pathways are not well understood. After stimulation of c-Kit with SF, previous studies have demonstrated rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Kit itself and cellular proteins including SHP2, phospholipase C-γ, SHC, and p120CBL (19Rottapel R.

These molecules in turn contribute signals to various pathways that influence growth, viability, adhesion, migration, or differentiation. PI3K has been the focus of several studies related to c-Kit signaling. For example, mutation of tyrosine 709 to phenylalanine in the Tyr-Xaa-Xaa-Met motif of the murine c-Kit receptor has been shown to reduce binding of the p85 subunit of PI3K (37Serve H. Hsu Y.-C. Besmer P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6026-6030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further, this mutation also caused defects in SF-mediated adhesion and early gene expression, presumably by interfering with activation of PI3K (40Serve H. Yee N.S. Stella G. Sepp-Lorenzino L. Tan J.C. Besmer P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). However, despite the apparent importance of PI3K signaling in this and other receptors, downstream signaling events have been difficult to identify. In the studies reported here, we found that the adapter protein, CRKL, was tyrosine phosphorylated after c-Kit activation and coprecipitated with c-Kit. However, there was no evidence that CRKL bound to c-Kit directly, and the data presented here suggest rather that CRKL binds directly to p85PI3K and indirectly to c-Kit through p85PI3K. The interaction of CRKL with p85PI3K was found to utilize the CRKL SH3 domains and could be further increased in response to factor stimulation. Also, we found that after SF stimulation, p120CBL is tyrosine phosphorylated and coprecipitates with CRKL, suggesting the formation of a signaling complex that contains c-Kit, PI3K, CRKL, and p120CBL. Overall, the data suggest the possibility that CRKL and/or p120CBL play a role in sending or modulating signals from c-Kit that require PI3K. One of the most intriguing findings here is the specific, inducible association of CRKL with p85PI3K through the CRKL SH3 domains. Previous studies suggested that CRK is constitutively associated with c-ABL, C3G, or SOS through the CRK SH3 domains. These proteins were first described to bind to the CRKII SH3 domain, but we and others have shown that they also bind to the CRKL SH3 domain (24Sattler M. Salgia R. Okuda K. Uemura N.

SOS has known guanine exchange factor activity for p21Ras, whereas C3G appears to have specific guanine exchange activity for p21Rap1 (41Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H. Noda M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Matsui H. Hatase O. Takahashi H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6746-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). C3G has unique binding affinities to the CRK family proteins, because it preferentially binds to the N-terminal SH3 domain (29Knudsen B.S. Feller S.M. Hanafusa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32781-32787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The exact function of the tyrosine kinase c-ABL is unknown, although c-ABL has been shown to be involved in transcriptional activation and possibly is activated in response to certain types of DNA damage (42Kharbanda S. Ren R. Pandey P. Shafman T.D. Feller S.M. Weichselbaum R.R. Kufe D.W. Nature. 1995; 376: 785-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 43Welch P.J. Wang J.Y. Cell. 1993; 75: 779-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Recently a consensus sequence for binding to the CRK SH3 domain, Pro-Xaa-Leu-Pro-Xaa-Lys, has been described (44Matsuda M. Ota S. Tanimura R. Nakamura H. Matuoka K. Takenawa T. Nagashima K. Kurata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14468-14472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 45Sparks A.B. Rider J.E. Hoffman N.G. Fowlkes D.M. Quilliam L.A. Kay B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1540-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Consistent with our finding of CRKL SH3 binding to p85PI3K, a proline-rich motif with this consensus sequence, Pro-Ala-Leu-Pro-Pro-Lys (amino acids 305-310, human sequence), is present in p85PI3K (46Skolnik E.Y. Margolis B. Mohammadi M. Lowenstein E. Fischer R. Drepps A. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1991; 65: 83-90Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The SH3 domain interaction of CRKL with p85PI3K may occur at this site, although this has not yet been directly tested. Inducible association of an adapter protein through SH3 domain interactions has been previously described for the binding of GRB2 to SOS in T lymphocytes, although most SH3 domain-mediated interactions are constitutive (47Ravichandran K.S. Lorenz U. Shoelson S.E. Burakoff S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 593-600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One explanation for this phenomenon would be the presence of other proteins binding to CRKL, p85PI3K, and c-Kit that are important for overall stability of the complex and that are brought into the complex in response to receptor activation. We believe that p120CBL may be important in this regard, and this will be discussed in more detail below. Overall, our data strongly suggest that PI3K should be added to the list of signaling proteins known to interact with the CRKL SH3 domains but in the specific situation of c-Kit activation. The fact that the CRKL SH3 domains can bind to several different, unrelated signaling proteins suggests that CRKL may play a role in several different signaling pathways. Thus, it is possible that the biological functions of CRKL may vary widely in different cells. Alternatively, it is possible that different stimuli may activate different signaling pathways involving CRKL in the same cell. CRKL has been shown to be tyrosine phosphorylated in cells transformed by onco-proteins including BCR/ABL, v-Abl, v-Src, or in normal signaling after EGF receptor stimulation (34ten Hoeve J. Kaartinen V. Fioretos T. Haataja L. Voncken J.W. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2563-2567PubMed Google Scholar, 48Fukazawa T. Miyake S. Band V. Band H. J. Biol.

Binding of CRKL to p120CBL appears to be independent from CRKL tyrosine phosphorylation, because in other systems, including T cell signaling, CRKL is not tyrosine phosphorylated, although it binds to p120CBL (50Reedquist K.A. Fukazawa T. Panchamoorthy G. Langdon W.Y. Shoelson S.E. Druker B.J. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8435-8442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we did not find significant association of CRK with c-Kit in SF signaling in MO7e cells, despite abundant expression of CRK in this cell line (data not shown) and the reported similarity of target proteins selected by CRKL and CRK during in vitro binding studies. It may be worthwhile to look specifically for situations in which CRK and not CRKL is preferentially selected for tyrosine phosphorylation and activation in various cell lineages. Thus, the data presented here support the notion that CRKL is involved in a signaling pathway that also involves PI3K. Our data suggest that a substantial proportion of the PI3K activity associated with an activated c-Kit receptor is also associated with CRKL, because approximately the same amount of PI3K enzymatic activity is found in anti-CRKL as in anti-c-Kit immunoprecipitates. The biological effects of activated PI3K may vary widely from cell to cell, ranging from regulation of apoptosis, viability, or early gene expression to regulation of adhesion. CRKL may be involved in signaling to any or all of these different biological events. Specifically with regard to c-Kit, mutant c-Kit receptors that fail to bind PI3K, fail to induce c-fos or junB expression, and lack the ability to induce binding of cells to fibronectin and CRKL could be involved in one or all of these events (40Serve H. Yee N.S. Stella G. Sepp-Lorenzino L. Tan J.C. Besmer P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). As noted above, a protein known to bind to the CRKL SH2 domain in certain transformed cells, p120CBL, was found to coprecipitate with CRKL after c-Kit stimulation. In vitro binding studies suggested that the SH2 domains of both CRKL and p85PI3K can bind to p120CBL, and the SH3 domain of PI3K also interacted directly with p120CBL. Of course, other proteins that can interact with the CRKL SH2 domain may also be brought into any such complex, and in addition to p120CBL, the known possibilities include p130CAS, and paxillin (25Petruzzelli L.

However, our data in MO7e cells suggest that p120CBL is the most abundant tyrosine phosphoprotein coprecipitating with CRKL after SF stimulation in these cells. The proto-oncoprotein p120CBL (for Casitas B-lineage lymphoma) is the cellular homolog of v-Cbl, the oncoprotein in the CAS NS-1 retrovirus (51Langdon W.Y. Hyland C.D. Grumont R.J. Morse H.D. J.

In mammalian cells, the function of p120CBL is not known; however, it may act downstream of c-Src signaling for bone resorption by osteoclasts (61Tanaka S. Amling M. Neff L. Peyman A. Uhlmann E. Levy J.B. Baron R. Nature. 1996; 383: 528-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Also, the p120CBL homolog Sli-1 in Caenorhabditis elegans is a negative regulator of the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase homologue Let-23 (62Yoon C.H. Lee J. Jongeward G.D. Sternberg P.W. Science. 1995; 269: 1102-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The formation of a complex containing CRKL, p85PI3K, and p120CBL has been previously demonstrated by us in BCR/ABL-transformed cells (24Sattler M. Salgia R. Okuda K. Uemura N. Durstin M.A. Pisick E. Xu G. Li J.L. Prasad K.V. Griffin J.D. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 839-846PubMed Google Scholar). Although the function of the CRK family proteins is not known, a model by Feller et al. shows a hypothetical role for the tyrosine phosphorylation of CRK (31Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). In this model the N-terminal SH3 domain interacts with the proline-rich domain of c-ABL. Subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of CRK leads to dissociation of c-ABL from CRK and binding of the CRK SH2 domain to the tyrosine phosphorylated site in CRK. However, the data presented here and our previous studies in BCR/ABL-transformed cells do not suggest that CRKL, unlike CRK, undergoes intramolecular binding to its own SH2 domain. Overall, one model consistent with our data would be that a tyrosine phosphorylated c-Kit receptor first attracts the p85PI3K subunit through its SH2 domain to Tyr709. Some CRKL and 120CBL may already be bound to PI3K and may become targets for the c-Kit tyrosine kinase or another kinase. The tyrosine phosphorylation of p120CBL is likely to provide binding sites for the SH2 domains of CRKL and p85PI3K, further potentially stabilizing the complex. Thereafter the complex may leave the receptor intact or disassembled, and it is not clear at this time if p120CBL and CRKL are regulators of PI3K enzymatic activity or downstream effectors that require PI3K activity for an as yet unknown signaling function. In any case, it is likely that further elucidation of the functions of this complex will be helpful in understanding the signaling of c-Kit and PI3K in particular."

In mammalian cells, two major forms of IκB proteins, IκBα and IκBβ, have been identified.

INTRODUCTIONThe transcription factor NF-κB 1The abbreviations used are: NF-κBnuclear factor-κBTNFtumor necrosis factorILinterleukinLPSlipopolysaccharidePMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateHAhemagglutininwtwild typeTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycineALLNN-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal. plays a central role in the regulation of genes implicated in the immune response and in inflammatory processes. NF-κB is composed of homo- and heterodimeric complexes of members of the Rel/NF-κB family of polypeptides. In vertebrates, this family comprises p50, p65 (RelA), c-Rel, p52, and RelB.In resting cells, NF-κB is cytosolic, but the nuclear translocation of this factor can be induced by multiple stimuli that act at different levels in the cell. Some, like TNF-α, IL-1, LPS, or antibodies against the T cell receptor-CD3 complex, act on an extracellular receptor, whereas others, like PMA and double-stranded RNA, activate intracellular second messengers (for review, see Refs. 1Israël A. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 203-205Google Scholar and 2Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Google Scholar).The molecular mechanism responsible for the cytosolic retention of NF-κB involves its association with the inhibitory ankyrin repeat-containing members of the IκB family of proteins. This family of inhibitors is mainly represented by IκBα and IκBβ (3Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1689-1698Google Scholar, 4Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1990; 344: 678-682Google Scholar) but also includes IκBγ, Bcl-3, p105, and p100 (for review, see Ref. 5Gilmore T.D. Morin P.J. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 427-433Google Scholar). p105 and p100, which are also the precursors of the p50 and p52 subunits of NF-κB, function as IκB proteins through association with p50, c-Rel or p65 (6Rice N.R. MacKichan M.L. Israël A. Cell. 1992; 46: 243-253Google Scholar, 7Mercurio F. Didonato J.A. Rosette C. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 705-718Google Scholar, 8Scheinman R.I. Beg A.A. Baldwin A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6089-6101Google Scholar). Among the different IκBs, IκBα and IκBβ play a major role in the regulation of NF-κB. These two proteins have been originally identified by partial purification (3Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1689-1698Google Scholar, 4Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1990; 344: 678-682Google Scholar). A cDNA clone has been isolated which encodes a 36-kDa protein called MAD-3, which appears to be identical to IκBα (9Haskill S. Beg A.A. Tompkins S.M. Morris J.S. Yurochko A.D. Sampson J.A. Mondal K. Ralph P. Baldwin A.J. Cell. 1991; 65: 1281-1289Google Scholar). The cloning of IκBβ cDNA is more recent, and this molecule has thus been characterized less thoroughly (10Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Google Scholar).Unlike IκBβ, the IκBα gene is positively regulated by NF-κB and glucocorticoids (10Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Google Scholar, 11Auphan N. Didonato J.A. Rosette C. Helmberg A. Karin M. Science. 1995; 270: 286-290Google Scholar, 12De Martin R. Vanhove B. Cheng Q. Hofer E. Csizmadia V.

Baldwin A.S. Science. 1995; 270: 283-286Google Scholar). IκBα and IκBβ associate with p50-p65 heterodimers and prevent the nuclear translocation of these complexes by masking their nuclear localization sequence. These two molecules are structurally similar as they contain multiple ankyrin repeats and a COOH-terminal PEST domain, a sequence known to be highly correlated to rapid protein turnover. The PEST domain of IκBα is involved in its degradation (15Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. McKinsey T.A. Hall S.M. Qi X.X. Lee W.Y. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell.

Rice N.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 872-882Google Scholar).Under the effect of a stimulus, IκBα becomes phosphorylated and is subsequently degraded, allowing NF-κB to translocate into the nucleus. The use of protease inhibitors has shed some light on the proteases responsible for IκBα degradation (21Alkalay I. Yaron A. Hatzubai A. Jung S. Avraham A. Gerlitz O. Pashut L.I. Ben-Neriah Y. Mol.

In the presence of an NF-κB inducer, proteasome inhibitors stabilize a phosphorylated form of IκBα characterized by a slow electrophoretic mobility. The observation that this retarded form is still associated with NF-κB invalidates the former hypothesis that IκBα phosphorylation induces its dissociation from NF-κB.Recently, the sites of phosphorylation of IκBα have been identified as two closely spaced serines at positions 32 and 36 in the NH2-terminal part of the protein (15Brockman J.A.

Mutation of these two serines to nonphosphorylatable residues prevents IκBα degradation, suggesting that their phosphorylation is a prerequisite for degradation. In addition, an in vitro study has also shown that only the hyperphosphorylated form of IκBα is degraded (29Alkalay I. Yaron A. Hatzubai A. Orian A. Ciechanover A. Ben-Neriah Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10599-10603Google Scholar). It has been reported that degradation of IκBα is triggered by ubiquitination (30Chen Z.J. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1586-1597Google Scholar). Ubiquitination occurs primarily on two adjacent lysines (Lys-21 and Lys-22) (31Baldi L. Brown K. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 376-379Google Scholar, 32Scherer D.C. Brockman J.A. Chen Z. Maniatis T. Ballard D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11259-11263Google Scholar).In thymocytes, IκBα is the main inhibitor of NF-κB, and the disruption of IκBα gene by homologous recombination results in a constitutively elevated level of nuclear NF-κB (33Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2736-2746Google Scholar). In contrast to hematopoietic cells, IκBα−/− embryonic fibroblasts behave as wild type cells because of the major role of the IκBβ molecule.A recent study concludes that TNF-α or PMA induces degradation of IκBα but not of IκBβ, suggesting that these two proteins are regulated differentially (10Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Google Scholar). The mechanisms responsible for the differential behavior of the two IκB molecules remain unresolved. We provide here some clues as to why these two molecules are regulated differentially. We first show that IκBβ degradation is blocked by proteasome inhibitors, suggesting an involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, similar to what has been described for IκBα. These similarities are confirmed by the identification of two critical sites of phosphorylation (Ser-19 and Ser-23) whose mutations decrease the rate of signal-induced degradation of IκBβ. However, IκBβ contains only one lysine NH2-terminal to ankyrin repeats, and its mutation does not prevent the signal-induced degradation of the mutant protein. We also demonstrate that IκBβ preexists as two electrophoretically different variants: the major, slow migrating form, is degraded following stimulation; the minor, faster migrating form accumulates. Our study also suggests that, unlike IκBα, IκBβ is phosphorylated on Ser-19 and/or Ser-23 in noninduced cells. Therefore, these results suggest that IκBβ might differs from IκBα in that the critical event that targets IκBβ for degradation is not the induced phosphorylation of the two conserved serine residues located in the NH2-terminal region of the molecule.DISCUSSIONRecent data have provided some insight into the mechanisms leading to IκBα degradation (15Brockman J.A.

Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Google Scholar). The signal-induced degradation of this molecule is dependent upon the presence of an intact COOH-terminal PEST region as well as the induced phosphorylation of serine residues 32 and 36. This phosphorylation probably targets the molecule for ubiquitination on multiple residues, lysines 21 and 22 playing a central role (31Baldi L. Brown K. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 376-379Google Scholar, 32Scherer D.C. Brockman J.A. Chen Z. Maniatis T. Ballard D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11259-11263Google Scholar). This in turn targets the molecule for degradation by the 26 S proteasome (30Chen Z.J. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1586-1597Google Scholar), which takes place in the absence of dissociation between the inhibitor and NF-κB.The IκBβ molecule was originally purified and shown to be inactivated in vitro by dephosphorylation, in contrast to the situation observed with IκBα (38Link E. Kerr L.D. Schreck R. Zabel U. Verma I. Baeuerle P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 239-246Google Scholar). The recent cloning of IκBβ (10Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Google Scholar) demonstrated that the protein contained, like IκBα, a COOH-terminal PEST region, several ankyrin repeats, and an NH2-terminal region with two serines (at positions 19 and 23) in an environment similar to IκBα. A unique lysine residue was present in this region, at position 9. However, some differences could be observed between the two molecules following stimulation. First, although PMA, TNF, LPS, and IL-1 all induce degradation of IκBα, only LPS and IL-1 induced degradation of IκBβ in 70Z/3 cells (10Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Google Scholar). Second, the IκBα molecule is resynthesized rapidly following degradation, partly because the promoter of the IκBα gene is positively regulated by NF-κB. On the contrary, the IκBβ molecule is not resynthesized before the stimulus has ceased. This suggests that the promoter of the IκBβ gene does not respond to NF-κB. However, a more recent study seems to indicate that in different cell types the IκBβ molecule is also degraded in response to TNF-α (33Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2736-2746Google Scholar).Therefore, to get some insight into the mechanisms responsible for these different behaviors, we carried out a systematic analysis of the events leading to IκBβ degradation. In contrast to previous work (10Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Google Scholar), we found that IκBβ could be degraded in response to TNF-α and PMA in various murine cell lines (Fig. 2). However, the EL-4 T cell line shows a different susceptibility to TNF-α since only IκBα is degraded. This observation raised some important questions concerning the signaling pathway leading to the loss of IκBα and IκBβ. If the two inhibitors were targeted for proteolysis by the same pathway, they would be affected equally in response to a given stimulus. It is however possible that the weakness of the signal via the TNF-α receptor in this cell line could account for the phenomenon observed, since IκBβ can indeed be degraded by other stimuli (IL-1 and PMA) (data not shown).Following treatment of E29.1 murine T cells with TNF-α, two forms of IκBβ become detectable: a major upper form (form I), which is degraded progressively; and a minor lower form (form II), which accumulates progressively and appears to be resistant to degradation in response to TNF-α stimulation. The same kinetics of degradation is observed during treatment of 70Z/3 cells by LPS or PMA. The two forms of IκBβ are both associated with p65. Using cycloheximide, we demonstrated that form II is not derived from form I but requires ongoing protein synthesis to accumulate (Fig. 3A).Treatment of form I with alkaline phosphatase results in a partial conversion into a protein that comigrates with form II, suggesting that form I is a hyperphosphorylated form of form II (data not shown). These data suggest that this hyperphosphorylation might target form I for degradation.Based on the results obtained with IκBα, we asked whether serines 19 and 23 were the sites of phosphorylation responsible for IκBβ proteolysis. In accordance with this model, we observed that mutation of either of these two serines into an alanine abolished IκBβ degradation (Fig. 5). These results are consistent with a recent report (39Didonato J.A. Mercurio F. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1295-1304Google Scholar). However, the A19 A23 IκBβ mutant still exists as form I and form II, suggesting that form II is not derived from form I by dephosphorylation on Ser-19 and/or Ser-23 (Fig. 5, A and B).The IκBα PEST sequence is constitutively phosphorylated by a highly ubiquitous conserved kinase, casein kinase II. IκBα possesses several consensus sites for casein kinase II, and mutation of one of these sites increased the IκBα half-life (40Barroga C.F. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7637-7641Google Scholar). It has thus been hypothesized that the role of basal phosphorylation is to allow degradation of excess free IκBα by reducing its half-life. This PEST sequence also plays an important role in signal-dependent degradation of IκBα (16Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Google Scholar, 17Rodriguez M.S. Michalopoulos I. Arenzana S.F. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2413-2419Google Scholar, 19Whiteside S.T. Ernst M.K. LeBail O. Laurent-Winter C. Rice N. Israël A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5339-5345Google Scholar). As reported for IκBα, we also find that IκBβ-inducible proteolysis requires the PEST sequence present in its COOH-terminal region. However, deletion of the PEST sequence results in the disappearance of form II (Fig. 6). This suggests that form II differs from form I in its level of phosphorylation in the PEST region.In contrast to IκBα, mutation of lysine at position 9 inhibited weakly, if at all, IκBβ degradation, indicating that if this is a site of ubiquitination, its mutation does not prevent ubiquitination at other sites (Fig. 5). Furthermore, no upshift of the molecule could be observed following stimulation in the presence of ALLN, a proteasome inhibitor that prevents degradation of IκBα and IκBβ and allows accumulation of a hyperphosphorylated form of IκBα. However this lack of upshift does not necessary imply a lack of hyperphosphorylation of the molecule, as hyperphosphorylated murine IκBα migrates like its hypophosphorylated counterpart and is identified only by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis3 (19Whiteside S.T. Ernst M.K. LeBail O. Laurent-Winter C. Rice N. Israël A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5339-5345Google Scholar). To reveal hyperphosphorylated forms of IκBβ, we performed a two-dimensional gel analysis following various treatments of 70Z/3 cells. We observed that IκBβ preexists as multiple isoforms that most likely correspond, as for IκBα, to differentially phosphorylated forms. Interestingly, the isoforms observed in the presence of LPS and ALLN coincide exactly with those present in untreated cells, suggesting that their net charge does not change following stimulation.From these results we can conclude that serines 19 and 23 are critical determinants of IκBβ degradation but that their phosphorylation status does not seem to change following activation. One intriguing possibility is that they could be constitutively phosphorylated in untreated cells. To test this hypothesis, we compared HA wt ΔPEST and HA A19 A23 ΔPEST proteins, as the number of isoforms should be reduced following deletion of the PEST region. As hypothesized, we observe that mutation of serines 19 and 23 to alanines shifted all isoforms toward more basic pIs. Since these serine to alanines substitutions per se do not result in a modification of calculated pI, the observed difference in pI between the two proteins (0.1 pH unit) suggests that Ser-19 and/or Ser-23 is constitutively phosphorylated. Consequently, we found that the peptide containing serines 19 and 23 was constitutively phosphorylated in wt IκBβ molecules but not when serine 19 and 23 were mutated (Fig. 8). However this result has been obtained in transiently transfected cells as we never obtained enough radioactivity from 32P-labeled cells to carry out the analysis of IκBβ-derived phosphopeptides. The intriguing observation that Ser-19 and/or Ser-23 is constitutively phosphorylated is supported by the the fact that following treatment with calyculin A, a potent inhibitor of serine/threonine phosphatases, IκBα is degraded quickly, whereas the IκBβ molecule is not; but, surprisingly, it dissociates from p65 (Fig. 4). Although this situation is not very physiological, since treatment with calyculin A induces multiple nonspecific phosphorylations (see the multiple bands observed for p65 in Fig. 4, lanes 10-12), it tells us that hyperphosphorylation is unable to induce IκBβ degradation, thus supporting our hypothesis that Ser-19 and/or Ser-23 is constitutively phosphorylated and that this is not sufficient to trigger IκBβ proteolysis. In this context, several speculations can be made concerning the signaling pathways leading to the inducible degradation of IκBα and IκBβ. First, if the critical serine residues of IκBα and IκBβ are phosphorylated by the same kinase, then there should exist a mechanism maintaining serines 32 and 36 of IκBα unphosphorylated in uninduced cells. Since degradation of IκBα is induced by phosphatase inhibitors, it might be that a constitutive phosphatase, which is inactivated upon induction, is involved but does not recognize IκBβ. Alternatively, serines 32 and 36 of IκBα might be masked in resting cells and thus inaccessible to the kinase activity. Finally, the kinase might be constitutively associated with IκBβ but recruited to IκBα upon NF-κB activation. Alternatively, different kinases may phosphorylate the two IκB molecules.Second, if IκBβ is constitutively phosphorylated on Ser-19 and/or Ser-23, the nature of the signal responsible for targeting IκBβ for degradation remains to be identified. Because we have been unable to detect any inducible modification of IκBβ mobility after two-dimensional electrophoresis, we think it is unlikely that other IκBβ-specific phosphorylation events are involved. Alternatively, it might be that degradation per se is induced. For example, enzymes responsible for the ubiquitination of IκBβ could be activated following induction. A possible candidate would be the specific E3 involved. Indeed it has been demonstrated that in the case of E6-AP, activity can be regulated (41Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Google Scholar, 42Scheffner M. Werness B.A. Huibregtse J.M. Levine A.J. Howley P.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 1129-1136Google Scholar). A change in activity of the 26 S proteasome following induction could also constitute the inducible signal, as has been shown in the case of stimulation by interferon-γ (43Ahn J.Y. Tanahashi N. Akiyama K. Hisamatsu H. Noda C. Tanaka K. Chung C.H. Shibmara N. Willy P.J. Mott J.D. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. FEBS Lett. 1995; 366: 37-42Google Scholar). INTRODUCTIONThe transcription factor NF-κB 1The abbreviations used are: NF-κBnuclear factor-κBTNFtumor necrosis factorILinterleukinLPSlipopolysaccharidePMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateHAhemagglutininwtwild typeTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycineALLNN-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal. plays a central role in the regulation of genes implicated in the immune response and in inflammatory processes. NF-κB is composed of homo- and heterodimeric complexes of members of the Rel/NF-κB family of polypeptides. In vertebrates, this family comprises p50, p65 (RelA), c-Rel, p52, and RelB.In resting cells, NF-κB is cytosolic, but the nuclear translocation of this factor can be induced by multiple stimuli that act at different levels in the cell. Some, like TNF-α, IL-1, LPS, or antibodies against the T cell receptor-CD3 complex, act on an extracellular receptor, whereas others, like PMA and double-stranded RNA, activate intracellular second messengers (for review, see Refs. 1Israël A. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 203-205Google Scholar and 2Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Google Scholar).The molecular mechanism responsible for the cytosolic retention of NF-κB involves its association with the inhibitory ankyrin repeat-containing members of the IκB family of proteins. This family of inhibitors is mainly represented by IκBα and IκBβ (3Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1689-1698Google Scholar, 4Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1990; 344: 678-682Google Scholar) but also includes IκBγ, Bcl-3, p105, and p100 (for review, see Ref. 5Gilmore T.D. Morin P.J. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 427-433Google Scholar). p105 and p100, which are also the precursors of the p50 and p52 subunits of NF-κB, function as IκB proteins through association with p50, c-Rel or p65 (6Rice N.R. MacKichan M.L. Israël A. Cell. 1992; 46: 243-253Google Scholar, 7Mercurio F. Didonato J.A. Rosette C. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 705-718Google Scholar, 8Scheinman R.I. Beg A.A. Baldwin A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6089-6101Google Scholar). Among the different IκBs, IκBα and IκBβ play a major role in the regulation of NF-κB. These two proteins have been originally identified by partial purification (3Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1689-1698Google Scholar, 4Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1990; 344: 678-682Google Scholar). A cDNA clone has been isolated which encodes a 36-kDa protein called MAD-3, which appears to be identical to IκBα (9Haskill S. Beg A.A. Tompkins S.M. Morris J.S. Yurochko A.D. Sampson J.A. Mondal K. Ralph P. Baldwin A.J. Cell. 1991; 65: 1281-1289Google Scholar). The cloning of IκBβ cDNA is more recent, and this molecule has thus been characterized less thoroughly (10Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Google Scholar).Unlike IκBβ, the IκBα gene is positively regulated by NF-κB and glucocorticoids (10Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Google Scholar, 11Auphan N. Didonato J.A. Rosette C. Helmberg A. Karin M. Science. 1995; 270: 286-290Google Scholar, 12De Martin R. Vanhove B. Cheng Q. Hofer E. Csizmadia V.

Baldwin A.S. Science. 1995; 270: 283-286Google Scholar). IκBα and IκBβ associate with p50-p65 heterodimers and prevent the nuclear translocation of these complexes by masking their nuclear localization sequence. These two molecules are structurally similar as they contain multiple ankyrin repeats and a COOH-terminal PEST domain, a sequence known to be highly correlated to rapid protein turnover. The PEST domain of IκBα is involved in its degradation (15Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. McKinsey T.A. Hall S.M. Qi X.X. Lee W.Y. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell.

Rice N.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 872-882Google Scholar).Under the effect of a stimulus, IκBα becomes phosphorylated and is subsequently degraded, allowing NF-κB to translocate into the nucleus. The use of protease inhibitors has shed some light on the proteases responsible for IκBα degradation (21Alkalay I. Yaron A. Hatzubai A. Jung S. Avraham A. Gerlitz O. Pashut L.I. Ben-Neriah Y. Mol.

Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5433-5441Google Scholar). In the presence of an NF-κB inducer, proteasome inhibitors stabilize a phosphorylated form of IκBα characterized by a slow electrophoretic mobility. The observation that this retarded form is still associated with NF-κB invalidates the former hypothesis that IκBα phosphorylation induces its dissociation from NF-κB.Recently, the sites of phosphorylation of IκBα have been identified as two closely spaced serines at positions 32 and 36 in the NH2-terminal part of the protein (15Brockman J.A.

Mutation of these two serines to nonphosphorylatable residues prevents IκBα degradation, suggesting that their phosphorylation is a prerequisite for degradation. In addition, an in vitro study has also shown that only the hyperphosphorylated form of IκBα is degraded (29Alkalay I. Yaron A. Hatzubai A. Orian A. Ciechanover A. Ben-Neriah Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10599-10603Google Scholar). It has been reported that degradation of IκBα is triggered by ubiquitination (30Chen Z.J. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1586-1597Google Scholar). Ubiquitination occurs primarily on two adjacent lysines (Lys-21 and Lys-22) (31Baldi L. Brown K. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 376-379Google Scholar, 32Scherer D.C. Brockman J.A. Chen Z. Maniatis T. Ballard D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11259-11263Google Scholar).In thymocytes, IκBα is the main inhibitor of NF-κB, and the disruption of IκBα gene by homologous recombination results in a constitutively elevated level of nuclear NF-κB (33Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2736-2746Google Scholar). In contrast to hematopoietic cells, IκBα−/− embryonic fibroblasts behave as wild type cells because of the major role of the IκBβ molecule.A recent study concludes that TNF-α or PMA induces degradation of IκBα but not of IκBβ, suggesting that these two proteins are regulated differentially (10Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Google Scholar). The mechanisms responsible for the differential behavior of the two IκB molecules remain unresolved. We provide here some clues as to why these two molecules are regulated differentially. We first show that IκBβ degradation is blocked by proteasome inhibitors, suggesting an involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, similar to what has been described for IκBα. These similarities are confirmed by the identification of two critical sites of phosphorylation (Ser-19 and Ser-23) whose mutations decrease the rate of signal-induced degradation of IκBβ. However, IκBβ contains only one lysine NH2-terminal to ankyrin repeats, and its mutation does not prevent the signal-induced degradation of the mutant protein. We also demonstrate that IκBβ preexists as two electrophoretically different variants: the major, slow migrating form, is degraded following stimulation; the minor, faster migrating form accumulates. Our study also suggests that, unlike IκBα, IκBβ is phosphorylated on Ser-19 and/or Ser-23 in noninduced cells. Therefore, these results suggest that IκBβ might differs from IκBα in that the critical event that targets IκBβ for degradation is not the induced phosphorylation of the two conserved serine residues located in the NH2-terminal region of the molecule."

https://openalex.org/W2017920842,"The induction of cellulases by cellulose, an insoluble polymer, in the filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei is puzzling. We previously proposed a mechanism that is based on the presence of low levels of cellulase in the uninduced fungus; this basal cellulase activity would digest cellulose-releasing oligosaccharides that could enter the cell and trigger expression of cellulases. We now present experiments that lend further support to this model. We show here that transcripts of two members of the cellulase system, cbh1 and egl1, are present in uninduced T. reesei cells.

We also show that a construct containing the hygromycin B resistance-encoding gene driven by the cbh1 promoter confers hygromycin B resistance to T. reesei cells grown in the absence of cellulose. Moreover, cellulose-induced production of the cbh1 transcript was suppressed when antisense RNA against three members of the cellulase system was expressed in vivo Experiments are presented indicating that extracellular cellulase activity is the rate-limiting event in induction of synthesis of the cellulase transcripts by cellulose.

INTRODUCTIONCellulose, a β-(1,4)-linked glucose polymer, is a product of the utilization of solar energy and carbon dioxide by plants, through photosynthesis, a process which is estimated to produce 7.2 × 1010 tons of cellulosic biomass annually (1Ljungdahl L.G. Eriksson K.E. Adv. Microb. Ecol. 1985; 5: 237-299Google Scholar). The degradation and oxidation of cellulose to carbon dioxide, a process carried out mainly by microorganisms, is a key transformation step in the biological carbon cycle in nature (2Gottschalk G. Aubert J.-P. Béguin P. Millet J. Biochemistry and Genetics of Cellulase Degradation. Academic Press, New York1985: 3-8Google Scholar). The filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei is considered to be the most efficient producer of cellulases (3Montenecourt B.S. Trends Biotechnol. 1983; 1: 156-161Google Scholar, 4Béguin P. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1990; 44: 219-248Google Scholar). Its cellulases are classified into two broad classes: cellobiohydrolases (CBH), 1The abbreviations used are: CBHcellobiohydrolaseEGendoglucanasePCRpolymerase chain reactionbpbase pair(s)kbkilobase pair(s). whose major activity involves the cleavage of cellobiose residues consecutively from the ends of the cellulose chains (5Barr B.K. Hsieh Y.-L. Ganem B. Wilson D.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 586-592Google Scholar), and endoglucanases (EG), whose major activity involves the cleavage of β-glycosidic bonds in the cellulose chain (6Ståhlberg J. Johansson G.

Bio/Technology. 1987; 5: 60-64Google Scholar).In T. reesei, cellulase transcripts are induced when the natural inducer cellulose is the only carbon source available (16Abrahão-Neto J. Rossini C.H.B. El-Gogary S. Henrique-Silva F. Crivellaro O. El-Dorry H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10456-10462Google Scholar). The natural cellulose is insoluble; hence, we developed an interest in studying how this insoluble polymer, which cannot traverse the cell membrane, would induce cellulase production. Previously published observations suggested that basal levels of cellulolytic enzymes may be necessary to generate soluble breakdown products of cellulose such as sophorose (2-O-β-glucopyranosyl-D-glucose), a soluble disaccharide inducer of cellulase synthesis (17Mandels M. Parrish F.W. Reese E.T. J. Bacteriol. 1962; 83: 400-408Google Scholar), which could pass through the cell wall and initiate the inductive process. Experimental evidence in vitro was reported supporting this mechanism. The potential soluble disaccharide sophorose was detected, as well as other glucose disaccharides, during growth of T. reesei on cellobiose (18Mandels M. Reese E.T. J. Bacteriol. 1960; 79: 816-826Google Scholar), and after hydrolysis of cellulose with the T. reesei cellulase system (19Vaheri M. Leisola M. Kauppinen V. Biotechnol. Lett. 1979; 1: 41-46Google Scholar). A membrane-bound β-glucosidase is believed to catalyze the formation of sophorose through its transglycosylation activity (20Kubicek C.P. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1987; 133: 1481-1487Google Scholar). Indirect evidence was also reported showing that the presence of antibodies to the major cellulase inhibited production of the cbh1 transcript with cellulose present. However, the antibodies did not affect transcription of the cbh1 transcript when sophorose was present (21El-Gogary S. Leite A. Crivellaro O. Eveleigh D. El-Dorry H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6138-6141Google Scholar).In this study, we present evidence for the requirement of basal levels of cellulases by showing: 1) the presence of the transcripts of two major members of the cellulase system, cbh1 and egl1, in uninduced T. reesei cells; 2) the activity of a reporter gene driven by the cbh1 promoter in the absence of cellulose; and 3) the inhibition of cbh1 expression under celulose but not under sophorose by expressing antisense RNA against three members of the cellulase system. We also show that increasing the concentration of added cellulase decreases the time necessary for the induction of synthesis of the cbh1 and egl1 transcripts. Moreover, extracellularly added purified cellulases also have a positive effect on cbh1 and egl1 expression, consistent with a model in which induction is dependent on the extracellular activity of cellulases.DISCUSSIONIn T. reesei, cellulase is an inducible enzyme system that has drawn considerable interest regarding the mechanism by which the insoluble inducer cellulose triggers synthesis of the cellulase transcripts. The proposed mechanism of cellulase induction is that the fungus produces basal levels of cellulase and that the activity of these extracellular enzymes on cellulose produces a soluble inducer, which can enter the cell and effect induction (18Mandels M. Reese E.T. J. Bacteriol. 1960; 79: 816-826Google Scholar, 31Sternberg D. Mandels G.R. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 139: 761-769Google Scholar). In support of this mechanism, we have previously shown that antibodies against CBHI, CBHII, EGI, and EGII blocked the expression of cbh1 gene in the presence of cellulose but not the soluble inducer sophorose (21El-Gogary S. Leite A. Crivellaro O. Eveleigh D. El-Dorry H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6138-6141Google Scholar). However, these constitutive levels of cellulases and their direct role in cellulase induction have not been conclusively demonstrated.The results presented here show that the mRNAs of the major members of the cellulase system, cbh1 and egl1, are transcribed under uninduced conditions, and that induction with cellulose results in at least 1100-fold increase of both transcripts. To examine further the basal activity of the promoter of the cbh1 gene, we constructed a chimeric vector in which the gene encoding hygromycin B phosphotransferase (22Gritz L. Davies J. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 25: 179-188Google Scholar) was placed under the control of the 5′-flanking DNA sequence of the cbh1 gene. Indeed, under uninduced conditions, resistance to the antibiotic hygromycin B was observed with T. reesei cells transformed with this construct and grown on medium lacking cellulose. These sets of experiments indicate that the promoters of cbh1 and egl1 are transcriptionally active under uninduced conditions, and that the basal activity of the cbh1 promoter is sufficient to drive expression of a heterologous gene such as the hygromycin B resistance-encoding gene.We also used an antisense RNA strategy to present direct and in vivo evidence for the requirement of the basal expression of the cellulase in induction of the cellulase transcripts by cellulose. The major cellulases from T. reesei, CBHI, CBHII, EGI, and EGII, have glucanase activities with overlapping specificity (6Ståhlberg J. Johansson G. Petterson G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1157: 107-113Google Scholar). Therefore, we decided to express an antisense RNA composed of parts of the coding sequences against cbh2, egl1, and egl2 mRNAs in T. reesei and examine the expression of the cbh1 transcript. The results show that the expression of this antisense RNA produced marked effects on the induction of the cbh1 transcript using cellulose but not sophorose as an inducer. The reduction of the expression of the cbh1 transcript by cellulose was between 80 and 90% in experiments with three independent transformants.In this study we also present evidence indicating that the initial hydrolysis of cellulose is the rate-limiting step in the inductive process. This conclusion is based on the fact that the addition of the cellulase system or its purified enzyme members to a culture of T. reesei, in the presence of cellulose, resulted in earlier detection of the cbh1 and egl1 transcripts. That the inducer is produced from the cell wall of T. reesei cells, and not from cellulose, or that cellulase itself acts as inducer are ruled out, since the addition of cellulase in the absence of cellulose does not affect expression of cellulase transcripts (data not shown). The time required for induction of cbh1 and egl1 transcripts using cellulose, cellulose + cellulase, or sophorose is 14, 10, and 4 h, respectively. This result supports our hypothesis that oligosaccharide(s) is(are) formed in vivo from cellulose by the activity of a low, constitutive, and extracellular cellulase activity. The relatively slow induction by sophorose could be explained by the fact that the inductive process is protein synthesis-dependent (data not shown). In addition, it has recently been shown that a sophorose-inducible β-diglucoside permease is involved in the induction of the cellulase system in T. reesei (32Kubicek C.P. Messner R. Gruber F. Mandels M. Kubicek-Pranz E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19364-19368Google Scholar).In summary, our results demonstrate that in T. reesei (i) the transcripts of two members of the cellulase system, cbh1 and egl1, are expressed at a low level in the absence of added inducer and are induced at least 1100-fold by cellulose; (ii) the promoter of the major member of the cellulase system, cbh1, is able to drive basal expression of a reporter gene placed under its control; (iii) expression of antisense RNA against the cbh2, egl1, and egl2 mRNAs resulted in inhibition of induction of the cbh1 transcript by cellulose but not sophorose; and (iv) the kinetic of expression of the cbh1 and egl1 transcripts by cellulose is influenced by the addition of cellulase to the culture medium.Taken together, these results support a model that requires the presence of basal activity of cellulases for the induction of their own transcripts by cellulose. The identification of genes involved in this process and their mode of action will be critical to completely understand how the induction occurs at the molecular level. INTRODUCTIONCellulose, a β-(1,4)-linked glucose polymer, is a product of the utilization of solar energy and carbon dioxide by plants, through photosynthesis, a process which is estimated to produce 7.2 × 1010 tons of cellulosic biomass annually (1Ljungdahl L.G. Eriksson K.E. Adv. Microb. Ecol. 1985; 5: 237-299Google Scholar). The degradation and oxidation of cellulose to carbon dioxide, a process carried out mainly by microorganisms, is a key transformation step in the biological carbon cycle in nature (2Gottschalk G. Aubert J.-P. Béguin P. Millet J. Biochemistry and Genetics of Cellulase Degradation. Academic Press, New York1985: 3-8Google Scholar). The filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei is considered to be the most efficient producer of cellulases (3Montenecourt B.S. Trends Biotechnol. 1983; 1: 156-161Google Scholar, 4Béguin P. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1990; 44: 219-248Google Scholar). Its cellulases are classified into two broad classes: cellobiohydrolases (CBH), 1The abbreviations used are: CBHcellobiohydrolaseEGendoglucanasePCRpolymerase chain reactionbpbase pair(s)kbkilobase pair(s). whose major activity involves the cleavage of cellobiose residues consecutively from the ends of the cellulose chains (5Barr B.K. Hsieh Y.-L. Ganem B. Wilson D.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 586-592Google Scholar), and endoglucanases (EG), whose major activity involves the cleavage of β-glycosidic bonds in the cellulose chain (6Ståhlberg J. Johansson G. Petterson G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1157: 107-113Google Scholar). The members of this system act synergistically and are necessary for the efficient hydrolysis of cellulose to soluble oligosaccharides (7Henrissat B. Driguez H. Viet C. Schulein M.

The angiotensin AT1 receptor-activated increases in [Ca2+]i were selectively inhibited by injection of antisense oligonucleotides directed against the mRNAs coding for the α13, β1, and γ3 subunits. A correlating reduction in Gα13, Gβ1, and Gγ3 protein expression was confirmed by immunocytochemistry. In addition, anti-α13 antibody and synthetic peptide corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of the Gα13 subunit inhibited, in a concentration-dependent manner, the angiotensin AT1 receptor-mediated Ca2+ response. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that only the angiotensin AT1A receptor was expressed in rat portal vein smooth muscle. Furthermore, injection of anti-AT1A oligonucleotides selectively inhibited the angiotensin II-induced increase in [Ca2+]i. We conclude that the receptor-activated signal leading to increases in [Ca2+]i is transduced by the heterotrimeric G13 protein composed of α13/β1/γ3 subunits and that the carboxyl terminus of the Gα13 subunit interacts with the angiotensin AT1A receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2030068060,"Microsomal glutathione S-transferase-II (GST-II) has recently been discovered and characterized as a member of the 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP)/5(S)-hydroxy-6(R)-S-glutathionyl-7,9-trans-11,14-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid (LTC4) synthase gene family, which also includes microsomal glutathione S-transferase-I (GST-I) as a distant member of this gene family. This new enzyme is unique as it is the only member of this family capable of efficiently conjugating reduced glutathione to both 5,6-oxido-7,9,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (LTA4) and 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene. Although microsomal GST-II has been demonstrated to display both general glutathione S-transferase (GST) and specific LTC4 synthase activities, its biological function remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the physiological location of microsomal GST-II as well as the relative importance of this enzyme versus LTC4 synthase for the production of LTC4 in various human tissues and cells that have been previously demonstrated to possess LTC4 synthase activity. As determined by Western blot, microsomal GST-II was predominantly expressed in human liver microsomes, human endothelial cell membranes, and sparsely detected in human lung membranes. In contrast, LTC4 synthase was prevalent in human lung membranes, human platelet homogenates, and human kidney tissue. Concomitant to the formation of LTC4, microsomal GST-II also produces a new metabolite of LTA4, a postulated LTC4 isomer. This isomer was used to distinguish between microsomal GST-II and LTC4 synthase activities involved in the biosynthesis of LTC4. Based on the relative production of LTC4 to the LTC4 isomer, microsomal GST-II was demonstrated to be the principal enzyme responsible for LTC4 production in human liver microsomes and human endothelial cells and played a minor role in the formation of LTC4 in human lung membranes. In comparison, LTC4 synthase was the main enzyme capable of catalyzing the conjugation of reduced glutathione to LTA4 in human lung membranes and human platelet homogenates. Therefore, microsomal GST-II appears to be an integral component in the detoxification of biological systems due to its marked presence in human liver, in accordance with its known GST activity. Microsomal GST-II, however, may also be pivotal for cysteinyl leukotriene formation in endothelial cells, and this could change our current understanding of the regulation of leukotriene biosynthesis in inflammatory disorders such as asthma.

https://openalex.org/W2027308552,"Adhesion molecules such as VLA-4 are important not only for monocyte adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins, but also for subsequent cell activation. Monocyte adherence to fibronectin or engagement of VLA-4 has been demonstrated to stimulate production of potent inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1, and the procoagulant tissue factor protein. However, the intracellular signaling cascades leading to gene expression have not been elucidated. Using the human monocytic THP-1 cell line, VLA-4 cross-linking by monoclonal antibodies directed against its α4 and β1 subunits produced a time-dependent increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of a broad range of cellular proteins. Using Western blot analysis directed against the phosphorylated form of the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase proteins, as well as immunoprecipitation and in vitro kinase assays, we found that VLA-4 cross-linking increased ERK1/ERK2 tyrosine phosphorylation and activity. In conjunction, integrin cross-linking also increased NF-κB nuclear translocation and 4-h expression of tissue factor. Inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity with genistein (10 μg/ml) as well as selective MAP kinase inhibition with the MEK-1 inhibitor PD98059 abolished the VLA-4-dependent ERK tyrosine phosphorylation, inhibited NF κB nuclear binding, and abrogated tissue factor expression induced by both VLA-4 cross-linking and adhesion to fibronectin in THP-1 cells and human peripheral blood monocytes. These studies point to the involvement of the MAP kinase pathway in the activation of monocytic cells during transmigration to inflammatory sites.

These studies point to the involvement of the MAP kinase pathway in the activation of monocytic cells during transmigration to inflammatory sites. The integrin family of surface adhesion molecules plays a key role in leukocyte recruitment to areas of extravascular inflammation. These heterodimeric integral membrane proteins are important not only for the adhesion to and transmigration across endothelial barriers, but also for adhesive interactions with extracellular matrix proteins (1Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Google Scholar, 2Osborn L. Cell. 1990; 62: 3-6Google Scholar, 3Hogg N. Berlin C. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 327-329Google Scholar). While initially considered important only for their adhesive properties, recent studies have suggested that integrin engagement can initiate signal transduction pathways contributing to cellular activation (4Rosales C.

Monocyte recruitment to extravascular sites is an important component of the host response to a variety of stimuli including bacterial infection, tumor deposits, and atherosclerotic plaques. In this location, the surface expression as well as release of a number of macrophage products serve to coordinate the local inflammatory response. Fibrin deposition induced by macrophage tissue factor (TF) 1The abbreviations used are: TFtissue factorERKextracellular signal-related kinaseMAPmitogen-activated proteinPBMperipheral blood monocytesMEKMAP kinase kinaseLPSlipopolysaccharideFCSfetal calf serummAbmonoclonal antibodyAbantibodyPCAprocoagulant activityPMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideMBPmyelin basic proteinDTTdithiothreitolPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. expression is known to contribute significantly to the development of this response. Within the vascular space, adherence of monocytes to the endothelium stimulates expression of TF on monocytes, a process that likely contributes to local microvascular thrombosis (9Brisseau G.F.

Immunol. 1995; 154: 4768-4777Google Scholar). Furthermore, at extravascular sites, products of both the coagulation and fibrinolytic cascades contribute to the generation of the inflammatory response through their interaction with infiltrating cells. Indeed, strategies aimed at reducing fibrin deposition or precluding TF expression have been shown to mitigate the full expression of both the local and systemic inflammatory response depending on the model system studied (9Brisseau G.F.

For example, ligation of VLA-4 by monoclonal antibody in both human peripheral blood monocytes (PBM) and in the monocytic THP-1 cell line promotes TF expression, whereas engagement of β2 integrins has little effect (20Fan S.-T. Mackman N. Cui M.-Z. Edgington T.S. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 3266-3274Google Scholar). The intracellular signaling mechanisms leading to the VLA-4-mediated induction of TF as well as other inflammatory genes appears to involve the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation (16Lin T.H.

Recent studies by Lin and colleagues have implicated a possible signaling role for Syk tyrosine kinase in this process (18Lin T.H. Rosales C. Mondal K. Bolen J.B. Haskill S. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16189-16197Google Scholar). In human monocytic THP-1 cells, VLA-4 engagement caused prominent tyrosine phosphorylation as well as activation of Syk tyrosine kinase, an effect that occurred in concert with the induction of the interleukin-1β gene. Integrin engagement through interaction with extracellular matrix proteins has been shown to contribute to the regulation of cellular growth and differentiation and to modulate tumor behavior (1Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Google Scholar). In fibroblasts, this process involves tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of MAP kinase through a cascade involving Raf-1 and MEK (1Clark E.A. Brugge J.S.

Immunol. 1995; 154: 4039-4047Google Scholar), its contribution to the β1 integrin-induced activation of inflammatory cell gene expression is unknown. In the present studies, engagement of VLA-4 on the surface of THP-1 monocytic cells and on human monocytes, both through integrin cross-linking and attachment to a fibronectin substratum, was shown to induce tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the ERK1/ERK2 MAP kinases. This effect occurred in parallel with nuclear translocation of NF-κB and stimulation of TF on the surface of these cells. Furthermore, we took advantage of the existence of a novel selective inhibitor of MEK1 to define the contribution of this pathway to integrin-induced TF expression. This agent, PD98059, caused a dose-dependent inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of MAP kinase in response to VLA-4 engagement and concomitantly prevented NF-κB translocation and TF induction. Considered together, these studies support a contribution of the MAP kinase pathway to integrin-induced gene expression in cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage. Genistein was purchased from Calbiochem and prepared in Me2SO at 10 mg/ml. The selective MEK-1 inhibitor PD98059 was the kind gift of Dr. R. Saltiel, and was prepared in Me2SO. Escherichia coli O111:B4 lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., as were endotoxin-free RPMI and HBSS media. Fetal calf serum (FCS) was from HyClone. The following antibodies were used in the integrin engagement studies: mouse IgG1 anti-CD49d (mAb HP2.1 (Immunotech) and mAb 44H6 (Serotec)), CD29 (mAb K20 and mAb Lia1.2 (Immunotech)), goat F(ab′)2 anti-mouse IgG (Immunotech), mouse IgG1 anti-CD45 mAb 1214 (PDI Bioscience), and negative mouse IgG1 (Serotec). Inhibitory anti-tissue factor antibody (mAb 4509) was obtained from American Diagnostica. Human monocytic THP-1 cells (ATCC) were propagated in RPMI/10% FCS/penicillin/streptomycin at 37°C, 5% CO2. Human PBM were isolated from the blood of normal healthy donors by centrifugation over a Ficoll-Hypaque gradient at 400 × g for 20 min. The mononuclear layer was aspirated, washed twice and resuspended in RPMI/2% FCS/L-glutamine. This cell population contained 25-35% monocytes as assessed by Wright's stain and CD14 expression (flow cytometry with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD14 Ab; Becton-Dickinson), with >96% viability by trypan blue exclusion and propidium iodide uptake. For integrin engagement studies, THP-1 cells were suspended in RPMI/2% FCS/L-Gln at 5 × 106 cells/ml. Surface CD29, CD49d, and CD45 antigens were ligated with monoclonal antibody for 25 min at 15 μg/ml and 4°C, washed twice in cold RPMI, and then cross-linked with 5 μg/ml goat anti-mouse F(ab′)2 for 25 min at 4°C. The concentration of primary antibody was shown to be saturating by flow cytometry (data not shown). Cells were washed twice in cold RPMI, resuspended in RPMI/2% FCS/L-Gln and incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 for times ranging from 1 min to 4 h. Reactions were stopped by placing the cells on ice. For cell adhesion studies, six-well polystyrene culture plates were coated either with 1 mg/ml poly-L-lysine or 0.05 mg/ml fibronectin for 1 h at 25°C. Poly-L-lysine was cross-linked under UV light for 2 h; all wells were then washed twice in cold RPMI and blocked for 1 h with RPMI/10% FCS at 37°C. THP-1 (1 × 106) or PBM (0.5 × 106) were layered onto the coated wells and allowed to settle for 25 min at 4°C, and then brought to 37°C for up to 4 h before being placed on ice. In inhibition studies, THP-1 cells or human PBM were preincubated in the presence of 1 and 10 μM PD98059 or 10 μg/ml genistein for 45 min at 4°C. At 4 h, THP-1 cells (0.5 × 106) were sedimented at 1000 × g for 3 min. The cell pellet was resuspended at 106 cells/ml RPMI, freeze-thawed at −70°C, and procoagulant activity (PCA) measured by single-stage recalcification clotting assay (36Brisseau G.F. Dackiw A.P.B. Cheung P.Y.C. Christie N. Rotstein O.D. Blood. 1995; 85: 1025-1035Google Scholar). PCA was expressed as milliunits/106 cells by comparison to rabbit brain thromboplastin. In a typical experiment, β1 integrin cross-linking shortened clotting times from 70 s to 56 s, representing an increase in PCA from 74 milliunits/106 cells to 376 milliunits/106 cells. In the cell adhesion studies, THP-1 or PBM were harvested using a rubber policeman over ice after a 4 h incubation, washed, and resuspended at 106 cells/ml RPMI for PCA assessment. PCA was attributed to TF expression on the basis of a complete reversal of PCA with inhibitory anti-TF antibody (see “Results”) and failure of FVII-deficient serum to clot (data not shown). Following integrin cross-linking, THP-1 cells were lysed in ice-cold cell lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 mM NaF, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, and 1 mM PMSF. Postnuclear supernatants were collected following centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min and diluted with 2 × Laemmli buffer, 0.1 M dithiothreitol (DTT). Following adhesion to poly-L-lysine or fibronectin substrata, PBM were lysed in the culture wells with ice-cold lysis buffer and prepared in a similar fashion. Lysates prepared from 100,000 cells were separated on 12.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Mobilion). Blots were then probed with polyclonal rabbit (Transduction Laboratories) anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, rabbit anti-phospho-ERK antibody (New England Biolabs), rabbit anti-ERK1 or -ERK2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies). Following incubation with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma), blots were developed using an ECL-based system (Amersham). Cells (3 × 106) were lysed as above and the postnuclear supernatant precleared with Protein G-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Cellular proteins were immunocomplexed using polyclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Transduction) or anti-ERK-1 and -ERK-2 antibody (SCB) for 1 h at 4°C. Protein G-Sepharose was added and incubated at 4°C for 1 h. The resulting immune complexes were washed five times with cold phosphate-buffered saline/0.01% Tween 20, and then separated from beads by 2 × Laemmli buffer, 0.1 M DTT and boiling at 100°C for 5 min. Beads were then sedimented by ultracentrifugation and the supernatant collected for Western blot analysis. ERK-2 immunocomplexes were washed with five changes of cold phosphate-buffered saline/0.01% Tween 20, and then incubated for 30 min at 30°C with 20 μg of ultra-pure myelin basic protein (MBP, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) in kinase assay buffer composed of 0.4 mM cold and 0.4 mM [γ-32P]ATP (DuPont NEN), 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and 10 mM MgCl2. Reactions were stopped with the addition of 2 × Laemmli buffer, 0.1 M DTT and boiling at 100°C for 5 min. Equal volumes were loaded and run on 10% SDS-PAGE. The radioactivity of the phosphorylated MBP band running at 20 kDa was quantified on a Molecular Dynamics SI PhosphorImager. Following cell activation by VLA-4 cross-linking, 5 million THP-1 cells were washed twice in cold HBSS and lysed in 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.5 mM PMSF, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Following centrifugation at 13,000 rpm (4°C) for 10 min, the nuclear pellet was resuspended in 15 μl/107 cells extract buffer containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 25% glycerol, 420 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.5 mM PMSF, 0.5 mM spermidine, 0.15 mM spermine, and 5 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin. Supernatants were collected after a 15-min centrifugation at 14,000 rpm (4°C) and diluted with 75 μl of buffer containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 20% glycerol, 0.2 mM EDTA, 50 mM KCl, 0.5 mM DTT, and 0.5 mM PMSF and immediately frozen on dry ice. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). 5 μg of nuclear extract protein were preincubated with the nonspecific DNA competitor poly(dI-dC) (5 μg, Pharmacia) for 10 min at room temperature. 32P-Radiolabeled probe containing 2 NF-κB sites derived from the human immunodeficiency virus-1 enhancer (HIV-ENH), or containing the TF-specific NF-κB site (49Mackman N. Brand K. Edgington T.S. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1517-1526Google Scholar), was incubated for an additional 20 min at room temperature. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide (60:1 cross-link)/Tris glycine gel and autoradiographs prepared by exposure at −70°C using a Kodak X-Omat film. To demonstrate specificity of the protein-DNA complex, 125 M excess of unlabeled probe or mutated TF κB probe was added to the nuclear extract before adding the radiolabeled probe. The sequences of the plus strands of the oligonucletides used were as follows. The data are represented as the mean and standard error of the indicated number of experiments. Where representative studies are shown, these are indicative of at least three equivalent studies. Statistical comparisons were made for continuous data using one-way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey. For comparisons of experiments involving two treatment groups only, the two-tailed Student's t test was employed. Fig. 1A demonstrates that cross-linking of either the β1 or α4 subunits of VLA-4 induces a time-dependent increase in phosphotyrosine accumulation in THP-1 cells. The increase occurred within 1 min, reached a maximum at 5-10 min, and persisted for ∼30 min. While receptor ligation alone caused a small increase in phosphotyrosine residues, cross-linking markedly amplified this effect (Fig. 1B). This effect was not due to the addition of the secondary antibody per se, since this did not induce phosphotyrosine accumulation (Fig. 1C). We also compared the effect of cross-linking using antibodies directed against different epitopes of the α4β1 integrin. As shown in Fig. 1D, cross-linking of α4β1 with the inhibitory antibody Lial 1.2 directed against the β1 subunit caused a similar pattern of phosphotyrosine accumulation compared with the non-inhibitory antibody K20, although the magnitude was somewhat less. HP2/1, an inhibitory antibody directed against the α4 subunit caused similar accumulation of phosphotyrosine residues, while use of 44H6, also directed against α4, failed to induce tyrosine phosphorylation despite surface binding equivalent to mAb HP2/1. (data not shown, as assessed by flow cytometry, Coulter Epics MCL). Finally, the effect was not due to the process of cross-linking of surface antigen per se, since neither cross-linking with mAb 1214 (Fig. 1C) nor 44H6 induced an increase in tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (Fig. 1D). As for 44H6, mAb 1214 had surface binding characteristics equivalent to K20 and HP2/1 (data not shown, as assessed by flow cytometry). Endotoxin is known to cause tyrosine phosphorylation in monocytic cells (31Liu M.K. Brownsey R.W. Reiner N.E. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 2722-2727Google Scholar, 34Liu M.K. Herrera-Velit P. Brownsey R.W. Reiner N.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2642-2652Google Scholar). The observed effect of cross-linking was unlikely to be due to endotoxin contamination of the system. Polymyxin B did not reverse the stimulation of phosphotyrosine accumulation, and heating of the primary antibody prior to incubation with the cells completely prevented induction of tyrosine phosphorylation. Furthermore, as indicated above, neither primary nor secondary antibody alone mimicked the stimulatory effect. While cross-linking induced a pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation encompassing a broad range of proteins, cross-linking with K20 caused some degree of persistent phosphorylation in the 42-50-kDa range. To determine whether p44 ERK1/p42 ERK2 MAP kinases might be among the candidate substrate proteins, cell lysates were probed first for phosphotyrosine residues, and the blots stripped and reprobed for p42 ERK2 and p44 ERK1. Both ERK proteins comigrated with an area of VLA-4-induced persistent tyrosine phosphorylation (data not shown). Importantly, the absolute amount of ERK protein in the cell lysates did not change over time following integrin engagement. To conclusively identify the ERK proteins as targets of the VLA-4-induced tyrosine phosphorylation, two approaches were used. First, immunoprecipitation studies were carried out at 5 min after cell stimulation. The upper panel of Fig. 2A shows a blot of immunoprecipitated tyrosine phosphoproteins probed with anti-ERK2 Ab under each of the treatment conditions. Integrin cross-linking with K20 markedly enhances the amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated ERK2 protein compared with control cells, while engagement alone causes a slight increase. A similar effect is observed when cell lysates are sedimented with either anti-ERK1 Ab or anti-ERK2 Ab and then probed with anti-phosphotyrosine Ab (Fig. 2A, middle and lower panels, respectively). Similar results were obtained when cell surface integrins were cross-linked with mAb against the α4 subunit (data not shown). ERK phosphorylation induced by VLA-4 cross-linking was also evaluated by Western blot studies using an antibody specific to ERK phosphorylated on tyrosine residues. Cross-linking of VLA-4 by mAb against the β1 subunit induced a time-dependent increase in ERK tyrosine phosphorylation, particularly of the p42 ERK2 (Fig. 2B). This effect occurred early, peaked at 30 min, and persisted for at least 60 min. This was accompanied by a slight retardation in the electrophoretic mobility, consistent with phosphorylation of ERK2. Integrin ligation alone caused a somewhat delayed rise in phospho-ERK accumulation, although cross-linking induced more phosphorylation at any given time point. Having demonstrated tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK1/ERK2 proteins, studies were performed to evaluate their level of activation. Using MBP as a substrate, Fig. 3 (A and B) shows that cross-linking of α4 and β1 subunits of VLA-4, respectively, cause a time-dependent increase in immunoprecipitated ERK2 activity, the magnitude of which is similar to that seen with 1 μg/ml LPS. Similar results were seen with immunoprecipitated ERK-1, although the increase in activity stimulated by VLA-4 engagement was less, approximately 2-3-fold (data not shown). As expected from the pattern of induction of phosphotyrosine accumulation, cross-linking mAb Lia1.2 markedly increased immunoprecipitated ERK2 activity, while cross-linking 44H6 or mAb 1214 had little to no effect (data not shown). To determine whether adhesion to a physiological substratum might induce a similar activation of ERK, human cells were plated onto fibronectin or poly-L-lysine substrata. Fig. 4A shows the pattern of accumulation of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in response to adhesion to the indicated substratum. In particular, proteins with molecular masses corresponding to 42, 72, 85, and 95 kDa were tyrosine-phosphorylated in fibronectin-exposed cells but not in cells adhered to poly-L-lysine. This pattern generally corresponded to that observed for VLA-4 cross-linking by antibodies in suspended, although the pattern was less complex (compare with Fig. 1). Tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK following adhesion was also evaluated by immunoprecipitation. Cell lysates were recovered at varying time points after adhesion to fibronectin or poly-L-lysine, and ERK2 was immunoprecipitated and probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. As shown in Fig. 4B, there was there was a time-dependent rise in phosphorylated ERK in fibronectin-exposed cells, but not in those adhered to poly-L-lysine. Total ERK protein after immunoprecipitation did not differ between substrata (data not shown). Recent studies have reported the development of a synthetic inhibitor of the MAP kinase pathway. This compound, PD98059, was shown to specifically block the activation of MEK1, the upstream activator of ERK1/ERK2, without an effect on other protein kinases including the stress activated protein kinases and p38 (37Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Google Scholar, 38Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Google Scholar). Having demonstrated that VLA-4 cross-linking was able to induce activation of ERK1/ERK2, we used this agent to discern the role of this pathway in stimulating gene expression in macrophages in response to integrin engagement. First, the effect of PD98059 on VLA-4-stimulated ERK activation was studied. PD98059 prevented ERK-2 activation following VLA-4 cross-linking in a dose-dependent manner, with complete inhibition at 10 μM (Fig. 5, A and B). Binding studies with the flow cytometer and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary Ab demonstrated that PD98059 did not influence overall binding of antibody to integrin (data not shown). Consistent with its known mechanism of action, PD98059 also inhibited the increase in phospho-ERK which occurs in response to VLA-4 cross-linking (Fig. 5C). In addition, this agent prevented the slight mobility shift observed with activation of ERK. The inhibitory effect of PD98059 occurred without altering cell viability, as assessed by propidium iodide uptake, and also had no effect on total cellular levels of the predominant isoform ERK2 (data not shown). In a similar fashion, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein (10 μg/ml) also decreased ERK2 activation (Fig. 5, A and B). Fig. 5D demonstrates that genistein causes a global reduction in the level of tyrosine phosphoproteins following cross-linking of β1, while PD98059 has little effect on the overall pattern of phosphorylation. Considered together, these studies demonstrate that both tyrosine kinase inhibition as well as inhibition of MEK-1 activation are able to prevent ERK activation in response to VLA-4 cross-linking.

https://openalex.org/W2052993818,"Escherichia coli leader peptidase, which catalyzes the cleavage of signal peptides from pre-proteins, is an essential, integral membrane serine peptidase that has its active site residing in the periplasmic space. It contains a conserved lysine residue that has been proposed to act as the general base, abstracting the proton from the side chain hydroxyl group of the nucleophilic serine 90. To help elucidate the role of the essential lysine 145 in the activity of E. coli leader peptidase, we have combined site-directed mutagenesis and chemical modification methods to introduce unnatural amino acid side chains at the 145-position. We show that partial activity can be restored to an inactive K145C leader peptidase mutant by reacting it with 2-bromoethylamine·HBr to produce a lysine analog (γ-thia-lysine) at the 145-position. Modification with the reagents 3-bromopropylamine·HBr and 2-mercaptoethylamine also allowed for partial restoration of activity showing that there is some flexibility in the length requirements of this essential residue. Modification with (2-bromoethyl)trimethylammonium·Br to form a positively charged, nontitratable side chain at the 145-position failed to restore activity to the inactive K145C leader peptidase mutant. This result, along with an inactive K145R mutant result, supports the claim that the lysine side chain at the 145-position is essential due to its ability to form a hydrogen bond(s) or to act as a general base rather than because of an ability to form a critical salt bridge. We find that leader peptidase processes the pre-protein substrate, pro-OmpA nuclease A, with maximum efficiency at pH 9.0, and apparent pKa values for titratable groups at approximately 8.7 and 9.3 are revealed. We show that the lysine modifier maleic anhydride inhibits leader peptidase by reacting with lysine 145. The results of this study are consistent with the hypothesis that the lysine at the 145-position of leader peptidase functions as the active site general base. A model of the active site region of leader peptidase is presented based on the structure of the E. coli UmuD′, and a mechanism for bacterial leader peptidase is proposed.

A model of the active site region of leader peptidase is presented based on the structure of the E. coli UmuD′, and a mechanism for bacterial leader peptidase is proposed. Escherichia coli leader (signal) peptidase is an integral membrane serine protease that functions to cleave off the amino-terminal leader (signal) sequence from proteins that are targeted to the cell surface of bacteria. Leader peptidase has been cloned (1Date T. Wickner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6106-6110Google Scholar), sequenced (2Wolfe P.B. Wickner W. Goodman J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12073-12080Google Scholar), overexpressed (3Dalbey R.E. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15925-15931Google Scholar, 4Wolfe P.B. Silver P. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7898-7902Google Scholar), and purified (4Wolfe P.B. Silver P. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7898-7902Google Scholar, 5Tschantz W.R. Dalbey R.E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 285-301Google Scholar). The use of protease inhibitors to classify leader peptidase into a specific protease class has failed (6Allsop A.E. Brooks G. Bruton G. Coulton S. Edwards P.D. Hatton I.K. Kaura A.C. McLean S.D. Person N.D. Smale T.C. Southgate R. Bioorg. & Med. Chem. Lett. 1995; 5: 443-448Google Scholar, 7Zwizinski C. Date T. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 256: 3593-3597Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis studies have demonstrated that there is an essential serine 90 (8Sung M. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13154-13159Google Scholar) and lysine 145 (9Black M.T. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4957-4961Google Scholar, 10Tschantz W.R. Sung M. Delgado-Partin V.M. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27349-27354Google Scholar) but no essential histidines or cysteines (8Sung M. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13154-13159Google Scholar). The most convincing evidence for serine 90 being the nucleophile in the proteolytic reaction was provided by the work of Tschantz et al. (10Tschantz W.R. Sung M. Delgado-Partin V.M. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27349-27354Google Scholar) which showed that when serine 90 is replaced with a cysteine, leader peptidase is still active and that this thiol leader peptidase could then be inhibited by reacting it with the cysteine-specific reagent N-ethylmaleimide (10Tschantz W.R. Sung M. Delgado-Partin V.M. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27349-27354Google Scholar). The essential serine and lysine are fully conserved within the type 1 prokaryotic and mitochondrial signal peptidases (11Dalbey R.E. von Heijne G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 474-478Google Scholar, 12van Dijl J.M. de Jong A. Vehmaanpera J. Venema G. Bron S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2819-2828Google Scholar). There are 19 lysines in the E. coli leader peptidase and only lysine 145 is conserved. Interestingly, the essential lysine is replaced by a histidine in the homologous yeast, chicken, and canine endoplasmic reticulum signal peptidase subunits (11Dalbey R.E. von Heijne G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 474-478Google Scholar, 12van Dijl J.M. de Jong A. Vehmaanpera J. Venema G. Bron S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2819-2828Google Scholar). All evidence to date points toward leader peptidase utilizing a serine/lysine dyad mechanism. With this mechanism, the lysine 145 would act as the general base to abstract the proton from the hydroxyl group of the serine 90 side chain, thereby allowing for the nucleophilic attack on the scissile peptide bond of the translocated pre-protein substrate. Leader peptidase along with LexA (13Roland K.L. Little J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12828-12835Google Scholar), UmuD (14Peat T.S. Frank E.G. McDonald J.P. Levine A.S. Woodgate R. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1996; 380: 727-730Google Scholar), and most recently, Tsp protease (15Keiler K.C. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28864-28868Google Scholar) represent the most thoroughly characterized members of the class (Clan) of serine proteases that contain an essential lysine but no essential histidine residue (16Rawlings N.D. Barretts A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 19-61Google Scholar). For lysine to act as a general base its side chain amine must be unprotonated. For this to be possible an enzyme must provide an environment for the lysine in which its pKa would be depressed. The microenvironment near the lysine would include either a local positive charge or a hydrophobic surrounding. There are many examples of lysine residues that have significantly lower pKa values as compared with the pKa of 10.5 for lysine in solution (17Dao-pin S. Anderson D.E. Baase W.A. Dahlquist F.W. Mathews B.W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11521-11529Google Scholar, 18Planas A. Kirsch J.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8268-8276Google Scholar). One of the most carefully studied active site lysines is that of acetoacetate decarboxylase, which has a pKa of 6.0 (19Highbarger L.A. Gerlt J.A. Kenyon G.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 41-46Google Scholar, 20Westheimer F.H. Tetrahedron. 1995; 51: 3-20Google Scholar). Moreover, there is crystallographic evidence that lysine is capable of serving as a general base for a serine residue in β-lactamase (21Strynadka N.C.J. Adachi H. Jensen S.E. Johns K. Siekecki A. Betzel C. Sutoh K. James M.N.G. Nature. 1992; 359: 700-705Google Scholar) and most recently in the structure of the E. coli UmuD′ protein (14Peat T.S. Frank E.G. McDonald J.P. Levine A.S. Woodgate R. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1996; 380: 727-730Google Scholar). These two enzymes have catalytic sites that are superimposable (14Peat T.S. Frank E.G. McDonald J.P. Levine A.S. Woodgate R. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1996; 380: 727-730Google Scholar). To further investigate the role played by the essential lysine 145 in the catalysis of leader peptidase, we have combined site-directed mutagenesis and chemical modification. To simplify the interpretation of the results, we have constructed and purified an active mutant in which all native cysteine residues have been replaced with serine residues. This cysteine-less variant of leader peptidase will be referred to as No Cys 1The abbreviations used are: No Cysthe cysteine-less variant of leader peptidase, all native cysteine residues were changed to serinePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisOmpAouter membrane protein A2BEA2-bromoethylamine·HBr3BPA3-bromopropylamine·HBr2MEA2-mercaptoethylamine2BETMA(2-bromoethyl)trimethylammonium·BrDTNB5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)CAPS3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acidTGC bufferTris/glycine/CAPS bufferMe2SOdimethyl sulfoxideK145CNo Cys, the leader peptidase mutant containing a unique cysteine at the 145-position; mutation nomenclature used, e.g. K145C, the native lysine at position 145 is changed to cysteine. leader peptidase. We then made the K145C mutant in the No Cys leader peptidase to produce a single cysteine within the enzyme for modification. This inactive mutant, which will from now on be referred to as K145C, No Cys, regains activity after being reacted with the reagent 2-bromoethylamine·HBr to form the lysine analog γ-thia-lysine at the 145-position. We have measured with the wild-type enzyme the pH-rate profile using the pre-protein substrate pro-OmpA nuclease A. We also show that leader peptidase is inhibited by the lysine-modifying reagent maleic anhydride, and we provide evidence that the inactivation is due to its modification at lysine 145. In addition, we have modeled the active site of E. coli leader peptidase based on the structure of E. coli UmuD′ (14Peat T.S. Frank E.G. McDonald J.P. Levine A.S. Woodgate R. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1996; 380: 727-730Google Scholar) and proposed a mechanism for leader peptidase.

The maleic anhydride was from Matheson Coleman & Bell. Oligonucleotides were synthesized at the Biochemical Instrument Center at The Ohio State University. The peptide substrate (NH3+-Phe-Ser-Ala-Ser-Ala-Leu-Ala-Lys-Ile-COO-) was purchased from the macromolecular Structure Analysis Facility at the University of Kentucky. The leader peptidase proteins were expressed in MC1061 E. coli cells harboring the pING plasmid carrying the mutant leader peptidase gene. Six consecutive histidine residues were engineered by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis into the P1 (cytoplasmic) domain of leader peptidase that allowed us to purify the mutants from the chromosome-expressed wild-type leader peptidase. Briefly, amino acid residues 35-40 were substituted with histidine residues. The sequence of the oligonucleotide used is as follows: 5′-TTC GCA CCT AAA CGG CGG CGC GAA CGT CAT CAT CAT CAT CAT CAT GCT CGG GAC TCA CTG GAT AAA GCA-3′. The No Cys variant of E. coli leader peptidase was produced by using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis to replace the three cysteines at positions 21, 170, and 176 with serine residues. The oligonucleotides used to make the cysteine to serine mutations are described in Sung and Dalbey (8Sung M. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13154-13159Google Scholar). The cloning of the pro-OmpA nuclease A gene into the isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside-inducible plasmid pONF1 (22Takahara M. Hibler D.W. Barr P.J. Gerlt J.A. Inouye M. J. Biol.

Biol. 1995; 245: 311-314Google Scholar). The DNA techniques were performed as described by Sambrook et al. (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). All cloning procedures used T4 kinase, T4 DNA ligase, Klenow, and restriction enzymes from Life Technologies, Inc. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed as described by Zoller and Smith (25Zoller M.J. Smith M. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 100: 468-500Google Scholar). Transformations followed the calcium chloride method of Cohen et al. (26Cohen S.N. Chang A.C.Y. Boyer H.W. Helling R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 3240-3244Google Scholar). The 6-His tag/nickel affinity chromatography method (27Smith M.C. Furman T.C. Ingolia T.D. Pidgeon C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7211-7215Google Scholar) was used to purify the overexpressed leader peptidase mutants away from the wild-type chromosome-expressed copies of leader peptidase. All leader peptidase proteins used in this study, except the wild-type, contained the 6-His tag. E. coli MC1061 cells containing the pING plasmid encoding the mutant leader peptidase protein were grown in M9 minimal media (1-8 liters) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin until an absorbance of 0.5 at 600 nm was reached. Expression was induced by the addition of arabinose to a final concentration of 0.3%, and the incubation of the cultures was continued for 4 h. The cells were pelleted and then resuspended in an equal weight of 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 10% sucrose. The cells were frozen by dropping them into liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until needed. 10 g of frozen cell nuggets were added to 25 ml of thaw buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 20% sucrose) and thawed. Lysozyme (6 mg) and DNase (60 μl at 10 mg/ml) were added to the thawed cells and then stirred for 10 min. The mixture was then freeze/thawed in a dry ice/ethanol bath. 200 μl of 1 M magnesium acetate was added, and the solution was allowed to stir for 15 min at room temperature. The solution was then centrifuged at 18,000 rpm (4°C, 30 min), and the pellet was resuspended in 25 ml of 10 mM triethanolamine, 10% glycerol, pH 7.5. The centrifugation step was then repeated once more. The pellet was resuspended by douncing in binding buffer (5 mM imidazole, 0.5 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mMβ-mercaptoethanol). The suspension was then centrifuged again at 18,000 rpm. The supernatant was loaded onto a 1-ml nickel column (Novagen resin) that was equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was then washed with 20 ml of binding buffer followed by a second wash with wash buffer (60 mM imidazole, 0.5 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mMβ-mercaptoethanol). The 6-His tagged leader peptidase was eluted by using an imidazole step gradient from 100 to 500 mM imidazole. Eluted fractions were assayed for protein by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining. Fractions containing 6-His leader peptidase were dialyzed against 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mMβ-mercaptoethanol and then stored at −80°C. The E. coli strain SB211 containing the plasmid pONF1 was used to overexpress the pro-OmpA nuclease A substrate, a hybrid of the signal peptide of the E. coli outer membrane protein A (OmpA) fused to staphylococcal nuclease A (22Takahara M. Hibler D.W. Barr P.J. Gerlt J.A. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2670-2674Google Scholar). The pro-OmpA nuclease A was expressed and purified as described by Chatterjee et al. (23Chatterjee S. Suciu D. Dalbey R. Kahn P.C. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 311-314Google Scholar). To determine the kinetic constants (Vmax, kcat, and Km) of the wild-type and mutant leader peptidase proteins, we used pro-OmpA nuclease A as a substrate. Substrate concentrations were determined by using an E1% at 280 nm of 8.3 (23Chatterjee S. Suciu D. Dalbey R. Kahn P.C. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 311-314Google Scholar). The cleavage reactions (75 μl) were run in TGC buffer (50 mM Tris, 50 mM glycine, 50 mM CAPS, 10 mM CaCl2, 1% Triton X-100) at pH 9.0, unless indicated otherwise, containing the substrate at five different concentrations (35.2, 17.6, 13.2, 8.8, 4.4 μM). The reaction was initiated by the addition of leader peptidase (wild-type or mutant) at a final concentration of 1.37 × 10−4μM, which was determined by the Pierce BCA protein assay kit. The reaction was carried out at 37°C, and aliquots of the reaction were removed at various times such that less than 7% processing of the substrate was achieved. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 μl of 5 × sample buffer containing 10 mM MgCl2, and the samples were frozen immediately in a dry ice/ethanol bath. The amount of pro-OmpA nuclease A that was processed by leader peptidase was assayed by SDS-PAGE on a 17.2% gel, followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The precursor and mature proteins were quantified by scanning the gels on a Technology Resources, Inc. Line Tamer PCLT 300 scanning densitometer. Percent processing was determined by dividing the area of the mature protein band by the sum of the mature and precursor band areas. The initial rates were determined by plotting the amount of product versus time. The Vmax, Km, and kcat values were calculated from a 1/vi versus 1/[S] plot (where vi represents initial velocity and [S] indicates substrate concentration). We used the computer program Microcal Origins to plot the data and for linear regression analysis of the data. All values are from at least two different experiments. The kinetic constants in the pH range 7 to 11 were measured using the substrate pro-OmpA nuclease A. The kinetic reactions were run as described above with the exception that the cleavage reactions were carried out in TGC buffer at the indicated pH values (7.0, 8.0, 8.5, 9.0, 9.5, 10.0, 11.0). Similar to the other kinetic assays, the amount of pro-OmpA nuclease A that was processed was quantified by SDS-PAGE and densitometry, and the kinetic parameters were extracted by using Lineweaver-Burk plots of the initial velocity values and substrate concentrations. The results plotted are the average of two separate experiments. Leader peptidase (0.7 μg/ml) was assayed for its pH stability by dilution into TGC buffer at various pH values and incubated for 15 min (4°C). 1 μl was then removed and added to 15 μl of pro-OmpA nuclease A (15 μM) in TGC buffer, pH 9.0, and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 5 μl of 5 × sample buffer and then frozen. The amount of processing was determined by separating the precursor and the mature form by 17.2% SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. The data were analyzed as described above using scanning densitometry. Results plotted are the average of two separate experiments. The reactions were carried out basically as described by Smith and Hartman (28Smith H.B. Hartman F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4921-4925Google Scholar). Briefly, leader peptidase at a concentration of 1-4 mg/ml in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 1% Triton X-100 was treated with a sufficient amount of freshly prepared 2 M 2BEA (18Planas A. Kirsch J.F.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12323-12332Google Scholar) such that the final concentration of reagent was 100 mM. All reagents were titrated to pH 8.5 before adding them to the enzyme. The reaction solution was then covered with nitrogen and incubated at room temperature overnight. The reaction mixture was then dialyzed against 2 volumes of 4.5 liters of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100 at 4°C. All buffers and solutions were purged with nitrogen. The extent of reaction was assayed by quantification of cysteine residues with DTNB before and after reaction with the reagents. The extent of the 2BEA reaction was also quantified directly by amino acid composition. A solution of 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB, 100 μl at 10 mM) in 0.1 M phosphate, pH 7.28, 1 mM EDTA was added to 275 μl of 4 mg/ml leader peptidase and 625 μl of 6.4 M guanidine HCl. This mixture was incubated for 15 min at room temperature, and then its absorbance was measured at 412 nm. A molar absorbance coefficient of 13,700 M−1 cm−1 was used to calculate the moles of cysteine present in the samples (37Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 94: 75-81Google Scholar). All solutions were made up fresh and purged with nitrogen. The concentration of the protein was determined using the Pierce BCA method. The K145C, No Cys leader peptidase was stored in reducing conditions. Before the DTNB reaction, or other modifications, the β-mercaptoethanol was dialyzed away in nitrogen-purged buffer (2 volumes of 4.5 liters of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100) at 4°C. To directly quantify the extent of aminoethylation of the cysteine 145, we measured the appearance of a γ-thia-lysine residue within the leader peptidase protein by using (S)-2-aminoethyl-L-cysteine·HCl (Sigma) as a standard in the amino acid compositional analysis. The amino acid analysis was performed at the W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Research Laboratory in New Haven, CT, and the Biochemical Instrument Center at The Ohio State University. In the time-dependent studies, maleic anhydride dissolved in Me2SO was added to leader peptidase (0.07 mg/ml, in 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 2.5% Triton X-100) to a final concentration of 0.5 mM, and samples were removed at 0, 10, 30, and 60 min (38Habeeb A. Atassi M. Biochemistry. 1970; 25: 4939-4944Google Scholar). In the concentration-dependent studies, leader peptidase (0.07 mg/ml, in 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 2.5% Triton X-100) was incubated at room temperature with maleic anhydride at a final concentration of 0.10, 0.25, 0.30, 0.50 mM for 60 min. After the modification, the reaction mixture was added to 12.5 μl of peptide substrate (1.5 mg/ml; NH3+-Phe-Ser-Ala-Ser-Ala-Leu-Ala-Lys-Ile-COO-) (39Dev I.K. Ray P.H. Novak P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20069-20072Google Scholar) and incubated for 3 h at 37°C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of an equal volume of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and microcentrifuged for 5 min at room temperature to pellet any particulate matter. Samples were then analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. The elution gradient utilized to separate the cleaved from the uncleaved peptide was as follows: 97% A, 3% B held constant for 5 min, followed by a linear gradient to 60% A, 40% B over a 10-min period. This mixture was then held constant for 5 min and then brought back down to 97% A, 3% B over a 5-min period. The solvents used were A = 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and B = 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile. Peptide products were detected spectrophotometrically at 218 nm. The column used was a 25-cm Vydac C18 column. Percent processing of the peptide was determined by quantification of the 7-mer product peptide peak and the 9-mer substrate peak: % processing = (area 7-mer peak/(area 7-mer peak + area 9-mer peak)) × 100. A total of 0.007 μmol of the No Cys or the K145C, No Cys mutant leader peptidase was first reacted with 0.7 μmol of DTNB and then dialyzed against 50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 8.5 (buffer A). The mutants were then reacted with 2.3 μmol of maleic anhydride, incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and then dialyzed against buffer A. The cysteine in the K145C, No Cys mutant was then deprotected by reaction with β-mercaptoethanol followed by dialysis. These samples (60 μl) were then reacted overnight at room temperature with 10 μl of freshly prepared 2 M 2-bromoethylamine·HBr. This product was then reacted with maleic anhydride again. All reagents were made up fresh in nitrogen-purged buffer. After each reaction the samples were dialyzed extensively (overnight against 9 liters of nitrogen purged buffer A). The activity of the leader peptidase enzymes was assayed before and after each chemical modification step. We have aligned the amino acid sequence of the catalytic region from the solved structure of UmuD′ (residues 40-139, the total length of the UmuD protein is 218 residues) with the corresponding proposed catalytic region of leader peptidase (residues 75-202, the total length of leader peptidase is 323 amino acid residues). The alignment protocol XALIGN (40Wishart D.S. Boyko R.F. Willard L. Richards F.M. Sykes B.D. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 121-132Google Scholar, 41Wishart D.S. Boyko R.F. Sykes B.D. Comput. Appl.

Biosci. 1994; 10: 687-688Google Scholar). The pairwise alignment module implemented in the comparison of UmuD′ and leader peptidase is based on the Needleman-Wunsch dynamic programming algorithm (42Needleman S.B. Wunsch C.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 48: 443-453Google Scholar), and the sequence/structure alignment algorithms are based loosely on the protocols described by Lesk et al. (43Lesk A.M. Levitt M. Chothia C. Protein Eng. 1986; 1: 77-78Google Scholar). Residue anchoring and residue clustering features are analogous to the gap and extension penalties incorporated into regular dynamic programming schemes (40Wishart D.S. Boyko R.F. Willard L. Richards F.M. Sykes B.D. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 121-132Google Scholar). The appropriate substitutions of the UmuD′ residues as well as manual manipulations were done using the program TOM-frodo (44Jones T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 115: 157-171Google Scholar). The coordinates for the crystal structure of UmuD′ were kindly provided by T. Peat and W. Hendrickson (14Peat T.S. Frank E.G. McDonald J.P. Levine A.S. Woodgate R. Hendrickson W.A.

The rendering of the modeled active site region and hydrophobic cleft adjacent to the active site of E. coli leader peptidase was created using the program Raster3D (45Merrit E.A. Murphy M.E.P.

INTRODUCTIONParasitic nematodes cause medical and economic damage on a global scale, in part the result of the longevity and environmental robustness of their dispersal stages, their eggs. Arguably the most successful and widely distributed nematode parasite of humans is Ascaris lumbricoides, which infects over 1 billion people. A morphologically indistinguishable species, Ascaris suum, occurs in pigs and has become the best understood nematode in biochemical terms. The eggs contaminate soil, and the embryos develop to infective, second-stage larvae (L2s) 1The abbreviations used are: L2second-stage (infective) larvaALBPadipocyte lipid-binding proteinAP-1adapter primer 1AP-2adapter primer 2BSAbovine serum albuminCAPS3-(cyclohexylamino)-1-propanesulfonic acidDACAdansyl-DL-α-aminocaprylic aciddansyldimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonylDAUDA11-(((5-(dimethylamino)-1-naphthalenyl)sulfonyl)amino)undecanoic acidDTTdithiothreitolFABPfatty acid-binding proteiniLBPintracellular lipid-binding proteinL1first-stage larvaL3third-stage larvaLBPlipid-binding proteinMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acidNTAnitrilotriacetic acidPBSphosphate buffered salinePCRpolymerase chain reactionrABA-1recombinant ABA-1rAs-p18recombinant As-p18RACErapid amplification of cDNA endsSL1nematode spliced leader RNAV-hvolt-hour(s). within the eggs. The L2 undergoes developmental arrest until ingestion by the host, and may survive for up to 7 years, but little is known of the biochemical basis for such long term survival. The problems faced by the L2 include maintaining both the egg's impermeability to water and dissolved ions (they can survive in dilute formalin and sulfuric acid) and its permeability to oxygen, as well as the potential accumulation of toxic products of lipid peroxidation. The ascarid L2 develops in the perivitelline fluid enclosed within the highly resistant, chitinous eggshell (1Fairbairn D. Exp. Parasitol. 1957; 6: 491-554Google Scholar). The innermost lipid layer of the eggshell accounts for the extreme impermeability and resistance and is composed of three unusual, structurally related glycosides, the ascarosides (1Fairbairn D. Exp. Parasitol. 1957; 6: 491-554Google Scholar, 2Tarr G.E. Fairbairn D. Lipids. 1973; 8: 7-16Google Scholar, 3Wharton D. Parasitology. 1980; 81: 447-463Google Scholar). Perturbation of this ascaroside layer appears to be involved in the initiation of the hatching process upon infection of a new host (4Fairbairn D. Can. J. Zool. 1961; 39: 153-162Google Scholar, 5Barrett J. Parasitology. 1976; 73: 109-121Google Scholar, 6Clarke A.J. Perry R.N. Parasitology. 1980; 80: 447-456Google Scholar). The organism, therefore, has particular need of a mechanism to transport and store hydrophobic compounds between the larva and the eggshell.The present study was initiated to identify major proteins in the perivitelline fluid of A. suum infective larvae, specifically those potentially involved with the maintenance of the highly resistant lipid layer. Toward this end, we have identified a novel fatty acid-binding protein (FABP), designated As-p18, in the perivitelline fluid surrounding the infective L2. Based on sequence and structure analysis, and its fatty acid binding function, As-p18 is an unusual member of lipid-binding protein (LBP) family in having a hydrophobic leader sequence, being under strong developmental regulation, and in terms of its predicted structure.DISCUSSIONWe have demonstrated that the perivitelline fluid surrounding the developing larva of the parasitic nematode, A. suum, has a relatively simple polypeptide composition and have identified from it a novel, abundant fatty acid-binding protein, As-p18. The predicted amino acid sequence of As-p18 exhibits significant similarity to iLBPs isolated from a variety of different organisms, ranging from flatworms to mammals.All LBPs appear to have similar conformations with 8 or 10 anti-parallel β-strands and two short α-helices, even though some members of the group exhibit as little as 20% sequence identity (37Banaszak L. Winter N. Xu Z. Bernlohr D.A. Cowan S. Jones T.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 89-151Google Scholar, 38Jones T.A. Bergfors T. Sedzik J. Unge T. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1597-1604Google Scholar, 48Sacchettini J.C. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18399-18402Google Scholar, 50Müller-Fahrrnow A. Egner U. Jones T.A. Rudel H. Spener F. Saenger W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 271-276Google Scholar). However, conserved positions have been identified. As-p18 exhibits a number of significant differences in these conserved regions and, with the exception of presumptive LBP-encoding sequences recently identified through the C. elegans genome project, is the only member of this group with a putative secretory signal. Of the 39 conserved polar and nonpolar positions in most iLBPs, 8 are not conserved in As-p18. For example, two invariant residues that correspond to Ser-55 and Phe-57 of the human ALBP are at a proposed portal region for ligand entry (37Banaszak L. Winter N. Xu Z. Bernlohr D.A. Cowan S. Jones T.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 89-151Google Scholar) and are not conserved in As-p18 (Glu-79 and Leu-81).Sequence differences aside, however, As-p18 is clearly a functional fatty acid-binding protein. It has a high affinity for oleic acid, and there is strong evidence that it is structurally very similar to iLBPs, based on the preponderance of β-sheet as indicated by the CD analysis and computer-based predictions of its secondary structure. However, while the modeling study does show that the sequence conforms well to a 10-stranded iLBP, there are indications of modifications to the binding site which could relate to ligand specificity. In addition, the unusual extra loops exposed on the surface of the protein might be involved in unsuspected protein-protein interactions.Another unusual feature of As-p18 is the tight developmental control of its expression, which is not common among LBPs, although a few cases have been reported (51Heuckeroth R.O. Birkenmeier E.H. Levin M.S. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9709-9717Google Scholar, 52Haunerland N.H. Chen X. Andolfatto P. Chisholm J.M. Wang Z. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 123: 153-158Google Scholar). As-p18 is not present in unembryonated eggs, but begins to be synthesized at about day 3 and is abundant in the perivitelline fluid by the time the L1 is formed on day 10. The reasons for the apparent lack of As-p18 protein in these stages is unclear, but the data suggest that the maternal As-p18 mRNA in the unembryonated egg (53Cleavinger P.J. McDowell J.W. Bennett K.J. Dev. Biol. 1989; 133: 600-604Google Scholar) may not be translated. For the L3, however, an alternative explanation may be that As-p18 is synthesized and immediately secreted, so it does not accumulate within the larva. As-p18 appears to be present in the perivitelline fluid prior to development of any of the secretory structures possessed by later stages of A. suum, and no As-p18 immunoreactivity has been detected in the duct leading to the secretory pore in infective L2. 2Y. Xia, N. Heaney, A. Cooper, and M. W. Kennedy, manuscript in preparation. As-p18 must therefore arise in the perivitelline fluid by an unexpected route, and studies are under way to characterize the cells responsible for As-p18 synthesis and secretion into the perivitelline fluid before the development of a functional secretory system. In view of the similarity between As-p18 and the putative LBPs from C. elegans, it would seem valuable to investigate the developmental control, function and site of their synthesis in this organism. It is conceivable that one or both homologues are important to the survival of the embryo within the eggshell.Although the function of As-p18 is unclear, a number of interesting possibilities are apparent. The early development of A. suum from unembryonated egg to infective L2 takes place entirely within a highly resistant eggshell, and the quiescent L2 can remain viable for several years while it awaits ingestion by an appropriate host (54Roberts L.S. Janovy J.J. Foundations of Parasitology. William C. Brown Publishers, Dubuque, IA1996: 419-432Google Scholar). Carbohydrate is utilized during the first 5 days of development and then resynthesized from stored triglycerides by the glyoxylate cycle (55Barrett J. Ward C.W. Fairbairn D. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1970; 35: 577-586Google Scholar). Stored triglycerides are the only energy source for quiescent L2s, and the appearance of As-p18 in the perivitelline fluid parallels the increasing utilization of triglycerides as development proceeds (55Barrett J. Ward C.W. Fairbairn D. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1970; 35: 577-586Google Scholar, 56Barrett J. Biochemistry of Parasitic Helminths. University Park, Baltimore, MD1981: 107-108Google Scholar). As-p18 may therefore play a role by sequestering potentially toxic fatty acids and their peroxidation products accumulating around a larva enclosed within an impermeable eggshell. The resistance of the eggshell is thought to be due to a highly impermeable lipid layer comprised of unusual glycosides (ascarosides) secreted by the fertilized egg prior to the expression of As-p18 (3Wharton D. Parasitology. 1980; 81: 447-463Google Scholar). We are currently testing the binding capacity of As-p18 for ascarosides and potential products of lipid peroxidation. As-p18 also may play a role in the altered permeability of the lipid layer that accompanies the onset of hatching. This altered permeability permits the diffusion of trehalose out of the perivitelline fluid, and this change in osmotic pressure is presumed to activate the quiescent larva whose subsequent movement may further mechanically disrupt the lipid layer (1Fairbairn D. Exp. Parasitol. 1957; 6: 491-554Google Scholar, 5Barrett J. Parasitology. 1976; 73: 109-121Google Scholar).FABPs have been isolated from a number of flatworms, including S. mansoni, E. granulosus, and F. hepatica and have received attention as being potentially important in helminth parasitism. Indeed, the flatworm FABPs appear to be important antigens released during the course of infection with these helminths and have been identified as promising vaccine candidates (31Rodríguez-Pérez J. Rodríguez-Medina J.R. García-Blanco M.A. Hillyer G. Exp. Parasitol. 1992; 74: 400-407Google Scholar, 33Moser D. Tendler M. Griffiths G. Klinkert M.-Q. J. Biol.

In addition, an ethanolamine-binding protein recently has been identified as a major antigen released during the larval migration of the related dog ascarid, Toxocara canis (58Gems D. Ferguson C.J. Robertson B.D. Nieves R. Page A.P. Blaxter M.L. Maizels R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18517-18522Google Scholar). Finally, the ABA-1 allergen produced by A. suum also displays strong fatty acid binding activity, even though it is quite different in structure from the LBPs (43Kennedy M.W. Brass A. McCruden A.B. Price N.C. Kelly S.M. Cooper A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6700-6710Google Scholar, 59Tomlinson L.A. Christie J.F. Fraser E.M. McLaughlin D. McIntosh A.E. Kennedy M.W. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 2349-2356Google Scholar).As-p18 is, therefore, a member of the β-barrel lipid-binding proteins, which is unusual in the possession of a leader peptide in its precursor, and its lack of retinol binding. It is also the first member of this family from nematodes to be characterized as an FABP, and makes it probable that the proteins identified by similarity from C. elegans indeed represent functional FABPs. It clearly possesses some unique features, which may reflect adaptation to a specific function within the egg. INTRODUCTIONParasitic nematodes cause medical and economic damage on a global scale, in part the result of the longevity and environmental robustness of their dispersal stages, their eggs. Arguably the most successful and widely distributed nematode parasite of humans is Ascaris lumbricoides, which infects over 1 billion people. A morphologically indistinguishable species, Ascaris suum, occurs in pigs and has become the best understood nematode in biochemical terms. The eggs contaminate soil, and the embryos develop to infective, second-stage larvae (L2s) 1The abbreviations used are: L2second-stage (infective) larvaALBPadipocyte lipid-binding proteinAP-1adapter primer 1AP-2adapter primer 2BSAbovine serum albuminCAPS3-(cyclohexylamino)-1-propanesulfonic acidDACAdansyl-DL-α-aminocaprylic aciddansyldimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonylDAUDA11-(((5-(dimethylamino)-1-naphthalenyl)sulfonyl)amino)undecanoic acidDTTdithiothreitolFABPfatty acid-binding proteiniLBPintracellular lipid-binding proteinL1first-stage larvaL3third-stage larvaLBPlipid-binding proteinMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acidNTAnitrilotriacetic acidPBSphosphate buffered salinePCRpolymerase chain reactionrABA-1recombinant ABA-1rAs-p18recombinant As-p18RACErapid amplification of cDNA endsSL1nematode spliced leader RNAV-hvolt-hour(s). within the eggs. The L2 undergoes developmental arrest until ingestion by the host, and may survive for up to 7 years, but little is known of the biochemical basis for such long term survival. The problems faced by the L2 include maintaining both the egg's impermeability to water and dissolved ions (they can survive in dilute formalin and sulfuric acid) and its permeability to oxygen, as well as the potential accumulation of toxic products of lipid peroxidation. The ascarid L2 develops in the perivitelline fluid enclosed within the highly resistant, chitinous eggshell (1Fairbairn D. Exp. Parasitol. 1957; 6: 491-554Google Scholar). The innermost lipid layer of the eggshell accounts for the extreme impermeability and resistance and is composed of three unusual, structurally related glycosides, the ascarosides (1Fairbairn D. Exp. Parasitol. 1957; 6: 491-554Google Scholar, 2Tarr G.E. Fairbairn D. Lipids. 1973; 8: 7-16Google Scholar, 3Wharton D. Parasitology. 1980; 81: 447-463Google Scholar). Perturbation of this ascaroside layer appears to be involved in the initiation of the hatching process upon infection of a new host (4Fairbairn D. Can. J. Zool. 1961; 39: 153-162Google Scholar, 5Barrett J. Parasitology. 1976; 73: 109-121Google Scholar, 6Clarke A.J. Perry R.N. Parasitology. 1980; 80: 447-456Google Scholar). The organism, therefore, has particular need of a mechanism to transport and store hydrophobic compounds between the larva and the eggshell.The present study was initiated to identify major proteins in the perivitelline fluid of A. suum infective larvae, specifically those potentially involved with the maintenance of the highly resistant lipid layer. Toward this end, we have identified a novel fatty acid-binding protein (FABP), designated As-p18, in the perivitelline fluid surrounding the infective L2. Based on sequence and structure analysis, and its fatty acid binding function, As-p18 is an unusual member of lipid-binding protein (LBP) family in having a hydrophobic leader sequence, being under strong developmental regulation, and in terms of its predicted structure."

The first activation signal is provided by the stimulation through the T cell receptor, which induces the synthesis of cyclins and the expression of the high affinity interleukin-2 receptor. The second signal, required to enter the S phase, is generated upon binding of interleukin-2 to the high affinity αβγ interleukin-2 receptor. However, resting T cells already express intermediate affinity βγ interleukin-2 receptors. As shown here, T cell stimulation through intermediate affinity receptors is capable of inducing cell rescue from the apoptosis suffered in the absence of stimulation. Characterization of the signaling pathways utilized by βγ interleukin-2 receptors in resting T cells, indicated that pp56lck, but not Jak1 or Jak3, is activated upon receptor triggering. Compelling evidence is presented indicating that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase associates with the intermediate affinity interleukin-2 receptor and is activated upon interleukin-2 addition. Bcl-xL gene was also found to be induced upon βγ interleukin-2 receptor stimulation. Finally, pharmacological inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase blocked both interleukin-2-mediated bcl-xL induction and cell survival.

INTRODUCTIONInterleukin-2 (IL-2) 1The abbreviations used are: IL-2interleukin-2IL-2Rinterleukin-2 receptorTCRT cell receptorPI3Kphosphatidylinositol 3-kinaseAbsantibodiesPBLperipheral blood lymphocytesPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. plays a major role in T cell biology, as activated T cells depend on this cytokine for their proliferation and effector functions. IL-2 effects are mediated through interaction with a specific transmembrane receptor (IL-2R) composed of three different molecules, α, β, and γ (1Taniguchi T. Minami Y. Cell. 1993; 73: 5-8Google Scholar). The β and γ chains are constitutively expressed in T lymphocytes and bind IL-2 with intermediate affinity. The α chain, in contrast, is only expressed upon T cell activation and, together with the β and γ chains, forms the high affinity IL-2 receptor (1Taniguchi T. Minami Y. Cell. 1993; 73: 5-8Google Scholar). It has been shown that heterodimerization of the IL-2R β and γ chains is required for IL-2-induced cellular proliferation (2Nakamura Y. Russell S.M. Mess S.A. Friedmann M. Erdos M. Francois C. Jacques Y. Adelstein S. Leonard W.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 330-333Google Scholar, 3Nelson B.H. Lord J.D. Greenberg P.D. Nature. 1994; 369: 333-336Google Scholar). The IL-2R has no intrinsic enzymatic activity; therefore, its ability to transmit intracellular signals relies on its association with signaling molecules. IL-2R ligation triggers the activation of several tyrosine kinases, including src-kinases (4Hatakeyama M. Kono T. Kobayashi N. Kawahara A. Levin S.D. Perlmutter R.M. Taniguchi T. Science. 1991; 252: 1523-1528Google Scholar, 5Kobayashi N. Kono T. Hatakeyama M. Minami Y. Miyazaki T. Perlmutter R.M. Taniguchi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4201-4205Google Scholar), Jak kinases (6Johnston J.A. Kawamura M. Kirken R.A. Chen Y. Blake T.B. Shibuya K. Ortaldo J.R. McVicar D.W. O'Shea J.J.

Sada K. Yamamura H. Taniguchi T. Immunity. 1995; 2: 89-100Google Scholar). While Jak kinases are essential for IL-2-induced proliferation, the involvement of src-kinases on T cell proliferation following IL-2R binding is not so clear (4Hatakeyama M. Kono T. Kobayashi N. Kawahara A. Levin S.D. Perlmutter R.M. Taniguchi T. Science. 1991; 252: 1523-1528Google Scholar). IL-2 also regulates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activation (10Augustine J.A. Sutor S.L. Abraham R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4431-4440Google Scholar, 11Merida I. Diez E. Gaulton G.N. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2202-2207Google Scholar, 12Remillard B. Petrillo R. Maslinski W. Tsudo M.

Bierer B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7571-7575Google Scholar). After the initial phase mediated by these set of cytoplasmic molecules, several transcription factors including Stat3, Stat5, c-myc, c-fos, and c-jun (16Johnston J.A. Bacon C.M. Finbloom D.S. Rees R.C. Kaplan D. Shibuya K. Ortaldo J.R. Gupta S. Chen Y.G. Giri J.D. O'Shea J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8705-8709Google Scholar, 17Shibuya H. Yoneyama M. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1992; 70: 57-67Google Scholar) are also induced that putatively control gene expression leading to cell division. All these signaling cascades have been described to be triggered by high affinity IL-2 receptors and are involved in inducing cell proliferation. However, it has been recently shown that the intermediate affinity IL-2 receptor mediates protection against radiation-induced cell death (18Boise L.H. Minn A.J. June C.H. Lindsten T. Thompson C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5491-5495Google Scholar, 19Seki H. Iwai K. Kanegane H. Konno A. Ohta K. Ohta K. Yachie A. Taniguchi N. Miyawaki T. Cell. Immunol. 1995; 163: 30-36Google Scholar). We confirm here that although unable to promote cell division, the intermediate affinity IL-2R induced cell survival. In fact, IL-2 treatment rescued resting T cells from the spontaneous cell death observed when these cells are cultured without stimulus. We subsequently analyzed the signaling pathways triggered by intermediate affinity IL-2R in resting T cells and found that pp56lck is induced upon βγ IL-2R stimulation. In addition, data is presented indicating that the activation of PI3K is required for IL-2-mediated cell survival and that bcl-xL behaves as a downstream effector of this enzyme.DISCUSSIONThe results presented in this report indicate that IL-2 binding to the intermediate affinity IL-2R promotes rescue from apoptosis of resting T cells cultured in vitro in the absence of TCR stimulation. Analysis of the signaling molecules implicated in βγ IL-2R-mediated survival, addressed here for the first time, indicates that pp56lck, but not Jak kinases, is induced upon βγ receptor ligation. We have previously described that pp56lck is required for activation of TCR-associated PI3K (30Carrera A.C. Rodriguez-Borlado L.R Martinez-A C. Merida I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19435-19440Google Scholar) and regulates αβγ IL-2R-induced PI3K activation (29Taichman R. Merida I. Torigoe T. Gaulton G.N. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20031-20036Google Scholar). Thus, we have also analyzed whether PI3K was stimulated in this system. We found that PI3K is constitutively associated to βγ IL-2R and became activated in response to IL-2 binding. The fact that pharmacological inhibition of PI3K blocked IL-2-mediated survival strongly suggests that PI3K activation is required for the ability of IL-2 to abrogate cell death. Finally, we also show here that bcl-xL is induced upon βγ IL-2R stimulation (Fig. 8) and that this induction is blocked upon PI3K inhibition (Fig. 8). Together these results allow the proposal of the model depicted in Fig. 9: ligation of intermediate affinity βγ IL-2R induces both pp56lck and PI3K activation. PI3K activity is then required for the induction of bcl-xL, an important mediator of cell survival.To the best of our knowledge, no previous publication has characterized the effect of βγ IL-2R ligation on the death of normal T cells in the absence of TCR stimulation. However, at least three previous reports have analyzed the IL-2 involvement in T cell rescue from γ radiation-induced cell death (18Boise L.H. Minn A.J. June C.H. Lindsten T. Thompson C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5491-5495Google Scholar, 19Seki H. Iwai K. Kanegane H. Konno A. Ohta K. Ohta K. Yachie A. Taniguchi N. Miyawaki T. Cell. Immunol. 1995; 163: 30-36Google Scholar, 47Mor F. Cohen I.R. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 515-522Google Scholar). Boise et al. (18Boise L.H. Minn A.J. June C.H. Lindsten T. Thompson C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5491-5495Google Scholar) describe that preincubation of normal human peripheral T cells with IL-2, IL-4, or IL-7, but not with IL-1, IL-3, or IL-6, decreases the apoptosis observed in response to γ radiation. Mor and Cohen (47Mor F. Cohen I.R. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 515-522Google Scholar), have reported that IL-2 mediates protection to γ radiation in antigen-specific T cells; however, they do not detect protection in resting T cells. Finally, Seki et al. (19Seki H. Iwai K. Kanegane H. Konno A. Ohta K. Ohta K. Yachie A. Taniguchi N. Miyawaki T. Cell. Immunol. 1995; 163: 30-36Google Scholar) show that CD8+ and NK cells are the most radiosensitive of resting T cells but could be rescued by IL-2 treatment. These observations, together with the description here that IL-2 protects from the cell death suffered by normal T cells when cultured in the absence of TCR stimulation (Fig. 1), support the conclusion that intermediate affinity IL-2R is capable of inducing T cell survival. In addition to this mechanism, others are likely to mediate survival of resting T cells, given that a significant proportion of the resting cells survive in the absence of IL-2 (Fig. 1A).We have performed a systematic study of βγ IL-2R-induced signaling pathways. As proposed in the model in Fig. 9, these data suggest that pp56lck is one of the signals involved in IL-2R-mediated survival in resting T cells. This is in agreement with the observation that constitutive active pp56lck mutants decrease the apoptosis induced by growth factor removal (42Miyazaki T. Liu Z.J. Kawahara A. Minami Y. Yamada K. Tsujimoto Y. Barsoumian E.L. Perlmutter R.M. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1995; 81: 223-231Google Scholar). In contrast, the involvement of pp56lck on IL-2-induced cell division is controversial, since a mutant of the β chain lacking the acidic region (which does not associate pp56lck) is, however, capable of mediating a proliferative signal (4Hatakeyama M. Kono T. Kobayashi N. Kawahara A. Levin S.D. Perlmutter R.M. Taniguchi T. Science. 1991; 252: 1523-1528Google Scholar). The other tyrosine kinases involved in high affinity IL-2R signaling are the Jak kinases (6Johnston J.A. Kawamura M. Kirken R.A. Chen Y. Blake T.B. Shibuya K. Ortaldo J.R. McVicar D.W. O'Shea J.J. Nature. 1994; 370: 151-153Google Scholar, 7Witthuhn B.A. Silvennoinen O. Miura O. Lai K.S. Cwik C. Liu E.T. Ihle J.N. Nature. 1994; 370: 153-157Google Scholar, 8Miyazaki T. Kawahara A. Fujii H. Nawaka Y. Minami Y. Liu Z-J. Oishi I. Silvennoinen O. Witthuhn B.A. Ihle J.N. Taniguchi T. Science. 1994; 266: 1045-1047Google Scholar), which have been shown to be required for IL-2-mediated proliferation (27Nelson B.H. Lord J.D. Greenberg P.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 309-317Google Scholar, 28Kawahara A. Minami Y. Miyazaki T. Ihle J.N. Taniguchi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8724-8728Google Scholar). The mechanism by which these enzymes are activated entails their phosphorylation on tyrosine residues. The current model proposes that Jak1 and Jak3 transphosphorylate each other (27Nelson B.H. Lord J.D. Greenberg P.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 309-317Google Scholar). The low levels of Jak3 expression, and the concomitant lack of Jak1 and Jak3 activation in our system suggest that these proteins do not participate in IL-2-mediated survival. In addition to IL-2-mediated survival, bcl-2 induction by IL-2 in BAF/3 also seems to be independent of Jak3 as bcl-2 up-regulation is not altered by overexpression of a dominant negative Jak3 in these cells (28Kawahara A. Minami Y. Miyazaki T. Ihle J.N. Taniguchi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8724-8728Google Scholar).Our conclusion on PI3K activation involvement in T cell rescue from apoptosis (Fig. 6C) concurs with the implication of PI3K in survival discussed by Ward et al. (45Ward S.G. June C.H. Olive D. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 187-197Google Scholar) for CD28-mediated signals. Moreover, studies in rodent fibroblast (38Yao R. Cooper G.M. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 343-351Google Scholar), in neural growth factor receptor signaling in PC12 cells (29Taichman R. Merida I. Torigoe T. Gaulton G.N. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20031-20036Google Scholar), and insulin growth factor receptor signaling in myeloid progenitors cells (32Minshall C. Arkins S. Freund G.G. Kelley K.W. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 939-947Google Scholar), in which activation of PI3K prevents apoptosis, also support this view. The mechanism through which PI3K is activated is not evident. In this regard, several cytokine receptors, such as IL-4R and IL-7R that share the γ chain with the IL-2R (48Russell S.M. Keegan A.D. Harada N. Nakamura Y. Noguchi M. Leland P. Friedmann M.C. Miyajima A. Puri R.K. Paul W.E. Leonard W.J. Science. 1993; 262: 1880-1883Google Scholar, 49Noguchi M. Nakamura Y. Russell S.M. Ziegler S.F. Tsang M. Cao X. Leonard W.J. Science. 1993; 262: 1877-1880Google Scholar) have been shown to enhance the resistance of resting T cells to radiation-induced cell death as effectively as IL-2 (18Boise L.H. Minn A.J. June C.H. Lindsten T. Thompson C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5491-5495Google Scholar, 19Seki H. Iwai K. Kanegane H. Konno A. Ohta K. Ohta K. Yachie A. Taniguchi N. Miyawaki T. Cell. Immunol. 1995; 163: 30-36Google Scholar). Studies with the IL-7 receptor show that PI3K activation is mediated by the γ chain and its associated Jak3 tyrosine kinase (50Sharfe N. Dadi H.K. Roifman C.M. Blood. 1995; 86: 2077-2085Google Scholar). However, the low levels of Jak3 expression in our system and the fact that this protein is not up-regulated upon IL-2 treatment makes unlikely the implication of this mechanism in PI3K activation. Another possible mechanism for PI3K activation involves the IL-2R β chain and src-kinases (29Taichman R. Merida I. Torigoe T. Gaulton G.N. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20031-20036Google Scholar, 51Karnitz L.M. Sutor S.L. Abraham R.T. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1799-1808Google Scholar). We previously described that pp56lck activation regulates PI3K activation upon IL-2 triggering of high affinity IL-2R (29Taichman R. Merida I. Torigoe T. Gaulton G.N. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20031-20036Google Scholar). In addition, the serine-rich region required for pp56lck activation is also required for activation of PI3K (52Merida I. Williamson P. Kuziel W.A. Greene W.C. Gaulton G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6765-6770Google Scholar). Finally, the fact that pp56lck tyrosine kinase and correlatively PI3K are activated upon IL-2 binding to βγ IL-2R (Fig. 3A) suggests that pp56lck may contribute to induce PI3K activation.Bcl-2 and bcl-xL have been shown to mediate survival (44Boise L.H. Gottschalk A.R. Quintans J. Thompson C.B. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 200: 107-121Google Scholar) and to be induced upon high affinity IL-2R ligation (41Deng G. Podack E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2189-2193Google Scholar, 42Miyazaki T. Liu Z.J. Kawahara A. Minami Y. Yamada K. Tsujimoto Y. Barsoumian E.L. Perlmutter R.M. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1995; 81: 223-231Google Scholar, 43Broome H.E. Dargan C.M. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2311-2317Google Scholar, 47Mor F. Cohen I.R. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 515-522Google Scholar). We therefore tested the putative involvement of bcl-2 and bcl-xL in IL-2-mediated survival. Induction of bcl-xL/bcl-2 in irradiated cells upon βγ IL-2R ligation has not been previously detected (19Seki H. Iwai K. Kanegane H. Konno A. Ohta K. Ohta K. Yachie A. Taniguchi N. Miyawaki T. Cell. Immunol. 1995; 163: 30-36Google Scholar). We found a slight increase in bcl-2 expression that could suggest a partial role of this protein for IL-2-mediated survival. More clearly, the induction of bcl-xL upon βγ IL-2R stimulation and the fact that blocking IL-2-induced survival with LY294002 also results in abrogation of bcl-xL up-regulation suggest that PI3K activation precedes bcl-xL expression and that bcl-xL is probably involved in βγ IL-2R-induced survival.IL-2 mediates three different cellular responses. First, it has been involved in mediating the proliferation of cells preactivated via T cell receptor and expressing αβγ IL-2R (53Rebollo A. Gomez J. Martinez-A C. Adv. Immunol. 1996; 63: 127-176Google Scholar). Second, it has been suggested to mediate survival (Fig. 1) (18Boise L.H. Minn A.J. June C.H. Lindsten T. Thompson C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5491-5495Google Scholar, 19Seki H. Iwai K. Kanegane H. Konno A. Ohta K. Ohta K. Yachie A. Taniguchi N. Miyawaki T. Cell. Immunol. 1995; 163: 30-36Google Scholar), and finally, it has been recently proposed to program T lymphocytes for apoptosis (54Lenardo M.J. Nature. 1991; 353: 858-861Google Scholar). Regarding the dual role of IL-2 at promoting either survival or cell proliferation, we describe here that only a set of signals (pp56lck, PI3K, and bcl-xL) of those triggered for IL-2-induced cell division are involved in mediating cell survival. The reason for high affinity IL-2R to trigger different early signals than that derived from intermediate affinity IL-2R in resting T cells could be the presence in the high affinity IL-2R of the α chain. However, chimeric β and γ IL-2R chains transfected in cell lines lacking the α chain behave as high affinity IL-2R, inducing proliferation (2Nakamura Y. Russell S.M. Mess S.A. Friedmann M. Erdos M. Francois C. Jacques Y. Adelstein S. Leonard W.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 330-333Google Scholar, 3Nelson B.H. Lord J.D. Greenberg P.D. Nature. 1994; 369: 333-336Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems that the lack of IL-2R α chain expression is not responsible for the partial signaling of βγ IL-2R in resting T cells. Instead, other proteins not expressed in resting T cells but expressed in cell lines or induced upon TCR cross-linking in normal T cells could be responsible for the different biological responses following TCR ligation. Candidates for these molecules could be c-myc, Jak3, or c-raf, relatively abundant in activated T cell and cell lines but not detectable in resting T cells (our data not shown) (14Zmuidzinas A. Mamom H.J. Roberts T.M. Smith K.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2794-2803Google Scholar, 26Kawamura M. McVicar D.W. Johnston J.A. Blake T.B. Chen Y-Q. Lal B.K. Lloyd A.R Kelvin D.J. Staples J.E. Ortaldo J.R. O'Shea J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6374-6378Google Scholar).Regarding the ability of IL-2 to program T lymphocytes for apoptosis, it has been described that incubation of T cells in IL-2 or IL-4 is required for ulterior TCR-mediated cell death (54Lenardo M.J. Nature. 1991; 353: 858-861Google Scholar). Moreover, IL-2−/− mice developed splenomegaly and lymphoadenophaty (55Sadlack B. Merz H. Schorle H. Schimpl A. Feller A C. Horak I. Cell. 1993; 75: 253-261Google Scholar), similar to IL-2Rβ−/− mice (56Suzuki H. Kunding T.M. Furlonger C. Wakeham A. Timms E. Matsuyama T. Schmits R. Simard J.J.L. Ohashi P.S. Griesser H. Taniguchi T. Paige C.J. Mak T.W. Science. 1995; 268: 1472-1476Google Scholar). We sought to investigate the signaling pathways responsible for the ability of IL-2 to induce susceptibility to TCR-triggered apoptosis. However, in our hands, the conditions that induce susceptibility to apoptosis also trigger cell division. Thus, we favor the hypothesis that the same intracellular signaling program induces both cellular responses.The fact that intermediate affinity IL-2 receptors transmit intracellular signals in resting cells, opens the possibility of a biological role for the βγ IL-2R. The circulating levels of IL-2 are normally low. However, encounter with antigen primes T cells for IL-2 production, locally increasing the concentration of this cytokine. Cells that have not been stimulated by the antigen, and therefore do not express the IL-2R α chain, could use IL-2 to increase their survival potential. INTRODUCTIONInterleukin-2 (IL-2) 1The abbreviations used are: IL-2interleukin-2IL-2Rinterleukin-2 receptorTCRT cell receptorPI3Kphosphatidylinositol 3-kinaseAbsantibodiesPBLperipheral blood lymphocytesPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. plays a major role in T cell biology, as activated T cells depend on this cytokine for their proliferation and effector functions. IL-2 effects are mediated through interaction with a specific transmembrane receptor (IL-2R) composed of three different molecules, α, β, and γ (1Taniguchi T. Minami Y. Cell. 1993; 73: 5-8Google Scholar). The β and γ chains are constitutively expressed in T lymphocytes and bind IL-2 with intermediate affinity. The α chain, in contrast, is only expressed upon T cell activation and, together with the β and γ chains, forms the high affinity IL-2 receptor (1Taniguchi T. Minami Y. Cell. 1993; 73: 5-8Google Scholar). It has been shown that heterodimerization of the IL-2R β and γ chains is required for IL-2-induced cellular proliferation (2Nakamura Y. Russell S.M. Mess S.A. Friedmann M. Erdos M. Francois C. Jacques Y. Adelstein S. Leonard W.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 330-333Google Scholar, 3Nelson B.H. Lord J.D. Greenberg P.D. Nature. 1994; 369: 333-336Google Scholar). The IL-2R has no intrinsic enzymatic activity; therefore, its ability to transmit intracellular signals relies on its association with signaling molecules. IL-2R ligation triggers the activation of several tyrosine kinases, including src-kinases (4Hatakeyama M. Kono T. Kobayashi N. Kawahara A. Levin S.D. Perlmutter R.M. Taniguchi T.

Sada K. Yamamura H. Taniguchi T. Immunity. 1995; 2: 89-100Google Scholar). While Jak kinases are essential for IL-2-induced proliferation, the involvement of src-kinases on T cell proliferation following IL-2R binding is not so clear (4Hatakeyama M. Kono T. Kobayashi N. Kawahara A. Levin S.D. Perlmutter R.M. Taniguchi T. Science. 1991; 252: 1523-1528Google Scholar). IL-2 also regulates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activation (10Augustine J.A. Sutor S.L.

Chem. 1992; 267: 25423-25427Google Scholar), c-raf (14Zmuidzinas A. Mamom H.J. Roberts T.M. Smith K.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2794-2803Google Scholar), and pp70S6K (15Calvo V. Crews C.M. Vik T.A. Bierer B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7571-7575Google Scholar). After the initial phase mediated by these set of cytoplasmic molecules, several transcription factors including Stat3, Stat5, c-myc, c-fos, and c-jun (16Johnston J.A. Bacon C.M. Finbloom D.S. Rees R.C. Kaplan D. Shibuya K. Ortaldo J.R. Gupta S. Chen Y.G. Giri J.D. O'Shea J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8705-8709Google Scholar, 17Shibuya H. Yoneyama M. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1992; 70: 57-67Google Scholar) are also induced that putatively control gene expression leading to cell division. All these signaling cascades have been described to be triggered by high affinity IL-2 receptors and are involved in inducing cell proliferation. However, it has been recently shown that the intermediate affinity IL-2 receptor mediates protection against radiation-induced cell death (18Boise L.H. Minn A.J. June C.H. Lindsten T. Thompson C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5491-5495Google Scholar, 19Seki H. Iwai K. Kanegane H. Konno A. Ohta K. Ohta K. Yachie A. Taniguchi N. Miyawaki T. Cell. Immunol. 1995; 163: 30-36Google Scholar). We confirm here that although unable to promote cell division, the intermediate affinity IL-2R induced cell survival. In fact, IL-2 treatment rescued resting T cells from the spontaneous cell death observed when these cells are cultured without stimulus. We subsequently analyzed the signaling pathways triggered by intermediate affinity IL-2R in resting T cells and found that pp56lck is induced upon βγ IL-2R stimulation. In addition, data is presented indicating that the activation of PI3K is required for IL-2-mediated cell survival and that bcl-xL behaves as a downstream effector of this enzyme.

https://openalex.org/W2060858495,"To assess the role of G16, a trimeric G protein exclusively expressed in hematopoietic cells, Gα16 antisense RNA was stably expressed in human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells. Western blot analysis showed that in transfected cell lines, the expression of endogenous Gα16 protein was suppressed, but the expression of Gαq/11, Gαi2, and Gαi3 remained unaffected. Suppression of Gα16 in transfected HEL cells did not interfere with transient elevations of intracellular free Ca2+ concentrations induced by prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), platelet-activating factor, or thrombin. In parental HEL cells, UTP and ATP mobilized Ca2+ from intracellular stores with half-maximum effective concentrations of 3.6 ± 0.7 and 4.7 ± 1.6 μM, respectively, apparently by stimulating P2U purinoceptors. By contrast, Ca2+ mobilization by UTP or ATP was completely abrogated in Gα16-suppressed cells, indicating specific coupling of G16 to P2U purinoceptors. Pertussis toxin inhibited the effect of UTP in parental HEL cells by 57.6 ± 4.9%. These data indicate that signaling by the P2U purinoceptor obligatorily requires G16 but may be modulated further by activation of Gi. Priming of HEL cells with UTP or ATP prior to stimulation with PGE1 markedly enhanced the PGE1-induced intracellular Ca2+ release. This indirect, potentiating effect of UTP and ATP was not impaired in Gα16-suppressed cells but was inhibited by pertussis toxin, indicating that functional P2U purinoceptors are present on these cells and that the potentiating effect primarily depends on Gi. The data demonstrate (i) that Gα16 antisense RNA selectively inhibits endogenous Gα16 protein expression in HEL cells; (ii) that stimulation of endogenous P2U (P2Y2) purinoceptors leads to the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ by a mechanism that strictly depends on Gα16; and (iii) that P2U purinoceptors in HEL cells can communicate with two distinct signaling pathways diverging at the G protein level.

G proteins, a group of heterotrimeric membrane-associated proteins, composed of a GTP-binding α-subunit and a βγ-heterodimer, transduce the signals of hormones and neurotransmitters that bind to a large family of receptors with seven transmembrane domains. Effector systems for G protein-coupled receptors include adenylyl cyclases, phosphoinositide-specific phospholipases C (PLC), 1The abbreviations used are: PLCphosphoinositide-specific phospholipase CPTXpertussis toxinInsP3inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphateHELhuman erythroleukemiaDOTAPN-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methyl sulfatePGE1prostaglandin E1PGE2prostaglandin E2PAFplatelet-activating factor[Ca2+]iintracellular Ca2+ concentrationEC50half-maximum effective concentration[Ca2+]oextracellular Ca2+ concentration. or ion channels. Based on amino acid sequence homology and sensitivity to bacterial toxins, the GTP-binding α-subunits of G proteins are grouped into four subfamilies, Gs, Gi, Gq, and G12/13 (1Simon M.I. Strathmann M.P. Gautam N. Science. 1991; 252: 802-808Google Scholar, 2Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 383-387Google Scholar). Two subfamilies (Gs and Gi) activate or inhibit adenylyl cyclases, respectively, and are sensitive to ADP-ribosylation catalyzed by either cholera toxin or pertussis toxin (PTX). Although many G protein subtypes do not show any tissue specificities, the α-subunit of G16, a member of the Gq subfamily, is expressed exclusively in hematopoietic cells (3Amatruda III, T.T. Steele D.A. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5587-5591Google Scholar). Members of this subfamily, which lack an ADP-ribosylation site, activate PLCs and thus mobilize Ca2+ from inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3)-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ stores. phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C pertussis toxin inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate human erythroleukemia N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methyl sulfate prostaglandin E1 prostaglandin E2 platelet-activating factor intracellular Ca2+ concentration half-maximum effective concentration extracellular Ca2+ concentration. In some cases, the expression pattern of G proteins is subject to changes during cellular differentiation (4Watkins D.C. Northup J.K. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10651-10657Google Scholar, 5Watkins D.C. Rapiejko P.R. Ros M. Wang H.J. Malbon C.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 929-934Google Scholar, 6Kesselring F. Spicher K.

Lacasa D. Goldsmith P.K. De Mazancourt P. Giudicelli Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 443-448Google Scholar). In the hematopoietic cell line HL-60, Gα16 is down-regulated during terminal differentiation (3Amatruda III, T.T. Steele D.A. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5587-5591Google Scholar). Analysis of Gα16 expression in patients with acute lymphoid leukemia suggests that Gα16 is expressed in progenitor B cell-derived malignant cells but not in leukemic cells that are derived from more mature differentiation stages (7Mapara M.Y. Bommert K. Bargou R.C. Leng C. Beck C. Ludwig W.D. Gierschik P. Dörken B. Blood. 1995; 85: 1836-1842Google Scholar). Interestingly, Gα16 displays growth inhibitory effects when overexpressed as a constitutively active (GTPase-deficient) form in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts or in small cell lung carcinoma cells (9Qian N.-X. Russell M. Buhl A.M. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17417-17423Google Scholar, 10Heasley L.E. Zamarripa J. Storey B. Helfrich B. Mitchell F.M. Bunn Jr., P.A. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 349-354Google Scholar). Thus it appears that Gα16 expression is regulated during cellular differentiation and that its expression levels may be critical for controlling proliferation rates in slowly cycling stem and progenitor cells. The signaling pathways that engage G16 in hematopoietic cells are still poorly defined. Recent studies suggest that G16 can interact indiscriminately with a multitude of G protein-coupled receptors when receptors and Gα16 were overexpressed in COS-7 cells (11Offermanns S. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15175-15180Google Scholar, 12Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2827-2831Google Scholar). On the other hand, some receptors for chemotactic factors such as C5a, formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, or interleukin-8 appear to interact with G16 but not with Gq or G11, to stimulate the production of InsP3 (13Amatruda III, T.T. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10139-10144Google Scholar, 14Wu D. LaRosa G.J. Simon M.I. Science. 1993; 261: 101-103Google Scholar, 15Amatruda III, T.T. Dragas-Graonic S.

Thus, some receptors may utilize G16, preferentially, to mobilize intracellular Ca2+. However, these studies could not address the question of which receptors may couple specifically to G16 in native cells. Overexpression of wild type α-subunits in transfected cells potentially shifts the balance between signal transduction through βγ- and α-subunits because of a redistribution of βγ-subunits bound to the overexpressed versus the endogenous G proteins. In transient transfection assays, competition between α-subunits for common βγ-dimers was indeed demonstrated (17Slepak V. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4037-4041Google Scholar). Moreover, altering the stoichiometric relationships between G protein and effector systems may result in spillover effects in transfected cells which do not occur in wild type cells. Other studies employed cells overexpressing GTPase-deficient mutants as tools to define the role of individual Gq subfamily members (9Qian N.-X. Russell M. Buhl A.M. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17417-17423Google Scholar, 10Heasley L.E. Zamarripa J. Storey B. Helfrich B. Mitchell F.M. Bunn Jr., P.A. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 349-354Google Scholar, 18De Vivo M. Iyengar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19671-19674Google Scholar). However, uncertainties remain in the interpretation of results from such studies because these mutants act independently of βγ-heterodimers. As a more gentle alternative, an antisense-based approach with oligodeoxynucleotides or expression of antisense RNA to reduce the expression of specific α-subunits has proven to be a powerful tool in defining the roles of specific G protein isoforms of various subfamilies (19Gudermann T. Kalkbrenner F. Schultz G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 429-459Google Scholar). In the present study, we sought to identify signaling pathways that obligatorily require G16 in a hematopoietic cell line, human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells. Full-length antisense RNA expression was used to suppress selectively the endogenous biosynthesis of Gα16. In Gα16-suppressed cells, a specific deficit of the P2U (P2Y2) 2The nomenclature for P2 purinoceptor subtypes is according to Watson and Girdlestone (20Watson S. Girdlestone D.

All other reagents were from Fluka Chemie or from Merck Darmstadt. The cDNA for human Gα16 including 5′- and 3′-flanking regions (224 and 60 base pairs, respectively) (3Amatruda III, T.T. Steele D.A.

HEL cells (2.5 × 107 cells at a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml) were transfected in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 50 μg of the plasmid pG16AS, using DOTAP as the transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sixteen h later, the medium was replaced with RPMI medium plus supplements, and the cells were seeded at a density of 106/ml. Twenty-four h later the cells received fresh medium that included 400 μg/ml medium of active G418 sulfate. The following day, the cells (8.6 × 107) were transferred into 96-well dishes (105 cells/well) to select independent G418 sulfate-resistant clones. Fourteen days after transfection, 47 of 864 wells contained viable, G418 sulfate-resistant clones, which were picked and expanded. Six clonal cell lines out of 21 that showed sustained growth were selected randomly and characterized further. HEL cells were loaded with fura-2/AM (9 μM) as described previously (6Kesselring F. Spicher K. Porzig H. Blood. 1994; 84: 4088-4098Google Scholar). The loaded cells were washed, and a stock suspension was prepared which contained 5 × 106 cells/ml medium A (phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM KCl, 22 mM glucose, and 5% fetal bovine serum). The Ca2+ concentration of medium A was around 90 μM as measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Prior to use, cells from the stock suspension were diluted to a density of 2.5 × 105/ml into medium A and preincubated for 5 min at 25°C. Agonist-induced changes in [Ca2+]i were measured in a thermostatted (25°C) cuvette in a Perkin Elmer LS-50B dual wavelength fluorescence spectrophotometer, which was equipped with the fast-fura measuring device (Perkin-Elmer). Emission intensities (at 485 nm) at excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm were recorded. At the end of each experiment, maximum and minimum fluorescence ratios were determined by adding Ca2+ (1 mM) plus digitonin (12.5 μM) followed by Tris-buffered EGTA (20 mM, pH 8.5), respectively, to the incubation medium. Intensity ratios were converted to intracellular Ca2+ concentrations using the FL data manager software (version 3.5) and were based on an apparent Kd of 224 nM for the fura-2·Ca2+ complex (23Hansen C.A. Monck J.R. Williamson J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 191: 691-706Google Scholar). Cells were harvested and washed once in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then disrupted by three freeze/thaw cycles (liquid nitrogen) in buffer 1 (137 mM NaCl, 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Membranes were collected by centrifugation (14,000 × g for 2 min), and membrane-bound proteins were solubilized with Triton X-100 lysis buffer (137 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mM MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (14,000 × g for 2 min). Solubilized membrane proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% acrylamide) and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose filters (Bio-Rad). The α-subunits of G16, Gi3, Gi2, and Gq/11 were detected by immunostaining with affinity-purified antibodies (AS 339, AS 86, AS 269, and AS 368, respectively) that were raised in rabbits against sequence-specific peptides (24Spicher K. Kalkbrenner F. Zobel A. Harhammer R. Nürnberg B. Söling A. Schultz G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 906-914Google Scholar). G protein β-subunits in cellular extracts and in a preparation of purified Gβγ from porcine brain (a gift from Dr. B. Nürnberg and Dr. G. Schultz) were detected with an antibody (AS 11) that was raised against a peptide corresponding to a conserved sequence within Gβ1, Gβ2, and Gβ4 (25Hinsch K.D. Tychowiecka I. Gausepohl H. Frank R. Rosenthal W. Schultz G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1013: 60-67Google Scholar). Bound antibodies were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.), using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) as the secondary antibody. In some instances, nitrocellulose filters were incubated twice for 90 min each with stripping buffer (100 mM glycine, pH 2.2, 20 mM magnesium acetate, 50 mM KCl) to remove antibodies. Filters were then blocked again and used for reprobing with a different antibody. Statistical significance was calculated by unpaired t tests using StatView for the Macintosh, version 4.0 (Abacus Concepts, Inc.). Half-maximum effective concentrations (EC50) were calculated by fitting the Hill equation to the data with the Levenberg-Marquardt fit algorithm of Kaleidagraph, version 3.0 (Abelbeck Software). Individual G418 sulfate-resistant HEL cell lines that were isolated following transfection with a plasmid expressing Gα16 antisense RNA (pG16AS) were analyzed by protein immunoblot to assess the extent of suppression of endogenous Gα16 expression. In three G418 sulfate-resistant cell lines (1E3, 3D4, and 1G3), Gα16 expression was greatly diminished compared with parental HEL cells (Fig. 1A). In a fourth cell line (7H6) and two others (data not shown), Gα16 levels were not decreased, although these cell lines were resistant to the antibiotic. Thus, the cell line 7H6 was used further as a nonsuppressed control along with parental HEL cells. The specificity of the antibody (AS 339) for Gα16 was assessed using wild type K-562 cells, which do not express detectable levels of Gα16 (3Amatruda III, T.T. Steele D.A. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5587-5591Google Scholar), and two K-562-derived cell lines (K-562-D5 and K-562-A4) that were stably transfected with a plasmid containing the full-length clone of Gα16 under the transcriptional control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. A protein immunoblot with cell extracts from K562-D5 and −A4, but not from parental cells, showed a unique major immunoreactive band demonstrating that the antibody (AS 339) is highly specific for Gα16 (Fig. 1A). The electrophoretic mobility of overexpressed Gα16 was identical to that of the major immunoreactive protein detected in HEL cells. To assess the specificity of Gα16 down-regulation in the transfected cell lines, the expression levels of other G protein α-subunits were also examined in transfected and parental cells. A major band was detected with the antibody raised against a common peptide of Gαq and Gα11, two phylogenetically close congeners of Gα16, which comigrate on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The two α-subunits (collectively termed Gαq/11) were expressed at comparable levels in Gα16-suppressed and nonsuppressed cells as demonstrated in Fig. 1B Gαi3 and Gαi2 expression also remained unchanged. Since the expression level of G protein α-subunits and Gβγ may be coordinately regulated (26Hermouet S. Murakami T. Spiegel A.M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 183-188Google Scholar), Gα16-suppressed and nonsuppressed HEL cells were analyzed for the level of β-subunit protein, with an antibody (AS 11) that recognizes Gβ1, Gβ2, and Gβ4 (25Hinsch K.D. Tychowiecka I. Gausepohl H. Frank R. Rosenthal W. Schultz G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1013: 60-67Google Scholar). However, no differences in Gβ protein expression were observed (Fig. 1C). In conclusion, the data indicate that Gα16 antisense RNA expression inhibits the expression of endogenous Gα16 in HEL cells, but the expression of other G protein subunits is not affected. Experimental data from transiently transfected COS cells showed that heterologously expressed Gα16 could mediate the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+, after stimulation of diverse G protein-coupled receptors that were cotransfected into these cells (11Offermanns S. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15175-15180Google Scholar, 12Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2827-2831Google Scholar, 13Amatruda III, T.T. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10139-10144Google Scholar, 27Wu D. Kuang Y. Wu Y. Jiang H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16008-16010Google Scholar). Being a member of the Gq subfamily of G protein α-subunits, a role of Gα16 in mediating Ca2+ mobilization is expected. However, it is unclear whether Gα16 is indeed required in hematopoietic cells to promote Ca2+ mobilization. Gα16-suppressed HEL cell lines thus provided a possibility of identifying signaling pathways that depend strictly on the presence of Gα16. A variety of ligands are known to induce a transient increase in [Ca2+]i in HEL cells in a G protein-dependent fashion (28Schwaner I. Seifert R. Schultz G. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 301-307Google Scholar). Fig. 2A summarizes the peak increments of [Ca2+]i over resting levels after adding different agonists at maximum effective concentrations. In Gα16-suppressed and nonsuppressed cell lines, PGE1 and thrombin gave rise to similar peak increases in [Ca2+]i, indicating that Gα16 suppression did not inhibit signaling pathways utilized by these two ligands. Changes in [Ca2+]i upon stimulation with PAF appeared to be more heterogeneous between the individual cell lines, but down-regulation of Gα16 certainly did not impair PAF-dependent signaling. Agonist-stimulated changes in [Ca2+]i are transduced by pathways with different sensitivity to PTX treatment, depending on the extent of coupling of receptors to Gq type or Gi type G proteins. The downstream effectors, isoforms of PLC, are either activated by GTP-bound Gα released from Gq or by Gβγ released from Gi, whereby the different isoforms of the enzyme show varying sensitivities toward the G protein subunits (29Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Nature. 1993; 365: 403-406Google Scholar). The sensitivity to PTX can help to identify the subclass of G proteins and, consequently, the possible subtypes of PLC-β which may be involved in intracellular Ca2+ mobilization. Schwaner et al. (28Schwaner I. Seifert R. Schultz G. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 301-307Google Scholar) reported that in HEL cells, the transient increase of [Ca2+]i induced by thrombin is rather insensitive to PTX, whereas the effects of PGE1 and PGE2 are partially or completely inhibited by the toxin, respectively. In our experiments in parental HEL and Gα16-suppressed 3D4 cells, PTX inhibited thrombin-induced changes in [Ca2+]i by 23 and 14%, respectively (Fig. 2B). These data indicate that the thrombin receptor couples primarily, although not exclusively, to a PTX-insensitive G protein, probably of the Gq type. Under the same conditions, the toxin inhibited the effect of PGE1 in HEL and 3D4 cells by 93 and 86%, respectively, suggesting a major role of Gi type G proteins in PGE1-induced Ca2+ signaling. To exclude that PTX treatment simply reduced the filling state of intracellular Ca2+ stores, PTX-treated cells and nontreated controls were incubated with thapsigargin, a potent and specific inhibitor of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump which blocks reuptake of cytosolic Ca2+ into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (30Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drøbak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Google Scholar). Parental and Gα16-suppressed cells responded with similar transient, thapsigargin-induced increments in [Ca2+]i, whether or not they were treated with PTX (Fig. 2B). PGE2, which acts via Gi-coupled receptors (28Schwaner I. Seifert R. Schultz G. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 301-307Google Scholar), was completely ineffective after PTX treatment, demonstrating that PTX treatment was exhaustive (not shown). The similar relative inhibitions of agonist-induced Ca2+ changes that were observed after PTX treatment in parental and Gα16-suppressed cells make it unlikely that the expression pattern of Gα- and Gβγ-sensitive PLC-β isoforms differed considerably between Gα16-suppressed cells and parental HEL cells. In HEL cells, the concentration of intracellular Ca2+ also increased transiently when cells were incubated with UTP (100 μM) and reached a maximum between 40 and 60 s after adding the agonist (Fig. 3A, inset). The mean peak increase in [Ca2+]i in parental HEL cells amounted to 78.8 ± 4.8 nM (mean ± S.E.) (Fig. 3A). In contrast, UTP failed to increase [Ca2+]i in any of the three Gα16-suppressed cell lines (1E3, 3D4, 1G3). Mean changes in [Ca2+]i were 3.4 ± 0.7 nM for 1G3 cells and even smaller in the other two cell lines. Similarly, ATP was no longer able to increase [Ca2+]i in Gα16-suppressed cell lines (data not shown). These observations indicate a critical role of Gα16 in UTP- and ATP-induced Ca2+ changes. To substantiate further the requirement of Gα16 expression for UTP-dependent Ca2+ signaling, [Ca2+]i was also measured in the G418 sulfate-resistant control cell line 7H6, which expressed wild type levels of Gα16. In this cell line, UTP-induced Ca2+ changes (74.3 ± 2.2 nM) were not significantly different from those evoked by the agonist in parental HEL cells (Fig. 3A). These data strongly suggest that inhibition of Gα16 expression in transfected HEL cells is accompanied by a severe defect in UTP-dependent Ca2+ signaling. If UTP-dependent Ca2+ signaling in HEL cells requires Gα16, then no effect of PTX on UTP-induced Ca2+ changes would be expected. However, PTX inhibited the UTP-induced increase in [Ca2+]i by 57.6 ± 4.9% (n = 6) compared with nontreated HEL cells (Fig. 3B). Inhibition by the toxin was exhaustive because the effect of UK14304, a selective agonist for the Gi-coupled α2-adrenoreceptor, was inhibited completely under these conditions. Thus, a Gi type G protein may also be involved in the propagation of UTP-dependent Ca2+ signaling. However, the role of Gi seems to be modulatory rather than obligatory because its action absolutely depends on the costimulation of Gα16. The UTP-dependent increase in [Ca2+]i was mainly due to the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ as demonstrated in Fig. 4, A-C In the presence as well as in the absence of free extracellular Ca2+, incubation of HEL cells with UTP led to an increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 4A, left and right panel, respectively). This indicates that the UTP-dependent increase in [Ca2+]i is mainly due to the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. A slightly larger increase in [Ca2+]i was observed when Ca2+ was present in the extracellular medium compared with Ca2+-free conditions (mean Ca2+ changes of 55.5 ± 0.6 nM versus 48.8 ± 2.0 nM (n = 4), respectively). The small, but statistically significant difference (p0 < 0.02) was consistently observed and may be due to the contribution of a capacitative Ca2+ influx that follows the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ in HEL cells (31Feoktistov I. Murray J.J. Biaggioni I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 1160-1167Google Scholar). Additional experiments with thapsigargin confirmed these results. Incubation of HEL cells with thapsigargin prior to stimulation with UTP rendered the cells unresponsive to UTP (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, incubation of HEL cells and Gα16-suppressed cell lines (3D4 and 1E3) with thapsigargin led to similar transient increases in [Ca2+]i, thus reflecting similar filling states of intracellular Ca2+ stores (Fig. 4C). UTP may activate at least three different receptor subtypes of the P2 purinoceptor class, which are stimulated by UTP, ATP, and ADP with different potencies (20Watson S. Girdlestone D.

Chem. 1995; 270: 26152-26158Google Scholar). At the uridine nucleotide (P2Y4) receptor, UTP is a full agonist, whereas ATP and ADP are only partial agonists (35Communi D. Pirotton S. Parmentier M.

In hepatoma cells, after a 1-min pulse with radiolabeled amino acids, labeled apoB28 migrated during gel electrophoresis in the folded position and was resistant to reduction in vivo with 2 mM DTT. A similar rate and extent of folding was observed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, a microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP)-negative cell line that can neither lipidate nor efficiently secrete apoB28. Amino-terminal folding of apoB28 was essential for its subsequent intracellular lipidation as apoB28 synthesized in hepatoma cells under reducing conditions remained lipid poor (d > 1.25 g/ml) and was retained intracellularly.

As with the cotranslational assembly pathway, post-translational lipidation of apoB28 displayed a strict dependence upon amino-terminal folding.

These results predict the existence of multiple 4.1 protein isoforms with diverse COOH termini.

The COOH-terminal domain of the enzyme (residues 420-902) is about 48% identical to a family of NAD-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenases (EC 1.2.1.3), and FDH possesses aldehyde dehydrogenase activity. We expressed the COOH-terminal domain (residues 420-902) of FDH in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system. The recombinant protein was released from insect cells to the culture medium and was purified from the medium by a two-step procedure: precipitation with 35% saturated ammonium sulfate followed by chromatography on hydroxyapatite. The purified COOH-terminal domain displayed aldehyde dehydrogenase activity similar to that of native FDH but had neither dehydrogenase nor hydrolase activity toward folate substrates. Aldehyde dehydrogenase activity of the COOH-terminal domain and FDH was independent of the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol while 10-FDDF dehydrogenase activity of FDH occurred only in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol. The COOH-terminal domain existed as a tetramer showing that the sites for oligomerization of subunits in native FDH resides in this domain. Using titration of tryptophan fluorescence, it was found that the COOH-terminal domain bound NADP+ to the same extent as FDH (Kd 0.2 and 0.3 μM, respectively) but did not bind folate. Both FDH and its COOH-terminal domain also bound NAD+ (Kd 11 and 16 μM, respectively) as measured by fluorescence titration. Both proteins were able to catalyze the aldehyde dehydrogenase reaction utilizing NADP+ or NAD+, but the Km for NAD+ was three orders higher than that for NADP+ (2 mM and 1.5-2.0 μM, respectively).

Biochem. J. 1979; 177: 833-846Google Scholar). The functional form of the enzyme is a tetramer consisting of identical 99 kDa subunits (2Rios-Orlandi E.M. Zarkadas C.G. MacKenzie R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 87: 24-35Google Scholar, 3Scrutton M.C. Beis I. Biochem. J. 1979; 177: 833-846Google Scholar, 4Schirch D. Villar E. Maras B. Barra D. Schirch V. J. Biol.

The physiological role of the enzyme is not clear, but it probably serves to recycle 10-formyltetrahydrofolate not required for purine synthesis back to tetrahydrofolate where it is available for other one-carbon reactions (6Wagner C. Bailey L. Folate in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1994: 23-41Google Scholar). Although it was reported that dehydrogenase and hydrolase activities were products of separate cytosolic and mitochondrial forms of this enzyme (7Case G.L. Kaisaki P.J. Steele R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10204-10207Google Scholar), we have subsequently shown that both activities are associated with the product of a single gene (8Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 651-655Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of FDH contains 902 residues and can be divided into three domains (9Cook R.J. Lloyd R.S. Wagner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4965-4973Google Scholar). The amino-terminal sequence of the enzyme (residues 1-203) is 24-30% identical to a group of glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylases (EC 2.1.2.2) from different species. The intermediate domain (residues 204-416) does not show extensive homology to any known protein sequence. The carboxyl-terminal sequence (residues 420-902) has about 48% identity with a series of NAD+-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenases (EC 1.2.1.3) (9Cook R.J. Lloyd R.S. Wagner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4965-4973Google Scholar, 10Hempel J. Nicholas H. Lindahl R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1890-1900Google Scholar), and the enzyme is able to oxidize aldehydes (9Cook R.J. Lloyd R.S. Wagner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4965-4973Google Scholar, 11Cook R.J. Wagner C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 321: 336-344Google Scholar). At present, all aldehyde dehydrogenases classify into four groups (12Lindahl R. Weiner H. Crabb D.W. Flynn T.G. Enzymology and Molecular Biology of Carbonyl Metabolism 4. Plenum Press, New York1993: 1-4Google Scholar). FDH has a higher identity with class I (cytoplasmic aldehyde dehydrogenases) and class II (mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenases) enzymes (13Weiner H. Flynn T.G. (eds) Enzymology and Molecular Biology of Carbonyl Metabolism 2. pp. xix-xxi, Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1989Google Scholar). An error in reading the original cDNA sequence (9Cook R.J. Lloyd R.S. Wagner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4965-4973Google Scholar) was recently noted which changes a 23-amino acid sequence from residue 566 to 588. The changes have been made in the data base files. This region is one of the highly conserved domains in the aldehyde dehydrogenase family (10Hempel J. Nicholas H. Lindahl R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1890-1900Google Scholar), which is also conserved in FDH (Fig. 1). Recently (5Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 519-522Google Scholar), we have shown that cysteine 707 of rat FDH, which is homologous to a strictly conserved cysteine of NAD-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenases is directly involved in the dehydrogenase active site, apparently serving as the catalytic nucleophile. 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 10-formyl-5,8-dideazafolate 5,8-dideazafolate 10-formyltetrahydrofolate tetrahydrofolate 2-mercaptoethanol 3-(cyclohexylamino)-1-propanesulfonic acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Existence of three putative domains in the sequence of FDH, two of which have identity with different classes of enzymes suggests that the enzyme activities derive from the two functional domains. The third, intermediate, domain located between the NH2- and COOH-terminal domains was predicted to connect the functional domains together (4Schirch D. Villar E. Maras B. Barra D. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24728-24735Google Scholar, 9Cook R.J. Lloyd R.S. Wagner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4965-4973Google Scholar) and does not participate directly in the mechanism of enzyme action. Recently Schirch et al. (4Schirch D. Villar E. Maras B. Barra D. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24728-24735Google Scholar) using limited proteolytic digestion of rabbit liver FDH have shown that the aldehyde dehydrogenase activity resides in a 53-kDa COOH-terminal domain (4Schirch D. Villar E. Maras B. Barra D. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24728-24735Google Scholar). Neither this domain nor a bigger COOH-terminal proteolytic fragment (63 kDa) had 10-FTHF dehydrogenase activity (4Schirch D. Villar E. Maras B. Barra D. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24728-24735Google Scholar). A comparison between the molecular mass of the proteolytic COOH-terminal fragments obtained in the study of Schirch et al. (4Schirch D. Villar E. Maras B. Barra D. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24728-24735Google Scholar) and the amino acid composition of these fragments suggests that the fragments were truncated from the carboxyl-terminal end. In the present study, we expressed the entire COOH-terminal domain of FDH to investigate its properties and to learn whether it is able to fold into a functional protein. 10-formyl-5,8-dideazafolate (10-FDDF) was obtained from Dr. John B. Hynes, Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Medical University of South Carolina. (6-R,S)-10-FTHF was prepared by the method of Rabinowitz (14Rabinowitz J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1963; 6: 814-816Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Oligo 1000 DNA Synthesizer (Beckman). Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England BioLabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA) or from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Grace's insect cell medium was obtained from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA). Fetal bovine serum was purchased from Intergen (Purchase, NY). SDS-PAGE standards were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. (Piscataway, NJ). Kaleidoscope prestained standards and nitrocellulose membranes were purchased from Bio-Rad. Other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. To create the construct for the COOH-terminal domain expression, a second XbaI restriction site was introduced in the FDH expression vector (15Krupenko S.A. Horstman D.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 457-464Google Scholar) immediately upstream of methionine 420, and the coding sequence between the two XbaI sites (amino acid residues 1-419) was excised. This was accomplished with the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) based on the method of Deng and Nickoloff (16Deng W.P. Nicoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Google Scholar). The mutagenic oligonucleotide 5′-AAGCTGACTCTGCCCTA CCA-3′ (XbaI restriction site is underlined and ATG codon corresponding to methionine 420 is in bold) and a selection oligonucleotide 5′-GAATTCCGGAGCTGCAGATC-3′ for conversion of one unique restriction site, XmaIII to StuI (underlined), which was also unique, in pVL 1393 were used. The mutagenic experiments were carried out according to the Clontech protocol. The sequence of the constructs was confirmed by the dideoxynucleotide chain-termination method (17Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar) using a model 373A fluorescence sequenator (Applied Biosystems). Sf9 and High-five insect cells (Invitrogen) were grown as earlier described (15Krupenko S.A. Horstman D.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 457-464Google Scholar). The constructed transfer plasmids and linearized viral DNA were co-transfected into Sf9 cells using the BaculoGold transfection kit (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer directions. Recombinant viral stocks were amplified in Sf9 cells (15Krupenko S.A. Horstman D.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 457-464Google Scholar) to produce high titer virus stock. High-five cells were seeded as a monolayer in 25-cm2 flasks (about 2 × 106 cells/flask) and grown overnight. Each flask was infected with 0.1 ml of high-titer virus stock. Culture medium and cells were collected separately 2-4 days post-infection and the recombinant protein production was detected by SDS-PAGE (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) followed by western immunoblot analysis (19Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Google Scholar) with rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against pure rat liver FDH and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Bio-Rad) (20Leary J.J. Brigati D.J. Ward D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4045-4049Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford protein assay (21Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). For large scale recombinant protein production High-five cells were seeded in 225-cm2 flasks (about 20 × 106 cells/flask), and after growing overnight, each flask was infected with 1.0 ml of high titer virus stock. The culture medium, 96 h postinfection, was collected, centrifuged to remove detached cells, and was used to isolate recombinant protein. All buffers used in purification steps contained 10 mM 2-ME and 1 mM NaN3. FDH was purified as described earlier (15Krupenko S.A. Horstman D.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 457-464Google Scholar). To purify the COOH-terminal domain, ammonium sulfate was added to cell-free culture medium (about 100 ml) to 35% (20 g/100 ml) saturation at 4°C. The solution was centrifuged (15 min at 10,000 × g), and the pellet was dissolved in 5 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (10 min at 12,000 × g), and the solution was dialyzed overnight against the same buffer at 4°C. The solution was then passed through a hydroxyapatite column (1.5 × 10 cm) equilibrated with 5 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and then a linear gradient of phosphate (5-300 mM) was applied. The peak of the COOH-terminal domain was eluted at about 200 mM phosphate. Size-exclusion chromatography was done on a Sephacryl S-300 (Pharmacia) column (2.5 × 70 cm) at 4°C. The column was calibrated using a gel filtration calibration kit (Pharmacia). The sample (10 ml) was applied to the column equilibrated with 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 10 mM 2-ME and 1 mM NaN3 at a flow rate of 18 ml/h. Elution from the column was carried out with the same buffer at the same flow rate. Protein was detected using a flow through monitor (Pharmacia). Fractions of 4 ml were collected, and aldehyde dehydrogenase activity of the fractions was measured. The fractions were also analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis. All assays were performed at 30°C in a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 4B double beam spectrophotometer (Norwalk, CT). For measurement of hydrolase activity, the reaction mixture contained 0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mM 2-ME, and varying amounts of substrate, either 10-FTHF or 10-FDDF (0.5-18 μM). The enzyme (1 μg) was added in a final volume of 1.0 ml. The reaction was started by the addition of enzyme and read against a blank cuvette containing all components except enzyme. Appearance of product was measured at either 295 nm for 5,8-dideazafolate (DDF) or 300 nm for THF using molar extinction coefficients of 18.9 × 103 and 21.7 × 103 for DDF (22Smith G.K. Mueller W.T. Benkovic P.A. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1241-1245Google Scholar) and THF (7Case G.L. Kaisaki P.J. Steele R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10204-10207Google Scholar), respectively. Addition of NADP+ to the reaction mixture provided a measure of both dehydrogenase and hydrolase activity, i.e. total activity of the enzyme. Hydrolase activity measured in the absence of NADP+ was subtracted from the total activity to give the dehydrogenase activity. Dehydrogenase activity was also measured independently using the increase in absorbance at 340 nm due to production of NADPH and the molar extinction coefficient of 6.2 × 103. Aldehyde dehydrogenase activity was assayed using propanal essentially as described by Lindahl and Evces (23Lindahl R. Evces S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1984; 33: 3383-3389Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 50 mM CAPS buffer, pH 9.4, 5 mM propanal, 1 mM NADP+, and enzyme in a total volume of 1 ml. Activity was estimated from the increase in absorbance at 340 nm. Enzyme activity is given as nmol/min. Initial reaction rates were used to determine the respective enzyme activities. KCat (BioMetallics Inc., Princeton, N.J.) was used to determine kinetic parameters from the Michaelis-Menten equation by nonlinear regression. Binding of NADP+ and NAD+ to FDH and to its COOH-terminal domain and binding of 10-FDDF and DDF to the COOH-terminal domain were detected by measuring the quenching of enzyme fluorescence. These experiments were done on a Perkin-Elmer model 650-40 Fluorescence Spectrophotometer. Protein samples (about 10.0 nM) were in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and 50 mM 2-ME. In other experiments where binding of 10-FDDF and DDF was studied, 2-ME was omitted from the samples. The NADP+ concentration was varied from 0.02 μM to 10 μM and concentration of NAD+ was varied from 0.5 μM to 100.0 μM. The 10-FDDF and DDF concentrations were varied from 50 nM to 2500 nM. The experiments were done at 25°C. Fluorescence excitation was at 291 nm, and the emission was monitored at 340 nM (5Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 519-522Google Scholar, 24Birdsall B. King R.W. Wheeler M.R. Lewis C.A. Goode S.R. Dunlap R.B. Roberts G.C.K. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 353-361Google Scholar). The Kd for the ligands were calculated from data on fluorescence quenching in the presence of ligands that were plotted in a linear form. The value (1 − F/Fo)−1 was plotted against the inverse of ligand concentration (5Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 519-522Google Scholar, 25Chow S.F. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15516-15521Google Scholar). This is a modified form of the classical Stern-Volmer plot that relates the decrease in fluorescence to the concentration of a collisional quencher (26Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 199-227Google Scholar). F is intrinsic fluorescence observed at a quencher concentration; Fo is fluorescence in the absence of quencher. The slope of the line (least squares fit) gave a Kd. Variation of the measured values was about 5%. Nucleotide sequences were compiled and analyzed using DNA Strider 1.0. Data base searches were performed by BLASTP (27Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Google Scholar). The sequence alignment was achieved by GENALIGN (IntelliGenetics Inc.) using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm (28Needleman S. Wunsch C. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 48: 444-453Google Scholar). The expressed COOH-terminal domain was present in the culture medium as well as in the cells (Fig. 2). Maximum protein production was achieved at 4 days postinfection (Fig. 2) and continued at this level up to 6 days postinfection (data not shown). Distribution of the protein between cells and medium was almost equal, i.e. about 50% of the protein was released from cells to the medium (5 μl from a total volume of 2 ml of medium and 10 μl from a total volume of 2 ml of cell lysate were applied on the gel, i.e. for direct comparison, it is necessary to increase intensity of the bands in Fig. 2 corresponding to the COOH-terminal domain from the medium by 40 times). We previously used affinity chromatography on immobilized 5-formyltetrahydrofolate (29Cook R.J. Wagner C. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4427-4434Google Scholar, 30Cook R.J. Wagner C. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 122: 251-255Google Scholar) to easily purify recombinant FDH (5Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 519-522Google Scholar, 15Krupenko S.A. Horstman D.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 457-464Google Scholar). In the case of the COOH-terminal domain, the affinity chromatography was inffective with less than 10% of the protein retained on the column (data not shown). To purify the COOH-terminal domain, we used a two-step procedure that included precipitation with ammonium sulfate followed by chromatography on hydroxyapatite. We purified the COOH-terminal domain from the culture medium since 50% or more of the expressed protein was released from cells. Ammonium sulfate at 35% saturation in our experiments almost completely precipitated the COOH-terminal domain (Fig. 3). This step gave a good purification of the COOH-terminal domain and separated it from the major protein of the culture medium, bovine serum albumin, which precipitates from solution only at a high ammonium sulfate concentration (70-100% of saturation) (31Budavari, S., (ed) The Merck Index, 11th Ed., p. 37, Merk & Co., Inc., Rahway, NJ.Google Scholar). Chromatography of the 35% ammonium sulfate saturation fraction on hydroxyapatite showed that the COOH-terminal domain was retained by the column in 5 mM phosphate buffer and was eluted at a concentration of 200 mM phosphate. After this step, we obtained a preparation of the protein which was about 95% pure (Fig. 3). Analysis of enzyme activities of the COOH-terminal domain showed that the protein posseses aldehyde dehydrogenase activity similar to that of FDH. The specific activity, Km for propanal and Km for NADP+ were very close for these two proteins (Table I). Both proteins were able to oxidize substrate only in the presence of physiological concentrations of NADP+, but not NAD+ (concentrations of NAD+ up to 0.5 mM were tested in these experiments). At higher NAD+ concentrations (above 0.5 mM), we did observe aldehyde dehydrogenase activity with a Km for NAD+ of about 2 mM (Fig. 4). The quenching of tryptophan fluorescence with NADP+ showed that binding of NADP+ was very similar for the COOH-terminal domain and the entire protein (data not shown). Similar results were obtained after quenching of tryptophan fluorescence with NAD+, but affinity of the proteins for NAD+ was about 50-fold lower than for NADP+. The Kd calculated from these data are presented in Table II. In all cases, the quenching was saturable and revealed the presence of only a single type of binding site for each of the coenzymes. No further quenching of the fluorescence was observed when NAD+ was added to the complex of NADP+ with the proteins or when NADP+ was added to the complex of NAD+ with the proteins. To study whether NAD+ would inhibit the aldehyde dehydrogenase reaction through competition for the NADP+ binding site, we carried out the aldehyde dehydrogenase reaction in the presence of 5.0 μM NADP+ and much higher concentrations of NAD+ in the range of 10 μM to 1.0 mM. NAD+ did not inhibit aldehyde dehydrogenase reaction in these experiments. On the contrary, stimulation of the reaction in the presence of NAD+ was observed (Fig. 5). The maximum activation achieved was at 250-500 μM NAD+, and the increase in activity was about 70% for COOH-terminal domain and about 50% for FDH (Fig. 5). We calculated the activation constants for NAD+ from the difference between reaction rates in the presence of NAD+ and in the absence of NAD+ as a function of NAD+ concentration. This gave a value of 46 ± 12 μM of NAD+ for FDH and 92 ± 9 μM of NAD+ for the COOH-terminal domain. Assay of enzyme activity of the COOH-terminal domain in the presence of 10-FTHF or 10-FDDF showed that the protein has neither dehydrogenase nor hydrolase activity for these substrates (Table I).Table I.Kinetic parameters of the reactions performed by FDH and its COOH-terminal domainReactionaDehydrogenase and hydrolase reactions were performed using 10-formyl-5,8-dideazofolate as substrate; aldehyde dehydrogenase (aldehyde DH) reaction was carried out with propanal.ParameterbKm, μM; Vmax, nmol min−1 mg−1.Recombinant FDHCOOH-terminal domainHydrolaseKm5.8NAcNA, no activity.ReactionVmax85DehydrogenaseKm3.2NAReactionVmax144KmNADP1.1Aldehyde DHKm(propanal)690830ReactionVmax(NADP)3035Km(NADP)1.52.0Km(NAD)2,0002,000a Dehydrogenase and hydrolase reactions were performed using 10-formyl-5,8-dideazofolate as substrate; aldehyde dehydrogenase (aldehyde DH) reaction was carried out with propanal.b Km, μM; Vmax, nmol min−1 mg−1.c NA, no activity.

Assay was carried out as described under “Materials and Methods.” All samples contained 25 μM NADP+ and different concentrations of NAD+ (10 0.01-1.0 mM). The reaction was monitored against a reference cuvette that contained the same concentration of NAD+ in the absence of NADP+. About 2.5 μg of enzyme was added to both experimental and reference cuvettes. C-term., COOH-terminal.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The pH-dependence of the aldehyde dehydrogenase reaction was measured for both FDH and for its COOH-terminal domain. This was carried out using two buffers, potassium phosphate (pH 4.55-9.0) and CAPS (pH 8.6-11.43). No significant difference in the activity was found between the two buffers in the overlapping pH range. Fig. 6 shows that the profiles of pH dependence were almost identical for both proteins. The reaction has a pH maximum which lies in a narrow range between pH 9.2 and 9.5. We also tested the influence of 2-ME on aldehyde dehydrogenase activity of FDH and its COOH-terminal domain. For both proteins, the reaction was independent of the presence of 2-ME (Fig. 7). In contrast, the dehydrogenase reaction carried out by FDH with folate substrate was strictly dependent on the presence of 2-ME. The reaction required a relatively high concentration of 2-ME as, even in the presence of 10 mM of 2-ME, the reaction did not reach maximum velocity (Fig. 7). To investigate whether the COOH-terminal domain has a folate binding site, we measured tryptophan fluorescence in the presence of different concentrations of 10-FDDF or DDF. These experiments did not show any changes in tryptophan fluorescence of the protein in the presence of either 10-FDDF or DDF, demonstrating the absence of a folate binding site in this domain (data not shown). We studied the oligomeric structure of the COOH-terminal domain using size-exclusion chromatography on a Sephacryl S-300 column. For this purpose, we applied to the column the medium after COOH-terminal domain expression without any preceding purification steps and measured the aldehyde dehydrogenase activity of collected fractions. Fig. 8 shows that maximum aldehyde dehydrogenase activity eluted with a protein of about 220 kDa molecular mass. SDS-PAGE and western immunoblot analysis of the eluted fractions confirmed that the COOH-terminal domain was present in the fractions corresponding to a protein of about 220 kDa molecular mass (Fig. 8, inset). Since the molecular mass of the expressed COOH-terminal domain is 52,707 Da, we concluded that it exists as a tetramer. The fact that FDH has three catalytic activities suggests that the enzyme has several catalytic sites and that these sites could reside in different domains or that two or even three domains together could be involved in formation of a single catalytic site and be responsible for the activities. However, a combination of these two possibilities cannot be excluded, and some activities could belong to a single domain while other activities could be the result of several domains acting in concert. Thus, sequence identity between the COOH-terminal domain of FDH (residues 420-902) and a series of NAD-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenases suggests that the aldehyde dehydrogenase activity of FDH probably is carried out by the COOH-terminal domain alone, and the other two domains do not participate in this activity. Moreover, 77% of the glycine residues and 78% of the proline residues are conserved in sequences of the COOH-terminal domain of rat FDH and class I aldehyde dehydrogenase from mouse (Fig. 1), suggesting a similarity of tertiary structure and shape of these molecules. Recently, we showed that cysteine 707 of FDH is directly involved in the dehydrogenase active site (5Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 519-522Google Scholar) where it probably plays the role of a catalytic nucleophile. It has also been shown that this residue is crucial in both dehydrogenase reactions utilizing either 10-FTHF or aldehydes. This also suggests that the dehydrogenase catalytic site for 10-FTHF resides in the aldehyde dehydrogenase homologous COOH-terminal domain of FDH. Aldehyde dehydrogenases also have sites for binding aldehydes and the coenzyme, but there have been no reports about the presence of a folate binding site in these proteins. Aldehyde dehydrogenases act on a broad variety of aldehyde substrates (32Mukerjee N. Pietruszko R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 299: 23-39Google Scholar, 33Ambroziak W. Pietruszko R. Weiner H.

Wermuth B. Enzymology and Molecular Biology of Carbonyl Metabolism 5. Plenum Press, New York1995: 9-16Google Scholar), suggesting that the aldehyde binding site is not highly selective. It has been reported that aldehyde dehydrogenases bind and oxidize even very complicated compounds which bear ring structures, e.g. steroids (35Fukuba R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 341: 48-55Google Scholar, 36Martin K.O. Monder C. J. Steroid Biochem. 1978; 9: 1233-1240Google Scholar, 37Monder C. Purkaystha A.R. Pietruszko R. J.

Enzyme (Basel). 1992; 46: 239-244Google Scholar, 41Wang X. Penzes P. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16288-16293Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the question of whether aldehyde dehydrogenases bind these compounds in a general aldehyde binding site or whether there are separate binding sites for the various substrates has not been determined. It might be possible that the aldehyde dehydrogenase homologous COOH-terminal domain of FDH binds the folate substrate through the aldehyde binding site. On the other hand, its identity with aldehyde dehydrogenases does not exceed 49%, and so there is a mismatch in sequence of about 250 amino acid residues that could be enough to form a folate binding site. Expression of the COOH-terminal domain of FDH revealed that aldehyde dehydrogenase activity is indeed carried out by this domain and does not require participation of the two other domains. The kinetic parameters of the reaction were similar for both proteins, and both proteins displayed the same pH maximum for the reaction. The position of the pH maximum at basic pH corresponds to results reported for aldehyde dehydrogenases (42Lindahl R. Evces S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11986-11990Google Scholar) and is in agreement with the fact that the cysteine residue is an active site nucleophile in the aldehyde dehydrogenase reaction as rates of reactions with participation of thiols increase with increasing pH (43Stamler J.S. Slivka A. Nutr. Rev. 1996; 54: 1-30Google Scholar). However, the COOH-terminal protein completely lost its ability to oxidize 10-FTHF or 10-FDDF and did not interact with a folate affinity column, suggesting absence of the folate binding site. Titration of tryptophan fluorescence using 10-FDDF or DDF confirmed that the COOH-terminal domain has no folate binding site. Similar to other class 1 and class 2 aldehyde dehydrogenases (42Lindahl R. Evces S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11986-11990Google Scholar, 44Lindahl R. Evces S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11991-11996Google Scholar, 45Hempel J. Lindahl R. Weiner H. Flynn T.G. Enzymology and Molecular Biology of Carbonyl Metabolism 2. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1989: 3-17Google Scholar), the COOH-terminal domain exists as a tetramer proving that this domain is responsible for oligomerization of protomers of FDH. Surprisingly, we found that although NAD+ was binding to FDH and its COOH-terminal domain, it did not inhibit the aldehyde dehydrogenase reaction as a competitive inhibitor. Moreover, in our experiments, NAD+ activated the aldehyde dehydrogenase reaction performed by both FDH and its COOH-terminal domain. A similar effect of NAD+ on 10-FTHF hydrolase reaction performed by FDH was reported by Scrutton and Beis (3Scrutton M.C. Beis I. Biochem. J. 1979; 177: 833-846Google Scholar). At that time, high identity of FDH with aldehyde dehydrogenases was not known, and, therefore, the effect of NAD+ on aldehyde dehydrogenase activity was not studied. These results evoke two questions. First, what is the mechanism of such activation, and, second, is there any physiological significance of the NAD+ stimulation? Concerning the biological significance of the stimulation of dehydrogenase activity by NAD+, we would like to note that this effect was present at near physiological NAD+ concentrations (46Greenbaum A.L. Clark J.B. Biochem. J. 1965; 95: 161-166Google Scholar, 47Friedrich W. Vitamins. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin1988: 502Google Scholar), suggesting it could take place in the cell. At present, we have no reasonable explanation of the mechanism of NAD+ activation. It was reported that esterase activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase from horse liver was activated in the presence of NAD+ (48Feldman R.I. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 267-272Google Scholar), although the reaction does not require the coenzyme. The esterase activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase is associated with the aldehyde dehydrogenase catalytic center (49Duncan R.J.S. Biochem. J. 1985; 230: 261-267Google Scholar), and it was proposed that the presence of NAD+ increases nucleophilicity of an active site amino acid and makes the active site nucleophile chemically more reactive (50Takahashi K. Weiner H. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2720-2726Google Scholar). Although it is attractive to suggest that NAD+ activates dehydrogenase reactions of FDH by the same mechanism as the esterase reaction of aldehyde dehydrogenase, our study did not reveal presence of a separate binding site for NAD+ as necessary for such a mechanism. The aldehyde dehydrogenase reaction utilizing NAD+ instead of NADP+ probably has no physiological significance, and it may have occurred because of similarity between NADP+ and NAD+ structures. Theoretically, the activity of the enzyme under conditions where the concentration of NAD+ is at least four times lower than the Kd should not exceed 20%. Although the concentration of NADP+ in liver is about 5-80 times lower than the concentration of NAD+ (46Greenbaum A.L. Clark J.B. Biochem. J. 1965; 95: 161-166Google Scholar), the Km for NADP+ is three orders lower than the Km for NAD+. Therefore, at physiological concentrations of the coenzymes, 95% or more of the enzyme activity should result from NADP+ and 5% or less from NAD+. Earlier, we showed that the dehydrogenase and hydrolase reactions carried out by FDH on folate substrates are strictly dependent on the presence of 2-ME (8Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 651-655Google Scholar). We suggested that one of the possible reasons for 2-ME requirement could be the necessity to reduce the active site cysteine 707 (5Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 519-522Google Scholar, 8Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 651-655Google Scholar). However, as cysteine 707 is a key residue in both dehydrogenase reactions utilizing aldehydes or a folate substrate (5Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 519-522Google Scholar), the fact that the aldehyde dehydrogenase reaction does not require presence of 2-ME supports another role for 2-ME. Thus, it seems more likely that 2-ME is directly involved in the reaction utilizing folate substrates through formation of an intermediate complex with the enzyme and/or substrate. These results raise questions about the action of the FDH in vivo Can some natural sulfhydryl compounds such as glutathione substitute for 2-ME inside cells? Is there any physiological significance in the reaction performed on aldehyde sudstrates, and if so, how much of the enzyme is devoted to 10-FTHF dehydrogenase activity and how much devoted to aldehyde dehydrogenase activity? These questions are yet to be answered. In contrast to FDH, the Km for NADP+ for different aldehyde dehydrogenases is about 10-100-fold higher than the Km for NAD+ (42Lindahl R. Evces S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11986-11990Google Scholar, 51Senior D.J. Tsai C.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 262: 211-220Google Scholar), and thus, all aldehyde dehydrogenases use NAD+ in vivo (52Lindahl R. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 27: 283-335Google Scholar) producing NADH. NADH is an electron donor in pathways producing ATP while NADPH serves as electron donor in biosynthetic reactions. So, it is possible that the existence of two enzymes with different preferences for NAD+ or NADP+ serves to separate the electron flux and to direct energy release in reactions utilizing the same substrates into two different pathways, energetic or synthetic. It is very likely that the COOH-terminal domain of FDH originated from some pro-aldehyde dehydrogenase gene, but during evolution, the NAD+ binding site changed to an NADP+ binding site. The use of NADP+ by FDH also makes biological sense for folate substrates. NADPH produced by FDH can be used by other enzymes of folate metabolism for synthesis of other folate coenzymes, forming a folate/NADP+ cycle in which NADP+/NADPH may be channeled as well as the folate (53Kim D.W. Schirch V. FASEB J. 1995; 9 (Abstr. 191): A1289Google Scholar). Finally, we conclude that the present study answers several important questions. It is shown that the COOH-terminal domain of FDH can be folded by itself into a functional enzyme. The domain has sites responsible for protein oligomerization and bears an NADP+ binding site and aldehyde dehydrogenase catalytic center, but it has no folate binding site and does not bind folate substrates through the aldehyde binding site. Therefore, it cannot utilize the folate substrate in the absence of the rest of FDH. Apparently, the entire enzyme applies the aldehyde dehydrogenase machinery of this domain to perform the dehydrogenase reaction on a new substrate. This supports the hypothesis about the origin of FDH as a result of fusion of separate genes (9Cook R.J. Lloyd R.S. Wagner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4965-4973Google Scholar)."

The yeast MAD2 protein was first identified in a genetic screen to identify cell cycle checkpoint regulatory proteins, yet the mechanism by which MAD2 functions in cell cycle control is currently unclear. Here we show that hMAD2 requires the COOH-terminal 30 amino acids of the IR for interaction and that hMAD2 does not interact with the related insulin-like growth factor I receptor.

In support of this finding, hMAD2-GST fusions were found to interact strongly in vitro with receptors derived from noninsulin-stimulated cells. Furthermore, using two independent in vitro assays, IR activation was found to significantly reduce the interaction of hMAD2 with the IR. Lastly, we show that hMAD2 can be coimmunoprecipitated with the IR from Chinese hamster ovary IR cell lysates, suggesting that this interaction occurs in vivo in cells of mammalian origin. Our results suggest that hMAD2 represents a novel class of proteins that is specific for interaction with the IR as compared with the insulin-like growth factor I receptor and that interacts best with the inactive IR and is released upon receptor autophosphorylation.

In this study, we have dissected the human type VII collagen gene (COL7A1) promoter to characterize the cis-elements responsible for the expression of the gene in cultured fibroblasts and keratinocytes. Using transient cell transfections with various 5′ end deletion COL7A1 promoter/chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene plasmid constructs, we determined that the region between nucleotides −524 and −456, relative to the transcription start site, is critical for high promoter activity in both cell types studied. Gel mobility shift assays using several DNA fragments spanning this region identified a GT-rich sequence between residues −512 and −505, necessary for the binding of nuclear proteins to this region of the promoter. Point mutations abolished the binding of nuclear proteins in gel shift assays and drastically diminished the activity of the promoter in transient cell transfections. Supershift assays with antibodies against various transcription factors including Sp1, Sp3, c-Jun/AP-1, and AP-2, and competition experiments with oligonucleotides containing consensus sequences for Sp1 and AP-1 binding identified Sp1 as the transcription factor binding to this region of the COL7A1 promoter. Indeed, recombinant human Sp1 was shown to bind the COL7A1 promoter GT-rich element but not its mutated form in gel mobility shift assays. In addition, co-transfection of pPacSp1, an expression vector for Sp1, together with the COL7A1 promoter/chloramphenicol acetyltransferase construct into Sp1-deficient Drosophila Schneider SL2 cells unequivocally demonstrated that Sp1 is essential for high expression of the COL7A1 gene.

The collagens comprise a family of proteins that play a crucial role in the maintenance of the extracellular matrix integrity. The more abundant collagens, such as types I and III, have a widespread distribution throughout the body, whereas some minor collagens have a strictly limited tissue location. Among the latter, type VII collagen is found exclusively in the basement membrane zone of stratified squamous epithelia, such as in the skin, various mucous membranes, and the cornea of the eye (1Wetzels R.H.W. Robben H.C.M. Leigh I.M. Schaafsma H.E. Vooijs G.P. Ramaekers F.C.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 139: 451-459Google Scholar, 2Uitto J. Chung-Honet L.C. Christiano A.M. Exp. Dermatol. 1992; 1: 2-11Google Scholar). Specifically, type VII collagen is the predominant, if not the exclusive, component of anchoring fibrils, attachment structures that play a critical role in ensuring stability to the association of the basement membrane zone to the underlying papillary dermis (3Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Morris N.P. Burgeson R.E. J. Cell. Biol. 1986; 103: 1577-1586Google Scholar, 4Burgeson R.E. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 252-255Google Scholar). Although it is generally believed that the basement membrane is of epithelial origin, differentiated fibroblasts adjacent to epithelial tissue in vivo produce basement membrane components in general and type VII collagen in particular and assist in basement membrane assembly and anchoring fibril formation on the dermal side of the basement membrane (5Marinkovitch M.P. Keene D.R Rimberg C.S. Burgeson R.E. Dev. Dynamics. 1993; 197: 255-267Google Scholar). Therefore, it is considered that the two main cell types producing type VII collagen are keratinocytes and fibroblasts. Type VII collagen is a homotrimer, [α1(VII)]3, and each α-chain consists of a central collagenous domain of ∼145 kDa flanked by noncollagenous segments (6Christiano A.M. Rosenbaum L.M. Chung-Honet L.

Chem. 1994; 269: 20256-20262Google Scholar). The tissue form of type VII collagen has been suggested to be an anti-parallel dimer, associated through overlapping carboxyl-terminal regions between the individual molecules. These anti-parallel dimers then aggregate laterally to form the anchoring fibrils (4Burgeson R.E. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 252-255Google Scholar). Synthesis of functional anchoring fibrils is of critical importance in providing integrity to the cutaneous basement membrane zone, and abnormalities in these structures clinically manifest as dystrophic forms of epidermolysis bullosa, a group of bullous diseases characterized by cutaneous fragility and tendency to sub-basal lamina densa blister formation (8Christiano A.M. Uitto J. Curr. Opin. Dermatol. 1996; 3: 225-232Google Scholar). In fact, recent cloning of COL7A1 genomic sequences in our laboratory (9Christiano A.M. Hoffman G.G. Chung-Honet L.C. Lee S. Cheng W. Uitto J. Greenspan D.S. Genomics. 1994; 21: 169-179Google Scholar, 10Kivirikko S. Li K. Christiano A.M. Uitto J. J. Invest.

Analysis of the 5′ end sequences of both human and murine COL7A1 genes has revealed a promoter without either a canonical TATA or a CAAT box, upstream of the transcription initiation site (13Kivirikko S. Tamai K. Christiano A.M. Greenspan D.S. Uitto J. Matrix Biol. 1997; (in press)Google Scholar), a feature usually associated with so-called housekeeping genes. In this study, we have investigated the molecular mechanisms regulating the activity of human COL7A1 in dermal fibroblasts and epidermal keratinocytes, two principal cell types in the skin expressing the type VII collagen gene (2Uitto J. Chung-Honet L.C. Christiano A.M. Exp. Dermatol. 1992; 1: 2-11Google Scholar, 4Burgeson R.E. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 252-255Google Scholar). Human dermal fibroblast cultures, established by explanting tissue specimens obtained from neonatal foreskins, were utilized in passages 3-6. The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin-G, and 0.25 μg/ml Fungizone™). Human epidermal keratinocyte cultures, initiated by explanting foreskin specimens, were grown in serum-free, low calcium (0.15 mM) keratinocyte growth medium (Clonetics Corp., San Diego, CA), supplemented with epidermal growth factor, hydrocortisone, insulin, and bovine pituitary extract. Keratinocyte cultures were utilized in passages 1 and 2 to avoid differentiation inherent to prolonged subculturing of these cells. Drosophila melanogaster Schneider SL2 cells (14Schneider I. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1972; 27: 353-365Google Scholar), kindly provided by Dr. James B. Jaynes (Jefferson Medical College), were grown in Schneider medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin-G, 0.25 μg/ml Fungizone™) and 12% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. To study the transcriptional regulation of human type VII collagen gene (COL7A1) expression, transient transfection experiments were performed with various COL7A1 promoter 5′ deletion fragments cloned into promoterless pBS0CAT vector (15Fazio M.J. Kähäri V.-M. Bashir M.-M. Saitta B. Rosenbloom J. Uitto J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1990; 94: 191-196Google Scholar). A mutated promoter construct, −524m, was generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification using a 5′ end primer containing a double point mutation (in bold) in the GT box located between nucleotides −512 and −505, GGGTGGGG → GTTTGGGG, and a XhoI restriction site. At the 3′ end, a primer upstream of position +92 containing a HindIII restriction site was utilized. The resulting amplification product was cloned as a XhoI/HindIII fragment into pBS0CAT. The fidelity of both polymerase chain reaction and subcloning procedure was ensured by automated sequencing (ABI). pPacSp1, an expression vector for Sp1 driven by the actin promoter (16Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Google Scholar), a kind gift of Dr. Robert Tjian (University of California, Berkeley, CA), was used to express Sp1 in Drosophila SL2 cells deficient in Sp1. Empty pPac0 was used as a control. Transient cell transfections of human dermal fibroblasts were performed with calcium phosphate/DNA co-precipitation procedure (17Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456Google Scholar). Briefly, cultured cells were transfected with 10 μg of plasmid DNA and 2 μg of the pRSV-β-galactosidase plasmid DNA to monitor the transfection efficiencies (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

After glycerol shock, the cells were placed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% fetal calf serum. After 40 h of incubation, the cells were rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline, harvested by scraping, and lysed in 200 μl of Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). Basal keratinocytes grown in keratinocyte growth medium were transiently transfected with a liposome-based method (DOTAP, Boehringer Mannheim), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Sixteen hours after transfection, medium was replaced and cells were incubated for 40 h.

Drosophila SL2 cells were transfected with 2 μg of −524 COL7A1 promoter/CAT reporter gene plasmid construct together with 6 μg of either pPac0 or pPacSp1 by the calcium phosphate/DNA co-precipitation method. The DNA precipitates were left on the cells for 48 h. The cells were then collected by scraping, rinsed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by three cycles of freeze-thawing in 200 μl of reporter lysis buffer. CAT assay was performed as described above with identical amount of protein in each sample. The acetylated and nonacetylated forms of [14C]chloramphenicol were separated by thin layer chromatography and visualized by autoradiography. The promoter activity, reflected by CAT activity, was determined for each sample by expressing the radioactivity in the acetylated forms of [14C]chloramphenicol as a percentage of total radioactivity. The wild type (WT) fragment spanning the region between nucleotides −524 and −457 was generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification using the plasmid −722 COL7A1 as template. The polymerase chain reaction product was then run on a 2% agarose gel, electroeluted, and precipitated overnight at −80°C. The oligonucleotides I, IΔA, IΔB, ImA, II and III, spanning short segments of the WT fragment (Fig. 1), as well as Sp1 and AP-1, were synthesized on an Applied Biosystem automated DNA synthesizer. The nucleotide sequences and a schematic representation of the oligonucleotides used in this study are shown in Fig. 1, panels A and B, respectively. Nuclear extracts were isolated from human dermal fibroblasts or epidermal keratinocytes using a small scale preparation (20Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Google Scholar). Samples were aliquoted and stored at −80°C until use. The protein concentration in the extracts was determined using a commercial assay kit (Bio-Rad). Nuclear extracts (5 μg) were incubated for 20 min on ice in binding reaction buffer (10 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, at 4°C, 4% glycerol, 40 mM KCl, 0.4 mM EDTA, and 0.4 mM dithiothreitol) in the presence of 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) prior to the addition of gel-purified, 5′ end-labeled oligomers (0.05-0.1 pmol, 2-6 × 104 cpm) for another 20-min incubation at 4°C. For competition experiments, a 1-60-fold molar excess of unlabeled DNA was added to the binding reaction. For supershift experiments, nuclear extracts were incubated overnight at 4°C with 2 μg of polyclonal antibodies specific for c-Jun, AP-2, Sp1, or Sp3 (TransCruz™ Gel Supershift Reagents, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA) prior to the binding reactions. In experiments with human recombinant Sp1 (Promega Corp., Madison, WI), the amount of poly(dI-dC) per reaction was decreased to 500 ng, and bovine serum albumin (10 μg) was added to the samples. Samples were then separated by electrophoresis on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × Tris borate-EDTA buffer at 200 V for 2 h at 4°C, fixed for 1 h in 30% methanol-10% acetic acid, vacuum-dried, and autoradiographed. To localize the cis-acting elements involved in the basal activity of the COL7A1 promoter, human dermal fibroblast and epidermal keratinocyte cultures were transiently transfected with several 5′ end deletion/CAT reporter gene constructs spanning the COL7A1 promoter region from positions −722 to +92 relative to the transcription start site, +1. A high level of activity was detected with constructs −722 and −524 in both cell types (Fig. 2, panels A and C). Subsequent 5′ deletion of 68 bp to position −456 led to a dramatic reduction (70-90%) of the promoter activity, whereas additional deletions to positions −396 and −230 had no further effect (Fig. 2, panels B and D). These data suggest that the DNA sequences located between residues −524 and −456 are essential in providing high basal activity to the human COL7A1 promoter constructs in both dermal fibroblasts and epidermal keratinocytes. To elucidate the transcriptional mechanisms of type VII collagen gene expression, and in particular, the role played by the region of promoter comprised between residues −524 and −456, we analyzed the binding of nuclear factors to this region. For this purpose, we designed a series of oligonucleotides spanning this whole region. Their sequences and relative positions are depicted in Fig. 1. Gel mobility shift assays were performed either with the oligonucleotide WT, containing the entire sequence of the −524/−457 region of the COL7A1 promoter, or with three shorter oligonucleotides, I, II, and III, spanning the regions −524/−491, −490/−457, and −500/−475, respectively (see Fig. 1). Incubation of the radiolabeled WT oligonucleotide with fibroblast nuclear extracts resulted in the formation of two major DNA/protein complexes, identified as shifts 1 and 3 (Fig. 3, lane 2). The formation of these two complexes could be abolished by the addition of a 60-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide I (Fig. 3, lane 3), but there was no competition by the addition of the same molar excess of the unlabeled oligonucleotides II or III (Fig. 3, lanes 4 and 5, respectively). Together, these data indicate that binding of nuclear proteins to the −524/−456 region of human COL7A1 promoter occurs within the region spanned by oligonucleotide I, from position −524 to −491. In parallel studies, fragment I was used as a probe in gel mobility shift assays. An electrophoretic pattern similar to that obtained with radiolabeled WT was observed, with the exception that the slowest migrating complex appeared as a doublet instead of a single band; these bands were identified as shifts 1 and 2 (Fig. 3, lanes 6-9). The formation of all three distinct DNA-protein complexes 1, 2, and 3 was abolished by the addition of a 60-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide I (Fig. 3, lane 7) but not by a 60-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides II or III (Fig. 3, lanes 8 and 9, respectively), further indicating that these three complexes specifically bind to fragment I. No specific DNA-protein complex was detected when either fragment II (Fig. 3, lanes 10-13) or fragment III (data not shown) was used as a probe. Similar results were obtained when nuclear proteins extracted from either dermal fibroblasts (see Fig. 3) or epidermal keratinocytes (data not shown) were used in gel mobility shift assays with the various radiolabeled probes. It should be noted that the electrophoretic pattern generated by nuclear extracts from fibroblasts is similar to that of keratinocyte extracts, both qualitatively and quantitatively (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and 6 versus lanes 2 and 5), suggesting that the regulatory mechanisms controlled by this region of COL7A1 promoter may be similar in both cell types. The next set of experiments was designed to further identify the cis-acting element(s) responsible for the binding of fibroblast nuclear extracts to the 34-bp segment of the COL7A1 promoter located between residues −524 and −491 (oligonucleotide I). Computer analysis for sequence homologies to known transcription factor binding sites was performed (DNASIS software, Hitachi Software Engineering Co., Yokohama, Japan), revealing two distinct areas of interest: (a) a 8-bp GT-rich sequence (GGGTGGGG) located between nucleotides −512 and −505, referred to as box A and (b) a potential γ-interferon response element, CAGGAGGC, located between nucleotides −502 and −495, referred to as box B. To determine whether these two boxes were involved in the binding of nuclear proteins to fragment I, two oligonucleotides were designed spanning the whole region covered by oligomer I but devoid of either box A (IΔA) or box B (IΔB), respectively (see Fig. 1). Gel mobility shift assays performed in parallel with probes I, IΔA, or IΔB indicated that deletion of the 8-bp region encompassing box A (probe IΔA) abolished the formation of DNA-protein complexes detected with probe I (Fig. 5A, lane 4 versus lane 2), whereas deletion of box B (probe IΔB) did not alter the binding pattern obtained with probe I (Fig. 5A, lane 6 versus lane 2). These data demonstrate that the formation of all three DNA-protein complexes, shifts 1, 2, and 3, require box A between nucleotides −512 and −505. The critical role of box A was further confirmed in competition experiments with unlabeled oligonucleotides IΔA and IΔB (Fig. 5B). Specifically, the binding activity of nuclear extracts to probe I (Fig. 5B, lane 2) was abolished by the addition of a 60-fold molar excess of cold oligonucleotide IΔB (Fig. 5B, lane 5), but it was not altered by the addition of the same molar excess of oligonucleotide IΔA (Fig. 5B, lane 8). To further understand the importance of box A in the transcription of COL7A1, an oligonucleotide, ImA, containing a double mutation in box A (in bold), GGGTGGGG→GTTTGGGG, was generated for use in gel mobility shift assays. A 60-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligomer ImA used as a competitor in a binding reaction with radiolabeled oligomer I failed to compete with the binding of nuclear proteins to probe I (Fig. 6A, lane 4), whereas an identical amount of unlabeled oligonucleotide I abolished the binding of all three complexes 1, 2, and 3 (Fig. 6A, lane 3 versus lane 2). Furthermore, no DNA-protein complexes were detected when the mutated oligonucleotide ImA was used as a probe in a parallel DNA-protein binding assay (Fig. 6A, lane 6 versus lane 2). Collectively, these experiments demonstrate that box A is responsible for the formation of three separate DNA-protein complexes in the −524/−491 region of the human COL7A1 promoter and that the two adjacent guanosine nucleotides mutated within box A are critical for DNA-protein interaction. Also, these data indicate that box B, identified by computer sequence analysis, is not critical for basal expression of COL7A1 To evaluate the contribution of the GT box identified between residues −512 and −505 to the basal activity of the human COL7A1 promoter, a nucleotide substitution identical to that introduced into oligomer ImA (see above and Fig. 1) was created in the −524 COL7A1 promoter/CAT construct, generating the construct −524m (see “Materials and Methods”). The basal activity of the two constructs was compared in transient cell transfections. Mutation of the GT box led to a dramatic drop, ∼70%, of the basal promoter activity as compared with that of the wild type −524 CAT construct, both in fibroblasts (Fig. 6B) and in keratinocytes (Fig. 6C). In fact, the CAT activity of the −524m construct was comparable with that of the −456 construct, suggesting that the 8-bp GT-rich sequence, located between nucleotides −512 and −505 and designated as box A, is crucial in providing high basal activity of COL7A1 promoter in both cell types. GT boxes, such as found in box A, have been previously described in other gene promoters and shown to be potential binding sites for the transcription factor Sp1 (21Li R. Knight J.D. Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Botchan M.R. Cell. 1991; 65: 493-505Google Scholar), although more classical Sp1-binding sites generally consist of GC boxes (22Gidoni D. Dynan W.S. Tjian R. Nature. 1984; 312: 409-413Google Scholar, 23Kadonaga J.T. Jones K.A. Tjian R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 20-23Google Scholar). Further, the electrophoretic pattern observed in mobility shift assays with radiolabeled oligonucleotide I as a probe closely resembles that of Sp1 binding. To ascertain that the GT box between residues −512 and −505 of the COL7A1 promoter is an Sp1-binding site, an oligonucleotide containing a high affinity Sp1 recognition site (GC box) was used as a competitor in gel mobility shift assays with probe I (Fig. 7A). The binding of nuclear factors to probe I (Fig. 7A, lane 2) was competed away by unlabeled homologous DNA (COL7A1 GT box), in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7A, lanes 3-5), as well as the consensus Sp1 (GC box) oligonucleotide (Fig. 7A, lanes 6-8). In contrast, the binding was not affected by a 60-fold molar excess of a consensus AP-1 oligonucleotide (Fig. 7A, lane 9), attesting to the specificity of the competition by the Sp1 oligonucleotide. These observations prompted us to explore the possibility that Sp1 or an Sp1-related protein may interact with the GT box located between nucleotides −512 and −505 of the human COL7A1 promoter. Toward this end, supershift experiments were performed with polyclonal antiserum specific for either Sp1, AP-2, or c-Jun. As shown in Fig. 7B, the two major complexes observed with the WT oligonucleotide were replaced by a unique supershifted complex when using the polyclonal anti-Sp1 antiserum (Fig. 7B, lane 2 versus lane 1). In contrast, no supershift was observed when using specific antibodies directed against AP-2 (Fig. 7B, lane 3) or c-Jun (Fig. 7B, lane 4). Similarly, the Sp1 antibody supershifted all three complexes formed with oligonucleotide I (Fig. 7B, lane 6 versus lane 5), whereas neither AP-2 nor c-Jun antibodies had an effect on the electrophoretic mobility of the DNA-protein complexes (Fig. 7B, lanes 7 and 8, respectively). These data indicate that all three complexes are immunologically related to Sp1. Recently, several novel factors binding to either GC or GT boxes have been identified by cDNA cloning, and many of these proteins are closely related to Sp1 (24Hagen G. Muller S.M.B. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Google Scholar, 25Imataka H. Sogawa K. Yasumoto K. Kikuchi Y. Sasano K. Kobayashi A. Hayami M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3663-3671Google Scholar, 26Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4251-4261Google Scholar, 27Sogawa K. Imataka H. Yamasaki Y. Kusume H. Abe H. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1527-1532Google Scholar). Indeed, three of these proteins have been characterized in detail and designated Sp2, Sp3, and Sp4, putative new members of the Sp1 multigene family. These proteins are predicted to contain zinc finger and trans-activation domains similar to those found in Sp1. Among these factors, Sp3 is strikingly homologous to Sp1 (26Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4251-4261Google Scholar). However, a polyclonal antibody against Sp3 did not supershift any of the DNA-protein complexes formed by incubating nuclear extracts from fibroblasts with either WT or I oligonucleotides, indicating that Sp3 does not participate in the formation of these shifts (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that Sp1 is the transcription factor involved in the binding to the GT box located between nucleotides −512 and −505 of the COL7A1 promoter. To formally prove that Sp1 binds to the 8-bp GT-rich box of the COL7A1 promoter (box A), gel mobility shift assays were performed using human recombinant Sp1 protein (Fig. 8). Indeed, recombinant Sp1 effectively bound to probes WT (Fig. 8, lane 2) and I (Fig. 8, lane 4) and to the consensus Sp1-binding site oligonucleotide (Fig. 8, lane 8). However, this DNA-Sp1 interaction was not noted when oligonucleotide ImA, in which the GT box has been altered, was used as a probe (Fig. 8, lane 6) Together with the results of competition and supershift assays described above, these data unequivocally demonstrate that Sp1 is the protein binding to the GT-rich sequence located between nucleotides −512 and −505 of COL7A1 Also, these data indicate that integrity of box A is required for Sp1 binding. These results clearly identify that all major DNA-protein complexes observed with either probe WT (shifts 1 and 3) or probe I (shifts 1 and 2) are due to Sp1 binding. Because the formation of multiple complexes between Sp1 and a single DNA probe has been previously reported (24Hagen G. Muller S.M.B. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Google Scholar, 28Robidoux S. Gosselin P. Harvey M. Leclerc S. Guerin S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3796-3806Google Scholar), we speculate that the fastest migrating complex (shift 3) is a minor degradation product of the Sp1 protein, as described previously (29Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 125-133Google Scholar). The two larger complexes observed with radiolabeled oligonucleotide I (shifts 1 and 2) are likely to represent two states of differential phosphorylation of Sp1 (30Jackson S.P. McDonald J.J. Lees-Miller S. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 63: 155-165Google Scholar). At this point, we cannot explain the presence of a single upper band when oligonucleotide WT is used as a probe. As a critical test for the requirement of Sp1 in COL7A1 promoter activity, the −524 COL7A1 promoter/CAT construct was co-transfected into Drosophila SL2 cells in the presence of either pPacSp1 or pPac0 (see “Materials and Methods”). As shown in Fig. 9, the COL7A1 promoter had negligible basal activity in Sp1-deficient SL2 cells. In contrast, the promoter activity was highly induced in response to Sp1 expression, demonstrating that Sp1 is a transcription factor essential for high expression of the COL7A1 gene. The interest in studying the regulation of COL7A1 gene expression is motivated by the fact that this gene product is essential for the integrity of the attachment of the epidermis to the underlying dermis. Indeed, structural abnormalities, paucity, or even absence of type VII collagen/anchoring fibrils manifest clinically as the dystrophic forms of epidermolysis bullosa, a group of blistering skin diseases characterized by cutaneous fragility and tendency to sub-basal lamina densa blister formation (31Uitto J. Christiano A.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 687-692Google Scholar). In the present study, we provide compelling evidence for the role of the transcription factor Sp1 in maintaining high expression of COL7A1 in both fibroblasts and keratinocytes, the two principal cell types expressing type VII collagen gene in the skin (2Uitto J. Chung-Honet L.C. Christiano A.M. Exp. Dermatol. 1992; 1: 2-11Google Scholar, 4Burgeson R.E. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 252-255Google Scholar). It has been previously assumed that the transcription initiation of eukaryotic genes could be directed either by the TATA sequence as in tissue-specific genes or by GC/GT boxes as is the case in several TATA-less housekeeping genes. In the latter case, the TATA-binding protein, TFIID, does not directly interact with the DNA but is positioned indirectly to the correct initiation site via protein-protein interactions. In this context, Sp1 has recently been found to be able to recruit TATA-binding protein, thereby positioning the initiation complex to the correct start site (32Pugh B.F. Tjian R. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1935-1945Google Scholar, 33Rigby P.W.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 7-10Google Scholar, 34Wu R.-L. Chen T.-T. Sun T.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28450-28459Google Scholar). The Sp1 binding site crucial for the maintenance of the high transcriptional activity of human COL7A1 is located at position −505, away from the transcription start site, and may not be involved in the initiation of the transcription. In this context, three other Sp1 sites (GGGCGGG) are located at positions −150, −121, and −25 upstream of the transcription initiation site (13Kivirikko S. Tamai K. Christiano A.M. Greenspan D.S. Uitto J. Matrix Biol. 1997; (in press)Google Scholar). The fact that the COL7A1 promoter not only lacks a typical TATA element but also contains a Sp1 motif at a position usually occupied by the TATA box, around position −20, supports the notion that Sp1 may be involved in the initiation of the transcription of TATA-less promoter genes. Although Sp1 was originally described as a ubiquitous transcription factor regulating housekeeping genes, recent observations indicate that its expression can be regulated during development (35Saffer J.D. Jackson S.P. Annarella M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2189-2199Google Scholar) and that it may be important for the cell type-specific regulation of gene expression, as exemplified by studies on the keratinocyte-specific keratin K3 gene (36Regauer S. Seiler G.R. Barrandon Y. Easley K.W. Compton C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2109-2115Google Scholar), demonstrating a direct correlation between the levels of Sp1 and the expression of K3. In the case of type VII collagen, Sp1 binding to box A was identical in both fibroblasts and keratinocytes (see Fig. 4), contrasting with the results of Regauer et al. (36Regauer S. Seiler G.R. Barrandon Y. Easley K.W. Compton C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2109-2115Google Scholar) on K3 gene expression. Both cell types have been shown to express and synthesize type VII collagen (5Marinkovitch M.P. Keene D.R Rimberg C.S. Burgeson R.E. Dev. Dynamics. 1993; 197: 255-267Google Scholar, 36Regauer S.

Dermatol. 1994; 102: 205-209Google Scholar), and although basal expression of COL7A1 in vitro may be higher in keratinocytes (39Ryynänen J. Sollberg S. Parente M.G. Chung L.C. Christiano A.M. Uitto J. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 163-168Google Scholar, 40König A. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Lab. Invest. 1994; 70: 203-209Google Scholar), there is clear indication that fibroblasts participate in producing basement membrane components, including type VII collagen in vivo and assisting in basement membrane assembly (5Marinkovitch M.P. Keene D.R Rimberg C.S. Burgeson R.E. Dev. Dynamics. 1993; 197: 255-267Google Scholar). The Sp1 binding elements have also been suggested to play a role in the regulation of the expression of other collagen genes. For example, Sp1 sites between nucleotides −342 and −271 of the human COL1A2 gene have been suggested to play a role in transforming growth factor β-mediated up-regulation of the promoter activity (41Inagaki Y. Truter S. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14828-14834Google Scholar). However, we have recently excluded these Sp1 sites from growth factor responsiveness, although they are essential for basal activity of the promoter (42Chung K.-Y. Agarwal A. Uitto J. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3272-3278Google Scholar), the latter observation being in agreement with another recent study (43Tamaki T. Ohnishi K. Hartl C. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4299-4304Google Scholar). Also, it should be noted that Sp1 was recently shown to be essential for the basal expression of other extracellular matrix genes, including syndecan-1 (44Vihinen T. Määttä A. Jaakkola P. Auvinen P. Jalkanen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12532-12541Google Scholar), COL1A1 (45Li L. Artlett C. Jimenez S.A. Hall D. Varga J. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 164: 229-234Google Scholar), COL6A1 (46Willimann T.E. Trueb B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 332-338Google Scholar), and the collagen/laminin receptor α2 integrin (47Zutter M.M. Santoro S.A. Painter A.S. Tsung Y.L. Gafford A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 463-469Google Scholar), and may therefore be an important factor in repair processes, such as wound healing. In summary, using a series of 5′ deletion constructs of the COL7A1 promoter, we have identified a functional region within the human COL7A1 promoter necessary for relatively high level of expression of the gene in both fibroblasts and keratinocytes. This region located between nucleotides −524 and −456 contains a functional GT box that binds Sp1 between residues −512 and −505. Disruption of the nucleotide sequence of this 8-bp element prevents the binding of Sp1 and reduces the promoter activity by ∼70%. In addition, recombinant expression of Sp1 in Sp1-deficient Drosophila SL2 cells results in high expression of the COL7A1 promoter. Collectively, these results provide the first in-depth characterization of the transcription mechanisms regulating the expression of COL7A1 Also, our study provides further evidence that Sp1 is an essential transcription factor for the expression of extracellular matrix genes.

DNA-dependent protein kinase DNA-PK catalytic subunit Chinese hamster ovary x-ray-sensitive double-stranded break polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis replication protein A. Molecular analysis of these DNA-repair mutant cells indicates that DNA-PK is required for the rejoining of double-stranded DNA breaks, but the mechanism by which DNA-PK functions in this process has yet to be elucidated. DNA-PK is a serine and threonine protein kinase that is activated by double-stranded DNA containing single-stranded to double-stranded transitions, such as DNA-ends, nicks, gaps, and stem-loop structures (14Morozov V.E. Falzon M. Anderson C.W. Kuff E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16684-16688Google Scholar). In vitro, the Ku and catalytic subunits of DNA-PK assemble in a DNA-dependent manner (15Suwa A. Hirakata M. Takeda Y. Jesch S.A. Mimori T. Hardin J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6904-6908Google Scholar), and the DNA-bound holoenzyme preferentially phosphorylates substrates that are bound to the same DNA molecule (1Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 131-142Google Scholar, 16Dvir A. Stein L.Y. Calore B.L. Dynan W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10440-10447Google Scholar). DNA-PK has been shown to phosphorylate a broad range of proteins in vitro, most of which are DNA-binding proteins (17Lees-Miller S.P. Anderson C.W. Cancer Cells. 1991; 3: 341-346Google Scholar), including the Ku70 and Ku80 subunits of DNA-PK (18Lees-Miller S.P. Chen Y.-R. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell.

Based on these data, it has been proposed that DNA-PK binds to double-stranded DNA breaks produced in the cell by DNA-damaging agents or during V(D)J recombination. The DNA-bound holoenzyme could then participate in the DNA-rejoining process by phosphorylating Ku and other protein factors that are colocalized with the kinase at the site of the strand breaks. In this report, we present data that further demonstrates the importance of DNA-PK in the DNA double-stranded break repair process by showing that two DNA double-stranded break repair-deficient cell lines have defects that disrupt the catalytic activity of DNA-PK. The CHO cell lines IRS-20 (20Stackhouse M.A. Bedford J.S. Radiat. Res. 1993; 136: 241-249Google Scholar, 21Stackhouse M.A. Bedford J.S. Radiat. Res. 1993; 136: 250-254Google Scholar) and SX9 (22Warters R. Barrows L. Chen D. Mutat. Res. 1995; 336: 1-7Google Scholar) both express DNA-PK catalytic subunits that can assemble on double-stranded DNA but lack detectable protein kinase activity. The expression and activity of the Ku subunits of DNA-PK are normal in each cell line, and DNA-PK activity can be restored to both the IRS-20 and SX-9 cell extracts by addition of purified DNA-PKcs. Transfer of human chromosome 8, which contains the DNA-PKcs gene, can also rescue the kinase defect of the IRS-20 cells. These data are consistent with the IRS-20 and SX-9 cells being in the same complementation group as the mouse scid and CHO V3 cells and support the hypothesis that DNA-PK-mediated protein phosphorylation is an essential component of the DNA double-stranded break repair pathway. Cells were grown as monolayer cultures (10B2, IRS-20, IRS-20 (Neo8), M10, LX830, SL3147, and H5) (22Warters R. Barrows L. Chen D. Mutat. Res. 1995; 336: 1-7Google Scholar, 23Sato K. Chen D.

Cell extracts were prepared as described previously (6Peterson S.R. Kurimasa A. Oshimura M. Dynan W.S. Bradbury E.M. Chen D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3171-3174Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were swelled in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 5 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml SBTI, 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin A and aprotinin) for 10 min on ice and then lysed using a Dounce homogenizer with a loose fitting pestle. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min. at 2000 × g and extracted for 30 min. on ice using nuclear extraction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.5 M NaCl, 20% glycerol, 10% sucrose, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma), 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin A, and aprotinin). The cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were combined, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 30 min. The extracts were then dialyzed against TM buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 12.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 20% glycerol) containing 100 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml SBTI, 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin A, and aprotinin. The protein concentration of the dialyzed extracts was determined by Bradford analysis, and each extract was diluted to give a final protein concentration equal to 5 mg/ml. 100 μg of protein from whole cell extracts was resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with the anti-Ku70 mouse monoclonal antibody N3H10 and the anti-DNA-PKcs monoclonal antibodies 18-2 and 42-26, as described previously (6Peterson S.R. Kurimasa A. Oshimura M. Dynan W.S. Bradbury E.M. Chen D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3171-3174Google Scholar). Sheared salmon sperm DNA dissolved in 10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, was incubated for 30 min with cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose CL6-B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) at 25°C. The beads were then washed with 100 ml of 1 M ethanolamine, pH 8.0, and then incubated with an additional 40 ml of 1 M ethanolamine for 30 min at 25°C to block the remaining reactive groups on the beads. The DNA-agarose beads were then washed 5 times with 40 ml of deionized water and stored at 4°C prior to use. The amount of DNA coupled to the beads was estimated to be approximately 0.1 mg of DNA/ml of bead, which was calculated by subtracting the amount of DNA that remained after the coupling reaction from the total used in preparing the beads. DNA-protein complexes were formed on the DNA beads by mixing 50 μl (250 μg total protein) of cell extract with an equal volume of a 1:1 slurry of the DNA-agarose beads in H20. In some cases, as indicated in the Figs. 1C, 1D, 2A, and 4B legends, purified HeLa cell DNA-PKcs or Ku70/80 was used to supplement the mutant cell extracts. The DNA-bead reactions were incubated for 30 min at 25°C and then washed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold TM buffer containing 50 mM KCl to remove weakly associated proteins. The washed DNA beads were then processed for immunoblot analysis by boiling with 30 μl of SDS sample buffer or used for protein kinase assays as described below.Fig. 2Altered expression and activity of DNA-PK in the DNA double-stranded break repair-deficient cell line IRS-20. A, phosphorylation of RPA was analyzed as in Fig. 1C using extracts prepared from the wild-type CHO cell line 10B2 (lanes a and b), mutant IRS-20 cells (lanes c, d, g and h), and the IRS-20 cells transfected with human chromosome 8 (IRS-20(Neo8), lanes e and f).

Protein samples were resolved by 6% SDS-PAGE and analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Arrows indicate the position of the DNA-PKcs and Ku70 subunits. The lower molecular weight band observed in the DNA-PKcs blot results from the cross-reactivity of the antibody with an unknown 200-kDa protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 4The SX9 DNA-PKcs has diminished protein kinase activity.

A typical purification was performed using 50 ml of HeLa cell nuclear extract (10 mg/ml) prepared as described previously (16Dvir A. Stein L.Y. Calore B.L. Dynan W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10440-10447Google Scholar) and a 2-ml anti-Ku80 affinity matrix containing 1 mg/ml Ku80 antibody (25Li L.L. Yeh N.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 199: 262-268Google Scholar) covalently coupled to protein G-agarose beads. Ku70/80 complexes were adsorbed to the antibody beads by tumbling the HeLa cell extract overnight at 4°C. The column bound Ku70/80 complexes were subsequently washed with HEPES chromatography buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 mM EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, pepstatin A, and leupeptin) containing 0.5 M KCl to remove weakly bound proteins. Ku70/80 was eluted from the antibody column using a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 50% ethylene glycol, and 1.75 M MgCl2. The affinity purified Ku70/80 was then extensively dialyzed into TM buffer containing 0.1 M KCl prior to use in kinase assays. DNA-PKcs was purified from HeLa cell nuclear extracts as described previously (16Dvir A. Stein L.Y. Calore B.L. Dynan W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10440-10447Google Scholar) by phosphocellulose P-11, DEAE-Sepharose, heparin-agarose, and Superdex 200 (Pharmacia) column chromatography. Protein concentrations of the DNA-PKcs and Ku70/80 were obtained by Bradford analysis. 500 ng of purified recombinant human replication protein A (26Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Google Scholar) was added to washed DNA-protein complexes assembled on the DNA beads and incubated for 10 min at 25°C. Protein kinase reactions were initiated by addition of 12.5 μM ATP containing 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and incubated for 60 min at 30°C. Kinase reactions were terminated by boiling for 3 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the phosphorylated proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography of the dried gel. To screen previously uncharacterized DNA double-stranded break repair-deficient cell lines for mutations that affect DNA-PK, we developed an assay to measure the kinase activity of DNA-PK in cell extracts. In this assay, DNA-PK activity is determined by evaluating the phosphorylation of the 32-kDa subunit of recombinant human replication protein A (RPA) (26Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Google Scholar), which has previously been shown to be a substrate for DNA-PK in vitro (27Pan Z.-Q. Amin A.A. Gibbs E. Niu H. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8343-8347Google Scholar, 28Brush G.S. Anderson C.W. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12520-12524Google Scholar) and may also be phosphorylated by this enzyme in vivo in response to DNA damage (19Boubnov N. Weaver D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5700-5706Google Scholar). To enrich for DNA-PK from cell extracts, protein kinase reactions are first assembled on a DNA substrate covalently attached to agarose beads. This allows for the removal of weakly bound protein kinases by washing the DNA beads prior to initiating the kinase reactions. We first tested the phosphorylation of RPA by DNA-PK using these assay conditions with purified HeLa cell DNA-PK (Fig. 1). As expected, in the absence of the Ku70/80 complex, phosphorylation of the 32-kDa RPA subunit by the DNA-PKcs was much lower than that observed for the holoenzyme (Fig. 1B, compare lanes b and c). This was likely due to the removal of the majority of the DNA-PKcs from the DNA beads during the washing step. To test whether the RPA kinase assay could discriminate DNA-PK activity from other kinases capable of phosphorylating RPA in cell extracts, we compared the RPA kinase activity in extracts prepared from wild-type and known DNA-PK mutant cell lines. RPA kinase activity was detected in cell extracts derived from the wild-type CHO cell line AA8, but was absent in the CHO K1-derived DNA-PKcs mutant cell line V3 (4Blunt T. Finnie N.J. Taccioli G.E. Smith G.C.M. Demengeot J. Gottlieb T.M. Mizuta R. Varghese A.J. Alt F.W. Jeggo P.A. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1995; 80: 813-823Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C, compare lanes b and d). RPA kinase activity was restored to the V3 cell extract by the addition of 50 ng of purified DNA-PK catalytic subunit (Fig. 1C, lane f). Similarly, extracts prepared from the large T antigen immortalized scid mouse cell line SCVA2 (6Peterson S.R. Kurimasa A. Oshimura M. Dynan W.S. Bradbury E.M. Chen D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3171-3174Google Scholar) also lacked RPA kinase activity in this assay, whereas SCVA2 cells containing human chromosome 8 (SC (8Rathmell W.K. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7623-7627Google Scholar)-10) (29Kurimasa A. Nagata Y. Emi M. Nakamura Y. Oshimura M. Hum. Genet. 1993; 93: 21-26Google Scholar) had strong RPA kinase activity (Fig. 1D, compare lanes b and d). RPA kinase activity was restored to the SCVA2 cell extracts by addition of purified DNA-PKcs (Fig. 1D, lane f). To determine whether the RPA kinase assay was also sensitive to mutations that disrupt the activity of the Ku complex, we measured RPA phosphorylation using extracts derived from the Ku80 mutant cell line XRS6C and XRS6C cells that were engineered to express the human Ku80 protein (30Chen F. Peterson S.R. Story M.D. Chen D.J. Mutat. Res. 1995; 362: 9-19Google Scholar). We found that RPA kinase activity was absent in the XRS6C cell extracts but was present in extracts derived from the Ku80 expressing XRS6C cells (Fig. 1E, compare lanes b and d). Since the RPA kinase assay was capable of discriminating between wild-type and known DNA-PK mutant cells, we used it to screen seven DNA double-stranded break repair-deficient rodent cell lines for DNA-PK kinase activity: IRS-20 (23Sato K. Chen D. Eguchi-Kasai K. Itsukaichi H. Odaka T. Strniste G. Radiat. Res. 1995; 36: 38-45Google Scholar), M10, LX830, SX9, and SX10 (22Warters R. Barrows L. Chen D. Mutat. Res. 1995; 336: 1-7Google Scholar, 23Sato K. Chen D. Eguchi-Kasai K. Itsukaichi H. Odaka T. Strniste G. Radiat. Res. 1995; 36: 38-45Google Scholar), SL3147, and H5 (24Warters R. Lyons B. Chen D. Sato K. Mutat. Res. 1993; 293: 91-98Google Scholar). Of these cells, we found the CHO mutant IRS-20 and the mouse mammary carcinoma cell line SX9 lacked detectable RPA-kinase activity. We chose to first characterize the IRS-20 cell line since it has recently been shown that DNA double-stranded break repair in these cells can be complemented by transfection of human chromosome 8. 2J. Y.-D.Lin, M. C. Muhlmann-Diaz, M. A. Stackhouse, J. F. Robinson, G. E. Taccioli, and J. S. Bedford, manuscript submitted for publication. The human DNA-PKcs gene is located on chromosome 8 (31Sipley J. Menninger J. Hartley K. Ward D.C. Jackson S. Anderson C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7515-7519Google Scholar), suggesting that reduced expression or activity of the DNA-PKcs was responsible for the altered DNA-PK activity in the IRS-20 cell extracts. To determine whether this was true, we compared the DNA-bound RPA kinase activities of extracts prepared from the parental cell line 10B2 and the mutant IRS-20 and IRS-20 cells containing human chromosome 8 (IRS-20(Neo8)). We found that the 32-kDa RPA subunit was phosphorylated in the 10B2 but not the IRS-20 kinase reactions (Fig. 2A, compare lanes b and d). RPA kinase activity was also detected in the IRS-20 (Neo8) kinase reactions (Fig. 2A, lane f) and in reactions performed using IRS-20 cell extracts that had been supplemented with purified DNA-PKcs (Fig. 2A, lane h). We have shown previously that the CHO cell line V3 displays a severe reduction in the expression of the DNA-PKcs (6Peterson S.R. Kurimasa A. Oshimura M. Dynan W.S. Bradbury E.M. Chen D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3171-3174Google Scholar). To test whether this was also true for the IRS-20 cells, we measured the levels of both the DNA-PKcs and the Ku70 proteins in the IRS-20 cell extracts by immunoblot analysis using monoclonal antibodies specific for these proteins. Using this assay, we found the amount of DNA-PKcs in the IRS-20 extracts was reduced relative to cell extracts prepared from the parental cell line 10B2 (Fig. 2B, compare lanes a and b). In contrast, we found there was no difference in the abundance of the Ku70 protein when comparing these same cell extracts (Fig. 2B, compare lanes a and b), which is indicative of the status of both the Ku70 and Ku80 proteins (12Taccioli G.E. Gottlieb T.M. Blunt T. Priestly A. Demengeot J. Mizuta R. Lehmann A.R. Alt F.W. Jackson S.P. Jeggo P.A. Science. 1994; 265: 1442-1445Google Scholar, 30Chen F. Peterson S.R. Story M.D. Chen D.J. Mutat. Res. 1995; 362: 9-19Google Scholar). The results of the immunoblot analysis suggested to us that the reduced amount of DNA-PKcs subunit found in the IRS-20 cell extracts could be responsible for the radiosensitive phenotype of these cells. This would be consistent with the defects observed in DNA double-stranded break repair-deficient rodent cells (5Kirchgessner C.U. Patil C.K. Evans J.W. Cuomo C.A. Fried L.M. Carter T. Oettinger M.A. Brown J.M. Science. 1995; 267: 1178-1183Google Scholar, 6Peterson S.R. Kurimasa A. Oshimura M. Dynan W.S. Bradbury E.M. Chen D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3171-3174Google Scholar). However, the level of DNA-PKcs expressed in the IRS-20 cells was much higher than that observed for the CHO V3 cells (Fig. 3A, compare lanes b and d). This indicated to us that in addition to the reduced level of DNA-PKcs expression, the IRS-20 cells might also have defects that affect the assembly of the DNA-PK holoenzyme on DNA or reduce the kinase activity of the enzyme. To test this, we measured the capacity of the DNA-PKcs from the parental 10B2 and the mutant IRS-20 cells to bind to DNA by measuring its retention on linearized DNA covalently linked to agarose beads. Using this assay we found that the amount of DNA-PKcs bound to the DNA-beads was proportional to its abundance in the cell extracts (Fig. 3B, lanes a and b). As a control, we also compared the amount of Ku70 bound to the DNA beads in the same reactions (Fig. 3B, lanes c and d) and found there were no differences between the wild-type 10B2 and IRS-20 mutant cells. Because the DNA-binding experiments showed the capacity of the IRS-20 DNA-PKcs to bind to the DNA-beads was not significantly different than that of the wild-type enzyme, we tested whether the DNA-PKcs expressed in the IRS-20 cells may have diminished kinase activity relative to the wild-type enzyme. Since the absence of detectable kinase activity in the IRS-20 reactions might reflect limitations in the sensitivity of the RPA phosphorylation assay, we measured the RPA kinase activity in a series of reactions prepared using 10B2 cell extract that was diluted with reaction buffer to give DNA-PK levels equivalent to those found in the IRS-20 reactions. Using this approach, we found that the 10B2 cell extracts contain approximately four times more DNA-PKcs bound to the immobilized DNA than the IRS-20 cell extracts (Fig. 3C). By manipulating the amount of DNA-PKcs in the kinase reactions this way, we found we could detect RPA kinase activity in reactions containing the equivalent of 3 μl of 10B2 cell extract (15 μg of total protein) (Fig. 3D, lanes a-c). In contrast, we could not detect any RPA kinase activity in the kinase reaction performed in parallel using 50 μl of IRS-20 cell extract containing 250 μg of total protein (Fig. 3D, lane d). These results indicate that the sensitivity of the RPA kinase assay is sufficient to detect the kinase activity of DNA-PK levels equal to and lower than that found in the IRS-20 extracts and support the idea that the IRS-20 DNA-PKcs has defective kinase activity. The second cell line that was identified in the initial RPA-kinase assay, SX9, was found to have a defect similar to that seen with the IRS-20 cells. RPA kinase activity of cell extracts prepared from the SX9 cells were performed in parallel with extracts prepared from the parental cell line, SR1, and another SR1-derived DNA double-stranded break repair mutant cell line, SX10. Phosphorylation of the 32-kDa RPA subunit was detected in the SR1 and the SX10 cell extracts but was absent in the SX9 cell extract (Fig. 4A). RPA kinase activity of the SX9 extract was not affected by addition of purified human Ku but could be rescued by addition of purified DNA-PKcs (Fig. 4B, compare lanes b and d). This indicated that the lack of DNA-PK activity in these cells was also due to a defect in the expression or activity of the DNA-PKcs. To ascertain whether the decrease in DNA-PK activity in the SX9 cell extracts was due to a defect in the expression of the SX9 DNA-PKcs, we probed protein blots of SR1, SX9, and SX10 cell extracts using DNA-PKcs antibodies. The results of this analysis indicated that abundance of the DNA-PKcs in the SX9 cells was reduced relative to both the wild-type SR1 and the SX10 mutant cells (Fig. 4C). However, much like the results obtained with the IRS-20 cells, we could readily detect the DNA-PKcs in the SX-9 cell extracts. Interestingly, the level of DNA-PKcs expressed in the SX-10 cells was slightly reduced relative to the wild-type cells. To determine if the reduced kinase activity of the SX-9 DNA-PK was due to a defect in the assembly of the enzyme on DNA, we measured the retention of the DNA-PKcs from the SR1, SX-9, and SX-10 cell extracts on DNA-agarose beads. In each case, the level of DNA-PKcs associated with the DNA-beads reflected the relative abundance of the enzyme in whole cell extracts (Fig. 4D). This indicated that the SX9 DNA-PKcs was capable of binding to DNA-agarose beads and suggested that there was no defect in the assembly of the SX9 DNA-PK holoenzyme. Taken together, these results indicate that the SX-9 DNA-PKcs can assemble with Ku to bind to DNA, but has reduced catalytic activity relative to the wild-type enzyme. The modification of proteins by phosphorylation is a common mechanism for regulating a variety of biochemical activities in eukaryotic cells. Mammalian cell lines displaying defects in the expression of either the catalytic or Ku80 components of DNA-PK have defects in rejoining double-stranded DNA breaks. These results have been interpreted to indicate DNA-PK functions by phosphorylating other proteins involved in these DNA strand rejoining pathways. The data presented in this paper support the hypothesis that the protein kinase activity of DNA-PK is an important component of the double-stranded break rejoining pathway by demonstrating that the DNA repair mutant cell lines IRS-20 and SX9 both express inactive forms of the DNA-PK catalytic subunit. In murine scid and CHO V3 cells, transfer of subgenomic fragments of human chromosome 8 containing the human DNA-PKcs gene rescues the DNA-repair and V(D)J defects and restores expression of a functional DNA-PK holoenzyme (4Blunt T. Finnie N.J. Taccioli G.E. Smith G.C.M. Demengeot J. Gottlieb T.M. Mizuta R. Varghese A.J. Alt F.W. Jeggo P.A. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1995; 80: 813-823Google Scholar, 5Kirchgessner C.U. Patil C.K.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3171-3174Google Scholar). Similarly, the radiosensitivity of the IRS-20 cells can also be rescued by human chromosome 8, suggesting that these cells fall into the same genetic complementation group (xrs-7) as the scid and V3 cells (31Sipley J. Menninger J. Hartley K. Ward D.C. Jackson S. Anderson C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7515-7519Google Scholar). Our analysis of the DNA-PK status of the double-stranded break repair mutant SX9 suggests that this cell line is also in the xrs-7 complementation group. Our data, showing that the DNA-PKcs from both IRS-20 and the SX9 cells can bind to DNA but fails to function as a protein, suggests that the IRS-20 and SX-9 cells harbor mutations that disrupt the kinase activity of the DNA-PKcs. This could be mediated via changes in critical residues in the kinase active site or by mutations that disrupt the global structure of the enzyme. Such mutations might affect both the activity of the enzyme as well as its intracellular stability. Interestingly, the levels of DNA-PKcs found in both the IRS-20 and SX9 cells is reduced relative to their parental, wild-type cell lines. This also occurs in both the murine scid and CHO V3 cells where the expression of the DNA-PKcs is severely repressed relative to wild-type levels and there is no apparent DNA-PK activity (4Blunt T. Finnie N.J. Taccioli G.E. Smith G.C.M. Demengeot J. Gottlieb T.M. Mizuta R. Varghese A.J. Alt F.W. Jeggo P.A. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1995; 80: 813-823Google Scholar, 5Kirchgessner C.U. Patil C.K.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3171-3174Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that scid mice contain a mutation in the C terminus of the DNA-PKcs gene corresponding to amino acid position 4045 that results in the introduction of a stop codon (32Blunt T. Gell D. Fox M. Taccioli G.E. Lehmann A.R. Jackson S.P. Jeggo P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10285-10290Google Scholar). This mutation may disrupt the structure of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase domain of DNA-PKcs, thereby inhibiting the kinase activity of the enzyme. Furthermore, it is suggested this mutation may also account for the decreased expression of DNA-PKcs observed in scid cells by reducing the stability of the gene product. Despite the detailed information on how DNA-PK functions in vitro, it is not clear how this enzyme participates in DNA double-stranded break rejoining pathways. Subsequent to the generation of a double-stranded DNA break due to exposure of a cell to a strand-breaking agent or during the course of V(D)J recombination, DNA-PK would likely bind to the ends of the broken DNA, becoming colocalized with components of the strand-rejoining machinery. The phosphorylation of some of these colocalized repair factors might serve to activate some other biochemical activity such as DNA-unwinding or ligation. However, it is also possible that in addition to serving as an activator of repair, DNA-PK could function to stimulate the dissociation of other proteins bound nearby the DNA-ends that prevent accessibility of the repair machinery. In both of these models, the kinase activity of DNA-PK is a key component of the strand-rejoining reaction. A central question in the study of the DNA-repair defects in cells mutated in the Ku or DNA-PKcs genes is how the inactivation of the DNA-PK complex alters the repair process. In both the Ku and DNA-PKcs mutant cells, the overall level of double-stranded DNA break repair is nearly 50% that of the wild-type cells (33Biedermann K.A. Sun J. Giaccia A.J. Tosto L.M. Brown J.M.

This may indicate that DNA-PK-independent repair pathways are capable of rejoining some populations of the double-stranded DNA breaks and that DNA-PK is only required for the repair of the remaining subset of double-stranded breaks (36Dahm-Daphi J. Dikomey E. Pyttlik C. Jeggo P.A. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1993; 64: 19-26Google Scholar). This subset of damaged DNA may require the activity of DNA-PK for strand break rejoining because of the nature of the damaged DNA, the chromosomal location, or chromatin context of the damaged sequence.

The overexpressed fusion protein can be purified in urea-denatured form by metal chelate affinity chromatography. The mixture of renatured HisRecD protein and the RecB and RecC proteins has a high level of ATP-dependent nuclease activity with either single- or double-stranded DNA, enhanced DNA unwinding activity, enhanced ATP hydrolysis activity in the presence of a small DNA oligomer cosubstrate, and χ-cutting activity. These are all characteristics of the RecBCD holoenzyme. The HisRecD protein by itself hydrolyzes ATP in the presence of high concentrations of single-stranded DNA (polydeoxythymidine). The activity is unstable at 37°C, but is measurable at room temperature (about 23°C). The HisRecD has very little ATPase activity in the presence of a much shorter single-stranded DNA (oligodeoxy(thymidine)12). HisRecD hydrolyzes ATP more efficiently than GTP and UTP, and has very little activity with CTP. We also purified a fusion protein containing a Lys to Gln mutation in the putative ATP-binding site of RecD. This mutant protein has no ATPase activity, indicating that the observed ATP hydrolysis activity is intrinsic to the RecD protein itself.

The RecBCD enzyme from Escherichia coli is an important enzyme in the DNA metabolism of the cell, acting in homologous recombination, resistance to UV irradiation and chemical DNA damaging agents, and degradation of foreign DNA (reviewed in Refs. 1Smith G.R.

Dixon D.A. Eggleston A.K. Lauder S.D. Rehrauer W.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 401-465Google Scholar). The enzyme catalyzes several reactions in vitro ATP hydrolysis enables it to unwind double-stranded DNA (4MacKay V. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4286-4294Google Scholar, 5Taylor A. Smith G.R.

Chem. 1971; 246: 6543-6555Google Scholar, 8Goldmark P.J. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 1849-1860Google Scholar). The double-strand nuclease activity of RecBCD is suppressed when it encounters a χ sequence (5′-GCTGGTGG) in the DNA (9Taylor A.F. Smith G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5226-5230Google Scholar, 10Dabert P. Ehrlich S.D. Gruss A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12073-12077Google Scholar, 11Dixon D.A. Kowalczykowski S.C.

Kowalczykowski S.C. Cell. 1993; 73: 87-96Google Scholar) and the unwound DNA is a substrate for recombination catalyzed by the RecA protein (13Dixon D.A. Kowalczykowski S.C.

RecBCD enzyme is also an ATP-stimulated nuclease with single-stranded DNA, and single-stranded DNA stimulates ATP hydrolysis (7Wright M. Buttin G. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 6543-6555Google Scholar, 8Goldmark P.J. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 1849-1860Google Scholar). The first preparations of the RecBCD enzyme were thought to contain only the proteins encoded by the recB and recC genes (8Goldmark P.J. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 1849-1860Google Scholar, 16Oishi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1969; 64: 1292-1299Google Scholar, 17Barbour S.D. Clark A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1977; 252: 499-503Google Scholar). However, one experiment indicated the possible existence of an additional component, essential for enzymatic activity, which could be separated from both the RecB and RecC proteins by treating the enzyme with high salt concentrations (20Lieberman R.P. Oishi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4816-4820Google Scholar). A later study showed that this was a third protein subunit, called RecD, encoded by a gene (recD) adjacent to the recB gene (21Amundsen S.K. Taylor A.F. Chaudhury A.M. Smith G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5558-5562Google Scholar). The function of the RecD subunit in catalysis by RecBCD enzyme is not clear, although it is implicated in several activities of the enzyme. The identification of the RecD subunit was made possible by the fact that it is required for high levels of nuclease activity with single- or double-stranded DNA (21Amundsen S.K. Taylor A.F. Chaudhury A.M. Smith G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5558-5562Google Scholar, 22Chaudhury A.M. Smith G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7850-7854Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence analysis shows that RecD and RecB contain consensus ATP-binding motifs as well as other sequences similar to those in a family of DNA helicases (23Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Donchenko A.P. Blinov V.M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 235: 16-24Google Scholar). A RecBCD enzyme with a mutation in the ATP-binding site of RecB retains single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase activity, which we concluded is catalyzed by the wild-type RecD subunit in that enzyme (24Hsieh S. Julin D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5647-5653Google Scholar). The enzyme with a Lys to Gln mutation in the putative ATP-binding site of the RecD subunit (the RecBCD-K177Q enzyme) retained all the activities for which we tested (ATPase, nuclease, and helicase), although each was reduced in rate and other properties (25Korangy F. Julin D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1733-1740Google Scholar, 26Korangy F. Julin D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3088-3095Google Scholar). The effect of χ sequences on the nuclease activity has led to the proposal that χ causes inactivation of, and perhaps ejection of, the RecD subunit (2Myers R.S. Stahl F.W. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1994; 28: 49-70Google Scholar, 27Thaler D.S. Sampson E. Siddiqi I. Rosenberg S.M. Stahl F.W. Stahl M. Friedberg E. Hanawalt P. Mechanisms and Consequences of DNA Damage Processing. Alan R.

This is consistent with the fact that RecBC is a helicase but lacks significant nuclease activity (31Palas K.M. Kushner S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3447-3454Google Scholar, 32Masterson C.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4873-4880Google Scholar), and that recombination in recD− cells is not affected by χ sequences (22Chaudhury A.M. Smith G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7850-7854Google Scholar). Purification of the RecD protein has been difficult and has led to little insight into its function in the reactions catalyzed by RecBCD. No catalytic activity was found to co-purify with the RecD subunit isolated from the RecBCD holoenzyme (20Lieberman R.P. Oishi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4816-4820Google Scholar, 21Amundsen S.K. Taylor A.F. Chaudhury A.M. Smith G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5558-5562Google Scholar). The RecD protein was overexpressed and purified from inclusion bodies, and the isolated subunit restored nuclease activity and χ-specific cleavage to RecBC, but no activity was found in RecD alone (32Masterson C. Boehmer P.E. McDonald F. Chaudhuri S. Hickson I.D. Emmerson P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13564-13572Google Scholar). The difficulty of obtaining RecD protein in native form led us to prepare RecD fused to an NH2-terminal peptide containing six consecutive histidine residues. The protein (HisRecD) can be purified by metal chelate affinity chromatography in either native or denatured form, and reconstituted with the RecB and RecC proteins to obtain high levels of ATP-dependent nuclease activity, and other activities characteristic of the RecBCD enzyme. The HisRecD protein alone catalyzes ATP hydrolysis in the presence of high concentrations of single-stranded DNA.

Kowalczykowski S.C. Cell. 1993; 73: 87-96Google Scholar) were gifts from Dr. Gerald Smith, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle. 3H-Labeled pTZpB700 plasmid DNA (5001 base pairs, constructed by us for unrelated experiments) was prepared as described (25Korangy F. Julin D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1733-1740Google Scholar). RecBCD enzyme was purified as described (36Korangy F. Julin D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1727-1732Google Scholar), and the concentration was determined from the absorbance at 280 nm, using ϵ280 = 4 × 105M−1 cm−1 (6Roman L.J. Kowalczykowski S.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2863-2873Google Scholar). The RecB and RecC proteins were purified and quantitated, using ϵ280 = 1.7 × 105M−1 cm−1 (RecB), and ϵ280 = 2 × 105M−1 cm−1 (RecC) as described (32Masterson C. Boehmer P.E. McDonald F. Chaudhuri S. Hickson I.D. Emmerson P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13564-13572Google Scholar, 33Korangy F. Julin D.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4873-4880Google Scholar). The concentrations of each enzyme or subunit given under “Results” and in the figure legends are those based on the absorbance readings, unless stated otherwise. However, each enzyme preparation apparently contained some inactive enzyme. The nuclease activity of RecBCD was maximal with about 2 enzyme molecules per DNA end (measured as in Ref. 25Korangy F. Julin D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1733-1740Google Scholar, with 2 and 4 nM ends). Thus the RecBCD enzyme was about 50% active. The rate of ATP hydrolysis by RecBC (prepared by mixing 1 μM RecB and 1 μM RecC) was maximal at about 4 RecBC per DNA end (measured as in Ref. 37Korangy F. Julin D.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9552-9560Google Scholar), indicating that only about 25% of the RecB and/or RecC was active. The His-tagged RecD protein (HisRecD) was expressed using the vector pTrcHisB (Invitrogen Corp.). The recD gene was transferred to the vector as follows. A 712-base pair fragment from the plasmid pPvSm19, which contains the recD gene (36Korangy F. Julin D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1727-1732Google Scholar), was amplified by polymerase chain reaction. The downstream primer annealed across the BspEI site (bold) within the gene (primer number 1: 5′-GGCATCTTCCGGAATG) and the upstream primer annealed at the 5′-end of the gene (primer number 2: 5′-GGAAGATCT). Primer number 2 is partially complementary to the recD gene (underlined) and introduces a BglII site upstream of the gene (bold). The amplified 712-base pair fragment was digested with BspEI and BglII and ligated into pPvSm19 cleaved with the same enzymes (the BglII site in pPvSm19 is within a portion of the recB gene contained in this plasmid). The recD gene was removed from this plasmid by cleavage with BglII and BamHI (BamHI cleaves downstream of the 3′-end of the recD gene in pPvSm19), and ligated into pTrcHisB cleaved with the same enzymes, to produce pHisRecD. The recD fragment is in the correct orientation for expression when the BglII sticky ends are joined to the compatible BamHI ends. The resulting plasmid (pHisRecD, 6.6 kilobase pairs) encodes the RecD protein fused to a 31-amino acid leader peptide (3.4 kDa) containing six consecutive histidine residues. The protein is expressed from a trc promoter and a ribosome-binding site within the vector sequence. The RecD amino acid sequence was altered slightly during the subcloning procedure, since the first two residues in RecD, Met-Lys, are changed to a single Asp in the fusion protein. The 5′ terminus of the fusion gene was sequenced to confirm the structure of the junction between the vector and recD gene sequences. The NH2-terminal leader peptide encoded by the vector also includes a sequence recognized by the protease enterokinase (-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys-). However, we have been unable to cleave the NH2-terminal peptide with enterokinase (Invitrogen Corp.), under a variety of reaction conditions, enterokinase concentrations, incubation times, etc. Consequently we have worked with the fusion protein itself, since it gives high levels of activity despite the additional peptide. The plasmid pPvSm19-DK177Q, encoding a Lys to Gln mutation in the putative ATP-binding site of RecD (36Korangy F. Julin D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1727-1732Google Scholar), was digested with BsmI, and the 442-base pair fragment containing the mutation was ligated into pHisRecD cleaved with the same enzyme. The presence of the mutation in the resulting plasmid, pHisRecD-K177Q, was also confirmed by DNA sequencing. The HisRecD protein was expressed in E. coli strain JM109 (recA− recBCD+) or V186 (ΔrecBCD) transformed with pHisRecD. Cells were grown in 25 ml of LB broth (38Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar) at 37°C. Isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mM) was added when the A650 = 0.4, and growth was continued for 4 h. The cells were harvested and resuspended in either denaturing binding buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.8, 0.5 M NaCl, 6 M guanidinium hydrochloride) or native binding buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.8, 0.5 M NaCl). For the denatured preparation, the resuspended cells were rocked gently for 10 min at room temperature, and then the lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 10 min at 17,000 × g The lysate was applied to a 2-ml nickel-containing column (ProBond resin, Invitrogen Corp.) in denaturing binding buffer. The column was washed in 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, 8 M urea, 0.5 M NaCl, and then the same mixture at pH 5.3. The HisRecD fusion protein was eluted in denaturing elution buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 4.0, 8 M urea, 0.5 M NaCl). Its concentration was determined from the absorbance at 280 nM, using ϵ280 = 48,500 M−1 cm−1, calculated for HisRecD (the NH2-terminal leader peptide contains a single tyrosine residue, and no tryptophans). The typical yield was about 0.5 mg from 25 ml of culture. For preparation under native conditions, lysozyme (0.1 mg/ml) was added to the resuspended cells, followed by incubation for 10 min at 37°C, 5 min on ice, and then the lysate was cleared by centrifugation as above. The lysate was applied to a 2-ml ProBond column which was washed with 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.8, 0.5 M NaCl, then with 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, 0.5 M NaCl, and finally the bound protein was eluted in a gradient of 50-500 mM imidazole in 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, 0.5 M NaCl. The denatured HisRecD protein was renatured by first diluting with denaturing elution buffer to less than 50 μg/ml, and then dialyzing in a collodion membrane (25-kDa cut-off; Schleicher & Schuell) at 4°C against renaturation buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 M NaCl, 20% glycerol). The denatured HisRecD protein was stable when stored at 4°C. However, we have not found conditions under which the renatured HisRecD can be stored without substantial loss of reconstitution activity. Thus, HisRecD was renatured as needed. The reconstitution method used for most experiments was as follows: the renatured HisRecD protein (in renaturation buffer) was mixed with RecC (in RecBCD dilution buffer: 10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM DTT, 0.4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20% glycerol), and placed at room temperature for 4 h. RecB (in RecBCD dilution buffer) was then added and incubation was continued overnight at room temperature. The final reconstitution mixture usually contained 80 nM RecB and RecC and 300 nM HisRecD, in a 1:1 mixture of renaturation buffer and RecBCD dilution buffer. A few reconstitutions were done by adding HisRecD to RecBC and incubating for 2-4 h at room temperature. The reconstituted RecBC(HisRecD) enzyme is relatively stable. The enzyme lost only 20% of its nuclease activity on double-stranded DNA after 2 months at −20°C, in this solution. Native gel electrophoresis was carried out on 5% polyacrylamide gels (30:1, acrylamide:bis-acrylamide) prepared in imidazole/HEPES buffer (43 mM imidazole, 35 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) containing 10 mM MgCl2. The gels were pre-run at 5.5 V/cm for 30 min before protein samples were loaded, and then the samples were run at 3.5 V/cm. The gels were silver-stained with Rapid-Ag-Stain (ICN Biomedicals). The standard reaction conditions we used for these experiments were 43 mM imidazole, 35 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.67 mM DTT, at 37°C, unless indicated otherwise. The reconstituted RecBC(HisRecD) prepared as above was diluted 10-50-fold with a 1:1 mixture of renaturation buffer and RecBCD dilution buffer, and then diluted 10-100-fold further into the reaction mixtures. Thus, the components of the renaturation and reconstitution buffers were also present in the reaction mixtures. The other enzymes used in these experiments (RecBCD holoenzyme, RecBC, and HisRecD alone) were also diluted with the same buffer mixture, so that all enzymes were compared under the same reaction conditions. Nuclease activity was determined by measuring the production of trichloroacetic acid-soluble oligonucleotide fragments (36Korangy F. Julin D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1727-1732Google Scholar), using [3H]pTZpB700 DNA (25 μM nt), linearized by cleavage with PstI. Reactions with double-stranded DNA contained 50 μM ATP, while those with heat-denatured DNA contained 200 μM ATP. Nucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis was measured by thin layer chromatography, as described (25Korangy F. Julin D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1733-1740Google Scholar), using γ- or α-32P-labeled ribonucleoside triphosphate substrate. Polyethyleneimine chromatography plates (J. T. Baker) were developed in 1 M formic acid, 0.5 M LiCl2 for ATPase reactions, or 1 M formic acid, 1 M LiCl2 for CTP, GTP, and UTP. The relative amounts of [γ-32P]ATP and [32P]Pi, or [α-32P]NTP and [α-32P]NDP, on the developed plates were determined using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). DNA unwinding was assayed by the conversion of [3H]pTZpB700 DNA (21 μM nt), linearized with PstI, to a form sensitive to exonuclease I and RecJ exonuclease, as described (37Korangy F. Julin D.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9552-9560Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures contained 200 μM ATP, 10 mM MgCl2, and 8 μM E. coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein. χ-Specific cleavage reactions were done essentially as in Ref. 39Taylor A.F. Smith G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24459-24467Google Scholar using pBR322-χFH (11Dixon D.A. Kowalczykowski S.C. Cell. 1993; 73: 87-96Google Scholar), containing two χ sequences in opposite orientations. The plasmid was cleaved with ClaI, treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphate, and 5′-end-labeled with polynucleotide kinase, and [γ-32P]ATP. Markers for χ-specific cleavage were prepared by cleaving the labeled, ClaI-cut DNA again with AvaI. The χ-cutting reactions contained 20 mM MOPS-KOH, pH 7, 5 mM ATP, 3.5 mM magnesium acetate, 5 μM E. coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein, 1 mM DTT, and ClaI-cut [5′-32P]pBR322-χFH (3.1 nM DNA molecules; 26.7 μM nt), at 37°C. Samples removed from the reaction mixtures were quenched by adding 0.2 volumes of a mixture containing 40% glycerol, 2.5% SDS, 0.1 M EDTA, 0.125% bromphenol blue, and analyzed by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels. The radioactivity in the dried gel was visualized using the PhosphorImager. A protein of the expected size (slightly larger than RecD) was found in lysates of cells transformed with pHisRecD, after induction with isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside. We purified the histidine-tagged RecD protein (HisRecD) under both native and denaturing conditions, following the procedures recommended by Invitrogen Corp. The HisRecD could be highly purified in a single step (Fig. 1; some preparations contained a small amount of an impurity, probably the 21-kDa protein seen previously in His-tagged proteins purified from E. coli (40Hengen P.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 285-286Google Scholar)). The assay for RecD activity was the ability to restore ATP-dependent nuclease activity to RecBC, on linear single- and double-stranded DNA. The nuclease activities with both single- and double-stranded DNA (Fig. 2) are completely dependent on the presence of RecB, RecC, HisRecD protein, and ATP (not shown), as expected for RecBCD enzyme activity (8Goldmark P.J. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 1849-1860Google Scholar, 21Amundsen S.K. Taylor A.F. Chaudhury A.M. Smith G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5558-5562Google Scholar, 32Masterson C. Boehmer P.E. McDonald F. Chaudhuri S. Hickson I.D. Emmerson P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13564-13572Google Scholar). The reconstituted enzyme had a high level of activity in this assay. The activity of the reconstituted enzyme depends on: 1) the efficiency with which the three protein subunits assemble to make RecBC(HisRecD), and 2) the fraction of renatured HisRecD protein which is active. We estimated both quantities by comparing the nuclease activity of the reconstituted enzyme to that of the RecBCD holoenzyme. The nuclease activity on double-stranded DNA with RecBC(HisRecD) prepared by mixing RecB and RecC (2 nM each) with a large excess of HisRecD (45 nM), followed by 10-fold dilution into the assay, was the same as that of about 0.06-0.065 nM RecBCD in the assay (not shown). After accounting for the presence of inactive RecBCD and RecB/C protein (see “Experimental Procedures”), this suggests that about 60-65% of the RecBC could be converted to RecBC(HisRecD): 65% = (0.065/2 nM active RecBCD)/(0.2/4 nM active RecB/C) × 100. The reconstituted enzyme used for the experiment in Fig. 2A was prepared by mixing HisRecD (290 nM) with an excess of RecB and RecC (400 nM each). The activity on double-stranded DNA, with 0.58 nM HisRecD, and 0.8 nM RecB and RecC in the assay mixture, was about the same as that of 0.17 nM RecBCD (Fig. 2A). This suggests that at least (0.17/2)/0.58 ×100 = 15% of the HisRecD is active, or 23%, if only 65% of RecB and RecC assemble to RecBC(HisRecD). (Both calculations assume that the specific activity of 100% reconstituted RecBC(HisRecD) would be the same as that of RecBCD.) The nuclease activity appeared when the proteins were reconstituted at room temperature (about 23°C), but little activity was found if the reconstitution was done on ice, under any conditions. The time required varied somewhat depending on the protein concentrations. Thus, the nuclease activity in a mixture of 3.5 nM RecBC and 45 nM HisRecD required about 2 h before reaching a maximal level. The rate of appearance of activity did not increase significantly if HisRecD was incubated overnight with either RecB or RecC and then the remaining subunit was added, as compared with adding HisRecD to RecBC. This suggests that the slow appearance of the nuclease activity is not due to slow assembly of HisRecD with only one of the other two proteins, since in that case overnight preincubation with that particular subunit would have allowed final assembly of the RecBC(HisRecD) complex to be rapid. (We did notice that slightly greater activity (about 2-fold) was obtained by adding the subunits sequentially (the method given under “Experimental Procedures”) rather than incubating all three subunits together. Thus we used that procedure as the standard way to prepare RecBC(HisRecD) for further experiments.) The HisRecD purified under native conditions had lower activity than the renatured HisRecD, but greater activity was obtained when this HisRecD protein was first dialyzed against renaturation buffer. This protein was also less pure after the affinity chromatography step than was the denatured HisRecD. We also purified HisRecD from V186 cells (ΔrecBCD) and obtained nuclease activity when the protein was added to RecB and RecC, indicating that the presence of the wild-type recBCD genes in JM109 did not affect the HisRecD preparation from those cells. Most further experiments were done with HisRecD purified under denaturing conditions from JM109. We also tested several factors during renaturation for their effects on the yield of active HisRecD. Dialysis against renaturation buffer containing (NH4)2SO4 (0.5 M) worked about as well as NaCl, and both gave greater activity than dialysis against the same concentrations of KCl, NH4Cl, or potassium glutamate. Dialysis to lower the urea concentration in steps (4, 2, 1, 0 M) did not lead to significantly greater yield of activity. There was no effect of including ZnCl2 (0.1 mM; see Ref. 32Masterson C. Boehmer P.E. McDonald F. Chaudhuri S. Hickson I.D. Emmerson P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13564-13572Google Scholar) in the dialysis buffer. Lower activity was observed when: 1) renaturation was done at room temperature rather than 4°C; 2) renaturation buffer contained 0.2 M NaCl rather than 0.5 M NaCl; 3) the renaturation buffer was MOPS, pH 6.5, rather than Tris-HCl, 8.0. The nuclease activities shown above strongly indicate that the HisRecD is bound to RecBC to make a RecBC(HisRecD) complex. We sought to detect the RecBC(HisRecD) complex directly by analyzing mixtures of the proteins on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels (32Masterson C. Boehmer P.E. McDonald F. Chaudhuri S. Hickson I.D. Emmerson P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13564-13572Google Scholar). There was a band present in the mixture of RecB, RecC, and HisRecD (lane 1, Fig. 3) which co-migrates with RecBCD (lane 3) and is presumably RecBC(HisRecD). The renatured HisRecD does not form a clear band (lane 4), indicating that it may not be a single discrete species. The HisRecD protein would also have little charge and thus low mobility in the gel (pH 7.4), since its estimated pI is about 6.8, given its content of charged residues. The RecBC(HisRecD) band was not seen in gels prepared without MgCl2. We believe that Mg2+ mainly stabilizes the reconstituted enzyme in the gel, since the nuclease activ"

https://openalex.org/W2048094226,"Adenophostin A possesses the highest known affinity for the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) receptor (InsP3R). The compound shares with Ins(1,4,5)P3 those structural elements essential for binding to the InsP3R. However, its adenosine 2′-phosphate moiety has no counterpart in the Ins(1,4,5)P3 molecule. To determine whether its unique structure conferred a distinctive biological activity, we characterized the adenophostin-induced Ca2+ signal in Xenopus oocytes using the Ca2+-gated Cl− current assay. In high concentrations, adenophostin A released Ca2+ from Ins(1,4,5)P3-sensitive stores and stimulated a Cl− current that depended upon the presence of extracellular Ca2+. We used this Cl− current as a marker of Ca2+ influx. In low concentrations, however, adenophostin A stimulated Ca2+ influx exclusively. In contrast, Ins(1,4,5)P3 and (2-hydroxyethyl)-α-D-glucopyranoside 2′,3,4-trisphosphate, an adenophostin A mimic lacking most of the adenosine moiety, always released intracellular Ca2+ before causing Ca2+ influx. Ins(1,4,5)P3 could still release Ca2+ during adenophostin A-induced Ca2+ influx, confirming that the Ins(1,4,5)P3-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ stores had not been emptied. Adenophostin- and Ins(1,4,5)P3-induced Ca2+ influx were not additive, suggesting that both agonists stimulated a common Ca2+ entry pathway. Heparin, which blocks binding to the InsP3R, prevented adenophostin-induced Ca2+ influx. These data indicate that adenophostin A can stimulate the influx of Ca2+ across the plasma membrane without inevitably emptying the Ins(1,4,5)P3-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ stores."
https://openalex.org/W2016112962,"We expressed the NH2-terminal domain of the multidomain, multifunctional enzyme, 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (FDH), using a baculovirus expression system in insect cells. Expression of the 203-amino acid NH2-terminal domain (residues 1-203), which is 24-30% identical to a group of glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylases (EC 2.1.2.2), resulted in the appearance of insoluble recombinant protein apparently due to incorrect folding. The longer NH2-terminal recombinant protein (residues 1-310), which shares 32% identity with Escherichia coli L-methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase (EC 2.1.2.9), was expressed as a soluble protein. During expression, this protein was released from cells to the culture medium and was purified from the culture medium by 5-formyltetrahydrofolate-Sepharose affinity chromatography followed by chromatography on a Mono-Q column. We found that the purified NH2-terminal domain bears a folate binding site, possesses 10-formyltetrahydrofolate hydrolase activity, and exists as a monomer. Titration of tryptophan fluorescence showed that native FDH bound both the substrate of the reaction, 10-formyl-5,8-dideazafolate, and the product of the reaction, 5,8-dideazafolate, with the same affinities as its NH2-terminal domain did and that both proteins bound the substrate with a 50-fold higher affinity than the product. Neither the NH2-terminal domain nor its mixture with the previously purified COOH-terminal domain had 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase activity. Formation of complexes between the COOH- and NH2-terminal domains also was not observed. We conclude that the 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase activity of FDH is a result of the action of the aldehyde dehydrogenase catalytic center residing in the COOH-terminal domain on the substrate bound in the NH2-terminal domain and that the intermediate domain is necessary to bring the two functional domains together in the correct orientation.

The amino-terminal sequence (residues 1-203) of the tetrameric multifunctional enzyme, 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (FDH) 1The abbreviations used are: FDH10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenaseGAR-transformylaseglycinamide ribonucleotide transformylaseMFTE. coli L-methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase10-FTHF10-formyltetrahydrofolateTHFtetrahydrofolate10-FDDF10-formyl-5,8-dideazafolateDDF5,8-dideazafolate2-ME2mercaptoethanolPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. (EC 1.5.1.6) is 24-30% identical to glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase (GAR-transformylase) (EC 2.1.2.2) from different species (1Cook R.J. Lloyd R.S. Wagner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4965-4973Google Scholar). There is also a 32% identity (2Cook R.J. Wagner C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 321: 336-344Google Scholar) (residue 1-310) to Escherichia coli L-methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase (MFT) (EC 2.1.2.9) (3Gullion J-M. Mechulam Y. Schmitter J-M. Blanquet S. Fayat G. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4294-4301Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal domain of FDH presumably contains a folate binding site. The sequence HPSLLP (residues 106-111) and a glycine (residue 115) four residues downstream were predicted to be the key motif for the 10-FTHF binding (1Cook R.J. Lloyd R.S. Wagner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4965-4973Google Scholar). This motif is strictly conserved among a large number of enzymes that use 10-FTHF as a formyl donor. No direct evidence has been obtained, however, that this sequence is responsible for folate binding. The structure of a complex between E. coli GAR-transformylase and a multisubstrate adduct, part of which imitates 10-FTHF, was recently resolved (4Klein C. Chen P. Arevalo J.H. Stura E.A. Marolewski A. Warren M.S. Benkovic S.J. Wilson I.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 153-175Google Scholar). It was found that His108 of this conserved motif in GAR-transformylase (which corresponds to His106 of FDH) might participate in folate binding through formation of a hydrogen bond with the oxygen of the formyl group (4Klein C. Chen P. Arevalo J.H. Stura E.A. Marolewski A. Warren M.S. Benkovic S.J. Wilson I.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 153-175Google Scholar). Later experiments based on site-directed mutagenesis led to the conclusion that this histidine is not absolutely required for catalytic function (5Warren M.S. Marolewski A.E. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8855-8862Google Scholar). 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase E. coli L-methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase 10-formyltetrahydrofolate tetrahydrofolate 10-formyl-5,8-dideazafolate 5,8-dideazafolate 2mercaptoethanol polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In the absence of NADP+, FDH hydrolyses 10-FTHF to THF and formate (6Scrutton M.C. Beis I. Biochem. J. 1979; 177: 833-846Google Scholar, 7Rios-Orlandi E.M. Zarkadas C.G. MacKenzie R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 87: 24-35Google Scholar). Presumably, the NH2-terminal domain of FDH is responsible for this hydrolase activity. An enzyme, formyltetrahydrofolate hydrolase, which also catalyzes the hydrolysis of 10-FTHF to THF and formate was recently found in E. coli (8Nagy P.L. McCorkle G.M. Zalkin H. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7066-7073Google Scholar). This enzyme is activated by methionine and inhibited by glycine (9Nagy P.L. Marolewski A. Benkovic S.J. Zalkin H. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1292-1298Google Scholar). It is composed of 280 amino acid residues; the sequence from residues 84 to 280 exhibits 27% identity with GAR-transformylase (8Nagy P.L. McCorkle G.M. Zalkin H. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7066-7073Google Scholar) while the sequence from residues 1 to 84 serves as a regulatory domain, which binds methionine and glycine (8Nagy P.L. McCorkle G.M. Zalkin H. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7066-7073Google Scholar, 9Nagy P.L. Marolewski A. Benkovic S.J. Zalkin H. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1292-1298Google Scholar). The enzyme contains the sequence HHSFLP and a glycine four residues downstream (see Fig. 1) that is similar to the possible 10-FTHF binding motif mentioned above with just two substitutions, proline for histidine and leucine for phenylalanine. Despite their similar catalytic function, identity of the sequence of formyltetrahydrofolate hydrolase (residues 84-280) with the NH2-terminal domain of FDH (residue 1-197) does not exceed 20%, and most of the identity is connected with the putative 10-FTHF binding motif and sequence adjacent to aspartate 142, which was also predicted to participate in the substrate binding (Fig. 1). In addition, FDH has no regulatory domain. Therefore, while the hydrolase can regulate the pools of 10-FTHF and THF in response to the methionine/glycine ratio (9Nagy P.L. Marolewski A. Benkovic S.J. Zalkin H. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1292-1298Google Scholar), such a regulatory role looks unlikely for FDH. Using limited proteolytic digestion of rabbit liver FDH, Schirch et al. have shown that the hydrolase activity of the enzyme is associated with a 32-kDa NH2-terminal domain (10Schirch D. Villar E. Maras B. Barra D. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24728-24735Google Scholar). As a result of studies employing fluorescence and isothermal titration calorimetry, these investigators also reported that the enzyme contains only one folate binding site per tetramer. This differs from an earlier report from our laboratory using covalent addition of folate that found two folates bound per monomer or eight per tetramer (11Wagner C. Briggs W.T. Horne D.W. Cook R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 141-147Google Scholar). Recently, we expressed the COOH-terminal domain of FDH (residues 420-902), which is about 48% identical to a group of aldehyde dehydrogenases (12Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10266-10272Google Scholar). This recombinant peptide was a functional protein displaying aldehyde dehydrogenase activity and bearing an NADP+ binding site. It was perhaps not surprising that the COOH-terminal domain could be folded into a functional protein because of the high homology with aldehyde dehydrogenase and the presence of aldehyde dehydrogenase activity in native FDH. In the case of the NH2-terminal domain, it is difficult to predict whether this domain itself can fold into a functional protein as it has significantly less identity with any natural proteins. Nevertheless, expression and study of protein fragments often provide important information about protein structure and function. Therefore, in the present study, we expressed the NH2-terminal domain of FDH to learn whether this domain is able to fold independently of the other two domains into a functional enzyme having formyltetrahydrofolate hydrolase activity and to investigate its properties. Materials used, protein expression, assay of enzyme activity, fluorescence studies, analysis of kinetic data, and protein molecular size determination are described in the accompanying article (12Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10266-10272Google Scholar). To prepare the construct for expression of the 203-amino acid NH2-terminal protein, the terminal codon, TAG, was introduced into the FDH sequence cloned into the vector, pVL1393, (13Krupenko S.A. Horstman D.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 457-464Google Scholar) immediately after isoleucine 203. The codon, CAG, corresponding to glutamine 204 in the sequence of FDH was changed to a TAG stop codon using the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Two oligonucleotides were used, the mutagenic oligonucleotide 5′-CTATGAGGGCATCAAGAAGGAGA-3′ for introduction of the mutation in the FDH sequence (stop codon is underlined) and a selection oligonucleotide 5′-GAATTCCGGAGCTGCAGATC-3′ for conversion of one unique restriction site, XmaIII, to StuI (underlined), which was also unique, in pVL 1393. To construct the vector for expression of the 310-amino acid residue NH2-terminal domain, we removed the coding sequence between the NheI and ScaI restriction sites (amino acids 311-902) from the vector used for expression of FDH (13Krupenko S.A. Horstman D.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 457-464Google Scholar). This was done in several steps. First, we removed from pVL 1393, with the FDH sequence inserted, one of the two ScaI restriction sites (residing in the ampicillin resistance region) by site-directed mutagenesis. The Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit, mutagenic oligonucleotide 5′-GACTGGTGCAACCAAG-3′ that altered nucleotide T to C (bold) in the ScaI restriction site (former ScaI restriction site is underlined), and the selection oligonucleotide was used in the experiment. The mutated plasmid was cut with NheI restriction endonuclease (that removed the sequence corresponding to amino acid residues 310-504 between the two NheI restriction sites) and was treated for 15 min with Mung bean nuclease (Promega, Madison, WI) to create blunt ends. Then the linear plasmid was cut with ScaI restriction endonuclease (that removed the sequence corresponding to amino acids 505-902) and was ligated through internal blunt ends. The mutagenic experiments were carried out according to the Clontech protocol. The sequence of the constructs was confirmed by sequencing on model 373A fluorescence sequenator (Applied Biosystems). All buffers used in purification steps contained 10 mM 2-ME and 1 mM NaN3. FDH was purified as described earlier (13Krupenko S.A. Horstman D.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 457-464Google Scholar). The 310-amino acid NH2-terminal domain was purified from the cell-free culture medium by affinity chromatography on a column of 5-formyltetrahydrofolate-Sepharose (14Cook R.J. Wagner C. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4427-4434Google Scholar, 15Cook R.J. Wagner C. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 122: 251-255Google Scholar). A column (1.5 × 10 cm) was packed with about 8.0 ml of settled gel and equilibrated with 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4 (buffer 1). Medium (200 ml), plus 2-ME (10 mM) and NaN3 (1 mM) was applied to the affinity column. The column was then washed with buffer 1 (100 ml). The enzyme was eluted from the column with buffer 1 containing 1 M NaCl. The eluate was passed through a column of Bio-Gel P6-DG (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with buffer 1 to remove salt. The eluate was concentrated to approximately 5 ml using an Amicon, Inc. (Beverly, MA) filtration cell. Additional purification was done on a Mono-Q column with a linear NaCl gradient (0-1.0 M in buffer 1) using an FPLC system (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Piscataway, NJ). Two different length peptides were expressed, one containing the first 203 amino acids from the NH2 terminus and the other containing the first 310 amino acids. The expressed 203-amino acid length protein was present only in the cells but not in the medium even in the very late postinfection period (data not shown). This is unlike the results obtained when recombinant FDH (13Krupenko S.A. Horstman D.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 457-464Google Scholar) and its COOH-terminal domain were expressed (12Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10266-10272Google Scholar) where most of the enzyme was found in the medium. Attempts to purify the protein from the cells showed that the expressed 203-amino acid length NH2-terminal peptide was insoluble and was not purified or characterized. In contrast, the recombinant NH2-terminal 310-amino acid polypeptide was found to be present in both cells and culture medium (Fig. 2), similar to the full-length enzyme (13Krupenko S.A. Horstman D.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 457-464Google Scholar) and its COOH-terminal domain (12Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10266-10272Google Scholar). To purify this protein, we used affinity chromatography on a 5-formyltetrahydrofolate-Sepharose column. This procedure was effective for isolation of the 310-amino acid NH2-terminal domain from both the cell lysate (data not shown) and the culture medium (Fig. 3). The recombinant protein was bound by the affinity column and retained during washing with low salt buffer. The protein was completely eluted from the column by 1.0 M NaCl. Additional elution with 20 mM folate revealed only trace amounts of the protein. Further purification was done by chromatography on a Mono-Q column (Fig. 3). The peak containing the NH2-terminal domain was eluted at 0.27 M NaCl, pooled, and stored at 4°C.Fig. 3SDS-PAGE of NH2-terminal domain at different purification steps. Shown are culture medium, lane 1; preparation after affinity chromatography on a 5-formyltetrahydrofolate-Sepharose column, lane 2; preparation after affinity chromatography and chromatography on Mono-Q column, lane 3; and protein standards as in Fig. 2, lane St About 5 μg of total protein was loaded per lane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Initial studies showed that the 310-amino acid NH2-terminal domain was able to hydrolyze both 10-FTHF and 10-FDDF. For further study on this protein, we used the dideaza analog, which is much more stable and has been shown to replace the natural substrate in enzymatic reactions carried by FDH (16Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 651-655Google Scholar). Kinetic parameters of the reaction for the NH2-terminal domain were similar to those for the native enzyme with Km values of 7.3 and 5.8 μM and Vmax values of 99 and 80 nmol min−1 mg−1 (kcat of 3.5 and 8.0 min−1/protein monomer), respectively. Addition of NADP+ did not change the velocity of the hydrolase reaction, and no increase in absorbance at 340 nm was observed showing no reduction of NADP+ to NADPH. This showed that the NH2-terminal domain does not possess dehydrogenase activity. To check whether the NH2-terminal domain has a binding site for the coenzyme, we titrated the quenching of tryptophan fluorescence with NADP+. No changes in fluorescence of the NH2-terminal domain were observed in the presence of NADP+ (data not shown). In contrast, fluorescence of the full-length enzyme (17Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 519-522Google Scholar) and its COOH-terminal domain (12Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10266-10272Google Scholar) was decreased 25-30% in the presence of NADP+. It has been shown that the hydrolase reaction performed by FDH is dependent on the presence of 2-ME (2Cook R.J. Wagner C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 321: 336-344Google Scholar, 16Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 651-655Google Scholar). To study whether the NH2-terminal domain requires the presence of 2-ME, we measured the velocity of the reaction in the presence of varying concentrations of 2-ME. It was observed that the reaction is strictly dependent on the presence of 2-ME (Fig. 4). Moreover, the reaction requires relatively high concentrations of 2-ME as the velocity was still going up at 100 mM of 2-ME (Fig. 4). The pH-dependence of the hydrolase reaction was measured for both FDH and its NH2-terminal domain. This was carried out using two buffer systems, potassium phosphate (pH 4.5-9.0) and acetate (pH 3.0-5.0). No difference in the activity was found between the two buffer systems in the overlapping pH range. The pH dependence of the hydrolase reaction was similar for both FDH and its 310-amino acid NH2-terminal domain with a very broad reaction maximum (Fig. 5). We used titration of tryptophan fluorescence to investigate differences in ligand binding between FDH and the 310-amino acid NH2-terminal domain. The fact that the hydrolase reaction does not proceed in the absence of 2-ME and the dehydrogenase reaction requires the presence of NADP+ allowed us to specifically measure ligand binding in the absence of both compounds since no reaction can take place. This was done with the substrate 10-FDDF and the reaction product DDF. The tryptophan fluorescence of both FDH and the NH2-terminal domain was decreased by about 50% when either 10-FDDF or DDF was bound (data not shown). The affinity for the substrate was 50-fold higher than the affinity for the product (Fig. 6) with dissociation constants of 6 and 300 nM, respectively. No significant difference in the affinity between FDH and NH2-terminal domain was observed (Fig. 6). We also studied the influence of 2-ME on the binding of 10-FDDF and DDF to the proteins. Because the Kd for 10-FDDF is about three orders of magnitude less than the Km in the hydrolase reaction, the addition of 2-ME did not evoke substrate decomposition in the concentration range studied, and we were able to measure binding in the presence of 2-ME. We did not see any differences in affinity of FDH and the NH2-terminal domain for either 10-FDDF or DDF in the presence of 2-ME (data not shown). We investigated the oligomeric structure of the NH2-terminal domains using size-exclusion chromatography on a Sephacryl S-300 column. For this purpose, medium after expression of the NH2-terminal domain and without any preceding purification steps was applied to a Sephacryl S-300 column, and hydrolase activity was measured. Fig. 7 shows that maximum hydrolase activity coincided with a protein of about 35 kDa. SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis of the eluted fractions have also confirmed that the NH2-terminal domain was eluted in a position coinciding with a protein of about 35 kDa molecular mass (Fig. 7), corresponding to the protein monomer. To determine whether the COOH- and NH2-terminal domains together can combine to produce 10-FTHF dehydrogenase activity, we measured the activity in the presence of both proteins. No 10-FTHF dehydrogenase activity was found when the two domains were mixed. To investigate whether the two domains can interact in the absence of the intermediate domain, we expressed both the COOH- and NH2-terminal domains together. SDS-PAGE analysis of the culture medium showed that both recombinant proteins were expressed (data not shown). The medium was applied to a Sephacryl S-300 column, and all three FDH enzyme activities were assayed in collected fractions. Aldehyde dehydrogenase activity was found in fractions corresponding to a tetramer of the COOH-terminal domain, and 10-FTHF hydrolase activity was observed in fractions corresponding to the NH2-terminal domain monomer (data not shown). No 10-FTHF dehydrogenase activity was found in any of the collected fractions nor did any fraction contain both aldehyde dehydrogenase and hydrolase activities together. SDS-PAGE analysis confirmed that the COOH- and NH2-terminal domains resided in different fractions. These experiments prove that COOH- and NH2-terminal domains do not interact in the absence of the intermediate domain. FDH consists of an NH2-terminal domain, an intermediate domain, and a COOH-terminal domain (1Cook R.J. Lloyd R.S. Wagner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4965-4973Google Scholar). We have recently expressed the COOH-terminal domain which has 48% identity with aldehyde dehydrogenase (12Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10266-10272Google Scholar) and showed that this domain bears an NADP+ binding site and a dehydrogenase catalytic center but has no folate binding site. The intermediate domain is not believed to be directly involved in catalysis but serves to bring the functional COOH- and NH2-terminal domains together in the correct orientation. Earlier, we reported that mutation of cysteine 707 of FDH, which is located in the COOH-terminal domain and thought to be the dehydrogenase catalytic center nucleophile, to alanine abolished the dehydrogenase activity, but the hydrolase activity remained (17Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 519-522Google Scholar). Based upon this information, we predicted that 10-FTHF hydrolase activity resides in the NH2-terminal domain while 10-FTHF dehydrogenase activity is a result of the action of the aldehyde dehydrogenase catalytic site on the folate substrate bound to the NH2-terminal domain. We expressed two NH2-terminal peptides, one contained 203 amino acids that corresponds to the length of GAR-transformylase and the other contained 310 amino acids that corresponds to the length of MFT from E. coli MFT shares higher identity with the NH2-terminal domain of FDH than GAR-transformylase does, 32 (Fig. 8) and 27%, respectively. It also has a sequence similar to the putative 10-FTHF binding motif. There is only one conservative change, that of a proline to a glycine (Fig. 8). MFTs from several other species have proline in this position, confirming conservation of the sequence. FDH and MFT also have a higher identity in this region than FDH and GAR-transformylase (Fig. 8). We were surprised to find that the expressed 203 amino acid residue NH2-terminal domain was completely insoluble. The sequence does not contain regions that are highly hydrophobic, and it is not a membrane protein. This suggested that the protein was not folded appropriately. In contrast, the expressed 310-amino acid NH2-terminal protein was soluble and possessed properties that were inherent in the entire enzyme; it contained a folate binding site and displayed 10-FDDF hydrolase activity, suggesting it was folded appropriately. This extends the putative NH2-terminal domain to about 310 amino acid residues rather than the 203 residues derived by comparison with GAR-transformylase. The folate binding parameters and kinetics of the hydrolase reaction were similar for both the NH2 terminus and the complete enzyme. The reaction had the same pH dependence and had a strict requirement for 2-ME. Using the quenching of tryptophan fluorescence, we found that the NH2-terminal domain does not have an NADP+ binding site. The NH2-terminal domain exists as a monomer, unlike the E. coli formyltetrahydrofolte hydrolase enzyme, with the same catalytic function that exists as a hexamer (9Nagy P.L. Marolewski A. Benkovic S.J. Zalkin H. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1292-1298Google Scholar). Although our results showed that the folate binding site is present in the NH2-terminal domain and previously we also showed that the COOH-terminal domain of FDH has no folate binding site (12Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10266-10272Google Scholar), the possibility could not be excluded that another folate binding site might be formed from the participation of the two functional domains. However, results obtained after fluorescence titration using DDF or 10-FDDF revealed that there is no difference in substrate binding between FDH and its NH2-terminal domain. This supports the conclusion that only the NH2-terminal domain is involved in substrate binding while the COOH-terminal domain has neither a folate binding site nor participates in formation of such a site together with the other domains. The formyl group of the folate substrate bound to its binding site in the NH2-terminal domain must be accessible to the dehydrogenase catalytic center, and this leads to the conclusion that this group must protrude above the surface of the NH2-terminal domain or at least be close to the surface. This assumes that the pteroyl moiety plays the main role in the interactions of the substrate with the FDH folate binding site. This suggestion is consistent with data obtained from the crystal structure of GAR-transformylase complexed with 5-deazatetrahydrofolate that showed that the pterin part of the folate is well ordered deep in the hydrophobic cleft between the NH2- and COOH-terminal domains of the enzyme, the benzoyl ring is less ordered, and glutamate moiety is at the enzyme surface and is disordered (18Almassy R.J. Janson C.A. Kan C.-C. Hostomska Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6114-6118Google Scholar). Both FDH (16Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 651-655Google Scholar) and GAR-transformylase (19Smith G.K. Mueller W.T. Benkovic P.A. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1241-1245Google Scholar) can utilize 10-FDDF instead of 10-FTHF as a formyl donor, suggesting structural similarity between the folate-binding sites of the two enzymes. 10-FDDF binds to FDH and its NH2-terminal domain 50-fold more tightly than DDF, probably because of some enhancement of binding by the formyl group. Calculation of the difference between free energies for binding substrate, 10-FDDF, and product, DDF, gives a difference in ΔG of 2.3 kcal/mol. This corresponds to a hydrogen bond energy that is in the range of 2-5 kcal/mol (20Atkins W.M. Sligar S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18842-18849Google Scholar) and suggests that the formyl group of the folate substrate forms a hydrogen bond with the protein in the active site. Either hydrogen or oxygen of the formyl group could be a candidate for bond formation. The resolved crystal structure of GAR-transformylase (4Klein C. Chen P. Arevalo J.H. Stura E.A. Marolewski A. Warren M.S. Benkovic S.J. Wilson I.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 153-175Google Scholar) showed that such a hydrogen bond can be formed with His108 or Asp144 of GAR-transformylase (corresponding to His106 and Asp142 for FDH), which are strictly conserved in proteins using 10-FTHF as a formyl donor (1Cook R.J. Lloyd R.S. Wagner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4965-4973Google Scholar). Possible reasons for such hydrogen bonding of the formyl group in the catalytic mechanism of FDH could be to limit the flexibility of the group, to create stress in the structure of the substrate, and to facilitate the nucleophilic attack and intermediate hemiacetal complex formation during the dehydrogenase/hydrolase reaction (2Cook R.J. Wagner C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 321: 336-344Google Scholar). One discrepancy with previous reports was found from the measurement of ligand binding. Previous studies reported (21Min H. Shane B. Stokstad E.L.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 967: 348-353Google Scholar) that the product of the reaction catalyzed by FDH, THF, binds more tightly to the enzyme than the substrate, 10-formyl-THF, while we show here that the substrate was bound with 50 times higher affinity than was the product of the reactions. The previous study, however, did not measure the binding constant for the substrate, probably due to the instability of the natural substrate, 10-FTHF, and because of the hydrolase reaction that converts 10-FTHF to THF and formate. In the present study, we avoided these problems by using the stable substrate analogue, 10-FDDF, and performed the analysis in the absence of 2-ME so that the hydrolase reaction did not proceed. The data obtained concerning the domain structure of FDH suggests the following topography for the native protein (Fig. 9). The COOH-terminal domain of the enzyme has sites responsible for the protein oligomerization and bears the NADP+ binding site and the aldehyde dehydrogenase active site, which acts as a catalytic center in the dehydrogenase reaction utilizing 10-FTHF when bound to the adjacent NH2-terminal domain. The NH2-terminal domain can now be extended to about the first 310 amino acid residues and bears a folate binding site and the hydrolase catalytic center. The intermediate domain (which now is shortened to about a hundred amino acid residues) is necessary to bring the two functional domains together to carry out the 10-FTHF dehydrogenase reaction. The two functional domains apparently do not form multiple and close contacts to each other. That was shown by the absence of interdomain complexes, and only the presence of the intermediate domain brings them into the correct orientation. We would like to mention that the intermediate domain (residues 313-403) is enriched with negatively charged amino acid residues, glutamic acid (17.6 versus 6.5% for combined NH2- and COOH-terminal domains) and aspartic acid (8.8 versus 4.7% for NH2 and COOH-terminal domains). Thus, we suggest that electrostatic interactions provided by the intermediate domain could be major contributors to the orientation of the NH2- and COOH-terminal domains in native FDH. Additionally, the fact that the two functional domains not only can function separately but also can be folded separately to produce functional proteins supports the idea that FDH has evolved from a fusion of two different genes, one of which codes for aldehyde dehydrogenase while the other is not yet identified. Our study still leaves open the question of whether the intermediate domain of FDH functions merely as a bridge that brings the two enzymatic domains together to create a new enzyme function or whether it also plays a regulatory role to modulate activity in response to changes in physiological conditions."

DNA was subjected to 1) cleavage by methylation-sensitive restriction endonucleases, 2) hydrazine modification of cytosines followed by piperidine cleavage, and 3) permanganate modification of 5-methylcytosines (mC) followed by piperidine cleavage. The permanganate reaction is a novel method for direct detection of mC residues that complements the more commonly used hydrazine method. These methods were capable of detecting mC in 2% of the cells. At the region of the proposed DMI, only one mC at a CpG site was detected.

The permanganate reaction is a novel method for direct detection of mC residues that complements the more commonly used hydrazine method. These methods were capable of detecting mC in 2% of the cells. At the region of the proposed DMI, only one mC at a CpG site was detected. However, the ori-β DMI was not detected in any of these cell populations using any of these methods. DNA methylation at CpG dinucleotides in mammalian cells has been implicated as an important component of such pivotal processes as transcription (1Martienssen R.A. Richards E.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 234-242Google Scholar), imprinting (2Riggs A. Pfeifer G.P. Trends Genet. 1992; 8: 169-174Google Scholar), recombination (3Hsieh C.-L. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 315-325Google Scholar), carcinogenesis (4Counts J.L. Goodman J.I. Cell. 1995; 83: 13-15Google Scholar), development (5Li E. Bestor T.H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 69: 915-926Google Scholar), and replication timing (6Lin M.S. Zhang A. Fujimoto A. Hum. Genet. 1995; 96: 572-576Google Scholar). CpG methylation is carried out by a methyltransferase that is associated with replication foci in the nucleus (7Leonhardt H. Page A.W. Weier H.-U. Bestor T.H. Cell. 1992; 71: 865-873Google Scholar). In general, this enzyme methylates specifically hemimethylated CpG dinucleotides, although de novo methylation of unmethylated CpG dinucleotides can occur but at a low rate (8Pfeifer G.P. Steigerwald S.D. Hansen R.S. Gartler S.M. Riggs A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8252-8256Google Scholar). In addition, this enzyme occasionally methylates cytosines in sequences other than CpG (9Hubrich-Kühner K. Buhk H.-J. Wagner H. Kröger H. Simon D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 160: 1175-1182Google Scholar, 10Woodcock D.M. Crowther P.J. Diver W.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 145: 888-894Google Scholar). However, given the specificity of the mammalian methyltransferase, this non-target methylation should be of little significance in vivo because the pattern of non-CpG methylation will not be maintained during the subsequent round of DNA replication. Recently, an unusual form of DNA methylation has been implicated as an important component of mammalian origins of DNA replication. A densely methylated island (DMI) 1The abbreviations used are: DMIdensely methylated islandbpbase pair(s)CHOChinese hamster ovaryDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumPBSphosphate-buffered salineFACSfluorescence-activated cell sorterOBRorigin of bidirectional replicationkbkilobaseLM-PCRligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction. has been reported at three different mammalian origins of DNA replication (11Tasheva E.S. Roufa D. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1995; 19: 369-383Google Scholar, 12Tasheva E.S. Roufa D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5636-5644Google Scholar). These DMIs were found only in proliferating cell populations and consisted of a 127-, 258-, or 516-bp stretch of DNA in which all cytosines were methylated, regardless of their sequence context (12Tasheva E.S. Roufa D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5636-5644Google Scholar). The discovery of DMIs has several important implications. First, this unprecedented methylation pattern suggested that a second (or modified) methylation enzyme exists in mammalian cells. Interestingly, limited proteolysis of the mammalian DNA methyltransferase stimulates its ability to methylate unmethylated CpG dinucleotides de novo (13Bestor T.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2611-2618Google Scholar, 14Adams R.L.P. Burdon R.H. McKinnon K. Rinaldi A. FEBS Lett. 1983; 163: 194-198Google Scholar). Second, the rapid loss of DMIs when cells stop proliferating implies an active demethylation process. In fact, repair enzymes might be involved in active demethylation (15Jost J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4684-4688Google Scholar, 16Razin A. Szyf M. Kafri T. Roll M. Giloh H. Scarpa S. Carotti D. Cantoni G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2827-2831Google Scholar). Third, the characteristics of DMIs strongly suggest a role in initiation of DNA replication. For example, since the 16 known mammalian origins (17DePamphilis M.L. DePamphilis M.L. DNA Replication in Eukaryotic Cells. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 45-86Google Scholar) lack a common extensive sequence homology, a DMI may mark initiation sites for DNA replication. Alternatively, DMIs might provide a means to recognize origins that have already replicated. Remethylation at the 11 dam methylation sites at Escherichia coli's ori-C is delayed about 10 min, during which time the hemimethylated ori-C is bound to the outer bacterial membrane in a form that cannot reinitiate replication (18Slater S. Wold S. Lu M. Boye E. Skarstad K. Kleckner N. Cell. 1995; 82: 927-936Google Scholar, 19Brendler T. Abeles A. Austin S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4083-4089Google Scholar). The DMI might play an analogous role in mammalian cells where nuclear structure is required for site-specific initiation of DNA replication (20Gilbert D.M. Miyazawa H. Nallaseth F.S. Ortega J.M. Blow J.J. DePamphilis M.L. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; 58: 475-485Google Scholar, 21Gilbert D.M. Miyazawa H. DePamphilis M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2942-2954Google Scholar). In fact, site specificity is established during the middle of G1 phase in each cell cycle (22Wu J.-R. Gilbert D. Science. 1996; 271: 1270-1272Google Scholar), about the time when DNA methyltransferase activity appears and then increases during S phase (23Szyf M. Bozovic V. Tanigawa G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10027-10030Google Scholar, 24Vogel M.C. Papdopoulos T. Müller-Hermelink H.K. Drahovsky D. Pfeifer G.P. FEBS Lett. 1988; 236: 9-13Google Scholar, 25Adams R.L.P. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 309-320Google Scholar). Therefore, it was imperative to confirm the existence of a DMI at a well characterized mammalian replication origin and to determine whether or not a DMI appears at a specific time during the cell division cycle. densely methylated island base pair(s) Chinese hamster ovary Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium phosphate-buffered saline fluorescence-activated cell sorter origin of bidirectional replication kilobase ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction. The DMIs described above were identified using the bisulfite method to detect 5-methylcytosine (mC). Bisulfite catalyzes the hydrolytic deamination of cytosines, but not mC, to uracils (26Shapiro R. DiFate V. Welcher M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1974; 96: 906-912Google Scholar, 27Wang R.Y.-H. Gehrke C. Ehrlich M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 4777-4790Google Scholar, 28Frommer M. McDonald L.E. Millar D.S. Collis C.M. Watt F. Grigg G.W. Molloy P.L. Paul C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1827-1831Google Scholar). However, this method suffers from the fact that conversion of cytosines to uracils requires that DNA be in a single strand state (29Feil R. Charlton J. Bird A.P. Walter J. Reik W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 695-696Google Scholar, 30Clark S.J. Harrison J. Paul C.L. Frommer M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2990-2997Google Scholar). Thus, failure to properly denature the genomic DNA or partial renaturation during the bisulfite treatment can lead to persistence of cytosines that will be interpreted erroneously as the presence of mC (31Rein T. Zorbas H. DePamphilis M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 416-426Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated cytosine methylation by three alternative and independent methods. The first method used methylation-sensitive restriction endonucleases to identify specific sites that are methylated and, therefore, resistant to cleavage. Cleavage was monitored by direct visualization of the DNA products using Southern blotting and hybridization. Alternatively, uncleaved genomic DNA was quantitated by PCR amplification. Southern blotting and hybridization imposes the fewest DNA manipulations and provides a direct estimate of the fraction of cells containing a DMI, whereas PCR monitoring allows the detection of very small DMI fractions. However, digestion by restriction endonucleases detects only a subset of potential methylation sites. The second method is able to detect mC at any nucleotide position by modifying DNA with hydrazine and then cleaving the modified cytosines with piperidine. Although hydrazine, like bisulfite, reacts with cytosines, but not with mC (32Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Google Scholar), hydrazine modification is independent of the strandedness of the DNA. However, because mC is identified by the absence of a band in the cytosine sequence of genomic DNA that is present in the cytosine sequence of cloned DNA (i.e. “negative display” of mC), background cleavage events or closely spaced bands may lead to ambiguity. This problem was overcome by a third method. Permanganate at slightly acidic pH can modify thymines and mC but not cytosines (33Fritzsche E. Hayatsu H. Igloi G.L. Iida S. Kössel H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5517-5528Google Scholar). Piperidine then cleaves DNA at these sites (“positive display” of mC). Permanganate reactivity requires that the DNA be single stranded, but in contrast to bisulfite, the strandedness of the DNA can be monitored by the concomitant reaction of thymines, which also takes place only in single-stranded DNA. To our knowledge, the permanganate/piperidine method for detection of mC has never before been applied to complex genomes. Therefore, conditions for the permanganate reaction were optimized for this purpose, and the method is presented here as a valuable tool for investigation of DNA methylation in complex genomes. Using the methods described above, cytosine methylation was investigated at the DMI locus at ori-β, an origin of bidirectional replication located 17 kb downstream of the dhfr gene in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (17DePamphilis M.L. DePamphilis M.L. DNA Replication in Eukaryotic Cells. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 45-86Google Scholar). Methylation was examined in randomly proliferating and stationary CHO K1 cells containing two copies of the dhfr gene region per diploid genome and in CHO C400 cells containing ∼1000 tandem copies of this region. CHO K1 cells were also isolated in the G1, S or G2+ M phases of their proliferation cycle. In no case was the DMI detected, although the sensitivity of the methods allowed detection of mC in 2% of the total DNA. CHO were propagated after 1:20 dilution of a confluent starting culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), supplemented with 0.4 mML-glutamine and 5 (CHO K1) or 10% (CHO C400) fetal calf serum, at 37°C in 5% CO2. Proliferating cells were harvested when they reached ∼50% confluency (about day 3). To obtain stationary cells (G0), cells at about 30% confluency were washed with PBS and cultured for another 5 days in DMEM + 0.4 mML-glutamine + 0.5% fetal calf serum (12Tasheva E.S. Roufa D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5636-5644Google Scholar). Further culturing of cells at low serum, to increase the portion of G0, resulted in slow cell death without change of the FACS profile (data not shown). For harvesting, cells were washed with PBS and trypsinized. Trypsin digestion was stopped by adding DMEM + 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4°C and resuspended in PBS on ice. The profile of the cell cycle was checked before and after harvesting by FACS analysis (see below). Cells were used for elutriation or immediately for DNA isolation. Centrifugal elutriation was carried out on 1.2 × 108 proliferating growing CHO K1 cells in 5 ml of PBS using a Beckman rotor (JE-5.0) and centrifuge (model J-6M/E) at 2,500 rpm. The flow rate was gradually increased until cells reached the upper region in the chamber. 7-8 fractions were taken at increasing flow rates. The cells were kept on ice, and an aliquot (∼1 × 105 cells) of each fraction was used for FACS analysis. DNA was prepared from the remaining cells. Prior to harvesting, adherent cells in one 75-cm2 flask were rinsed once with DMEM lacking serum and stained as described (34Fried J. Perez A.G. Clarkson B.D. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1978; 26: 921-933Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, 5 ml of sterile cold staining solution (4 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.0, 5 μg/ml propidium iodide, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 10 μg/ml freshly added RNase A) were added to the cells and then placed at 4°C for 45 min in the dark. Residual adhering cells were dislodged by pipeting. After harvesting or elutriation, the cells were rinsed in PBS, centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C, resuspended in the above staining solution, and held at 4°C for 45 min in the dark. The cell suspensions (∼1 × 106 cells/ml) were analyzed by flow cytometry (Epics XL/MCL 4 Color Coulter). Between 5,000 and 20,000 fluorescent events were counted. The FACS profile of cells treated by this method was stable for at least 2 weeks. Cells at (∼5 × 106 per ml in PBS) were mixed with an equal volume of lysis buffer (1% sarcosyl, 75 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 25 mM EDTA), and 100 μg/ml proteinase K was added to the suspension. Cells were lysed by incubation at 50°C overnight. The solution was extracted twice with TE-equilibrated phenol and once with chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1). RNase A was added to 100 μg/ml, incubated for 3 h at 37°C, and dialyzed extensively against TE buffer for 2 days. Genomic DNA was concentrated under vacuum to 0.1 of the previous volume and dialyzed once more against 0.1 × TE buffer. After this step, DNA had a final concentration of 0.1 μg/μl. Cleavage of genomic DNA with AluI and MboII was performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer. An unrelated ∼100-bp DNA fragment containing an AluI site, radioactively labeled at one 5′-end, was added to the AluI digests of genomic DNA. Completeness of AluI cleavage was monitored by autoradiography after an aliquot of the AluI digestion was subjected to gel electrophoresis. Only the genomic DNA from reactions in which the labeled fragment was completely cleaved was used for Southern blotting (below). A second control for completion of both enzymatic digestions was performed by monitoring the average length of DNA after gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. In order not to obscure the subsequent Southern blot analysis, the radioactive phosphate was removed from the end-labeled fragment by treatment with calf intestine phosphatase. Digested genomic DNA was phenol-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and dissolved in TE at 1 μg/μl. For Southern blot analysis, equal amounts of AluI- or MboII-cleaved genomic DNA of logarithmically growing or stationary CHO cells were run in parallel with radioactively end-labeled DNA molecular weight markers on a 2.5% BIOZYM “small DNA” agarose gel in TBE buffer. Ten micrograms of CHO K1 DNA and 1 μg of CHO C400 DNA were used. After electrophoresis, the DNA was denatured by soaking the gel in 0.2 M NaOH, 5 mM EDTA for 40 min. The gel was neutralized with 0.5 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, and equilibrated in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5. The DNA was electrophoretically transferred onto a nylon Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Corp.) in a Bio-Rad Mini-PROTEAN II blotting chamber in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, at 250 mA and 30 V overnight. Complete transfer was verified by comparing the autoradiographs of the labeled DNA marker in the gel and on the membrane prior to hybridization. The transferred DNA was fixed by placing the membrane on Whatman paper soaked in 0.4 M NaOH for 20 min and baking it for 2 h at 80°C. This treatment ensures complete retention of DNA on the membrane during hybridization, as verified by autoradiography of the labeled DNA marker prior to and after hybridization. Genomic DNA was hybridized with end-labeled primers 6C and 6E in Church buffer (32Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Google Scholar) supplemented with 250 μg/ml yeast RNA at 50°C overnight and washed as described (32Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Google Scholar). Hybridization signals were visualized by autoradiography. Proliferating and serum-arrested CHO K1 cells were grown as described above. Cells grown to early-, mid-, or late-G1 were harvested at 40, 120, or 195 min, respectively, after re-plating cells obtained by mitotic selection (21Gilbert D.M. Miyazawa H. DePamphilis M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2942-2954Google Scholar). Progression into S phase, which occurred at approximately 4 h after replating, was monitored by incorporation of [3H]thymidine into parallel cultures (21Gilbert D.M. Miyazawa H. DePamphilis M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2942-2954Google Scholar). At the indicated time, cells were washed free of medium using cold (4°C) PBS, released by trypsinization, and counted using a hemacytometer. The cells were collected by centrifugation and placed on ice. After the pellet was rinsed in cold hypotonic buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 5 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2), the cells were swelled at 5 × 106 cells/ml in hypotonic buffer on ice for 5 min. The cells were again collected by centrifugation and resuspended in hypotonic buffer to give a total concentration of 2.5 × 104 cells per μl. The cell suspension was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. Nuclei were isolated from the frozen cell suspension by addition of 1 ml of cold hypotonic buffer (at this point, all the cells are lysed, leaving nuclei and cellular debris), followed by centrifugation for 3 min at high speed in an Eppendorf centrifuge. The pellet was resuspended to 1 × 105 nuclei/μl in DNA isolation buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS), supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml RNase A, and incubated at 37°C for 3 h. The reaction was then supplemented with 1 mg/ml proteinase K and continued for 3 h. DNA was purified by organic extraction and precipitated with ethanol. After centrifugation, the pellet was air-dried and resuspended to >600 μg/ml in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. DNA fragments averaged 20 to 25 kb in length. DNA (500 μg/ml) was digested with XbaI according to the manufacturer's directions to reduce viscosity. XbaI released a 4.5-kb fragment that contained ori-β and the proposed DMI near its center. XbaI-digested genomic DNA (2 μg) was digested for 4 h at the appropriate temperature with 10 units of AccI, AluI, Alw26I or MslI using buffers provided by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs, Boehringer Mannheim). Spermidine (1 mM) was included in AccI digestions. These conditions represent a 15-25-fold “over-digestion” with respect to incubation time and units of enzyme. Restriction digestion of PCR-generated fully cytosine-methylated fragments was performed using 8 units of enzyme, 85 ng of DNA, and 6 h incubation time (50-350-fold over-digestion). PCR reactions were carried out in 20 μl using 100 ng of template DNA, 10 pmol of primer T (AGA CAA ATG TCA GCA TGA AGG CAG G), 10 pmol of primer L (TCT CCA GCA CCA TGT CTG CCT GTG G), 0.5 units Takara ExTaq polymerase (Oncor-Appligene), and buffer supplied by the manufacturer. Thirty cycles consisted of 45 s each of 95, 63, and 72°C. The size of the expected product is 418 bp. A DNA fragment of ∼100 bp encompassing an MspI/HpaII site was radioactively labeled at one 5′-end by standard methods. CpG sites of an aliquot were methylated by the bacterial SssI methylase (New England Biolabs). Methylated and unmethylated fragments were cleaved with MspI (New England Biolabs) or HpaII (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Hydrazine/piperidine treatment of methylated and unmethylated fragments was performed as described (35Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Google Scholar). KMnO4/piperidine treatment was as described (33Fritzsche E. Hayatsu H. Igloi G.L. Iida S. Kössel H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5517-5528Google Scholar) with the modification that the pH of the sodium acetate buffer was lowered to 4.1. The products of all cleavage reactions were analyzed on a sequencing gel. A ∼790-bp fragment of the DNA region around the proposed DMI was synthesized by PCR on a cloned DNA template by using primer 1D (Table I) and a second primer 5′-ATA ATA AAA AAA CTA GTT TTG AGT CAT TTT ATG G-3′ (positions 3475-3442) and either dCTP or methyl-dCTP at a final nucleoside triphosphate concentration of 200 μM. The PCR product was purified from a low melting point agarose gel by isotachophoresis (36Öfverstedt L.G. Hammarström K. Balgobin N. Hjerten S. Pettersson U. Chattopadhaya J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 782: 120-126Google Scholar). Hydrazine/piperidine or KMnO4/piperidine treatment of fully methylated and fully unmethylated fragments was performed as described above. Guanine cleavage was as described (35Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Google Scholar).

Genomic DNA was cut with PstI to reduce its viscosity before treatment with hydrazine/piperidine. Ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction (LM-PCR) was carried out as described previously (38Garrity P.A. Wold B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1021-1025Google Scholar) and modified (39Rein T. Schreck R. Willenbrink W. Neubert W. Zorbas H. Baeuerle P. J. Inflamm. 1995; 45: 269-282Google Scholar, 40Rein T. Müller M. Zorbas H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3033-3037Google Scholar). Conditions for base-specific modification of genomic DNA by permanganate in vitro followed by piperidine-catalyzed cleavage have been described previously (33Fritzsche E. Hayatsu H. Igloi G.L. Iida S. Kössel H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5517-5528Google Scholar) and were modified as follows. High molecular weight DNA was cut with PstI to reduce its viscosity, phenol-extracted, and ethanol-precipitated. A 50-μl sample containing 50 μg of genomic DNA in TE buffer was heated to 90°C for 2 min and immediately placed on ice. 200 μl of 30 mM NaOAc, pH 4.1, was added at room temperature (22°C), before adding 50 μl of freshly prepared 6 mM KMnO4. The sample was incubated for 3 min at room temperature and terminated by adding 20 μl of β-mercaptoethanol. DNA was precipitated in 0.3 M NaOAc, pH 5.0, and 2.5 volumes of ethanol, dissolved in TE buffer, and precipitated again. The sample was dissolved in 100 μl of 10% piperidine, incubated for 30 min at 90°C, and then quenched at 0°C. Piperidine was removed by vacuum centrifugation overnight, and the DNA was analyzed by LM-PCR (cf above). A densely methylated island (DMI) was reported to overlap with the minimal origin of bidirectional replication (OBR) ori-β located about 17 kb downstream of the dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) gene in hamster CHO K1 cells (Ref. 12Tasheva E.S. Roufa D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5636-5644Google Scholar; see Fig. 1). This DMI exhibited four critical features: (a) all cytosines of both strands in a region of 516 bp were methylated, irrespective of dinucleotide composition; (b) both borders were well defined; (c) at least 86% of CHO K1 cells of an asynchronous, proliferating culture displayed this unusual methylation pattern; (d) serum-deprived, stationary cells lost their DMI, but regained it after resuming growth. In an effort to confirm these results, the methylation state of the putative ori-β DMI was investigated using a method that required the fewest manipulations of genomic DNA. DNA was digested with a restriction endonuclease, AluI, that recognizes and cleaves AGCT, a non-CpG site, but is inhibited when the cytosine in either strand is methylated (41McClelland M. Nelson M. Raschke E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3640-3659Google Scholar). DNA products were then analyzed by Southern blotting and hybridization. AluI has three recognition sites within the DMI region (Fig. 2C). A methylation-insensitive restriction endonuclease, MboII, was used to determine the general accessibility of DNA to restriction enzymes (41McClelland M. Nelson M. Raschke E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3640-3659Google Scholar). MboII has two recognition sites with the sequence GAAGA·TCTTC in the DMI (Fig. 2C). Inhibition of AluI cleavage due to methylation of the recognition sequence and insensitivity of MboII was confirmed by digestion of a PCR fragment spanning the DMI region, which was synthesized in the presence of either dCTP or 5mdCTP (“Materials and Methods”; data not shown). DNA from CHO K1 cells containing a single copy of the dhfr locus per haploid genome and from CHO C400 cells, which have amplified this locus about 500 times (42Heintz N.H. Hamlin J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4083-4087Google Scholar), were examined. DNA was extracted from exponentially growing and from serum-deprived, stationary cells, assumed to be in G0 phase. Cell cycle was examined by FACS analysis (Fig. 2A). Proliferating cells displayed on average a G1:S:(G2+ M) ratio of about 2.5:1.7:1, respectively. After 5 days of serum deprivation, the peak reflecting the G0 phase was about 80-85% of the total population. Complete digestion of genomic DNA with AluI was monitored by the concomitant cleavage of a short, radioactively labeled fragment containing a unique AluI site, which was included in the cleavage reaction. Genomic DNA on the membrane was hybridized with two radioactive primers located at adjacent sites at the center of the DMI. As shown in Fig. 2B, lanes 4 and 7, cleavage"
https://openalex.org/W2008254546,"A negative, regulatory DNA element from the mouse cellular retinoic acid-binding protein I gene promoter was identified. This DNA element, located approximately 1 kilobase upstream from the transcription initiation site of this gene, contained a pair of direct repeats (DRs) separated by 4 base pairs (DR4, TTGG). By examining a series of reporters deleted or mutated within this DR4 region, it was concluded that the core sequence of this DR4, including both repeats and the spacer, was required for suppressive activity in the mouse embryonal carcinoma cell line P19. From gel retardation experiments, it was concluded that both repeated sequences were essential for specific protein binding, but the spacer sequence was not as critical. Specific residues required for protein binding to this DR4 were identified. In P19 cells, retinoic acid induced the binding of nuclear factors to DR4 and suppressed the activities of the reporters containing this DR4. Co-expression of retinoic acid receptor β or thyroid hormone receptor β1 (T3Rβ1) significantly inhibited the expression of this reporter in P19 cells. Gel retardation with in vitro-synthesized nuclear receptors demonstrated specific binding of this DR4 by T3Rβ1 monomers, homodimers, or heterodimers of T3Rβ1/retinoid receptor X β. A biological function of DR4 in crabp-I gene regulation in P19 cells was suggested.
