https://openalex.org/W2568463955,"Cognitive training interventions are a promising approach to mitigate cognitive deficits common in aging and, ultimately, to improve functioning in older adults. Baseline neural factors, such as properties of brain networks, may predict training outcomes and can be used to improve the effectiveness of interventions. Here, we investigated the relationship between baseline brain network modularity, a measure of the segregation of brain sub-networks, and training-related gains in cognition in older adults. We found that older adults with more segregated brain sub-networks (i.e., more modular networks) at baseline exhibited greater training improvements in the ability to synthesize complex information. Further, the relationship between modularity and training-related gains was more pronounced in sub-networks mediating ""associative"" functions compared with those involved in sensory-motor processing. These results suggest that assessments of brain networks can be used as a biomarker to guide the implementation of cognitive interventions and improve outcomes across individuals. More broadly, these findings also suggest that properties of brain networks may capture individual differences in learning and neuroplasticity. Trail Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT#00977418."
https://openalex.org/W2565611518,"Traditional drug development for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is costly, time consuming and burdened by a very low success rate. An alternative strategy is drug repositioning, redirecting existing drugs for another disease. The large amount of biological data accumulated to date warrants a comprehensive investigation to better understand AD pathogenesis and facilitate the process of anti-AD drug repositioning. Hence, we generated a list of anti-AD protein targets by analyzing the most recent publically available 'omics' data, including genomics, epigenomics, proteomics and metabolomics data. The information related to AD pathogenesis was obtained from the OMIM and PubMed databases. Drug-target data was extracted from the DrugBank and Therapeutic Target Database. We generated a list of 524 AD-related proteins, 18 of which are targets for 75 existing drugs-novel candidates for repurposing as anti-AD treatments. We developed a ranking algorithm to prioritize the anti-AD targets, which revealed CD33 and MIF as the strongest candidates with seven existing drugs. We also found 7 drugs inhibiting a known anti-AD target (acetylcholinesterase) that may be repurposed for treating the cognitive symptoms of AD. The CAD protein and 8 proteins implicated by two 'omics' approaches (ABCA7, APOE, BIN1, PICALM, CELF1, INPP5D, SPON1, and SOD3) might also be promising targets for anti-AD drug development. Our systematic 'omics' mining suggested drugs with novel anti-AD indications, including drugs modulating the immune system or reducing neuroinflammation that are particularly promising for AD intervention. Furthermore, the list of 524 AD-related proteins could be useful not only as potential anti-AD targets but also considered for AD biomarker development."
https://openalex.org/W2568636341,"An impressive breadth of interdisciplinary research suggests that emotions have an influence on human behavior. Nonetheless, we still know very little about the emotional states of those actors whose daily decisions have a lasting impact on our societies: politicians in parliament. We address this question by making use of methods of natural language processing and a digitized corpus of text data spanning a century of parliamentary debates in the United Kingdom. We use this approach to examine changes in aggregate levels of emotional polarity in the British parliament, and to test a hypothesis about the emotional response of politicians to economic recessions. Our findings suggest that, contrary to popular belief, the mood of politicians has become more positive during the past decades, and that variations in emotional polarity can be predicted by the state of the national economy."
https://openalex.org/W2570873958,"Heterotrimeric G proteins are intracellular membrane-attached signal transducers involved in various cellular processes in both plants and animals. They consist of three subunits denoted as α, β and γ. The γ-subunits of the so-called AGG3 type, which comprise a transmembrane domain, are exclusively found in plants. In model species, these proteins have been shown to participate in the control of plant height, branching and seed size and could therefore impact the harvestable yield of various crop plants. Whether AGG3-type γ-subunits influence yield in temperate cereals like barley and wheat remains unknown. Using a transgenic complementation approach, we show here that the Scottish malting barley cultivar (cv.) Golden Promise carries a loss-of-function mutation in HvDep1, an AGG3-type subunit encoding gene that positively regulates culm elongation and seed size in barley. Somewhat intriguingly, agronomic field data collected over a 12-year period reveals that the HvDep1 loss-of-function mutation in cv. Golden Promise has the potential to confer either a significant increase or decrease in harvestable yield depending on the environment. Our results confirm the role of AGG3-type subunit-encoding genes in shaping plant architecture, but interestingly also indicate that the impact HvDep1 has on yield in barley is both genotypically and environmentally sensitive. This may explain why widespread exploitation of variation in AGG3-type subunit-encoding genes has not occurred in temperate cereals while in rice the DEP1 locus is widely exploited to improve harvestable yield."
https://openalex.org/W2569528214,"Background Data on characteristics, outcomes, and prognosis of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who develop pneumonitis during systemic anti-cancer therapy (pneumonitis) are currently lacking. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 910 consecutive patients diagnosed with advanced NSCLC between January 2004 and January 2014. Of these, 140 patients were excluded because they did not receive systemic anti-cancer therapy at this hospital. Results A total of 770 patients were included in the study, of whom 44 (6%) were diagnosed with pneumonitis. The mortality rate of pneumonitis was 36%. The incidence of pneumonitis was independently associated with pre-existing ILD (adjusted odds ratio, 2.99, P = 0.008), and survivors were significantly associated with younger age (P = 0.003) and radiographic non-acute interstitial pneumonia pattern (P = 0.004). In all patients, pneumonitis was identified as an independent predictor of overall survival (OS) (adjusted hazard ratio 1.53, 95% CI, 1.09–2.09, P = 0.015). Performance status was poor in 82% of survivors of pneumonitis; in 62% of survivors, the PS worsened after the pneumonitis improved. Additionally, 54% of survivors received no further systemic anti-cancer therapy after pneumonitis. The median survival time of survivors after pneumonitis was 3.5 months (95% CI, 2.3–7.2 months). Conclusions Our study indicated that 6% of patients with advanced NSCLC developed pneumonitis during systemic anti-cancer therapy. The early mortality rate of pneumonitis is high, and the survival and PS after pneumonitis is extremely poor. Additionally, pneumonitis has an adverse impact on the survival of patients with advanced NSCLC. These data should be considered for the management of pneumonitis, and we recommend that future work focuses on pneumonitis particularly to improve the survival of patients with advanced NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W2570138886,"Knowledge on large-scale biological processes in the southern Red Sea is relatively limited, primarily due to the scarce in situ, and satellite-derived chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) datasets. During summer, adverse atmospheric conditions in the southern Red Sea (haze and clouds) have long severely limited the retrieval of satellite ocean colour observations. Recently, a new merged ocean colour product developed by the European Space Agency (ESA)-the Ocean Color Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI)-has substantially improved the southern Red Sea coverage of Chl-a, allowing the discovery of unexpected intense summer blooms. Here we provide the first detailed description of their spatiotemporal distribution and report the mechanisms regulating them. During summer, the monsoon-driven wind reversal modifies the circulation dynamics at the Bab-el-Mandeb strait, leading to a subsurface influx of colder, fresher, nutrient-rich water from the Indian Ocean. Using satellite observations, model simulation outputs, and in situ datasets, we track the pathway of this intrusion into the extensive shallow areas and coral reef complexes along the basin's shores. We also provide statistical evidence that the subsurface intrusion plays a key role in the development of the southern Red Sea phytoplankton blooms."
https://openalex.org/W2568580287,"Unexplained infertility requires that more sensitive and mechanism-based biomarkers should be developed and used independently of or in addition to conventional semen parameters for an infertility diagnosis. In the present study, semen samples were collected from young men participating in the Male Reproductive Health in Chongqing College students (MARCHS) cohort study in the follow-up stage in 2014. Conventional semen parameters were measured in all 656 participants, whereas sperm mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNAcn), mtDNA integrity and apoptotic parameters were measured among 627, 386, 362, and 628 participants, respectively. We found that sperm MMP was significantly positively correlated with all of conventional semen parameters including semen volume (r = 0.090, p = 0.025), sperm concentration (r = 0.301, p<0.01), total sperm count (r = 0.324, p<0.01), and progressive motility (r = 0.399, p<0.01); sperm MMP was also negatively correlated with Annexin V+ sperm (r = -0.553, p<0.01); mtDNAcn was significantly negatively correlated with sperm concentration (r = -0.214, p<0.01), total sperm count (r = -0.232, p<0.01), and progressive motility (r = -0.164, p = 0.01); mtDNA integrity was also significantly positively correlated with sperm concentration (r = 0.195, p<0.01), total sperm count (r = 0.185, p<0.01), and progressive motility (r = 0.106, p = 0.043). After adjusting for potential confounders, these relationships remained significant. Furthermore, we explored the potential effects of lifestyles on such mitochondrial biomarkers and found that the current drinkers displayed a higher level of sperm MMP; additionally, mt DNAcn was increased with age. The results indicated that certain mitochondrial biomarkers could serve as predictors of semen quality in a general population, and the study provides a baseline for the effects of population characteristics and lifestyles on such mitochondrial markers."
https://openalex.org/W2568917218,"For animals living in temperate latitudes, seasonal changes in day length are an important cue for adaptations of their physiology and behavior to the altered environmental conditions. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is known as the central circadian clock in mammals, but may also play an important role in adaptations to different photoperiods. The SCN receives direct light input from the retina and is able to encode day-length by approximating the waveform of the electrical activity rhythm to the duration of daylight. Changing the overall waveform requires a reorganization of the neuronal network within the SCN with a change in the degree of synchrony between the neurons; however, the underlying mechanisms are yet unknown. In the present study we used PER2::LUC bioluminescence imaging in cultured SCN slices to characterize network dynamics on the single-cell level and we aimed to provide evidence for a role of modulations in coupling strength in the photoperiodic-induced phase dispersal. Exposure to long photoperiod (LP) induced a larger distribution of peak times of the single-cell PER2::LUC rhythms in the anterior SCN, compared to short photoperiod. Interestingly, the cycle-to-cycle variability in single-cell period of PER2::LUC rhythms is also higher in the anterior SCN in LP, and is positively correlated with peak time dispersal. Applying a new, impartial community detection method on the time series data of the PER2::LUC rhythm revealed two clusters of cells with a specific spatial distribution, which we define as dorsolateral and ventromedial SCN. Post hoc analysis of rhythm characteristics of these clusters showed larger cycle-to-cycle single-cell period variability in the dorsolateral compared to the ventromedial cluster in the anterior SCN. We conclude that a change in coupling strength within the SCN network is a plausible explanation to the observed changes in single-cell period variability, which can contribute to the photoperiod-induced phase distribution."
https://openalex.org/W2561898058,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is widespread in adults and children. Early exposure to maternal obesity or Western-style diet (WD) increases steatosis and oxidative stress in fetal liver and is associated with lifetime disease risk in the offspring. Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) is a natural antioxidant found in soil, enriched in human breast milk, and essential for development in mammals. We investigated whether a supplemental dose of PQQ, provided prenatally in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity during pregnancy, could protect obese offspring from progression of NAFLD. PQQ treatment given pre- and postnatally in WD-fed offspring had no effect on weight gain but increased metabolic flexibility while reducing body fat and liver lipids, compared with untreated obese offspring. Indices of NAFLD, including hepatic ceramide levels, oxidative stress, and expression of proinflammatory genes (Nos2, Nlrp3, Il6, and Ptgs2), were decreased in WD PQQ-fed mice, concomitant with increased expression of fatty acid oxidation genes and decreased Pparg expression. Notably, these changes persisted even after PQQ withdrawal at weaning. Our results suggest that supplementation with PQQ, particularly during pregnancy and lactation, protects offspring from WD-induced developmental programming of hepatic lipotoxicity and may help slow the advancing epidemic of NAFLD in the next generation.-Jonscher, K. R., Stewart, M. S., Alfonso-Garcia, A., DeFelice, B. C., Wang, X. X., Luo, Y., Levi, M., Heerwagen, M. J. R., Janssen, R. C., de la Houssaye, B. A., Wiitala, E., Florey, G., Jonscher, R.

https://openalex.org/W2562747823,"Purpose Severity scores including the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score are used in intensive care units (ICUs) to assess disease severity, predict mortality and in research. We aimed to assess the predictive performance of SAPS II and the initial SOFA score for in-hospital and 90-day mortality in a contemporary international cohort. Methods This was a post-hoc study of the Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis in the Intensive Care Unit (SUP-ICU) inception cohort study, which included acutely ill adults from ICUs across 11 countries (n = 1034). We compared the discrimination of SAPS II and initial SOFA scores, compared the discrimination of SAPS II in our cohort with the original cohort, assessed the calibration of SAPS II customised to our cohort, and compared the discrimination for 90-day mortality vs. in-hospital mortality for both scores. Discrimination was evaluated using areas under the receiver operating characteristics curves (AUROC). Calibration was evaluated using Hosmer-Lemeshow’s goodness-of-fit Ĉ-statistic. Results AUROC for in-hospital mortality was 0.80 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77–0.83) for SAPS II and 0.73 (95% CI 0.69–0.76) for initial SOFA score (P<0.001 for the comparison). Calibration of the customised SAPS II for predicting in-hospital mortality was adequate (P = 0.60). Discrimination of SAPS II was reduced compared with the original SAPS II validation sample (AUROC 0.80 vs. 0.86; P = 0.001). AUROC for 90-day mortality was 0.79 (95% CI 0.76–0.82; P = 0.74 for comparison with in-hospital mortality) for SAPS II and 0.71 (95% CI 0.68–0.75; P = 0.66 for comparison with in-hospital mortality) for the initial SOFA score. Conclusions The predictive performance of SAPS II was similar for in-hospital and 90-day mortality and superior to that of the initial SOFA score, but SAPS II’s performance has decreased over time. Use of a contemporary severity score with improved predictive performance may be of value."
https://openalex.org/W2561629726,"The diversity of eukaryote organisms and viruses associated with wild bees remains poorly characterized in contrast to the well-documented pathosphere of the western honey bee, Apis mellifera. Using a deliberate RNA shotgun metagenomic sequencing strategy in combination with a dedicated bioinformatics workflow, we identified the (micro-)organisms and viruses associated with two bumble bee hosts, Bombus terrestris and Bombus pascuorum, and two solitary bee hosts, Osmia cornuta and Andrena vaga. Ion Torrent semiconductor sequencing generated approximately 3.8 million high quality reads. The most significant eukaryote associations were two protozoan, Apicystis bombi and Crithidia bombi, and one nematode parasite Sphaerularia bombi in bumble bees. The trypanosome protozoan C. bombi was also found in the solitary bee O. cornuta. Next to the identification of three honey bee viruses Black queen cell virus, Sacbrood virus and Varroa destructor virus-1 and four plant viruses, we describe two novel RNA viruses Scaldis River bee virus (SRBV) and Ganda bee virus (GABV) based on their partial genomic sequences. The novel viruses belong to the class of negative-sense RNA viruses, SRBV is related to the order Mononegavirales whereas GABV is related to the family Bunyaviridae. The potential biological role of both viruses in bees is discussed in the context of recent advances in the field of arthropod viruses. Further, fragmentary sequence evidence for other undescribed viruses is presented, among which a nudivirus in O. cornuta and an unclassified virus related to Chronic bee paralysis virus in B. terrestris. Our findings extend the current knowledge of wild bee parasites in general and addsto the growing evidence of unexplored arthropod viruses in valuable insects."
https://openalex.org/W2562026415,"We have previously reported that transient receptor potential vanilloid 2 (TRPV2) can be activated by mechanical stimulation, which enhances axonal outgrowth in developing neurons; however, the molecular mechanisms that govern the contribution of TRPV2 activation to axonal outgrowth remain unclear. In the present study, we examined this mechanism by using PC12 cells as a neuronal model. Overexpression of TRPV2 enhanced axonal outgrowth in a mechanical stimulus-dependent manner. Accumulation of TRPV2 at the cell surface was 4-fold greater in the growth cone compared with the soma. In the growth cone, TRPV2 is not static, but dynamically accumulates (within ∼100 ms) to the site of mechanical stimulation. The dynamic and acute clustering of TRPV2 can enhance very weak mechanical stimuli via focal accumulation of TRPV2. Focal application of mechanical stimuli dramatically increased growth cone motility and caused actin reorganization via activation of TRPV2. We also found that TRPV2 physically interacts with actin and that changes in the actin cytoskeleton are required for its activation. Here, we demonstrated for the first time to our knowledge that TRPV2 clustering is induced by mechanical stimulation generated by axonal outgrowth and that TRPV2 activation is triggered by actin rearrangements that result from mechanical stimulation. Moreover, TRPV2 activation enhances growth cone motility and actin accumulation to promote axonal outgrowth. Sugio, S., Nagasawa, M., Kojima, I., Ishizaki, Y., Shibasaki, K. Transient receptor potential vanilloid 2 activation by focal mechanical stimulation requires interaction with the actin cytoskeleton and enhances growth cone motility."
https://openalex.org/W2569844056,"Antifouling biocides such as organotin compounds and their alternatives are potent toxicants in marine ecosystems. In this study, we employed several molecular and biochemical response systems of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas to understand a potential mode of action of antifouling biocides (i.e. tributyltin (TBT), diuron and irgarol) after exposure to different concentrations (0.01, 0.1, and 1 μg L-1) for 96 h. As a result, all the three antifouling biocides strongly induced the antioxidant defense system. TBT reduced both enzymatic activity and mRNA expression of Na+/K+-ATPase and acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Lower levels of both Na+/K+-ATPase activity and AChE mRNA expression were observed in the diuron-exposed oysters compared to the control, while the irgarol treatment reduced only the transcriptional expression of AChE gene. We also analyzed transcript profile of heat shock protein (Hsp) superfamily in same experimental conditions. All antifouling biocides tested in this study significantly modulated mRNA expression of Hsp superfamily with strong induction of Hsp70 family. Taken together, overall results indicate that representative organotin TBT and alternatives have potential hazardous effects on the gill of C. gigas within relatively short time period. Our results also suggest that analyzing a series of molecular and biochemical parameters can be a way of understanding and uncovering the mode of action of emerging antifouling biocides. In particular, it was revealed that Pacific oysters have different sensitivities depend on the antifouling biocides."

However, mechanistic details regarding how nucleic acids or polyP modulate the individual reactions of the contact pathway have been lacking. In this study, we investigate the ability of RNA homopolymers and polyP to bind the primary constituents of the contact pathway: factor XIa, factor XIIa, and plasma kallikrein, in the presence and absence of high molecular weight kininogen (HK), an important cofactor in this pathway. We examine seven proteolytic activation reactions within the contact pathway and report that polyP greatly enhances the rate of all seven, while RNA is effective in supporting only a subset of these reactions. HK both enhances and suppresses these proteolytic activation reactions, depending on the specific reaction evaluated. Overall, we find that polyP is a potent mediator of contact pathway activation reactions in general, that RNA secondary structure may be important to its procoagulant activity, and that nucleic acids versus polyP may differentially modulate specific enzyme activation events within the contact pathway.

The emergence of drug resistance in Candida albicans has become a noteworthy phenomenon due to the extensive use of antifungal agents and the development of biofilms. This study showed that budesonide potentiates the antifungal effect of fluconazole against fluconazole-resistant Candida albicans strains both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, our results demonstrated, for the first time, that the combination of fluconazole and budesonide can reverse the resistance of Candida albicans by inhibiting the function of drug transporters, reducing the formation of biofilms, promoting apoptosis and inhibiting the activity of extracellular phospholipases. This is the first study implicating the effects and mechanisms of budesonide against Candida albicans alone or in combination with fluconazole, which may ultimately lead to the identification of new potential antifungal targets."
https://openalex.org/W2570129843,"A variety of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer disease (AD), are associated with neurofibrillary tangles composed of the tau protein, as well as toxic tau oligomers. Inhibitors of pathological tau aggregation, interrupting tau self-assembly, might be useful for the development of therapeutics. Employing mirror image phage display with a large peptide library (over 109 different peptides), we have identified tau fibril binding peptides consisting of d-enantiomeric amino acids. d-enantiomeric peptides are extremely protease stable and not or less immunogenic than l-peptides, and the suitability of d-peptides for in vivo applications have already been demonstrated. Phage display selections were performed using fibrils of the d-enantiomeric hexapeptide VQIVYK, representing residues 306 to 311 of the tau protein, as a target. VQIVYK has been demonstrated to be important for fibril formation of the full lengths protein and forms fibrils by itself. Here, we report on d-enantiomeric peptides, which bind to VQIVYK, tau isoforms like tau3RD (K19) as well as to full lengths tau fibrils, and modulate the aggregation of the respective tau form. The peptides are able to penetrate cells and might be interesting for therapeutic and diagnostic applications in AD research."
https://openalex.org/W2566555863,"Haemophilus parasuis is classified mainly through serotyping, but traditional serotyping always yields non-typable (NT) strains and unreliable results via cross-reactions. Here, we surveyed the serotype prevalence of Chinese H. parasuis isolates using traditional serotyping (gel immuno-diffusion test, GID) and molecular serotyping (multiplex PCR, mPCR). We also investigated why discrepant results between these methods were obtained, and investigated mPCR failure through whole-genome sequencing. Of the 100 isolate tested, 73 (73%) and 93 (93%) were serotyped by the GID test and mPCR, respectively, with a concordance rate of 66% (66/100). Additionally, mPCR reduced the number of NT isolates from 27 (27%) for the GID testing, to seven (7%). Eleven isolates were sequenced, including nine serotype-discrepant isolates from mPCR and GID typing (excluding strains that were NT by GID only) and two NT isolates from both methods, and their in silico serotypes were obtained from genome sequencing based on their capsule loci. The mPCR results were supported by the in silico serotyping of the seven serotype-discrepant isolates. The discrepant results and NT isolates determined by mPCR were attributed to deletions and unknown sequences in the serotype-specific region of each capsule locus. Compared with previous investigations, this study found a similar predominant serotype profile, but a different prevalence frequency for H. parasuis, and the five most prevalent serotypes or strain groups were serotypes 5, 4, NT, 7 and 13 for mPCR, and serotypes 5, NT, 4, 7 and 13/10/14 for GID. Additionally, serotype 7 was recognized as a principal serotype in this work."
https://openalex.org/W2564264270,"Endogenous fatty acid metabolism that results in elongation and desaturation lipid products is thought to play a role in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In this study, we evaluated the potential of estimated elongase and desaturase activities for use as predictive markers for T2DM remission after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). The results of a targeted metabolomics approach from 2 independent studies were used to calculate 24 serum FA concentration ratios (product/precursor). Gene expression data from an open public data set was also analyzed. In a longitudinal study of 38 obese diabetic patients with RYGB, we found higher baseline stearic acid/palmitic acid (S/P) ratio. This ratio reflects an elovl6-encoded elongase enzyme activity that has been found to be associated with greater possibility for diabetes remission after RYGB [odds ratio, 2.16 (95% CI 1.10–4.26)], after adjustment for age, gender, body mass index, diabetes duration, glycosylated hemoglobin A1c, and fasting C-peptide. Our results were validated by examination of postsurgical elovl6 gene expression in morbidly obese patients. The association of S/P with the metabolic status of obese individuals was further validated in a cross-sectional cohort of 381 participants. In summary, higher baseline S/P was associated with greater probability of diabetes remission after RYGB and may serve as a diagnostic marker in preoperative patient assessment. —Zhao, L., Ni, Y., Yu, H., Zhang, P., Zhao, A., Bao, Y., Liu, J., Chen, T., Xie, G., Panee, J., Chen, W., Rajani, C., Wei, R., Su, M., Jia, W., Jia, W.

https://openalex.org/W2570727457,"Streamflow and water temperature (hydroclimate) influence the life histories of aquatic biota. The relationship between streamflow and temperature varies with climate, hydrogeomorphic setting, and season. Life histories of native fishes reflect, in part, their adaptation to regional hydroclimate (flow and water temperature), local habitats, and natural disturbance regimes, all of which may be affected by water management. Alterations to natural hydroclimates, such as those caused by river regulation or climate change, can modify the suitability and variety of in-stream habitat for fishes throughout the year. Here, we present the ichthyograph, a new empirically-based graphical tool to help visualize relationships between hydroclimate and fish phenology. Generally, this graphical tool can be used to display a variety of phenotypic traits. We used long-term data sets of daily fish passage to examine linkages between hydroclimate and the expression of life-history phenology by native fishes. The ichthyograph may be used to characterize the environmental phenology for fishes across multiple spatio-temporal domains. We illustrate the ichthyograph in two applications to visualize: 1) river use for the community of fishes at a specific location; and 2) stream conditions at multiple locations within the river network for one species at different life-history stages. The novel, yet simple, ichthyograph offers a flexible framework to enable transformations in thinking regarding relationships between hydroclimate and aquatic species across space and time. The potential broad application of this innovative tool promotes synergism between assessments of physical characteristics and the biological needs of aquatic species."
https://openalex.org/W2565876460,"Bronchial artery embolization (BAE) is an important treatment option for short-term control of hemoptysis in patients with simple aspergilloma (SA). However, there are no data on the outcomes of BAE in patients with chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA). In this study, the clinical characteristics and outcomes of BAE were investigated and compared in patients with CPA and SA.We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 64 patients (55 [86%] with CPA and 9 [14%] with SA) who underwent BAE for life-threatening hemoptysis. The clinical characteristics and outcomes of BAE in CPA patients were compared to those of patients with SA.The most common angiographic abnormality was hypervascularity (n = 60, 94%), followed by contrast extravasation (n = 50, 78%) and systemic-pulmonary shunt (n = 48, 75%), with similar incidence rates in both groups. Immediate success was achieved in 41 (64%) BAE procedures, but it was incomplete in 23 (36%) cases due to difficulty with the approach and/or overuse of contrast medium. Clinical failure of BAE was observed in only one (2%) patient. Complications following BAE were observed in four (6%) patients. Recurrence of hemoptysis was seen in a total of 33 patients (52%) within a median of 2.0 (0.3-10.0) months, and repeat BAE was performed in 25 (76%) of these cases. In comparing the outcomes of patients with CPA and SA, there were no differences in the rates of success of initial BAE, incomplete embolization, or clinical failure in the two groups. However, recurrence of hemoptysis tended to be higher in patients with CPA (55%) than in those with SA (33%). In addition, antifungal medications following BAE were more commonly prescribed in the CPA group (56%) compared to the SA group (0%).BAE was a safe and effective procedure for the management of life-threatening hemoptysis in patients with CPA. However, recurrence of hemoptysis was common, especially in patients with CPA. Therefore, definitive treatment for CPA following successful BAE should be considered to ensure the long-term success of the embolization in these patients."

Predicted values of peak expiratory flow (%PEF) and forced vital capacity were decreased in subjects with SBMA compared with controls. In SBMA, both values were strongly correlated with the trunk subscores of the motor function tests and showed deterioration relative to disease duration. Compared with activities of daily living (ADL)-matched ALS subjects, %PEF, tongue pressure, and grip power were substantially decreased in subjects with SBMA. Both immunofluorescence and RT-PCR demonstrated a selective decrease in the expression levels of the genes encoding the myosin heavy chains specific to fast-twitch fibers in SBMA subjects. The mRNA levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta were up-regulated in SBMA compared with ALS and controls. In conclusion, %PEF is a disease-specific respiratory marker for the severity and progression of SBMA. Explosive muscle strength, including %PEF, was selectively affected in subjects with SBMA and was associated with activation of the mitochondrial biogenesis-related molecular pathway in skeletal muscles."

Herein we provide the first molecular and enzymatic characterization of the ADHE from the photosynthetic microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Purified recombinant ADHE catalyzed the reversible NADH-mediated interconversions of acetyl-CoA, acetaldehyde, and ethanol but seemed to be poised toward the production of ethanol from acetaldehyde.

ADHE was located in the chloroplast, where it associated in dimers and higher order oligomers. Electron microscopy analysis of ADHE-enriched stromal fractions revealed fine spiral structures, similar to bacterial ADHE spirosomes. Protein blots showed that ADHE is regulated under oxic conditions. Up-regulation is observed in cells exposed to diverse physiological stresses, including zinc deficiency, nitrogen starvation, and inhibition of carbon concentration/fixation capacity. Analyses of the overall proteome and fermentation profiles revealed that cells with increased ADHE abundance exhibit better survival under dark anoxia. This likely relates to the fact that greater ADHE abundance appeared to coincide with enhanced starch accumulation, which might reflect ADHE-mediated anticipation of anaerobic survival.

https://openalex.org/W2564300643,"Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) regulates follicular growth and stimulates estrogen synthesis in the ovaries. FSH is a heterodimer consisting of an α subunit, also present in luteinizing hormone, and a unique β subunit, which is transcriptionally regulated by gonadotropin-releasing hormone 1 (GNRH). Because most FSH is constitutively secreted, tight transcriptional regulation is critical for maintaining FSH levels within a narrow physiological range. Previously, we reported that GNRH induces FSHβ (Fshb) transcription via induction of the AP-1 transcription factor, a heterodimer of c-FOS and c-JUN. Herein, we identify c-JUN-dimerization protein 2 (JDP2) as a novel repressor of GNRH-mediated Fshb induction. JDP2 exhibited high basal expression and bound the Fshb promoter at an AP-1-binding site in a complex with c-JUN. GNRH treatment induced c-FOS to replace JDP2 as a c-JUN binding partner, forming transcriptionally active AP-1. Subsequently, rapid c-FOS degradation enabled reformation of the JDP2 complex. In vivo studies revealed that JDP2 null male mice have normal reproductive function, as expected from a negative regulator of the FSH hormone. Female JDP2 null mice, however, exhibited early puberty, observed as early vaginal opening, larger litters, and early reproductive senescence. JDP2 null females had increased levels of circulating FSH and higher expression of the Fshb subunit in the pituitary, resulting in elevated serum estrogen and higher numbers of large ovarian follicles. Disruption of JDP2 function therefore appears to cause early cessation of reproductive function, a condition that has been associated with elevated FSH in women.

Gonadotrope cells in the anterior pituitary synthesize and secrete luteinizing hormone (LH) 2The abbreviations used are: LHluteinizing hormoneGNRHgonadotropin-releasing hormoneAMHanti-Müllerian hormoneCREcyclic AMP-response elementTRETPA response elementHDAChistone deacetylaseIP3inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphateqPCRquantitative PCR. and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in response to pulses of hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone 1 (GNRH), which can be modulated by activin/inhibin and steroid feedback from the gonads. Gonadotropin hormones are heterodimers of a common α subunit and a unique β subunit. Gonadotropin levels fluctuate 3–4-fold throughout the menstrual or estrous cycle, preceded by changes in the β subunit transcription (1Ortolano G.A. Haisenleder D.J. Dalkin A.C. Iliff-Sizemore S.A.

Dysregulation of the tightly controlled gonadotropin levels leads to reproductive pathophysiology. Low levels of gonadotropin hormones lead to infertility; low LH leads to hypogonadism and anovulation, whereas low FSH causes follicular growth arrest (3Huhtaniemi I.

Reprod. Update. 2010; 16: 39-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Recently, it was determined that increased levels of FSH in the circulation, due to retrafficking of FSH to the GNRH-regulated secretory pathway, resulted in 5-fold more corpora lutea in the ovaries, implicating higher FSH levels in greater follicle recruitment (11Wang H.

Furthermore, polymorphism in the FSHB promoter in women, which regulates β subunit expression, increases the level of FSH and has been associated with early menarche and menopause (12He C. Kraft P.

Normal reproductive function requires pulsatile secretion of GNRH into the hypophysial portal system, whereas long term tonic exposure to GNRH adversely affects the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (14Burrin J.M.

Hypophysial responses to continuous and intermittent delivery of hypopthalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone.Science. 1978; 202: 631-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). GNRH receptors lack the C-terminal tail that normally mediates desensitization through β-arrestin association and encapsulation into clathrin-coated vesicles, rendering the receptor resistant to this regulatory mechanism. Thus, the receptor does not internalize as rapidly as other GPCRs (17McArdle C.A. Franklin J. Green L. Hislop J.N. Signalling, cycling and desensitisation of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone receptors.J. Endocrinol. 2002; 173: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Given that GNRH receptors do not internalize within the frequency of the pulse, due to the lack of a cytoplasmic tail, other feedback mechanisms must exist within the gonadotrope to shut off the signal and maintain gonadotropin expression within the narrow physiological range. This is especially true for FSH, because once synthesized, the majority of this hormone is constitutively secreted (18Nicol L. McNeilly J.R. Stridsberg M. McNeilly A.S. Differential secretion of gonadotrophins: investigation of the role of secretogranin II and chromogranin A in the release of LH and FSH in LβT2 cells.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 32: 467-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The GNRH receptor primarily couples to Gαq/11 and activates phospholipase Cβ, causing an increase in inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3), intracellular calcium, and diacylglycerol (19Stojilkovic S.S. Reinhart J. Catt K.J. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptors: structure and signal transduction pathways.Endocrine Rev. 1994; 15: 462-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The degree of desensitization that does occur after receptor occupancy may be due to loss of IP3 receptors necessary for propagation of signaling (17McArdle C.A. Franklin J. Green L. Hislop J.N. Signalling, cycling and desensitisation of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone receptors.J. Endocrinol. 2002; 173: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 20McArdle C.A. Davidson J.S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 23711-23717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In addition to desensitization of signaling molecules, such as IP3 receptors, it is likely that mechanisms exist in the nucleus that prevent further transcription of the gonadotropin subunits. There are several possible mechanisms, including dephosphorylation, degradation, and deactivation of transcription factors and RNA polymerase II; return of chromatin to a closed conformation by histone modification; or induction or reactivation of transcriptional repressors. We identified that GNRH induces Fshb through the activating protein 1 (AP-1) site (22Coss D. Jacobs S.B. Bender C.E. Mellon P.L. A novel AP-1 site is critical for maximal induction of the follicle-stimulating hormone β gene by gonadotropin-releasing hormone.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 152-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), which is bound by the AP-1 transcription factor, composed of heterodimers of Fos and Jun isoforms. Prototypical members c-FOS and c-JUN are activated rapidly and transiently and exhibit a very short half-life to bring forth very tight temporal regulation of target genes (23Karin M. Liu Zg. Zandi E. AP-1 function and regulation.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2307) Google Scholar). We also determined that GNRH specifically induces c-FOS (24Ely H.A. Mellon P.L. Coss D. GnRH Induces the c-Fos gene via phosphorylation of SRF by the calcium/calmodulin kinase II pathway.Mol. Endocrinol. 2011; 25: 669-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and c-JUN (25Lindaman L.L. Yeh D.M. Xie C. Breen K.M. Coss D. Phosphorylation of ATF2 and interaction with NFY induces c-Jun in the gonadotrope.Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 2013; 365: 316-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) transcription in the mature gonadotrope cells, whereas other hormones and stimuli that activate these genes in other cell types are not sufficient to induce AP-1 in the gonadotrope. c-FOS is not present without stimulus in quiescent cells and is more strictly regulated, both at the transcriptional and posttranslational level by GNRH, whereas c-JUN has detectable basal expression and is induced 6-fold by GNRH (26Reddy G.R. Xie C. Lindaman L.L. Coss D. GnRH increases c-Fos half-life contributing to higher FSHβ induction.Mol. Endocrinol. 2013; 27: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Following c-FOS induction, it dimerizes with c-JUN to bind the AP-1 site, which is currently the only known element to convey GNRH responsiveness of the Fshb promoter. Negative regulators at the AP-1 site or the highly similar CRE element include activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3 (27Chen B.P. Wolfgang C.D. Hai T. Analysis of ATF3, a transcription factor induced by physiological stresses and modulated by gadd153/Chop10.Mol.

Isolation of an AP-1 repressor by a novel method for detecting protein-protein interactions.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3094-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). JDP2, previously known to form a heterodimer with c-JUN (29Aronheim A. Zandi E. Hennemann H. Elledge S.J. Karin M. Isolation of an AP-1 repressor by a novel method for detecting protein-protein interactions.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3094-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), represses transcription of AP-1 target genes. Herein, we determined that JDP2 interacts with c-JUN at the AP-1 site in the Fshb promoter. Consistent with prior reports that JDP2 can also interact with ATF2 (30Jin C. Ugai H. Song J. Murata T. Nili F. Sun K. Horikoshi M. Yokoyama K.K. Identification of mouse Jun dimerization protein 2 as a novel repressor of ATF-2.FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), which we previously determined conveys GNRH induction of c-Jun in gonadotrope cells (25Lindaman L.L. Yeh D.M. Xie C. Breen K.M. Coss D. Phosphorylation of ATF2 and interaction with NFY induces c-Jun in the gonadotrope.Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 2013; 365: 316-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), JDP2 inhibits induction of c-Jun mRNA by GNRH. The repressor, JDP2, may function before the GNRH signal and after a wave of transcription to shut off the signal. Like many other repressors, JDP2 is known to recruit histone deacetylases (HDACs) to repress transcription through chromatin modification. In particular, JDP2 interacts directly with HDAC3 (31Jin C. Li H. Murata T. Sun K. Horikoshi M. Chiu R. Yokoyama K.K. JDP2, a repressor of AP-1, recruits a histone deacetylase 3 complex to inhibit the retinoic acid-induced differentiation of F9 cells.Mol.

Horikoshi M. Yokoyama K.K. Regulation of histone acetylation and nucleosome assembly by transcription factor JDP2.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Previously, it has been shown that HDAC3 dissociates from the Fshb promoter following GNRH treatment to increase Fshb transcription (33Lim S. Luo M. Koh M. Yang M. bin Abdul Kadir M.N. Tan J.H. Ye Z. Wang W. Melamed P. Distinct mechanisms involving diverse histone deacetylases repress expression of the two gonadotropin β-subunit genes in immature gonadotropes, and their actions are overcome by gonadotropin-releasing hormone.Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 4105-4120Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Identification of JDP2 provides a mechanism of histone deacetylation in the absence of the GNRH signal. In this report, we identify a mechanism of negative regulation of FSHβ transcription in the gonadotrope in vivo and in the LβT2 model cell line. Previous reports identified that Nab family members antagonize Egr1 and negatively affect GNRH induction of Lhb (34Lawson M.A. Tsutsumi R. Zhang H. Talukdar I. Butler B.K. Santos S.J. Mellon P.L. Webster N.J. Pulse sensitivity of the luteinizing hormone β promoter is determined by a negative feedback loop Involving early growth response-1 and Ngfi-A binding protein 1 and 2.Mol. Endocrinol. 2007; 21: 1175-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), whereas Fshb induction by activin is negatively regulated by Smad pathway antagonists SKIL and TGIF (35Mistry D.S. Tsutsumi R. Fernandez M. Sharma S. Cardenas S.A. Lawson M.A. Webster N.J. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone pulse sensitivity of follicle-stimulating hormone-β gene is mediated by differential expression of positive regulatory activator protein 1 factors and corepressors SKIL and TGIF1.Mol. Endocrinol. 2011; 25: 1387-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We identified a member of the AP-1 superfamily, JDP2, that serves as a negative regulator of Fshb induction by GNRH, both directly, by repressing AP-1 transcriptional activity, and indirectly, by limiting c-JUN expression. We further demonstrate that a lack of this repressor in vivo leads to early puberty and early cessation of fertility in the null female mice, which may mimic premature ovarian failure in human population. Therefore, identification of the novel function of JDP2 leads to better understanding of the regulation of FSH physiological levels and pathophysiologies where FSH levels are dysregulated. The physiological range and responsiveness of gene expression to subsequent, specific stimuli is tightly controlled by both positive and negative regulators of transcription. This is critical for gonadotropin hormones, whose increase is associated with polycystic ovary syndrome or premature ovarian failure in females. Although repressors are relatively more difficult to identify, negative regulators of GNRH induction of LHβ and activin induction of FSHβ have been determined (34Lawson M.A. Tsutsumi R. Zhang H. Talukdar I. Butler B.K. Santos S.J. Mellon P.L. Webster N.J.

Endocrinol. 2011; 25: 1387-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We sought to identify a protein that serves as a transcriptional repressor of GNRH induction of Fshb transcription, because Fshb is normally expressed at a low basal level. We first determined the time course of induction of GNRH target genes in LβT2 cells, a model of mature gonadotrope (Fig. 1A). The time course for induction of GNRH target genes is different, but all are biphasic. Similar to the previously reported time course for c-Fos induction (26Reddy G.R. Xie C. Lindaman L.L. Coss D. GnRH increases c-Fos half-life contributing to higher FSHβ induction.Mol. Endocrinol. 2013; 27: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the maximal induction of c-Jun of 15.5-fold is at 1 h of treatment, after which the message rapidly declines. -Fold induction diminished to 5.4-fold of control at 2 h and 3.8-fold at 6 h, and induction returned to basal levels at 12 h of treatment. Compared with our previous report analyzing c-Fos, the major difference is that c-Fos is not present at a basal state, without stimuli, whereas c-Jun is present at both mRNA (Fig. 1A) and protein levels (26Reddy G.R. Xie C. Lindaman L.L. Coss D. GnRH increases c-Fos half-life contributing to higher FSHβ induction.Mol. Endocrinol. 2013; 27: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Fshb expression is very low at the basal state (Fig. 1A), and maximal induction of 12-fold by GNRH is observed at 2 h of treatment. After the maximum, the message level diminishes and returns to basal level at 12 h of treatment. We performed DNA pull-downs followed by mass spectrometry sequencing and identified JDP2 as a novel protein that interacts with the FSHβ promoter at the AP-1 site, which was previously known to form a heterodimer with the Jun subfamily (29Aronheim A. Zandi E. Hennemann H. Elledge S.J. Karin M. Isolation of an AP-1 repressor by a novel method for detecting protein-protein interactions.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3094-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). We then analyzed whether JDP2 is induced by GNRH and determined that Jdp2 exists in the cells at a relatively high basal level and is induced 2-fold at 2 h of GNRH treatment (Fig. 1B). We also analyzed the expression of a close family member, ATF3, which is induced by GNRH (25Lindaman L.L. Yeh D.M. Xie C. Breen K.M. Coss D. Phosphorylation of ATF2 and interaction with NFY induces c-Jun in the gonadotrope.Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 2013; 365: 316-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 36Xie J. Bliss S.P. Nett T.M.

Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 2624-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and determined that Atf3 mRNA is not found at a basal level and is induced rapidly by GNRH with a maximal induction of 23-fold at 1 h, after which the induction diminishes (Fig. 1B). Therefore, both ATF3 and JDP2, which can serve as negative regulators of transcription at the AP1 and CRE sites, are induced by GNRH. The difference is that Jdp2 is present at the basal level, whereas Atf3 is non-detectable. Protein levels of c-JUN, ATF3, and JDP2 transcription factors correspond to changes in mRNA levels (Fig. 1C). c-JUN protein is induced after 1 h of GNRH treatment and exhibits a maximum at 2 h, as we determined previously (26Reddy G.R. Xie C. Lindaman L.L. Coss D. GnRH increases c-Fos half-life contributing to higher FSHβ induction.Mol. Endocrinol. 2013; 27: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). c-JUN protein level returns to basal after 16 h of treatment. ATF3 protein induction, as determined before (25Lindaman L.L. Yeh D.M. Xie C. Breen K.M. Coss D. Phosphorylation of ATF2 and interaction with NFY induces c-Jun in the gonadotrope.Mol.

JDP2 protein is present at basal level without GNRH treatment, and the levels change less compared with ATF3 and c-JUN, with an increase at 2 h of treatment and return to basal level by 24 h. Next, we determined whether JDP2 can interfere with GNRH induction of gonadotrope genes. We determined previously that GNRH phosphorylation of ATF2 activates c-JUN transcription in the gonadotrope (25Lindaman L.L. Yeh D.M. Xie C. Breen K.M. Coss D. Phosphorylation of ATF2 and interaction with NFY induces c-Jun in the gonadotrope.Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 2013; 365: 316-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and that GNRH induction of c-JUN and c-FOS activates Fshb transcription (22Coss D. Jacobs S.B. Bender C.E. Mellon P.L.

Identification of mouse Jun dimerization protein 2 as a novel repressor of ATF-2.FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) as well as c-JUN (29Aronheim A. Zandi E. Hennemann H. Elledge S.J. Karin M. Isolation of an AP-1 repressor by a novel method for detecting protein-protein interactions.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3094-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), we overexpressed JDP2 with c-JUN luciferase (Fig. 2B) and FSHβ luciferase (Fig. 2E) reporters. To determine the specificity of JDP2 function in gene induction by GNRH, we also overexpressed ATF3, which can serve as a repressor and is a close family member of JDP2. JDP2 can bind at either the TRE/AP-1 site (TGAGTCA), where it interacts with c-JUN, or the CRE site (TGACGTCA), where it interacts with ATF2. The TRE/AP-1 half-site conveys GNRH responsiveness of the Fshb promoter (22Coss D. Jacobs S.B. Bender C.E. Mellon P.L. A novel AP-1 site is critical for maximal induction of the follicle-stimulating hormone β gene by gonadotropin-releasing hormone.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 152-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), whereas the CRE site in the c-Jun promoter is responsible for c-Jun induction by GNRH (25Lindaman L.L. Yeh D.M. Xie C. Breen K.M. Coss D. Phosphorylation of ATF2 and interaction with NFY induces c-Jun in the gonadotrope.Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 2013; 365: 316-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to c-JUN luciferase and FSHβ luciferase, we transfected CRE luciferase and TRE luciferase to assay GNRH induction via these sites in the presence of JDP2 or ATF3. These reporters contain four tandem copies of the 8-bp consensus CRE element (Fig. 2A) or of the similar 7-bp consensus TRE multimer, which has four tandem copies of the TRE element (Fig. 2D) ligated to the minimal thymidine kinase promoter driving luciferase expression. GNRH induced the CRE site multimer, as we have shown previously, whereas the addition of either ATF3 or JDP2 diminished both basal expression and GNRH induction, indicated with a pound sign (Fig. 2A). Both ATF3 and JDP2 also reduced -fold induction of the CRE site by GNRH, indicated with an asterisk. -Fold induction was calculated by normalizing samples treated with GNRH to the vehicle-treated samples transfected with the same expression vectors, for easier observation of the induction by GNRH without the effect of basal repression. On the other hand, basal expression and GNRH induction of the c-JUN promoter, which contains other elements in addition to the CRE site, was reduced by overexpression of JDP2 but not ATF3 (Fig. 2B). The CRE site in the c-JUN promoter is necessary for the maximal induction of the c-JUN gene by GNRH, because GNRH induction of c-JUN is diminished when CRE is mutated (Fig. 2C, CRE mut) (25Lindaman L.L. Yeh D.M. Xie C. Breen K.M. Coss D. Phosphorylation of ATF2 and interaction with NFY induces c-Jun in the gonadotrope.Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 2013; 365: 316-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). CRE site mutation prevented further repression of GNRH induction of c-JUN by JDP2, because the CRE site mutant is induced by GNRH to the same level with and without JDP2 (Fig. 2C). This indicates that JDP2 represses c-JUN promoter via the CRE site. JDP2 overexpression diminished both basal and -fold induction of the TRE/AP-1 multimer by GNRH, whereas ATF3 overexpression reduced basal expression and consequently the level of induction by GNRH but had no effect on -fold induction, contrary to the CRE multimer (Fig. 2D). JDP2, but not ATF3, reduced FSHβ -fold induction by GNRH (Fig. 2E). As stated previously, GNRH induces FSHβ through the TRE/AP-1 site, because when this site is mutated, GNRH induction is reduced (Fig. 3F, TRE mut) (22"

Methods Human corneal fibroblasts from Healthy (HCFs), Type 1DM (T1DM) and Type 2DM (T2DM) donors were isolated and cultured for 4 weeks with Vitamin C stimulation in order to allow for extracellular matrix (ECM) secretion and assembly. Results Our data indicated altered cellular morphology, increased cellular migration, increased ECM assembly, and severe mitochondrial damage in both T1DM and T2DMs when compared to HCFs. Furthermore, we found significant downregulation of Collagen I and Collagen V expression in both T1DM and T2DMs. Furthermore, a significant up regulation of fibrotic markers was seen, including α-smooth muscle actin in T2DM and Collagen III in both T1DM and T2DMs. Metabolic analysis suggested impaired Glycolysis and Tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) pathway. Conclusion DM has significant effects on physiological and clinical aspects of the human cornea. The benefits in developing and fully characterizing our 3D in vitro model are enormous and might provide clues for the development of novel therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2568990187,"The relative importance of environment and dispersal related processes for community assembly has attracted great interest over recent decades, but few empirical studies from the marine/estuarine realm have examined the possible effects of these two types of factors in the same system. Importance of these processes was investigated in a hypothetical metacommunity of benthic invertebrates in 16 micro-tidal estuaries connected to the same open sea area. The estuaries differed in size and connectivity to the open sea and represented a salinity gradient across the estuaries. The Elements of Metacommunity Structure (EMS) approach on estuary scale was complemented with a mechanistic variance partitioning approach on sample scale to disentangle effects of factors affecting assembly of three trait groups of species with different dispersivity. A quasi-Clementsian pattern was observed for all three traits, a likely response to some latent gradient. The primary axis in the pattern was most strongly related to gradients in estuary salinity and estuary entrance width and correlation with richness indicated nestedness only in the matrix of the most dispersive trait group. In the variance partitioning approach measures of turnover and nestedness between paired samples each from different estuaries were related to environmental distance in different gradients. Distance between estuaries was unimportant suggesting importance of factors characterizing the estuaries. While the high dispersive species mainly were sorted in the salinity gradient, apparently according to their tolerance ranges towards salinity, the two less dispersive traits were additionally affected by estuary entrance width and possibly also area. The results exemplify a mechanism of community assembly in the marine realm where the niche factor salinity in conjunction with differential dispersal structure invertebrates in a metacommunity of connected estuaries, and support the idea that dispersive species are more controlled by the environment than less dispersive species."
https://openalex.org/W2561058763,"Previous work has revealed that Cx36, the sole connexin expressed in the insulin-producing beta cells, enhances the secretion of insulin, and promotes the resistance of beta cells against pro-inflammatory cytokines. In parallel, the anti-diabetic sulphonylurea glibenclamide was shown to promote the assembly and function of Cx36 channels. Here, we assessed whether glibenclamide could protect the insulin-producing cells against conditions mimicking those expected at the onset of type 1 diabetes. We found that the drug 1) protected in vitro the mouse MIN6 cells from the apoptosis and loss of Cx36, which are induced by Th1 cytokines; 2) prevented the development of hyperglycemia as well as the loss of beta cells and Cx36, which rapidly develop with aging in untreated NOD mice; 3) modified the proportion of effector CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in pancreatic draining lymph nodes. The data imply that an early glibenclamide treatment may help protecting beta cells against the autoimmune attack, which triggers the development of type 1 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2565290500,"Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) is a multi-functional cytokine implicated in the control of cell growth and differentiation. TGF-β signals through a complex of TGF-β receptors 1 and 2 (TGFβR1 and TGFβR2) that phosphorylate and activate Smad2/3 transcription factors driving transcription of the Smad-target genes. The Na+/K+-ATPase is an integral plasma membrane protein critical for maintaining the electro-chemical gradient of Na+ and K+ in the cell. We found that inhibition of the Na+/K+ ATPase by ouabain results in a dramatic decrease in the expression of TGFβR2 in human lung fibrobalsts (HLF) at the mRNA and protein levels. This was accompanied by inhibition of TGF-β-induced Smad phosphorylation and the expression of TGF-β target genes, such as fibronectin and smooth muscle alpha-actin. Inhibition of Na+/K+ ATPase by an alternative approach (removal of extracellular potassium) had a similar effect in HLF. Finally, treatment of lung alveolar epithelial cells (A549) with ouabain also resulted in the downregulation of TGFβR2, the inhibition of TGF-β-induced Smad phosphorylation and of the expression of mesenchymal markers, vimentin and fibronectin. Together, these data demonstrate a critical role of Na+/K+-ATPase in the control of TGFβR2 expression, TGF-β signaling and cell responses to TGF-β."
https://openalex.org/W2569929885,"Literary fiction has been credited with considerable power to improve attitudes toward outgroups. It was even argued that it has been an important factor behind the global decline of violence against various minorities in the last centuries. Could it also help to reduce the human-inflicted suffering of animals? To test this, we studied the attitude toward animal welfare of n = 921 (experimental group) people of both sexes who read a short fragment of an unpublished novel with a motif of the physical abuse of an animal. The control group (n = 912) read a fragment of a similar length but not related to animals. After reading the text all subjects filled out an on-line questionnaire with seven items (camouflaged among many others items) measuring attitudes toward animal welfare. The questionnaire included also demographical questions, such as whether the subject keeps pets. We found that in comparison with the control group, the experimental group was significantly more concerned about animal welfare. This result indicates that literary fiction can influence attitudes toward other species. It is also worth noting that our study is characterized by a high level of ecological validity, i.e. a relatively high extent to which its results can be generalized (or extended) to real-world settings. Due to its specific design, which involved the cooperation of a bestselling author and his publisher, the study approximated the typical conditions in which people read fiction in a remarkably accurate way. Finally, our research has potential practical implications for promoting animal welfare."
https://openalex.org/W2569711430,"The importance of ecosystems for supporting human well-being is increasingly recognized by both the conservation and development sectors. Our ability to conserve ecosystems that people rely on is often limited by a lack of spatially explicit data on the location and distribution of ecosystem services (ES), the benefits provided by nature to people. Thus there is a need to map ES to guide conservation investments, to ensure these co-benefits are maintained. To target conservation investments most effectively, ES assessments must be rigorous enough to support conservation planning, rapid enough to respond to decision-making timelines, and often must rely on existing data. We developed a framework for rapid spatial assessment of ES that relies on expert and stakeholder consultation, available data, and spatial analyses in order to rapidly identify sites providing multiple benefits. We applied the framework in Madagascar, a country with globally significant biodiversity and a high level of human dependence on ecosystems. Our objective was to identify the ES co-benefits of biodiversity priority areas in order to guide the investment strategy of a global conservation fund. We assessed key provisioning (fisheries, hunting and non-timber forest products, and water for domestic use, agriculture, and hydropower), regulating (climate mitigation, flood risk reduction and coastal protection), and cultural (nature tourism) ES. We also conducted multi-criteria analyses to identify sites providing multiple benefits. While our approach has limitations, including the reliance on proximity-based indicators for several ES, the results were useful for targeting conservation investments by the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund (CEPF). Because our approach relies on available data, standardized methods for linking ES provision to ES use, and expert validation, it has the potential to quickly guide conservation planning and investment decisions in other data-poor regions."

https://openalex.org/W2563051760,"Brown eggs are popular in many countries and consumers regard eggshell brownness as an important indicator of egg quality. However, the potential regulatory proteins and detailed molecular mechanisms regulating eggshell brownness have yet to be clearly defined. In the present study, we performed quantitative proteomics analysis with iTRAQ technology in the shell gland epithelium of hens laying dark and light brown eggs to investigate the candidate proteins and molecular mechanisms underlying variation in chicken eggshell brownness. The results indicated 147 differentially expressed proteins between these two groups, among which 65 and 82 proteins were significantly up-regulated in the light and dark groups, respectively. Functional analysis indicated that in the light group, the down-regulated iron-sulfur cluster assembly protein (Iba57) would decrease the synthesis of protoporphyrin IX; furthermore, the up-regulated protein solute carrier family 25 (mitochondrial carrier; adenine nucleotide translocator), member 5 (SLC25A5) and down-regulated translocator protein (TSPO) would lead to increased amounts of protoporphyrin IX transported into the mitochondria matrix to form heme with iron, which is supplied by ovotransferrin protein (TF). In other words, chickens from the light group produce less protoporphyrin IX, which is mainly used for heme synthesis. Therefore, the exported protoporphyrin IX available for eggshell deposition and brownness is reduced in the light group. The current study provides valuable information to elucidate variation of chicken eggshell brownness, and demonstrates the feasibility and sensitivity of iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomics analysis in providing useful insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying brown eggshell pigmentation."
https://openalex.org/W2566575831,"Objective The influenza vaccine coverage rate of children is low in Hong Kong. Microneedle patches (MNPs) is a technology under development for painless delivery of vaccines. This study aimed to examine the potential clinical outcomes and direct medical costs of an influenza program offering MNP vaccine to children who have declined intramuscular (IM) vaccine in Hong Kong. Methods A decision model was designed to compare potential outcomes between IM vaccine program and a program offering MNP vaccine to those declined IM vaccine (IM/MNP program) in a hypothetical cohort of children over one-year time horizon. The model outcomes included direct medical cost, influenza infection rate, mortality rate, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) loss. Model inputs were retrieved from published literature. Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the robustness of model results. Results In base-case analysis, IM/MNP program was more costly per child (USD19.13 versus USD13.69; USD1 = HKD7.8) with lower influenza infection rate (98.9 versus 124.8 per 1,000 children), hospitalization rate (0.83 versus 1.05 per 1,000 children) and influenza-related mortality rate (0.00042 versus 0.00052 per 1,000 children) when compared to IM program. The incremental cost per QALY saved (ICER) of IM/MNP program versus IM program was 27,200 USD/QALY. Using gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of Hong Kong (USD40,594) as threshold of willingness-to-pay (WTP) per QALY, one-way sensitivity analysis found ICER of IM/MNP to exceed WTP when duration of illness in outpatient setting was <5.7 days or cost per MNP vaccine was >1.39-time of IM vaccine cost. In 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations, IM/MNP program was the preferred option in 57.28% and 91.68% of the time, using 1x and 3x GDP per capita as WTP threshold, respectively. Conclusion Acceptance of IM/MNP program as the preferred program was subject to the WTP threshold, duration of illness in outpatient settings, and cost of MNP vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W2561143794,"Background Urogenital infection with Chlamydia trachomatis(CT) is one of the most common bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) world-wide, especially in developing nations where routine laboratory diagnosis is unavailable. Little is known about the epidemiology of this infection in Ethiopia where other STIs are prevalent. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence and associated factors of CT infection among women of reproductive age. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 322 consecutive women aged between 15–49 years at Hawassa University Referral Hospital from November 2014 to April 2015. Data on socio-demography and potential risk factors for genital infection were collected using structured questionnaires. Moreover, endocervical swabs were collected from all participants, screened for CT antigen using rapid immunochromatography assay, and cultured following the standard bacteriological method to isolate Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Result In this study, the overall prevalence of CT antigen and N. gonorrhoeae infection was 61(18.9%) and 1(0.31%), respectively. Women aged 15–24 years had the highest prevalence of CT infection (24.2%), followed by those aged 25–34 years (16.8%) and those aged 35–49 years (9.6%). CTinfection was associated with women who had unprotected sex within the last six months (aOR = 3.459; 95% CI = 1.459–8.222) and were sexually active for 6–10 years (aOR = 3.076; 95% CI = 1.152–8.209). None of the clinical symptoms and diagnoses was significantly associated with CT antigen positivity. Conclusions The high prevalence of genital CT infection in this study highlights the need for further large-scale studies on the general population. Thus, screening of women regardless of their symptoms should be in place."

Cell. 2005; 17: 23-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, whether growth factor regulated cytoplasmic sequestration of TFII-I is the only function of p190A FF domains is called into question by the fact that zebrafish, Drosophila melanogaster, and Caenorhabditis elegans p190 RhoGAP orthologs include similar FF domain arrays, but lack obvious TFII-I orthologs. Thus, to shed further light on the functions of this and other p190A segments, we set out to identify proteins associated with endogenous human p190A. Here we report our unexpected finding that p190A, but not its 50% identical p190B paralog, interacts with eIF3A and exists in a complex with several other translational preinitiation complex subunits. We mapped the interacting segments to an N-terminal p190A region that includes the first FF domain, and to the winged helix-fold of the eIF3A PCI (Proteasome, COP9 signalosome, eIF3) domain. The interaction between p190A and eIF3A is stable and unlike the p190A/TFII-I interaction, unaffected by mutating Tyr308. However, a non-phosphorylatable S296A, but not a phosphomimicking S296D mutation, targeting the only other known phosphorylated residue in the first FF domain, disrupts the interaction, which together with other evidence argues that the interaction between p190A and eIF3A is regulated by phosphorylation. Because some functionally important preinitiation complex subunits are missing from the detected complex, we propose a role for p190A in translational regulation, by controlling the assembly of functional preinitiation complexes. In HeLa cell extracts fractionated by differential centrifugation, p190A predominantly resides in the detergent-soluble membrane fraction, with some protein also found in the nuclear pellet and cytosol (Fig. 1A). A similar distribution was previously reported for Rat-1 fibroblast p190A (6Settleman J. Narasimhan V. Foster L.C. Weinberg R.A. Molecular cloning of cDNAs encoding the GAP-associated protein p190: implications for a signaling pathway from ras to the nucleus.Cell. 1992; 69: 539-549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). To identify proteins associated with endogenous p190A, we used a p190A antibody affinity matrix to purify potential complexes from the detergent-soluble membrane fraction of serum-starved and growth factor-stimulated HeLa cells, using a non-immune IgG affinity matrix as a control. After extensive washing, bound proteins were eluted, size fractionated by SDS-gel electrophoresis, and visualized by silver staining. In both growth factor-stimulated and serum-starved samples, a complex mixture of proteins was eluted from the p190A but not the control matrix (shown for the growth factor-stimulated sample in Fig. 1B). For identification the affinity-enriched and SDS-PAGE-fractionated proteins were subjected to analysis by microcapillary liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Remarkably, the 20 identified proteins with the highest number of MS/MS spectra (spectral counts) include p190A/ARHGAP35 itself and 14 translation preinitiation complex subunits (17Jackson R.J. Hellen C.U. Pestova T.V. The mechanism of eukaryotic translation initiation and principles of its regulation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 113-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (1746) Google Scholar), including 11 of the 13 eIF3 subunits (18Hinnebusch A.G. eIF3: a versatile scaffold for translation initiation complexes.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 553-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), two eIF4F subunits (eIF4A1 and eIF4G1), and poly(A)-binding protein PABPC1 (Table 1). No previously reported p190A/ARHGAP35 interacting proteins are among the top 20 identified proteins, whereas supplemental Table S1, listing 230 proteins with at least two spectral counts in either sample, includes δ-catenin/CTNND1 (19Wildenberg G.A.

Of note, whereas the spectral counts for p190A itself were similar in growth factor-stimulated and serum-starved samples, most other proteins were more abundant in the former (Table 1 and supplemental Table S1), suggesting that serum stimulation enhances the interaction between p190A and its associated proteins.TABLE 1Multiple translation preinitiation complex subunits are among the 20 most abundant proteins associated with membrane-associated p190AUniProt IDGeneGene IDSC starvedSC stimulatedQ14152EIF3A8661128172P55884–2EIF3B866292141Q04637–3EIF4G1198180128Q99613EIF3C866384117Q9Y262EIF3L513867199P60228EIF3E36464781O15371EIF3D86643868O00303EIF3F86653273Q7L2H7EIF3M104803269O15372EIF3H86673067Q9NRY4–2ARHGAP3529094552Q5JSZ5PRRC2B847264056O75821EIF3G86662661P11940–2PABPC1269863050Q13347EIF3I86683050Q8IVT2MISP1263532449P07437TUBB2030681937P60842EIF4A119731240P60709ACTB601140P49792RANBP259031629 Open table in a new tab To determine whether a complex between p190A and translation initiation factors is also detectable in unfractionated HeLa extracts, we performed a second proteomic analysis. In this analysis, performed without SDS-PAGE size fractionation of affinity-enriched proteins, a largely overlapping set of translation preinitiation factors, including 12 eIF3 subunits, was detected, although in this case only eIF3A and eIF3B ranked among the top 35 p190A-associated proteins (supplemental Table S2). The fact that both proteomic experiments detected all but one or two eIF3 subunits suggests that p190A associates with the eIF3 complex, which serves as a scaffold for larger preinitiation complexes involved in mRNA 5′-cap binding and in the scanning mechanism responsible for identifying the correct translational start codon (18Hinnebusch A.G. eIF3: a versatile scaffold for translation initiation complexes.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 553-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The presence of PABPC1 and eIF4F subunits eIF4A1 and eIF4G1 also implicates such a p190A-containing complex in the initiation of mRNA translation. Further supporting this idea, supplemental Table S1 includes the two remaining eIF3 subunits (eIF3J and eIF3K), the remaining eIF4F subunit (eIF4E; the mRNA cap-binding protein), two paralogs of eIF4A1 (eIF4A2 and eIF4A3), the PABPC1 paralog PABPC4, and 40S small ribosome subunit proteins RPSA, RPS3, RPS3A, RPS8, RPS14, RPS18, RPS19, and RPS25. Finally, PRRC2C (proline-rich coiled-coil 2C), a member of the mRNA interactome (20Castello A. Fischer B. Eichelbaum K. Horos R. Beckmann B.M. Strein C. Davey N.E. Humphreys D.T. Preiss T.

To rule out an obvious artifact, we tested whether the rabbit polyclonal antibody used to affinity purify p190A complexes cross-reacts with one or more translation factors. To rule this out, we used a mouse monoclonal antibody to precipitate p190A from HeLa cells, and analyzed the presence of eIF3A, eIF3B, eIF3C, eIF3D, and eIF3H by immunoblotting. In this and additional co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments we also increased the stringency of washes by using ionic detergent containing RIPA rather than Triton buffers. Under these more stringent conditions all five tested eIF3 subunits again co-precipitated with p190A (Fig. 2A). Moreover, p190A, eIF3B, eIF3C, eIF3D, and eIF3H each co-precipitated with eIF3A (Fig. 2B). Translational preinitiation complexes include the 40S small ribosomal subunit and bind to the 5′ cap of mRNAs to initiate translation (17Jackson R.J. Hellen C.U. Pestova T.V. The mechanism of eukaryotic translation initiation and principles of its regulation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 113-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (1746) Google Scholar). However, RNase treatment did not affect the co-precipitation of p190A and the above five eIF3 subunits, arguing that complex formation does not require RNA (not shown). Arguing that the detected interaction is specific for p190A, no association between the five tested eIF3 subunits and endogenous p190B RhoGAP was detected in similar co-IP experiments (Fig. 2C). Because a role for p190A in translational initiation was unanticipated, we performed a further specificity test by repeating the co-IP experiments with HeLa cells in which either p190A or eIF3A had been knocked down. Using ON-TARGETplus siRNA Smartpools, near complete knockdown of p190A and substantial knockdown of eIF3A was achieved (Fig. 3, A and C). In cells lacking p190A, the p190A antibody did not co-IP any of the five analyzed eIF3 subunits, and vice versa, p190A and the four other eIF3 subunits were not precipitated by the eIF3A antibody when eIF3A was knocked down (Fig. 3, B and D). The latter observation is compatible with the recent finding that eIF3A knockdown disintegrates the entire eIF3 complex (25Wagner S. Herrmannová A. Malík R. Peclinovská L. Valás̆ek L.S. Functional and biochemical characterization of human eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 in living cells.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2014; 34: 3041-3052Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results provide strong evidence that the detected interaction occurs in vivo. Because the 20 proteins with the highest number of spectral counts in Table 1 include 11 of 13 eIF3 subunits, we speculated that p190A might interact with one or more subunits of this complex. As a first test, we analyzed the stability of the interaction between p190A and eIF3A, eIF3B, eIF3C, eIF3D, and eIF3H by subjecting p190A immune complexes to washes of increasing ionic strength. Fig. 4 shows that among the five subunits analyzed, the interaction between p190A and the eIF3A scaffolding subunit of the eIF3 functional core (26Saletta F. Suryo Rahmanto Y. Richardson D.R. The translational regulator eIF3a: the tricky eIF3 subunit!.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1806: 275-286PubMed Google Scholar) is most stable, with some interaction detectable even after 0.6 m NaCl RIPA buffer washes. Retention of eIF3A in p190A immune complexes even after removal of other eIF3 subunits suggests it may represent a key interface for p190A/eIF3 interaction. Consistent with this interpretation, RNAi knockdown of eIF3A abolished the interaction of p190A with four other eIF3 subunits (Fig. 3D). To obtain more direct evidence that p190A associates with eIF3A, and to map the interacting protein domains, we performed pulldown experiments with GST fusion proteins representing various p190A segments (Fig. 5A). In these assays, eIF3A was brought down by a GST fusion protein representing the p190A N-terminal GTPase domain, and more strongly by a protein representing the adjacent FF domains. However, eIF3A did not detectably interact with a fusion protein representing the RhoGAP domain, or with GST itself (Fig. 5A). In similar experiments with His-tagged eIF3A fusion proteins, p190A interacted with an eIF3A fusion protein that included the winged helix-fold (27Ellisdon A.M. Stewart M. Structural biology of the PCI-protein fold.Bioarchitecture. 2012; 2: 118-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) of its PCI domain (residues 404–495), but not with fusion proteins representing other parts of the protein (Fig. 5B). Although these results do not rule out that other translation factors contribute to the detected interaction, they do suggest that an interaction between the N-terminal p190A GTPase/FF domain segment and the eIF3A PCI domain winged helix-fold plays an important role.FIGURE 5Mapping of the p190A and eIF3A interacting segments. The indicated segments of p190A (diagram in panel A) and eIF3A (panel B) were produced as GST fusion proteins. The central region of p190A could not be made as a soluble fusion protein and has not been analyzed. The anti-GST or anti-His tag blots in panels A and B show the sizes and relative amounts of GST proteins used in the pull downs. The eIF3A Western blot (WB) in panel A show that eIF3A interacts weakly with the p190A GTPase domain (residues 1–268), and more strongly with a fusion protein representing all four FF domains (residues 268–512). Interaction is also observed with a fusion protein representing p190A residues 1–512. The p190A Western blot in panel B shows that only the winged helix (WH) segment of the eIF3A PCI domain interacts with p190A in this assay.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The N-terminal GTPase domain of p190A binds GTP, and although two guanine nucleotide-binding deficient S36N or 201KCD203 to 201DCV203 mutants both retained in vitro RhoGAP activity (8Foster R.

Chem. 1998; 273: 34631-34638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Because eIF3A interacts with an N-terminal p190A segment that includes the GTPase domain, we tested whether the ability to bind nucleotide affects eIF3A binding. To this end we introduced the previously characterized 201DCV203 double mutation in our p190A1–512-GST fusion construct, and analyzed its ability to pulldown eIF3A. Suggesting that nucleotide binding is not required for eIF3A binding in this setting, no difference in the amount of eIF3A pulled down by the wild-type and mutant GST proteins was observed (Fig. 6A). Next, we analyzed which of the four FF domains are required for eIF3A binding. As shown in Fig. 6B, of four GST proteins that each cover a single FF domain, only the one representing the first such domain brought down eIF3A. This first FF domain includes Tyr308, whose PDGF-stimulated phosphorylation was previously found to disrupt an interaction with transcription factor TFII-I (16Jiang W. Sordella R. Chen G.C. Hakre S. Roy A.L. Settleman J. An FF domain-dependent protein interaction mediates a signaling pathway for growth factor-induced gene expression.Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 23-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For this reason, and because growth factor stimulation appeared to cause an increase in the amount of several proteins associated with p190A (Table 1 and supplemental Table S1), we analyzed whether λ-phosphatase treatment of HeLa extracts prior to immunoprecipitation affected the p190A-eIF3A association. Arguing that phosphorylation of one or both proteins enhances their interaction, the amount of eIF3A co-precipitating with p190A was reduced by phosphatase treatment. The addition of a phosphatase inhibitor mixture partially, but reproducibly, prevented this reduction (Fig. 6, C and D). The interaction between p190A and TFII-I is disrupted by growth factor-stimulated Tyr308 phosphorylation (16Jiang W. Sordella R. Chen G.C. Hakre S. Roy A.L. Settleman J. An FF domain-dependent protein interaction mediates a signaling pathway for growth factor-induced gene expression.Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 23-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, non-phosphorylatable Y308A and phosphomimetic Y308D mutants of the p190A272–324-GST fusion protein representing the first FF domain, showed little difference in their ability to pulldown p190A (Fig. 7A). The only other p190A first FF domain residue identified as phosphorylated in the PhosphoSitePlus database is evolutionary conserved Ser296. Arguing that phosphorylation of Ser296 may enhance the interaction between p190A and eIF3A, a S296D phosphomimicking mutant retained the ability to pulldown eIF3A. However, this ability was abolished by S296A substitutions, either in the context of GST-FF1 or larger GST-FF1–4 fusion proteins (Fig. 7, A and B). To analyze whether Ser296 also affects the interaction between eIF3A and full-length p190A, we introduced the S296A and S296D mutations in full-length N terminally double HA-tagged transgenes. When an anti-HA antibody was used to precipitate these proteins from HeLa cells, the wild-type and S296D mutant proteins co-precipitated similar amounts of eIF3A, whereas no detectable eIF3A co-IPed with the S296A mutant (Fig. 7C). Finally, suggesting that p190A directly interacts with eIF3A, probing a blot of size fractionated HeLa proteins with a wild-type or S296A mutant p190A272–324-GST fusion protein, followed by detection of bound proteins with an anti-GST antibody, detected a 170-kDa protein (the size of eIF3A) with the wild-type but not with the mutant probe (Fig. 7D). The wild-type probe was also detected a smaller protein the identity of which remains unknown, but which may represent an eIF3A degradation product or one of the other five PCI domain-containing eIF3 subunits. Thus, we conclude that a single in vivo phosphorylated serine residue in the first FF domain plays an important role in promoting the interaction of p190A and eIF3A. Others previously found that p70 S6 kinase (S6K1) associates with the eIF3 complex in serum-starved cells, whereas an mTOR·Raptor·eIF3 complex was detectable upon serum stimulation (29Holz M.K. Ballif B.A. Gygi S.P. Blenis J. mTOR and S6K1 mediate assembly of the translation preinitiation complex through dynamic protein interchange and ordered phosphorylation events.Cell. 2005; 123: 569-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). Using co-IP, we confirmed the mutually exclusive serum-controlled interactions between eIF3A and S6K1 or mTOR (Fig. 8A). We then tested whether p190A was part of either the eIF3·S6K1 or eIF3·mTOR complex. Not surprising, given that no S6K1 or mTOR peptides were seen in our proteomic analyses, no interaction between S6K1 or mTOR and p190A was evident (Fig. 8B). Thus, eIF3 complexes containing S6K1, mTOR·Raptor, and p190A RhoGAP appear mutually exclusive. The regulation of eukaryotic mRNA translation occurs mainly at the ra"

Using the Serial Reaction Time Task in conjunction with Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, we investigated if improved visuomotor performance displayed in action video game players (actionVGPs) was associated with increased corticospinal plasticity in primary motor cortex (M1) compared to non-video game players (nonVGPs). Further, we assessed if actionVGPs and nonVGPs displayed differences in procedural motor learning as measured by the SRTT. We found that at the behavioral level, both the actionVGPs and nonVGPs showed evidence of procedural learning with no significant difference between groups. However, the actionVGPs displayed higher visuomotor performance as evidenced by faster reaction times in the SRTT. This observed enhancement in visuomotor performance amongst actionVGPs was associated with increased corticospinal plasticity in M1, as measured by corticospinal excitability changes pre- and post- SRTT and corticospinal excitability at rest before motor practice. Our results show that aVGPs, who are known to have better performance on visual and motor tasks, also display increased corticospinal excitability after completing a novel visuomotor task."

Latent profile analysis was applied to explore PTG latent profiles. Multinomial logistic regression was used to analyze the socio-demographic variables in each latent profile and the association between profile membership and resilience.Three latent profiles were identified and labeled the ""high appreciation-power group"" (30.6%), the ""general moderate growth group"" (47.7%) and the ""low growth and extreme possibility group"" (21.7%). Compared to those in the high appreciation-power group, individuals with monthly income >2000 ($312) were less likely to be in the general moderate growth group (OR = 0.13, P<0.01), whereas individuals with a spouse were less likely to be in the low growth and extreme possibility group (OR = 0.43, P<0.01). Individuals in the ""general moderate growth group""(OR = 0.92, P<0.01, 95%CI:0.89-0.94) and the ""low growth and extreme possibility"" groups (OR = 0.83, P<0.01, 95%CI:0.79-0.87) demonstrated significantly lower levels of resilience compared to the high appreciation-power group.The PTG patterns in only-child-lost parents were varied. Promoting resilience may be a way to foster these parents' PTG. Targeted intervention should be developed based on the characteristics of each latent class, and timely attention must be paid to the mental health of OCL parents who are without a spouse and have low income."
https://openalex.org/W2569992962,"Introduction Mobility is an essential part of a person’s functioning and independence. It encompasses locomotive functions, but also the more basic functions of positioning and transferring. Despite the availability of several mobility-related assessment instruments to date, there is a need for assessment instruments with the specific capability to display the full range of mobilisation. Our aim was to develop and validate a scoring instrument with hierarchical composition where every score value stands for a defined mobility level. Participants and Methods A previously developed and validated pilot instrument was applied to assess patients (n = 113) admitted to an acute rehabilitation programme. Mobility was assessed during admission, subsequently at weekly intervals and at discharge to acquire a detailed status of mobility at multiple time points and individual mobilisation profiles over time. The scoring instrument was then remodelled based on clinical criteria to establish an easy-to-use scoring system with hierarchical composition. Psychometric properties were calculated using an independent sample of 87 consecutive patients. Results Content validity could be affirmed. The psychometric tests demonstrated excellent convergent validity with the three mobility items of the Barthel Index (r = 0.93), despite an adequately lower correlation with the whole Barthel Index (r = 0.63). Adequate floor and ceiling effects (20%) and a large responsiveness to change (ǀdǀ = 1.7, p < 0.001) between admission and discharge values were demonstrated. Inter-rater reliability was excellent (κ = 0.88). Conclusions The Charité Mobility Index (CHARMI) is a promising, easy-to-use hierarchical scoring instrument assessing the full individual spectrum from immobility to unlimited mobility, including positioning, transfer and locomotion items. It allows for monitoring of mobilisation."
https://openalex.org/W2507113596,"In order to improve bitrates of lossless JPEG 2000, we propose to modify the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) by skipping selected steps of its computation. We employ a heuristic to construct the skipped steps DWT (SS-DWT) in an image-adaptive way and define fixed SS-DWT variants. For a large and diverse set of images, we find that SS-DWT significantly improves bitrates of non-photographic images. From a practical standpoint, the most interesting results are obtained by applying entropy estimation of coding effects for selecting among the fixed SS-DWT variants. This way we get the compression scheme that, as opposed to the general SS-DWT case, is compliant with the JPEG 2000 part 2 standard. It provides average bitrate improvement of roughly 5% for the entire test-set, whereas the overall compression time becomes only 3% greater than that of the unmodified JPEG 2000. Bitrates of photographic and non-photographic images are improved by roughly 0.5% and 14%, respectively. At a significantly increased cost of exploiting a heuristic, selecting the steps to be skipped based on the actual bitrate instead of an estimated one, and by applying reversible denoising and lifting steps to SS-DWT, we have attained greater bitrate improvements of up to about 17.5% for non-photographic images."
https://openalex.org/W2571131269,"During parasitoid development, the immature parasitoid is confined to the host species. As a result, any potential to modify the physiology or behaviour of the host could play an important role in parasitoid fitness. The potential for host manipulation by the aphid parasitoid Aphidius avenae to increase cold thermotolerance was investigated using the aphid host species Metopolophium dirhodum and Sitobion avenae. Aphids were parasitized at L3/L4 instar stage (5 d old) and allowed to develop into pre-reproductive adults (10 d old) containing a 5 d old parasitoid larva. A control group was created of non-parasitized pre-reproductive adults (10 d old). The inherent physiological thermotolerance (LT50) and potential behavioural thermoregulation (behaviour in a declining temperature regime) of parasitized and non-parasitized aphids were investigated. Results revealed no effect of parasitism on the physiological thermotolerance of S. avenae and M. dirhodum. Significant differences in the behaviour of parasitized and non-parasitized aphids were observed, in addition to differences between host species, and such behaviours are discussed in view of the potential for host manipulation."
https://openalex.org/W2564213693,"One of the challenges to maintain tsetse fly (Diptera: Glossinidae) colonies is the sustainable supply of high quality blood meals. The effect of using anticoagulants during collection of the blood, the addition of phagostimulants to the blood meals as well as using mixtures of bovine and porcine blood in different proportions for feeding on colony productivity was assessed. Defibrinated bovine blood was found to be suitable to maintain both the Glossina brevipalpis Newstead and Glossina austeni Newstead colonies. Blood collected with the anticoagulants sodium citrate, citric sodium combination, citrate phosphate dextrose adenine and citric acid did not affect colony performance of both species. Defibrinated bovine and porcine blood in a 1:1 ratio or the feeding of either bovine or porcine blood on alternating days improved pupae production of G. austeni and can be used to enhance colony growth. Bovine blood is appropriate to maintain G. brevipalpis colonies, however, feeding either bovine or porcine blood on alternating days did improve productivity. Adding the phagostimulants inosine tri-phosphate, cytosine mono-phosphate and guanosine mono-phosphate to the blood at a concentration of 10−4 M improved pupae production of the G. brevipalpis colony. The addition of adenosine tri-phosphate and inosine tri-phosphate improved the performance of the G. austeni colony. Decisions on the most suitable rearing diet and feeding protocols will not only depend on the biological requirements of the species but also on the continuous supply of a suitable blood source that can be collected and processed in a cost-effective way."
https://openalex.org/W2569056746,"Firms continuously search for external knowledge that can contribute to product innovation, which may ultimately increase market performance. The relationship between external knowledge sourcing and market performance is not well-documented. The extant literature primarily examines the causal relationship between external knowledge sources and product innovation performance or to identify factors which moderates the relationship between external knowledge sourcing and product innovation. Non-technological innovations, such as organization and marketing innovations, intervene in the process of external knowledge sourcing to product innovation to market performance but has not been extensively examined. This study addresses two research questions: does external knowledge sourcing lead to market performance and how does external knowledge sourcing interact with a firm's different innovation activities to enhance market performance. This study proposes a comprehensive model to capture the causal mechanism from external knowledge sourcing to market performance. The research model was tested using survey data from manufacturing firms in South Korea and the results demonstrate a strong statistical relationship in the path of external knowledge sourcing (EKS) to product innovation performance (PIP) to market performance (MP). Organizational innovation is an antecedent to EKS while marketing innovation is a consequence of EKS, which significantly influences PIP and MP. The results imply that any potential EKS effort should also consider organizational innovations which may ultimately enhance market performance. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed as well as concluding remarks."
https://openalex.org/W2570076876,"Do scaling relations always provide the means to anticipate the relationships between the size of cities, costs of maintenance, and the socio-economic benefits resulting from their growth? Scaling laws are considered a universal principle that describes the development of complex systems such as cities. It seems that regardless of their location or history, the growth of cities is associated with the super-linear or sublinear scaling of features such as the amount of space required, infrastructure, or human activities. However, the results of our research, based on grouping by Self-Organizing Maps, reveal some limitations in the application of scaling laws: the trends of urban growth behave in a different manner when we consider both a large and diverse collection of cities and a subset of cities alike. This finding complements the existing body of knowledge on the growth of cities and allows for a more accurate prediction of their future."
https://openalex.org/W2570502010,"Purpose Cushing’s disease (CD), also known as pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism, is caused by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-secreting pituitary tumours. Affected humans and dogs have similar clinical manifestations, however, the incidence of the canine disease is thousand-fold higher. This makes the dog an obvious model for studying the pathogenesis of pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism. Despite certain similarities identified at the molecular level, the question still remains whether the two species have a shared oncogenetic background. Recently, hotspot recurrent mutations in the gene encoding for ubiquitin specific protease 8 (USP8) have been identified as the main driver behind the formation of ACTH-secreting pituitary adenomas in humans. In this study, we aimed to verify whether USP8 mutations also play a role in the development of such tumours in dogs. Methods Presence of USP8 mutations was analysed by Sanger and PCR-cloning sequencing in 38 canine ACTH-secreting adenomas. Furthermore, the role of USP8 and EGFR protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry in a subset of 25 adenomas. Results None of the analysed canine ACTH-secreting adenomas presented mutations in the USP8 gene. In a subset of these adenomas, however, we observed an increased nuclear expression of USP8, a phenotype characteristic for the USP8 mutated human tumours, that correlated with smaller tumour size but elevated ACTH production in those tumours. Conclusions Canine ACTH-secreting pituitary adenomas lack mutations in the USP8 gene suggesting a different genetic background of pituitary tumourigenesis in dogs. However, elevated nuclear USP8 protein expression in a subset of tumours was associated with a similar phenotype as in their human counterparts, indicating a possible end-point convergence of the different genetic backgrounds in the two species. In order to establish the dog as a useful animal model for the study of CD, further comprehensive studies are needed."
https://openalex.org/W2570584929,"Scaling laws characterize diverse complex systems in a broad range of fields, including physics, biology, finance, and social science. The human language is another example of a complex system of words organization. Studies on written texts have shown that scaling laws characterize the occurrence frequency of words, words rank, and the growth of distinct words with increasing text length. However, these studies have mainly concentrated on the western linguistic systems, and the laws that govern the lexical organization, structure and dynamics of the Chinese language remain not well understood. Here we study a database of Chinese and English language books. We report that three distinct scaling laws characterize words organization in the Chinese language. We find that these scaling laws have different exponents and crossover behaviors compared to English texts, indicating different words organization and dynamics of words in the process of text growth. We propose a stochastic feedback model of words organization and text growth, which successfully accounts for the empirically observed scaling laws with their corresponding scaling exponents and characteristic crossover regimes. Further, by varying key model parameters, we reproduce differences in the organization and scaling laws of words between the Chinese and English language. We also identify functional relationships between model parameters and the empirically observed scaling exponents, thus providing new insights into the words organization and growth dynamics in the Chinese and English language."
https://openalex.org/W2561306650,"Prenyltransferases of the dimethylallyltryptophan synthase (DMATS) superfamily catalyze the attachment of prenyl or prenyl-like moieties to diverse acceptor compounds. These acceptor molecules are generally aromatic in nature and mostly indole or indole-like. Their catalytic transformation represents a major skeletal diversification step in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, including the indole alkaloids. DMATS enzymes thus contribute significantly to the biological and pharmacological diversity of small molecule metabolites. Understanding the substrate specificity of these enzymes could create opportunities for their biocatalytic use in preparing complex synthetic scaffolds. However, there has been no framework to achieve this in a rational way. Here, we report a chemoinformatic pipeline to enable prenyltransferase substrate prediction. We systematically catalogued 32 unique prenyltransferases and 167 unique substrates to create possible reaction matrices and compiled these data into a browsable database named PrenDB. We then used a newly developed algorithm based on molecular fragmentation to automatically extract reactive chemical epitopes. The analysis of the collected data sheds light on the thus far explored substrate space of DMATS enzymes. To assess the predictive performance of our virtual reaction extraction tool, 38 potential substrates were tested as prenyl acceptors in assays with three prenyltransferases, and we were able to detect turnover in >55% of the cases. The database, PrenDB (www.kolblab.org/prendb.php), enables the prediction of potential substrates for chemoenzymatic synthesis through substructure similarity and virtual chemical transformation techniques. It aims at making prenyltransferases and their highly regio- and stereoselective reactions accessible to the research community for integration in synthetic work flows.

https://openalex.org/W2564098617,"Objectives To validate trajectories of late-life mobility change using a novel approach designed to overcome the constraints of modest sample size and few follow-up time points. Methods Using clinical reasoning and distribution-based methodology, we identified trajectories of mobility change (Late Life Function and Disability Instrument) across 2 years in 391 participants age ≥65 years from a prospective cohort study designed to identify modifiable impairments predictive of mobility in late-life. We validated our approach using model fit indices and comparing baseline mobility-related factors between trajectories. Results Model fit indices confirmed that the optimal number of trajectories were between 4 and 6. Mobility-related factors varied across trajectories with the most unfavorable values in poor mobility trajectories and the most favorable in high mobility trajectories. These factors included leg strength, trunk extension endurance, knee flexion range of motion, limb velocity, physical performance measures, and the number and prevalence of medical conditions including osteoarthritis and back pain. Conclusions Our findings support the validity of this approach and may facilitate the investigation of a broader scope of research questions within aging populations of varied sizes and traits."
https://openalex.org/W2567471918,"Recycling of cargos from early endosomes requires regulation of endosomal tubule formation and fission. This regulation is disrupted in cells depleted of the microtubule severing enzyme spastin, causing elongation of endosomal tubules and mis-trafficking of recycling endosomal cargos such as the transferrin receptor. Spastin is encoded by SPAST, mutations in which are the most frequent cause of autosomal dominant hereditary spastic paraplegia, a condition characterised by a progressive loss of lower limb function resulting from upper motor neuron axonopathy. Investigation of molecular factors involved in endosomal tubule regulation is hindered by the need for manual counting of endosomal tubules. We report here the development of an open source automated system for the quantification of endosomal tubules, using ImageJ and R. We validate the method in cells depleted of spastin and its binding partner IST1. The additional speed and reproducibility of this system compared with manual counting makes feasible screens of candidates to further understand the mechanisms of endosomal tubule formation and fission."
https://openalex.org/W2571158819,"Systemic vascular dysfunction has been suggested to contribute to glaucomatous damage. Albuminuria is a surrogate marker of endothelial injury, including vessels. However, their relationship is not well understood. This study aimed to investigate the association between albuminuria and the prevalence of open-angle glaucoma (OAG) in nondiabetic subjects.We conducted a cross-sectional study of 4186 nondiabetic participants aged 19 years or older from the 2011-2012 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. OAG was defined based on the criteria of the International Society for Geographic and Epidemiologic Ophthalmology. Urinary albumin excretion was assessed by the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR). A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between albuminuria and OAG.Among the subjects, 124 had OAG. The weighted prevalences of microalbuminuria (UACR of 30-299 mg/g creatinine [Cr]) and macroalbuminuria (UACR ≥ 300 mg/g Cr) were 3.2 ± 0.3% and 0.4 ± 0.1%, respectively. The percentages of OAG increased in accordance with increasing UACR tertiles. Compared with subjects in the lower UACR tertile, those in the upper tertile showed an increased prevalence of OAG (odds ratio, 1.963; 95% confidence interval 1.072-3.595, P = 0.029) after adjusting for demographic factors, laboratory parameters, kidney function, and intraocular pressure. Furthermore, even after excluding 155 subjects with microalbuminuria and 19 subjects with macroalbuminuria, a positive association persisted between the upper UACR tertile (low-grade albuminuria) and an increased prevalence of OAG (odds ratio, 2.170; 95% confidence interval, 1.174-4.010, P = 0.014).Albuminuria, even low-grade, was significantly associated with OAG in nondiabetic subjects. This result implies the role of vascular endothelial dysfunction in the pathogenic mechanism of OAG and suggests that careful monitoring of OAG is required in nondiabetic subjects with albuminuria."
https://openalex.org/W2563009490,"Meiotic recombination occurs as a programmed event that initiates by the formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) that give rise to the formation of crossovers that are observed as chiasmata. Chiasmata are essential for the accurate chromosome segregation and the generation of new combinations of parental alleles. Some treatments that provoke exogenous DSBs also lead to alterations in the recombination pattern of some species in which full homologous synapsis is achieved at pachytene. We have carried out a similar approach in males of the grasshopper Stethophyma grossum, whose homologues show incomplete synapsis and proximal chiasma localization. After irradiating males with γ rays we have studied the distribution of both the histone variant γ-H2AX and the recombinase RAD51. These proteins are cytological markers of DSBs at early prophase I. We have inferred synaptonemal complex (SC) formation via identification of SMC3 and RAD 21 cohesin subunits. Whereas thick and thin SMC3 filaments would correspond to synapsed and unsynapsed regions, the presence of RAD21 is only restricted to synapsed regions. Results show that irradiated spermatocytes maintain restricted synapsis between homologues. However, the frequency and distribution of chiasmata in metaphase I bivalents is slightly changed and quadrivalents were also observed. These results could be related to the singular nuclear polarization displayed by the spermatocytes of this species."
https://openalex.org/W2570713716,"During vertebrate embryonic development, early skin, muscle, and bone progenitor populations organize into segments known as somites. Defects in this conserved process of segmentation lead to skeletal and muscular deformities, such as congenital scoliosis, a curvature of the spine caused by vertebral defects. Environmental stresses such as hypoxia or heat shock produce segmentation defects, and significantly increase the penetrance and severity of vertebral defects in genetically susceptible individuals. Here we show that a brief exposure to a high osmolarity solution causes reproducible segmentation defects in developing zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos. Both osmotic shock and heat shock produce border defects in a dose-dependent manner, with an increase in both frequency and severity of defects. We also show that osmotic treatment has a delayed effect on somite development, similar to that observed in heat shocked embryos. Our results establish osmotic shock as an alternate experimental model for stress, affecting segmentation in a manner comparable to other known environmental stressors. The similar effects of these two distinct environmental stressors support a model in which a variety of cellular stresses act through a related response pathway that leads to disturbances in the segmentation process."
