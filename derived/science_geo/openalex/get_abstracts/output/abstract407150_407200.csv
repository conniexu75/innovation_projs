https://openalex.org/W2044670534,"Creating a robust synthetic surface that repels various liquids would have broad technological implications for areas ranging from biomedical devices and fuel transport to architecture but has proved extremely challenging. Inspirations from natural nonwetting structures, particularly the leaves of the lotus, have led to the development of liquid-repellent microtextured surfaces that rely on the formation of a stable air-liquid interface. Despite over a decade of intense research, these surfaces are, however, still plagued with problems that restrict their practical applications: limited oleophobicity with high contact angle hysteresis, failure under pressure and upon physical damage, inability to self-heal and high production cost. To address these challenges, here we report a strategy to create self-healing, slippery liquid-infused porous surface(s) (SLIPS) with exceptional liquid- and ice-repellency, pressure stability and enhanced optical transparency. Our approach-inspired by Nepenthes pitcher plants-is conceptually different from the lotus effect, because we use nano/microstructured substrates to lock in place the infused lubricating fluid. We define the requirements for which the lubricant forms a stable, defect-free and inert 'slippery' interface. This surface outperforms its natural counterparts and state-of-the-art synthetic liquid-repellent surfaces in its capability to repel various simple and complex liquids (water, hydrocarbons, crude oil and blood), maintain low contact angle hysteresis (<2.5°), quickly restore liquid-repellency after physical damage (within 0.1-1 s), resist ice adhesion, and function at high pressures (up to about 680 atm). We show that these properties are insensitive to the precise geometry of the underlying substrate, making our approach applicable to various inexpensive, low-surface-energy structured materials (such as porous Teflon membrane). We envision that these slippery surfaces will be useful in fluid handling and transportation, optical sensing, medicine, and as self-cleaning and anti-fouling materials operating in extreme environments."
https://openalex.org/W2140803428,"Previous analyses of relations, divergence times, and diversification patterns among extant mammalian families have relied on supertree methods and local molecular clocks. We constructed a molecular supermatrix for mammalian families and analyzed these data with likelihood-based methods and relaxed molecular clocks. Phylogenetic analyses resulted in a robust phylogeny with better resolution than phylogenies from supertree methods. Relaxed clock analyses support the long-fuse model of diversification and highlight the importance of including multiple fossil calibrations that are spread across the tree. Molecular time trees and diversification analyses suggest important roles for the Cretaceous Terrestrial Revolution and Cretaceous-Paleogene (KPg) mass extinction in opening up ecospace that promoted interordinal and intraordinal diversification, respectively. By contrast, diversification analyses provide no support for the hypothesis concerning the delayed rise of present-day mammals during the Eocene Period."
https://openalex.org/W2092894985,"The instruction of the immune system to be tolerant of self, thereby preventing autoimmunity, is facilitated by the education of T cells in a specialized organ, the thymus, in which self-reactive cells are either eliminated or differentiated into tolerogenic Foxp3(+) regulatory T (T(reg)) cells. However, it is unknown whether T cells are also educated to be tolerant of foreign antigens, such as those from commensal bacteria, to prevent immunopathology such as inflammatory bowel disease. Here we show that encounter with commensal microbiota results in the peripheral generation of T(reg) cells rather than pathogenic effectors. We observed that colonic T(reg) cells used T-cell antigen receptors (TCRs) different from those used by T(reg) cells in other locations, implying an important role for local antigens in shaping the colonic T(reg)-cell population. Many of the local antigens seemed to be derived from commensal bacteria, on the basis of the in vitro reactivity of common colon T(reg) TCRs. These TCRs did not facilitate thymic T(reg)-cell development, implying that many colonic T(reg) cells arise instead by means of antigen-driven peripheral T(reg)-cell development. Further analysis of two of these TCRs by the creation of retroviral bone marrow chimaeras and a TCR transgenic line revealed that microbiota indigenous to our mouse colony was required for the generation of colonic T(reg) cells from otherwise naive T cells. If T cells expressing these TCRs fail to undergo T(reg)-cell development and instead become effector cells, they have the potential to induce colitis, as evidenced by adoptive transfer studies. These results suggest that the efficient peripheral generation of antigen-specific populations of T(reg) cells in response to an individual's microbiota provides important post-thymic education of the immune system to foreign antigens, thereby providing tolerance to commensal microbiota."

https://openalex.org/W2104211686,"Understanding spatial variation in biodiversity along environmental gradients is a central theme in ecology. Differences in species compositional turnover among sites (β diversity) occurring along gradients are often used to infer variation in the processes structuring communities. Here, we show that sampling alone predicts changes in β diversity caused simply by changes in the sizes of species pools. For example, forest inventories sampled along latitudinal and elevational gradients show the well-documented pattern that β diversity is higher in the tropics and at low elevations. However, after correcting for variation in pooled species richness (γ diversity), these differences in β diversity disappear. Therefore, there is no need to invoke differences in the mechanisms of community assembly in temperate versus tropical systems to explain these global-scale patterns of β diversity."

https://openalex.org/W2074974899,"Overexpression of sirtuins (NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylases) has been reported to increase lifespan in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. Studies of the effects of genes on ageing are vulnerable to confounding effects of genetic background. Here we re-examined the reported effects of sirtuin overexpression on ageing and found that standardization of genetic background and the use of appropriate controls abolished the apparent effects in both C. elegans and Drosophila. In C. elegans, outcrossing of a line with high-level sir-2.1 overexpression abrogated the longevity increase, but did not abrogate sir-2.1 overexpression. Instead, longevity co-segregated with a second-site mutation affecting sensory neurons. Outcrossing of a line with low-copy-number sir-2.1 overexpression also abrogated longevity. A Drosophila strain with ubiquitous overexpression of dSir2 using the UAS-GAL4 system was long-lived relative to wild-type controls, as previously reported, but was not long-lived relative to the appropriate transgenic controls, and nor was a new line with stronger overexpression of dSir2. These findings underscore the importance of controlling for genetic background and for the mutagenic effects of transgene insertions in studies of genetic effects on lifespan. The life-extending effect of dietary restriction on ageing in Drosophila has also been reported to be dSir2 dependent. We found that dietary restriction increased fly lifespan independently of dSir2. Our findings do not rule out a role for sirtuins in determination of metazoan lifespan, but they do cast doubt on the robustness of the previously reported effects of sirtuins on lifespan in C. elegans and Drosophila."
https://openalex.org/W1984279171,"Initialization and read-out of coupled quantum systems are essential ingredients for the implementation of quantum algorithms. Single-shot read-out of the state of a multi-quantum-bit (multi-qubit) register would allow direct investigation of quantum correlations (entanglement), and would give access to further key resources such as quantum error correction and deterministic quantum teleportation. Although spins in solids are attractive candidates for scalable quantum information processing, their single-shot detection has been achieved only for isolated qubits. Here we demonstrate the preparation and measurement of a multi-spin quantum register in a low-temperature solid-state system by implementing resonant optical excitation techniques originally developed in atomic physics. We achieve high-fidelity read-out of the electronic spin associated with a single nitrogen-vacancy centre in diamond, and use this read-out to project up to three nearby nuclear spin qubits onto a well-defined state. Conversely, we can distinguish the state of the nuclear spins in a single shot by mapping it onto, and subsequently measuring, the electronic spin. Finally, we show compatibility with qubit control: we demonstrate initialization, coherent manipulation and single-shot read-out in a single experiment on a two-qubit register, using techniques suitable for extension to larger registers. These results pave the way for a test of Bell's inequalities on solid-state spins and the implementation of measurement-based quantum information protocols."

https://openalex.org/W2161606262,"Bacteria and archaea acquire resistance to viruses and plasmids by integrating short fragments of foreign DNA into clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs). These repetitive loci maintain a genetic record of all prior encounters with foreign transgressors. CRISPRs are transcribed and the long primary transcript is processed into a library of short CRISPR-derived RNAs (crRNAs) that contain a unique sequence complementary to a foreign nucleic-acid challenger. In Escherichia coli, crRNAs are incorporated into a multisubunit surveillance complex called Cascade (CRISPR-associated complex for antiviral defence), which is required for protection against bacteriophages. Here we use cryo-electron microscopy to determine the subnanometre structures of Cascade before and after binding to a target sequence. These structures reveal a sea-horse-shaped architecture in which the crRNA is displayed along a helical arrangement of protein subunits that protect the crRNA from degradation while maintaining its availability for base pairing. Cascade engages invading nucleic acids through high-affinity base-pairing interactions near the 5' end of the crRNA. Base pairing extends along the crRNA, resulting in a series of short helical segments that trigger a concerted conformational change. This conformational rearrangement may serve as a signal that recruits a trans-acting nuclease (Cas3) for destruction of invading nucleic-acid sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2152243497,"Humans have retained only one functional chemosensing organ, the nose, but many terrestrial vertebrates also rely on a secondary system, the vomeronasal organ. Its primary role is to mediate the social and defensive responses to chemical signals emitted from either conspecifics (pheromones) or animals from other species (kairomones). Catherine Dulac and colleagues have now identified a series of chemoreceptor proteins that respond specifically to subsets of chemical cues produced by potential sexual partners or aggressors, and possible prey or predators. The 'de-orphaning' of close to a hundred vomeronasal receptors paves the way for further dissection of the neural circuits that control innate behaviours in response to socially relevant chemical signals. The vomeronasal organ (VNO) has a key role in mediating the social and defensive responses of many terrestrial vertebrates to species- and sex-specific chemosignals1. More than 250 putative pheromone receptors have been identified in the mouse VNO2,3, but the nature of the signals detected by individual VNO receptors has not yet been elucidated. To gain insight into the molecular logic of VNO detection leading to mating, aggression or defensive responses, we sought to uncover the response profiles of individual vomeronasal receptors to a wide range of animal cues. Here we describe the repertoire of behaviourally and physiologically relevant stimuli detected by a large number of individual vomeronasal receptors in mice, and define a global map of vomeronasal signal detection. We demonstrate that the two classes (V1R and V2R) of vomeronasal receptors use fundamentally different strategies to encode chemosensory information, and that distinct receptor subfamilies have evolved towards the specific recognition of certain animal groups or chemical structures. The association of large subsets of vomeronasal receptors with cognate, ethologically and physiologically relevant stimuli establishes the molecular foundation of vomeronasal information coding, and opens new avenues for further investigating the neural mechanisms underlying behaviour specificity."

https://openalex.org/W2084599676,"Electrons in a metal are indistinguishable particles that interact strongly with other electrons and their environment. Isolating and detecting a single flying electron after propagation, in a similar manner to quantum optics experiments with single photons, is therefore a challenging task. So far only a few experiments have been performed in a high-mobility two-dimensional electron gas in which the electron propagates almost ballistically. In these previous works, flying electrons were detected by means of the current generated by an ensemble of electrons, and electron correlations were encrypted in the current noise. Here we demonstrate the experimental realization of high-efficiency single-electron source and detector for a single electron propagating isolated from the other electrons through a one-dimensional channel. The moving potential is excited by a surface acoustic wave, which carries the single electron along the one-dimensional channel at a speed of 3 μm ns(-1). When this quantum channel is placed between two quantum dots several micrometres apart, a single electron can be transported from one quantum dot to the other with quantum efficiencies of emission and detection of 96% and 92%, respectively. Furthermore, the transfer of the electron can be triggered on a timescale shorter than the coherence time T(2)* of GaAs spin qubits. Our work opens new avenues with which to study the teleportation of a single electron spin and the distant interaction between spatially separated qubits in a condensed-matter system."
https://openalex.org/W2111116951,"Single-electron circuits of the future, consisting of a network of quantum dots, will require a mechanism to transport electrons from one functional part to another. For example, in a quantum computer[1] decoherence and circuit complexity can be reduced by separating qubit manipulation from measurement and by providing some means to transport electrons from one to the other.[2] Tunnelling between neighbouring dots has been demonstrated[3, 4] with great control, and the manipulation of electrons in single and double-dot systems is advancing rapidly.[5-8] For distances greater than a few hundred nanometres neither free propagation nor tunnelling are viable whilst maintaining confinement of single electrons. Here we show how a single electron may be captured in a surface acoustic wave minimum and transferred from one quantum dot to a second unoccupied dot along a long empty channel. The transfer direction may be reversed and the same electron moved back and forth over sixty times without error, a cumulative distance of 0.25 mm. Such on-chip transfer extends communication between quantum dots to a range that may allow the integration of discrete quantum information-processing components and devices."

The increase in N availability within the study area was mainly driven by increasing N concentrations and was most likely due to deposition of pollutant nitrogen from atmospheric sources. Atmospheric nitrogen deposition had a high temporal correlation with N availability in the study area (r = 0.74 to 0.88), except in selected areas wherein riverine nitrogen load may be of equal importance. The increase in N availability caused by atmospheric deposition and riverine input has switched extensive parts of the study area from being N-limited to P-limited."

https://openalex.org/W2109356273,"Glucocorticoids have long been recognized as powerful anti-inflammatory compounds that are one of the most widely prescribed classes of drugs in the world. However, their role in the regulation of innate immunity is not well understood. We sought to examine the effects of glucocorticoids on the NOD-like receptors (NLRs), a central component of the inflammasome and innate immunity. Surprisingly, we show that glucocorticoids induce both NLRP3 messenger RNA and protein, which is a critical component of the inflammasome. The glucocorticoid-dependent induction of NLRP3 sensitizes the cells to extracellular ATP and significantly enhances the ATP-mediated release of proinflammatory molecules, including mature IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6. This effect was specific for glucocorticoids and dependent on the glucocorticoid receptor. These studies demonstrate a novel role for glucocorticoids in sensitizing the initial inflammatory response by the innate immune system."

Consequently, it is essential to elucidate the signaling pathways regulating the expression of IFN-induced miRNAs as well as the cellular pathways that these miRNAs regulate to determine their role in cancer. One possibility is that, whereas some IFN-induced pathways may inhibit tumorigenesis, other pathways are protumorigenic. For example, the apoptotic action of IFN is balanced by the induction of a potent IFN-induced cell survival pathway (15Yang C.H. Murti A. Pfeffer S.R. Basu L. Kim J.G. Pfeffer L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Quantitative real time-PCR (qPCR) was performed using gene-specific primers (sequences in supplemental Table S2) on the iCyclerIQ detection system (Bio-Rad) using iScript One-Step RT-PCR kit with SYBR Green (Bio-Rad). Reaction parameters were as follows: cDNA synthesis at 50 °C for 10 min, iScript reverse transcriptase inactivation at 95 °C for 5 min, PCR cycling at 95 °C for 10 s and 60 °C for 30 s for 40 cycles. Gene expression data were normalized to the expression of the β-actin housekeeping gene. The relative units were calculated from a standard curve, plotting three different concentrations against the PCR cycle number at the cycle threshold (with a 10-fold increment equivalent to ∼3.1 cycles). C57BL/6 mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, and housed in a pathogen-free animal facility. All experimental procedures involving animals in this study were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Tennessee Health Science Center. Mice were injected via tail vein with a single cell suspension of B16 melanoma cells (1 × 106) in 0.2 ml of culture medium. For survival analysis mice were observed daily after injection and were sacrificed at the first sign of shortness of breath, decreased locomotion, or reduced body weight (>20% of total body weight). For bioluminescence imaging, mice were injected intraperitoneally with d-luciferin, anesthetized in an O2-rich induction chamber with 2% isoflurane, and imaged using the Xenogen in vivo imaging system (IVIS; Xenogen, Alameda, CA). Photonic emissions were assessed using Living image® 3.2 software, and the data are presented as pseudocolor representations of light intensity. A minimum of three independent experiments was performed at least in duplicate. Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test. p values of <0.05 (*), <0.01 (**), and <0.001 (***) were considered significant. We previously showed that IFN induced miR-21 expression in various mammalian cells including mouse B16 cells (10Yang C.H. Yue J. Fan M. Pfeffer L.M. Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 8108-8116Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To characterize IFN induction further, RNA was prepared from B16 cells treated with murine IFN (1,000 units/ml) for varying times, and miR-21 expression was determined by qPCR. IFN rapidly induced miR-21 expression in B16 melanoma cells with a time course of induction similar to that of the IFN-induced gene ISG15 (Fig. 1A). IFN induced miR-21 and ISG15 expression within 2 h after IFN addition, with maximal levels attained by 6 h, and expression remained high for up to 48 h. To characterize the dose dependence of IFN induction of miR-21, RNA was prepared from B16 cells treated with varying IFN concentrations for 6 h, and gene expression was determined by qPCR. As shown in Fig. 1B, both miR-21 and ISG15 levels were increased by IFN at concentrations between 10 and 1,000 units/ml. Because STAT3 appears to play a role in regulating miR-21 expression (10Yang C.H. Yue J. Fan M. Pfeffer L.M. Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 8108-8116Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), we next examined the role of STAT3 in IFN-induced miRNA expression by expressing a construct where the canonical tyrosine 705 phosphorylation site was mutated to phenylalanine (F705-STAT3). F705-STAT3 expression in B16 cells blocked not only IFN-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 (Fig. 2A), but also IFN-induced miR-21 expression (Fig. 2B). miR-196a, miR-296, and miR-351 were previously found to be induced by IFN in Huh7 human hepatoma cells (14Pedersen I.M. Cheng G. Wieland S. Volinia S. Croce C.M. Chisari F.V. David M. Nature. 2007; 449: 919-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar), but the role of STAT3 in their IFN-induced expression had not been explored. We found that although expression of F705-STAT3 also blocked the IFN induction of miR-351 and miR-296 in B16 melanoma cells (Fig. 2B), it had no effect on IFN-induced miR-196a expression. Therefore, these results indicate that the expression of a subset of IFN-inducible miRNAs (miR-21, miR-351, and miR-296) is highly dependent on STAT3 activation. To characterize the biological role of miR-21, B16 cells were transduced with an antagomiR-21 lentivirus (10Yang C.H. Yue J. Fan M. Pfeffer L.M. Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 8108-8116Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) or a lentivirus containing empty vector (EV), and stable pools of cells were isolated. AntagomiR-21 transduced cells (miR-21KD) showed an ∼75% knockdown in miR-21 expression relative to EV-transduced cells (Fig. 3A). In contrast, knockdown of miR21 had little effect on the basal and IFN-induced expression of other miRNAs (miR-196a, miR-296, and miR-351), as well as on the IFN-induced expression of MyD88, Ifi203, Cxcl11, and Il6 (Fig. 3B). These results demonstrate that antagomiR-21 was highly specific, i.e. selectively knocked down miR-21 expression, but had little (or no) effect on the expression of other miRNAs or IFN-induced genes. We then studied the effects of miR-21 knockdown on B16 cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration. As shown in Fig. 4A, knockdown of miR-21 in B16 cells reduced cell proliferation, indicating that miR-21 plays an important role in melanoma cell proliferation. Because IFN has known potent antiproliferative activity (11Pfeffer L.M. Dinarello C.A. Herberman R.B. Williams B.R. Borden E.C. Bordens R. Walter M.R. Nagabhushan T.L. Trotta P.P. Pestka S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2489-2499PubMed Google Scholar), it was not surprising that IFN treatment inhibited B16 cell proliferation. However, the combination of miR-21 knockdown and IFN treatment markedly reduced the proliferation of B16 cells. Because we previously found that miR-21KD sensitized prostate cancer cells to IFN-induced apoptosis (10Yang C.H. Yue J. Fan M. Pfeffer L.M. Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 8108-8116Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), we next examined the effect of miR-21 expression on B16 cell apoptosis as determined by ELISA and Annexin V staining. Although IFN treatment or miR-21KD alone had only negligible effects on the level of apoptosis in B16 cells, IFN treatment of miR-21KD B16 cells induced significant apoptosis (Fig. 4B). We next determined the roles of miR-21 expression and IFN treatment on cell migration by transwell assays and found that both miR-21KD and IFN treatment significantly inhibited B16 cell migration (Fig. 4C). Moreover, the combination of miR-21 knockdown and IFN treatment further reduced B16 cell migration. Taken together, our results indicate that miR-21 knockdown enhances the sensitivity of B16 cells to IFN-induced apoptosis, as well as basal and IFN-induced inhibition of cell proliferation and migration. miRNAs negatively regulate the expression of multiple genes post-transcriptionally by binding to the 3′-untranslated region of target mRNAs, thereby decreasing the expression of selective target proteins. A number of potential miR-21 targets have been described in the literature, including the tumor suppressors PTEN and PDCD4, and the antiproliferative proteins BTG2 and SPRY2 (23Meng F. Henson R.

Med. 2009; 13: 39-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). To identify miR-21 targets in vitro, cell lysates were prepared from EV and miR-21KD B16 cells and subjected to immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 4D, miR-21 knockdown in B16 cells resulted in increased levels of PTEN, PDCD4, and BTG2 but had no effect on SPRY2 levels, indicating that PTEN, PDCD4, and BTG2 are miR-21 targets in B16 cells, whereas SPRY2 is not. It is important to note that, whereas miR-21 knockdown did not affect PDCD4 levels in DU145 cells (10Yang C.H. Yue J. Fan M. Pfeffer L.M. Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 8108-8116Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), miR-21 knockdown resulted in enhanced PDCD4 levels in B16 melanoma cells, demonstrating that miR-21 targets are cell type-dependent. B16 melanoma cells have the propensity to form lung metastases when injected in mice and thus are a well studied model for melanoma metastasis (18Poste G. Doll J. Brown A.E. Tzeng J. Zeidman I. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 2770-2778PubMed Google Scholar, 19Nicolson G.L. Brunson K.W. Fidler I.J. Cancer Res. 1978; 38: 4105-4111PubMed Google Scholar, 20Nicolson G.L. Sci. Am. 1979; 240: 66-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to characterize the role of miR-21 further by examining the metastatic properties of B16 cells in vivo. In brief, B16 cells (EV and miR-21KD) were transduced with Luc-2 for bioluminescent imaging and introduced directly into the bloodstream of syngeneic C57BL/6 mice by tail vein injection. Bioluminescent imaging at 1 day after injection showed that equivalent numbers of B16 melanoma cells could be detected in the lungs of mice injected with EV or miR-21KD cells (1.55 ± 0.52 versus 1.14 ± 0.15 × 104 photons/s per cm2, respectively). At 16 days after injection a strong luciferase signal was detected in the lungs of 8 of 8 mice injected with EV-transduced B16 cells, representing a 2,360-fold increase in bioluminescent signal intensity relative to that of the day 1 signal (Fig. 5A). In contrast, at 16 days after injection a relatively weak signal was detected in the lungs of mice injected with miR-21KD B16 cells, which represented only a ∼4-fold increase in signal intensity relative to the day 1 values. As further evidence of the altered metastatic potential of miR-21KD cells, knockdown of miR-21 markedly prolonged the survival of mice injected with B16 cells (Fig. 5B). Mice injected with EV-transduced cells had a mean survival of 18 days, whereas mice injected with miR-21KD B16 cells had a mean survival of 29.5 days. As additional evidence of tumor burden, the mean body weight of mice injected with EV-transduced cells was reduced by ∼20% at 18 days after injection, whereas mice injected with miR-21KD cells exhibited a 25% increase in body weight (Fig. 5C). Upon necropsy, mice injected with EV-transduced B16 cells exhibited large melanocytic tumors in their lungs, whereas mice injected with miR-21KD cells exhibited only small melanocytic nodules (supplemental Fig. S1A). Histological staining of lung tissue with H&E showed that EV-tumor bearing mice had widespread replacement of the pulmonary parenchyma with the metastatic neoplasm (supplemental Fig. S1B). In contrast, lung tissue of mice injected with miR-21KD cells exhibited relatively normal bronchial and vascular structures with minor metastatic deposits that measured 1–2 mm in diameter. In the present study, we identified a new link between miR-21 and the metastatic behavior of melanoma cells. We show that upon tail vein injection, vector control B16 melanoma cells selectively home to the lung, forming rather large tumors, which is entirely consistent with previous studies (18Poste G. Doll J. Brown A.E. Tzeng J. Zeidman I. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 2770-2778PubMed Google Scholar, 19Nicolson G.L. Brunson K.W. Fidler I.J. Cancer Res. 1978; 38: 4105-4111PubMed Google Scholar, 20Nicolson G.L. Sci. Am. 1979; 240: 66-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, B16 cells with miR-21 knocked down also home to the lung but only form micrometastases. Moreover, there was a significant increase in the mean survival of the mice injected with miR-21KD B16 cells. Taken together, these data demonstrate that miR-21 knockdown results in a diminished metastatic potential of B16 cells. Metastasis is a major cause of cancer-related death, especially in melanoma. Thus, our finding that miR-21 promotes the metastatic properties of melanoma has important clinical implications. Previous studies have indicated that miR-21 plays an important role in tumor metastasis. For example, tail vein injection of miR-21KD MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells showed a significant reduction in the number of lung metastases, but the survival of the injected mice was not examined (8Zhu S. Wu H. Wu F. Nie D. Sheng S. Mo Y.Y. Cell Res. 2008; 18: 350-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). Relatively high miR-21 levels have been found in a variety of solid cancers (lung, prostate, breast, colon, stomach, liver) and hematological malignancies (1Bartel D.P. Cell. 2004; 116: 281-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29863) Google Scholar, 2Calin G.A. Croce C.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 857-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (6666) Google Scholar, 3Si M.L. Zhu S. Wu H. Lu Z. Wu F. Mo Y.Y. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 2799-2803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar). The role of STAT3 in the expression of the oncomir miR-21 as well as in other STAT3-dependent miRNAs such as miR-296 and miR-351 is particularly important because constitutive activation of STAT3 has been demonstrated in a large number of diverse human tumors, and considerable evidence suggests that constitutive STAT3 activation actively participates in tumor formation and progression (27Turkson J. Jove R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6613-6626Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 28Bowman T. Garcia R. Turkson J. Jove R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2474-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1593) Google Scholar). The role of miR-21 in skin cancer is relatively uncharacterized. The oncogenic properties of miR-21 have been extensively studied in vitro in various cell lines, by strategies involving transfection and selection of stable miR-21-overexpressing or -underexpressing cells, or by short term knockdown of miR-21 expression by antisense oligonucleotides. To overcome the inherent problems related to either of these approaches we resorted to lentiviral transduction of cells with antagomiR-21 and have shown that the IFN-induced miRNA, miR-21, has potent effects on the behavior of melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo. In vitro miR-21 promotes the proliferation, survival, and migration of tumor cells. The oncogenic effects of miR-21 on B16 melanoma cells in vitro may be mediated by down-regulation of the tumor suppressors PTEN and PDCD4 as well as the antiproliferative protein BTG2. Moreover, the protein targets of miR-21 appear to be highly cell type-dependent. Although SPRY2 is a reported target of miR-21 in colon cancer cells (29Sayed D. Rane S. Lypowy J. He M. Chen I.Y. Vashistha H. Yan L. Malhotra A. Vatner D. Abdellatif M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 3272-3282Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), we did not observe an effect of miR-21 on SPRY2 levels in B16 cells. In addition, we found that PDCD4 was a target of miR-21 in B16 cells, but PDCD4 was unaffected by miR-21 knockdown in DU145 prostate cancer cells (10Yang C.H. Yue J. Fan M. Pfeffer L.M. Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 8108-8116Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, when B16 melanoma cells were injected into the bloodstream of syngeneic C57BL/6 mice, miR-21 knockdown markedly enhanced animal survival as well as inhibited lung metastases. Taken together, our results indicate that miR-21 programs the metastatic behavior of cells, rendering miR-21 knockdown cells largely unable to colonize efficiently in the lung, and thus results in the formation of only micrometastases. Our findings that miR-21KD inhibited lung metastasis are in agreement with the recent studies showing that miR-21 plays a critical role in pre-B cell lymphoma and K-ras-dependent lung tumorigenesis (30Medina P.P. Nolde M. Slack F.J. Nature. 2010; 467: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar, 31Hatley M.E. Patrick D.M. Garcia M.R. Richardson J.A. Bassel-Duby R. van Rooij E. Olson E.N. Cancer Cell. 2010; 18: 282-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that miR-21 is an important therapeutic target in cancer and suggest that selective inhibition of miR-21 can reprogram the proliferative, migratory, invasive, and metastatic characteristics of melanoma and potentially other cancers. Consistent with the critical role that we report herein that miR-21 plays in melanoma, a recent report showed that the loss of miR-21 reduced tumorigenesis in a mouse model of skin carcinogenesis (32Ma X. Kumar M. Choudhury S.N. Becker Buscaglia L.E. Barker J.R. Kanakamedala K. Liu M.F. Li Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 10144-10149Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Overexpression of miR-21 in vivo leads to pre-B cell lymphoma and enhances K-ras-mediated lung tumorigenesis, whereas genetic ablation of miR-21 partially protects against tumorigenesis (30Medina P.P. Nolde M. Slack F.J. Nature. 2010; 467: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar, 31Hatley M.E. Patrick D.M. Garcia M.R. Richardson J.A. Bassel-Duby R. van Rooij E. Olson E.N. Cancer Cell. 2010; 18: 282-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Finally, our results also suggest that although some IFN-induced pathways may be antitumorigenic, the IFN-induced miR-21 pathway is protumorigenic. For example, although IFN has been shown to inhibit the proliferation, survival, and migration of cancer cells (11Pfeffer L.M. Dinarello C.A. Herberman R.B. Williams B.R. Borden E.C. Bordens R. Walter M.R. Nagabhushan T.L. Trotta P.P. Pestka S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2489-2499PubMed Google Scholar), we demonstrate that miR-21 promotes the proliferation, survival, and invasiveness of tumor cells. Thus, the anticancer action of IFN apparently is opposed by the IFN induction of the oncomir miR-21. Better characterization of these IFN-induced pathways could lead to novel strategies to improve the efficacy of IFN as an anticancer agent.

https://openalex.org/W2018340749,"Blood-feeding insects such as mosquitoes are efficient vectors of human infectious diseases because they are strongly attracted by body heat, carbon dioxide and odours produced by their vertebrate hosts. Insect repellents containing DEET (N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide) are highly effective, but the mechanism by which this chemical wards off biting insects remains controversial despite decades of investigation. DEET seems to act both at close range as a contact chemorepellent, by affecting insect gustatory receptors, and at long range, by affecting the olfactory system. Two opposing mechanisms for the observed behavioural effects of DEET in the gas phase have been proposed: that DEET interferes with the olfactory system to block host odour recognition and that DEET actively repels insects by activating olfactory neurons that elicit avoidance behaviour. Here we show that DEET functions as a modulator of the odour-gated ion channel formed by the insect odorant receptor complex. The functional insect odorant receptor complex consists of a common co-receptor, ORCO (ref. 15) (formerly called OR83B; ref. 16), and one or more variable odorant receptor subunits that confer odour selectivity. DEET acts on this complex to potentiate or inhibit odour-evoked activity or to inhibit odour-evoked suppression of spontaneous activity. This modulation depends on the specific odorant receptor and the concentration and identity of the odour ligand. We identify a single amino-acid polymorphism in the second transmembrane domain of receptor OR59B in a Drosophila melanogaster strain from Brazil that renders OR59B insensitive to inhibition by the odour ligand and modulation by DEET. Our data indicate that natural variation can modify the sensitivity of an odour-specific insect odorant receptor to odour ligands and DEET. Furthermore, they support the hypothesis that DEET acts as a molecular 'confusant' that scrambles the insect odour code, and provide a compelling explanation for the broad-spectrum efficacy of DEET against multiple insect species."

https://openalex.org/W1968240921,"Nonhexameric helicases use adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to unzip base pairs in double-stranded nucleic acids (dsNAs). Studies have suggested that these helicases unzip dsNAs in single-base pair increments, consuming one ATP molecule per base pair, but direct evidence for this mechanism is lacking. We used optical tweezers to follow the unwinding of double-stranded RNA by the hepatitis C virus NS3 helicase. Single-base pair steps by NS3 were observed, along with nascent nucleotide release that was asynchronous with base pair opening. Asynchronous release of nascent nucleotides rationalizes various observations of its dsNA unwinding and may be used to coordinate the translocation speed of NS3 along the RNA during viral replication."

Apoptosis was originally described as a physiological mechanism of cell death that allows cell turnover and tissue reorganization, but later evidence indicated that it is also an important mechanism of cell demise during viral infection and autoimmune diseases (5Kerr J.F. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12826) Google Scholar, 6Hotchkiss R.S. Strasser A. McDunn J.E. Swanson P.E. N. Engl. J.

Strasser A. McDunn J.E. Swanson P.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 2009; 361: 1570-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Apoptosis can be activated by two major mechanisms: the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways (6Hotchkiss R.S. Strasser A. McDunn J.E. Swanson P.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 2009; 361: 1570-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). The extrinsic pathway is characterized by engagement of death receptors and caspase-8 cleavage/activation. In the second mechanism (intrinsic), the mitochondria play a key role in the triggering of cell death. Transcriptional and post-transcriptional modulation and protein-protein interaction of Bcl-2 members determine the cell outcome in this pathway (7Galonek H.L. Hardwick J.M. Nat.

After an apoptotic stimulus, the sensitizer Bcl-2 proteins (DP5, Bik, Bad, and/or Noxa) are transcriptionally or post-transcriptionally activated and interact through their Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain with the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 members (Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Bcl-W, and A1). This interaction releases BH3-only activator proteins (Bid, Bim, and/or PUMA) that directly bind and induce conformational changes in the multichannel pro-death proteins Bax and Bak (9Gurzov E.N.

Once in the cytoplasm, cytochrome c interacts with apoptotic protease activating factor to form the apoptosome, leading to pro-caspase cleavage and activation and subsequent cell death (14Youle R.J. Strasser A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (3538) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β + IFN-γ induce the BH3-only sensitizer DP5 and the BH3-only activator PUMA, leading to β-cell death (9Gurzov E.N. Eizirik D.L.

It was previously described that mouse islets lacking the transcription factor STAT1 are resistant to TNF-α + IFN-γ-induced apoptosis (17Kim S. Kim H.S. Chung K.W. Oh S.H. Yun J.W. Im S.H. Lee M.K. Kim K.W. Lee M.S. Diabetes. 2007; 56: 2561-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), but the downstream molecular effector(s) remain(s) unknown. Against this background, we presently performed an extensive study using human islets, DP5 knock-out mice, rat fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-purified primary β-cells, and INS-1E cells to clarify the mechanisms underlying TNF-α + IFN-γ-induced β-cell demise. The findings obtained indicate that TNF-α + IFN-γ utilize the BH3-only activator Bim as a key pro-apoptotic effector downstream of STAT1 induction, suggesting a characteristic modulation of Bcl-2 pathways by different inflammatory mediators. Human islets were isolated in Pisa (Italy) from non-diabetic organ donors, with the approval of the local ethical committee. The islets were isolated by enzymatic digestion and density gradient purification (18Lupi R. Dotta F. Marselli L. Del Guerra S. Masini M. Santangelo C. Patané G. Boggi U. Piro S. Anello M.

Donor age was 57 ± 14 years, and the preparations contained 50 ± 16% β-cells (n = 10), as evaluated by immune staining for insulin (methods as in Ref. 19Cunha D.A. Hekerman P. Ladrière L.

Animals were bred and used in accordance with the guidelines of the Belgian Regulations for Animal Welfare or with the Canadian Council of Animal Care guidelines. All experimental protocols used were approved by the Ethical Committee for Animal Experiments of the ULB or by the Animal Care Committee of Mount Sinai Hospital. Primary rat β-cell isolation and culture were carried out as published previously (21Pipeleers D.G. in't Veld P.A. Van de Winkel M. Maes E. Schuit F.C. Gepts W.

Islet isolation was achieved by collagenase digestion, and primary rat β-cells were obtained after hand picking of islets using a stereomicroscope, islet dispersion, and FACS sorting (FACSAria, BD Biosciences). Sorted cells were plated on polylysine-coated dishes and precultured in Ham's F-10 (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) medium for 48 h before any further experimental procedures. Mouse islet isolation was performed as described previously (23Maida A. Lovshin J.A. Baggio L.L. Drucker D.J. Endocrinology. 2008; 149: 5670-5678Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The insulin-producing INS-1E cell line (a kind gift from Professor C.

After cell culture and treatment, cells were lysed using the Laemmli buffer, and total protein extracts were extracted and resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred unto a nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with the antibodies indicated in supplemental Table S1. The proteins were revealed with a secondary anti-rabbit or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-IgG (1/5000, Lucron Bioproducts, De Pinte, Belgium). The protein bands were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (SuperSignal West Femto, Thermo Scientific, Pierce) and quantified using the Aida1D analysis software (Fujifilm, London, UK). The intensity values for the proteins were corrected by the values of the housekeeping protein α-tubulin and are shown as -fold induction versus the control sample (considered as 1). Cells were transfected overnight with 30 nm of siRNAs (Dharmacon, Chicago, IL; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA; or Invitrogen) or with an inactive control siRNA (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands) using DharmaFECTTM lipid reagent (Dharmacon), LipofectamineTM 2000 reagent (Invitrogen), and Opti-MEM® (Invitrogen).

After exposure to cytokines, INS-1E cells, rat primary β-cells, and human islets were lysed and harvested; poly(A) mRNA was isolated using the Dynabeads mRNA DIRECT kit (Invitrogen) and reverse-transcribed as described previously (22Moore F.

Quantitative RT-PCR was done by using SYBR Green fluorescence on a LightCycler machine (Roche Diagnostics, Manheim, Germany), and values were compared with a standard curve. Expression values of the genes of interest were corrected by the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and were normalized by the control value in the experimental series considered as 1. GAPDH expression is not modified by the present cytokine combinations in INS-1E cells (27Ortis F. Cardozo A.K. Crispim D. Störling J. Mandrup-Poulsen T. Eizirik D.L. Mol.

Primer sequences for rat and human PUMA, Bim, DP5, OAZ1, SRP14, and GAPDH and rat Bcl-XL, Bcl-2, STAT1, and PTPN2 are described in supplemental Table S3. β-Cells were plated on polylysine-coated coverslips and treated with cytokines for at least 48 h. The cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100. The fixed cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-Bax (1/200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-AIF, (1/200, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), anti-Cox (1/200, Cell Signaling), anti-ATP synthase β (1/1000, Sigma), and mouse anti-cytochrome c (1/200, BD Biosciences). The secondary antibody used for visualization was either FITC-conjugated or rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies raised against rabbit or mouse (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA), diluted at 1/200. Nuclei were counterstained with HO (10 μg/ml; Sigma) before mounting of coverslips. Pictures were made using an inverted fluorescent microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 200, Oberkochen, Germany). The ChIP assay was performed as described (15Gurzov E.N. Ortis F. Cunha D.A. Gosset G. Li M. Cardozo A.K. Eizirik D.L. Cell Death Differ. 2009; 16: 1539-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Briefly, extracts were precleared by a 1-h incubation with protein A/herring sperm DNA at 4 °C. Samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-STAT1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:200) or preimmune goat serum as negative control. Immunocomplexes were conjugated with protein A/herring sperm DNA and washed. Samples were then eluted, proteinase K-treated, and incubated overnight at 65 °C in high salt solution to reverse the cross-link reaction. DNA fragments were analyzed by standard PCR, and input DNA was analyzed simultaneously for normalization. PCR was performed with the following primer pair for the STAT1 binding site −686 to −385 of the Bim promoter: 5′-TCCCACCACCAGCTCTGCAC-3′ and 5′-GCTCCCTTGGTTTGCGGAGC-3′. Data are expressed as means ± S.E. of the indicated number of independent experiments. A significant difference between experimental conditions was assessed by a two-tailed paired t test or ANOVA followed by paired t test with the Bonferroni correction. p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. β-Cell exposure to TNF-α + IFN-γ induced mitochondrial Bax translocation, cytochrome c release, and DNA fragmentation (Fig. 1, A and B; supplemental Fig. S2, A–D), but not nuclear AIF translocation (Fig. 1A; supplemental Fig. S2A). In primary rat β-cells and INS-1E cells, AIF is anchored to the inner mitochondrial membrane and needs to be actively processed to translocate to the nucleus (13Norberg E. Orrenius S. Zhivotovsky B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2010; 396: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar); this process occurs independently of mitochondrial Bax translocation and cytochrome c release. Consistently with cytochrome c release from the mitochondria, TNF-α + IFN-γ triggered the cleavage and activation of caspases -9, -7, and -3 (Fig. 1C). Total pro-caspase-7 protein expression was up-regulated after cytokine combination (Fig. 1C), but the ratio of cleaved/pro-caspase 7 increased by 5–7-fold after 16–24 h (p < 0.05; data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis is activated in β-cells following exposure to TNF-α + IFN-γ. Importantly, we confirmed that TNF-α combined with IFN-γ induces cleavage of caspase-3 and triggers apoptosis in dispersed human islets (Fig. 2, A and B; supplemental Fig. S2E). This apoptotic effect of TNF-α + IFN-γ was not prevented by IL-1ra in INS-1E cells. Conversely, IL-1ra protected against IL-1β + IFN-γ-induced cell death (Fig. 2C). Thus, TNF-α + IFN-γ directly induce apoptosis in our experimental model, without the need of IL-1β production by the target cells (31Arnush M. Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Marino M.H. Manning P.T.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1686-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that IL-1β + IFN-γ induce activation of DP5 via JNK/c-Jun and nitric oxide (NO) production in β-cells, which triggers the classic intrinsic apoptotic pathway (15Gurzov E.N. Ortis F. Cunha D.A. Gosset G. Li M. Cardozo A.K. Eizirik D.L. Cell Death Differ. 2009; 16: 1539-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We presently observed that islets from four human preparations exposed to TNF-α + IFN-γ increased DP5 mRNA expression (Fig. 3A). DP5 mRNA up-regulation was also observed in primary rat β-cells and in insulin-producing INS-1E cells (Fig. 3, B and C). DP5 induction by TNF-α + IFN-γ (2–5-fold) was less marked than the extent of DP5 overexpression observed with the combination of IL-1β + IFN-γ (3–20-fold) (15Gurzov E.N. Ortis F. Cunha D.A. Gosset G. Li M. Cardozo A.K. Eizirik D.L. Cell Death Differ. 2009; 16: 1539-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Knockdown of DP5 by two different siRNAs (supplemental Fig. S3) decreased TNF-α + IFN-γ-induced β-cell death (Fig. 3D). Because the present and previous (15Gurzov E.N. Ortis F. Cunha D.A. Gosset G. Li M. Cardozo A.K. Eizirik D.L. Cell Death Differ. 2009; 16: 1539-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) in vitro studies indicated that DP5 participates in β-cell apoptosis, we next studied the effects of DP5 inactivation in an in vivo model, namely DP5 knock-out mice (20Imaizumi K. Benito A. Kiryu-Seo S. Gonzalez V. Inohara N. Lieberman A.P. Kiyama H. Nuñez G. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 3721-3725Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). β-Cell area was increased in pancreases from DP5-deficient mice when compared with wild type littermates (Fig. 3E), but glucose tolerance and islet insulin secretion were similar (supplemental Fig. S4, A–D). Importantly, islets isolated from mice lacking DP5 were partially protected against TNF-α + IFN-γ (Fig. 3F) and against TNF-α + IFN-γ + IL-1β (data not shown). All together, these data indicate that DP5 inactivation partially prevents the triggering of apoptosis by pro-inflammatory cytokines. PUMA plays a major role for pancreatic β-cell apoptosis in the context of IL-1β + IFN-γ exposure (16Gurzov E.N. Germano C.M. Cunha D.A. Ortis F. Vanderwinden J.M. Marchetti P. Zhang L. Eizirik D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 19910-19920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). PUMA transcript expression was induced by ∼6-fold in human islet preparations, primary rat β-cells, and INS-1E cells following treatment with TNF-α + IFN-γ (Fig. 4, A–C). Up-regulation of PUMA protein was demonstrated in INS-1E cells (Fig. 4D). SMARTpool (a combination of four different siRNAs) and a single sequence siRNA were used to silence PUMA, achieving a 70% reduction in mRNA expression as measured by real time RT PCR (Fig. 4E) and a 50% decrease in protein level as observed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4F). PUMA knockdown protected INS-1E cells against TNF-α + IFN-γ-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4G). Simultaneous knockdown of both DP5 and PUMA failed to fully protect INS-1E cells against cytokines (Fig. 5). Together, these data demonstrate that DP5 and PUMA contribute to the control of β-cell death induced by TNF-α + IFN-γ. The partial protective effect obtained by knocking down these two proteins, however, suggests that alternative Bcl-2 proteins participate in β-cell apoptosis following exposure to TNF-α and IFN-γ.FIGURE 5Knockdown of DP5, PUMA, or combination partially prevents TNF-α + IFN-γ-induced cell death in INS-1E cells.

https://openalex.org/W2002203108,"Metastasis is a key event of malignant tumor progression. The capability to metastasize depends on the ability of the cancer cell to migrate into connective tissue, adhere, and possibly transmigrate through the endothelium. Previously we reported that the endothelium does not generally act as barrier for cancer cells to migrate in three-dimensional extracellular matrices (3D-ECMs). Instead, the endothelium acts as an enhancer or a promoter for the invasiveness of certain cancer cells. How invasive cancer cells diminish the endothelial barrier function still remains elusive. Therefore, this study investigates whether invasive cancer cells can decrease the endothelial barrier function through alterations of endothelial biomechanical properties. To address this, MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were used that invade deeper and more numerous into 3D-ECMs when co-cultured with microvascular endothelial cells. Using magnetic tweezer measurements, MDA-MB-231 cells were found to alter the mechanical properties of endothelial cells by reducing endothelial cell stiffness. Using spontaneous bead diffusion, actin cytoskeletal remodeling dynamics were shown to be increased in endothelial cells co-cultured with MDA-MB-231 cells compared with mono-cultured endothelial cells. In addition, knockdown of the α5 integrin subunit in highly transmigrating α5β1high cells derived from breast, bladder, and kidney cancer cells abolished the endothelial invasion-enhancing effect comparable with the inhibition of myosin light chain kinase. These results indicate that the endothelial invasion-enhancing effect is α5β1 integrin-dependent. Moreover, inhibition of Rac-1, Rho kinase, MEK kinase, and PI3K reduced the endothelial invasion-enhancing effect, indicating that signaling via small GTPases may play a role in the endothelial facilitated increased invasiveness of cancer cells. In conclusion, decreased stiffness and increased cytoskeletal remodeling dynamics of endothelial cells may account for the breakdown of endothelial barrier function, suggesting that biomechanical alterations are sufficient to facilitate the transmigration and invasion of invasive cancer cells into 3D-ECMs. Metastasis is a key event of malignant tumor progression. The capability to metastasize depends on the ability of the cancer cell to migrate into connective tissue, adhere, and possibly transmigrate through the endothelium. Previously we reported that the endothelium does not generally act as barrier for cancer cells to migrate in three-dimensional extracellular matrices (3D-ECMs). Instead, the endothelium acts as an enhancer or a promoter for the invasiveness of certain cancer cells. How invasive cancer cells diminish the endothelial barrier function still remains elusive. Therefore, this study investigates whether invasive cancer cells can decrease the endothelial barrier function through alterations of endothelial biomechanical properties. To address this, MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were used that invade deeper and more numerous into 3D-ECMs when co-cultured with microvascular endothelial cells. Using magnetic tweezer measurements, MDA-MB-231 cells were found to alter the mechanical properties of endothelial cells by reducing endothelial cell stiffness. Using spontaneous bead diffusion, actin cytoskeletal remodeling dynamics were shown to be increased in endothelial cells co-cultured with MDA-MB-231 cells compared with mono-cultured endothelial cells. In addition, knockdown of the α5 integrin subunit in highly transmigrating α5β1high cells derived from breast, bladder, and kidney cancer cells abolished the endothelial invasion-enhancing effect comparable with the inhibition of myosin light chain kinase. These results indicate that the endothelial invasion-enhancing effect is α5β1 integrin-dependent. Moreover, inhibition of Rac-1, Rho kinase, MEK kinase, and PI3K reduced the endothelial invasion-enhancing effect, indicating that signaling via small GTPases may play a role in the endothelial facilitated increased invasiveness of cancer cells. In conclusion, decreased stiffness and increased cytoskeletal remodeling dynamics of endothelial cells may account for the breakdown of endothelial barrier function, suggesting that biomechanical alterations are sufficient to facilitate the transmigration and invasion of invasive cancer cells into 3D-ECMs. IntroductionThe malignancy of tumors is responsible for most cancer-related deaths. A benign tumor becomes malignant when cancer cells spread from the primary tumor and form metastases (1Frixen U.H. Behrens J. Sachs M. Eberle G. Voss B. Warda A. Löchner D. Birchmeier W. J.

Science. 2005; 310: 1139-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (4729) Google Scholar). In many previous studies the endothelium acts as a barrier against the invasion of cancer cells (6Al-Mehdi A.B. Tozawa K.

Furthermore, the endothelium reduces pronouncedly the invasion of cancer cells and, hence, metastasis formation (9Van Sluis G.L. Niers T.M. Esmon C.T. Tigchelaar W. Richel D.J. Buller H.R. Van Noorden C.J. Spek C.A. Blood. 2009; 114: 1968-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, several recent reports propose a novel paradigm in which endothelial cells modulate the invasiveness of several cancer cells by increasing their dissemination through vessels (10Kedrin D.

Among these cancer cells is the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231.Although several adhesion molecules have been identified that play a role in tumor-endothelial cell interactions and, hence, metastasis formation, the biomechanical properties of endothelial cells co-cultured with cancer cells are still elusive. There may be altered biomechanical properties of endothelial cells that support the ability of the endothelium to act either as a barrier or as an enhancer for cancer cell invasion. Biomechanical properties have been studied so far only on cancer cells (11Mierke C.T. Zitterbart D.P. Kollmannsberger P. Raupach C. Schlötzer-Schrehardt U. Goecke T.W. Behrens J. Fabry B. Biophys.

Cell Science. 2011; 124: 369-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). A main biochemical pathway of the tumor-endothelial interaction has been reported to involve cell adhesion receptors and integrins such as platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) and αvβ3 integrins, respectively (15Voura E.B. Chen N. Siu C.H. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 2000; 18: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Integrins are transmembrane adhesion receptors that cluster after activation and assembly of focal adhesions in cell-matrix as well as in cell-cell adhesive interactions (16Geiger B. Bershadsky A. Pankov R. Yamada K.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1815) Google Scholar). In addition, integrins forge a link between the ECM and the actin cytoskeleton that can be tensioned by myosin-II motors acting on actin filaments (17Neff N.T. Lowrey C. Decker C. Tovar A. Damsky C. Buck C. Horwitz A.F. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 654-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 18Damsky C.H. Knudsen K.A. Bradley D. Buck C.A. Horwitz A.F. J.

Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar). The connection between integrins and the actomyosin cytoskeleton is facilitated through the mechano-coupling focal adhesion and cytoskeletal adaptor protein vinculin (20Mierke C.T. Kollmannsberger P. Zitterbart D.P. Smith J. Fabry B. Goldmann W.H. Biophys. J. 2008; 94: 661-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this connection determines the amount of cellular counterforces that maintain the morphology and shape of cells and, hence, provide the cellular stiffness (21Rape A.D. Guo W.H. Wang Y.L. Biomaterials. 2011; 32: 2043-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Taken together, until now a biomechanical approach investigating the endothelial barrier breakdown in the presence of co-cultured invasive cancer cells is still elusive.As microrheologic measurements such as magnetic tweezer rheology turn out to be adequate for the identification of cell mechanical properties such as cellular stiffness, in this study endothelial stiffness using magnetic tweezers was measured in co-culture with invasive MDA-MB-231 cells as well as in mono-culture. The results are that highly invasive breast cancer cells influenced the cellular mechanical properties of co-cultured microvascular endothelial cells by lowering the stiffness of endothelial cells. In addition, nanoscale particle tracking method diffusion measurements of actomyosin cytoskeletal-bound beads, which serve as markers, are suitable to determine the actomyosin cytoskeletal remodeling dynamics. Thus, cytoskeletal remodeling dynamics of endothelial cells using nanoscale particle tracking were measured either in mono-culture or in co-culture with highly invasive MDA-MB-231 cells. Here, the cytoskeletal remodeling dynamics of endothelial cells were increased in co-culture with highly invasive cancer cells. These findings indicate that highly invasive breast cancer cells actively altered the biomechanical properties of co-cultured endothelial cells. Hence, these results may provide an explanation for the breakdown of the endothelial barrier function of monolayers.In conclusion, a mechanism in which a decrease in endothelial cell-cell adhesion molecule expression such as PECAM-1 and vascular endothelial-cadherin (VE-cadherin), a decrease in endothelial cell stiffness, and an increase in cytoskeletal remodeling dynamics account for the endothelial barrier breakdown by highly invasive MDA-MB-231 cells was provided in this study.DISCUSSIONCancer cell transendothelial migration and invasion are complex events and depend on biomechanical and biochemical properties of the endothelium and the connective tissue. This study demonstrates that the invasiveness of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells is increased in co-culture with human microvascular or macrovascular endothelial cells as indicated by increased numbers of invasive cancer cells and their increased invasion depth. In addition, this article shows that invasive cancer cells altered the biomechanics of endothelial cells.To reveal the function of the endothelium in cancer cell invasion, highly invasive MDA-MB-231 cells and weakly invasive MCF-7 cells were co-cultured with two different types of microvascular endothelial cells. In agreement with a previous report (11Mierke C.T. Zitterbart D.P. Kollmannsberger P. Raupach C. Schlötzer-Schrehardt U. Goecke T.W. Behrens J. Fabry B. Biophys. J. 2008; 94: 2832-2846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), endothelial cells increased the numbers of invasive MDA-MB-231 breast cells as well as their invasion depth in 3D-ECMs. In contrast to MDA-MB-231 cells, MCF-7 breast cancer cells did not transmigrate through an HPMEC monolayer, and only less than 2% of MCF-7 cells were able to migrate through an HUVEC monolayer. These results indicate that the invasiveness of MCF-7 was not enhanced by endothelial cells.Because of these findings, the suggestion was that certain cancer cells such as MDA-MB-231 cells may alter the biomechanical properties of endothelial cells in order to transmigrate and invade 3D-ECMs. Hence, this study focuses on the biomechanical mechanism that leads to higher invasiveness of MDA-MB-231 cells after transendothelial migration. To identify this mechanism, stiffness and cytoskeletal remodeling dynamics of endothelial cells were investigated in co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cancer cells and compared with mono-cultured endothelial cells.Recent results have been shown that single or loosely clustered endothelial as well as a closed endothelial cell monolayer facilitate MDA-MB-231 cell invasion (11Mierke C.T. Zitterbart D.P. Kollmannsberger P. Raupach C. Schlötzer-Schrehardt U. Goecke T.W. Behrens J. Fabry B. Biophys. J. 2008; 94: 2832-2846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Therefore, a co-culture of mixed MDA-MB-231 cells and endothelial cells was used to analyze the mechanical properties of endothelial cells. Here, the cellular stiffness of with MDA-MB-231 cells co-cultured endothelial cells was decreased compared with mono-cultured endothelial cells. This result suggests that MDA-MB-231 cells broke down the endothelial barrier by lowering the cell stiffness. In contrast, the weakly invasive MCF-7 cancer cells were not able to regulate the biomechanical properties of co-cultured endothelial cells (data not shown), suggesting that only highly invasive cancer cells are able to decrease the mechanical stiffness and, hence, increase the deformability of endothelial cells to transmigrate through the endothelial monolayer. Furthermore, this behavior may be a prerequisite to overcome and break down the endothelial barrier.In a previous study, our group found that force fluctuations in an endothelial cell monolayer are widely spread to far distant endothelial cells, suggesting that these force fluctuations are not locally restricted (31Raupach C. Zitterbart D.P. Mierke C.T. Metzner C. Müller F.A. Fabry B. Phys. Rev. E Stat. Nonlin Soft Matter Phys. 2007; 76 (011918)Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus, this study analyzed whether the cytoskeletal remodeling dynamics of endothelial cells are altered during co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cells compared with mono-cultured endothelial cells. Indeed, the MDA-MB-231 cells increased the cytoskeletal remodeling dynamics in co-cultured endothelial cells by 5-fold. In contrast to MDA-MB-231 cancer cells, the non-invasive MCF-7 cancer cells did not alter the cytoskeletal remodeling dynamics of endothelial cells when co-cultured. These results indicate that the ability of highly invasive cancer cells to regulate biomechanical properties of co-cultured endothelial cells may help these cancer cells to transmigrate and invade connective tissue.Previous studies have reported that endothelial cells are exposed to high forces and, hence, respond to them with disruption of their cell-cell adhesions and, subsequently, of the whole endothelial monolayer when neutrophiles or lymphocytes adhere to the endothelium (33Cinamon G. Shinder V. Alon R. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 34Rabodzey A. Alcaide P. Luscinskas F.W. Ladoux B. Biophys. J. 2008; 95: 1428-1438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Hence, neutrophiles and lymphocytes transmit (shear) forces to transmigrate through the endothelium and, finally, into the connective tissue (33Cinamon G. Shinder V. Alon R. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 34Rabodzey A. Alcaide P. Luscinskas F.W. Ladoux B. Biophys. J. 2008; 95: 1428-1438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Therefore, the cell surface expression of cell-cell adhesion molecules such as VE-cadherin and PECAM-1 was analyzed during co-culture with highly invasive MDA-MB-231 cells and weakly invasive MCF-7 cells. Indeed, the expression of VE-cadherin and PECAM-1 on the cell surface of microvascular endothelial cells was reduced after co-culture with highly invasive MDA-MB-231 cells but not with weakly invasive MCF-7 cells, indicating that only the highly invasive cells are able to reduce the cell-cell interactions between neighboring endothelial cells to mediate cancer cell transmigration. The reduction of cell-cell adhesion molecules on endothelial cells and endothelial cell stiffness led to a reduction in endothelial cell barrier function. Whether the reduced cellular stiffness of endothelial cells is mediated by a decrease in cell-cell adhesion molecule expression or vice versa has to be further investigated.For cancer cell transmigration, a dual function of the endothelium was suggested acting either as an enhancer or inhibitor of cancer cell invasion depending on the cancer cell type co-cultured (35Mierke, C. T. (2011) Cell Biochem. Biophys., in press.Google Scholar). Here, it was confirmed that highly invasive MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells transmigrate through HUVEC and HPMEC monolayers, indicating that their invasive capability was increased in the presence of macrovascular and microvascular endothelial cells. In contrast to previous reports presenting the endothelium as a “passive” barrier for cell invasion (36Verin A.D. Patterson C.E. Day M.A. Garcia J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: L99-L108PubMed Google Scholar, 37Nottebaum A.F. Cagna G. Winderlich M. Gamp A.C. Linnepe R. Polaschegg C. Filippova K. Lyck R. Engelhardt B. Kamenyeva O. Bixel M.G. Butz S. Vestweber D. J. Exp. Med. 2008; 205: 2929-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), this study shows that the co-culture with highly invasive MDA-MB-231 cells caused biomechanical alterations in endothelial cells that reduced the expression of cell-cell adhesion molecules and, subsequently, the stiffness of endothelial cells. These mechanical alterations may enable cancer cells to transmigrate through an endothelial monolayer and migrate into connective tissue. Thus, the endothelial barrier function seems to be lowered by alterations in endothelial biomechanical properties. These biomechanical results are consistent with an up-regulation of the Erk phosphorylation reported in HUVECs during co-culture with colon cancer cells (38Tremblay P.L. Auger F.A. Huot J. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6563-6573Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Moreover, this study shows that the inhibition of the upstream regulatory protein of Erk MEK abolished the endothelial-facilitated increased invasiveness of α5β1high breast cancer cells. These results suggest that cancer cells may apply forces toward the endothelial cell monolayer to alter endothelial mechanical properties and, hence, facilitate cancer cell transendothelial migration. Indeed, for the transmigration and invasion of highly invasive MDA-MB231 cells, contractile forces are necessary to overcome the endothelial barrier because inhibition of the myosin light chain kinase and subsequently the transmission or generation of contractile forces reduces the number of transmigrating and invading cells, indicating that the endothelial-facilitated increased invasiveness depends on the α5β1 integrin expression. Another supporting point was that α5β1high cells are able to transmit and generate 7-fold higher contractile forces compared with α5β1low cells (14Mierke C.T. Frey B. Fellner M. Herrmann M. Fabry B. J. Cell Science. 2011; 124: 369-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar).To reveal by which mechanism cancer cell invasiveness is enhanced by endothelial cells, the transendothelial migration and invasion assay was performed in the presence of embedded FN in 3D-FN-ECMs. As expected, the number of transmigrating and invasive α5β1high cells as well as their invasion depths was increased in the presence of an HPMEC cell monolayer, whereas the invasiveness of α5β1low cells was not affected. These results suggest that FN activates the α5β1 integrins and, subsequently, increases the transmission and generation of contractile forces in α5β1high cells, which further increased their ability to transmigrate and finally to invade. Furthermore, the inhibition of the small GTPases Rho kinase and Rac-1 and of its signaling pathway by PI3K inhibitor revealed that small GTPase signaling may play a role in endothelial-facilitated increased invasiveness of α5β1high cells. In addition, the endothelial-facilitated increased invasiveness of α5β1high cells is not restricted to breast cancer cells, as the invasiveness of α5β1high cells derived from bladder and kidney cancer cells was similarly increased by endothelial cells.Taken together, biophysical measurements may shed light on the biomechanical mechanism that facilitates transendothelial migration of cancer cells. Furthermore, this study indicates that MDA-MB-231 cells break down the endothelial barrier function by lowering cellular stiffness through remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. In addition, endothelial cells may secrete FN, which then further activates α5β1 integrins on cancer cells by increased transmission or generation of contractile forces and, subsequently, enhances their invasiveness.In conclusion, this study shows that the endothelium was no passive barrier for cancer cell invasion. Instead, the endothelium seems to act cancer cell-specific, as it increased or decreased cancer cell transmigration and invasion of certain cancer cell lines. In addition, biomechanical properties of endothelial cells were altered by a certain type of cancer cells with distinct biomechanical properties, indicating that these biomechanical alterations may play a role in the transendothelial migration process of cancer cells. Finally, this article suggests that biomechanical alterations in endothelial cells evoked by certain cancer cells might provide a biomechanical selection process toward higher invasiveness of cancer cells. In conclusion, biomechanical interactions between highly invasive cancer cells and endothelial cells facilitate the transmigration of cancer cells, further enhance their invasion into connective tissue, and subsequently, may determine the malignancy of tumors.

https://openalex.org/W2008878850,"Interaction and cross-talk of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are of considerable interest because an increasing number of examples implicate a profound functional and physiological relevance of homo- or hetero-oligomeric GPCRs. The ghrelin (growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR)) and melanocortin-3 (MC3R) receptors are both known to have orexigenic effects on the hypothalamic control of body weight. Because in vitro studies indicate heterodimerization of GHSR and MC3R, we investigated their functional interplay. Combined in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry indicated that the vast majority of GHSR-expressing neurons in the arcuate nucleus also express MC3R. In vitro coexpression of MC3R and GHSR promoted enhanced melanocortin-induced intracellular cAMP accumulation compared with activation of MC3R in the absence of GHSR. In contrast, agonist-independent basal signaling activity and ghrelin-induced signaling of GHSR were impaired, most likely due to interaction with MC3R. By taking advantage of naturally occurring GHSR mutations and an inverse agonist for GHSR, we demonstrate that the observed enhanced MC3R signaling capability depends directly on the basal activity of GHSR. In conclusion, we demonstrate a paradigm-shifting example of GPCR heterodimerization allowing for mutually opposite functional influence of two hypothalamic receptors controlling body weight. We found that the agonist-independent active conformation of one GPCR can determine the signaling modalities of another receptor in a heterodimer. Our discovery also implies that mutations within one of two interacting receptors might affect both receptors and different pathways simultaneously. These findings uncover mechanisms of important relevance for pharmacological targeting of GPCR in general and hypothalamic body weight regulation in particular.

In contrast, agonist-independent basal signaling activity and ghrelin-induced signaling of GHSR were impaired, most likely due to interaction with MC3R. By taking advantage of naturally occurring GHSR mutations and an inverse agonist for GHSR, we demonstrate that the observed enhanced MC3R signaling capability depends directly on the basal activity of GHSR. In conclusion, we demonstrate a paradigm-shifting example of GPCR heterodimerization allowing for mutually opposite functional influence of two hypothalamic receptors controlling body weight. We found that the agonist-independent active conformation of one GPCR can determine the signaling modalities of another receptor in a heterodimer. Our discovery also implies that mutations within one of two interacting receptors might affect both receptors and different pathways simultaneously. These findings uncover mechanisms of important relevance for pharmacological targeting of GPCR in general and hypothalamic body weight regulation in particular. G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 3The abbreviations used are: GPCRG-protein-coupled receptorMC4Rmelanocortin-4 receptorMC3Rmelanocortin-3 receptorGHSRgrowth hormone secretagogue receptor (ghrelin receptor)POMCpro-opiomelanocortinMSHmelanocyte-stimulating hormoneIP3inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphaterM3Rrat muscarinic 3 receptor. are involved into the modulation of almost any physiological process (1Rozenfeld R. Devi L.A. Biochem. J. 2011; 433: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These receptors are activated by a remarkable variety of different ligands, including ions, nucleotides, biogenic amines, small peptides, and large glycoprotein hormones, and they activate various signaling pathways (2Kristiansen K. Pharmacol. Ther. 2004; 103: 21-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). GPCRs are popular therapeutic targets, and >40% of approved drugs act on GPCRs (3Hopkins A.L. Groom C.R. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (2655) Google Scholar). G-protein-coupled receptor melanocortin-4 receptor melanocortin-3 receptor growth hormone secretagogue receptor (ghrelin receptor) pro-opiomelanocortin melanocyte-stimulating hormone inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate rat muscarinic 3 receptor. Recently, it became evident that these receptors function in di- or oligomeric complexes. Among such receptor complexes, homodimeric (same GPCRs) or heterodimeric (different GPCRs) interactions between protomers can occur (4Bouvier M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 5George S.R. O'Dowd B.F. Lee S.P. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 808-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). These types of structural and functional oligomer interactions are of great interest when they differ from well established functional characteristics of monomeric receptors (6Rosenbaum D.M. Rasmussen S.G. Kobilka B.K. Nature. 2009; 459: 356-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (1653) Google Scholar). Relevant functional changes could be modified G-protein coupling, different ligand-receptor specificities, or altered ligand-induced receptor internalization (7Levoye A. Dam J. Ayoub M.A. Guillaume J.L. Couturier C. Delagrange P. Jockers R. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3012-3023Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 8Lohse M.J. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2010; 10: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). GPCR oligomerization could be of particular interest for an improved molecular understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms also, as >35 GPCRs are known to be relevant for human diseases (9Schöneberg T. Schulz A. Biebermann H. Hermsdorf T. Römpler H. Sangkuhl K. Pharmacol. Ther. 2004; 104: 173-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Obesity is one of the world's major health burdens of the 21st century. During the last 20 years, our understanding of mechanisms involved in body weight and appetite regulation has increased tremendously. A remarkable number of key components in hypothalamic body weight regulation turned out to be GPCRs such as the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R), the melanocortin-3 receptor (MC3R), and the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR; ghrelin receptor) (Fig. 1). Especially functional consequences of naturally occurring mutations in these receptors have demonstrated their physiological importance for maintenance of body weight (10Holst B. Schwartz T.W. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 11Tao Y.X. Endocr. Rev. 2010; 31: 506-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). GHSR and MC3R are of specific interest because their hypothalamic activation induces food intake. GHSR is activated by stomach-derived Ser3-acetylated ghrelin (12Tschöp M. Smiley D.L. Heiman M.L. Nature. 2000; 407: 908-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (3392) Google Scholar). Ghrelin activation is promoted by ghrelin o-acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.-) independent of dietary lipids (13Kirchner H. Gutierrez J.A. Solenberg P.J. Pfluger P.T. Czyzyk T.A. Willency J.A. Schürmann A. Joost H.G. Jandacek R.J. Hale J.E. Heiman M.L. Tschöp M.H. Nat. Med. 2009; 15: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 14Romero A. Kirchner H. Heppner K. Pfluger P.T. Tschöp M.H. Nogueiras R. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 2010; 163: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ghrelin was recently found to be of major importance to survive starvation by modifying glucose homeostasis (15Goldstein, J. L., Zhao, T. J., Li, R. L., Sherbet, D. P., Liang, G., Brown, M. S. (2011) Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol., in press.Google Scholar). Ghrelin o-acyltransferase knock-out mice lost the ability to stabilize glucose levels during starvation due to the lack of functional active ghrelin to stimulate growth hormone release (16Zhao T.J. Liang G. Li R.L. Xie X. Sleeman M.W. Murphy A.J. Valenzuela D.M. Yancopoulos G.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 7467-7472Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). In contrast to the peripheral orexigenic action of the ghrelin o-acyltransferase/ghrelin/GHSR system, the orexigenic activation of MC3R is induced by pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)-derived γ-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) produced in the hypothalamus (17Marks D.L. Hruby V. Brookhart G. Cone R.D. Peptides. 2006; 27: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In addition, anticipatory food-seeking behaviors triggered by food restriction and circadian metabolic control by central circadian clock circuits have been reported to depend on MC3R (18Sutton G.M. Perez-Tilve D. Nogueiras R. Fang J. Kim J.K. Cone R.D. Gimble J.M. Tschöp M.H. Butler A.A. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 12946-12955Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the functional relevance of MC3R/GHSR heterodimerization using a multidisciplinary approach combining molecular biology, mutations with known loss-of-function impact, and advanced receptor pharmacology. We show that interaction of GHSR and MC3R leads to enhanced MC3R signaling efficacy (signaling surplus) while simultaneously causing a decreased GHSR signaling capacity. We further demonstrate that ligand-independent GHSR signaling activity plays a key role in this mutual and opposite receptor interrelation and is modulated by interaction with MC3R. This series of observations supports the importance of basal GHSR activity for body weight regulation (19Petersen P.S. Woldbye D.P. Madsen A.N. Egerod K.L. Jin C. Lang M. Rasmussen M. Beck-Sickinger A.G. Holst B. Endocrinology. 2009; 150: 4920-4930Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and for functional impact of GPCR dimerization and likely translates into the principal biology of other GPCRs characterized by a permanent basally active conformation. In situ hybridization histochemistry was performed to map the hypothalamic expression of MC3R. Immunohistochemistry of β-galactosidase, the product of the lacZ gene driven by the GHSR promoter in GHSR knock-out mice (20Diano S. Farr S.A. Benoit S.C. McNay E.C. da Silva I. Horvath B. Gaskin F.S. Nonaka N. Jaeger L.B. Banks W.A. Morley J.E. Pinto S. Sherwin R.S. Xu L. Yamada K.A. Sleeman M.W. Tschöp M.H. Horvath T.L. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar), was used to visualize GHSR. GHSR knock-out mice were perfused and post-fixed with 4 °C diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated paraformaldehyde and sank in 30% diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated sucrose buffered with 0.1 m PBS. Brains were then cut with a cryostat into 25-μm slices and stored at −80 °C in antifreeze solution until processing for in situ hybridization. Sections were treated with 0.2 n HCl, 0.2% glycine buffer, and 0.1% Triton X-100 and rinsed with 0.1 m PBS between each step. Brain sections were then prehybridized for 30 min and hybridized in hybridization buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 100 nm Locked nuclei acid-modified cDNA probes labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein (forward, 5′-AGGAAGAAGTACATGGGAGAGT; and reverse, 5′-ATCTCCTTGAACGTGTTGCGCA) (Exiqon) for 8 h. After stringent washing with 2×, 0.5×, and 0.2× SSC and rinsing with 0.1 m PBS, sections were incubated with rabbit anti-fluorescein antibody (1:10,000; Invitrogen) and chicken anti-β-galactosidase antibody (1:200; Abcam) at 4 °C for 16 h. After rinsing with 0.1 m PBS, sections were incubated with both DyLight 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:200) and Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-chicken (1:300) secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). After thorough rinsing, sections were mounted with Dabco® (Sigma-Aldrich) and visualized by confocal microscopy. MC3R was cloned from genomic DNA, and GHSR cDNAs were purchased from the University of Missouri-Rolla cDNA Resource Center. All constructs were cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDps (21Okayama H. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) via KpnI/SpeI. For HA and FLAG tagging of MC3R and GHSR, epitope-coding primers were used. Mutant GHSR and MC3R were generated using standard mutagenesis techniques and WT GHSR-pcDps and WT MC3R-pcDps as templates. COS-7 and HEK293 cells were cultured in DMEM (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany), and HEK293 cells were cultured in MEM (Biochrom), both supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified 7% CO2 incubator. For determination of total receptor expression, 1 × 106 COS-7 cells were seeded in 6-cm dishes and transfected with a total of 3 μg of DNA and 4 μl of Metafectene. Cell surface expression assays were performed in 48-well plates (5 × 104 cells/well), and cells were transfected with 0.25 μg of DNA/well and 1 μl Metafectene/well. cAMP assays and determination of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) were performed in 48-well plates (5 × 104 cells/well). Cells were transfected with 80 ng of DNA/well and 0.93 μl of Metafectene/well. For binding studies, COS-7 cells (5 × 104 cells/well) were transfected with 0.25 μg of DNA and 0.4 μl of Metafectene/well. To investigate cell surface expression, receptors were N-terminally HA-tagged, and cell surface ELISAs were performed. GFP served as a negative control. Three days after transfection, cells were washed, paraformaldehyde-fixed, and probed with biotin-labeled anti-HA antibody (Roche Applied Science). Bound anti-HA antibody was detected by peroxidase-labeled streptavidin (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) and a substrate/chromogen reaction (22Tarnow P. Rediger A. Brumm H. Ambrugger P. Rettenbacher E. Widhalm K. Hinney A. Kleinau G. Schaefer M. Hebebrand J. Krause G. Grüters A. Biebermann H. Obes. Facts. 2008; 1: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Total receptor expression was determined with N-terminally HA-tagged and C-terminally FLAG-tagged receptors. Plasmids were transfected in 6-cm dishes. HA-tagged MC3R was used as a negative control. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested and solubilized overnight. Lysates were incubated in anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma-Aldrich)-coated 96-well plates for 2 h. Detection of the HA epitope was performed as described (23Elsner A. Tarnow P. Schaefer M. Ambrugger P. Krude H. Grüters A. Biebermann H. Peptides. 2006; 27: 372-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were washed and incubated overnight in the presence of [125I-Nle4,d-Phe7]α-MSH (specific activity of 2000 Ci/mmol, 120,000 cpm/well; Amersham Biosciences) with increasing amounts of agonist [125I-Nle4,d-Phe7]α-MSH. After washing, specifically bound [125I-Nle4,d-Phe7]α-MSH was measured. Bmax values were calculated from displacement curves by the method of Cheng and Prusoff (24Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12294) Google Scholar). Intracellular cAMP was investigated after transfection of COS-7 cells by a nonradioactive assay based on AlphaScreen technology (PerkinElmer Life Science). Thus, cells were seeded into 48-well plates and transfected on the next day. One day after transfection, the transfection mixture was replaced with medium. Stimulation of cells with agonists was performed 48 h after transfection. Cells were incubated in serum-free DMEM containing 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma-Aldrich) in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of agonists for 45 min at 37 °C. The reactions were stopped by aspiration of the media, and cells were lysed in 50 μl of lysis buffer (see AlphaScreen manual) containing 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. From each well, 5 μl of lysate was transferred to a 384-well plate. Acceptor beads (in stimulation buffer) and donor beads were added according to the manufacturer's protocol. cAMP accumulation data were analyzed by the GraphPad Prism program. For investigation of Gq/11 activation, we performed an IP3 reporter gene assay by cotransfecting HEK293 cells with plasmid DNA (MC3R or GHSR) and a reporter construct containing a response element and the firefly luciferase gene under the control of NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T-cells). Two days after transfection, cells were stimulated with ghrelin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 6 h and then lysed. Gq/11 activation is determined as luciferase activity in the luciferase reporter gene assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). Crystal structures in the inactive conformation serving for GPCR homology modeling have been published for several family A GPCR members such as rhodopsin, adenosine, and β-adrenergic receptors (reviewed in Refs. 25Worth C.L. Kleinau G. Krause G. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e7011Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar and 26Yarnitzky T. Levit A. Niv M.Y. Curr. Opin. Drug Discov. Devel. 2010; 13: 317-325PubMed Google Scholar). For structural modeling of the human ghrelin receptor and MC3R, we used the inactive rhodopsin structure (Protein Data Bank code 2I35 (27Salom D. Lodowski D.T. Stenkamp R.E. Le Trong I. Golczak M. Jastrzebska B. Harris T. Ballesteros J.A. Palczewski K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 16123-16128Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar)). Furthermore, we also designed a model of the active conformation of GHSR based on opsin, a GPCR crystal structure with features of an activated GPCR conformation (Protein Data Bank code 3CAP (28Park J.H. Scheerer P. Hofmann K.P. Choe H.W. Ernst O.P. Nature. 2008; 454: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar)). The principal modeling procedures were derived according to Kleinau et al. (29Kleinau G. Hoyer I. Kreuchwig A. Haas A.K. Rutz C. Furkert J. Worth C.L. Krause G. Schülein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 25859-25871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Structure images were produced using PyMOL Version 1.03 software. We demonstrated previously that cotransfection of COS-7 or HEK293 cells with equal amounts of MC3R and GHSR induces the formation of the following pairs of receptor dimers (30Rediger A. Tarnow P. Bickenbach A. Schaefer M. Krude H. Gruters A. Biebermann H. Obes. Facts. 2009; 2: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar): MC3R homodimers, GHSR homodimers, and MC3R/GHSR heterodimers. This finding, in combination with the physiological relevance of both receptors for appetite regulation, directed us to question the potential functional importance of GHSR and MC3R heterodimerization. The in vivo combination of in situ hybridization with targeted mouse mutagenesis and immunohistochemistry indicated that the vast majority of GHSR-expressing neurons in the arcuate nucleus also express MC3R, but reciprocally, not all MC3R-expressing neurons express GHSR (Fig. 2). This is consistent with the assumption that MC3R is expressed on POMC as well as on agouti-related peptide/neuropeptide Y (GHSR) neurons (31Cowley M.A. Smart J.L. Rubinstein M. Cerdán M.G. Diano S. Horvath T.L. Cone R.D. Low M.J. Nature. 2001; 411: 480-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). GHSR couples to the Gq/11/phospholipase Cβ system, whereas stimulation of MC3R results in activation of the Gs/adenylyl cyclase system (Fig. 3B). To compare data from cotransfection, constant levels of cotransfected DNA were used. The rat muscarinic 3 receptor (rM3R) signals via the Gq protein coupling system like GHSR, but dimerization of rM3R with MC4R or MC3R could not be observed (23Elsner A. Tarnow P. Schaefer M. Ambrugger P. Krude H. Grüters A. Biebermann H. Peptides. 2006; 27: 372-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used cotransfection with rM3R to ensure equal amounts of transfected plasmid DNA. Stimulation of COS-7 cells coexpressing MC3R and GHSR with α-MSH resulted in a 2-fold higher increase (Table 1) in Gs-induced cAMP accumulation (signaling cAMP surplus) compared with MC3R in the absence of GHSR (Fig. 3A). Using luciferase reporter gene assays, we quantified changes in intracellular Ca2+ levels caused by GHSR signaling in the presence or absence of its ligand. Cotransfection of MC3R and GHSR in HEK293 cells for determination of Gq activation revealed diminished basal as well as impaired ghrelin-induced signaling of the MC3R/GHSR heterodimer. Both basal and MSH-induced signaling were reduced to ∼60% compared with the signaling properties of GHSR alone (Fig. 3C and Table 1).TABLE 1Summary of functional characterization of MC3R, GHSR, and MC3R/GHSR coexpressioncAMPIP3BasalStimulated (1 μm)BasalStimulated (1 μm)-fold MC3R + rM3R basal-fold MC3R + rM3R basalα-MSH MC3R + rM3R1.00 ± 0.2416.7 ± 3.681.00 ± 0.171.36 ± 0.31 MC3R + GHSR1.67 ± 0.6432.5 ± 7.982.80 ± 0.711.93 ± 0.78 GHSR + rM3R2.63 ± 1.536.21 ± 2.664.62 ± 1.644.92 ± 1.31Ghrelin MC3R + rM3R1.00 ± 0.530.73 ± 0.431.00 ± 0.171.30 ± 0.33 MC3R + GHSR1.93 ± 1.141.68 ± 1.022.80 ± 0.714.32 ± 1.09 GHSR + rM3R0.59 ± 0.262.20 ± 0.354.62 ± 1.646.15 ± 2.00α-MSH + ghrelin MC3R + rM3R1.00 ± 0.1921.3 ± 5.871.00 ± 0.171.87 ± 0.55 MC3R + GHSR1.44 ± 0.8534.6 ± 8.042.80 ± 0.712.91 ± 1.05 GHSR + rM3R1.37 ± 0.425.67 ± 3.144.62 ± 1.646.38 ± 1.54 Open table in a new tab Co-stimulation of α-MSH and ghrelin did not change signaling properties profoundly; however, the cAMP response after co-stimulation of α-MSH and ghrelin was further enhanced (Table 1). In summary, our study indicates that MC3R/GHSR coexpression and heterodimerization lead to a mutual and opposite effect on their respective signaling capacities. Because of these findings, we were eager to clarify the molecular reasons for the observed increased capacity of MC3R to induce cAMP accumulation. Three potential mechanisms were under consideration. (i) Up-regulation of MC3R cell surface expression by heterodimerization with GHSR should cause an increased signaling capacity of MC3R in response to α-MSH. The maximal ligand-binding capacity of GPCR depends on the number of receptors expressed on the cell surface. By total receptor expression (Fig. 4A), cell surface expression (Fig. 4B), and ligand binding studies (Fig. 4C), we determined that MC3R expression was not increased in the MC3R/GHSR heterodimer. In conclusion, the MSH-induced signaling surplus in cAMP formation is not due to an increase in MC3R expression. (ii) Hyperstimulation of the Gs pathway might be induced by GHSR or other factors and not by α-MSH-induced MC3R activation. If this holds true, then GHSR might mediate cAMP accumulation in the absence of functional MC3R. To test this hypothesis, we cotransfected a complete loss-of-function mutant of MC3R, I183N (32Tao Y.X. Segaloff D.L. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 89: 3936-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), together with GHSR and measured α-MSH-induced cAMP accumulation (Fig. 5A). The MC3R mutant was still able to bind α-MSH, although with a reduced affinity, and to form dimers with wild-type MC3R and GHSR (supplemental “Materials and Methods” and Fig. S1). However, coupling of the MC3R mutant to its intracellular effectors was greatly diminished (33Rached M. Buronfosse A. Begeot M. Penhoat A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1689: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In other words, the complete loss of MC3R signaling by introduction of the I183N mutation prevented the observed surplus in cAMP formation in cells cotransfected with MC3R and GHSR (Fig. 5A). We therefore conclude that the α-MSH-induced cAMP surplus is dependent on MC3R activation and is not due to G-protein-independent regulation of adenylyl cyclase (for example, by Ca2+ or calmodulin (34Sunahara R.K. Taussig R. Mol. Interv. 2002; 2: 168-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar)). (iii) The basally active conformation of GHSR increases the capacity of MC3R for Gs activation and cAMP accumulation after MSH binding. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the impact of basally active GHSR using naturally occurring GHSR mutations with diminished basal signaling activity as well as the inverse agonist substance P, which has been reported to suppress ligand-independent basal activity (35Holst B. Cygankiewicz A. Jensen T.H. Ankersen M. Schwartz T.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 2201-2210Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). We used two naturally occurring GHSR mutations that lead to either partial or complete lack of basal ligand-independent activity: A204E and F279L (supplemental Fig. S2) (36Pantel J. Legendre M. Cabrol S. Hilal L. Hajaji Y. Morisset S. Nivot S. Vie-Luton M.P. Grouselle D. de Kerdanet M. Kadiri A. Epelbaum J. Le Bouc Y. Amselem S. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 760-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 37Wang H.J. Geller F. Dempfle A. Schäuble N. Friedel S. Lichtner P. Fontenla-Horro F. Wudy S. Hagemann S. Gortner L. Huse K. Remschmidt H. Bettecken T. Meitinger T. Schäfer H. Hebebrand J. Hinney A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 89: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Such mutations can be termed silencing mutations, inverse agonistic mutations, or constitutively inactivating mutations. We assume that both mutations are not located directly in the potential dimerization interface (Fig. 6A). Both mutant receptors were able to homodimerize with wild-type GHSR and to heterodimerize with MC3R (supplemental “Materials and Methods” and Fig. S3). After cotransfection of MC3R with these GHSR mutants, α-MSH challenge demonstrated a reduced or completely abolished cAMP signaling surplus down to the level of MC3R without interactions with GHSR. This observation indicated that the MC3R-related signaling surplus depended entirely on the basal GHSR activity (Fig. 5C). Interestingly, we showed that the signaling properties of GHSR mutants coexpressed with MC3R did not differ from those of the GHSR mutants expressed alone (Fig. 5D and supplemental Fig. S2). Moreover, the complete loss-of-function MC3R variant I183N (Fig. 6B) did not increase the inhibitory effect of MC3R on the basal GHSR signaling activity (Fig. 5B). These results point to a fundamental role of the basally active conformation and signaling of GHSR for functionalities of the MC3R/GHSR heterodimer. This finding is further confirmed by experiments using a GHSR inverse agonist, substance P (Fig. 7C). In a concentration-dependent manner, substance P reduced the maximal MC3R cAMP surplus (obtained after challenge with 1000 nm α-MSH) (Fig. 7A). We independently confirmed that substance P acts as an inverse agonist of GHSR (Fig. 7B). We found that a direct interplay between both receptors, GHSR and MC3R, leads to mutually opposite effects on their signaling capacities (Fig. 3). In the heterodimer, an increased capacity for signaling of MC3R to stimulate cAMP after ligand treatment was observed, but, in contrast, the capacity of GHSR to stimulate inositol phosphate accumulation in the basal and ligand-induced states was diminished. Remarkably, in our approach, we found that partial inactivation of one receptor was caused just by interaction with a second receptor. In other words, we observed an opposite modification of signaling potentials caused by physical interactions of two different receptors. We are aware of the fact that the described findings were obtained from in vitro studies using overexpressing systems. However, low amounts of transfected DNA (see “Experimental Procedure”) and the circumstance that rM3R is not able to interact with MC3R and GHSR (30Rediger A. Tarnow P. Bickenbach A. Schaefer M. Krude H. Gruters A. Biebermann H. Obes. Facts. 2009; 2: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) support the fact that the influence of signaling properties of MC3R and GHSR is not due to non-physiological high expression levels. The known mechanisms of GPCR interaction, such as cross-talk of signaling pathways or cross-activation by one ligand, are likely not relevant in the models studied here. Our findings differ from several studies regarding other GPCR dimers, especially concerning the molecular reasons for particular functional dimer properties. Enhanced signaling after ligand binding, as we found here for MC3R, has been reported for heterodimers between thromboxane receptor isoforms (38Wilson S.J. McGinley K. Huang A.J. Smyth E.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 352: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In contrast to our results, however, this effect was related to specificities of ligands, and investigated receptors were of the same group, sharing identical G-protein preferences. Inhibitory effects in dimer constellations were reported for the GPR50/MT1 melatonin receptor heterodimer (7Levoye A. Dam J. Ayoub M.A. Guillaume J.L. Couturier C. Delagrange P. Jockers R.

It has been recently proposed that posttranslational modification and regulation of CD133 may govern cell surface AC133 recognition. Therefore, we performed a large scale pooled RNA interference (RNAi) screen to identify genes involved in cell surface AC133 expression. Gene hits could be validated at a rate of 70.5% in a secondary assay using an orthogonal RNAi system, demonstrating that our primary RNAi screen served as a powerful genetic screening approach. Within the list of hits from the primary screen, genes involved in N-glycan biosynthesis were significantly enriched as determined by Ingenuity Canonical Pathway analyses. Indeed, inhibiting biosynthesis of the N-glycan precursor using the small molecule tunicamycin or inhibiting its transfer to CD133 by generating N-glycan-deficient CD133 mutants resulted in undetectable cell surface AC133. Among the screen hits involved in N-glycosylation were genes involved in complex N-glycan processing, including the poorly characterized MGAT4C, which we demonstrate to be a positive regulator of cell surface AC133 expression. Our study identifies a set of genes involved in CD133 N-glycosylation as a direct contributing factor to cell surface AC133 recognition and provides biochemical evidence for the function and structure of CD133 N-glycans.

Given the above, this led to the hypothesis that posttranslational modifications and regulation of CD133 are responsible for the cell surface recognition of the AC133 epitope. Because the factors and biological processes involved in regulating cell surface AC133 recognition remain unclear, we took an unbiased genetic screening approach to identify genes that regulate cell surface AC133. We present a large scale RNA interference (RNAi) screening approach targeting 11,248 genes to identify genes involved in cell surface AC133 expression. Genes that were identified as hits from our screen were well represented in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) curated list of N-glycan biosynthesis genes. We demonstrate that N-glycans are required for proper CD133 localization and cell surface AC133 expression. We also implicate the poorly characterized MGAT4C, a predicted glycosyltransferase, in CD133 N-glycosylation. Our data suggest that CD133 acts as an MGAT4C substrate for complex N-glycan processing, which contributes to cell surface AC133 recognition. Taken together, our study provides experimental evidence for the hypothesis that posttranslational modification and regulation of CD133 is responsible for cell surface recognition of AC133.

Hits from our genetic screen were determined by first eliminating shRNAs that appeared above background (>274 intensity) in the AC133high population, in any of the replicates. Second, only shRNAs that appeared in the AC133low population with an intensity ≥1450 in each of the three replicates were considered hits. This resulted in a list of shRNAs that were ≥5-fold higher in the mean AC133low population than in the mean AC133high population (supplemental Table 1). AC133 cell surface expression of HEK293/CD133-VA cells was determined by staining cells with CD133/1(AC133)-PE (130-080-801; Miltenyi Biotec) or CD133/1(AC133)-APC (130-090-826; Miltenyi Biotec) antibody according to the manufacturer's protocol and analyzed using a FACSAria (Becton Dickinson). Cell sorting for the screen was performed by staining HEK293/CD133-VA cells infected with the pooled lentivirus-based shRNA library with the CD133/1(AC133)-PE according to the manufacturer's protocol and counterstaining with propidium iodide at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml. Cells stained positive for propidium iodide were gated out. Cells were sorted using a FACSAria equipped with a 100-mW Coherent Sapphire 488-nm laser and a 20-mW JDS Uniphase 633-nm laser. Flow (version 7.6) was used to analyze data collected from the FACSAria. Cells sorted or analyzed by FACS were briefly treated with trypsin for dissociation. esiRNAs were produced as described previously (24Kittler R. Heninger A.K. Franke K. Habermann B. Buchholz F. Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) with primers containing T7 sequences (supplemental Table 2). An esiRNA against firefly luciferase (esiLuc) was used as a negative control as described previously (25Lawo S. Bashkurov M. Mullin M. Ferreria M.G. Kittler R. Habermann B. Tagliaferro A. Poser I.

Cells transected with 175 ng of esiRNA with 0.3 μl of Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) and suspended in a total of 60 μl of OptiMEM were prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol. The transfection mixtures were reverse transfected into 10,000 HEK293/CD133-VA or HEK293/CD133-YFP cells on tissue culture-treated 96-well glass bottom plates in a volume of 100 μl of DMEM + 10% FBS per well. Medium was changed after 24 h. Targeted gene knockdown by esiRNA was allowed to occur for an additional 48 h. 44 genes were validated using esiRNAs (supplemental Table 2) transfected into HEK293/CD133-VA or HEK 293/CD133-YFP cells, as described above under “esiRNA Interference,” in two independent replicates on 96-well plates (6005182; Packard). 72 h after transfection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (electron microscopy grade; Electron Microscopy Sciences) in PBS (Wisent) for 10 min at room temperature. esiRNA-transfected HEK293/CD133-VA samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C with AC133/1 pure. Samples were washed twice with 0.25% BSA fraction V (Wisent) in PBS and incubated with goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) and Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature away from light. Samples were washed twice with each 0.25% BSA fraction V and PBS. Cells were imaged using the ArrayScan VTI HCS reader automated fluorescent microscope (Cellomics, Thermo Scientific). Images were acquired using a 5× (0.25NA) objective lens and an ORCA-ER 1.00 digital camera. The microscope was set to autofocus in the Hoechst channel identifying individual nuclei based on an intensity value threshold of at least 61 (exposure time 0.008 s). Using the Target Activation Algorithm V3 (Thermo Scientific), an object mask was generated along the nuclei outer border based on the Hoechst intensity. The object mask from the Hoechst channel was copied to the GFP or Cy5 channel and expanded 10 pixels in diameter to cover the entire cell (supplemental Fig. 1). Cell surface AC133 intensity value per object was determined using the Cy5 channel (exposure time 0.8 s). CD133-YFP expression was determined using the GFP channel. 10,000 individual cells from 9 fields covering the entire well were imaged, and quantitative data of AC133 staining per cell or YFP expression per cell were acquired for each sample. Data were exported to Microsoft Excel and analyzed. Nonspecific AC133 staining or background YFP expression from the parental HEK293 cells was subtracted from values. Values were relative to the esiLuc control on the plate. Knockdowns that resulted in mean AC133 or YFP intensity per object of at least three S.D. away from the control esiLuc were considered as hits.

Bischoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20711-20716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Western blot analyses of protein lysates prepared from these cells demonstrated that a specific band at ∼130 kDa corresponded to glycosylated CD133-VA (the VA tag contributes an additional ∼10 kDa to CD133) as determined by immunoblotting with either FLAG and AC133 antibodies (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, FLAG and AC133 immunofluorescence of HEK293/CD133-VA cells displayed a plasma membrane staining pattern (Fig. 1C). This was confirmed further by the cell surface recognition of the AC133 epitope as determined by FACS analysis (Fig. 1D). To obtain a more homogeneously expressing AC133 population, we used FACS to sort the highest 18.5% of cell surface AC133-expressing HEK293/CD133-VA cells (hereafter referred to as HEK293/AC133). We took a loss-of-function RNAi approach to identify genes that regulate cell surface AC133 expression (Fig. 2). To this end, a lentivirus-based pooled short hairpin RNAi (shRNA) library containing ∼54,000 unique shRNAs designed to target 11,248 human genes (hereafter referred to as the 54K pool) was used (20Moffat J.

This resulted in a 185-fold representation of each of the 54K shRNAs. Seven days after infection, pooled shRNA-treated HEK293/AC133 cells were stained with the AC133 antibody and counterstained with propidium iodide, a marker for dead or dying cells. The replicate cell populations were subsequently separated into AC133low (the lowest 2% of the cell population) and AC133high populations (i.e. the remaining 98% of cells) by cell sorting. To quantify the shRNA barcodes from sorted fractions and to determine a target hit list, genomic DNA from each of the AC133low and AC133high sorts (n = 3) was made and used as a template for PCR amplification of shRNA barcodes. shRNA-amplified barcodes were then hybridized to a custom microarray and quantified as described previously (23Ketela T.

The pooled 54K shRNA library was designed to contain a set of negative control shRNAs targeting non-human genes, including green fluorescent protein, red fluorescent protein, β-galactosidase, and firefly luciferase. None of the control shRNAs were identified as a hit in our screen. This supports the list of shRNAs or gene hits from the primary screen as putative regulators of cell surface AC133 expression. We selected 44 target genes that met the criteria described above as a hit in the primary screen for validation in a secondary screen. Among the hits to be validated were genes with functions in transcription, phosphorylation, receptor signaling, extracellular matrix organization, and glycosylation. To circumvent potential off-target effects specific to the shRNAs that were identified as a hits, we used an orthogonal RNAi approach, esiRNAs, to target gene knockdown (24Kittler R. Heninger A.K. Franke K. Habermann B. Buchholz F. Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). HEK293/CD133-VA cells were transfected with individual esiRNAs targeting each of 44 genes in an arrayed format. After 72 h, cells were stained for cell surface AC133 and imaged using a high content imaging platform to quantify AC133 staining per cell for each esiRNA knockdown (supplemental Fig. 1). Given the variable expression level of AC133 in our HEK293/CD133-VA cell line, we took the mean cell surface AC133 staining per cell for each sample well. Gene hits were considered validated if their esiRNA knockdown resulted in a mean cell surface AC133 intensity that was a minimum of 3 S.D. away from the negative control esiRNA targeting firefly luciferase (esiLuc) (supplemental Fig. 2A). 31 of the 44 genes tested could be validated by this c"
https://openalex.org/W1985644715,"Dendritic Cells (DCs) play an important role in the initiation of the immune response by migrating to regional lymph nodes and presenting antigen processed at the inflammatory site to antigen-specific naïve T cells. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) has been reported to play an essential role in DC migration. We reported previously that PGE2 induces matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) expression in DCs and that PGE2-induced MMP-9 is required for DC migration in vivo and in vitro. In this study, we investigated the signaling mechanisms involved in PGE2-induced MMP-9 expression in DCs. We show that PGE2-induced MMP-9 expression is mediated primarily through the EP2/EP4 → cAMP → protein kinase A (PKA)/PI3K → ERK signaling pathway, leading to c-Fos expression, and through JNK-mediated activation of c-Jun in a PKA/PI3K/ERK-independent manner. EP2 and EP4 receptor agonists, as well as cAMP analogs, mimic the up-regulation of MMP-9 by PGE2. PKA, PI3K, and ERK inhibitors abolished PGE2- and cAMP-induced c-Fos and MMP-9 up-regulation, and ERK activation was required for the binding of activator protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factor to the MMP-9 promoter. Our results describe a new molecular mechanism for the effect of PGE2 on MMP-9 production in DCs that could lead to future therapeutic approaches using ERK inhibitors to regulate DC migration."
https://openalex.org/W2068013034,"Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) is an important non-collagenous cartilage protein that is essential for the structural integrity of the cartilage extracellular matrix. The repeated modular structure of COMP allows it to ""bridge"" and assemble multiple cartilage extracellular matrix components such as collagens, matrilins, and proteoglycans. With its modular structure, COMP also has the potential to act as a scaffold for growth factors, thereby affecting how and when the growth factors are presented to cell-surface receptors. However, it is not known whether COMP binds growth factors. We studied the binding interaction between COMP and TGF-β1 in vitro and determined the effect of COMP on TGF-β1-induced signal transduction in reporter cell lines and primary cells. Our results demonstrate that mature COMP protein binds to multiple TGF-β1 molecules and that the peak binding occurs at slightly acidic pH. These interactions were confirmed by dual polarization interferometry and visualized by rotary shadow electron microscopy. There is cation-independent binding of TGF-β1 to the C-terminal domain of COMP. In the presence of manganese, an additional TGF-β-binding site is present in the TSP3 repeats of COMP. Finally, we show that COMP-bound TGF-β1 causes increased TGF-β1-dependent transcription. We conclude that TGF-β1 binds to COMP and that TGF-β1 bound to COMP has enhanced bioactivity."
https://openalex.org/W1973453444,"Rap1b is activated by platelet agonists and plays a critical role in integrin α(IIb)β(3) inside-out signaling and platelet aggregation. Here we show that agonist-induced Rap1b activation plays an important role in stimulating secretion of platelet granules. We also show that α(IIb)β(3) outside-in signaling can activate Rap1b, and integrin outside-in signaling-mediated Rap1b activation is important in facilitating platelet spreading on fibrinogen and clot retraction. Rap1b-deficient platelets had diminished ATP secretion and P-selectin expression induced by thrombin or collagen. Importantly, addition of low doses of ADP and/or fibrinogen restored aggregation of Rap1b-deficient platelets. Furthermore, we found that Rap1b was activated by platelet spreading on immobilized fibrinogen, a process that was not affected by P2Y(12) or TXA(2) receptor deficiency, but was inhibited by the selective Src inhibitor PP2, the PKC inhibitor Ro-31-8220, or the calcium chelator demethyl-1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid tetrakis. Clot retraction was abolished, and platelet spreading on fibrinogen was diminished in Rap1b-deficient platelets compared with wild-type controls. The defects in clot retraction and spreading on fibrinogen of Rap1b-deficient platelets were not rescued by addition of MnCl(2), which elicits α(IIb)β(3) outside-in signaling in the absence of inside-out signaling. Thus, our results reveal two different activation mechanisms of Rap1b as well as novel functions of Rap1b in platelet secretion and in integrin α(IIb)β(3) outside-in signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2091971903,"Aryl-alcohol oxidase (AAO) is a flavoenzyme responsible for activation of O2 to H2O2 in fungal degradation of lignin. The AAO crystal structure shows a buried active site connected to the solvent by a hydrophobic funnel-shaped channel, with Phe-501 and two other aromatic residues forming a narrow bottleneck that prevents the direct access of alcohol substrates. However, ligand diffusion simulations show O2 access to the active site following this channel. Site-directed mutagenesis of Phe-501 yielded a F501A variant with strongly reduced O2 reactivity. However, a variant with increased reactivity, as shown by kinetic constants and steady-state oxidation degree, was obtained by substitution of Phe-501 with tryptophan. The high oxygen catalytic efficiency of F501W, ∼2-fold that of native AAO and ∼120-fold that of F501A, seems related to a higher O2 availability because the turnover number was slightly decreased with respect to the native enzyme. Free diffusion simulations of O2 inside the active-site cavity of AAO (and several in silico Phe-501 variants) yielded >60% O2 population at 3–4 Å from flavin C4a in F501W compared with 44% in AAO and only 14% in F501A. Paradoxically, the O2 reactivity of AAO decreased when the access channel was enlarged and increased when it was constricted by introducing a tryptophan residue. This is because the side chain of Phe-501, contiguous to the catalytic histidine (His-502 in AAO), helps to position O2 at an adequate distance from flavin C4a (and His-502 Nϵ).

Enzyme (10–15 μm) was dissolved in 0.01 m phosphate (pH 6.0), and the absorbance at 463 nm was recorded. The sample was incubated at 100 °C for 5 min and centrifuged to remove the unfolded protein. The supernatant was recovered, and the free FAD concentration was estimated using an ϵ450 of 11,300 m−1 cm−1 (39Macheroux P. Chapman S.K. Reid G.A. Flavoprotein Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 1-7Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was estimated by oxidation of p-methoxybenzyl alcohol (from Sigma-Aldrich) to p-methoxybenzaldehyde (p-anisaldehyde; ϵ285 = 16,950 m−1 cm−1) (16Ferreira P. Medina M. Guillén F. Martínez M.J. Van Berkel W.J. Martínez A.T. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 731-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Maximal steady-state kinetic constants for native AAO and its variants in bisubstrate kinetics were determined in 0.1 m phosphate (pH 6) at 12 °C by varying simultaneously the concentrations of alcohol (in the 10–2000 μm range) and O2 (61, 152, 319, 668, and 1520 μm final concentrations obtained by bubbling buffer with different O2/N2 gas mixtures for 15 min). The two-substrate dependence steady-state kinetic observed rates were fit using SigmaPlot (Systat Software, Richmond, CA) to Equations 1 and 2, which describe a ternary complex mechanism and a ping-pong mechanism, respectively. ve=kcatSBKm(ox)S+Km(Al)B+SB+KdKm(ox)(Eq. 1) ve=kcatSBKm(ox)S+Km(Al)B+SB(Eq. 2) In these equations, e represents the enzyme concentration; kcat is the maximal turnover (under both O2 and reducing substrate saturation); S is the concentration of the alcohol substrate; B is the concentration of O2; Km(Al) and Km(Ox) are the Michaelis constants for S and B, respectively; and Kd is the dissociation constant for the enzyme-substrate complex. An Applied Photophysics SX18.MV stopped-flow spectrophotometer interfaced with an Acorn computer was used to further characterize native AAO and its variants. SX18.MV software and Xscan software were used for experiments with single-wavelength and diode array (350–700 nm) detectors, respectively. Reductive half-reactions were studied under anaerobic conditions (40Fraaije M.W. van Berkel W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18111-18116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Tonometers containing enzyme or substrate solutions were made anaerobic by successive evacuation and flushing with argon. These solutions also contained glucose (10 mm) and glucose oxidase (10 units/ml) to ensure anaerobiosis. Drive syringes in the apparatus were made anaerobic by sequentially passing dithionite and O2-free buffer. Measurements were carried out in 0.1 m phosphate (pH 6) at 12 °C. (AAO reduction was too fast at 25 °C.) Spectral evolution was studied by global analysis and numerical integration methods using Pro-K software (Applied Photophysics Ltd.). Data could be fitted to a single-step A→B model. Accurate observed rate constants (kobs) were obtained from single-wavelength traces at 462 nm and fit into a standard single-exponential decay. kobs values at different substrate concentrations (S) were fitted to Equation 3, kobs=kredSKd+S(Eq. 3) where kred and Kd are the flavin reduction and dissociation constants, respectively. Oxidative half-reactions were studied using the same stopped-flow equipment. The rate constants were measured from the increase of 462 nm absorbance that results from mixing reduced enzyme in anaerobic 0.1 m phosphate (pH 6) with the same buffer equilibrated at varying O2 concentrations (by bubbling O2/N2 gas mixtures for 15 min). Previously, AAO samples were reduced under anaerobic conditions using a modified tonometer with a side arm containing a solution of p-methoxybenzyl alcohol, giving an alcohol/AAO molar ratio of 1.2:1.0 after mixing. After the reduction step, the tonometers were connected to the stopped-flow equipment to study AAO reoxidation. Stopped-flow traces for the oxidative half-reaction were fitted to a single-step model (A→B), as described above, or a double-step model (A→B→C), with the best fitting being chosen in each case. The bimolecular transient-state rate constants for flavin reoxidation were determined with Equation 4, kobs=kox(app)[O2](Eq. 4) where kobs is the observed rate constant of flavin reoxidation at any given concentration of O2, and kox(app) is its apparent second-order rate constant. For monitored enzyme turnover experiments (41Gibson Q.H. Swoboda B.E. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 3927-3934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), air-saturated enzyme and substrate solutions were mixed in the stopped-flow equipment, and evolution of the redox state of the flavin cofactor was monitored. The AAO crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code 3FIM) was prepared using the Protein Preparation Wizard in the Maestro software package (42Schrödinger, LLCMaestro, Version 9.2. Schrödinger LLC, New York2011Google Scholar). Hydrogen atoms were added to the system, and ionizable amino acid side chains were protonated assuming pH of 7.4. SiteMap (43Halgren T. Chem. Biol. Drug Design. 2007; 69: 146-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) was then used to identify any druggable cavities, and GLIDE (44Friesner R.A. Banks J.L. Murphy R.B. Halgren T.A. Klicic J.J. Mainz D.T. Repasky M.P. Knoll E.H. Shelley M. Perry J.K. Shaw D.E. Francis P. Shenkin P.S. J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47: 1739-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (6228) Google Scholar) was used to locate the most favorable docking sites. Appropriate electrostatic potential charges were derived for p-methoxybenzyl by a quantum mechanical optimization using density functional theory: the hybrid B3LYP together with the 6-31G* basis set available in Jaguar (45Schrödinger LLCJaguar, Version 7.8. Schrödinger LCC, New York2011Google Scholar). We then proceeded to use PELE software for the study of ligand migration (37Borrelli K.W. Vitalis A. Alcantara R. Guallar V. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2005; 1: 1304-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). PELE combines a steered stochastic approach with protein structure prediction methods, capable of projecting the migration dynamics of ligands in proteins (46Borrelli K. Cossins B. Guallar V. J. Comp. Chem. 2010; 31: 1224-1235PubMed Google Scholar, 47Guallar V. Lu C. Borrelli K. Egawa T. Yeh S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 3106-3116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Simulations were performed on the wild-type protein and after in silico mutation of Phe-501 to tyrosine, tryptophan, and alanine. The ligands p-methoxybenzyl and O2 were placed on the surface of the protein as derived by GLIDE. Several simulations were run where the ligand is biased toward the C4a-N5 locus of the flavin ring. This is done where multiple processors share the information of a reaction coordinate. For further description of the method, see Borrelli et al. (37Borrelli K.W. Vitalis A. Alcantara R. Guallar V. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2005; 1: 1304-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In this way, we could identify the possible pathways for both ligands toward the active site. Also, O2 diffusion inside the active-site cavity in all structures was computed with PELE. The initial structure for these calculations was the final snapshot from the previous O2 migration where the ligand resides inside the cavity. The ligand is then allowed free movement, but small perturbations are employed to avoid the escape of the ligand. The FAD cofactor position in the center of the AAO molecule and the hydrophobic funnel-shaped channel connecting the solvent with the small active-site cavity in front of the cofactor upper part are shown in Fig. 1. Two conserved histidine residues (His-502 and His-546) orient their side chains to the above cavity. Just before the active site, the access channel is constricted by a bottleneck involving Phe-501 and two other aromatic residues (Tyr-92 and Phe-397). When PELE received the task of migrating the AAO-reducing (p-methoxybenzyl alcohol) and AAO-oxidizing (O2) substrates from the wide entrance of the channel (identified by SiteMap) to the active site of the oxidized or reduced enzyme, respectively, the results differed strongly. The access channel of AAO (Fig. 1A) is too narrow for p-methoxybenzyl alcohol diffusion to the active site. Considerable reorganization of the Phe-397 side chain, the most mobile among the three aromatic side chains delimiting the channel bottleneck, is required for alcohol access (Fig. 2A). The Phe-397 side chain interacts with the alcohol aromatic ring, and both move together to provide access to the active site, where the alcohol attains a catalytically relevant position. This includes the hydroxyl hydrogen and one of the Cα hydrogens of p-anisyl alcohol at a distance of 2.4–2.5 Å from the Nϵ of δ-deprotonated His-502 and the oxidized flavin N5, respectively. Such a position is consistent with the consensus mechanism in GMC oxidoreductases that involves proton transfer to a catalytic base (His-502 in AAO) and hydride transfer to the oxidized cofactor flavin (26Gadda G. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 13745-13753Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The PELE-predicted diffusion pathway of p-anisyl alcohol is produced above the Tyr-92 aromatic ring, which would also experience some rearrangements helping the alcohol to attain its final position, and far from the Phe-501 side chain. In contrast to that found for p-anisyl alcohol, the O2 access to the active site of reduced AAO, as predicted by PELE, basically follows the funnel-shaped channel depicted in the crystal structure (Fig. 1A). In this way, the pathway proceeds next to Phe-501, below Phe-397, and in front of Tyr-92, whose side chains are not significantly displaced during this first diffusion phase (Fig. 2B). Once at the active-site cavity, the O2 molecule largely explores this cavity, as described below for native AAO and three site-directed variants, and some displacement of the Phe-397 side chain is produced during this phase. A catalytically relevant final position of O2 for flavin oxidation is shown in Fig. 3. At this position, the oxygen atoms are at distances of 2.5 and 3.7 Å, respectively, from the Hϵ of His-502 and the C4a of reduced flavin, both involved in O2 reduction, and at a distance of 2.8 Å from the closest hydrogen atom of the Phe-501 side chain, whose contribution to the oxidative half-reaction is described below. Several AAO variants were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis of Phe-501 to investigate its effect on catalysis. The F501A, F501Y, and F501W variants showed characteristic electronic absorption spectra with a FAD maximum at 463 nm (supplemental Fig. S2), which revealed proper refolding and cofactor incorporation. The steady-state kinetic constants of native AAO and the above three variants are shown in Table 1. Because bisubstrate kinetics were performed, both maximal alcohol (Al) and molecular oxygen (Ox) Michaelis-Menten constants (Km) and catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km) are provided (by extrapolating to substrate saturation) in addition to the maximal turnover numbers (kcat). The alcohol and O2 kinetic constants for the F501Y variant were only slightly different from those of native AAO, revealing that the inclusion of a phenolic hydroxyl in the Phe-501 side chain does not significantly affect AAO catalysis. In contrast, the F501A mutation resulted in a low activity variant, whose catalytic efficiencies for p-methoxybenzyl alcohol (15-fold lower) and especially for O2 (70-fold lower) were strongly decreased. Because the F501A turnover rate was <3-fold lowered, we conclude that the main effect of the mutation concerns AAO availability of both O2 and alcohol substrates at the active site. Finally, the F501W mutation increased the AAO catalytic efficiency by almost 2-fold with respect to O2 concentration due to the nearly 3-fold decrease in Km(Ox), which suggests improved O2 availability, in contrast with the lowered alcohol affinity (due to the presence of a bulky residue at the active site) shown by both steady-state and transient-state kinetics.TABLE 1Steady-state kinetic constants of native AAO and three Phe-501 variants for p-methoxybenzyl alcohol and O2 substrateskcatKm(Al)kcat/Km(Al)Km(Ox)kcat/Km(Ox)s−1μms−1 mm−1μms−1 mm−1AAO105 ± 129 ± 13620 ± 80134 ± 3784 ± 20F501Y87 ± 117 ± 15120 ± 310180 ± 5483 ± 13F501W64 ± 1249 ± 5257 ± 6.546 ± 21390 ± 50F501A40 ± 1167 ± 5240 ± 93600 ± 11011 ± 0.5 Open table in a new tab Next, the redox state of the enzyme cofactor during oxidized AAO reaction with p-methoxybenzyl alcohol under an air atmosphere was monitored using the stopped-flow diode array and single-wavelength detectors for native AAO and its site-directed variants (Fig. 4, A–C). The percentage of oxidized enzyme during turnover of native AAO and its directed variants was estimated at 462 nm, as shown in Fig. 4D using a logarithmic time scale. After an up to 4-ms lag period, which, in the slow-reacting F501A variant, includes a small absorbance increase due to enzyme-substrate complex formation, as previously described for native AAO (24Ferreira P. Hernandez-Ortega A. Herguedas B. Martínez A.T. Medina M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 24840-24847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the spectra show a rapid decrease, followed by a period of relatively stable absorbance once the steady-state conditions were attained in the reaction chamber. We observed that, under the latter conditions, over 75–80% of the enzyme was in the oxidized form during steady-state turnover of native AAO and its F501W and F501Y variants (which started ∼20 ms after mixing), indicating that the reductive half-reaction is the limiting step in catalysis for these enzymes. However, the oxidative half-reaction would be the slower process in the F501A variant, with only 20% of the enzyme in the oxidized form under steady-state turnover (which, in this case, started ∼200 ms after mixing).

We observed high levels of both primary transcript and end-matured, intron-containing pre-tRNAs in the maf1Δ strain. This pre-tRNA accumulation could be overcome by transcription inhibition, arguing against a direct role of Maf1 in tRNA maturation and suggesting saturation of processing machinery by the increased amounts of primary transcripts. Saturation of the tRNA exportin, Los1, is one reason why end-matured intron-containing pre-tRNAs accumulate in maf1Δ cells. However, it is likely possible that other components of the processing pathway are also limiting when tRNA transcription is increased. According to our model, Maf1-mediated transcription control and nuclear export by Los1 are two major stages of tRNA biosynthesis that are regulated by environmental conditions in a coordinated manner."

Structurally, tetherin consists of an N-terminal transmembrane (TM) region, a central coiled coil motif, and a putative C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor motif. A current working model proposes that BST-2 inhibits virus release by physically tethering viral particles to the cell surface via its TM motif and GPI anchor.

Conversely, replacing the TM region of CD4 by the putative GPI anchor signal of human BST-2 resulted in proper membrane targeting and surface expression of the chimeric protein, indicating that the BST-2 GPI anchor signal can function as a bona fide TM region.

HIV-1 must overcome several host defense mechanisms to establish an efficient infection. Trim-5α, APOBEC3G, and BST-2/tetherin are among those restriction factors that target different stages of viral replication (for reviews, see Refs. 1Andrew A. Strebel K. J.

APOBEC3G and BST-2 are targeted and functionally inactivated by dedicated viral proteins. Although Vif is expressed by almost all primate lentiviruses and is the only protein in these viruses capable of controlling APOBEC3G, there is no unique viral gene product targeting BST-2. In fact, three different lentiviral proteins have been implicated in the control of BST-2: HIV-1 uses Vpu, HIV-2 uses its Env glycoprotein, and simian immunodeficiency virus uses Nef. All three proteins are either integral membrane proteins (Vpu and Env) or membrane-associated by means of a myristic acid modification (Nef) and are thought to interfere with BST-2 function via direct physical interaction.

A current model suggests that BST-2 tethers mature virions to the cell surface by means of its N-terminal TM region and C-terminal GPI anchor (5Neil S.J. Zang T. Bieniasz P.D. Nature. 2008; 451: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar). Indeed, immune electron microscopy confirmed that BST-2 could be found on virions tethered to the cell surface (14Perez-Caballero D. Zang T. Ebrahimi A. McNatt M.W. Gregory D.A. Johnson M.C.

In addition, Perez-Caballero et al. (14Perez-Caballero D. Zang T. Ebrahimi A. McNatt M.W. Gregory D.A. Johnson M.C. Bieniasz P.D. Cell. 2009; 139: 499-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) demonstrated that an artificial tetherin consisting of the N-terminal TM region of transferrin receptor, a coiled coil ectodomain of the cytoplasmic dimeric protein dystrophia myotonica protein kinase, and a GPI anchor signal derived from urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) is capable of inhibiting the release of HIV-1 virions tethered to the cell surface. However, much of the evidence for BST-2 containing a GPI anchor in addition to a transmembrane region consists of experimental data performed on rat BST-2, which is only 33% identical to the human protein, and is largely indirect (8Kupzig S. Korolchuk V. Rollason R. Sugden A. Wilde A. Banting G. Traffic. 2003; 4: 694-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 21Rollason R. Korolchuk V. Hamilton C. Schu P. Banting G. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 3850-3858Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Typical GPI-anchored proteins contain initially two hydrophobic motifs. The N-terminal hydrophobic motif acts as signal peptide that targets the protein to the ER and is removed by N-terminal peptidase. A second hydrophobic segment at the C terminus is part of the GPI anchor signal and is removed upon GPI anchor modification. Thus, the vast majority of mature GPI-anchored proteins lack a TM region (22Brown D. Waneck G.L. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1992; 3: 895-906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), making BST-2 one of only a few proteins carrying a TM region in addition to a GPI anchor. In fact, Kupzig et al. (8Kupzig S. Korolchuk V. Rollason R. Sugden A. Wilde A. Banting G. Traffic. 2003; 4: 694-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) reported that, aside from rat BST-2 analyzed in their study, only four other naturally occurring proteins are known to be anchored in the membrane by both a TM region and a GPI anchor. Experimental verification of GPI anchor modification of proteins containing an additional TM region is technically challenging. The most common assay used for typical GPI-anchored proteins is the release of the proteins from the membrane by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) treatment, which cleaves the protein at the GPI anchor and releases it from the membrane (23Doering, T. L., Englund, P. T., Hart, G. W. (2001) Curr. Protoc. Mol. Biol. Chapter 17, Unit 17.8.Google Scholar). However, proteins containing a TM region will remain membrane-associated under such conditions. Kupzig et al. (8Kupzig S. Korolchuk V. Rollason R. Sugden A. Wilde A. Banting G. Traffic. 2003; 4: 694-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) used a variety of methods to demonstrate GPI anchor modification of rat BST-2. Among those is PI-PLC treatment, which made rat BST-2 susceptible to Triton X-100 extraction (i.e. resulted in loss of raft association). In addition, PI-PLC treatment of BST-2-expressing rat cells resulted in positive staining by an anti-cross-reactive determinant antibody, which can bind to a cross-reactive determinant epitope that is exposed upon PI-PLC treatment (24Cardoso de Almeida M.L. Turner M.J. Nature. 1983; 302: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Furthermore, treatment of cells with PI-PLC decreased the internalization of BST-2 from the cell surface and lipid raft association, which would implicate a GPI anchor in this process (21Rollason R. Korolchuk V. Hamilton C. Schu P. Banting G. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 3850-3858Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Although all of these experiments are suggestive of a GPI anchor modification, none of them provides direct experimental evidence. As mentioned above, human BST-2 shares only 33% amino acid identity with the rat protein. However, like the rat protein, human BST-2 is predicted by bioinformatics tools to be GPI anchor-modified. Unfortunately, bioinformatics tools are not foolproof especially because there is no consensus sequence for GPI anchor modification. It is therefore necessary to experimentally verify GPI anchor addition. Given that GPI anchor modification of transmembrane proteins appears to be extremely rare in nature and given the lack of direct experimental evidence for GPI anchor modification of either rat or human BST-2, the goal of the current study was to further investigate GPI anchor modification of human BST-2. We used a variety of biochemical assays, including PI-PLC treatment, aerolysin treatment, and gradual truncation of the putative GPI anchor signal. We were unable to verify GPI anchor modification of human BST-2. Instead, we found strong evidence that the C-terminal putative GPI anchor signal in human BST-2 represents in fact a second TM region. This conclusion is supported by the following observations. (i) The C-terminal putative GPI anchor motif can be transferred to a heterologous protein and function as a TM motif. (ii) C-terminally epitope-tagged BST-2 is functional. Importantly, the C-terminal tag was not subject to proteolytic removal by the GPI modification machinery and localized to the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane. (iii) Deletion of 2 C-terminal residues from untagged BST-2 did not affect BST-2 function but can be visualized as a shift in protein mobility, arguing against proteolytic removal of the GPI signal peptide. (iv) Replacing the GPI anchor motif in human BST-2 with the TM segment of heterologous proteins can yield BST-2 capable of inhibiting virus release. The full-length infectious HIV-1 molecular clone pNL4-3 and the Vpu deletion mutant pNL4-3/Udel have been described (25Adachi A. Gendelman H.E. Koenig S. Folks T. Willey R. Rabson A. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1986; 59: 284-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Klimkait T. Strebel K. Hoggan M.D. Martin M.A. Orenstein J.M. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 621-629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pcDNA-BST-2 is a vector for the expression of human BST-2 under the control of the cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter (13Andrew A.J. Miyagi E. Kao S. Strebel K. Retrovirology. 2009; 6: 80Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). C-terminal deletion mutants of BST-2 (Δ2, Δ3, Δ4, Δ5, Δ10, Δ15, Δ18, and Δ21; see Fig. 7A) were constructed in the backbone of pcDNA-BST-2 N1/N2 (13Andrew A.J. Miyagi E. Kao S. Strebel K. Retrovirology. 2009; 6: 80Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). BST-2 N1/N2 encodes non-glycosylated but functional BST-2 and was used here to facilitate visualization of differences in the electrophoretic mobility of BST-2 deletion mutants. HA-tagged BST-2 constructs encoding HA epitope tags at the N terminus (BST-2N), in the ectodomain following BST-2 residue 148 (BST-2I), or at the C terminus (BST-2C) were constructed using PCR-based methodologies. Plasmid pcDNA-CD4 encoding CD4 with a shortened 3′-untranslated region was constructed by subcloning a 1.7-kb EcoRI/BamHI fragment from pHIV-CD4 (27Willey R.L. Maldarelli F. Martin M.A. Strebel K. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 226-234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) into pcDNA3.1. Plasmid pcDNA-CD4-TM1 was constructed by replacing the CD4 TM region in pcDNA-CD4 (residues Met397–Phe418) with the N-terminal TM segment of BST-2 (Leu22–Ile46) using PCR-based strategies. Similarly, pcDNA-CD4-TM2 was constructed by replacing the CD4 TM region (residues Met397–Phe418) with the C-terminal putative TM region of BST-2 (Ala164–Leu179). pcDNA-CD4-ΔTM was constructed by removing the CD4 TM region (residues Met397–Phe418). To construct pcDNA-BST-2 CD40, pcDNA-BST-2 CD45, and pcDNA-BST-2 transferrin receptor (TfR) chimeras, the GPI anchor signal/putative C-terminal TM region in BST-2 (Ser162–Leu178) was replaced with the TM region sequence of CD40 (ALVVIPIIFGILFAILLVLVFI), CD45 (ALIAFLAFLI IVTSIALLVVLY) (28Bock J. Gulbins E. FEBS Lett. 2003; 534: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), or TfR (CSGSICYGTIAVIVFFLIGFMIGYLGYC) (29Zerial M. Melancon P. Schneider C. Garoff H.

All constructs were verified by sequence analysis.FIGURE 1TM regions of CD40 and TfR can functionally replace putative GPI anchor of human BST-2.

Monoclonal antibodies to tubulin and actin were obtained from Sigma. A monoclonal antibody to CD55 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). HA-specific mouse monoclonal antibody was from Roche Diagnostics. A rabbit polyclonal antibody reacting with the CD4 ectodomain was produced by immunizing a rabbit with recombinant CD4-IgG fusion protein (generously provided by Genentech Inc.). A polyclonal antibody specific for the CD4 cytoplasmic domain, CD4cyto, was produced by immunizing a rabbit with keyhole limpet hemocyanin-coupled peptide CVRCRHRRRQAERMSQIKRLLSEKKTCQC (31Bour S. Perrin C. Strebel K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33800-33806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A mouse monoclonal antibody to the CD4 ectodomain (OKT4) was obtained from eBioscience (San Diego, CA). Serum from an HIV-positive patient was used to detect HIV-1-specific capsid protein. A mouse monoclonal antibody to aerolysin was obtained from Dr. Peter Howard (University of Saskatchewan). HeLa and 293T cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). HeLa TZM-bl cells were obtained from the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, National Institutes of Health (donated by Dr. John C. Kappes, Dr. Xiaoyun Wu, and Tranzyme Inc.) and propagated as the HeLa cells. For transfection, cells were grown in 25-cm2 flasks to about 80% confluence. Cells were transfected using TransIT®-LT1 (Mirus, Madison WI) or Lipofectamine PLUSTM (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's recommendations. A total of 5 μg of plasmid DNA/25-cm2 flask was used. Total amounts of transfected DNA were kept constant in all samples of any given experiment by adding empty vector DNA as appropriate. Cells were harvested 24 h post-transfection. For immunoblot analysis of intracellular proteins, whole cell lysates were prepared as follows. Cells were washed once with PBS, suspended in PBS (400 μl/107 cells), and mixed with an equal volume of sample buffer (4% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.002% bromphenol blue). Proteins were solubilized by boiling for 10–15 min at 95 °C with occasional vortexing of the samples to shear cellular DNA. Residual insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (2 min at 15,000 rpm in an Eppendorf minicentrifuge). Cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes and incubated with appropriate antibodies as described in the text. Membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). Cells were washed three times with PBS, then scraped, and moved to an Eppendorf tube. Cells were spun at 400 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was then resuspended in 500 μl of HB buffer (250 mm sucrose, 3 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA) and centrifuged at 1100 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was then resuspended in 500 μl of HB buffer and lysed by passage through a 22-gauge syringe 20 times. Cell lysis was verified by microscopy. The lysate was then centrifuged at 1600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The postnuclear supernatant was divided into two aliquots: one for the total fraction and one for membrane analysis. One fraction of postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 51,000 rpm in a TLA 100.1 rotor for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was moved to a fresh tube on ice for the soluble fraction. The pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of fresh Na2CO3 (100 mm, pH 11.0) and incubated on ice for 15 min. The suspension was centrifuged at 83,000 rpm in a TLA 100.1 rotor for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was moved to a fresh tube on ice for the peripheral membrane fraction. The pellet was again resuspended in 100 μl of fresh Na2CO3, incubated on ice for 15 min, and centrifuged at 83,000 rpm in a TLA 100.1 rotor for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was added to the peripheral membrane fraction. The final pellet, which contains integral membranes, was resuspended in 200 μl of HB buffer containing 1.0% Triton X-100. 293T cells were transfected as indicated in the text. Transfected cells were trypsinized, and single cell suspensions were distributed into 12-well plates containing 0.13-mm coverslips. Cells were grown for 15 h at 37 °C in DMEM containing 10% FBS. Cells were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield PA) for 30 min at room temperature followed by three washes in PBS. For permeabilization, cells were incubated in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 4 min followed by two washes in PBS. Cells were blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 30 min. For antibody staining, coverslips were incubated with appropriate primary antibodies in 1% BSA in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed three times with PBS and mounted onto microscope slides with glycerol gelatin (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 0.1 m N-propyl gallate (Sigma) to prevent photobleaching. For confocal microscopy, a Zeiss LSM410 inverted laser-scanning microscope equipped with a krypton/argon mixed gas laser was used. Images were acquired with a Plan-Apochromat 63×/1.4 oil immersion objective (Zeiss). Image quality was enhanced during data acquisition using the LSM line average feature (8×). Postacquisition digital image enhancement was performed using the LSM software. Virus stocks were prepared by transfection of 293T cells with the indicated plasmid DNAs. Virus-containing supernatants were harvested 24 h after transfection. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation (3 min at 1500 rpm), and clarified supernatants were filtered (0.45 μm) to remove residual cellular debris. 100 μl of viral stock was used to infect 5 × 104 TZM-bl cells in a 24-well plate in a total volume of 1.1 ml. Infection was allowed for 48 h at 37 °C. Medium was removed, and cells were lysed in 300 μl of Promega 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega Corp., Madison WI) and frozen at −80 °C for a minimum of 30 min. To determine the luciferase activity in the lysates, 5 μl of each lysate was combined with luciferase substrate (Promega Corp.) by automatic injection, and light emission was measured for 10 s at room temperature in a luminometer (Optocomp II, MGM Instruments, Hamden, CT). Each assay was performed at least twice with triplicate infections. Aerolysin assays were conducted essentially as described (32Iacovache I. Paumard P. Scheib H. Lesieur C. Sakai N. Matile S. Parker M.W. van der Goot F.G. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 457-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Proaerolysin was obtained from Dr. Peter Howard (University of Saskatchewan). Briefly, HeLa cells were washed with PBS, scraped, and resuspended in 1 ml of PBS. The cells were pelleted, frozen, lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100), and incubated on ice for 20 min. Cell lysates were pelleted at 13,000 × g for 2 min to remove insoluble material. The supernatant was recovered, and the proaerolysin was activated by treatment with trypsin (50 μg/ml) for 10 min at room temperature. The trypsin was inactivated by addition of protease inhibitor (Complete Mini, Roche Applied Science). The lysate was then divided into two equal fractions. Aerolysin (final concentration, 300 ng/ml) was added to one of the fractions. Both fractions were then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C followed by 10 min at 37 °C. Aerolysin-treated and untreated fractions were then divided into two equal aliquots, which were immunoprecipitated with antibody to CD55 or BST-2, respectively, bound to Protein A-Sepharose beads (1 h at 4 °C). Samples were washed twice with wash buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100). To avoid co-migration of CD55 with immunoglobulin heavy chains, CD55 immunoprecipitates were eluted by heating in buffer lacking 2-mercaptoethanol (10 min at 95 °C). Immunoprecipitated BST-2 was divided into two aliquots: one sample was eluted by heating in buffer lacking 2-mercaptoethanol (10 min at 95 °C) to look for the presence of aerolysin, and the other half was eluted by heating in reducing sample buffer for 10 min at 95 °C to verify BST-2 immunoprecipitation. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis as indicated in the text. Antibodies bound to beads were included as a control for IgG. Clone Manager software (v9; Scientific & Educational Software, Cary, NC) was used for hydropathy plot analysis. “MemType-2L” is a web-based server for the prediction of membrane proteins and their types (33Chou K.C.

https://openalex.org/W1997716435,"Two different mutations at Gly-90 in the second transmembrane helix of the photoreceptor protein rhodopsin have been proposed to lead to different phenotypes. G90D has been classically associated with congenital night blindness, whereas the newly reported G90V substitution was linked to a retinitis pigmentosa phenotype. Here, we used Val/Asp replacements of the native Gly at position 90 to unravel the structure/function divergences caused by these mutations and the potential molecular mechanisms of inherited retinal disease. The G90V and G90D mutants have a similar conformation around the Schiff base linkage region in the dark state and same regeneration kinetics with 11-cis-retinal, but G90V has dramatically reduced thermal stability when compared with the G90D mutant rhodopsin. The G90V mutant also shows, like G90D, an altered photobleaching pattern and capacity to activate Gt in the opsin state. Furthermore, the regeneration of the G90V mutant with 9-cis-retinal was improved, achieving the same A(280)/A(500) as wild type isorhodopsin. Hydroxylamine resistance was also recovered, indicating a compact structure around the Schiff base linkage, and the thermal stability was substantially improved when compared with the 11-cis-regenerated mutant. These results support the role of thermal instability and/or abnormal photoproduct formation in eliciting a retinitis pigmentosa phenotype. The improved stability and more compact structure of the G90V mutant when it was regenerated with 9-cis-retinal brings about the possibility that this isomer or other modified retinoid analogues might be used in potential treatment strategies for mutants showing the same structural features."

TREs are frequently found in the control region of many cellular and viral genes and serve as the binding platform for Jun and Fos family members as well as certain bZIP-containing proteins. In humans, three members in the Jun family (c-Jun, JunB, and JunD) can form homodimers or heterodimers within the same family members or with members in the Fos family, which consists of c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, and Fra-2. Members of the Fos family are not able to form homodimers (2Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3248) Google Scholar). Conceptually, a total of 18 AP-1 dimeric complexes can be generated between Jun and Fos family members, thus creating a regulatory circuit modulating transcription of a diverse set of genes implicated in cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (3Jochum W.

Kerppola T.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2438-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). This situation is further complicated by the fact that not every putative binding site is recognized by its cognate trans-acting factors, considering the dynamics of nucleosomal histones that may or may not present the sequence element in the right configuration accessible for direct protein-DNA interaction (8Sahu G.

Accordingly, the likelihood and nature of protein-DNA contacts need to be examined on an individual basis even though the development of mathematic modeling and algorithms in computational biology has greatly facilitated the identification of putative cis-acting elements likely to be crucial for gene regulation.In human papillomaviruses (HPVs), two AP-1 binding sites located in the upstream regulatory region (URR) of the E6 promoter driving the expression of virus-encoded E6 and E7 oncoproteins have been identified (10Chan W.K.

Although the importance of these two AP-1 sites in HPVs has long been recognized, the identities of protein factors acting through these two AP-1 sites and the molecular action of these trans-acting factors in HPV chromatin-dependent transcription have not been convincingly established. This is due to the difficulty in obtaining naturally assembled full-length AP-1 complexes for mechanistic studies in vitro and the limitation and variability of antibody detection of AP-1 association with its in vivo targets in native chromatin environments. Further complications in the analysis of AP-1 function lie in the dependence of epithelial cell differentiation for HPV propagation in vivo (20Meyers C. Frattini M.G. Hudson J.B. Laimins L.A.

To date it is still unclear which forms of AP-1 complexes are functionally important in HPV transcription and the specific target sites in the HPV URR that serve as the platform for transcription complex assembly.Using an in vitro chromatin transcription system reconstituted with purified HeLa core histones, recombinant nucleosome assembly protein 1 (NAP-1) histone chaperon, and the ATP-utilizing chromatin assembly and remodeling factor (ACF), we have demonstrated that a specific form of AP-1 complex, c-Jun/c-Fos, is able to switch on transcription from an HPV type 11 (HPV-11) URR-containing chromatin template (25Wu S.Y. Lee A.Y. Hou S.Y. Kemper J.K. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Chiang C.M. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2383-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). With our recent adaptation of a bacterial co-expression system that enables us to purify full-length recombinant human AP-1 dimers (26Wang W.M. Lee A.Y. Chiang C.M. Protein Expr. Purif. 2008; 59: 144-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), we are now able to define the role of each AP-1 complex in HPV chromatin-dependent transcription and reveal novel AP-1 sites that have not yet been characterized because of their deviation from the consensus TRE. All of these non-canonical AP-1 sites are also present in different types of HPVs in various combinations, indicating the existence of an intricate interplay between cis-elements and trans-acting factors in generating the regulatory circuit diversity to modulate HPV transcription in response to constantly changeable cellular environments.DISCUSSIONAP-1 belongs to a bZIP-containing family of transcription factors regulating basal and induced expression of diverse cellular and viral proteins implicated in proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, immortalization, inflammation, organogenesis, and tumorigenesis. The ability of AP-1 to control these broad and often counteracting biological processes lies in the wide-ranging compositions of dimeric AP-1 complexes generated not only between Jun and Fos family members but also extending to other related bZIP proteins (7Chinenov Y. Kerppola T.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2438-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). In addition, the transcriptional activity of AP-1 is fine-tuned by its association with distinct interacting partners, post-translational modification, redox-potential changes, and signaling events triggered by cytokines, growth factors, and viral and bacterial infection frequently in a promoter-dependent and stimulus- and cell-type-specific manner. Although the biological roles of Jun and Fos family proteins have been extensively investigated by gain- and loss-of-function studies in animals and cultured cells (2Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3248) Google Scholar, 36Vogt P.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2365-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 37Milde-Langosch K. Eur. J.

Guinea-Viniegra J. Wagner E.F. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2011; 70: i109-i112Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), the biochemical characterization of AP-1 activity and the molecular understanding of its action have significantly lagged behind. This deficiency is in part attributed to the difficulty in obtaining full-length dimeric AP-1 complexes active in DNA binding and transcription for mechanistic studies in vitro.Our successful purification of homodimeric c-Jun/c-Jun and heterodimeric c-Jun/Fos complexes made it possible for the first time to directly compare the functional properties of these dimeric AP-1 complexes in recognizing non-canonical AP-1 sequence elements found in a native HPV genome and define their transcriptional activity from in vitro-reconstituted HPV chromatin that faithfully recapitulates nucleosomal phasing seen in vivo (25Wu S.Y. Lee A.Y. Hou S.Y. Kemper J.K. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Chiang C.M. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2383-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). We found that all c-Jun-containing complexes have intrinsic trans-activating activity in initiating transcription from silenced HPV chromatin (Fig. 4D), including Fra-1 and Fra-2 that were previously thought to be incapable of activating transcription due to the lack of comparable activation domains as found in the C-terminal region of c-Fos and FosB (41Wisdon R. Verma I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7429-7438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data, however, are consistent with knock-in studies showing Fra-1 can functionally replace c-Fos in mice (42Fleischmann A. Hafezi F. Elliott C. Remé C.E. Rüther U. Wagner E.F. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2695-2700Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), indicating factor redundancy among Fos family members with conserved biological function, and are also in agreement with transfection assay illustrating artificially tethered c-Jun/Fra-1 and c-Jun/Fra-2 single-chain dimers are able to stimulate AP-1-dependent reporter gene activity (43Bakiri L. Matsuo K. Wisniewska M. Wagner E.F. Yaniv M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4952-4964Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that dimerization with c-Jun allows Fra-1 and Fra-2 to employ the activation domain in the partner protein to activate transcription. From this point of view, it is not surprising that c-Jun/c-Fos is generally considered a more potent activator when compared with c-Jun/FosB, c-Jun/Fra-1, and c-Jun/Fra-2 (Fig. 4D), as two distinct activation domains in c-Jun/c-Fos cooperatively (44Abate C. Luk D. Curran T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3624-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and more efficiently recruit components of the general transcription machinery (45Thomas M.C. Chiang C.M. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2006; 41: 105-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar) to the regulated promoters. The thermostability of c-Jun/c-Fos and other heterodimers is significantly higher than that of the c-Jun/c-Jun homodimer (2Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3248) Google Scholar), resulting in more protein-DNA complexes (see Fig. 1E and Table 1) for subsequent transcription complex assembly. Nevertheless, dimerization clearly generates cooperative activation domains that compensate for the weak DNA binding activity as further exemplified by the c-Jun/c-Jun homodimer that has strong transcriptional activity (Fig. 4D) even though its DNA binding potential is generally low, particularly at low concentrations (Fig. 5E). Considering these, it is interesting to note that c-Jun, c-Fos, and Fra-2 are detected primarily in terminally differentiated skin cells, whereas JunB, JunD, and Fra-1 seem to express early in basal cells and gradually diminish upon differentiation (23Angel P. Szabowski A. Schorpp-Kistner M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2413-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Clearly, AP-1 activity is required for every stage of the differentiation process that is tightly linked to the HPV life cycle, and the exchange of Jun and Fos family members ensures a smooth transition of AP-1 activity to selectively modulate cellular and viral gene expression necessary for different stages of the life cycle. Identification of reprogrammed transcriptome and proteome components triggered by the switch of distinct AP-1 members throughout the epithelial cell growth and differentiation process will be critical to unravel the role of cellular factors implicating in the propagation of HPV.Recruitment of a HAT enzyme to targeted genes in chromatin is often an activator-dependent event (28Thomas M.C. Chiang C.M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 251-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 46Brown C.E. Lechner T. Howe L. Workman J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 15-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Without AP-1, p300 cannot access HPV chromatin. Acetylation of nucleosomal core histones by p300 only takes place when AP-1 is present (Fig. 6D). This AP-1-triggered chromatin acetylation requires AP-1 action before or concomitant with the entry of p300 that also results in robust transcription from HPV chromatin (Fig. 5F). A direct protein-protein interaction between p300 and AP-1 is essential, as the HAT domain alone that is sufficient for mediating p53-dependent chromatin transcription (28Thomas M.C. Chiang C.M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 251-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) is incapable of supporting AP-1-dependent HPV chromatin transcription due to its failure to interact with AP-1 (Fig. 5A). Our data are consistent with the mapping of c-Jun interaction with an N-terminal region of p300 situated outside the HAT domain (47Lee J.S. See R.H. Deng T. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4312-4326Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). It is important to note that the protein properties examined on a single polypeptide may or may not reflect its intrinsic activity in a protein complex. Our mechanistic studies performed with dimeric AP-1 complexes provide the first example for AP-1-regulated transcription in its native form and make it possible to directly compare the transcriptional activity of c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, and Fra-2 in complex with c-Jun. The finding that p300-mediated acetylation of c-Jun, JunB, JunD, c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, and Fra-2 occurs in the dimeric complex (Fig. 5, B–D) is significant, suggesting that acetylation detected previously on c-Jun (48Vries R.G. Prudenziati M. Zwartjes C. Verlaan M. Kalkhoven E. Zantema A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6095-6103Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) is functionally relevant. Indeed, the DNA binding activity of dimeric AP-1 complexes is dramatically enhanced by p300-mediated acetylation, especially when AP-1 is limiting in the reaction (Fig. 5E). Clearly, that p300-mediated acetylation enhances AP-1 binding to DNA and AP-1 facilitates p300 recruitment to HPV chromatin illustrates how a synergistic effect can be generated from productive interaction between a sequence-specific targeting factor and a general HAT enzyme.Our illustration of non-canonical AP-1 sites found in HPV-11 with similar motifs present in essentially every genital HPV in various combinations (Fig. 3) also highlights the importance of AP-1 in HPV transcription and the potential involvement of specific AP-1 members binding to individual sites (Figs. 2B and 7C). It is important to reiterate that the binding activity does not necessarily reflect the transcriptional activity of each dimeric AP-1 complex, as the functional outcome is also determined by the nature of activation domains and interacting proteins involved. Although the accessibility to individual AP-1 sites by distinct Jun/Fos complexes appears unhindered with DNA elements alone (Fig. 2B), differential recognition is evident in vivo when nucleosome assembly poses barriers for transcription factor binding to their cognate sites (Fig. 7C). Undoubtedly, the dynamics of factor recruitments to individual AP-1 sites potentially fluctuates in response to signaling events and the existence of particular Jun and Fos members in a specific cell type (16Zhao W. Chow L.T. Broker T.R. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8832-8840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Bouallaga I. Teissier S. Yaniv M. Thierry F. Mol. Cell.

Virol. 1997; 71: 362-370Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).An interesting observation points to the fact that all functionally important AP-1 sites identified in HPV-11 in different cell types (Fig. 8) have nucleotide A at the sixth position (see Fig. 2A). These sixth A-containing non-canonical AP-1 motifs are dominant in every genital HPV examined without the consensus TRE (Fig. 3), especially at the promoter-proximal #5 site that is also spatially conserved (Fig. 9). It is likely that the promoter-proximal AP-1 site provides a housekeeping function to allow binding by every Jun and Fos family member, whereas the distal AP-1 sites specify regulatory activity and are thus recognized by only selective members of Jun and Fos proteins in a sequence context-dependent manner (Fig. 7C). Redundant factor binding at a sequence motif in the promoter-proximal region dominated in the housekeeping genes has also been observed in genome-wide binding studies of ETS family proteins (9Hollenhorst P.C. Shah A.A. Hopkins C. Graves B.J. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1882-1894Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Clearly, our realization that functional elements are significantly lower than the pure existence of high affinity sequences in the genome for a given transcription factor (53Zhou X. O'Shea E.K. Mol. Cell. 2011; 42: 826-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and that most degenerate low affinity binding sequences detected in vivo are juxtaposed to another transcription factor binding site (9Hollenhorst P.C. Shah A.A. Hopkins C. Graves B.J. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1882-1894Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 54Lupien M. Meyer C.A. Bailey S.T. Eeckhoute J. Cook J. Westerling T. Zhang X. Carroll J.S.

Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 3943-3955Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) indicates that mechanistic studies unraveling the nature of protein-DNA interaction within family members with similar but non-redundant functions are of vital importance. The association of selective family proteins at non-canonical sequence elements, as illustrated here with AP-1 binding to the HPV-11 URR, further ensures that binding flexibility and proper gene response can be readily achieved, and the similar feature is likely extended to AP-1-regulated cellular genes. Indeed, a recent genome-wide binding study performed with c-Jun indicates that non-canonical binding sites are indeed recognized by c-Jun (56Biddie S.C. John S. Sabo P.J. Thurman R.E. Johnson T.A. Schiltz R.L. Miranda T.B. Sung M.H. Trump S. Lightman S.L. Vinson C. Stamatoyannopoulos J.A. Hager G.L. Mol. Cell. 2011; 43: 145-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Clearly, the diversity of AP-1 binding and its regulatory mechanisms are likely conserved between viral and cellular systems even though the virus may sometimes modify the host machinery when co-existence becomes less beneficial.

Mitchell P. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 49: 741-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). TREs are frequently found in the control region of many cellular and viral genes and serve as the binding platform for Jun and Fos family members as well as certain bZIP-containing proteins. In humans, three members in the Jun family (c-Jun, JunB, and JunD) can form homodimers or heterodimers within the same family members or with members in the Fos family, which consists of c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, and Fra-2. Members of the Fos family are not able to form homodimers (2Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3248) Google Scholar). Conceptually, a total of 18 AP-1 dimeric complexes can be generated between Jun and Fos family members, thus creating a regulatory circuit modulating transcription of a diverse set of genes implicated in cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (3Jochum W.

To date it is still unclear which forms of AP-1 complexes are functionally important in HPV transcription and the specific target sites in the HPV URR that serve as the platform for transcription complex assembly.Using an in vitro chromatin transcription system reconstituted with purified HeLa core histones, recombinant nucleosome assembly protein 1 (NAP-1) histone chaperon, and the ATP-utilizing chromatin assembly and remodeling factor (ACF), we have demonstrated that a specific form of AP-1 complex, c-Jun/c-Fos, is able to switch on transcription from an HPV type 11 (HPV-11) URR-containing chromatin template (25Wu S.Y.

With our recent adaptation of a bacterial co-expression system that enables us to purify full-length recombinant human AP-1 dimers (26Wang W.M. Lee A.Y. Chiang C.M. Protein Expr. Purif. 2008; 59: 144-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), we are now able to define the role of each AP-1 complex in HPV chromatin-dependent transcription and reveal novel AP-1 sites that have not yet been characterized because of their deviation from the consensus TRE. All of these non-canonical AP-1 sites are also present in different types of HPVs in various combinations, indicating the existence of an intricate interplay between cis-elements and trans-acting factors in generating the regulatory circuit diversity to modulate HPV transcription in response to constantly changeable cellular environments."
https://openalex.org/W2065093074,"So far the determination of unitary permeability (p(f)) of water channels that are expressed in polarized cells is subject to large errors because the opening of a single water channel does not noticeably increase the water permeability of a membrane patch above the background. That is, in contrast to the patch clamp technique, where the single ion channel conductance may be derived from a single experiment, two experiments separated in time and/or space are required to obtain the single-channel water permeability p(f) as a function of the incremental water permeability (P(f,c)) and the number (n) of water channels that contributed to P(f,c). Although the unitary conductance of ion channels is measured in the native environment of the channel, p(f) is so far derived from reconstituted channels or channels expressed in oocytes. To determine the p(f) of channels from live epithelial monolayers, we exploit the fact that osmotic volume flow alters the concentration of aqueous reporter dyes adjacent to the epithelia. We measure these changes by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, which allows the calculation of both P(f,c) and osmolyte dilution within the unstirred layer. Shifting the focus of the laser from the aqueous solution to the apical and basolateral membranes allowed the FCS-based determination of n. Here we validate the new technique by determining the p(f) of aquaporin 5 in Madin-Darby canine kidney cell monolayers. Because inhibition and subsequent activity rescue are monitored on the same sample, drug effects on exocytosis or endocytosis can be dissected from those on p(f)."

https://openalex.org/W1965817477,"Nicotine-induced up-regulation of neuronal nicotinic receptors (nAChRs) has been known and studied for more than 25 years. Other nAChR ligands can also up-regulate nAChRs, but it is not known if these ligands induce up-regulation by mechanisms similar to that of nicotine. In this study, we compared up-regulation by three different nicotinic agonists and a competitive antagonist of several different nAChR subtypes expressed in HEK293 cells. Nicotine markedly increased α4β2 nAChR binding site density and β2 subunit protein. Carbachol, a known nAChR and muscarinic receptor agonist, up-regulated both α4β2 nAChR binding sites and subunit protein 2-fold more than did nicotine. This increased up-regulation was shown pharmacologically to involve endogenously expressed muscarinic receptors, and stimulation of these muscarinic receptors also correlated with a 2-fold increase in α4 and β2 mRNA. Muscarinic receptor activation in these cells appears to affect CMV promoter activity only minimally (∼1.2 fold), suggesting that the increase in α4 and β2 nAChR mRNA may not be dependent on enhanced transcription. Instead, other mechanisms may contribute to the increase in mRNA and a consequent increase in receptor subunits and binding site density. These studies demonstrate the possibility of augmenting nAChR expression in a cell model through mechanisms and targets other than the nAChR receptor itself.

Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) 2The abbreviations used are: nAChRneuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptorDHβEdihydro-β-erythroidineEBepibatidineQNBquinuclidinyl benzilateNSBnonspecific bindingqPCRquantitative real-time PCR. are ligand-gated ion channels composed of α (α2-α10) and β (β2-β4) subunits. These subunits assemble as pentamers to make either homomeric receptors (e.g. α7 nAChRs) or heteromeric receptors (e.g. α4β2 nAChRs) in the CNS, peripheral ganglia, and adrenal gland. Activation of nAChRs by acetylcholine changes the conformation of the receptor to allow passive ion flow through the receptor channel. This ion flow, if sufficient, depolarizes neurons, which in turn contributes to CNS functions, such as cognition, affect, and reward, and activates important responses in the autonomic and sensory nervous systems. The predominant nAChRs in the mammalian brain contain α4 and β2 subunits (1Flores C.M. Rogers S.W. Pabreza L.A. Wolfe B.B. Kellar K.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 31-37PubMed Google Scholar, 2Zoli M.

In addition to their roles in normal physiology and in nicotine addiction, nAChRs are consistently found to be decreased in brains from Alzheimer disease patients (18Shimohama S. Taniguchi T.

The exact mechanisms that lead to nicotine-induced nAChR up-regulation are still unclear, but the initial signal appears to originate at the agonist binding site (24Schwartz R.D. Kellar K.J. J. Neurochem. 1985; 45: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The up-regulation is not accompanied by an increase in steady-state levels of subunit mRNA, indicating that the increase in receptors is independent of transcription or mRNA stabilization (25Marks M.J.

Studies in cells that heterologously express nAChRs suggest that nicotine acts as a “pharmacological chaperone,” enhancing the incorporation of β2 subunits into assembling receptors (29Kuryatov A. Luo J. Cooper J. Lindstrom J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 1839-1851Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 30Sallette J. Pons S. Devillers-Thiery A. Soudant M. Prado de Carvalho L. Changeux J.P. Corringer P.J. Neuron. 2005; 46: 595-607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and thereby increasing the number of α4β2 nAChRs and possibly changing the stoichiometry from (α4)3(β2)2 to (α4)2(β2)3 (31Nelson M.E. Kuryatov A. Choi C.H. Zhou Y. Lindstrom J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 332-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 32Zhou Y. Nelson M.E. Kuryatov A. Choi C. Cooper J. Lindstrom J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 9004-9015Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of nicotine to chaperone β2 subunits into the nAChR assembly appears to be due, in part, to an action of nicotine binding at a microdomain located on the extracellular portion of the β2 subunit (33Sallette J. Bohler S. Benoit P. Soudant M. Pons S. Le Novère N. Changeux J.P. Corringer P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18767-18775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Moreover, nicotine has also been found to promote nAChR subunit assembly by activating protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation of immature α4 subunits (34Wecker L. Pollock V.V. Pacheco M.A. Pastoor T. Neuroscience. 2010; 171: 12-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In addition to its action to promote subunit assembly, there is strong evidence that, in cell models heterologously expressing nAChRs, nicotine also induces up-regulation by decreasing the degradation rate of the receptor (26Peng X. Gerzanich V. Anand R. Whiting P.J. Lindstrom J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 523-530PubMed Google Scholar, 29Kuryatov A. Luo J. Cooper J. Lindstrom J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 1839-1851Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Although both increased receptor assembly and decreased receptor degradation are well supported theories regarding the mechanism for nAChR up-regulation, neither has been confirmed in neurons or in vivo. Nicotine is not the only nicotinic ligand that up-regulates nAChRs. Cytisine, a plant-derived partial agonist at α4β2 nAChRs, up-regulates these receptors after chronic administration in vivo in the rat brain (24Schwartz R.D. Kellar K.J. J. Neurochem. 1985; 45: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), as do the algae-derived full agonist (+)-anatoxin (13Rowell P.P. Wonnacott S. J.

Res. 2011; 13: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Moreover, other nAChR ligands, such as the agonists epibatidine and methylcarbamylcholine (36Whiteaker P. Sharples C.G. Wonnacott S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 950-962PubMed Google Scholar), carbachol (37Avila A.M. Dávila-García M.I. Ascarrunz V.S. Xiao Y. Kellar K.J. Mol.

However, the mechanism(s) of nAChR up-regulation by carbachol and other agonists or antagonists has not been examined. Interestingly, a recent study demonstrated that tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) can also up-regulate α4β2 nAChRs heterologously expressed in cells. Furthermore, the up-regulation by TNF-α effect was synergistic with nicotine (38Gahring L.C. Osborne-Hereford A.V. Vasquez-Opazo G.A. Rogers S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 693-699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and appeared to involve p38 MAPK (38Gahring L.C. Osborne-Hereford A.V. Vasquez-Opazo G.A. Rogers S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 693-699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In that study, the authors also noted that these receptors are possibly up-regulated more by carbachol than by nicotine (38Gahring L.C. Osborne-Hereford A.V. Vasquez-Opazo G.A. Rogers S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 693-699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To investigate this further, we examined differences in α4β2 nAChR up-regulation induced by nicotine, carbachol, choline, and DHβE. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal bovine serum, and antibiotics were purchased from Invitrogen. (±)-[3H]epibatidine ([3H]EB), [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]QNB), and α-[125I]bungarotoxin were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Polyclonal antibodies sc-1772 (α4) and sc-1449 (β2) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). DHβE was obtained from NIDA, National Institutes of Health. Nicotine hydrogen tartrate, carbamylcholine chloride (carbachol), choline chloride, oxotremorine sesquifumarate, atropine sulfate, and QNB were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. HEK293 cells were maintained and grown as described previously (39Xiao Y. Kellar K.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2004; 310: 98-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 42Xiao Y. Meyer E.L.

Cell culturing medium contained Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.7 mg/ml Geneticin (G418). Cells were grown in 75-cm2 Falcon T-flasks (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) and kept at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. After cells reached ∼90% confluence, drug treatments were performed by replacing old culturing medium with new medium containing the desired concentration of drug(s). Treated cells were again kept at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator for the desired treatment time. Following drug treatment, cells were harvested to make membrane homogenates as described previously (39Xiao Y. Kellar K.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2004; 310: 98-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The cell medium was first replaced with 25 ml of 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4 at 4 °C), the cells were then gently scraped off the flasks and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to wash and collect whole cells. The resulting cell pellet was resuspended in 25 ml of buffer and homogenized using a Polytron homogenizer or by sonication. The cell suspension was centrifuged again at 32,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Pellet resuspension, homogenization, and high speed centrifugation were repeated twice before resuspending the final pellet in Tris buffer. Membrane homogenates were then aliquoted into incubation tubes (∼25–100 μg of protein/tube, depending on the subtype of receptor being measured) and incubated with [3H]EB for 2–4 h at room temperature to determine total binding. Nonspecific binding (NSB) was determined by the inclusion of 300 μm nicotine. Bound radioligand was separated from free radioligand by vacuum filtration over Whatman GF/C filters presoaked in 0.5% polyethyleneimine. Filters were then measured for radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. Binding to α7 nAChR was measured with 0.5 nm α-[125I]bungarotoxin in the presence of 0.5% bovine serum albumin to decrease NSB to the filters. NSB was measured in the presence of 1.5 mm nicotine. The total density of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors was measured with 0.5 nm [3H]QNB, and NSB was determined in the presence of 50 μm atropine. NSB was subtracted from the total radioligand bound to determine specific binding. Values were normalized to the total protein as determined by a BCA protein assay. Crude homogenized membranes from untreated and treated cells were aliquoted in loading buffer containing 50 mm dithiothreitol and 2% SDS. Samples were boiled for 5 min, and 10 μg of total protein was loaded and separated by SDS-PAGE. The concentration of protein in each sample was determined before loading by a BCA protein assay. Following SDS-PAGE, protein was transferred from the gels onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. The PVDF membranes were then blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in TBST buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 147 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.6) for 30 min at room temperature, followed by 1 wash in TBST. Primary polyclonal antibodies directed at the α4 subunit (sc-1772) and the β2 subunit (sc-1449) were diluted to 1 μg/ml in TBST containing 1% BSA and 0.01% sodium azide and incubated with PVDF membranes overnight at 4 °C while gently rocking. After incubation, membranes were washed with TBST buffer four times and incubated with anti-goat IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase in TBST with 1% BSA for 30 min at room temperature. Membranes were again washed with TBST four times before adding SuperSignal West Pico chemoluminescent substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The probed membranes were then visualized on autoradiography film. Following visualization, membranes were washed with TBST buffer four or five times over 2 h while gently shaking at room temperature. India ink, diluted 1:1,000, was then introduced to the blots for 15–60 min while gently rocking at room temperature, similarly to previous studies (44Hancock K. Tsang V.C. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 133: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 45Lek L.H. Yang E.B. Wang D.F. Cheng L.Y. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1995; 30: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Blots sufficiently stained with India ink were air-dried. Autoradiography film and ink-stained membranes were recorded using a computer scanner. Cropping and sizing of images was performed with Corel Photo-Paint 11 software (Corel Corp., Ottawa, Canada). Quantification of band densities and India ink staining was measured using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Band densities were normalized to the total protein density in each lane, as indicated by the India ink staining. Standard curves of α4 and β2 blots were carried out to ensure that band densities were within the linear range of the film. HEK cells stably expressing rat α4β2 nAChRs were plated on poly-d-lysine-treated NunclonTM Delta Surface 6-well dishes (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and grown to 90% confluence before treating with nicotine, carbachol, and atropine. After an appropriate treatment time, medium was aspirated, cells were lysed with 1 ml of TRIzol (Invitrogen), and total RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer's protocol. Isolated RNA was then transferred to a spin cartridge from a PureLinkTM RNA minikit (Invitrogen), and RNA was purified according to the manufacturer's protocol. Reverse transcription was used to create cDNA from 1 μg of purified RNA using an RT2 EZ first strand cDNA kit (SABiosciences, Frederick, MD) as described in the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Following reverse transcription, 1 μl of cDNA was used for quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). To quantify α4 mRNA, 300 nm sense primer (CAGCAAGCCCACCAGCTCCC) and 300 nm antisense primer (GCCTCCCGCCTTGAGCACAG) were used. Quantification of β2 mRNA was performed with 300 nm sense primer (GCCGACGCAACGAGAACCCA) and 300 nm antisense primer (CGAGGGAGGTGGGAGGCACA). All relative changes in α4 and β2 mRNA expression were normalized to GAPDH mRNA expression, which was determined using 600 nm sense primer (GAGTCAACGGATTTGGTCGT) and 600 nm antisense primer (GATCTCGCTCCTGGAAGATG). RT2 SYBR® Green (SABiosciences) was added to visualize amplification of cDNA with a CFX96 real-time system (Bio-Rad) using the following cycling protocol: 1 cycle of 95 °C for 10 min followed by 30 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 64 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s. Following 30 cycles, a melting curve was produced to ensure that a single product was amplified. In addition, samples were run on a 1.2% agarose electrophoresis gel after qPCR to ensure a single product was amplified with the expected base pair sizes. Efficiency values of each primer pair were determined as described previously (46Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (24586) Google Scholar). These values were then considered during analysis of quantitative data using the Pfaffl equation (46Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (24586) Google Scholar) to determine relative changes in mRNA expression. HEK cells stably expressing α4β2 nAChRs were plated on NunclonTM Delta 60-mm dishes (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and grown to 90% confluence. Cells were then transiently transfected using LipofectamineTM 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) and 4 μg of pEGFPLuc plasmid that contains a CMV promoter (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). Transfected cells were incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2 for 6 h following transfection. Cells were then split into poly-d-lysine-treated Nunc MicroWell 96-well optical bottom plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and incubated overnight at 37 °C under 5% CO2. The following morning, cells were treated with nicotine, carbachol, and atropine for 6 or 24 h. A Steady-Glo® luciferase assay system (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) was used to lyse cells and introduce luciferase substrate following the manufacturer's protocol. Relative luminescence was measured with an EnVision 2104 multilabel reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). All data were analyzed and graphed using GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). Most up-regulation data were graphed as -fold increase compared with untreated tissue, which provides easy comparison of up-regulation between different nAChR subtypes as well as comparison across figures that measure up-regulation of radioligand binding, subunit protein, and mRNA. Statistical analysis was performed with a one-way analysis of variance, post hoc Tukey's test. In addition to nicotine, several other nicotinic ligands up-regulate nAChRs; however, it is not known if they all up-regulate the receptors to the same extent or by the same mechanisms. To compare ligand-induced up-regulation, we examined the concentration dependence of nicotine, carbachol, choline, and DHβE to up-regulate α4β2 nAChRs stably expressed in HEK293 cells. Cells were treated with a range of drug concentrations for 24 h before measuring [3H]EB binding in membrane homogenates. The concentration-effect curves for up-regulation are shown in Fig. 1. Of the drugs tested, nicotine was the most potent to up-regulate α4β2 nAChRs; DHβE was the next most potent, followed by carbachol and choline. The maximum up-regulation (Emax) of α4β2 nAChRs induced by choline was similar to that induced by nicotine. The fitted Emax of DHβE-induced up-regulation appeared to be less than nicotine, but this difference did not reach statistical significance. Most interesting, however, was that the maximum up-regulation induced by carbachol was ∼2-fold more than by nicotine (p < 0.001). The observation that carbachol induces a greater up-regulation than nicotine indicates that carbachol might up-regulate receptors through different and/or multiple mechanisms compared with nicotine. We also tested nicotine-, carbachol-, and choline-induced up-regulation of several other nAChR subtypes, α3β4, α7, α4β4, α6β2, and α3β2 nAChRs stably expressed in HEK293 cells (39Xiao Y. Kellar K.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2004; 310: 98-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 43Xiao Y. Abdrakhmanova G.R. Baydyuk M. Hernandez S. Kellar K.J. Acta Pharmacol. Sin. 2009; 30: 842-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Concentrations of nicotine, carbachol, and choline that resulted in nearly maximal or maximal up-regulation of α4β2 receptors after 24 h (Fig. 1) were used to treat these other nAChR subtypes. These high concentrations of the three agonist ligands used here allowed the Emax for up-regulation of each receptor subtype to be estimated. The relative increase (-fold increase) in binding sites after incubation with the three agonists compared with untreated cells for each nAChR subtype is shown in Table 1. The α3β4 nAChR subtype appeared to be modestly up-regulated by a 24-h exposure to nicotine, carbachol, and choline, but the maximum increase observed was ∼60% or less. The α7 receptor subtype also demonstrated a modest up-regulation, which was statistically significant only with 100 μm nicotine and 1 mm carbachol treatments. The α4β4 nAChR was modestly up-regulated by nicotine and carbachol but not by choline. The largest increases in nicotine-and carbachol-induced up-regulation were found in the α6β2 and α3β2 nAChRs, with maximal increases of more than 20- and 45-fold, respectively. The large increases in these two nAChR subtypes probably reflect their low density in the untreated control cells. Choline also increased these receptors but to an extent similar to or less than that seen in the α4β2 receptors. Interestingly, the carbachol-induced increase was statistically greater than the nicotine-induced increase only in the α4β2, α4β4, and α3β2 receptor subtypes.TABLE 1Fold increase of nAChRs compared with untreated cellsSubtypeUntreatedNicotineCarbacholCholine1 μm100 μm1 mm10 mm1 mm10 mmfold increasefold increasefold increaseα4β21.0 ± 0.036.0 ± 0.7ap < 0.001, significance of -fold increase from the untreated group.6.8 ± 0.3ap < 0.001, significance of -fold increase from the untreated group.10.9 ± 0.6ap < 0.001, significance of -fold increase from the untreated group.13.2 ± 1.4ap < 0.001, significance of -fold increase from the untreated group.,bp < 0.001, significance of up-regulation induced by 10 mm carbachol and 10 mm choline compared with 100 μm nicotine.4.0 ± 0.5ap < 0.001, significance of -fold increase from the untreated group.7.2 ± 0.9ap < 0.001, significance of -fold increase from the untreated group.α3β41.0 ± 0.051.3 ± 0.11.5 ± 0.21.6 ± 0.3cp < 0.01, significance of -fold increase from the untreated group.1.6 ± 0.2dp < 0.05, significance of -fold increase from the untreated group.1.1 ± 0.021.4 ± 0.2α71.0 ± 0.072.0 ± 0.32.8 ± 0.3cp < 0.01, significance of -fold increase from the untreated group.2.7 ± 0.4cp < 0.01, significance of -fold increase from the untreated group.2.1 ± 0.31.8 ± 0.21.8 ± 0.5α4β41.0 ± 0.021.5 ± 0.1dp < 0.05, significance of -fold increase from the untreated group.2.3 ± 0.1ap < 0.001, significance of -fold increase from the untreated group.2.5 ± 0.2ap < 0.001, significance of -fold increase from the untreated group.3.8 ± 0.3ap < 0.001, significance of -fold increase from the untreated group.,bp < 0.001, significance of up-regulation induced by 10 mm carbachol and 10 mm choline compared with 100 μm nicotine.1.2 ± 0.11.4 ± 0.2ep < 0.01, significance of up-regulation induced by 10 mm carbachol and choline compared with 100 μm nicotine.α6β21.0 ± 0.062.8 ± 0.619.7 ± 2ap < 0.001, significance of -fold increase from the untreated group.11.8 ± 2ap < 0.001, significance of -fold increase from the untreated group.26.0 ± 3ap < 0.001, significance of -fold increase from the untreated group.2.2 ± 0.33.2 ± 0.3bp < 0.001, significance of up-regulation induced by 10 mm carbachol and 10 mm choline compared with 100 μm ni"
https://openalex.org/W1990792023,"NUP98-HOXA9 is the prototype of NUP98 fusion oncoproteins that cause acute myeloid leukemia. It consists of an N-terminal FG-rich portion of the nucleoporin NUP98 fused to the homeodomain region of the homeobox protein HOXA9, and acts as an aberrant transcription factor. To identify interacting partners of NUP98-HOXA9, we used a cytoplasmic yeast two-hybrid assay to avoid the nonspecific trans-activation that would occur with the traditional yeast two-hybrid assay due to the transactivating properties of NUP98-HOXA9. We identified amino-terminal enhancer of split (AES), a transcriptional regulator of the transducin-like enhancer/Groucho family as a novel interaction partner of NUP98-HOXA9. The interaction was confirmed by in vitro pulldown and co-immunoprecipitation assays and was shown to require the FG repeat region of NUP98-HOXA9. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that AES localizes primarily to the interior of the nucleus. AES also showed a strong interaction with wild-type NUP98. AES augmented the transcriptional activity of NUP98-HOXA9. In the presence of NUP98-HOXA9, AES caused an increase in long-term proliferation of primary human CD34+ cells with a marked increase in the numbers of primitive cells. These effects of AES were not observed in the absence of NUP98-HOXA9. AES knockdown diminished the transcriptional and proliferative effects of NUP98-HOXA9. AES caused a shift away from the erythroid lineage in cells expressing NUP98-HOXA9. These data establish AES as an interacting partner of NUP98-HOXA9 and show that it cooperates with NUP98-HOXA9 in transcriptional regulation and cell transformation.

In this study we sought to identify NUP98-HOXA9-interacting proteins and determine their effects on the function of NUP98-HOXA9. Traditional yeast two-hybrid assays that rely on intranuclear transcriptional activation are likely to deliver a high number of false positives due to the transactivating properties of the FG repeat region of NUP98-HOXA9 (24Kasper L.H.

The transcriptional regulator amino-terminal enhancer of split (AES) was identified as a novel interaction partner of NUP98-HOXA9 by this method. This interaction was found to enhance the ability of NUP98-HOXA9 to transform primary human hematopoietic cells. Total RNA was isolated from 32 × 106 K562 cells using the RNAaqueous kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (350 μg) was obtained and poly(A) RNA was purified using the Poly(A) Purist kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A total of 5 μg of poly(A) RNA was recovered and a cDNA library was synthesized and cloned into pMyr XR vector using the Cytotrap XR library construction kit (Stratagene). The control plasmids for the two-hybrid assay were provided with the kit. The bait plasmid pSOS-HA-NUP98-HOXA9 was constructed by subcloning HA-tagged NUP98-HOXA9 in-frame from pcDNA3-HA-NUP98-HOXA9 (25Ghannam G. Takeda A. Camarata T. Moore M.A. Viale A. Yaseen N.R. J.

Cytotrap yeast two-hybrid analysis was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the K562 cDNA library in pMyr vector and pSOS-HA-NUP98-HOXA9 were co-transformed into cdc25H yeast strain, plated into selective medium containing glucose as the carbon source, and incubated at room temperature until the colonies appeared. Colonies were replicated into selective medium containing galactose as the carbon source and incubated at 37 °C until the colonies appeared. Temperature-resistant colonies were isolated, patched into fresh selective plates, grown, and replica plated again to confirm the positive growth and eliminate false positives. The patches were grown in liquid medium to isolate pMyr plasmid DNA containing the positive clones. The isolated plasmids were amplified in Escherichia coli and purified DNA was sequenced using primers on both sides of the cDNA insert regions. The cDNA inserts were identified using the National Center for Biotechnology Information BLAST application. The recombinant proteins glutathione S-transferase (GST), as well as GST-tagged HA-NUP98-HOXA9, HOXA9, and AES were produced from the pGEX-6P1 vector in E. coli BL21(DE3) bacteria and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare). Recombinant AES was released by digestion with Pre-Scission protease (GE Healthcare). NUP98, NUP98-HOXA9 and its variants, NUP62 full-length and deletions, and NUP153 full-length and deletions were produced using the TnT T7 quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) in the presence of Tran35S-label (MP Biomedicals). Binding assays were carried out essentially as described previously (31Zhong H. Takeda A. Nazari R. Shio H. Blobel G. Yaseen N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10675-10682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For a binding reaction, 10 μl of beads from the immobilized recombinant protein (GST control or GST-AES) were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 34-μl mixtures consisting of in vitro translated protein, transport buffer-Tween 20 (TB-T, which consists of 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 110 mm potassium acetate, and 2 mm MgCl2 with 0.1% Tween 20), and 0.5 mg/ml of Pefabloc (Roche Applied Science). The unbound fraction was removed and the beads were washed three times in cold TB-T. One-fourth of the unbound and all of the bound fractions were visualized by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. For the AES binding assays, purified recombinant AES was incubated with immobilized GST, GST-NUP98-HOXA9, or GST-HOXA9 proteins in 34-μl mixtures in TB-T and processed as described above. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and AES was detected with anti-AES antibody. Recombinant AES protein was submitted to Harlan Laboratories where rabbit immunizations and bleedings were done according to their standard procedures. Bleeds with the highest concentration of antibody as detected by immunoblotting were selected for antibody purification. At each step, serum and purified antibody fractions were tested by immunoblotting of a K562 lysate (supplemental Fig. S2). Antiserum (supplemental Fig. S2, lane 1) was first precleared using 1 ml of Affi-Gel 15 beads (Bio-Rad) loaded with lysate containing 30 mg of protein from E. coli BL21 bacteria expressing empty pGEX6P1 vector for 4 h at 4 °C (supplemental Fig. S2, lane 2). The pre-cleared serum was added to a column containing 1 ml of Affi-Gel 15 beads loaded with 1 mg of AES protein and incubated overnight with rotation at 4 °C. The flow-through fraction was depleted of AES antibody as shown under supplemental Fig. S2, lane 3. The column was washed 6 times with 10 ml of cold DPBS at 4 °C. Bound antibody was eluted once with 4 ml of 1 m NaCl in DPBS, once with 4 ml of 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5, and once with 4 ml of 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5, 1 m NaCl, 1% CHAPS. For each elution, 0.5-ml fractions were collected, and glycine-containing fractions were neutralized with 25 μl of 1 m Tris base. Antibody concentration in the various fractions was determined by Amido Black staining and immunoblotting of purified recombinant AES or K562 lysate (supplemental Fig. S2, lanes 4–12). More than 90% of the antibody was detected in fractions 6 and 7 of the 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5, elution (supplemental Fig. S2, lanes 9 and 10); these fractions were stored at −80 °C. To test the specificity of the anti-AES antibody, K562 cells were nucleofected with empty vector or vector containing HA-tagged AES. Lysates were prepared as described below and AES was immunoprecipitated with the anti-AES antibody. The immunoprecipitated complexes were subjected to SDS-PAGE and probed for HA-tagged AES with anti-HA antibody (12CA5) (supplemental Fig. S3A). To further test the anti-AES antibody K562 cells were nucleofected with empty pRFP-C-RS vector, vector containing nonspecific shRNA, or vectors containing shRNA against AES (Origene) (see supplemental Table S3 for sequences). Lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and AES was detected with the anti-AES antibody. (supplemental Fig. S3B). To test the specificity of the antibody in immunofluorescence, cytospin smears were prepared from the transfected cells and AES was detected by immunofluorescence with the anti-AES antibody (supplemental Fig. S3C). To quantitate the specific knockdown of AES, the average fluorescence intensity of 35 cells for each condition was measured using Metamorph version 6.3r2 software (supplemental Fig. S3D). For localization of AES, 25,000 K562 cells were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution and centrifuged onto slides by cytospin centrifugation, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in DPBS for 20 min, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 20 min at room temperature. For blocking and washing, 2% normal goat serum in DPBS with 1% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20 was used. Primary antibodies were rabbit anti-AES along with mouse mAb 414 (Abcam). The fluorescent secondary antibodies were FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG from goat (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse IgG from goat (Millipore Corp.). The images were captured using an Eclipse 80i fluorescent microscope (Nikon) and processed using Metamorph version 6.3r2 software (Molecular Devices). For NUP98-HOXA9 immunoprecipitation with AES, 107 K562 cells were nucleofected with pcDNA3-HA-NUP98-HOXA9 using a Nucleofector device (Lonza). The co-immunoprecipitations of NUP62, NUP153, and NUP98 with AES were done in untransfected K562 cells. Cells were harvested 16 h postnucleofection, washed with cold DPBS, and lysed for 30 min on ice with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.4 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.4% Triton X-100, 0.2% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm PMSF). Dilution buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors, 1 mm PMSF) (0.5 ml) was added, followed by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatants were transferred to new tubes and the appropriate antibodies were added. For AES immunoprecipitation either rabbit IgG or rabbit anti-AES antibody was added. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, 30 μl of Protein G beads were added to lysates with control rabbit IgG or anti-AES antibodies and incubated for another 1 h. Beads were washed with 700 μl of wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 1× protease inhibitors, 1 mm PMSF) five times, 3 min each time followed by centrifugation at 1,800 × g for 3 min at 4 °C. Beads were washed with cold DPBS and bound proteins were eluted by boiling with 30 μl of 2× SDS buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 3.5% SDS, 10% glycerol, 2 mm DTT, 0.004% bromphenol blue) for 10 min. Proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE (7.5% gel) followed by immunoblotting. NUP98-HOXA9 was detected with an anti-HA antibody, NUP98 with anti-NUP98 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology), and NUP62 or NUP153 with mouse MAb414 antibody. The input amounts were determined by immunoblotting the cell lysates with the appropriate antibodies. To confirm coimmunoprecipitation of AES with HA-NUP98-HOXA9, 107 K562 cells were nucleofected with pcDNA3 or pcDNA3-HA-NUP98-HOXA9. Cell lysates were incubated with anti-HA antibody and AES in the immunoprecipitated complex was detected with the anti-AES antibody. K562 cells were transfected by electroporation using a Bio-Rad GenePulser with 5 μg of pGL4.11 vector or pGL4.11 driven by the KBTBD10 promoter in combination with 10 μg of either empty pcDNA3, or pcDNA3 expressing HA-NUP98-HOXA9, without or with pcDNA3 vector expressing FLAG-AES. To control for efficiency of transfection, 0.5 μg of pRL-TK (Promega), which expresses Renilla luciferase was included. Five million cells were incubated with the DNA at room temperature for 10 min before electroporation and 10 min after electroporation, and cultured in 10 ml of Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM) with 10% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml of penicillin/streptomycin. Luciferase activity was measured 48 h after electroporation using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) and the results were normalized to Renilla luciferase. For the AES knockdown experiment, K562 cells were nucleofected with 5 μg of pGL4.11 vector driven by the KBTBD10 promoter in combination with 10 μg of either empty pcDNA3, or pcDNA3 expressing HA-NUP98-HOXA9. In addition, either empty pRFP-C-RS vector, vector containing nonspecific shRNA, or vectors containing shRNA against AES (Origene) (see supplemental Table S3 for sequences) were included. Expression of HA-NUP98-HOXA9 and knockdown of AES was verified by immunoblotting with anti-HA or anti-AES antibody, respectively. The GP293 packaging cell line was transiently transfected with 4.4 μg of control MSCV-IRES-GFP retroviral vector, control MSCV-IRES-YFP vector, or vector expressing FLAG-tagged AES along with 1.1 μg of the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein plasmid (Clontech) using Lipofectamine and Plus reagents (Invitrogen). After 48 h, the culture supernatant containing vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein-pseudotyped retrovirus was collected and used for transduction of PG13 packaging cells (American Type Culture Collection) by spinoculation in the presence of 8 μg/ml of Polybrene (hexadimethrine bromide; Sigma) to produce GaLV-pseudotyped retrovirus. PG13 cells producing GaLV-pseudotyped MSCV-IRES-GFP/HA-NUP98-HOXA9 retrovirus were previously described (21Takeda A. Goolsby C. Yaseen N.R. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 6628-6637Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The PG13 culture supernatants containing GaLV-pseudotyped retrovirus were used for transduction of K562 cells and human primary CD34+ cells by co-culturing for 48 h as described previously (21Takeda A. Goolsby C. Yaseen N.R. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 6628-6637Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). For knockdown of AES in CD34+ cells, GIPZ lentiviral shRNAmir particles were purchased from Open Biosystems. Frozen human CD34+ cells from mobilized peripheral blood of healthy volunteers (purchased from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center) were prestimulated and transduced with retrovirus as described (21Takeda A. Goolsby C. Yaseen N.R. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 6628-6637Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). After 48 h, GFP/YFP double positive cells were isolated using a MoFlo high-speed sorter (Dako) and expression of the transfected gene was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-HA tag antibody for NUP98-HOXA9 and anti-AES antibody for AES. For long-term liquid culture, sorted cells were seeded at 105 cells/ml of IMDM containing 20% FBS, 100 ng/ml of Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt 3)-ligand, 20 ng/ml of granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), 100 ng/ml of stem cell factor, 100 ng/ml of thrombopoietin, 50 ng/ml of IL-3, 100 ng/ml of IL-6 (all cytokines were from Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ), 2 mm l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml of penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were periodically counted and resuspended in fresh media at 105 cells/ml. Cytospin preparations of cells harvested from the liquid cultures at weeks 4, 5, and 6 were stained with Giemsa and 500 cell differential counts were performed using an Olympus BX51 microscope (Olympus America). Cells with blast and promyelocyte morphology were counted as primitive; those with myelocyte/metamyelocyte morphology as intermediate myeloid; those with band, segmented neutrophil, monocyte, and macrophage morphology as mature myeloid. Photomicrographs were taken with an Olympus DP71 camera with a ×20 and ×60 oil objective. For colony-forming cell (CFC) assays, sorted cells were resuspended in IMDM containing 2% FBS and mixed with Methocult GF+ (H4435, StemCell Technologies) that consists of 1% methylcellulose, 30% FBS, 1% bovine serum albumin, 10−4 m 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 ng/ml of stem cell factor, 20 ng/ml of GM-CSF, 20 ng/ml of IL-3, 20 ng/ml of IL-6, 20 ng/ml of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and 3 units/ml of erythropoietin in IMDM. One thousand cells were plated in each 35-mm dish and cultured for 14 days. Colonies were counted at ×40 magnification and classified into 3 categories: erythroid, myeloid, and mixed/branched. For AES knockdown using lentivirus, prestimulated CD34+ cells were transduced with MSCV-IRES-YFP retrovirus expressing HA-NUP98-HOXA9. After 48 h, YFP positive cells were isolated and grown in culture medium for 2 weeks. Cells were then transduced by spinoculation with GIPZ Lentiviral shRNAmir particles that express nonspecific shRNA or AES shRNA and a GFP marker (see supplemental Table S3 for shRNA sequences). After 48 h, GFP/YFP positive cells were isolated by sorting. One week later, knockdown of AES was confirmed by quantitative PCR and semi-quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 10, B and C) using primers specific for AES (expression was normalized to GAPDH). One week later an MTS cell proliferation assay was done using CellTiter 96® AQueous NonRadioactive Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega G5421) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty-five thousand cells were seeded into a 96-well plate in triplicate and grown for 72 h in 100 μl of culture medium. Twenty μl of MTS/phenazine methosulfate solution was added and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The absorbance at 490 nm was measured using an ELISA plate reader. Flow cytometry was performed on a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) upgraded to 5 colors and two lasers, and analyzed using FlowJO version 8.6.3 software (Tree Star). The antibodies used for these studies were anti-CD235a (allophycocyanin-conjugated clone GA-R2) (BD Biosciences) and anti-CD45 (phycoerythrin-Cy7-conjugated clone J.33) (Beckman Coulter). To identify possible interaction partners of the oncoprotein NUP98-HOXA9, we used a Cytotrap yeast two-hybrid assay in which the interaction between target and the bait proteins occurs in the cytoplasm. The traditional two-hybrid assay relies on intranuclear interactions that result in transactivation and is therefore likely to show many false positives when the bait contains a transactivation domain as is the case with NUP98-HOXA9 (24Kasper L.H. Brindle P.K. Schnabel C.A. Pritchard C.E. Cleary M.L. van Deursen J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 764-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). In the Cytotrap yeast two-hybrid assay, the bait protein was fused to hSOS and the target library was subcloned downstream of a myristylation signal that targets the proteins to the plasma membrane. A physical interaction between the bait protein and one of the targets recruits the hSOS protein to the plasma membrane. This activates the Ras signaling pathway allowing the cdc25H strain to grow and form colonies at 37 °C in galactose containing medium. NUP98-HOXA9 was fused to hSOS as a bait protein and the target library was obtained from human K562 cells. Expression of hSOS-NUP98-HOXA9 in the cdc25H yeast strain was confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 1A). Controls for the assay were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (supplemental Fig. S1). The bait protein and the target library were co-transformed into the cdc25H heat-sensitive yeast strain. Several hundred colonies appeared and were replica-plated onto galactose-containing medium to induce expression of the target library. Colonies were isolated and selection in stringent temperature and media was repeated for isolation of true positive clones. Inserts were sequenced and several of the positive clones encoded full-length AES. To confirm the interaction between NUP98-HOXA9 and AES, the plasmid encoding AES along with either pSOS vector or vector expressing hSOS-NUP98-HOXA9 was reintroduced into the cdc25H yeast strain. Colonies were spotted into selective medium and subjected to the restrictive temperature. Cells"
