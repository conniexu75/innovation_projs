https://openalex.org/W2127230663,"A 2.91-billion base pair (bp) consensus sequence of the euchromatic portion of the human genome was generated by the whole-genome shotgun sequencing method. The 14.8-billion bp DNA sequence was generated over 9 months from 27,271,853 high-quality sequence reads (5.11-fold coverage of the genome) from both ends of plasmid clones made from the DNA of five individuals. Two assembly strategies-a whole-genome assembly and a regional chromosome assembly-were used, each combining sequence data from Celera and the publicly funded genome effort. The public data were shredded into 550-bp segments to create a 2.9-fold coverage of those genome regions that had been sequenced, without including biases inherent in the cloning and assembly procedure used by the publicly funded group. This brought the effective coverage in the assemblies to eightfold, reducing the number and size of gaps in the final assembly over what would be obtained with 5.11-fold coverage. The two assembly strategies yielded very similar results that largely agree with independent mapping data. The assemblies effectively cover the euchromatic regions of the human chromosomes. More than 90% of the genome is in scaffold assemblies of 100,000 bp or more, and 25% of the genome is in scaffolds of 10 million bp or larger. Analysis of the genome sequence revealed 26,588 protein-encoding transcripts for which there was strong corroborating evidence and an additional approximately 12,000 computationally derived genes with mouse matches or other weak supporting evidence. Although gene-dense clusters are obvious, almost half the genes are dispersed in low G+C sequence separated by large tracts of apparently noncoding sequence. Only 1.1% of the genome is spanned by exons, whereas 24% is in introns, with 75% of the genome being intergenic DNA. Duplications of segmental blocks, ranging in size up to chromosomal lengths, are abundant throughout the genome and reveal a complex evolutionary history. Comparative genomic analysis indicates vertebrate expansions of genes associated with neuronal function, with tissue-specific developmental regulation, and with the hemostasis and immune systems. DNA sequence comparisons between the consensus sequence and publicly funded genome data provided locations of 2.1 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A random pair of human haploid genomes differed at a rate of 1 bp per 1250 on average, but there was marked heterogeneity in the level of polymorphism across the genome. Less than 1% of all SNPs resulted in variation in proteins, but the task of determining which SNPs have functional consequences remains an open challenge."

https://openalex.org/W2012071848,"Cellular DNA is subjected to continual attack, both by reactive species inside cells and by environmental agents. Toxic and mutagenic consequences are minimized by distinct pathways of repair, and 130 known human DNA repair genes are described here. Notable features presently include four enzymes that can remove uracil from DNA, seven recombination genes related to RAD51, and many recently discovered DNA polymerases that bypass damage, but only one system to remove the main DNA lesions induced by ultraviolet light. More human DNA repair genes will be found by comparison with model organisms and as common folds in three-dimensional protein structures are determined. Modulation of DNA repair should lead to clinical applications including improvement of radiotherapy and treatment with anticancer drugs and an advanced understanding of the cellular aging process."

https://openalex.org/W2119624849,"Human dreaming occurs during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. To investigate the structure of neural activity during REM sleep, we simultaneously recorded the activity of multiple neurons in the rat hippocampus during both sleep and awake behavior. We show that temporally sequenced ensemble firing rate patterns reflecting tens of seconds to minutes of behavioral experience are reproduced during REM episodes at an equivalent timescale. Furthermore, within such REM episodes behavior-dependent modulation of the subcortically driven theta rhythm is also reproduced. These results demonstrate that long temporal sequences of patterned multineuronal activity suggestive of episodic memory traces are reactivated during REM sleep. Such reactivation may be important for memory processing and provides a basis for the electrophysiological examination of the content of dream states."

https://openalex.org/W2102999073,"The chromosomal position of human genes is rapidly being established. We integrated these mapping data with genome-wide messenger RNA expression profiles as provided by SAGE (serial analysis of gene expression). Over 2.45 million SAGE transcript tags, including 160,000 tags of neuroblastomas, are presently known for 12 tissue types. We developed algorithms to assign these tags to UniGene clusters and their chromosomal position. The resulting Human Transcriptome Map generates gene expression profiles for any chromosomal region in 12 normal and pathologic tissue types. The map reveals a clustering of highly expressed genes to specific chromosomal regions. It provides a tool to search for genes that are overexpressed or silenced in cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2089592662,"Several plasma membrane chloride channels are well characterized, but much less is known about the molecular identity and function of intracellular Cl- channels. ClC-3 is thought to mediate swelling-activated plasma membrane currents, but we now show that this broadly expressed chloride channel is present in endosomal compartments and synaptic vesicles of neurons. While swelling-activated currents are unchanged in mice with disrupted ClC-3, acidification of synaptic vesicles is impaired and there is severe postnatal degeneration of the retina and the hippocampus. Electrophysiological analysis of juvenile hippocampal slices revealed no major functional abnormalities despite slightly increased amplitudes of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents. Mice almost lacking the hippocampus survive and show several behavioral abnormalities but are still able to acquire motor skills."

https://openalex.org/W1969600766,"The active zone is a specialized region of the presynaptic plasma membrane where synaptic vesicles dock and fuse. In this study, we have investigated the cellular mechanism underlying the transport and recruitment of the active zone protein Piccolo into nascent synapses. Our results show that Piccolo is transported to nascent synapses on an approximately 80 nm dense core granulated vesicle together with other constituents of the active zone, including Bassoon, Syntaxin, SNAP-25, and N-cadherin, as well as chromogranin B. Components of synaptic vesicles, such as VAMP 2/synaptobrevin II, synaptophysin, synaptotagmin, or proteins of the perisynaptic plasma membrane such as GABA transporter 1 (GAT1), were not present. These studies demonstrate that the presynaptic active zone is formed in part by the fusion of an active zone precursor vesicle with the presynaptic plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2137108685,"The growth arrest-specific gene 6 product (Gas6) is a secreted protein related to the anticoagulant protein S but its role in hemostasis is unknown. Here we show that inactivation of the Gas6 gene prevented venous and arterial thrombosis in mice, and protected against fatal collagen/epinephrine-induced thrombo embolism. Gas6-/- mice did not, however, suffer spontaneous bleeding and had normal bleeding after tail clipping. In addition, we found that Gas6 antibodies inhibited platelet aggregation in vitro and protected mice against fatal thrombo embolism without causing bleeding in vivo. Gas6 amplified platelet aggregation and secretion in response to known agonists. Platelet dysfunction in Gas6-/- mice resembled that of patients with platelet signaling transduction defects. Thus, Gas6 is a platelet-response amplifier that plays a significant role in thrombosis. These findings warrant further evaluation of the possible therapeutic use of Gas6 inhibition for prevention of thrombosis."

https://openalex.org/W2011331399,"The receptive fields of visual cortical neurons are bidirectionally modified by sensory deprivation and experience, but the synaptic basis for these changes is unknown. Here we demonstrate bidirectional, experience-dependent regulation of the composition and function of synaptic NMDA receptors (NMDARs) in visual cortex layer 2/3 pyramidal cells of young rats. Visual experience decreases the proportion of NR2B-only receptors, shortens the duration of NMDAR-mediated synaptic currents, and reduces summation of synaptic NMDAR currents during bursts of high-frequency stimulation. Visual deprivation exerts an opposite effect. Although the effects of experience and deprivation are reversible, the rates of synaptic modification vary. Experience can induce a detectable change in synaptic transmission within hours, while deprivation-induced changes take days. We suggest that experience-dependent changes in NMDAR composition and function regulate the development of receptive field organization in visual cortex."

https://openalex.org/W1968614642,"Notch1 has been shown to induce glia in the peripheral nervous system. However, it has not been known whether Notch can direct commitment to glia from multipotent progenitors of the central nervous system. Here we present evidence that activated Notch1 and Notch3 promotes the differentiation of astroglia from the rat adult hippocampus-derived multipotent progenitors (AHPs). Quantitative clonal analysis indicates that the action of Notch is likely to be instructive. Transient activation of Notch can direct commitment of AHPs irreversibly to astroglia. Astroglial induction by Notch signaling was shown to be independent of STAT3, which is a key regulatory transcriptional factor when ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) induces astroglia. These data suggest that Notch provides a CNTF-independent instructive signal of astroglia differentiation in CNS multipotent progenitor cells."

https://openalex.org/W1510737382,"Changes in bodily states, particularly those mediated by the autonomic nervous system, are crucial to ongoing emotional experience. A theoretical model proposes a first-order autoregulatory representation of bodily state at the level of dorsal pons, and a second-order experience-dependent re-mapping of changes in bodily state within structures such as cingulate and medial parietal cortices. We tested these anatomical predictions using positron emission tomography and a human neurological model (pure autonomic failure), in which peripheral autonomic denervation prevents the emergence of autonomic responses. Compared to controls, we observed task-independent differences in activity of dorsal pons and context-induced differences in cingulate and medial parietal activity in PAF patients. An absence of afferent feedback concerning autonomically generated bodily states was associated with subtle impairments of emotional responses in PAF patients. Our findings provide empirical support for a theory proposing a hierarchical representation of bodily states."
https://openalex.org/W2124386542,"Although both c-Ret and GFRα1 are required for responsiveness to GDNF, GFRα1 is widely expressed in the absence of c-Ret, suggesting alternative roles for “ectopic” sites of GFRα1 expression. We show that GFRα1 is released by neuronal cells, Schwann cells, and injured sciatic nerve. c-Ret stimulation in trans by soluble or immobilized GFRα1 potentiates downstream signaling, neurite outgrowth, and neuronal survival, and elicits dramatic localized expansions of axons and growth cones. Soluble GFRα1 mediates robust recruitment of c-Ret to lipid rafts via a novel mechanism requiring the c-Ret tyrosine kinase. Activated c-Ret associates with different adaptor proteins inside and outside lipid rafts. These results provide an explanation for the tissue distribution of GFRα1, supporting the physiological importance of c-Ret activation in trans as a novel mechanism to potentiate and diversify the biological responses to GDNF."

https://openalex.org/W2069853795,"The EphA4 receptor tyrosine kinase regulates the formation of the corticospinal tract (CST), a pathway controlling voluntary movements, and of the anterior commissure (AC), connecting the neocortical temporal lobes. To study EphA4 kinase signaling in these processes, we generated mice expressing mutant EphA4 receptors either lacking kinase activity or with severely downregulated kinase activity. We demonstrate that EphA4 is required for CST formation as a receptor for which it requires an active kinase domain. In contrast, the formation of the AC is rescued by kinase-dead EphA4, suggesting that in this structure EphA4 acts as a ligand for which its kinase activity is not required. Unexpectedly, the cytoplasmic sterile-alpha motif (SAM) domain is not required for EphA4 functions. Our findings establish both kinase-dependent and kinase-independent functions of EphA4 in the formation of major axon tracts."
https://openalex.org/W2092845948,"To investigate Eph-ephrin bidirectional signaling, a series of mutations were generated in the ephrin-B3 locus. The absence of both forward and reverse signaling resulted in mice with mirror movements as typified by a hopping locomotion. The corticospinal tract was defective as axons failed to respect the midline boundary of the spinal cord and bilaterally innervated both contralateral and ipsilateral motor neuron populations. A second mutation that expresses a truncated ephrin-B3 protein lacking its cytoplasmic domain did not lead to hopping, indicating that reverse signaling is not required for corticospinal innervation. Ephrin-B3 is concentrated at the spinal cord midline, while one of its receptors, EphA4, is expressed in postnatal corticospinal neurons as their fibers pathfind down the contralateral spinal cord. Our data indicate ephrin-B3 functions as a midline-anchored repellent to stimulate forward signaling in EphA4-expressing axons."

https://openalex.org/W2125691923,"During synapse formation, presynaptic axon outgrowth is terminated, presynaptic clusters of vesicles are associated with active zone proteins, and active zones are aligned with postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptors. We report here the identification of a novel serine/threonine kinase, SAD-1, that regulates several aspects of presynaptic differentiation in C. elegans. In sad-1 mutant animals presynaptic vesicle clusters in sensory neurons and motor neurons are diffuse and disorganized. Sensory axons fail to terminate in sad-1 mutants, whereas overexpression of SAD-1 causes sensory axons to terminate prematurely. SAD-1 protein is expressed in the nervous system and localizes to synapse-rich regions of the axons. SAD-1 is related to PAR-1, a kinase that regulates cell polarity during asymmetric cell division. Overexpression of SAD-1 causes mislocalization of vesicle proteins to dendrites, suggesting that sad-1 affects axonal-dendritic polarity as well as synaptic development."

https://openalex.org/W2083406057,"In the fly visual system, each class of photoreceptor neurons (R cells) projects to a different synaptic layer in the brain. R1-R6 axons terminate in the lamina, while R7 and R8 axons pass through the lamina and stop in the medulla. As R cell axons enter the lamina, they encounter both glial cells and neurons. The cellular requirement for R1-R6 targeting was determined using loss-of-function mutations affecting different cell types in the lamina. nonstop (encoding a ubiquitin-specific protease) is required for glial cell development and hedgehog for neuronal development. Removal of glial cells but not neurons disrupts R1-R6 targeting. We propose that glial cells provide the initial stop signal promoting growth cone termination in the lamina. These findings uncover a novel function for neuron-glial interactions in regulating target specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2171856761,"We have constructed a physical map of the human genome by using a panel of 90 whole-genome radiation hybrids (the TNG panel) in conjunction with 40,322 sequence-tagged sites (STSs) derived from random genomic sequences as well as expressed sequences. Of 36,678 STSs on the TNG radiation hybrid map, only 3604 (9.8%) were absent from the unassembled draft sequence of the human genome. Of 20,030 STSs ordered on the TNG map as well as the assembled human genome draft sequence and the Celera assembled human genome sequence, 36% of the STSs had a discrepant order between the working draft sequence and the Celera sequence. The TNG map order was identical to one of the two sequence orders in 60% of these discrepant cases."

https://openalex.org/W2123300858,"Rat neural crest stem cells (NCSCs) prospectively isolated from uncultured E14.5 sciatic nerve and transplanted into chick embryos generate fewer neurons than do NCSCs isolated from E10.5 neural tube explants. In addition, they differentiate primarily to cholinergic parasympathetic neurons, although in culture they can also generate noradrenergic sympathetic neurons. This in vivo behavior can be explained, at least in part, by a reduced sensitivity of sciatic nerve-derived NCSCs to the neurogenic signal BMP2 and by the observation that cholinergic neurons differentiate at a lower BMP2 concentration than do noradrenergic neurons in vitro. These results demonstrate that neural stem cells can undergo cell-intrinsic changes in their sensitivity to instructive signals, while maintaining multipotency and self-renewal capacity. They also suggest that the choice between sympathetic and parasympathetic fates may be determined by the local concentration of BMP2."

https://openalex.org/W2040804874,"How genes with newly characterized functions originate remains a fundamental question. PMCHL1 and PMCHL2, two chimeric genes derived from the melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) gene, offer an opportunity to examine such an issue in the human lineage. Detailed structural, expression, and phylogenetic analysis showed that the PMCHL1 gene was created near 25 million years ago (Ma) by a complex mechanism of exon shuffling through retrotransposition of an antisense MCH messenger RNA coupled to de novo creation of splice sites. PMCHL2 arose 5 to 10 Ma by an event of duplication involving a large chromosomal region encompassing the PMCHL1 locus. The RNA expression patterns of those chimeric genes suggest that they have been submitted to strong regulatory constraints during primate evolution."

https://openalex.org/W1559207481,"The mechanism underlying suppression of immune responses by interleukin-4 (IL-4) has remained unexplained. Here we show that the antigen-presenting dendritic cell is central to counter-regulation of autoimmune disease by IL-4. IL-4 acts at the locus of the dendritic cell to decrease the cytolytic T-cell response, preventing autoimmunity. Stimulation of cytotoxic precursors by antigen pulsed dendritic cells induces their differentiation but the process is blocked by IL-4. IL-4-influenced DC produce distinct effects on CD8+ T cells depending on their state of activation. The molecular basis for this regulation is the alteration of the expression ratio of the costimulatory ligands B7.1/B7.2 on dendritic cells. Our findings demonstrate that B7.2 induces expansion of CD8+ T cells and B7.1 governs their acquisition of cytolytic activity. IL-4 influences the dendritic cell to elicit qualitative differences in T-cell responses, providing the basis for counter-regulation mediated by IL-4."
