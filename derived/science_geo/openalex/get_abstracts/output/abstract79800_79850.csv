https://openalex.org/W2144464927,"A procedure has been developed for the iodination of human transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) with full retention of biological activity. Using the iodinated peptide, saturable receptors have been found for TGF-beta on normal rat kidney fibroblasts, a cell line that will grow in soft agar in the presence of TGFs but not in their absence. Scatchard analysis of the binding data showed a high affinity binding site (dissociation constant equal to 25 to 30 pM with approximately 17,000 receptors per cell). The receptor was specific for TGF-beta with epidermal growth factor, insulin, insulin-like growth factors I and II, platelet-derived growth factor, and TGF-alpha being unable to compete for the binding of 125I-TGF-beta to the receptor. The binding of TGF-beta was a time- and temperature-dependent process. At 37 degrees C, maximal binding was attained within 45 to 60 min after addition of 125I-TGF-beta followed by a rapid decline in cell-associated radioactivity due to degradation of the 125I-TGF-beta. As demonstrated using ammonium acetate, a compound known to inhibit lysosomal enzymes, this degradation was most likely due to the action of proteolytic enzymes found in the lysosome. At 0 degrees C, binding reached a plateau within 2 to 3 h and maintained this level with no apparent drop during the 4-h incubation period. The receptor could be down-regulated by TGF-beta, but not by epidermal growth factor, to approximately 50% of the level initially observed."
https://openalex.org/W1489195678,"Abstract The asparagine-linked sugar chains of the membrane of baby hamster kidney cells and their polyoma transformant were quantitatively released as oligosaccharides by hydrazinolysis and labeled by NaB3H4 reduction. The radioactive oligosaccharides thus obtained were fractionated by paper electrophoresis. The neutral oligosaccharides of both cells were exclusively of high mannose type. The acidic oligosaccharides were bi-, tri-, and tetraantennary complex-type sugar chains with Man alpha 1----6 (Man alpha 1----3) Man beta 1----4 GlcNAc beta 1----4 (+/- Fuc alpha 1----6) GlcNAc as their cores and Gal beta 1----4 GlcNAc and various lengths of Gal beta 1----4 GlcNAc repeating chains in their outer-chain moieties. Prominent features of these acidic oligosaccharides are that all sialic acid residues were N-acetylneuraminic acid and were linked exclusively at C-3 of the nonreducing terminal galactose residues of the outer chains. Comparative study of oligosaccharides of the two cells by Bio-Gel P-4 column chromatography revealed that transformation of baby hamster kidney cells leads to a reduction in high mannose-type oligosaccharides and an increase in tetraantennary oligosaccharides. Increase of the outer chains linked at C-6 of the Man alpha 1----6 residue of the core is the cause of increase in the relative amount of highly branched oligosaccharides in the polyoma transformant."
https://openalex.org/W1512173883,"Growth factors (alpha-thrombin and insulin) activate a Na+/H+ antiport in G0/G1-arrested Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts (CCL39). In this report, we have examined the influence of intracellular pH on this exchange activity, measured by initial rates of amiloride-sensitive 22Na+ uptake, in the absence and presence of growth factors. Our results indicate the following. 1) In quiescent as in mitogen-stimulated cells, Na+/H+ antiport is regulated by internal H+ in an allosteric way, whereas, in contrast, interactions with external H+ and Na+ obey simple saturation kinetics. 2) The growth factor-induced activation of Na+/H+ exchange, which, under physiological conditions, is responsible for a sustained cytoplasmic alkalinization, is due to an increased affinity for internal H+ (the apparent pK is shifted by approximately 0.3 pH unit towards alkaline pH values). Therefore, we propose that growth factors promote a conformational change of the Na+/H+ antiporter, possibly at the level of an internal modifier site(s)."
https://openalex.org/W1602520925,"Leukotriene B4 (LTB4), formed by the 5-lipoxygenase pathway in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN), may be an important mediator of inflammation. Recent studies suggest that human leukocytes can convert LTB4 to products that are less biologically active. To examine the catabolism of LTB4, we developed (using high performance liquid chromatography) a sensitive, reproducible assay for this mediator and its omega-oxidation products (20-OH- and 20-COOH-LTB4). With this assay, we have found that human PMN (but not human monocytes, lymphocytes, or platelets) convert exogenous LTB4 almost exclusively to 20-OH- and 20-COOH-LTB4 (identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry). Catabolism of exogenous LTB4 by omega-oxidation is rapid (t1/2 approximately 4 min at 37 degrees C in reaction mixtures containing 1.0 microM LTB4 and 20 X 10(6) PMN/ml), temperature-dependent (negligible at 0 degrees C), and varies with cell number as well as with initial substrate concentration. The pathway for omega-oxidation in PMN is specific for LTB4 and 5(S),12(S)-dihydroxy-6,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (only small amounts of other dihydroxylated-derivatives of arachidonic acid are converted to omega-oxidation products). Even PMN that are stimulated by phorbol myristate acetate to produce large amounts of superoxide anion radicals catabolize exogenous leukotriene B4 primarily by omega-oxidation. Finally, LTB4 that is generated when PMN are stimulated with the calcium ionophore, A23187, is rapidly catabolized by omega-oxidation. Thus, human PMN not only generate and respond to LTB4, but also rapidly and specifically catabolize this mediator by omega-oxidation."
https://openalex.org/W1535884808,"External application of bradykinin to neuroblastoma X glioma hybrid NG108-15 cells produced a sustained depolarization preceded by a transient hyperpolarization. Bradykinin also increased the frequency of miniature end-plate potentials recorded from cultured striated muscle cells which had been innervated by NG108-15 cells. Parallelism between facilitative phases of miniature end-plate potentials and depolarization indicates that bradykinin caused an enhanced synaptic transmission from NG108-15 cells due to depolarization. Effects of bradykinin on phospholipid metabolism in the hybrid cells were then examined to shed light upon the mechanism by which bradykinin-receptor interaction leads to facilitation of synaptic transmission. Bradykinin induced specific incorporation of 32Pi into phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylinositol without affecting [3H]glycerol incorporation into these phospholipids by 10 min after its addition. The addition of bradykinin to hybrid cells prelabeled with 32Pi caused a transient decrease (maximal effect seen at 10-30 s) in the radioactivity from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI-4,5-P2) which was followed by the accumulation of radioactivity in phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylinositol. A Ca2+ ionophore, A23187, failed to induce the initial degradation of PI-4,5-P2. The data show that the magnitudes of bradykinin-induced PI-4,5-P2 degradation and membrane potential changes in NG108-15 cells are both dependent on the concentration of bradykinin and that the degradation of PI-4,5-P2 precedes the electrophysiological responses. Taken together with the finding that bradykinin induced a transient increase in Ca2+ influx (at 10-20 s), it appears that a rapid and transient degradation of PI-4,5-P2 might be related to the initiation of the NG108-15 cell activities through mobilization of extracellular Ca2+ into the cells."
https://openalex.org/W1549296443,"The enzymatic methylation of porcine adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) in both its native form and a form which is deamidated at asparagine 25 has been compared using purified protein carboxyl methyltransferase from bovine brain. Incubation of deamidated ACTH with high concentrations of methyltransferase resulted in near stoichiometric levels of methyl incorporation (78 mol %), while the methylation of native ACTH was highly substoichiometric (3-12 mol %). The Km and Vmax for deamidated ACTH were 1.9 microM and 11,200 pmol/min/mg, respectively, making this peptide the most specific substrate known for the mammalian methyltransferase. Deamidation of asparagine 25 leads to the formation of an atypical isopeptide bond in which the resulting aspartyl residue is linked to the adjacent glycine 26 via its side-chain beta-carboxyl group rather than the usual alpha-carboxyl linkage (Graf, L., Bajusz, S., Patthy A., Barat, E., and Cseh, G. (1971) Acta Biochim. Biophys. Acad. Sci. Hung. 6, 415-418; Bornstein, P., and Balian, G. (1977) Methods Enzymol. 47, 132-145). A synthetic isopeptide (beta-linked) analog of deamidated ACTH serves as a highly effective substrate for the methyltransferase, but the corresponding normal (alpha-linked) peptide does not, indicating that this enzyme selectively recognizes the alpha-carboxyl group of atypical beta-linked L-aspartyl residues (see also accompanying paper (Murray, E.D., Jr., and Clarke, S. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 10722-10732]. Methylation of atypical beta-linked L-aspartyl residues resulting from deamidation can account for previous observations that in vitro protein carboxyl methylation in mammalian systems almost always occurs with a low stoichiometry and that these protein methyl esters are considerably less stable than most chemically formed protein methyl esters."
https://openalex.org/W1599449593,"The two exocyclic oxygen atoms at phosphorus of cAMP have been replaced by a sulfur atom or by a dimethylamino group. These substitutions introduce chirality at the phosphorus atom; therefore, two diastereoisomers are known for each derivative: (SP)-cAMPS, (RP)-cAMPS, (SP)-cAMPN(CH3)2, and RP-cAMPN(CH3)2. We have investigated the agonistic and antagonistic activities of these compounds in four cAMP-dependent reactions: activation of the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum via its cell surface cAMP receptor, and phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinases type I, type II (both mammalian enzymes), and type D (derived from D. discoideum). The results show that 1) the compounds (SP)-cAMPS and (SP)-cAMPN(CH3)2 are (mostly full) agonists for the four proteins. Half-maximal activation is at micromolar concentrations (0.8-7 microM). 2) (RP)-cAMPS is a full antagonist for the cell surface receptor and protein kinases type I and II, with apparent inhibition constants between 0.8 and 8 microM. This compound is a partial agonist for protein kinase type D, where it induces maximally 50% activation of the enzyme if compared with cAMP. 3) (RP)-cAMPN(CH3)2 is a full antagonist for the cell surface receptor, and for protein kinase type II. This compound is a partial agonist for protein kinase type I (at least 50% activation if compared with cAMP), and inactive for protein kinase type D. This derivative is at least 25-fold less active as an antagonist than (RP)-cAMPS. 4) The activity of mixtures of different concentrations of the antagonist (RP)-cAMPS with different concentrations of cAMP reveals that the compound is a competitive antagonist of cAMP at micromolar concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W1514114756,"The ATP-independent type I and the ATP-dependent type II DNA topoisomerase of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been purified to near homogeneity, and the purification procedures are reported. Both purified topoisomerases are single subunit enzymes with monomer weights of Mr = 90,000 and 150,000 for the type I and type II enzyme, respectively. Sedimentation and gel filtration data suggest that the type I enzyme is monomeric and the type II enzyme is dimeric. Similar to other purified eukaryotic topoisomerases, the yeast type I enzyme does not require a divalent cation for activity, but is stimulated 10-20-fold in the presence of 7-10 mM Mg(II) or Ca(II). Mn(II) is about 25% as efficient as Mg(II) in this stimulation but Co(II) is inhibitory. The yeast type II topoisomerase has an absolute requirement for a divalent cation: Mg(II) is the most effective, whereas Mn(II), Ca(II), or Co(II) supports the reaction to a lesser extent. The type II enzyme also requires ATP or dATP; the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogues adenylyl imidodiphosphate and adenylyl (beta,gamma-methylene)diphosphonate are potent inhibitors. Both yeast topoisomerases are completely inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide at 0.5 mM. In addition, the type II enzyme, but not the type I enzyme, is inhibited to various extents by coumermycin, ethidium, and berenil. Both topoisomerases are nuclear enzymes; no topoisomerase specific to mitochondria has been detected."
https://openalex.org/W1511766554,"The malF gene product is an inner membrane component of the maltose transport system in Escherichia coli. Some gene fusions between malF and lacZ (encoding the normally cytoplasmic enzyme beta-galactosidase) produce hybrid proteins which are membrane-bound while other fusions produce hybrid proteins which are cytoplasmic (Silhavy, T. J., Casadaban, M. J., Shuman, H. A., and Beckwith, J. R. (1976) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 73, 3423-3427). To further analyze the localization properties of the different classes of fusion proteins and of the intact MalF protein, we have obtained the DNA sequence of 5 malF-lacZ fusions and the wild type malF gene. From the predicted amino acid sequence, MalF protein contains 514 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 56,947. Analysis of the hydropathic character of MalF using the Kyte-Doolittle assignments (Kyte, J., and Doolittle, R. F. (1982) J. Mol. Biol. 157, 105-132), indicates that the protein may have 2 or 3 amino-terminal membrane-spanning segments and 4 or 5 carboxy-terminal membrane-spanning segments separated by a region of 181 hydrophilic residues. Localization properties of the different fusion proteins correspond with degree of hydrophobicity. By sequencing upstream from malF, the malE-malF intercistronic region was found to be 153 base pairs in length and to contain inverted repeats, homologous to intercistronic repeats of many other operons. Further analysis of this region may help in understanding the observed step-down in synthesis of the MalF protein."
https://openalex.org/W1972822018,"Using NP-40-treated dog sperm as a model, the stimulatory effect of cAMP upon reactivated flagellar motility has been shown to be dependent upon the cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of a heat-stable NP-40-soluble protein of 56 kd. Examination by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of NP-40 extract proteins phosphorylated with gamma-32P-ATP revealed a major cAMP-dependent phosphopeptide at 56 kd. This is the only cAMP-dependent phosphoprotein common to NP-40 extracts of all tissues that show cAMP-dependent stimulation of flagellar motility. These cells and tissues include sea urchin, dog, and human sperm, as well as dog trachea and retina. Moreover, this phosphoprotein is absent in nonstimulatory extracts from tissues such as skeletal muscle, brain, and liver. We conclude that the cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of the 56 kd peptide represents a major regulatory component of not only sperm but other types of axonemal motility as well."
https://openalex.org/W1974611875,"A murine retroviral vector has been used to separate physically the overlapping genes encoded by SV40. This minimal retroviral vector contains LTRs and other cis-acting signals required for infectious RNA virus propagation. We placed the SV40 early region within this DNA and after transfection of cells producing helper Moloney murine leukemia virus, SV40 retroviruses (MV40) could be rescued. Cytoplasmic spliced large T and small t transcripts, as well as unspliced transcripts, are packaged into virions with equal efficiency. Pure SV40 large T retroviruses can be cloned from these heterogeneous virus stocks by secondary transformation of rodent cells. The large T retrovirus stocks morphologically transform primary or established mouse and rat lines with high efficiency. There is little difference in transformation either by agar assay or focus formation between retroviruses carrying both SV40 genes or large T alone. We present quantitative data that demonstrate that abortive transformation of rodent cells by SV40, transient expression of the transformed phenotype after infection, is not manifested by MV40. Thus abortive transformation is not the result of a weakly dominant transforming gene, but rather of the normally inefficient mode of integration and early gene expression of SV40 upon infection of rodent cells."
https://openalex.org/W1557524780,"Hep-G2 cells, incubated with L-[35S]methionine, incorporate radioactivity into fibrinogen and several fibrinogen-related compounds. Pulse-chase experiments indicate that several of these compounds are precursors of fibrinogen and that the cells contain intracellular pools of A alpha and gamma chains which participate in the assembly of fibrinogen. The rate of synthesis of the three component chains of fibrinogen is unequal with that of the B beta chain being less than that of the A alpha and gamma chains. The sequence of events which lead to the assembly of fibrinogen was deduced by determining the appearance of the radioactive chains in each of the fibrinogen precursors and in fibrinogen at various times during a pulse-chase incubation. Fibrinogen assembly commences while nascent incomplete B beta chains are attached at polysomes. Preformed A alpha and gamma chains, drawn from the intracellular pool, combine independently to the growing B beta chains. On completion of the nascent B beta chains, newly formed B beta-A alpha and B beta-gamma complexes are released from the polysomes and enter the luminal space of the endoplasmic reticulum. Later other A alpha and gamma chains are added by ordered disulfide interaction, leading to the eventual formation of dimeric fibrinogen."
https://openalex.org/W1520549427,"Phosphatidylglycerol and oleic acid had differential effects on cytidylyltransferase activity in cytosol and microsomes. The low-molecular-weight cytidylyltransferase in cytosol was stimulated more by phosphatidylglycerol than by oleic acid, whereas microsomal activity was stimulated more by oleic acid than by phosphatidylglycerol. Microsomal activity was stimulated by several unsaturated fatty acids but was not stimulated by saturated fatty acids. Bovine serum albumin decreased cytidylyltransferase activity in microsomes in the presence or absence of oleic acid but did not alter the activity measured in the presence of phosphatidylglycerol. The addition of oleic acid to albumin/microsome mixtures in amounts exceeding the binding capacity of albumin lead to complete recovery of the oleic acid stimulation. The addition of oleic acid to postmitochondrial supernatants resulted in a translocation of cytidylyltransferase activity from cytosol to microsome. The magnitude of the shift was severalfold greater with fetal preparations than adult. The free fatty acid content of microsomes increased coincident with the translocation. Bovine serum albumin, added to postmitochondrial supernatants, caused a release of cytidylyltransferase from microsomes to cytosol and a corresponding decrease in microsomal free fatty acid content. The amount of cytidylyltransferase activity in microsomes increased shortly after birth. The increase was accompanied by an increase in free fatty acid content of the microsomes. The increase in cytidylyltransferase activity and free fatty acids which occurred in vivo following birth was nearly identical to that obtained by adding oleic acid to postmitochondrial supernatants from fetal lung. We conclude that free fatty acids may affect the intracellular activity of cytidylyltransferase by promoting the translocation of inactive cytosolic forms to microsomes as well as by stimulating microsomal bound activity."
https://openalex.org/W1562738433,"A hormone responsive adenylate cyclase has been reconstituted in phosphatidylcholine vesicles from its isolated protein components. The proteins used were the affinity chromatography purified (500-2000-fold) or pure Mr = 64,000 beta-adrenergic receptors (beta AR) isolated from hamster and guinea pig lung membranes, the pure heterotrimeric (Mr: alpha = 42,000; beta = 35,000; gamma approximately equal to 5,000) guanine nucleotide regulatory protein (Ns) isolated from human erythrocyte membranes; and the catalytic unit of the adenylate cyclase (C) solubilized from bovine brain caudate nucleus and resolved from beta AR and Ns by gel filtration. Adenylate cyclase activity in vesicles containing C alone was stimulated by forskolin but not by guanine nucleotides or by the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol. Reconstitution of Ns and C interactions in the lipid vesicles resulted in guanine nucleotide but not beta-adrenergic agonist sensitivity. When beta AR was inserted together with Ns and C into lipid vesicles, the catalytic unit became responsive to beta-adrenergic agonists as well and this stimulation was blocked in a stereoselective manner by the beta-adrenergic antagonist alprenolol. Regulation of adenylate cyclase activity in the reconstituted system by beta-adrenergic agonists, guanine nucleotides, and Mg2+ showed properties similar to those observed in native membranes. The interactions of the various protein components in the reconstituted system were also monitored by GTPase activity. Such activity was observed to occur primarily as a result of receptor-Ns interactions. The results described in this report document the feasibility of studying hormone-responsive adenylate cyclase in a totally reconstituted system which retains the major regulatory properties of the enzyme in its native membrane-bound environment."
https://openalex.org/W27976590,"The hormonal regulation of adenylate cyclase, cAMP-dependent protein kinase activation, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion was studied in AtT20 mouse pituitary tumor cells. Corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) stimulated cAMP accumulation and ACTH release in these cells. Maximal ACTH release was seen with 30 nM CRF and was accompanied by a 2-fold rise in intracellular cAMP. When cells were incubated with both 30 nM CRF and 0.5 mM 3-methylisobutylxanthine (MIX) cAMP levels were increased 20-fold, however, ACTH release was not substantially increased beyond release seen with CRF alone. The activation profiles of cAMP-dependent protein kinases I and II were studied by measuring residual cAMP-dependent phosphotransferase activity associated with immunoprecipitated regulatory subunits of the kinases. Cells incubated with CRF in the absence of MIX showed concentration-dependent activation of protein kinase I which paralleled stimulation of ACTH release. Protein kinase II was minimally activated. When cells were exposed to CRF in the presence of 0.5 mM MIX there was still a preferential activation of protein kinase I, although 50% of the cytosolic protein kinase II was activated. Complete activation of both protein kinases I and II was seen when cells were incubated with 0.5 mM MIX and 10 microM forskolin. Under these conditions cAMP levels were elevated 80-fold. CRF, isoproterenol, and forskolin stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in isolated membranes prepared from AtT20 cells. CRF and isoproterenol stimulated cyclase activity up to 5-fold while forskolin stimulated cyclase activity up to 15-fold. Our data demonstrate that ACTH secretion from AtT20 cells is mediated by small changes in intracellular levels of cAMP and activation of only a small fraction of the total cytosolic cAMP-dependent protein kinase in these cells is required for maximal ACTH secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1594420006,"The restriction endonuclease EcoRI hydrolyzes the Rp diastereomer of d(pGGsAATTCC), an analogue of d(pGGAATTCC) containing a chiral phosphorothioate group at the cleavage site between the deoxyguanosine and the deoxyadenosine residues (Connolly, B.A., Potter, B.V.L., Eckstein, F., Pingoud, A., and Grotjahn, L. (1984) Biochemistry 23, 3343-3453). Performing the reaction in H2(18)O leads to d(pGG) and the hexanucleotide d([18O, S]pAATTCC) which has an 18O-containing phosphorothioate group at the 5' terminus. Further hydrolysis of this hexamer with nuclease P1 yields deoxyadenosine 5'-O-[18O]phosphorothioate which can be stereospecifically phosphorylated with adenylate kinase and pyruvate kinase to give Sp-[18O] deoxyadenosine 5'-O-(1-thiotriphosphate). 31P NMR spectroscopy shows the oxygen-18 in this compound to be in a bridging position between the alpha- and beta-phosphorus atoms. Thus, the hydrolysis reaction catalyzed by EcoRI proceeds with inversion of configuration at phosphorus. This result is compatible with a direct enzyme-catalyzed nucleophilic attack of H2O at phosphorus without involvement of a covalent enzyme intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W1606628486,"Abstract Thymidylate kinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of thymidine 5'-monophosphate to thymidine 5'-diphosphate in the pathway of synthesis of dTTP from dTMP. We have purified the enzyme approximately 5000-fold from a plasmid-bearing strain of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that over produces the activity 6-fold. The protein appears homogeneous by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel analysis and has a molecular weight of 25,000. The amino acid composition and the sequence of amino acids on the NH2 terminus have been determined. Our interest in thymidylate kinase stems from the fact that R. A. Sclafani and W. Fangman (personal communication) recently presented genetic evidence that this enzyme is encoded by the CDC8 gene of yeast. In this paper, we show, by several biochemical criteria, that thymidylate kinase is the product of the CDC8 gene. First, extracts of strains bearing six different alleles of cdc8 show no thymidylate kinase activity. Secondly, strains carrying the CDC8 gene on a high-copy-number plasmid produce 6-fold higher levels of the kinase activity than does wild type. Third, the DNA sequence of the CDC8 gene reveals an open reading frame that encodes a protein with the same amino-terminal sequence as purified thymidylate kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1480410394,"The human asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGP-R) is a membrane glycoprotein of 46,000 Da which possesses two N-linked oligosaccharide chains (Schwartz, A. L., and Rup, D. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 11249-11255). In order to examine the role of N-linked oligosaccharides in the biosynthesis, intracellular routing, and function of the ASGP-R, we have used Hep G2 cells, which have a large number of ASGP-R, and two inhibitors of glycosylation, swainsonine and tunicamycin. In the presence of swainsonine, newly synthesized ASGP-R is a 43,000-Da species which is endoglycosidase H-sensitive, appears on the Hep G2 cell surface, and specifically binds 125I-asialoorosomucoid (ASOR). In the presence of tunicamycin newly synthesized ASGP-R is a 34,000-Da nonglycosylated species which appears on the Hep G2 cell surface where it specifically binds 125I-ASOR. There is no major effect on subsequent uptake and degradation of 125I-ASOR in cells whose ASGP-R was synthesized in the presence of tunicamycin. The turnover of ASGP-R synthesized in the presence of either swainsonine or tunicamycin is not significantly altered from that found for the normal 46,000-Da species. Thus, it appears that the two N-linked oligosaccharide chains of the human ASGP-R do not play a major role in the intracellular routing, turnover, or function of ASGP-R."
https://openalex.org/W2110011113,"Using a cDNA probe complementary to rat L-type pyruvate kinase mRNAs, we studied the respective roles of glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones, glucagon, and insulin in the induction of specific mRNAs in the liver of animals refed either a maltose-rich or a fructose-rich diet. Neither adrenalectomized nor thyroidectomized nor diabetic animals could express L-type pyruvate kinase mRNAs in their liver when refed the carbohydrate-rich diets. When the animals were given the missing hormone, the level of hybridizable mRNAs returned to normal values but administration of the hormone alone failed to induce mRNA synthesis in fasted animals. Both glucagon and cyclic AMP abolished the induction of L-type pyruvate kinase mRNAs in refed animals. Exogenous insulin, whatever the dose, could not reverse the inhibitory action of glucagon. Insulin has usually been regarded as the main regulator of L-type pyruvate kinase gene expression. It appears now that glucagon, beside regulating the enzyme activity by phosphorylation mechanisms, may also modulate L-type pyruvate kinase synthesis at a pre-translational level. Consequently, our results show that three conditions are required for the synthesis of liver L-type pyruvate kinase mRNAs: (i) the presence of dietary carbohydrates, (ii) the cessation of glucagon release, and (iii) the presence of permissive hormones, including insulin."
https://openalex.org/W1498185925,"The method of continuous saturation has been used to measure the electron spin relaxation parameter T_(1)T_(2) at temperatures between 10 and 50 K for a variety of S = 1/2 species including: Cu_A and cytochrome a of cytochrome c oxidase, the type 1 copper in several blue copper proteins, the type 2 copper in laccase, inorganic Cu(II) complexes, sulfur radicals, and low spin heme proteins. The temperature dependence and the magnitude of T_(1)T_(2) for all of the species examined are accounted for by assuming that the Van Vleck Raman process dominates the electron spin-lattice relaxation. Over the entire temperature range examined, the relaxation of the type 1 coppers in six to seven times faster than that of type 2 copper, inorganic copper, and sulfur radicals, in spite of the similar g-anisotropies of these species. This result may indicate that the coupling of the phonon bath to the spin center is more effective in type 1 coppers than in the other complexes studied. The relaxation of Cu_A of cytochrome oxidase exhibits an unusual temperature dependence relative to the other copper complexes studied, suggesting that the protein environment of this center is different from that of the other copper centers studied and/or that Cu_A is influenced by a magnetic dipolar interaction with another, faster-relaxing paramagnetic site in the enzyme. A comparison of the saturation characteristics of the Cu_A EPR signal in native and partially reduced CO complexes of the enzyme also suggests the existence of such an interaction. The implications of these results with respect to the disposition of the metal centers in cytochrome oxidase are discussed"
https://openalex.org/W1644206485,"Oxidized cytochrome c oxidase in a carbon monoxide atmosphere slowly becomes reduced as shown by changes in its visible spectra and its reactivity toward oxygen. The of cytochrome c oxidase by this procedure has been used to prepare mixed valence hybrids. We have found that this process is a general phenomenon for oxygen-binding heme proteins, and even for isolated hemin in basic aqueous solution. This reductive reaction may have physiological significance. It also explains why oxygen-binding heme proteins become oxidized much more slowly and appear to be more stable when they are kept under a CO atmosphere. Oxidized alpha and beta chains of human hemoglobin become reduced under CO much more slowly than does cytochrome c oxidase, where the CO-binding heme is coupled with another electron accepting metal center. By observing the reaction in both the forward and reverse direction, we have concluded that the heme is reduced by an equivalent of the water-gas shift reaction (CO + H2O----CO2 + 2e- + 2H+). The reaction does not require molecular oxygen. However, when the CO-driven reduction of cytochrome c oxidase occurs in the presence of oxygen, there is a competition between CO and oxygen for the reduced heme and copper of cytochrome alpha 3. Under certain conditions when both CO and oxygen are present, a peroxide adduct derived from oxygen reduction can be observed. This 607 nm complex, described in 1981 by Nicholls and Chanady (Nicholls, P., and Chanady, G. (1981) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 634, 256-265), forms and decays with kinetics in accord with the rate constants for CO dissociation, oxygen association and reduction, and dissociation of the peroxide adduct. In the absence of oxygen, if a mixture of cytochrome c and cytochrome c oxidase is incubated under a CO atmosphere, auto-reduction of the cytochrome c as well as of the cytochrome c oxidase occurs. By our proposed mechanism this involves a redistribution of electrons from cytochrome alpha 3 to cytochrome alpha and cytochrome c."
https://openalex.org/W2009213314,The biosynthesis of glycoprotein N-linked oligosaccharides in D. discoideum is initiated by the transfer of a large precursor glycan from a carrier lipid. The subsequent processing of this precursor is dramatically dependent upon the stage of development. In early development processing retains the high mannose structure of the precursor and modifies some glycans by addition of fucose to core sugars and sulfate and phosphate to others. These reactions are coordinately lost during aggregation. Processing in late development extensively trims the precursor and adds fucose to peripheral mannose units of the smallest glycans. These reactions appear coincident with formation of tips on cell mounds. Experiments in which cells were starved in shaken suspension suggest that intercellular contacts and cyclic AMP signals may be sufficient to cause the controlled expression of these two alternate sets of processing enzymes.
https://openalex.org/W1410278773,"The mutant allele (uncA401) of the gene for the alpha subunit of Escherichia coli F1-ATPase was cloned from the total DNA of the mutant AN120 on a hybrid plasmid pAN120. Determination of the DNA sequence of the alpha subunit gene from pAN120 revealed a single base change of cytosine at nucleotide residue 1118 to thymine and indicated that serine 373 was replaced by phenylalanine. It has been reported that the mutant F1 is defective in a step of steady-state catalysis, whereas its single turnover process is normal (Kanazawa, H., Noumi, T., Matsuoka, I., Hirata T., and Futai, M. (1984) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 228, 258-269). Thus, we concluded that serine 373 in the alpha subunit is essential for steady-state catalysis by F1-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1594745401,"The early events of steroidogenesis, following adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) stimulation, were investigated in primary cultures of bovine adrenal cortical cells. Steroidogenesis was elevated 4-fold within 5 min of exposure to 10(-7) M ACTH and increased linearly for 12 h and declined thereafter. Cholesterol side-chain cleavage (SCC) activity was increased 2.5-fold in mitochondria isolated from cells exposed for 2 h to ACTH and 0.5 mM aminoglutethimide, even though cytochrome P-450scc only increases after 12 h. Mitochondrial free cholesterol levels increased during the same time period (16.5 to 25 micrograms/mg of protein), but then both cholesterol levels and SCC activity declined in parallel. It is concluded that early ACTH-induced effects on cellular steroidogenesis result from these changes in mitochondrial free cholesterol. The maximum rate of cholesterol transport to mitochondria in aminoglutethimide-blocked cells (8.6 micrograms/mg of protein/h) was consistent with both the maximum rate of mitochondrial cholesterol SCC and cellular steroidogenesis (6.0 micrograms of pregnenolone/mg/h and 5.5 micrograms of steroid/mg of mitochondria/h, respectively). Cycloheximide (0.2 mM) rapidly blocked (less than 10 min) cellular steroidogenesis, cholesterol SCC activity, and access of cholesterol to cytochrome P-450scc without affecting mitochondrial free cholesterol. The distribution of steroid products fell into three distinct phases during a 24-h period following ACTH stimulation: an initial increase in SCC activity (0-4 h), elevation of androstenedione in place of corticosterone (4-12 h), and then in place of cortisol (12-24 h). The changes from 4 to 24 h result from a progressive stimulation by ACTH of 17 alpha-hydroxylase activity (but not 21-hydroxylase or C17:20 lyase activities) that is maintained even when stimulation of total steroidogenesis has stopped."
https://openalex.org/W1536696467,"We report here the isolation and structure of a new repeated DNA element, tau. This element, from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is 371 base pairs long and is flanked on either end by the same invertedly repeated sequence found at the ends of some Ty and sigma elements in yeast, copia elements in Drosophila and spleen necrosis virus. The tau inverted repeats are themselves flanked by a 5-base pair directly repeated genomic sequence that is present only once in a cognate tau-allele. These structural characteristics, the presence of multiple copies of tau in the genome, and the isolation of tau+ and tau- allelic pairs suggest that tau may be capable of transposition either alone or in association with some larger element. Detailed sequence analysis of the tau, sigma, and delta elements revealed that all three contain significant regions of homology, suggesting that they are probably members of a single family derived from a common progenitor."
https://openalex.org/W2111638403,"We have previously transferred an ovalbumin-beta-globin fusion gene (ovalglobin) into primary cultures of chick oviduct cells and demonstrated that an ovalbumin gene 5'-flanking sequence between -221 and -95 is necessary for progesterone-mediated transcriptional induction (Dean, D. C., Knoll, B. J., Riser, M. E., and O'Malley, B. W. (1983) Nature (Lond.) 305, 551-554). Here we compare 5'-flanking sequences required for induction of the ovalglobin gene by 17 beta-estradiol and progesterone. The early gene of simian virus 40 was inserted into the same plasmid as the ovalbumin fusion gene to serve as an internal control. Since transcription of the viral early gene was unaffected by the presence of steroid hormone or deletions in the ovalbumin gene 5'-flanking region, the level of its transcripts could be monitored as a reference standard for ovalglobin transcription. Ovalglobin transcripts initiated principally from the ovalbumin cap site in the presence or absence of progesterone and 17 beta-estradiol. Deletion of 5'-flanking sequences to -197 had little effect on the induction with either hormone, while successive deletions to -180, -161, and -143 resulted in a gradual decrease in the level of induction. Deletion to -95 eliminated the induction. The results of this study indicate that DNA control elements for regulation of the ovalbumin gene by estrogen and progesterone either overlap directly or are clustered in close proximity in the 5'-flanking region near the ovalbumin gene promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1491612122,"Complex formation between cytochrome c oxidase and cytochrome c perturbs the optical absorption spectrum of heme c and heme a in the region of the alpha-, beta, and gamma-bands. The perturbations have been used to titrate cytochrome c oxidase with cytochrome c. A stoichiometry of one molecule of cytochrome c bound per molecule of cytochrome c oxidase is obtained (1 heme c per heme aa3). In contrast, a stoichiometry of 2:1 was found earlier using a gel-filtration method (Rieder, R., and Bosshard, H.R. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 6045-6053). From the result of the spectrophotometric titration and from the wavelength position of the perturbation signals it is concluded that cytochrome c oxidase contains only a single binding site for cytochrome c which is close enough to heme a to function as an electron transfer site. The second site detected earlier by the gel-filtration method must be remote from this electron transfer site. Scatchard plots of the titration data are curvilinear, possibly indicating interactions between cytochrome c-binding sites on adjacent monomers of dimeric cytochrome c oxidase. The relationship between cytochrome c binding and the reaction of cytochrome c oxidase with ferrocytochrome c is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1487395954,"An activity gel procedure is described to identify functional polypeptides of human poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Purified or crude enzyme preparations from HeLa cells were electrophoresed in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels containing gapped DNA. After renaturation of the peptides in situ, the intact gel was incubated in a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase reaction mixture containing [32P]NAD. Autoradiograms of the gels consistently exhibited a major activity band at Mr = 116,000-120,000; in many runs, three minor distinct bands at Mr = 125,000, 135,000, and 145,000 were also seen. [32P]NAD appeared to be incorporated into poly(ADP-ribose) since: (i) the activity bands were not detectable when the enzyme-inhibitor 3-aminobenzamide was added to the gel incubation mixture; and (ii) the radioactive polymer, electroeluted from the bands, was completely digested by phosphodiesterase I. Preliminary activity gel analysis of extracts of HeLa cells treated with different DNA-damaging agents revealed that the apparent activity of the Mr = 116,000 form increased by about 10-fold in cells treated with 1 mM dimethyl sulfate and 10-20-fold in cells treated with 10 microM mitomycin C. Only a small increase was obtained in cells treated with 1 mM methyl methanesulfonate, and no change in the activity band pattern was observed after 50 and 100 J/m-2 of UV irradiation."
https://openalex.org/W1553410423,"A mutant (KF11) of Escherichia coli H+-translocating ATPase (F1-F0) has a single point mutation in the beta subunit of F1 that has lost 90% of its Mg2+-dependent ATPase activity (Kanazawa, H., Horiuchi, Y., Takagi, M., Ishino, Y., and Futai, M. (1980) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 88, 695-703). The mutation was mapped at about the 500th nucleotide residue from the 5' end of the beta subunit gene by a genetic recombination test on the physical map of the cistron coding for the beta subunit. The mutant allele of KF11 (uncD11) was cloned on a hybrid plasmid (pKF11) via DNA isolated from a lambda uncD11 transducing phage. Restriction fragments of pKF11 containing the estimated mutation site were subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under conditions where strands were separated into single strands. The two strands of a DNA segment, which was shown to carry an altered base, showed anomalous migration compared with those from the wild-type fragment. The results confirmed the result of mapping of the altered site by genetic tests. On the basis of these results, the nucleotide sequence of the mutated gene was determined, and a single base change of the 524th cytosine to thymine resulting in a phenylalanine for serine substitution at residue 174 of the beta subunit was found. This result, together with results on the altered properties of F1 from KF11 reported previously, indicates that residue 174 is essential for the Mg2+-dependent ATPase activity of F1 but not for the Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2120586114,"The regulation of extramicrosomal Ca2+ concentration maintained by suspensions of rat insulinoma microsomes was studied using Ca2+-selective minielectrodes. The Ca2+-transporting activity was MgATP dependent and correlated with the endoplasmic reticulum marker NADPH-cytochrome c reductase. When incubated in a high KCl medium containing Mg2+ and phosphate, the microsomes lowered [Ca2+] within less than 10 min to around 0.2 microM. They had a high Ca2+-sequestering activity since they were able to take up and retain several small Ca2+ additions. No evidence for a Na+/Ca2+ countertransport was obtained. The accumulated Ca2+ was released by the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 or upon transforming ATP into ADP using glucose plus hexokinase. The addition of ADP, at concentrations present in cells, resulted in a dose-dependent and reversible net Ca2+ efflux from the microsomes until a higher [Ca2+] steady state was reached. This was specific for ADP since GDP, UDP, CDP, IDP, and the nonhydrolyzable analogue methylene-ADP as well as AMP and cAMP did not reproduce the effect. Insulin secretory granules were unable to lower medium [Ca2+] or to take up a pulse addition of Ca2+. However, most of the large granular calcium content was released by A23187. The addition of Na+ and lowering or increasing medium pH by 0.2 pH unit did not induce Ca2+ uptake or efflux from the secretory granules. The results indicate that insulinoma endoplasmic reticulum but not insulin secretory granules may play a critical role in the regulation of cytosolic Ca2+. A variation in cellular ADP content following secretagogue addition might modulate Ca2+ fluxes across the endoplasmic reticulum and contribute in raising cytosolic Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W63067915,"The second component of complement (C2), is a class III major histocompatibility complex gene product and a glycoprotein in the classical complement activating system. Synthesis in the human hepatoma-derived cell line HepG2 results in three intracellular forms: an 84-kDa form secreted in 1-2 h; 79-kDa and 70-kDa forms that remain cell-associated for intervals up to 12 h. All three forms are C2 polypeptides as demonstrated by inhibition of immunoprecipitation with unlabeled C2 and the presence of common major peptide fragments following chymotryptic digestion. The cell-associated forms of C2 are not products of proteolysis as demonstrated by experiments with multiple proteinase inhibitors and by observations of the kinetics of synthesis. Inhibition of core glycosylation by tunicamycin and deglycosylation by acid hydrolysis indicate that the three intracellular C2 polypeptides are glycosylated to a similar extent. Although the 84-kDa form of C2 is susceptible to C1s cleavage, the two cell-associated forms are not. Cell-free biosynthesis by mRNA from HepG2 or human liver results in three primary translation products corresponding to the three unglycosylated forms of C2. These results indicate that HepG2 cells synthesize C2 protein in both secreted and cell-associated forms and that each form is derived from a separate primary translation product."
https://openalex.org/W1572817411,"The ability of DNA repair enzymes to carry out excision repair of pyrimidine dimers in SV40 minichromosomes irradiated with 16 to 64 J/m2 of UV light was examined. Half of the dimers were substrate for the DNA glycosylase activity of phage T4 UV endonuclease immediately after irradiation, but this limit decreased to 27% after 2 h at 0 degrees C. Moreover, the apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease activity of the enzyme did not incise all of the AP sites created by glycosylase activity, although all AP sites were substrate for HeLa AP endonuclease II. The initial rate of the glycosylase was 40% that upon DNA. After incision by the T4 enzyme, excision was mediated by HeLa DNase V (acting with an exonuclease present in the chromatin preparation). Under physiological salt conditions, excision did not proceed appreciably beyond the damaged nucleotides in DNA or chromatin. With chromatin, about 70% of the accessible dimers were removed, but at a rate slower than for DNA. Finally, HeLa DNA polymerase beta was able to fill the short gaps created after dimer excision, and these patches were sealed by T4 DNA ligase. Overall, roughly 30% of the sites incised by the endonuclease were ultimately sealed by the ligase. The resistance of some sites was due to interference with the ligase by the chromatin structure, as only 30-40% of the nicks created in chromatin by pancreatic DNase could be sealed by T4 or HeLa DNA ligases. The overall excision repair process did not detectably disrupt the chromatin structure, since the repair label was recovered in Form I DNA present in 75 S condensed minichromosomes. Although other factors might stimulate the rate of this repair process, it appears that the enzymes utilized could carry out excision repair of chromatin to a limit near that observed at the initial rate in mammalian cells in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W114248912,"125I-labeled low density lipoprotein (LDL) binding to purified plasma membranes prepared from freshly isolated human adipocytes was saturable, specific, and displaceable by unlabeled ligand. The maximum specific binding capacity measured at saturating concentrations of 125I-LDL was 1.95 +/- 1.17 micrograms of LDL bound/mg of membrane protein (mean +/- S.D., n = 16). In contrast to cultured fibroblasts, specific binding of LDL to adipocyte membranes was calcium-independent, was not affected by EDTA or NaCl, and was not destroyed by pronase. Plasma membranes purified directly from homogenized adipose tissue also showed calcium-independent LDL specific binding (0.58 +/- 0.33 micrograms of LDL bound/mg of membrane protein, mean +/- S.D. n = 11). Specific binding, internalization, and degradation of 125I-methylated LDL was demonstrated in isolated adipocytes and competition experiments showed that native and methylated LDL interacted with adipocytes through some common recognition mechanism(s). Compared to native LDL, specific binding of methylated LDL to adipocyte membranes was significantly reduced (43%), indicating that interaction of LDL with adipocyte was dependent in part on the lysine residues of apolipoprotein B. LDL binding to adipocyte plasma membranes was also competitively inhibited by human high density lipoprotein subfractions HDL2 and HDL3. Thus, LDL metabolism in mature adipocytes appears to be regulated by mechanisms distinctly different from a variety of cultured mesenchymal cells. In addition, the ability of adipocytes to bind, internalize, and degrade significant amounts of methylated LDL supports the view that adipose tissue is involved in the metabolism of modified lipoproteins in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1481254609,"Abstract Endo.SceI which is isolated from cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a eukaryotic site-specific endonuclease active on double-stranded DNA. At each cleavage site, Endo.SceI cuts only a defined phosphodiester bond in each strand of the double helix. We compared nucleotide sequences around five cleavage sites for Endo.SceI using a computer. We could not find any common specific sequence consisting of five base pairs or more among them. However, we found a 26-base pair consensus sequence which included 15 conserved nucleotides, allowing any of the five sequences to include a few nucleotides deviated from the consensus sequence. The consensus sequence is 5'-CAn*PYnnAnnCYYGTTnnnPnYnnYA-3', where P, Y, n, and * denote purine, pyrimidine, any nucleotide, and the center of the cleavage site, respectively. The numbers of sites at which the consensus sequence appears in pBR322 DNA, phi X174 replicative form DNA, fd replicative form DNA, or SV40 DNA are close to those of the cleavage sites for Endo.SceI. We found that a 33-base pair fragment was efficiently cut at the defined phosphodiester bonds by Endo.SceI. This 33-base pair fragment included 25 base pairs out of the 26-base pair consensus sequence. The fragments in which a part of the consensus sequence was missing were not cut by Endo.SceI. These observations suggest that the consensus sequence described above is the major characteristic around the cleavage sites recognized by Endo.SceI and that the mode of recognition of cleavage sites by Endo.SceI is different from that by restriction endonucleases. We found homology between the consensus sequence for Endo.SceI and the sequences around the cleavage sites for two other site-specific endonucleases of S. cerevisiae: Endo.SceII and YZ-Endo which is involved in mating type switching."
https://openalex.org/W1511308217,"The enzymatic oxidation of the acetaminophen analogue 3',5'-dimethyl-4'-hydroxyacetanilide (3',5'-dimethylacetaminophen) with the horseradish peroxidase/hydrogen peroxide system forms a phenoxyl free radical metabolite. The structure of this free radical is established by a complete analysis of the ESR spectrum and confirmed by deuterium isotope substitution. Concomitant with phenoxyl radical formation, N-acetyl-3,5-dimethyl-p-benzoquinone imine was detected by optical spectroscopy. The free radical is also formed by comproportionation in solutions of the quinone imine containing added 3',5'-dimethylacetaminophen. In contrast to acetaminophen, the imine and radical metabolites are stable and can be detected without resort to rapid-mixing techniques. Factors leading to the increased stability of these metabolites relative to those formed from acetaminophen are discussed in terms of the toxicity of acetaminophen."
https://openalex.org/W1566046397,"We examined the subcellular localization of ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone)-induced changes in adrenal phospholipids using dexamethasone-treated rats. In adrenal mitochondrial fraction, ACTH significantly enhanced both concentrations and contents of phosphatidylinositol (37%), phosphatidylcholine (22%), and phosphatidylethanolamine (20%). Other mitochondrial phospholipids including cardiolipin did not change upon administration of ACTH. In adrenal plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, and peroxisomes, no increase in phospholipids was observed. The ACTH-induced increases in mitochondrial phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylethanolamine were specific to adrenal among tissues tested. These changes were observed specifically in cortical cells rather than medulla. Nonsteroidogenic ACTH fragments and related peptides were unable to induce the change in adrenal mitochondrial phospholipids. From the dose-response profile with ACTH, the changes in mitochondrial phospholipids were closely related to ACTH-dependent stimulation of steroidogenesis. Furthermore, in vitro treatment with cyclic AMP enhanced both concentrations and contents of mitochondrial phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylethanolamine similar to those by the in vivo administration of ACTH. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments revealed that the hormone-induced changes in mitochondrial phospholipids were sensitive to a protein-synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide. However, aminoglutethimide and cytochalasin B, which strongly inhibited the hormone-induced formation of corticosterone, did not affect the increases in mitochondrial phospholipids. These results suggest that the hormone-induced increases in these phospholipids occur between ACTH-mediated ribosomal protein synthesis and corticosterone formation."
https://openalex.org/W1480211327,"In unfractioned reticulocyte lysate, interaction of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2) with other components regulates the accessibility of phosphatases and kinases to phosphorylation sites on its alpha and beta subunits. Upon addition of eIF-2 phosphorylated on both alpha and beta subunits (eIF-2(alpha 32P, beta 32P) to lysate, the alpha subunit is rapidly dephosphorylated, but the beta subunit is not. In contrast, both sites are rapidly dephosphorylated by the purified phosphatase. The basis of this altered specificity appears to be the association of eIF-2 with other translational components rather than an alteration of the phosphatase. Formation of an eIF-2(alpha 32P,beta 32P) Met-tRNAi X GTP ternary complex prevents dephosphorylation of the beta subunit, but has no effect on the rate of alpha dephosphorylation. eIF-2B, a 280,000-dalton polypeptide complex required for GTP:GDP exchange, also protects the beta subunit phosphorylation site from the purified phosphatase. However, the dephosphorylation of eIF-2(alpha 32P) is inhibited by 75% while complexed with eIF-2B. The altered phosphatase specificity upon association of eIF-2 with eIF-2B also affects the access of protein kinases to these phosphorylation sites. In the eIF-2B X eIF-2 complex, the alpha subunit is phosphorylated at 30% the rate of free eIF-2. Under identical conditions, phosphorylation of eIF-2 beta can not be detected. These results illustrate the importance of substrate conformation and/or functional association with other components in determining the overall phosphorylation state allowed by alterations of kinase and phosphatase activities."
https://openalex.org/W1583527189,"The binding of [14C]dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) to soluble complex III from yeast mitochondria was examined under conditions which resulted in the inhibition of proton ejection but had a minimal effect on cytochrome c reductase activity. Incubation of the complex with 50-100 nmol of [14C]DCCD/nmol of cytochrome b at 12 degrees C did not result in any changes in the appearance of the high-molecular-weight subunits (I-V) after sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis, although a slight broadening of the three lowest molecular-weight subunits (VI-VIII) was observed. The [14C]DCCD was bound preferentially to subunit III (cytochrome b) and a wide band with an apparent low-molecular weight ranging from 8000 to 9000 to less than 2000 depending on the gel system used. Extraction of the [14C]DCCD-treated complex III with chloroform:methanol had no effect on subunit III but completely removed the low-molecular-weight radioactive band. Thin-layer chromatography of the chloroform:methanol extract revealed that the radioactive material extracted from the [14C]DCCD-treated complex III migrated with the same apparent RF as either free [14C]DCCD or cardiolipin. Amino acids were not detectable in an acid hydrolysate of the chloroform:methanol extract, suggesting the absence of protein. Digestion of the [14C]DCCD-treated complex III with either chymotrypsin or Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease resulted in the decrease of both staining intensity and labeling in subunit III but had no effect on the radioactivity in the low-molecular-weight material. These results confirm that DCCD binds preferentially to cytochrome b in complex III from yeast mitochondria and suggest that cytochrome b may play an important role in proton translocation at this site of the respiratory chain."

https://openalex.org/W1523111058,"Abstract The properties of the cAMP-dependent protein kinases in AtT20 mouse pituitary tumor cells were characterized by a combination of immunological and biochemical techniques. Ninety per cent of the total cAMP-dependent protein kinase was in the 40,000 X g supernatant fraction. Protein kinases I and II were immunoprecipitated with specific antisera directed against their regulatory subunits. The immunoprecipitated kinases bound [3H]cAMP and were catalytically active when incubated with [gamma-32P]ATP-Mg and protamine or histone H2B. Immunoprecipitated protein kinases I and II bound [3H]cAMP with apparent Kb values of 1.5 and 15 nM, respectively. Regulatory subunit concentrations in AtT20 cells were measured by immunoprecipitation of [3H]cAMP-R complexes. R-I and R-II levels were 2.7 and 3.0 pmol of [3H]cAMP binding activity per mg of cytosolic protein, respectively, however, the ratio of protein kinase II to protein kinase I was 2.5 indicating the presence of a significant amount of free R-I. This was confirmed by DEAE-cellulose chromatography and the isolation of immunoreactive R-I devoid of protein kinase activity. A significant amount of R-I also coeluted with protein kinase II when AtT20 cell extracts were subjected to DEAE-cellulose chromatography. In quantitative immunoprecipitation experiments, 0.1 microliter of anti-brain R-II serum complexed up to 0.5 pmol of the [3H]cAMP-binding activity of protein kinase II prepared from bovine and rat brain, and AtT20 cells while 2 microliter of anti-brain R-II serum was required to precipitate an equal amount of protein kinase II from bovine skeletal muscle showing that the protein kinase II in AtT20 cells contained the neural-specific R-II subunit."

In the dark, IAC inhibited the activity of (Na+K+)-ATPase in electroplax microsomes from Electrophorus electricus with the same I50 as cymarin. [125I]IAC binding, in the presence of Mg2+ and Pi, was specific, of high affinity (KD = 0.4 microM), and reversible (k-1 = 0.11 min-1) at 30 degrees C. At 0 degree C, the complex was stable for at least 3 h, thus permitting washing before photolysis. Analysis of [125]IAC photolabeled electroplax microsomes by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (7-14%) showed that most of the incorporated radioactivity was associated with the alpha (Mr = 98,000) and beta (Mr = 44,000) subunits of the (Na+K+)-ATPase (ratio of alpha to beta labeling = 2.5). A higher molecular weight peptide (100,000), similar in molecular weight to the brain alpha(+) subunit, and two lower molecular weight peptides (12,000-15,000), which may be proteolipid, were also labeled. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (isoelectric focusing then SDS-PAGE, 10%) resolved the beta subunit into 12 labeled peptides ranging in pI from 4.3 to 5.5. When (Na+K+)-ATPase in synaptosomes from monkey brain cortex was photolabeled and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (7-14%), specific labeling of the alpha(+), alpha, and beta subunits could be detected (ratio of alpha(+) plus alpha to beta labeling = 35). The results show that [125I]IAC is a sensitive probe of the cardiac glycoside binding site of (Na+K+)-ATPase and can be used to detect the presence of the alpha(+) subunit in crude membrane fractions from various sources."
https://openalex.org/W1576538068,"These studies concern the interactions of the rat liver thyroid hormone nuclear receptor with histones and factors influencing the receptor's assay and stability. Heating certain crude receptor preparations at 50 degrees C produces a selective loss of triiodothyronine (T3) but not thyroxine (T4) binding activity, whereas, with more purified preparations, such heating decreases both T3 and T4 binding. The selective T3-binding loss in crude preparations was found to be due to the simultaneous denaturation of the receptor's high-affinity hormone-binding activity for both T3 and T4 and generation of new low-affinity T4-binding sites. The fraction in which T4 binding can be activated could be separated from the receptors by Sephadex G-100 chromatography. Core histones stimulated both T3- and T4-binding activity of 6-fold-purified receptor preparations, and data from several different experimental approaches suggest that this stimulation is due to the capability of the core histones to prevent the receptor from binding to or being denatured by Sephadex G-25 assay columns. The core histones were also found to stabilize 500-fold-purified but not 6-fold-purified or crude receptor preparations. A number of other acidic or basic proteins had little or none of these stimulatory effects, whereas a few proteins (such as the insulin B chain and histone H1) did have activity, although it was less than that of the core histones. There were no significant differences between the purified core histone subfractions (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4). That core histones can interact with the thyroid hormone receptors was demonstrated more directly by the finding that the receptors bind to histone-Sepharose but not Sepharose or insulin- or ovalbumin-Sepharose columns and that this binding was blocked by core histones at concentrations suggestive of an affinity for the receptor-core histone interaction of around 3 microM at 0.15 M salt concentration. The results demonstrate the utility of the histones in the assay and stabilization of purified thyroid hormone receptors, but they fail to support our previous hypothesis of a receptor subunit where T3- but not T4-binding activity is regulated selectively by histones. However, the results indicate that histones may interact with the receptors with some degree of specificity, and they raise the possibility that the histones participate in the nuclear localization of the receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1526929051,"Previous attempts to clone the Escherichia coli polA+ gene onto a high copy number plasmid were unsuccessful. The apparent lethality of unregulated overproduction of DNA polymerase I can be eliminated by cutting at a BglII site 100 nucleotides upstream from the ATG start codon of the polA gene. This permitted the construction of plasmid pMP5 which contains both the coding sequence for DNA polymerase I and the lambda pL promoter for conditional control of polA gene expression. BglII cutting only damages but does not eliminate the polA promoter activity; the BglII site thus lies within the polA promoter region. Leakiness of the damaged polA promoter results in overproduction of DNA polymerase I even under conditions where pL is fully repressed. This overproduction is inhibitory of cell growth, as reflected in both growth rate and in the frequency of appearance of mutant plasmids which are nonproducers of DNA polymerase I. Transformation of plasmid pMP5 into E. coli N4830 yields strain ATL100 which under inducing conditions provides 138-fold amplification of DNA polymerase I. Optimization of growth and expression conditions are presented together with an optimized rapid polymerase purification scheme. In addition to providing a convenient source for preparation of DNA polymerase I, this work serves as the basis for a future detailed molecular genetic analysis of the polA gene product."

Treatment of the cells with the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) or dimethylbenzanthracene, at concentrations which do not affect cell growth or macromolecular synthesis, stimulates the production of hCG in these cells. The levels of alpha hCG-specific mRNA (mRNA alpha hCG) sequences in total poly(A)+ RNA isolated from control and drug-treated ChaGo cells are determined by the dot hybridization technique using 32P-labeled, cloned cDNA alpha hCG probe. A concentration-dependent increase in the levels of mRNA alpha hCG sequences in BaP or dimethylbenzanthracene-treated ChaGo cells has been observed. The increase in the level of mRNA alpha hCG sequences can be detected after treatment of the cells with either of the drugs for 24 h, and this level attains its maximum within 48-72 h following drug treatment. A comparative study of the restriction endonuclease (MspI/HpaII) digestion patterns of the control and BaP-treated cell DNA suggests that the internal residues of the -CCGG- sequences in the alpha hCG gene of untreated cells are highly methylated; whereas the internal C residues of the same MspI/HpaII recognition sequences in the alpha hCG gene are comparatively less methylated in BaP-treated cell DNA."

Equilibrium constants measured at several temperatures from -20 degrees C to 0 degrees C exhibited an apparent van't Hoff relationship yielding thermodynamic values of delta Ho = -1.3 X 10(3) +/- 0.9 X 10(3) J/mol (-3.1 X 10(2) +/- 2 X 10(2) cal/mol), delta So = -3 +/- 3 J/K X mol (-0.6 +/- 0.8 cal/K X mol). The equilibrium constant for cyanate binding at 25 degrees C and pH 7.4 is 1.21 which is approximately 2 to 3 orders of magnitude lower than that observed for cyanate binding to methemoglobin and metmyoglobin. Krel, the ratio of the hemoprotein to model heme octapeptide binding constants, for NCO- is smaller than Krel for N3- suggesting that hydrogen bonding between the terminal ligand atoms and the distal histidine in hemoglobin and myoglobin does not contribute to the increased protein ligand stabilization observed for these anions relative to the model. A donor-acceptor interaction between the distal histidine and the electrophilic middle atoms of these bound ligands is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1489957489,"Three proteins of the inner mitochondrial membrane of Neurospora crassa were found to be covalently modified with a derivative of pantothenic acid. One of these proteins is a subunit of cytochrome c oxidase and two are subunits of the ATPase-ATP synthase. Cells of a pantothenate auxotroph of N. crassa were labeled with [14C]pantothenic acid, and mitochondrial proteins containing radiolabeled pantothenate were detected by electrophoresis of detergent-solubilized mitochondria. Mitochondria from cells that were colabeled with [14C]pantothenate and [3H]leucine were reacted with specific antisera against the cytochrome c oxidase and F1-ATPase enzyme complexes. Electrophoresis of the labeled subunits of these isolated complexes showed that the [14C]pantothenate-associated peptides corresponded to [3H]leucine-labeled subunit 6 of cytochrome c oxidase and two [3H]leucine-labeled subunits (tentatively identified as subunits 8 and 11) of the ATPase-ATP synthase. Pantothenate modification of these enzyme subunits, which are synthesized on extramitochondrial ribosomes, may contribute to their transport and assembly into mitochondria, or it may participate in the catalytic activity of the assembled enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1593294019,"RNA polymerase III promoters were constructed by cloning chemically synthesized double-stranded analogues of the box A and box B consensus sequences into suitable vectors. In contrast to approaches adopted previously for the analysis of RNA polymerase III promoters, this method has no limitation on the structure and number of variants generated and allows critical sequences in various permutations to be studied. Furthermore, the series of synthetic polymerase III promoters created constitute a collection of point mutation variants and hence provide a powerful tool for the analysis of nucleotides essential for promoter function. The results demonstrate that these two boxes, when separated by 51 base pairs, are sufficient to direct efficient transcription and that substitution of certain nucleotides causes reduced template activity."
https://openalex.org/W1480589022,"Mitochondria prepared from the livers of guinea pig, chicken, and pigeon all actively synthesize phosphoenolpyruvate from oxalacetate and GTP, utilizing phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. It was previously shown (Wilson, D. F., Erecinska, M., and Schramm, V. L. (1983). J. Biol. Chem. 258, 10464-10473) that phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase is freely reversible and that, in conjunction with nucleoside diphosphate kinase and malate dehydrogenase, which are also present in the mitochondria, it can be used to measure the intramitochondrial [ATPfree]/[ADPfree]. In this study, synthesis of phosphoenolpyruvate by guinea pig liver mitochondria was studied under conditions for which the only source of GTP was extramitochondrial ATP via adenine nucleotide translocase and nucleoside diphosphate kinase (the mitochondria were treated with rotenone, oligomycin, uncoupler, and fluorocitrate). When the extramitochondrial [ATP]/[ADP] was greater than the intramitochondrial [ATPfree]/[ADPfree] calculated from the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase reaction, there was net synthesis of phosphoenolpyruvate, but when it was less, there was net disappearance of phosphoenolpyruvate. Thus, the intramitochondrial [ATPfree]/[ADPfree] was equal to the extramitochondrial value at the point of reversal of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase reaction. This equality of the intra- and extramitochondrial adenine nucleotide ratios occurred with a measured mitochondrial membrane potential of approximately -36 mV, whereas in the previous experiments, equality was observed for conditions in which the measured membrane potential was -111 to -125 mV. Thus, adenine nucleotide translocation was not dependent on the transmembrane electrical potential and must, therefore, have occurred by electroneutral exchange."
