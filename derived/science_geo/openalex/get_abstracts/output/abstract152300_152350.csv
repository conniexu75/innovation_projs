https://openalex.org/W2145124208,"Maillard or browning reactions lead to formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) on protein and contribute to the increase in chemical modification of proteins during aging and in diabetes. AGE inhibitors such as aminoguanidine and pyridoxamine (PM) have proven effective in animal model and clinical studies as inhibitors of AGE formation and development of diabetic complications. We report here that PM also inhibits the chemical modification of proteins during lipid peroxidation (lipoxidation) reactions in vitro, and we show that it traps reactive intermediates formed during lipid peroxidation. In reactions of arachidonate with the model protein RNase, PM prevented modification of lysine residues and formation of the advanced lipoxidation end products (ALEs)N ε-(carboxymethyl)lysine,N ε-(carboxyethyl)lysine, malondialdehyde-lysine, and 4-hydroxynonenal-lysine. PM also inhibited lysine modification and formation of ALEs during copper-catalyzed oxidation of low density lipoprotein. Hexanoic acid amide and nonanedioic acid monoamide derivatives of PM were identified as major products formed during oxidation of linoleic acid in the presence of PM. We propose a mechanism for formation of these products from the 9- and 13-oxo-decadienoic acid intermediates formed during peroxidation of linoleic acid. PM, as a potent inhibitor of both AGE and ALE formation, may prove useful for limiting the increased chemical modification of tissue proteins and associated pathology in aging and chronic diseases, including both diabetes and atherosclerosis.

Although AGE inhibitors vary widely in structure, they are all nucleophilic compounds and are thought to function by trapping reactive carbonyl intermediates in AGE formation. Because they are relatively nonspecific nucleophiles, AGE inhibitors also affect other oxidative chemistry, e.g. the formation of ALEs. Aminoguanidine, for example, inhibits chemical modification of proteins during lipid peroxidation reactions (14.Requena J.R. Vidal P. Cabezas-Cerrato J. Diabetes Res. 1992; 20: 43-49PubMed Google Scholar) and inhibits metal-catalyzed oxidation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) and uptake of oxidized LDL into macrophages via the scavenger receptor (15.Picard S.

In animal model studies, PM also inhibited AGE formation and retarded the development of nephropathy in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. 2T. P. Degenhardt, N. L. Alderson, D. D. Arrington, R. J.

Baynes, submitted for publication.However, the renal protection was accompanied by a significant reduction in hypertriglyceridemia, and there were strong correlations between plasma triglyceride concentration and the levels of CML and CEL, fluorescence, and cross-links in skin collagen. These observations suggested that, in addition to its AGE-inhibitory activity, PM might also affect lipid homeostasis and lipid-dependent chemical modification of protein in vivo. In this paper we describe experiments in vitro on the effects of PM on the chemical modification of proteins during lipid peroxidation reactions, and we show that PM is a potent inhibitor of modification of lysine by peroxidizing lipids, both in a model protein-lipid system and during copper-catalyzed oxidation of LDL. We also identify the major products formed on reaction of linoleic acid (LA) with PM under autoxidative conditions, the hexanoic acid amide and nonanedioic acid monoamide derivatives of PM, and we propose a mechanism for PM inhibition of chemical modification of proteins during lipoxidation reactions. Our results provide insight into the mechanism of action of PM as an AGE and ALE inhibitor, and we suggest that PM may be useful for inhibiting the increased chemical modification of tissue proteins, whether derived from carbohydrate or lipids, in diabetes, atherosclerosis, and other chronic diseases. Arachidonic acid (AA), LA, oleic acid, palmitic acid, PM·(HCl)2, pyridoxal·(HCl), pyridoxine·(HCl), ribonuclease A (type II-A from bovine pancreas; RNase), diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), phytic acid, butylated hydroxytoluene, NaBH4, hexanoyl (caproyl) chloride, methyl linoleate, and nonanedioic (azelaic) acid monomethyl ester were purchased from Sigma. Boron trichloride-methanol was purchased from Pierce and heptafluorobutyric acid from Acros Chemicals (Atlanta, GA). [2H4]- and [2H8]lysine were from Isotec (Miamisburg, OH). Deuterated and natural abundance internal standards (CML and [2H4]CML, CEL and [2H4]CEL, MDA-Lys and [2H8]MDA-Lys, and HNE-Lys and [2H4]HNE-Lys) were prepared as described previously (5.Requena J.R.

PM (1 mm) was incubated with AA, LA, or oleic acid (5 mm) in 5 ml of filter-sterilized 200 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, in 20-ml scintillation vials for 6 days at 37 °C in a shaking water bath. Reactions were initially biphasic but, in the case of the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) AA and LA, became monophasic by day 3. Aliquots were removed from the aqueous phase and stored at −20 °C until analyzed. Modification of the free amino group of PM was measured by the trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) assay (20.Spadaro A.C. Draghetta W. Del Lama S.N. Camargo A.C. Greene L.J. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 96: 317-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), using PM as standard. Reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatographic analysis of the samples was carried out on a Waters (Milford, MA) HPLC system, using a Supelco (Bellefonte, PA) C-18 column (4.6 mm × 25 cm). The gradient (flow rate = 1 ml/min; solvent A = 0.1% aqueous heptafluorobutyric acid and solvent B = acetonitrile) was as follows: 0–2 min, 100% A; 2–20 min, linear gradient to 60% B; hold 10 min; 30–31 min, linear gradient to 75% B; hold 10 min; 41–42 min, linear gradient to 100% A, hold 13 min to re-equilibrate column. PM and derivatives were detected by fluorescence at E x = 328 nm andE m = 393 nm and were quantified by absorbance detection at 294 nm. LA (5 mm) was oxidized alone or in the presence of PM (1 mm), as described above. Individual reaction vessels were removed at various times (0, 1, 3, and 6 days); DTPA was added (final concentration = 1 mm from 100 mm stock), and the samples were then stored at −20 °C until analyzed. Aliquots of well mixed reaction mixtures were removed for measurement of thiobarbituric acid reacting substances (TBARs), as described by Sawicki et al. (21.Sawicki E. Stanley T.W. Johnson H. Anal. Chem. 1963; 35: 199-203Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar), using MDA as external standard. For measurement of residual LA, butylated hydroxytoluene (antioxidant, 0.01%) and palmitate (internal standard, 5 mm) were added, and then the lipids were extracted with CHCl3:CH3OH (2:1), as described by Folch et al. (22.Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the organic layer was driedin vacuo. Linoleate was converted to methyl linoleate using 0.5 ml of boron trichloride:methanol heated at 65 °C for 1 h. The derivatizing agent was evaporated under nitrogen, and the methyl esters were extracted with hexane:water (3:1, v/v). The organic layer was dried under nitrogen, reconstituted in 0.15 ml of CH2Cl2, and analyzed by selected ion monitoring-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (SIM-GC/MS) (see below) using ions 294 and 220 for methyl linoleate and methyl palmitate, respectively. RNase (1 mm, 13.7 mg/ml; equivalent to 10 mm lysine concentration) was reacted with AA (100 mm) in the absence or presence of PM (1 mm) in 5 ml of 0.2 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The reactions were prepared under sterile conditions, using ultrafiltered solutions. Aliquots were removed at 0, 1, 3, and 6 days, DTPA was added (final concentration = 1 mm), and the samples were frozen at −20 °C. Aliquots (∼1 mg of protein) were extracted with CHCl3:CH3OH, according to Folch (22.Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the lower organic phase was removed. The upper aqueous phase and interfacial protein were reduced by addition of a 5-fold excess of NaBH4 over lipid in 0.1 m borate buffer, pH 9, for 4 h at room temperature. The samples were then transferred to dialysis tubing (6,000–8,000 molecular weight cut-off) and dialyzed against 100 volumes of deionized water for 24 h at 4 °C with several water changes. An aliquot of the dialysate, equivalent to ∼100 μg of protein, was removed, diluted with an equal volume of concentrated HCl, and hydrolyzed (110 °C for 24 h) for amino acid analysis. Modification of lysine residues was measured by amino acid analysis, conducted by cation-exchange chromatography, using post-column derivatization witho-phthalaldehyde and fluorescence detection. For analysis of lipoxidation products, the remainder of the sample was dried in vacuo, deuterated internal standards ([2H8]Lys, [2H4]CML, [2H4]CEL, [2H8]MDA-Lys, and [2H4]HNE-Lys) were added, and the sample was hydrolyzed in 6 n HCl, as above. The hydrolysate was driedin vacuo, reconstituted in 1 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and applied to a 1-ml C-18 Sep-Pak (Waters Associates, Milford, MA) equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The flow-through fraction from the column was collected, and the column was washed with 3 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid containing 20% methanol. The eluate was pooled with the flow-through fraction, dried in vacuo, and the amino acids then derivatized as theirN,O-trifluoroacetyl methyl esters and analyzed by selected ion monitoring (SIM)-GC/MS, as described previously (5.Requena J.R.

LDL was isolated from plasma of healthy donors by single-vertical spin centrifugation and used within 24–48 h of preparation, as described previously (18.Fu M.-X. Requena J.R. Jenkins A.J. Lyons T.J. Baynes J.W. Thorpe S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9982-9986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). LDL (50 μg of protein/ml) was incubated at 37 °C in phosphate-buffered saline alone or in the presence of 5 μm CuCl2 or 5 μm CuCl2 plus PM (100–250 μm). Formation of conjugated dienes, an index of lipid peroxidation, was monitored at 234 nm. Aliquots corresponding to ∼1 mg of LDL protein were removed at various times, reduced with NaBH4, and hydrolyzed for amino acid analysis and measurement of ALEs, as described previously (18.Fu M.-X.

N-Hexanoyl-pyridoxamine was synthesized from PM·(HCl)2 and hexanoyl chloride. PM (20 mg) was dissolved in 50 ml of 2 m NaOH in a 250-ml round bottom flask. Hexanoyl chloride (22 mg in 30 ml of dry ether) was added dropwise over an hour while the reaction was kept on ice and stirred vigorously. The reaction was stirred for an additional 2 h and then the ether layer was removed and dried under nitrogen, yielding a white powder. N-Hexanoyl-PM was identified and isolated by RP-HPLC with detection by absorbance and electrospray ionization/mass spectrometry (ESI-LC/MS), as described below. N-Nonanedioyl-pyridoxamine was synthesized according to D'Alelio and Reid (23.D'Alelio G.F. Reid E.E. J. Org. Chem. 1937; 59: 111-112Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.3 g of PM in 0.3 ml of deionized water was added to 0.3 g of azelaic acid monomethyl ester and heated at 140 °C for 10 h. The brown reaction mixture was dried in vacuo and reconstituted in deionized water:acetonitrile (1:1, v/v). N-Nonanedioyl-PM was identified and isolated by RP-HPLC with detection by absorbance and ESI-LC/MS, as described below. N-Acyl-PM derivatives were hydrolyzed in 2 m HCl for 4 h at 95 °C, releasing free PM and carboxylic acids. The hydrolysate was dried in vacuo, and the resulting free carboxylic acids (hexanoic and nonanedioic acids) were analyzed by GC/MS as their propyl and dimethyl esters, respectively. Esterification was performed in 1 ml of 1 m HCl in n-propyl alcohol or methanol at 65 °C for 1 h. After drying in vacuo, the esters were extracted into 2 ml of hexane:water (2:1, v/v). Following vortexing and centrifugation, the hexane phase was analyzed by GC/MS, as described below. The aqueous phase, containing PM, was dried in vacuo, and the PM was acetylated by reaction with acetic anhydride:pyridine (1:1, v/v) for 2 h at room temperature. Following evaporation in vacuo, the product was reconstituted in methylene chloride for GC/MS analysis. ESI-LC-MS was carried out in the positive ion mode on a VG (Manchester, UK) Trio-3 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a Hewlett-Packard (Palo Alto, CA) series 1100 HPLC system and a Keystone (Bellefonte, PA) Aquasil C-18 microbore column. The solvent system consisted of 0.1% heptafluorobutyric acid (solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B), flow rate 0.05 ml/min. The gradient used was as follows: 100% A, hold for 2 min; 6 min ramp to 60% B, hold for 4 min; 3 min ramp to 75% B, hold for 10 min. GC/MS was carried out on a Hewlett-Packard model 6890 gas chromatograph/5970 mass selective detector, using a 30-meter HP-5MS (5% phenyl methyl siloxane) capillary column (Restek, Bellefonte, PA). The temperature program for analyses of PM and carboxylic acid esters was as follows: initial temperature 75 °C, 6 °C/min ramp to 110 °C, 10 °C/min ramp to 180 °C hold 5 min, 12 °C/min ramp to 270 °C/min, hold 5 min. Fast atom bombardment-MS was performed on a VG (Manchester, UK) 70 SQ high resolution, magnetic sector mass spectrometer. To study the interaction of PM with products of lipid peroxidation, PM was incubated with oleate or PUFA in phosphate buffer at physiological pH, relying on endogenous metal ions in the phosphate buffer to catalyze PUFA oxidation. As shown in Fig.1 A, PM incubated alone or in the presence of oleate was recovered unchanged over the 6-day incubation period. However, in the presence of LA and AA, PM was gradually consumed, with ∼60% PM loss at 6 days, based on HPLC analysis (see inset to Fig. 4). When the same samples were analyzed by the TNBS assay (Fig. 1 B), ∼60% of the free amino groups of PM was also modified during peroxidation of PUFA. The close agreement between the loss of PM by HPLC and the loss of amino groups by the TNBS reaction suggested that PM was reacting with products of lipid peroxidation via its benzylic amino group. PUFA were also solubilized at similar rates in the presence and absence of PM, and as shown in Fig. 2, the kinetics of formation and yield of TBARs and the rate of loss of LA, the primary PUFA in LDL (see below), were only slightly affected by the presence of PM in reaction mixtures at 1 mm concentration. These experiments indicate that PM, at the concentration used (1 mm) in the above experiment, did not prevent lipid peroxidation by chelation or antioxidant activity.Figure 4Pyridoxamine is consumed during inhibition of chemical modification of RNase by arachidonate. RNase was incubated with arachidonate and PM (1 mm) as described in the legend to Fig. 3. Aliquots were removed at various times and assayed for residual PM by HPLC (inset). Pyridoxal (PL) was added as an internal standard. Data are means ± S.D. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 2Pyridoxamine has minimal effect on the kinetics of oxidation of linoleate. Linoleate (5 mm) was incubated alone (▴) or in the presence of PM (1 mm) (Δ) in 200 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 6 days at 37 °C. Aliquots removed at various times were analyzed for reactivity in the TBAR assay expressed as nmol MDA equivalents (A) and residual linoleate by GC/MS (B). Data are means ± S.D. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The activity of PM as an inhibitor of lipoxidative modification of proteins was studied in reactions of AA with RNase. As shown in Fig.3, CML, CEL, MDA-Lys, and HNE-Lys were formed continuously on RNase during the incubation with AA. These studies confirm previous reports on the formation of CML during lipid peroxidation reactions (18.Fu M.-X. Requena J.R. Jenkins A.J. Lyons T.J. Baynes J.W. Thorpe S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9982-9986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar) and also identify CEL as a product of arachidonate oxidation. The decline in MDA-Lys recovered after 1 day resembles that observed during copper oxidation of LDL and is thought to result from further reaction of MDA-Lys to form other products, such as Lys-MDA-Lys (5.Requena J.R. Fu M.-X. Ahmed M.U. Jenkins A.J. Lyons T.J. Baynes J.W. Thorpe S.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Addition of 1 mm PM to the AA + RNase mixture resulted in almost complete inhibition of formation of all the ALEs. Notably, PM provided potent protection against lipoxidative modification of RNase, although it was present at only 1% the concentration of AA, and 10% the concentration of lysine residues in RNase. The small increase in formation of lipoxidation products by day 6 likely reflects the fact that all of the PM had been consumed by that time, as shown in Fig. 4. Amino acid analysis indicated that there was a progressive loss of lysine during the reaction, with about 58% of lysine residues lost at the end of 6 days in the absence of PM (Fig. 5). In contrast, inclusion of PM in the incubation resulted in loss of only about 5% of lysine residues by day 6.Figure 5Pyridoxamine inhibits lysine modification during oxidation of arachidonate in the presence of RNase. Aliquots of the reaction mixture described in the legend to Fig. 3 were analyzed by amino acid analysis for their lysine content; data are expressed relative to lysine content of native RNase. Data are means ± S.D. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because PM inhibited lipoxidation product formation in the AA + RNase system, we also evaluated its effectiveness as an inhibitor of lipoxidation during copper-catalyzed oxidation of LDL, a common in vitro model for studies on lipoxidative modification of proteins. PM was used at concentrations of 100 and 250 μm concentrations, comparable to the ∼120 μm concentration achieved in rats treated with 1 g/liter in drinking water.2,3 At these concentrations, PM caused a 2–3-fold increase in the lag phase of LDL oxidation and an ∼20% decrease in absorbance at 234 nm during the later plateau phase of the reaction (Fig.6 A). Confirming the results of experiments with AA and RNase, PM was an effective inhibitor of formation of CML, CEL, MDA-Lys, and HNE-Lys (Fig. 6 B.) during metal-catalyzed oxidation of LDL. The relative yields of the ALEs during oxidation of LDL differed significantly from yields obtained in reactions of AA with RNase, probably reflecting the heterogeneous fatty acid composition of LDL. PM was more effective in limiting formation of CML and CEL, compared with MDA-Lys and HNE-Lys (Fig. 6 B), but was a potent inhibitor of the overall modification of lysine residues in oxidized LDL (Fig.6 C), with only 6% loss in the presence of PM compared with 29% in its absence. To identify products trapped by PM during PUFA oxidation, we studied the reaction of PM (1 mm) with LA, the primary PUFA in LDL. HPLC analyses of the LA + PM reaction, described in Fig. 7, indicated formation of products with fluorescence (Fig. 7, B versus A) and absorbance (Fig. 7 C) maxima characteristic of PM. The consumption of PM over a period of 6 days of reaction is evident, as well as the time-dependent formation of new products eluting later than PM, indicating that these adducts were more hydrophobic than PM itself. Two major fluorescent products were consistently observed, eluting at ∼24 min. Based on their fluorescence intensity, these two products accounted for ≤10% of the PM in the starting reaction, whereas ∼65% of the starting PM was consumed by 6 days (Fig. 1). The fluorescence of the total reaction mixture was also measured at 6 days, to establish that fluorescent reaction products were not binding irreversibly to the C-18 column. These measurements confirmed a significant ∼50% decrease in fluorescence during the reaction, consistent with the overall loss of fluorescence observed in the HPLC analyses in Fig. 7 C. This observation suggested that the PM derivatives were less fluorescent than PM itself. Semi-preparative RP-HPLC analysis (Fig. 7 C) showed that a number of additional products with absorbance maxima at 294 nm were also detected after 6 days of reaction. Those eluting after about 23 min (indicated by an asterisk) had absorbance maxima below 260 nm and were also formed from LA, in the absence of PM. However, products eluting between 19 and 22 min had extracted absorbance maxima at 294 nm (photodiode array detector), consistent with the presence of the intact pyridine ring. The peaks eluting in this region of the chromatogram were pooled and subjected to direct injection ESI-MS. Major products identified had m/z values of 267, 305, 339, 377, and 479 (Fig. 8 A); none of these were present in incubations of LA or PM alone. Assignment of the various species to particular chromatographic peaks was accomplished by collecting individual peaks by semi-preparative RP-HPLC (Fig. 8 B) and analysis by direct injection ESI-MS. Once peak assignments were made, the kinetics of formation of the three most abundant products (267, 305, and 339) were determined by RP-HPLC (Fig.8 C). The yields of all three compounds increased with time, with products 267 and 339 consistently forming in the highest yields. These products were chosen for further characterization. Products 267 and 339 were identified as the hexanoic acid amide and nonanedioic (azelaic) acid monoamide derivatives of PM (24.Onorato J.M. Mechanism of Action of Pyridoxamine, an Inhibitor of Lipoxidation Reactions. Ph.D. thesis. University of South Carolina, 1999Google Scholar). The hexanoic acid amide derivative of lysine has been identified previously by Kato et al. (25.Kato Y. Mori Y. Makino Y. Morimitsu Y. Hiroi S. Ishikawa T. Osawa T. J. Biol.

It reduces arsenate to arsenite, which is then extruded from cells by Acr3p. In this study, we demonstrate that ACR2complemented the arsenate-sensitive phenotype of an arsCdeletion in Escherichia coli. ACR2 was cloned into a bacterial expression vector and expressed in E. coli as a C-terminally histidine-tagged protein that was purified by sequential metal chelate affinity and gel filtration chromatography. Acr2p purified as a homodimer of 34 kDa. The purified protein was shown to catalyze the reduction of arsenate to arsenite. Enzymatic activity as a function of arsenate concentration exhibited an apparent positive cooperativity with an apparent Hill coefficient of 2.7. Activity required GSH and glutaredoxin as the source of reducing equivalents. Thioredoxin was unable to support arsenate reduction. However, glutaredoxins from both S. cerevisiae and E. coli were able to serve as reductants. Analysis ofgrx mutants lacking one or both cysteine residues in the Cys-Pro-Tyr-Cys active site demonstrated that only the N-terminal cysteine residue is essential for arsenate reductase activity. This suggests that during the catalytic cycle, Acr2p forms a mixed disulfide with GSH before being reduced by glutaredoxin to regenerate the active Acr2p reductase.

Arsenic is a human carcinogen (2.Hayes R.B. Cancer Causes Control. 1997; 8: 371-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) that is frequently present in high concentrations in drinking water (3.Smith A.H. Hopenhayn-Rich C. Bates M.N.

Despite the health hazards of arsenic, no specific human arsenic detoxification genes have been identified. Recently a gene cluster,ACR1, ACR2, and ACR3, onSaccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome XVI, was shown to confer resistance to arsenate (As(V)) and arsenite (As(III)), the first such eukaryotic genes to be identified (4.Bobrowicz P. Wysocki R. Owsianik G. Goffeau A. Ulaszewski S. Yeast. 1997; 13: 819-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Acr3p catalyzes extrusion of the arsenite from cells, thus conferring resistance (5.Ghosh M. Shen J. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5001-5006Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). However, to confer resistance to arsenate, cells must first reduce it to arsenite. Although arsenate is nonenzymatically reduced by GSH, the process is too slow to be biologically significant (6.Delnomdedieu M. Basti M.M. Otvos J.D. Thomas D.J. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1994; 90: 139-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), necessitating enzymatic mechanisms for reduction. Several bacterial arsenate reductases have been identified (7.Ji G. Garber E.A.E. Armes L.G. Chen C.M. Fuchs J.A. Silver S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7294-7299Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 8.Oden K.L. Gladysheva T.B. Rosen B.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), but until recently, there were no known eukaryotic arsenate reductases. The S. cerevisiae ACR2 gene was shown to be required for high level arsenate resistance (4.Bobrowicz P. Wysocki R. Owsianik G. Goffeau A. Ulaszewski S. Yeast. 1997; 13: 819-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), and disruption of ACR2resulted in arsenate sensitivity (9.Mukhopadhyay R. Rosen B.P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 168: 127-136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The product of theACR2 gene, the 130-residue Acr2p, is a member of a family of proteins that are totally unrelated to any bacterial arsenate reductases. Two S. cerevisiae homologues of Acr2p areYGR203W, a 148-residue protein of unknown function (GenBankTM accession number S0003435), andYMR036C (GenBankTM accession number S0004639), a member of the Cdc25A family of protein phosphotyrosyl phosphatases (10.Fauman E.B. Cogswell J.P. Lovejoy B. Rocque W.J. Holmes W. Montana V.G. Piwnica-Worms H. Rink M.J. Saper M.A. Cell. 1998; 93: 617-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). These three proteins have the consensus sequence HCX 5R, which corresponds to the phosphatase active site (11.Fauman E.B. Saper M.A. Trends Biochem Sci. 1996; 21: 413-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). This suggests that some commonality may exist in the enzymatic mechanism of an arsenate reductase and a phosphatase, both of which have oxyanionic substrates. We have previously shown that ACR2-disrupted yeast cells are sensitive to arsenate but resistant to arsenite (9.Mukhopadhyay R. Rosen B.P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 168: 127-136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the same phenotype an arsC deletion produces in E. coli (8.Oden K.L. Gladysheva T.B. Rosen B.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Native Acr2p produced in E. coli was found exclusively in inclusion bodies. In contrast, a maltose-binding protein-Acr2p chimera was soluble and exhibited a low level of arsenate reductase activity when supplemented with yeast cytosol. However, the activity was low, and the source of reducing equivalents unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that the S. cerevisiae ACR2gene conferred arsenate resistance in an arsenate-sensitive strainE. coli. Conditions were established to isolate and purify a six-histidine-tagged Acr2p from E. coli cytosol. The enzyme was shown to have the mass of a homodimer. The source of reducing equivalents was identified as GSH and glutaredoxin (Grx).1 Acr2p exhibited arsenate reductase activity when the S. cerevisiaeglutaredoxin Grx1p and GSH were supplied as electron donors. TheS. cerevisiae thioredoxin (Trx) was unable to substitute for Grx. In addition, any of the three E. coli glutaredoxins supported Acr2p-catalyzed arsenate reduction. Glutaredoxins have the active site Cys-Pro-Tyr-Cys. The N-terminal cysteine is required for both protein disulfide reduction and reduction of mixed protein-glutathione disulfides (12.Bushweller J.H. Åslund F. Wuthrich K. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9288-9293Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The other cysteine residue is required for the former activity but not for the latter. Mutation of the codon for the C-terminal cysteine of the E. coliglutaredoxin Grx2 had no effect on Acr2p activity. In contrast, a cysteine-to-serine substitution in the N-terminal residue rendered Grx2 incapable of serving as a reductant to Acr2p-catalyzed arsenate reduction. These results indicate that a mixed Acr2p-SG disulfide is formed during the catalytic cycle. This report provides the first characterization of the enzymatic activity of a eukaryotic arsenate reductase. Strains and plasmids used in this study are described in Table I. Cells of E. coli were grown in a low phosphate medium (8.Oden K.L. Gladysheva T.B. Rosen B.P. Mol.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Either Qiaprep Spin miniprep kit or Qiaquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen) was used to prepare plasmid DNA for restriction enzyme digestion, sequencing, and recovering DNA fragments from low melting point agarose gels. The sequence of each polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product was confirmed by DNA sequencing of the entire gene. Sequencing was performed using a Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Cy5 labeled autosequence kit and an ALFexpress apparatus by the method of Sanger et al. (15.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl.

The ACR2 gene from S. cerevisiae strain W303–1B genomic DNA was amplified by PCR to introduce a NcoI site at the 5′ end and aHindIII site at the 3′ end. The forward primer was 5′-CCATGGTAAGTTTCATAACGTC-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-AAGCTTACCACTAACAATCAATTTAAGG-3′. A 30-cycle PCR (94 °C for 0.5 min, 55 °C for 0.5 min, and 72 °C for 1 min) was run with yeast genomic DNA. The 396-bp amplified product was cloned into pGEM-T. The resulting construct was digested with NcoI andHindIII and inserted into theNcoI-HindIII sites of pBAD/Myc-HisA in frame with the C-terminal Myc epitope and a six-histidine-residue tag, creating plasmid pBAD-ACR2. The GRX1 gene from S. cerevisiae strain W303–1B genomic DNA was amplified by PCR to introduce a NcoI site at the 5′ end and an EcoRI site at the 3′ end. The forward primer was 5′-CCATGGTATCTCAAGAAACTATC-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-GAATTCATTTGCAAGAATAGGTTCTAAC-3′. A 30-cycle PCR (94 °C for 1.0 min, 55 °C for 0.5 min, and 72 °C for 1.2 min) was run with yeast genomic DNA. The 330-bp amplified fragment was cloned into pGEM-T. The resulting plasmid was digested with NcoI andEcoRI and inserted into the NcoI-EcoRI sites of pBAD/Myc-HisC in frame with the C-terminal Myc epitope and a six-histidine-residue tag, creating plasmid pBAD-YGRX1. A 2.4-kilobase pair fragment of yeast genomic DNA containingYGR203W was amplified by PCR using a forward primer, 5′-CTCATTGTCCTGCTCTTC-3′, that hybridizes with a region 614 bp upstream of YGR203W and a reverse primer, 5′-CTTGTAATGTCCGTACAGC-3′, that hybridizes to a region 1318 bp downstream of the gene. The fragment was ligated into vector pGEM-T, creating pGEM-YGR. The resulting plasmid was digested with HindIII andSphI, which cut 533 bp upstream and 278 bp downstream ofYGR203W, respectively. The resulting 1257-bp fragment was then ligated to HindIII-SphI-digested yEP352, a multicopy yeast-E. coli shuttle vector, creating plasmid yEP-PYGR. The thioredoxin gene TRX1 from S. cerevisiaestrain W303–1B genomic DNA was amplified by PCR to introduce aNcoI site at the 5′ end and a HindIII site at the 3′ end. The forward primer was 5′-CCATGGTTACTCAATTCAAAACTGC-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-AAGCTTAGCATTAGCAGCAATGGCTTGC-3′. A 30-cycle PCR (94 °C for 1.5 min, 55 °C for 0.5 min, and 72 °C for 2.5 min) was run with yeast genomic DNA. The 318-bp amplified product was cloned into p-GEM-T, and the resulting plasmid was digested with NcoI and HindIII and inserted into theNcoI and HindIII sites of pBAD/Myc-HisA, in-frame with the C-terminal Myc epitope and a six-histidine-residue tag, creating plasmid pBAD-YTRX1. The thioredoxin reductase (Trr) gene TRR1 from S. cerevisiae strain W303–1B genomic DNA was amplified by PCR to introduce a NcoI site at the 5′ end and a EcoRI site at the 3′ end. The forward primer was 5′-CCATGGTTCACAACAAAGTTAC-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-GAATTCTTCTAGGGAAGTTAAGTATTTC-3′. A 30-cycle PCR (94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 0.5 min, and 72 °C for 1.2 min) was run with yeast genomic DNA. The 966-bp amplified product was cloned into p-GEM-T, and the resulting plasmid was digested with NcoI andEcoRI and inserted into the NcoI-EcoRI sites of pBAD/Myc-HisC, in frame with the C-terminal Myc epitope and a six-histidine-residue tag, creating plasmid pBAD-YTRR1. Disruption ofYGR203W was carried out by a one-step method (16.Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2033) Google Scholar). Plasmid pGEM-YGR was digested with BamHI, which removes a 147-bp fragment from the open reading frame of the gene. The linearized fragment was made blunt using large fragment of DNA polymerase I and ligated with a 2.8-kilobase pair XbaI-SmaI fragment from plasmid pUC18-LEU2–8 containing the LEU2gene, in which the XbaI site of the fragment had been made blunt using a large fragment of DNA polymerase I before ligation. The resulting plasmid was digested with HindIII, and the 4.9-kilobase pair fragment was isolated and transformed into yeast strain W303–1B, producing the YGR203W-disrupted strain. Verification of the YGR203W disruption was confirmed by PCR using a forward primer 5′-CTCATTGTCCTGCTCTTC-3′ that hybridizes with a region 614 bp upstream of YGR203W and a reverse primer 5′-AAGCTTACGCCACAGATCGGGTAG-3′ that hybridizes with the 3′ end ofYGR203W. Disruption of the chromosomal arsCgene that confers arsenate resistance in E. coli was carried out by allelic replacement (17.Metcalf W.W. Jiang W. Daniels L.L. Kim S.K. Haldimann A. Wanner B.L. Plasmid. 1996; 35: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Chromosomal DNA from E. coli strain W3110 was amplified as a 400-bp fragment by PCR using a forward primer, 5′-GTCGACCTGGCGTACTCAACGTGCTGGC-3′, that hybridizes with a region 386 bp upstream of the arsC gene and a reverse primer, 5′-AAGCTTGTAATGTTGCTCATATCAGTATCTC-3′, that hybridizes with a region that includes the first 14 bp from the 5′ end ofarsC. The primers added a SalI and aHindIII site at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the fragment, respectively. Using the same genomic DNA, a second PCR fragment of 400 bp was cloned using a forward primer, 5′-AAGCTTCGCCTGAAATAAAGCGGCGATATC-3′, that hybridizes with a region that includes the last 12 bp from the 3′ end of arsC and a reverse primer, 5′-GGATCCTTCTCTGATAGTGTGTGAAGT-3′, that hybridizes to a region 388 bp downstream of arsC. The second set of primers added a HindIII and a BamHI site at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the fragment, respectively. A 30-cycle PCR (94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 0.5 min, and 72 °C for 1 min) was run with E. coli genomic DNA. The respective products were cloned into pGEM-T. The first plasmid was digested with SalI andHindIII, and the second plasmid was digested withBamHI and HindIII. The fragments were then co-ligated into plasmid pLD55 that had been digested withBamHI and SalI, creating plasmid pLD55-▵arsC, in which 400 bp of the 426-bp arsCgene had been deleted. To replace the wild type chromosomalarsC gene with the deletion, plasmid pLD55-▵arsC was transformed into E. coli strain W3110. The transformants were grown on plates containing 15 μg/ml of tetracycline and 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate to select for integrants harboring the plasmid-encoded tetAR genes. Tetracycline-resistant colonies were then grown on tetracycline-sensitive-selective agar plates for selection of plasmid-free segregants. Colonies growing on tetracycline-sensitive-selective plates (17.Metcalf W.W. Jiang W. Daniels L.L. Kim S.K. Haldimann A. Wanner B.L. Plasmid. 1996; 35: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) were simultaneously screened for Tcs, Aps, and arsenate sensitivity. Disruption of arsC in the resulting strain, designated WC3110, was confirmed by PCR. The arsC gene from plasmid pET-ArsC (8.Oden K.L. Gladysheva T.B. Rosen B.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) was cloned in the yeast-E. coli shuttle vector pYES2.0. Plasmid pET-ArsC was digested with NdeI and made blunt by using large fragment of DNA polymerase I. The linearized plasmid was then digested withNotI and purified. Plasmid pYES2.0 was first was first digested with BamHI and then made blunt using large fragment of DNA polymerase I. The linearized plasmid was digested withNotI and purified. The two linear fragments were ligated together to create plasmid pYES-ArsC. Cultures of E. coli strains W3110 and WC3110 bearing the indicated plasmids were grown overnight in low phosphate medium (8.Oden K.L. Gladysheva T.B. Rosen B.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The cells were diluted 100-fold in the same medium containing 0.2% arabinose and varying amounts of sodium arsenate and allowed to grow at 20 °C for an additional 48 h. Growth was estimated from the absorbance at 600 nm. Cultures of S. cerevisiae strains W303–1B and RM1 bearing the indicated plasmids were grown overnight at 30 °C in minimal medium containing 2% galactose supplemented with 0.2 mg/ml each of histidine and/or uracil, as appropriate. The cells were then diluted to an A 600 of 0.1 into same medium containing varying amounts sodium arsenate and allowed to grow for an additional 24 h. To determine the conditions for production of Acr2p in E. coli, a culture of strain TOP10 bearing plasmid pBAD-ACR2 was grown at 37 °C in 300 ml of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml of ampicillin to anA 600 of 0.5. The culture was then divided into three 100-ml aliquots and induced by addition of 0.02% L(+)-arabinose (final concentration). The cultures were allowed to grow for an additional 3 h at 37 °C, 6 h at 30 °C, or 10 h at 20 °C. A sample (1 ml) of each was harvested by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 10 min. The cell pellets were suspended in 0.1 ml of SDS sample buffer and incubated for 10 min in a boiling water bath. The remainder of each culture was harvested and washed once with Buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 m KCl, pH 7.5). The cells were suspended in 4 ml of Buffer B (50 mmMOPS, pH 7.5, containing 20 mm imidazole, 0.5 mNaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 20% glycerol) and lysed by a single passage through a French pressure cell at 20,000 p.s.i. Diisopropylfluorophosphate (2.5 μl/g) was added immediately after lysis. The lysate was diluted to 6 ml with Buffer B and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet was suspended in 6 ml of Buffer B. Portions of each of the inclusion bodies and cytosols were mixed with 4× SDS sample buffer and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (18.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) on 15% polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were transferred overnight onto a nitrocellulose membrane at 25 V and probed with a monoclonal antibody to the six-histidine tag (CLONTECH) using anti-mouse whole IgG (Sigma) as the secondary antibody. Immunoblotting was performed using an enhanced chemiluminescence assay (NEN Life Science Products) and exposed on x-ray film at room temperature according to the directions provided byCLONTECH. E. coli glutaredoxins were purified as described previously (19.Shi J. Vlamis-Gardikas A. Åslund F. Holmgren A. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36039-36042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). For purification of the S. cerevisiae Grx1p, E. coli strain TOP10 bearing pBAD-YGRX1 was grown in 2 liters of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin with shaking at 37 °C. At anA 600 nm of 0.5, L(+)-arabinose was added to a final concentration of 0.002% as inducer, and the culture was grown for an additional 4 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed once with Buffer A. The cells were suspended in Buffer B at a ratio of 5 ml of buffer/g of wet cells and lysed by a single passage through a French pressure cell at 20,000 p.s.i. Diisopropylfluorophosphate (2.5 μl/g of wet cells) was added to the lysate immediately after lysis. The lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant solution was loaded at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min onto a 7-ml Ni2+-NTA column preequilibrated with Buffer B. The column was then washed with 250 ml of Buffer B followed by elution with 125 ml of Buffer C (50 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, containing 200 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 20% glycerol). Fractions containing Grx1p were identified by SDS-PAGE (18.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), pooled, and concentrated using a Millipore Ultrafree-15 BIOMAX-5K centrifugal filter (Millipore) at 2000 × g. Trx1p and Trr1p with C-terminal histidine tags were purified by Ni2+-NTA chromatography by essentially the same procedure as Grx1p. For purification of Acr2p, cells of E. coli strain TOP10 bearing pBAD-ACR2 were grown in 4 liters of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin with shaking at 37 °C. At anA 600 nm of 0.5, L(+)-arabinose was added to a final concentration of 0.02% as inducer, and the culture was grown for an additional 10 h at 20 °C.

The lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant solution was loaded at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min onto a Ni2+-NTA column preequilibrated with Buffer B. The column was then washed with 350 ml of Buffer B followed by elution with 125 ml of Buffer C. Fractions containing Acr2p identified by SDS-PAGE, and fractions containing purified Acr2p were pooled and concentrated. The concentrated protein from the Ni2+-NTA column was applied to a 1.5-cm-diameter column filled to 75 cm with Sephacryl S-100 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) preequilibrated with Buffer D (50 mm MOPS, pH 6.5, containing 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, and 0.5 mm EDTA), eluted with the same buffer, pooled, and concentrated. All purified proteins were stored at −70 °C until use. Protein concentrations were determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using the following extinction coefficients for yeast proteins: Acr2p, 14,300m−1 cm−1; Grx1p, 5360 m−1cm−1; Trx1p, 9700m−1 cm−1; Trr1p, 23,380 m−1cm−1. Extinction coefficients were calculated by the method of Gill and von Hippel (20.Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar). The extinction coefficients for E. coli glutaredoxins were described previously (19.Shi J. Vlamis-Gardikas A. Åslund F. Holmgren A. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36039-36042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Arsenate reductase activity was assayed using a coupled assay as described previously (19.Shi J. Vlamis-Gardikas A. Åslund F. Holmgren A. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36039-36042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The assay buffer contained 50 mm MOPS, 50 mm MES, pH 6.5, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.4 mm NADPH, 15 nm yeast glutathione reductase (Calbiochem), 1 mm GSH, and 5 μm Acr2p. Reduction of 2-hydroxyethyldisulfide was used to ensure functioning of the coupling system. Sodium arsenate and glutaredoxins were added as indicated. Reductase activity was monitored at 340 nm and expressed as nmol of NADPH oxidized per mg of Acr2p using a molar extinction coefficient of 6200 for NADPH. The data were analyzed using SigmaPlot v. 5.0. TheS. cerevisiae ACR2 and E. coli arsC genes each confer arsenate resistance in their respective organisms. Acr2p and ArsC are totally unrelated, with no sequence similarity, and it was not known whether either yeast or E. coli has cofactors that would allow function of the heterologous reductase. It was of interest, therefore, to examine whether arsC could complement aS. cerevisiae strain in which ACR2 was disrupted and whether ACR2 could complement the arsenate-sensitive phenotype of an E. coli arsC disruption. The arsenate-sensitive S. cerevisiae strain RM1 was transformed with pYES-ArsC, which carries a wild type arsC gene under control of the GAL1 promoter. In presence of 2% galactose,arsC conferred arsenate resistance (Fig.1 A). When galactose was replaced"

Proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC)1 plays a key role in the development of restenosis and in the progression of atherosclerosis (1.Ross R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 791-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar, 2.Zwolak R.M. Adams M.C. Clowes A.W. J. Vasc. Surg. 1987; 5: 126-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Injury to the endothelium results in the migration of underlying VSMC into the intimal layer of the arterial wall, where they proliferate and synthesize extracellular matrix components. Although many growth factors induce the proliferation of VSMC (3.Hsueh W.A. Law R.E. Am. J. Cardiol. 1999; 84: 21-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is an important mitogenic and chemotactic regulator of VSMC, since blocking antibodies to PDGF inhibits neointimal formation in rat models of arterial injury (4.Ferns G.A. Raines E.W. Sprugel K.H. Motani A.S. Reidy M.A. Ross R. Science. 1991; 253: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). Insulin is also a potent mitogen for VSMC, and physiologic hyperinsulinemia enhances the mitogenic effects of PDGF (5.Goalstone M.L. Natarajan R. Standley P.R. Walsh M.F. Leitner J.W. Carel K. Scott S. Nadler J. Sowers J.R. Draznin B. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4067-4072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In response to vascular injury, quiescent VSMC (G0) must transit through the G1 phase of the cell cycle and enter into the S phase to undergo DNA replication.Progression through the cell cycle requires the formation and activation of cyclin and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complexes (6.Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4945) Google Scholar). Progression through the G1 phase requires cyclin D/CDK4, cyclin D/CDK6, and cyclin E/CDK2 holoenzymes. Functional cyclin A/CDK2 complexes are required for DNA synthesis (S phase), and subsequently, cyclin A/CDC2 and cyclin B/CDC2 pairs are assembled and activated during G2 phase and mitosis (M phase), respectively. Activation of the G1 phase cyclin·CDK complexes results in the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma gene products (Rb) (7.Nevins J.R. Leone G. DeGregori J. Jakoi L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 173: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Rb proteins are critical negative regulators of cell cycle progression by controlling gene expression mediated by E2F transcription factors (7.Nevins J.R. Leone G. DeGregori J. Jakoi L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 173: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). E2F-regulated genes encode proteins required for S phase DNA synthesis (8.Weinberg R.A.

In the absence of its being phosphorylated by CDKs, Rb binds and sequesters E2F, thereby preventing transcriptional activation of target genes. CDK-phosphorylated Rb releases E2F that permits the induction of E2F-dependent genes. CDK inhibitors (CDKIs), p21 cip1 (9.Xiong Y. Hannon G.J. Zhang H. Casso D. Kobayashi R. Beach D.

Pines J. Cell. 1994; 79: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2150) Google Scholar). Progression through the mammalian cell cycle is regulated by the balance between the levels and activities of cyclin·CDK complexes, the growth-promoting transcriptional factors they regulate, CDKIs and other growth suppressor proteins.Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are high-affinity ligands for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ). PPARγ is expressed in VSMC (16.Marx N. Schonbeck U. Lazar M.A. Libby P. Plutzky J. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 1097-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 17.Law R.E. Goetze S. Xi X.P. Jackson S.

Invest. 1996; 98: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that activation of PPARγ interferes with the function of a fundamental component of the cell cycle machinery. The specific mechanism by which PPARγ inhibits VSMC proliferation, however, remains to be determined. We have previously shown that PPARγ ligands inhibit ERK MAPK-dependent mitogenic signaling pathways in VSMC at a step downstream of ERK activation (18.Law R.E. Meehan W.P. Xi X.P. Graf K. Wuthrich D.A. Coats W. Faxon D. Hsueh W.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Induction of cyclin D and G1 → S progression of nonvascular cells has also been shown to require activation of ERK and MAPK. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of PPARγ ligands on cell cycle regulators in rat aortic smooth muscle cells and to delineate the mechanism of their antiproliferative activity.DISCUSSIONThe principal finding of this study is that PPARγ ligands inhibit VSMC proliferation by attenuating the activity of several key cell cycle regulators that control G1 → S progression. All PPARγ ligands prevented mitogen-induced phosphorylation of Rb by inhibiting cyclin D1- and cyclin E-dependent kinase activity. Attenuation of mitogen-induced p27 kip1 degradation by PPARγ ligands is likely the major mechanism ultimately resulting in the inhibition of Rb phosphorylation. Indeed, depletion of p27 kip1 by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides promotes cell growth (28.Braun-Dullaeus R.C. Mann M.J. Ziegler A. von der Leyen H.E. Dzau V.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 815-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and mice with targeted disruption of the p27 kip1 gene have enhanced growth with enlargement of the pituitary, adrenals, and gonads (29.Kiyokawa H. Kineman R.D. Manova-Todorova K.O. Soares V.C. Hoffman E.S. Ono M. Khanam D. Hayday A.C. Frohman L.A. Koff A.

Perlmutter R.M. Kaushansky K. Roberts J.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 733-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar). A recent study demonstrated that overexpression of p27 kip1 inhibited serum-stimulated DNA synthesis in VSMC (28.Braun-Dullaeus R.C. Mann M.J. Ziegler A. von der Leyen H.E. Dzau V.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 815-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in a porcine balloon-injury model, p27 kip1 expression was markedly reduced in the intima and media early after angioplasty, consistent with an injury-induced proliferative response (31.Tanner F.C. Yang Z.Y. Duckers E. Gordon D. Nabel G.J. Nabel E.G. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 396-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 32.Wei G.L. Krasinski K. Kearney M. Isner J.M. Walsh K. Andres V. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Thus, p27 kip1 down-regulation is a necessary event for cell cycle progression. The prostanoid PPARγ ligand 15d-PGJ2 and the ERK/MAPK pathway inhibitor PD98059 exhibited a broader profile of activity toward G1 cell cycle regulatory proteins, since they also blocked mitogenic induction of cyclin D1.Stimulation of the Ras-ERK/MAPK pathway triggers proliferation for a variety of different cell types (33.Waskiewicz A.J. Cooper J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 798-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Activation of Ras → Raf → MEK → ERK/MAPK pathway is critical for both mitogen-dependent cyclin D1 induction and p27 kip1 degradation (34.Aktas H. Cai H. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3850-3857Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 35.Greulich H. Erikson R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13280-13288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, constitutive expression of an activated form of MEK1, the upstream dual-specificity kinase that phosphorylates and activates ERKs, down-regulated p27 kip1 (35.Greulich H. Erikson R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13280-13288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In CCL39 fibroblasts and IEC-6 intestinal epithelial cells, the blockade of the MAPK cascade with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 prevented both S phase entry and p27 kip1 down-regulation (36.Rivard N. Boucher M.J. Asselin C. L'Allemain G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C652-C664Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations are in concordance with our finding that blocking ERK/MAPK signaling with PD98059 attenuated mitogen-induced down-regulation of p27 kip1. Degradation of several cell cycle regulatory proteins including cyclins, p53, Rb, and p27 kip1 results from ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis in proteosomes (37.Pagano M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1067-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 38.Tsvetkov L.M. Yeh K.H. Lee S.J. Sun H. Zhang H. Curr.

A. 1999; 96: 7797-7802Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which the MAPK pathway and proteosomes interact, however, is unclear. Nevertheless, in combination, these studies support an important role for ERK/MAPKs in regulating p27 kip1 levels after mitogenic stimulation.Similar to other cell types, the ERK/MAPK pathway is required for the growth in VSMC (40.Takahashi E. Berk B.C. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1998; 164: 611-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated in VSMC that the PPARγ ligand TRO inhibited mitogen-induced MAPK signaling downstream of ERK phosphorylation and activation by MEK, which is associated with an inhibition of growth (18.Law R.E. Meehan W.P. Xi X.P. Graf K. Wuthrich D.A. Coats W. Faxon D. Hsueh W.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). In the present study, we find that PPARγ ligands and the MAPK pathway inhibitor PD98059 inhibit mitogenic degradation of p27 kip1, thereby preventing Rb hyperphosphorylation and the exit of quiescent VSMC from G1→ S. Consistent with previous studies in nonvascular cells (34.Aktas H. Cai H. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3850-3857Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 35.Greulich H. Erikson R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13280-13288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), we found that blockade of MAPK signaling with PD98059 potently inhibited cyclin D1 up-regulation by mitogens. In contrast, the TZD PPARγ ligands TRO and RSG had no effect on cyclin D1 expression. Thus, PPARγ ligands do not globally suppress MAPK-dependent processes, but they may inhibit some transcription factors regulated by the MAPK pathway. We have reported that TRO inhibited activation of the transcription factor Elk-1, which is regulated by MAPK (18.Law R.E. Meehan W.P. Xi X.P. Graf K. Wuthrich D.A. Coats W. Faxon D. Hsueh W.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Inhibition of MAPK-dependent Elk-1 activation was associated with an inhibition of c-Fos expression and cell proliferation (18.Law R.E. Meehan W.P. Xi X.P. Graf K. Wuthrich D.A. Coats W. Faxon D. Hsueh W.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). These data also suggest that inhibition of cyclin D1 expression by 15d-PGJ2 may not be mediated by its activation of PPARγ but rather through its binding to prostaglandin receptors.Ras can also activate the Rho pathway, which is also important for cell proliferation. Rho signaling has been implicated in the regulation of p27 kip1 degradation (41.Hu W. Bellone C.J. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3396-3401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 42.Weber J.D. Hu W. Jefcoat S.J. Raben D.M. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32966-32971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In IIC9 hamster embryo fibroblasts, expression of dominant-negative Rho prevented PDGF-induced degradation of p27 kip1 (42.Weber J.D. Hu W. Jefcoat S.J. Raben D.M. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32966-32971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In marked contrast to results obtained in mouse fibroblasts linking ERK/MAPK activation to p27 kip1 degradation, overexpression of dominant-negative ERK in IIC9 cells had no effect on p27 kip1 levels. This study concluded that Ras activation of Rho, but not ERK, regulates p27 kip1 degradation. Rho-dependent degradation of p27 kip1 in PDGF-stimulated fibroblasts requires its phosphorylation by cyclin E-CDK2 (41.Hu W. Bellone C.J. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3396-3401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We observed that all PPARγ ligands inhibited cyclin E-dependent kinase activity, which may be the mechanism by which they attenuate p27 kip1 degradation. This effect could result from an inhibition of mitogen-induced ERK signaling by PPARγ as we previously identified. Alternatively, PPARγ may regulate p27 kip1 turnover through a novel action to block Rho signaling. However, we found that PPARγ activation did not decrease mitogen-enhanced Rho protein levels. 2S. Wakino, U. Kintscher, S. Kim, F. Yin, W. A. Hsueh, and R. E. Law, unpublished results. In addition, it is unlikely that a nuclear receptor like PPARγ would affect Rho movement from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, which is important for activation of the Rho pathway (43.Casey P.J. Science. 1995; 268: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Additional experiments are required to establish whether the Rho pathway is targeted by PPARγ.Quiescent VSMC expressed high levels of p27 kip1, but p21 cip1 was not detectable. Mitogenic stimulation with the combination of PDGF and insulin increased expression of p21 cip1 during G1 → S transition. Up-regulation of p21 cip1 during G1 at first glance is paradoxical, given that it and other CDKIs function to regulate negatively cyclin-CDK activity. Several recent reports, however, have revealed that CDKI modulation of the cell cycle is complex and involves both positive and negative regulation by CDKIs (23.Rao G.N. Biochim. Biophys.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar). Threshold levels of p21 cip1 have been shown to be required for the formation of functional cyclin D1·CDK4 complexes (44.LaBaer J. Garrett M.D. Stevenson L.F. Slingerland J.M. Sandhu C. Chou H.S. Fattaey A. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar). Higher concentrations of p21 cip1, however, inhibited cyclin D1-CDK4 activity consistent with its more traditionally recognized CDKI function (44.LaBaer J. Garrett M.D. Stevenson L.F. Slingerland J.M. Sandhu C. Chou H.S. Fattaey A. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar). The potential for p21 cip1 to regulate CDKs positively is supported by a recent genetic study showing that primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts from p27 kip1 /p21 cip1 double knockout animals failed to assemble detectable amounts of cyclin D1·CDK complexes (27.Cheng M. Olivier P. Diehl J.A. Fero M. Roussel M.F. Roberts J.M. Sherr C.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1571-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). At physiological concentration (10 μm), the PPARγ ligands TRO and RSG inhibited mitogen-induced p21 cip1, but 15d-PGJ2 and the MAPK pathway inhibitor had no effect. Since we saw similar effects of TRO and RSG to inhibit p21 cip1 induction, it is possible that this also plays a role in the inhibition of G1 → S transition by PPARγ. PPARγ blockade of p21 cip1 induction by mitogens may result from the ability of these nuclear receptors to inhibit the function of transcription factors, such as NFκB, STAT, and AP-1, via the mechanism of transrepression (45.Delerive P.

Chem. 1999; 274: 17088-17097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) showed that activation of ectopically expressed PPARγ in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts inhibited their growth and promoted their differentiation into adipocytes, which was associated with a concomitant increase in mRNA and protein for CDKIs, p18 ink4c and p21 cip1. There was no effect of PPARγ activation on p27 kip1 in these cells. Inhibition of cell cycle progression frequently is a prerequisite to terminal differentiation. Regulatory mechanisms causing cell cycle arrest during differentiation, however, appear to differ from those governing the exit of quiescent cells from G1 → S. For example, during adipocyte differentiation PPARγ-mediated growth arrest did not require a functional pRB (48.Hansen J.B. Petersen R.K. Larsen B.M. Bartkova J. Alsner J. Kristiansen K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2386-2393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In contrast, our data strongly implicate PPARγ-dependent inhibition of Rb phosphorylation as the mechanism by which PPARγ ligands prevent quiescent VSMC from exiting G1. PPARγ ligands also inhibit growth of tumor cells (49.Elstner E. Muller C. Koshizuka K. Williamson E.A. Park D. Asou H. Shintaku P. Said J.W. Heber D. Koeffler H.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 9116-9121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). The impact of PPARγ ligands on the cell cycle in these cell types remains to be determined.Recent studies have illustrated the feasibility of targeting specific cell cycle regulators in cardiovascular cells as an alternative antiproliferative therapy (53.Braun D.R. Mann M.J. Dzau V.J. Circulation. 1998; 98: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). A wide range of anti-proliferative drugs has been tested as means to prevent restenosis and vein graft neointimal formation. One alternative to drug therapy is the use of modified viruses designed to carry a cell cycle regulatory gene directly into the arterial wall. Infection of porcine femoral or rat carotid arteries with an adenoviral vector designed to express a nonphosphorylatable, constitutively active form of Rb inhibited neointima formation in animal balloon-injury models (54.Chang M.W. Barr E. Seltzer J. Jiang Y.Q. Nabel G.J. Nabel E.G. Parmacek M.S. Leiden J.M. Science. 1995; 267: 518-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Our recent studies have shown that TRO inhibited intimal hyperplasia after balloon injury of aortae in the rat (18.Law R.E. Meehan W.P. Xi X.P. Graf K. Wuthrich D.A. Coats W. Faxon D. Hsueh W.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). The present study suggests that the prevention of the reduction of p27 kip1 levels by TRO in vivo may contribute, at least in part, to its activity to inhibit the vascular injury response. The observation that PPARγ ligands inhibit important cell cycle processes activated by growth factors produced in response to vascular damage may provide a new oral therapeutic approach for proliferative vascular disease such as restenosis and atherosclerosis. Proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC)1 plays a key role in the development of restenosis and in the progression of atherosclerosis (1.Ross R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 791-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar, 2.Zwolak R.M. Adams M.C. Clowes A.W. J. Vasc. Surg. 1987; 5: 126-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Injury to the endothelium results in the migration of underlying VSMC into the intimal layer of the arterial wall, where they proliferate and synthesize extracellular matrix components. Although many growth factors induce the proliferation of VSMC (3.Hsueh W.A. Law R.E. Am. J. Cardiol. 1999; 84: 21-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is an important mitogenic and chemotactic regulator of VSMC, since blocking antibodies to PDGF inhibits neointimal formation in rat models of arterial injury (4.Ferns G.A. Raines E.W. Sprugel K.H. Motani A.S. Reidy M.A. Ross R. Science. 1991; 253: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). Insulin is also a potent mitogen for VSMC, and physiologic hyperinsulinemia enhances the mitogenic effects of PDGF (5.Goalstone M.L. Natarajan R. Standley P.R. Walsh M.F. Leitner J.W. Carel K. Scott S. Nadler J. Sowers J.R. Draznin B. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4067-4072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In response to vascular injury, quiescent VSMC (G0) must transit through the G1 phase of the cell cycle and enter into the S phase to undergo DNA replication. Progression through the cell cycle requires the formation and activation of cyclin and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complexes (6.Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4945) Google Scholar). Progression through the G1 phase requires cyclin D/CDK4, cyclin D/CDK6, and cyclin E/CDK2 holoenzymes. Functional cyclin A/CDK2 complexes are required for DNA synthesis (S phase), and subsequently, cyclin A/CDC2 and cyclin B/CDC2 pairs are assembled and activated during G2 phase and mitosis (M phase), respectively. Activation of the G1 phase cyclin·CDK complexes results in the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma gene products (Rb) (7.Nevins J.R. Leone G. DeGregori J. Jakoi L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 173: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Rb proteins are critical negative regulators of cell cycle progression by controlling gene expression mediated by E2F transcription factors (7.Nevins J.R. Leone G. DeGregori J. Jakoi L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 173: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). E2F-regulated genes encode proteins required for S phase DNA synthesis (8.Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 457-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In the absence of its being phosphorylated by CDKs, Rb binds and sequesters E2F, thereby preventing transcriptional activation of target genes. CDK-phosphorylated Rb releases E2F that permits the induction of E2F-dependent genes. CDK inhibitors (CDKIs), p21 cip1 (9.Xiong Y. Hannon G.J. Zhang H. Casso D. Kobayashi R. Beach D.

https://openalex.org/W2035109568,"Brain-enriched hyaluronan binding (BEHAB)/brevican is a brain-specific extracellular matrix protein containing a cleavage site between Glu395-Ser396, which bears remarkable homology to the “aggrecanase” site in the cartilage proteoglycan aggrecan. Expression of BEHAB/brevican is dramatically increased in human gliomas, notoriously invasive tumors. Recently, we showed that the rat 9L gliosarcoma cell line, which does not express BEHAB/brevican and forms non-invasive tumors when grown as intracranial grafts, can form invasive tumors when transfected with a 5′ cDNA fragment of BEHAB/brevican, but not when transfected with the full-length cDNA. In marked contrast, the highly invasive CNS-1 glioma cell line expresses and cleaves BEHAB/brevican protein when grown as an intracranial graft. These results suggest that both synthesis and cleavage of BEHAB/brevican protein may play a role in the invasiveness of gliomas. We report here, using an antibody developed to the neoepitope created by BEHAB/brevican cleavage at the Glu395-Ser396 site, that the CNS-1 cells are able to cleave the protein in vitro. We characterized the CNS-1-derived cleavage activity by assaying its ability to cleave BEHAB/brevican proteoglycan, and determined that the enzyme is a constitutively expressed, secreted activity. Using a variety of protease inhibitors, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and specific antibodies, we determined that this activity is likely to be a member of the ADAMTS family of metalloproteinases, specifically ADAMTS4. These results suggest a novel function for ADAMTS family members in BEHAB/brevican cleavage and glioma and indicate that inhibition of ADAMTS in glioma may provide a novel therapeutic strategy.

Kelly G.M. Hockfield S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 495-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), which was independently cloned in another laboratory and named brevican (2Yamada H. Watanabe K. Shimonaka M. Yamaguchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10119-10126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). BEHAB/brevican is the newest member of the lectican family of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, a family that also includes aggrecan, versican, and neurocan. Like all lecticans, the BEHAB/brevican protein contains a hyaluronan-binding domain in its N terminus and an epidermal growth factor-like repeat, a C-type lectin-like domain, and a complement regulatory protein-like domain in its C terminus (see Fig. 1 A). A glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked isoform of this gene has also been described (3Seidenbecher C.I. Richter K. Rauch U. Fassler R. Garner C.C. Gundelfinger E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27206-27212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 4Seidenbecher C.I. Gundelfinger E.D. Bockers T.M. Trotter J. Kreutz M.R. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 1621-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). BEHAB/brevican exists, somewhat unusually, both as a proteoglycan and as a non-glycosylated core protein (5Yamaguchi Y. Perspect. Dev. Neurobiol. 1996; 3: 307-317PubMed Google Scholar). The BEHAB/brevican protein contains a single known cleavage site between Glu395-Ser396, which bears striking homology to the “aggrecanase” cleavage site in aggrecan (6Yamada H. Watanabe K. Shimonaka M. Yamasaki M. Yamaguchi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 957-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the major cartilage proteoglycan. The 23 amino acids surrounding the cleavage site in BEHAB/brevican are 50% identical to the cleavage site in aggrecan. In the normal adult rat brain, full-length BEHAB/brevican protein (145 kDa) and both 90- and 50-kDa cleavage products are detected (2Yamada H. Watanabe K. Shimonaka M. Yamaguchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10119-10126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Zhang H. Kelly G. Zerillo C. Jaworski D.M. Hockfield S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2370-2376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The function of BEHAB/brevican in the brain is poorly understood, however, it is clear that its expression is developmentally regulated (4Seidenbecher C.I. Gundelfinger E.D. Bockers T.M. Trotter J. Kreutz M.R. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 1621-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 8Jaworski D.M. Kelly G.M. Hockfield S. J.

Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7784-7795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, a growing body of evidence suggests that BEHAB/brevican expression is high at times and in places where glial cells are highly motile. The highest level of BEHAB/brevican expression during brain development is in the ventricular zone, coincident with the peak in gliogenesis in each brain region that has been examined (8Jaworski D.M. Kelly G.M. Hockfield S. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 1352-1362Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, BEHAB/brevican is up-regulated in glial cells immediately adjacent to the site of an experimentally induced brain injury, coincident with increases in markers of reactive gliosis (10Jaworski D.M. Kelly G.M. Hockfield S. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 157: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Finally, BEHAB/brevican expression is dramatically increased in primary tumors (gliomas) of the central nervous system (11Jaworski D.M. Kelly G.M. Piepmeier J.M. Hockfield S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2293-2298PubMed Google Scholar), an unusually invasive tumor cell type. The remarkably invasive growth pattern of gliomas makes these tumors extremely difficult to control and nearly impossible to remove surgically. In every sample of human glioma assayed to date, including oligodendroglioma, all grades of astrocytoma, and gliosarcoma, a high level of BEHAB/brevican mRNA is detected (11Jaworski D.M. Kelly G.M. Piepmeier J.M. Hockfield S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2293-2298PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, BEHAB/brevican mRNA is either undetectable or detected at very low levels in tumors of non-glial origin and is detected at relatively low levels in normal human brain (11Jaworski D.M. Kelly G.M. Piepmeier J.M. Hockfield S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2293-2298PubMed Google Scholar). A glioma's ability to express and modify an extracellular matrix molecule such as BEHAB/brevican might contribute to an alteration in the extracellular environment that facilitates invasion (12Gary S.C. Kelly G.M. Hockfield S. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 576-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Recently we showed that the 9L gliosarcoma cell line, which does not express BEHAB/brevican and forms non-invasive tumors when grown as intracranial grafts, can form invasive tumors when transfected with a 5′ fragment of a BEHAB/brevican cDNA (7Zhang H. Kelly G. Zerillo C. Jaworski D.M. Hockfield S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2370-2376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, 9L cells transfected with the full-length BEHAB/brevican cDNA did not grow as invasive tumors. Analysis of the protein produced by the full-length transfected 9L cells revealed that the predicted full-length protein is produced, but is not cleaved. Conversely, intracranial grafts of the invasive CNS-1 glioma cell line express high levels of BEHAB/brevican mRNA and also cleave the full-length protein, producing 50- and 90-kDa cleavage products (7Zhang H. Kelly G. Zerillo C. Jaworski D.M. Hockfield S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2370-2376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The suggestion from this study is that both synthesis and cleavage of the BEHAB/brevican protein may play critical roles in the invasiveness of gliomas. Here we report the characterization and identification of the activity that cleaves BEHAB/brevican. When grown as intracranial grafts, CNS-1 cells express BEHAB/brevican, cleave the full-length protein, and aggressively infiltrate the surrounding normal brain tissue (11Jaworski D.M. Kelly G.M. Piepmeier J.M. Hockfield S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2293-2298PubMed Google Scholar). However, expression of BEHAB/brevican by these cells requires a brain-specific inducing factor, because CNS-1 cells do not express BEHAB/brevican either in culture or when grown as subcutaneous grafts. To determine whether the CNS-1 cells constitutively produce a BEHAB/brevican cleavage activity, we transfected these cells with the full-length cDNA and assayed their ability to cleave the resultant protein in vitro. To assay cleavage specifically at the predicted cleavage site, we developed an antibody to the neoepitope produced by BEHAB/brevican cleavage at Glu395-Ser396. Our results show that the enzyme responsible for BEHAB/brevican cleavage is a secreted activity, constitutively expressed by CNS-1 cells. The pattern of inhibition of this activity is consistent with it being a member of the ADAMTS family of metalloproteinases (13Tortorella M.D. Burn T.C. Pratta M.A. Abbaszade I. Hollis J.M. Liu R.

Further characterization of this activity by RT-PCR, Northern blot analysis, and immunodepletion indicates that the CNS-1 cell-derived activity responsible for BEHAB/brevican cleavage at the Glu395-Ser396cleavage site is ADAMTS4. Rat CNS-1 glioma cells were transfected with full-length cDNA encoding the secreted form of rat BEHAB/brevican (generously provided by Dr. Yu Yamaguchi, Burnham Institute) by electroporation. The cDNA was cloned into the EcoRI site of the eukaryotic expression vector pCDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Transfectants were selected in RPMI with 10% FBS and 1 mg/ml G418. After 10–14 days, G418-resistant colonies were isolated and their media assayed by Western blot for the presence of BEHAB/brevican protein. The 9L gliosarcoma cell line was tranfected by a similar method, as described previously (7Zhang H. Kelly G. Zerillo C. Jaworski D.M. Hockfield S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2370-2376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All cell lines were maintained in RPMI with 10% FBS and 500 μg/ml G418 was added to maintain expression in transfected cells. The B50 antibody was designed to recognize the neoepitope formed by the cleavage of BEHAB/brevican using the strategy employed by Hughes and colleagues (16Hughes C.E. Caterson B. White R.J. Roughley P.J. Mort J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16011-16014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Hughes C.E. Caterson B. Fosang A.J. Roughley P.J. Mort J.S. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 799-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) in making cleavage site-specific antibodies to link protein and to aggrecan. The peptide used for antibody production represents the last 7 amino acid residues in the new C terminus (QEAVESE) produced by cleavage of BEHAB/brevican protein at the Glu395-Ser396 cleavage site (Fig. 1 A). The peptide was designed with two glycine spacers and a cysteine residue added to the N terminus. Rabbits were immunized with the antigen (CGGQEAVESE) coupled to the carrier protein ovalbumin by the N-terminal cysteine (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA). Antiserum from immunized rabbits was affinity purified, and specific immunoreactivity was confirmed by blocking with the specific peptide. Antibody B5 recognizes a peptide within the N-terminal fragment of BEHAB/brevican (amino acids 60–73, HLRPPPSRRAAPGF) and antibody B6 recognizes a peptide within the C-terminal fragment (amino acids 506–529, SPSPRPPRVHGPPAETLQPPREGS) (Fig. 1 A), and have been previously described (7Zhang H. Kelly G. Zerillo C. Jaworski D.M. Hockfield S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2370-2376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A rabbit polyclonal antibody to the peptide VMAHVDEEP, which recognizes amino acids 393 to 403 of ADAMTS4 was made as described previously (13Tortorella M.D. Burn T.C. Pratta M.A. Abbaszade I. Hollis J.M. Liu R. Rosenfeld S.A. Copeland R.A. Decicco C.P. Wynn R. Rockwell A. Yang F. Duke J.L. Solomon K. George H. Bruckner R. Nagase H. Itoh Y. Ellis D.M. Ross H. Wiswall B.H. Murphy K.

We first determined that CNS-1 cells transfected with full-length BEHAB/brevican can cleave the full-length protein; we next wanted to determine the cellular location of this activity. Non-transfected, parental CNS-1 cells were plated and maintained in RPMI with 10% FBS until they reached an approximately 50% confluence. The media was removed and replaced with OPTI-MEM (Life Technologies) without FBS for 48 h. After 48 h the media was collected and concentrated in a stirred cell with a 30,000M r cut-off filter (Amicon). The cells were rinsed twice in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, collected by scraping, pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 100 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.2), and lysed by sonication. The resulting homogenate was centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 10 min to remove debris and unlysed cells. The supernatant was removed and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min. The resulting pellet represents a crude membrane preparation, and the supernatant represents the cell lysate. All fractions, media, pellet (membrane), and lysate, were tested for cleavage activity as described below. Rat BEHAB/brevican proteoglycan was isolated as follows. Adult Lewis rats were deeply anesthetized, sacrificed by decapitation, and their brains quickly removed and homogenized in 9 volumes of cold homogenization buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.2). The homogenate was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min to remove the bulk of the insoluble material. The supernatant was centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 45 min to remove any remaining insoluble material. The remaining supernatant was considered to be the soluble fraction and was the source of the substrate for subsequent assays. The BEHAB/brevican proteoglycan was further enriched in the soluble fraction by Q-Sepharose anion exchange chromatography. The soluble fraction was brought to 1% CHAPS, equivalent to our starting buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 1% CHAPS, pH 7.2), and was loaded on a 5 ml of Fast Flow Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was washed with 7 column volumes of the starting buffer. Protein was then eluted from the column with a continuous NaCl gradient, from 50 mm NaCl (100% starting buffer) to 1 m NaCl (100% elution buffer) over a total volume of 100 ml. The column was subsequently washed with 5 volumes of the elution buffer. Protein elution was monitored by UV absorbance at 280 nm. BEHAB/brevican full-length proteoglycan eluted as a relatively broad peak starting when the NaCl concentration reached about 0.70 m and continuing until the concentration reached approximately 0.95 m. All samples containing BEHAB/brevican proteoglycan, as determined by Western blot, were combined, concentrated, and buffer-exchanged (100 mmTris, pH 7.2) in a stirred cell with 100,000 molecular weight cut-off filter. Samples were then used in the cleavage assay as described below. All cleavage assays were carried out in a volume of 15 μl. In each reaction 3 μg of the adult rat soluble BEHAB/brevican proteoglycan was used as substrate and 10 μg of the CNS-1-derived activity (media, pellet (membrane), or lysate) was added as the source of the cleavage activity. Several different buffers were tested for their influence on cleavage activity (data not shown). The most effective buffer was 100 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, and 2% glycerol (pH 7.4), which therefore became our standard activity buffer. Glycerol enhanced cleavage in every buffer tested, perhaps by stabilizing protein-protein interactions. The time course (between 2 and 48 h) and temperature dependence (between 4 and 55 °C) of substrate cleavage were examined but cleavage was typically assessed after 15 h at 37 °C unless otherwise noted. Cleavage of the substrate was stopped by boiling samples in a standard gel-loading sample buffer. These samples were then analyzed by gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. For all inhibitor studies we used the standard activity buffer described above except we minimized the amount of Ca2+, decreasing its concentration to 3 mm. EDTA, EGTA, dipocolonic acid, 1,10-phenanthroline, TPEN, phosphoramidon, and 4-aminobenzyl-Gly-Pro-d-Leu-d-Ala-hydroxamic acid were purchased from Sigma. Recombinant TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 were purchased from Chemicon. The hydroxamic acid inhibitors XS309 ([3S-[3R*,2-[2R*, 2-(R*,S*)]-hexahydro-2-(2-[2-(hydroxyamino)-1-methyl-2-oxyethyl]-4-methyl-1-oxypentyl]-N-methyl-3-pyridazinecarboxamide) and SE206 (2S,2R,6S-3-aza-4-oxo-10-oxa-5-hexyl-2-(methylcarboxamido)-(10)paracyclophane-6-N-hydroxycarboxamide) were synthesized at DuPont as described previously (18Campion, C., Davidson, A.

The effect of all inhibitors was evaluated after incubation at 37 °C for 15 h. Samples were analyzed by Western blot. To determine if the CNS-1-derived cleavage activity might exist as a latent MMP, we tested the ability of APMA, an activator of latent MMPs, to stimulate cleavage. APMA was added to the concentrated CNS-1 conditioned media at concentrations of 2 mm, 1 mm, and 500 μm and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h prior to testing the CNS-1 media in the standard cleavage assay. Rat recombinant BEHAB/brevican protein, produced by 9L cells transfected with the full-length cDNA (40 μg), was combined with 8.3 μg/ml human recombinant ADAMTS-4 and either immediately quenched or incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. The buffer for this experiment was 50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm CaCl2, and 100 mm NaCl (pH 7.5). The assay was quenched with 20 mm EDTA. The products of digestion, which represented 20 μg of starting material were then separated by SDS-PAGE on 4–12% Tris glycine gradient gels (NOVEX), and were then analyzed by Western blot using the B6 and B50 antibodies. The enzyme was characterized against a bovine aggrecan monomer substrate and shown to generate BC-3-reactive fragments as described previously (13Tortorella M.D. Burn T.C. Pratta M.A. Abbaszade I.

The samples were then centrifuged and the immunodepleted media was removed. The depleted activities were then tested in our standard activity assay and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. A subset of samples were treated with 0.25 units/ml chondroitinase ABC (ICN Biomedicals, Cleveland, OH) prior to analysis by Western blot (as indicated). Samples were incubated with the enzyme at 37 °C for 2 h in the presence of protease inhibitors. Enzyme digestion was stopped by boiling samples in-gel loading buffer. Samples were electrophoresed on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and proteins were then electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were incubated with one of several rabbit affinity purified antisera, B5 (1:5000), B6 (1:10,000), or B50 (1:5000), followed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were visualized with nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl phosphate. Total RNA from rat brain, CNS-1 cells, and 9L cells was isolated in the Trizol by standard methods. 1 μg of total RNA was then reverse transcribed using oligo(dT). PCR amplification was performed on the transcribed substrate using sequence-specific primers designed to recognizes both rat and human ADAMTS4 2K. Solomon, unpublished data. (5′-primer sequence ACCGACCTCTTCAAGAGCTT and 3′-primer sequence GCATCAGCGTGTATTCACCA). The resulting PCR-amplified product was cloned into TOPO pCR 2.1 TA-cloning vector by following manufacturers instructions (Invitrogen). Clones were subsequently sequenced by the HHMI/W.M. Keck Biotechnology Resource Lab at Yale University using the fluorescently labeled dideoxynucleotide chain termination method. 25 μg of total RNA from rat brain, CNS-1 cells, and 9L cells was denatured in 2.2 mformaldehyde, 50% formamide, 1 × MOPS buffer at 65 °C for 15 min. The RNA was electrophoresed on a 1.0% argarose-formaldehyde gel with 1 × MOPS at 25 V. The gel was briefly neutralized in transfer buffer and RNA blotted to Zetaprobe (Bio-Rad) by capillary transfer. After transfer filters were washed briefly in 2 × SSC and baked to immobilize RNA. The cloned ADAMTS4 fragment obtained by RT-PCR was used as the hybridization probe and labeled by random priming. A cyclophilin-specific probe was also used to adjust for relative loading and RNA quality. Hybridization conditions were identical to those previously described (1Jaworski D.M. Kelly G.M. Hockfield S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 495-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). 9L cells transfected with full-length BEHAB/brevican cDNA produced only one immunoreactive band at approximately 145 kDa on Western blots as previously reported (Fig. 1 B, lane 4) (7Zhang H. Kelly G. Zerillo C. Jaworski D.M. Hockfield S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2370-2376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, CNS-1 cells transfected with the full-length cDNA produced 145- and 90-kDa immunoreactive bands when assayed with antibody B6, and 145- and 50-kDa bands with antibody B5 (Fig. 1 B, lane 2). An antibody that specifically recognizes the neoepitope revealed by cleavage at Glu395-Ser396 was generated and named antibody B50. Fig. 1 B shows the specificity of the antibody B50. It does not recognize full-length BEHAB/brevican protein produced by either the 9L or CNS-1 cells and recognizes only the 50-kDa cleavage product produced by CNS-1 cells transfected with the full-length BEAHB/brevican cDNA. Because of its selectivity and specificity antibody B50 was used almost exclusively in subsequent experiments. Since BEHAB/brevican is a relatively abundant proteoglycan in the adult rat brain (1Jaworski D.M. Kelly G.M. Hockfield S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 495-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 5Yamaguchi Y. Perspect. Dev. Neurobiol. 1996; 3: 307-317PubMed Google Scholar), a rat brain proteoglycan fraction was used as the substrate for our assays. BEHAB/brevican protein exists in both full-length and cleaved forms in the adult rat brain (5Yamaguchi Y. Perspect. Dev. Neurobiol. 1996; 3: 307-317PubMed Google Scholar, 7Zhang H. Kelly G. Zerillo C. Jaworski D.M. Hockfield S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2370-2376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.2 shows a Western blot of a soluble rat brain preparation digested with chondroitinase and stained with antibodies B5 and B50, demonstrating that both the full-length and 50-kDa cleavage products are present in this preparation. Even in this complex mixture of proteoglycans antibody B50 recognized only a single, 50-kDa band. Using Q-Sepharose anion-exchange chromatography we isolated the BEHAB/brevican proteoglycan-containing fraction from this soluble rat brain preparation. This provided a preparation that was relatively enriched in full-length BEHAB/brevican proteoglycan (Fig.2). Furthermore, the 50-kDa N-terminal cleavage product contains no glycosylaminoglycan attachment sites and, accordingly, eluted before the proteoglycan fraction. Thus, the soluble proteoglycan fraction derived from the adult rat brain is highly enriched in full-length BEHAB/brevican and does not contain the 50-kDa cleavage fragment (Fig.2). This substrate, therefore, permitted us to monitor cleavage activity by following the generation of the 50-kDa product. The ability of the transfected CNS-1 cells to cleave BEHAB/brevican indicated that these cells express a constitutively active proteolytic enzyme in culture. We next determined the cellular location of this activity. We compared the ability of conditioned media from CNS-1 cells, CNS-1 cell lysates, and CNS-1 cell membranes to cleave BEHAB/brevican. As shown in Fig.3, the cell lysate does not contain activity, the membrane fraction contains only a low level of activity, and the conditioned media contains the highest level of activity. Accordingly, we used concentrated CNS-1-conditioned media as the source of activity in all subsequent studies. A variety of different buffers at several concentrations were assayed to determine the most effective conditions for cleavage (data not shown). The concentrations of Ca2+, Zn2+, and NaCl all proved to be important in modulating activity. Cleavage increased with increasing Ca2+ concentrations from 1 to 20 mm(Fig. 4 A). There was very little, if any, cleavage without the addition of Ca2+. The Zn2+ concentration was also significant. High levels of Zn2+ (above 500 μm) were inhibitory even in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 4 B). Cleavage proceeded without added Zn2+, however, Zn2+ was present in low concentrations in our activity preparation. The lack of stimulatory effect of exogenously added Zn2+ does not suggest that Zn2+ is not necessary for enzyme activity. The concentrations of other divalent cations such as Mg2+ had little effect on cleavage (data not shown). In addition, NaCl concentration modulated cleavage activity. High NaCl concentrations (500 mm or greater) completely inhibited cleavage, but cleavage was only mildly inhibited by the absence of NaCl. Maximal cleavage activity was observed between approximately 100 and 200 mm NaCl (Fig. 4 C). Cleavage of BEHAB/brevican proteoglycan is pH, temperature, and time dependent. Cleavage proceeded only between pH 6.0 and 9.0. At a pH above or below this"

RNA polymerase II carboxyl-terminal domain chromatin immunoprecipitation 4′,6-diamidine-2′-phenylindole dihydrochloride kilobase pair The basic unit of chromatin in eukaryotes is the nucleosome. A nucleosome consists of 146 base pairs of DNA wrapped around an octamer of histone proteins H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 (1Luger K. Mäder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6991) Google Scholar). Although chromatin is a highly reiterative structure, cells create heterogeneity in the structure of nucleosomes to facilitate and regulate DNA-mediated processes such as transcription. Heterogeneity is created, in part, by posttranslational modifications of histone proteins, including acetylation, phosphorylation, methylation, ubiquitination, and ADP-ribosylation (2Mizzen C. Kuo M.H. Smith E. Brownell J. Zhou J. Ohba R. Wei Y. Monaco L. Sassone-Corsi P. Allis C.D. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant.

Chromatin: Structure and Function. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego1998Google Scholar). Acetylation status of the amino termini of histones H3 and H4, in particular, plays a important role in transcriptional regulation (2Mizzen C. Kuo M.H. Smith E. Brownell J. Zhou J. Ohba R. Wei Y.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 545-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). Heterogeneity in nucleosome structure also results from incorporation of variant histone proteins into the nucleosome. In contrast to the canonical histones, which are multicopy genes expressed during S-phase of the cell cycle, variant histones are encoded by single copy genes that differ in amino acid sequence from S-phase histones and whose expression is not limited to S-phase (6Zweidler A.

Pehrson J.R. Nature. 1998; 393: 599-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). These and other variants have been identified for histones H2A, H2B, and H3 but not H4. Histone variants are widespread, if not universal, in eukaryotes, yet how variant histones change nucleosome structure and how those changes affect relevant cellular processes have not been determined. H2A.F/Z is a family of H2A variants that are highly conserved across species and substantially divergent from S-phase H2A in any given species (16Jackson J.D. Falciano V.T. Gorovdky M.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 221: 466-467Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 17Jiang W. Guo X. Bhavanandan V.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 613-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). An H2A.F/Z variant has been identified in a wide variety of eukaryotes including Tetrahymena (hv1), budding yeast (HTA3 and HTZ1), Drosophila (D2, H2A.2, H2AvD, His2AvD, His2Av, and H2Av), chickens (H2A.F), mice (H2A.Z), and humans (H2A.Z) suggesting that incorporation of H2A.F/Z into chromatin is evolutionarily ancient and conserved. H2A.F/Z typically constitutes 5–10% of total H2A proteins in the chromatin of cells (18Palmer D. Snyder L.A. Blumenfeld M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2671-2675Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 19West M.H. Bonner W.M. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3238-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). H2A.F/Z is essential in Tetrahymena, Drosophila,and mice, but its essential function is not known (20van Dal A. Elgin S.C.R. Mol. Biol.

H2A.F/Z may play a role in transcriptional regulation since in Tetrahymena its expression is associated with the transcriptionally active macronucleus, and in Drosophila its incorporation into chromatin during development is coincident with the start of zygotic gene expression (23Clarkson M. Saint R.A. DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 24Stargell L.A. Bowen J. Dadd C.A. Dedon P.C. Davis M. Cook R.G. Allis C.D.

The chromosome loss phenotype caused by mutation to the H2A.F/Z homolog in fission yeast,pht1, suggests that H2A.F/Z could also play a role, directly or indirectly, in chromosome segregation (25Carr A.M. Dorrington S.M. Hindley J. Phear G.A. Aves S.J. Nurse P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 245: 628-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Determining the location of variant histones within chromosomes can provide insight into their function (12Meluh P.B. Yang P. Glowczewski L. Koshland D. Smith M.M.

To this end, the location of H2Av, the H2A.F/Z variant histone in Drosophila melanogaster, was determined in both polytene and diploid chromosomes in relation to transcriptionally active and inactive genes as well as noncoding sequences, and the results were compared with the localization of S-phase H2A. H2Av and H2A polyclonal antibodies were generated by injecting rabbits with synthetic peptides homologous to the carboxyl-terminal 15 amino acids of H2Av or H2A conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin via an added amino-terminal cysteine (Pierce). Serum was used for all experiments. Affinity purified antibody was generated for H2Av and gave identical results (data not shown). Immunolocalization of H2Av, H2A, and RNA polymerase II (pol II)1 to polytene chromosomes was done as described by Shopland and Lis (26Shopland L.S. Lis J.T. Chromosoma. 1996; 105: 158-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were H2Av or H2A rabbit antisera used at 1:1000 dilution and a mouse monoclonal antibody, 8WG16 (Babco), was used at a dilution of 1:20. 8WG16 recognizes the heptapeptide repeat of the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the large subunit of RNA pol II primarily in an unphosphorylated state (27Patturajan M. Schulte R.J. Sefton B.M. Berezney R. Vincent M. Bensaude O. Warren S.L. Corden J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4689-4694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In vivo 8WG16 can still bind phosphorylated pol II that is transcriptionally active if the CTD retains some unphosphorylated repeats but may not bind pol II when the CTD is completely phosphorylated (28Weeks J.R.

Secondary antibodies were goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to rhodamine used at a 1:50 dilution (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and goat anti-mouse IgG coupled to Cy2 used at a 1:150 dilution (The Jackson ImmunoResearch). Chromosomes were viewed on a Zeiss Axioscope fluorescence microscope with appropriate filters. Single and double exposure photographs were taken, and the photographic slides were scanned into the computer and prepared using Adobe Photoshop. Chromatin immunoprecipitations were done essentially as described by Orlandoet al. (30Orlando V. Strutt H. Paro R. Methods. 1997; 11: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). S2 cells were maintained in Drosophila serum-free medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 27 °C. 2–4 × 109 cells were cross-linked with formaldehyde for 10 min at 23 °C followed by 50 min on ice. Heat shock samples were heated to 36.5 °C for 1 h before being cross-linked with formaldehyde for 10 min at 36.5 °C followed by 50 min on ice. The cross-linked DNA was sheared by sonication to an average 1 kb in size and was purified by equilibrium sedimentation on a cesium chloride gradient. 30–60 μg of cross-link DNA was used per immunoprecipitation with 5 μl of H2Av antiserum, 5 μl of H2A antiserum, or 10 μl of an affinity purified, rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against the large subunit of pol II expressed in bacteria (31Champlin D.T.

After reversing the cross-links, the DNA was purified, quantitated using picogreen fluorescence (Molecular Probes), and analyzed by slot-blot hybridization. Hybridization signals were quantitated using stored phosphorimaging screens and ImagQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Levels of hybridization to immunoprecipitated DNA were measured relative to the level of hybridization observed to the same amount of total, non-precipitated DNA. The hsp70 probe was a 0.9-kb BamHI-SalI fragment isolated from plasmid 56H8 and is homologous to the 3′-half of all fivehsp70 genes (32Gilmour D.S. Lis J.T. Mol. Cell.

The bicoid probe was a 3.2-kb XbaI fragment isolated from plasmid pUCHSNeo8.7 and is homologous to the entire gene excluding 500 base pairs of the 5′ end (33Berleth T. Burri M. Thoma G. Bopp D.

The s19 chorion probe was a 1.5-kbEcoRV-EcoRI fragment isolated from plasmid pR7.7 and is homologous to the entire gene and 0.7 kb of 3′-flanking sequences (34Orr-Weaver T.L. Spradling A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4624-4633Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The satellite probe was a 424-base pair AseI fragment isolated from plasmid pHD-BPDp and is homologous to 1.688 satellite sequences on Dp(1;f)1187 (35Glaser R.L. Spradling A.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5068-5075Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). A polyclonal antibody was generated againstDrosophila H2Av to determine where this H2A.F/Z histone variant is located in chromosomes. The antibody recognized a 14.6-kDa protein present in nuclei of embryos and S2 tissue culture cells as well as in larval salivary glands (Fig.1). The protein was absent from larval imaginal disc cells homozygous for the His2Av 810null allele of the His2Av gene (20van Dal A. Elgin S.C.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 593-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) demonstrating that the 14.6-kDa protein is H2Av (Fig. 1). The antibody was used to localize H2Av in polytene chromosomes of third instar larval salivary glands by indirect immunofluorescence (Fig.2). H2Av was widely distributed in polytene chromosomes, being present in thousands of bands throughout the euchromatin, and was also present in the heterochromatic chromocenter (Fig. 2 a). Some level of fluorescence was detectable along virtually the entire length of each chromosome arm. Low levels of fluorescence were unlikely to be due to nonspecific background, since control antibodies, such as those to acetylated isoforms of histone H4, gave no detectable signal between strong bands of fluorescence. 2T. J. Leach, M. Mazzeo, H. L. Chotkowski, J. P. Madigan, M. G. Wotring, and R. L. Glaser, unpublished observations. Therefore, even low levels of immunofluorescence probably reflected the presence of H2Av. Earlier studies had also reported the banded appearance of H2Av localization in polytene chromosomes (20van Dal A. Elgin S.C.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 593-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 23Clarkson M. Saint R.A. DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Immunocytological studies of Drosophila histone H2A.2, which was likely to have been the same protein we now know to be H2Av, suggested that H2Av localization was limited to interband regions of the polytene chromosome, and therefore, H2Av might play a general role in determining the band-interband structure of polytene chromosomes (36Donahue P.R. Palmer D.K. Condie J.M. Sabatini L.M. Blumenfeld M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6878-6882Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was directly tested by double labeling chromosomes with the H2Av antibody and the DNA stain 4′,6-diamidine-2′-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI), which reveals the band-interband structure of the chromosome. H2Av localization was not limited to interband regions and showed a complex pattern of staining that did not correlate with the banded structure of the polytene chromosome (Fig. 2 b). Localization of H2Av, therefore, does not simply parallel the concentration of DNA along the polytene chromosome. To determine if H2Av localization was correlated with transcriptional activity, the pattern of H2Av staining was compared with sites of transcription by co-localizing pol II and H2Av (Fig. 2 c). Loci of elevated pol II immunofluorescence were found throughout the euchromatin with a limited number of loci having conspicuously higher pol II immunofluorescence identifying sites where pol II density and transcriptional activity were particularly high. It is likely that not all sites of transcriptional activity were detected because the antibody used, 8WG16, preferentially binds hypophosphorylated pol II (see “Experimental Procedures”). The distribution of H2Av immunofluorescence was generally more widespread than pol II with many loci containing H2Av but little or no pol II, and some loci contained equivalent levels of pol II and H2Av immunofluorescence (Fig.2 c). H2Av immunofluorescence was reduced at those loci containing the most pol II and presumably the highest levels of transcription (arrowheads in Fig. 2 c). Reductions in H2Av immunofluorescence were also observed at the hsp70heat shock loci after a 1-h heat shock of larvae, which produces high densities of pol II concomitant with transcriptional induction of the hsp70 genes (Fig. 2 d). No obvious reduction in H2Av immunofluorescence was observed at heat shock loci under nonheat shock conditions (data not shown), and the reduction in H2Av immunofluorescence observed after heat shock is likely to be transient, since no persistent change in H2Av immunofluorescence was observed at heat shock loci in larvae subject to daily heat shocks during earlier development (data not shown). Levels of H2Av immunofluorescence observed in polytene chromosomes might reflect not only the density of H2Av but also the influence of chromatin structure, such as the state of DNA condensation or decondensation associated with chromosome puffing. To avoid such complications and provide an alternative methodology for determining the distribution of H2Av in Drosophilachromosomes, chromatin immunoprecipitations (ChIP) were used to measure the association of H2Av with different types of DNA sequences in the diploid chromosomes of tissue culture cells. DNA:protein cross-links were generated by formaldehyde treatment of cells, and complexes were immunoprecipitated using H2Av antibodies. The immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed by slot-blot hybridization, and the hybridization signal was compared with the hybridization signal for a comparable mass of total, nonprecipitated DNA. A ChIP/total value of 1 means the sequence was neither enriched nor depleted relative to the abundance of the same sequence in totals. Negligible DNA was precipitated with preimmune sera or in no-antibody controls (Fig.3 a). Immunoprecipitations were initially done using an antibody to pol II and probing for the coding sequences of the hsp70,hsp26, and hsp83 heat shock genes to establish the validity of the protocol. Association of pol II with hsp70, hsp26, and hsp83 increased 44-, 22-, and 6-fold, respectively, after a 1-h heat shock (Fig. 3,a and b), consistent with earlier observations (32Gilmour D.S. Lis J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2009-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). mRNA levels for these genes also increased 43-, 23-, and 4-fold, respectively, after a 1-h heat shock (data not shown). Immunoprecipitations were then done using the H2Av antibodies, and the association of H2Av with a variety of gene sequences was measured (Fig.3 c). H2Av was associated with the constitutively expressedhsp83 and cytoplasmic actin genes, the uninduced and induced hsp70 and hsp26 genes, and the nonexpressed developmental bicoid and chorion s19genes (Fig. 3 c). H2Av was also associated with noncoding sequences 5′ and 3′ of both bicoid and hsp70(data not shown). Levels of H2Av on all sequences tested were similar with ChIP/total ratios around 1, suggesting that H2Av is fairly uniformly distributed in chromatin irrespective of whether a sequence is transcribed, potentially transcribed, or noncoding. H2Av was even associated with heterochromatic satellite sequences, although at lower levels (Fig. 3 c), suggesting that some amount of H2Av is present even in heterochromatin, a conclusion consistent with localization of H2Av to the heterochromatic chromocenter of polytene chromosomes (Fig. 2 a). Comparison of H2Av immunoprecipitations from normal versusheat shock cells suggested that transcription causes H2Av to cross-link less frequently to DNA (Fig. 3 c). In uninduced cells, H2Av was associated with all three heat shock genes (Fig. 3 c). After transcription was induced by heat shock, immunoprecipitation levels for all three genes decreased as follows: 1.7-fold for hsp70, 1.5-fold for hsp26, and 1.4-fold for hsp83 (Fig. 3 c). Immunoprecipitation levels for the actin genes appeared to increase after heat shock, which would be consistent with the decrease in transcription that occurs to these genes (32Gilmour D.S. Lis J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2009-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). These results suggest that transcription causes H2Av to be less frequently or less tightly associated with DNA, a conclusion consistent with the reduced immunofluorescence observed at actively transcribed loci in polytene chromosomes (Fig. 2 c). S-phase H2A is likely to be uniformly distributed in chromosomes and therefore provides a good control for the pattern of H2Av localization. A polyclonal antibody was generated against the carboxyl-terminal 15 amino acids of H2A. The antibody recognized a single nuclear protein on Western blots that migrated at the position of bulk H2A protein (Fig. 4 a). The antibody was used to localize H2A in polytene chromosomes of third instar larval salivary glands by indirect immunofluorescence. H2A immunofluorescence paralleled precisely the banded structure of the chromosome revealed by DAPI staining (Fig. 4 b). This result agrees with earlier studies (37Kurth P.D. Moudrianakis E.N. Bustin M. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 78: 910-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and is consistent with a uniform distribution of H2A-containing nucleosomes along the chromosome paralleling the density of DNA. The H2A result contrasts markedly with the complex immunofluorescence pattern observed for H2Av, which did not correlate with the banded structure of the chromosome (compare Figs.2 b and 4 b). The distribution of H2A was also determined in diploid chromosomes by chromatin immunoprecipitation. H2A and H2Av immunoprecipitations were done in parallel on the same preparations of cross-linked DNA (Fig.4 c). Nearly identical amounts hsp70 sequences were precipitated by both antibodies, and the same transcription-induced reduction in DNA association was observed between uninduced and heat shock-induced samples. In contrast, H2A and H2Av antibodies precipitated different amounts of s19 and satellite sequences (Fig. 4 c). The H2A antibody precipitated about the same amount of DNA from both the unexpressed s19gene and 1.688 satellite sequences, whereas the H2Av antibody precipitated 1.6-fold less s19 and 5-fold less satellite DNA. These differences suggest that H2Av is less abundant on these sequences. The distribution of H2Av appears to be widespread in the Drosophila genome. Some level of H2Av immunofluorescence was detectable along virtually the entire length of each polytene chromosome (Fig. 2). In addition, every DNA sequence tested was immunoprecipitated by the H2Av antibody at levels significantly above background irrespective of the transcriptional status or coding capacity of the sequence (Fig. 3).2 Thus, the immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation results suggest that H2Av-containing nucleosomes are widespread, if not ubiquitous, in the genome. The distribution of H2Av along the length of the chromosome, however, also appears to vary. The banded pattern of H2Av immunofluorescence was complex and did not simply parallel the concentration of DNA, as was the case for H2A (Figs. 2 b and4 b), and significantly different amounts of s19and satellite sequences were precipitated by the H2Av and H2A antibodies (Fig. 4 c). Thus, the immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation results also suggest that the density of H2Av-containing nucleosomes is different on different sequences. H2A.Z variant histones are likely to be involved in transcriptional regulation. H2A.Z is associated with transcriptionally active nuclei in both Tetrahymena and Drosophila (23Clarkson M. Saint R.A. DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 24Stargell L.A. Bowen J. Dadd C.A. Dedon P.C. Davis M. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. Gorovsky M.A. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2641-2651Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and recent genetic evidence suggests that H2A.Z regulates transcription in budding yeast. 3M. Smith, personal communication. The distribution of H2Av in Drosophila chromosomes appeared to correlate with transcriptional potential, in general, but not necessarily with specific sites of active transcription. For example, by comparison to H2A, noncoding satellite sequences had the least H2Av, the coding but nonexpressed s19 gene had more H2Av, and the inducible hsp70 gene had the most H2Av (Fig. 4 c). In contrast, there was little difference in H2Av immunoprecipitation levels between the constitutively expressed hsp83 and actin genes and the nonexpressed bicoid and s19 genes (Fig. 3 c). In addition, sites of active transcription in polytene chromosomes were not sites of elevated H2Av immunofluorescence (Fig. 2 c). So even if H2Av is involved in transcriptional regulation, its incorporation into chromatin does not appear to be transcription-dependent. H2Av is therefore unlikely to act as a replacement histone that replaces H2A lost from actively transcribed genes (38Jackson V. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 719-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Similarly, mammalian H2A.Z also fails to accumulate in chromatin of nondividing rat neurons as would be expected of a replacement histone (39Piña B. Suau P. Dev. Biol. 1987; 123: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). If transcription is not responsible for the incorporation of H2Av into chromatin, then what is the origin of H2Av's widespread but nonrandom pattern of localization? H2Av could be localized throughout the genome, including heterochromatic sequences, if it were incorporated into nucleosomes during DNA replication. If this were the case, however, H2Av-containing nucleosomes would need to be preferentially assembled onto some sequences, like euchromatic genes, versus other sequences, like satellite repeats, to create the observed variations in H2Av density. Alternatively, H2Av incorporation during S-phase could be stochastic if mechanisms exist that could subsequently change the level of H2Av on specific sequences in the context of pre-existing chromatin. The function of H2Av is likely to involve conformational changes to the structure of the nucleosome. The αC helix region of H2Av is required for H2Av function and is the only region of H2Av for which the amino acid sequence of H2A cannot be substituted without loss of function (40Clarkson M.J. Wells J.R.E. Gibson F. Saint R. Tremethick D.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 694-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The αC helix of H2Av along with the α3 helix and carboxyl-terminal tail forms a “docking” domain that interacts with the carboxyl-terminal tail of H4 within the core of the nucleosome and might be expected to influence the conformational stability of the nucleosome (1Luger K. Mäder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6991) Google Scholar). Transcription-induced changes in nucleosome structure are likely to be the cause of reductions in hsp70immunoprecipitation levels observed after heat shock (Figs3 c and 4 c). An earlier cross-linking analysis of histone associations with the hsp70 genes suggested that transcription causes a conformation change in nucleosome structure that results in reduced cross-linking of histone globular domains to DNA, whereas cross-linking of tail domains is unaffected (41Nacheva G.A. Guschin D.Y. Preobrazhenskaya O.B. Karpov V.L. Ebralidse K.K. Mirzabekov A.D. Cell. 1989; 58: 27-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). This particular transcription-induced alteration in nucleosome structure appeared to be the same for H2Av-containing and H2A-containing nucleosomes since equivalent reductions in immunoprecipitation levels were observed using both antibodies (Fig. 4 c). Although this result did not reveal a unique aspect of H2Av function, it is still possible that quantitative differences between the H2Av and H2A immunoprecipitations were obscured by the very high levels of hsp70 transcription induced by heat shock and that important differences in the behavior of H2Av-containing and H2A-containing nucleosomes might be revealed at lower levels of transcription or on different, developmentally regulated genes.

https://openalex.org/W2024505421,"Bid is a proapoptotic, BH3-domain-only member of the Bcl-2 family. In Fas-induced apoptosis, Bid is activated through cleavage by caspase 8 into a 15.5-kDa C-terminal fragment (tcBid) and a 6.5 kDa N-terminal fragment (tnBid). Following the cleavage, tcBid translocates to the mitochondria and promotes the release of cytochromec into the cytosol by a mechanism that is not understood. Here we report that recombinant tcBid can act as a membrane destabilizing agent. tcBid induces destabilization and breaking of planar lipid bilayers without appearance of ionic channels; its destabilizing activity is comparable with that of Bax and at least 30-fold higher than that of full-length Bid. Consistently, tcBid, but not full-length Bid, permeabilizes liposomes at physiological pH. The destabilizing effect of tcBid on liposomes and planar bilayers is independent of the BH3 domain. In contrast, mutations in the BH3 domain impair tcBid ability to induce cytochrome c release from mitochondria. The permeabilizing effect of tcBid on planar bilayers, liposomes, and mitochondria can be inhibited by tnBid. In conclusion, our results suggest a dual role for Bid: BH3-independent membrane destabilization and BH3-dependent interaction with other proteins.

The proteins of the Bcl-2 family regulate this process (3Fadeel B. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1647-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 4Gross A. McDonnell J.M.

Members of the Bcl-2 family are pro- or antiapoptotic and possess one or several of the Bcl-2 homology (BH)1 domains. Bid is a proapoptotic, BH3-domain-only member of the Bcl-2 family. When expressed in Jurkat cells or transfected in fibroblasts, it induces apoptosis (5Wang K. Yin X.M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Recently, Bid-deficient mice have been shown to be resistant to Fas-induced hepatocellular apoptosis (6Yin X.M. Wang K. Gross A. Zhao Y. Zinkel S. Klocke B. Roth K.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1999; 400: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). Bid is a cytosolic protein in nonapoptotic cells, present in a variety of tissues (5Wang K. Yin X.M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J.

Upon induction of certain types of apoptosis, Bid is cleaved by caspase 8, and its C-terminal fragment translocates to the mitochondria (7Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X.

According to the x-ray structure, cleavage of Bid unmasks a large hydrophobic surface in its C-terminal fragment (10McDonnell J.M. Fushman D. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cowburn D.

Cell. 1999; 96: 615-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The C-terminal fragment of Bid (called tcBid) is regarded as the active form. It is far more potent in inducing apoptosis than FL Bid (7Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3061) Google Scholar, 9Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3765) Google Scholar), and it can be inhibited by coexpression of the N-terminal fragment (tnBid) (12Tan K.O. Tan K.M. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23687-23690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).Bid is believed to exert its proapoptotic effect by inducing the release of proapoptotic factors (cytochrome c, apoptosis-inducing factor, and procaspase 9) from mitochondria. Incubation of subnanomolar concentrations of tcBid with isolated mitochondria results in a complete release of cytochromec (7Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3061) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown that Bid partially permeabilizes the outer mitochondrial membrane and causes the release of several proteins from the intermembrane space (13Kluck R.M. Esposti M.D. Perkins G. Renken C. Kuwana T. Bossy-Wetzel E. Goldberg M. Allen T. Barber M.J. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 809-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). A major controversy is whether Bid acts by itself or through modulation of other Bcl-2 family proteins.In vitro binding and mutagenesis experiments support the hypothesis that Bid acts by regulating other Bcl-2 family proteins. FL Bid can bind Bax, Bcl-XL, and Bcl-2 (5Wang K. Yin X.M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). When the BH3 domain of Bid is mutated so that it no longer binds Bax, FL Bid fails to promote apoptosis (5Wang K. Yin X.M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Consistently, FL Bid is over 10 times less active in releasing cytochrome c from Bax−/−mitochondria than from wild type mitochondria. Moreover, FL Bid induces a conformational change in Bax, which correlates with the release of cytochrome c (14Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Nichols A. Eskes R. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Maundrell K.

Desagher, personal communication.and for Bcl-XL (7Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3061) Google Scholar, 9Li H.

It has been proposed that once Bid is cleaved, tcBid binds Bcl-XL and inhibits its antiapoptotic activity.Along with the data suggesting the importance of interaction with other proteins, there is increasing evidence for the possibility that Bid may directly permeabilize mitochondrial membranes. Recently, the channel-forming activity of Bid in synthetic lipid bilayers has been reported (16Schendel S.L. Azimov R. Godzik A. Kagan B.L. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21932-21936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Channel-forming activity has already been observed with other Bcl-2 family proteins (for a review see Ref. 17Schendel S.L. Montal M. Reed J.C. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the channels formed by pro- and antiapoptotic proteins do not seem to differ significantly. However, in a striking paper, Basanez et al. (18Basanez G. Nechushtan A. Drozhinin O. Chanturiya A. Choe E Tutt S. Wood K.A. Hsu Y. Zimmerberg J. Youle R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5492-5497Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) have shown that Bax, but not Bcl-XL, decreases the lifetime of planar lipid bilayers. They proposed that this effect was due to a decrease of the linear tension of the bilayers. In mitochondria, this would lead to the formation of lipidic holes, allowing the release of cytochrome c. Here we describe a similar membrane destabilizing effect specific to tcBid. We also show that tcBid activity is inhibited by the N-terminal Bid fragment. We discuss the role of the conserved BH3 domain in Bid activity. Apoptosis is a process by which unnecessary or damaged cells are eliminated in multicellular organisms (1Kerr J.F. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12725) Google Scholar, 2Li H. Yuan J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). After the induction of apoptosis, cells enter the effector phase, in which they are either rescued or committed to death. The proteins of the Bcl-2 family regulate this process (3Fadeel B. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1647-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 4Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3238) Google Scholar). Members of the Bcl-2 family are pro- or antiapoptotic and possess one or several of the Bcl-2 homology (BH)1 domains. Bid is a proapoptotic, BH3-domain-only member of the Bcl-2 family. When expressed in Jurkat cells or transfected in fibroblasts, it induces apoptosis (5Wang K. Yin X.M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Recently, Bid-deficient mice have been shown to be resistant to Fas-induced hepatocellular apoptosis (6Yin X.M. Wang K. Gross A. Zhao Y. Zinkel S. Klocke B. Roth K.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1999; 400: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). Bid is a cytosolic protein in nonapoptotic cells, present in a variety of tissues (5Wang K. Yin X.M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Upon induction of certain types of apoptosis, Bid is cleaved by caspase 8, and its C-terminal fragment translocates to the mitochondria (7Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3061) Google Scholar, 8Gross A. Yin X.M. Wang K. Wei M.C. Jockel J. Milliman C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Korsmeyer S.J. J.

Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3765) Google Scholar). According to the x-ray structure, cleavage of Bid unmasks a large hydrophobic surface in its C-terminal fragment (10McDonnell J.M. Fushman D. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cowburn D. Cell. 1999; 96: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar,11Chou J.J. Li H. Salvesen G.S. Yuan J. Wagner G. Cell. 1999; 96: 615-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The C-terminal fragment of Bid (called tcBid) is regarded as the active form. It is far more potent in inducing apoptosis than FL Bid (7Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3061) Google Scholar, 9Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3765) Google Scholar), and it can be inhibited by coexpression of the N-terminal fragment (tnBid) (12Tan K.O. Tan K.M. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23687-23690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Bid is believed to exert its proapoptotic effect by inducing the release of proapoptotic factors (cytochrome c, apoptosis-inducing factor, and procaspase 9) from mitochondria. Incubation of subnanomolar concentrations of tcBid with isolated mitochondria results in a complete release of cytochromec (7Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3061) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown that Bid partially permeabilizes the outer mitochondrial membrane and causes the release of several proteins from the intermembrane space (13Kluck R.M. Esposti M.D. Perkins G. Renken C. Kuwana T. Bossy-Wetzel E. Goldberg M. Allen T. Barber M.J. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 809-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). A major controversy is whether Bid acts by itself or through modulation of other Bcl-2 family proteins. In vitro binding and mutagenesis experiments support the hypothesis that Bid acts by regulating other Bcl-2 family proteins. FL Bid can bind Bax, Bcl-XL, and Bcl-2 (5Wang K. Yin X.M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). When the BH3 domain of Bid is mutated so that it no longer binds Bax, FL Bid fails to promote apoptosis (5Wang K. Yin X.M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Consistently, FL Bid is over 10 times less active in releasing cytochrome c from Bax−/−mitochondria than from wild type mitochondria. Moreover, FL Bid induces a conformational change in Bax, which correlates with the release of cytochrome c (14Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Nichols A. Eskes R. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Maundrell K. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar, 15Eskes R. Desagher S. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). tcBid has a higher affinity than FL Bid for Bax 2S. Desagher, personal communication. 2S. Desagher, personal communication.and for Bcl-XL (7Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3061) Google Scholar, 9Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3765) Google Scholar, 12Tan K.O. Tan K.M. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23687-23690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that once Bid is cleaved, tcBid binds Bcl-XL and inhibits its antiapoptotic activity. Along with the data suggesting the importance of interaction with other proteins, there is increasing evidence for the possibility that Bid may directly permeabilize mitochondrial membranes. Recently, the channel-forming activity of Bid in synthetic lipid bilayers has been reported (16Schendel S.L. Azimov R. Godzik A. Kagan B.L. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21932-21936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Channel-forming activity has already been observed with other Bcl-2 family proteins (for a review see Ref. 17Schendel S.L. Montal M. Reed J.C. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the channels formed by pro- and antiapoptotic proteins do not seem to differ significantly. However, in a striking paper, Basanez et al. (18Basanez G. Nechushtan A. Drozhinin O. Chanturiya A. Choe E Tutt S. Wood K.A. Hsu Y. Zimmerberg J. Youle R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5492-5497Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) have shown that Bax, but not Bcl-XL, decreases the lifetime of planar lipid bilayers. They proposed that this effect was due to a decrease of the linear tension of the bilayers. In mitochondria, this would lead to the formation of lipidic holes, allowing the release of cytochrome c. Here we describe a similar membrane destabilizing effect specific to tcBid. We also show that tcBid activity is inhibited by the N-terminal Bid fragment. We discuss the role of the conserved BH3 domain in Bid activity. We thank Dr. J. Shaw for critical reading of the manuscript and C. Hebert for artwork."

In this study, we investigated the activation of ERK by ONOO− in cultured rat lung myofibroblasts. Western blot analysis using anti-phospho-ERK antibodies along with an ERK kinase assay using thephosphorylated heat- andacid-stable protein (PHAS-1) substrate demonstrated that ERK activation peaked within 15 min after ONOO− treatment and was maximally activated with 100 μm ONOO−. Activation of ERK by ONOO− and H2O2 was blocked by the antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine. Catalase blocked ERK activation by H2O2, but not by ONOO−, demonstrating that the effect of ONOO−was not due to the generation of H2O2. Both H2O2 and ONOO− induced phosphorylation of EGFR in Western blot experiments using an anti-phospho-EGFR antibody. However, the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG1478 abolished ERK activation by H2O2, but not by ONOO−. Both H2O2 and ONOO− activated Raf-1. However, the Raf inhibitor forskolin blocked ERK activation by H2O2, but not by ONOO−. The MEK inhibitor PD98059 inhibited ERK activation by both H2O2 and ONOO−. Moreover, ONOO− or H2O2 caused a cytotoxic response of myofibroblasts that was prevented by preincubation with PD98059. In a cell-free kinase assay, ONOO− (but not H2O2) induced autophosphorylation and nitration of a glutathioneS-transferase-MEK-1 fusion protein. Collectively, these data indicate that ONOO− activates EGFR and Raf-1, but these signaling intermediates are not required for ONOO−-induced ERK activation. However, MEK-1 activation is required for ONOO−-induced ERK activation in myofibroblasts. In contrast, H2O2-induced ERK activation is dependent on EGFR activation, which then leads to downstream Raf-1 and MEK-1 activation.

Pou S. Ramos C.L. Cohen M.S. Britigan B.E. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 200-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Moreover, nitric oxide (NO⋅) is synthesized by inflammatory cells and has the potential to react with O⨪2 via a nearly diffusion-limited reaction to form peroxynitrite (ONOO−) (2.Beckman J.S. Koppenol W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1424-C1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Carreras M.C. Pargament G.A. Catz S.D. Poderoso J.J. Boveris A.

Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 446-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). These oxidants may serve several physiological or pathophysiological functions. For example, NO⋅ is thought to play a major role in host defense, but is also presumed to contribute to tissue injury (2.Beckman J.S. Koppenol W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1424-C1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). H2O2 and O⨪2released into the extracellular environment by mononuclear cells during an oxidative burst may also play a role in immune defense (1.Rosen G.M. Pou S. Ramos C.L. Cohen M.S. Britigan B.E. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 200-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). ONOO− is a potent cytotoxic species that has been proposed to contribute to the pathophysiology of a wide variety of inflammatory diseases. Although ONOO− is extremely short-lived at physiological pH (1-s half-life) (6.Zhu L. Gunn C. Beckman J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 298: 452-457Crossref Scopus (420) Google Scholar), the formation of 3-nitrotyrosine by ONOO− reaction with tyrosyl residues serves as a stable marker or “footprint” (7.Tanaka S. Choe N. Hemenway D.R. Zhu S. Matalon S. Kagan E. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 8.Haddad I.Y. Pataki G. Hu P. Galliani C. Beckman J.S. Matalon S. J.

Care Med. 1997; 155: 1763-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). ONOO− not only affects tyrosine residues on proteins, but also may induce oxidative reaction products through modifications of cysteine, methionine, and tryptophan (4.Pryor W.A. Squadrito G.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L699-L722PubMed Google Scholar). Increasing evidence supports the idea that oxidants serve as signaling intermediates required for receptor tyrosine kinase function and downstream activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs).1 In particular, H2O2 generated intracellularly following the binding of platelet-derived growth factor or epidermal growth factor (EGF) to their respective receptors appears to reversibly inhibit protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity, which is required for phosphorylation of receptor tyrosine kinases (10.Sundaresan M., Yu, Z.-X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2322) Google Scholar, 11.Bae Y.S. Kang S.W. Seo M.S. Baines I.C. Tekle E. Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 217-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). In the absence of EGF, exogenous H2O2 alone can cause phosphorylation of EGFR through reversible oxidative modification of cysteine residues, leading to downstream activation of a Raf/MEK/MAPK phosphorylation cascade (12.Guyton K.Z.

Biol. 1998; 19: 324-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In contrast, ONOO−stimulates phosphorylation of EGFR tyrosine residues by causing irreversible dimerization of EGFR via dityrosine cross-links (15.van der Vliet A. Hristova M. Cross C.E. Eiserich J.P. Goldkorn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31860-31866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). More recently, several nitric oxide-related species, including ONOO−, have been reported to activate MAPKs (16.Lander H.M. Jocavina A.T. Davis R.J. Tauras J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19705-19709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 17.Oh-hashi K. Maruyama W. Yi H. Takahashi T. Naoi M. Isobe K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 504-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 18.Schieke S.M. Brivida K. Klotz L.-O. Sies H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 301-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), yet the mechanism of MAPK activation by ONOO− remains unclear. MAPKs are a family of serine/threonine kinases that regulate a diversity of cellular activities. Three major classes have been described: extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs; also known as stress-activated protein kinases), and p38 MAPK (reviewed in Ref. 19.Davis R.J. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). JNKs and p38 MAPKs mediate signals in response to cytokines and environmental stress, whereas the ERK subtypes are classically recognized as key transducers in the signaling cascade mediating cell proliferation in response to growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor and EGF. Two major isoforms of ERK, p44 (ERK-1) and p42 (ERK-2), have been identified in mammalian systems. A major pathway involved in ERK-1 and -2 phosphorylation in a variety of cell types requires the sequential activation of Raf and MEK (20.Kyriakis J.M. App H. Zhang X.F. Banerjee P. Brautigan D.L. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1992; 358: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar, 21.MacDonald S.G. Crews C.M. Wu L. Driller J. Clark R. Erikson L. McCormick F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6615-6620Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). It is becoming increasingly clear that the ERK pathway, like those of p38 and JNK, is activated by environmental stress, including reactive oxygen species such as H2O2 (12.Guyton K.Z. Liu Y. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4138-4142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). In this study, we have investigated the mechanism of ONOO−-induced ERK-1 and -2 activation. Similar to previous studies on the mechanism of H2O2-induced ERK activation, we found that ONOO− activates EGFR, Raf-1, and MEK-1. However, unlike H2O2, which requires EGFR phosphorylation to initiate a downstream signaling cascade for activation of ERK, we report that ONOO− induces autophosphorylation of EGFR, Raf-1, and MEK-1 independently. Primary passage rat pulmonary myofibroblasts were isolated and characterized as described previously (22.Coin P.G. Lindroos P.M. Bird G.S.J. Osornio-Vargas A.R. Roggli V.L. Bonner J.C. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4797-4806PubMed Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated these cells to be positive for markers of smooth muscle cells (α-smooth muscle actin and desmin) and fibroblasts (vimentin), indicating a myofibroblast phenotype (23.Bonner J.C. Lindroos P.M. Rice A.B. Moomaw C.R. Morgan D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: L72-L80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following the isolation procedure, aliquots of cells (1 × 106/ml) were stored in liquid nitrogen. Cells (1 × 106) were thawed from the liquid nitrogen and plated in a 175-cm2 flask in 10% fetal bovine serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with l-glutamine and Fungizone. After reaching confluence, the cells were liberated with trypsin, replated on 100-mm dishes, and grown to confluence in 10% fetal bovine serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. At this point, the cells were designated as passage 2. Cells were then rendered quiescent for 24 h with serum-free defined medium (SFDM) consisting of Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 0.25% bovine serum albumin and an insulin/transferrin/selenium mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for the experiments described below. Peroxynitrite was synthesized from acidified nitrite and hydrogen peroxide (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Stocks of ONOO− were stored in 1.2n NaOH at −80 °C. Prior to experimentation, ONOO− was quantitated spectrophotometrically (extinction coefficient at 302 nm = 1670m−1 cm−1) (24.Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells in SFDM were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then equilibrated in PBS for 5 min. ONOO− was delivered as a single bolus (e.g. 10 μl of 100 mm stock delivered in 1 ml to give a final concentration of 1 mm) against one side of the dish while rapidly swirling the medium to assure optimal exposure of the cells to ONOO− before decomposition (15.van der Vliet A. Hristova M. Cross C.E. Eiserich J.P. Goldkorn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31860-31866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 25.Shin J.T. Barbeito L. MacMillan-Crow L.A. Beckman J.S. Thompson J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 335: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In control experiments, ONOO− was prediluted for 1 min in an equivalent volume of PBS prior to adding to the cells. This “delayed” PBS solution contained completely decomposed ONOO− as determined spectrophotometrically, but still contained contaminants such as nitrite and nitrate (24.Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In other control experiments, cells were treated with equal volumes of 1.2n NaOH (vehicle control). PBS, rather than SFDM, was used as the medium for ONOO− treatments to avoid interfering reactions of ONOO− with media constituents. Confluent cell monolayers on 100-mm dishes were growth-arrested in serum-free medium for 24 h prior to treatment with ONOO−, H2O2, or metabolic inhibitors. Cells were washed twice with PBS, scraped, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 20 μg/ml pepstatin), and clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. Thirty μg of protein/sample was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and blocked for 2 h at 25 °C with 0.5% nonfat milk in PBS buffer (20 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, and 0.01% Tween 20). The membrane was then incubated overnight at 4 °C with an appropriate dilution of anti-phospho-ERK or anti-ERK (New England Biolabs Inc.), anti-phospho-MEK-1 or anti-MEK-1 (New England Biolabs Inc.), or anti-phospho-EGFR or anti-EGFR (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) polyclonal antibody at 4 °C overnight, followed by incubation for 2 h with a 1:2000 dilution of the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The immunoblot signal was visualized through enhanced chemiluminescence. ERK activity in cell lysates was measured as described previously (26.Lindroos P.M. Rice A.B. Wang Y.-Z. Bonner J.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3464-3468PubMed Google Scholar) by phosphorylation of PHAS-1, a substrate for ERK (27.Lin T.A. Kong X. Haystead T.A. Pause A. Belsham G. Sonenberg N. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Science. 1994; 266: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent cell monolayers on 100-mm dishes were growth-arrested in serum-free medium for 24 h, treated with ONOO−, chilled on ice, washed twice with PBS, and scraped with 800 μl of lysis buffer. ERK was immunoprecipitated by incubating 200 μl of lysate with 2 μg of anti-ERK antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for 2 h and then adding 20 μl of protein A-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). After an overnight incubation at 0–4 °C with end-over-end mixing, the immune complex was recovered by centrifugation and washed three times with lysis buffer and once with 250 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, and 200 μmNa3VO4. Immune complex kinase assays were performed using a MAPK assay kit (Stratagene). The ERK pellets were resuspended in Stratagene reaction buffer containing 120 μg of PHAS-1 substrate along with 3–5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in a final volume of 180 μl. Kinase reactions took place for 30 min at room temperature and were stopped by adding 4× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis reducing sample buffer and boiling for 10 min. ERK-PHAS samples were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, dried, and autoradiographed. Raf-1 kinase activity was measured by immunoprecipitation with an anti-Raf-1 antibody followed by a phosphorylation assay using bacterially expressed, kinase-inactive MEK-1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) as the substrate. The lysis buffer consisted of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml pepstatin, 200 μm Na3VO4, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were incubated with antibody for 90 min at 4 °C, and protein A-agarose beads were then added for an additional 30 min to immunoprecipitate Raf-1. Pellets were washed and resuspended in 20 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm PIPES (pH 7.0), 10 mm MnCl2, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 200 μmNa3VO4) containing 1 ng of kinase-inactive MEK-1 and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Raf-activated MEK-1 was resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, dried, and autoradiographed. This assay was a modification of a previously reported method (21.MacDonald S.G. Crews C.M. Wu L. Driller J. Clark R. Erikson L. McCormick F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6615-6620Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Recombinant non-activated GST-MEK-1 (0.5 μg; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) was diluted in 20 μl of assay dilution buffer (20 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mmdithiothreitol) supplemented with a magnesium/ATP mixture (75 mm magnesium chloride and 500 μm unlabeled ATP). An increasing concentration of ONOO− (1–1000 μm) was added to the solution and incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol. Activated GST-MEK-1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) was loaded on gels as a positive control. As an additional control, activated GST-Raf-1 was incubated with non-activated GST-MEK-1. Phosphorylation of GST-MEK-1 was detected by Western blotting using an anti-phospho-MEK-1 antibody. Western blots were stripped and reblotted using an anti-nitrotyrosine antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Confluent rat lung myofibroblasts on 24-well tissue culture plates were rendered quiescent in SFDM for 24 h; then the medium was switched to PBS, and ONOO− (1–1000 μm) was added to the medium with constant swirling. After 15 min, the medium was removed, and fresh SFDM containing 5 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added back. After 24 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and humidified air, the cells were rinsed three times with SFDM and chilled on ice for 30 min. The medium was removed, and 5% trichloroacetic acid (0.5 ml/well) was added for 10 min. After removing the trichloroacetic acid, the cells were washed three times with ice-cold water and solubilized with a solution of 1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% NaOH. Radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter. Cytotoxicity was measured by the MTT cell viability assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Since ONOO− has an extremely short half-life at neutral pH (∼1 s) (6.Zhu L. Gunn C. Beckman J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 298: 452-457Crossref Scopus (420) Google Scholar), we assessed ERK activation in cultures of pulmonary myofibroblasts that received ONOO−immediately as compared with cell cultures that received ONOO− that had first been allowed to incubate (i.e. delayed) in PBS for 1 min at pH 7.4. The immediate addition strategy was performed by delivering a single bolus of the ONOO− stock against the side of the dish while swirling the PBS solution to allow for mixing. Direct addition resulted in strong ERK activation, whereas the delay of ONOO− in PBS for 1 min caused no activation of ERK (Fig.1). This experiment was essential for demonstrating that ERK activation was due to ONOO− and not to trace amounts of H2O2, which is relatively stable at pH 7.4. Furthermore, this experiment ruled out the formation of stable nitrating agents that could potentially be formed by the reaction of ONOO− with components of the cell culture medium. The addition of the same volume of 1.2 n NaOH alone to PBS (10 μl/1 ml), either immediately or delayed, did not cause ERK activation (data not shown). Treatment of cells with 1 mm ONOO− activated ERK maximally within 15 min as determined by Western blotting using an anti-phospho-ERK antibody or by an ERK kinase assay using the PHAS-1 substrate (Fig.2 A). Phospho-ERK Western blotting and PHAS-1 experiments performed with increasing concentrations of ONOO− (1–1000 μm) showed that maximal activation of ERK was reached at 100 μm(Fig. 2 B). In these experiments, Western blotting with an antibody that detects unphosphorylated ERK was used to show that ERK protein levels did not change appreciably as a consequence of ONOO− treatment. H2O2 also maximally activated ERK at 100 μm (data not shown). The concentrations of ONOO− or H2O2required to activate ERK in our study were within the micromolar range reported by other investigators for activation of cellular signaling pathways (12.Guyton K.Z.

To determine if ONOO−-induced ERK activation was due to the presence of H2O2, cells were preincubated with catalase (3000 units/ml) for 1 h and then treated with either ONOO− or H2O2 for 15 or 30 min. H2O2-induced ERK activation was completely inhibited by catalase, whereas ONOO−-induced ERK activation was not affected (Fig. 3).N-Acetyl-l-cysteine has been reported to block the effects of both H2O2 (11.Bae Y.S.

Pretreatment of cells with 50 mm N-acetyl-l-cysteine for 1 h prior to adding oxidants inhibited both ONOO−- and H2O2-induced ERK activation (Fig. 3). We observed that EGF, ONOO−, and H2O2 induced phosphorylation of EGFR as determined by Western blotting using an antibody specific for phospho-EGFR (Fig.4 A). Moreover, the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG1478 (31.Rice A.B. Moomaw C.R. Morgan D.L. Bonner J.C. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 213-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) abolished phosphorylation of EGFR induced by all of these agents (Fig. 4 A). However, although AG1478 significantly inhibited ERK activation induced by EGF and H2O2, AG1478 did not significantly inhibit ERK activation induced by ONOO− (Fig. 4, B andC). Using a Raf-1 kinase assay that utilized MEK-1 as the substrate, we observed that both H2O2 and ONOO− stimulated Raf-1-dependent phosphorylation of MEK-1 (Fig.5 A). Furthermore, activation of Raf-1 by both of these oxidants was blocked by pretreatment with forskolin (Fig. 5 A). Pretreatment of cells with forskolin prior to the addition of oxidant significantly blocked H2O2-induced ERK activation in phospho-ERK Western blot assays, yet forskolin did not affect ONOO−-induced ERK activation (Fig. 5, B andC). Pretreatment of cells with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (50 μm) (32.Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar) abolished activation of ERK induced by either ONOO− or H2O2 in phospho-ERK Western blot experiments (Fig. 6). Accordingly, the MEK inhibitor blocked the phosphorylation of MEK-1 by either ONOO− or H2O2 in Western blot experiments using an anti-phospho-MEK-1 antibody. To further investigate the mechanism through which ONOO−phosphorylates MEK-1, we treated recombinant non-activated GST-MEK-1 with ONOO− in a buffer solution containing a magnesium/ATP mixture and performed Western blotting using an anti-phospho-MEK-1 antibody or an anti-nitrotyrosine antibody. As shown in Fig.7, ONOO− induced phosphorylation of GST-MEK-1. Moreover, ONOO− caused a concentration-dependent increase in nitrotyrosine formation on GST-MEK-1 (Fig. 7). These experiments provide, for the first time, evidence of a direct biochemical modification of MEK-1 by ONOO− that results in autophosphorylation. In parallel experiments, H2O2 did not phosphorylate GST-MEK-1 in this cell-free system (data not shown). Non-activated Raf-1 was not commercially available to perform a similar type of experiment. However, lysates from ONOO−- and H2O2-treated cells were immunoprecipitated with the anti-nitrotyrosine antibody, and Western blotting was performed using an anti-phospho-Raf-1 antibody. Phosphorylated Raf-1 was co-immunoprecipitated with the anti-nitrotyrosine antibody from lysates of ONOO−-treated cells, but not from lysates of H2O2-treated cells (data not shown). To address the biological relevance of ONOO−-induced MAPK activation, we sought to determine first whether ONOO− caused mitogenesis of rat lung myofibroblasts using a [3H]thymidine incorporation assay. As shown in Fig. 8 A, recombinant EGF (50 ng/ml) caused a severalfold increase in [3H]thymidine uptake. However, ONOO− caused a concentration-dependent decrease in [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig. 8 A). Interestingly, the decrease in [3H]thymidine incorporation caused by ONOO− treatment was prevented by pretreatment of cells with 50 μm PD98059 for 1 h prior to the addition of ONOO− (Fig. 8 B). Since the decrease in mitogenesis by ONOO− suggested a cytotoxic effect, we utilized the MTT assay to measure ONOO−-induced cytotoxicity. Treatment with ONOO− (1 mm) caused a rapid change in cell morphology (within 30 min) that was characterized by cell shrinkage and loss of focal adhesions (Fig.9 A). Pretreatment of the cells with 50 μm PD98059 for 1 h protected the cells from the ONOO−-induced change in cell morphology. ONOO− also caused a concentration-dependent decrease in cell survival as measured by the MTT cytotoxicity assay (Fig. 9 B). Pretreatment with 50 μm PD98059 significantly protected the cells against ONOO−-induced cytotoxicity. Using the MTT assay, we also observed that a 30-min treatment with 100 μm H2O2induced 80–90% cytotoxicity in cells that were pretreated for 1 h with Me2SO vehicle alone, whereas H2O2 treatment induced only 10–15% cytotoxicity in cells pretreated with 50 μm PD98059 for 1 h (data not shown).Figure 9Cytotoxic effect of ONOO − on rat lung myofibroblasts and protective effect of PD98059. A, quiescent cells on glass chamber slides were pretreated with 50 μm PD98059 or vehicle control (Me2SO) for 1 h and then were treated with ONOO− (1 mm) for 30 min prior to fixation and staining with hematoxylin and eosin. B, quiescent cells on 24-well plates were pretreated with 50 μm PD98059 (PD) for 1 h and then treated with increasing concentrations of ONOO− for 30 min prior to assay of cell survival by the MTT cytotoxicity assay.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this study, we have investigated possible differences in the mechanism of ERK activation by H2O2 and ONOO− in vitro using primary passage rat pulmonary myofibroblasts. ONOO− was found to be a potent activator of ERK and also caused phosphorylation of EGFR, Raf-1, and MEK-1. Although these results initially suggested a mechanism of MAPK activation similar to that stimulated by H2O2, we observed that inhibitors of EGFR (AG1478) and Raf-1 (forskolin) did not block ONOO−-induced MAPK activation. Since H2O2 requires EGFR to activate MAPK, these data suggested a different mechanism of MAPK activation between ONOO− and H2O2. We further explored the mechanism of activation and found that ONOO−, but not H2O2, caused nitration and autophosphorylation of recombinant GST-MEK-1 fusion protein in a cell-free system. Additionally, phosphorylated Raf-1 was co-immunoprecipitated with an anti-nitrotyrosine antibody from lysates of ONOO−-treated cells. Collectively, these observations indicate that nitration of Raf-1 and MEK-1 causes autophosphorylation. In our experiments, it was essential to test the possibility that H2O2 was contributing to the activation of ERK since our preparations of ONOO− were synthesized from acidified nitrite and H2O2. Thus, these stocks of ONOO− could contain trace amounts of H2O2. Moreover, a recent study by Kirsch and de Groot (33.Kirsch M. de Groot H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24664-24670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) demonstrated that H2O2 can be formed by the reaction of ONOO− with nicotinamide nucleotides. We excluded the possible contribution of H2O2 by demonstrating that ONOO−-induced phosphorylation of ERK required the immediate addition of ONOO− to cell cultures due to the rapid degradation of this oxidant at neutral pH (Fig. 1). Premixing the ONOO− in PBS (pH 7.4) for 1 min resulted in a complete loss of ERK-phosphorylating activity. In contrast, this premixing delay did not diminish the activity of H2O2 in activating ERK. However, to definitively exclude the possibility that trace levels of H2O2 present in the preparations of ONOO− were mediating activation of ERK, catalase was used to eliminate H2O2 as has been reported previously (10.Sundaresan M., Yu, Z.-X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2322) Google Scholar, 11.Bae Y.S. Kang S.W. Seo M.S. Baines I.C. Tekle E. Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 217-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of cells with catalase abolished activation of ERK by H2O2, but did not inhibit ERK activation by ONOO− (Fig. 3). These data confirmed that activation of ERK following treatment with ONOO− was not due to the presence of H2O2. H2O2-induced ERK activation has been reported to require phosphorylation of EGFR (12.Guyton K.Z. Liu Y. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4138-4142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar, 13.Goldkorn T. Balaban N. Matsukuma K. Chea V. Gould R. Last G. Chan C. Chavez C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 19: 786-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). For this reason, we investigated the role of EGFR in ONOO−-induced ERK activation. Using a Western blot technique with an antibody specific for the phosphorylated form of EGFR, we showed that ONOO−, as well as EGF and H2O2, strongly induced phosphorylation of EGFR within 5 min (Fig. 4). We then employed the EGFR-specific tyrphostin analog AG1478, which has been reported to block the tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR on pulmonary myofibroblasts (31.Rice A.B. Moomaw C.R. Morgan D.L. Bonner J.C. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 213-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). EGFR activation induced by ONOO− was completely blocked by a 1-h pretreatment with AG1478. Despite the complete block of ONOO−- induced EGFR phosphorylation by AG1478, ONOO−-induced ERK activation was not affected by AG1478. In contrast, H2O2-induced ERK activation was completely blocked by AG1478, indicating that phosphorylation of EGFR is required for further downstream signaling of MAPK by H2O2. These findings show that ONOO−, like H2O2, is capable of activating ERK via EGFR phosphorylation. However, unlike H2O2, ONOO− can also bypass blockade of EGFR and directly activate Raf and MEK to cause ERK phosphorylation. Both H2O2 and ONOO− caused Raf-1 activation, and this was blocked by pretreatment of cells with forskolin (Fig. 5). H2O2-induced ERK activation was significantly inhibited by forskolin, yet activation of ERK by ONOO− was not affected by forskolin. These findings indicate that ONOO− can bypass the forskolin-mediated Raf-1 blockade and activate a signaling intermediate downstream of Raf-1. The most likely signaling intermediate that interfaces Raf-1 to ERK signaling is MEK (21.MacDonald S.G. Crews C.M. Wu L. Driller J. Clark R. Erikson L. McCormick F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6615-6620Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The MEK inhibitor almost completely inhibited phosphorylation of MEK and ERK by either ONOO−or H2O2 (Fig. 6). This observation suggests that ERK is not activated directly by ONOO−, but instead requires MEK. Our findings demonstrate important differences in the mechanisms of H2O2- and ONOO−-induced signal transduction involving MAPKs. The effect of H2O2 on MAPK activation is dependent on the phosphorylation of EGFR, whereas ONOO− is capable of bypassing EGFR and Raf-1 blockades to activate MAPK. Although H2O2 can be a source of cellular stress generated from exogenous environmental insult, it is becoming increasingly clear that intracellular H2O2functions as a signaling molecule in normal physiological processes to regulate the phosphorylation of receptor tyrosine kinases such as EGFR and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (10.Sundaresan M., Yu, Z.-X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2322) Google Scholar, 11.Bae Y.S. Kang S.W. Seo M.S. Baines I.C. Tekle E. Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 217-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). The effect of H2O2 on EGFR activation to trigger a MAPK signaling cascade appears to be due to the quenching of protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity (11.Bae Y.S. Kang S.W. Seo M.S. Baines I.C. Tekle E. Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 217-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar, 34.Hecht D. Zick Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 773-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In contrast, ONOO− appears to activate EGFR via nitration of tyrosine residues, which results in receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation (15.van der Vliet A. Hristova M. Cross C.E. Eiserich J.P. Goldkorn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31860-31866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We have also observed that ONOO−treatment of rat pulmonary myofibroblasts causes nitration and autophosphorylation of EGFR and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor. 2P. Zhang and J. C. Bonner, unpublished observation. We provide evidence for the first time that ONOO− directly activates MEK (i.e. autophosphorylation) in a cell-free system that excluded other proteins (Fig. 7). H2O2 did not activate MEK-1 in the cell-free system. As has been shown for ONOO−-induced autophosphorylation of EGFR (15.van der Vliet A. Hristova M. Cross C.E. Eiserich J.P. Goldkorn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31860-31866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), it is likely that a nitration reaction is responsible for autophosphorylation of MEK-1 by ONOO−, and we showed that GST-MEK-1 was nitrated in a concentration-dependent manner that correlated with the amount of ONOO− that was required to induce autophosphorylation (Fig. 7). We excluded the possible contribution of phosphatase inhibition as a mechanism of ONOO−-induced MEK-1 activation since the cell-free phosphorylation assay excluded phosphatases. We addressed the biological relevance of ONOO−-induced MAPK activation. Since mitogenesis is the paradigm of EGFR activation and ONOO− activated EGFR, we first investigated the effect of ONOO− on DNA synthesis using a [3H]thymidine incorporation assay. Although EGF was a potent stimulator of mitogenesis in rat lung myofibroblasts, ONOO− caused a concentration-dependent decrease in mitogenesis (Fig. 8), and this was due to a reduction in cell survival as determined by the MTT cytotoxicity assay (Fig. 9). Our finding that the MEK inhibitor PD98059 prevented ONOO−- and H2O2-induced cytotoxicity was surprising since activation of the ERK pathway is necessary for proliferative and cell survival responses (35.Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingaud J. Davis R. Greenberg M. Science. 1995; 270: 326-331Crossref Scopus (5045) Google Scholar). Indeed, both EGF-induced DNA synthesis and ONOO−-induced cytotoxicity in myofibroblasts were blocked by PD98059. Thus, in the same cell type, MEK is critical for both proliferative and cytotoxic responses, depending on the stimulus. Other investigators have made observations similar to ours in other systems. Bhat and Zhang (36.Bhat N.R. Zhang P. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) reported that PD98059 protected oligodendrocytes from the cytotoxic effects of H2O2. Jimenezet al. (37.Jimenez L.A. Zanella C. Fung H. Janssen Y.M.W. Vacek P. Charland C. Goldberg J. Mossman B.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: L1029-L1035PubMed Google Scholar) showed that asbestos- and H2O2-induced pleural mesothelial cell death was abrogated by the MEK inhibitor PD98059. The mechanism through which MEK or ERK mediates cytotoxicity in response to ONOO− or other oxidants is unclear. One possibility is that activation of ERK along with simultaneous activation of other kinases (e.g. p38 or JNK) could lead to a cell death response, whereas EGF does not activate these other kinases in myofibroblasts. It is known that oxidants, including H2O2 and ONOO−, activate all three families of MAPKs (12.Guyton K.Z. Liu Y. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4138-4142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar, 18.Schieke S.M. Brivida K. Klotz L.-O. Sies H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 301-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Thus, we suggest that activation of the ERK pathway by ONOO− or H2O2 may be required (but not sufficient) for a cytotoxic response. In summary, we report that ONOO− independently activates components of the MAPK signaling cascade that involves EGFR, Raf-1, and MEK-1. Although H2O2-induced ERK activation was completely blocked at the level of EGFR phosphorylation, ONOO− could bypass blockade of either EGFR tyrosine kinase or Raf-1 kinase and cause ERK activation. ONOO− caused nitration and autophosphorylation of GST-MEK-1 fusion protein in a cell-free system, suggesting that formation of nitrotyrosine activates MEK-1. These findings indicate that the mechanism of MAPK activation by ONOO− is fundamentally different from that of H2O2-induced MAPK activation. We thank Drs. Ron Mason and Thomas Eling (NIEHS) for helpful comments during the preparation of this manuscript. Special thanks are due to Dr. Ron Mason for invaluable input during the course of the study.

The aminophospholipid translocation activity plays an important physiological role in the maintenance of membrane phospholipid asymmetry that is observed in the plasma membrane as well as the membranes of certain cellular organelles. While the preparations of ATPase II from different sources share common fundamental properties, such as substrate specificity, inhibitor spectrum, and phospholipid dependence, they are divergent in several characteristics. These include specific ATPase activity and phospholipid selectivity. We report here the identification of four isoforms of ATPase II in bovine brain. These isoforms are formed by a combination of two major variations in their primary sequences and show that the structural variation of these isoforms has functional significance in both ATPase activity and phosholipid selectivity. Furthermore, studies with the phosphoenzyme intermediate of ATPase II and its recombinant isoforms revealed that phosphatidylserine is essential for the dephosphorylation of the intermediate. Without phosphatidylserine, ATPase II would be accumulated as phosphoenzyme in the presence of ATP, resulting in the interruption of its catalytic cycle.

The outer leaflet consists predominantly of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and sphingomyelin, whereas aminophospholipids, including phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), are present almost exclusively in the inner leaflet (1Devaux P.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1163-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 2Williamson P. Schlegel R.A. Mol Membr. Biol. 1994; 11: 199-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The asymmetric nature of phospholipid composition is found in several other intracellular membrane systems as well, and the physiologic importance of phospholipid asymmetry is multifold. The asymmetric distribution of lipids provides the two sides of the membrane with different characteristics that are necessary for their respective physiologic function. For instance, the tight packing of the outer leaflet of the PM is important for membrane stability in circulating blood cells and the resistance of cells to attack by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (3Antia R. Schlegel R.A. Williamson P. Immunol. Lett. 1992; 32: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the enrichment of aminophospholipid in the inner leaflet of the PM and the cytosolic leaflet of endocytotic and exocytotic vesicle membranes may contribute to these surfaces being in a fusion-competent state (4Schlegel R.A. Williamson P. Molecular Mechanisms of Membrane Fusion. Plenum Press, New York1988: 289-301Crossref Google Scholar). In addition, the regulated disruption of phospholipid asymmetry in the PM provides a pathway for cellular signaling in certain physiologic events. The surface exposure of PS, for example, has been demonstrated in activated platelet to promote the reaction cascade of blood coagulation (5Bevers E.M. Comfurius P. Van Rijn J. Hemker C. Zwaal R.F.

While a thorough understanding of the mechanism for membrane asymmetry and phospholipid translocation has yet to emerge, one of the enzymes that plays a major role in these processes has been identified as aminophospholipid translocase (9Seigneuret M.

Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2585-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). This activity catalyzes an energy-dependent aminophospholipid translocation requiring Mg2+ and ATP (10Zachowski A. Favre E. Cribier S. Herve P. Devaux P.F. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2585-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), and it is sensitive to the sulfhydryl group reagent N-ethylmaleimide and vanadate, an inhibitor of P-type ATPases (9Seigneuret M. Devaux P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 8171: 3751-3755Crossref Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 11Daleke D.L. Huestis W.J. Biochem. 1985; 24: 5406-5416Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The primary candidate protein for this activity is ATPase II, a PS-dependent and vanadate-sensitive Mg2+-ATPase. This ATPase has an apparent molecular mass of about 116 kDa and has been isolated and purified from several sources including chromaffin granules (12Moriyama Y. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8521-8527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), clathrin-coated vesicles (13Xie X.-S. Stone D.K. Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1710-1714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the plasma membrane of erythrocytes (14Morrot G. Zachowski A. Devaux P.F. FEBS Lett. 1990; 266: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This enzyme is a P-type ATPase with characteristics strikingly similar to those of the aminophospholipid translocase activity measured in situ (9Seigneuret M. Devaux P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 8171: 3751-3755Crossref Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Comparison of the sequence data of ATPase II from bovine chromaffin (15Tang X. Halleck M.S. Schlegel R.A. Williamson P. Science. 1996; 272: 1495-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), mouse muscle, 2D. Pradhan, C. F. Blackman, P. Williamson, and R. A. Schlegel, GenBankTM accession numberU75321. and human tissues (18Mouro I. Halleck M.S. Schlegel R.A. Mattei M.G. Williamson P. Zachowski A. Devaux P.F. Cartron J.P. Colin Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) 3Y. Nakanishi, GenBankTM accession number AB013452. indicates that this enzyme contains 10 putative transmembrane domains and several P-type ATPase consensus sequences. An ATP binding site and a phosphoenzyme formation site are located within the largest cytosolic loop, whereas a sequence implicated in the coupling to transport activity was identified in another hydrophilic loop. The sequence of mammalian ATPase II is homologous to a yeast ATPase encoded by the DRS2 gene, of which the null mutant of a yeast strain lacks a specific PS internalization activity that is otherwise present in wild type yeast strains (15Tang X. Halleck M.S. Schlegel R.A. Williamson P. Science. 1996; 272: 1495-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). This observation provides further evidence indicating the involvement of ATPase II in PS translocation. Furthermore, proteoliposomes that were reconstituted with purified ATPase II from erythrocytes were shown to transport fluorescent PS, and to a lesser extent PE, but not PC (19Auland M.E. Roufogalis B.D. Devaux P.F. Zachowski A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10938-10942Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The ATPase II from different mammalian sources, however, is divergent in several characteristics. The specific ATPase activity of these preparations, for instance, is reported to range from 0.8 (μmol Pi/min/mg of protein) for the enzyme isolated from human erythrocyte (14Morrot G. Zachowski A. Devaux P.F. FEBS Lett. 1990; 266: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) to 8.0 for that from bovine chromaffin granules (12Moriyama Y. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8521-8527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to 42 for the preparation from clathrin-coated vesicles (13Xie X.-S. Stone D.K. Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1710-1714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the stimulating effect of PS over PE on these preparations varies from 2- to 20-fold. This disparity may be of physiological importance in fulfilling the requirement of different tissue- and/or organelle-specific processes in which aminophospholipid translocation is involved. Differences in the distribution of aminophospholipids in various cellular compartments may arise from intrinsic functional differences between isoforms of ATPase II, different co-factors that are required for the function of ATPase II, or entirely different enzymes. Alternatively, differences in the activity profile of ATPase II preparations from various sources may be due to variations in the purification protocols used to isolate these ATPases from various sources. Clarification of these issues would facilitate the study of aminophospholipid translocation system, a very important but poorly understood enzyme system. Although certain differences between the cDNA sequences of ATPase II from different sources have been found, their correlation to biochemical activity has not been established because of the limited characterization of these preparations at a protein level. ATPase II, when purified from clathrin-coated vesicles, appears as a doublet of 116 kDa by SDS-PAGE (13Xie X.-S. Stone D.K. Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1710-1714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two bands behave strikingly similar when either photoaffinity-labeled by [α-32P]ATP (13Xie X.-S. Stone D.K. Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1710-1714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or analyzed for phosphoenzyme formation with [γ-32P]ATP. 4J. Ding and X.-S. Xie, unpublished observation. These two proteins have proven difficult to separate biochemically, although gel filtration chromatography indicates that the two proteins do not exist as a complexed dimer (13Xie X.-S. Stone D.K. Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1710-1714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results, in composite, suggest the possibility that the two proteins represent different isozymes of ATPase II. The current studies were undertaken to characterize basic functional properties of the bovine brain form(s) of ATPase II and to determine if structurally and functionally distinct isoforms of the enzyme exist in brain. In this paper, we report the identification of four isoforms of ATPase II from bovine brain. These isoforms are characterized with respect to structural and functional differences in both ATPase activity and phospholipid selectivity. In addition, studies with the phosphoenzyme intermediate of ATPase II and its recombinant isoforms revealed that PS is essential for the dephosphorylation of the intermediate. The catalytic cycle of ATPase II would be stopped without PS or PE, resulting in the accumulation of its phosphoenzyme intermediate. This observation provides a biochemical explanation for the aminophospholipid dependence of this enzyme, as well as an important clue for further understanding of the mechanism of how aminophospholipid translocase transports PS across biological membranes. Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; the GeneAmp polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reagent kit with Thermus aquaticus Taq DNA polymerase and DNA sequencing materials and reagents were from Perkin-Elmer. A bovine brain cDNA library in λZAP was the kind gift of Dr. Richard A. F. Dixon (University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston). The hostEscherichia coli cells BB4 and XL1-Blue and helper phage R408 were from Stratagene; an oligolabeling kit was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; the Sulfolink kit was from Pierce; the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system was from Life Technologies, Inc. All phospholipids were from Avanti Polar lipids, Inc. Radioactive materials were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma. The vanadate-sensitive Mg2+-ATPase (ATPase II) was purified basically as described previously (13Xie X.-S. Stone D.K. Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1710-1714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the following modifications. Instead of purified clathrin-coated vesicles, we used an early “P2” fraction that contained all membranes except nuclei and mitochondria. A higher concentration of C12E9 was used than previously reported, and the last two glycerol gradient centrifugation steps with SDS were replaced by FPLC. In brief, the modified procedure consists of 1) washing the P2 membranes twice, once with 0.75 mTris-HCl, pH 8.5, and once with 1% sodium cholate, followed by extraction of the enzyme with 0.75% C12E9; 2) hydroxyapatite chromatography; 3) ammonium sulfate fractionation; 4) glycerol gradient centrifugation; 5) FPLC with ceramic hydroxyapatite; and 6) FPLC with a superdex gel filtration column. The resulting preparation was stored at −70 °C. The purified enzyme appears in SDS-PAGE as a doublet with an apparent molecular mass of 116 kDa (13Xie X.-S. Stone D.K. Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1710-1714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two bands were separated by SDS-PAGE (8% acrylamide) with extended running time (30 min after the dye front reached the lower edge of the gel). The two bands were localized by staining with Coomassie Blue following SDS-PAGE and were subjected to in-gel digestion with trypsin (20Williams K.R. Stone K.L. Crabb J.W. Techniques in Protein Chemistry. VI. Academic Press, Inc., New York1995: 143-152Google Scholar). Aliquots (1 μl) of the resulting peptide mixtures were each mixed with 1 μl of a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile, 50% water, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v/v), and the mixture was dried on the target of a Voyager DE mass spectrometer (PE Biosystems, Foster City, CA) for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization. Time-of-flight mass spectra were acquired (21Jensen O.E. Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 10: 1371-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The data were searched against the NCBI protein data base issue number 10.04.99. using the MS-Fit search routine accessed through Protein Prospector on the Internet. A PCR-based approach was used to isolate cDNAs encoding for different isoforms using a bovine brain cDNA library as a source for DNA template. Because of the size of the protein, two pairs of primers were designed to independently clone the 5′- and 3′-halves of the cDNA, based on published sequence data of the bovine chromaffin granule ATPase II (15Tang X. Halleck M.S. Schlegel R.A. Williamson P. Science. 1996; 272: 1495-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The first pair of primers (A-1, 5′-CAACTCGAG ATGCCCACCATGCGGAGGACC-3′; A-2, 5′-GAATCGATAATCACTGAGTCAGGCGTT-3′) annealed to the base positions 175–195 5175 is the position of the start codon, shown in boldface type within the sequence of the primer. and 1700–1727 of the cDNA sequence, respectively. A XhoI restriction site was introduced immediately before the starting codon in primer A-1, and a ClaI site was introduced at the 5′-end of the second primer, as indicated by italic type, for further cloning purposes. The second pair of primers (B-1, 5′-ATTATCGATTCACTGGGGCAGGAAGA-3′; B-2, 5′-AGGAAGCTTTCACCACTCATCAGGTCTCTGC-3′) annealed to positions 1717–1741 and 3600–3622, respectively. Restriction sitesClaI and HindIII were introduced at the 5′- end of primer B-1 and B-2, respectively. A high fidelity PCR kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used, and the PCR products were cloned into pCR-Blunt II-TOPO Plasmid using an Invitrogen Zero Blunt TOPO PCR Cloning Kit, following the manufacturer's instructions. DNA sequencing was performed using an ABI Prism DNA sequencer. To generate full-length clones for expression studies, the PCR-amplified 5′-half and 3′-half clones were gel-purified and cleaved with restriction enzymes:XhoI and ClaI for 5′-half fragment and ClaI and HindIII for the 3′-half fragment. The enzyme-treated fragments were ligated through a three-way ligation by T4 DNA ligase into pFastBacHTb vector that was cleaved by XhoI and HindIII. Screening of the bovine brain cDNA library was also performed in order to obtain clones covering the middle part of the coding sequence as well as clones containing the 5′- and 3′-end noncoding sequences. Two DNA probes for library screening were generated by PCR, of which one is 444 base pairs (bp) in length extending from the start codon and the other is 456 bp long extending from bp 2116 to 2571. A total of approximately 2 × 106 independent clones were screened using the procedure as described (22Peng S.-B. Crider B.P. Xie X.-S. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17262-17266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inserts from all positive clones were excised and cloned into pBluescript with helper phage R408 and sequenced. Five epitopes of interest were selected and synthesized. These include two conserved sequences near either N or C termini and three isoform-specific sequences that are discussed in detail under “Results.” A cysteine was added to the N terminus of each peptide to facilitate covalent linkages with sulfhydryl-reactive reagents. Antisera were raised in New Zealand White rabbits to peptides linked to keyhole limpet hemocyanin as described previously (23Sudhof T.C. Fried V.A. Stone D.K. Johnston P.A. Xie X.-S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6067-6071Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). All antibodies were affinity-purified by Sulfolink column chromatography after covalent attachment of the corresponding peptide, following the manufacturer's instructions. For Western blot analysis, protein samples were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose paper, and synthetic peptide samples were dot-blotted to nitrocellulose paper directly. Immunodetection was performed using an Amersham ECL Western blotting system. A Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used for the generation of recombinant baculovirus and expression of recombinant ATPase II isoforms, following the manufacturer's instructions. The coding region of α1 and α2 isoforms was amplified by PCR and inserted into the polylinker sites of baculovirus vector pFastBacHTb in compliance with its open reading frame. The construct for β′ isoforms was generated by removing the 45 bp encoding for the 15-amino acid insert from the corresponding α isoforms. To do so, two primers with overlapping sequences were designed. Primer F (5′-GTGGCTTACGGGCAGAACTCACAGTT-3′) anneals to bp 1284–1354 but excluding the 45 bp encoding for the 15-amino acid inserts. Primer R (5′-TGTGAGTTCTGCCCGTAAGCCACTCC-3′) anneals to bp 1281–1351, also excluding the same 45 base pairs. With previously cloned α isoforms as templates, two PCR fragments were produced with primers A-1 and R for the 5′-half fragment and primers F and B-2 for the 3′-half fragment. These two fragments were gel-purified and mixed together. The mixture was then used as the template for the PCR to clone the full-length β isoforms with A-1 and B-2 as primers using a high fidelity PCR kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The full-length PCR product was gel-purified and cleaved by XhoI and HindIII and subsequently cloned into pFastBacHTb vector, which was also cleaved by XhoI and HindIII. The removing of the 45-bp was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The expression vector pFastBacHTb generates a histidine tag at the N terminus of recombinant proteins for purification purposes. The recombinant pFastBacHTb donor plasmid was then transformed into DH10Bac-competent E. coli cells, which contain bacmid and helper, to transpose into recombinant bacmid. The recombinant bacmid DNA was isolated from E. coli cells and transfected intoSpodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) ovary cells with CellFECTIN reagent to produce recombinant baculovirus. Sf9 cells were propagated in suspension culture at 27 °C in either Grace's or IPL-41 medium supplemented with 8% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum plus 0.1% pluronic polyol F68. 4 liters of Sf9 cells were transfected with recombinant virus for 40–48 h and harvested by centrifugation. The cells were resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.50), 0.1 m NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A) and were broken by sonication. The membrane fraction was separated from cytosol by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 1 h and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. To solubilize the recombinant 116-kDa ATPase, the membrane fraction was incubated with buffer A plus 1.2% C12E9 and rotated at 4 °C overnight. The supernatant was separated from insoluble materials by centrifugation at 100,000 × gfor 1 h and loaded onto a 3-ml Ni2+-NTA column pre-equilibrated with buffer A. After extensively washing the column with 300 ml of buffer A plus 0.75 m NaCl and 300 ml of buffer A plus 10 mm imidazole, the recombinant protein was eluted with buffer A plus 100 mm imidazole. Fractions of 1 ml each were collected and were used for further analysis. For further purification of the recombinant protein, active fractions from the Ni-NTA column were pooled and loaded onto a 2-ml HTP column equilibrated with buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% C12E9, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm EDTA). The column was washed with two column volumes of the same buffer, and bound proteins were eluted by a linear gradient of sodium phosphate up to 200 mm. Each active fraction from HTP column was directly loaded on top of a glycerol gradient from 15 to 30% prepared in buffer B and centrifuged in a SW 60 rotor at 60,000 rpm for 20 h. Fractions were collected by piercing the centrifuge tube from the bottom and were used for assays. Usually, a total of 14 fractions, at 0.3 ml each, were collected from each gradient. Each phospholipid including PS, PE, and PC in chloroform solution was added to a Ryrex glass test tube at 5 mg each. Chloroform was evaporated under a stream of N2 while rotating the test tube such that the phospholipid formed a thin layer at the bottom of the tube. The test tubes containing different phospholipids were placed under vacuum for 1 h to ensure complete removal of residual chloroform from these lipids, which is critical in both ensuring the solubility of the phospholipids in detergent solution and preserving their potential stimulating activity. 1 ml of a solution containing 10 mmTris/MES, pH 7.0, 5 mm DTT, and 1% sodium cholate (from a stock solution of 20% sodium cholate, pH 8.0) was added to each tube, filled with N2, and sealed with a rubber stopper and Teflon tape. The phospholipids were then suspended in the solution by soaking overnight and vortexing. The phospholipid suspensions were then sonicated in a bath-type sonicator three times for 5 min each, until the milky suspensions became completely clear, which would be the stock solutions. The stock solution for each phospholipid was then diluted 10-fold with buffer B (the same buffer used for the final step of enzyme preparation) to form the working solution at concentration of 0.5 mg of phospholipid/ml. ATPase activity was measured as the liberation of 32Pi from [γ-32P]ATP as described (13Xie X.-S. Stone D.K. Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1710-1714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In general, samples were preincubated with or without 2.5 μg of designated phospholipid, prepared as described above, for 10 min at 25 °C. ATPase assay was started by the addition of 0.2 ml of assay solution consisting of 50 mm Tris-MES, pH 7.0, 30 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 3–5 mm [γ-32P]ATP (400 cpm/nmol), with or without 0.1 mm sodium vanadate as an inhibitor, and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 ml of 1.25 n perchloric acid, and phosphate was extracted and counted in a scintillation counter. The results are expressed as nmol of Pi/min/assay, or calculated as μmol of Pi/min/mg of protein. A fraction of ATPase II, either native or recombinant, was incubated with 0.5 μm [γ-32P]ATP (106 cpm/pmol of ATP) at room temperature for designated periods of time in a solution containing 25 mm Tris/MES, pH 7.5, 30 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, and a 3 mm concentration of either MgCl2 or EDTA, in a final volume of 15 μl. The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer, followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiograph. SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1973; 227: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), and protein concentration in general was determined by the the Amido Schwarz method (25Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (1954) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The content of recombinant enzyme was determined by Western blot analysis and densitometry scanning using a titration of native ATPase II as a standard curve. Because of the aforementioned indistinguishable characteristics of the two bands of the 116-kDa doublet, we considered the possibility that these two bands were isoforms of this enzyme, and we performed mass spectrometry analysis of tryptic fragments of these polypeptides to investigate this issue. The two proteins were individually identified using a peptide mass fingerprinting approach in which the mass values for tryptic peptides derived from each protein were measured by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry and then matched against the masses expected from all available proteins from mammalian species. Searches specified a mass accuracy of 300 ppm and allowed up to one missed cleavage by trypsin in any peptide sequence. 25 of 25 peptide masses measured for the smaller of the two “116-kDa” polypeptides and 28 of 28 peptide masses for the larger polypeptide of the doublet matched bovine chromaffin granule ATPase II (U51100). Secondary matches with ATPase II from another mammalian species (mouse,U75321) were also recorded. The data from the smaller protein spanned 21% of the amino acid sequence of bovine ATPase II, and the data from the larger protein covered 24%. All major peaks in the spectra could be assigned to bovine ATPase II or to known background signals. It could therefore be concluded that the two proteins represent different forms of ATPase II. We named the longer and shorter forms as ATPase II isoform α and β, respectively, for convenience. It was noticed that a mass spectral signal for peptides spanning residues 1108–1136 and 1144–1149, at the C terminus of the ATPase II sequence, was recorded in spectra from the α isoform but was absent from the β isoform. This suggested the possibility that these two proteins of the doublet differed in length due to the removal of amino acids from the C terminus of the shorter form. This notion was confirmed by Western blot analysis with sequence-specific antibodies, as discussed below. Once the existence of isoforms was confirmed, we performed both PCR-based cloning and cDNA library screening using a bovine brain cDNA library as described under “Experimental Procedures,” to isolate the cDNAs encoding these isoforms. 15 positive clones were obtained by a PCR-based approach including seven for the 5′-half and eight for the 3′-half of the cDNA. In addition, eight positives were isolated by library screening. Collectively, these clones constitute an open reading frame of 3492 base pairs, coding for a protein of 1164 amino acids. This is 15 residues longer than that of chromaffin granule ATPase II (15Tang X. Halleck M.S. Schlegel R.A. Williamson P.

The binding of ligands to the extracellular domain of the EGFR induces dimerization of the receptor and activation of its intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, leading to the receptor autophosphorylation and the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in various cellular substrates, many of which serve as intracellular signal molecules (1.Schlessinger J.

It has been indicated that the binding of EGF to the EGFR was remarkably reduced in the case of A431 cells that had been treated with N-glycosylation inhibitors, suggesting thatN-linked sugar chains appear to be required for receptor function (10.Soderquist A.M. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12586-12594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been reported that the interaction of certain lectins with receptor oligosaccharides leads to an alteration in ligand binding capacity as well as tyrosine kinase activity (11.Zeng F.Y.

It has also been found that modulation of N-glycan biosynthesis by N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III, an enzyme that plays a major role in the biosynthesis of the hybrid and complex types of N-linked oligosaccharides (15.Nishikawa A. Ihara Y. Hatakeyama M. Kangawa K. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18199-18204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), inhibits EGF binding as well as receptor autophosphorylation (14.Rebbaa A. Yamamoto H. Saito T. Meuillet E. Kim P.

Thus,N-linked oligosaccharides on EGFR appear to play important roles in receptor function, particularly regarding ligand binding. However, a specific N-linked oligosaccharide(s) responsible for the expression of the functional receptor has not yet been identified, and, as a result, the molecular basis for the requirement of the sugar chain in receptor function remains obscure. On the basis of amino acid sequence conservation, the extracellular domain of the EGFR is divided into four subdomains, namely domains I–IV (8.Ullrich A. Coussens L. Hayflick J.S. Dull T.J. Gray A. Tam A.W. Lee J. Yarden Y. Libermann T.A. Schlessinger J. Downward J. Mayes E.L.V. Whittle N. Waterfield M.D. Seeburg P.H. Nature. 1984; 309: 418-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (1996) Google Scholar). Of the four domains, domain III is believed to play a critical role in ligand binding such as the binding of EGF and transforming growth factor α, as suggested by the studies using a recombinant soluble extracellular domain of the EGFR (sEGFR) (16.Greenfield C.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and its limited proteolytic fragment (20.Kohda D. Odaka M. Lax I. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Inagaki F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1976-1981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The isolated fragment, which contained domain III, retains the capacity to bind the ligand, a finding that is consistent with evidence that domain III is specifically cross-linked with the EGF in affinity cross-linking experiments (21.Lax I. Burgess W.H. Bellot F. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Givol D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1831-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The importance of the domain III in ligand binding is also supported by an analysis using a chimeric chicken/human EGFR (22.Lax I. Bellot F. Howk R. Ullrich A. Givol D. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Since the isolated fragment does not form an oligomer, even on ligand binding, it is more likely that some other subdomain in the extracellular domain is directly associated with the dimerization of the receptor. The above findings suggest that ligand binding is a primary role of domain III of EGFR. These and aforementioned suggestions concerning the involvement of the sugar chains have led us to hypothesize that sugar chains in domain III may play a role in the function of this receptor, possibly in ligand binding. To investigate and elucidate the significance of the sugar chain in the function of the EGFR, identification of the responsible glycosylation site would be a highly desirable first step, and it follows that the most probable candidates to examine would be the sugar chains in domain III. In this study, we prepared and characterized mutant EGFRs in which potential N-glycosylation sites have been replaced by site-directed mutagenesis, in order to eliminate sugar chains being attached to domain III. These mutants were transiently expressed in COS-1 cells to examine the effect of the loss of the sugar chain on receptor function. The role of the specific sugar chain identified as being important was further investigated using a purified soluble extracellular domain of the mutant. Such a detailed characterization of the mutant receptor in which this important sugar chain is absent might lead to an understanding of the function of this sugar chain in signaling by growth factor receptors. Restriction endonucleases and DNA modifying enzymes were purchased from Takara, Toyobo, and New England Biolabs. Oligonuclotide primers were synthesized by Greiner Japan. Human EGF was purchased from Wakunaga. 125I-EGF was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Other common chemicals were from Wako Pure Chemicals or Nacalai Tesque. Human EGFR cDNA (23.Gotoh N. Tojo A. Hino M. Yazaki Y. Shibuya M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), kindly provided by Dr. Masabumi Shibuya (Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan), was subcloned into pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) for the transient expression in COS-1 cells. Mutations were introduced according to the method of Kunkel (24.Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar), as described previously (25.Ikeda Y. Fujii J. Anderson M.E. Taniguchi N. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22223-22228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The single-stranded uracil-substituted DNA templates were prepared fromEscherichia coli strain CJ236 transformed by pBluescript (Stratagene) plasmids containing a 1.2-kbBamHI-BamHI and a 0.97-kbBamHI-EcoRI fragment of the EGFR cDNA. To delete the potential N-linked glycosylation sites in EGFR domain III (Asn-328, Asn-337, Asn-389, and Asn-420), mutations to substitute glutamine for asparagine were performed with the uracil template for the 1.2- or 0.97-kb fragment and the following primers: Asn-328 → Gln, 5′-ATT CGT GGC CTG TAT GGA GAG-3′; Asn-337 → Gln, 5′-GGA GGT GCA TTG TTT GAA GTG-3′; Asn-389 → Gln, TGG CCT GAA CAA AGG ACG GAC-3′; Asn-420 → Gln, 5′-GTC AGC CTG CAA ATA ACA TCC-3′. When a His-tagged sEGFR was prepared, the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions were deleted, and (Gly)3-(His)6-STOP was introduced at the position following Ile-619 in the juxtamembrane region of the EGFR. These alterations were also made in the 0.97-kb fragment by site-directed mutagenesis using a primer 5′-GGG CCT AAG ATC GGG GGC GGC CAC CAT CAT CAT CAT CAT TAA GAA TTC TTG CTG CTG GTG-3′. All the mutated sequences were verified by automated DNA sequencing using a Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit and ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer (Perkin-Elmer, Applied Biosystems). COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml kanamycin, and 5 g/liter glucose under 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C. Expression plasmids carrying the wild-type and mutant EGFR cDNAs were purified by CsCl gradient ultracentrifugation, and 30 μg of the plasmids were transfected into 1 × 107COS-1 cells by electroporation using a Gene-Pulser (Bio-Rad), as described (26.Ikeda Y. Fujii J. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3980-3985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was carried out according to the method of Laemmli (27.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) under the reducing or non-reducing conditions. Proteins were visualized by silver staining kit (Daiichi Pure Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan). For immunoblotting, the separated proteins were electrotransfered to a nitrocellulose membrane (Protran, Schleicher & Schuell). After blocking with 5% skim milk, the membrane was incubated with an antibody against human EGFR (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), phosphotyrosine (PY-20, Transduction Laboratories), or His tag (Tetra-HisTM antibody, Qiagen). The membrane was washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.02% Tween 20, and then allowed to react with an appropriate second antibody, which was conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Immunoreactive bands were detected using an ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The transfected COS-1 cells were maintained in 10-cm dishes for 2 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml kanamycin, and 5 g/liter glucose, and then starved for 18 h in fetal calf serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The cells were then stimulated with or without 100 ng/ml human EGF for 10 min at 37 °C. The resulting cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed by sonication in 50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4), 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm EGTA, 100 μm NaF, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol. After removal of insoluble materials by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using a 7.5% gel and immunoblotting. Expression of the EGFRs and tyrosine phosphorylation were examined by probing with an anti-human EGFR and an anti-phosphotyrosine, respectively. Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf) 21 cells were maintained at 27 °C in Grace's insect medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 3.33 g/liter yeastolate, 3.33 g/liter lactalbumin hydrolysate, and 100 mg/liter kanamycin. Recombinant viruses were manipulated as described (28.Piwnica-Worms H. Ausubel F.M. Brent R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates/Wiley-Interscience, New York1987: 16.8.1-16.11.7Google Scholar). cDNAs for the His-tagged sEGFRs were ligated intoBamHI and EcoRI sites of a baculovirus transfer vector, pVL1393 (Invitrogen), and the resulting plasmids were purified using a Qiagen Plasmid Mini Kit. The resulting transfer plasmids (5 μg) were co-transfected into 5 × 105 Sf21 cells with 10 ng of BaculoGold DNA (PharMingen). Transfection experiments were carried out by the Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) method (29.Felgner P.L. Gadek T.R. Holm H. Roman R. Chan H.W. Wenz M. Northrop J.R. Ringold G.M. Danielsen M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7413-7419Crossref PubMed Scopus (4388) Google Scholar), as described previously (30.Ikeda Y. Fujii J. Taniguchi N. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Media containing the recombinant viruses generated were collected 5 days after transfection. The titers of recombinant viruses were further amplified by several rounds of infection prior to use. Sf21 cells, at 70% confluence, were infected with the recombinant baculoviruses carrying the wild-type and mutant sEGFR cDNAs, and the culture medium was harvested 5 days after infection in order to purify the recombinant proteins that had been secreted by the infected cells. Cell debris in the culture medium was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The secreted sEGFR was precipitated by saturated ammonium sulfate and pelleted by centrifugation. The pellet were dissolved in and dialyzed against 20 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4) and 500 mmNaCl. The dialyzed materials were applied to a Ni2+-chelating Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 20 mm Hepes-NaOH buffer (pH 7.4) containing 40 mm imidazole. The column was then washed thoroughly with 20 mm Hepes-NaOH buffer (pH 7.4) containing 500 mm NaCl and 100 mmimidazole. The sEGFR was eluted from the column with 20 mmHepes-NaOH buffer (pH 7.4) containing 200 mm imidazole. Aliquots of fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by silver staining to monitor elution of the sEGFR and its purity. The purified sEGFR was concentrated using a Centriprep-30 concentrator (Amicon) to a final concentration approximately 0.7 mg/ml. The mutant sEGFRs were also purified, as was the wild-type protein. The purified sEGFRs were stored at 4 °C until used. The purified wild-type and mutant sEGFRs (0.2 mg/ml) were incubated with or without 20 μm human EGF in 20 mm Hepes-NaOH buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100 mm NaCl for 1 h at room temperature. The mixtures were allowed to react with 10 mmdisuccinimidyl suberate (DSS; Nacalai Tesque), a covalent chemical cross-linking reagent, for 1 h at room temperature, and the reactions were then terminated by the addition of Tris-HCl (pH7.4) to a final concentration of 500 mm. The resulting cross-linked products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis using the anti-His tag antibody. Fifty ng of the purified wild-type sEGFR were incubated with 50, 100, 150, 250, and 500 nm125I-EGF (310 cpm/pmol) in 50 μl of 20 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4) containing 40 mmimidazole and 0.1% bovine serum albumin in microtubes for 1 h at room temperature. Five μl of Ni2+-chelating Sepharose Fast Flow resins were added to the reaction mixture, which was then mixed by rotation of the tube for 10 min. Materials bound to the resins were precipitated by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and washed twice with the same ice-cold buffer as was used for binding. The pellets were resuspended in 500 mmimidazole HCl (pH 7.4) to elute the ligand-receptor complex from the resins, and the radioactivities of the supernatants were measured on a γ-counter. Nonspecific binding was determined in duplicate experiments in the presence of 100-fold excess amounts of nonradioactive EGF. The dissociation constant for the binding of the wild-type sEGFR to EGF was calculated from a Scatchard plot for the specific binding. In the case of the Asn-420 → Gln sEGFR, the binding was examined at an 125I-EGF concentration of 500 nm, as carried out for the wild type. Protein concentrations were determined by a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Human EGFR contains 12 potential sites for N-linked glycosylation in its extracellular domain. Although it is known that glycosylation of EGFR is essential for its function (9.Slieker L.J.

Taniguchi N. Moskal J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9275-9279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), the role of the sugar chain in this process is not fully understood. Moreover, the specific glycosylation site, which is required, has never been identified. It seems more likely that domain III plays a primary role in the binding of EGF (20.Kohda D. Odaka M. Lax I. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Inagaki F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1976-1981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Lax I. Burgess W.H. Bellot F. Ullrich A.

EMBO J. 1989; 8: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), as evidenced by the fact that the limited proteolytic fragment, which contains an entire sequence of the domain III, but no other domains, retains ligand binding capacity (20.Kohda D. Odaka M. Lax I. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Inagaki F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1976-1981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that, of the four oligosaccharide moieties attached to domain III, one or more are likely candidates for this role. As a result, we prepared and characterized the EGFR mutants in which potentialN-glycosylation site residues in the domain, Asn-328, Asn-337, Asn-389, and Asn-420, were replaced by glutamine (Fig.1). The mutant with replacements at all four sites was also prepared, and designated as Asn-all → Gln. When the wild-type and mutant EGFRs were transiently expressed in COS-1 cells, all the single site mutants were produced at levels comparable to the wild-type, as shown in Fig.2 A. These mutants and the wild-type EGFR proteins gave bands consistent with a molecular mass of 170 kDa, suggesting that the mutants were fully glycosylated with the exception of the mutated sites. On the other hand, the intensity of the immunoreactive bands of the Asn-all → Gln mutant was as weak as that for the mock transfected cells, indicating that only the expression of endogenous EGFR had occurred. These results suggest that elimination of any of the four possible sugar chains does not affect the expression level of the protein, whereas the simultaneous elimination of all four glycosylation sites leads to a dramatic decrease in expression. To explore the issue of whether the mutations at the glycosylation sites affect EGF-induced tyrosine autophosphorylation, the wild-type and mutant EGFRs expressed in COS-1 cells were stimulated by EGF. The Asn-328 → Gln, Asn-337 → Gln, and Asn-389 → Gln mutant EGFRs as well as the wild-type were tyrosine-phosphorylated in an EGF-dependent manner, suggesting that these mutants were indistinguishable from the wild-type in terms of the cell surface expression and the receptor function such as the ligand-induced activation (Fig. 2 B). On the other hand, the Asn-420 → Gln mutant EGFR was phosphorylated even in the absence of EGF, to an extent similar to that found in the wild-type, which had been stimulated with EGF (Fig. 2 B). These results were very reproducible, as obtained by four independent experiments, and clearly show that the EGFR is converted to a constitutively active form by disruption of the sugar chain at Asn-420. It therefore appears that the sugar chain at Asn-420 is involved in the controllable ligand-induced activation of the EGFR. Furthermore, we also created the additional mutant EGFR, Asn-328/337/389 → Gln, in which only Asn-420 was intact in domain III and transiently transfected the triple mutant into COS-1 cells, in order to determine whether glycosylation at Asn-420 is sufficient for the receptor function. However, immunoblotting analysis with anti-EGFR antibody showed that this mutant protein was not expressed in COS-1 cells, similar to the case of the Asn-all → Gln mutant (data not shown). It seems unlikely that a loss of the sugar chain in the extracellular region would directly affect a function involving the cytosolic domain, which is located across the membrane, without any primary effect on the structure or function of the extracellular portion. Therefore, it would be more reasonable to hypothesize that the consequence of the mutation at Asn-420 is associated with an alteration in a function that is intrinsic to the extracellular portion, rather than the cytosolic domain. Thus, we prepared and characterized the recombinant His-tagged sEGFR for the Asn-420 → Gln mutant in order to investigate the more detailed role of the Asn-420-linked sugar chain. Fig.3 A shows the schematic representation of the His-tagged sEGFR, in which an entire extracellular domain is followed by a (Gly)3 and (His)6 tag at the C terminus. The protein would be predicted to consist of 628 amino acids after the cleavage of the signal peptide. The sEGFRs for the wild-type, Asn-328 → Gln, Asn-337 → Gln, and Asn-420 → Gln were successfully expressed in the Sf-21 cells infected with the recombinant baculoviruses and were efficiently secreted into the culture medium. The recombinant sEGFRs were purified from the culture medium using a Ni2+-chelating Sepharose FF column. The Asn-389 → Gln sEGFR was not produced in the infected insect cells. SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analyses of the purified recombinant sEGFRs demonstrated bands at 90 and 88 kDa for the wild-type and the mutants, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3 (B andC). The difference of 2 kDa appears to be consistent with the loss of a single sugar chain, suggesting that Asn-328, Asn-337, and Asn-420 are actually glycosylated in the insect cells. It may reasonably be considered that the impairment of the extracellular domain function, which is associated with a dimer formation, may lead to the EGF-independent activation in the Asn-420 → Gln mutant EGFR because the receptor dimerization, involving the extracellular domain, is thought to be a critical step in the mechanism of receptor activation (6.Sorokin A. Lemmon M.A. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9752-9759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Heldin C.-H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar). Thus, the purified sEGFRs were subjected to chemical cross-linking experiments, in order to examine whether the Asn-420 → Gln mutant undergoes spontaneous dimerization/oligomerization. The wild-type and Asn-420 → Gln sEGFRs were incubated in the presence or absence of EGF and subsequently treated with DSS, a covalent cross-linking reagent. The resulting cross-linked products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. The wild-type sEGFR remained in a monomeric form in the absence of EGF, whereas the sEGFR formed a dimer in response to the addition of the ligand (Fig.4 A). This suggests that the dimerization of the wild type is properly regulated by the binding of EGF. In addition, the band at approximately 100 kDa that was found in the presence of both EGF and DSS indicates that the monomer sEGFR complexed with EGF. The same was true in the case of the Asn-328 → Gln and Asn-337 → Gln mutant sEGFRs, as shown in Fig. 4 B. These data suggest that the His-tagged sEGFRs for the wild-type and these mutants are functionally active in terms of binding to EGF and ligand-induced dimerization. On the other hand, no band corresponding to the monomeric form was observed in the Asn-420 → Gln mutant sEGFR, but rather it was found that the Asn-420 → Gln sEGFR is highly oligomerized even in the absence of EGF, as shown by the much larger cross-linked products. These results clearly indicate that the disruption of the sugar chain linked to Asn-420 induces the spontaneous oligomerization of the extracellular domain of the receptor, in a manner that is independent of EGF stimulation. It therefore appears that the receptor dimerization, which is regulated by the EGF-binding, involves the sugar chain at Asn-420. Since domains II and IV in the extracellular portion of the receptor are cysteine-rich regions (8.Ullrich A. Coussens L. Hayflick J.S. Dull T.J. Gray A. Tam A.W. Lee J. Yarden Y. Libermann T.A. Schlessinger J. Downward J. Mayes E.L.V. Whittle N. Waterfield M.D. Seeburg P.H. Nature. 1984; 309: 418-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (1996) Google Scholar), the possibility that spontaneous oligomerization results from the aggregation by abnormal intermolecular disulfide linkages cannot be excluded. To test this possibility, SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified wild-type and Asn-420 → Gln sEGFRs was carried out under non-reducing conditions. The non-reduced proteins exhibited essentially the same profiles as the reduced ones, and therefore it seems unlikely that the oligomerization is due to the intermolecular covalent interactions (data not shown). To further explore the nature of the oligomerization in the Asn-420 → Gln mutant, it is necessary to ascertain the involvement of non-covalent interaction in spontaneous oligomerization. The transition between monomeric and oligomeric states was investigated by monitoring their fractions at various protein concentrations. It was found that the oligomer derived from Asn-420 → Gln sEGFR is dissociated into monomer and dimer at sufficiently low concentrations (Fig.5). Thus, the results suggest that the loss of the Asn-420-linked sugar chain facilitates oligomer formation via non-covalent interactions, and it appears that the equilibrium for the transition is shifted greatly toward oligomer formation in the mutant. To examine the effect of the elimination of the Asn-420-linked sugar chain on the binding of EGF, the wild-type and Asn-420 → Gln mutant sEGFRs were subjected to a binding assay using 125I-EGF. The dissociation constantK d of EGF for the wild-type sEGFR was found to be approximately 1.0 × 10−7m, as determined by Scatchard analysis (Fig.6, A and B). This value obtained for the tagged sEGFR was in good agreement with the value reported for a non-tagged form (16.Greenfield C. Hiles I. Waterfield M.D. Federwisch M. Wollmer A. Blundell T.L.

In the Asn-420 → Gln mutant sEGFR, however, essentially no binding was observed, even at the highest concentration of the ligand. Thus, it appears that the disruption of the sugar chain at Asn-420 in the sEGFR impairs ligand binding. The results are consistent with the suggestion that the sugar chain also plays an essential role in the binding of EGF, even though it is not clear, at present, whether its involvement is direct or indirect. In this study, several domain III-N-glycosylation mutants of the EGFR were prepared and characterized, in order to identify a sugar chain that is important or essential in the receptor function such as ligand binding, regulated dimerization, or ligand-induced autophosphorylation. The results showed that the loss of the sugar chain linked to Asn-420 leads to spontaneous oligomerization, which results in the ligand independent activation of the receptor. Thus, it could be demonstrated that the Asn-420-linked sugar chain plays an essential role in the properly regulated dimerization of the EGFR by the ligand. The sugar chain identified in this study appears to “prevent” the spontaneous activation of the receptor, and the findings therefore suggest that the sugar chain is absolutely required to maintain the controllable properties of the receptor by ligand. It was also found that the Asn-420 → Gln mutant of the sEGFR does not bind EGF, suggesting that the Asn-420-linked sugar chain is also required for the interaction of the receptor with the ligand. Since the oligomer form of the Asn-420 → Gln mutant sEGFR is dissociated at sufficiently low concentrations of the protein (Fig. 5), oligomer formation seems to be reversible. On the other hand, although the equilibrium of dimerization or oligomerization in the wild-type sEGFR is in favor of the monomer state in the absence of the ligands, the binding of the ligands and the subsequent conformational changes of the receptor would shift the equilibrium in the direction of oligomer formation. In this respect, it is likely that the equilibrium in the Asn-420 → Gln mutant would intrinsically be shifted toward a higher level of oligomerization. Domain III, which contains an Asn-420-linked sugar chain, is capable of binding ligands but not dimer formation even in the presence of the ligand, as indicated by a study using an isolated limited-proteolytic fragment that includes this domain (20.Kohda D. Odaka M. Lax I. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Inagaki F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1976-1981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It seems more likely that oligomerization of the receptor involves other domain such as domain IV, which may play a role in the dimerization of the receptor. Therefore, it is entirely possible that the mutated domain III that lacks the Asn-420-linked sugar chain could mimic the ligand-bound state of the wild-type domain III and thereby induce oligomerization dependently on other domain(s), thus conferring receptor-receptor interaction. The binding affinity of sEGFR toward EGF appears to be dramatically increased on dimerization (or oligomerization), even if the dimer is formed by covalent cross-linking (16.Greenfield C. Hiles I.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Thus, it is reasonably likely that the affinity is significantly higher in the dimerized or oligomerized state, as opposed to the monomer state. However, although the Asn-420 → Gln sEGFR appears to be oligomerized, essentially no binding is observed at an EGF concentration of 500 nm in the binding assay. The replacements at other N-glycosylation sites in domain III had no effect on EGF-induced receptor autophosphorylation (Fig. 2 B), and thus it seems certain that these mutants bind EGF. These findings indicate the unique importance of the Asn-420-linked sugar chain in the binding of EGF as well as the controllable dimerization because, of four sugar chains in the domain, only the Asn-420-linked sugar chain plays an essential role in the binding of EGF. It is known that the K d value for the binding of mammalian EGF to chicken EGFR, which lacks the sugar chain corresponding to the human Asn-420-linked chain in domain III, is 100 times higher than that in human EGFR (31.Lax I. Johnson A. Howk R. Sap J. Bellot F. Winkler M. Ullrich A. Vennstrom B. Schlessinger J. Givol D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1970-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The analyses, which used a series of chimeric chicken/human EGFRs, indicated that domain III of the chicken receptor is responsible for this lower affinity to EGF (22.Lax I. Bellot F. Howk R. Ullrich A. Givol D. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Although structural determinants for the distinct binding properties of the chicken receptor have been investigated in terms of the difference in the primary structure of domain III (32.Wu D.G.

Biochem. 1994; 225: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), this could, in part, be explained by the lack of the equivalent sugar chain whose loss leads to the impairment of EGF binding in human EGFR. Nevertheless, the issue of whether the sugar chain is directly associated with the binding currently remains unclear, and it is also possible that the sugar chain may be involved in the correct folding of the domain and/or is required to maintain the conformation of domain III, so that efficient EGF binding can take place. Because of the defect in the ligand-regulated activation of the receptor, the Asn-420 → Gln EGFR appears to have been converted to a constitutive active form. Spontaneous oligomerization accompanied by tyrosine phosphorylation has been reported for oncogenic mutants of EGFR and its related growth factor receptors, the ErbB family (35.Weiner D.B. Liu J. Cohen J.A. Williams W.V. Greene M.I. Nature. 1989; 339: 230-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 36.Moscatello D.K. Montgomery R.B. Sundareshan P. McDanel H. Wong M.Y. Wong A.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 85-96PubMed Google Scholar), and therefore these abnormal properties would be closely associated with their transforming activities. The controllable properties of growth factor receptors such as EGFR must be absolutely required for an appropriate response of cells to stimulation by growth factors, since the impairment of the regulated transmembrane signaling could lead to uncontrolled cell growth, e.g. transformation, or other abnormalities, such as altered intracellular signal transduction and defects in the growth factor-stimulated cell growth. Our present study clearly revealed the significance and involvement of a specificN-linked sugar chain in the regulated activation of growth factor receptor and also provide new insights into the mechanism of ligand-induced receptor activation. Furthermore, the findings here would support the view of a specific role of an Asn-linked sugar chain in the function of a glycoprotein.

Interaction of apoE with DMPC was assessed by vesicle disruption, turbidimetric clearing, and gel filtration assays. The results indicate that the formation of apoE·DMPC discoidal particles occurs in a series of steps. A triple disulfide mutant, in which all four helices were tethered, did not form complexes but could release encapsulated 5-(6)-carboxylfluorescein from DMPC vesicles, indicating that the initial interaction does not involve major reorganization of the helical bundle. Initial interaction is followed by the opening of the four-helix bundle to expose the hydrophobic faces of the amphipathic helices. In this step, helices 1 and 2 and helices 3 and 4 preferentially remain paired, since these disulfide-linked mutants bound to DMPC in a manner similar to that of the 22-kDa fragment of apoE4. In contrast, mutants in which helices 2 and 3 and/or helices 1 and 4 paired bound poorly to DMPC. However, all single and double helical pairings resulted in the formation of larger discs than were formed by the 22-kDa fragment, indicating that further reorganization of the helices occurs following the initial opening of the four-helix bundle in which the protein assumes its final lipid-bound conformation. In support of this rearrangement, reducing the disulfide bonds converted the large disulfide mutant discs to normal size.

Through its high affinity interaction with the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family, apoE regulates plasma triglyceride clearance and contributes to plasma cholesterol homeostasis (1.Mahley R.W.

Association of apoE with lipid is required for many of its functions, including high affinity binding to the LDL receptor (6.Innerarity T.L. Pitas R.E. Mahley R.W. J. Biol.

FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1485-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). However, the conformational changes in apoE associated with lipid binding remain unclear. Intact human apoE (299 amino acids) contains two independently folded domains (7.Wetterau J.R. Aggerbeck L.P. Rall Jr., S.C. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol.

Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the lipid-free state, the 22-kDa domain contains a four-helix bundle (10.Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Agard D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Each helix is amphipathic, and its hydrophobic face is oriented toward the center of the bundle. This structure shares the same basic architecture as the five-helix bundle found in apolipophorin III (apoLpIII) fromLocusta migratoria (11.Breiter D.R. Kanost M.R. Benning M.M. Wesenberg G. Law J.H. Wells M.A. Rayment I. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and Manduca sexta (12.Wang J. Gagné S.M. Sykes B.D. Ryan R.O. J. Biol.

Amphipathic α-helices represent the lipid-binding structural motifs found in plasma apolipoproteins (13.Segrest J.P. Garber D.W. Brouillette C.G. Harvey S.C. Anantharamaiah G.M. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 303-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While the 22-kDa fragment by itself does not bind to spherical lipoprotein particles, it does bind to and reorganize phospholipid vesicles to form bilayer discoidal complexes. In this lipid-associated state, the 22-kDa fragment displays normal high affinity binding to the LDL receptor (14.Innerarity T.L. Friedlander E.J. Rall Jr., S.C. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12341-12347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was hypothesized that the four-helix bundle undergoes a lipid-triggered reorganization of the helices that exposes the hydrophobic faces to interact with lipid (2.Weisgraber K.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), similar to the model proposed for apoLpIII (11.Breiter D.R. Kanost M.R. Benning M.M. Wesenberg G. Law J.H. Wells M.A. Rayment I. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Molecular area measurements at an air-water interface support this hypothesis (15.Weisgraber K.H. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Miller N.E. Tall A.R. High Density Lipoproteins and Atherosclerosis III. Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam1992: 175-181Google Scholar). Recently, fluorescence resonance energy transfer studies showed that the distance between helices 1 and 3 of the bundle undergoes a dramatic change in binding to lipid (16.Fisher C.A. Ryan R.O. J. Lipid. Res. 1999; 40: 93-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), also suggesting conformational reorganization of the helical bundle. Several studies demonstrated that there is no significant change in α-helical content when apoE binds to various lipid surfaces (9.Aggerbeck L.P. Wetterau J.R. Weisgraber K.H. Wu C.-S.C. Lindgren F.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6249-6258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Mims M.P. Soma M.R. Morrisett J.D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6639-6647Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that the conformational changes associated with the lipid binding involve rearrangement of the relative positions of the helices without a major disruption of the secondary structure. Two models of the conformation of apoE on phospholipid discs have been proposed: the “picket fence” model, in which amphipathic helices are aligned parallel to the phospholipid acyl chains (18.De Pauw M. Vanloo B. Weisgraber K. Rosseneu M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10953-10960Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and the “belt” model in which the helices are aligned perpendicular to the acyl chains (19.Raussens V. Fisher C.A.

In the present study, lipid-triggered conformational unfolding of apoE was investigated using a disulfide bond engineering approach. The results demonstrate that the interactions of apoE with dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) can be viewed as a series of steps, including initial interaction, lipid-triggered opening of the four-helix bundle, and further reorganization of the helices to achieve the final lipid-bound conformation. A thioredoxin fusion expression vector, pET32-E4NT (20.Morrow J.A. Arnold K.S. Weisgraber K.H. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 16: 224-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), containing the full-length human apoE4 cDNA lacking cysteine codons, served as the starting template. Using site-directed mutagenesis with the polymerase chain reaction (20.Morrow J.A. Arnold K.S. Weisgraber K.H. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 16: 224-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 21.Dong L.-M. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19053-19057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), we introduced a stop codon immediately after codon 191 to generate the construct expressing the amino-terminal 22-kDa fragment. Further polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis with mutagenic oligonucleotide primers (Oligos Etc., Wilsonville, OR) was performed to introduce cysteine residues at selected positions. ClonedPfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) was used for high fidelity amplifications. All constructs were sequenced to confirm the presence of the desired mutations and to ensure that no other mutations were introduced during amplification. The apoE4 22-kDa fragment and the cysteine-containing mutants were expressed by transforming the appropriate expression constructs into a T7 expression strain Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) (Novagen). Expression of thioredoxin-apoE fusion protein was induced for 2 h at 37 °C by adding isopropyl β-d-thioglactopyranoside (100 mg/liter final concentration) to a culture at its midlog phase (A 660 ∼ 0.6). The induced cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in a small volume of extraction buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 5 mmimidazole, and 500 mm NaCl. The fusion protein was extracted by sonication (Branson Sonifier 450) and purified by His·Bind resin according to the manufacture's procedures (Novagen). Fusion proteins were cleaved by incubation with thrombin (Hematologic Technologies) for 2 h at room temperature at a ratio of 1:100 (thrombin/fusion protein (w/w)). Recombinant proteins were denatured in 6 m guanidine-HCl (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% β-mercaptoethenol (BME) (Sigma) and purified on a Sephacryl S-300 HR (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (4 × 120 cm) eluted with 4m guanidine-HCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% BME. Fractions containing apoE were identified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blotting with a rabbit anti-human apoE polyclonal antibody, as described previously (20.Morrow J.A. Arnold K.S. Weisgraber K.H. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 16: 224-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Refolding of mutant proteins was carried out according to our established procedure for apoE 22-kDa fragments used in receptor-binding assays (20.Morrow J.A. Arnold K.S. Weisgraber K.H. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 16: 224-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and x-ray crystallography (22.Dong L.-M. Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Simmons T. Mahley R.W. Weisgraber K.H. Agard D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22358-22365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the apoE-containing fractions, at concentrations less than 0.01 mg/ml, were dialyzed extensively against 5 mm NH4HCO3, 0.1% BME, to allow refolding of the protein into its native conformation. The BME was subsequently removed by dialysis against 5 mmNH4HCO3 to allow air oxidization and disulfide bond formation. The disulfide-linked forms were separated from mutant proteins species containing free sulfhydryl groups by activated Thiol-6B chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Final purification and concentration was performed by DEAE chromatography (Seperco) on a BioCAD 700E workstation (Perspective Systems). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al.(23.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant proteins were characterized by circular dichroism in both the free cysteine and disulfide-linked forms with an apoE4 22-kDa fragment as a control. Proteins (250 μg/ml) were dialyzed in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and circular dichroism measurements were made on a JASCO 715 spectropolarometer at 222 nm ([θ]222) at 25 °C. The α-helical content was calculated from the molar elipticity values derived from the following equation (24.Sparks D.L. Phillips M.C. Lund-Katz S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25830-25838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). %α­helix=(−[θ] 222+3000)/39,000 The formation of interhelical disulfide bonds was assessed by two independent methods: fluorescence chemical modification and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Mutant proteins (5 μg) in their free cysteine and disulfide-linked forms were incubated with equal volumes of SDS loading buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 25% glycerol, and 2% SDS), containing 20 mmfluorescein 5-maleimide (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), at room temperature for 30 min and subjected to nonreducing SDS-PAGE on 10–20% gels. After the electrophoresis, the gel was visualized with an ultraviolet transluminator and photographed. Free sulfhydryl groups were detected by fluorescence reactivity (25.McLachlin D.T. Dunn S.D. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 7: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The same gel was then stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 to visualize all of the protein bands and to determine the mobility shifts resulting from interhelical disulfide bonds (26.Scheele G. Jacoby R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12277-12282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified apoE3 22-kDa fragment, which contains a single cysteine residue, was used as a control. DMPC (Avanti Polar-Lipids) was resuspended in benzene and lyophilized into dry powder, which was dispersed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA, with and without the presence of 100 mm 5-(6)-carboxylfluorescein (CF) (Molecular Probes) to a final lipid concentration of 10 mg/ml. Small unilamellar vesicles were prepared by sonicating the DMPC solution at 24 °C for 20 min. The CF-containing vesicles were purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to remove nonencapsulated CF. The concentration of DMPC was determined with a phospholipid assay kit (Wako Chemicals). The release of fluorescent dye from CF-containing DMPC vesicles was monitored on a Hitachi spectrofluorometer F-2000, with excitation and emission set at 480 and 518 nm, respectively. The increase in fluorescence due to the release of dye from the DMPC vesicles was recorded after adding 10 μl of protein (1 μm final concentration) to a jacketed cuvette containing 500 μl of DMPC solution (60 μm final concentration) at 23.9 °C (DMPC transition temperature). All solutions and protein samples were preincubated at 23.9 °C. The abilities of the mutants to reorganize DMPC vesicles into apoE·DMPC discoidal complexes was determined by the decrease in turbidity (clearing) of DMPC solutions, as monitored by the decrease in 90° light scattering on a Hitachi spectrofluorometer F-2000 with both excitation and emission set at 600 nm (27.Pownall H.J.

The samples were maintained at 23.9 °C in a jacketed cuvette and continuously stirred with a magnetic bar. All solutions and protein samples were preincubated at 23.9 °C. The kinetic curves were fitted to a single exponential decay function (GraphPad Prism, version 2.0) from which the t 12, defined as the time required for a 50% decrease of the initial turbidity, was calculated (27.Pownall H.J. Massey J.B. Kusserow S.K. Gotto Jr., A.M. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1183-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The 22-kDa fragments of apoE4 and the cysteine-containing mutants (100 μg) were added to DMPC vesicles (375 μg) (3.75:1, DMPC/apoE, w/w) with and without reducing reagents (1% BME and 100 mm dithiothreitol) and incubated at 23.9 °C for 10 h to allow apoE·DMPC complexes to form. The reaction mixture was applied to a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to separate the apoE·DMPC complexes from unbound protein. The column was eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The unbound protein was quantified by area integration based on a standard curve obtained from applying known amounts of apoE 22-kDa fragment to the column. Relative apoE·DMPC disc sizes were compared by the elution time of the complex on Superdex 200 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (29.Dong L.-M. Innerarity T.L. Arnold K.S.

The purified apoE·DMPC complexes were dialyzed against 125 mm NH4OAc, 2.6 mmNH4HCO2, and 0.26 mmNa4EDTA, pH 7.4 (30.Forte T.M. Nordhausen R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 442-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and negatively stained on the surface of carbon grids. Electron micrographs were made at a magnification of × 200,000 and imported into an Image 1/AT image analysis system. Particle size was analyzed by automated sizing and counting programs available on system software (Universal Imaging). A total of 350 discs from multiple areas were sampled. Based on computer modeling of the x-ray crystal structure of the 22-kDa fragment of apoE4 (22.Dong L.-M. Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Simmons T. Mahley R.W. Weisgraber K.H. Agard D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22358-22365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), sites for pairs of cysteine mutations were selected based on favorable interhelical distances (Cα–Cα, 4–7 Å) and steriochemistry for disulfide bond formation (31.Matsumura M. Matthews B.W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 202: 336-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Four pairs of potential linkage positions were selected: single disulfide mutants 30C-67C linking helices 1 and 2, 57C-112C linking helices 2 and 3, 30C-152C linking helices 1 and 4, and 122C-130C linking helices 3 and 4; double disulfide mutants linking helices 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 or helices 1 and 4 and 2 and 3; and a triple disulfide mutant linking all four helices (Fig. 1 A). These disulfide bonds would either pair two helices together or, in the case of triple pair mutant, prevent the helical bundle from opening (Fig.1 B). The guanidine-denatured cysteine-containing mutants were allowed to refold at low concentrations into the four-helix bundle structures under reducing conditions before allowing air oxidation to form the disulfide bonds. This procedure minimized the possibility that intermolecular disulfide bonds would form and, in cases of four and six cysteines, that the designed pairs would most likely be formed. In addition, any misfolded structures containing either intermolecular or nonexpected intramolecular disulfide linkages would probably contain free sulfhydryl groups. Free sulfhydryl groups in fact were observed in high molecular mass bands (data not shown). These proteins were removed by thiopropyl affinity chromotography. Secondary structures of apoE and the cysteine mutant 22-kDa fragments in the reduced and disulfide-linked states were determined by circular dichroism measurements. The α-helical content of the mutants was 56–64%, identical to the 60% content in the apoE4 22-kDa fragment. These results demonstrate that the introduced cysteine residues and the formation of disulfide bonds do not significantly affect the overall four-helix bundle structure. Disulfide bond formation was assessed with two independent methods: SDS-PAGE gel shifts (26.Scheele G. Jacoby R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12277-12282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a chemical modification method with the cysteine-specific reagent fluorescein 5-maleimide (25.McLachlin D.T. Dunn S.D. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 7: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Intramolecular disulfide bonds increase the mobility of proteins in SDS-PAGE compared with reduced forms (26.Scheele G. Jacoby R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12277-12282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), probably resulting from a more compact structure. With one exception, the nonreduced disulfide-linked mutants displayed greater mobility than reduced samples and apoE4 22-kDa fragment (Fig. 2 A). Mutant 122C-130C did not display a shift, probably due to the small loop size of eight amino acid residues formed between the two cysteine residues (Fig. 2 A). All of the double and triple disulfide bond mutants showed similar shifts (data not shown). The formation of disulfide bonds was verified by lack of reactivity with fluorescein 5-maleimide. None of the nonreduced mutants reacted with the fluorescein 5-maleimide (Fig. 2 B), demonstrating the absence of free sulfhydryl groups in these proteins. Phase transition release of a self-quenching fluorescent dye, such as CF, has been used to monitor interactions of apolipoproteins with phospholipid vesicles (32.Weinstein D.B. Heider J.G. Am. J. Med. 1989; 86 Suppl. 4A: 27-32Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (51) Google Scholar). When CF is encapsulated in phospholipid vesicles at a sufficiently high concentration (∼100 mm), its fluorescence is self-quenched (32.Weinstein D.B. Heider J.G. Am. J. Med. 1989; 86 Suppl. 4A: 27-32Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Interaction of apolipoproteins with the phospholipid vesicles disrupts the vesicles, releasing and diluting the CF, which results in a fluorescent signal. Therefore, the initial interaction between protein and lipid can be assessed from the increase in fluorescence. The addition of both apoE4 and disulfide-linked 22-kDa mutants resulted in a rapid release of the encapsulated CF (Fig.3). Although we cannot rule out the possibility of slight differences among the mutants, these results indicate that pairing of the helices or even tethering the whole helical bundle (in the case of triple disulfide mutant) did not appreciably affect the ability of apoE to interact with DMPC vesicles. The triple mutant results demonstrate that initial interaction with DMPC vesicles does not require the complete opening of the four-helix bundle. The triple disulfide mutant, which effectively prevents the four-helix bundle from opening (Fig. 1 B), was designed to test the hypothesis that opening of the bundle is required to form apoE·DMPC discoidal complexes (2.Weisgraber K.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Complex formation was monitored with a turbidimetric clearing assay (Fig.4). The ability of the reduced form of the triple disulfide mutant to remodel DMPC vesicles into discs was similar to that of the apoE4 22-kDa fragment (t 12 = 4.5 ± 0.3 versus 4.2 ± 0.3 min), demonstrating that the cysteine substitutions did not significantly affect lipid binding. However, the triple disulfide mutant was severely defective in its ability to clear the DMPC solution (Fig. 4), supporting the hypothesis that opening of the four-helix bundle of apoE is required to form discoidal DMPC complexes. To investigate the possibility that helices remain paired in binding to DMPC, two groups of pairing were examined: group I, helices 1 and 2 and helices 3 and 4 remained paired; group II, helices 1 and 4 and helices 2 and 3 remained paired. Both groups were tested for their lipid binding abilities. In a reduced form, all of the mutants displayed identical abilities as the apoE4 22-kDa fragment to clear DMPC solutions (data not shown). Although the disulfide-linked forms exhibited slower rates of clearing, group II mutants were much less efficient in clearing than group I mutants (Fig. 5, TableI). As assessed in the gel filtration assay by the amount of free unbound protein, the ability of the group I mutants to form complexes was more similar to that of the apoE4 22-kDa fragment (Fig. 6, Table I). The group II mutants had significantly more unbound protein. Taken together, these results demonstrated that helices 1 and 2 and helices 3 and 4 are likely to remain in close proximity following the initial binding of apoE to the DMPC vesicles in the early stage of complex formation.Table ICharacterization of apoE · DMPC discsMutantsHelix linkageTurbidimetric clearing assay t 1/2Gel filtration assayNegative staining disc diameterElution time aElution time of the complex from a Superdex 200 column under conditions described under “Experimental Procedures.”Unbound protein bDetermined from the area integration of high pressure liquid chromatography profiles.minmin%nmControl ApoE4 22-kDa fragment4.2 ± 0.321.25 ± 0.0215.5 ± 5.316.7 ± 1.9Group I mutants 30C-67C1–212.2 ± 2.420.15 ± 0.0118.5 ± 6.120.2 ± 3.9 122C-130C3–415.0 ± 2.120.25 ± 0.0516.5 ± 8.319.8 ± 7.4 30C-67C/122C-130C1–2/3–418.4 ± 3.218.55 ± 0.0228.0 ± 5.326.5 ± 7.9Group II mutants 30C-152C1–462.8 ± 5.314.22 ± 0.0355.8 ± 10.4 cp < 0.01 versuscontrols.30.4 ± 8.1 57C-112C2–350.1 ± 4.020.25 ± 0.0546.3 ± 8.1 cp < 0.01 versuscontrols.20.7 ± 4.9 30C-152C/57C-122C1–4/2–382.6 ± 7.317.10 ± 0.0268.4 ± 12.3 cp < 0.01 versuscontrols.32.5 ± 6.1Triple mutant 30C-152C/57C-112C/122C-130C1–4–2–3NC dNC, no clearing.ND eND, not determined.ND eND, not determined.ND eND, not determined.a Elution time of the complex from a Superdex 200 column under conditions described under “Experimental Procedures.”b Determined from the area integration of high pressure liquid chromatography profiles.c p < 0.01 versuscontrols.d NC, no clearing.e ND, not determined.

The larger disc sizes of the disulfide mutants were confirmed by negative staining electron microscopy (Fig.7). Disc diameters were 120–165% of these formed with the apoE4 22-kDa fragment complexes (19.8–32.5versus 16.7 ± 1.9 nm). To examine the suggestion that the helices underwent a further rearrangement in assuming their final conformation on discs, the complexes were isolated by gel filtration, treated with reducing reagents (1% BME and 100 mm dithiothreitol), and repassed on a gel filtration column. Disulfide bond reduction converted the large mutant complexes into normal size complexes (Fig.8), demonstrating that the helices are capable of reorganizing while bound to DMPC. These results suggest that following initial interaction with DMPC, in which the helices are paired, a further rearrangement occurs as apoE assumes its final conformation on the discs. Using engineered interhelical disulfide bonds, we investigated the molecular interactions and conformational changes of the four-helix bundle of apoE in binding to DMPC to form discoidal particles. The data support a multistep process that begins with the initial interaction of apoE with the DMPC vesicle surface. This step is followed by the opening of the four-helix bundle as the protein begins to remodel the lipid vesicles into discs. In the final step, the helices undergo additional rearrangement as they assume their final conformation on a disc. Previous studies demonstrated that human apoA-1 adopts a partially unfolded, molten globular-like state that was suggested to play an important role in lipid binding (33.Gursky O. Atkinson D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2991-2995Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Recently, it was suggested that a partially unfolded conformation of apoLpIII, in which the hydrophobic core of the bundle is hydrated, is associated with increased lipid binding (34.Soulages J.L. Bendavid O.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10203-10210Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although the final conformations of both apoLpIII (11.Breiter D.R. Kanost M.R. Benning M.M. Wesenberg G.

Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam1992: 175-181Google Scholar) bound to lipid appear to involve open helical bundle conformations, it was not clear whether apoE or apoLpIII undergoes a major unfolding in the initial interaction with lipid. Two possibilities have been suggested for apoLpIII. First, a short stretch of hydrophobic residues in the loops connecting helices 1 and 2 and helices 3 and 4 initiates binding (11.Breiter D.R. Kanost M.R. Benning M.M. Wesenberg G. Law J.H. Wells M.A. Rayment I. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 36.Narayanaswami V. Wang J. Schieve D.

A. 1995; 92: 5650-5654Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Second, electrostatic interactions between charged residues on the protein exterior and phospholipid head groups are responsible for the initial interaction (38.Zhang Y. Lewis R.N.A.H. McElhaney R.N. Ryan R.O. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3942-3952Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The results from our fluorescence release studies (Fig. 3) in which the triple disulfide mutant of apoE 22-kDa fragment effectively prevented the four-helix bundle from completely opening, indicated that exposing the entire hydrophobic core is not required for initial lipid interaction in the case of apoE. However, since the 122–130 link is at the base of helices 3 and 4 (Fig. 1), which would allow some flexibility at the opposite end of the bundle, we cannot completely rule out the possibility of partial exposure of hydrophobic residues at this end of the molecule in the initial interaction. Recent x-ray crystallography studies of multiple apoE crystal forms revealed a conformational flexibility at one end of the four-helix bundle (39.Segelke B.W. Forstner M. Knapp M. Trakhanov S.D. Parkin S. Newhouse Y.M. Bellamy H.D. Weisgraber K.H. Rupp B. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 886-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The flexible regions included the loop linking helices 2 and 3 (residues 78–90, referred as the 80s loop) and distortions in the ends of helices 3 and 4. It was suggested that this highly flexible end of the bundle plays an important role in initiation of lipid binding and initial unfolding of the bundle (39.Segelke B.W. Forstner M. Knapp M. Trakhanov S.D. Parkin S. Newhouse Y.M. Bellamy H.D. Weisgraber K.H. Rupp B. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 886-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the 80s loop is enriched in negatively charged acidic residues (Glu79, Glu80, Glu87, and Glu88); one possibility is that these negative charges initiate interaction with positive charges on the phospholipid headgroups. Alternatively, the conformational flexibility at this end of apoE might also partially expose the hydrophobic core and trigger the bundle opening. Thus, at this point, it is not clear if the initial interaction is mediated by ionic or hydrophobic interactions or both. Resolving this issue will require additional studies, including site-directed mutagenesis of the 80s loop. According to the proposed hypothesis for the interaction of apoE with DMPC, the four-helix bundle undergoes a lipid-triggered conformational opening (2.Weisgraber K.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Weisgraber K.H. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Miller N.E. Tall A.R. High Density Lipoproteins and Atherosclerosis III. Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam1992: 175-181Google Scholar). The fact that the triple disulfide mutant could not remodel DMPC vesicles into discoidal complexes (Fig. 4) provides direct evidence that opening of the bundle is required for disc formation. The results with the single and double disulfide mutants (Figs. 6 and 7) indicate that, at least initially, the opening happens in a manner in which helices 1 and 2 and helices 3 and 4 remain paired. However, the fact that the DMPC discs formed by these mutants are larger than those formed by apoE4 (Figs. 6 and 7, Table I) indicates an inability to achieve a final lipid-bound conformation, suggesting that the paired helices undergo additional rearrangement in assuming the final conformation. This additional rearrangement of the helices was demonstrated when the large sized discs formed by the single and double disulfide mutants were reduced and shown to convert to normal size (Fig. 8). Thus, restricting helical movement or influencing structure by inserting additional residues, as occurs in apoE-Leiden (29.Dong L.-M. Innerarity T.L. Arnold K.S. Newhouse Y.M. Weisgraber K.H. J. Lipid. Res. 1998; 39: 1173-1180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), alters disc size. Thus, subtle differences in apoE can have a dramatic effect on disc size, suggesting that the final conformation of apoE is an important determinant of disc size. Although our studies indicate that helical reorganization is a major component in the multiple steps of interaction of apoE with DMPC, they do not directly address the issue of the final conformation of apoE on DMPC discs. Thus, the results do not allow us to distinguish between the “picket fence” (18.De Pauw M. Vanloo B. Weisgraber K. Rosseneu M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10953-10960Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and the “belt” models (19.Raussens V. Fisher C.A. Goormaghtigh E. Ryan R.O. Ruysschaert J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25825-25830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The final reorganization of helices is compatible with either model.

They represent the principal structural component of plant cell walls and are associated with lignin and other polysaccharides. Cellulose is a linear homopolymer of up to 14,000 glucose units linked by β-(1,4) glucosidic bonds forming rigid microfibrils that, in vivo, are assembled to hemicelluloses, mostly xylans and xyloglucans. Xylan is a heteropolymer consisting of a backbone of β-(1,4)-linked d-xylose residues with various branching saccharidic groups (e.g. glucuronic acid, arabinose). Xyloglucan is widely distributed in plants, being the principal hemicellulose component in the primary cell wall (20% of total cell wall) and one of the most abundant storage polysaccharides in seeds (>40% in weight in some species). This polymer is composed of a β-(1,4)-glucan backbone, with α-(1,6)-d-xylose groups linked to about 75% of the glucosyl residues. Thus, the disaccharide isoprimeverose (α-d-xylopyranosyl-(1,6)-d-glucopyranose) represents the building block of xyloglucan. Additional ramifications of β-d-galactosyl-(1,2)-α-xylosyl and α-l-fucosyl-(1,2)-β-d-galactosyl-(1,2)-α-xylosyl chains, are also α-(1,6)-linked at lesser extent to the main backbone. Xyloglucans from different plant tissues and species greatly vary in molecular mass and chemical composition: storage xyloglucans from seeds are not fucosylated if compared with the same polymer from primary cell walls (1.Crombie H.J. Chengappa S. Hellyer A. Reid J.S.G. Plant J. 1998; 15: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The degradation and recycling of cellulose and xylan are well studied processes, involving cellulolytic microorganisms, which play an important role in the biosphere (for reviews see Refs. 2.Béguin P. Aubert J. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 13: 25-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 3.Warren R.A.J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 183-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Instead, relatively little is known about the mechanism of xyloglucan degradation and the enzymatic systems involved in the metabolism of isoprimeverose and xyloglucan oligosaccharides. In plant seeds, the hydrolysis of xyloglucan occurs after germination, during the mobilization of this storage polysaccharide, and has been extensively studied in nasturtium seeds (Tropaeolum majus L.). In this case, xyloglucan is hydrolyzed by the concerted action of at least four enzymatic activities: an endo-(1,4)-β-glucanase yields xyloglucan fragments that are substrates of a β-galactosidase and of two xyloglucan-oligosaccharide-specific α-xylosidase and β-glucosidase enzymes (1.Crombie H.J. Chengappa S. Hellyer A. Reid J.S.G. Plant J. 1998; 15: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Only few examples have been reported of enzymes able to hydrolyze xyloglucan oligosaccharides from eukaryal and bacterial microorganisms (4.Matsushita J. Kato Y. Matsuda K. J.

Cellulolytic organisms and enzymes are widespread in Bacteria and Eukarya, whereas β-bond-specific glycosyl hydrolases are extremely rare in Archaea (for reviews see Refs. 10.Sunna A. Moracci M.

S. solfataricus was reported to utilize as sole carbon source peptides, several mono- and disaccharides, dextrins, and starch, whereas arabinogalactan, agarose, cellulose, and hemicellulose substrates could not support growth (14.De Rosa M.

Extremophiles. 1998; 2: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Although the substrate specificity of these gene products remains to be identified, they could be involved in the degradation and assimilation of plant polysaccharides. The only examples of glycosyl hydrolases characterized in this genus are a secreted α-amylase, an intracellular α-glucosidase from S. solfataricus strain 98/2 (17.Rolfsmeier M. Blum P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 482-485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Haseltine C. Rolfsmeier M. Blum P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 945-950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a β-glycosidase that has been purified from strains MT4 and P2 (19.Pisani F.M. Rella R. Raia C.A. Rozzo C. Nucci R. Gambacorta A.

The two α-glycosyl hydrolases are involved in the utilization of dextrins, whereas the function in vivo of the β-glycosidase (LacS), which is under active study in our laboratory, is still obscure (21.Cubellis M.V. Rozzo C. Montecucchi P. Rossi M. Gene. 1990; 94: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 22.Moracci M. Capalbo L. Ciaramella M. Rossi M. Prot.

Biol. 1997; 271: 789-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In an effort to determine the full set of glycosyl hydrolases produced by this hyperthermophilic Archaeon, we have identified a novel α-xylosidase (XylS) with high specificity for isoprimeverose and xyloglucan oligosaccharides. We describe here the cloning and heterologous expression of xylS and the enzymatic characterization of its gene product. xylS maps in a locus of the Sulfolobus chromosome, nearby the β-glycosidase gene (lacS), an open reading frame (ORF)1 encoding a putative sugar transport protein (major facilitator superfamily, msf) and another open reading frame of unknown function (orf3). We show here that XylS and LacS cooperate in the xyloglucan oligosaccharides hydrolysis in vitro. This is the first α-xylosidase described in Archaea: its molecular characterization has implications for the function in vivo and the evolution of these enzymes. S. solfataricuscells, strain MT4, were grown at 87 °C, pH 3.0 as described previously (14.De Rosa M. Gambacorta A. Bu'lock J.D. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1975; 86: 156-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) in a minimal salts medium supplemented either with yeast extract (0.1%) plus sucrose (0.2%), or with tamarind seed xyloglucan (0.2%), or with xyloglucan oligosaccharides (0.2%), or with isoprimeverose (0.2%) prepared as described below. Growth was monitored spectrophotometrically at 600 nm. In yeast extract plus sucrose medium, the generation time was about 6.5 h. Tamarind seed xyloglucan was obtained from Megazyme, Ireland. Xyloglucan oligosaccharides were prepared by treatment of polymer with endo-glucanase (Megazyme) in sodium acetate, 25 mm, pH 5.0, for 24 h at 40 °C. All commercially available substrates and Driselase were purchased from Sigma or Fluka. 4Np-β-isoprimeveroside and isoprimeverose were obtained by enzymatic synthesis as below described. TLC was performed on 0.25-mm layers of Silica Gel F254 (Merck). Solvents included EtOAc/methanol/water (70:20:10, v/v) for aryl glycosides, acetone/butanol/water (60:20:10, v/v) for disaccharides, and EtOAc/methanol/water (47:40:13, v/v) for malto- and xylo-oligosaccharides and their cleavage products. Column chromatographic separations were carried out using Silica Gel 60 (70–230 mesh; Merck). NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AMX 500 (500.13 MHz for 1H and 125.75 for 13C) spectrometer: chemical shifts are given in ppm (δ) scale using solvent signals as internal standard. 34 μmol of 4Np-α-d-xylopyranoside (9.2 mg) were dissolved in 1 ml of sodium acetate buffer, 50 mm, pH 5.0, and added to 67 μmol of 4Np-β-d-glucopyranoside. The reaction was started at 65 °C by addition of 0.2 mg of XylS. The reaction was complete after 2 h as indicated by complete disappearance of the donor as followed by TLC. The reaction mixture was rotary-evaporated and purified by preparative TLC, obtaining 2.6 mg (6 μmol) of the disaccharide 4Np-β-isoprimeveroside. 1H and13C NMR spectra in CD3OD/D2O of this compound show the following signals: δ: 5.18 (J 7.0 Hz, H-1 β-Glc) 4.84 (J 3.5 Hz, H-1 α-Xyl); δ: 101.2, 99.7, 77.4, 76.3, 74.9, 74.3, 73.2, 71.0, 70.9, 67.2, 62.6. After acetylation (pyrimidine/Ac2O overnight at room temperature), the spectra of acetylated derivative in CDCl3 show the following signals: 1H NMR spectra δ: 5.20 (H-1 β-Glc), 5.28 (H-2 β-Glc), 5.34 (H-3 β-Glc), 5.02 (H-4 β-Glc), 3.99 (H-5 β-Glc), 3.81–3.47 (H-6 β-Glc), 5.00 (H-1 α-Xyl), 4.80 (H-2 α-Xyl), 5.50 (H-3 α-Xyl), 4.91 (H-4 α-Xyl), 3.67–3.47 (H-5 α-Xyl). 13C NMR spectra, disaccharide moiety signals: δ: 98.4, 71.3, 72.7, 69.1, 73.7, 66.5 (C1-C6 β-Glc); 95.9, 71.3, 69.0, 69.3, 58.7 (C1-C5 α-Xyl). [α]D2057.5 (c = 26.2, chloroform). Correlation spectroscopy (COSY) and1H-13C correlation allowed assignments, as above indicated, of all carbon and proton signals in the acetylated derivative and secured about interglycosidic linkage of carbohydrate moieties. The free disaccharide isoprimeverose was prepared by the action of Driselase on 4Np-β-isoprimeveroside; the product was purified and characterized by NMR spectroscopy after acetylation. Diagnostic signals in the 13C NMR spectra of acetylated disaccharide at 58.43 (C5 α-Xyl) and 66.24 (C-6 of glucose unit) ppm secured about no change in the carbohydrate sequence in the product. Free sugar is re-obtained after methanolysis (sodium carbonate in anhydrous methanol). The gene encoding for XylS was cloned by amplification via polymerase chain reaction (PCR): in 50 μl of final volume, chromosomal DNA (100 ng) was used as a template;Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) was used as the enzyme (5 units) and included 12 nmol of dNTPs and 30 pmol of each of the following oligonucleotides: 5′-ATTCATTAATGAGAATAGGGAATTTAAATGTGGAAATAG and 5′-CGCGGATCCCTAACCCCTCTTAACTGTAATAGTTTCCTTACC, which introduce the AseI and BamHI sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the xylS gene, respectively. The program used was as follows: hot start 5 min at 95 °C, 2 min at 48 °C, 4 min at 72 °C; 10 cycles of 95 °C for 45 s, 48 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 4 min; 20 cycles of 95 °C for 45 s, 58 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 4 min; final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The resulting DNA fragment was ligated, after AseI-BamHI digestion, into the NdeI and BamHI cloning sites of plasmid pT7-SCII (United States Biochemical). In the resulting plasmid, pXyl, the xylS gene transcription start site is under control of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter, which drives high expression levels in bacterial hosts harboring the T7 RNA polymerase gene under control of an isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducible promoter. The xylS gene obtained after amplification was controlled by DNA sequencing. Escherichia coliBL21(DE3)/pXyl was grown in 2 liters of Super Broth at 37 °C. Expression of xylS was induced by the addition of 1 mm IPTG when the culture reached anA 600 level of 0.5. Growth allowed to proceed for 16 h, and cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 ×g and frozen at −20 °C. The resulting cell pellet was thawed, resuspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.3)/NaCl 150 mm/1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and homogenized by French cell pressure treatment. After centrifugation for 30 min at 40,000 × g, the crude extract was incubated with DNase I (50 μg ml−1 in 0.1 mm magnesium sulfate) for 1 h at room temperature and then heat-fractionated for 30 min at 55, 65, and 75 °C. The supernatant was dialyzed against sodium phosphate buffer (25 mm, pH 7.5) and applied to a Mono Q 10/10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which had been equilibrated with the same buffer. After washing with 5 column volumes with the loading buffer, the protein was eluted with a 500-ml linear gradient of 0–0.3 m NaCl at a flow rate of 1 ml min−1. Active fractions were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration on an Amicon YM30 membrane (cut off 30,000 Da), dialyzed against sodium phosphate buffer (25 mm, pH 7.5) containing 0.2m NaCl, and loaded onto a Sephadex 26/60 HiLoad column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Active fractions were pooled, dialyzed against sodium phosphate buffer (25 mm, pH 7.5), and concentrated; the analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) revealed that the sample was pure and was stored at −20 °C. Electrophoretic analysis was performed on an SDS-7% polyacrylamide gel. Before loading, samples were heated for 15 min at 100 °C. After the run, the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue. The molecular weight markers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were phosphorylase b (94,000), bovine serum albumin (67,000), ovalbumine (43,000), and carbonic anhydrase (30,000). (Protein samples are stable in these conditions for several months.) The enrichment of activity was calculated to be about 14-fold; 2 liters of culture yielded about 12 mg of pure protein. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (24.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar), with bovine serum albumin as standard. Enzymatic assays were performed on di-, oligo-, and polysaccharides 2The structures of the disaccharides used are: cellobiose, β-d-glucopyranosyl-(1,4)-d-glucopyranose; isomaltose, α-d-glucopyranosyl-(1,6)-d-glucopyranose; isoprimeverose, α-d-xylopyranosyl-(1,6)-d-glucopyranose; maltose, α-d-glucopyranosyl-(1,4)-d-glucopyranose; sucrose, α-d-glucopyranosyl-(1,2)-d-fructofuranose; trehalose, α-d-glucopyranosyl- (1,1)-d-glucopyranose. at the temperatures indicated in sodium acetate or phosphate buffers (50 mm, pH 5.5; measured at room temperature) by incubating the concentrations indicated of substrate and 5–10 μg of XylS in the final volume of 1.0 ml. The enzymatic reaction was linear for up to 30 min, and initial rates of hydrolysis were taken by stopping the reaction in dry ice after 15 min. The amount of glucose produced in the reaction was determined using a glucose oxidase-peroxidase system (GLU kit from Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Enzyme activity is given in micromoles of glycosyl bonds hydrolyzed per minute. The reaction products of malto- and xyloglucan oligosaccharides hydrolysis were analyzed by TLC. Unless otherwise indicated, assays with 4-nitrophenyl-glycosides were performed at 65 °C in sodium acetate buffer (50 mm, pH 5.5), 10 mm substrates, and 5–10 μg of XylS. In these conditions the enzymatic reaction was linear for up to 30 min, and the initial rate of hydrolysis was taken by stopping the reaction with 0.8 ml of 1 m sodium carbonate. The amount of 4-nitrophenol released was measured by absorption at 405 nm in a 1-cm cuvette, considering a molar extinction coefficient of 18,300m−1 cm−1. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the hydrolysis of 1 μmol of substrate in 1 min at the conditions described. Assay on 4Np-isoprimeveroside was performed by incubating the substrate (5 mm) in sodium phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 5.5), in the presence of 2 μg of XylS and 1.2 μg of LacS (molar ratio 1:1). The determination of 4-nitrophenol released and the definition of enzyme units were as described above. Similar results were obtained at XylS/LacS ratios up to 1:6, indicating that the amount used of LacS was not rate-limiting. Spontaneous hydrolysis of both chromogenic and nonchromogenic substrates resulted in about 1% of the absorbance obtained from the sample containing the enzymes and was subtracted by using blank mixtures without XylS and/or LacS. Kinetic constants of XylS were measured at the optimal conditions of the different assays at 65 °C, by using substrate concentrations in the range 0.2–100 mm, 2.0–300 mm, and 0.2–7 mm for 4Np-glycosides/isoprimeverose, saccharides, and 4Np-β-isoprimeveroside, respectively. All kinetic data were calculated as the average of at least two experiments and were plotted and refined with the program GraFit (25.Leatherbarrow R.J. GraFit version 3.0. Erithacus Software Ltd., Staines, UK1992Google Scholar). Dependence on temperature was determined by assaying aliquots of homogeneous enzyme (4 μg in the temperature range tested) on 100 mm maltose. Thermal stability was tested by incubating pure XylS (0.01 mg ml−1) in sodium acetate buffer (50 mm, pH 5.5) at the indicated temperatures. At intervals, aliquots were withdrawn from the mixture and assayed at 65 °C following maltose (100 mm final concentration) hydrolysis. Molecular mass of denatured XylS was determined on SDS-PAGE 7% in both reducing and non-reducing conditions, using the standards described above. Molecular mass of native XylS was determined by gel filtration on a Sephadex column 26/60 HiLoad (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Standard molecular weight markers were tyroglobulin (669,000), apoferritin (443,000), β-amylase (200,000), and bovine serum albumin (66,000). S. solfataricus cells were grown at midexponential phase (0.6 A 600) in about 20 h from yeast extract plus sucrose medium. Cells were collected by centrifugation and lysated by three cycles of freeze thawing (2 min at −70 °C; 2 min at 30 °C) in TE buffer, and total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Germany). Contaminating DNA was eliminated by digestion with DNase I RNase free (Promega). Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR was performed on 1 μg of total cellular RNA by using the Titan One Tube RT-PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Germany). Electrophoresis and Northern (RNA) blotting were performed as described (26.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides for RT-PCR were prepared to produce amplicons of 670 nucleotides (nt) (positions 1499–2169 from the first ATG), 1280 nt (positions 1–1280), and 921 nt (positions 172–1093) forxylS, lacS, and orf3, respectively. To test the presence of a transcript transversing orf3 and xylS genes, oligonucleotides producing an amplicon of 1081 nt (position 1499 inxylS to position 382 in orf3) were used. The same amplicons were used as DNA probes for Northern blot analysis for lacSand xylS, whereas for orf3 a 397-nt fragment (positions 1139–1536) was used. The probes were labeled by the PCR DIG Probe synthesis kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). In this case, PCR was performed by using as templates plasmid vectors containing the genes indicated. A PCR fragment (positions 1–192 from the ATG) containing the gene encoding for the ubiquitous abundant small basic protein Sso7d (27.Guagliardi A. Napoli A. Rossi M. Ciaramella M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 841-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) was used as a probe for quantitative comparisons. During the sequencing of the S. solfataricusgenome (16.Sensen C.W. Charlebois R.L. Chow C. Clausen I.G. Curtis B. Doolittle W.F. Duguet M. Erauso G. Gaasterland T. Garrett R.A. Gordon P. Heikamp-De Jong I. Jeffries A. Kozera C. Medina N. De Moors A. Van der Oost J. Phan H. Ragan M.A. Schenk M.E. She Q. Singh R.K. Tolstrup N. Extremophiles. 1998; 2: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), strain P2, we identified an open reading frame, which we named xylS, potentially coding for a putative α-glycosidase. The derived amino acid sequence predicted a polypeptide of 731 residues with a calculated molecular mass of 84,432 Da. All non-redundant data bases were screened for entries showing similarity to this ORF with the BLASTP program (28.Altschul S.F. Thomas L.M. Alejandro A.S. Jinghui Z. Zheng Z. Webb M. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59933) Google Scholar). The predicted gene product deduced from the 2193-bp DNA sequence exhibits high similarity to several α-glycosidases, indicating that the protein belongs to family 31 of the glycosyl hydrolases (29.Henrissat B. Bairoch A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 695-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). This family is described as a group of enzymes specific for the hydrolysis of α-bonded sugars, including α-glucosidases (EC 3.2.1.20), α-galactosidases (EC3.2.1.22); glucoamylases (EC 3.2.1.3), sucrase-isomaltases (EC 3.2.1.48and 3.2.1.10); and α-xylosidases (EC 3.2.1.-). These enzymes are classified as retaining, because they cleave the glycosidic bond via a two-step reaction mechanism with net retention of the anomeric configuration. No three-dimensional structures of members from this family are currently available. The new ORF revealed low identity with enzymes from all the three living domains. In particular, the C terminus of XylS (roughly from positions 100 to 700), corresponding to a conserved domain in the ProDom data base (accession number PD001543), produced 35%, 30%, 29%, and 27% identity with the hypothetical protein of Erwinia herbicola (Erwglu), the α-glucosidase from S. solfataricus (MalA), the α-xylosidases from L. pentosus (XylQ), and Thermotoga maritima (Tmxyl), respectively. The Erwglu and Tmxyl enzymes have not been characterized biochemically, whereas MalA has been studied in detail and appears to be a typical α-glucosidase specific for maltose and malto-oligosaccharides (17.Rolfsmeier M. Blum P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 482-485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). XylQ is an α-xylosidase with high specificity for isoprimeverose (α-d-xylopyranosyl-1,6-d-glucopyranose); thexylQ gene is clustered with xylP, encoding an hypothetical membrane protein transporter, in an operon that is involved in the metabolism of this disaccharide (9.Chaillou S. Lokman B.C. Leer R.J. Posthuma C. Postma P.W. Pouwels P.H. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2312-2320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The similarity between XylQ and XylS proteins led us to examine the flanking regions of xylS to find putative membrane protein transporters and to test the substrate specificity of the hypothetical enzyme (see below). Surprisingly, the analysis of a 15-kilobase (kb) sequenced region, which comprises xylS, revealed that it mapped in the locus of the lacS gene encoding for the β-glycosidase that has been extensively studied in our laboratory (19.Pisani F.M. Rella R. Raia C.A. Rozzo C. Nucci R. Gambacorta A. De Rosa M. Rossi M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 21.Cubellis M.V. Rozzo C. Montecucchi P.

Biol. 1997; 271: 789-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). As reported previously, lacS is preceded, in the same orientation, by a gene encoding a putative membrane protein homologous to the Major Facilitator Superfamily (mfs) (30.Prisco A. Moracci M. Rossi M. Ciaramella M. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 177: 1614-1619Crossref Google Scholar) and followed, in the opposite orientation, by a 1785-bp open reading frame (orf3) encoding a 592-amino acid polypeptide of unknown function. xylS maps immediately upstream to orf3 (Fig. 1), and the two genes are transcribed in the same direction. In thexylS promoter region, a consensus archaeal TATA box is present, separated 25 nt from a putative translation start site. A typical terminator T-rich sequence is located 3 nt from thexylS stop codon. In orf3, potential promoter sequences can be assigned less easily: two A/T-rich sequences are located within 50 nt of the first ATG, one of which corresponds to the putative termination sequence of xylS. No polyT stretches could be found downstream of the gene. Interestingly, xylS andlacS promoter regions show, upstream to the TATA box, the consensus for the TFB-responsive element (BRE), which is involved in the orientation of the transcription preinitiation complex in Archaea (31.Bell S.D. Kosa P.L. Sigler P.B. Jackson S.P. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13662-13667Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Moreover, the two promoters exhibit high similarity in the region comprising BRE and TATA elements and five nucleotides downstream, with 15 of 17 nt being identical (Fig. 1). The Protein Data Bank searched by the BLASTP program generated two entries exhibiting significant identity with orf3: one matched perfectly with entry P22795, a region of this ORF identified in our laboratory during the cloning of lacS from S. solfataricus, strain MT4 (21.Cubellis M.V.

https://openalex.org/W1977416745,"Dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) reductase of Escherichia coli is a terminal electron transport chain enzyme that is expressed under anaerobic growth conditions and is required for anaerobic growth with Me2SO as the terminal electron acceptor. The trimeric enzyme is composed of a membrane extrinsic catalytic dimer (DmsAB) and a membrane intrinsic anchor (DmsC). The amino terminus of DmsA has a leader sequence with a twin arginine motif that targets DmsAB to the membrane via a novel Sec-independent mechanism termed MTT for membrane targeting and translocation. We demonstrate that the Met-1 present upstream of the twin arginine motif serves as the correct translational start site. The leader is essential for the expression of DmsA, stability of the DmsAB dimer, and membrane targeting of the reductase holoenzyme. Mutation of arginine 17 to aspartate abolished membrane targeting. The reductase was labile in the leader sequence mutants. These mutants failed to support growth on glycerol-Me2SO minimal medium. Replacing the DmsA leader with the TorA leader of trimethylamineN-oxide reductase produced a membrane-bound DmsABC with greatly reduced enzyme activity and inefficient anaerobic respiration indicating that the twin arginine leaders may play specific roles in the assembly of redox enzymes.

Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 7.Fekkes P. Driessen A.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 161-173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the role of this signal sequence in protein export was originally proposed for the periplasmic hydrogenase ofDesulfovibrio vulgaris (8.Dongen W.V. Hagen W. Berg W.V.D. Veeger C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1988; 50: 5-9Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar), understanding of this unique leader had to await the discovery of the MTT genes.One of the twin Arg leader proteins identified in a data base search was the catalytic subunit of Me2SO reductase (6.Berks B.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). This enzyme is a heterotrimer, composed of a molybdenum molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide containing a catalytic subunit (DmsA, 85.8 kDa), an iron-sulfur subunit (DmsB, 23.1 kDa), and a membrane intrinsic subunit (DmsC, 30.8 kDa) (9.Bilous P.T. Cole S.T. Anderson W.F. Weiner J.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1988; 2: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 10.Bilous P.T. Weiner J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1511-1518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The DmsA and -B subunits function as a catalytic dimer, whereas DmsC is the membrane anchor subunit and binds menaquinone (11.Sambasivarao D. Weiner J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5935-5943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was argued by Berks (6.Berks B.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar) that DmsA together with DmsB could be targeted for export via the MTT export pathway. However, extensive biochemical, immunological, electron microscopic, and electron paramagnetic resonance studies have been carried out on the topological organization of the Me2SO reductase (12.Sambasivarao D. Scraba D.G. Trieber C. Weiner J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5938-5948Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,13.Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5855-5861Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The two membrane extrinsic subunits, DmsA and -B were shown to face the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, contrary to the periplasmic localization of most other twin Arg leader-containing proteins.The twin Arg motif of DmsA was not recognized in the initial cloning and sequencing of the dms operon (9.Bilous P.T. Cole S.T. Anderson W.F. Weiner J.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1988; 2: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). N-terminal analysis of the purified DmsA subunit revealed that the mature, purified protein began with the sequence Val-Asp-Ser … (see Fig. 1) and that the first upstream Met (16 residues upstream, M30 in Fig. 1) was proposed as the initiating Met (9.Bilous P.T. Cole S.T. Anderson W.F. Weiner J.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1988; 2: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). However, it now appears that DmsA may actually initiate at a Met, 46 residues upstream of the Val-46 (Fig.1). This 45-amino acid leader encodes a twin Arg motif and has Ala-His-Ala immediately upstream of the cleavage site, in accord with other proteins containing this type of leader (6.Berks B.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 14.Niviere V. Wong S.L. Voordouw G. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 2173-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).The electron transfer properties of the Me2SO reductase inEscherichia coli are well documented (15.Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8296-8305Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 16.Weiner J.H. Rothery R.A. Sambasivarao D. Trieber C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1102: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, very little is known about the role of the leader peptide. In the present study, we confirm that DmsA does indeed initiate at the more upstream Met (which we have now designated as M1, Fig. 1) We also examined the influence of the DmsA leader sequence on the assembly and stability of the enzyme, together with the membrane-targeting functions.DISCUSSIONThe MTT system plays an essential role in the translocation of severalfolded, cofactor-containing, redox proteins to the periplasm (1.Weiner J.H.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3640-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). These proteins have long amino-terminal leader sequences with a twin Arg motif and are usually soluble or bound to the periplasmic side of the membrane. The DmsABC and FdoGHI enzymes are membrane-bound, multisubunit proteins, and the DmsA and FdoG subunits have similar twin Arg signal peptides. However, a great deal of experimental evidence has shown that DmsAB and FdoGH subunits face the cytoplasmic side of the membrane and are not translocated across the membrane (12.Sambasivarao D. Scraba D.G. Trieber C. Weiner J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5938-5948Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Benoit S. Abaibou H. Mandrand-Berthelot M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6625-6634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have proposed that the MTT system is needed to associate the DmsAB subunits with the membrane anchor subunit, DmsC (1.Weiner J.H.

J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5935-5943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In this study we provide experimental evidence for the presence of a 45-residue twin Arg leader on the DmsA subunit. We also show that the leader is essential for the stability and function of the holoenzyme. This contrasts with the periplasmic TMAO and Me2SO reductases from E. coli and Rhodobacter sphaeroides (2.Santini C.L. Ize B. Chanal A. Muller M. Giordano G. Wu L.F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 29.Hilton J.C. Temple C.A. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8428-8436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In these enzymes, deletion of the twin Arg leader resulted in cytoplasmic localization of the enzyme, consistent with the predicted role of the leader peptide (2.Santini C.L. Ize B. Chanal A. Muller M. Giordano G. Wu L.F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 3.Sargent F. Bogsch E.G. Stanley N.R. Wexler M. Robinson C. Berks B.C. Palmer T.

Chem. 1999; 274: 8428-8436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar); however, the leaderless enzymes were stable and incorporated the molybdopterin cofactor.The DmsA leader has two methionine residues, Met-1 and Met-30 (Fig. 1). Met-30 was found to be a poor initiation site and led to minimal synthesis of the reductase (Fig. 2). This Met is not conserved in DmsA homologues (6.Berks B.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). The confirmation of a 45-residue leader necessitates renumbering of amino acid residues in DmsA. Previous publications have assumed that DmsA initiated at Met-30, based on the original sequence study (9.Bilous P.T. Cole S.T. Anderson W.F. Weiner J.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1988; 2: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and the first residue of the mature protein, Val46, was previously numbered Val-16.Mutagenesis studies of the conserved Arg, within the twin Arg motif, were performed on the [Ni-Fe] hydrogenase from D. vulgaris, the nitrous oxide reductase from the Pseudomonas stutzeri, and the glucose-fructose oxidoreductase fromZymomonas (14.Niviere V. Wong S.L. Voordouw G. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 2173-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 26.Halbig D. Hou B. Freudl R. Sprenger G.A. Klosgen R.B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 30.Dreusch A. Burgisser D.M. Heizmann C.W. Zumft W.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In all cases the mutant enzymes were not translocated to the periplasm but were stable. The R17D mutant of Me2SO reductase was highly unstable, was not targeted to the membrane, and did not support anaerobic growth (Table I and Fig.3). These studies suggest that the twin Arg leader could have two distinct functions: targeting and stability. The twin Arg motif in DmsA differs from the consensus twin Arg leaders by having a Leu in place of a Phe in the fourth position, however, it is unlikely that the targeting versus translocation role is related to this variation. When we replaced the DmsA leader with the TorA leader, which has a Phe in place of Leu, DmsA was still targeted to the membrane. The TorA leader-DmsA construct appeared to be far less stable than the DmsA leader-DmsA construct, suggesting that there are unique interactions between the leader and mature protein.The twin Arg leader is cleaved by a peptidase (leader peptidase I?), and we have examined the processing of DmsA by mutating the conserved amino acids adjacent to the putative cleavage site. Nearly all of the twin arginine leaders have a conserved AXA motif amino-terminal to the cleavage site, and cleavage at this site was confirmed for a number of enzymes (6.Berks B.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 14.Niviere V. Wong S.L. Voordouw G. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 2173-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The DmsA leader also has the AXA motif (Fig. 1), and the N-terminal analysis of the purified DmsA polypeptide showed cleavage at this site (9.Bilous P.T. Cole S.T. Anderson W.F. Weiner J.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1988; 2: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Both the cleavage site mutants (pDMSA43N and pDMSA43N:A45N) exhibited enzyme activity, were processed to the M-form, supported anaerobic growth on G-D medium, and had the expected membrane localization of activity. These mutations were chosen based on algorithms of von Heijne (31.Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Int. J. Neural. Syst. 1997; 8: 581-599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which suggested that Asn residues were least preferred by leader peptidase I. Data in Fig. 4 A show that the DmsA43N:A45N protein migrates as mature DmsA, suggesting that cleavage is catalyzed by a protease that is not inhibited by Asn or a nearby alternate cleavage site is being utilized. These results lead to a conundrum. If DmsA is not translocated to the periplasm, when and where is it cleaved? Although in earlier papers we suggested that cleavage may be an artifact of cell lysis and protein purification (9.Bilous P.T. Cole S.T. Anderson W.F. Weiner J.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1988; 2: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 10.Bilous P.T. Weiner J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1511-1518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it now appears that cleavage is an essential step to maturation of functional the enzyme. 2D. Sambasivarao, H. A. Dawson, J. Hu, and J. H. Weiner, manuscript in preparation. The twin Arg leader is able to export both homologous and heterologous proteins. Reporter proteins such as dihydrofolate reductase, β-lactamase, alkaline phosphatase, and the 23-kDa protein of the plant photosystem II oxygen-evolving complex were exported and processed to the mature forms when expressed with a TorA signal peptide (3.Sargent F.

Chem. 1999; 274: 13223-13228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). We have replaced the DmsA leader with the TorA leader (pDMS191) and investigated the membrane assembly and function of the TorA-Me2SO reductase holoenzyme (Table II, Figs. 3 and 4). Although the TorA leader behaved similarly to the DmsA leader in its ability to target the holoenzyme to the membrane, nearly a 5-fold decrease in specific activity was noted for the mutant enzyme, compared with the wild-type enzyme. The mutant enzyme did not support efficient anaerobic growth on glycerol-Me2SO minimal medium. The incompatibility of the TorA leader supports our contention that the DmsA leader has important stabilizing properties during maturation of the DmsABC holoenzyme. Interestingly, when the TorA leader was fused to the soluble Me2SO reductase from R. sphaeroides, the enzyme also failed to show optimal enzyme activities, implying that the leader has a role in the overall folding and function of the enzyme complex (29.Hilton J.C. Temple C.A. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8428-8436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These studies show that twin Arg leaders may play specific roles in the assembly of redox enzymes and may not be interchangeable. Recently, we and others have reported the discovery of a novel system, which targets and translocates folded, cofactor-containing proteins to and across the cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria (1.Weiner J.H.

Berks B.C. Robinson C. Palmer T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18003-18006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). This system, named MTT (for membrane targeting and translocation) or TAT (for twin arginine translocation),1 recognizes an amino-terminal leader sequence that is distinct from the one recognized by the well-characterized Sec system (1.Weiner J.H.

Science. 1997; 278: 1467-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The MTT leader sequence is typically 30–60 amino acids long, contains a conserved twin arginine motif, (S/T)RRXF(X/L)K, and has been found to be associated with a large number of periplasmic redox proteins (6.Berks B.C.

N-terminal analysis of the purified DmsA subunit revealed that the mature, purified protein began with the sequence Val-Asp-Ser … (see Fig. 1) and that the first upstream Met (16 residues upstream, M30 in Fig. 1) was proposed as the initiating Met (9.Bilous P.T. Cole S.T. Anderson W.F. Weiner J.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1988; 2: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). However, it now appears that DmsA may actually initiate at a Met, 46 residues upstream of the Val-46 (Fig.1). This 45-amino acid leader encodes a twin Arg motif and has Ala-His-Ala immediately upstream of the cleavage site, in accord with other proteins containing this type of leader (6.Berks B.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 14.Niviere V. Wong S.L. Voordouw G. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 2173-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The electron transfer properties of the Me2SO reductase inEscherichia coli are well documented (15.Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H.

In the present study, we confirm that DmsA does indeed initiate at the more upstream Met (which we have now designated as M1, Fig. 1) We also examined the influence of the DmsA leader sequence on the assembly and stability of the enzyme, together with the membrane-targeting functions. DISCUSSIONThe MTT system plays an essential role in the translocation of severalfolded, cofactor-containing, redox proteins to the periplasm (1.Weiner J.H. Bilous P.T. Shaw G.M. Lubitz S.P. Frost L.

The R17D mutant of Me2SO reductase was highly unstable, was not targeted to the membrane, and did not support anaerobic growth (Table I and Fig.3). These studies suggest that the twin Arg leader could have two distinct functions: targeting and stability. The twin Arg motif in DmsA differs from the consensus twin Arg leaders by having a Leu in place of a Phe in the fourth position, however, it is unlikely that the targeting versus translocation role is related to this variation. When we replaced the DmsA leader with the TorA leader, which has a Phe in place of Leu, DmsA was still targeted to the membrane. The TorA leader-DmsA construct appeared to be far less stable than the DmsA leader-DmsA construct, suggesting that there are unique interactions between the leader and mature protein.The twin Arg leader is cleaved by a peptidase (leader peptidase I?), and we have examined the processing of DmsA by mutating the conserved amino acids adjacent to the putative cleavage site. Nearly all of the twin arginine leaders have a conserved AXA motif amino-terminal to the cleavage site, and cleavage at this site was confirmed for a number of enzymes (6.Berks B.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 14.Niviere V. Wong S.L. Voordouw G. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 2173-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The DmsA leader also has the AXA motif (Fig. 1), and the N-terminal analysis of the purified DmsA polypeptide showed cleavage at this site (9.Bilous P.T. Cole S.T. Anderson W.F. Weiner J.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1988; 2: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Both the cleavage site mutants (pDMSA43N and pDMSA43N:A45N) exhibited enzyme activity, were processed to the M-form, supported anaerobic growth on G-D medium, and had the expected membrane localization of activity. These mutations were chosen based on algorithms of von Heijne (31.Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Int. J. Neural. Syst. 1997; 8: 581-599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which suggested that Asn residues were least preferred by leader peptidase I. Data in Fig. 4 A show that the DmsA43N:A45N protein migrates as mature DmsA, suggesting that cleavage is catalyzed by a protease that is not inhibited by Asn or a nearby alternate cleavage site is being utilized. These results lead to a conundrum. If DmsA is not translocated to the periplasm, when and where is it cleaved? Although in earlier papers we suggested that cleavage may be an artifact of cell lysis and protein purification (9.Bilous P.T. Cole S.T. Anderson W.F. Weiner J.H. Mol.

H. Weiner, manuscript in preparation. The twin Arg leader is able to export both homologous and heterologous proteins. Reporter proteins such as dihydrofolate reductase, β-lactamase, alkaline phosphatase, and the 23-kDa protein of the plant photosystem II oxygen-evolving complex were exported and processed to the mature forms when expressed with a TorA signal peptide (3.Sargent F.

We have replaced the DmsA leader with the TorA leader (pDMS191) and investigated the membrane assembly and function of the TorA-Me2SO reductase holoenzyme (Table II, Figs. 3 and 4). Although the TorA leader behaved similarly to the DmsA leader in its ability to target the holoenzyme to the membrane, nearly a 5-fold decrease in specific activity was noted for the mutant enzyme, compared with the wild-type enzyme. The mutant enzyme did not support efficient anaerobic growth on glycerol-Me2SO minimal medium. The incompatibility of the TorA leader supports our contention that the DmsA leader has important stabilizing properties during maturation of the DmsABC holoenzyme. Interestingly, when the TorA leader was fused to the soluble Me2SO reductase from R. sphaeroides, the enzyme also failed to show optimal enzyme activities, implying that the leader has a role in the overall folding and function of the enzyme complex (29.Hilton J.C. Temple C.A. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8428-8436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These studies show that twin Arg leaders may play specific roles in the assembly of redox enzymes and may not be interchangeable. The MTT system plays an essential role in the translocation of severalfolded, cofactor-containing, redox proteins to the periplasm (1.Weiner J.H. Bilous P.T. Shaw G.M. Lubitz S.P. Frost L.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3640-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). These proteins have long amino-terminal leader sequences with a twin Arg motif and are usually soluble or bound to the periplasmic side of the membrane. The DmsABC and FdoGHI enzymes are membrane-bound, multisubunit proteins, and the DmsA and FdoG subunits have similar twin Arg signal peptides. However, a great deal of experimental evidence has shown that DmsAB and FdoGH subunits face the cytoplasmic side of the membrane and are not translocated across the membrane (12.Sambasivarao D. Scraba D.G. Trieber C. Weiner J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5938-5948Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Benoit S. Abaibou H. Mandrand-Berthelot M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6625-6634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have proposed that the MTT system is needed to associate the DmsAB subunits with the membrane anchor subunit, DmsC (1.Weiner J.H.

J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5935-5943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we provide experimental evidence for the presence of a 45-residue twin Arg leader on the DmsA subunit. We also show that the leader is essential for the stability and function of the holoenzyme. This contrasts with the periplasmic TMAO and Me2SO reductases from E. coli and Rhodobacter sphaeroides (2.Santini C.L. Ize B. Chanal A. Muller M. Giordano G. Wu L.F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 29.Hilton J.C. Temple C.A. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8428-8436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In these enzymes, deletion of the twin Arg leader resulted in cytoplasmic localization of the enzyme, consistent with the predicted role of the leader peptide (2.Santini C.L. Ize B. Chanal A. Muller M. Giordano G. Wu L.F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 3.Sargent F. Bogsch E.G. Stanley N.R. Wexler M. Robinson C. Berks B.C. Palmer T.

The DmsA leader has two methionine residues, Met-1 and Met-30 (Fig. 1). Met-30 was found to be a poor initiation site and led to minimal synthesis of the reductase (Fig. 2). This Met is not conserved in DmsA homologues (6.Berks B.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). The confirmation of a 45-residue leader necessitates renumbering of amino acid residues in DmsA. Previous publications have assumed that DmsA initiated at Met-30, based on the original sequence study (9.Bilous P.T. Cole S.T. Anderson W.F. Weiner J.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1988; 2: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and the first residue of the mature protein, Val46, was previously numbered Val-16. Mutagenesis studies of the conserved Arg, within the twin Arg motif, were performed on the [Ni-Fe] hydrogenase from D. vulgaris, the nitrous oxide reductase from the Pseudomonas stutzeri, and the glucose-fructose oxidoreductase fromZymomonas (14.Niviere V.

B., Finley, N., Gasmi-Seabrook, G., Solaro, R.J., Rance, M., and Rosevear, P.R. (1999) J. Biol. Chem.274, 16681–16684). Here we show a large decrease in cardiac troponin C linker flexibility, corresponding to residues 85–93, when bound to intact cardiac troponin I. The addition of 2 m urea to the intact cardiac troponin I-troponin C complex significantly increased linker flexibility. Conformational changes in the regulatory domain of cardiac troponin C were monitored in complexes with troponin I-(1–211), troponin I-(33–211), troponin I-(1–80) and bisphosphorylated troponin I-(1–80). The cardiac specific N terminus, residues 1–32, and the C-domain, residues 81–211, of troponin I are both capable of inducing conformational changes in the troponin C regulatory domain. Phosphorylation of the cardiac specific N terminus reversed its effects on the regulatory domain. These studies provide the first evidence that the cardiac specific N terminus can modulate the function of troponin C by altering the conformational equilibrium of the regulatory domain. Previously, we utilized 15N transverse relaxation rates to demonstrate significant mobility in the linker region and conformational exchange in the regulatory domain of Ca2+-saturated cardiac troponin C bound to the isolated N-domain of cardiac troponin I (Gaponenko, V., Abusamhadneh, E., Abbott, M.

The troponin complex is associated with tropomyosin and consists of troponin (Tn)1 I, the inhibitory subunit, troponin C (TnC), the Ca2+-binding subunit, and troponin T (TnT), which makes primary protein-protein contacts with tropomyosin. TnC is required to confer Ca2+ sensitivity on the actin-myosin interaction. The cardiac isoforms of TnC and TnI differ structurally and functionally from fast skeletal isoforms. Calcium binding to the regulatory domain of skeletal TnC results in movement of the B and C helices away from the N, A, and D helices producing a conformational “opening.” The newly exposed hydrophobic pocket allows additional interactions with TnI (1.Herzberg O.

Qualitatively, although both sets of data are consistent with an extended sTnC structure, the mass distribution for TnI in thein situ complex differs significantly from that found in the TnIC complex in the presence of 2–3 m urea (15.Olah G.A. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12800-12806Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 16.Olah G.A. Rokop S.E. Wang C.L. Blechner S.L. Trewhella J.

Biol. 1998; 281: 689-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Discrepancies between the two models could result from either the presence of 2–3 m urea or the additional TnT subunit. High resolution solution NMR studies of TnC and TnI interactions have largely utilized isolated domains and synthetic peptides due to the large molecular mass (approximately 42 kDa) and limited solubility of the intact cTnIC complex. Findings from these studies, by their nature, fail to reveal structural mechanisms that rely on interdomain interactions and must be verified in more sophisticated model systems. Low resolution structural techniques such as fluorescence and neutron scattering have provided important information on the intact complex. However, they do not contain sufficient detail to verify the findings of the high resolution single-domain experiments or completely elucidate the structural mechanisms of cTnC regulation and cTnI inhibitory function. In an effort to correlate functional regions of cTnI with structural mechanisms in the cTnIC system and bridge the gap between available high resolution structures of isolated domains and the low resolution data of the intact complex, a series of cTnC·cTnI complexes were created for multidimensional heteronuclear NMR analysis. Strategic deletion of functionally significant regions cTnI was utilized to investigate the structural interactions that underlie the switch mechanism within the cTnIC complex. The dynamics of cTnC in the intact cTnIC complex were monitored by 15N transverse relaxation rates and chemical shift mapping. Chemical shift data for cTnC bound to cTnI-(1–80), cTnI-(1–80)pp, cTnI-(1–80)DD, cTnI-(33–211), and cTnI-(1–211) were compared and used to monitor conformational equilibrium in the cTnC regulatory domain. Surprisingly, binding of both the cardiac specific N terminus and the C-domain of cTnI altered the cTnC regulatory domain conformation. The absence of the cardiac specific N terminus (cTnI-(33–211)), mutation of Ser23 and Ser24 to Asp (cTnI-(1–80)DD) or phosphorylation at Ser residues 23 and 24 (cTnI-(1–80)pp), shifts the conformational equilibrium toward that observed in free Ca2+-saturated cTnC. This provides the first evidence that the cardiac specific N terminus modulates the function of cTnC by altering the conformational equilibria within the regulatory domain. These results also demonstrate that a simple model based on Ca2+-dependent binding of cTnI residues 147–163 to the regulatory domain of cTnC is insufficient to account for the molecular details of cardiac troponin I-troponin C interactions. [15N,2H]cTnC, cTnI-(1–80), cTnI-(1–80)DD, cTnI-(33–211), and cTnI-(1–211) were purified and complex formation carried out as described previously (7.Gaponenko V. Abusamhadneh E. Abbott M.B. Finley N.

For NMR experiments, [15N,2H]cTnC·cTnI-(1–80), [15N,2H]cTnC·cTnI-(1–80)DD, and [15N]cTnC·cTnI-(1–80)pp complexes were prepared at 1.0 mm concentration in 10% 2H2O, 20 mm Tris-d 11 buffer (pH = 6.8), 150 mm potassium chloride, 10 mm Ca2+, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm leupeptin, and 0.4 mm Pefabloc (7.Gaponenko V.

The [15N,2H]cTnC·cTnI-(1–211) and [15N,2H]cTnC·cTnI-(33–211) complexes were prepared at 0.5 mm concentration (due to the limited solubility of these complexes) in 10% 2H2O, 20 mm Tris-d 11 buffer (pH = 6.8), 200 mm potassium chloride, 10 mmCa2+, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and the protease inhibitor mixture Complete EDTA-free (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), or in the identical buffer containing 2 m urea. No evidence of dimerization of cTnC or the various complexes was observed by light scattering or native gel analysis. Protein concentrations for cTnC were determined by UV and Bradford analysis. Cardiac TnI concentrations were determined by BCA assay (Pierce). Amino acid analysis was used to calibrate the colorimetric methods. All experiments were carried out on Varian 600 or 800 MHz spectrometers. 1H-15N correlation experiments utilized pulse sequences based on either sensitivity-enhanced 1H-15N HSQC (19.Kay L.E. Keifer P. Saarinen T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 10663-10665Crossref Scopus (2437) Google Scholar) or1H-15N TROSY (20.Pervushin K. Riek R. Wider G. Wuthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Three-dimensional NOESY-HSQC experiments using an 85-ms mixing time were generally used to confirm amide resonance assignments (22.Zhang O. Kay L.E. Olivier J.P. Forman-Kay J.D. J. Biomol.

The TROSY-detected 15N R 2 data were recorded using a conventional pulse sequence for 15NR 2 measurements (23.Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E.

Spectra were collected with Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill relaxation periods of 0, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, and 64 ms. Double points were collected with relaxation periods of 8, 16, 32, and 40 ms for error analysis. Data processing has been described previously(7). Calcium binding to cTnC was measured as described previously (24.Wattanapermpool J. Reiser P.J. Solaro R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C323-C330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding measurements were made with the aid of the fluorescent probe, 2-(4′-iodoacetamidoanilino)-naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid (IAANS), which reports Ca2+ binding to the regulatory site. Cardiac troponin C (1.5 mg/ml) was labeled in 10 mm MOPS, 90 mm KCl, 2.6 mm CaCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 6 m urea, pH 7.0 and a 5-fold molar excess of IAANS, prepared fresh as a stock solution in Me2SO. Labeling proceeded for 8–10 h at room temperature with constant shaking. The solution was then dialyzed against two changes of 4 liters of 10 mm MOPS, 90 mm KCl at pH 7.0. The molar ratio of the incorporated probe to cTnC was approximately 1.5. Labeled cTnC (cTnCIA) was complexed with cTnI as described previously (24.Wattanapermpool J. Reiser P.J. Solaro R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C323-C330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence measurements were carried out in a Perkin-Elmer SS-5B luminescence spectrometer using an excitation wavelength of 330 nm. The peak emission wavelength (445–455 nm) was determined prior to Ca2+ titrations. Ca2+ titrations were carried out with and without 2m urea in 3 ml of a solution containing 1 μmof the cTnI·cTnCIA complex, 20 mm MOPS, 90 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0, 1 mm EGTA. A range of free Ca2+ concentrations was achieved by sequential addition of CaCl2 as calculated using binding constants reported by Godt and Lindley (25.Godt R.E. Lindley B.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1982; 80: 279-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Changes in fluorescence intensities were normalized to the maximum change, and the data fitted to the Hill equation as described previously (24.Wattanapermpool J. Reiser P.J. Solaro R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C323-C330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown that the N-domain of cTnI containing the cardiac specific N terminus, cTnI-(1–80), interacts with both domains of cTnC and decreases chemical exchange in the regulatory domain (7.Gaponenko V. Abusamhadneh E. Abbott M.B. Finley N. Gasmi-Seabrook G. Solaro R.J. Rance M. Rosevear P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16681-16684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Binding of cTnI-(1–80), however, does not significantly affect flexibility in the D/E linker region. To further elucidate dynamic relationships within the cTnIC complex, we examined the binding of cTnI-(1–80), cTnI-(1–80)pp, cTnI-(1–80)DD, cTnI-(33–211), and cTnI-(1–211) to [15N,2H]cTnC. Chemical shifts for the amide resonances of cTnC bound to cTnI-(1–80), cTnI-(1–80)DD, and cTnI-(1–80)pp have been assigned previously (18.Finley N. Abbott M.B. Abusamhadneh E. Gaponenko V. Dong W.

Assignments for amide resonances of [15N,2H]cTnC bound to either cTnI-(1–211) or cTnI-(33–211) were made by comparison of1H-15N TROSY spectra with1H-15N HSQC spectra of [15N,2H]cTnC·cTnI-(1–80) (7.Gaponenko V. Abusamhadneh E. Abbott M.B. Finley N. Gasmi-Seabrook G. Solaro R.J. Rance M. Rosevear P.R. J. Biol.

When necessary, assignments for cTnC·cTnI-(1–211) and cTnC·cTnI-(33–211) were confirmed using HN to HN and HN to Hα sequential NOEs obtained from three-dimensional NOESY-HSQC spectra. The 800-MHz1H-15N TROSY spectrum for [15N,2H]cTnC bound to cTnI-(1–211) with cross-peaks assigned is shown in Fig. 1. Multiple conformations were observed for Ala31, Glu32, Gly34, Gly42, Glu66, Gly68, Val72, Asp73, and Val79 in the1H-15N TROSY spectra of the 42-kDa cTnC·cTnI-(1–211) complex. For these residues, the most intense cross-peak representing the predominant conformation of cTnC was utilized for chemical shift comparison and to obtain rate information (Fig. 2). A number of resonances throughout the regulatory domain were broadened beyond detection or shifted upon binding either cTnI-(1–80) or cTnI-(33–211). Interestingly, cross-peaks for Ala31, Asp33, and Gly34 in inactive calcium binding site I, cross-peaks for Leu48 and Gly49 in the B/C loop region, and cross-peaks for Glu66, Asp67, and Thr71 in calcium binding site II were significantly perturbed only when cTnC was bound to cTnI-(1–80) or cTnI-(1–211).Figure 2Sequential plots of transverse relaxation rate, R 2 , for Ca2+-saturated [15N,2H] cTnC (A), [15N,2H]cTnC· cTnI -(1–211) (B), and cTnC· cTnI -(1–211) in 2 m urea (C). A, R 2values for [15N,2H]cTnC were taken from Gaponenko et al. (7.Gaponenko V. Abusamhadneh E. Abbott M.B. Finley N. Gasmi-Seabrook G. Solaro R.J. Rance M. Rosevear P.R. J. Biol.

B, resonance assignments in1H-15N correlation spectra of the cTnC·cTnI-(1–211) complex could not be confirmed due to a lack of sequential NOEs in NOESY-HSQC spectra for residues 1, 2, 3, 6, 17, 20, 24, 41, 44, 47, 58, 62, 64, 65, 75, 83, 85, 97, 101, 118, 132, and 136. Residues 16, 22, 27, 33, 35, 48, 50, 56, 57, 59, 60, 80, 86, 100, 109, 115, 120, 121, 123, 126, 131, 151, 154, and 157 were excluded from analysis due to peak overlap in the 1H-15N correlation spectra of both complexes. Cross-peaks for residues 21, 23, 29, 30, 31, 32, 36, 37, 38, 39, 61, 66, 71, 72, 73, 74, 78, 79, 81, 84, 87, 93, 98, 99, 102, and 150 were too broad to obtain accurateR 2 values in the absence of urea. C, cross-peaks for residues 25, 29, 30, 32, 40, 61, 66, 71, 74, 78, 79, 84, 93, 102, and 150 were too broad to obtain R 2values in the presence of urea.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further explore the conformational exchange observed in the regulatory domain of cTnC, 15N transverse relaxation rates were measured in the intact [15N,2H]cTnC·cTnI-(1–211) complex.15N transverse relaxation rates, R 2, depend on the rotational correlation time of the molecule, internal motions, conformational exchange, dipole-dipole interactions, and chemical shift anisotropy. Internal motion and conformational exchange are indicated by 15N R 2 rates lower and higher than the average 15N R 2value for the molecule, respectively. The previously published15N R 2 values for free cTnC are included for comparison (7.Gaponenko V. Abusamhadneh E. Abbott M.B. Finley N. Gasmi-Seabrook G. Solaro R.J. Rance M. Rosevear P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16681-16684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). 15N R 2values for free Ca2+-saturated cTnC demonstrate distinct averages for the N- and C-domains, indicating some independence in the tumbling of the two domains resulting in distinct rotational correlation times (7.Gaponenko V. Abusamhadneh E. Abbott M.B. Finley N. Gasmi-Seabrook G. Solaro R.J. Rance M. Rosevear P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16681-16684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Additionally, lower than average rates are observed in the D/E linker, consistent with rapid internal motions due to flexibility in this region (7.Gaponenko V. Abusamhadneh E. Abbott M.B. Finley N. Gasmi-Seabrook G. Solaro R.J. Rance M. Rosevear P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16681-16684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Higher than average rates within defunct site I were previously shown to result from conformational exchange by comparison of 15N transverse cross-correlation rates and 15N transverse relaxation rates (7.Gaponenko V. Abusamhadneh E. Abbott M.B. Finley N. Gasmi-Seabrook G. Solaro R.J. Rance M. Rosevear P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16681-16684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The average 15N R 2 values for the N- and C- domains of cTnC in the cTnC·cTnI-(1–211) are 34 ± 7 s−1 and 35 ± 7 s−1, respectively, suggesting a uniform rotational correlation time across the molecule (Fig. 2 B). Larger errors for the R 2 values in the cTnC·cTnI-(1–211) complex are a consequence of the large molecular mass (42 kDa) and lower solubility of the intact cTnIC complex. Despite larger errors for the intact complex, trends in rates through the molecule are discernable. Collection of 15N transverse cross-correlation rates was not practical due to the lower protein concentration of the complex, the larger molecular mass (42 kDa) of the complex, and the inherent insensitivity of the experiment. Further, collection of a complete set of relaxation parameters and calculation of order parameters (S 2) would be impractical given the physical limitations of the more biologically relevant systems utilized in this study. Determination ofS 2 values in the absence of detailed tertiary structures is ambiguous due to the uncertainty of the diffusion tensors (26.Bruschweiler R. Liao X. Wright P.E. Science. 1995; 268: 886-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 27.Tjandra N. Feller S.E. Pastor R.W. Bax A. J. Am. Chem.

Significantly, R 2 values for residues 85–93, which comprise the linker region, are nearly as large as those for the N- and C-domains, indicating that full-length cTnI considerably restricts motion of these residues in the intact complex (Fig. 2).15N R 2 values for Asp25, Ile26, and Gly34 in defunct Ca2+binding site I, as well as Val72 and Asp73 in Ca2+ binding site II were equal to or greater than the average rate in the intact cTnIC complex (Fig. 2). In contrast, the cTnC·cTnI-(1–80) complex has below average 15NR 2 values in site I as well as the linker region, indicating internal motion in both regions, as previously shown (7.Gaponenko V. Abusamhadneh E. Abbott M.B. Finley N. Gasmi-Seabrook G. Solaro R.J. Rance M. Rosevear P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16681-16684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Relaxation parameters of cTnC in the intact complex were examined in the presence of urea to mimic the conditions used for neutron scattering studies of the skeletal complex (15.Olah G.A.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8233-8239Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In the presence of urea, the average 15N transverse relaxation rate increases to approximately 46 s−1. The increase in average rate likely results from an increase in rotational correlation time due to either interactions of urea with amino acid side chains or partial disruption of cTnC·cTnI interactions. It has been shown that the residence times of urea molecules in solvation sites near methyl groups of Val, Leu, and Ile are significant, possibly leading to a decrease in the hydrophobic effect within the protein and stabilizing solvent-exposed hydrophobic groups (29.Dotsch V.

Several studies have suggested that a proteoglycan tandem repeat (PTR), found in most of the hyaluronic acid-binding molecules including LP and aggrecan, acts as a functional site of interaction with hyaluronic acid (24.Perin J.P. Bonnet F. Thurieau C. Jolles P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13269-13272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Perkins S.J. Nealis A.S. Dudhia J. Hardingham T.E. J. Mol.

This study was undertaken to define more clearly the relationship between proteins of the UTI-BP family and the LP molecule in the human chondrosarcoma cell line HCS-2/8. For this, we first purified proteins of the UTI-BP family from HCS-2/8 cells on a large scale. Sequencing of tryptic fragments of UTI-BP40, chromatographic and electrophoretic examination, and comparison of UTI-binding properties have revealed the identity of UTI-BP40 to LP. We then tested a variety of antibodies raised against LP and the hyaluronic acid-binding region (HA-BR) of aggrecan proteoglycan to determine whether anti-LP and anti-HA-BR antibodies cross-react with proteins of the UTI-BP family. In addition, the domain-specific antibodies to LP synthetic peptides were used as probes in structural analyses of the LP molecule. Finally, we studied the binding and competition effect of UTI fragments or LP subdomains on the solid-phase binding in attempts to localize ligand sites in the UTI structure and the binding part of the LP molecule. The human chondrosarcoma cell line HCS-2/8 (provided by one of us (M. T.)) (27.Takigawa M. Tajima K. Pan H.-O. Enomoto M. Kinoshita A. Suzuki F. Takano Y. Mori Y. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3996-4002PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Enomoto M. Takigawa M. Adolphe M. Biological Regulation of Chondrocytes. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 321-338Google Scholar) was grown and cultured as described previously (29.Bansal M.K. Mason R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 928: 152-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 30.McCarthy M.T. Toole B.P. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 141: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 31.de Zhu J. Pan H.-O. Suzuki F. Takigawa M. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1994; 85: 364-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 25 mm HEPES buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.), 2.5 mm glucosamine, 3 mm glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.), 0.03 mm sodium pyruvate (Life Technologies, Inc.), 2.5 mm sodium lactate, 5 mm glucose (Yoneyama Chemical Co., Tokyo), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. For immunohistochemistry, ∼5 × 104 cells were seeded on chamber slides and cultured. UTI-BPs were purified by UTI-coupled Sepharose 4B and molecular sieve chromatography as described previously (4.Kobayashi H. Hirashima Y. Sun G.W. Fujie M. Shibata K. Tamotsu S. Miura K. Sugino D. Tanaka Y. Kondo S. Terao T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1383: 253-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified human UTI (50 mg) was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (15 g (dry weight) = 50-ml bed volume; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. HCS-2/8 cells (∼1 × 108 cells) were lysed in 5 ml of extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, and 1 μg/ml Streptomyceshyaluronidase; Seikagaku Kogyo, Co., Ltd., Tokyo) and incubated at 23 °C for 30 min. The resulting extract was centrifuged (5000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C), and the supernatant was dialyzed and mixed with bovine serum albumin (BSA)-Sepharose beads previously equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 10 mm benzamidine, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mg/ml ovalbumin, and 0.1 unit/ml aprotinin (all reagents from Sigma) using end-to-end rocking for 16 h at 4 °C. Unbound materials were again mixed with UTI-Sepharose beads using end-to-end rocking for 16 h at 4 °C. The affinity gel was then washed 10 times with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl and twice with H2O. Eluted materials were dialyzed and concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon, Tokyo) for analysis by molecular sieve chromatography with a HPLC system (Kanto Kagaku, Tokyo). The column was equilibrated with 4 m guanidine HCl and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The fraction size was 0.5 ml. Calibration of the gel filtration column was with high and low molecular mass standards (Cosmo Bio Co., Ltd., Tokyo). Eluent was monitored at 280 nm. The eluted fractions were assayed by dot-blot analysis using anti-LP, anti-LPpep-N, anti-LPpep-C, HABR-1, and HABR-2 antibodies (see below). The fractions containing ∼100-kDa UTI-BP (UTI-BP100) were separated from the mixture of UTI-BP45 and UTI-BP40. The mixture of UTI-BP45 and UTI-BP40 was further separated by reverse-phase HPLC. This sample was applied to a 4.6 × 250-mm Vydac C18 column (Kanto Kagaku) (2.Kobayashi H. Gotoh J. Fujie M. Terao T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20642-20647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C18 columns were packed for high performance and equilibrated with 5% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid before loading. The material was pumped directly onto the column. The column was eluted at 1.0 ml/min with a gradient from 5% to 50% acetonitrile over 90 min. Eluent was monitored at 214 and 280 nm. The fractions eluting between 26 and 29% acetonitrile (UTI-BP45) and between 32 and 34% acetonitrile (UTI-BP40) were pooled, dialyzed, and concentrated. The amount of protein in the soluble fraction was quantified by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) using BSA as a standard (32.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215653) Google Scholar). The isolation of hyaluronic acid-binding protein (HA-BP) derived from bovine nasal cartilage has been described in detail elsewhere (22.Tengblad A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 578: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 33.Engstrum-Laurent A. Hallagren R. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1985; 44: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). HA-BP was purified by affinity chromatography on hyaluronic acid covalently coupled to Sepharose. A purified preparation of HA-BP was supplied by Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Tokyo) and Seikagaku Kogyo, Co., Ltd. Five mg of HA-BP was concentrated using a Centricon 10 ultrafiltration tube by centrifugation at 200 ×g at 4 °C and then further purified by gel filtration chromatography on a column of Sepharose CL-6B (2.5 × 175 cm) equilibrated with 4 m guanidine HCl and 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4) as described by Tang et al. (34.Tang L.H. Rosenberg L. Reiner A. Poole A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10523-10531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The crude HA-BR and LP peaks were fractionated by gel filtration HPLC using an SW3000 column (Kanto Kagaku). Aliquots of each fraction were tested for their immunoreactivity by a specific dot-blot assay, and a HA-BR peak (>100-kDa polydisperse band by Western blotting) and a LP peak (∼40-kDa band) were obtained. LP purified from HA-BP does not contain HA-BR in aggrecan, which was confirmed by Western blot analysis with specific monoclonal antibodies raised against HA-BR in aggrecan (mAbs HABR-1 and HABR-2). A highly purified preparation of UTI was supplied by Mochida Pharmaceutical Co. (Tokyo). Chondroitinase ABC (Sigma) was used for enzymatic deglycosylation. Briefly, 1 mg of purified UTI was incubated with 1.0 μg of chondroitinase ABC for 24 h at 37 °C. The COOH-terminal fragment of UTI (HI-8, 8 kDa) prepared by trypsin digestion was a gift from Dr. Dan Sugino (Nissin Food Products, Shiga, Japan). Polyclonal antibodies against UTI and HI-8 were prepared by intradermal injection of rabbits with 0.1 mg of purified proteins emulsified in Freund's adjuvant. The antiserum was specific for UTI and had a 50% maximal binding at a dilution of 1:10,000 in an ELISA. The antisera to UTI and HI-8 were reactive with the 240-kDa inter-α-inhibitor, the 120-kDa pre-α-inhibitor, 40-kDa UTI, and 8-kDa HI-8 in ELISA or Western blot assays. Affinity-purified IgG was prepared by mixing 3 ml of antiserum with 1 ml of UTI (or HI-8)-Sepharose overnight at 4 °C. Following washing, the IgG was eluted with 0.1 m glycine HCl (pH 2.5). The pH of the eluted fractions was immediately raised, and the IgG was stored at −20 °C. Antibodies against LP (pAb LP) purified from bovine cartilage were prepared in a similar manner. In addition, to generate anti-LP peptide antibodies, two synthetic oligopeptide sequences,112VFLKGGSDSDAS123 (NH2-terminal fragment of LP) and 231TVPGVRNYGFWDKDKS246(COOH-terminal fragment of LP), corresponding to the NH2- and COOH-terminal domains of the human LP molecule, respectively, were selected. We searched for possible antigenic amino acid sequences on the LP molecule according to their predicted secondary structures and hydrophobicity. Each peptide was chosen based on its theoretical antigenic index and for specificity to the molecules. Antisera against LP synthetic oligopeptides were obtained from rabbits immunized four times with 0.2 mg of peptide conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin together with Freund's adjuvant. Titration of antisera was performed by an ELISA with peptides used for immunization as antigen. When the antibody titer reached a plateau, blood was totally collected, and the serum was separated. Polyclonal antibodies against the NH2-terminal (anti-LPpep-N) and COOH-terminal (anti-LPpep-C) fragments of LP were prepared in a similar manner using the eluate from protein A-Sepharose (HiTrap, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Male Balb/c mice were immunized at 14-day intervals by intraperitoneal injection of 20 μg of affinity-purified UTI. Three days after the last booster, spleen cells (1 × 108) were fused with the mouse myeloma cell line NS-1 and seeded according to standard procedures (35.Kohler G. Milstein C. Nature. 1975; 256: 495-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (12694) Google Scholar). The antibodies were designated 2A6, 5C12, 4D1, and 8H11. mAb 8H11 showed the strongest reactivity for UTI and reacted with the NH2-terminal domain of UTI. mAb 8H11 was isolated from ascites fluid by chromatography on a protein A-Sepharose column and used for ELISA. Monoclonal antibodies raised against HA-BR in aggrecan were prepared in a similar manner. Two antibodies were selected and designated HABR-1 and HABR-2. These mAbs were found to react with HA-BR in aggrecan, but not with LP. A list (antibody specificities and characterization) of the various mAbs and pAbs used in this study is shown in TableI. A purified preparation of each antibody was biotinylated according to the method of Guesdon (36.Guesdon J.L. J. Immunol. Methods. 1992; 150: 33-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) usingN-hydroxysuccinimidyl biotinamidocaproate (Sigma) following the manufacturer's suggested procedures.Table ISummary of the antibodies used in this study and their characteristic featuresAntibodiesAntigenic specificityReactivity and functionspAb UTI-BP aSee Refs. 2 and 4.UTI-BP purified from human SMT-cc1 cellsUTI-BP (SMT-cc1, chondrosarcoma, fibroblasts) and bovine cartilage LPpAb LPBovine cartilage LPLP and UTI-BP40pAb LPpep-NHuman LP peptide-(112–123)LP and UTI-BP40; blocks binding of LP to UTIpAb LPpep-CHuman LP peptide-(231–246)LP and UTI-BP40; fails to block binding of LP to UTIpAb UTIHuman UTIUTI, deglycosylated UTI, H1–8mAb 8H11Human UTINH2-terminal domain of UTI; blocks binding of UTI to LPmAb HABR-1Bovine HA-BR in aggrecanAggrecan and UTI-BP100mab HABR-2Bovine HA-BR in aggrecanAggrecan and UTI-BP100a See Refs. 2.Kobayashi H.

Open table in a new tab Electrophoretically homogeneous UTI-BP40 in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.3) was treated with bovine pancreatic trypsin at 37 °C for 3 h at a 1:100 enzyme/substrate molar ratio. Peptides were separated by 17% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions. The resulting gel was stained with Coomassie Blue and electrophoretically blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). In a parallel experiment, tryptic fragments were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC. Sequencing of the peptides was by Edman degradation using an automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems Model 477A) with on-line phenylthiohydantoin-derivative detection. Two major protein fractions have been isolated from a tryptic digest of the bovine proteoglycan complex (37.Heinegard D. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4250-4256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Bonnet F. Le Gledic S. Perin J.P. Jolles J. Jolles P. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1977; 252: 1971-1979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar): one of them, HA-BR, derives from the proteoglycan subunit and is located at its NH2terminus, whereas the other (TLP) is a common trypsin fragment from LP; their homogeneity was assessed by SDS-PAGE. TLP differs from native LP by the removal of a short amino-terminal peptide from native LP. Tryptic digestion of TLP·HA and TLP·HA-BR complexes was carried out according to previously reported experiments (24.Perin J.P. Bonnet F. Thurieau C. Jolles P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13269-13272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 22-kDa fragment, isolated from a tryptic digest of the TLP·HA complex, corresponds to the COOH-terminal region of bovine TLP (termed LP-C in this study). On the other hand, the 20-kDa fragment arising from the TLP·HA-BR digest is the NH2-terminal fragment of TLP (termed LP-N). The solid-phase binding assay has been described in detail elsewhere (26.Watanabe H. Cheung S.C. Itano N. Kimata K. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28057-28065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). 96-Well microtiter plates were coated with 100 μl of HA-BR (5 μg/ml), LP (2 μg/ml), LP-N (1 μg/ml), LP-C (1 μg/ml), or UTI-BP40(1 μg/ml) in bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.5) at 4 °C overnight. One-hundred μl of biotinylated UTI (0–10 μg/ml) was added to each well and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. In the case of the competition assay, studies on the binding of biotinylated UTI (10 nm) to immobilized UTI-BP40 or LP were performed in the presence of unlabeled competitors (UTI, HI-8, UTI-BP40, LP, LP-N, LP-C, α1-antitrypsin, α2-antiplasmin, and plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1; reagents from Cosmo Bio Co., Ltd.) for 2 h at 23 °C. In a parallel experiment, 96-well microtiter plates were coated with 50 μl of hyaluronic acid (100 μg/ml) conjugated to dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine (HA-PE; a gift from Seikagaku Kogyo, Co., Ltd.) in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C overnight as described previously (26.Watanabe H. Cheung S.C. Itano N. Kimata K. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28057-28065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). For studies of specificity, the same amount of chondroitin sulfate (CS)-PE or heparan sulfate (HS)-PE (a gift from Seikagaku Kogyo, Co., Ltd.) as HA-PE was used. After the wells were blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing 1% BSA (1 h, 23 °C), 50 μl of UTI-BP40 or LP (0.5 μg/ml) was added to some of the plates (2 h, 23 °C). Fifty μl of biotinylated UTI (0.1 μmol/liter) was added to each well in the absence or presence of CS (50 μl, 100 μg/ml) or HS (50 μl, 100 μg/ml) and incubated for 2 h at 23 °C. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated avidin was used as the detection probe. The cell extracts, purified proteins, or tryptic fragments were dissolved in sample buffer. The sample (20 μg of protein/lane for cell extracts and 0.1∼0.5 μg of protein/lane for purified proteins) was processed for electrophoresis using a SDS-polyacrylamide gel under nonreducing conditions. The resulting gel was electrophoretically blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, which was blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing 2% BSA, and then immunoblotted. The blot was subsequently processed by the biotin/avidin/peroxidase method (40.Kobayashi H. Schmitt M. Goretzki L. Chucholowski N. Calvete J. Kramer M. Gunzler W.A. Janicke F. Graeff H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5147-5152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bands were visualized with the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Tokyo). The membranes were then placed between two transparencies and exposed to Kodak film. In all experiments, some strips were incubated with nonimmune rabbit or mouse IgG as a negative control. The data presented are the means of triplicate determinations in one representative experiment unless stated otherwise. Data are presented as means ± S.D. All statistical analyses were performed using StatView for Macintosh. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for the comparisons between different groups. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Clone 8H11 was produced by somatic cell fusion. The interaction of mAb 8H11 with UTI was evaluated by immunoblotting with UTI, chondroitinase ABC-treated UTI (deglycosylated UTI), HI-8, and UTI reduced with 2-mercaptoethanol (Fig. 1). mAb 8H11 reacted with UTI and deglycosylated UTI, but not with HI-8 or UTI reduced with 2-mercaptoethanol (Fig. 1, right panel). This suggests that the epitope resides in the NH2-terminal domain of UTI (since it is missing in HI-8) and is destroyed by reduction of the disulfide bonds. In contrast, Western blot analysis indicated that polyclonal antibodies raised against UTI (pAb UTI) recognized a determinant present on a wide variety of UTI preparations (UTI, deglycosylated UTI, HI-8, and UTI reduced with 2-mercaptoethanol) (Fig.1, left panel). The ELISA data also confirmed that the 8H11 determinant was sequestered in the NH2-terminal structure of UTI (data not shown). Using procedures described previously (2.Kobayashi H. Gotoh J. Fujie M. Terao T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20642-20647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Kobayashi H. Hirashima Y. Sun G.W. Fujie M. Shibata K. Tamotsu S. Miura K. Sugino D. Tanaka Y. Kondo S. Terao T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1383: 253-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), UTI-BP was purified from human HCS-2/8 cell lysates by UTI-coupled Sepharose 4B. As shown in Fig. 2, HCS-2/8 cell-derived UTI-BP is composed of three different molecular species: UTI-BP100, UTI-BP45, and UTI-BP40. pAb raised against UTI-BP (pAb UTI-BP) reacted with all members of the UTI-BP family (UTI-BP100, UTI-BP45, and UTI-BP40) and the purified LP molecule as well as with both the NH2-terminal immunoglobulin-like domain of LP (LP-N, ∼20 kDa) and the COOH-terminal PTR domain of LP (LP-C, ∼22 kDa). After immunoabsorption of anti-UTI-BP antibodies with LP, the remaining antibodies recognized UTI-BP100 and UTI-BP45 in UTI-BPs, but not the UTI-BP40 (Fig.3). This shows that the 40-kDa band does not contain more than LP. The interaction of anti-LP antibodies (pAb LP) with UTI-BPs was also evaluated by immunoblotting with UTI-BP100, UTI-BP45, and UTI-BP40. pAb LP reacted with UTI-BP40 and the purified LP molecule as well as with both LP-N and LP-C. However, pAb LP failed to react with UTI-BP100 or UTI-BP45. pAb LPpep-N, in which the epitope presents on the NH2-terminal domain of LP, reacted with UTI-BP40, LP, and LP-N, but not with LP-C, UTI-BP100, or UTI-BP45, whereas pAb LPpep-C, in which the epitope resides in the COOH-terminal domain of LP, reacted with UTI-BP40, LP, and LP-C, but not with LP-N, UTI-BP100, or UTI-BP45. Western blot analysis thus demonstrated that pAbs raised against LP synthetic peptides exclusively recognized both their respective domains of LP and UTI-BP40. It is unlikely that UTI-BP100 and UTI-BP45 have antigenically cross-reactivity with LP. These results suggest that the UTI-binding sites purified from HCS-2/8 cells may contain other binding proteins or UTI receptors rather than LP. mAbs HABR-1 and HABR-2 reacted with UTI-BP100, but not with UTI-BP45 or UTI-BP40 (data not shown), suggesting that UTI-BP100 is composed of HA-BR from the aggrecan fragment.Figure 3Characterization of anti-UTI-BP antibodies immunoabsorbed with LP. Shown are the results from 12% SDS-PAGE and Western blotting of UTI-BP (1 μg/lane) using anti-UTI-BP antibodies (lane 1) and antibodies immunoabsorbed with LP (lane 2) under nonreducing conditions. The molecular masses (in kilodaltons) and positions of marker standards are indicated to the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Purified UTI-BP40 was digested with trypsin, and the resultant peptides were purified by immunoblotting or reverse-phase HPLC and identified by NH2-terminal sequencing (Fig.4). Aliquots of each blotting or each pool were analyzed by gas-phase sequencing. A comparison with data in the GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank (accession number 001884) showed that the six tryptic peptides were identical to subsequences found in human LP. In every case, the UTI-BP40 fragments corresponded to those expected from cleavage of LP at tryptic sites. The molecular masses of the six tryptic fragments were equivalent to 32.2% of the mass of LP (354 amino acids). Authentic LP and UTI-BP40 displayed equivalent retention times (64 min) on a C18 reverse-phase HPLC column as determined by A 214 detection. Similar electrophoretic migration (40 kDa) of the two proteins was observed on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel under nonreducing conditions (data not shown). Since the yields of UTI-BP45were small, studies on the specific binding of biotinylated UTI to immobilized UTI-BP45 could not be carried out in this study. We have separate"
https://openalex.org/W2160658713,"Insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins are phosphorylated by multiple tyrosine kinases, including the insulin receptor. Phosphorylated IRS proteins bind to SH2 domain-containing proteins, thereby triggering downstream signaling pathways. The Drosophila insulin receptor (dIR) C-terminal extension contains potential binding sites for signaling molecules, suggesting that dIR might not require an IRS protein to accomplish its signaling functions. However, we obtained a cDNA encodingDrosophila IRS (dIRS), and we demonstrated expression of dIRS in a Drosophila cell line. Like mammalian IRS proteins, the N-terminal portion of dIRS contains a pleckstrin homology domain and a phosphotyrosine binding domain that binds to phosphotyrosine residues in both human and Drosophilainsulin receptors. When coexpressed with dIRS in COS-7 cells, a chimeric receptor (the extracellular domain of human IR fused to the cytoplasmic domain of dIR) mediated insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of dIRS. Mutating the juxtamembrane NPXY motif markedly reduced the ability of the receptor to phosphorylate dIRS. In contrast, the NPXY motifs in the C-terminal extension of dIR were required for stable association with dIRS. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated insulin-dependent binding of dIRS to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and SHP2. However, we did not detect interactions with Grb2, SHC, or phospholipase C-γ. Taken together with published genetic studies, these biochemical data support the hypothesis that dIRS functions directly downstream from the insulin receptor in Drosophila. Insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins are phosphorylated by multiple tyrosine kinases, including the insulin receptor. Phosphorylated IRS proteins bind to SH2 domain-containing proteins, thereby triggering downstream signaling pathways.

Yenush L. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 228: 179-208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, phosphotyrosine residues in IRS molecules interact with various SH2 domain-containing proteins, such as Grb2 and PI 3-kinase, thereby activating several signaling pathways (1White M.F. Yenush L. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 228: 179-208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Sun X.J. Rothenberg P. Kahn C.R. Backer J.M. Araki E. Wilden P.A. Cahill D.A. Goldstein B.J. White M.F.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2718-2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Two isoforms of the insulin receptor have been identified in Drosophila (8Fernandez R. Tabarini D. Azpiazu N. Frasch M.

One isoform closely resembles mammalian receptors, and the other contains a 368-amino acid C-terminal extension. Because this extension contains many potential sites for tyrosine phosphorylation, including consensus binding sites for the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase, it was suggested that the Drosophila insulin receptor might mediate signaling activities normally performed by IRS molecules. However, Yenushet al. (10Yenush L. Fernandez R. Myers Jr., M.G. Grammer T.C. Sun X.J. Blenis J. Pierce J.H. Schlessinger J. White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2509-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) found that the Drosophila insulin receptor does not mediate insulin-stimulated mitogenesis in 32D cells without the addition of mammalian IRS-1. This raised the question as to whether Drosophila might have an endogenous IRS molecule. In this study, we have obtained a cDNA encodingDrosophila IRS. 2This work was originally presented at the 80th Annual Meeting of the Endocrine Society, June 24–27, 1998, New Orleans, LA. The dIRS molecule is similar to mammalian IRS molecules, as it contains a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain, and a phosphorylation domain with multiple potential sites of tyrosine phosphorylation. While this work was in progress, Böhniet al. (11Böhni R. Riesgo-Escovar J. Oldham S. Brogiolo W. Stocker H. Andruss B. Beckingham K. Hafen E. Cell. 1999; 97: 865-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar) reported that dIRS is encoded by the chico locus, a mutant phenotype associated with abnormalities in cell size, cell number, and metabolism. To better understand the Drosophila insulin signaling pathway, we have investigated the interactions of dIRS with both human and Drosophila insulin receptors as well as downstream signaling molecules. By using the complete amino acid sequence of mouse (m) IRS-1, we searched the GenBankTM EST data base and identified a fragment of Drosophila IRS (clone LD16868, accession numberAA536319), which we obtained from Genome Systems, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). The nucleotide sequences of both strands of the clone were determined using the ABI PRISM Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (Perkin-Elmer) or the ABI PRISM dRhodamine Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (Perkin-Elmer). Reactions were analyzed using the ABI373A DNA sequencer. Sequence data were analyzed and assembled using the computer program GeneWorks (version 2.5.1, Oxford Molecular Group, Inc., Campbell, CA). We constructed expression vectors for fusion proteins of dIRS with a yeast activation domain by ligating part or all of dIRS cDNA into the plasmid pB42AD (CLONTECH, San Francisco, CA). Fragments of dIRS cDNA were amplified using oligonucleotide primers that introduced in-frame EcoRI and SalI restriction sites into the 5′ ends of the upstream and downstream primers, respectively.Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to amplify the fragments for the N-terminal construct (amino acids 1–410) as well as the phosphorylation domain construct (amino acids 235–968); however, we used Expand Long Template Polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to amplify the cDNA for the dIRS full-length construct (amino acids 1–968). The N-terminal construct contained all residues up to, but not including, the first YXXM motif. Note that the N-terminal construct contained ≈175 amino acid residues after the region of homology to PTB domains of mammalian IRS molecules. The phosphorylation domain construct contained all residues following the end of homology to other known PTB domains. We constructed expression vectors for fusion proteins of dIR with the prokaryotic LexA DNA-binding protein by ligating cDNA encoding portions of dIR into the plasmid pLexA (CLONTECH, San Francisco, CA). dIR cDNAs were amplified from EST AA246263 using oligonucleotide primers that introduced in-frame EcoRI and SalI restriction sites into the 5′ ends of the upstream and downstream primers, respectively. A combination of Pfu DNA polymerase and Taq DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used to amplify the fragments. The dIRc construct contained amino acid residues 1332–2148 (from the transmembrane domain to the C terminus of the molecule). The transmembrane + juxtamembrane domains construct contained residues 1332–1661. The Δ4 NPXY construct contained residues 1332–1965, beginning in the transmembrane domain and ending before the four C-terminal NPXY motifs. We constructed the yeast expression vector for the fusion protein of the hIRc with the prokaryotic LexA DNA-binding protein by ligating cDNA encoding portions of hIR into the plasmid pLexA (CLONTECH, San Francisco, CA). hIRc cDNA was amplified from a cDNA construct of the insulin receptor (12Ullrich A. Bell J.R. Chen E.Y. Herrera R. Petruzzelli L.M. Dull T.J. Gray A. Coussens L. Liao Y.C. Tsubokawa M. Mason M. Seeburg P.H. Grunfeld C. Rosen O.M. Ramachandran J. Nature. 1985; 313: 756-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (1526) Google Scholar) using oligonucleotide primers that introduced in-frameEcoRI and BamHI restriction sites into the 5′ ends of the upstream and downstream primers, respectively. The construct contained residues 941–1343. The IR juxtamembrane NPXY motif mutant (JMm, residues 941–1343; N957A, Y960A) and the IR kinase dead mutant (K1018A, residues 941–1343) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. Assays were performed according to the MATCHMAKER LexA Two-hybrid System protocol (CLONTECH, San Francisco, CA). Briefly, EGY48 cells (matα his3, trp1, ura3-52, leu2::3Lexop-LEU2, LYS2), which were pretransformed with p8op-lacZ, were cotransformed with plasmid constructs by the polyethylene glycol/lithium acetate protocol (CLONTECH, San Francisco, CA). Transformants were grown on appropriate SD (CLONTECH, San Francisco, CA) glucose agar plates for 3 days at 30 °C. Several independent colonies were transferred to SD galactose/raffinose agar plates and grown overnight at 30 °C to induce expression of B42 fusion proteins. The interactions were then assessed using colony lift β-galactosidase assays and liquid culture β-galactosidase assays with O-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) as the substrate, according to the CLONTECHprotocol. For the liquid culture β-galactosidase assays, the data were normalized to the interaction of hIRc with mIRS-3 (defined to be 100%). Experiments were repeated twice in triplicate. Full-length dIRS cDNA was amplified by PCR from the EST clone using Pfu DNA polymerase. The primers included a site for EcoRI restriction endonuclease and a Kozak consensus sequence (13Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3598) Google Scholar) at the 5′ end of the coding sequence. The primers also introduced a site for SalI restriction endonuclease at the 3′ end of the cDNA. The PCR product was first cloned using the Original TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The insert was excised using appropriate restriction endonucleases and was ligated into pcDNA3.1 Myc-His version A (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). EST clone AA246263 served as a PCR template to amplify residues 1344–2148 of the Drosophilainsulin receptor. We used Pfu DNA polymerase and oligonucleotide primers to introduce in-frame ApaI and SpeI restriction sites into the 5′ ends of the upstream and downstream primers, respectively. The product was cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO using the TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). We then used a cDNA clone of the human IR (12Ullrich A. Bell J.R. Chen E.Y. Herrera R. Petruzzelli L.M. Dull T.J. Gray A. Coussens L. Liao Y.C. Tsubokawa M. Mason M. Seeburg P.H. Grunfeld C. Rosen O.M. Ramachandran J. Nature. 1985; 313: 756-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (1526) Google Scholar) in pGEM4z that had a synonymous substitution in codon 948 to create an ApaI restriction site. This hIR cDNA clone was digested with ApaI and SpeI to remove hIR amino acids 949–1343. The dIR TA-cloned construct was then digested with ApaI and SpeI; the fragment containing dIR residues 1344–2148 was ligated to the pGEM4z-hIR fragment containing hIR residues 1–948. The entire chimeric hIR-dIR was then excised by restriction digestion with SalI and SpeI and ligated into pcDNA 3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) that had been digested with XhoI and XbaI. We used PCR-based techniques to introduce mutations at the five NPXY motifs in the cytoplasmic domain of the chimeric hIR-dIR molecule. Phenylalanine was substituted for dIR Tyr1358 in the juxtamembrane of the Y1358F chimeric receptor. In the ΔCT mutant receptor, we substituted Phe for Tyr1969 and deleted dIR amino acid residues 1970–2148 (containing the remaining three NPXY motifs). In the Y1358F/ΔCT mutant, all five NPXY motifs were either mutated or deleted. Constructs were confirmed by sequencing.

Plasmid DNA was transfected into COS-7 cells using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Transfected cells were serum-starved for 4 h (in DMEM containing 1% insulin-free BSA, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine), stimulated with insulin (0–100 nm) for 10 min, and immediately lysed using a buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmTris (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin. Proteins from cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. Immunoblotting was performed using anti-Myc 9E10 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) antibodies. Secondary antibodies were labeled with horseradish peroxidase. Proteins were visualized using Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Transfected cells were serum-starved for 16 h (in DMEM containing 1% insulin-free BSA, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine), stimulated with 100 nm insulin for 5 min, and lysed using a buffer containing 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.3m sodium chloride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm sodium vanadate, Complete® protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). Four-fifths of the lysate for each sample was used for immunoprecipitation. The lysate was incubated with an excess of Ultralink-immobilized protein G (Pierce) and autoantibodies to the IR that were obtained from patient B-19 with clinical type B insulin-resistance syndrome (15Taylor S.I. Underhill L.H. Marcus-Samuels B. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 109: 656-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In contrast to other experiments described here, proteins were separated under non-reducing conditions by omitting dithiothreitol and adding 10 mm NEM (16Kramer H. Deger A. Koch R. Rapp R. Hinz M. Weber U. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1987; 368: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) to the lysate in addition to the Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were boiled 3 min before resolving using SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes. Immunoblotting was performed using monoclonal anti-Myc antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), polyclonal antibodies directed against the α-subunit of the human insulin receptor (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Secondary antibodies were labeled with horseradish peroxidase, and proteins were visualized using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Transfected cells were starved for 5 h (in DMEM containing 1% insulin-free BSA, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine), stimulated with 100 nm insulin for 5 min, and immediately lysed using a buffer containing 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.3 m sodium chloride, 10 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm sodium vanadate, and Complete® protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Two-thirds of the lysate for each sample was used for immunoprecipitation. The lysate was incubated with an excess of Ultralink-immobilized protein G (Pierce) and monoclonal Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitates and cell extracts (non-immunoprecipitated lysate) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. Immunoblotting was performed using polyclonal antibodies to Grb2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), PI 3-kinase p85α (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phospholipase C-γ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), SHC (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), and SHP2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) were also used. Secondary antibodies were labeled with horseradish peroxidase. Proteins were visualized using ECL. Drosophila S2 cells were cultured in Schneider'sDrosophila medium with l-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. DNAzol (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used to lyse cells from a confluent 25-ml culture and isolate genomic DNA according to the instructions provided by the product manufacturer. S2 cells were lysed in a buffer containing 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.3 m sodium chloride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mmsodium vanadate, and Complete® protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Protein from cell lysates was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane. Immunoblotting was performed using a polyclonal peptide antibody made against residues 919–935 of dIRS (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA). Antibody specificity was confirmed using lysates from COS-7 cells transfected with empty vector or with Myc-tagged dIRS; both preimmune and postimmune serum were tested (data not shown). Secondary antibodies were labeled with horseradish peroxidase. Proteins were visualized using ECL. We identified a sequence in the EST data base (AA536319) corresponding to a cDNA encodingDrosophila IRS (dIRS). We determined the full-length coding sequence of dIRS cDNA (2907 bp). The clone also contained a 110-bp 5′-untranslated sequence, a Kozak consensus sequence (13Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3598) Google Scholar) at the translation start site, a polyadenylation site, and a poly(A) tail. dIRS is predicted to contain 968 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 108,000 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence of our cDNA clone (GenBankTM accession numberAF092046) 3The nucleotide and amino acid sequences for Drosophila insulin receptor substrate have been deposited in the GenBankTM data base under accession number AF092046.

Although no other similar Drosophila proteins have been identified in the non-redundant data base, several entries in the EST data base (dbEST) appear to also encode dIRS. is identical to that published by Böhni et al.

Like mammalian IRS molecules, dIRS contains a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain, and a C-terminal phosphorylation domain. The PH and PTB domains of dIRS are 45 and 41% identical, respectively, to those of rIRS-1; similar results are obtained when dIRS is compared with other mammalian IRS molecules (Fig.1). The phosphorylation domain does not display significant homology to other molecules. We identified at least six potential sites of tyrosine phosphorylation that are present in the context of known consensus binding sequences for SH2 domain-containing proteins (Table I). Four of these sites, including two potential binding sites for the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase (Tyr411 and Tyr641), are located in the phosphorylation domain.Table IPotential binding sites for SH2 domain-containing proteinsTyrosine positionTyrosine and surrounding residuesSH2-domain containing proteins with which dIRS may interact122YDHV(Crk), (fps/fes)194YVELSHP2/(corkscrew)411YIPMPI 3-kinase-p85641YLEMPI 3-kinase-p85788YTQISHP2/(corkscrew), (Csk), (Syk)948YAKI(Csk)dIRS possesses at least six potential phosphotyrosine residues that are predicted to bind several SH2 domain-containing proteins, as suggested by published consensus binding sequences (35Songyang Z.

Parentheses are used to indicate consensus sequences for proteins that have not been tested in coimmunoprecipitation experiments. The EST clone described above was derived from Drosophila embryo, although other ESTs of dIRS have since been obtained from the ovary and head. In order to determine whether the predicted dIRS protein was expressed, we obtained an antibody to dIRS by immunizing rabbits with a peptide specific to the C-terminal region of the protein (amino acid residues 919–935). Through immunoblotting, we confirmed that dIRS is expressed in Drosophila S2 cells (embryonic epithelial cells), with anM r ≈144,000. Interestingly, when expressed in COS-7 cells, Myc-tagged dIRS had an M r≈132,000 (Fig. 2). When the nucleotide sequence of the entire dIRS EST insert was used to search the GenBankTMnucleotide data base, we noted that the first 110 bases of our EST insert are identical to the last 110 bases of a dJNK genomic sequence (17Sluss H.K. Han Z. Barrett T. Davis R.J. Ip Y.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2745-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Since these bases occur after the dJNK polyadenylation site, we hypothesized that dIRS is located immediately downstream of dJNK, which has been mapped to chromosome 2, region 31 B-C (17Sluss H.K. Han Z. Barrett T. Davis R.J. Ip Y.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2745-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) (Fig.3). To test this hypothesis, genomic DNA was isolated from S2 cells. We used the genomic DNA as a template to perform PCR. In the first PCR, the amplicon extended from the last exon of dJNK through the middle of the 110-bp sequence. In the second PCR, the amplicon extended from the 110-bp sequence to the dIRS sequence. These reactions confirmed that the 110-bp sequence was located in close proximity to the coding sequences of the genes for both dJNK and our dIRS EST clone. Finally, we performed another PCR with one primer derived from a sequence in the dJNK genomic clone (downstream from the polyadenylation site) and a second primer in the 5′ end of dIRS. After being ligated into the TA-cloning vector, the sequence of the amplified DNA was determined, thereby confirming that it contained both the dJNK genomic clone sequence as well as the dIRS sequence. This suggests that dJNK is immediately upstream of dIRS. To investigate the functional interactions of dIRS with the human insulin receptor, we used the yeast two-hybrid system (Fig. 4 A). We fused dIRS to the prokaryotic LexA DNA-binding protein in the pLexA expression vector; the human insulin receptor cytoplasmic domain (hIRc) was fused to a yeast transcription activation domain in pB42AD. As judged by the yeast two-hybrid assay, the interaction between dIRS and hIRc was nearly three times the strength of that of mIRS-3 and hIRc. The interaction of dIRS with hIRc was specific in that there was a negligible interaction of dIRS with human lamin C. Furthermore, there was no detectable signal when hIRc was expressed in the absence of dIRS (data not shown). The PTB domains of mammalian IRS molecules bind to a phosphotyrosine residue in the juxtamembrane NPXY motif of the insulin receptor. Therefore, we inquired whether the PTB domain in dIRS had similar binding specificity. To address this question, we constructed two mutants. In one mutant, the Asn957 and Tyr960 in the NPXY motif were mutated to alanine residues (JMm); in the other mutant (K1018A), Lys1018 in the ATP-binding site of hIRc was mutated to Ala in order to inactivate the receptor tyrosine kinase. Use of either of the mutant insulin receptors decreased the strength of the interaction by 85%. Interestingly, unlike the situation with mammalian IRS molecules, dIRS retained a significant (≈15%) ability to bind to the hIRc. To investigate this interaction, we created two overlapping partial constructs of dIRS (Fig. 4 A). One construct (amino acid residues 1–410) contained the PH and PTB domains plus 175 amino acids residues downstream from the PTB domain. The other construct (amino acid residues 235–968) contained the C-terminal portion of the molecule distal to the PTB domain. These two constructs will be referred to as the “N-terminal” and “phosphorylation domain” constructs, respectively. The N-terminal construct interacted nearly as strongly as the full-length dIRS with the WT hIRc. However, like mammalian IRS molecules, the N-terminal construct did not interact with either the JMm or the K1018A hIRc constructs. Interestingly, the phosphorylation domain of dIRS was able to interact with WT hIRc. The strength of this interaction was ≈25% of the strength of the interaction betw"

Trains of local Ca2+ spikes were elicited in pancreatic acinar cells by infusion of inositol trisphosphate through a whole cell patch pipette, and the Ca2+-dependent Cl− current spikes were recorded. The spikes were only transiently inhibited by cytochalasin B, an agent that acts on microfilaments. In contrast, nocodazole (5–100 μm), an agent that disrupts the microtubular network, dose-dependently reduced spike frequency and decreased spike amplitude leading to total blockade of the response. Consistent with an effect of microtubular disruption, colchicine also inhibited spiking but neither Me2SO nor β-lumicolchicine, an inactive analogue of colchicine, had any effect. The microtubule-stabilizing agent, taxol, also inhibited spiking. The nocodazole effects were not due to complete loss of function of the Ca2+ signaling apparatus, because supramaximal carbachol concentrations were still able to mobilize a Ca2+ response. Finally, as visualized by 2-photon excitation microscopy of ER-Tracker, nocodazole promoted a loss of the endoplasmic reticulum in the secretory pole region.

For example, the tethering of protein kinase A to protein kinase A-associated proteins is used to direct global cAMP signals to specifically regulate proteins linked to protein kinase A-associated protein (1.Gray P.C. Scott J.D. Catterall W.A. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 1998; 8: 330-334Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Another example is Homer, a protein that anchors intracellular release channels close to metabotropic glutamate receptors, and so functionally couples local inositol trisphosphate (IP3)1 production with local IP3 receptors (2.Fagni L. Chavis P. Ango F. Bockaert J. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 80-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The cytoskeleton is thought to play a role in the cellular positioning of these signaling complexes. In our experiments we sought to determine a role for the cytoskeleton in regional positioning of the Ca2+ release apparatus in polarized epithelial cells. The cytoskeleton maintains the polarization observed in many epithelial cells (3.Mays R.W. Beck K.A. Nelson W.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 16-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 4.Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272, 4 Pt 2: F425-F429Google Scholar) and, therefore, might be expected to play a role in second messenger signaling cascades. Many epithelia exhibit polarization of Ca2+ signaling pathways, including the differential distribution of IP3 receptors (5.Nathanson M.H. Fallon M.B. Padfield P.J. Maranto A.R. J. Biol.

Cell. 1993; 74: 661-668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). However, to date, there have been no direct experiments to investigate the role of the cytoskeleton in shaping these signaling elements. In this study we have used acutely isolated mouse pancreatic acinar cells and established trains of Ca2+-dependent current spikes by the infusion of IP3 through a whole cell patch pipette. These spikes have previously been shown to be due to localized Ca2+ release in the secretory pole region (as identified by the clustering of secretory granules) (9.Kasai H. Li Y.X. Miyashita Y. Cell. 1993; 74: 669-677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 10.Thorn P. Lawrie A.M. Smith P.M. Gallacher D.V. Petersen O.H.

During the trains of IP3-induced spikes, we tested the effects of agents that affect microfilaments and microtubules. Microfilament disruption transiently affected the response, whereas agents that act on microtubules specifically inhibited the local Ca2+spikes but left the responses to supramaximal carbachol concentrations intact even after an extended time period (up to 1.5 h). We determined that microtubule disruption led to a redistribution of the endoplasmic reticulum away from the secretory pole region. We conclude that microtubules are essential in maintaining local Ca2+spikes, at least in part by locally positioning the endoplasmic reticulum. Fresh isolated mouse pancreatic acinar cells were prepared by collagenase (CLSPA, Worthington, Lakewood, NJ) digestion at 36 °C for 7 min as described previously (12.Thorn P. Petersen O.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 11-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Cells were plated onto poly-l-ornithine (Sigma, Poole, UK)-coated dishes and used within 3 h of isolation. Whole cell patch clamping was performed with an Axopatch 1D (Axon Instruments) patch clamp amplifier. Pipettes had a resistance of 3–5 MΩ (pipette puller; Brown and Flaming, Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA) and, after breaking through to whole cell had a measured, but uncompensated series resistance of 10–20 MΩ. The pipette solution contained (in millimolar): KCl 140, MgCl21, EGTA or 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid 0.5, KOH-HEPES 10, ATP 2, pH 7.2, inositol 2,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(2,4,5)P3) 0.01, with the free [Ca2+] fixed at 50 or 100 nm by the addition of CaCl2at appropriate concentrations (MAXC; Chris Patten, Pacific Grove, CA). The extracellular solution contained (in millimolar): NaCl 135, KCl 5, MgCl2 1, CaCl2 1, glucose 10, NaOH-HEPES 10, pH 7.4. Drugs (all obtained from Sigma) were bolus-applied to the bathing solution, and all experiments were conducted at room temperature (∼21 °C). The inclusion of 10–12 μminositol 2,4,5-trisphosphate (gift from Professor R. Irvine) in the pipette solution elicited a train of short lasting Ca2+-dependent current spikes, previously shown to be a good correlate of localized Ca2+ release in the secretory pole of acinar cells (13.Thorn P. Cell Calcium. 1996; 20: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The spikes were recorded on a computer using an analogue/digital interface (National Instruments, Austin, TX) and a data acquisition program (J. Dempster). Current amplitudes and current frequency were determined and analyzed with an Excel spreadsheet (Microsoft, OR). In the experiments of Fig. 3(inset), the pipette solution contained (in millimolar): NMDGCl 40, calcium gluconate 1.71, MgCl2 6.77,N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-ethylenediamine-triacetic acid, 10, calculated to give a final free [Ca2+] of 448 nm using the computer algorithm MAXC. The osmolarity was adjusted with mannitol to 300 mOsm. In the experiments of Fig. 3(inset), cells were whole cell voltage-clamped at a potential of −38 mV and voltage steps made in 10 mV increments between −68 and +82 mV. Currents were sampled at 2 kHz, and the peak current amplitudes for each voltage step were recorded as the mean over a 100-ms period at the end of the 2.5-s pulse. Ca2+ imaging experiments were performed by inclusion of 40–50 μmCa2+ Green (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in the pipette solution. Cells were illuminated with a visible laser (Annova 70; Coherent, Santa Clara, CA) at 488 nm and imaged through a Nikon 40× UV, 1.2 numerical aperature, oil immersion objective. Full-frame images (128 × 128 pixels) were captured on a cooled charge-coupled device camera (70% quantum efficiency, 5 electrons of readout noise; Lincoln Laboratories, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA) with a pixel size of 200 nm at the specimen and at frame rates of up to 500 Hz. After recording on the computer, the data were analyzed with custom software with bleach correction routines and appropriate smoothing. Data was recorded as ΔF/F o images (100 × (F −F o)/F o), whereF is the recorded fluorescence and F owas obtained from the mean of the first 20 acquired frames. Cells were prepared as for the patch clamp experiments and plated onto glass coverslips. Next the cells were incubated for 15–20 min in control extracellular solution, solution containing 1% Me2SO, or solution containing 100 μm nocodazole. At the end of the incubation period the cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and then quenched with ethanolamine, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton, and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Primary antibodies, either polyclonal rabbit anti-α-tubulin or monoclonal mouse anti-α-tubulin (Sigma), were incubated for 1 h at room temperature (with 3% bovine serum albumin). The cells were then washed three times before addition of either donkey anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to Oregon Green for 1 h at 4 °C. The cells were then washed three times and mounted. The cell fluorescence was imaged in three dimensions and restored as described previously (14.Dictenberg J.B. Zimmerman W. Sparks C.A. Young A.

Fay F.S. Science. 1995; 268: 1483-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). We used two methods to observe the endoplasmic reticulum, both using the Dapoxyl probe ER-Tracker (Molecular Probes). The first method used three-dimensional image reconstruction techniques as described (15.Carrington W.A. Lynch R.M. Moore E.D. Isenberg G. Fogarty K.E. Fay F.S. Science. 1995; 268: 1483-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) with a microscope (Olympus IX70; Melville, NY), an Olympus PL APO 60 × 1.4 numerical aperature oil immersion objective and a 0.25 μm Z section resolution. After cell preparation we incubated the cells in 100–200 nm ER-Tracker for 20–30 min. The cells were then centrifuged, resuspended in normal extracellular solution, and plated onto glass coverslips. These were then treated with drugs before fluorescence microscopy analysis. In the second method the cells were prepared in exactly the same way but two-photon excitation microscopy (model TCS-SP-MP; Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany) was used to record the fluorescence signal. Small groups of cells were selected in phase contrast using an infinity-corrected, 63× water immersion, 1.2 numerical aperature, plan apochromatic lens with a cover glass correction collar and a 225-μm working distance. The ER-Tracker was excited by laser light from a solid state Millenia V-pumped Tsunami Ti/sapphire laser tuned to 800 nm, with a pulse width of 1.3 ps and a repetition rate of 82 MHz. Emitted light was captured with a spectrophotometer detector using a window of 450–700 nm. A series of optical sections, with 1-μm increments between images, was taken through the cells to build up a three-dimensional picture of the fluorescence distribution. Drugs were bath-applied after the first series of optical sections had been captured, and further series were captured every 5 min for up to 40 min. Image analysis was performed using the computer program Lucida (Kinetic Imaging, Liverpool, UK). We measured the average fluorescence in secretory pole (SP) and basal pole (BP) regions (within regions of about 5-μm diameter) and expressed them as a ratio (SP/BP). For each cell, all values were expressed as a percentage of the initial ratio obtained at time 0. The SP/BP ratio, obtained from the same regions, was then followed over time to give an indication of regional changes in fluorescence. We whole cell patch clamped single mouse pancreatic acinar cells and established a train of Ca2+ spikes by the infusion of 10–12 μm Ins(2,4,5)P3 through the pipette solution. Previous work has shown that the activation of Cl(Ca) current spikes are a faithful record of a local secretory pole Ca2+ signal (10.Thorn P. Lawrie A.M. Smith P.M. Gallacher D.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 661-668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 16.Kidd J.F. Fogarty K.E. Tuft R. Thorn P. J. Physiol. 1999; 520: 187-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 17.Fogarty K.E. Kidd J.F. Tuft R.A. Thorn P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 2298-2306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar); therefore, we recorded the whole cell currents as a convenient measure of the regional Ca2+ spikes. The injection of Ins(2,4,5)P3 circumvents cell surface receptors and allows the direct study of the mechanisms of IP3-dependent Ca2+ release. Typically, once the whole cell has been established and, after a short period of equilibration (∼1 min), a train of Cl(Ca)spikes are established that continue for the lifetime of the whole cell (up to 40 min, Fig. 1 A). The secretory pole region of acinar cells, i.e. the region where the Ca2+ spikes are localized, has an extensive network of microfilaments (18.Muallem S. Kwiatkowska K. Xu X. Yin H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). To test for a role of microfilaments in the mechanism of the generation of the Ca2+ spikes, we applied cytochalasin B during an IP3-induced spike train (Fig. 1 B). Consistently, we observed that, on addition of 100 μm cytochalasin B to the bathing solution, there was a transient reduction of spike amplitude (Fig. 1 B,n = 3). However, once resumed, the spike activity was apparently no different from the control period before addition of the drug. We conclude that, although the transient inhibition suggests some role, microfilaments are not essential for the maintenance of the local Ca2+ spikes. We then tested the effects of agents known to act on microtubules. Fig.2 A shows that the application of nocodazole, an agent known to promote microtubule depolymerization, to the bathing solution led to a cessation of spiking characterized by an initial decrease in spike amplitude followed by a decrease in frequency (n = 11). Lower concentrations of nocodazole did not have such rapid effects but instead led to a slower dose-dependent decrease in spike amplitude (Fig.2 B). Application of the carrier alone (1% Me2SO, n = 3) had no effect on the spikes. Given the widespread importance of the microtubular network in cell physiology, the effect of nocodazole treatment might be nonspecific and reflect a general compromise of cell function. However, we showed that, after nocodazole had completely abolished the IP3-induced spikes, the cells were still able to respond to a supramaximal concentration of carbachol (Fig. 3, 1 mm carbachol, n = 3). In fact, we found in other experiments that this supramaximal carbachol response, measured using Ca2+ fluorescence techniques, was still maintained after 1.5 h (maximum tested) of nocodazole treatment (n = 4/5 cells; 1 cell showed no response, data not shown). The above experiments indicate a specific effect of nocodazole, but in our experiments nocodazole might be directly affecting the Cl(Ca) currents and not the underlying Ca2+signal. We addressed this issue in two ways. First, we directly activated the Cl(Ca) current by the infusion of an intracellular solution containing 448 nm free Ca2+ via the whole cell patch pipette. The current-voltage relationships obtained before and after 100 μm nocodazole (Fig. 3, inset, n = 3) showed no difference in amplitude. Second, we combined patch clamp and Ca2+imaging experiments and directly measured the local secretory pole Ca2+ response. Nocodazole (25 μm) reduced the Cl(Ca) current spike amplitude, and this was associated with a reduction in the cytosolic Ca2+ rise time and amplitude (Fig. 4, n = 3). We conclude that nocodazole specifically affects the local Ca2+ spike and not the Cl(Ca) current. These experiments indicate that nocodazole acts on the mechanism of generation of the local secretory pole Ca2+ spike. From the known actions of nocodazole it is implied that its effects are mediated by disruption of the microtubular system. To test this we looked for consistency of action of other agents known to act on microtubules. Colchicine application consistently led to a decrease in spike amplitude (Fig. 5 A,n = 4), and in two cells a decrease in frequency resulted. The effects of colchicine were slower in onset than nocodazole, with observable effects of colchicine on spike amplitude found at around 3 min after drug application. This is probably a reflection of the action of colchicine, which only binds to free tubulin and does not act directly on tubulin polymerized within microtubules (taxol and nocodazole act on polymerized tubulin) (19.Bergen L.G. Borisy G.G. J. Cell. Biochem. 1986; 30: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). A higher concentration of colchicine (200 μm) blocked the spikes (n = 3). A demonstration that these effects were likely to be specific to an action on the microtubular system is shown by the lack of effect of β-lumicolchicine (100 μm; Fig. 5, n = 5), a compound with similar structure to colchicine that has no action on tubulin (20.Salmon E.D. McKeel M. Hays T. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 1066-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Another agent that affects microtubules is taxol. Taxol binds to, and stabilizes, microtubules, and we might therefore expect some effect on the Ca2+ signal. The addition of 10 μm taxol to the bathing solution led to a loss of spiking (Fig.6 A, n = 6). In some cells taxol led to an immediate transient increase in the Cl(Ca) current before abolition of the response (Fig.6 B, n = 3/5). As with the nocodazole effects, after application of taxol, supramaximal concentrations of carbachol were still able to evoke a response (Fig. 6 B,n = 3), indicating the cells were still viable. Furthermore, the current-voltage relationships obtained before and after 10 μm taxol (n = 3, data not shown) application showed no difference in amplitude. Our data are therefore consistent with a role for microtubules in the mechanism of local IP3-dependent Ca2+ release from Ca2+ stores. Although the microtubular network has been described for pancreatic acinar cells (21.Achler C. Filmer D. Merte C. Drenckhahn D. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 22.Marlowe K.J. Farshori P. Torgerson R.R. Anderson K.L. Miller L.J. McNiven M.A. Eur. J.

Histochemistry. 1987; 87: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) from slices of pancreas, it not been shown in the type of isolated cell preparations we used. Therefore, we performed immunolocalization experiments, using an anti-α-tubulin antibody, on isolated cells that were prepared in the same way as for the previous electrophysiological experiments. The results show a complex network of microtubules throughout the cell (Fig.7 A, typical of five preparations). In cells that had been treated with nocodazole for 15 min, the microtubular network was less abundant and showed evidence for truncated tubules, rather than continuous microtubule strands (Fig.7 B, typical results from three preparations). These experiments show that nocodazole does exert significant effects on the microtubular system in our isolated cells. We next explored the possible relationship between the microtubule system and the Ca2+ release apparatus. It is well known that microtubules are associated with the organization of the endoplasmic reticulum, and this action may be the source of the functional effects we observe. We visualized the endoplasmic reticulum distribution with the specific probe, ER-Tracker. As described previously, the endoplasmic reticulum was distributed throughout the cell (24.van de Put F.H.M.M. Elliott A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4999-5006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) but was excluded from the nucleus and the secretory granules (Fig. 8). In control experiments we also studied the distribution of the endoplasmic reticulum resident proteins, calreticulin and BiP, using immunolocalization techniques. Both proteins had a similar apparent cellular distribution to ER-Tracker (data not shown). Two-photon fluorescence imaging methods were used to visualize the endoplasmic reticulum during drug application, using the ER-Tracker dye. We observed changes in the distribution of the endoplasmic reticulum after treatment with nocodazole (100 μm, up to 40 min, n = 7/9 cells; 2 cells showed no apparent change) compared with controls (no drug added, n = 5/6 cells; 1 cell showed small changes in the secretory pole; Fig.9 A). Typically, the changes we observed included movement of the unstained region of the nucleus and decreased staining within the secretory pole region (Fig.9 B).Figure 9Two-photon images of ER-Tracker fluorescence taken from a mid section through an acinar cell cluster. The endoplasmic reticulum is widely distributed throughout the cell but, as expected, fluorescence is excluded from the nucleus and the secretory granules. Under control conditions (A) the pattern of staining did not change when recording over time. In B, control images were obtained at 0 min, after which 100 μmnocodazole was added to the bath. Subsequently images were captured at 5 and 20 min after nocodazole treatment. The pattern of fluorescence was observed to change in the secretory pole region and in the position and shape of the excluded fluorescence in the nuclear region (n = 7/9, with two cells showing no apparent changes).C, the ratio of the mean fluorescence intensity within a 5-μm diameter area in the secretory pole (SP) against a spot of 5-μm diameter in the basal pole (BP) was measured in the same regions over time. Within a single cell, all values were expressed as a percentage of the ratio obtained at time 0. The ratios do not change in control conditions but show a decrease over time in the presence of nocodazole. This decrease is significant (at p < 0.05, Student's t test) at times 10 and 20 min after the addition of nocodazole, compared with controls.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To quantify these fluorescence changes, we measured the average signal intensity in a region within the secretory pole (∼5-μm diameter) and a region in the basal pole (∼5-μm diameter chosen to be away from the nucleus). The ratio of the secretory pole to basal pole signal (SP/BP ratio) was then used as a measure of changes in endoplasmic reticulum distribution. In control conditions we observed no change in the SP/BP ratio over time (Fig. 9 C). After treatment with nocodazole the ratio decreased significantly (p < 0.05 at 10 and 20 min after drug treatment, compared with controls) indicating a reorganization of the endoplasmic reticulum away from the secretory pole. We show agents that act on microtubules have a specific and rapid effect in attenuating IP3-evoked local Ca2+spikes. Responses to supramaximal agonist concentrations were still observed, even after prolonged treatment with nocodazole, indicating that cell function was still retained and that the microtubular cytoskeleton is not critical for these global Ca2+ signals. Microtubular disruption induced a specific decrease of the endoplasmic reticulum in the secretory pole, as visualized by a local loss of ER-Tracker fluorescence. This loss was significant at 10 min after nocodazole treatment, a time course consistent with the effects of nocodazole on the Ca2+ spikes. We conclude that the microtubular network specifically maintains local Ca2+responses possibly by local positioning of the endoplasmic reticulum. There are now a number of recent studies that indicate that the cytoskeleton may play a role in Ca2+ signaling processes. Although the cell type and stimulus and signal responses are diverse in these reports, the common thread is a cytoskeletal involvement in signal compartmentalization. In many cell types, patterns of IP3-evoked Ca2+ release are dependent on local positioning of Ca2+ release apparatus (25.Berridge M.J. J. Physiol. 1997; 499: 291-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). In acinar cells apical to basal pole waves and local Ca2+ signals are due to polar compartmentalization of IP3-dependent stores (6.Lee M.G. Xu X. Zeng W. Diaz J. Wojcikiewicz R.J. Kuo T.H. Wuytack F.

Our work now shows that the functionality of the apical compartment, which generates the local Ca2+ spike, is maintained by the microtubular system. This conclusion is based on the consistency of action of agents that target microtubules. Both nocodazole and taxol bind to polymerized tubulin and, respectively, prevent (26.Samson F. Donoso J.A. Heller-Bettinger I. Watson D. Himes R.H. J. Pharm. Exper. Therap. 1979; 208,(3): 411-417Google Scholar) or stabilize (27.Collins C.A. Vallee R.B. J.

Biochem. 1986; 30: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 29.Vandecandelaere A. Martin S.R. Schilstra M.J. Bayley P.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2792-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and secondarily interferes with microtubule polymerization. The fact that all these agents inhibit local Ca2+ spiking strongly argues for a crucial role of the microtubular system in maintaining the function of Ca2+ release sites within the secretory pole region. If the function of the Ca2+ release apparatus is dependent on microtubules, why do we see effects on the local Ca2+spike and not on the carbachol-induced global Ca2+ signal? We know that the local Ca2+ spike, which we elicited at low IP3 concentrations (just above threshold), is the reflection of multiple sites of Ca2+ release within the apical region that are coordinated together by the action of cytosolic Ca2+ (16.Kidd J.F. Fogarty K.E. Tuft R. Thorn P. J. Physiol. 1999; 520: 187-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Therefore, the architectural arrangement of these release sites within the cell might be an important parameter in the production of the local Ca2+ spike. Microtubules could act to position the release sites, and microtubule reorganization might move the sites far enough apart such that Ca2+ release from one site would not be able to act on an adjacent site to coordinate the signal response via Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release. In contrast, the Ca2+ release elicited by high agonist concentrations reflects a synchronized global response to saturating IP3 concentrations. The precise position of Ca2+ release sites within the cell would therefore be expected to be of less importance. A few studies suggest that microtubules underlie the location of Ca2+ release within a cell (e.g. see Ref. 30.Graier W.F. Paltauf-Doburzynska J. Hill B.J. Fleischhacker E. Hoebel B.G. Kostner G.M.

Previous studies (Houweling, M., Cui, Z., and Vance, D. E. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 16277–16282) showed that expression of wild-type CT-α rescued the cells at 40 °C, whereas expression of phosphatidylethanolamineN-methyltransferase-2 (PEMT2) did not, even though PC levels appeared to be maintained at wild-type levels after 24 h at the restrictive temperature. We report that the failure of PEMT2 to rescue the MT58 cell line is due to inadequate long term PC synthesis. We found that changing the medium every 24 h rescued the PEMT2-expressing MT58 cells grown at 40 °C. This was due to the uptake and utilization of lipids in the serum. At 40 °C, PC levels in the wild-type CHO cells and CT-expressing MT58 cells increased over time whereas PC levels did not change in both the MT58 and PEMT2-expressing MT58 cell lines. Further investigation found that both the PEMT2-expressing MT58 and MT58 cell lines accumulated triacylglycerol at 40 °C. Pulse-chase experiments indicated that lyso-PC accumulated to a higher degree at 40 °C in the PEMT2-expressing MT58 cells compared with CT-expressing MT58 cells. Transfection of the PEMT-expressing MT58 cells with additional PEMT2 cDNA partially rescued the growth of these cells at 40 °C. Inhibition of PC degradation, by inhibitors of phospholipases, also stimulated PEMT-expressing MT58 cell growth at 40 °C. Best results were observed using a calcium-independent phospholipase A2inhibitor, methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate. This inhibitor also increased PC mass in the PEMT2-expressing MT58 cells. When the cells are shifted to 40 °C, PC degradation by enzymes such as phospholipases is greater than PC synthesis in the mutant PEMT2-expressing MT58 cells. Taken together, these results indicate that PEMT2 expression fails to rescue the mutant cell line at 40 °C because it does not maintain PC levels required for cellular replication.

Besides having a structural role in membranes and lipoproteins, PC plays an important role in signal transduction as it is a major source of lipid second messengers (1.Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 26-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). In all nucleated cells, PC is made primarily through the CDP-choline pathway in which the key enzyme is CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CT) (2.Kennedy E.P. Op-den-Kamp J.A.F. Roelofsen B. Wirtz K.W.A. Lipids and Membranes: Past Present and Future. Elsevier Sciences Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1986: 171-206Google Scholar). However, in hepatic cells, an alternative pathway exists utilizing phosphatidylethanolamineN-methyltransferase (PEMT), which converts phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to PC via three sequential methylation events (3.Vance D.E. Ridgway N.D. Prog. Lipid Res. 1988; 22: 61-79Crossref Scopus (201) Google Scholar). There are several reasons why hepatic cells may maintain two pathways for providing PC. One possibility is that PEMT is necessary for the endogenous production of choline, which may have several fates: including biosynthesis of acetylcholine, a source for betaine (4.Zeisel S.H. Blusztajn J.K. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1994; 14: 269-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar) and conversion to PC by the CDP:choline pathway. Other studies have suggested that PEMT-derived PC may be preferentially secreted with lipoproteins (5.Vance J.E. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4486-4491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies with the PEMT knockout mouse indicate that the PEMT gene may have been conserved during evolution, to provide PC when dietary choline levels are insufficient during such times as pregnancy or starvation (6.Walkey C.J., Yu, L. Agellon L.B. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27043-27046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Curiously, previous studies indicated that PC generated via the PEMT pathway did not substitute for PC derived from the CDP:choline pathway in cells that are defective in CT (7.Houweling M. Cui Z. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16277-16282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Esko and co-workers (8.Esko J.D. Wermuth M.M. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7388-7393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) first described the mutant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line, MT58, which has a temperature-sensitive mutation in CT. These cells divide normally at 33 °C, but at 40 °C CT activity is diminished, PC levels are decreased and the cells die via apoptosis (7.Houweling M. Cui Z. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16277-16282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 9.Cui Z. Houweling M. Chen M.H. Record M. Chap H. Vance D.E. Terce F. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 16277-16282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) showed that at the restrictive temperature (40 °C), cDNA encoding CT-α rescued the cells whereas cDNA encoding an isoform of PEMT, PEMT2, did not. This occurred even though PC levels, based upon percentage of total phospholipid, appeared to be restored (7.Houweling M. Cui Z. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16277-16282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These cells provide an excellent system in which to analyze the role of both CDP-choline- and PEMT-derived PC in cellular replication and investigate why PEMT-derived PC does not rescue the mutant cell line. There are several hypotheses as to why PEMT-derived PC does not rescue the mutant cell line, including subcellular location and differences in the molecular species of PC produced by the two pathways. We investigated these and other hypotheses and have determined the rate of PC degradation is greater than the rate of PC synthesis in the PEMT2-expressing MT58 cells grown at 40 °C. Therefore, PEMT2-expressing MT58 cells do not produce enough PC to maintain cellular replication after 24 h at 40 °C Ham's F-12 medium, fetal bovine serum (FBS), and G418 were from Life Technologies, Inc., and culture dishes and flasks were from Beckton Dickinson. Silica gel G60 plates were obtained from Merck. [methyl-3H]Choline chloride, [methyl-3H]methionine, and [1-3H]ethanolamine were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate, manoalide, and D609 were obtained from Calbiochem. l-659989, a platelet-activating factor receptor antagonist, which inhibits phospholipase D, was a generous gift from Merck Frost. Lyso-PC (LPC), alkyl-LPC, and DOTAP were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. All other chemicals and reagents were obtained from standard commercial sources. Wild-type and MT58 cell lines were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. PEMT2-expressing and CT-expressing MT58 cell lines (7.Houweling M. Cui Z. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16277-16282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.3 mg/ml G418. All cells were maintained in 75-mm culture flasks at 5% CO2, 90% relative humidity at 33 °C. For growth curves, cells were plated at 2.5 × 105 in 60-mm dishes containing 4 ml of medium and incubated at the indicated temperature. At the indicated times, culture medium was removed, the adherent cells were harvested with trypsin and viable cells that excluded trypan blue were counted. Where indicated, cells were also grown in the presence of delipidated FBS or phospholipase inhibitors. PEMT-expressing MT58 cells were plated at 2 × 105 cells/60-mm dish and grown overnight. Transfection with the PEMT2 expression vector or the empty vector (7.Houweling M. Cui Z. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16277-16282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) was performed the next day via a DOTAP transfection method (10.Holmen S.I. Vanbrocklin M.W. Eversole R.R. Stapleton S.R. Ginsberg L.C. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 30: 347-351Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). DOTAP was dried under vacuum and resuspended in sterile water to a concentration of 1 mg/ml. 15 μl of the DOTAP solution and 0.5 μg of DNA were incubated at room temperature with serum-free medium (final volume, 250 μl) for 20 min. During this time, the dishes were washed with serum-free medium and 3 ml of serum-free medium was added to each dish. The liposome-DNA suspension was then added dropwise to the dishes (10.Holmen S.I.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 147-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). After 4 h, the medium was removed and replaced with growth medium and the cells were grown at 40 °C. At the indicated times, the culture medium was removed, the adherent cells were harvested with trypsin, and viable cells that excluded trypan blue were counted. Forin vivo PEMT activity analysis, PEMT2-expressing MT58 cells were grown to 40% confluence and then shifted to 40 °C. At the indicated times, cells were labeled with [3H]methionine (5 μCi/dish) for 2 h and then harvested in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as described below. For ethanolamine, oleate, and choline labeling experiments, cells were first incubated with the appropriate radiolabel ([3H]oleate, [3H]ethanolamine or [3H] choline, respectively) at 5 μCi/dish at 33 °C for 24 h. The medium was removed from the cells, fresh medium was added, and the cells were incubated at 40 °C. At the indicated times, cells were washed three times with cold PBS and harvested in 10 ml of PBS. The cells were pelleted by low speed centrifugation, resuspended in PBS, and sonicated. Lipids were extracted as described by Sundler and co-workers (12.Sundler R. Akesson B. Nilsson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5102-5107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and separated by thin layer chromatography (TLC) on Silica gel G60 plates as described below. For analysis of lyso-PC (LPC), phospholipids were separated with chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/formic acid/water (70:30:12:4:1) as a developing solvent. After TLC, LPC was visualized by iodine vapor and the radiolabel incorporated into the bands of interest was measured by liquid scintillation counting after being scraped off the plate. Cells were cultured and harvested as described above except radiolabeled precursors were omitted. Lipids from 0.5 mg of protein were extracted as described previously. For analysis of PC, phospholipids were separated using TLC with chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/formic acid/water (70:30:12:4:1) as a developing solvent. For TG analysis, TLC using heptane/diisopropyl ether/acetic acid (60:40:4) as the developing solvent separated neutral lipids. After TLC, and visualization with iodine vapor, the bands of interest were scraped and analyzed. PC mass was determined by measuring the phosphorous content (13.Rouser G. Siakatos A.N. Fleischer S. Lipids. 1966; 1: 85-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar), and TG mass was determined by the hydroxylamine method described by Snyder and Stephens (14.Synder F. Stephens N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1959; 34: 244-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the Coomassie Plus protein protocol from Pierce, which is based on the Bradford method (15.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217547) Google Scholar). Bovine serum albumin was used as a standard. We investigated, without success, a variety of hypotheses as to why PEMT-derived PC does not rescue the mutant cell line. First, we analyzed the contribution of the PEMT pathway and CDP-choline pathway in generating nuclear PC. Using radiolabeling studies, we found that the percent of PC levels derived from the PEMT pathway or the CDP-choline pathway was similar in PEMT2-expressing MT58 and CT-expressing MT58 cells (3.1% and 3.3% of total choline containing phospholipids, respectively). Next, we determined if there were any alterations in downstream signaling by PC derived second messengers in PEMT-expressing MT58 cells compared with wild-type and CT-expressing MT58 cells. We observed no differences in levels of protein phosphorylation, particularly tyrosine phosphorylation and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. Differences in the molecular composition of the PC species from the two pathways were also examined. Using gas chromatography, we found negligible differences in the fatty acid composition of PC derived from the PEMT-expressing MT58 cells compared with PC derived from CT-expressing MT58 cells grown at 40 °C (data not shown). Furthermore, we found that alkyl-LPC could rescue the PEMT-expressing MT58 cells grown at 40 °C (22 ± 5 × 105cells/dish for PEMT-expressing MT58 cells; 32 ± 6 × 105 for wild-type cells after 96 h, n= 6). These data suggest that potential differences in the molecular composition of PC created by the PEMT pathway are not the reason why PEMT2 does not rescue MT58 cells. In the process of performing the above experiments, we observed that the PEMT2-expressing MT58 cells could be rescued at 40 °C simply by changing the growth medium every 24 h. Fig.1 shows that at 40 °C the PEMT2-expressing MT58 cells divide once and then fail to replicate as described earlier (7.Houweling M. Cui Z. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16277-16282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). When the medium was replaced every 24 h with medium containing serum, the PEMT2-expressing MT58 cells had a growth rate comparable to those cells grown at 33 °C as well as wild-type cells grown at 40 °C (32 ± 6 × 105wild-type cells/dish after 96 h, n = 6). This was not due to the cellular uptake and utilization of serine, ethanolamine, or methionine, precursors to PE that could then be methylated to PC, since supplementing the medium with these compounds every 24 h did not rescue the cells (data not shown). Subsequently, we incubated PEMT-expressing MT58 cells with medium containing delipidated serum at 40 °C (Fig.2). Fig. 2 A shows that PEMT2-expressing MT58 cells failed to undergo replication when grown at 40 °C with medium containing delipidated serum, even when the medium was changed every 24 h. This was not due to the loss of a growth factor during the delipidation process, as medium containing delipidated serum did not retard the growth of the PEMT2-expressing MT58 cells at 33 °C (Fig. 2 B). When the delipidated serum was supplemented with either LPC or lyso-platelet-activating factor (alkyl-LPC), we found that PEMT2-expressing MT58 cells divided at the restrictive temperature yielding 20 × 105 and 22 × 105 cells/dish at 96 h, respectively (n = 2). Taken together, these data suggested that PC levels might not be sufficient in the PEMT2-expressing MT58 cells for continued growth at 40 °C. Based on the above data, we next measured PC levels in four CHO cell lines: wild-type, MT58, CT-expressing MT58, and PEMT2-expressing MT58 cells (7.Houweling M. Cui Z. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16277-16282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). At 33 °C in all four cell lines, PC content varied little over 72 h (∼70 nmol of PC/mg of protein). When the cells were shifted to 40 °C, we found that the wild-type and CT-expressing MT58 cells increased their PC content by 2- and 1.7-fold, respectively, over 72 h (Fig.3 A). In contrast, MT58 cells did not have an increase in PC content once shifted to the restrictive temperature, as previously reported (7.Houweling M. Cui Z. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16277-16282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 8.Esko J.D. Wermuth M.M. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7388-7393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Initially, PC levels in the PEMT2-expressing cell lines were maintained at 24 h. However, the PEMT2-expressing MT58 cells also did not have an increase in PC over time (Fig. 3 A, triangles) when compared with the wild-type and CT-expressing cell lines. Possible explanations for the lack of increase in PC levels once the cells were shifted to the restrictive temperature were either that the PEMT2 enzyme was no longer functional or that less PEMT2 was present at the restrictive temperature. We found that there was no change in the amount of immunoreactive PEMT2 after 72 h at 40 °C (data not shown). Therefore, decreased amounts of the protein did not account for the lack of PC. We next determined if the PEMT2 protein was active at 40 °C over the 72-h time course. Fig.3 B shows that the incorporation of radiolabeled methionine into PC occurs at 40 °C, indicating PEMT activity. In fact, at 40 °C, methionine incorporation is severalfold higher than at 33 °C. Therefore, the PEMT2 protein is still functional after 72 h at 40 °C. When analyzing the PC content in the above experiments, we noticed that there was a prominent band during TLC in the neutral lipids from PEMT2-expressing MT58 cells and MT58 cells at 40 °C. Upon further investigation, we determined that this was due to TG accumulation. Fig. 4 shows that, at 40 °C, TG accumulated in wild-type and CT-expressing MT58 cells, 3.7- and 3.8-fold, respectively. This accumulation, however, was similar to the levels of all four cell lines grown at 33 °C (Fig.4). In contrast, at 40 °C there was a much greater increase in TG accumulation in both the mutant and PEMT2-expressing MT58 cells, 10- and 16-fold increase, respectively (Fig. 4). At 40 °C, the PEMT2-expressing MT58 cells accumulated approximately 1.6-fold more TG than MT58 cells after 72 h (compare closed triangles to closed diamonds). Recently, studies have shown that phospholipase A2 plays a role in regulating cellular PC levels (16.Barbour S.E. Kapur A. Deal C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 17.Jackowski S. Wang J. Baburina I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1483: 310-315Google Scholar). Based on these studies, we analyzed the LPC levels in both PEMT2-expressing MT58 cells and CT-expressing MT58 cells. PEMT2-expressing MT58 cells were labeled with [3H]ethanolamine, which would be expected to result in labeled PC by methylation of PE by PEMT. CT-expressing MT58 cells were labeled with [3H]choline. After 24 h at 40 °C, labeled LPC levels were 2-fold higher in PEMT2-expressing MT58 cells compared with the CT-expressing MT58 cells, and they remained 1.5–2-fold higher over 72 h at 40 °C. On the basis of this result, we hypothesized that at 40 °C the rate of PC synthesis was less than the rate of PC degradation in the PEMT2-expressing and MT58 cells when compared with the wild-type and CT-expressing MT58 cells. If this were indeed the case, we hypothesized that PEMT2-expressing MT58 cells may be rescued by stimulating PC synthesis or by inhibiting PC degradation. We attempted to increase PC synthesis in the PEMT-expressing MT58 cells, at 40 °C, by transfecting these cells with additional PEMT2 cDNA. Fig.5 shows that transient transfection of 0.5 μg of PEMT2 containing vector increased PEMT2-expressing MT58 cell growth at 40 °C compared with empty vector-transfected controls. Transfection with additional PEMT2 cDNA increased the number of cells per dish at 72 h after transfection compared with control cells, 11 × 105 and 3.4 × 105 cell/dish, respectively (Fig. 5). This result suggested that, by shifting the synthesis/degradation equilibrium in favor of PC synthesis, PEMT2-expressing MT58 cells were able to replicate at 40 °C. We next determined if inhibition of PC degradation would rescue the PEMT2-expressing MT58 cells using four phospholipase inhibitors. D609 is a PC phospholipase C inhibitor that has also been shown to inhibit phospholipase D (18.Gratas C. Powis G. Anticancer Res. 1993; 13: 1239-1244PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Cobb R.R. Felts K.A. Parry G.C. Mackman N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 998-1004PubMed Google Scholar). Manoalide and MAFP are phospholipase A2 inhibitors (20.Soriente A. DeRosa M.M.C. Scettri A. Sodano G. Terencio M.C. Paya M. Alcaraz M.J. Curr. Med. Chem. 1999; 6: 415-431PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Grange E. Rabin O. Bell J. Chang M.C. Neurochem.

Acta. 1996; 1302: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and L-659989 (Merck Frost) is a platelet-activating factor receptor antagonist that has been shown to inhibit phospholipase D (23.Gomez-Munoz A. O'Brien L. Steinbrecher U.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We achieved the best results with these inhibitors when added once, after the cells had been grown at 40 °C for 24 h. Further additions of the drugs resulted in increased cell death (data not shown). Fig. 6 shows that the addition of these phospholipase inhibitors rescued the PEMT2-expressing MT58 cells to various degrees with the most effective being 300 nmMAFP, the calcium-independent phospholipase A2 inhibitor (22.Lio Y.C. Reynolds L.J. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The addition of MAFP, at 24 h, rescued PEMT2-expressing MT58 cells by about 50% at 48 and 72 h. Fig.7 shows that MAFP treatment also increased the cellular level of PC at 48 and 72 h. Although PC levels were not restored to the same levels as wild-type cells grown at 40 °C (94 ± 6 and 113 ± 6 nmol/mg protein at 48 and 72 h, respectively), the levels were comparable to PC levels in PEMT2-expressing MT58 cells levels grown at 33 °C (75 ± 6 and 69 ± 7 nmol/mg protein at 48 and 72 h, respectively).Figure 7MAFP treatment maintains PC levels in PEMT2-expressing MT58 cells at 40 °C. PEMT2-expressing MT58 cells were grown on 100-mm dishes at 40 °C. After 24 h, 300 nm MAFP was added to some dishes. At the indicated times, the cells were harvested and subjected to lipid extraction followed by TLC to separate PC. Phosphorous content was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Shown are the means ± S.E. of three individual experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Taken together, the data suggest that the reason PEMT2 does not rescue the MT58 cell line at 40 °C is that these cells simply do not produce enough PC for cellular replication at 40 °C. When the cells are shifted to 40 °C, PC degradation by enzymes such as phospholipases is greater than PC synthesis in the mutant and PEMT2-expressing MT58 cells. Hence, there is not enough PC produced for cellular replication and the cells undergo apoptosis (9.Cui Z. Houweling M. Chen M.H. Record M. Chap H. Vance D.E. Terce F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14668-14671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). We have investigated why expression of PEMT2 does not rescue the CT mutant CHO cell line, MT58 at 40 °C. The most obvious hypotheses at the time were: 1) that PC derived from the PEMT-pathway was not nuclear whereas PC synthesis from CDP-choline was, and 2) that the two pathways were producing different molecular species of PC. We found that neither of these was the case. First, we found that there was no difference in the synthesis of nuclear of PC between PEMT2-expressing MT58 cells and CT-expressing MT58 cells. This suggested that differences in the subcellular localization of PC did not account for why PEMT2 could not rescue the mutant cell line. This conclusion was supported by the recent discovery of a second isoform of CT, CT-β1 (24.Lykidis A. Murti K.G. Jackowski S. J. Biol.

CT-β1 does not contain the nuclear targeting sequence and has been found to associate with the endoplasmic reticulum. Transfection with the cDNA for CT-β1 rescues the MT58 cell line at 40 °C (25.Lykidis A. Baburina I. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26992-27001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Second, we found that alkyl-LPC as well as acyl-LPC rescued the MT58 cells, indicating that the sn-1 linkage in PC was not critical for cellular replication and homeostasis. DeLong and co-workers (26.DeLong C.J. Shen Y.-J. Thomas M.J. Cui Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29683-29688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) found, using McA-RH7777 cells transfected with PEMT2 cDNA, that the molecular species of PEMT-derived PC was more diverse and contained a higher percentage of arachidonate than did PC derived from the CDP-choline pathway. However, we found no major differences in the fatty acid composition of PC, by gas chromatography analysis, between CT-expressing and PEMT2-expressing MT58 cells grown at 40 °C after 48 or 72 h. We selected these time points for our study as these are the times when the PEMT2-expressing MT58 cells failed to proliferate. These apparently conflicting results may be due to lipid remodeling occurring in the McA-RH7777 cells. We now provide evidence that expression of PEMT2 does not rescue the MT58 cells simply because not enough PC is produced after 24 h. Four lines of evidence support this conclusion. 1) Medium containing delipidated serum failed to rescue PEMT2-expressing MT58 cells at 40 °C, whereas medium containing lipids did. 2) PC levels did not increase in PEMT2-expressing MT58 cells at 40 °C, whereas PC levels increased in wild-type and CT-expressing MT58 cells. 3) Increased expression of PEMT2 by transient transfection enhanced the growth of PEMT2-expressing MT58 cells at 40 °C. 4) Inhibition of phospholipases allowed these cells to replicate at 40 °C. We found that, at 40 °C, the PC content of wild-type and CT-expressing MT58 cells increased (Fig. 3 A). Although this was not totally unexpected, as the laws of thermodynamics would dictate that enzymatic rates increase due to the change in temperature from 33 °C to 40 °C, we did not anticipate such an increase in PC mass. Several groups have reported that PC mass does not increase even when CT activity increases (16.Barbour S.E. Kapur A. Deal C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 27.Walkey C.J. Kalmar G.B. Cornell R.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 5742-5749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were the first to show that overexpression of CT activity by transfection of the CT cDNA into COS cells increases the synthesis of PC, but not the mass of PC. This phenomenon was also observed in the CT-expressing MT58 cells when grown at 33 °C (7.Houweling M. Cui Z. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16277-16282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The wild-type and CT-expressing MT58 cells do not exhibit an altered morphology at 40 °C, as one might expect with such an increase in PC mass. In contrast, PC levels did not increase in the PEMT2-expressing MT58 cells (Fig. 3 A). It was first reported that PC levels, based on percentage of total phospholipids, are maintained in the PEMT2-expressing MT58 cells (7.Houweling M. Cui Z. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16277-16282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and that on that basis the level of PC in the PEMT-expressing MT58 cells is the same as the wild-type cells grown at 40 °C for 24 h. The current analysis, however, is based upon mass PC per milligram of protein and analyzes changes after 24 h. We were especially interested in time points after 24 h, when the difference between the growth curves of the PEMT2-expressing MT58 cells and wild-type cells was more pronounced. We found that the difference in PC levels between the PEMT2-expressing MT58 cells and wild-type or CT-expressing MT58 cells is also more pronounced after growth at 40 °C for 48 and 72 h (Fig.3 A). We considered the possibility that PEMT2 may not be produced or active in PEMT2-expressing MT58 cells grown at 40 °C for over 24 h. However, active PEMT2 was present in cells grown at 40 °C for at least 72 h (Fig. 3 B). In fact, the level of PEMT activity at 40 °C was higher than the activity at 33 °C (Fig. 3 B), consistent with thermodynamic predictions. We found that products of further PC metabolism, such as TG and LPC, accumulated in PEMT2-expressing MT58 cells compared with wild-type cells grown at 40 °C (Fig. 4 and this report). Recently, Jackowski and co-workers have shown that TG levels increase in the MT58 cells due to the diversion of newly synthesized diacylglycerol to the TG pool (17.Jackowski S. Wang J. Baburina I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1483: 310-315Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, we too see these results. However, some of the TG accumulated at 40 °C may also result from PC degradation. We found that the accumulation of TG was greater in the PEMT2-expressing MT58 cells compared with MT58 cells. This increased accumulation in the PEMT2-expressing MT58 cells is probably due to increased synthesis of PC and its subsequent catabolism, compared with the MT58 cells. Enhanced catabolism of PC is indicated, since LPC levels were higher in PEMT2-expressing MT58 cells compared with CT-expressing MT58 cells. Based on the above results, we postulate that at 40 °C, the rate of PC synthesis is greater than or equal to the rate of PC degradation in wild-type and CT-expressing MT58 cells and that in MT58 and PEMT2-expressing MT58 cells grown at 40 °C the rate of PC synthesis is less than or equal to the rate of PC degradation. If this hypothesis were true, we should therefore be able to rescue, at least partially, the PEMT2-expressing MT58 cells if the equilibrium between synthesis and degradation was shifted in the direction of synthesis. By transfecting the PEMT2-expressing MT58 cells with additional amounts of PEMT2 cDNA, the number of viable cells increased at 40 °C, presumably due to increased synthesis of PC (Fig. 5). In our attempts to modulate the rate of PC degradation, we showed that several phospholipase inhibitors increased the growth of PEMT-expressing MT58 cells to varying degrees (Fig. 6). As expected, based upon the reports of others (16.Barbour S.E. Kapur A. Deal C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 28.Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J.

Reynolds L.J. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and manoalide (20.Soriente A. DeRosa M.M.C. Scettri A. Sodano G.

Res. 1998; 23: 1251-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Cell growth was not completely rescued at 40 °C, as high levels of MAFP were cytotoxic, even at 33 °C. Treatment with MAFP also increased PC levels in the PEMT-expressing MT58 cells grown at 40 °C (Fig. 7). These inhibitors did not partially rescue MT58 cells, as we would expect since these cells contain no active PC-producing pathway at the restrictive temperature. Taken together, we have shown that the reason why PEMT2 does not rescue growth of the MT58 cells at 40 °C is that insufficient PC is produced after 24 h. At 40 °C, the rate of PC degradation is greater than the rate of PC synthesis in the MT58 and PEMT2-expressing MT58 cells. It remains to be seen if PEMT-derived PC has a specialized role in the whole animal, particularly the liver. The generation of the PEMT null mouse (31.Walkey C.J. Donohue L.R. Bronson R. Agellon L.B.

Studies to address this question are currently under way and should prove to increase our knowledge on the roles of PC. Nonetheless, the data shown here suggest that in cell culture, PEMT-derived PC can substitute for PC made by the CDP-choline pathway in maintaining cellular homeostasis and further indicates the importance of PC for cellular replication.

The carboxyl tail was extremely reactive in yeast two-hybrid library screens, with the reactivity residing in amino acids 1621–1647 and abolished by a point mutation (V1642D). Dysgenic myotubes were injected with cDNA encoding green fluorescent protein fused to the amino terminus of DHPRs truncated after either residue 1620 (Δ1621–1873) or residue 1542 (Δ1543–1873) or of full-length DHPRs with the V1642D mutation (V1642D). For either Δ1621–1873 or V1642D, the restoration of excitation-contraction coupling was reduced ∼40%, and the number of functional DHPRs in the sarcolemma was reduced ∼30%, compared with the wild-type DHPR. The restoration of excitation-contraction coupling and surface expression was more drastically reduced (by ∼90 and ∼55%, respectively) for Δ1543–1873. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that Δ1621–1873 and V1642D were concentrated in a longitudinally restricted region near the injected nucleus, whereas wild-type DHPRs were present relatively uniformly along the length of a myotube. The intensity of fluorescence was greatly reduced for Δ1543–1873, indicating a low level of protein expression. Thus, residues 1543–1647 appear to play a role in the biosynthetic processing, transport, and/or anchoring of DHPRs, with residues 1543–1620 being particularly important for expression.

This process, termed excitation-contraction (EC)1 coupling, involves a functional interaction between dihydropyridine receptors (DHPRs), voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels in the sarcolemma, and ryanodine receptors (RyRs), intracellular Ca2+ release channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane. The interaction between DHPRs and RyRs occurs at specialized junctions between the sarcolemmal and sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes and thus requires that both proteins be targeted to and anchored at the junctions. However, the mechanisms for targeting and anchoring are not understood. Although the two proteins may interact with one another directly, other molecular interactions must also be involved because RyRs target to junctions in dysgenic muscle cells (1Powell J. Petherbridge L. Flucher B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 375-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), which lack DHPRs (2Knudson C.M. Chaudhari N. Sharp A.H. Powell J.A. Beam K.G. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1345-1348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and DHPRs target to junctions in dyspedic muscle cells, which lack RyRs (3Takekura H. Nishi M. Noda T. Takeshima H. Franzini-Armstrong C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar,4Takekura H. Franzini-Armstrong C. Dev. Dyn. 1999; 214: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).The targeting of the DHPR seems likely to depend on structures within the α1S subunit, because GFP-tagged α1subunits show a very different subcellular distribution in dysgenic myotubes depending on whether they are the neuronal or muscle type (5Grabner M. Dirksen R.T. Beam K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1903-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Furthermore, for several members of the voltage-gated ion channel superfamily (to which α1S belongs), recent data suggest that the carboxyl tail is involved in subcellular localization, often via interactions with other cellular proteins. For instance, interactions of the carboxyl tail with cytoplasmic proteins have been implicated in the subcellular localization and clustering of Shaker potassium channels (6Kim E. Martin N. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar), Na+ channels (7Gee S.H. Madhavan R. Levinson S.R. Caldwell J.H. Sealock R. Froehner S.C. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 128-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Trp Ca2+ channels (8Shieh B.H. Zhu M.Y. Neuron. 1996; 16: 991-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Because the carboxyl tails are the largest and most highly divergent of the cytoplasmic domains of Ca2+ channel α1 subunits (9Fujita Y. Mynlieff M. Dirksen R.T. Kim M.S. Niidome T. Nakai J. Friedrich T. Iwabe N. Miyata T. Furuichi T. Furutama D. Mikoshiba Mori Y. Beam K.G. Neuron. 1993; 10: 585-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), it seems reasonable that they might play a similar role in isoform-dependent channel targeting. As encoded by the mRNA found in skeletal muscle, the carboxyl tail of α1S comprises residues 1393–1873. However, residues beyond 1662 are unlikely to play an important role in the anchoring of the mature protein because the predominant form of α1S in mature skeletal muscle is truncated at a site between amino acids 1685 and 1699 (10De Jongh K.S. Warner C. Colvin A.A. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10778-10782Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and because an α1S truncated just after residue 1662 and expressed in dysgenic myotubes functions normally as both calcium channel and voltage sensor for EC coupling (11Beam K.G. Adams B.A. Niidome T. Numa S. Tanabe T. Nature. 1992; 360: 169-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The ∼160 residues just beyond IVS6 (up to and including residue 1542 in α1S) are also unlikely to be involved in isoform specific targeting, since they are well conserved between the high voltage-gated α1 isoforms (9Fujita Y. Mynlieff M. Dirksen R.T. Kim M.S. Niidome T. Nakai J. Friedrich T. Iwabe N. Miyata T. Furuichi T. Furutama D. Mikoshiba Mori Y. Beam K.G. Neuron. 1993; 10: 585-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Thus, residues 1543–1662 appear to be a good candidate to contain domains critical for the targeting of α1S.In order to identify domains of the carboxyl tail that might be important for the expression and targeting of DHPRs and to determine whether these domains interact with other muscle proteins, we have used the yeast two-hybrid method and electrophysiological assays of truncated and mutated DHPRs. The two-hybrid approach revealed that the carboxyl tail of α1S is highly reactive in screens of a skeletal muscle cDNA library and that this reactivity resides in a small region (residues 1621–1647) near the end of the truncated form of the mature channel. The reactivity of the carboxyl tail was abolished by a valine to aspartate point mutation in a consensus PDZ-binding motif that is located within the reactive region. Expression of DHPRs in dysgenic myotubes showed that either truncation or mutation of the carboxyl tail resulted in a decreased efficiency for restoration of EC coupling, a reduction of functional DHPRs expressed in the sarcolemma, and a reduced expression of DHPRs at sites longitudinally distant from the nucleus injected with cDNA. Taken together, these results suggest that residues 1543–1662 are important in the expression of functional DHPRs in the sarcolemma, perhaps as a consequence of interaction with other proteins.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have shown that the carboxyl tail of α1S is highly reactive in yeast two-hybrid screens of a skeletal muscle cDNA library, that this reactivity resides in residues 1621–1647, and that the reactivity is abolished by the V1642D point mutation. In functional assays, we have shown that introduction of the V1642D mutation into the full-length DHPR or truncation after residue 1620 (just before the reactive region) reduces the fraction of dysgenic myotubes with restored EC coupling and lowersQ max, suggesting a decreased surface expression of the altered DHPRs. Truncation of an additional 79 residues (after residue 1542) results in a much larger reduction in the restoration of EC coupling and in Q max. Compared with myotubes expressing GFP-α1S, the green fluorescence in cells expressing Δ1621–1873 or V1642D is more longitudinally restricted (suggestive of altered targeting). Consistent with the large reduction in Q max, cells expressing Δ1543–1873 have substantially reduced fluorescence intensity (indicative of greatly diminished expression).The ratio of G max (maximal Ca2+conductance) to Q′max (maximal charge after correction for dysgenic charge) provides an indirect estimate of the product of P o (open probability) and γ (single channel conductance) of the DHPR Ca2+ channel (15Adams B.A. Tanabe T. Mikami A. Numa S. Beam K.G. Nature. 1990; 346: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the G max/Q′max ratio is lower for GFP-α1S than previously reported (20Grabner M. Dirksen R.T. Suda N. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21913-21919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). A possible explanation is that the previous measurements were made 48–72 h after cDNA injection, whereas the measurements reported here were obtained 24 h after injection. Analysis at 24 h was chosen because it is relatively early with respect to the appearance of the expressed proteins in the sarcolemma and would thus be expected to emphasize differences in targeting. However, it is possible that at 24 h fewer DHPRs were associated with RyRs than at 48–72 h. Such a difference in association would be significant because previous work (19Nakai J. Dirksen R.T. Nguyen H.T. Pessah I.N. Beam K.G. Allen P.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 20Grabner M. Dirksen R.T. Suda N. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21913-21919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) has shown that the G max/Q′max ratio is higher for DHPRs that are functionally associated with RyRs than for DHPRs that are not functionally associated. Truncations of the carboxyl tail could affect the G max/Q′max ratio independently of effects on targeting, because it has been shown that removal of the final 439 residues from the carboxyl tail of α1C (the pore-forming subunit of the cardiac DHPR) causes an increase in the G max/Q max measured after expression in Xenopus oocytes (21Wei X. Neely A. Lacerda A.E. Olcese R. Stefani E. Perez-Reyes E. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1635-1640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Why Does the Carboxyl Tail Have Such High Yeast Reactivity?In library screens with the carboxyl tail, thousands of HIS3-positive colonies were consistently observed. However, there was no activation of the HIS3 reporter gene when the carboxyl tail was present either alone or in combination with the empty activation domain plasmid. Therefore, the reporter gene activation requires the participation of proteins encoded by the cDNA library, which is consistent with a number of alternative explanations. One possibility is that the majority of positive colonies reflect bona fide physiological associations of the carboxyl tail with proteins that are abundantly expressed in the skeletal muscle cDNA library. An argument against this interpretation is that no consistent sequence was identified in inserts isolated from 28 interacting colonies. Thus, if there are direct, physical associations between the carboxyl tail and proteins of the library, then these associations must be very promiscuous (whether or not there are protein interactions that occur in vivo).Instead of directly associating with other muscle proteins, residues 1621–1647 of the DHPR carboxyl tail could interact in a relatively specific manner with a single domain found in one or more abundant, endogenous yeast proteins, which, in turn, could associate with proteins encoded by the skeletal muscle cDNA library, a variant of the yeast three-hybrid system. The importance of the consensus PDZ binding motif in the high reactivity is consistent with, but not limited to, the hypothesis that the endogenous yeast protein(s) contains a PDZ domain. Such an interaction of the DHPR carboxyl tail with a multivalent, PDZ domain-containing yeast protein would thus involve hundreds of skeletal muscle proteins in higher order interactions, resulting in the observed diversity of sequenced interactors and obscuring any possible physiological interactions. A requirement for such higher order interactors is that they not result in a large separation of the two domains of the GAL4 transcription factor. However, the tertiary structure of proteins in a large complex could well allow the activation and binding domains of GAL4 to be spatially close to one another even if they are linked by one or more intermediate proteins. Whether or not physiological associations between the carboxyl tail and muscle library proteins are responsible for the high yeast reactivity, this reactivity appears to have identified a region that influences the function of DHPRs in muscle cells.Could the Carboxyl Tail Play a Role in DHPR Targeting?Because both yeast two-hybrid reactivity and DHPR surface expression are influenced by a domain that contains a consensus PDZ binding motif ((S/T)XV), it is tempting to speculate that interaction of the DHPR carboxyl tail with a PDZ protein is important for expression of functional DHPRs. Interactions with PDZ proteins have been implicated in the localization of other ion channels, including NMDA receptors (22Kornau H.-C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1995; 269: 1737-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar) and Shaker K+channels (6Kim E. Martin N. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). Although both of these channels have a PDZ binding motif at the very end of the carboxyl tail, the Trp Ca2+ channel in Drosophila photoreceptors interacts with the PDZ scaffolding protein INAD via a PDZ binding domain 19 residues from the carboxyl terminus (8Shieh B.H. Zhu M.Y. Neuron. 1996; 16: 991-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). There is an even greater distance between the PDZ binding motif (1640–1642) and the terminal residue (1873) of the DHPR that is encoded by the mRNA present in skeletal muscle. However, the predominant form of the DHPR in adult skeletal muscle, which is thought to arise by post-translational proteolytic cleavage, terminates somewhere between residues 1685 and 1699 (10De Jongh K.S. Warner C. Colvin A.A. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10778-10782Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). It is possible that one function of the post-translational truncation of the DHPR is to expose a protein interaction domain.Although both Δ1621–1873 and V1642D have a diminished ability to restore EC coupling, as well as reduced surface expression and altered subcellular distribution, the yeast two-hybrid reactive region (residues 1621–1647) cannot be solely responsible for controlling surface expression/targeting of the DHPR, because both constructs retain appreciable levels of function. Thus, one or more additional regions of the DHPR (which are upstream from residue 1621) must also be involved. The domain encompassing residues 1543–1620 is a candidate both because it is just downstream from the region of the carboxyl tail that is highly conserved among calcium channel isoforms and because removal of this region caused a large reduction in restoration of EC coupling and surface expression compared with Δ1621–1873. It should be noted that cells expressing Δ1543–1873 did not display any obvious retention of fluorescence in the Golgi apparatus. Thus, if the primary effect of removing residues 1543–1620 was to prevent targeting, then this mistargeting must have resulted in rapid breakdown of the protein. Alternatively, the removal of these residues might have caused rapid breakdown as a consequence of misfolding. To resolve these alternatives, it may be useful in the future to complement the loss-of-function approach employed here with gain-of-function approaches. For example, previous work showed that neuronal α1 subunits do not target to sarcolemmal-sarcoplasmic reticulum junctions (5Grabner M. Dirksen R.T. Beam K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1903-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Thus, it would be valuable to determine if targeting to junctions would occur for a neuronal α1subunit carrying residues from the α1S carboxyl tail. In skeletal muscle cells, electrical excitation of the sarcolemma causes Ca2+ to be released from intracellular stores within the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which in turn causes contraction. This process, termed excitation-contraction (EC)1 coupling, involves a functional interaction between dihydropyridine receptors (DHPRs), voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels in the sarcolemma, and ryanodine receptors (RyRs), intracellular Ca2+ release channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane. The interaction between DHPRs and RyRs occurs at specialized junctions between the sarcolemmal and sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes and thus requires that both proteins be targeted to and anchored at the junctions. However, the mechanisms for targeting and anchoring are not understood. Although the two proteins may interact with one another directly, other molecular interactions must also be involved because RyRs target to junctions in dysgenic muscle cells (1Powell J. Petherbridge L. Flucher B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 375-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), which lack DHPRs (2Knudson C.M. Chaudhari N. Sharp A.H. Powell J.A. Beam K.G. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1345-1348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and DHPRs target to junctions in dyspedic muscle cells, which lack RyRs (3Takekura H. Nishi M. Noda T. Takeshima H. Franzini-Armstrong C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar,4Takekura H. Franzini-Armstrong C. Dev. Dyn. 1999; 214: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The targeting of the DHPR seems likely to depend on structures within the α1S subunit, because GFP-tagged α1subunits show a very different subcellular distribution in dysgenic myotubes depending on whether they are the neuronal or muscle type (5Grabner M. Dirksen R.T. Beam K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1903-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Furthermore, for several members of the voltage-gated ion channel superfamily (to which α1S belongs), recent data suggest that the carboxyl tail is involved in subcellular localization, often via interactions with other cellular proteins. For instance, interactions of the carboxyl tail with cytoplasmic proteins have been implicated in the subcellular localization and clustering of Shaker potassium channels (6Kim E. Martin N. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar), Na+ channels (7Gee S.H. Madhavan R. Levinson S.R. Caldwell J.H. Sealock R. Froehner S.C. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 128-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Trp Ca2+ channels (8Shieh B.H. Zhu M.Y. Neuron. 1996; 16: 991-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Because the carboxyl tails are the largest and most highly divergent of the cytoplasmic domains of Ca2+ channel α1 subunits (9Fujita Y. Mynlieff M. Dirksen R.T. Kim M.S. Niidome T. Nakai J. Friedrich T. Iwabe N. Miyata T. Furuichi T. Furutama D. Mikoshiba Mori Y. Beam K.G. Neuron. 1993; 10: 585-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), it seems reasonable that they might play a similar role in isoform-dependent channel targeting. As encoded by the mRNA found in skeletal muscle, the carboxyl tail of α1S comprises residues 1393–1873. However, residues beyond 1662 are unlikely to play an important role in the anchoring of the mature protein because the predominant form of α1S in mature skeletal muscle is truncated at a site between amino acids 1685 and 1699 (10De Jongh K.S. Warner C. Colvin A.A. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10778-10782Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and because an α1S truncated just after residue 1662 and expressed in dysgenic myotubes functions normally as both calcium channel and voltage sensor for EC coupling (11Beam K.G. Adams B.A. Niidome T. Numa S. Tanabe T. Nature. 1992; 360: 169-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The ∼160 residues just beyond IVS6 (up to and including residue 1542 in α1S) are also unlikely to be involved in isoform specific targeting, since they are well conserved between the high voltage-gated α1 isoforms (9Fujita Y. Mynlieff M. Dirksen R.T. Kim M.S. Niidome T. Nakai J. Friedrich T. Iwabe N. Miyata T. Furuichi T. Furutama D. Mikoshiba Mori Y. Beam K.G. Neuron. 1993; 10: 585-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Thus, residues 1543–1662 appear to be a good candidate to contain domains critical for the targeting of α1S. In order to identify domains of the carboxyl tail that might be important for the expression and targeting of DHPRs and to determine whether these domains interact with other muscle proteins, we have used the yeast two-hybrid method and electrophysiological assays of truncated and mutated DHPRs. The two-hybrid approach revealed that the carboxyl tail of α1S is highly reactive in screens of a skeletal muscle cDNA library and that this reactivity resides in a small region (residues 1621–1647) near the end of the truncated form of the mature channel. The reactivity of the carboxyl tail was abolished by a valine to aspartate point mutation in a consensus PDZ-binding motif that is located within the reactive region. Expression of DHPRs in dysgenic myotubes showed that either truncation or mutation of the carboxyl tail resulted in a decreased efficiency for restoration of EC coupling, a reduction of functional DHPRs expressed in the sarcolemma, and a reduced expression of DHPRs at sites longitudinally distant from the nucleus injected with cDNA. Taken together, these results suggest that residues 1543–1662 are important in the expression of functional DHPRs in the sarcolemma, perhaps as a consequence of interaction with other proteins. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have shown that the carboxyl tail of α1S is highly reactive in yeast two-hybrid screens of a skeletal muscle cDNA library, that this reactivity resides in residues 1621–1647, and that the reactivity is abolished by the V1642D point mutation. In functional assays, we have shown that introduction of the V1642D mutation into the full-length DHPR or truncation after residue 1620 (just before the reactive region) reduces the fraction of dysgenic myotubes with restored EC coupling and lowersQ max, suggesting a decreased surface expression of the altered DHPRs. Truncation of an additional 79 residues (after residue 1542) results in a much larger reduction in the restoration of EC coupling and in Q max. Compared with myotubes expressing GFP-α1S, the green fluorescence in cells expressing Δ1621–1873 or V1642D is more longitudinally restricted (suggestive of altered targeting). Consistent with the large reduction in Q max, cells expressing Δ1543–1873 have substantially reduced fluorescence intensity (indicative of greatly diminished expression).The ratio of G max (maximal Ca2+conductance) to Q′max (maximal charge after correction for dysgenic charge) provides an indirect estimate of the product of P o (open probability) and γ (single channel conductance) of the DHPR Ca2+ channel (15Adams B.A. Tanabe T. Mikami A. Numa S. Beam K.G. Nature. 1990; 346: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the G max/Q′max ratio is lower for GFP-α1S than previously reported (20Grabner M. Dirksen R.T. Suda N. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21913-21919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). A possible explanation is that the previous measurements were made 48–72 h after cDNA injection, whereas the measurements reported here were obtained 24 h after injection. Analysis at 24 h was chosen because it is relatively early with respect to the appearance of the expressed proteins in the sarcolemma and would thus be expected to emphasize differences in targeting. However, it is possible that at 24 h fewer DHPRs were associated with RyRs than at 48–72 h. Such a difference in association would be significant because previous work (19Nakai J. Dirksen R.T. Nguyen H.T. Pessah I.N. Beam K.G. Allen P.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 20Grabner M. Dirksen R.T. Suda N. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21913-21919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) has shown that the G max/Q′max ratio is higher for DHPRs that are functionally associated with RyRs than for DHPRs that are not functionally associated. Truncations of the carboxyl tail could affect the G max/Q′max ratio independently of effects on targeting, because it has been shown that removal of the final 439 residues from the carboxyl tail of α1C (the pore-forming subunit of the cardiac DHPR) causes an increase in the G max/Q max measured after expression in Xenopus oocytes (21Wei X. Neely A. Lacerda A.E. Olcese R. Stefani E. Perez-Reyes E. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1635-1640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Why Does the Carboxyl Tail Have Such High Yeast Reactivity?In library screens with the carboxyl tail, thousands of HIS3-positive colonies were consistently observed. However, there was no activation of the HIS3 reporter gene when the carboxyl tail was present either alone or in combination with the empty activation domain plasmid. Therefore, the reporter gene activation requires the participation of proteins encoded by the cDNA library, which is consistent with a number of alternative explanations. One possibility is that the majority of positive colonies reflect bona fide physiological associations of the carboxyl tail with proteins that are abundantly expressed in the skeletal muscle cDNA library. An argument against this interpretation is that no consistent sequence was identified in inserts isolated from 28 interacting colonies. Thus, if there are direct, physical associations between the carboxyl tail and proteins of the library, then these associations must be very promiscuous (whether or not there are protein interactions that occur in vivo).Instead of directly associating with other muscle proteins, residues 1621–1647 of the DHPR carboxyl tail could interact in a relatively specific manner with a single domain found in one or more abundant, endogenous yeast proteins, which, in turn, could associate with proteins encoded by the skeletal muscle cDNA library, a variant of the yeast three-hybrid system. The importance of the consensus PDZ binding motif in the high reactivity is consistent with, but not limited to, the hypothesis that the endogenous yeast protein(s) contains a PDZ domain. Such an interaction of the DHPR carboxyl tail with a multivalent, PDZ domain-containing yeast protein would thus involve hundreds of skeletal muscle proteins in higher order interactions, resulting in the observed diversity of sequenced interactors and obscuring any possible physiological interactions. A requirement for such higher order interactors is that they not result in a large separation of the two domains of the GAL4 transcription factor. However, the tertiary structure of proteins in a large complex could well allow the activation and binding domains of GAL4 to be spatially close to one another even if they are linked by one or more intermediate proteins. Whether or not physiological associations between the carboxyl tail and muscle library proteins are responsible for the high yeast reactivity, this reactivity appears to have identified a region that influences the function of DHPRs in muscle cells.Could the Carboxyl Tail Play a Role in DHPR Targeting?Because both yeast two-hybrid reactivity and DHPR surface expression are influenced by a domain that contains a consensus PDZ binding motif (("

To understand the function of the MSEs in muscle-specific splicing, we sought to identify trans-acting factors that bind to these elements. MSE3, which is located 66–81 nucleotides downstream of exon 5, assembles a complex that is both sequence- and muscle-specific. Purification and characterization of the MSE3 complex identified one component as 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotideformyltransferase/IMP cyclohydrolase (PurH), an enzyme involved in de novo purine synthesis. Recombinant human PurH protein directly binds MSE3 RNA and PurH is the primary determinant of sequence-specific binding in the native complex. Furthermore, we show a direct correlation between the in vitro binding affinity of both the MSE3 complex and recombinant PurH with functional activation of exon inclusion in vivo.

Exon 5 undergoes developmentally regulated splicing such that inclusion predominates in embryonic skeletal and cardiac muscle and skipping predominates in the adult (19.Cooper T.A. Ordahl C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11140-11148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously identified four cis-acting elements in the introns flanking exon 5 that function as muscle-specific splicing enhancers (MSEs) by transient transfection analysis of cTNT minigenes (5.Ryan K.J. Cooper T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4014-4023Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 6.Cooper T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4519-4525Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The MSEs are necessary for higher levels of exon inclusion in muscle cells than in fibroblast cells. Mutation of these elements causes exon skipping in muscle cells but has little effect on splicing in fibroblasts. These results have defined exon skipping as the default splicing pattern and indicate that exon inclusion requires positive-acting trans-factors present in muscle.The four MSEs are designated 1 to 4. MSE1 is located in intron 4, immediately upstream of exon 5. MSEs 2, 3, and 4 are located in the first 130 nucleotides of intron 5 (5.Ryan K.J. Cooper T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4014-4023Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). MSE3 includes nucleotides 66–81 of intron 5 and was originally identified because of its conservation in sequence and position in four genes that undergo a similar pattern of developmentally regulated alternative splicing in muscle (Ref. 5.Ryan K.J. Cooper T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4014-4023Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar and data not shown). Six copies of MSE3 can functionally replace MSEs 2–4 for regulated splicing in transient transfection analysis of splicing minigenes indicating the importance of MSE3 as a target for muscle-specific regulatory factors (6.Cooper T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4519-4525Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).Here we show that a sequence- and cell-specific complex is formed on MSE3 RNA in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (gel-shift) in nuclear extracts from embryonic muscle tissue or tissue extracts from adult muscle tissue but not in nuclear extracts from fibroblast or HeLa cells. UV cross-linking analysis demonstrates that two proteins of approximately 40 and 70 kDa bind directly to MSE3 RNA. We have purified MSE3 binding activity from both embryonic and adult muscle and have identified the 70-kDa protein as 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase/IMP cyclohydrolase (PurH), an enzyme involved in purine biosynthesis (20.Ni L. Guan K. Zalkin H. Dixon J.E. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 106: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Recombinant PurH binds MSE3 RNA with the same sequence specificity as the MSE3 complex purified from muscle. However, PurH alone forms a complex that is smaller than the MSE3 complex suggesting that the MSE3 complex contains additional proteins. The binding affinities of the MSE3 complex and PurH to five different sequences in vitro correlate with splicing enhancer activities of these sequences in vivo supporting a model in which binding of the PurH containing complex to MSE3 contributes to muscle-specific exon inclusion.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloningPlasmids for in vitro transcription of MSE3 and MSE3m RNAs were constructed using the oligos CON (GGTGTGTCCTGTGCCTTTCCCTGCTCTAGATGAT) and MCON (GGTGACGACGAC GATGAGCTGCTCTAGATGAT), respectively. Oligos were kinased using polynucleotide kinase, and second strand synthesis was carried out by annealing the oligo CONR (ATCATCTAGAGCAG) to both oligos and extending with T4 DNA polymerase (21.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The double stranded DNA was digested using XbaI. The resulting fragments were ligated into SacI (blunted using T4 DNA polymerase) andXbaI sites of Bluescript KS+.Plasmid templates for randomized MSE3-based RNAs were constructed by cloning PCR products which included the T7 RNA polymerase promoter into the sp64 plasmid (Promega). These plasmids produce RNAs that are identical to MSE3 RNA except for 14 randomized nucleotides indicated as “N” in the sequence of CON/sel oligo, below and Fig. 9 A. These positions were chosen since mutation of these positions inactivated MSE3 in vivo (5.Ryan K.J. Cooper T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4014-4023Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Template plasmids were generated using CON/sel oligo (5′-GGGCGAATTGGGGTG(N)14CCCTGCTCTAG-3′) in a PCR reaction with T7CON (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCGAATTGGGGT-3′) and 3SEL (5′-CTAGAGCAGGG-3′). The PCR reaction was performed using 3.5 unitsTaq polymerase and buffer (Promega) with 2 mmMgCl2 and 0.2 mm dNTPs. 30 cycles of the following PCR was performed: 1 min at 95 °C, 30 s at 54 °C, and 15 s at 72 °C. Following the last cycle an additional extension at 72 °C for 5 min was done. After PCR, the reactions were phenol/chloroform extracted and ethanol precipitated. The PCR product was treated with T4 DNA polymerase to create blunt ends, kinased using T4 polynucleotide kinase (21.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), phenol/chloroform extracted and ethanol precipitated. The DNA pellet was brought up in water and a small aliquot was ligated into the filled-in HindIII site in a modified sp64 plasmid in which the XbaI site was removed by filling in and religation. Fusion of the PCR product and filled-inHindIII generates a XbaI site at the 3′ of the PCR product in either orientation. Individual colonies were selected for further studies.The splicing minigenes MSE3x6 and MSE3mx6 were derived from MSE3(x6) and MSE3mut(x6) (6.Cooper T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4519-4525Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Concatamers for r0-2x6, r0-4x6, r3-49x6, and r3-51x6 were made by annealing the complementary oligos CTAGAGGGTCGGTGN(14)CCCTGCTTGGG and CTAGCCCAAGCAGGGN(14)CACCGACCT to create double stranded monomers (see Fig. 9 for the sequence of N14 for each clone). Concatamers containing six copies in the head to tail orientation were generated as described (6.Cooper T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4519-4525Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Concatamers were ligated into a minigene such that these constructs were identical to the MSE3x6 construct except for the central, 14-nucleotide variable region. All inserts were confirmed by sequencing both DNA strands.In Vitro TranscriptionLabeled RNA was transcribed in 20-μl reactions containing 40 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm spermidine, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 1.25 mm diguanosine triphosphate, 20 units of RNasin, 0.5 mm ATP and CTP, 75 μm GTP and UTP, 5 μl each [α-32P]GTP and [α-32P]UTP (both 800 Ci/mmol), 100 units of T7 RNA polymerase (New England Biolabs), and using 1 μg of linearized DNA as a template. Synthesis was carried out at 37 °C for 1–2 h. Reactions were ethanol precipitated and RNA was isolated from a denaturing polyacrylamide gel.Unlabeled competitor RNAs were synthesized in 100-μl reactions containing 40 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20 mmMgCl2, 2 mm spermidine, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mm each GTP, ATP, UTP, and CTP, 40 units of RNasin, 6 μg of template DNA, and 800 units of T7 RNA polymerase. Reactions were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C then an additional 800 units of polymerase were added, and synthesis was continued for another 1–2 h. Reactions were phenol:chloroform extracted and ethanol precipitated. RNA was isolated from a denaturing polyacrylamide gel by UV shadowing. RNA was quantified by measuring absorbance at 260 nm.Nuclear Extract from FibroblastsQT35 quail fibroblast cells were grown in F-10 media supplemented with 10% tryptose phosphate, 5% fetal calf serum, 1% chicken serum, 1% dimethyl sulfoxide, and 2 mm glutamine and then split 1:10. Cells were allowed to reach approximately 80% confluence in 100-mm plates prior to harvest. To harvest, the media was removed and plates were washed once and then scraped in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. During this time, plates were kept on ice. A cell pellet was obtained by centrifugation. Nuclear extract was prepared from the cells as described by Lee et al. (22.Lee K.A.W. Binderief A. Green M.R. Gene Anal. Tech. 1988; 5: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were suspended in one packed cell volume of Dignam A (23.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 5: 1475-1489Crossref Scopus (9143) Google Scholar) and allowed to swell on ice for 15 min. To lyse, the cells were drawn up in a syringe and rapidly pushed through a 26-gauge needle. This was repeated approximately 10 times. Nuclei were pelleted. The supernatant was removed and the nuclear pellet resuspended in 2/3 of the original packed cell volume of Dignam C. Extraction of nuclei was carried out on ice for 1.5 h with constant mixing. After extraction, nuclei were pelleted and the supernatant was dialyzed against a modified Dignam D buffer (DG) that replaced the 100 mm KCl with 80 mm potassium glutamate (24.Black D.L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 389-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar).Embryonic Muscle Nuclear ExtractEmbryonic muscle nuclei were isolated from skeletal and heart muscle of day 12 chicken embryos as described (25.Mar J.H. Ordahl C.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4271-4283Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Six to seven dozen embryos yielded 30–40 g of tissue. After obtaining the nuclear pellet, the proteins were extracted on ice with a roughly equal volume of Dignam C buffer containing 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1.0 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin for 1.5 h. Proteins were dialyzed against DG buffer containing protease inhibitors using a dialysis membrane with a molecular weight cut off (MWCO) of 3,500. A typical yield from 30 to 40 g of tissue was approximately 35 mg of total protein.Adult Muscle Tissue ExtractAdult muscle extract was prepared from chickens based on the method of Skeek and Slater (26.Scheek R.M. Slater E.C. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 89: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Skeletal muscle (primarily breast with some leg) was isolated from freshly sacrificed adult hens. The tissue was minced into small pieces and homogenized in 30 mm KOH, 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH ∼ 14 (120 ml/100 g tissue) using a Waring blender. The homogenate was allowed to sit on ice for 15 min with occasional stirring. The homogenate was centrifuged for 20 min at 21,000 × g. The supernatant was poured off and saved, and the pellet re-extracted in 2/3 original volume for another 15 min. After centrifugation, both supernatants were pooled and passed through 4 layers of cheesecloth. This crude extract was placed on ice and brought slowly to 40% (NH4)2SO4 saturation with the addition of solid (NH4)2SO4 (23 g solid/100 ml). After the addition was complete, stirring continued for an additional 30 min, then the precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was brought to 65% (NH4)2SO4 saturation (16.6 g solid/100 ml) as before and precipitated proteins recovered by centrifugation. The protein pellets were resuspended by rocking overnight in DG buffer without glycerol. The next day, the extract was dialyzed against DG buffer (which contains 20% glycerol) using a dialysis membrane with a MWCO of 3,500. For approximately 150 ml of extract, dialysis was carried out for a total of 10 h using 4 changes of 2 liters of buffer. Typically, 500 g of muscle tissue resulted in 140 ml of 40–65% extract with a protein concentration of 70–90 mg/ml.Commercial ProteinsRabbit muscle aldolase (A1893) and rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase (P7768) were purchased from Sigma. Before use, each was changed into the DG buffer using Ultrafree concentrating units with a MWCO of 10,000 (Millipore). The result of the buffer exchange (repeated dilution and concentration) was at least a 1:100,000-fold dilution of the original buffer.Recombinant PurHRecombinant human PurH and a pET-28a (Novagen) based expression plasmid (pET28a-hATIC) were kind gifts of S. Benkovic (Penn State University). For expression of recombinant protein, the h-ATIC plasmid was transformed into BL21(DES)pLys-S. Expression and purification of the His-tagged, recombinant protein was based on the manufacture's instructions (Novagen pET system manual).Gel-shift Analysis/QuantitationBinding reactions were performed in 12.5-μl reactions using 45% extract and ∼90,000 cpm of labeled RNA in the presence of 625 μm ATP, 25 mm MgCl2, 25 mm creatine phosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.8% PEG. When competitor RNA was used, the competitor and labeled RNA were mixed prior to the addition of protein. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min, placed on ice, and loaded directly onto a 6% acrylamide (55:1 acrylamide to bis) TGE (50 mm Trizma base, 380 mm glycine, and 2 mm EDTA) gel containing 2.5% glycerol (27.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). The gel was run at 35 mA constant current for 3.5 h at 4 °C. After electrophoresis was complete, the gel was dried and exposed for autoradiography.Gels were quantitated using a PhosphorImager. The level of MSE complex remaining with addition of competitor was calculated as [cpm MSE3 complex/(cpm MSE3 complex + cpm free probe)] normalized to the value determined when no competitor was used in each experiment.UV Cross-linkingUV cross-linking was performed as described previously with the following modifications (28.Ramchatesingh J. Zahler A.M. Neugebauer K.M. Roth M.B. Cooper T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4898-4907Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Protein fractions were incubated with 1.5 × 105 cpm of high specific activity RNA (see above) as for a gel-shift. Samples were UV irradiated 4 cm from a germicidal lamp (Phillips G15T8) for 6 min. Samples were digested with RNase T1 (0.5 μg) for 30 min at 37 °C. An equal volume of protein loading buffer was added to each sample, and samples were denatured at 100 °C. Proteins were resolved by 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Sizes were determined using prestained markers (Bio-Rad or Life Technologies). For competitions, the competitor RNA and the substrate were mixed prior to the addition of protein.Protein PurificationGeneralAll columns were run by gravity flow at 4 °C. Samples were loaded directly to the columns in DG buffer and eluted with NaCl in DG buffer without glycerol except where indicated. Samples were concentrated using Ultrafree units with a MWCO of 10,000. After each step in purification, samples were either extensively dialyzed against DG buffer using a dialysis membrane with 3,500 MWCO or by buffer exchange into DG buffer using the Ultrafree units. In the case of buffer exchange, there was at least a 1:20,000-fold dilution of the starting salt concentration.EmbryonicEmbryonic muscle nuclear extract was applied to a heparin-agarose column (Sigma or Bio-Rad) and washed with at least 5 column volumes of DG buffer. The column was eluted with 100 mm NaCl and fractions containing protein pooled. The heparin-agarose fraction was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column and binding activity was washed from the column without additional salt. The Q fraction was then applied to a poly(U)-agarose column (Sigma). The column was washed with at least 5 column volumes of DG buffer and eluted with 100 mm NaCl. This produced the final embryonic MSE3-binding fraction.AdultMSE3 binding activity was purified from a 40–65% ammonium sulfate fraction of adult muscle extract by modifying the scheme for purification from embryonic nuclear extract. Approximately 800 mg (10 ml) of the 40–65% fraction was loaded onto a 140-ml heparin-agarose column (Bio-Rad). The column was washed with at least 5 column volumes of DG buffer and eluted with 100 mmNaCl.For isoelectric focusing, the 100 mm fractions from three heparin-agarose columns were pooled and dialyzed in 5 mmHEPES, 10 mm potassium glutamate, and 20% glycerol to reduce the ionic strength. The protein sample was brought to 50 ml and to 0.5% CHAPS and 2% ampholytes pH 7–9 (Bio-Lyte 7/9, Bio-Rad). Proteins in this sample were separated at 15 Watts constant power using a Rotorfor cell (Bio-Rad). Focusing was allowed to continue until the current remained constant for at least 20 min (approximately 4 h). Fractions were immediately tested for MSE3 binding activity and those with activity pooled.Fractions from two isoelectric focusings were applied to a 140-ml Reactive Red 120 column (Sigma), and the column washed with 250 mm NaCl until protein was no longer eluted as determined by measuring absorbance at 280 nm. The column was eluted with 750 mm NaCl, and fractions containing protein were pooled and saved.The Reactive Red fraction was further separated on a 6-ml poly(U)-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was eluted with a 70-ml 0–100 mm NaCl gradient in DG buffer containing 5% glycerol. Two-ml fractions were collected and assayed directly for MSE3 binding activity. Fractions containing the activity peaks were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed.The final step in purification of adult binding activity was to pool two poly(U) columns and apply them to a 6-ml heparin-agarose column (Bio-Rad). The column was eluted with a 70-ml linear gradient of 0–175 mm NaCl in DG buffer containing 5% glycerol. Two-ml fractions were collected, concentrated, and brought back to equal volumes during buffer exchange in DG buffer. Equal volumes were assayed by gel-shift and SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining. Proteins were eluted from gels and protein sequencing was performed by the Protein Chemistry Core Facility at Baylor College of Medicine (Table I).Table IThe proteins copurifying with MSE3 binding activity were sequenced and the peptides identified using database searchesProteinM rPeptidePercent identitySourceAldolase40 kDa1.

Open table in a new tab TransfectionsCalcium phosphate-mediated transfection into QT35 cells (fibroblasts) and primary embryonic skeletal muscle cultures, RNA extraction, and RT-PCR have been previously described (6.Cooper T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4519-4525Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Products of RT-PCR were quantitated directly from gels using a PhosphorImager. Percent exon inclusion was calculated as [cpm exon inclusion/(cpm exon inclusion + cpm exon skipping)] × 100. Results presented are the average of at least three independent transfections.DISCUSSIONIncreased inclusion of cTNT exon 5 requires at least three of four intronic MSEs which act in a positive manner in muscle cells while having no effect in fibroblasts, consistent with a model in which positive-acting factors in muscle bind to the MSEs to increase exon inclusion (5.Ryan K.J.

Nadal-Ginard B. Smith C.W.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3861-3872Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Regulation of neuron-specific inclusion of the N-1 exon of c-src also requires sequences both upstream and downstream of the alternative exon. The downstream control region is required for inclusion of the N-1 exon in neuronal cells and forms a specific complex with neuronal but not HeLa nuclear extract in vitro (15.Min H.S. Chan R.C. Black D.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2659-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Many of the factors in this complex have been identified (13.Min H. Turck C.W. Nikolic J.M. Black D.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1023-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 15.Min H.S. Chan R.C. Black D.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2659-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 18.Chou M.Y. Rooke N. Turck C.W. Black D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar); however, the factor(s) responsible for the neuron-specific assembly of the complex has not yet been identified. The best characterized example of regulated alternative splicing is the inclusion of the female-specific exon 4 of the doublesex(dsx) gene in Drosophila. Inclusion of this exon requires the activation of a weak 3′ splice site (31.Burtis K.C. Baker B.S. Cell. 1989; 56: 997-1010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 32.Ryner L.C. Baker B.S. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2071-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and is controlled by three distinct cis regulatory sequences: thedsx repeat elements (31.Burtis K.C. Baker B.S. Cell. 1989; 56: 997-1010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 33.Nagoshi R.N. Baker B.S. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 34.Hedley M.L.

Cell. 1993; 74: 105-114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), a purine-rich exon splicing enhancer (36.Lynch K.W. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 284-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and a sequence just upstream of the 3′ splice site (37.Heinrichs V. Baker B.S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3987-4000Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Of the three types of elements, only the repeat elements are recognized by a female-specific factor. The female-specificTransformer (Tra) protein binds to thedsx repeats in a complex with the ubiquitously expressed Tra-2 and members of the SR protein family (34.Hedley M.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1991; 65: 579-586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 35.Tian M. Maniatis T.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2089-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar).We hypothesize that the regulation of exon inclusion by the MSEs is similar to the regulation seen in c-src and dsx. It is not necessary for all of the MSEs to bind a muscle-specific factor to be involved in muscle-specific activation of exon inclusion; however, it seems likely that at least one MSE is recognized by factors present in muscle but not fibroblast cells. Since we are most interested in finding muscle-specific splicing regulators, we sought to identify factors that bind to the MSEs that are both sequence- and cell-specific. Both criteria are fulfilled since MSE3 forms a sequence-specific complex in embryonic muscle nuclear extract but not in nuclear extract from fibroblasts or HeLa cells.Alternative splicing of exon 5 results in high levels of exon inclusion in embryonic striated muscle that decreases to undetectable levels of inclusion in the adult (19.Cooper T.A. Ordahl C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11140-11148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During our characterization of embryonic MSE3 binding activity, we identified the same MSE3 binding activity in adult muscle extract. It is important to note that the MSEs were defined as being required for exon inclusion in embry"

https://openalex.org/W1558667417,"We have previously described a rat monoclonal antibody, RS-11, which recognizes a tumor-associated antigen common to several species. In the present study, we have cloned and characterized the antigen recognized by RS-11. We screened a phage expression library prepared from HeLa cDNA and identified a clone that reacts with RS-11. DNA sequence analysis revealed that this clone contains sequences of keratin 18 (nucleotides 568–1196). We constructed several glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins and synthetic peptides based on this DNA sequence analysis and examined their reactivity with RS-11 to accurately map the RS-11 epitope. We determined that the epitope resides within a region of seven amino acids on the α-helix 2B domain of keratin 18 in which two amino acids (Leu366 and Lys370) are completely conserved among intermediate filaments as well as other keratin members that are immunoreactive with RS-11. These two residues are sequentially discontinuous but spatially adjacent. The RS-11 epitope is constitutively present in human primary cultured hepatocytes; however, its immunoreactivity with RS-11 is up-regulated by malignant transformation or stimulation with either epidermal growth factor or transforming growth factor alpha."
