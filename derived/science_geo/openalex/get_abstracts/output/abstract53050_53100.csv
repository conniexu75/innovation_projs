https://openalex.org/W1509313620,"Abstract Soluble collagen from guinea pig skin has been subjected to sequential digestion with purified collagenase and trypsin. The small quantity of hexose present in the collagen can be detected in the digest largely as relatively basic glycopeptides. One of these glycopeptides has been obtained in pure form and accounts for at least 30% of the hexose of the original collagen. This glycopeptide has been shown to consist of a disaccharide of glucose and galactose linked O-glycosidically to the hydroxyl group of a hydroxylysine residue in a special peptide region of the collagen molecule. The amino acid composition and probable sequence in this region was shown to be -Gly-Met-Hyl(Glc, Gal)-Gly-His-Arg- A possible role for this structure in the formation of cross-links during collagen maturation is described."

These strains include steroid-secreting Leydig cells, melanomacells that form pigment, and two strains from a hormone-secreting rat pituitary tumor. One of the cell lines from the pituitary tumor secretes growt hormone, while another line derived from the same tumor secretes a substance similar to adrenocorticotropic hormone."
https://openalex.org/W1539376782,"The decarboxylation-dehydration of 5-pyrophosphomevalonate to isopentenyl pyrophosphate (isopentenyl-PP) and the mechanism of the carbon to carbon bond formation between an allyl pyrophosphate (3,3-dimethylallyl or geranyl pyrophosphate) and isopentenyl-PP have been studied with the aid of two specimens of mevalonate labeled stereospecifically with deuterium at C-2 (2R-2D1-mevalonate and 2S-2D1-mevalonate). Preparation of these specimens from stereospecifically labeled 4D1-mevalonates by an interchange of the carboxyl and carbinol groups is described. Both of these substrates have been converted enzymically into isopentenyl-PP, and one of them, the 2R-2D1-mevalonate, has been converted into farnesyl pyrophosphate from which the free alcohols were isolated for chemical study. A chemical method has been evolved for the determination of the steric positions of hydrogen and deuterium attached to the terminal doubly bound methylene carbon atom of isopentenol. It was shown that the 2R-mevalonate gave cis-4D1-isopentenol and the 2S-mevalonate gave trans-4D1-isopentenol, indicating that the decarboxylation of 5-pyrophosphomevalonate was a trans elimination of the tertiary hydroxyl and of the carboxyl group. It was deduced from the steric position of deuterium at C-4 and C-8 of farnesol biosynthesized from 2R-2D1-mevalonate that the allyl pyrophosphate was added to C-4 of isopentenyl-PP from that side of the molecule on which the four substituents, —CH2CH2OPP, —CH3, —H, and —H, around the double bond of isopentenyl-PP appeared in a clockwise order. These observations, taken in conjuction with the authors' previous findings, show that there are probably two steps in the formation of the C—C bond between an allyl pyrophosphate and isopentenyl-PP. First the allyl residue and an as yet unidentified nucleophilic X group are added across the double bond in a trans manner; this is then followed by a trans elimination of X and of a proton from C-2 of isopentenyl-PP."
https://openalex.org/W2061086240,"Increasing concentrations of sodium octanoate were progressively inhibitory to the activities of glucokinase, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate kinase. Glucose-6-phosphate and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenases were also markedly inhibited. Other enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism such as lactate dehydrogenase, phosphohexose isomerase, and fructose-1,6-diphosphatase were not decreased. Among the key glycolytic enzymes, the inhibition of pyruvate kinase by the fatty acid was most marked. The biological significance of the inhibition of the key glycolytic enzymes is interpreted as a feedback inhibitory mechanism in regulation of fatty acid biosynthesis. The mechanism may function for rapid adaptation by which the organism can use the fatty acid level as a metabolic directional switch in decreasing glycolysis and turning on gluconeogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1672414975,"An enzyme, cytidine monophosphate sialic acid synthetase, was purified from hog submaxillary glands. This enzyme (or enzymes) catalyzes the synthesis of CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid or CMP-N-glycolylneuraminic acid or both and inorganic pyrophosphate from CTP and the corresponding sialic acids. The preparation was inactive with other known sialic acids and analogues of these compounds, and was also inactive with other nucleotides. The properties of the purified enzyme and its distribution are reported. Reversibility of the reaction was detected, i.e. the enzyme catalyzed the incorporation of 32PPi into CTP in complete incubation mixtures. Addition of hydroxylamine to incubation mixtures did not yield N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxamate. The chemical synthesis of N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxamate is described."
https://openalex.org/W1529394259,"Abstract Red cells are known to use glucose and produce lactate at an increased rate in the presence of increased inorganic phosphate. The stimulation by inorganic phosphate of hexokinase and phosphofructokinase is recognized, but the cause of the necessary rate increase of pyruvate kinase is not. Kinetic studies with this enzyme from normal and human mutant cells and steady state studies with whole glycolyzing cells support the conclusion that pyruvate kinase is normally operating far below saturation with respect to phosphoenolpyruvate. The increase in the rate of formation of phosphoenolpyruvate is primarily responsible for the increase in its rate of reaction in the kinase step. Pyruvate kinase-deficient cells with about 10% as much enzyme activity reach much higher and even saturating levels of phosphoenolpyruvate in order to utilize a larger proportion of their enzyme. This is necessary to achieve the normal glycolytic rates observed. The explanation for the accumulation of fructose diphosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate at high glycolytic rates in normal and deficient cells is that glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase becomes ratelimiting as a result of an increased ratio of reduced to oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and increased 1,3-diphosphoglyceric acid. These factors increase at high glycolytic rate because the increased phosphoenolpyruvate plus phosphoglyceric acids leave an amount of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide unoxidized and because the phosphoglycerate kinase reaction is probably at equilibrium. The large pool of 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid in many mammalian red cells is seen as a possible source of the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide oxidant, pyruvate, necessary to regulate this effect which, in the limit, would exhaust the cell's adenosine triphosphate supply."
https://openalex.org/W1483242873,"Abstract A method has been developed for the determination of guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate, uridine 3',5'-monophosphate, and adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate by modifying one basic assay system. Applying this method to the measurement of urinary excretion of cyclic nucleotides in rats, guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate excretion was found to be decreased by hypophysectomy while adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate excretion was unchanged. Guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate excretion in hypophysectomized rats was elevated by combined treatment with hydrocortisone plus six pituitary hormones or with hydrocortisone plus thyroxine."
https://openalex.org/W1520406833,"Proteins of fat cells, isolated from rat epididymal fat pads, were labeled with 14C-histidine or 14C-leucine. The fate of the labeled protein was examined after subsequent treatment of the cells with hormones. Release of labeled proteins was stimulated by lipolytic hormones (adrenocorticotropic hormone, glucagon, and epinephrine) and by theophylline. Proteolysis, as measured by the appearance in the medium of trichloracetic acid-soluble radioactivity, occurred to a small extent but was not influenced by lipolytic hormones. Release of such nonparticulate enzymes as malic dehydrogenase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, lactic dehydrogenase, and hexokinase was also enhanced by lipolytic hormones. In intact adipose tissue, lipolytic hormones had the same effect on release of enzymes as observed with isolated fat cells. Release of protein was secondary to the rise in intracellular concentration of fatty acids in response to lipolytic hormones. Fatty acids, not their peroxides, were responsible for the release of protein. Isolated fat cells released protein after albumin in the medium became saturated with fatty acids. Intact adipose tissue released enzymes in response to lipolytic hormones when the concentration of fatty acids in the tissue reached approximately 16 µeq per g. With isolated fat cells, accumulation of intracellular fatty acids and protein release were prevented by either providing an excess of albumin in the medium or supplying glucose to the cells, especially in the presence of insulin, which accelerated re-esterification of intracellular fatty acids. It is suggested that the metabolic capacity of adipose tissue, in vitro and in vivo, is regulated in part by the release of cellular protein mediated through the intracellular concentration of fatty acids which is the product of the opposing actions of insulin and lipolytic hormones."
https://openalex.org/W1533055027,"Abstract A coenzyme A- and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-linked pyruvate dehydrogenase complex has been isolated from pig heart muscle as a multienzyme unit with a molecular weight of approximately 9.0 million. The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex contains approximately 67 moles of protein-bound lipoic acid and 14 moles of bound flavin adenine dinucleotide. The highly purified complex is free of thiamine pyrophosphate and the activity in the dismutation assay was restored by added thiamine-PP, a Km of 4.2 x 10-6 m. All preparations of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex examined showed absolute dependence on added CoA and NAD in the dismutation assay."
https://openalex.org/W1488496569,"Abstract 3-Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase, phosphoserine phosphatase, d-glycerate dehydrogenase, and serine dehydratase have been measured in rats fet diets containing variable amounts of protein. Rats fed 2% casein diets for 7 days had a marked increase in 3-P-glycerate dehydrogenase and P-serine phosphatase and a simultaneous decline in serine dehydratase when compared to rats fed chow or a 25% casein diet. The increased enzyme levels were prevented by the addition of 1% cysteine to the 2% casein diet but this did not alter the decline in serine dehydratase. On 88% casein diets a depression of 3-P-glycerate dehydrogenase and P-serine phosphatase resulted, while prompt increase in serine dehydratase occurred. No reproducible changes in d-glycerate dehydrogenase occurred on any of the diets studied. The administration of actinomycin D on several schedules consistently caused an inhibition of the changes noted with the 2% casein diet. These observations plus studies with cycloheximide suggest that the observed alterations in enzyme concentrations may be mediated by altered rates of enzyme synthesis. Studies of potential feedback inhibitors of the reactions measured were negative for 3-P-glycerate dehydrogenase and d-glycerate dehydrogenase. Inhibition of P-serine phosphatase by l-serine may have physiological significance in mammals. The inhibition of serine dehydratase by l-cysteine is described."
https://openalex.org/W1556316831,"Abstract An arginine-activating enzyme purified from Escherichia coli does not catalyze the exchange of pyrophosphate and adenosine triphosphate except in the presence of the transfer ribonucleic acid capable of accepting arginine. The back reaction, in which arginyl-tRNA reacts with adenylic acid and pyrophosphate, proceeds at about the same rate as the forward reaction. The back reaction is inhibited only slightly by components of the forward reaction, but the forward reaction is strongly inhibited by pyrophosphate. An isotope-trapping experiment showed that free arginyl-tRNA was not formed in the presence of pyrophosphate. It is suggested that tRNA serves as an activator of the arginine-activating enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1481191247,"The pyridine moieties of the pyridine nucleotides, nicotinic acid mononucleotide, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, were shown to be incorporated into ricinine by Ricinus communis L. with an efficiency comparable to that of quinolinic acid, nicotinic acid, and nicotinamide, which had been established previously as being efficient precursors of this alkaloid. All of these pyridine compounds except quinolinic acid were postulated to be closely related in a cyclic form, and they could function as a source of metabolic intermediates for the biosynthesis of ricinine. It was shown that nicotinamide was readily converted to nicotinic acid and N-methylnicotinamide in vivo; nicotinic acid was converted to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and N-methylnicotinic acid (trigonelline) in vitro; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide was readily converted to nicotinamide and N-methylnicotinamide in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1553732917,"Abstract 1. Heavy bovine heart mitochondria were made deficient in cytochrome c by extraction with a solution of KCl. This preparation, containing about 15% of the normal complement of cytochrome c, was used in studies on the effect of exogenous cytochrome c on several energy-linked processes. 2. The P:O ratio of the preparation was increased as the oxidation rate was increased with small progressive additions of cytochrome c. The effect may have been caused by the participation of cytochrome c in the formation of an intermediate of oxidative phosphorylation, or to the fact that the P:O ratios were lowered as the rate at which electrons traversed the chain was lowered. 3. In the cytochrome c-deficient particles, the energy-linked systems implementing calcium translocation and pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenation were found to be intact and fully functional when adenosine triphosphate was the source of energy. However, the systems required cytochrome c when oxidation of substrate was the source of energy. 4. The study points out the unlikelihood that cytochrome c is a component part of an intermediate that functions in the steps between the breakdown of ATP and the formation of the high energy intermediate utilized by energy-requiring processes. It may, however, be a component part of an intermediate that functions at a point between the electron transfer chain and the formation of the high energy intermediate utilized by energy-requiring processes."
https://openalex.org/W1572854121,"Abstract Mitochondrial particles prepared by exposing mitochondria to sonic oscillation catalyzed the oxidation of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide by ubiquinone-6, ubiquinone-10, the lower homologues of ubiquinone, and menadione. Ubiquinone-6 reduction activity was inhibited completely by rotenone and by amytal. Menadione reduction was also inhibited, but only partially, suggesting multiple sites of interaction of menadione with the respiratory chain. The extraction of a soluble reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ubiquinone reductase from mitochondrial particles is described. The assay conditions for measuring the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ubiquinone reductase activity of particulate and soluble preparations are described in detail. The assay, which is carried out in a heterogeneous system containing ubiquinone in suspension, is sensitive to a variety of factors."
https://openalex.org/W1598891409,"Abstract 1. A stable ternary complex of salicylate hydroxylase apoenzyme, flavin adenine dinucleotide, and salicylate was detected by a change of the absorption spectrum and by titration of the holoenzyme with salicylate. 2. The complex was enzymatically active, since the stoichiometric formation of the product, catechol, was observed upon introduction of air into a solution of reduced form of the complex. 3. On the basis of the results, the following scheme was postulated for the over-all reaction of salicylate hydroxylase. E-FAD + salicylate → E-FAD-salicylate E-FAD-salicylate + NADH2 → E-FADH2-salicylate + NAD E-FADH2-salicylate + 02 → E-FAD + catechol + CO2 + H20 Here, E denotes the protein moiety of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1529195725,"Abstract An enzyme from calf thymus nuclei which incorporates ribonucleotides or deoxyribonucleotides into terminal positions of deoxyribonucleic acid has been purified and its mechanism of action elucidated. Distinctions between this enzyme and replicative deoxynucleotidyltransferase (DNA polymerase), the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase of calf thymus cytoplasm, and other polymerases have been established. The enzyme utilizes a nucleoside triphosphate precursor and a denatured deoxyribonucleic acid primer in a reaction which requires Mg++, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and a sulfhydryl compound for maximal activity. No nucleotide specificity in the deoxyribonucleic acid acceptor can be demonstrated other than that the addition of ribonucleotide to ribonucleotide does not occur. The same DNA acceptor sites appear to be involved in the incorporation of all the nucleoside triphosphates tested. Oligodeoxythymidylic acid, three nucleotides in length, cannot function as a primer in this system. The terminal β- and γ-phosphates of the nucleoside triphosphate substrates are liberated as free pyrophosphate during the reaction. No exchange between free pyrophosphate and a nucleoside triphosphate occurs. The reaction thus appears to be irreversible. The same enzyme from calf thymus nuclei is apparently responsible for the incorporation of cytidine triphosphate, guanosine triphosphate, adenosine triphosphate, and deoxyadenosine triphosphate. Differences in the incorporation rates of these substrates are shown. Under the appropriate incubation conditions, this enzyme may be used as a preparative tool for the synthesis of DNA bearing a high percentage of ribonucleotide termini. Such DNA has been utilized in an assay for exonuclease activity."

https://openalex.org/W1569673208,"Abstract Cultured mammalian cells can synthesize both glutamic acid and glutamine in amounts sufficient for growth. The necessary conditions are (a) a sufficiently high population density, approaching that of a saturated culture, and (b) glutamine synthetase activity sufficiently high to utilize the newly formed glutamic acid effectively. Three strains of rat tumor cells in culture had widely varying biosynthetic capacities for asparagine, with corresponding differences in the minimum population densities permitting growth and in the precursors necessary. At extremely high population densities the 3-methyl-4-dimethylaminoazobenzene-induced carcinoma cell could grow in the absence of both aspartic acid and asparagine, the carbon skeleton then deriving from glucose and glutamine. The Jensen sarcoma cell could also synthesize aspartic acid; however, exogenous aspartic acid had to be provided in order to permit growth, the minimum effective concentration varying inversely with the population density. Although the Walker 256 cell could also synthesize aspartic acid and could transport an exogenous supply into the cell, the strain here studied would not grow under any conditions in the absence of preformed asparagine, indicative of an almost complete block in asparagine synthesis from aspartic acid and glutamine. Possible determinants of these population-dependent requirements are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1604855338,"Abstract The sensitivity of lipoyl dehydrogenase to phenylmercuric acetate, a reagent for —SH groups, has been investigated. Titration of available sulfhydryl groups in the enzyme brings about inactivation in the reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide-lipoyl reductase activity, while activity with the artificial hydrogen acceptor 2,6-dichloroindophenol (DCI) is stimulated. Similar results are found upon treating the enzyme with phenylmercuric acetate after prior reduction by DPNH, except that a lower level of mercurial is required for inhibition of oxidized dl-α-lipoic acid activity, and DCI activity is more stable. Upon reduction with DPNH the semiquinone of the mercurial-treated enzyme is initially produced, but is no longer stable; the enzyme has a much greater tendency to be reduced to the 4-electron reduction state. Enzyme allowed to react with phenylmercuric acetate for a long period of time is lacking in DPNH-DCI reductase activity, and shows very slow reduction through the semiquinone when treated with DPNH. Evidence is presented that the effect of mercurial on both DPNH-lipoyl and DPNH-DCI reductase activities is due to transfer of mercurial to the active center during catalysis. A schematic representation of the reaction mechanism is presented which shows the presumed reasons for the changes in the catalytic properties of lipoyl dehydrogenase after mercurial treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1606047965,"Abstract Large concentrations of puromycin inhibited the synthesis of peptide-bound hydroxyproline by embryonic cartilage to a greater extent than they inhibited the synthesis of polypeptides. Investigation of this effect provided further evidence for the suggestion that hydroxyproline is synthesized by the hydroxylation of proline after proline is incorporated into a proline-rich polypeptide precursor of collagen. Gel filtration of the soluble polypeptides which were obtained from samples inhibited with puromycin suggested that polypeptides with molecular weights greater than 10,000 must be synthesized before the hydroxylation can occur."
https://openalex.org/W1483207615,"Abstract Kinetic data indicate that rabbit muscle glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase possesses two types of diphosphopyridine nucleotide-binding sites. The actual chemical reaction (oxidation-reduction) occurs at tight sites. Binding of DPN to loose sites activates the reaction at the tight sites. These results are consistent with the concept that the enzyme is double headed, with oxidation-reduction heads (which contain the tight sites) and transfer heads (which contain the loose sites). Light scattering data are consistent with the concept that (in the absence of arsenate or phosphate) the enzyme can exist as a dimer (with an apparent weight average molecular weight of 2.8 x 105) which can dissociate upon dilution into monomers (with molecular weights of 1.4 x 105). Dimerization is inhibited by high concentrations of arsenate (0.05 m). This inhibition is overcome by adding DPN to the loose sites. The monomer is unreactive in the absence of arsenate and is markedly activated by adding DPN to the loose sites. The dimer is reactive in the absence of arsenate and is only slightly activated by adding DPN to the loose sites. A kinetic mechanism is proposed which agrees with these and most other observations. This mechanism is sequential with the addition of DPN and then the aldehyde to the oxidation-reduction head. This is followed by the addition of arsenate and then DPN to the transfer head. The mech anism of the reaction with glyceraldehyde and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate seems to be the same."
https://openalex.org/W1818763050,"Abstract A biotin-degrading particulate system has been obtained by sonic rupture of a soil pseudomonad which grows on d-biotin as sole source of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur. Investigation of the catabolism of 14C-biotin and its sulfoxides in this system has revealed the following. Degradation of biotin to CO2 is enhanced in the buffer-washed particulate preparations by addition of adenosine triphosphate, Mg2+, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, and coenzyme A. Maximal activation is found with 10-5 m nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. Production of CO2 from ureido carbonyl and aliphatic carboxyl portions of biotin and biotin d-sulfoxide is effectively inhibited by azide but is decreased only slightly by high concentrations of acetate or malonate. Oxybiotin, homobiotin, norbiotin, dethiobiotin, and the diaminocarboxylate from biotin moderately inhibit degradation of biotin and its d-sulfoxide. l-Cysteine is effective as an apparent inhibitor, but this amino acid is very actively metabolized in the particulate preparations. Biotin and both d- and l-sulfoxides of biotin are efficiently catabolized by the particulate preparations and exhibit mutual competition as substrates. Production of CO2 is most rapid from biotin d-sulfoxide, whereas the l-sulfoxide is somewhat less active than biotin. Very little degradation of biotin sulfone or diaminocarboxylate occurs. Oxybiotin, homobiotin, and norbiotin are not catabolized. Several catabolites of biotin have been isolated from incubation mixtures by column and paper chromatography."

https://openalex.org/W2072606273,"The crystal structure of thiamine pyrophosphate has been determined by a three-dimensional x-ray analysis. The conformation of the molecule in the crystalline state is determined by the formal charge distribution within the molecule which exists as a zwitterion with the negative pyrophosphate chain folded back over the positive, ring portion of the molecule. The oxygen atoms in the pyrophosphate group are in the staggered conformation when viewed along the phosphorus-phosphorus axis. Even though the pyrophosphate is present in this compound as the monoionized monoester, the configuration is the same as that present in the inorganic pyrophosphate ion. From a comparison of three different crystal structures containing the thiamine moiety and from studies with atomic models, it seems plausible that the basic molecular conformation observed in this crystal is maintained in the catalytically active molecule. Knowledge of the detailed crystal structure provides new insight into the biochemical mechanism of reactions catalyzed by thiamine pyrophosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1595351795,"Abstract When ovalbumin, poly-l-lysine, poly-l-aspartic acid, or ethylenediamine is added to a biphasic chloroform-methanol-water system containing the Mg(II), Ni(II), or Ca(II) complex of triphosphoinositide or phosphatidylserine, mixed complexes are formed as evidenced by the formation of an interfacial precipitate similar to that observed by Dawson containing phospholipid, metal, and protein or polyamino acid, or by the presence of ethylenediamine in the chloroform-rich phase where it is ordinarily insoluble. Stable mixed complex formation was shown by gel filtration studies. Analysis of complexes before and after gel filtration indicates stable binding of one ethylenediamine per phospholipidmetal unit and weak binding of an additional molecule of the amine. Polylysine is bound to the triphosphoinositide-Ni(II) complex in a 0.64:1 ratio on a weight basis."

https://openalex.org/W1573670961,"Abstract A heat-labile iron-cytochrome c reductase was isolated from Ferrobacillus ferrooxidans by sonic oscillation of the cells at pH 5.5 in the presence of protamine sulfate and purified 20-fold with 10% recovery by successive fractionation of the high speed (144,000 x g) supernatant solution with ammonium sulfate and Sephadex G-200. The enzyme displayed a pH optimum of 5.7 to 6.2 and typical substrate saturation curves with a Km of 2.75 x 10-5 m for cytochrome c and 1.6 x 10-3 m for FeSO4·7H2O. The protein nature of the catalyst was established by its protein content and susceptibility to the proteolytic action of Pronase and to heat. Exposure for 1 min at 100° was sufficient to destroy the activity completely. The most highly purified fraction of iron-cytochrome c reductase contained cytochrome c and apparently nonfunctional cytochrome b. Enzymatic activity, proportional to protein concentration and linear with time, was inhibited by reduced glutathione, p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, and cysteine, but not by atebrin, Amytal, or antimycin A. The inhibition by p-hydroxymercuribenzoate could be entirely reversed by equivalent concentrations of reduced glutathione or cysteine. Reduced cytochrome c, ferric ions, and several other metal ions also inhibited the reductase activity. The close association of the enzyme with the iron oxidase activity of F. ferrooxidans was partially shown by the generally parallel distribution of the two activities in the various fractions resulting from Sephadex treatment and from differential centrifugation. Various attempts to separate the iron oxidase and cytochrome c reductase activities from one another in the less purified fractions were unsuccessful leading to destruction of either both activities or the iron oxidase activity. The most highly purified iron-cytochrome c reductase fraction (F5) possessed no iron oxidase activity and contained a factor that stimulated less purified fractions several-fold in both their cytochrome c oxidase and iron oxidase activities but not in their iron-cytochrome c reductase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2219668891,"Abstract 1. Inactivation of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase on reaction with molecular oxygen was observed. The effect is thought to result from the action of highly reactive oxygen intermediates on the catalytic centers of the enzyme. Hydrogen peroxide, the ultimate product of oxygen utilization in this system, was shown to be a less effective inactivator under certain conditions. 2. Ions of heavy metals, including silver, rapidly and reversibly inactivate the enzyme. Sensitivity to, and degree of inhibition by, metal ions were observed to be greater in the presence of sodium orotate than in the absence of this physiological acceptor. Orotate would appear to induce changes in the catalytic state of this nonheme iron flavoprotein. 3. Further evidence for orotate-induced changes of state was obtained with unactivated enzyme, i.e. enzyme having very low activity for orotate reduction. Under certain conditions the substrate appeared to inhibit reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide oxidase activity. Appreciable activity for reduction of orotate was observed only in the presence of sodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate, confirming a close relationship between changes of state and sensitivity to metal ion inactivation. 4. Studies with a class of artificial electron acceptors, the ditetrazolium salts, indicated complex effects of oxygen on rates of diformazan appearance in aqueous media. Under certain conditions oxygen markedly inhibited the reaction while under other experimental conditions no effect or stimulation was observed. Two separate sites of reaction with ditetrazolium salts are proposed to explain these results. 5. Reactions involving another artificial acceptor, potassium ferricyanide, exhibited apparent turnover numbers far exceeding those of the physiological reactions. In addition, the ferrocyanide-ferricyanide oxidation-reduction couple was found to substitute for oxygen as an intermediate electron carrier in the reduction of cytochrome c. Oxygen, therefore, is not an obligatory mediator of this reaction as catalyzed by dihydroorotate dehydrogenase."
https://openalex.org/W130622469,"Abstract The purine bases hypoxanthine, xanthine, guanine, and purine markedly inhibit epinephrine-induced lipolysis in rat adipose tissue, an action previously ascribed only to nucleosides, nucleotides, and nucleic acids. The inhibition by purines and purine conjugates is associated with increased destruction of epinephrine. Allopurinol, an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase, prevents the degradation of epinephrine and prevents or reduces the inhibition of lipolysis. The stimulatory effect of some purine bases on epinephrine-induced lipolysis is confirmed, and the stimulatory effect is shown to occur in human adipose tissue and in tissue of hypophysectomized and thyroidectomized rats."
https://openalex.org/W111756021,"Abstract An enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of prenol pyrophosphates was extracted from an acetone powder of testicular microsomes. The enzyme was partially purified by chromatography on diethylaminoethyl Sephadex. The partially purified enzyme catalyzed the hydrolysis of the phosphate ester bond of prenol pyrophosphates to yield equimolar amounts of prenol and inorganic pyrophosphate. Cleavage of inorganic pyrophosphate was catalyzed by a contaminating pyrophosphate phosphohydrolase that was present in crude preparations. The partially purified prenol pyrophosphate pyrophosphohydrolase catalyzed the hydrolysis of farnesol pyrophosphate, isopentenol pyrophosphate, and a mixture of biosynthetic 14C-prenol pyrophosphates, but hydrolysis of inorganic pyrophosphate, mevalonate-5-phosphate, β-glycerol phosphate, or adenosine triphosphate was not observed."
https://openalex.org/W1570190665,"Abstract Additional properties of the Ferrobacillus ferrooxidans heat-stable iron-cytochrome c reductase, in view of the doubts of its protein or enzymatic nature, were studied and compared with those of various nucleic acids and their derivatives in enhancing the reduction of cytochrome c by ferrous ions with the following results. Calf thymus deoxyribonucleic acid, salmon sperm DNA, yeast RNA, and the derivatives, RNA core and apurinic acid, enhance the reduction of cytochrome c by ferrous ions at physiological pH values (pH 5.7 to 6.0). The action of these compounds is inhibited by atebrin, reduced glutathione, p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, and cysteine, and also by several metal ions including Fe+++, Co++, Ni++, Cu++, and Zn++. The products of the reaction, namely reduced cytochrome c and ferric ions, inhibited 60 and 100% at concentrations of 8 x 10-5 m and 10-3 m, respectively. All of the above nucleic acids and derivatives showed substrate saturation curves for both reactants with Km values ranging from 10-4 m to 7.5 x 10-4 m for FeSO4·7H2O and from 1.8 x 10-5 m to 8 x 10-5 m for oxidized cytochrome c. In all of the above respects their properties resembled closely those displayed by the heat-stable iron-cytochrome c from F. ferrooxidans. The prolonged action of DNase on calf thymus DNA and on the heat-stable iron-cytochrome c preparation from F. ferrooxidans rendered iron-cytochrome c reducing activity dialyzable but did not destroy it. RNAase had no effect on the F. ferrooxidans preparation but rendered the iron-cytochrome c reductase activity of yeast RNA dialyzable. This evidence indicates that DNA is associated with the heat-stable preparation from F. ferrooxidans. The action of DNAase on serum bovine albumin produced no dialyzable protein, suggesting that no protease is present in the DNAase that could account for its effect. The proteolytic enzyme Pronase partially inhibited the enhancement of cytochrome c reduction by iron with calf thymus DNA and the heat-stable preparation from F. ferrooxidans, an inhibition that could be reversed by heating in a boiling water bath for 5 min followed by rapid cooling. Bovine serum albumin also produced the same heat-reversible inhibition as Pronase suggesting that the inhibitory effect of Pronase in these instances was probably due to its physical binding with the nucleic acid, thus preventing the nucleic acid enhancement of cytochrome c reduction. Treatment by phenol subsequent to Pronase action removed up to 85% of the protein associated with DNA but did not affect the iron-cytochrome c reduction enhancing activity of the nucleic acid. Sonic disintegration of a calf thymus DNA solution for increasing periods of time resulted in a large initial decrease in viscosity followed by a gradual decrease in this property. This pattern of change was closely reflected in the ironcytochrome c reduction enhancing properties of the nucleic acid. Flavin mononucleotide, triphosphopyridine nucleotide, and phosphate ions stimulated the action of nucleic acids and their derivatives as well as the heat-stable preparation from F. ferrooxidans in their capacity to enhance the reduction of cytochrome c by ferrous ions. The inhibition by atebrin could be definitely prevented or reversed by FMN and FAD. The stimulatory effects of FMN, TPN, and phosphate ions were not additive suggesting that they might all react at the same site. In view of the striking similarities of nucleic acids (and their derivatives) and the heat-stable iron-cytochrome c (which apparently contains DNA) from F. ferrooxidans in enhancing the reduction of cytochrome c by ferrous ions, it is tentatively suggested that the activity of the latter is due to its DNA content. Whether this is of physiological significance is not certain at present."

https://openalex.org/W2071875748,"Fibroblast-like cells from human embryonic lung were infected with adenovirus type 12, and they survived as an established line, with the characteristics of ""transformation"" following considerable cellular killing. Inclusion bodies disappeared and cells became resistant to reinfection with type 12 virus as they grew in thick multilayered strands, and giant and syncytial cells became commonplace. An induced new cell antigen demonstrable by complement-fixation and fluorescent-antibody studies persisted for at least 20 culture passages after infection."
https://openalex.org/W1586857651,"Abstract Adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and synthetic peptides with ACTH activity inhibit incorporation of label from acetate-1-14C into adipose tissue protein and fatty acid at concentrations as low as 0.17 milliunit per ml. Growth hormone, thyrotropin, and epinephrine have similar effects at concentrations (w/v) 10 to 2000 times greater. Large concentrations of growth hormone, relative to ACTH, are required, and the activity of growth hormone is abolished by oxidation with sodium periodate (which does not alter somatotropic properties), suggesting that the activity of the preparations is due to a contaminant. ACTH could exert this effect by a number of mechanisms. Of the possibilities tested, ACTH does not act by diluting the labeled acetate pool, by stimulating the accumulation of toxic concentrations of free fatty acid in the tissue, or by directly inhibiting protein synthesis. It is suggested that ACTH inhibits incorporation of label from acetate and other precursors into protein by stimulating their utilization via oxidative pathways, thereby reducing the labeled intermediates available for incorporation into protein or fatty acids. Additional indirect influences upon enzymes for fatty acid synthesis are not excluded."

https://openalex.org/W1486232795,"Abstract The electron spin resonance method has been used to study the effect of pH on the apparent oxidation-reduction potential of heart muscle succinic dehydrogenase over the pH range 6.5 to 8.5. This range lies beyond pKa2 of the substrates, succinate and fumarate, but contains the range of pH where succinic dehydrogenase shows the highest activity in assay systems. The data suggest that dE'0/dpH is 0 ± 3 mv x pH-1. We discuss this finding in connection with the mechanism of action of succinic dehydrogenase under conditions of exchange in the absence of supplementary oxidation-reduction constituents."
https://openalex.org/W1552938799,"Abstract An enzyme preparation from rabbit muscle catalyzes the incorporation of uridine monophosphate into the terminal nucleotide sequence of yeast amino acid transfer ribonucleic acid. Reactants are UTP, Mg++, and transfer RNA which has been partially digested with snake venom phosphodiesterase. Some characteristics of the incorporation system are presented. Incorporation of UMP into tranfer RNA rather than into a different species of RNA was shown by a similar chromatographic profile of the RNA fraction labeled with UMP or with cytidine monophosphate, by competition between UMP and CMP for a limited number of sites in the RNA molecule, and by nearest neighbor analysis. The latter indicated that 2 UMP residues cannot be incorporated as neighbors in a manner similar to the subterminal CMP residues in transfer RNA."

https://openalex.org/W2066530490,"UNDER normal conditions glucose is the major source of muscle glycogen. In muscle, pyruvate and lactate make only a minimal contribution to glycogen but the liver can freely convert these compounds into glycogen1,2. One of the key enzymes in the process of glycogenesis in liver is fructose-l,6-diphosphatase (FDPase)3, and the inability of muscle to convert pyruvate to glycogen was attributed to its absence4,5. Recently, however, Krebs and Wood-ford6 have shown that the enzyme does occur in striated muscle, so that at least one of the energy barriers in the conversion of pyruvate to glycogen is now known to be surmountable."
https://openalex.org/W1511441918,"A series of quinones, including vitamin K1(20), have been shown not to exhibit isotopic hydrogen exchange. This finding is strong evidence against both the hypothesis of quinone methide tautomerism and the suggested occurrence of quinone methide intermediates in oxidative phosphorylation and various chemical reactions. The results of previous studies on duroquinone with the use of nuclear magnetic resonance had been interpreted in terms of hydrogen isotope exchange in basic solution. This interpretation has been shown to be mistaken. The nuclear magnetic resonance results have now been shown to be due to the formation of a free radical in basic solution. The radical was also detected with the use of electron spin resonance spectroscopy. The relevance of these results to the mechanism of oxidative phosphorylation is discussed."
