https://openalex.org/W2883664363,"53BP1 is a chromatin-binding protein that regulates the repair of DNA double-strand breaks by suppressing the nucleolytic resection of DNA termini1,2. This function of 53BP1 requires interactions with PTIP3 and RIF14–9, the latter of which recruits REV7 (also known as MAD2L2) to break sites10,11. How 53BP1-pathway proteins shield DNA ends is currently unknown, but there are two models that provide the best potential explanation of their action. In one model the 53BP1 complex strengthens the nucleosomal barrier to end-resection nucleases12,13, and in the other 53BP1 recruits effector proteins with end-protection activity. Here we identify a 53BP1 effector complex, shieldin, that includes C20orf196 (also known as SHLD1), FAM35A (SHLD2), CTC-534A2.2 (SHLD3) and REV7. Shieldin localizes to double-strand-break sites in a 53BP1- and RIF1-dependent manner, and its SHLD2 subunit binds to single-stranded DNA via OB-fold domains that are analogous to those of RPA1 and POT1. Loss of shieldin impairs non-homologous end-joining, leads to defective immunoglobulin class switching and causes hyper-resection. Mutations in genes that encode shieldin subunits also cause resistance to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibition in BRCA1-deficient cells and tumours, owing to restoration of homologous recombination. Finally, we show that binding of single-stranded DNA by SHLD2 is critical for shieldin function, consistent with a model in which shieldin protects DNA ends to mediate 53BP1-dependent DNA repair. The 53BP1 effector complex shieldin is involved in non-homologous end-joining and immunoglobulin class switching, and acts to protect DNA ends to facilitate the repair of DNA by 53BP1."
https://openalex.org/W2835210520,"Aberration-corrected optics have made electron microscopy at atomic-resolution a widespread and often essential tool for nanocharacterization. Image resolution is dominated by beam energy and the numerical aperture of the lens ({\alpha}), with state-of-the-art reaching ~0.47 {\AA} at 300 keV. Two-dimensional materials are imaged at lower beam energies to avoid knock-on damage, limiting spatial resolution to ~1 {\AA}. Here, by combining a new electron microscope pixel array detector with the dynamic range to record the complete distribution of transmitted electrons and full-field ptychography to recover phase information from the full phase space, we increased the spatial resolution well beyond the traditional lens limitations. At 80 keV beam energy, our ptychographic reconstructions significantly improved image contrast of single-atom defects in MoS2, reaching an information limit close to 5{\alpha}, corresponding to a 0.39 {\AA} Abbe resolution, at the same dose and imaging conditions where conventional imaging modes reach only 0.98 {\AA}."
https://openalex.org/W2883879320,"Thermogenesis by brown and beige adipose tissue, which requires activation by external stimuli, can counter metabolic disease1. Thermogenic respiration is initiated by adipocyte lipolysis through cyclic AMP-protein kinase A signalling; this pathway has been subject to longstanding clinical investigation2-4. Here we apply a comparative metabolomics approach and identify an independent metabolic pathway that controls acute activation of adipose tissue thermogenesis in vivo. We show that substantial and selective accumulation of the tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate succinate is a metabolic signature of adipose tissue thermogenesis upon activation by exposure to cold. Succinate accumulation occurs independently of adrenergic signalling, and is sufficient to elevate thermogenic respiration in brown adipocytes. Selective accumulation of succinate may be driven by a capacity of brown adipocytes to sequester elevated circulating succinate. Furthermore, brown adipose tissue thermogenesis can be initiated by systemic administration of succinate in mice. Succinate from the extracellular milieu is rapidly metabolized by brown adipocytes, and its oxidation by succinate dehydrogenase is required for activation of thermogenesis. We identify a mechanism whereby succinate dehydrogenase-mediated oxidation of succinate initiates production of reactive oxygen species, and drives thermogenic respiration, whereas inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase supresses thermogenesis. Finally, we show that pharmacological elevation of circulating succinate drives UCP1-dependent thermogenesis by brown adipose tissue in vivo, which stimulates robust protection against diet-induced obesity and improves glucose tolerance. These findings reveal an unexpected mechanism for control of thermogenesis, using succinate as a systemically-derived thermogenic molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2884934298,"Gram-negative bacteria possess a complex cell envelope that consists of a plasma membrane, a peptidoglycan cell wall and an outer membrane. The envelope is a selective chemical barrier1 that defines cell shape2 and allows the cell to sustain large mechanical loads such as turgor pressure3. It is widely believed that the covalently cross-linked cell wall underpins the mechanical properties of the envelope4,5. Here we show that the stiffness and strength of Escherichia coli cells are largely due to the outer membrane. Compromising the outer membrane, either chemically or genetically, greatly increased deformation of the cell envelope in response to stretching, bending and indentation forces, and induced increased levels of cell lysis upon mechanical perturbation and during L-form proliferation. Both lipopolysaccharides and proteins contributed to the stiffness of the outer membrane. These findings overturn the prevailing dogma that the cell wall is the dominant mechanical element within Gram-negative bacteria, instead demonstrating that the outer membrane can be stiffer than the cell wall, and that mechanical loads are often balanced between these structures."
https://openalex.org/W2884558319,"Diabetes is a complex metabolic syndrome that is characterized by prolonged high blood glucose levels and frequently associated with life-threatening complications1,2. Epidemiological studies have suggested that diabetes is also linked to an increased risk of cancer3-5. High glucose levels may be a prevailing factor that contributes to the link between diabetes and cancer, but little is known about the molecular basis of this link and how the high glucose state may drive genetic and/or epigenetic alterations that result in a cancer phenotype. Here we show that hyperglycaemic conditions have an adverse effect on the DNA 5-hydroxymethylome. We identify the tumour suppressor TET2 as a substrate of the AMP-activated kinase (AMPK), which phosphorylates TET2 at serine 99, thereby stabilizing the tumour suppressor. Increased glucose levels impede AMPK-mediated phosphorylation at serine 99, which results in the destabilization of TET2 followed by dysregulation of both 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and the tumour suppressive function of TET2 in vitro and in vivo. Treatment with the anti-diabetic drug metformin protects AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of serine 99, thereby increasing TET2 stability and 5hmC levels. These findings define a novel 'phospho-switch' that regulates TET2 stability and a regulatory pathway that links glucose and AMPK to TET2 and 5hmC, which connects diabetes to cancer. Our data also unravel an epigenetic pathway by which metformin mediates tumour suppression. Thus, this study presents a new model for how a pernicious environment can directly reprogram the epigenome towards an oncogenic state, offering a potential strategy for cancer prevention and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2883789961,"In DNA repair, the resection of double-strand breaks dictates the choice between homology-directed repair-which requires a 3' overhang-and classical non-homologous end joining, which can join unresected ends1,2. BRCA1-mutant cancers show minimal resection of double-strand breaks, which renders them deficient in homology-directed repair and sensitive to inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1)3-8. When BRCA1 is absent, the resection of double-strand breaks is thought to be prevented by 53BP1, RIF1 and the REV7-SHLD1-SHLD2-SHLD3 (shieldin) complex, and loss of these factors diminishes sensitivity to PARP1 inhibitors4,6-9. Here we address the mechanism by which 53BP1-RIF1-shieldin regulates the generation of recombinogenic 3' overhangs. We report that CTC1-STN1-TEN1 (CST)10, a complex similar to replication protein A that functions as an accessory factor of polymerase-α (Polα)-primase11, is a downstream effector in the 53BP1 pathway. CST interacts with shieldin and localizes with Polα to sites of DNA damage in a 53BP1- and shieldin-dependent manner. As with loss of 53BP1, RIF1 or shieldin, the depletion of CST leads to increased resection. In BRCA1-deficient cells, CST blocks RAD51 loading and promotes the efficacy of PARP1 inhibitors. In addition, Polα inhibition diminishes the effect of PARP1 inhibitors. These data suggest that CST-Polα-mediated fill-in helps to control the repair of double-strand breaks by 53BP1, RIF1 and shieldin."
https://openalex.org/W2883657705,"BRCA1 deficiencies cause breast, ovarian, prostate and other cancers, and render tumours hypersensitive to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. To understand the resistance mechanisms, we conducted whole-genome CRISPR–Cas9 synthetic-viability/resistance screens in BRCA1-deficient breast cancer cells treated with PARP inhibitors. We identified two previously uncharacterized proteins, C20orf196 and FAM35A, whose inactivation confers strong PARP-inhibitor resistance. Mechanistically, we show that C20orf196 and FAM35A form a complex, ‘Shieldin’ (SHLD1/2), with FAM35A interacting with single-stranded DNA through its C-terminal oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding fold region. We establish that Shieldin acts as the downstream effector of 53BP1/RIF1/MAD2L2 to promote DNA double-strand break (DSB) end-joining by restricting DSB resection and to counteract homologous recombination by antagonizing BRCA2/RAD51 loading in BRCA1-deficient cells. Notably, Shieldin inactivation further sensitizes BRCA1-deficient cells to cisplatin, suggesting how defining the SHLD1/2 status of BRCA1-deficient tumours might aid patient stratification and yield new treatment opportunities. Highlighting this potential, we document reduced SHLD1/2 expression in human breast cancers displaying intrinsic or acquired PARP-inhibitor resistance. Through CRISPR–Cas9 screen, Dev et al. identified that SHLD1/2 inhibition contributes to PARP-inhibitor resistance. Mechanistically, SHLDs promote non-homologous end-joining and antagonize homologous recombination."

https://openalex.org/W2884767481,"The thymus is responsible for generating a diverse yet self-tolerant pool of T cells1. Although the thymic medulla consists mostly of developing and mature AIRE+ epithelial cells, recent evidence has suggested that there is far greater heterogeneity among medullary thymic epithelial cells than was previously thought2. Here we describe in detail an epithelial subset that is remarkably similar to peripheral tuft cells that are found at mucosal barriers3. Similar to the periphery, thymic tuft cells express the canonical taste transduction pathway and IL-25. However, they are unique in their spatial association with cornified aggregates, ability to present antigens and expression of a broad diversity of taste receptors. Some thymic tuft cells pass through an Aire-expressing stage and depend on a known AIRE-binding partner, HIPK2, for their development. Notably, the taste chemosensory protein TRPM5 is required for their thymic function through which they support the development and polarization of thymic invariant natural killer T cells and act to establish a medullary microenvironment that is enriched in the type 2 cytokine, IL-4. These findings indicate that there is a compartmentalized medullary environment in which differentiation of a minor and highly specialized epithelial subset has a non-redundant role in shaping thymic function."
https://openalex.org/W2883104324,"Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) has a marked propensity to metastasize to the central nervous system (CNS). In contrast to brain metastases from solid tumours, metastases of ALL seldom involve the parenchyma but are isolated to the leptomeninges, which is an infrequent site for carcinomatous invasion. Although metastasis to the CNS occurs across all subtypes of ALL, a unifying mechanism for invasion has not yet been determined. Here we show that ALL cells in the circulation are unable to breach the blood-brain barrier in mice; instead, they migrate into the CNS along vessels that pass directly between vertebral or calvarial bone marrow and the subarachnoid space. The basement membrane of these bridging vessels is enriched in laminin, which is known to coordinate pathfinding of neuronal progenitor cells in the CNS. The laminin receptor α6 integrin is expressed in most cases of ALL. We found that α6 integrin-laminin interactions mediated the migration of ALL cells towards the cerebrospinal fluid in vitro. Mice with ALL xenografts were treated with either a PI3Kδ inhibitor, which decreased α6 integrin expression on ALL cells, or specific α6 integrin-neutralizing antibodies and showed significant reductions in ALL transit along bridging vessels, blast counts in the cerebrospinal fluid and CNS disease symptoms despite minimally decreased bone marrow disease burden. Our data suggest that α6 integrin expression, which is common in ALL, allows cells to use neural migratory pathways to invade the CNS."

https://openalex.org/W2884717101,"Tissue-specific autoimmunity occurs when selected antigens presented by susceptible alleles of the major histocompatibility complex are recognized by T cells. However, the reason why certain specific self-antigens dominate the response and are indispensable for triggering autoreactivity is unclear. Spontaneous presentation of insulin is essential for initiating autoimmune type 1 diabetes in non-obese diabetic mice1,2. A major set of pathogenic CD4 T cells specifically recognizes the 12–20 segment of the insulin B-chain (B:12–20), an epitope that is generated from direct presentation of insulin peptides by antigen-presenting cells3,4. These T cells do not respond to antigen-presenting cells that have taken up insulin that, after processing, leads to presentation of a different segment representing a one-residue shift, B:13–214. CD4 T cells that recognize B:12–20 escape negative selection in the thymus and cause diabetes, whereas those that recognize B:13–21 have only a minor role in autoimmunity3–5. Although presentation of B:12–20 is evident in the islets3,6, insulin-specific germinal centres can be formed in various lymphoid tissues, suggesting that insulin presentation is widespread7,8. Here we use live imaging to document the distribution of insulin recognition by CD4 T cells throughout various lymph nodes. Furthermore, we identify catabolized insulin peptide fragments containing defined pathogenic epitopes in β-cell granules from mice and humans. Upon glucose challenge, these fragments are released into the circulation and are recognized by CD4 T cells, leading to an activation state that results in transcriptional reprogramming and enhanced diabetogenicity. Therefore, a tissue such as pancreatic islets, by releasing catabolized products, imposes a constant threat to self-tolerance. These findings reveal a self-recognition pathway underlying a primary autoantigen and provide a foundation for assessing antigenic targets that precipitate pathogenic outcomes by systemically sensitizing lymphoid tissues. A sensitive T cell tracking assay reveals immunogenic activity of specific catabolized peptide fragments of insulin and their effects on T cell activity in lymph nodes, highlighting communication between pancreatic islets and lymphoid tissue."

Each step was analyzed microscopically and spectroscopically. The produced coreshell particles were between 40 and 45nm and these coreshell particles were utilized for drug delivery studies against cervical cancer cell line-HeLa cells.

https://openalex.org/W2882986453,"The TIFY proteins constitute a plant-specific super-family and they are involved in regulating many plant processes, such as development, defences and stress responses. The Jasmonate-ZIM-Domain (JAZ) proteins, the best-characterized sub-group of the TIFY family are key regulator of the jasmonic acid (JA) signalling pathway. Jasmonates regulate several aspects of plant development, and play a primary role in defence mechanisms as well as in plant responses to abiotic stresses. The TIFY family is well studied in dicots but poorly investigated in monocots. The present study reports an extensive genomic identification of TIFY proteins from Triticum aestivum. We identified 49 TIFY genes, which were annotated according to three sub-genomes (AABBDD) of T. aestivum. Following their clustering with Oryza sativa and Brachypodium distachyon, the 49 genes were grouped in 18 different TIFY homeologous subsets. Expression analyses of 6 representative TIFY genes on Tunisian durum wheat seedlings revealed their differential regulation by various stress treatment, including JA, ABA and salt stress. TIFY11a was specifically induced after salt treatment. Transgenic lines over-expressing TdTIFY11a showed higher germination and growth rates under high salinity conditions, compared to wild type plants. In summary, our results outline a relevant role of wheat TIFY proteins in promoting germination under salt stress."
https://openalex.org/W2884453662,"Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) catalyzes the breakdown of circulating triglycerides in muscle and fat. LPL is inhibited by several proteins, including angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4), and may be cleaved by members of the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin (PCSK) family. Here, we aimed to investigate the cleavage of LPL in adipocytes by PCSKs and study the potential involvement of ANGPTL4. A substantial portion of LPL in mouse and human adipose tissue was cleaved into N- and C-terminal fragments. Treatment of different adipocytes with the PCSK inhibitor decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethyl ketone markedly decreased LPL cleavage, indicating that LPL is cleaved by PCSKs. Silencing of Pcsk3/furin significantly decreased LPL cleavage in cell culture medium and lysates of 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Remarkably, PCSK-mediated cleavage of LPL in adipocytes was diminished by Angptl4 silencing and was decreased in adipocytes and adipose tissue of Angptl4−/− mice. Differences in LPL cleavage between Angptl4−/− and WT mice were abrogated by treatment with decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethyl ketone. Induction of ANGPTL4 in adipose tissue during fasting enhanced PCSK-mediated LPL cleavage, concurrent with decreased LPL activity, in WT but not Angptl4−/− mice. In adipocytes, after removal of cell surface LPL by heparin, levels of N-terminal LPL were still markedly higher in WT compared with Angptl4−/− adipocytes, suggesting that stimulation of PCSK-mediated LPL cleavage by ANGPTL4 occurs intracellularly. Finally, treating adipocytes with insulin increased full-length LPL and decreased N-terminal LPL in an ANGPTL4-dependent manner. In conclusion, ANGPTL4 promotes PCSK-mediated intracellular cleavage of LPL in adipocytes, likely contributing to regulation of LPL in adipose tissue. Our data provide further support for an intracellular action of ANGPTL4 in adipocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2883577337,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) degradation-enhancing α-mannosidase–like 1 protein (EDEM1) is a protein quality control factor that was initially proposed to recognize N-linked glycans on misfolded proteins through its mannosidase-like domain (MLD). However, recent studies have demonstrated that EDEM1 binds to some misfolded proteins in a glycan-independent manner, suggesting a more complex binding landscape for EDEM1. In this study, we have identified a thiol-dependent substrate interaction between EDEM1 and the α1-antitrypsin ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) clients Z and NHK, specifically through the single Cys residue on Z/NHK (Cys256), required for binding under stringent detergent conditions. In addition to the thiol-dependent interaction, the presence of weaker protein-protein interactions was confirmed, suggestive of bipartite client-binding properties. About four reactive thiols on EDEM1 were identified and were not directly responsible for the observed redox-sensitive binding by EDEM1. Moreover, a protein construct comprising the EDEM1 MLD had thiol-dependent binding properties along with its active glycan-trimming activities. Lastly, we identified an additional intrinsically disordered region (IDR) located at the C terminus of EDEM1 in addition to its previously identified N-terminal IDR. We also determined that both IDRs are required for binding to the ERAD component ERdj5 as an interaction with ERdj5 was not observed with the MLD alone.

Additionally, attempts to ascertain on which glycan branch EDEM1 acts have been conducted by determining the glycan profile of cells in which EDEM1 was overexpressed or knocked out, but in vitro analyses using recombinant EDEM1 or its MLD are lacking, likely due to difficulty in expressing recombinant EDEM1 and its MLD (17Ninagawa S.

EDEM1 has been implicated to play a role in ERAD and function in the ER lumen; however, how the protein is retained in the ER lumen remains undetermined. EDEM1 exhibits dual topology as a result of inefficient cleavage of its signal peptide, which yields a membrane-bound protein that is able to act on membrane-associated ERAD clients (19Tamura T. Cormier J.H. Hebert D.N. Characterization of early EDEM1 protein maturation events and their functional implications.J. Biol.

However, EDEM1 also exists as a soluble luminal protein that remains in the ER but lacks a known ER retention/retrieval sequence. EDEM1 interacts with numerous ER-localized binding partners and is proposed to exist in a multiprotein complex, which may mediate its ER retention, although this has yet to be shown. The client- or machinery-binding properties of EDEM1 appear multifaceted and specific to each binding partner. For instance, Lederkremer and co-workers (20Shenkman M. Groisman B. Ron E. Avezov E. Hendershot L.M. Lederkremer G.Z. A shared endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathway involving the EDEM1 protein for glycosylated and nonglycosylated proteins.J. Biol.

Petrescu and co-workers (21Marin M.B. Ghenea S. Spiridon L.N. Chiritoiu G.N. Petrescu A.-J. Petrescu S.-M. Tyrosinase degradation is prevented when EDEM1 lacks the intrinsically disordered region.PLoS One. 2012; 7 (22905195): e4299810.1371/journal.pone.0042998Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) identified an N-terminal IDR that is required for interaction with an unnatural soluble form of tyrosinase, further supporting the nonessential role of the MLD in the interaction between EDEM1 and H2a or soluble tyrosinase. Likewise, the role of glycans in EDEM1 client binding is perplexing and appears substrate-specific as in some cases (NHK, H2a, and SHH) interactions with EDEM1 were independent of substrate glycosylation; however, in other cases glycans appeared required (BACE457) (10Cormier J.H.

Interactions between EDEM1 and ER machinery-binding partners have been reported and characterized, most notably that the EDEM1 MLD was involved in the interaction with Sel1L as mutating the putative catalytic triad or using mannosidase inhibitors abolished this interaction (10Cormier J.H. Tamura T. Sunryd J.C. Hebert D.N. EDEM1 recognition and delivery of misfolded proteins to the SEL1L-containing ERAD complex.Mol.

Combined, these results illustrate a much more complex binding landscape of EDEM1 that involves distinct protein-dependent modes of interactions. In this study, we have identified bimodal interactions between EDEM1 and the α1-antitrypsin (A1AT) disease-associated and ERAD variants Z and NHK. The interactions between EDEM1 and Z/NHK involve covalent and weaker protein-protein interactions that were identified under different detergent conditions. We also provide evidence that the MLD of EDEM1 possesses glycosidase activity. Altogether, these findings broaden the scope of the EDEM substrate-binding properties and provide further evidence supporting cellular mannosidase activity of the EDEM1 MLD. EDEM1 preferentially interacts with misfolded A1AT variants NHK and Z in a glycan-independent manner (10Cormier J.H. Tamura T. Sunryd J.C. Hebert D.N. EDEM1 recognition and delivery of misfolded proteins to the SEL1L-containing ERAD complex.Mol. Cell. 2009; 34 (19524542): 627-63310.1016/j.molcel.2009.05.018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Given the oxidative nature of the ER lumen, we determined whether this preferential interaction is oxidation-dependent. A pulse-chase experiment was performed to compare the protein interactions in the absence or presence of the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT) (Fig. 1A). EDEM1-FLAG was coexpressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells with wildtype (WT) A1AT, Z, or NHK. The proteins were radiolabeled for 30 min followed by a 15-min chase to allow EDEM1 to reach its mature folded state. A 30-min chase with or without 5 mm DTT was performed (+/− lanes) following the initial 15-min chase (Fig. 1A). Cells were lysed with 0.5% Triton X-100 (TX) in MNT buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mm MES, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)) or with 2% CHAPS (CH) in HBS (50 mm HEPES, 200 mm NaCl (pH 7.5)). Cell lysates were divided into equal fractions and subjected to anti-A1AT (Fig. 1A, lanes 1–12) and anti-FLAG (Fig. 1A, lanes 13–24) immunoprecipitations. Immunoprecipitations obtained from “TX” lysates were washed under stringent buffer conditions containing 0.1% SDS, whereas those obtained from “CH” lysates were washed under milder conditions using 0.5% CHAPS. The DTT treatment did not affect the maturation or secretion of WT A1AT as the protein appears to have reached its mature state as indicated by the presence of complex sugars acquired in the Golgi as demonstrated by the higher molecular weight species (Fig. 1A, lanes 1–4). Additionally, the DTT treatment did not appear to affect the inherent binding properties of EDEM1 as it did not bind to WT A1AT regardless of the of the addition of DTT using either TX/SDS or CHAPS washes (Fig. 1A, lanes 1–4 and 13–16). Under mild detergent conditions (CHAPS), the interaction between EDEM1 and NHK (Fig. 1A, lanes 5, 6, 17, and 18) or Z (Fig. 1A, lanes 9, 10, 21, and 22) was maintained regardless of whether DTT was added. However, under stringent detergent conditions (TX/SDS), the interaction between EDEM1 and NHK (Fig. 1A, lanes 7, 8, 19, and 20) or Z (Fig. 1A, lanes 11, 12, 23, and 24) was disrupted upon addition of DTT, indicating the presence of an oxidation requirement as well as the involvement of weaker protein-protein interactions. WT A1AT and the misfolded variants NHK and Z possess a single cysteine (Cys) residue at position 256 and three N-linked glycosylation sites (Fig. 1B). We have previously determined that the interaction between EDEM1 and NHK is glycan-independent under stringent detergent conditions (10Cormier J.H. Tamura T. Sunryd J.C. Hebert D.N. EDEM1 recognition and delivery of misfolded proteins to the SEL1L-containing ERAD complex.Mol. Cell. 2009; 34 (19524542): 627-63310.1016/j.molcel.2009.05.018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). It was next determined whether the interaction between A1AT and EDEM1 involved A1AT Cys256. C256S mutants of Z and NHK were generated and tested for their binding to EDEM1 (Fig. 1C). EDEM1-FLAG was coexpressed in HEK293T cells with WT A1AT, Z, Z C256S, NHK, or NHK C256S. The proteins were radiolabeled for 30 min followed by 1-h chase. Cells were lysed in MNT buffer and washed in buffer containing 0.1% SDS. EDEM1 no longer interacted with Z or NHK when the Cys was mutated to a Ser (Fig. 1C, lanes 21–24), suggesting that the previously observed covalent-like interaction between the misfolded A1AT ERAD variants and EDEM1 involved the single Cys256 from A1AT. To determine whether the interaction between EDEM1 and NHK or Z involves reactive thiols or unpaired Cys on EDEM1, we conducted an in-cell maleimide modification assay using methoxy polyethylene glycol maleimide (PEG-maleimide) (Fig. 2A). HEK293T cells were transfected with EDEM1-FLAG, and a 1-h DTT pretreatment was added to designated dishes. Cells were lysed in sample buffer containing 5 mm PEG-maleimide (+PEG-maleimide) or 20 mm NEM (−PEG-maleimide) to modify reactive thiols. Human EDEM1 possesses eight Cys residues that are well conserved across metazoan species (Fig. S1A). All eight Cys were modified upon treatment with PEG-maleimide following DTT pretreatment (Fig. 2A, compare mobility shift between lanes 3 and 4). However, under oxidizing conditions (−DTT pretreatment), approximately half of the Cys were accessible to maleimide modification (Fig. 2A, compare lane 2 with lanes 1, 3, and 4) as the modified protein migrates slower than the unmodified but faster than the fully modified sample, indicating that a subset of the Cys on EDEM1 was accessible and reactive at steady state. The oxidized and maleimide-modified sample (Fig. 2A, lane 2) was compared with a series of EDEM1 constructs on which a single Cys-to-Ser mutation was generated to obtain EDEM1 comprising seven, six, five, and four total Cys residues (Fig. S1B). The number of accessible and reactive Cys on EDEM1 under oxidizing conditions can be estimated as 4 as the protein migrates at approximately the same level as EDEM1 with four Cys on SDS-PAGE (Fig. S1B, compare lane 2 with lane 3). Furthermore, modeling of the conserved EDEM1 MLD predicts that four of the Cys are in sufficient proximity to form two disulfide bonds (Cys160–Cys529 and Cys410–Cys457) (Fig. 2B, left panel). The two remaining Cys in the MLD (Cys302 and Cys555) might act as free thiols. There are two additional Cys found outside the predicted mannosidase domain, one N-terminal and the other C-terminal, which could pair up with each other or with Cys302 or Cys555 or remain free thiols. This information was used to derive a predicted disulfide map of EDEM1 (Fig. 2B, right panel). We next sought to identify the reactive thiols at steady state using the maleimide modification assay and monitoring the mobility shifts of each sample under oxidizing conditions compared with that of WT EDEM1 (Fig. 2C). Combinational Cys-to-Ser mutants of the predicted reactive Cys (C95S/C302S, C555S/C629S, C95S/C302S/C629S, and C95S/C302S/C555S/C629S) were generated and transfected in HEK293T cells. Proteins were subjected to PEG-maleimide modification under reducing (+DTT pretreatment) and nonreducing (−DTT pretreatment) conditions. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblotting. The resulting blots were positioned such that the reduced protein samples in each condition were aligned (Fig. 2C, lanes 1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 10, 13, 15, 17, and 19). The mobility shifts of the oxidized and maleimide-labeled combinational mutants C95S/C302S and C95S/C302S/C629S were compared with WT EDEM1 (Fig. 2C, compare lanes 6 and 14 with lane 3), and in both instances the proteins migrated faster through the gel with the triple mutant migrating the fastest, indicating that these constructs possess fewer accessible thiols than the WT protein, likely two and one, respectively. The same analysis was performed with constructs in which Cys555 was mutated to Ser (C555S/C629S and C95S/C302S/C555S/C629S); however, both mutations resulted in a smear when labeled with PEG-maleimide under oxidizing conditions (Fig. 2C, lanes 11 and 18). The same result was obtained with the single C555S point mutant (data not shown), which may implicate Cys555 in forming transient intermediate disulfides, perhaps as the resolving Cys residue, which when mutated to a Ser results in mixed disulfide species. The interaction between EDEM1 comprising single Cys-to-Ser mutations and NHK was maintained under stringent detergent conditions (Fig. S2), indicating that a single EDEM1 Cys residue was not solely responsible for maintaining the interaction. We then determined whether the reactive thiols contributed to the thiol-dependent interaction that was observed under stringent detergent conditions. To this end, WT EDEM1-FLAG, C95S/C302S/C629S, and C95S/C302S/C555S/C629S were coexpressed with A1AT WT, Z, and NHK (Fig. 2D). The EDEM1-FLAG C95S/C302S/C629S and C95S/C302S/C555S/C629S constructs both coimmunoprecipitated with Z and NHK as observed by the presence of EDEM1-FLAG protein (Fig. 2D, lanes 5, 6, 8, and 9 compared with WT in lanes 1, 4, and 7) with the anti-A1AT immunoprecipitation. These interactions were verified using anti-FLAG immunoprecipitations where the presence of Z and NHK was observed with the EDEM1 pulldowns (Fig. 2D, lanes 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, and 18 compared with WT in lanes 10, 13, and 16). Similar to the WT EDEM1, EDEM1-FLAG C95S/C302S/C629S and C95S/C302S/C555S/C629S exhibit preferential interaction with ERAD clients as neither protein interacted with ATAT WT (Fig. 2D, lanes 10, 13, and 16). Taken together, EDEM1-FLAG possesses multiple reactive thiols as Cys at positions 95, 302, 555, and 629 appear unpaired and accessible to maleimide modification at steady state; however, these residues do not appear to mediate the thiol-dependent interaction that was observed between EDEM1 and NHK/Z. Previous studies by Petrescu and co-workers (21Marin M.B. Ghenea S. Spiridon L.N. Chiritoiu G.N. Petrescu A.-J. Petrescu S.-M.

Each algorithm, with the exception of one, identified two regions that are predicted as IDRs, located at the N and C termini of the protein (Fig. S3A, left panel). These IDRs constitute the bulk of the sequence flanking the MLD, making them potential modes of interaction between EDEM1 and ER quality control machinery or other possible ERAD clients. To investigate the role of the EDEM1 IDRs in localization and to determine whether a construct comprised solely of the MLD lacking both IDRs remains ER-localized, we generated constructs lacking either IDRs (ΔIDR(N) and ΔIDR(C)) or both (MLD), which comprises the mannosidase-like domain alone (Fig. S3A, right panel).

https://openalex.org/W2883100888,"Background India has a high prevalence of tuberculosis (TB) as well as diabetes mellitus (DM). DM is a chronic disease caused by deficiency of insulin production by the pancreas. The risk of TB amongst DM patients is three times higher than those without. The estimated national prevalence of DM is 7.3%. Despite the growing burden of DM, there are limited studies describing the prevalence of TB-DM in India. Objective Our study estimated the prevalence of DM amongst adult hospitalized TB patients at Kasturba Hospital, Manipal and determined factors associated with the likelihood of DM-TB co-prevalence. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study at Kasturba Hospital, Manipal Academy of Higher Education. All hospitalized adult patients diagnosed with pulmonary TB (PTB) and extrapulmonary TB (EPTB) between June 1st 2015 and June 30th 2016 were eligible for inclusion. Pediatric and pregnant TB patients were excluded from our study. Data were extracted from medical charts. Descriptive and multivariate analyses were performed in R. Multivariate analysis adjusted for age, gender, type of TB, history of TB, and nutrition (body mass index (BMI)) status. Results A total of 728 patients met the eligibility criteria, 517 (71%) were male, 210 (29%) female, 406 (56%) had PTB and 322 (44%) had EPTB. Amongst those with a nutritional status, 36 (30%) patients were underweight (BMI <18.4 kg/m2), 73 (40%) had a normal BMI (18.5kg/m2–24.9 kg/m2), 15 (8%) were overweight (BMI 25.0 kg/m2–29.9 kg/m2) and 9 (5%) were obese (BMI >30.0 kg/m2). A total of 720 (98.9%) of TB patients had at least one blood sugar test result. The overall prevalence of DM (n = 184) amongst TB patients was 25.3% (95% CI 22.2%, 28.6%). When stratified, it was 35.0% (30.4%, 39.9%) and 13.0% (9.7%, 17.3%) amongst PTB and EPTB patients respectively. TB patients aged 41–60 years had 3.51 times higher odds (aOR 3.51 (2.08, 6.07)) of having DM than patients 40 years or younger. Patients aged 60 years or older had 2.49 times higher odds (aOR 2.49 (1.28, 4.85)) of having DM than younger patients (<40 years). Females had lower odds (aOR 0.80 (0.46, 1.37)) of developing DM than male TB patients and patients with a history of TB had lower odds (aOR 0.73 (0.39, 1.32)) than newly diagnosed TB patients. Additionally, EPTB patients had significantly lower odds (aOR 0.26 (0.15, 0.43)) compared to PTB patients. Underweight patients also had significantly lower odds (aOR 0.25 (0.14, 0.42)) of having DM than normal weight patients. Conclusion Our study found a higher prevalence of TB-DM than the national average. TB-DM co-prevalence was significantly associated with age, type of TB and undernutrition. As India’s DM prevalence is expected to rise, TB-DM will become an increasingly important part of the TB epidemic requiring specialized study and care."
https://openalex.org/W2884499324,"Stress-induced strand breaks in rRNA have been observed in many organisms, but the mechanisms by which they originate are not well-understood. Here we show that a chemical rather than an enzymatic mechanism initiates rRNA cleavages during oxidative stress in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). We used cells lacking the mitochondrial glutaredoxin Grx5 to demonstrate that oxidant-induced cleavage formation in 25S rRNA correlates with intracellular iron levels. Sequestering free iron by chemical or genetic means decreased the extent of rRNA degradation and relieved the hypersensitivity of grx5Δ cells to the oxidants. Importantly, subjecting purified ribosomes to an in vitro iron/ascorbate reaction precisely recapitulated the 25S rRNA cleavage pattern observed in cells, indicating that redox activity of the ribosome-bound iron is responsible for the strand breaks in the rRNA. In summary, our findings provide evidence that oxidative stress–associated rRNA cleavages can occur through rRNA strand scission by redox-active, ribosome-bound iron that potentially promotes Fenton reaction–induced hydroxyl radical production, implicating intracellular iron as a key determinant of the effects of oxidative stress on ribosomes.

Oxidative damage to rRNA has been hypothesized to play a role in neurodegenerative disease (5Ding Q. Markesbery W.R. Cecarini V. Keller J.N.

However, despite the central role of the ribosome in protein synthesis, our understanding of the impact of ROS on ribosome functions is still very limited. reactive oxygen species dihydroethidium iron–sulfur cluster 1,2-phenanthroline deferoxamine 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthrolinedisulfonic acid. In our previous work (7Shedlovskiy D. Zinskie J.A. Gardner E. Pestov D.G. Shcherbik N. Endonucleolytic cleavage in the expansion segment 7 of 25S rRNA is an early marker of low-level oxidative stress in yeast.J. Biol.

One prominent cleavage, located in the ES7 region of 25S rRNA in the large (60S) ribosomal subunit, starts at early stages of the adaptive oxidative stress response that helps cells to cope with ROS accumulation. The ES7 region is located on the surface of the 60S subunit and is one of the largest rRNA expansion clusters in the eukaryotic ribosome (8Ben-Shem A. Garreau de Loubresse N. Melnikov S. Jenner L. Yusupova G. Yusupov M. The structure of the eukaryotic ribosome at 3.0 Å resolution.Science. 2011; 334 (10.1126/science.1212642 22096102): 1524-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar, 9Melnikov S. Ben-Shem A.

ES7-cleaved ribosomes are capable of reinitiating translation, suggesting that this type of rRNA cleavage does not inactivate ribosomes and may instead play a role in modulating their function during stress (7Shedlovskiy D. Zinskie J.A. Gardner E. Pestov D.G. Shcherbik N. Endonucleolytic cleavage in the expansion segment 7 of 25S rRNA is an early marker of low-level oxidative stress in yeast.J. Biol.

Aside from adaptable oxidative stress conditions, excessive ROS accumulation is a hallmark feature of apoptosis (10Perrone G.G. Tan S.-X. Dawes I.W.

Induction of programmed cell death in various organisms has been shown to involve degradation of rRNA, presumably carried out by nucleases activated as part of apoptotic mechanisms (12Erental A. Kalderon Z. Saada A. Smith Y. Engelberg-Kulka H.

The identity of eukaryotic ribonucleases that initiate ribosome degradation during programmed cell death has remained uncertain. In this study, we took advantage of the rapid yeast rRNA analysis techniques we developed recently (15Shedlovskiy D. Shcherbik N. Pestov D.G. One-step hot formamide extraction of RNA from Saccharomyces cerevisiae.RNA Biol. 2017; 14 (10.1080/15476286.2017.1345417 28692404): 1722-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) to survey genes encoding ribonucleases and proteins with function in redox regulation for possible effects on the ES7 cleavage in 25S rRNA. Unexpectedly, we found that the cellular control of iron but not ROS levels was the major determining factor in rRNA fragmentation during oxidative stress. Genetic and biochemical analyses confirmed that oxidant-induced cleavage of yeast rRNA is a nonenzymatic, iron-dependent process. Our results identify a previously unknown mechanism of site-specific changes in the ribosome that may have a biologically significant role in diverse oxidative stress conditions and during programmed cell death. Previously, we identified cleavage in the expansion segment ES7 of the 25S rRNA as one of early molecular responses to elevated ROS levels in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae (7Shedlovskiy D. Zinskie J.A. Gardner E. Pestov D.G. Shcherbik N. Endonucleolytic cleavage in the expansion segment 7 of 25S rRNA is an early marker of low-level oxidative stress in yeast.J. Biol.

To better understand cellular factors that affect ES7 cleavage, we screened a panel of ∼150 yeast strains deficient for antioxidant and oxidative stress–related genes as well as genes that encode various RNases. After growing cells to mid-log phase, we induced oxidative stress with low doses of inorganic peroxide (H2O2, 0.25 mm) or the redox-cycling agent menadione (vitamin K3, 50 μm) and isolated total RNA from the cells (15Shedlovskiy D. Shcherbik N. Pestov D.G. One-step hot formamide extraction of RNA from Saccharomyces cerevisiae.RNA Biol. 2017; 14 (10.1080/15476286.2017.1345417 28692404): 1722-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows a representative set of five strains that were either left untreated or treated with the oxidants and compared with the WT BY4741 control. A number of deletion strains in our test panel showed increased accumulation of stress-induced RNA fragments, including products of ES7 cleavage in 25S rRNA (7Shedlovskiy D. Zinskie J.A. Gardner E. Pestov D.G. Shcherbik N. Endonucleolytic cleavage in the expansion segment 7 of 25S rRNA is an early marker of low-level oxidative stress in yeast.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292 (10.1074/jbc.M117.800003 28939771): 18469-18485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), consistent with the involvement of multiple antioxidant systems in the cellular neutralization of ROS. To compare the strength of this phenotype in different strains, we performed Northern hybridizations with the probe y540, which detects both full-length 25S rRNA and the well-resolved 5′ fragment (∼600 nt) produced by ES7 cleavage (Fig. 1B) and determined the ES7 fragment/25S ratio in each lane (Fig. 1C). Control measurements in biological replicates showed that using this ratio minimizes variations resulting from loading and strain-specific differences in rRNA content. Among all tested mutants, deletion of the monothiol glutaredoxin gene GRX5 led to a particularly strong loss of rRNA stability in response to both H2O2 and menadione (Fig. 1C). To ensure that the observed 25S rRNA degradation phenotype was due to lack of GRX5 rather than any secondary mutations that may have accumulated in a passaged knockout library strain, we backcrossed grx5Δ with WT BY4741 cells and generated several new grx5Δ strains by tetrad dissection. The newly derived grx5Δ strains were viable; however, they grew noticeably slower than the WT in fermentation medium (Fig. 1D). In agreement with a previous study (16Rodríguez-Manzaneque M.T. Ros J. Cabiscol E. Sorribas A. Herrero E. Grx5 glutaredoxin plays a central role in protection against protein oxidative damage in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19 (10.1128/MCB.19.12.8180 10567543): 8180-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), grx5Δ strains were deficient in respiration (supplemental Fig. 1A). Genetic tests and analysis of mitochondrial DNA showed grx5Δ cells to be ρ0 (supplemental Fig. 1, B–D), explaining their respiration deficiency. Testing the new grx5Δ strains confirmed their high sensitivity to oxidants. For example, grx5Δ cells were unable to grow in medium supplemented with 50 μm menadione, a dose that caused only a transient growth delay in the WT (Fig. 1D). Consistent with the screen data (Fig. 1C), Northern hybridization with the probe y540 showed severe 25S rRNA degradation in grx5Δ cells after treatment with either 0.25 mm H2O2 or 50 μm menadione (supplemental Fig. 2A). The ES7-cleaved fragment was detectable in grx5Δ cells after treatment with as little as 10 μm menadione, whereas 25S rRNA integrity in WT cells was unaffected by this dose (Fig. 1E). To better define the kinetics of the oxidant-induced 25S rRNA decay, we next analyzed rRNA at different time points after addition of 50 μm menadione to the culture medium (Fig. 2A). In grx5Δ cells, the ES7-cleaved fragment was apparent after a 1-min treatment and further increased in intensity over time, paralleled by decay of the full-length 25S rRNA (Fig. 2). By comparison, menadione treatment in WT cells led to a slower onset of rRNA degradation and affected only a small fraction of ribosomes (Fig. 2). This indicated that cleavage of the ES7 region of 25S rRNA occurs virtually instantaneously upon oxidant exposure of grx5Δ cells, arguing against lengthy mechanisms such as autophagic delivery of ribosomes to the vacuole (17Huang H. Kawamata T. Horie T. Tsugawa H. Nakayama Y. Ohsumi Y. Fukusaki E. Bulk RNA degradation by nitrogen starvation-induced autophagy in yeast.EMBO J. 2015; 34 (10.15252/embj.201489083 25468960): 154-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) or induction of the apoptotic program (14Mroczek S. Kufel J. Apoptotic signals induce specific degradation of ribosomal RNA in yeast.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36 (10.1093/nar/gkm1100 18385160): 2874-2888Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Northern hybridizations with probes for other RNA types revealed increased degradation of 5S rRNA, 5.8S rRNA, and tRNAs after treatment of grx5Δ cells with menadione or H2O2 (supplemental Fig. 2, C–F). However, large rRNAs (18S and 25S) were by far the most severely affected RNA species (supplemental Fig. 2, A and B), with only ∼2% of intact 25S rRNA remaining after 2-h treatment with 50 μm menadione (supplemental Fig. 2A). Hybridizations with additional 25S rRNA probes verified extensive degradation of the entire rRNA molecule in oxidant-treated grx5Δ cells (supplemental Fig. 3). Collectively, these data show that Grx5 plays a crucial role in maintaining ribosome integrity during oxidative stress. Lack of Grx5 greatly intensifies the effects of oxidants on ribosomes. This not only increases the number of ES7-cleaved ribosomes, but can also lead to runaway ribosome degradation after treatment with low oxidant levels that are survivable in Grx5-expressing cells. Grx5 belongs to the glutaredoxin family of enzymes, also known as GSH-dependent oxidoreductases, many of which help to maintain the redox state of proteins during oxidative stress (18Fernandes A.P. Holmgren A. Glutaredoxins: glutathione-dependent redox enzymes with functions far beyond a simple thioredoxin backup system.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2004; 6 (10.1089/152308604771978354 14713336): 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Because some glutaredoxins can also function as ROS scavengers (19Chen X. Lv Q. Hong Y. Chen X. Cheng B. Wu T. IL-1β maintains the redox balance by regulating glutaredoxin 1 expression during oral carcinogenesis.J. Oral Pathol. Med. 2017; 46 (10.1111/jop.12502 27658048): 332-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 20Laporte D. Olate E. Salinas P. Salazar M. Jordana X. Holuigue L. Glutaredoxin GRXS13 plays a key role in protection against photooxidative stress in Arabidopsis.J. Exp. Bot. 2012; 63 (10.1093/jxb/err301 21963612): 503-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), we first sought to determine how lack of Grx5 affected the cellular ROS load. We estimated H2O2 levels in grx5Δ cells by using for comparison a ctt1Δ strain deficient for catalase, a key H2O2-inactivating enzyme. Amplex Red assays performed after treatment with 50 μm menadione or 0.25 mm H2O2 indeed revealed elevated H2O2 levels in grx5Δ cells as well as in the control ctt1Δ strain (Fig. 3A). However, the observed increases in H2O2 did not correlate well with the extent of rRNA degradation (Fig. 3B). For instance, grx5Δ cells exhibited more rRNA degradation after treatment with 25 μm menadione than the WT and ctt1Δ cells after 50 μm treatment (Fig. 3B) despite the lack of a comparable H2O2 increase (Fig. 3A). To assess the levels of the O2̇̄ radical in oxidant-treated grx5Δ cells, we used the superoxide-specific probe dihydroethidium (DHE) (21Dikalov S.I. Harrison D.G. Methods for detection of mitochondrial and cellular reactive oxygen species.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2014; 20 (10.1089/ars.2012.4886 22978713): 372-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Oxidized DHE was analyzed by a flow cytometry assay, which revealed moderately increased superoxide levels in grx5Δ cells compared with the WT cells (Fig. 3C). However, the O2̇̄ levels detected in grx5Δ cells were less pronounced than in the control sod2Δ strain lacking superoxide dismutase (Fig. 3C). Importantly, sod2Δ cells displayed significantly lower rRNA degradation than similarly treated grx5Δ cells (Fig. 3D). Thus, neither hydrogen peroxide nor superoxide radical levels reflect the severity of ribosome degradation during oxidant treatments of grx5Δ cells, suggesting that additional factor(s) may play a role in this process. Previous studies have shown that Grx5 participates in iron–sulfur cluster (ISC) protein biogenesis (22Alves R. Herrero E. Sorribas A.

Iron can both potentiate ROS production and exacerbate ROS-induced toxicity in the cell (28Gomez M. Pérez-Gallardo R.V. Sánchez L.A. Díaz-Pérez A.L. Cortés-Rojo C. Meza Carmen V. Saavedra-Molina A.

We therefore asked whether the disruption of iron homeostasis in grx5Δ cells contributes to the oxidant-induced effects on rRNA. First, we analyzed the iron content of the grx5Δ cells and confirmed that it was significantly increased compared with the WT (Fig. 4A), in agreement with the results of a previous study (25Rodríguez-Manzaneque M.T. Tamarit J. Bellí G. Ros J. Herrero E. Grx5 is a mitochondrial glutaredoxin required for the activity of iron/sulfur enzymes.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13 (10.1091/mbc.01-10-0517 11950925): 1109-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). We also found that treatment of grx5Δ cells with the membrane permeable Fe2+ chelator 1,2-phenanthroline (PHL) (30Lee T.S. Kolthoff I.M. Leussing D.L. Reaction of ferrous and ferric ions with 1,10-phenanthroline; kinetics of formation and dissociation of ferrous phenanthroline.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1948; 70 (10.1021/ja01191a015 18102899): 3596-3600Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) lowers the extent of the iron excess caused by Grx5 deficiency (Fig. 4A). We then assayed the viability of the WT and grx5Δ cells after short treatment (30 and 60 min) with 50 μm menadione in the presence or absence of PHL. This dose of menadione did not reduce survival in WT cells (Fig. 4B, left) but severely affected the viability of grx5Δ cells (Fig. 4B, right), consistent with the reported hypersensitivity of Grx5-deficient cells to oxidants (Fig. 1D and Ref. 16Rodríguez-Manzaneque M.T. Ros J. Cabiscol E. Sorribas A. Herrero E. Grx5 glutaredoxin plays a central role in protection against protein oxidative damage in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19 (10.1128/MCB.19.12.8180 10567543): 8180-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the addition of PHL prior to menadione treatment alleviated the oxidant-induced loss of viability in grx5Δ cells (Fig. 4B, right). Analysis of RNA extracted from these cells showed protection of 25S rRNA from menadione-induced degradation by PHL (Fig. 4C and supplemental 5A). Similar protective effects of PHL were observed with H2O2 treatments (supplemental Fig. 5). To address the contribution of iron through an independent approach, we used overexpression of the human ferritin MtF1 to decrease the labile intracellular iron pool in grx5Δ cells. Human ferritins maintain proper iron homeostasis by sequestering excess iron in intracellular complexes (31Cazzola M. Invernizzi R. Bergamaschi G. Levi S. Corsi B. Travaglino E. Rolandi V. Biasiotto G. Drysdale J. Arosio P. Mitochondrial ferritin expression in erythroid cells from patients with sideroblastic anemia.Blood. 2003; 101 (10.1182/blood-2002-07-2006 12406866): 1996-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Expression of the human mitochondrial ferritin MtF1 has been shown previously to effectively reduce free iron concentration in yeast cells (32Campanella A. Isaya G. O'Neill H.A. Santambrogio P. Cozzi A. Arosio P. Levi S. The expression of human mitochondrial ferritin rescues respiratory function in frataxin-deficient yeast.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13 (10.1093/hmg/ddh232 15282205): 2279-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Consistent with the results obtained via chemical chelation of iron, grx5Δ cells harboring the MtF1 expression construct displayed reduced degradation of 25S rRNA after oxidant treatment compared with cells transformed with an empty vector plasmid (Fig. 4D). Based on these data, we conclude that the extent of oxidant-induced rRNA cleavages depends on intracellular iron levels. A defect in iron homeostasis, which leads to accumulation of excessive iron in cells deficient for Grx5 function, may thus explain why severe RNA damage is observed in grx5Δ cells but not in strains defective for various ROS-scavenging enzymes (Fig. 1C). The above results indicate that the severe degradation of ribosomes in grx5Δ cells results from the combination of two factors: oxidants and high intracellular iron. Transition metal ions, including iron, can enhance ROS-induced damage in biomolecules, at least in part, through the generation of the highly reactive ·OH radicals in a Fenton reaction: Fe2++H2O2→Fe3++·OH+OH− This led us consider the possibility that the rRNA cleavages might be a result of chemical rather than enzymatic hydrolysis. These cleavages might be directed by redox-reactive iron bound at specific ribosomal sites; for example, through interactions with rRNA or ribosomal proteins in the proximity of the RNA backbone. Previous studies have shown that binding of redox-active metals to remove DNA and RNA molecules can give rise to oxidizing species that are not freely diffusible, thereby producing site-specific cleavages (33Berens C. Streicher B. Schroeder R. Hillen W. Visualizing metal-ion-binding sites in group I introns by iron(II)-mediated Fenton reactions.Chem.

Examination of the ES7 region in yeast 25S rRNA, where the major iron-dependent cleavage takes place, revealed three Mg2+ ions located 6–8 Å away from the ES7 cleavage site (Fig. 5A), providing potential sites for exchange with Fe2+ ions. To test the hypothesis that the site-specific rRNA cleavages in vivo may be driven by redox-active iron bound to ribosomes, we sought to reconstitute the cleavage process in vitro. We devised reaction conditions based on earlier studies showing that ascorbic acid can induce localized redox reactions at the sites of metal binding (38Morgan A.R. Cone R.L. Elgert T.M.

https://openalex.org/W2884499015,"Monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) is a mitochondrial flavoenzyme implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and inflammation and also in many neurological disorders. MAO-A also has been reported as a potential therapeutic target in prostate cancer. However, the regulatory mechanisms controlling cytokine-induced MAO-A expression in immune or cancer cells remain to be identified. Here, we show that MAO-A expression is co-induced with 15-lipoxygenase (15-LO) in interleukin 13 (IL-13)-activated primary human monocytes and A549 non-small cell lung carcinoma cells. We present evidence that MAO-A gene expression and activity are regulated by signal transducer and activator of transcription 1, 3, and 6 (STAT1, STAT3, and STAT6), early growth response 1 (EGR1), and cAMP-responsive element–binding protein (CREB), the same transcription factors that control IL-13–dependent 15-LO expression. We further established that in both primary monocytes and in A549 cells, IL-13–stimulated MAO-A expression, activity, and function are directly governed by 15-LO. In contrast, IL-13–driven expression and activity of MAO-A was 15-LO–independent in U937 promonocytic cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the 15-LO–dependent transcriptional regulation of MAO-A in response to IL-13 stimulation in monocytes and in A549 cells is mediated by peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and that signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) plays a crucial role in facilitating the transcriptional activity of PPARγ. We further report that the IL-13–STAT6–15-LO–PPARγ axis is critical for MAO-A expression, activity, and function, including migration and reactive oxygen species generation. Altogether, these results have major implications for the resolution of inflammation and indicate that MAO-A may promote metastatic potential in lung cancer cells.

https://openalex.org/W2884858279,"The commercial yield of cucurbit crops infected with Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) severely decreases. Chemical treatments against CMV are not effective; therefore, genetic resistance is considered the primary line of defense. Here, we studied resistance to CMV in cucumber inbred line ‘02245’ using a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population generated from a cross between ‘65G’ and ‘02245’ as susceptible and resistant parents, respectively. Genetic analysis revealed that CMV resistance in cucumber is quantitatively inherited. Analysis of the RIL population revealed that a quantitative trait locus (QTL) was found on chromosome 6; named cmv6.1, this QTL was delimited by SSR9-56 and SSR11-177 and explained 31.7% of the phenotypic variation in 2016 and 28.2% in 2017. The marker SSR11-1, which is close to the locus, was tested on 78 different cucumber accessions and found to have an accuracy of 94% in resistant and moderately resistant lines but only 67% in susceptible lines. The mapped QTL was delimited within a region of 1,624.0 kb, and nine genes related to disease resistance were identified. Cloning and alignment of the genomic sequences of these nine genes between ‘65G’ and ‘02245’ revealed that Csa6M133680 had four single-base substitutions within the coding sequences (CDSs) and two single-base substitutions in its 3’-untranslated region, and the other eight genes showed 100% nucleotide sequence identity in their exons. Expression pattern analyses of Csa6M133680 in ‘65G’ and ‘02245’ revealed that the expression levels of Csa6M133680 significantly differed between ‘65G’ and ‘02245’ at 80 h after inoculation with CMV and that the expression in ‘02245’ was 4.4 times greater than that in ‘65G’. The above results provide insights into the fine mapping and marker-assisted selection in cucumber breeding for CMV resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2883985883,"Alpha-synuclein can form beta-sheet filaments, the accumulation of which plays a key role in the development of Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy. It has previously been shown that alpha-synuclein is a substrate for the HECT domain-containing ubiquitin ligase Nedd4, and is subject to ubiquitin-mediated endosomal degradation. We show here that alpha-synuclein filaments are much better substrates for ubiquitination in vitro than monomeric alpha-synuclein, and that this increased susceptibility cannot be mimicked by the mere clustering of monomers. Recognition by Nedd4 family enzymes is not through the conventional binding of PPxY-containing sequences to WW domains of the ligase, but it also involves C2 and HECT domains. The disease-causing alpha-synuclein mutant A53T is a much less efficient substrate for Nedd4 ligases than the wild-type protein. We suggest that preferential recognition, ubiquitination and degradation of beta-sheet-containing filaments may help to limit toxicity, and that A53T alpha-synuclein may be more toxic, at least in part because it avoids this fate."

Here, we used environmental monitoring data and muscle samples collected from Asian black bear (Ursus thibetanus) and wild boar (Sus scrofa) from May 2011 to March 2016 to examine seasonal variation in radiocesium (137Cs) concentrations in muscle tissues (hereafter, muscle 137Cs) of these important game species in Fukushima Prefecture. We measured muscle 137Cs of bears and wild boars killed by hunters or in animal control culls. First, using a linear mixed model (LMM), we tested for a positive relationship between muscle 137Cs and 137Cs in the soil at the site of capture (hereafter, soil 137Cs) estimated from a soil 137Cs deposition map produced by the Japan Atomic Energy Agency. In the LMM, muscle 137Cs was positively related to estimated soil 137Cs, which corroborates the results of previous studies. The LMM regression coefficients differed between the two species, with wild boar muscle 137Cs being higher than that of bears sampled at the same locations. We then employed a generalized additive mixed model (GAMM) to estimate seasonal variation in the muscle 137Cs of the target species. GAMM showed that muscle 137Cs varied seasonally and that this seasonal variation also differed between the two species. In bears, muscle 137Cs decreased from spring to early autumn, before increasing in winter. Wild boar muscle 137Cs remained low during spring and summer and was high during autumn and early spring. These patterns are likely influenced by differences in diet, habitat use, and physiology between these two species."

We aim to examine and compare the effects of relaxed natural selection on male and female obesity prevalence.Data for 191 countries of the world were captured for this ecological study. Curvilinear regressions, bivariate and partial correlations, linear mixed models and multivariate linear regression analyses were used to examine the relationship between Ibs and sex-specific obesity prevalence. Per capita GDP, urbanization and caloric intake were controlled for as the confounding factors. Fisher r-to-z transformation, R2 increment in multivariate regression and F-test were used to compare the correlations.Curvilinear regressions, bivariate and partial correlations (controlled for GDP, urbanization and calories) revealed that Ibs was significantly correlated to obesity prevalence of both sexes, but significantly stronger to male than to female obesity prevalence. Curvilinear regression models also showed strong correlations. Mixed linear models, with effects of GDP, urbanisation and caloric intake controlled for, showed that male and female average obesity prevalence rates were significantly higher in countries with greater Ibs value than their equivalents in countries with lower Ibs. Between higher and lower Ibs countries, the gap of male obesity prevalence is 60% greater than the gap of female obesity prevalence. Stepwise multiple regression identified that Ibs was a significant predictor of obesity prevalence of both sexes. Multivariate regression showed that, adding Ibs as an obesity predictor, R2 increment in male model was significantly greater than in female model.Relaxed natural selection may drive males and females to accumulate metabolic faulty genes equally. Probably due to greater environmental, personal intervention in regulating female body mass, relaxed natural selection shows less contributing effects to female obesity prevalence than to male obesity prevalence. Gene therapy to prevent obesity may need to be also taken into account."
https://openalex.org/W2883214122,"CRM197, which retains the same inflammatory and immune-stimulant properties as diphtheria toxin but with reduced toxicity, has been used as a safe carrier in conjugated vaccines. Expression of recombinant CRM197 in E. coli is limited due to formation of inclusion bodies. Soluble expression attempts in Bacillus subtilis, P. fluorescens, Pichia pastoris, and E. coli were partially unsuccessful or did not generate yields sufficient for industrial scale production. Multiple approaches have been attempted to produce CRM197 in E. coli, which has attractive features such as high yield, simplicity, fast growth, etc., including expression of oxidative host, concurrent expression of chaperones, or periplasmic export. Recently, alternative methods for recovery of insoluble proteins expressed in E. coli were reported. Compared to traditional denaturation/refolding, these methods used the non-denaturing solubilization agent, N-lauroylsarkosine to obtain higher recovery yields of native proteins. Based on this work, here, we focused on solubilization of CRM197 from E. coli inclusion bodies. First, CRM197 was expressed as inclusion bodies by high-level expression of recombinant CRM197 in E. coli (126.8 mg/g dcw). Then bioactive CRM197 was isolated from these inclusion bodies with high yield (108.1 mg/g dcw) through solubilization with N-lauroylsarkosine including Triton X-100 and CHAPS, and purified by Ni-affinity chromatography and size-exclusion chromatography. In this study, we present a cost-effective alternative for the production of bioactive CRM197 and compare our recovery yield with yields in other production processes."

However, other species with morphological characteristics similar to those of the actual components are being used to replace or adulterate PR, causing issues with quality control and product safety. The morphological similarity of PR and its substitutes makes classic morphological identification challenging. To address this issue, DNA barcoding-based identification using ITS2 and psbA-trnH sequences was applied in this study to evaluate the efficiency and accuracy of this approach in identifying PR samples collected from 39 different regions in China. The identification of PR by this method was confirmed by other methods (phylogeny-based and character-based methods), and all the samples were clearly and accurately distinguished. This study highlights the efficient and accurate nature of DNA barcoding in PR identification. Applying this technique will provide a means to differentiate PR from other altered formulations, thus improving product quality and safety for consumers of PR and its products."
https://openalex.org/W2884742412,"Measures (e.g. δ15N, δ13C, %C, %N and C:N) derived from animal tissues are commonly used to estimate diets and trophic interactions. Since tissue samples are often exposed to air or kept chilled in ice over a short-term during sample preparation, they may degrade. Herein, we hypothesize that tissue decomposition will cause changes in these measures. In this study, we kept marine fish, crustacean and mollusc tissues in air or ice over 120 h (5 days). We found that tissue decomposition in air enriched δ15N (range 0.6‰ to 1.3‰) and δ13C (0.2‰ to 0.4‰), decreased %N (0.47 to 3.43 percentage points from staring values of ~13%) and %C (4.53 to 8.29 percentage points from starting values of ~43%), and subsequently increased C:N ratio (0.14 to 0.75). In air, while such changes to δ13C were relatively minor and therefore likely tolerable, changes in δ15N, %N, %C and C:N ratio should be interpreted with caution. Ice effectively reduced the extent to which decomposition enriched δ15N (≤ 0.4‰) and δ13C (≤ 0.2‰), and eliminated decomposition in C:N ratio, %N and %C. In our second experiment, for fish tissues in either air or ice over 120 h, we observed no effects of decomposition on relationships between lipid content, C:N ratio, and Δδ13C (change in δ13C after lipid removal), which are employed to correct δ13C for samples containing lipid. We also confirmed that lipid in tissues caused large errors when estimating δ13C (mean ± standard error = -1.8‰ ± 0.1‰, range -0.6‰ to -3.8‰), and showed both lipid extraction and mathematical correction performed equally well to correct for lipids when estimating δ13C. We, therefore, recommend that specimens of marine animals should be kept in ice during sample preparation for a short-term, as it is an effective means for minimizing changes of the stable isotope measures in their tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2884692180,"Background Non-communicable diseases (NCDs, e.g. cardiovascular disease) are responsible for high rates of morbidity and the majority of premature deaths worldwide. It is necessary to develop preventative interventions that can reduce the associated risk factors of NCDs. Researchers have found that the biomarker adrenomedullin (ADM) becomes elevated years before the onset of NCDs and might play an important role in their development. ADM has also been linked to psychological problems such as stress, anxiety, and depression, which are known risk factors of NCDs. In this randomized controlled trial, we examined whether participating in a five-week yoga intervention reduces ADM and increases psychological health in middle-aged adults who self-report as moderately to highly stressed, but who otherwise exhibit no physical complaints. Methods One hundred and five adults (78% women; mean age = 53.5, SD = 6.7) were randomly assigned to (1) a five-week Yin yoga intervention, (2) a five-week intervention combining Yin yoga with psychoeducation and mindfulness practice (called the YOMI program), or (3) a control group who did not practice yoga or mindfulness for five weeks. Results Compared to the control group, we observed significantly greater pre-post reductions in plasma ADM levels (p < .001), anxiety (p ≤ .002), and sleep problems (p ≤ .003) in both intervention groups. Furthermore, the YOMI group exclusively showed significantly greater pre-post reductions in stress (p = .012) and depression (p = .021) compared to the control group. Significant correlations (p < .05) were found between pre-post reductions in ADM and anxiety symptoms (p = .02) and depression (p = .04) in the entire sample. Conclusion The five-week Yin yoga-based interventions appeared to reduce both the physiological and psychological risk factors known to be associated with NCDs. The study suggests that incorporating Yin yoga could be an easy and low-cost method of limiting the negative health effects associated with high stress.

A survey was carried out on wild grapevines in Tuscany (Italy), where isolates of the Grapevine rupestris stem pitting virus (GRSPaV), Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 1 and 3 (GLRaV-1 and GLRaV-3) and Grapevine virus A (GVA) were detected. The complete coat protein (CP) region of these isolates was sequenced to investigate the relationship of the viral variants from Tuscan wild grapevines with isolates from different geographical origins. According to the phylogenetic analyses, GLRaV-1 and GLRaV-3 isolates from Tuscan wild grapevines clustered with isolates from cultivated grapevines with nucleotide sequence identities ranging from 66% to 87% and from 72.5% to 99% respectively, without any correlation between the distribution and geographical origin. Conversely, GRSPaV and GVA isolates clustered together with other Italian isolates from V. vinifera with nucleotide sequence identities ranging from 71.14% to 96.12% and from 73.5% to 92%, respectively. Our analysis of the whole amino acid sequences revealed a high conservation level for the studied proteins explained by a selective pressure on this genomic region, probably due to functional constraints imposed on CP, such as specific interactions with cellular receptors in the insect vectors necessary for successful transmission. In addition, analyses of genetic recombination suggest no significant point mutations that might play a significant role in genetic diversification. The dN/dS ratio also estimated a low number of non-silent mutations, highlighting the purifying selective pressure. The widespread distribution of the Rugose wood complex (GRSPaV and GVA associated disease) in comparison with the Grapevine Leafroll associated viruses (GLRaV-1 and -3) could explain the major geographical correlation found for the viral variants detected in Tuscany."

Phylogenetic analysis of partial RdRp and VP1 gene regions identified 10 genotypes of the GII genogroup and 3 genotypes of the GI genogroup. The predominant genotype was GII.P17-GII.17 (42.86%, 33/77), followed by GII.Pe-GII.4_Sydney 2012 (24.68%, 19/77) and GII.P16-GII.2 (12.96%, 10/77). However, the prevailing genotype in the Zhoushan Islands has shifted on three separate occasions. The GII.Pe-GII.4_Sydney_2012 strain was dominant in 2013–2014, the GII.P17-17 strain was dominant in 2015–2016, and the GII.P16-GII.2 strain was dominant in 2017. Divergence analysis showed that the re-emerging GII.P16-GII.2 strains clustered with the Japanese 2010–2012 GII.P16-GII.2 strains, and the time of the most recent common ancestor was estimated to have occurred in 2012 to 2013. The evolutionary rates of the RdRp gene region of the GII.P16 genotype and the VP1 gene region of the GII.2 genotype were 2.64 × 10−3 (95% HPD interval, 2.17–3.08 × 10−3) and 3.36 × 10−3 (95% HPD interval, 2.66–4.04 × 10−3) substitutions/site/year, respectively. The migration pattern of the HuNoV GII.2 genotype in China demonstrated that the re-emerging GII.P16-GII.2 strains were first introduced into Hong Kong from Japan, and then spread from Hong Kong to other coastal areas. Our results also showed that the GII.P16-GII.2 strains in the Zhoushan Islands were likely introduced from Jiangsu Province, China, in 2016."

https://openalex.org/W2883032838,"Cyclooxygenases (COXs)/prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) signaling pathways are known to modulate a variety of homeostatic processes and are involved in various pathophysiological conditions. COXs/PGE2 signaling pathways have also been demonstrated to have proviral or antiviral effects, which appeared different even in the same virus family. A porcine sapovirus Cowden strain, a member of genus Sapovirus within the Caliciviridae family, induces strong COX-2/PGE2 but transient COX-1/PGE2 signaling to enhance virus replication. However, whether infections of other viruses in the different genera activate COXs/PGE2 signaling, and thus affect the replication of viruses, remains unknown. In the present study, infections of cells with the feline calicivirus (FCV) F9 strain in the genus Vesivirus and murine norovirus (MNV) CW-1 strain in the genus Norovirus only activated the COX-2/PGE2 signaling in a time-dependent manner. Treatment with pharmacological inhibitors or transfection of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against COX-2 enzyme significantly reduced the production of PGE2 as well as FCV and MNV replications. The inhibitory effects of these pharmacological inhibitors against COX-2 enzyme on the replication of both viruses were restored by the addition of PGE2. Silencing of COX-1 via siRNAs and inhibition of COX-1 via an inhibitor also decrease the production of PGE2 and replication of both viruses, which can be attributed to the inhibition COX-1/PGE2 signaling pathway. These data indicate that the COX-2/PGE2 signaling pathway has proviral effects for the replication of FCV and MNV, and pharmacological inhibitors against these enzymes serve as potential therapeutic candidates for treating FCV and MNV infections."
https://openalex.org/W2883001335,"Cholesteatoma is an epidermal cyst with still unknown pathomechanism. The aim of the current study was to investigate molecular differences in the background of the hyperproliferative property and aggressive behavior typical of the cholesteatoma epithelium. The expression of three cytokeratin genes (KRT1, KRT10 and KRT19), the matrix metalloproteinase 9 gene (MMP9) and the tumor suppressor TP53 gene was measured by qRT-PCR in surgical samples of pediatric and adult cholesteatoma cases and their expression level was compared to that of normal skin samples from the retroauricular region of control individuals. Cholesteatoma samples were stratified according to the age of onset and recurrence for more detailed analysis. Our results showed identical expression pattern for KRT1 and KRT10, their expression was higher in pediatric cases than in adults, especially in pediatric recurrent samples. The expression level of KRT19 was inversely proportional to that of KRT1/KRT10, it was lower in the more invasive recurrent cases both in our pediatric and adult groups. As it was expected from the bone destructive behavior of cholesteatoma, a significantly elevated expression of MMP9 was measured in cholesteatoma samples, the highest level was found in adult recurrent cases. Low expression levels characterize the TP53 gene without significant differences in our samples. These findings demonstrate that cytokeratin expression distinguishes between pediatric/adult, nonrecurrent/recurrent cases, suggesting that distinct differentiation state and cell division potential characterize these cholesteatoma cases. KRT19 with a tumor suppressor potential might restrict the recurrence of cholesteatoma. The differences observed in gene expression profiles between cholesteatoma and control samples support the notion that cholesteatoma is a cystic lesion with tumor-like behavior because it is characterized by invasive, destructive growth and high tendency for recurrence."
https://openalex.org/W2883197407,"In a surgical operation requiring endoscopy, it is essential to obtain a clear endoscopic view. However, it is often disturbed by the contamination on the lens during the surgery. No device can clean the lens surface simply and completely. Many surgeons are hampered by the impaired view and the distraction by the repeated cleaning of the lens. Therefore, we developed a novel endoscope cleaning device to address this problem. The device was made of 3D-printed rubber-like plastic. It contains a syringe filled with saline and an aspiration system. It would be used intraoperatively to wash the lens surface in a few seconds with rapid flow of water and air. The cleaning ability of the device was evaluated using mayonnaise with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as a model contaminant. The gauze-wiping maneuver was selected as control. After each maneuver, the clarity of the endoscopic view was evaluated, and residual contaminants were assessed quantitatively with ATP assay. The cleaning device obtained a crisp and clear view and eliminated the contaminant on the lens every time after a single cleaning maneuver. The gauze-wiping maneuver required for the lens to be wiped at least three times to obtain a clear view, and even then, some contaminants remained. Repeated contamination and cleaning using gauze led to accumulation of contaminants on the lens, which resulted in difficulty in cleaning the lens as the operation proceeded. The cleaning device did not show such accumulation. Our novel cleaning device with air and water flow has been shown to wash out the lens contaminants completely and immediately in a simple manner. It is expected to improve the safety and cost-effectiveness of endoscopic surgery."

However, some psychiatric adverse events (PAEs) have been reported, resulting in drug withdrawal. The pathophysiology of LEV-induced PAE has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we investigated the relationship between PAEs and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes. Eleven epilepsy patients, who developed PAEs after the administration of LEV and spontaneously improved after drug withdrawal, were enrolled retrospectively. Genomic DNA from the peripheral blood was extracted, and four-digit allele genotyping of HLA genes was performed. The genotype frequencies of HLA genes were compared to those of 80 patients in which LEV was well tolerated, as well as to 485 individuals from the general Korean population. The frequency of the HLA-A*1101 allele was significantly higher in the LEV-induced PAEs group compared to both the LEV-tolerant group (p = 0.021, OR 4.80, 95% CI 1.30–17.74) and the general Korean population (p = 0.015, OR 4.62, 95% CI 1.38–15.45). This study is the first attempt at investigating the relationship between the HLA system and LEV-induced PAE.

https://openalex.org/W2884887967,"It is still unclear under which conditions temporary combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) results in a prolonged remission after interruption. Clinical trials have contradicting reposts about the effect of cART during primary HIV infection on the disease progression. Here we propose that the apparent contradiction is due the presence of a window of opportunity for cART treatment observed in the in silico studies. We study non-linear correlations in the HIV dynamics over time using information theory. This approach requires a large dataset of CD4+ T lymphocytes and viral load concentrations over time. Since it is unfeasible to collect the required amount of data in clinical trials we use C-ImmSim, a clinically validated in silico model of the HIV infection, to simulate the HIV infection and temporary cART in 500 virtual patients for a period of 6 years post infection in time steps of 8 hours. We validate the results of our model with two published clinical trials of temporary cART in acute infection and analyse the impact of cART on the immune response. Our quantitative analysis predicts a “window of opportunity” of about ten months after the acute phase during which a temporary cART has significantly longer-lasting beneficial effects on the immune system as compared to treatment during the chronic phase. This window may help to explain the controversial outcomes of clinical trials that differ by the starting time and duration of the short-term course cART and provides a critical insight to develop appropriate protocols for future clinical trials."

We sought to determine the relationship of AMD to the progression of coronary artery calcium (CAC) using data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). Methods Our cohort consisted of 5803 adults aged 45 to 84 years free of known cardiovascular disease (CVD). Retinal photographs were taken during visit 2 (Aug 2002-Jan 2004). CAC was measured with computed tomography at visit 1 (July 2000-Aug 2002) and visit 5 (April 2010-Dec 2011) and changes between visits were determined. Results Participants were categorized as with (n = 244) and without AMD (n = 5559) at visit 2. At visit 5, 92 participants with and 2684 without AMD had CAC scores. Among those with detectable CAC at baseline (>0 at visit 1), CAC progression was greater in persons with compared to those without AMD after multivariable adjustment (530 ± 537 vs. 339 ± 426 Agatston units, P<0.01). Conclusions The presence of AMD in a diverse population without known clinical CVD independently predicted higher 10-year CAC progression in participants with baseline CAC >0.

The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has been the most widely used genetic marker for studying American mixed populations, although nuclear markers, such as microsatellite loci (STRs) commonly used in forensic science, showed to be genetically and geographically structured. In this work, we analyzed DNA from buccal swab samples of 296 individuals across Peru: 156 Native Amazons (Ashaninka, Cashibo and Shipibo from Ucayali, Huambiza from Loreto and Moche from Lambayeque) and 140 urban Peruvians from Lima and other 33 urban areas. The aim was to evaluate, through STRs and mtDNA variability, recent migrations in urban Peruvian populations and to gain more information about their continental ancestry. STR data highlighted that most individuals (67%) of the urban Peruvian sample have a strong similarity to the Amazon Native population, whereas 22% have similarity to African populations and only ~1% to European populations. Also the maternally-transmitted mtDNA confirmed the strong Native contribution (~90% of Native American haplogroups) and the lower frequencies of African (~6%) and European (~3%) haplogroups. This study provides a detailed description of the urban Peruvian genetic structure and proposes forensic STRs as a useful tool for studying recent migrations, especially when coupled with mtDNA."
https://openalex.org/W2884533160,"In a variety of species, reduced food intake, and in particular protein or amino acid (AA) restriction, extends lifespan and healthspan. However, the underlying epigenetic and/or transcriptional mechanisms are largely unknown, and dissection of specific pathways in cultured cells may contribute to filling this gap. We have previously shown that, in mammalian cells, deprivation of essential AAs (methionine/cysteine or tyrosine) leads to the transcriptional reactivation of integrated silenced transgenes, including plasmid and retroviral vectors and latent HIV-1 provirus, by a process involving epigenetic chromatic remodeling and histone acetylation. Here we show that the deprivation of methionine/cysteine also leads to the transcriptional upregulation of endogenous retroviruses, suggesting that essential AA starvation affects the expression not only of exogenous non-native DNA sequences, but also of endogenous anciently-integrated and silenced parasitic elements of the genome. Moreover, we show that the transgene reactivation response is highly conserved in different mammalian cell types, and it is reproducible with deprivation of most essential AAs. The General Control Non-derepressible 2 (GCN2) kinase and the downstream integrated stress response represent the best candidates mediating this process; however, by pharmacological approaches, RNA interference and genomic editing, we demonstrate that they are not implicated. Instead, the response requires MEK/ERK and/or JNK activity and is reproduced by ribosomal inhibitors, suggesting that it is triggered by a novel nutrient-sensing and signaling pathway, initiated by translational block at the ribosome, and independent of mTOR and GCN2. Overall, these findings point to a general transcriptional response to essential AA deprivation, which affects the expression of non-native genomic sequences, with relevant implications for the epigenetic/transcriptional effects of AA restriction in health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2883183256,"Platelet-derived growth factor CC (PDGF-CC) is important during foetal development but also in pathogenesis of neurologic diseases, cancer and fibrosis. We have previously demonstrated that blocking the PDGF-CC/PDGF receptor alpha (PDGFRα) axis resulted in reduction of stroke volume and cerebrovascular permeability after experimentally induced stroke. Recently, we could translate these findings into the clinic showing that imatinib, a small tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting PDGF receptors, can significantly improve neurological outcome after ischemic stroke in human. Herein we report preclinical toxicological analyses of our newly generated monoclonal anti-human PDGF-CC antibody 6B3 (mAb 6B3) in PDGF-CC humanized mice. Beside histological organ assessment, we also analysed serum, urine, haematological parameters and the general health status of the treated mice. We could not find any indications that mAb 6B3 is toxic or has other significant side effects neither in short, nor in long treatment regimens. Our results indicate that mAb 6B3 can be further developed for clinical use. This opens up the possibility to assess the therapeutic potential of blocking PDGF-CC in diverse pathological conditions such as neurologic diseases, cancer and fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2883797629,"This qualitative study aimed to explore the misconceptions, knowledge gaps and constructs of leptospirosis among 72 respondents from rural and urban districts in two states of Malaysia. We conducted focus group discussions and data were examined using thematic analyses. The layman term of ‘rat urine disease’ contributed the most to the misconceptions regarding leptospirosis. There were gaps in the knowledge among urban and rural respondents in the two states, with the majority of subjects demonstrating a poor understanding of the disease. Construction of knowledge about leptospirosis relied mostly on the information provided by mass and social media; reading materials; word-of-mouth publicity; observations; experiences; and knowledge sharing among families, friends, and communities. The study findings may provide the foundation for the development of educational materials that may reduce the gaps in knowledge, and thereby improve health literacy and enhance preventive health behaviours for avoiding leptospirosis."
https://openalex.org/W2884400324,"The aim of this study was to develop a questionnaire to conveniently assess the diurnal preferences of physical activity (PA) in Japanese university students. A total of 219 subjects completed our novel Morningness-eveningness Exercise Preference Questionnaire (MEEPQ). The MEEPQ consisted of 30 items (15 items for the morning and the same 15 items for the evening) rated on a 5-point Likert scale concerning their preference for participating in PA in the morning and evening. The morning score (MS) and evening score (ES) were determined by summing each of the respective 15 items. The internal consistency and construct validity were assessed, and a factor analysis was conducted. To examine the external validity of the MEEPQ, participants wore an accelerometer for seven consecutive days to measure their PA levels objectively. Finally, the test-retest reliability was evaluated at a one-month interval. The MEEPQ showed excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.896) and construct validity (morning KMO = 0.913, evening KMO = 0.875). A factor analysis showed a three-factor structure involving Physical Wellness (MEEPQ-W), Psychological Well-Being (MEEPQ-P) and Exercise Barrier (MEEPQ-B). The percent of variance was largest for MEEPQ-W in the morning (45.2%) and MEEPQ-P in the evening (40.8%). Test-retest showed that MEEPQ scores had fair repeatability. Significant and positive associations between scores and objectively measured PA levels were found in the MS and 6-9 AM PA and in the ES and 6-9 PM and 9 PM- 0 AM PA (all p<0.05). In summary, the novel MEEPQ showed relatively good agreement and thus can be used for Japanese university student samples. In the MEEPQ, three factors (the physical wellness, psychological well-being and exercise barrier) contributed to a morning or evening PA preference. The summed scores were significantly associated with the objectively measured PA levels in both the morning and evening. Therefore the MEEPQ appears to be a suitable tool for assessing diurnal PA preferences."

https://openalex.org/W2771524477,"Market timing is an investment technique that tries to continuously switch investment into assets forecast to have better returns. What is the likelihood of having a successful market timing strategy? With an emphasis on modeling simplicity, I calculate the feasible set of market timing portfolios using index mutual fund data for perfectly timed (by hindsight) all or nothing quarterly switching between two asset classes, US stocks and bonds over the time period 1993–2017. The historical optimal timing path of switches is shown to be indistinguishable from a random sequence. The key result is that the probability distribution function of market timing returns is asymmetric, that the highest probability outcome for market timing is a below median return. Put another way, simple math says market timing is more likely to lose than to win—even before accounting for costs. The median of the market timing return probability distribution can be directly calculated as a weighted average of the returns of the model assets with the weights given by the fraction of time each asset has a higher return than the other. For the time period of the data the median return was close to, but not identical with, the return of a static 60:40 stock:bond portfolio. These results are illustrated through Monte Carlo sampling of timing paths within the feasible set and by the observed return paths of several market timing mutual funds."
https://openalex.org/W2884587362,"Objectives This nationwide population-based study aimed at evaluating healthcare resource utilization and direct medical costs among rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients receiving biologic therapies in Taiwan. Design and setting A retrospective cohort of 2,425 RA patients who had received first-line tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α antagonist treatment for at least 6 months (the baseline period) between 2007 and 2011 was identified from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. Outcome measures Healthcare resource utilization and direct medical costs of those patients were analyzed and compared 1 year before the index date and during the 1-year follow-up. Results Analytical results demonstrated that 87.7% of RA patients received the same TNF-α antagonist during the 1-year follow-up, 2.4% of the patients switched to another TNF-α antagonist after the baseline period, 7.1% of the study cohort received a second-line biologic agent, while the remaining patients discontinued use of any TNF-α antagonist. Compared to 1 year before the index date, there were significant reductions in emergency room visits and hospitalization days for RA patients treated with the same TNF-α antagonist during the 1-year follow-up. However, there was an increase of outpatient visits among those patients. For those RA patients who switched to another TNF-α antagonist or received a second-line biologic agent, they consumed more healthcare resources. Furthermore, the corresponding medication costs went up markedly during the 1-year follow-up, but nearly all total direct medical costs (biologics excluded) were significantly reduced across the study cohort. Lastly, male patients incurred slightly higher medical costs than their counterparts, albeit in a statistically insignificant fashion. Conclusions This investigation revealed that RA patients treated with biologics utilized fewer emergency room visits and shorter hospitalization days, but incurred higher costs. In summary, this study provides meaningful information on healthcare resource utilization and medical costs of RA patients for healthcare providers and policymakers."
https://openalex.org/W2883276675,"We theoretically investigate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a parallel array of leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons that receives a weak periodic signal and uses spatially nearest neighbor correlated noise. By using linear response theory, we derive the analytic expression of the SNR. The results show that the amplitude of internal noise can be increased up to an optimal value, which corresponds to a maximum SNR. Given the existence of spatially nearest neighbor correlated noise in the neural ensemble, the SNR gain of the collective ensemble response can exceed unity, especially for a negative correlation. This nonlinear collective phenomenon of SNR gain amplification may be related to the array stochastic resonance. In addition, we show that the SNR can be improved by varying the number of neurons, frequency, and amplitude of the weak periodic signal. We expect that this investigation will be useful for both controlling the collective response of neurons and enhancing weak signal transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2883323146,"An important theoretical question in decision making concerns the nature of cue-generation: What mechanism drives the generation of cues used to make inferences? Most models of decision making assume that the properties of cues, often cue validity, initiate a set of dynamic pre-decision processes. In two studies, we test how memory accessibility affects cue use by manipulating both ecological cue validity and cue accessibility in a stock-forecasting task. Cue accessibility was manipulated by the pattern of accurate cue discriminations within experiment blocks of the learning phase of the experiments. Specifically, we manipulated the serial positions in which the cues accurately discriminated while holding overall cue validity constant. At test, participants preferred cues that discriminated early in the learning phase-a kind of primacy effect. The findings suggest that cue use is influenced by memory retrieval mechanisms and that cue use is not solely determined by cue validity. The results have implications for the development of computational models of heuristic decision-making."
