https://openalex.org/W3083424448,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is typically very mild and often asymptomatic in children. A complication is the rare multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19, presenting 4-6 weeks after infection as high fever, organ dysfunction, and strongly elevated markers of inflammation. The pathogenesis is unclear but has overlapping features with Kawasaki disease suggestive of vasculitis and a likely autoimmune etiology. We apply systems-level analyses of blood immune cells, cytokines, and autoantibodies in healthy children, children with Kawasaki disease enrolled prior to COVID-19, children infected with SARS-CoV-2, and children presenting with MIS-C. We find that the inflammatory response in MIS-C differs from the cytokine storm of severe acute COVID-19, shares several features with Kawasaki disease, but also differs from this condition with respect to T cell subsets, interleukin (IL)-17A, and biomarkers associated with arterial damage. Finally, autoantibody profiling suggests multiple autoantibodies that could be involved in the pathogenesis of MIS-C."
https://openalex.org/W3088211674,"'Dysbiosis' of the maternal gut microbiome, in response to challenges such as infection1, altered diet2 and stress3 during pregnancy, has been increasingly associated with abnormalities in brain function and behaviour of the offspring4. However, it is unclear whether the maternal gut microbiome influences neurodevelopment during critical prenatal periods and in the absence of environmental challenges. Here we investigate how depletion and selective reconstitution of the maternal gut microbiome influences fetal neurodevelopment in mice. Embryos from antibiotic-treated and germ-free dams exhibited reduced brain expression of genes related to axonogenesis, deficient thalamocortical axons and impaired outgrowth of thalamic axons in response to cell-extrinsic factors. Gnotobiotic colonization of microbiome-depleted dams with a limited consortium of bacteria prevented abnormalities in fetal brain gene expression and thalamocortical axonogenesis. Metabolomic profiling revealed that the maternal microbiome regulates numerous small molecules in the maternal serum and the brains of fetal offspring. Select microbiota-dependent metabolites promoted axon outgrowth from fetal thalamic explants. Moreover, maternal supplementation with these metabolites abrogated deficiencies in fetal thalamocortical axons. Manipulation of the maternal microbiome and microbial metabolites during pregnancy yielded adult offspring with altered tactile sensitivity in two aversive somatosensory behavioural tasks, but no overt differences in many other sensorimotor behaviours. Together, our findings show that the maternal gut microbiome promotes fetal thalamocortical axonogenesis, probably through signalling by microbially modulated metabolites to neurons in the developing brain."
https://openalex.org/W3088138537,"To constrain global warming, we must strongly curtail greenhouse gas emissions and capture excess atmospheric carbon dioxide1,2. Regrowing natural forests is a prominent strategy for capturing additional carbon3, but accurate assessments of its potential are limited by uncertainty and variability in carbon accumulation rates2,3. To assess why and where rates differ, here we compile 13,112 georeferenced measurements of carbon accumulation. Climatic factors explain variation in rates better than land-use history, so we combine the field measurements with 66 environmental covariate layers to create a global, one-kilometre-resolution map of potential aboveground carbon accumulation rates for the first 30 years of natural forest regrowth. This map shows over 100-fold variation in rates across the globe, and indicates that default rates from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)4,5 may underestimate aboveground carbon accumulation rates by 32 per cent on average and do not capture eight-fold variation within ecozones. Conversely, we conclude that maximum climate mitigation potential from natural forest regrowth is 11 per cent lower than previously reported3 owing to the use of overly high rates for the location of potential new forest. Although our data compilation includes more studies and sites than previous efforts, our results depend on data availability, which is concentrated in ten countries, and data quality, which varies across studies. However, the plots cover most of the environmental conditions across the areas for which we predicted carbon accumulation rates (except for northern Africa and northeast Asia). We therefore provide a robust and globally consistent tool for assessing natural forest regrowth as a climate mitigation strategy. A one-kilometre-resolution map of aboveground carbon accumulation rates of forest regrowth shows 100-fold variation across the globe, with rates 32% higher on average than IPCC estimates."
https://openalex.org/W3088246260,"The genetic circuits that allow cancer cells to evade destruction by the host immune system remain poorly understood1-3. Here, to identify a phenotypically robust core set of genes and pathways that enable cancer cells to evade killing mediated by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), we performed genome-wide CRISPR screens across a panel of genetically diverse mouse cancer cell lines that were cultured in the presence of CTLs. We identify a core set of 182 genes across these mouse cancer models, the individual perturbation of which increases either the sensitivity or the resistance of cancer cells to CTL-mediated toxicity. Systematic exploration of our dataset using genetic co-similarity reveals the hierarchical and coordinated manner in which genes and pathways act in cancer cells to orchestrate their evasion of CTLs, and shows that discrete functional modules that control the interferon response and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-induced cytotoxicity are dominant sub-phenotypes. Our data establish a central role for genes that were previously identified as negative regulators of the type-II interferon response (for example, Ptpn2, Socs1 and Adar1) in mediating CTL evasion, and show that the lipid-droplet-related gene Fitm2 is required for maintaining cell fitness after exposure to interferon-γ (IFNγ). In addition, we identify the autophagy pathway as a conserved mediator of the evasion of CTLs by cancer cells, and show that this pathway is required to resist cytotoxicity induced by the cytokines IFNγ and TNF. Through the mapping of cytokine- and CTL-based genetic interactions, together with in vivo CRISPR screens, we show how the pleiotropic effects of autophagy control cancer-cell-intrinsic evasion of killing by CTLs and we highlight the importance of these effects within the tumour microenvironment. Collectively, these data expand our knowledge of the genetic circuits that are involved in the evasion of the immune system by cancer cells, and highlight genetic interactions that contribute to phenotypes associated with escape from killing by CTLs."

https://openalex.org/W3087859979,"The consolidation of spatial memory depends on the reactivation ('replay') of hippocampal place cells that were active during recent behaviour. Such reactivation is observed during sharp-wave ripples (SWRs)-synchronous oscillatory electrical events that occur during non-rapid-eye-movement (non-REM) sleep1-8 and whose disruption impairs spatial memory3,5,6,8. Although the hippocampus also encodes a wide range of non-spatial forms of declarative memory, it is not yet known whether SWRs are necessary for such memories. Moreover, although SWRs can arise from either the CA3 or the CA2 region of the hippocampus7,9, the relative importance of SWRs from these regions for memory consolidation is unknown. Here we examine the role of SWRs during the consolidation of social memory-the ability of an animal to recognize and remember a member of the same species-focusing on CA2 because of its essential role in social memory10-12. We find that ensembles of CA2 pyramidal neurons that are active during social exploration of previously unknown conspecifics are reactivated during SWRs. Notably, disruption or enhancement of CA2 SWRs suppresses or prolongs social memory, respectively. Thus, SWR-mediated reactivation of hippocampal firing related to recent experience appears to be a general mechanism for binding spatial, temporal and sensory information into high-order memory representations, including social memory."
https://openalex.org/W3102522879,"Magnetic skyrmions are topological solitons with a nanoscale winding spin texture that hold promise for spintronics applications. Until now, skyrmions have been observed in a variety of magnets that exhibit nearly parallel alignment for the neighbouring spins, but theoretically, skyrmions with anti-parallel neighbouring spins are also possible. The latter, antiferromagnetic skyrmions, may allow more flexible control compared to the conventional ferromagnetic skyrmions. Here, by combining neutron scattering and Monte Carlo simulations, we show that a fractional antiferromagnetic skyrmion lattice with an incipient meron character is stabilized in MnSc$_2$S$_4$ through anisotropic couplings. Our work demonstrates that the theoretically proposed antiferromagnetic skyrmions can be stabilized in real materials and represents an important step towards implementing the antiferromagnetic-skyrmion based spintronic devices."

https://openalex.org/W3087765001,"Post-translational modifications (PTMs) greatly expand the structures and functions of proteins in nature1,2. Although synthetic protein functionalization strategies allow mimicry of PTMs3,4, as well as formation of unnatural protein variants with diverse potential functions, including drug carrying5, tracking, imaging6 and partner crosslinking7, the range of functional groups that can be introduced remains limited. Here we describe the visible-light-driven installation of side chains at dehydroalanine residues in proteins through the formation of carbon-centred radicals that allow C–C bond formation in water. Control of the reaction redox allows site-selective modification with good conversions and reduced protein damage. In situ generation of boronic acid catechol ester derivatives generates RH2C• radicals that form the native (β-CH2–γ-CH2) linkage of natural residues and PTMs, whereas in situ potentiation of pyridylsulfonyl derivatives by Fe(ii) generates RF2C• radicals that form equivalent β-CH2–γ-CF2 linkages bearing difluoromethylene labels. These reactions are chemically tolerant and incorporate a wide range of functionalities (more than 50 unique residues/side chains) into diverse protein scaffolds and sites. Initiation can be applied chemoselectively in the presence of sensitive groups in the radical precursors, enabling installation of previously incompatible side chains. The resulting protein function and reactivity are used to install radical precursors for homolytic on-protein radical generation; to study enzyme function with natural, unnatural and CF2-labelled post-translationally modified protein substrates via simultaneous sensing of both chemo- and stereoselectivity; and to create generalized ‘alkylator proteins’ with a spectrum of heterolytic covalent-bond-forming activity (that is, reacting diversely with small molecules at one extreme or selectively with protein targets through good mimicry at the other). Post-translational access to such reactions and chemical groups on proteins could be useful in both revealing and creating protein function. A wide range of side chains are installed into proteins by addition of photogenerated alkyl or difluroalkyl radicals, providing access to new functionality and reactivity in proteins."
https://openalex.org/W3028652260,"The current outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an unprecedented example of how fast an infectious disease can spread around the globe (especially in urban areas) and the enormous impact it causes on public health and socio-economic activities. Despite the recent surge of investigations about different aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we still know little about the effects of city size on the propagation of this disease in urban areas. Here we investigate how the number of cases and deaths by COVID-19 scale with the population of Brazilian cities. Our results indicate small towns are proportionally more affected by COVID-19 during the initial spread of the disease, such that the cumulative numbers of cases and deaths per capita initially decrease with population size. However, during the long-term course of the pandemic, this urban advantage vanishes and large cities start to exhibit higher incidence of cases and deaths, such that every 1% rise in population is associated with a 0.14% increase in the number of fatalities per capita after about four months since the first two daily deaths. We argue that these patterns may be related to the existence of proportionally more health infrastructure in the largest cities and a lower proportion of older adults in large urban areas. We also find the initial growth rate of cases and deaths to be higher in large cities; however, these growth rates tend to decrease in large cities and to increase in small ones over time."
https://openalex.org/W3088935311,"Although cell transplantation can rescue motor defects in Parkinson's disease (PD) models, whether and how grafts functionally repair damaged neural circuitry in the adult brain is not known. We transplanted hESC-derived midbrain dopamine (mDA) or cortical glutamate neurons into the substantia nigra or striatum of a mouse PD model and found extensive graft integration with host circuitry. Axonal pathfinding toward the dorsal striatum was determined by the identity of the grafted neurons, and anatomical presynaptic inputs were largely dependent on graft location, whereas inhibitory versus excitatory input was dictated by the identity of grafted neurons. hESC-derived mDA neurons display A9 characteristics and restore functionality of the reconstructed nigrostriatal circuit to mediate improvements in motor function. These results indicate similarity in cell-type-specific pre- and post-synaptic integration between transplant-reconstructed circuit and endogenous neural networks, highlighting the capacity of hPSC-derived neuron subtypes for specific circuit repair and functional restoration in the adult brain."
https://openalex.org/W3088572354,"The three-dimensional organization of the genome supports regulated gene expression, recombination, DNA repair, and chromosome segregation during mitosis. Chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C)1,2 analysis has revealed a complex genomic landscape of internal chromosomal structures in vertebrate cells3-7, but the identical sequence of sister chromatids has made it difficult to determine how they topologically interact in replicated chromosomes. Here we describe sister-chromatid-sensitive Hi-C (scsHi-C), which is based on labelling of nascent DNA with 4-thio-thymidine and nucleoside conversion chemistry. Genome-wide conformation maps of human chromosomes reveal that sister-chromatid pairs interact most frequently at the boundaries of topologically associating domains (TADs). Continuous loading of a dynamic cohesin pool separates sister-chromatid pairs inside TADs and is required to focus sister-chromatid contacts at TAD boundaries. We identified a subset of TADs that are overall highly paired and are characterized by facultative heterochromatin and insulated topological domains that form separately within individual sister chromatids. The rich pattern of sister-chromatid topologies and our scsHi-C technology will make it possible to investigate how physical interactions between identical DNA molecules contribute to DNA repair, gene expression, chromosome segregation, and potentially other biological processes."
https://openalex.org/W3088870322,"CpG methylation by de novo DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) 3A and 3B is essential for mammalian development and differentiation and is frequently dysregulated in cancer1. These two DNMTs preferentially bind to nucleosomes, yet cannot methylate the DNA wrapped around the nucleosome core2, and they favour the methylation of linker DNA at positioned nucleosomes3,4. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of a ternary complex of catalytically competent DNMT3A2, the catalytically inactive accessory subunit DNMT3B3 and a nucleosome core particle flanked by linker DNA. The catalytic-like domain of the accessory DNMT3B3 binds to the acidic patch of the nucleosome core, which orients the binding of DNMT3A2 to the linker DNA. The steric constraints of this arrangement suggest that nucleosomal DNA must be moved relative to the nucleosome core for de novo methylation to occur."
https://openalex.org/W3088036532,"Natural products serve as chemical blueprints for most antibiotics in clinical use. The evolutionary process by which these molecules arise is inherently accompanied by the co-evolution of resistance mechanisms that shorten the clinical lifetime of any given class of antibiotics1. Virginiamycin acetyltransferase (Vat) enzymes are resistance proteins that provide protection against streptogramins2, potent antibiotics against Gram-positive bacteria that inhibit the bacterial ribosome3. Owing to the challenge of selectively modifying the chemically complex, 23-membered macrocyclic scaffold of group A streptogramins, analogues that overcome the resistance conferred by Vat enzymes have not been previously developed2. Here we report the design, synthesis, and antibacterial evaluation of group A streptogramin antibiotics with extensive structural variability. Using cryo-electron microscopy and forcefield-based refinement, we characterize the binding of eight analogues to the bacterial ribosome at high resolution, revealing binding interactions that extend into the peptidyl tRNA-binding site and towards synergistic binders that occupy the nascent peptide exit tunnel. One of these analogues has excellent activity against several streptogramin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus, exhibits decreased rates of acetylation in vitro, and is effective at lowering bacterial load in a mouse model of infection. Our results demonstrate that the combination of rational design and modular chemical synthesis can revitalize classes of antibiotics that are limited by naturally arising resistance mechanisms."

https://openalex.org/W3088091885,"Alginate lyases play important roles in alginate degradation in the ocean. Although a large number of alginate lyases have been characterized, little is yet known about those in extremely cold polar environments, which may have unique mechanisms for environmental adaptation and for alginate degradation. Here, we report the characterization of a novel PL7 alginate lyase AlyC3 from Psychromonas sp. C-3 isolated from the Arctic brown alga Laminaria, including its phylogenetic classification, catalytic properties, and structure. We propose the establishment of a new PM-specific subfamily of PL7 (subfamily 6) represented by AlyC3 based on phylogenetic analysis and enzymatic properties. Structural and biochemical analyses showed that AlyC3 is a dimer, representing the first dimeric endo-alginate lyase structure. AlyC3 is activated by NaCl and adopts a novel salt-activated mechanism; that is, salinity adjusts the enzymatic activity by affecting its aggregation states. We further solved the structure of an inactive mutant H127A/Y244A in complex with a dimannuronate molecule and proposed the catalytic process of AlyC3 based on structural and biochemical analyses. We show that Arg82 and Tyr190 at the two ends of the catalytic canyon help the positioning of the repeated units of the substrate and that His127, Tyr244, Arg78, and Gln125 mediate the catalytic reaction.

This study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms of alginate degradation by alginate lyases. Alginate is a linear polysaccharide present in great abundance in brown seaweeds, accounting for ∼40% dry weight of brown algae (1Meillisa A. Woo H.C. Chun B.S. Production of monosaccharides and bio-active compounds derived from marine polysaccharides using subcritical water hydrolysis.Food Chem. 2015; 171 (25308644): 70-7710.1016/j.foodchem.2014.08.097Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Brown seaweeds are the most productive algae in marine ecosystems. For example, kelp forests produce large amounts of biomass rapidly, forming the basis of coastal food webs and constituting an important carbon sink (2Smith S.V. Marine macrophytes as a global carbon sink.Science. 1981; 211 (17740399): 838-84010.1126/science.211.4484.838Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Therefore, alginate is an important marine polysaccharide and carrier of the marine carbon cycle. In addition to brown algae, alginate has also been found in some red algae (3Usov A.I. Bilan M.I. Klochkova N.G. Polysaccharides of algae: 48. Polysaccharide composition of several calcareous red algae: isolation of alginate from Corallina pilulifera P. et R. (Rhodophyta, Corallinaceae).Bot. Mar. 1995; 38: 43-5110.1515/botm.1995.38.1-6.43Crossref Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and some marine bacteria belonging to the genera Azotobacter (4Gorin P.A.J. Spencer J.F.T. Exocellular alginic acid from Azotobacter vinelandii.Can. J. Chem. 1966; 44: 993-99810.1139/v66-147Crossref Google Scholar) and Pseudomonas (5Linker A. Jones R.S. A new polysaccharide resembling alginic acid isolated from Pseudomonads.J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241 (5916397): 3845-3851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alginate composes of two monomeric units, β-d-mannuronate (M) and its C5 epimer α-l-guluronate. These two units arrange in three ways: polymannuronate (PM), polyguluronate (PG), and heteropolymeric random sequences. Alginate is widely used as viscosifier, stabilizer, and gelling agent because of its unique gel-forming property. Alginate oligomers with various degree of polymerization may have different biological activities, such as regulating physiological processes in plants (6Hu X.K. Jiang X.L. Hwang H.M. Liu S.L. Guan H.S. Promotive effects of alginate-derived oligosaccharide on maize seed germination.J. Appl. Phycol. 2004; 16: 73-7610.1023/B:JAPH.0000019139.35046.0cCrossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and stimulating production of the cytokines (7Iwamoto M. Kurachi M. Nakashima T. Kim D. Yamaguchi K. Oda T. Iwamoto Y. Muramatsu T. Structure–activity relationship of alginate oligosaccharides in the induction of cytokine production from RAW264.7 cells.FEBS Lett. 2005; 579 (16055120): 4423-442910.1016/j.febslet.2005.07.007Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Alginate lyases are synthesized by marine algae, marine mollusks, fungi, bacteria, and viruses, which play important roles in the degradation and assimilation of alginate. They degrade alginate via β-elimination reaction, targeting the glycosidic 1,4-O-linkage between the monomers, and generate oligosaccharide or monosaccharide products containing 4-deoxy-l-erythro-hex-4-enopyranosyluronic acid as the nonreducing terminal moiety. Alginate lyases have wide applications in the agricultural, food, and pharmaceutical industry (8Wong T.Y. Preston L.A. Schiller N.L. Alginate lyase: review of major sources and enzyme characteristics, structure–function analysis, biological roles, and applications.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2000; 54 (11018131): 289-34010.1146/annurev.micro.54.1.289Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Alginate lyases are promising enzymes for the treatment of chronic lung infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9Islan G.A. Bosio V.E. Castro G.R.

The synergistic action of endo- and exolytic alginate lyases have remarkable potential for the production of biofuels by deconstructing the alginate-rich algal cell walls into monosaccharides (10Wargacki A.J.

Therefore, research on the characteristics and molecular catalytic mechanisms of alginate lyases is important to understand the degradation and recycling of alginate in the ocean and to facilitate the development of their industrial applications. Based on the substrate specificities, alginate lyases can be classified into PM-specific lyases (EC 4.2.2.3), PG-specific lyases (EC 4.2.2.11), and bifunctional lyases that can degrade both PM and PG (EC 4.2.2.-). According to the lytic mode, alginate lyases are classified into endolytic and exolytic alginate lyases. Endolytic alginate lyases cleave glycosidic bonds inside polymers and release unsaturated oligosaccharides, whereas exolytic ones remove monomers or dimers from the ends of polymers. According to amino acid sequence similarity, alginate lyases are classified into 10 polysaccharide lyase (PL) families (PL5, 6, 7, 14, 15, 17, 18, 32, 34, and 36) in the Carbohydrate-Active enZYmes (CAZy) database (8Wong T.Y. Preston L.A. Schiller N.L. Alginate lyase: review of major sources and enzyme characteristics, structure–function analysis, biological roles, and applications.Annu. Rev.

Among these, the alginate lyases from the PL7, PL15, and PL17 families are mostly isolated from marine organisms (13Hehemann J.H. Boraston A.B. Czjzek M.

Among the alginate lyase genes, the genes of the PL7 family alginate lyases are the most abundant and widely distributed in nature. The PL7 family contains alginate lyases from bacteria, eukaryotes, and viruses. Both endolytic and exolytic alginate lyases are found in this family (14Thomas F. Lundqvist L.C.E. Jam M. Jeudy A.

The PL7 family is further divided into five subfamilies in the CAZy database (18Lombard V. Bernard T. Rancurel C. Brumer H. Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B.

Although the majority of the sequences in this family are classified into corresponding subfamilies, some sequences are still unclassified because of the lack of knowledge about their enzymatic characteristics. The Arctic Ocean has extreme conditions noticeably for its low temperature and year-round existing ice cover. Bacteria in the Arctic Ocean are adapted to the extreme environment in their ecology and physiology. Therefore, the alginate lyases secreted by alginate-degrading strains from the Arctic may have unique properties and unique adaptive mechanisms. Up to now, only one thermostable alginate lyase from a hot vent in the Arctic mid-ocean ridge has been investigated (19Vuoristo K.S. Fredriksen L. Oftebro M. Arntzen M.O. Aarstad O.A. Stokke R.

Drugs. 2012; 10 (23203272): 2481-249110.3390/md10112481Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Basing on multiple sequence alignment, we propose that AlyC3 and several other unclassified putative alginate lyases form a new PM-specific subfamily of PL7 (subfamily 6). We report the characterization of AlyC3 and demonstrate that AlyC3 is a polar alginate lyase with characteristics compatible with the polar environment with low temperatures and high salinity. Moreover, we solved the structure of AlyC3, the first dimeric endolytic alginate lyase, and found that dimerization is an adaptive strategy of AlyC3 to the seawater salinity. We report the structure of an inactive mutant in complex with disaccharides and uncover the key residues involved in the positioning of the substrate and subsequent catalysis. The discovery of this novel PL7 alginate lyase AlyC3 broadens our understanding of the PL7 alginate lyases and alginate degradation by cold-adapted alginate lyases of polar origins. Psychromonas sp. C-3 is a cold-adapted strain isolated from the Arctic brown alga, which can use alginate as the carbon source for growth (20Dong S. Yang J. Zhang X.Y. Shi M. Song X.Y. Chen X.L. Zhang Y.Z. Cultivable alginate lyase-excreting bacteria associated with the Arctic brown alga Laminaria.Mar. Drugs. 2012; 10 (23203272): 2481-249110.3390/md10112481Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We sequenced the whole genome of Psychromonas sp. C-3 and found that gene alyC3 in the genome is annotated as an alginate lyase gene. alyC3 is 861 bp in length and encodes a putative alginate lyase (AlyC3) of 286 amino acid residues with a predicted 20-residue signal peptide. Blast search results against the NCBI nonredundant protein database show that the AlyC3 protein (unless otherwise stated, AlyC3 discussed hereafter is the mature enzyme of 267 residues without the predicted signal peptide) has the highest identity (76.83%) to AlyVOA, a characterized PL7 alginate lyase from Vibrio sp. O2 isolated from seawater in the Mihonoseki Harbor in Japan (21Kawamoto H. Horibe A. Miki Y. Kimura T. Tanaka K. Nakagawa T. Kawamukai M. Matsuda H. Cloning and sequencing analysis of alginate lyase genes from the marine bacterium Vibrio sp. O2.Mar. Biotechnol. (NY). 2006; 8 (16810458): 481-49010.1007/s10126-005-6157-zCrossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Although most of the PL7 enzymes in the CAZy database are classified into five subfamilies, some PL7 lyases have not yet been attributed to any subfamily because of their low sequence similarities to others in the database. We performed phylogenetic analysis of AlyC3 with 36 other PL7 alginate lyases from existing subfamilies and 14 unclassified sequences using maximum likelihood, neighbor joining, and minimum evolution methods (Fig. 1 and Figs. S1 and S2). These include representative alginate lyases from each subfamily, including six sequences from subfamily 2 and seven sequences from subfamily 4. It is worth noting that only one subfamily 4 alginate lyase is characterized, and no subfamily 2 alginate lyase is characterized to date. The result shows that these sequences are grouped into six clusters (Fig. 1 and Figs. S1 and S2). Enzymes that have been attributed to subfamilies in the CAZy database are assigned to the corresponding subfamily clusters. AlyC3 clustered with six other sequences, forming a separate monophyletic branch. We therefore propose that these seven enzymes form a new subfamily, subfamily 6, of the PL7 family. Among the enzymes of subfamily 6, four have been characterized previously, that is, AlyVOA (ABB36771.1) (21Kawamoto H. Horibe A. Miki Y. Kimura T. Tanaka K. Nakagawa T. Kawamukai M. Matsuda H.

To characterize AlyC3, gene alyC3 was cloned from the genome of Psychromonas sp. C-3 and overexpressed in Escherichia coli without the putative signal peptide sequence. With alginate sodium as the substrate, the purified recombinant AlyC3 exhibited the highest activity at pH 8.0 and 20 °C and retained 48.2% of its maximum activity at 1 °C (Fig. 2, A and B). AlyC3 showed poor thermal stability, unstable at temperatures of 30 °C and above (Fig. 2C). These characteristics indicate that AlyC3 is a cold-active enzyme, well-adapted to the cold and alkaline environment of the Arctic Ocean. AlyC3 is the first reported cold-active alginate lyase isolated from the polar region. The only Arctic origin alginate lyase reported so far is AMOR_PL7A from an Arctic hot vent, which is a thermophilic enzyme, with the highest activity at 65 °C and pH 6.0 (19Vuoristo K.S.

AlyC3 displayed the highest activity toward PM and no activity toward PG (Fig. 2D), indicating that AlyC3 is a PM-specific lyase. As shown in Fig. 1, PL7 lyases from different subfamilies have different substrate specificity characteristics. All of the four characterized subfamily 1 alginate lyases are bifunctional, whereas most alginate lyases from subfamilies 3 and 5 are PG-specific or bifunctional. The only characterized subfamily 4 enzyme is a glucuronan lyase. AlyC3 and the other four characterized alginate lyases of subfamily 6, including AlyVOA, AlyVOB, AlxM, and A9mT, are all PM-specific alginate lyases (21Kawamoto H. Horibe A. Miki Y. Kimura T.

AlyC3 could not degrade trimannuronate into smaller products but could degrade tetramannuronate into ΔMM (Δ represents 4-deoxy-l-erythro-hex-4-enopyranosyluronic acid) and monosaccharide, suggesting that the minimum substrate for AlyC3 is tetramannuronate. When using pentamannuronate as the substrate, ΔMMM, ΔMM, and a trace amount of ΔM and Δ were produced. When hexmannuronate was degraded by AlyC3 for 10 min, a large amount of ΔMM and small amounts of ΔMMMM, ΔMMM, and ΔM were produced. These results indicate that AlyC3 is an endolytic lyase, with ΔMM as the main product (Fig. 3). Altogether, these results show that AlyC3 is a cold-active and PM-specific endo-alginate lyase. Several cold-active alginate lyases have been reported, which all have an optimum temperature no less than 30 °C (24Li S. Yang X. Zhang L. Yu W. Han F.

Therefore, AlyC3 has the lowest optimum temperature (20 °C) among reported alginate lyases to date. Similarity search at the Protein Data Bank (PDB) database showed that no suitable structure model can be used for AlyC3 structure construction. Therefore, we solved the crystal structure of WT AlyC3 by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion method using a selenomethionine derivative. The crystal of WT AlyC3 belongs to the P 21 21 21 space group, and the structure was solved to 2.1 Å resolution (Table 1). Structure data show that each asymmetric unit contains two AlyC3 molecules of 264 residues (Asn2–Glu265), and each molecule binds one glycerol molecule and one succinic acid molecule, both of which came from the buffer solution (Fig. 4A).Table 1Diffraction data and refinement statistics of SeMet-AlyC3, WT AlyC3, and H127A/Y244A–M2ParametersSeMet AlyC3WT AlyC3H127A/Y244A–M2Data collection Space groupP 4P 21 21 21C 1 2 1 Unit cellaNumbers in parentheses refer to data in the highest resolution shell.a (Å)44.3844.9080.87b (Å)44.3845.60106.41c (Å)306.68305.8879.29α (°)90.0090.0090.00β (°)90.0090.0093.85γ (°)90.0090.0090.00 Wavelength (Å)0.97910.97910.9791 Resolution (Å)50.00–2.80 (2.80–2.90)50.00–2.10 (2.10–2.18)50.00–1.46 (1.46–1.51) Redundancy7.5 (7.4)7.0 (6.6)3.4 (3.3) Completeness (%)99.9 (100.0)98.8 (99.3)98.1 (99.5) RmergebRmerge = ΣhklΣi|I(hkl)i − <I(hkl)>|/ΣhklΣi <I(hkl)i>.0.123 (0.438)0.110 (0.410)0.035 (0.219) I/σ29.54 (7.52)31.84 (5.96)40.78 (4.71)Refinement statistics Resolution (Å)43.08–2.10 (2.10–2.18)30.35–1.46 (1.51–1.46) Rwork (%)20.70 (25.69)15.90 (21.02) Rfree (%)27.11 (30.10)17.20 (23.57) B-factor (Å2)Protein35.2823.29Solvent38.2338.29Ligands38.3551.07 RMSD from ideal geometryLength (Å)0.0080.014Angles (°)0.971.24 Ramachandran plot (%)cThe Ramachandran plot was calculated by the PROCHECK program in the CCP4i program package.Favored95.0097.00Allowed4.203.00a Numbers in parentheses refer to data in the highest resolution shell.b Rmerge = ΣhklΣi|I(hkl)i − <I(hkl)>|/ΣhklΣi <I(hkl)i>.c The Ramachandran plot was calculated by the PROCHECK program in the CCP4i program package.

Sheet A (SA) consists of nine β-strands: SA1 (Glu43–Phe45), SA2 (Ser28–Ile32), SA3 (His76–Val83), SA4 (Leu236–Ala241), SA5 (Val242–Gln246), SA6 (Asn119–Gly130), SA7 (Leu143–Lys149), SA8 (Gly157–Lys164), and SA9 (Tyr190–Gly196). Sheet B (SB) consists of seven β-strands: SB1 (Phe59–Asp62), SB2 (Asp66–Lys73), SB3 (Met251–Leu264), SB4 (Leu95–Ile104), SB5 (Thr204–Gly211), SB6 (Gln214–Val219), and SB7 (Lys222–Asp228) (Fig. 4B). All of the β-strands use an antiparallel arrangement. The sheet A shapes a cleft and forms a positively charged groove in the middle of AlyC3. The succinic acid and glycerol molecules are mainly bound to the SA7 and SA4, respectively (Fig. 4B). Gel filtration data showed that AlyC3 exists as a dimer in 0.5 m NaCl solution, consistent with the structure result (Fig. 4C). In AlyC3 dimer, the two subunits are arranged upside down in parallel (Fig. 4A). Almost all the residues involved in the interfacing of the two monomers are on the loops connecting SA3–SB4, SA6–SA7, SA8–SA9, and SB7–SA4 of each monomer (Fig. 4, A and B). Up to now, no endolytic dimeric alginate lyases have been reported, and only the structures of two dimeric exolytic alginate lyases (AlyGC from PL6 and AlyA5 from PL7) have been reported (14Thomas F.

Thus, AlyC3 represents the first dimeric structure of endolytic alginate lyases. The interfaces of the two dimeric exolytic alginate lyases are different from that of AlyC3 (Fig. 4D).

https://openalex.org/W3089299640,"Protein–protein interactions (PPIs) are essential for most biological processes. However, current PPI networks present high levels of noise, sparseness and incompleteness, which limits our ability to understand the cell at the system level from the PPI network. Predicting novel (missing) links in noisy PPI networks is an essential computational method for automatically expanding the human interactome and for identifying biologically legitimate but undetected interactions for experimental determination of PPIs, which is both expensive and time-consuming. Recently, graph convolutional networks (GCN) have shown their effectiveness in modeling graph-structured data, which employ a 1-hop neighborhood aggregation procedure and have emerged as a powerful architecture for node or graph representations. In this paper, we propose a novel node (protein) embedding method by combining GCN and PageRank as the latter can significantly improve the GCN’s aggregation scheme, which has difficulty in extending and exploring topological information of networks across higher-order neighborhoods of each node. Building on this novel node embedding model, we develop a higher-order GCN variational auto-encoder (HO-VGAE) architecture, which can learn a joint node representation of higher-order local and global PPI network topology for novel protein interaction prediction. It is worth noting that our method is based exclusively on network topology, with no protein attributes or extra biological features used. Extensive computational validations on PPI prediction task demonstrate our method without leveraging any additional biological information shows competitive performance—outperforms all existing graph embedding-based link prediction methods in both accuracy and robustness."
https://openalex.org/W3088533726,"Thyroid hormones are important for homeostatic control of energy metabolism and body temperature. Although skeletal muscle is considered a key site for thyroid action, the contribution of thyroid hormone receptor signaling in muscle to whole-body energy metabolism and body temperature has not been resolved. Here, we show that T3-induced increase in energy expenditure requires thyroid hormone receptor alpha 1 (TRα1) in skeletal muscle, but that T3-mediated elevation in body temperature is achieved in the absence of muscle-TRα1. In slow-twitch soleus muscle, loss-of-function of TRα1 (TRαHSACre) alters the fiber-type composition toward a more oxidative phenotype. The change in fiber-type composition, however, does not influence the running capacity or motivation to run. RNA-sequencing of soleus muscle from WT mice and TRαHSACre mice revealed differentiated transcriptional regulation of genes associated with muscle thermogenesis, such as sarcolipin and UCP3, providing molecular clues pertaining to the mechanistic underpinnings of TRα1-linked control of whole-body metabolic rate. Together, this work establishes a fundamental role for skeletal muscle in T3-stimulated increase in whole-body energy expenditure."

Sensory perception, cognition, and action arise from the activity of populations of interconnected neurons across the brain. Researchers have relied on a versatile toolbox of experimental and analytical approaches to identify such activity patterns and to formulate models of underlying circuit mechanisms (Dal Maschio et al., 2017Dal Maschio M. Donovan J.C. Helmbrecht T.O. Baier H.

However, in many cases, it remains a challenge to distill causal relationships from correlative information because of the abundance of co-active neurons and their broad distribution across the brain. A case in point is recent whole-brain imaging studies in larval zebrafish, which demonstrated a large number (in the hundreds) and widespread distribution of direction-selective (DS) neurons responding to horizontal motion (Naumann et al., 2016Naumann E.A. Fitzgerald J.E. Dunn T.W. Rihel J. Sompolinsky H. Engert F.

Many of these neurons were active when the animal performed optomotor or optokinetic behavior to adjust its swimming direction or gaze according to the perceived optic flow. This observation has been taken as evidence for distributed network activity, even for simple reflexive behaviors (Naumann et al., 2016Naumann E.A. Fitzgerald J.E. Dunn T.W. Rihel J. Sompolinsky H. Engert F. From Whole-Brain Data to Functional Circuit Models: The Zebrafish Optomotor Response.Cell. 2016; 167: 947-960.e20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). An alternative interpretation of these results argues that the stream of behavior-causing activity is, in fact, limited to a “labeled line” of a few sequentially connected areas. In this view, the majority of co-active neurons outside of this core stream might process corollary or feedback information or might be involved in motion-dependent behaviors unrelated to the optomotor or optokinetic response. Disentangling causation from correlation requires necessity and sufficiency experiments on each of the candidate neuronal subsets—a daunting task, given the sheer number of testable combinations. To narrow down the neural candidates responsible for global rotational motion perception in larval zebrafish, we took advantage of a classical optical illusion called the motion aftereffect (MAE). The MAE describes the phenomenon where, after prolonged exposure to a visual scene moving in one direction (e.g., a waterfall), stationary objects (e.g., the rocks near the waterfall) appear to drift in the opposite direction. The existence of the MAE has been documented in invertebrates (Srinivasan and Dvorak, 1979Srinivasan M.V. Dvorak D.R.

Negative optokinetic afternystagmus in larval zebrafish demonstrates set-point adaptation.Scientific Reports. 2019; (19039)Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Given the unique scenario of motion perception in the absence of visual motion, we reasoned that DS neurons that are active during the MAE might play a causal role in global rotational motion perception. If so, then MAE responsiveness might serve as a signature to tag DS neurons that sit within the core stream of global rotational motion processing. To test this hypothesis, we leveraged the optical and genetic access of larval zebrafish to identify and manipulate individual DS neurons with MAE responsiveness. Because larval zebrafish cannot self-report motion perception, we resorted to measuring their eye movements as a readout. First we confirmed that larval zebrafish were indeed susceptible to the MAE. We then found, by rapid two-photon calcium imaging of a volume that included the pretectum, thalamus, and tectum, that MAE-correlated responses highlighted a subpopulation of DS neurons. Registration to a common standard brain revealed that MAE-correlated neurons form spatial clusters in the ventral-lateral pretectum. By photoablation and optogenetic activation, we showed that a small number of neurons in this cluster are indispensable and also sufficient for a global motion-induced optokinetic response (OKR). Together, these results favor a labeled-line organization in the neural circuitry for optic flow processing. To study the MAE in larval zebrafish, we designed a three-phase visual stimulus protocol presented by a panorama arena (Figure 1A). Continuously rotating gratings in one direction were presented in the conditioning phase, whereas stationary gratings were presented in the pre-phase and the test phase (Figure 1B). We measured the eye movements of zebrafish larvae as a readout of motion perception (Figure 1A). Normally, presentation of grating motion in the visual scene elicits the optokinetic reflex (OKR), which consists of cycles of slow-phase eye movements in the motion direction interspersed with reset saccades in the opposite direction (e.g., the conditioning phase; Figure 1C; Easter and Nicola, 1997Easter Jr., S.S. Nicola G.N. The development of eye movements in the zebrafish (Danio rerio).Dev. Psychobiol. 1997; 31: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to spontaneous eye movements observed when a stationary visual scene is presented that consists of brief fixation periods interspersed with saccades alternating in clockwise (CW) and counterclockwise (CCW) directions (e.g., the pre-phase; Figure 1C). Interestingly, when the static pattern was presented again after prolonged motion stimulation in the conditioning phase, the fish did not perform spontaneous eye movements as in the pre-phase. Instead, they showed reversed OKR-like eye movements for a certain period, suggesting that they perceived motion in the opposite direction with respect to the conditioning motion (the test phase; Figure 1C). Similar to the MAE in humans (Braun et al., 2006Braun D.I. Pracejus L. Gegenfurtner K.R. Motion aftereffect elicits smooth pursuit eye movements.J. Vis. 2006; 6: 671-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar; Gardner et al., 2004Gardner J.L. Tokiyama S.N. Lisberger S.G. A population decoding framework for motion aftereffects on smooth pursuit eye movements.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9035-9048Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), the reversed OKR in zebrafish exhibited lower velocities and smaller amplitudes compared with the OKR in response to the conditioning motion (Figures S1A and S1B). To determine the best stimulus parameters to induce an MAE, we systematically varied the duration and speed of the conditioning motion (Figure 1D). We quantified the eye movements using an OKR index (OKR index = number of CW saccades over 60 s – number of CCW saccades over 60 s) (Page-McCaw et al., 2004Page-McCaw P.S. Chung S.C. Muto A. Roeser T. Staub W. Finger-Baier K.C. Korenbrot J.I. Baier H. Retinal network adaptation to bright light requires tyrosinase.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 1329-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This index is negative when a fish sees motion in the direction of the conditioning phase, positive when a fish sees the opposite motion, and about zero when a fish sees no motion. We found that induction of an MAE depended on the duration of the conditioning motion, whereas the speed in the range tested had negligible effects (Figures 1E–1G and S1C–S1J). This finding is consistent with previous measurements in larval zebrafish (Pérez-Schuster et al., 2016Pérez-Schuster V. Kulkarni A. Nouvian M. Romano S.A. Lygdas K. Jouary A. Dipoppa M. Pietri T.

Candat V. et al.Sustained Rhythmic Brain Activity Underlies Visual Motion Perception in Zebrafish.Cell Rep. 2016; 17: 1098-1112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Almost all fish (92%) exhibited MAEs when the conditioning motion was presented at 30°/s for 5 min, which was chosen for further experiments. Because in zebrafish the MAE manifests not only in terms of eye movements but also in terms of tail movements (Pérez-Schuster et al., 2016Pérez-Schuster V. Kulkarni A. Nouvian M. Romano S.A. Lygdas K. Jouary A. Dipoppa M. Pietri T. Haudrechy M.

Alerasool N. Moshtaghian J. The effect of motion aftereffect on optomotor response in larva and adult zebrafish.Neurosci. Lett. 2014; 559: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), it is assumed that the neural representation of the MAE is already generated close to the sensory periphery. To narrow down which brain regions are required for display of an MAE, we used GtACR2, an optogenetic silencer, to suppress the activity of candidate areas during the test phase (Figure 2A). With tissue-specific transgenic driver lines, we separately targeted retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons, the tectum, and the pretectum (Figure 2B). These areas have previously been shown to contain DS neurons in larval zebrafish (Hunter et al., 2013Hunter P.R. Lowe A.S. Thompson I.D. Meyer M.P.

Kulkarni A. Nouvian M. Romano S.A. Lygdas K. Jouary A. Dipoppa M. Pietri T. Haudrechy M. Candat V. et al.Sustained Rhythmic Brain Activity Underlies Visual Motion Perception in Zebrafish.Cell Rep. 2016; 17: 1098-1112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We quantified the eye movements using the OKR index. Although GtACR2 has been shown to have activating and inactivating effects depending on the subcellular site of activation (Malyshev et al., 2017Malyshev A.Y. Roshchin M.V. Smirnova G.R. Dolgikh D.A. Balaban P.M. Ostrovsky M.A. Chloride conducting light activated channel GtACR2 can produce both cessation of firing and generation of action potentials in cortical neurons in response to light.Neurosci. Lett. 2017; 640: 76-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), our optogenetic stimulation with simultaneous imaging and a visual stimulus demonstrated that GtACR2 activation mostly resulted in silencing of neural activity in tectal and pretectal neurons in larval zebrafish (Figures S2I–S2K). Moreover, broadly activating GtACR2 in an entire population led to general suppression of normal functions in the corresponding areas (Figures S2D–S2G). Fish with the RGC axons or the tectum silenced during the test phase still showed MAEs (Figures 2C and 2D). In contrast, the MAE was greatly diminished in pretectum-silenced fish, suggesting that an intact pretectum is required for the reversed OKR during the MAE (Figure 2E), whereas the retina or the tectum are dispensable. A widely accepted hypothesis attributes the MAE to an imbalance between oppositely tuned DS neurons because of adaptation during the conditioning motion (Sutherland, 1961Sutherland N.S. Figural After-Effects and Apparent Size.Q. J. Exp. Psychol. 1961; 13: 222-228Crossref Google Scholar). To determine the source of motion-induced adaptation, we optogenetically suppressed the tectum and the pretectum during the conditioning phase. The MAE was reduced significantly for tectum- and pretectum-silenced fish, suggesting that the adaptation in both areas contributed to the MAE (Figures 2F and 2G). Notably, the OKR behavior in the conditioning phase was severely impaired in pretectum-silenced fish. In some cases, it was replaced by spontaneous eye movements despite the presence of motion stimuli (Figure S2H). We ruled out the effects of (1) blue light stimulation by exposing non-expressing clutchmates to the same visual stimuli and light stimulation and of (2) genotype by subjecting GtACR2 expressers to the same visual stimuli without light stimulation (Figures 2H, 2I, and S2A–S2C). The observation that silencing of the pretectum strongly affected the OKR in response to real and illusory motion reinforces the notion that the MAE arises from motion-processing circuits in the pretectum. To further dissect out MAE-correlated DS neurons, we performed multiplane two-photon imaging with concurrent visual stimulation in fish expressing a nuclear-localized calcium indicator pan-neuronally (i.e., elavl3:H2B-GCaMP6s; Figures 3A and 3B ). We imaged the tectum, the pretectum, and surrounding areas with single-cell resolution (Figures 3B and 3C). Our visual stimulus protocols included the MAE protocol used for behavioral tests preceded by a series of motion phases that included monocular and binocular optic flow patterns to identify and characterize the DS population. We extracted the response of individual neurons using CaImAn (Giovannucci et al., 2019Giovannucci A. Friedrich J. Gunn P. Kalfon J. Brown B.L. Koay S.A. Taxidis J. Najafi F. Gauthier J.L. Zhou P. et al.CaImAn an open source tool for scalable calcium imaging data analysis.eLife. 2019; 8 (e38173)Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To identify prominent response types, we employed unsupervised hierarchical clustering based on vectors of coefficients that represent how a cell responded during real and illusory motion perception (Figures S3A and S3B). We empirically set a dendrogram threshold that divided motion-responsive neurons into 11 functional clusters, 5 of which represented DS neurons (Figures 3D and 3E). Conditioning motion-tuned (CMT) neurons, i.e., neurons with their preferred direction aligned with the conditioning motion, were divided into two subtypes: C5 and C6 (Figure 3G). C6 neurons adapted more rapidly than C5 neurons during the conditioning motion (time constant τC5 = 90 s, time constant τC6 = 39 s), and their activity dropped more significantly by the end of the conditioning phase (decreaseC5 = 54.0%, decreaseC6 = 87.9%). On the other hand, opposing motion-tuned (OMT) neurons, whose preferred direction is that of the expected illusory motion, were classified into three subtypes (C2, C3, and C4) that differ in their activity during the test phase (Figure 3E). Remarkably, despite the presence of the reversed OKR, 47.3% of the OMT neurons (C4) stayed inactive throughout the test phase. In contrast, C2 and C3 neurons were active in the test phase with different temporal dynamics. C2 neurons showed fast onset in the test phase (time constant τC2 = 5.4 s), whereas C3 showed slow onset (time constant τC3 = 17.2 s). Reassuringly, a shorter conditioning phase, insufficient to induce an MAE, did not induce the activity of C2 and C3 in the test phase either (Figure S4). In summary, by including the response to the MAE as an additional criterion, we further categorized the DS neural population into subtypes beyond their direction tuning. We further investigated these DS subtypes in terms of their selectivity for monocular and binocular optic flow directions (Figure 4A). Binocular flow patterns can be described as rotation (movement in opposite directions for the two eyes) or translation (movements in the same direction for both eyes). Interestingly, most MAE-correlated neurons (C2 and C3) responded monocularly to gratings presented to the contralateral eye (Figures 4B and S3C–S3F). Neurons tuned to temporal motion in the contralateral eye were more enriched in “fast” MAE neurons (C2), whereas neurons tuned to nasal motion in the contralateral eye were more enriched in “slow” MAE neurons (C3) (Figure 4B). On the other hand, neurons that showed rotation-selective responses, which involve binocular computation (Kubo et al., 2014Kubo F. Hablitzel B. Dal Maschio M. Driever W. Baier H. Arrenberg A.B. Functional architecture of an optic flow-responsive area that drives horizontal eye movements in zebrafish.Neuron. 2014; 81: 1344-1359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), were overrepresented in the non-MAE population (C4) (Figure 4C). To identify the neurotransmitter type of MAE-correlated DS neurons, we separately imaged responses of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons with the same MAE-inducing visual stimuli and targeted volume using the vglut2a:Gal4 and gad1b:Gal4 transgenic lines, respectively. To compare the neurotransmitter dataset with the pan-neuronal dataset, we trained a classifier using the pan-neuronal dataset to assign cluster identities to the DS neurons identified in the neurotransmitter dataset (STAR Methods; accuracy: 84.2% for the OMT neurons and 93.4% for the CMT neurons). We found that glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons showed responses classified as C2, C3, and C4. Compared with the pan-neuronal population, C2 neurons were more highly represented among GABAergic neurons, whereas C4 neurons were more frequently represented among glutamatergic neurons. These results suggest that, along with glutamatergic neurons, a large proportion of GABAergic neurons also showed MAE-correlated responses (Figures 4D and S3G–S3K). This implies a potentially substantial contribution of inhibitory neurons to the reversed OKR during the MAE. To identify the locations of MAE-correlated neurons, we registered the coordinates of each functionally identified neuron into a single standard brain (Figures S5A, S5B, and S6), which also holds previously annotated contours of various brain areas (Figure 5A; Kunst et al., 2019Kunst M. Laurell E. Mokayes N. Kramer A. Kubo F. Fernandes A.M. Förster D. Dal Maschio M. Baier H. A Cellular-Resolution Atlas of the Larval Zebrafish Brain.Neuron. 2019; 103: 21-38.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). MAE-correlated neurons were found mostly in visual areas (e.g., the tectum and pretectum) but also in motor/premotor areas (e.g., the cerebellum) (Figures 5B, S7A, and S7B). Notably, the pretectum contained the largest proportion of MAE-correlated neurons (Figure 5C). Interestingly, DS neurons of different functional subtypes appeared to concentrate in largely non-overlapping spatial clusters. MAE-correlated neurons (C2 and C3) formed mirror-symmetrical clusters in the ventral-lateral pretectum, coincident with the migrated pretectal region M1 (Mueller and Wullimann, 2002Mueller T. Wullimann M.F. BrdU-, neuroD (nrd)- and Hu-studies reveal unusual non-ventricular neurogenesis in the postembryonic zebrafish forebrain.Mech. Dev. 2002; 117: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar; Figures 5D and 5E, circled in cyan). Within this MAE cluster, C2 neurons were located more dorsally than C3 neurons (Figures 5G and 5H). Notably, C2 and C3 neurons were tuned to temporal and nasal motion, respectively, in the contralateral eye (Figures 5G and 5H). The position of these neurons was close to RGC arborization fields AF5 and AF6, which contain collateral branches of DS RGC axons from the contralateral eye (Kramer et al., 2019Kramer A. Wu Y.

A Cellular-Resolution Atlas of the Larval Zebrafish Brain.Neuron. 2019; 103: 21-38.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we found that neurons whose cell bodies are located in the MAE cluster projected locally or to the cerebellum, and all of them innervated regions in the vicinity of AF5 and AF6 (Figures S5C–S5E). On the other hand, non-MAE DS neurons (C4) also formed their own spatial cluster close to the midline (Figure 5F, circled in green). Based on their location, these neurons are coincident with the previously identified posterior-dorsal cluster (PDC) (Figure 5I; Kubo et al., 2014Kubo F. Hablitzel B. Dal Maschio M. Driever W.

Based on their colocalization with previously known genetic markers (Clemente et al., 2004Clemente D. Porteros A. Weruaga E. Alonso J.R. Arenzana F.J. Aijón J. Arévalo R.

Extraocular motoneuron pools develop along a dorsoventral axis in zebrafish, Danio rerio.J. Comp. Neurol. 2017; 525: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), these neurons are most likely situated in the oculomotor nuclei (OMN) (Figures S7F–S7H). Our behavioral and functional results suggest that MAE-correlated neurons in the pretectum might play an essential role in driving the OKR. To test this hypothesis, we unilaterally photoablated small groups of MAE-correlated neurons in the pretectal MAE cluster (typically 6–12 individual neurons; CCW-tuned cells in left hemisphere or CW-tuned cells in the right hemisphere; namely, neurons tuned to nasal motion in the contralateral eye; Figures 6A, 6B, and S8A). After overnight recovery, the fish were re-imaged to confirm ablation efficacy. Successfully ablated fish were then tested for their behavioral response to four monocular motion phases (i.e., Left Nasalward [LN], Left Temporalward [LT], Right Nasalward [RN], and Right Temporalward [RT]) (Figure 6C) because almost all DS neurons in this cluster are monocular and receive contralateral input (Figures 5G and 5H). Targeted ablation in the pretectal MAE cluster resulted in specific impairment of the OKR to nasal motion presented to the contralateral eye but not to nasal motion in the ipsilateral eye or temporal motion in the contra- and ipsilateral eyes (Figures 6D and 6E). There was no significant effect when a similar number of non-MAE DS pretectal neurons or neurons unresponsive to motion in the vicinity of the cluster were ablated (Figures 6F–6H and S8B–S8D). Together, these results show that the MAE-correlated neurons in the pretectal MAE cluster play an essential role in inducing the OKR. We next investigated if neurons in the pretectal MAE cluster were also sufficient to drive the OKR. To this end, the MAE cluster in the ventral lateral pretectum was optogenetically activated in the absence of visual motion. We used transgenic fish that expressed channelrhodopsin-2 in the pretectum and a 50-μm optic fiber that further restricted the volume of photostimulation (Figures 7A and 7B ). Experiments for each hemisphere consisted of six trials. In three randomly selected trials, the larvae were exposed to blue light stimulation between 60 s and 120 s. Strikingly, unilateral photostimulation of the pretectal MAE cluster induced the OKR (Figure 7C). Photostimulation in the left and the right hemisphere elicited the OKR in opposite directions (Figures 7C, S8E, and S8F). The optogenetically induced OKR was more prominent and robust in the eye contralateral to the illumination (Figures 7D and S8G). The same light intensity did not cause any detectable change in spontaneous eye movements in non-expressing clutchmates (Figures 7D and S8H). Therefore, we conclude that the pretectal MAE cluster is an essential node in the motion-processing stream that evokes OKR behavior. We show here that recording and manipulation of neuronal responses to an optical illusion in zebrafish provides an inroad into the neuronal mechanisms of"

Seven cohorts with two years of data, three to eight years prior to index date, and an incident cohort were created. Four trained models for each cohort, boosted trees, feed forward network, recurrent neural network and recurrent neural network with pre-trained weights, were constructed and their performance compared using validation and test data. The incident model had an AUC of 94.4% and F1 score of 54.1%. Eight years removed from index date the AUC and F1 scores were 80.7% and 25.6%, respectively. The results for the remaining cohorts were between these ranges. Deep learning models can result in significant improvement in performance but come at a cost in terms of run times and hardware requirements. The results of the model at index date indicate that this modeling can be effective at stratifying patients at risk of dementia. At this time, the inability to sustain this quality at longer lead times is more an issue of data availability and quality rather than one of algorithm choices."

In mammals, there are at least 150 GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs), which serve as receptors, adhesion molecules, enzymes, protease inhibitors, and so on (4Kinoshita T.

Taken together, these findings show that correct processing of GPI-anchors is crucial for the proper functions of these proteins in vivo. Protein N-glycosylation is another type of post-translational modification occurring in the ER (16Schwarz F. Aebi M. Mechanisms and principles of N-linked protein glycosylation.Curr. Opin. Struct.

An oligosaccharide consisting of Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 is transferred to the amino group of asparagine within the motif NX(S/T) (where X represents any amino acid except proline) of newly synthesized proteins. The folding states of secretory proteins are monitored by the ER quality control systems (18Sun Z. Brodsky J.L. Protein quality control in the secretory pathway.J. Cell Biol. 2019; 218 (31537714): 3171-318710.1083/jcb.201906047Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). N-Glycans are processed in the ER, which contributes to protein folding. First, two Glc residues on N-glycans are trimmed by α-glucosidase I and II. Processed monoglucosylated N-glycan structures are then recognized by calnexin and calreticulin, which are molecular chaperones that possess a lectin domain. Calnexin has a transmembrane domain, whereas calreticulin is a soluble protein (19Helenius A. Aebi M. Roles of N-linked glycans in the endoplasmic reticulum.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73 (15189166): 1019-104910.1146/annurev.biochem.73.011303.073752Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar), and both proteins associate with protein disulfide isomerases such as ERp57 and ERp29, prompting the folding of newly synthesized proteins (20Ellgaard L. Frickel E.M. Calnexin, calreticulin, and ERp57: teammates in glycoprotein folding.Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 39 (14716078): 223-24710.1385/CBB:39:3:223Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 21Kozlov G. Muñoz-Escobar J. Castro K. Gehring K.

Once the remaining Glc residues on protein N-glycans are trimmed by α-glucosidase II, calnexin/calreticulin dissociate from the proteins. However, proteins remaining in an unfolded state are reglucosylated by UDP-Glc:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase, subsequently be-coming bound again to calnexin and calreticulin for refolding. This series of reactions is called the calnexin/calreticulin cycle and is essential for glycoprotein folding. In our previous study, we performed a genetic screening to identify factors that affect GPI-inositol deacylation. In the screening, MOGS, GANAB, and CANX, as well as PGAP1, were identified as candidates (22Liu Y.-S. Guo X.-Y. Hirata T. Rong Y. Motooka D. Kitajima T. Murakami Y. Gao X.-D. Nakamura S. Kinoshita T. Fujita M. N-Glycan–dependent protein folding and endoplasmic reticulum retention regulate GPI-anchor processing.J. Cell Biol. 2018; 217 (29255114): 585-59910.1083/jcb.201706135Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). MOGS, GANAB, and CANX encode α-glucosidase I and II and calnexin, respectively (23Tannous A. Pisoni G.B. Hebert D.N. Molinari M. N-Linked sugar-regulated protein folding and quality control in the ER.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2015; 41 (25534658): 79-8910.1016/j.semcdb.2014.12.001Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). These results suggested that N-glycan–dependent ER quality control systems participate in the lipid remodeling of GPI-APs, whereas it was unclear how calnexin contributes to the processing. When proteins fail to fold correctly, they are recognized as misfolded proteins, the majority of which are retained in the ER and degraded through the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway (24Vembar S.S. Brodsky J.L. One step at a time: endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9 (19002207): 944-95710.1038/nrm2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). However, misfolded GPI-APs do not appear to be suitable substrates for ERAD, possibly because of the presence of GPI-anchors. A fraction of misfolded GPI-APs are degraded through proteasomes (25Fujita M. Yoko-O T. Jigami Y. Inositol deacylation by Bst1p is required for the quality control of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins.Mol. Biol.

In mammalian cells, although misfolded GPI-APs are retained in the ER, they are rapidly released into the secretory pathway upon acute ER stress despite their misfolding (29Satpute-Krishnan P. Ajinkya M. Bhat S. Itakura E. Hegde R.S. Lippincott-Schwartz J. ER stress-induced clearance of misfolded GPI-anchored proteins via the secretory pathway.Cell. 2014; 158 (25083867): 522-53310.1016/j.cell.2014.06.026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Time-lapse imaging of live cells under acute ER stress conditions showed that misfolded prion proteins are transported from the ER to the Golgi and plasma membrane and subsequently to lysosomes for degradation. In the present study, we investigated the roles of calnexin in the quality control and lipid remodeling of GPI-APs in the ER. In WT cells, GPI-APs were folded and inositol-deacylated in the ER and expressed at the cell surface. In calnexin and calreticulin double-knockout (CANX&CALR-DKO) cells, protein folding and GPI-inositol deacylation efficiencies were significantly decreased such that misfolded and inositol-acylated GPI-APs were exposed on the plasma membrane. Thus, these results indicate that the N-glycan–dependent calnexin/calreticulin cycle is responsible for the correct folding of GPI-APs and provides sufficient ER retention time for efficient GPI-inositol deacylation. After GPI attachment to proteins, an acyl-chain linked to inositol on many GPI-APs is removed by the GPI-inositol deacylase PGAP1. The inositol deacylation status of GPI-APs can be determined by assessing their sensitivity to bacterial PI-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) (30Kmenon A. Structural analysis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors.Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230 (8139510): 418-44210.1016/0076-6879(94)30027-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 31Ferguson M.A.J.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2009: 137-150Google Scholar). PI-PLC reacts with the hydroxyl group on the 2-position of the inositol ring, producing inositol 1,2-cyclic phosphate (32Heinz D. Ryan M. Bullock T. Griffith O. Crystal structure of the phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C from Bacillus cereus in complex with myo-inositol.EMBO J. 1995; 14 (7664726): 3855-386310.1002/j.1460-2075.1995.tb00057.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). If an acyl-chain is attached to the 2-position of the inositol, PI-PLC cannot cleave the substrate (Fig. 1A). We previously demonstrated that GPI-inositol deacylation of CD59 and CD55 is partially impaired in cells defective for calnexin (CANX) and is more strongly affected in cells defective for both CANX and calreticulin (CALR) (22Liu Y.-S. Guo X.-Y. Hirata T. Rong Y. Motooka D. Kitajima T. Murakami Y. Gao X.-D. Nakamura S. Kinoshita T. Fujita M. N-Glycan–dependent protein folding and endoplasmic reticulum retention regulate GPI-anchor processing.J. Cell Biol. 2018; 217 (29255114): 585-59910.1083/jcb.201706135Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To determine whether the CANX/CALR dependence of GPI-inositol diacylation is a general phenomenon of various GPI-APs, we treated CANX&CALR-DKO HEK293 cells with PI-PLC, and endogenous CD59, CD55, and CD109 in the CANX&CALR-DKO cells showed PI-PLC resistance (Fig. 1, B and C). To confirm whether the PI-PLC resistance of GPI-APs is a general phenomenon, exogenous human GPI-APs CD48, CD14, ART3, ART4, LY6E, LY6G6C, and CD52 (Table S1) were transiently expressed and assessed by PI-PLC treatment. Consistent with the endogenous GPI-APs, the exogenous GPI-APs also showed PI-PLC resistance in CANX&CALR-DKO cells (Fig. 1D and Fig. S1). These results suggest that disruption of the calnexin/calreticulin cycle causes inefficient GPI-inositol deacylation in GPI-APs. Approximately 95% of GPI-APs in mammalian cells contain at least one N-glycan (22Liu Y.-S. Guo X.-Y. Hirata T. Rong Y. Motooka D. Kitajima T. Murakami Y. Gao X.-D. Nakamura S. Kinoshita T. Fujita M. N-Glycan–dependent protein folding and endoplasmic reticulum retention regulate GPI-anchor processing.J. Cell Biol. 2018; 217 (29255114): 585-59910.1083/jcb.201706135Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To determine whether calnexin/calreticulin also affects the inositol deacylation of non-N-glycosylated GPI-APs, we analyzed LY6D and GFP-GPI, which have no N-glycan, by PI-PLC treatment in WT and CANX&CALR-DKO cells. In WT cells, both LY6D and GFP-GPI were sensitive to PI-PLC cleavage (Fig. 2A, left top), whereas in CANX&CALR-DKO cells, unlike N-glycosylated GPI-APs, LY6D and GFP-GPI did not show PI-PLC resistance (Fig. 2A, left bottom and right). We next constructed HA-tagged CD59 with (WT) or without N-glycan (N43Q) to compare the PI-PLC sensitivity between WT and CANX&CALR-DKO cells. HA-CD59 WT showed PI-PLC resistance in CANX&CALR-DKO cells, compared with that observed in WT cells (Fig. 2B, left). The PI-PLC sensitivity of HA-CD59 (N43Q) was comparable between the WT and CANX&CALR-DKO cells (Fig. 2B, right). The observed difference between N-glycosylated and non-N-glycosylated GPI-APs suggests that GPI-inositol deacylation regulation by calnexin/calreticulin depends on the N-glycans on GPI-APs. The structure of the ER-luminal portion of calnexin has two domains: a glycan-binding domain, consisting of a globular β-sandwich structure, and an extended arm domain (P-domain), consisting of two β-strands (33Schrag J.D.

To assess whether this activity affects GPI-inositol deacylation, we constructed calnexin constructs with mutations in the amino acids responsible for glycan binding (Y164A, K166A, M188A, and E216A) (Table S1). Compared with a WT calnexin construct, the PI-PLC sensitivity of CD59 in CANX&CALR-DKO cells transfected with glycan binding–deficient calnexin constructs was rarely rescued, which was consistent with previous results (Y164A and E216A) (22Liu Y.-S.

The results indicated that lectin activity of calnexin is necessary for efficient GPI-inositol deacylation.

Furthermore, tryptophan at position 342 (Trp-342), aspartic acid residues at positions 343 (Asp-343) and 347 (Asp-347), and glutamic acid at position 351 (Glu-351) of calnexin are thought to be important for this association (21Kozlov G.

To assess the importance of these residues in the association of calnexin with ERp57 and ERp29, single (D343A and E351A) or double mutant calnexin constructs (W342A/D343A, D343A/E351A, and D347A/E351A) were constructed to disrupt the interaction (Table S1). Expression of some constructs, such as D343A, W342A/D343A, and D347A/E351A, was unstable. Nonetheless, the constructs could partially rescue the PI-PLC sensitivity of CD59 (Fig. 3, B and C). These results suggest that the ability of ERp57 binding in calnexin is dispensable for GPI-inositol deacylation. To assess this possibility, PDIA3, which encodes ERp57, was knocked out in HEK293 cells, and the PI-PLC sensitivity of GPI-APs was analyzed. Interestingly, the PI-PLC sensitivity of both CD59 and CD55 was increased in PDIA3-knockout (KO) cells compared with that observed in the parental WT cells (Fig. 3, D and E), suggesting that GPI-inositol deacylation occurred more efficiently in the absence of ERp57. Calnexin was observed to associate with CD59 in an N-glycan– and GPI–dependent manner (Fig. S2C), as observed previously (22Liu Y.-S. Guo X.-Y. Hirata T. Rong Y. Motooka D. Kitajima T. Murakami Y.

ERp57 weakly co-precipitated with CD59 and misfolded CD59, whereas interactions with other ER chaperones, such as calreticulin and BiP, were not detected with any CD59 construct (Fig. S2C), indicating that the N-glycan and membrane-associated domain of GPI-APs are important for calnexin interaction. To assess whether ERp57 is required for calnexin to bind CD59, we expressed misfolded CD59 (C94S) and misfolded and soluble CD59 (C94S G103stop) in WT and PDIA3-KO cells and analyzed their ability to bind calnexin (22Liu Y.-S.

Calnexin was co-precipitated with misfolded CD59 (C94S) but not misfolded and soluble CD59 (C94S G103stop). Furthermore, knockout of PDIA3 did not affect the interaction between misfolded CD59 (C94S) and calnexin (Fig. 3F), suggesting that calnexin binds with misfolded GPI-APs in an ERp57-independent manner. Under steady-state conditions, the majority of misfolded prion proteins localize in the ER (29Satpute-Krishnan P. Ajinkya M. Bhat S. Itakura E. Hegde R.S. Lippincott-Schwartz J. ER stress-induced clearance of misfolded GPI-anchored proteins via the secretory pathway.Cell. 2014; 158 (25083867): 522-53310.1016/j.cell.2014.06.026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Because it appears that calnexin retains misfolded GPI-APs in the ER until their correct folding, we investigated the role of calnexin in the ER retention of GPI-APs by analyzing the localization of misfolded GPI-APs in the absence of the calnexin/calreticulin cycle. In HEK293 cells, EGFP-FLAG–tagged CD59 (C94S) was primarily localized in the ER (Fig. 4A, top). In CANX-KO and CALR-KO cells, CD59 (C94S) was retained in the ER, similar to WT cells. In contrast, in CANX&CALR-DKO cells, CD59 (C94S) was not retained in the ER but rather localized at the plasma membrane (Fig. 4A, bottom). Quantification of CD59 (C94S) co-localization with the ER marker was performed using multiple images (n = 28 for WT cells; n = 25 for CANX&CALR-KO cells) (Fig. 4D). The Pearson's correlation coefficient for EGFP-FLAG-CD59 (C94S) versus mRFP-KDEL changed from 0.715 ± 0.05 (mean ± S.D.) in WT cells to 0.176 ± 0.04 in CANX&CALR-KO cells. Furthermore, another misfolded GPI-AP, EGFP-FLAG-CD55 (C81A), was also expressed on the surface of CANX&CALR-DKO cells (Fig. S3A). Because calnexin/calreticulin recognizes monoglucosylated N-glycan structures, we next analyzed the localization of misfolded CD59 in cells defective in glucose trimming. In MOGS-KO or GANAB-KO cells, the majority of N-glycan structures on proteins in the ER are retained as Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 and Glc2Man9GlcNAc2, which are not recognized by calnexin. In MOGS-KO and GANAB-KO cells, fractions of CD59 (C94S) were expressed on the cell surface (Fig. 4B), indicating that misfolded GPI-APs lose their ability to interact with calnexin, causing their expression on the cell surface. The Pearson's correlation coefficient analysis showed localization of EGFP-FLAG-CD59 (C94S) was changed from the ER in MOGS-KO and GANAB-KO cells. These results indicate that the calnexin/calreticulin cycle mediates the ER retention of misfolded GPI-APs. To verify whether N-glycan structures on GPI-APs are required for their ER retention, the localization of non-N-glycosylated misfo"
https://openalex.org/W3088371550,"Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) has been shown to play a critical role in orchestrating immune responses to various pathogens through sensing cyclic dinucleotides. However, how STING regulates intestinal homeostasis is still not completely understood. In this study, we found that STING-/- mice were more susceptible to enteric infection with Citrobacter rodentium compared to wild-type (WT) mice evidenced by more severe intestinal inflammation and impaired bacterial clearance. STING-/- mice demonstrated lower expression of REG3γ but not β-defensins and Cramp in IECs. Consistently, STING-/- IECs showed reduced capacity to inhibit bacterial growth. STING agonists, both 10-carboxymethyl-9-acridanone (CMA) and 5,6-dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (DMXAA), promoted REG3γ expression IECs. Furthermore, STING agonists promoted WT but not REG3γ-deficient IEC bacterial killing. Mechanistically, STING agonists activated STAT3 and promoted glycolysis in IECs. Inhibition of STAT3 pathway and glycolysis suppressed STING-induced REG3γ production in IECs, and abrogated STING-mediated IEC killing of C. rodentium. Additionally, treatment with the STING ligand, 2,3-cGAMP, inhibited C. rodentium-induced colitis in vivo. Overall, STING promotes IEC REG3γ expression to inhibit enteric infection and intestinal inflammation, thus, maintaining the intestinal homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W3089192137,"During alcohol consumption, the esophageal mucosa is directly exposed to high concentrations of ethanol (EtOH). We therefore investigated the response of normal human esophageal epithelial cell lines EPC1, EPC2 and EPC3 to acute EtOH exposure. While these cells were able to tolerate 2% EtOH for 8 h in both three-dimensional organoids and monolayer culture conditions, RNA sequencing suggested that EtOH induced mitochondrial dysfunction. With EtOH treatment, EPC1 and EPC2 cells also demonstrated decreased mitochondrial ATPB protein expression by immunofluorescence and swollen mitochondria lacking intact cristae by transmission electron microscopy. Mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) was decreased in a subset of EPC1 and EPC2 cells stained with ΔΨm–sensitive dye MitoTracker Deep Red. In EPC2, EtOH decreased ATP level while impairing mitochondrial respiration and electron transportation chain functions, as determined by ATP fluorometric assay, respirometry, and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Additionally, EPC2 cells demonstrated enhanced oxidative stress by flow cytometry for mitochondrial superoxide (MitoSOX), which was antagonized by the mitochondria-specific antioxidant MitoCP. Concurrently, EPC1 and EPC2 cells underwent autophagy following EtOH exposure, as evidenced by flow cytometry for Cyto-ID, which detects autophagic vesicles, and immunoblots demonstrating induction of the lipidated and cleaved form of LC3B and downregulation of SQSTM1/p62. In EPC1 and EPC2, pharmacological inhibition of autophagy flux by chloroquine increased mitochondrial oxidative stress while decreasing cell viability. In EPC2, autophagy induction was coupled with phosphorylation of AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK), a cellular energy sensor responding to low ATP levels, and dephosphorylation of downstream substrates of mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex (mTORC)-1 signaling. Pharmacological AMPK activation by AICAR decreased EtOH-induced reduction of ΔΨm and ATP in EPC2. Taken together, acute EtOH exposure leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in esophageal keratinocytes, where the AMPK-mTORC1 axis may serve as a regulatory mechanism to activate autophagy to provide cytoprotection against EtOH-induced cell injury."

The questionnaire included 56 questions on several domains: global feelings, treatment burden, rapport with medical staff, psychosocial impact, sexual life and professional consequences.Respondents had experienced an average of 3.6 (95% CI: 3.3-3.9) MAR cycles: 5% (n = 46) were pregnant, 4% (n = 47) were waiting to start MAR, 50% (n = 522) succeeded in having a live birth following MAR, 19% (n = 199) were currently undergoing ART, and 21% (n = 221) dropped out of the MAR process without a live birth. Satisfaction rates regarding the received medical care were above 80%, but 42% of patients pointed out the lack of information about non-medical support. An important impact on sexual life was reported, with 21% of patients admitted having not had intercourse for several weeks or even several months. Concerning the impact on professional life, 63% of active workers currently in an MAR program (n = 185) considered that MAR had strong repercussions on the organization of their working life with 49% of them reporting a negative impact on the quality of their work, and 46% of them reporting the necessity to lie about missing work during their treatment.Despite a high overall level of satisfaction regarding medical care, the burden of infertility and MAR on quality of life is strong, especially on sexuality and professional organization. Clinical staff should be encouraged to develop non-medical support for all patients at any stage of infertility treatment. Enterprises should be warned about the professional impact of infertility and MAR to help their employees reconcile personal and professional life."
https://openalex.org/W3088318008,"Mucoadhesive polymeric nanocapsules have attracted interest of researchers from different fields from natural sciences because of their ability to interact with the mucosa and increase drug permeation. Anesthesia by immersion causes absorption through the skin and gills of fish, so it is important to evaluate the exposure of these organs to drug nanosystems. Benzocaine (BENZ) is one of the most popular anesthetic agents used in fish anesthesia, but it has drawbacks because of its low bioavailability, resulting in weak absorption after immersion. Here we describe method developed for preparing and characterizing chitosan-coated PLGA mucoadhesive nanoparticles containing BENZ (NPMAs) for zebrafish immersion anesthesia. We determined the lowest effective concentration, characterized the interaction of the mucoadhesive system with fish, measured the anesthetic efficacy, and evaluated possible toxic effects in embryos and adults exposed to the nanoformulations. This study opens perspectives for using nanoformulations prepared with BENZ in aquaculture, allowing reduction of dosage as well as promoting more effective anesthesia and improved interaction with the mucoadhesive system of fish."
https://openalex.org/W3088563315,"Upon internalization, receptors are trafficked to sorting endosomes (SE) where they undergo sorting and are then packaged into budding vesicles that undergo fission and transport within the cell. Eps15 Homology Domain Protein 1 (EHD1), the best-characterized member of the Eps15 Homology Domain Protein (EHD) family, has been implicated in catalyzing the fission process that releases endosome-derived vesicles for recycling to the plasma membrane. Indeed, recent studies suggest that upon receptor-mediated internalization, EHD1 is recruited from the cytoplasm to endosomal membranes where it catalyzes vesicular fission. However, the mechanism by which this recruitment occurs remains unknown. Herein, we demonstrate that the EHD1 paralog, EHD4, is required for the recruitment of EHD1 to SE. We show that EHD4 preferentially dimerizes with EHD1, and knock-down of EHD4 expression by siRNA, shRNA or by CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing leads to impaired EHD1 SE-recruitment and enlarged SE. Moreover, we demonstrate that at least 3 different asparagine-proline-phenylalanine (NPF) motif-containing EHD binding partners, Rabenosyn-5, Syndapin2 and MICAL-L1, are required for the recruitment of EHD1 to SE. Indeed, knock-down of any of these SE-localized EHD interaction partners leads to enlarged SE, presumably due to impaired endosomal fission. Overall, we identify a novel mechanistic role for EHD4 in recruitment of EHD1 to SE, thus positioning EHD4 as an essential component of the EHD1-fission machinery at SE."
https://openalex.org/W3088826289,"Polynucleotide kinase phosphatase (PNKP) is a DNA repair factor with dual enzymatic functions, i.e., phosphorylation of 5’-end and dephosphorylation of 3’-end, which are prerequisites for DNA ligation and, thus, is involved in multiple DNA repair pathways, i.e., base excision repair, single-strand break repair and double-strand break repair through non-homologous end joining. Mutations in PNKP gene causes inherited diseases, such as microcephaly and seizure (MCSZ) by neural developmental failure and ataxia with oculomotor apraxia 4 (AOA4) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease 2B2 (CMT2B2) by neurodegeneration. PNKP consists of the Forkhead-associated (FHA) domain, linker region, phosphatase domain and kinase domain. Although the functional importance of PNKP interaction with XRCC1 and XRCC4 through the FHA domain and that of phosphatase and kinase enzyme activities have been well established, little is known about the function of linker region. In this study, we identified a functional putative nuclear localization signal (NLS) of PNKP located in the linker region, and showed that lysine 138 (K138), arginine 139 (R139) and arginine 141 (R141) residues therein are critically important for nuclear localization. Furthermore, double mutant of K138A and R35A, the latter of which mutates arginine 35, central amino acid of FHA domain, showed additive effect on nuclear localization, indicating that the FHA domain as well as the NLS is important for PNKP nuclear localization. Thus, this study revealed two distinct mechanisms regulating nuclear localization and subnuclear distribution of PNKP. These findings would contribute to deeper understanding of a variety of DNA repair pathway, i.e., base excision repair, single-strand break repair and double-strand break repair."
https://openalex.org/W3089335863,"Gillnets made of the biodegradable resin polybutylene succinate co-adipate-co-terephthalate were tested under commercial fishing conditions to compare their fishing performance with that of conventional nylon polyamide (PA) gillnets. Both types of gillnets were made of 0.55 mm Ø monofilaments. However, since the biodegradable nets are weaker than nylon PA nets when using the same monofilament diameter, we also used biodegradable nets made of 0.60 mm Ø monofilament that had a similar tensile strength to the 0.55 mm Ø nylon PA nets. The relative catch efficiency of the different gillnet types was evaluated over the 2018 autumn fishing season for saithe and cod in northern Norway. For cod, both biodegradable gillnets (0.55 and 0.60 mm) had a significantly lower catch efficiency compared to the traditional nylon PA net (0.55 mm) with estimated catch efficiencies of 62.38% (CI: 50.55–74.04) and 54.96% (CI: 35.42–73.52) compared with the nylon PA net, respectively. Similarly for saithe, both biodegradable gillnets (0.55 and 0.60 mm) had a lower estimated catch efficiency compared to the traditional nylon PA net (0.55 mm) with estimated catch efficiencies of 83.40% (71.34–94.86) and 83.87% (66.36–104.92), compared with the nylon PA net, respectively. Tensile strength does not explain the differences in catch efficiency between the two gillnet types, since increasing the twine diameter of the biodegradable gillnets (to match the strength of nylon PA gillnets) did not yield similar catch efficiencies. However, the elasticity and stiffness of the materials may be responsible for the differences in catch efficiency between the nylon PA and biodegradable gillnets."
https://openalex.org/W3088728390,"Prolonged exercise is known to cause changes in common biomarkers. Occasionally, competition athletes need medical assistance and hospitalisation during prolonged exercise events. To aid clinicians treating patients and medical teams in such events we have studied common biomarkers after at The Norseman Xtreme Triathlon (Norseman), an Ironman distance triathlon with an accumulated climb of 5200 m, and an Olympic triathlon for comparison. Blood samples were collected before, immediately after, and the day following the Norseman Xtreme Triatlon (n = 98) and Oslo Olympic Triathlon (n = 15). Increased levels of clinical significance were seen at the finish line of the Norseman in white blood cells count (WBC) (14.2 [13.5–14.9] 109/L, p < 0.001), creatinine kinase (CK) (2450 [1620–3950] U/L, p < 0.001) and NT-proBNP (576 [331–856] ng/L, p < 0.001). The following day there were clinically significant changes in CRP (39 [27–56] mg/L, p < 0.001) and Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) (142 [99–191] U/L, p < 0.001). In comparison, after the Olympic triathlon distance, there were statistically significant, but less clinically important, changes in WBC (7.8 [6.7–9.6] 109/L, p < 0.001), CK (303 [182–393] U/L, p < 0.001) and NT-proBNP (77 [49–88] ng/L, p < 0.01) immediately after the race, and in CRP (2 [1–3] mg/L, p < 0.001) and AST (31 [26–41] U/L, p < 0.01) the following day. Subclinical changes were also observed in Hemoglobin, Thrombocytes, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Creatinine, Alanine Aminotransferase and Thyroxine after the Norseman. In conclusion, there were significant changes in biomarkers used in a clinical setting after the Norseman. Of largest clinical importance were clinically significant increased WBC, CRP, AST, CK and NT-proBNP after the Norseman. This is important to be aware of when athletes engaging in prolonged exercise events receive medical assistance or are hospitalised."
https://openalex.org/W3088143874,"Diverse psychological mechanisms have been associated with modulations of different EEG frequencies. To the extent of our knowledge, there are few studies of the test-retest reliability of these modulations in the human brain. To assess evoked and induced alpha reliabilities related to cognitive processing, EEG data from twenty subjects were recorded in 58 derivations in two different sessions separated by 49.5 ± 48.9 (mean ± standard deviation) days. A visual oddball was selected as the cognitive task, and three main parameters were analyzed for evoked and induced alpha modulations (latency, amplitude and topography). Latency and amplitude for evoked and induced modulations showed stable behavior between the two sessions. The correlation between sessions for alpha evoked and induced topographies in the grand average (group level) was r = 0.923, p<0.001; r = 0.962, p<0.001, respectively. The within-subject correlation values for evoked modulation ranged from 0.472 to 0.974 (mean: 0.766), whereas induced activity showed a different range, 0.193 to 0.892 (mean: 0.655). Individual analysis of the test-retest reliability showed a higher heterogeneity in the induced modulation, probably due to the heterogeneous phases found in the second case. However, despite this heterogeneity in phase values for induced activity relative to the onset of the stimuli, an excellent correlation score was obtained for group topography, with values that were better than those of the grand average evoked topography. As a main conclusion, induced alpha activity can be observed as a stable and reproducible response in the cognitive processing of the human brain."
https://openalex.org/W3088914316,"Niemann-Pick type C disease is a lysosomal storage disease affecting primarily the nervous system that results in premature death. Here we present the first report and investigation of Niemann-Pick type C disease in Australian Angus/Angus-cross calves. After a preliminary diagnosis of Niemann-Pick type C, samples from two affected calves and two obligate carriers were analysed using single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping and homozygosity mapping, and NPC1 was considered as a positional candidate gene. A likely causal missense variant on chromosome 24 in the NPC1 gene (NM_174758.2:c.2969C>G) was identified by Sanger sequencing of cDNA. SIFT analysis, protein alignment and protein modelling predicted the variant to be deleterious to protein function. Segregation of the variant with disease was confirmed in two additional affected calves and two obligate carrier dams. Genotyping of 403 animals from the original herd identified an estimated allele frequency of 3.5%. The Niemann-Pick type C phenotype was additionally confirmed via biochemical analysis of Lysotracker Green, cholesterol, sphingosine and glycosphingolipids in fibroblast cell cultures originating from two affected calves. The identification of a novel missense variant for Niemann-Pick type C disease in Angus/Angus-cross cattle will enable improved breeding and management of this disease in at-risk populations. The results from this study offer a unique opportunity to further the knowledge of human Niemann-Pick type C disease through the potential availability of a bovine model of disease."
https://openalex.org/W3089223570,"Purpose To assess the axial, radial and tangential limbus position misrepresentation when parametric models are used to represent the cornea and the sclera. Methods This retrospective study included 135 subjects aged 22 to 65 years (36.5 mean ±9.8 STD), 71 females and 64 males. Topography measurements were taken using an Eye Surface Profiler topographer and processed by a custom-built MATLAB code. Eye surfaces were freed from edge-effect artefacts and fitted to spherical, conic and biconic models. Results When comparing the radial position of the limbus, average errors of -0.83±0.19mm, -0.76±0.20mm and -0.69±0.20mm were observed within the right eye population for the spherical, conic and biconic models fitted up to 5mm. For the same fitting radius, the average fitting errors were -0.86±0.23mm, -0.78±0.23mm and -0.73±0.23mm for the spherical, conic and biconic models respectively within the left eye population. For the whole cornea fit, the average errors were -0.27±0.12mm and -0.28±0.13mm for the spherical models, -0.02±0.29mm and -0.05±0.27mm for the conic models, and -0.22±0.16mm and 0.24±0.17mm for the biconic models in the right and left eye populations respectively. Conclusions Through the use of spherical, conic and biconic parametric modelling methods, the eye’s limbus is being mislocated. Additionally, it is evident that the magnitude of fitting error associated with the sclera may be propagating through the other components of the eye. This suggests that a corneal nonparametric model may be necessary to improve the representation of the limbus."
https://openalex.org/W3087866010,"Background Humans routinely attempt to manage pest rodent populations with anticoagulant rodenticides (ARs). We require information on resistance to ARs within rodent populations to have effective eradication programs that minimise exposure in non-target species. Mutations to the VKORC1 gene have been shown to confer resistance in rodents with high proportions of resistance in mice found in all European populations tested. We screened mutations in Mus musculus within Western Australia, by sampling populations from the capital city (Perth) and a remote island (Browse Island). These are the first Australian mouse populations screened for resistance using this method. Additionally, the mitochondrial D-loop of house mice was sequenced to explore population genetic structure, identify the origin of Western Australian mice, and to elucidate whether resistance was linked to certain haplotypes. Results No resistance-related VKORC1 mutations were detected in either house mouse population. A genetic introgression in the intronic sequence of the VKORC1 gene of Browse Island house mouse was detected which is thought to have originated through hybridisation with the Algerian mouse (Mus spretus). Analysis of the mitochondrial D-loop reported two haplotypes in the house mouse population of Perth, and two haplotypes in the population of Browse Island. Conclusions Both house mouse populations exhibited no genetic resistance to ARs, in spite of free use of ARs in Western Australia. Therefore weaker anticoagulant rodenticides can be employed in pest control and eradication attempts, which will result in reduced negative impacts on non-target species. Biosecurity measures must be in place to avoid introduction of resistant house mice, and new house mouse subspecies to Western Australia."
https://openalex.org/W3088167813,"Titanium is essentially absent from biological systems yet reliably integrates into bone. To achieve osseointegration, titanium must activate biological processes without entering cells, defining it as a bio-activating material. Nanostructuring bulk titanium reduces grain size, increases strength, and improves other quantifiable physical properties, including cytocompatibility. The biological processes activated by increasing grain boundary availability were detected with total RNA-sequencing in mouse pre-osteoblasts grown for 72 hours on nanometrically smooth substrates of either coarse grain or nanostructured ultrafine grain titanium. The average grain boundary length under cells on the conventional coarse grain substrates is 273.0 μm, compared to 70,881.5 μm for cells adhered to the nanostructured ultrafine grain substrates; a 260-fold difference. Cells on both substrates exhibit similar expression profiles for genes whose products are critical for mechanosensation and transduction of cues that trigger osteoconduction. Biological process Gene Ontology term enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes reveals that cell cycle, chromatin modification, telomere maintenance, and RNA metabolism processes are upregulated on ultrafine grain titanium. Processes related to immune response, including apoptosis, are downregulated. Tumor-suppressor genes are upregulated while tumor-promoting genes are downregulated. Upregulation of genes involved in chromatin remodeling and downregulation of genes under the control of the peripheral circadian clock implicate both processes in the transduction of mechanosensory information. Non-coding RNAs may also play a role in the response. Merging transcriptomics with well-established mechanobiology principles generates a unified model to explain the bio-activating properties of titanium. The modulation of processes is accomplished through chromatin remodeling in which the nucleus responds like a rheostat to grain boundary concentration. This convergence of biological and materials science reveals a pathway toward understanding the biotic-abiotic interface and will inform the development of effective bio-activating and bio-inactivating materials."
https://openalex.org/W3088573609,"Statistically robust monitoring of threatened populations is essential for effective conservation management because the population trend data that monitoring generates is often used to make decisions about when and how to take action. Despite representing the highest proportion of threatened animals globally, the development of best practice methods for monitoring populations of threatened insects is relatively uncommon. Traditionally, population trend data for the Nationally Endangered New Zealand grasshopper Brachaspis robustus has been determined by counting all adults and nymphs seen on a single ~1.5 km transect searched once annually. This method lacks spatial and temporal replication, both of which are essential to overcome detection errors in highly cryptic species like B. robustus. It also provides no information about changes in the grasshopper’s distribution throughout its range. Here, we design and test new population density and site occupancy monitoring protocols by comparing a) comprehensive plot and transect searches at one site and b) transect searches at two sites representing two different habitats (gravel road and natural riverbed) occupied by the species across its remaining range. Using power analyses, we determined a) the number of transects, b) the number of repeated visits and c) the grasshopper demographic to count to accurately detect long term change in relative population density. To inform a monitoring protocol design to track trends in grasshopper distribution, we estimated the probability of detecting an individual with respect to a) search area, b) weather and c) the grasshopper demographic counted at each of the two sites. Density estimates from plots and transects did not differ significantly. Population density monitoring was found to be most informative when large adult females present in early summer were used to index population size. To detect a significant change in relative density with power > 0.8 at the gravel road habitat, at least seventeen spatial replicates (transects) and four temporal replicates (visits) were required. Density estimates at the natural braided river site performed poorly and likely require a much higher survey effort. Detection of grasshopper presence was highest (pg > 0.6) using a 100 m x 1 m transect at both sites in February under optimal (no cloud) conditions. At least three visits to a transect should be conducted per season for distribution monitoring. Monitoring protocols that inform the management of threatened species are crucial for better understanding and mitigation of the current global trends of insect decline. This study provides an exemplar of how appropriate monitoring protocols can be developed for threatened insect species."

However, this hierarchical framework must consider unnecessary attributes and the interrelationships between the aspects and the criteria. Hence, fuzzy set theory is used for screening out the unnecessary attributes, a decision-making and trial evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) is proposed to manage the complex interrelationships among the aspects and attributes, and interpretive structural modeling (ISM) is used to divide the hierarchy and finally construct a hierarchical framework. The results reveal that (1) value proposition and community building in value production are fundamental links; (2) information technology and information management in value production are technical supports; (3) customer development in value marketing is the power source; and (4) value acquisition is the last link, which is established on the basis of and influenced by value marketing and value network.

This study also proposes engagement of stakeholders for promoting value creation and establishing a sound business model from multiple levels and links."
https://openalex.org/W3088850003,"Mitochondrial DNA variants associated with diseases are widely studied in contemporary populations, but their prevalence has not yet been investigated in ancient populations. The publicly available AmtDB database contains 1443 ancient mtDNA Eurasian genomes from different periods. The objective of this study was to use this data to establish the presence of pathogenic mtDNA variants putatively associated with mitochondrial diseases in ancient populations. The clinical significance, pathogenicity prediction and contemporary frequency of mtDNA variants were determined using online platforms. The analyzed ancient mtDNAs contain six variants designated as being ""confirmed pathogenic"" in modern patients. The oldest of these, m.7510T>C in the MT-TS1 gene, was found in a sample from the Neolithic period, dated 5800-5400 BCE. All six have well established clinical association, and their pathogenic effect is corroborated by very low population frequencies in contemporary populations. Analysis of the geographic location of the ancient samples, contemporary epidemiological trends and probable haplogroup association indicate diverse spatiotemporal dynamics of these variants. The dynamics in the prevalence and distribution is conceivably result of de novo mutations or human migrations and subsequent evolutionary processes. In addition, ten variants designated as possibly or likely pathogenic were found, but the clinical effect of these is not yet well established and further research is warranted. All detected mutations putatively associated with mitochondrial disease in ancient mtDNA samples are in tRNA coding genes. Most of these mutations are in a mt-tRNA type (Model 2) that is characterized by loss of D-loop/T-loop interaction. Exposing pathogenic variants in ancient human populations expands our understanding of their origin and prevalence dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W3088700617,"The association between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and occupational exposures are less studied in Bangladeshi context, despite the fact that occupational exposures are serious public health concerns in Bangladesh. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate this association considering demographic, health and smoking characteristics of Bangladeshi population. This was a hospital-based quantitative study including 373 participants who were assessed for COPD through spirometry testing. Assessment of occupational exposures was based on both self-reporting by respondents and ALOHA based job exposure matrix (JEM). Here, among the self-reported exposed group (n = 189), 104 participants (55%) were found with COPD compared to 23 participants (12.5%) in unexposed group (n = 184) that differed significantly (p = 0.00). Similarly, among the JEM measured low (n = 103) and high exposed group (n = 236), 23.3% and 41.5% of the participants were found with COPD respectively; compared to unexposed group (14.7%; n = 34), that differed significantly also (p = 0.00). Likewise, participants with longer self-reported occupational exposures (>8 years) showed significantly (p = 0.00) higher proportions of COPD (79.5%) compared to 40.4% in shorter exposure group (1-8 years). Similarly, significant (p = 0.00) higher cases of COPD were observed among the longer cumulative exposure years (>9 years) group than the shorter cumulative exposure years (1-9 years) group in JEM. While combining smoking and occupational exposure, the chance of developing COPD among the current, former and non-smokers of exposed group were 7.4, 7.2 and 12.7 times higher respectively than unexposed group. Furthermore, logistic analysis revealed that after adjustments for confounding risk factors, the chance of developing COPD among the self-reported exposure group was 6.3 times higher (ORs: 6.3, p = 0.00) than unexposed group; and JEM exposure group has odds of 2.8 and 1.1 respectively (p<0.05) for high and low exposures. Further studies are needed to reinforce this association between COPD and occupational exposure in Bangladesh."
https://openalex.org/W3087936807,"Although many processes of diversification have been described to explain variation of morphological traits within clades that have obvious differentiation among taxa, not much is known about these patterns in complexes of cryptic species. Molossus is a genus of bats that is mainly Neotropical, occurring from the southeastern United States to southern Argentina, including the Caribbean islands. Molossus comprises some groups of species that are morphologically similar but phylogenetically divergent, and other groups of species that are genetically similar but morphologically distinct. This contrast allows investigation of unequal trait diversification and the evolution of morphological and behavioural characters. In this study, we assessed the role of phylogenetic history in a genus of bat with three cryptic species complexes, and evaluated if morphology and behavior are evolving concertedly. The Genotype by Sequence genomic approach was used to build a species-level phylogenetic tree for Molossus and to estimate the ancestral states of morphological and echolocation call characters. We measured the correlation of phylogenetic distances to morphological and echolocation distances, and tested the relationship between morphology and behavior when the effect of phylogeny is removed. Morphology evolved via a mosaic of convergence and stasis, whereas call design was influenced exclusively through local adaptation and convergent evolution. Furthermore, the frequency of echolocation calls is negatively correlated with the size of the bat, but other characters do not seem to be evolving in concert. We hypothesize that slight variation in both morphology and behaviour among species of the genus might result from niche specialization, and that traits evolve to avoid competition for resources in similar environments."
https://openalex.org/W3088872025,"Lower Eocene (Wasatchian-aged) sediments of the Margaret Formation on Ellesmere Island in Canada's High Arctic preserve evidence of a rainforest inhabited by alligators, turtles, and a diverse mammalian fauna. The mammalian fossils are fragmentary and often poorly preserved. Here, we offer an alternative method for their identification. Among the best preserved and extensive of the Eocene Arctic forests is the Strathcona Fiord Fossil Forest, which contains permineralized in situ tree stumps protruding from a prominent coal seam, but a paucity of vertebrate fossils. In 2010 and 2018, we recovered mammalian tooth fragments at the fossil forest, but they are so incomplete as to be undiagnostic by using their external morphology. We used a combination of light microscopy and SEM analysis to study the enamel microstructure of two tooth fragments from the fossil forest-NUFV2092B and 2092E. The results of our analysis indicate that NUFV2092B and 2092E have Coryphodon-enamel, which is characterized by vertical bodies that manifest as bands of nested chevrons or treelike structures visible in the tangential section under light microscopy. This enamel type is not found in other mammals known from the Arctic. Additionally, when studied under SEM, the enamel of NUFV2092B and 2092E has rounded prisms that open to one side and are surrounded by interprismatic matrix that is nearly parallel to the prisms, which also occurs in Coryphodon enamel, based on prior studies. The tooth fragments reported here, along with some poorly preserved bone fragments, thus far are the only documented vertebrate fossils from the Strathcona Fiord Fossil Forest. However, fossils of Coryphodon occur elsewhere in the Margaret Formation, so its presence at the fossil forest is not surprising. What is novel in our study is the way in which we identified the fossils using their enamel microstructure."
https://openalex.org/W3088931437,"To investigate the outcome of phacoemulsification in selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT)-treated eyes.This retrospective study included patients who had open angle glaucoma (OAG) with previous SLT who underwent phacoemulsification. We evaluated intraocular pressure (IOP), length of glaucoma control without treatment, and antiglaucoma medication or surgery. SLT-treated eyes that did not receive phacoemulsification were retrospectively chosen as a control. We investigated factors related to outcome of phacoemulsification by multivariate analysis.42 eyes with previous SLT that underwent phacoemulsification and 40 controls were retrospectively evaluated. Phacoemulsification was performed 52 ± 15 months after SLT. After a mean follow-up of 74 ± 21 months, mean IOP was significantly decreased in the phaco group by 2.2 ± 2.7 mmHg (p < 0.001). In the SLT group, mean IOP was decreased by 0.8 ± 2.8 mmHg (p < 0.001). 9 eyes (16.7%) in the phaco group and 11 eyes (19.0%) of the SLT group needed topical treatment, and no eye needed glaucoma surgery in both groups. The factor related to success was higher baseline IOP (p = 0.002).Prior SLT didn't negatively influence phacoemulsification in patients with OAG. Phacoemulsification lowered IOP effectively and safely in OAG patients who were treated with SLT."
https://openalex.org/W3089327231,"Injection laryngoplasty (IL) has been used to treat various types of glottal insufficiency. The precise volume and location of the injected materials impact the outcomes. However, exactly how increasing volumes of material are distributed is unknown. In fact, the amount of IL material required to medialize a vocal cord tends to be determined empirically. Thus, the goal of this study was to investigate the pattern of IL material distribution by checking serial micro-computed tomography (MCT) and pressure changes during ILs. This experimental study used 10 excised canine larynges. Experimental devices included the IL syringe, pressure sensor, infusion pump, fixed frame, and monitoring system. We injected calcium hydroxyapatite in the thyroarytenoid muscle; whenever 0.1 mL of material was injected, we obtained an MCT scan while simultaneously measuring the pressure. After the experiments, we performed histologic analyses. MCT analyses showed that materials initially expanded centrifugally and then expanded in all directions within the muscle. The pressure initially increased rapidly but then remained relatively constant until the point at which the materials expanded in multiple directions. Histologic analyses showed that the IL material tended to expand within the epimysium of the thyroarytenoid muscle. However, in some cases, the MCT revealed that there were leakages to the surrounding space with a corresponding pressure drop. If the IL material passes through the epimysium, leakage can occur in the surrounding space, which can account for the reduction in resistance during ILs."
