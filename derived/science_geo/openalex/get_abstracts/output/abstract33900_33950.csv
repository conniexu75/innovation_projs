https://openalex.org/W2079096224,"The neutrophil Mac-1 and gp100MEL-14 adhesion proteins are involved in neutrophil extravasation during inflammation. Both the expression and activity of Mac-1 are greatly increased after neutrophil activation. In contrast, neutrophils shed gp100MEL-14 from the cell surface within 4 minutes after activation with chemotactic factors or phorbol esters, releasing a 96-kilodalton fragment of the antigen into the supernatant. Immunohistology showed that gp100MEL-14 was downregulated on neutrophils that had extravasated into inflamed tissue. The gp100MEL-14 adhesion protein may participate in the binding of unactivated neutrophils to the endothelium; rapid shedding of gp100MEL-14 may prevent extravasation into and damage of normal tissues by activated neutrophils."
https://openalex.org/W2149439788,"Lysophosphatidate (LPA), the simplest natural phospholipid, is highly mitogenic for quiescent fibroblasts. LPA-induced cell proliferation is not dependent on other mitogens and is blocked by pertussis toxin. LPA initiates at least three separate signaling cascades: activation of a pertussis toxin-insensitive G protein mediating phosphoinositide hydrolysis with subsequent Ca2+ mobilization and stimulation of protein kinase C; release of arachidonic acid in a GTP-dependent manner, but independent of prior phosphoinositide hydrolysis; and activation of a pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi protein mediating inhibition of adenylate cyclase. The peptide bradykinin mimics LPA in inducing the first two responses but fails to activate Gi and to stimulate DNA synthesis. Our data suggest that the mitogenic action of LPA occurs through Gi or a related pertussis toxin substrate and that the phosphoinositide hydrolysis-protein kinase C pathway is neither required nor sufficient, by itself, for mitogenesis. The results further suggest that LPA or LPA-like phospholipids may have a novel role in G protein-mediated signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W2059864318,"GABAA (gamma-aminobutyric acid A)-benzodiazepine receptors expressed in mammalian cells and assembled from one of three different alpha subunit variants (alpha 1, alpha 2, or alpha 3) in combination with a beta 1 and a gamma 2 subunit display the pharmacological properties of either type I or type II receptor subtypes. These receptors contain high-affinity binding sites for benzodiazepines. However, CL 218 872, 2-oxoquazepam, and methyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM) show a temperature-modulated selectivity for alpha 1 subunit-containing receptors. There were no significant differences in the binding of clonazepam, diazepam, Ro 15-1788, or dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM) to all three recombinant receptors. Receptors containing the alpha 3 subunit show greater GABA potentiation of benzodiazepine binding than receptors containing the alpha 1 or alpha 2 subunit, indicating that there are subtypes within the type II class. Thus, diversity in benzodiazepine pharmacology is generated by heterogeneity of the alpha subunit of the GABAA receptor."

https://openalex.org/W2092964019,"The beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta-ARK), which specifically phosphorylates only the agonist-occupied form of the beta-adrenergic and closely related receptors, appears to be important in mediating rapid agonist-specific (homologous) desensitization. The structure of this enzyme was elucidated by isolating clones from a bovine brain complementary DNA library through the use of oligonucleotide probes derived from partial amino acid sequence. The beta-ARK cDNA codes for a protein of 689 amino acids (79.7 kilodaltons) with a protein kinase catalytic domain that bears greatest sequence similarity to protein kinase C and the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP)--dependent protein kinase. When this clone was inserted into a mammalian expression vector and transfected into COS-7 cells, a protein that specifically phosphorylated the agonist-occupied form of the beta 2-adrenergic receptor and phosphorylated, much more weakly, the light-bleached form of rhodopsin was expressed. RNA blot analysis revealed a messenger RNA of four kilobases with highest amounts in brain and spleen. Genomic DNA blot analysis also suggests that beta-ARK may be the first sequenced member of a multigene family of receptor kinases."

https://openalex.org/W2039295568,"Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a model for learning and memory processes. Tetanic stimulation of the sensory cortex produces LTP in motor cortical neurons, whereas tetanization of the ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus, which also projects to the motor cortex, does not. However, after simultaneous high-frequency stimulation of both the sensory cortex and the ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus, LTP of thalamic input to motor cortical neurons is induced. This associative LTP occurs only in neurons in the superficial layers of the motor cortex that receive monosynaptic input from both the sensory cortex and the ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus. Associative LTP in the motor cortex may constitute a basis for the retention of motor skills."

https://openalex.org/W1938975553,"The ability of three pure types of bovine brain phospholipase C (PLC) and one pure rat liver PLC to utilize as substrates the recently discovered phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI-3-P), a putative phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PI-3,4-P2), and phosphatidylinositol trisphosphate (PIP3) was investigated. PI-3-P, PI-3,4-P2, and PIP3 are the products of phosphorylation of PI, PI-4-P, and PI-4,5-P2, respectively, by phosphoinositide 3-kinase activities that are associated with certain protein-tyrosine kinases. Although these new phospholipids have been found in intact cells, PI-3,4-P2 and PIP3 appear only after stimulation of quiescent cells with growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (Auger, K. R., Serunian, L. A., Soltoff, S. P., Libby, P., and Cantley, L. C. (1989) Cell 57, 167-175) and after transformation by certain oncoproteins (L. A. Serunian, K. R. Auger, T. M. Roberts, and L. C. Cantley, manuscript in preparation). Mixtures of [3H]PI-4-P plus [32P]PI-3-P or [3H]PI-4,5-P2 plus [32P]PI-3,4-P2 or PIP3 alone were used as substrates for PLCs in vitro. After incubation with enzyme followed by extraction with chloroform/methanol/HCl, the ratio of 3H/32P in the aqueous layer revealed the selective hydrolysis of PI-4-P and PI-4,5-P2 over PI-3-P and PI-3,4-P2. High performance liquid chromatography analysis of the aqueous layer containing reaction products confirmed that only PI-4-P and PI-4,5-P2, were hydrolyzed to inositol 1,4-P2 and inositol 1,4,5-P3, respectively. These findings suggest that the turnover of PI-3-P, PI-3,4-P2, and PIP3 occurs independently of the turnover of PI-4-P and PI-4,5-P2."
https://openalex.org/W1601185542,"Abstract The subunit structure of the rabbit skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor-Ca2+ release channel complex was examined following solubilization of heavy sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes in two zwitterionic detergents, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid (Chaps) and Zwittergent 3-14. High and low affinity [3H]ryanodine binding was retained upon solubilization of the complex in Chaps but was lost in Zwittergent 3-14. The purified complex migrated as a single peak with an apparent sedimentation coefficient of approximately 30 and approximately 9 S upon density gradient centrifugation and with isoelectric points of 3.7 and 3.9 upon two-dimensional gel electrophoresis in Chaps and Zwittergent 3-14, respectively. Electron microscopy of negatively stained samples indicated that the distinct four-leaf clover structure of the ryanodine receptor observed in Chaps disappeared following Zwittergent treatment of the 30 S complex and instead showed smaller, round particles. Ferguson plot analysis following sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of partial and fully cross-linked and incompletely denatured complexes suggested a stoichiometry of four Mr approximately 400,000 peptides/30 S ryanodine receptor oligomer. [3H]Ryanodine binding to the membrane-bound receptor in 50 microM--1 mM free Ca2+ revealed the presence of both high affinity (KD = 8 nM, Hill coefficient (nH) = 0.9) and low affinity (nH approximately 0.45) sites with a ratio of 1:3. Reduction in free Ca2+ to less than or equal to 0.1 microM or trypsin digestion of the membranes resulted in loss of high affinity but not low affinity ryanodine binding (Hill KD = 5,000 nM, nH = 0.9). Addition of 20 mM caffeine to the nanomolar Ca2+ medium decreased the Hill KD to 1,000 nM without changing the Hill coefficient. Occupation of the low affinity sites altered the rate of [3H]ryanodine dissociation from the high affinity sites. Single channel recordings of the purified ryanodine receptor channel incorporated into planar lipid bilayers also indicated the existence of high and low affinity sites for ryanodine, occupation of which resulted in formation of a subconducting and completely closed state of the channel, respectively. These results are compatible with a subunit structural model of the 30 S ryanodine receptor-Ca2+ release channel complex which comprises a homotetramer of negatively charged and allosterically coupled polypeptides of Mr approximately 400,000."

https://openalex.org/W2003470220,"Quail embryo cells (QECs) are primary cultures of fibroblastoid cells that become myogenic after infection with avian retroviruses expressing the ski oncogene (SKVs). ski also stimulates proliferation of QECs and induces morphological transformation and anchorage-independent growth. Paradoxically, ski-transformed clones picked from soft agar are capable of muscle differentiation. ski-induced differentiation is essentially indistinguishable from that of uninfected myoblasts in culture with regard to muscle-specific gene expression, commitment, and inhibition by growth factors or other oncogenes. However, ski-induced myoblasts have less stringent requirements for growth and differentiation. Uninfected QECs cannot differentiate and do not express an early marker for the myogenic lineage. Clonal analysis indicates that at least 40% of QECs are converted by ski to differentiating myoblasts. The data suggest that ski induces either the capacity for differentiation in an ""incompetent"" muscle precursor or the determination of nonmyogenic cells to the myogenic lineage."
https://openalex.org/W2101448549,"SV40 DNA replication in vivo is greatly stimulated by cis-acting transcriptional elements. We studied a model viral chromosome containing a single binding site for the cellular transcriptional activator, nuclear factor I (NF-I/CTF), located adjacent to the replication origin. The presence of the NF-I recognition site increased replication efficiency over 20-fold in vivo. Purified NF-I had little effect on the replication efficiency in the standard SV40 cell-free system when the template was introduced as naked DNA. However, NF-I specifically prevented the repression of DNA replication that occurred when the template was preassembled into chromatin. Our data support a model in which the binding of a transcriptional activator perturbs the local distribution of nucleosomes, thereby increasing the accessibility of the origin region."
https://openalex.org/W2022821869,"The bovine papillomavirus E5 transforming gene encodes a 44 amino acid protein product that is localized to cytoplasmic membranes, including the plasma membrane. We now report that E5 can cooperate with human EGF receptors and with human CSF-1 receptors to induce cellular transformation of NIH 3T3 cells. Cooperation occurred in the absence of receptor stimulation by ligand, and it was further augmented by treatment with ligand. Cooperation was not seen between E5 and either c-fes or c-src. The cooperation between E5 and high levels of EGF receptors was associated with inhibition of receptor degradation and persistence of activated receptors on the cell surface. We conclude that E5 may enhance the receptor activity via inhibition of receptor down-modulation."
https://openalex.org/W2011844896,"Substitution of phenylalanine for tyrosine 315 of the polyoma virus middle T (mT) protein lowers the incidence and limits the spectrum of tumors induced following inoculation of the virus into newborn mice. This substitution removes the major site of phosphorylation by pp60c-src without altering the ability of mT to associate with or to activate pp60c-src. The mutant mT fails to show binding of a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (Ptdlns 3-kinase) activity that is normally present in wild-type mT complexes. Furthermore, an anti-peptide antiserum that specifically recognizes mT lacking phosphate at tyrosine 315 precipitates binary (mT-pp60c-src) but not ternary (mT-pp60c-src-Ptdlns 3-kinase) complexes from wild-type infected cell extracts. Reprecipitation with either anti-pp60c-src or anti-mT serum brings down ternary complexes containing mT phosphorylated on tyrosine 315. Phosphorylation of mT by pp60c-src in vivo is therefore a critical event for binding of Ptdlns 3-kinase and for expression of the full tumorigenic potential of the virus."
https://openalex.org/W2003196630,"Transformation by the v-sis oncogene appears to require an interaction of its protein product, p28v-sis, with the receptor for the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). However, this interaction may not occur at the cell surface as predicted by the autocrine hypothesis because phenotypic transformation was not reversed by incubation of SSV-NRK cells with antisera to PDGF and because morphological transformation did not occur when nontransformed NRK cells were cultured continuously with p28v-sis. A mutant of the wild-type v-sis gene was constructed that encodes a v-sis protein targeted for retention within the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi. NRK cells expressing the mutant v-sis gene did not secrete any detectable v-sis protein but were as fully transformed as wild-type v-sis transfectants. The results support a mechanism of transformation by v-sis in which internal activation of the PDGF receptor occurs before expression of either p28v-sis or the PDGF receptor at the cell surface."

https://openalex.org/W2016270258,"Drosophila P transposable elements encode an 87 kd trans-acting protein, transposase, that is required to catalyze P element transposition and excision. We show here that purified transposase is a site-specific DNA binding protein. P element transposase does not interact with the terminal 31 bp inverted repeats but instead interacts specifically with an internal 10 bp consensus sequence present at both the 5' and 3' ends of P element DNA. These binding sites lie within sequences known to be important for transposition in vivo. Transposase also displays an unusually high nonspecific affinity for DNA. The transposase binding site at the 5' and overlaps sequences we show to be essential for transcription from the P element promoter in vitro, which raises the possibility that either transposase or the related 66 kd P element protein may affect P element transcription. From these and other observations, we suggest that the P element transposition reaction probably requires the binding of additional Drosophila protein factors to the terminal DNA sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1582722192,"Degradation intermediates of the estrogen-regulated apolipoprotein (apo) II mRNA were identified by S1 nuclease mapping and primer extension analysis. S1 mapping of poly(A)-RNA detected a series of mRNAs truncated at specific sites in the 3'-noncoding region. Many of these sites were also detected by primer extension analysis indicating that truncated molecules resulted from endonucleolytic cleavage in the 3'-noncoding region. Identical cleavage sites were seen with RNA from estrogen-treated animals or from animals withdrawn from hormone under conditions where apoII mRNA degraded in the slow (t1/2 = 13 h) or rapid (t1/2 = 1.5 h) decay mode. No differences were seen in poly(A) tail length or heterogeneity among these conditions. These results indicate that the estrogen-induced alteration in apoII mRNA turnover does not involve a new pathway of degradation, but, more likely, involves an increased targeting of the mRNA for degradation by a preexisting pathway. These data are consistent with a mechanism in which the initial step in apoII mRNA degradation is an endonucleolytic cleavage in the 3'-noncoding region without prior removal of the poly(A) tail. The endonucleolytic cleavage sites occurred predominantly at 5'-AAU-3' or 5'-UAA-3' trinucleotides found in single-stranded domains in a secondary structure model of the naked mRNA (Hwang, S-P. L., Eisenberg, M., Binder, R., Shelness, G. S., and Williams, D. L. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 8410-8418). The structure of the 3'-noncoding region in polyribosomal messenger ribonucleoprotein was examined by titrations of liver homogenates with dimethyl sulfate and cobra venom RNase. The results suggest that the typical cleavage site is a 5'-AAU-3' or 5'-UAA-3' trinucleotide in an accessible single-stranded loop domain. Single-stranded domains alone or accessible domains alone are not sufficient for cleavage. Similarly, 5'-AAU-3' or 5'-UAA-3' trinucleotides alone are not sufficient for cleavage. Localization of these trinucleotides to accessible single-stranded domains in the polyribosomal messenger ribonucleoprotein may provide the specificity for cleavage during targeted degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1669530983,"Previous results from our laboratory have shown that 1) cultured rat cells contain two classes of tropomyosin (TM), one (high Mr TMs) with higher Mr values and greater affinity for actin than the other (low Mr TMs); 2) presaturation of F-actin with high Mr TMs, but not with low Mr TMs, inhibits both actin-severing and actin binding activities of gelsolin; and 3) nonmuscle caldesmon not only enhances the inhibitory effects of high Mr TMs but also makes low Mr TMs capable of inhibiting the severing activity of gelsolin (Ishikawa, R., Yamashiro, S., and Matsumura, F. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 7490-7497). These results suggest that gelsolin has much lower affinity for F-actin-TM-caldesmon complexes than for pure F-actin. We have therefore examined whether addition of TM and/or caldesmon to gelsolin-severed actin filaments can make gelsolin dissociate from barbed ends of actin filaments, resulting in annealing of short actin filaments into long ones. Flow birefringence and electron microscopic studies have suggested that high Mr TMs slowly and partially anneal gelsolin-severed actin fragments in 3 h, whereas low Mr TMs have no effects. Nonmuscle caldesmon greatly potentiates the effects of high Mr TMs and accelerates the process to 20 min, whereas nonmuscle caldesmon alone shows no effects. Furthermore, nonmuscle caldesmon makes low Mr TMs capable of reversing gelsolin-severing action. Actin binding assay has shown that gelsolin (or a gelsolin-actin complex) is dissociated from these annealed actin filaments. Smooth muscle TM and smooth muscle caldesmon also appear to anneal gelsolin-severed actin fragments as do high Mr TMs and nonmuscle caldesmon. Calmodulin decreases the potentiation effects of caldesmon as calmodulin inhibits actin binding of caldesmon. These results suggest that tropomyosin and caldesmon may regulate both capping and severing activities of gelsolin."
https://openalex.org/W2063177583,"Transposon Tn10 promotes the formation of a circular product containing only transposon sequences. We show that these circles result from an intramolecular transposition reaction in which all of the strand cleavage and ligation events have occurred but newly created transposon/target junctions have not undergone repair. The unligated strand termini at these junctions are those expected according to a simple model in which the target DNA is cleaved by a pair of staggered nicks 9 bp apart, transposon sequences are separated from flanking donor DNA by cleavage at the terminal nucleotides on both strands (at both ends) of the element, and 3' transposon strand ends are ligated to 5' target strand ends. The stability of the unligated junctions suggests that they are protected from cellular processing by transposase and/or host proteins. We propose that the nonreplicative nature of Tn10 transposition is determined by the efficiency with which the nontransferred transposon strand is separated from flanking donor DNA and by the nature of the protein-DNA complexes present at the strand transfer junctions."
https://openalex.org/W1484288251,"Abstract Porcine submaxillary beta-galactoside alpha(1----2)-fucosyltransferase is known to transfer a fucosyl residue from guanosine 5'-diphosphofucose (GDP-fucose) to the 2-OH group of beta-D-galactopyranosides with inversion of configuration at the fucopyranosyl anomeric carbon. A bisubstrate analog (1) of the postulated transition-state for this reaction, which has O-2 of phenyl beta-D-galactopyranoside attached to the terminal phosphorous of GDP through a flexible ethylene bridge, has been chemically synthesized and evaluated as an inhibitor of this enzyme. Compound 1 was found to be a competitive inhibitor with respect to both GDP-fucose and phenyl beta-D-galactopyranoside for both the membrane-bound and soluble forms of the fucosyltransferase. It was also a competitive inhibitor with respect to the alternate acceptor beta DGal(1----3)beta DGlcNAcO(CH2)8-COOMe. The Ki values were in the range 2.3-16 microM. Compound 1 is the first example of a bisubstrate analog inhibitor for a glycosyltransferase which binds to both the acceptor and donor recognition sites of the enzyme. The potential of a bisubstrate analog strategy for the production of specific glycosyltransferase inhibitors is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1482333001,"The Ah receptor is an intracellular protein that binds the environmental contaminant 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. The liganded receptor interacts with a specific DNA recognition motif located within a dioxin-responsive enhancer upstream of the CYP1A1 gene. Methylation protection and methylation interference studies indicate that the liganded receptor contacts both DNA strands, at 4 guanine residues contained within the recognition motif. These findings imply that the liganded receptor interacts with its cognate enhancer within the major groove of the DNA helix. Cytosine methylation of the recognition motif at CpG dinucleotides diminishes the protein-DNA interaction, as measured by gel retardation. Furthermore, methylation at cytosine inhibits the enhancer function of the DNA. These findings imply that DNA methylation can diminish the response to dioxin by impeding the Ah receptor-enhancer interaction."

https://openalex.org/W1563036503,"Abstract Hemopexin (HPX) transports heme to liver parenchymal cells, undergoes receptor-mediated endocytosis, and recycles intact. Incubation of mouse hepatoma (Hepa) cells with heme-HPX causes a rapid dose- and time-dependent increase in the steady-state level of heme oxygenase (HO) mRNA. A maximum induction of 20-25-fold is achieved within 3 h after incubation with 10 microM heme-HPX. This accumulation of HO mRNA results primarily from increased transcription of the HO gene as judged by in vitro nuclear run-on assays. In addition, receptor-mediated transport of heme into Hepa cells significantly decreases the steady-state level of transferrin receptor (TfR) mRNA. While a 25-30-fold decrease in the amount of TfR mRNA is observed within 3 h of incubation of Hepa cells with 10 microM heme-HPX, no significant change in the rate of TfR gene transcription was detected. These regulatory effects of heme-HPX are not restricted to hepatic cells but are also observed in human promyelocytic HL-60 cells. This is the first direct demonstration of receptor-mediated transport of heme by hemopexin regulating gene expression in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2045435166,"We report the identification and characterization of a class of IS10 transposase mutants that carry out only some of the steps required for transposition. These mutants were identified among transposition-defective mutants as a specific subclass that retains the wild-type ability to induce SOS functions in the presence of transposon ends. Mutants of this class successfully promote excision of the element from its donor site, but do not promote transfer of the transposon sequences to a target site. SOS induction presumably results from the degradation of the donor site. Uniquely among transposition-defective mutants, SOS+ Tnsp- mutants promote the formation of a new product, the excised transposon fragment (ETF), which consists of the transposon excised from the original donor molecule by double-strand breaks at the transposon ends. SOS+ Tnsp- mutants identified thus far define two patches of amino acids that might correspond to regions of different function. A single additional mutation maps within a region that is highly conserved among IS element transposases. The existence of SOS+ Tnsp- mutants and the structure of the ETF provide strong support for the previously proposed nonreplicative model of Tn10/IS10 transposition."
https://openalex.org/W2068713912,"The poliovirus terminal protein, VPg, was covalently linked to poliovirus RNA in a reaction that required synthetic VPg, Mg2+, and a replication intermediate synthesized in vitro. The VPg linkage reaction did not require the viral polymerase, host factor, or ribonucleoside triphosphates and was specific for template-linked minus-strand RNA synthesized on poliovirion RNA. The covalent nature of the bond between VPg and the RNA was demonstrated by the isolation of VPg-pUp from VPg-linked RNA. A model is proposed in which the tyrosine residue in VPg forms a phosphodiester bond with the 5'UMP in minus-strand RNA in a self-catalyzed transesterification reaction. It appears that either the RNA, VPg, or a combination of both forms the catalytic center for this reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2070644654,"Joining of V-, D-, and J-region gene segments during DNA rearrangements within all antigen receptor genes involves recognition of the same highly conserved heptamernonamer sequences flanking each segment. In order to investigate the possibility that recognition of these conserved sequences may sometimes permit intergenic joining of segments among different antigen receptor genes, DNA of normal human lymphoid tissues was examined by polymerase chain reaction amplification for the presence of chimeric gamma-delta T cell receptor gene rearrangements. These studies detected V gamma-(D delta)-J delta and V delta-(D delta)-J gamma rearrangements in thymus, peripheral blood, and tonsil. Analysis of thymus RNA indicated that many of these rearrangements are expressed as V gamma-(D delta)-J delta-C delta and V delta-(D delta)-J gamma-C gamma transcripts. Most transcripts (19 of 20 complementary DNA clones studied) are appropriately spliced and show correct open translational reading frames across the V-(D)-J junctions. Thus, chimeric antigen receptor genes are generated in a subset of normal lymphoid cells, probably as a result of chromosomal translocations, and such genes may possibly contribute to increased diversity within the antigen receptor repertoire."
https://openalex.org/W1515270981,"A canine pancreas homogenate was subfractionated by several differential centrifugation steps. The distribution of cAMP-dependent protein kinase in the various fractions was monitored by assaying [3H]cAMP binding and photo-cross-linking of the regulatory subunits of the enzyme (RI and RII) with radiolabeled 8-azido-cAMP. The distribution of the kinase was also compared to that of markers for the plasma membrane, the endoplasmic reticulum and the cytosol. While our results confirm previous studies suggesting the presence of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase in the cytosol and Golgi, a significant amount of the total [3H] cAMP binding and photolabeled R subunits (both RI and RII) were found in rough microsomes (RM). The association is relatively resistant to extraction with EDTA, low and high ionic strength solutions. These extractions unmasked several new phosphorylation substrates in the stripped RM that were inaccessible in the RM, possibly because they were covered by ribosomes or peripheral membrane proteins. RII with a molecular mass of 52 kDa (RII-52 kDa) was the predominant RII found in the cytosolic fraction, whereas RII-52 kDa and RII with a molecular mass of 54 kDa (RII-54 kDa) were approximately equally enriched in the RM fraction. The mobility of the RII-52 kDa-photolabeled band could be shifted to the mobility of the RII-54 kDa band by phosphorylation with purified catalytic subunit and ATP, indicating that they represent dephospho and phospho forms of RII, respectively. A more precise localization to the rough endoplasmic reticulum was accomplished by isopycnic floatation in sucrose gradients. The enzyme cobanded at the density of rough microsomes and shifted to the lower density of stripped microsomes after treatment with puromycin/high salt, which specifically removes ribosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1577573797,"In view of the striking homology among various ion-translocating ATPases including Na,K-ATPase, Ca-ATPase, and H,K-ATPase, and the recent evidence that protons can replace cytoplasmic sodium as well as potassium in the reaction mechanism of the Na,K-ATPase (Polvani, C., and Blostein, R. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 16757-16763), we studied the role of sodium as a substitute for protons in the H,K-ATPase reaction. Using hog gastric H,K-ATPase-rich inside-out membrane vesicles we observed 22Na+ influx which was stimulated by intravesicular potassium ions (K+i) at pH 8.5 but not at pH 7.1. This sodium influx was observed in medium containing ATP and was inhibited by vanadate and SCH28080, a selective inhibitor of the gastric H,K-ATPase. At least 2-fold accumulation of sodium was observed at pH 8.5. Experiments aimed to determine the sidedness of the alkaline pH requirement for K+i-dependent sodium influx showed that K+i-activated sodium influx depends on pHout and is unaffected by changes in pHin. These results support the conclusion that sodium ions substitute for protons in the H,K-ATPase reaction mechanism and provide evidence for a similarity in ion selectivity and/or binding domains of the Na,K-ATPase and the gastric H,K-ATPase enzymes."

Intracellular pH (pHi) was measured by using the fluorescent dye 2‘,7‘-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein. Stimulation of A431 cells by epidermal growth factor (EGF), bradykinin (BK), phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and osmotic shrinkage resulted in exchanger activation. In PBM, activation of Na+/H+ exchanger was induced by concanavalin A (Con A) and phytohemagglutinin (PHA), as well as PMA and osmotic shrinkage. Inhibition of protein kinase C inhibited only PMA-stimulated exchanger activation in both cell types. When osmotic shrinkage was applied after exposure of the cells to any agonist, augmentation of exchanger activation by osmotic stress was observed. These findings suggest that various stimuli activate Na+/H+ exchanger through different mechanisms. Kinetic analysis demonstrated that activation of the exchanger by any type of stimulus resulted in modification of the apparent affinities for intracellular H+ (H+i) and intracellular Na+ (Na+i) in opposite directions. While there is an increased apparent affinity for H+i, the apparent affinity for Na+i decreases. This finding suggests that in A431 cells this phenomenon serves as a common mechanism for activation of Na+/H+ exchanger by different stimuli.— Green, J.; Muallem, S.

Lateral immobilization of varying fractions of F and/or HN (after virus adsorption and hemagglutination, but before fusion) was achieved by cross-linking them with succinyl concanavalin A (inhibiting both F and HN) or with specific rabbit IgG directed against either F or HN. Alternatively, agglutinated cells were treated with low concentrations of the above proteins (inducing only minor inhibition of either mobility or fusion), and immobilization of F and/or HN was induced by cross-linking with a secondary antibody; this protocol ensured a minimal contribution of direct binding to the viral proteins to the inhibition of fusion. Our results demonstrate that lateral immobilization of either F or HN results in a strong inhibition of cell-cell fusion and a much weaker inhibition of virus-cell fusion. The level of cell-cell fusion was directly correlated with the level of laterally mobile viral glycoproteins in the cell membrane (either F or HN). We conclude that lateral mobility of both F and HN in the red cell membrane is essential for cell-cell fusion and that not only F but also HN has a role in this fusion event. The possible reasons for the different dependence of cell-cell and virus-cell fusion on viral glycoprotein mobility are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1518306284,"The gene encoding a catalytically active deletion peptide, the C180 peptide, of the S-1 subunit of pertussis toxin was engineered to facilitate mutagenesis at the Trp-26 (wild-type) coding sequence. A synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotide was inserted into the C180 gene such that all possible codons would be introduced into position 26. Seven individual mutants of the C180 peptide which possessed amino acid substitutions at residue 26 (collectively termed C180W26n peptides) were purified from periplasmic extracts of Escherichia coli. Each C180W26n peptide was present as a single major peptide that had an apparent molecular mass of between 20.9 and 24.5 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and each showed similar immunoreactivity relative to the C180 peptide. The C180W26n peptides demonstrated marked reduction of both ADP-ribosyltransferase and NAD glycohydrolase activities at 25 nM and 10 microM NAD, respectively. Kinetic analysis of the two most active mutants, C180W26F and C180W26Y, revealed that the major perturbation of NAD glycohydrolase activity was due to an increase (approximately 20-fold) in the Km for NAD between these mutants and the C180 peptide."
https://openalex.org/W1501162330,"Abstract The ability of bovine intermediate lobe secretory vesicle membrane-associated enzyme(s) and purified, soluble paired basic residue-specific, pro-opiomelanocortin converting enzyme (Loh, Y.P., Parish, D. C., and Tuteja, R. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 7194-7205) to cleave bovine NH2-terminal pro-opiomelanocortin1-77 (N-POMC 1-77) was investigated. Purified pro-opiomelanocortin converting enzyme and an enzyme activity associated with the secretory vesicle membrane were shown to cleave bovine N-POMC1-77 to two major products: N-POMC1-49 and Lys-gamma 3-melanotropin (MSH), and one minor product, gamma 3-MSH. These products were identified by their retention times on high performance liquid chromatography, immunological characteristics, and for Lys-gamma 3-MSH, amino acid composition. The products generated indicate cleavage preferentially between Arg 49-Lys 50 of bN-POMC1-77 (where b indicates bovine), which is identical to the processing pattern found in the bovine intermediate lobe in situ. The membrane converting activity was shown to be stimulated by 5 mM Ca2+ and has a pH optimum of 4-5 and an inhibitor profile characteristic of an aspartic protease. This suggests that the membrane-associated enzyme involved is very similar or identical to the purified, soluble pro-opiomelanocortin converting enzyme, which has previously been reported to be an acidic, aspartic protease responsible for the initial steps of POMC processing. The results of this study lead to the proposal that the lack of processing of the Arg49-Lys50 site in POMC in the anterior lobe versus the intermediate lobe of the pituitary in vivo may be due to other regulatory mechanisms rather than invoking the existence in the intermediate lobe of another enzyme specific for this site, different from pro-opiomelanocortin converting enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1608709832,"The mammalian cytochrome c oxidase is a complex of 13 different subunits. We present the full amino acid sequence of the one remaining uncharacterized subunit, subunit IHQ in the nomenclature used here, VIIb in the numbering system of Kadenbach and colleagues (e.g. Kadenbach, B., and Merle, P. (1981) FEBS Lett. 135, 1-11). A partial protein sequence was obtained from the purified subunit isolated by gel filtration procedures. This information was used to synthesize an oligonucleotide probe which was then used to isolate a cDNA clone encoding the subunit. This cDNA for subunit IHQ is 480 base pairs long and encodes a polypeptide which is either 83 or 88 amino acids long, including an N-terminal leader sequence of either 27 or 32 residues. The molecular weight of the mature subunit IHQ is 6350 based on the amino acid sequence deduced from the gene. The leader sequence is typical of other mitochondrial target sequences in having several positively charged residues but no negatively charged side chains."

We investigated their role in ocular herpes simplex infection in mice by using capsaicin, which causes degeneration and permanent loss of peptidergic neurons in neonates and temporary peptide depletion in adult animals. The corneas of neonatally denervated BALB/c mice were observed for capsaicin-induced keratitis at 11-14 wk of age and were then infected bilaterally with herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1); trigeminal (TG) ganglia were cocultivated 6 wk later to establish the rate of latent infection. We also applied capsaicin eye drops to adult BALB/c mice that had been infected with HSV-1 6 wk earlier, and measured viral shedding before, and 3 days and 2 months after, administration of capsaicin drops; TG ganglia of these animals were cocultivated at 3 days and 2 months after capsaicin application. Neurotrophic keratitis was found in 81% of neonatally denervated animals; mortality rate due to HSV-1 infection was reduced from 80% in the controls to 24% in the capsaicin-treated group, and recovery of latent virus by cocultivation was reduced by 50%. Viral shedding could not be produced by capsaicin eye drops in adult animals infected with HSV-1. However, recovery of latent virus was significantly reduced in TG ganglia sampled 3 days and 2 months after capsaicin drops were instilled. Our findings suggest 1) that peptidergic fibers play a crucial role in the establishment of trigeminal HSV-1 latency and 2) that reactivation of latently infected ganglia can be inhibited by topical capsaicin."

https://openalex.org/W2133116561,"A polypeptide growth factor, Harderian gland-derived growth factor (HGDGF), has been purified approximately 43,000-fold from guinea pig Harderian gland by column chromatography on TSK gel DEAE-5PW, blue-Sepharose CL-6B, and Superose 12. The yield was approximately 10%. The Superose 12 fraction was further purified by Aquapore BU-300 reversed-phase chromatography to apparent homogeneity. HGDGF was eluted from TSK gel DEAE-5PW at 0.20-0.35 M NaCl, with a linear gradient of 0.15-0.80 M NaCl and at 2.20 M NaCl from blue-Sepharose CL-6B. The activity of HGDGF toward human embryonic cells (TIG-3) was quantitated, [3H]thymidine incorporation for 48 h being stimulated in a linear and dose-dependent manner. Purified HGDGF has a molecular weight of approximately 13,000, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and molecular sieve column chromatography. HGDGF is labile to treatment with SH reagents or acetic acid. Both trypsin digestion and boiling decrease the activity of HGDGF. Its pI is 5.1. HGDGF stimulates the multiplication of TIG-3 cells but has no effect on human endothelial cells K2T1 or A2T2 which require fibroblast growth factor for growth. HGDGF appears to differ from other growth factors, suggesting that it is a previously undescribed growth factor."
https://openalex.org/W1590317409,"The catalytic subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase from bovine cardiac muscle phosphorylates homoserine in the synthetic peptide Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Hse-Leu-Gly. Phosphorylation of the primary alcohol of the homoserine residue was established via NMR spectroscopy. Two-dimensional correlated and nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopies provided the sequence-specific chemical shift assignments of the substrate peptide and its phosphorylated counterpart. Coupled and decoupled 31P NMR experiments established the presence of phosphate on the homoserine residue. The maximal velocity (6.4 mumol/min.mg) obtained for homoserine-peptide phosphorylation at 12.5 mM Mg2+ compares favorably to the velocities observed for the corresponding serine- (21 mumol/min.mg), threonine- (3.2 mumol/min.mg), and hydroxyproline-peptides (1 mumol/min.mg). However, the Km for homoserine kinase activity is modest (1.3 mM) relative to the Km associated with the phosphorylation of the serine-containing substrate (22 microM). The effect of Mg2+ concentration on the kinetic parameters kcat, Km, and kcat/Km was investigated for both serine- and homoserine-peptides. Both substrates display similar kcat/Km versus [Mg2+] profiles, with the most notable difference that the optimal Mg2+ concentration is higher for the homoserine-containing peptide. In addition, the Km for the serine-peptide was found to be independent of [Mg2+], whereas the Km for the homoserine-peptide was observed to be dependent upon [Mg2+]. These results suggest that the long homoserine side chain may induce an unusually large off rate for the peptide and/or may misalign the hydroxyl moiety in the active site."
https://openalex.org/W1489472245,"Dual cis-acting silencer elements are located upstream of the mouse DNA polymerase beta gene (Yamaguchi, M., Hayashi, Y., and Matsukage, A. (1989) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 105, 79-83). In order to examine possible involvement of transcriptional silencer elements in the regulation of DNA replication, we have utilized a transient replication system of the plasmid DNA carrying replication origin of polyoma virus DNA in mouse MOP8 cells, which is constitutively producing polyoma virus large T-antigen. The polyoma virus origin of DNA replication is composed of three cis-acting genetic elements called alpha, beta, and core, in which alpha and beta elements correspond to enhancer domains. When the 5'-flanking regions of the DNA polymerase beta gene containing silencer elements were placed at the late gene border of alpha element, they effectively repressed the DNA replication. However, when placed at the early gene border of core element, it only marginally repressed the DNA replication. These results suggest that the silencer elements at cis position repress polyoma virus DNA replication by impeding the enhancer function that activates the DNA replication."

https://openalex.org/W1583960287,"Previously, we isolated several inhibitors that block the site-specific recombination reaction mediated by the Tn3-encoded resolvase protein. One class of inhibitors blocks resolvase binding to the recombination (res) sitc, and a second class inhibits synapse formation between resolvase and two directly repeated res sites. In this report, we identify an inhibitor, A20832, that does not inhibit resolvase binding to res, as measured by filter binding, or synapse formation. Inhibition of resolvase-promoted site-specific recombination by A20832 occurs postsynaptically at strand cleavage. DNase I analysis in the presence of A20832 indicates that only site I of res is bound by resolvase."
