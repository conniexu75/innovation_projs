https://openalex.org/W4225364558,"Many diseases are driven by proteins that are aberrantly ubiquitinated and degraded. These diseases would be therapeutically benefited by targeted protein stabilization (TPS). Here we present deubiquitinase-targeting chimeras (DUBTACs), heterobifunctional small molecules consisting of a deubiquitinase recruiter linked to a protein-targeting ligand, to stabilize the levels of specific proteins degraded in a ubiquitin-dependent manner. Using chemoproteomic approaches, we discovered the covalent ligand EN523 that targets a non-catalytic allosteric cysteine C23 in the K48-ubiquitin-specific deubiquitinase OTUB1. We showed that a DUBTAC consisting of our EN523 OTUB1 recruiter linked to lumacaftor, a drug used to treat cystic fibrosis that binds ΔF508-cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), robustly stabilized ΔF508-CFTR protein levels, leading to improved chloride channel conductance in human cystic fibrosis bronchial epithelial cells. We also demonstrated stabilization of the tumor suppressor kinase WEE1 in hepatoma cells. Our study showcases covalent chemoproteomic approaches to develop new induced proximity-based therapeutic modalities and introduces the DUBTAC platform for TPS."
https://openalex.org/W4213439903,"Canonically, EZH2 serves as the catalytic subunit of PRC2, which mediates H3K27me3 deposition and transcriptional repression. Here, we report that in acute leukaemias, EZH2 has additional noncanonical functions by binding cMyc at non-PRC2 targets and uses a hidden transactivation domain (TAD) for (co)activator recruitment and gene activation. Both canonical (EZH2-PRC2) and noncanonical (EZH2-TAD-cMyc-coactivators) activities of EZH2 promote oncogenesis, which explains the slow and ineffective antitumour effect of inhibitors of the catalytic function of EZH2. To suppress the multifaceted activities of EZH2, we used proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) to develop a degrader, MS177, which achieved effective, on-target depletion of EZH2 and interacting partners (that is, both canonical EZH2-PRC2 and noncanonical EZH2-cMyc complexes). Compared with inhibitors of the enzymatic function of EZH2, MS177 is fast-acting and more potent in suppressing cancer growth. This study reveals noncanonical oncogenic roles of EZH2, reports a PROTAC for targeting the multifaceted tumorigenic functions of EZH2 and presents an attractive strategy for treating EZH2-dependent cancers."
https://openalex.org/W4213457742,"The combination of single-cell transcriptomics with mitochondrial DNA variant detection can be used to establish lineage relationships in primary human cells, but current methods are not scalable to interrogate complex tissues. Here, we combine common 3' single-cell RNA-sequencing protocols with mitochondrial transcriptome enrichment to increase coverage by more than 50-fold, enabling high-confidence mutation detection. The method successfully identifies skewed immune-cell expansions in primary human clonal hematopoiesis."
https://openalex.org/W4213458181,"Abstract The mammalian brain contains many specialized cells that develop from a thin sheet of neuroepithelial progenitor cells. Single-cell transcriptomics revealed hundreds of molecularly diverse cell types in the nervous system, but the lineage relationships between mature cell types and progenitor cells are not well understood. Here we show in vivo barcoding of early progenitors to simultaneously profile cell phenotypes and clonal relations in the mouse brain using single-cell and spatial transcriptomics. By reconstructing thousands of clones, we discovered fate-restricted progenitor cells in the mouse hippocampal neuroepithelium and show that microglia are derived from few primitive myeloid precursors that massively expand to generate widely dispersed progeny. We combined spatial transcriptomics with clonal barcoding and disentangled migration patterns of clonally related cells in densely labeled tissue sections. Our approach enables high-throughput dense reconstruction of cell phenotypes and clonal relations at the single-cell and tissue level in individual animals and provides an integrated approach for understanding tissue architecture."

https://openalex.org/W4213417852,"Given global Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine shortages and inequity of vaccine distributions, fractionation of vaccine doses might be an effective strategy for reducing public health and economic burden, notwithstanding the emergence of new variants of concern. In this study, we developed a multi-scale model incorporating population-level transmission and individual-level vaccination to estimate the costs of hospitalization and vaccination and the economic benefits of reducing COVID-19 deaths due to dose-fractionation strategies in India. We used large-scale survey data of the willingness to pay together with data of vaccine and hospital admission costs to build the model. We found that fractional doses of vaccines could be an economically viable vaccination strategy compared to alternatives of either full-dose vaccination or no vaccination. Dose-sparing strategies could save a large number of lives, even with the emergence of new variants with higher transmissibility."
https://openalex.org/W4213429504,"Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) home to the bone marrow via, in part, interactions with vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM1)1–3. Once in the bone marrow, HSCs are vetted by perivascular phagocytes to ensure their self-integrity. Here we show that VCAM1 is also expressed on healthy HSCs and upregulated on leukaemic stem cells (LSCs), where it serves as a quality-control checkpoint for entry into bone marrow by providing ‘don’t-eat-me’ stamping in the context of major histocompatibility complex class-I (MHC-I) presentation. Although haplotype-mismatched HSCs can engraft, Vcam1 deletion, in the setting of haplotype mismatch, leads to impaired haematopoietic recovery due to HSC clearance by mononuclear phagocytes. Mechanistically, VCAM1 ‘don’t-eat-me’ activity is regulated by β2-microglobulin MHC presentation on HSCs and paired Ig-like receptor-B (PIR-B) on phagocytes. VCAM1 is also used by cancer cells to escape immune detection as its expression is upregulated in multiple cancers, including acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), where high expression associates with poor prognosis. In AML, VCAM1 promotes disease progression, whereas VCAM1 inhibition or deletion reduces leukaemia burden and extends survival. These results suggest that VCAM1 engagement regulates a critical immune-checkpoint gate in the bone marrow, and offers an alternative strategy to eliminate cancer cells via modulation of the innate immune tolerance. Pinho et al. show that VCAM1 and MHC-I cooperate to provide a ‘don’t-eat-me’ signal that prevents haematopoietic stem cells clearance by mononuclear phagocytes, and also that VCAM1 can be hijacked by cancer cells to escape innate immune surveillance."
https://openalex.org/W4212950915,"Ubiquitin-modified tau aggregates are abundantly found in human brains diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies. Soluble tau oligomers (TauO) are the most neurotoxic tau species that propagate pathology and elicit cognitive deficits, but whether ubiquitination contributes to tau formation and spreading is not fully understood. Here, we observed that K63-linked, but not K48-linked, ubiquitinated TauO accumulated at higher levels in AD brains compared with age-matched controls. Using mass spectrometry analyses, we identified 11 ubiquitinated sites on AD brain-derived TauO (AD TauO). We found that K63-linked TauO are associated with enhanced seeding activity and propagation in human tau-expressing primary neuronal and tau biosensor cells. Additionally, exposure of tau-inducible HEK cells to AD TauO with different ubiquitin linkages (wild type, K48, and K63) resulted in enhanced formation and secretion of K63-linked TauO, which was associated with impaired proteasome and lysosome functions. Multipathway analysis also revealed the involvement of K63-linked TauO in cell survival pathways, which are impaired in AD. Collectively, our study highlights the significance of selective TauO ubiquitination, which could influence tau aggregation, accumulation, and subsequent pathological propagation. The insights gained from this study hold great promise for targeted therapeutic intervention in AD and related tauopathies."
https://openalex.org/W4214531716,"Severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a prevalent and debilitating condition in the United States. and globally. Using pooled efficacy data from six phase 2 trials, therapy using 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) appeared cost-saving from a payer's perspective. This study updates the cost-effectiveness analysis of this novel therapy using data from a new phase 3 trial, including the incremental cost-effectiveness of the more intensive phase 3 regimen compared with the shorter phase 2 regimen.We adapted a previously-published Markov model to portray the costs and health benefits of providing MDMA-assisted therapy (MDMA-AT) to patients with chronic, severe, or extreme PTSD in a recent phase 3 trial, compared with standard care. Inputs were based on trial results and published literature. The trial treated 90 patients with a clinician administered PTSD scale (CAPS-5) total severity score of 35 or greater at baseline, and duration of PTSD symptoms of 6 months or longer. The primary outcome was assessed 8 weeks after the final experimental session. Patients received three 90-minute preparatory psychotherapy sessions, three 8-hour active MDMA or placebo sessions, and nine 90-minute integrative psychotherapy sessions. Our model calculates the per-patient cost of MDMA-AT, net all-cause medical costs, mortality, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). We reported results from the U.S. health care payer's perspective for multiple analytic time horizons, (base-case is 30 years), and conducted extensive sensitivity analyses. Costs and QALYs were discounted by 3% annually. Costs were adjusted to 2020 U.S. dollars according to the medical component of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index (CPI).MDMA-AT as conducted in the phase 3 trial costs $11,537 per patient. Compared to standard of care for 1,000 patients, MDMA-AT generates discounted net health care savings of $132.9 million over 30 years, accruing 4,856 QALYs, and averting 61.4 premature deaths. MDMA-AT breaks even on cost at 3.8 years while delivering 887 QALYs. A third MDMA session generates additional medical savings and health benefits compared with a two-session regimen. Hypothetically assuming no savings in health care costs, MDMA-AT has an ICER of $2,384 per QALY gained.MDMA-AT provided to patients with severe or extreme chronic PTSD is cost-saving from a payer's perspective, while delivering substantial clinical benefit."
https://openalex.org/W4214630262,"Seed priming is regarded as a beneficial and effective method enhancing performance of plants grown under stress conditions. This study illustrated the effect of four seed priming agents (2% H 2 O 2 , 52 mM NaCl, 50 mM KCl, 250 mM MgSO 4 ) on two sorghum cultivars (Canada sorghum CFSH-30 and sorghum ‘1230’) grown in saline soils. Sorghum growth characteristics and biochemical parameters were investigated. Seed priming treatments alleviated the adverse effects of salt stress by decreasing MDA content and enhancing antioxidant enzymes (CAT, POD and SOD) activities and proline content, and hence increased sorghum fresh and dry weight. In terms of various parameters, sorghum ‘1230’ was more suitable to be grown in saline soil, and 52 mM NaCl and 50 mM KCl were the optimum priming agents to improve the performance of salt-stressed sorghum."
https://openalex.org/W4214702298,"Background Obesity is increasing in Sweden and is also of huge global concern. Obesity increases the risk of complications during pregnancy and the need for the induction of labor. Induction of labor increases the number of complications during delivery, leading to women with more negative birth experience. This study investigated how maternal body mass index (BMI) during antenatal care enrollment affects labor outcomes (proportion of cesarean section at induction of labor). Method This was a retrospective cohort study of 3772 women with mixed parity and induction of labor at Soderhospital, Stockholm, in 2009–2010 and 2012–2013. The inclusion criteria were simplex, ≥34 gestational weeks, cephalic presentation and no previous cesarean section. The women were grouped according to BMI, and statistical analyzes were performed to compare the proportion of cesarean sections after induction of labor. The primary outcome was the proportion of cesarean section after induction of labor divided by group of maternal BMI. The secondary outcomes were postpartum hemorrhage &gt;1000 ml, time of labor, fetal outcome data, and indication for emergency cesarean section. Result The induction of labor in women with a high BMI resulted in a significantly increased risk of cesarean section, with 18.4–24.1% of deliveries, depending on the BMI group. This outcome persisted after adjustment in women with BMI 25–29.9 (aOR 1.4; 95% CI; 1.1–1.7) and BMI 30–34.9 (aOR 1.5; 95% CI; 1.1–2.1). There was also a significantly higher risk for CS among primiparous women (aOR 3.6; 95% CI; 2.9–45) and if the newborn weighted ≥ four kilos (aOR 1.6; 95% CI; 1.3–2.0). Conclusion Our findings show that a higher BMI increased the risk of cesarean section after induction of labor in the groups with BMI 25–34.9. Parity seems to be the strongest risk factor for CS regardless other variables."
https://openalex.org/W4213119431,"Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored micronemal antigen (GAMA) is an erythrocyte binding protein known to be involved in malarial parasite invasion. Although anti-GAMA antibodies have been shown to block GAMA attachment to the erythrocyte surface and subsequently inhibit parasite invasion, little is known about the molecular mechanisms by which GAMA promotes the invasion process. In this study, LC-MS analysis was performed on the erythrocyte membrane to identify the specific receptor that interacts with GAMA. We found that ankyrin 1 and the band 3 membrane protein showed affinity for GAMA, and characterization of their binding specificity indicated that both Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax GAMA bound to the same extracellular loop of band 3 (loop 5). In addition, we show the interaction between GAMA and band 3 was sensitive to chymotrypsin. Furthermore, antibodies against band 3 loop 5 were able to reduce the binding activity of GAMA to erythrocytes and inhibit the invasion of P. falciparum merozoites into human erythrocytes, whereas antibodies against P. falciparum GAMA (PfGAMA)-Tr3 only slightly reduced P. falciparum invasion. The identification and characterization of the erythrocyte GAMA receptor is a novel finding that identifies an essential mechanism of parasite invasion of host erythrocytes."

https://openalex.org/W4214548634,"This study aimed to determine the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis (BV) and aerobic vaginitis (AV) and their associated risk factors among pregnant women from Ethiopia. Also, this study investigated the bacterial pathogens and their antibiotic resistance in AV cases. A total of 422 pregnant women from northern Ethiopia were participated in this study. Socio-demographic and clinical data were recorded. Vaginal swabs were collected and used for wet mount and Gram stain methods to evaluate the AV and BV scores according to the Nugent's and Donder's criteria, respectively. In AV cases the bacterial pathogens and their antibiotic resistance were determined using standard methods. The possible risk factors for AV and BV in pregnant women were investigated. The prevalence rates of BV and AV were 20.1% (85/422) and 8.1% (34/422), respectively. BV was more common in symptomatic vs. asymptomatic people (P < 0.001), and in second trimester vs. first trimester samples (P = 0.042). However, AV was more common in secondary school vs. primary and those who were unable to read and write (P = 0.021) and in housewife women vs. employee (P = 0.013). A total of 44 bacterial strains were isolated from AV cases, of which the coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (38.6%) and Staphylococcus aureus (29.5%) were the most predominant bacteria, respectively. The highest resistance rate was observed against penicillin (100.0%) in staphylococci, while 86.7% of them were sensitive to ciprofloxacin. The resistance rate of Enterobacteriaceae ranged from 0.0% for ciprofloxacin and chloramphenicol to 100.0% against amoxicillin/clavulanate. The prevalence of BV was higher than AV in pregnant women. This higher prevalence of BV suggests that measures should be taken to reduce the undesired consequences related to BV in the pregnancy. The circulation of drug-resistant bacteria in vaginal infections requires a global surveillance to reduce the risks to pregnant mothers and infants."

https://openalex.org/W4225666445,"The European honey bee, Apis mellifera L., is the single most valuable managed pollinator in the world. Poor colony health or unusually high colony losses of managed honey bees result from a myriad of stressors, which are more harmful in combination. Climate change is expected to accentuate the effects of these stressors, but the physiological and behavioral responses of honey bees to elevated temperatures while under simultaneous influence of one or more stressors remain largely unknown. Here we test the hypothesis that exposure to acute, sublethal doses of neonicotinoid insecticides reduce thermal tolerance in honey bees. We administered to bees oral doses of imidacloprid and acetamiprid at 1/5, 1/20, and 1/100 of LD 50 and measured their heat tolerance 4 h post-feeding, using both dynamic and static protocols. Contrary to our expectations, acute exposure to sublethal doses of both insecticides resulted in higher thermal tolerance and greater survival rates of bees. Bees that ingested the higher doses of insecticides displayed a critical thermal maximum from 2 ˚C to 5 ˚C greater than that of the control group, and 67%–87% reduction in mortality. Our study suggests a resilience of honey bees to high temperatures when other stressors are present, which is consistent with studies in other insects. We discuss the implications of these results and hypothesize that this compensatory effect is likely due to induction of heat shock proteins by the insecticides, which provides temporary protection from elevated temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W4213202904,"Angiogenic factor AGGF1 (AngioGenic factor with G-patch and FHA (Forkhead-Associated) domain 1) blocks neointimal formation (formation of a new or thickened layer of arterial intima) after vascular injury by regulating phenotypic switching of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). However, the AGGF1 receptor on VSMCs and the underlying molecular mechanisms of its action are unknown. In this study, we used functional analysis of serial AGGF1 deletions to reveal the critical AGGF1 domain involved in VSMC phenotypic switching. This domain was required for VSMC phenotypic switching, proliferation, cell cycle regulation, and migration, as well as the regulation of cell cycle inhibitors cyclin D, p27, and p21. This domain also contains an RDDAPAS motif via which AGGF1 interacts with integrin α7 (ITGA7), but not α8. In addition, we show that AGGF1 enhanced the expression of contractile markers MYH11, α-SMA, and SM22 and inhibited MEK1/2, ERK1/2, and ELK phosphorylation in VSMCs, and that these effects were inhibited by knockdown of ITGA7, but not by knockdown of ITGA8. In vivo, deletion of the VSMC phenotypic switching domain in mice with vascular injury inhibited the functions of AGGF1 in upregulating α-SMA and SM22, inhibiting MEK1/2, ERK1/2, and ELK phosphorylation, in VSMC proliferation, and in blocking neointimal formation. Finally, we show the inhibitory effect of AGGF1 on neointimal formation was blocked by lentivirus-delivered shRNA targeting ITGA7. Our data demonstrate that AGGF1 interacts with its receptor integrin α7 on VSMCs, and this interaction is required for AGGF1 signaling in VSMCs and for attenuation of neointimal formation after vascular injury."
https://openalex.org/W4214595392,"To date, literature has depicted an increase in mortality among patients with hip fractures, directly related to acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and not due to underlying comorbidities. Usual orthogeriatric pathway in our Department was disrupted during the pandemic. This study aimed to evaluate early mortality within 30 days, in 2019 and 2020 in our Level 1 trauma-center. We compared two groups of patients aged >60 years, with osteoporotic upper hip fractures, in February/March/April 2020 and February/March/April 2019, in our level 1 trauma center. A total of 102 and 79 patients met the eligibility criteria in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Mortality was evaluated, merging our database with the French open database for death from the INSEE, which is prospectively updated each month. Causes of death were recorded. Charlson Comorbidity Index was evaluated for comorbidities, Instrumental Activity of Daily Living (IADL), and Activity of Daily Living (ADL) scores were assessed for autonomy. There were no differences in age, sex, fracture type, Charlson Comorbidity Index, IADL, and ADL. 19 patients developed COVID-19 infection. The 30-day survival was 97% (95% CI, 94%-100%) in 2019 and 86% (95% CI, 79%-94%) in 2020 (HR = 5, 95%CI, 1.4-18.2, p = 0.013). In multivariable Cox'PH model, the period (2019/2020) was significantly associated to the 30-day mortality (HR = 6.4, 95%CI, 1.7-23, p = 0.005) and 6-month mortality (HR = 3.4, 95%CI, 1.2-9.2, p = 0.01). COVID infection did not modify significantly the 30-day and 6-month mortality. This series brought new important information, early mortality significantly increased because of underlying disease decompensation. Minimal comprehensive care should be maintained in all circumstances in order to avoid excess of mortality among elderly population with hip fractures."
https://openalex.org/W4214671063,"This study aims to develop artificial intelligence (AI) system to automatically classify patients with maxillary sinus fungal ball (MFB), chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), and healthy controls (HCs).We collected 512 coronal image sets from ostiomeatal unit computed tomography (OMU CT) performed on subjects who visited a single tertiary hospital. These data included 254 MFB, 128 CRS, and 130 HC subjects and were used for training the proposed AI system. The AI system takes these 1024 sets of half CT images as input and classifies these as MFB, CRS, or HC. To optimize the classification performance, we adopted a 3-D convolutional neural network of ResNet 18. We also collected 64 coronal OMU CT image sets for external validation, including 26 MFB, 18 CRS, and 20 HCs from subjects from another referral hospital. Finally, the performance of the developed AI system was compared with that of the otolaryngology resident physicians.Classification performance was evaluated using internal 5-fold cross-validation (818 training and 206 internal validation data) and external validation (128 data). The area under the receiver operating characteristic over the internal 5-fold cross-validation and the external validation was 0.96 ±0.006 and 0.97 ±0.006, respectively. The accuracy of the internal 5-fold cross-validation and the external validation was 87.5 ±2.3% and 88.4 ±3.1%, respectively. As a result of performing a classification test on external validation data from six otolaryngology resident physicians, the accuracy was obtained as 84.6 ±11.3%.This AI system is the first study to classify MFB, CRS, and HC using deep neural networks to the best of our knowledge. The proposed system is fully automatic but performs similarly to or better than otolaryngology resident physicians. Therefore, we believe that in regions where otolaryngology specialists are scarce, the proposed AI will perform sufficiently effective diagnosis on behalf of doctors."

Design Two-arm, randomized, open-label controlled trial comparing SOC alone to SOC plus sarilumab. The trial used a randomized play-the-winner design and was fully embedded within the electronic health record (EHR) system. Setting 5 VA Medical Centers. Participants Hospitalized patients with clinical criteria for moderate to severe COVID-19 but not requiring mechanical ventilation, and a diagnostic test positive for SARS-CoV-2. Interventions Sarilumab, 200 or 400 mg subcutaneous injection. SOC was not pre-specified and could vary over time, e.g., to include antiviral or other anti-inflammatory drugs. Main outcomes and measures The primary outcome was intubation or death within 14 days of randomization. All data were extracted remotely from the EHR. Results Among 162 eligible patients, 53 consented, and 50 were evaluated for the primary endpoint of intubation or death. This occurred in 5/20 and 1/30 of participants in the sarilumab and SOC arms respectively, with the majority occurring in the initial 9 participants (3/4 in the sarilumab and 1/5 in the SOC) before the sarilumab dose was increased to 400 mg and before remdesivir and dexamethasone were widely adopted. After interim review, the unblinded Data Monitoring Committee recommended that the study be stopped due to concern for safety: a high probability that rates of intubation or death were higher with addition of sarilumab to SOC (92.6%), and a very low probability (3.4%) that sarilumab would be found to be superior. Conclusions and relevance This randomized trial of patients hospitalized due to respiratory compromise from COVID-19 but not mechanical ventilation found no benefit from subcutaneous sarilumab when added to an evolving SOC. The numbers of patients and events were too low to allow definitive conclusions to be drawn, but this study contributes valuable information about the role of subcutaneous IL-6R inhibition in the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Methods developed and piloted during this trial will be useful in conducting future studies more efficiently.

Furthermore, comparing the SbCPR2b structure with the well-investigated CPRs from mammals enabled us to identify critical residues of functional importance and suggested that the plant flavin mononucleotide–binding domain might be more flexible than mammalian homologs. In addition, the elucidated structure of SbCPR2b included the first observation of NADP+ in a native CPR.

Cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR), also known as NADPH-dependent cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (Enzyme Commission [EC] number: 1.6.2.4), is a membrane-bound oxidoreductase embedded in the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum (1Phillips A.H.

Since the discovery of CPR, a series of structural and functional studies have been established mainly on rat and human CPR. Generally, the determination of their 3D structures has revealed that CPRs contain three domains: an FMN-binding domain, an FAD-binding and NADP(H)-binding domain, and a connecting (or linker) domain with a flexible hinge region that links these two domains, although other naming conventions exist including one in which the FAD-binding and NADPH-binding domains are considered separate (6Ellis J. Gutierrez A. Barsukov I.L. Huang W.-C. Grossmann J.G. Roberts G.C. Domain motion in cytochrome P450 reductase conformational equilibria revealed by NMR and small-angle X-ray scattering.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 36628-36637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Binding of NADPH initiates the reduction of CPR, which is a rapid and multiphase process, including (1) hydride transfer from NADPH to FAD resulting in the reduced (FADH2, FMN, and NADP+) state; (2) dissociation of the charge–transfer complex between FADH− and NADP+ and interflavin electron transfer from FADH2 to FMN with the formation of the double-semiquinone state (FADH•, FMNH•); and (3) second interflavin electron transfer with partial conversion of the double-semiquinone state to a combination of oxidized FAD with FMN hydroquinone (FAD, FMNH2), which establishes a transient equilibrium between two-electron reduced states. The electron will then be transferred from FMNH2 to cytochrome P450 or other electron acceptor proteins (7Iyanagi T. Mason H. Properties of hepatic reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-cytochrome c reductase.Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 2297-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 8Munro A.W. Noble M.A. Robledo L. Daff S.N. Chapman S.K. Determination of the redox properties of human NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase.Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1956-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). If there is an excess of NADPH, supply of another pair of electrons from NADPH results in either partial or complete reduction of the enzyme to form the reduced (FADH2, FMNH2) state. The crystal structure shows that the FAD and FMN in oxidized rat CPR are oriented such that two isoalloxazine rings are coplanar, with 4 Å between the planes corresponding to Van der Waals contact for optimal interflavin electron transfer, and the FAD is oriented at a proper distance from the NADPH molecule for optimal hydride transfer (8Munro A.W. Noble M.A. Robledo L. Daff S.N. Chapman S.K.

A. 1997; 94: 8411-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). However, this close proximity of FAD and FMN, the so-called locked state or closed conformation, could hinder the interaction between the internally sequestered FMN-binding domain and the target external electron acceptor, which suggests CPR should have a rapid interdomain motion in response to a different redox state. By switching between the closed and open (or extended) states, CPR allows its FMN-binding domain to perform intramolecular and intermolecular electron transfers, one at a time (10Hamdane D. Xia C. Im S.-C. Zhang H. Kim J.-J.P. Waskell L. Structure and function of an NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase in an open conformation capable of reducing cytochrome P450.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 11374-11384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Based on NMR and small-angle X-ray scattering, the radius of gyration of human CPR is estimated as 2.7 and 3.3 nm for the closed and the open form, respectively (11Huang W.-C. Ellis J. Moody P.C. Raven E.L. Roberts G.C. Redox-linked domain movements in the catalytic cycle of cytochrome p450 reductase.Structure. 2013; 21: 1581-1589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). While CPR is still reduced, release of NADP+ shifts the conformational equilibrium toward extended forms capable of electron transfer from FMN to external acceptors (12Frances O. Fatemi F. Pompon D. Guittet E. Sizun C. Pérez J. Lescop E. Truan G. A well-balanced preexisting equilibrium governs electron flux efficiency of a multidomain diflavin reductase.Biophys. J. 2015; 108: 1527-1536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). As in all kingdoms of life, CPRs in plants are required for the activity of endoplasmic reticulum–associated class II cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (hereafter referred to as P450s) that are essential in the synthesis of a wide variety of metabolites, such as flavonoids, terpenoids, alkaloids, and phenylpropanoids (13Mizutani M. Ohta D. Diversification of P450 genes during land plant evolution.Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2010; 61: 291-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In contrast to animals, yeasts, and insects that all have a single CPR gene each, vascular plants contain one to three CPR genes (14Jensen K. Møller B.L. Plant NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductases.Phytochemistry. 2010; 71: 132-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). These CPR paralogs are differentially expressed, likely to meet the reductive demand of various P450-mediated reactions across the wide range of developmental and environmental conditions observed in plants (15Ro D.K. Ehlting J. Douglas C.J. Cloning, functional expression, and subcellular localization of multiple NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductases from hybrid poplar.Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Despite a second gene duplication event within monocots prior to the differentiation of grasses, most grasses still contain one to three CPR paralogs (16Paquette S.M. Jensen K. Bak S. A web-based resource for the Arabidopsis P450, cytochromes b5, NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductases, and family 1 glycosyltransferases (http://www. P450. kvl. dk).Phytochemistry. 2009; 70: 1940-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Eudicots contain both CPR1 and CPR2, which are classified based on their N-terminal sequences, whereas monocots contain only CPR2. The CPR1 of Arabidopsis thaliana (ATR1) is constitutively expressed, but the expression of ATR2 appears to be induced during lignin biosynthesis and in response to wounding or light treatment (17Mizutani M. Ohta D. Two isoforms of NADPH:cytochrome P450 reductase in Arabidopsis thaliana.

Mutation of the inducible Arabidopsis thaliana cytochrome P450 reductase2 alters lignin composition and improves saccharification.Plant Physiol. 2014; 166: 1956-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Despite their diverse and important roles in plants, the level of understanding of plant CPRs lags far behind the human and rat CPRs (19Werck-Reichhart D. Feyereisen R. Cytochromes P450: A success story.Genome Biol. 2000; 1: 3003Crossref Google Scholar). ATR2, one of the two authentic CPRs in the model plant A. thaliana that has been physiologically and kinetically characterized, is the sole structure deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) to date (PDB ID: 5GXU); it is as a complex with both FAD and FMN (20Niu G. Zhao S. Wang L. Dong W. Liu L. He Y. Structure of the Arabidopsis thaliana NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase 2 (ATR2) provides insight into its function.FEBS J. 2017; 284: 754-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In plant monolignol biosynthesis, CPR is required for the hydroxylation steps catalyzed by three class II P450s, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H; EC number: 1.14.13.11; (21Russell D.W. The metabolism of aromatic compounds in higher plants X. Properties of the cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase of pea seedlings and some aspects of its metabolic and developmental control.J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 3870-3878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), p-coumaroyl shikimate/quinate 3′-hydroxylase (C3′H; EC number: 1.14.14.1; (22Schoch G. Goepfert S. Morant M. Hehn A. Meyer D. Ullmann P. Werck-Reichhart D. CYP98A3 from Arabidopsis thaliana is a 3′-hydroxylase of phenolic esters, a missing link in the phenylpropanoid pathway.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36566-36574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar)), and ferulate 5-hydroxylase (F5H; EC number: 1.14.13; (23Meyer K. Shirley A.M. Cusumano J.C. Bell-Lelong D.A. Chapple C. Lignin monomer composition is determined by the expression of a cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenase in Arabidopsis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6619-6623Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar)) (Fig. 1). The hydroxylation reactions catalyzed by these three P450 enzymes give rise to p-coumaric acid, caffeoyl shikimic/quinic acid, and 5-hydroxyconiferaldehyde/5-hydroxyconiferyl alcohol, respectively (Fig. 1). These compounds are precursors for a myriad of organic compounds with agricultural, nutritional, and industrial relevance, such as stilbenes, chalcones, flavonoids, cinnamoyl anthranilates, monolignols, lignans, and lignin (21Russell D.W. The metabolism of aromatic compounds in higher plants X. Properties of the cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase of pea seedlings and some aspects of its metabolic and developmental control.J. Biol.

The first electron from CPR reduces the ferric substrate–bound heme iron of cytochrome P450 into the ferrous form, and the second electron further reduces this oxyferrous cytochrome P450 into the peroxo ferric (Fe3+OO)2− P450; then, a subsequent reaction oxidizes the substrate and yields a water molecule. The CPR is the redox partner enzyme providing electrons to most class II P450s, and thus adaptions to those individual interactions could be necessary for CPR in mammals. In plants, however, where more than one CPR isoform exists, there is a potential for specific interactions between particular P450s and one of the CPR isoforms through adaptation. NADPH reduction of the FAD and NADP+–FADH2 charge–transfer complex formation are significantly faster in plants such as Artemisia annua CPR and A. thaliana CPR2 than in rat CPR. However, the interflavin electron transfer forming disemiquinone state is reported to be slower in plant CPRs than in rat CPRs (27Whitelaw D.A. Tonkin R. Meints C.E. Wolthers K.R. Kinetic analysis of electron flux in cytochrome P450 reductases reveals differences in rate-determining steps in plant and mammalian enzymes.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2015; 584: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). As most P450s depend on CPR for the supply of electrons, detailed knowledge of the mechanisms for CPR–P450 interactions is important for understanding their diversification of multiple P450 and CPR genes and its impact on function. The role of CPRs in lignin deposition is especially significant because this heterogeneous aromatic polymer present in plant secondary cell walls is derived from the monolignol biosynthetic pathway that includes three P450 enzymes. The monolignol biosynthetic pathway results in the production of p-coumaryl, coniferyl, and sinapyl alcohols, which upon radical polymerization in the cell wall form p-hydroxyphenyl (H), guaiacyl (G), and syringyl (S) subunits of lignin, respectively (28Boerjan W. Ralph J. Baucher M. Lignin biosynthesis.Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2003; 54: 519-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (3201) Google Scholar, 29Dixon R.A. Chen F. Guo D. Parvathi K.

Ralph J. Boerjan W. Lignin biosynthesis and structure.Plant Physiol. 2010; 153: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1515) Google Scholar). The S:G ratio in lignin has been shown to influence the efficiency of enzymatic saccharification of cell walls to produce fermentable sugars that can be converted to renewable fuels and chemicals. In dicots, a high S:G ratio appears to favor this conversion (33Mansfield S.D. Kang K.Y. Chapple C. Designed for deconstruction –poplar trees altered in cell wall lignification improve the efficacy of bioethanol production.New Phytol. 2012; 194: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), whereas in grasses, a low S:G ratio appears to be more favorable (34Sattler S.E. Palmer N.A. Saballos A. Greene A.M. Xin Z. Sarath G. Vermerris W. Pedersen J.F.

Thus, in-depth knowledge about the interaction among CPR, C4H, C3′H, and F5H could provide the basis for altering the carbon flux through the monolignol pathway and for modulating both lignin content and its composition. For example, it was demonstrated that a transfer DNA insertion in the AtCPR2 gene resulted in a 6% reduction in the lignin amount in the main inflorescence, a compositional shift of the lignin to a 10-fold higher fraction of H-units at the expense of S-units, and exhibited improved enzymatic saccharification, making CPR a potential target for engineering and valorizing plant cell walls for both biofuels and renewable chemicals (18Sundin L. Vanholme R. Geerinck J. Goeminne G. Höfer R. Kim H. Ralph J. Boerjan W. Mutation of the inducible Arabidopsis thaliana cytochrome P450 reductase2 alters lignin composition and improves saccharification.Plant Physiol. 2014; 166: 1956-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In Arabidopsis, F5H not only needs AtCPR2 but also a specific cytochrome b5 protein (AtCB5D) as the obligatory electron donor for its catalysis, and loss of functional mutations in an AtCB5D and an AtCPR2 gene impairs F5H activities to similar levels in plant extracts (35Gou M. Yang X. Zhao Y. Ran X. Song Y. Liu C.-J. Cytochrome b5 is an obligate electron Shuttle protein for syringyl lignin biosynthesis in Arabidopsis.Plant Cell. 2019; 31: 1344-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Both the mining of genetic variants in native populations of bioenergy crops and direct genetic manipulation of biosynthetic pathways have produced lignin feedstocks with unique properties for coproduct development (36Ragauskas A.J.

Sorghum is being developed as a dedicated bioenergy feedstock in the United States and abroad because it requires less water and nitrogen fertilizer than similar grasses (37Feltus F.A.

Here, we characterize the three SbCPR2 isozymes of sorghum, SbCPR2a, SbCPR2b, and SbCPR2c, including crystal structures and kinetic data, to gain a mechanistic understanding of this key plant P450 reductase and to potentially enable future manipulation of monolignol biosynthesis and lignin content and composition of sorghum. The Sorghum bicolor genome contains three CPR genes, Sobic.002G295100, Sobic.007G088000, and Sobic.006G245400 that encode SbCPR2a, SbCPR2b, and SbCPR2c, respectively (14Jensen K. Møller B.L. Plant NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductases.Phytochemistry. 2010; 71: 132-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Recombinant SbCPR2 proteins containing an N-terminal 6× His tag with and without the native N-terminal hydrophobic membrane–anchoring region (Δ1–50) were produced in Escherichia coli using expression vectors containing complementary DNAs (cDNAs) corresponding to these three genes. The membrane-anchoring region was truncated in order to produce a more soluble form of CPR for structural analyses. In this article, amino acid residue numbering is based on the full-length SbCPR2b for both clarity and consistency. As shown in Figure 2A, where the UV–visible spectra of the oxidized SbCPR2s were shown in blue, they exhibited the main absorbance band at 456 nm with a shoulder at around 480 nm. Together with the absorbance band at 380 nm (Fig. S1), three SbCPR2s displayed a typical absorbance pattern of the flavoproteins (58Vermilion J.L. Coon M.J. Purified liver microsomal NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase. Spectral characterization of oxidation-reduction states.J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2694-2704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further titration with K3Fe(CN)6 did not produce any spectral changes in the 550 to 650 nm region for SbCPR2a and SbCPR2b, confirming that those two SbCPR2s were in a fully oxidized state (59Benveniste I. Gabriac B. Durst F. Purification and characterization of the NADPH-cytochrome P-450 (cytochrome c) reductase from higher-plant microsomal fraction.Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, SbCPR2c displayed a minor absorbance in the same region, which was absent in SbCPR2a or SbCPR2b (Fig. S1). The addition of K3Fe(CN)6 flattened the region, which indicated that purified SbCPR2c contains some flavins in a reduced state in the ambient condition that were further oxidized by this treatment (Fig. S1). This result was consistent with the greenish yellow color of the freshly purified SbCPR2c, whereas the solutions of SbCPR2a and SbCPR2b displayed a yellow color. The addition of NADPH under aerobic conditions caused the color of the SbCPR2 solutions to turn from yellow to green, indicating their flavins were being reduced. To compare the redox behavior for the three SbCPR2s, their anaerobic titrations with NADPH were performed by recording the absorbance spectra in 400 to 750 nm region at increasing NADPH:CPR molar ratio (RNADPH). A series of spectra obtained in the experiment with SbCPR2s and rat CPR are exemplified in Figure 2A. The respective changes in the absorbance at 456, 503, an"

Therefore, this study was conducted with the aim of exploring the patterns of multisectoral collaboration against the COVID-19 using a qualitative case study design. Data were collected by key informant interview and document review and analyzed using a content analysis framework focused on case study data analysis.The study has indicated a unique perspective in establishing functional multisectoral approach with strong courage and motivation of most involved stakeholder. Almost all stakeholders have shown clear understanding about the multidimensional burdens the disease could cause and the necessities for joint efforts to tackle the multidimensional problems. The study further elucidated that despite the encouraging beginning, the eventual slowdown undertakings in the joint actions. This included failure to meet regularly to monitor and evaluate as stated earlier and societies' reluctances despite consistent information dissemination.A firm understanding about multidimensional impacts of COVID-19 by all stakeholders was revealed in the region. Remarkable achievements were observed at the early stage of disease prevention and control responses with encouraging multisectoral approach as guided by the convergence model. However, several setbacks were observed in the process of multisectoral approach intervention as indicated by the conceptual framework. Hence, to ensure sustainable MSA, revitalization of the initial commitment of all stakeholders and strengthening MSA considering end-to end approach of the convergence frame is crucial; subsequent quantitative study recommended to establish wider determinants on success of MSA."
https://openalex.org/W4212774854,"Methotrexate (MTX) is the first-line treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, after long-term treatment, some patients develop resistance. P-glycoprotein (P-gp), as an indispensable drug transporter, is essential for mediating this MTX resistance. In addition, nobiletin (NOB), a naturally occurring polymethoxylated flavonoid, has also been shown to reverse P-gp-mediated MTX resistance in RA groups; however, the precise role of NOB in this process is still unclear. Here, we administered MTX and NOB alone or in combination to collagen II-induced arthritic (CIA) mice and evaluated disease severity using the arthritis index, synovial histopathological changes, immunohistochemistry, and P-gp expression. In addition, we used conventional RNA-seq to identify targets and possible pathways through which NOB reverses MTX-induced drug resistance. We found that NOB in combination with MTX could enhance its performance in synovial tissue and decrease P-gp expression in CIA mice compared to MTX treatment alone. In vitro, in MTX-resistant fibroblast-like synoviocytes from CIA cells (CIA-FLS/MTX), we show that NOB treatment downregulated the PI3K/AKT/HIF-1α pathway, thereby reducing the synthesis of the P-gp protein. In addition, NOB significantly inhibited glycolysis and metabolic activity of CIA-FLS/MTX cells, which could reduce the production of ATP and block P-gp, ultimately decreasing the efflux of MTX and maintaining its anti-RA effects. In conclusion, this study shows that NOB overcomes MTX resistance in CIA-FLS/MTX cells through the PI3K/AKT/HIF-1α pathway, simultaneously influencing metabolic processes and inhibiting P-gp-induced drug efflux."
https://openalex.org/W4212886044,"Voltage-gated sodium channels, NaVs, are responsible for the rapid rise of action potentials in excitable tissues. NaV channel mutations have been implicated in several human genetic diseases, such as hypokalemic periodic paralysis, myotonia, and long-QT and Brugada syndromes. Here, we generated high-affinity anti-NaV nanobodies (Nbs), Nb17 and Nb82, that recognize the NaV1.4 (skeletal muscle) and NaV1.5 (cardiac muscle) channel isoforms. These Nbs were raised in llama (Lama glama) and selected from a phage display library for high affinity to the C-terminal (CT) region of NaV1.4. The Nbs were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and biophysically characterized. Development of high-affinity Nbs specifically targeting a given human NaV isoform has been challenging because they usually show undesired crossreactivity for different NaV isoforms. Our results show, however, that Nb17 and Nb82 recognize the CTNaV1.4 or CTNaV1.5 over other CTNav isoforms. Kinetic experiments by biolayer interferometry determined that Nb17 and Nb82 bind to the CTNaV1.4 and CTNaV1.5 with high affinity (KD ∼ 40-60 nM). In addition, as proof of concept, we show that Nb82 could detect NaV1.4 and NaV1.5 channels in mammalian cells and tissues by Western blot. Furthermore, human embryonic kidney cells expressing holo NaV1.5 channels demonstrated a robust FRET-binding efficiency for Nb17 and Nb82. Our work lays the foundation for developing Nbs as anti-NaV reagents to capture NaVs from cell lysates and as molecular visualization agents for NaVs."
https://openalex.org/W4213008152,"The Absence of bc1 Complex (ABC1) is an ancient, atypical protein kinase family that emerged prior to the archaeal-eubacterial divergence. Loss-of-function mutants in ABC1 genes are linked to respiratory defects in microbes and humans and to compromised photosynthetic performance and stress tolerance in plants. However, demonstration of protein kinase activity remains elusive, hampering their study. Here, we investigate a homolog from Arabidopsis thaliana, AtABC1K6, and demonstrate in vitro autophosphorylation activity, which we replicate with a human ABC1 ortholog. We also show that AtABC1K6 protein kinase activity requires an atypical buffer composition, including Mn2+ as a divalent cation cofactor and a low salt concentration. AtABC1K6 associates with plastoglobule lipid droplets of A. thaliana chloroplasts, along with five paralogs. We show that the protein kinase activity associated with isolated A. thaliana plastoglobules was inhibited at higher salt concentrations, but could accommodate Mg2+ as well as Mn2+, indicating salt sensitivity, but not the requirement for Mn2+, may be a general characteristic of ABC1 proteins. Finally, loss of functional AtABC1K6 impairs the developmental transition from vegetative to reproductive growth. This phenotype was complemented by the wild-type sequence of AtABC1K6, but not by a kinase-dead point mutant in the unique Ala-triad of the ATP-binding pocket, demonstrating the physiological relevance of the protein's kinase activity. We suggest that ABC1s are bona fide protein kinases with a unique regulatory mechanism. Our results open the door to detailed functional and mechanistic studies of ABC1 proteins and plastoglobules."
https://openalex.org/W4214526576,"Background Given the rapid spread of COVID-19 and its associated morbidity and mortality, healthcare providers throughout the world have been forced to constantly update and change their care delivery models. Objective To assess the outcomes of COVID-19 hospitalized patients during the course of the pandemic in a well-integrated health system. Methods The study used data from the electronic health medical records to assess trends in clinical profile and outcomes of hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients hospitalized in our 5-hospital health system from March 2020-May 2021 (n = 6865). Integration of the health system began in February 2020 and was fully actualized by March 30, 2020. Results Mortality decreased from 15% during first peak (March-May 2020; the rate includes 19% in March-April and 10% in May 2020) to 6% in summer-fall 2020, increased to 13% during the second peak (November 2020-January 2021), and dropped to 7% during the decline period (February-May 2021) (p&lt;0.01). Resource utilization followed a similar pattern including a decrease in ICU use from 35% (first peak) to 16% (decline period), mechanical ventilation from 16% (first peak, including 45% in March 2020) to 9–11% in subsequent periods (p&lt;0.01). Independent predictors of inpatient mortality across multiple study periods included older age, male sex, higher multi-morbidity scores, morbid obesity, and indicators of severe illness on admission such as oxygen saturation ≤90% and high qSOFA score (all p&lt;0.05). However, admission during the first peak remained independently associated with increased mortality even after adjustment for patient-related factors: odds ratio = 1.8 (1.4–2.4) (p&lt;0.0001). Conclusions The creation of a fully integrated health system allowed us to dynamically respond to the everchanging COVID-19 landscape. In this context, despite the increasing patient acuity, our mortality and resource utilization rates have improved during the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4214717676,"Deep demersal fisheries in Indonesia yielded close to 90,000 metric tons of snapper and grouper in 2019, landed by a fleet of approximately 10,000 fishing boats. Prior to the present study, information on these multi-species, dispersed, small- to medium-scale fisheries was scarce, while reliable species-specific data on catch and effort were non-existent. This data-deficiency made stock assessments and design of harvest control rules impossible. We developed a new data collection method, the Crew Operated Data Recording System (CODRS), to collect verifiable species- and length-composition data from catches across all segments of the fleet. CODRS engaged crews of 579 fishing vessels to take pictures of each fish in their catch, in combination with the deployment of a tracking device on their boats. Furthermore, we also conducted a frame survey to map the fleet across the entire Indonesian archipelago. Using more than 2 million CODRS images, we aimed to understand the basic characteristics and challenges within the fishery. We updated life-history parameters for the top 50 species in the fishery based on the maximum observed length-frequency distribution of the catch (i.e., asymptotic length, size at maturity, optimum fishing length, total mortality, and spawning potential ratio). Length-based stock assessments using the updated life-history parameters showed high risks of overfishing for most of the major target species, especially for snapper species with large maximum sizes. Our results indicated that effective management and harvest strategies are urgently needed across Indonesia's eleven Fishery Management Areas to prevent the collapse of these important fisheries."
https://openalex.org/W4214745554,"Longstanding cross-linguistic work on event representations in spoken languages have argued for a robust mapping between an event’s underlying representation and its syntactic encoding, such that–for example–the agent of an event is most frequently mapped to subject position. In the same vein, sign languages have long been claimed to construct signs that visually represent their meaning, i.e., signs that are iconic. Experimental research on linguistic parameters such as plurality and aspect has recently shown some of them to be visually universal in sign, i.e. recognized by non-signers as well as signers, and have identified specific visual cues that achieve this mapping. However, little is known about what makes action representations in sign language iconic, or whether and how the mapping of underlying event representations to syntactic encoding is visually apparent in the form of a verb sign. To this end, we asked what visual cues non-signers may use in evaluating transitivity (i.e., the number of entities involved in an action). To do this, we correlated non-signer judgments about transitivity of verb signs from American Sign Language (ASL) with phonological characteristics of these signs. We found that non-signers did not accurately guess the transitivity of the signs, but that non-signer transitivity judgments can nevertheless be predicted from the signs’ visual characteristics. Further, non-signers cue in on just those features that code event representations across sign languages, despite interpreting them differently. This suggests the existence of visual biases that underlie detection of linguistic categories, such as transitivity, which may uncouple from underlying conceptual representations over time in mature sign languages due to lexicalization processes."

A system is presented consisting of a mobile trailer (35 m3) along with several Dielectric barrier discharge sources installed for generating a plasma ROS level to achieve viral decontamination. The plasma ROS treated respirators were evaluated at the CDC NPPTL, and additional PPE specimens and material functionality testing were performed at Texas A&M. The effects of decontamination on the performance of respirators were tested using a modified version of the NIOSH Standard Test Procedure TEB-APR-STP-0059 to determine particulate filtration efficiency. The treated Prestige Ameritech and BYD brand N95 respirators show filtration efficiencies greater than 95% and maintain their integrity. The overall mechanical and functionality tests for plasma ROS treated PPE show no significant variations."
https://openalex.org/W4225911856,"Toxoplasma gondii has numerous, large, paralogous gene families that are likely critical for supporting its unparalleled host range: nearly any nucleated cell in almost any warm-blooded animal. The SRS (SAG1-related sequence) gene family encodes over 100 proteins, the most abundant of which are thought to be involved in parasite attachment and, based on their stage-specific expression, evading the host immune response. For most SRS proteins, however, little is understood about their function and expression profile. Single-parasite RNA-sequencing previously demonstrated that across an entire population of lab-grown tachyzoites, transcripts for over 70 SRS genes were detected in at least one parasite. In any one parasite, however, transcripts for an average of only 7 SRS genes were detected, two of which, SAG1 and SAG2A, were extremely abundant and detected in virtually all. These data do not address whether this pattern of sporadic SRS gene expression is consistently inherited among the progeny of a given parasite or arises independently of lineage. We hypothesized that if SRS expression signatures are stably inherited by progeny, subclones isolated from a cloned parent would be more alike in their expression signatures than they are to the offspring of another clone. In this report, we compare transcriptomes of clonally derived parasites to determine the degree to which expression of the SRS family is stably inherited in individual parasites. Our data indicate that in RH tachyzoites, SRS genes are variably expressed even between parasite samples subcloned from the same parent within approximately 10 parasite divisions (72 hours). This suggests that the pattern of sporadically expressed SRS genes is highly variable and not driven by inheritance mechanisms, at least under our conditions."
https://openalex.org/W4213444840,"Cyclin D1 is a regulatory subunit of -Cyclin Dependent Kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) and regulates progression from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle. Dysregulated cyclin D1-CDK4/6 contributes to abnormal cell proliferation and tumor development. Phosphorylation of threonine 286 of cyclin D1 is necessary for ubiquitin-dependent degradation. Non-phosphorylatable cyclin D1 mutants are stabilized and concentrated in the nucleus, contributing to genomic instability and tumor development. Studies investigating the tumor-promoting functions of cyclin D1 mutants have focused on the use of artificial promoters to drive the expression which unfortunately may not accurately reflect tumorigenic functions of mutant cyclin D1 in cancer development. We have generated a conditional knock-in mouse model where cyclin D1T286A is expressed under the control of its endogenous promoter following Cre-dependent excision of a lox-stop-lox sequence. Acute expression of cyclin D1T286A following tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase triggers inflammation, lymphocyte abnormality and ultimately mesenteric tumors in the intestine. Tissue-specific expression of cyclin D1T286A in the uterus and endometrium cooperates with Pten loss to drive endometrial hyperplasia and cancer. Mechanistically, cyclin D1T286A mutant activates NF-κB signaling, augments inflammation, and contributes to tumor development. These results indicate that mutation of cyclin D1 at threonine 286 has a critical role in regulating inflammation and tumor development."

Local administration of proteasome inhibitor enhances bone fracture healing by accelerating endochondral ossification. However, if a short-term administration of proteasome inhibitor enhances fracture repair and potential mechanisms involved have yet to be exploited. We hypothesize that injury activates the ubiquitin/proteasome system in callus, leading to elevated protein ubiquitination and degradation, decreased MPCs, and impaired fracture healing, which can be prevented by a short-term of proteasome inhibition. We used a tibial fracture model in Nestin-GFP reporter mice, in which a subgroup of MPCs are labeled by Nestin-GFP, to test our hypothesis. We found increased expression of ubiquitin E3 ligases and ubiquitinated proteins in callus tissues at the early phase of fracture repair. Proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib, given soon after fracture, enhanced fracture repair, which is accompanied by increased callus Nestin-GFP+ cells and their proliferation, and the expression of osteoblast-associated genes and Runx2 and JunB proteins. Thus, early treatment of fractures with Bortezomib could enhance the fracture repair by increasing the number and proliferation of MPCs."

https://openalex.org/W4213346855,"Enzyme filamentation is a widespread phenomenon that mediates enzyme regulation and function. For the filament-forming sequence-specific DNA endonuclease SgrAI, the process of filamentation both accelerates its DNA cleavage activity and expands its DNA sequence specificity, thus allowing for many additional DNA sequences to be rapidly cleaved. Both outcomes-the acceleration of DNA cleavage and the expansion of sequence specificity-are proposed to regulate critical processes in bacterial innate immunity. However, the mechanistic bases underlying these events remain unclear. Herein, we describe two new structures of the SgrAI enzyme that shed light on its catalytic function. First, we present the cryo-EM structure of filamentous SgrAI bound to intact primary site DNA and Ca2+ resolved to ∼2.5 Å within the catalytic center, which represents the trapped enzyme-DNA complex prior to the DNA cleavage reaction. This structure reveals important conformational changes that contribute to the catalytic mechanism and the binding of a second divalent cation in the enzyme active site, which is expected to contribute to increased DNA cleavage activity of SgrAI in the filamentous state. Second, we present an X-ray crystal structure of DNA-free (apo) SgrAI resolved to 2.0 Å resolution, which reveals a disordered loop involved in DNA recognition. Collectively, these multiple new observations clarify the mechanism of expansion of DNA sequence specificity of SgrAI, including the indirect readout of sequence-dependent DNA structure, changes in protein-DNA interactions, and the disorder-to-order transition of a crucial DNA recognition element."

One indicator selected to measure progress towards achievement is the participation rate of youth in education (SDG 4.3.1). Here we aim to understand drivers of school attendance using one country in East Africa as an example.Nationally representative household survey data (2015-16 Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey) were used to explore individual, household and contextual factors associated with secondary school attendance in Tanzania. These included, age, head of household's levels of education, gender, household wealth index and total number of children under five. Contextual factors such as average pupil to qualified teacher ratio and geographic access to school were also tested at cluster level. A two-level random intercept logistic regression model was used in exploring association of these factors with attendance in a multi-level framework.Age of household head, educational attainments of either of the head of the household or parent, child characteristics such as gender, were important predictors of secondary school attendance. Being in a richer household and with fewer siblings of lower age (under the age of 5) were associated with increased odds of attendance (OR = 0.91, CI 95%: 0.86; 0.96). Contextual factors were less likely to be associated with secondary school attendance.Individual and household level factors are likely to impact secondary school attendance rates more compared to contextual factors, suggesting an increased focus of interventions at these levels is needed. Future studies should explore the impact of interventions targeting these levels. Policies should ideally promote gender equality in accessing secondary school as well as support those families where the dependency ratio is high. Strategies to reduce poverty will also increase the likelihood of attending school."

Hundreds of further alternative splice variants (SVs) of AARS have been discovered in humans and mice, most of which disrupt the coding sequence of the essential and conserved aminoacylation domains (20Lo W.S.

Human cytoplasmic leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LARS) is a large multidomain AARS with a crucial moonlighting role as an intracellular leucine sensor (21Han J.M. Jeong S.J. Park M.C. Kim G. Kwon N.H.

While leucine sensing does not require catalysis (23Lee M. Kim J.H. Yoon I. Lee C. Sichani M.F. Kang J.S. Kang J. Guo M. Lee K.Y. Han G. Kim S. Han J.M.

Kim K. et al.Glucose-dependent control of leucine metabolism by leucyl-tRNA synthetase 1.Science. 2020; 367: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). No mechanism is currently known for separately regulating either the canonical enzymatic or alternative cell signaling functions of LARS without influencing the other. Multiple alternative splicing events occur on LARS mRNA in humans (20Lo W.S. Gardiner E. Xu Z. Lau C.F. Wang F. Zhou J.J. Mendlein J.D. Nangle L.A. Chiang K.P. Yang X.L. Au K.F. Wong W.H. Guo M. Zhang M. Schimmel P. Human tRNA synthetase catalytic nulls with diverse functions.Science. 2014; 345: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that these may lead to SV isoforms that selectively disrupt either the catalytic or leucine sensing roles of LARS, creating functionally specialized proteins for use in specific cellular contexts. Therefore, we set out to identify alternatively spliced LARS transcripts with promise for novel biology. Previous reports showed that immunological tissues contain a large number of AARS SVs (20Lo W.S. Gardiner E. Xu Z. Lau C.F. Wang F. Zhou J.J. Mendlein J.D. Nangle L.A. Chiang K.P. Yang X.L. Au K.F.

A new γ-interferon-inducible promoter and splice variants of an anti-angiogenic human tRNA synthetase.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 719-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), led us to target primary leukocytes as a diverse and promising tissue source from which to discover LARS splice variants (LSVs) via deep sequencing. The full-length LARS mRNA is comprised of 33 coding exons across 3.9 kb. To comprehensively identify alternative splicing events across the long and complex LARS transcript, we employed a strategy that included Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) sequencing. The PacBio approach generates exceptionally long reads (up to 15 kb), allowing for detection of multiple nonadjacent alternative splicing events on the same transcript. The depth of sequencing also allows for detection of especially rare isoforms (25Gonzalez-Garay M.L. Wu J. Introduction to Isoform Sequencing Using Pacific Biosciences Technology (Iso-seq) BT - Transcriptomics and Gene Regulation. Springer Netherlands, Dordrecht2016: 141-160Google Scholar). A LARS gene-specific cDNA library was constructed from leukocyte polyA+ RNA (Takara Biosciences). Sequencing via PacBio of these LARS mRNAs in leukocytes resulted in approximately 11,000 sequencing reads with an average length of 2.7 kb (Fig. S1A). Alignment of high-quality reads with the LARS reference mRNA revealed several distinct exon skipping events (Fig. 1A). The extensive length of the PacBio reads allowed us to conclude that exon skipping events did not co-occur with any other alternative splicing features on the same transcripts (Fig. S1B). These six LARS transcript isoforms were thus denoted LSV 1 to 6 (Fig. 1B). The LSV1-3 and LSV5 isoforms have been previously reported (P. Schimmel, personal communication) (20Lo W.S. Gardiner E. Xu Z. Lau C.F. Wang F. Zhou J.J. Mendlein J.D. Nangle L.A. Chiang K.P. Yang X.L. Au K.F. Wong W.H. Guo M. Zhang M. Schimmel P. Human tRNA synthetase catalytic nulls with diverse functions.Science. 2014; 345: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), while LSV4 and LSV6 are newly discovered. Strikingly, LSV3, which skips exon 20, dominated the alternative splicing landscape of LARS in leukocytes, representing over 20% of reads in the PacBio dataset (Fig. 1B). Because of its relatively high expression, we wondered if LSV3 was present in other biological contexts. We used PCR to amplify cDNA from a spectrum of human tissues with primers flanking a 721 bp portion of the LARS gene transcript surrounding exon 20 and separated the products by electrophoresis. In leukocytes, we detected not only the full-length LARS transcript, but also a 508 bp product that would correspond to a spliced transcript that skips the 213 bp exon 20 (Fig. 1C). A second ∼690 bp band detected in leukocytes did not match any known LSVs from our PacBio dataset or exon sizes in this region. Quantification of the LSV3 band in leukocytes reflected 22% exon 20 skipping, in excellent agreement with the PacBio sequencing results described above. Exon 20 skipping was also detected at low levels (5% or less) in most human immune tissues that we tested, including the spleen and thymus (Fig. 1C). The only exceptions were tissues originating from immature immune progenitor cells, such as the bone marrow and fetal liver. In contrast, no LSV3 was detected in major nonimmune tissues such as the heart, brain, liver, and muscle (Fig. 1D). The only nonimmune system tissue that showed a small amount of exon 20 skipping was the lung. We hypothesized that this might be due to the presence of alveolar macrophages or other resident immune cells, which are abundant in the lung. These data collectively suggest that LSV3 is a highly leukocyte-specific alternative SV of LARS. Human LARS is a large protein, comprised of 1176 amino acids with multiple distinct functional domains. These include the class I AARS Rossmann fold catalytic domain (26Cusack S. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. The 2 Å crystal structure of leucyl-tRNA synthetase and its complex with a leucyl-adenylate analogue.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2351-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) containing the canonical aminoacylation active site, the dedicated tRNA editing domain (CP1; (27Mursinna R.S. Martinis S.A. Rational design to block amino acid editing of a tRNA synthetase.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 7286-7287Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar)), so-called anticodon binding (ABD) and variable C-terminus (VC) domains, which are involved in tRNA binding (28Liu R.J. Long T. Li H. Zhao J. Li J. Wang M. Palencia A. Lin J. Cusack S. Wang E.D. Molecular basis of the multifaceted functions of human leucyl-tRNA synthetase in protein synthesis and beyond.Nucleic Acids Res. 2020; 48: 4946-4959Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), and the UNE-L domain, which binds LARS to a multisynthetase complex (MSC) (29Ling C. Yao Y.N. Zheng Y.G. Wei H. Wang L. Wu X.F. Wang E.D.

Chem. 2005; 280: 34755-34763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Deletion of exon 20 does not disrupt the reading frame of LARS, but does eliminate 71 amino acids in the catalytic domain. This portion of the LARS sequence is well conserved and contains a number of residues, which are invariant across a wide selection of eukaryotes and even archaea (Fig. 2A). Mapping these residues onto the structure of human LARS (28Liu R.J. Long T. Li H. Zhao J. Li J. Wang M. Palencia A. Lin J. Cusack S. Wang E.D. Molecular basis of the multifaceted functions of human leucyl-tRNA synthetase in protein synthesis and beyond.Nucleic Acids Res. 2020; 48: 4946-4959Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B) shows that they include an α-helix and β-strand in the Rossman fold catalytic core, as well as a helix-turn-helix in the variable leucine-specific domain 2 (LSD2), the function of which is unknown. The amino acids flanking the deletion are about 30 Å apart in the structure. Several of the most conserved residues in exon 20 likely participate in ATP binding and activation during intermediate steps of catalysis (28Liu R.J. Long T. Li H. Zhao J. Li J. Wang M. Palencia A. Lin J. Cusack S. Wang E.D. Molecular basis of the multifaceted functions of human leucyl-tRNA synthetase in protein synthesis and beyond.Nucleic Acids Res. 2020; 48: 4946-4959Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C, bold). Furthermore, it is possible that tRNA binding would be disrupted by this deletion, as the LARS catalytic domain interacts with the tRNA acceptor stem (30Palencia A. Crépin T. Vu M.T. Lincecum T.L. Martinis S.A. Cusack S. Structural dynamics of the aminoacylation and proofreading functional cycle of bacterial leucyl-tRNA synthetase.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Therefore, we would predict that LSV3 is catalytically inactive. We recombinantly expressed LSV3 fused to an N-terminal six-histidine tag in E. coli. The His-tagged protein was isolated via nickel-affinity chromatography as soluble protein (Fig. S2A). As would be expected from the primary sequence, we found that LSV3 did not aminoacylate crude tRNA with leucine (Fig. 2D) under conditions in which recombinant full-length human LARS was active. We also determined that the LSV3 protein could not activate leucine to form an adenylate in the first step of aminoacylation (Figs. 2E and S2B). Thus, deletion of exon 20 clearly disrupts the aminoacylation catalytic activity of the LARS housekeeping protein. In addition to its essential function in tRNA leucylation, human LARS serves as an intracellular leucine sensor for the mTOR pathway (21Han J.M. Jeong S.J. Park M.C. Kim G. Kwon N.H. Kim H.K. Ha S.H.

Leucyl-tRNA synthetase is an intracellular leucine sensor for the mTORC1-signaling pathway.Cell. 2012; 149: 410-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar) which controls many aspects of cell growth. In this capacity, LARS binds leucine using the same site as in catalysis and undergoes a conformational change that enhances its interaction with RagD GTPase (31Kim S. Yoon I. Son J. Park J. Kim K. Lee J.-H. Park S.-Y. Kang B.S. Han J.M. Hwang K.Y. Kim S. Leucine-sensing mechanism of leucyl-tRNA synthetase 1 for mTORC1 activation.Cell Rep. 2021; 35: 109031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Through a largely undefined mechanism, LARS facilitates the bound RagD to perform GTP hydrolysis to GDP (23Lee M. Kim J.H. Yoon I. Lee C. Sichani M.F. Kang J.S. Kang J. Guo M. Lee K.Y. Han G. Kim S. Han J.M. Coordination of the leucine-sensing Rag GTPase cycle by leucyl-tRNA synthetase in the mTORC1 signaling pathway.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2018; 115: E5279-E5288Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This GDP-RagD then promotes mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) kinase activity and downstream signaling (32Sancak Y. Peterson T. Shaul Y. Linquist R. Thoreen C. Bar-Peled L. Sabatini D. The Rag GTPases bind raptor and mediate amino acid signaling to mTORC1.Science. 2008; 320: 1496-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1852) Google Scholar). LARS also binds to and activates Vps34 lipid kinase, which positively signals to mTORC1 through an orthogonal pathway (22Yoon M.S. Son K. Arauz E. Han J.M. Kim S. Chen J. Leucyl-tRNA synthetase activates Vps34 in amino acid-sensing mTORC1 signaling.Cell Rep. 2016; 16: 1510-1517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Despite removal of a portion of the catalytic domain for aminoacylation, LSV3 retains key features in the primary sequence that are important for mTOR signaling, including the conserved leucine-binding site and RagD-binding peptide (21Han J.M. Jeong S.J. Park M.C. Kim G. Kwon N.H. Kim H.K. Ha S.H. Ryu S.H. Kim S.

Interestingly, exon 20 is contained within the large region identified for Vps34 binding (22Yoon M.S. Son K. Arauz E. Han J.M. Kim S. Chen J. Leucyl-tRNA synthetase activates Vps34 in amino acid-sensing mTORC1 signaling.Cell Rep. 2016; 16: 1510-1517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The presence of the idiosyncratic UNE-L domain also suggests that LSV3 would retain binding to the MSC that is comprised of eight AARS and three nonsynthetase proteins (29Ling C. Yao Y.N. Zheng Y.G. Wei H. Wang L. Wu X.F. Wang E.D. The C-terminal appended domain of human cytosolic leucyl-tRNA synthetase is indispensable in its interaction with arginyl-tRNA synthetase in the multi-tRNA synthetase complex.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34755-34763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To investigate LSV3’s protein–protein interactions, we modified a vector encoding an N-terminal FLAG epitope tag-fused LARS gene to delete bases for exon 20 and expressed the recombinant protein (FLAG-LSV3) in HEK 293T cells. Coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) using the FLAG tag showed that, similar to LARS, LSV3 interacts with isoleucyl- and glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetases (IARS and EPRS, Fig. 3B), supporting that this SV is indeed a part of the MSC. We also found that LSV3 interacts with the PHD1 oxygen sensor, a reported regulator of LARS protein stability (33D’Hulst G. Soro-Arnaiz I. Masschelein E. Veys K. Fitzgerald G. Smeuninx B. Kim S. Deldicque L. Blaauw B. Carmeliet P. Breen L. Koivunen P. Zhao S.M. Bock K. De De Bock K. PHD1 controls muscle mTORC1 in a hydroxylation-independent manner by stabilizing leucyl tRNA synthetase.Nat. Commun. 2020; 11: 174Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) (Fig. S3A). Interestingly, co-IP demonstrated that LSV3 maintains interactions with downstream mTORC1 signaling partners. As expected from the presence of the C-terminal RagD-binding site in the SV sequence (Fig. 3B), LSV3 interacts with the mTOR signaling partner RagD GTPase. More surprisingly, co-IP using FLAG-LSV3 also pulled down Myc-Vps34 (Fig. 3B bottom panel). This is despite apparent disruption to the previously identified Vps34 binding site (22Yoon M.S. Son K. Arauz E. Han J.M. Kim S. Chen J. Leucyl-tRNA synthetase activates Vps34 in amino acid-sensing mTORC1 signaling.Cell Rep. 2016; 16: 1510-1517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). Reciprocal IP of the Myc-Vps34 confirmed the interaction between Vps34 and LSV3 (Fig. S3B). While the residues deleted in the LSV3 SV are within the known Vps34-binding site, this region was identified using a 360 amino acid fragment of LARS (22Yoon M.S. Son K. Arauz E. Han J.M. Kim S.

Thus, our results with this SV suggest that the location of the Vps34-binding site can be further narrowed to the protein surface on the LARS catalytic and CP1 domains that are formed by residues 360 to 625 (Fig. S3C). Previous work has established that leucine sensing by LARS is distinct from, and does not require, its tRNA leucylation activity (21Han J.M. Jeong S.J. Park M.C. Kim G. Kwon N.H. Kim H.K. Ha S.H.

In this study, eggshells from Phlebotomus stantoni Newstead, Sergentomyia khawi (Raynal), and Grassomyia indica (Theodor) sand flies collected in Chiang Mai province, Thailand were examined and characterized using light microscopy (LM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Then, eggshell morphology of these three species was described for the first time. Each gravid female was forced to lay eggs by decapitation and the eggs were collected for SEM analysis. Egg laying females were identified by morphological examination and molecular typing using cytochrome b (Cytb) as a molecular marker. The chorionic sculpturing of Ph. stantoni eggs combines two patterns on the same egg: unconnected parallel ridges and reticular patterns. Sergentomyia khawi and Gr. indica have similar chorionic polygonal patterns, but their exochorionic morphology and aeropylar area are different. Results indicate that eggshell morphological characteristics such as chorionic pattern, exochorionic morphology, inter-ridge/boundary area, aeropylar area (including the number of aeropyles) and basal layer, can be useful to develop morphological identification keys of eggs. These can serve as an additional tool to distinguish species of sand flies. In addition, the chorionic sculpturing of the eggs of the three species of sand flies observed by LM is useful for species identification in gravid females with spermathecae obscured by eggs."

One proposed benefit of fellowship training is decrease in complications, however, few studies have investigated the rates of medical and surgical complications for hip fracture patients between orthopedists from different fellowship backgrounds. This study aims to investigate the effect of fellowship training and case volume on medical and surgical outcomes of patient following hip fracture surgical intervention.1999-2016 American Board of Orthopedic Surgery (ABOS) Part II Examination Case List data were used to assess patients treated by trauma or adult reconstruction fellowship-trained orthopedists versus all-other orthopaedists. Rates of surgeon-reported medical and surgical adverse events were compared between the three surgeon cohorts. Using binary multivariate logistic regression to control of demographic factors, independent factors were evaluated for their effect on surgical complications.Data from 73,427 patients were assessed. An increasing number of hip fractures are being treated by trauma fellowship trained surgeons (9.43% in 1999-2004 to 60.92% in 2011-2016). In multivariate analysis, there was no significant difference in type of fellowship, however, surgeons with increased case volume saw significantly decreased odds of complications (16-30 cases: OR = 0.91; 95% CI: 0.85-0.97; p = 0.003; 31+ cases: OR = 0.68; 95% CI: 0.61-0.76; p<0.001). Femoral neck hip fractures were associated with increased odds of surgical complications.Despite minor differences in incidence of surgical complications between different fellowship trained orthopaedists, there is no major difference in overall risk of surgical complications for hip fracture patients based on fellowship status of early orthopaedic surgeons. However, case volume does significantly decrease the risk of surgical complications among these patients and may stand as a proxy for fellowship training. Fellows required to take hip fracture call as part of their training regardless of fellowship status exhibited decreased complication risk for hip fracture patients, thus highlighting the importance of additional training."
https://openalex.org/W4214609876,"The decarbonization of the electricity sector is leading to a substantial increase in the demand for wind energy. Will tribal nations, which account for 7.8% of utility-scale wind capacity, benefit from this policy shift? To examine why tribal nations vary in translating wind energy potential into wind installed capacity, we have constructed an original dataset of the potential as well as the location of wind turbines across tribal nations. Our statistical analysis of 286 tribal nations suggests that wind energy potential is not associated with wind installed capacity. Instead, casino square footage, a proxy for tribal nation’s administrative capacity and business acumen, is associated with wind installed capacity. Political orientation plays a role as well: tribal nations are more likely to have wind installed capacity when they value tribal sovereignty. While tribes suffering from natural disasters do not install more wind turbines, those receiving federal grants for wind energy projects, and located in states that already have a substantial number of wind turbines, are more apt to have wind turbines. Surprisingly, tribes located in states with renewable portfolio standards do not show an association with installed wind turbines capacity."
https://openalex.org/W4214640849,"Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction is common in patients with aortic valve stenosis (AS) and reportedly affects prognosis after surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). Here we investigated whether and how diastolic function (assessed following the most recent guidelines) was affected by SAVR, and whether preoperative diastolic function affected postoperative outcome. We also examined whether long-term mortality was associated with preoperative NT-proBNP and postoperative heart failure (PHF).We performed a prospective observational study of 273 patients with AS who underwent AVR with or without concomitant coronary artery bypass surgery. Of these patients, 247 were eligible for assessment of left ventricular (LV) filling pressure. Preoperatively and at the 6-month postoperative follow-up, we measured N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in serum and assessed diastolic function with Doppler echocardiography. PHF was diagnosed using prespecified criteria. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to explore variables associated with high LV filling pressure. Cox regression was performed to explore variables associated with mortality, accounting for timeto-event.At the time of surgery, 22% (n = 54) of patients had diastolic dysfunction expressed as high LV filling pressure. Of these 54 patients, 27 (50%) showed postoperative diastolic function improvement. Among the 193 patients with preoperative low LV filling pressure, 24 (12%) showed postoperative diastolic function deterioration. Increased long-term mortality was associated with PHF and high preoperative NT-proBNP, but not with preoperative or postoperative diastolic dysfunction. Cox regression revealed the following independent risk factors for long-term mortality: diabetes, renal dysfunction, preoperative NT-proBNP>960 ng/L, age, and male gender.Surgery for aortic stenosis improved diastolic function in patients with high LV filling pressure in 50% of the patients. Our results could not confirm the previously suggested role of diastolic dysfunction as a marker for poor long-term survival after SAVR. Our findings showed that both PHF and high preoperative NT-proBNP were associated with long-term mortality."
https://openalex.org/W4214690664,"Are humans instinctively good or is it only our capacity for reflection that enables us to restrain our selfish traits and behave prosocially? Against the background of dual-process theory, the question of whether people tend to behave prosocially on intuitive grounds has been debated controversially for several years. Central to this debate is the so-called social heuristic hypothesis (SHH), which states that subjects orient their behavior more closely to their deeply ingrained norms and attitudes when the behavior comes about in an intuitive rather than reflective manner. In this paper, we apply the SHH to a novel setting and investigate whether its implications hold true in a non-reactive field experiment, in which subjects are unaware that they are part of a study. We test whether subjects report a misdirected email or try to use the opportunity to reap a monetary benefit. Since all subjects participated six months prior to the field experiment in a lab experiment, we have solid measures of the subjects' general tendency to behave intuitively and their prosocial attitudes. In addition, participants were asked in a follow-up survey to self-report their intuitiveness at the time of the decision. While we observe a significant and positive effect on prosocial behavior for self-reported intuitiveness (but not for general intuitiveness) in the bivariate analyses, this effect becomes insignificant when controlling for interaction effects with attitudes. In addition, for both forms of intuitiveness, we find a significant and positive interaction effect with subjects' prosocial attitudes on prosocial behavior. Hence, this study confirms previous findings from laboratory as well as online studies and provides external validity by demonstrating that the SHH applies in a real-life situation."
https://openalex.org/W4214738905,"Gonorrhea caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae is the second most prevalent curable sexually transmitted infection worldwide. Female Sex Workers (FSWs) are at a higher risk of contracting gonorrhea due to their risky sexual behaviors like inconsistent condom use and multiple sexual partners. We determined the prevalence and risk factors associated with gonorrhea and its antimicrobial susceptibility pattern among symptomatic FSWs attending Sexual Workers Outreach Program (SWOP) city clinic in Nairobi, Kenya.Using convenience sampling, we recruited 379 female sex workers from SWOP City clinic in Nairobi County. We administered a semi-structured questionnaire to collect data on socio-demographics and behavioral risk factors associated with gonorrhea. We also conducted three focus groups. Two endocervical swabs were collected from each participant by the attending physician for the laboratory identification of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. An antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed using the disc diffusion method.Twenty-four out of 379 (6.3%) participants tested positive for gonorrhea by PCR. The significant risk factors associated with gonorrhea were having multiple sexual partners in the previous two weeks, primary education, and being in the age group of 38-49 years (p < 0.05). From the qualitative data, sex work disclosure, and difficulty in engaging protected sex with their partner, and unprotected sex with their clients due to more money from the client, PREP, and alcohol use made the female sex workers vulnerable to gonorrhea exposure and or risky sexual behavior. The culture-positive sample result yielded complete (100%) resistance to all the antimicrobials used.Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection is prevalent among symptomatic FSWs in Nairobi. Multiple sexual partners, being in age group 38-49 years and having primary education were the factors associated with gonorrhea among the study participants. Based on our identification of a highly resistant isolate, we strongly recommend increasing capacity for culture-based diagnosis and susceptibility testing."
https://openalex.org/W4214743050,"Fetal growth restriction (FGR) is associated with adverse perinatal outcomes. Pre-eclampsia (PreE) increases the associated perinatal morbidity and mortality. The structure of the umbilical cord in the setting of FGR and PreE is understudied. This study aimed to examine changes in the umbilical cord (UC) composition in pregnancies complicated by FGR and FGR with PreE. UC from gestational age-matched pregnancies with isolated FGR (n = 5), FGR+PreE (n = 5) and controls (n = 5) were collected, and a portion of the UC was processed for histologic and proteomic analysis. Manual segmentation analysis was performed to measure cross-section analysis of umbilical cord regions. Wharton's Jelly samples were analyzed on a tims-TOF Pro. Spectral count and ion abundance data were analyzed, creating an intersection dataset from multiple mass spectrometry search and inference engines. UCs from FGR and FGR with PreE had lower cross-sectional area and Wharton's Jelly area compared with control (p = 0.03). When comparing FGR to control, 28 proteins were significantly different in abundance analysis and 34 in spectral count analysis (p < 0.05). Differential expression analysis between PreE with FGR vs controls demonstrated that 48 proteins were significantly different in abundance and 5 in spectral count. The majority of changes occurred in proteins associated with extracellular matrix, cellular process, inflammatory, and angiogenesis pathways. The structure and composition of the UC is altered in pregnancies with FGR and FGR with PreE. Future work in validating these proteomic differences will enable identification of therapeutic targets for FGR and FGR with PreE."

https://openalex.org/W4214672444,"Microdroplet arrays (MDAs) are powerful tools for digital immunoassays, high-throughput screening and single cell analysis. However, MDAs are usually produced with cleanroom processes, which are associated with high costs and low availability. Furthermore, in order to obtain robust and stable MDAs based on hydrophilic spots surrounded by a hydrophobic background, the chemistry must be strictly controlled, which is challenging using shared equipment. Here, we developed a new method to fabricate MDA substrates independently from the cleanroom. A small and low-cost in-house built system to collimate the light source was assembled for photopatterning a negative resist, and spots with diameters down to 4 μm were obtained, with only 3% to 5% spot-to-spot variation across the same sample and high batch-to-batch reproducibility. The use of a negative photoresist enabled the formation of a hydrophobic coating in solution which yielded high-quality MDAs. The feasibility for carrying out digital assays was demonstrated by measuring anti-Tau antibody in sample buffers containing bovine serum albumin, with no noticeable surface fouling. The reported, robust, cost-effective, and fast process could hence lower the threshold to fabricate and use MDAs for digital immunoassays and other microcompartmentalization-based applications."
https://openalex.org/W4225890143,"The mutualism between the thioautotrophic bacterial ectosymbiont Candidatus Thiobius zoothamnicola and the giant ciliate Zoothamnium niveum thrives in a variety of shallow-water marine environments with highly fluctuating sulfide emissions. To persist over time, both partners must reproduce and ensure the transmission of symbionts before the sulfide stops, which enables carbon fixation of the symbiont and nourishment of the host. We experimentally investigated the response of this mutualism to depletion of sulfide. We found that colonies released some initially present but also newly produced macrozooids until death, but in fewer numbers than when exposed to sulfide. The symbionts on the colonies proliferated less without sulfide, and became larger and more rod-shaped than symbionts from freshly collected colonies that were exposed to sulfide and oxygen. The symbiotic monolayer was severely disturbed by growth of other microbes and loss of symbionts. We conclude that the response of both partners to the termination of sulfide emission was remarkably quick. The development and the release of swarmers continued until host died and thus this behavior contributed to the continuation of the association."
