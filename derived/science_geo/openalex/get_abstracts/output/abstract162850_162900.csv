https://openalex.org/W1980891354,"The p53 protein activates promoters containing p53 binding sites, and it represses other promoters. We examined the effect of p53 on bcl-2 expression in both the DHL-4 B cell line and the K562 erythroleukemia line. Transient transfection analyses revealed that wild-type p53 repressed the bcl-2 full-length promoter. The region of the bcl-2 promoter that was responsive to p53 was mapped to the bcl-2 P2 minimal promoter region, and we showed that p53 and the TATA binding protein bound to the bcl-2 TATA sequence. The TATA binding protein, p53, histone deacetylase-1 and mSin3a could be co-immunoprecipitated from K562 cell nuclear extract. The TATA binding protein and mSin3a could be recovered in a complex at the bcl-2 promoter TATA sequence, however, the formation of this complex was not dependent on the presence of p53. Treatment of K562 cells with the histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A, resulted in an increase in bcl-2 promoter activity whether p53 was present or not. Therefore, we demonstrated that p53 and the histone deacetylases repress the bcl-2 promoter independently. Similar results were obtained when endogenous bcl-2 mRNA or protein levels were measured in response to either p53 or trichostatin A, and p53 expression resulted in enhanced apoptosis. RNase protection assays demonstrated that transcription from the endogenous 3' bcl-2 promoter was decreased by p53. The regions of p53 that were required for repression of the bcl-2 promoter were defined. We conclude that the TATA sequence in the bcl-2 P2 minimal promoter is the target for repression by p53, and that the interaction between p53 and TBP is most likely responsible for the repression. Mutation of p53 may play a role in the up-regulation of bcl-2 expression in some B cell lymphomas."

https://openalex.org/W2093224647,"Pdcd4 is a novel transformation suppressor that is highly expressed in promotion-resistant (P-) mouse epidermal JB6 cells but not in susceptible (P+) cells. Overexpression of pdcd4 cDNA in stably transfected P+ cells rendered cells resistant to tumor promoter-induced transformation, indicating that elevated expression of Pdcd4 protein is sufficient to suppress neoplastic transformation. To determine whether Pdcd4 suppresses neoplastic transformation through inhibiting known transformation required events, we examined the possibility that pdcd4 inhibited the activation of AP-1 or NF-kappaB dependent transcription or of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity. Activation of AP-1-dependent transcriptional activity was inhibited by pdcd4 expression in a concentration dependent manner. In contrast, Pdcd4 slightly increased NF-kappaB-dependent transcription and did not alter ODC enzymatic activity. Previous studies suggested that activation of AP-1 was required for P+ cell transformation as well as for tumor promotion in vivo. These results indicate that Pdcd4 functions as a transformation suppressor, possibly through inhibiting AP-1 activation in combination with other factors such as enhancing NF-kappaB activation. Pdcd4 may thus constitute a useful molecular target for cancer prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2316273706,"p53 regulates the transcription of a number of genes among which are different redox-related genes. It has been proposed that these genes can induce a cellular oxidative stress leading to p53-dependent apoptosis (Polyak et al., 1997). MnSOD, the product of superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) gene, is one of the major cellular defences against oxidative stress. We demonstrate here that p53 is able to repress SOD2 gene expression and that this repression takes place at promoter level. We show the importance of this regulation for the p53 function, by demonstrating that an overexpression of MnSOD decreases p53-mediated induction of apoptosis. Moreover, we demonstrate that MnSOD overexpression decreases p53-gene expression at the promoter level. These findings raise the hypothesis that p53 and SOD2 genes are mutually regulated leading to the modulation of various cellular processes including apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2002855877,"Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand-receptor 1 (TRAIL-R1) and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand-receptor 2 (TRAIL-R2) are cell-surface receptors involved in tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced cell-death signaling. TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 genes have recently been mapped to chromosome 8p21-22, which is a frequent site of allelic deletions in many types of human tumors, including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Because TRAIL/TRAIL receptor system plays an important role in lymphocyte homeostasis, we hypothesized that the mutations of TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 may be involved in the development of NHL and that such mutations may be responsible for the allelic losses of 8p21-22 in NHL. In this study, we analysed the entire coding region of TRAIL-R2 gene and the death domain region of TRAIL-R1 gene for the detection of the somatic mutations in a series of 117 human NHLs using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. Overall, eight tumors (6.8%) were found to have two TRAIL-R1 gene mutations or six TRAIL-R2 gene mutations. Interestingly, of the eight mutations, six missense mutations (two TRAIL-R1 and four TRAIL-R2) were detected in the death domains and one nonsense mutation of TRAIL-R2 was detected just before the death domain. Our data suggest that somatic mutations of TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 genes may play a role in the pathogenesis of some NHLs and that TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 genes might be the relevant genes to the frequent loss of chromosome 8p21-22 in human NHL."
https://openalex.org/W2008037959,"Overexpression of the membrane mucin MUC4/Sialomucin complex (SMC) has been observed during malignant progression of mammary tumors in both humans and rats, suggesting that deregulation of MUC4/SMC expression might facilitate development of these malignancies. As previously reported, overexpression of SMC results in suppression of both cell adhesion and immune killing of tumor cells. SMC also acts as a ligand for ErbB2/Neu, modulating phosphorylation of the receptor tyrosine kinase in the presence and absence of heregulin. The present studies investigated the effect of Muc4/SMC up-regulation on primary tumor growth using a tetracycline-inducible SMC expression system in a xenotransplanted tumor model. SMC up-regulation provoked rapid growth of transfected A375 melanoma in nude mice. Up-regulation of SMC, however, did not significantly increase proliferation of A375 cells in vitro. Instead, a strong suppression of apoptosis was observed in situ in SMC-overexpressing tumors. These data suggest that Muc4/SMC expression promotes tumor growth in vivo at least in part via suppression of tumor cell apoptosis. Importantly, reduction of apoptosis was also observed in vitro, indicating that anti-apoptotic effect of SMC is independent of tumor-host interactions. These findings strongly suggest that SMC up-regulation alters intracellular signaling to favor cell survival, providing for the first time evidence for the regulation of programmed cell death by a gene of the MUC family."
https://openalex.org/W2321473488,"The high prevalence and great diversity of p53 tumor suppressor gene mutations in human tumors call for development of therapeutic molecules that rescue function of aberrant p53 protein. P53 mutations also offer new approaches to the study of the origins of mutations in human cancer. An experimental mouse model with a genetically modified but normal functioning p53 gene harboring the human rather than the murine core domain, would be of considerable benefit to research on both cancer therapeutics and etiology; however, it is uncertain whether such mice would permit biological functions of p53 to be retained. Using a Cre/lox P gene-targeting approach, we have constructed a human p53 knock-in (hupki) mouse strain in which exons 4-9 of the endogenous mouse p53 allele were replaced with the homologous, normal human p53 gene sequence. The chimeric p53 allele (p53(KI)) is properly spliced, transcribed in various tissues at levels equivalent to wild-type mice, and yields cDNA with the anticipated sequence, that is, with a core domain matching that of humans. The hupki p53 protein binds to p53 consensus sequences in gel mobility shift assays and accumulates in the nucleus of hupki fibroblasts in response to UV irradiation, as is characteristic of wild-type p53. Induction of various p53-regulated genes in spleen of gamma-irradiated homozygous hupki mice (p53(KI/KI)), and the kinetics of p53-dependent apoptosis in thymocytes are similar to results with wild-type (p53(+/+)) mice, further indicating normal p53 pathway function in the hupki strain. The mice are phenotypically normal and do not develop spontaneous tumors at an early age, in contrast to knock-out (p53(-/-)) strains with a defective p53 gene. The chimeric (p53(KI)) allele thus appears to provide a biological equivalent to the endogenous murine (p53(+)) gene. This strain is a unique tool for examining in vivo spontaneous and induced mutations in human p53 gene sequences for comparison with published human tumor p53 mutation spectra. In addition, the hupki strain paves the way for mouse models in pre-clinical testing of pharmaceuticals designed to modulate DNA-binding activity of human p53."
https://openalex.org/W575605346,"p73 has recently been identified as a structural and functional homolog of the tumor suppressor protein p53. Overexpression of p53 activates transcription of p53 effector genes, causes growth inhibition and induced apoptosis. We describe here the effects of a tumor-derived truncated transcript of p73alpha (p73Deltaexon2) on p53 function and on cell death. This transcript, which lacks the acidic N-terminus corresponding to the transactivation domain of p53, was initially detected in a neuroblastoma cell line. Overexpression of p73Deltaexon2 partially protects lymphoblastoid cells against apoptosis induced by anti-Fas antibody or cisplatin. By cotransfecting p73Deltaexon2 with wild-type p53 in the p53 null line Saos 2, we found that this truncated transcript reduces the ability of wild-type p53 to promote apoptosis. This anti-apoptotic effect was also observed when p73Deltaexon2 was co-transfected with full-length p73 (p73alpha). This was further substantiated by suppression of p53 transactivation of the effector gene p21/Waf1 in p73Deltaexon2 transfected cells and by inhibition of expression of a reporter gene under the control of the p53 promoter. Thus, this truncated form of p73 can act as a dominant-negative agent towards transactivation by p53 and p73alpha, highlighting the potential implications of these findings for p53 signaling pathway. Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of a p73Deltaexon2 transcript in a very significant proportion (46%) of breast cancer cell lines. However, a large spectrum of normal and malignant tissues need to be surveyed to determine whether this transdominant p73 variant occurs in a tumor-specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W1989465030,"The monocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (MOZ) gene is rearranged in t(8;16)(p11;p13), t(8;22)(p11;q13) and inv(8)(p11q13) associated with acute myeloid leukemia. The other fusion partners involved are CBP, p300 and TIF2, transcriptional coactivators with known or potential histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity. MOZ itself is a 2004-residue protein containing a putative acetyl CoA-binding motif, so it was hypothesized that MOZ is a HAT. Here we present direct evidence that MOZ has intrinsic HAT activity. Moreover, MOZ possesses a transcriptional repression domain at its N-terminal part and an activation domain at its C-terminal part. The activation domain does not show sequence similarity to any yeast proteins, but when tethered, it is able to activate transcription in yeast. Therefore, MOZ is a HAT with characteristics of a transcriptional coregulator, supporting the hypothesis that aberrant acetylation by abnormal MOZ proteins leads to leukemogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1990794205,"The aberrant transcription factors associated with many human malignancies function by deregulation of tumorigenic pathways. However, identification of these pathways has come slowly. Virtually all cases of Ewing's Sarcoma and peripheral Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumor (PNET) are associated with aberrant transcription factors which fuse amino-terminal EWS with the DNA binding moiety of an ETS transcription factor (FLI-1 in 90% of cases). Attempts to identify the downstream targets of these chimeras in the Ewing Family Tumors (EFT) on the basis of differential gene regulation have produced little association with tumor biology. As an alternative approach, we have used highly efficient retroviral systems to biologically screen cDNA derived from cells transformed by EWS/FLI-1. We have identified the recently described PDGF-C as target of EWS/ETS transcriptional deregulation. This transcriptional deregulation is specific to EWS/FLI. PDGF-C possesses substantial biologic activity in vitro and in vivo. It is expressed in EFT cell lines and in primary tumors. Within these EFT cell lines, PDGF-C expression is dependent upon EWS/FLI activity. These results suggest that PDGF-C may be a significant mediator of EWS/FLI driven oncogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2078928513,"One of the main functions of the tumor suppressor p53 is the induction of programmed cell death. Here we investigated in detail the molecular mechanisms that underlay p53 transactivation-dependent apoptosis in the human colon cancer cell line DLD-1. Although p53 upregulated the death receptors Fas, TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 in this cell line, p53-induced cell death occurred without detectable caspase-8 activation whereas, activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 was readily observed. In addition to the upregulation of death receptors, p53 induced the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bik and Bak and downregulated the anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL protein. Moreover, in RNase protection assay analyses as well as in reporter gene analyses we found a p53-dependent upregulation of the death receptor-inhibitory protein cFLIP. Together, these data argue for a p53-mediated activation of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. In contrast to recently published data obtained in different cellular systems, there was no evidence for an essential role of NF-kappaB in p53-induced cell death. Moreover, induction of p53 interfered with TNF-induced NF-kappaB activation independently from apoptosis-induction."
https://openalex.org/W1963797629,"Aggressive fibromatosis is a locally invasive soft tissue lesion. Seventy-five per cent of cases harbor a somatic mutation in either the APC or β-catenin genes, resulting in β-catenin protein stabilization. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is an enzyme involved in prostaglandin synthesis that modulates the formation of colonic neoplasia, especially in cases due to mutations resulting in β-catenin stabilization. Human aggressive fibromatoses and lesions from the Apc+/Apc1638N mouse (a murine model for Apc-driven fibromatosis) demonstrated elevated COX-2 levels. COX-2 blockade either by the selective agent DFU or by non-selective COX blocking agents results in reduced proliferation in human tumor cell cultures. Breeding mice with Cox-2−/− mice resulted in no difference in number of aggressive fibromatoses formed, but in a smaller tumor size, while there was a decrease in number of GI lesions by 50%. Mice fed various COX blocking agents also showed a decline in tumor size. COX-2 expression was regulated by tcf-dependent transcription in this lesion. COX-2 partially regulates proliferation due to β-catenin stabilization in aggressive fibromatosis. Although COX blockade alone does not cause tumor regression, this data suggests that it may have a role as an adjuvant therapy to slow tumor growth in this lesion."
https://openalex.org/W2024204178,"Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is an essential protein in both DNA replication and DNA damage repair. A novel 15 kD protein, p15(PAF), was identified as a PCNA-associated factor in a yeast two-hybrid screen using PCNA as the bait. p15(PAF) is localized primarily in the nucleus. p15(PAF) shares the conserved PCNA binding motif with several other PCNA binding proteins including CDK inhibitor p21. Overexpression of p15(PAF) competes with p21-PCNA binding. Mutation of this motif in p15(PAF) abolished its PCNA-binding activity. Notably, p15(PAF) expression in several types of tumor tissues was significantly increased, especially in esophageal tumors. Like PCNA, p15(PAF) may possess prognostic significance in a broad array of human cancers."

https://openalex.org/W2312798674,"The tumor suppressor p53 is an inducer of cell cycle arrest and programmed cell death (apoptosis). The ability of p53 to induce cell cycle arrest is linked to its ability to induce transcription of genes such as the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21. However, the dependence of p53-mediated apoptosis on transcriptional activation remains controversial. Ectopic expression of a temperature-sensitive (ts) p53 allele induced expression of p53 target genes and elicited both G1 and G2/M cell cycle arrest upon shift to the permissive temperature. Ectopic expression of the same ts p53 allele with two additional point mutations (Gln22, Ser23) that abolish p53-transcriptional activation did not induce p53 target genes and G1 nor G2/M cell cycle arrest. In HCT116 colon carcinoma cells ectopic expression of wild type p53 does not elicit apoptosis whereas p53 mutant deficient in trans-activation induces apoptosis. The ability of wild type p53 to induce apoptosis is restored in HCT116 cells that are null for p21. However, the trans-activation deficient mutant of p53 is still more potent mediator of apoptosis than wild type p53 in the p21 null cells. Although the ability of Gln22,Ser23 to trans-activate p53 target genes is diminished, it retains the ability to repress Bcl-2 expression. Thus, we conclude that while ectopic expression of wild type p53 can induce both G1 and G2/M arrest, in a p21 dependent manner, without apoptosis, a p53 mutant defective in trans-activation elicits apoptosis without inducing cell cycle arrest. Further, the anti-apoptotic function of p53 is dependent on trans-activation and is linked to cell cycle arrest. The results strongly suggest that the trans-activation deficient mutant is a more potent inducer of apoptosis because it lost its anti-apoptotic function and retains its ability to repress pro-apoptotic genes such as Bcl-2. Taken together, the results imply that employing a trans-activation deficient p53 in gene therapy approaches or the use of drugs that convert mutant p53 to a trans-activation-independent mediator of apoptosis may be much more efficient therapeutic approaches than current approaches that employ wild type p53."

https://openalex.org/W2068602250,"LNCaP cells are human prostatic cancer cells that have a frame-shift mutation of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN and do not express the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), a major substrate of the type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR). Ectopic expression of IRS-1 in LNCaP cells increases cell adhesion and decreases cell motility by an IGF-I-independent mechanism. We show now that these effects of IRS-1 are accompanied by serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and are inhibited by inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). We have confirmed the requirement for PI3K activity and serine phosphorylation by the use of IRS-1 mutants, expressed in LNCaP cells. Serine phosphorylation inhibits IGF-I-induced tyrosyl phosphorylation of IRS-1, which is restored by the expression of wild-type PTEN or by inhibition of PI3K activity. Finally, IRS-1 in LNCaP cells co-immunoprecipitates with integrin alpha 5 beta 1, and the association is again IGF-I-independent. We conclude that in LNCaP cells, IRS-1 is serine phosphorylated by PI3K, generating effects that are different, and even opposite, from those generated by IGF-I."
https://openalex.org/W2325787473,"p53 is involved in several DNA repair pathways. Some of these require the specific transactivation of p53-dependent genes and others involve direct interactions between the p53 protein and DNA repair associated proteins. Previously, we have shown that p53 acts directly in Base Excision Repair (BER) when assayed under in vitro conditions. Our present data indicate that this involvement is independent of the transcriptional activity of the p53 molecule. We found that under both in vitro and in vivo conditions, a p53 transactivation-deficient molecule, p53-22-23 was more efficient in BER activity than was wild type p53. However, mutations in the core domain or C-terminal alterations strongly reduced p53-mediated BER activity. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the involvement of p53 in BER activity, a housekeeping DNA repair pathway, is a prompt and immediate one that does not involve the activation of p53 transactivation-dependent mechanisms, but rather concerns with the p53 protein itself. In an endogenous DNA damage status p53 is active in BER pathways as a protein and not as a transcription factor."

https://openalex.org/W2088305164,"Cells from patients with the genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation and radiomimetic agents, both of which generate reactive oxygen species capable of causing oxidative damage to DNA and other macromolecules. We describe in A-T cells constitutive activation of pathways that normally respond to genotoxic stress. Basal levels of p53 and p21(WAF1/CIP1), phosphorylation on serine 15 of p53, and the Tyr15-phosphorylated form of cdc2 are chronically elevated in these cells. Treatment of A-T cells with the antioxidant alpha-lipoic acid significantly reduced the levels of these proteins, pointing to the involvement of reactive oxygen species in their chronic activation. These findings suggest that the absence of functional ATM results in a mild but continuous state of oxidative stress, which could account for several features of the pleiotropic phenotype of A-T."
https://openalex.org/W2324248655,"The double stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), in addition to its role as a translational controlling factor, is a key transcriptional regulator exerting antiviral and antitumoral activities. We have previously shown that induction of NF-κB by PKR is involved in apoptosis commitment and this process is mediated through activation of the IKK complex. To gain insights into the mechanism of activation of NF-κB by PKR, we have analysed the domains of PKR involved in IKK activation and subsequent NF-κB induction. In PKR0/0 cells infected with a collection of vaccinia virus (VV) recombinants expressing different mutant forms of PKR, we found that only PKR forms conserving the catalytic activity are able to activate NF-κB. An inactive PKR mutant (K296R), was unable to induce NF-κB activation despite full expression of the protein in a wide range of concentrations, as defined by Western blot, EMSA, IKK kinase activity and NF-κB transactivation assays. Moreover, the mutant PKR (K296R) acts as a dominant negative of PKR-induced eIF-2α phosphorylation and NF-κB activation. However, PKR mutants unable to activate NF-κB still retain their ability to associate with the IKK complex, as confirmed by immunoprecipitation analysis. We conclude that the catalytic activity of PKR and not only a protein-protein interaction with the IKK complex, is needed for activation of the transcription factor NF-κB."

https://openalex.org/W2323701068,"Changes in promoter specificity and binding affinity that may be associated with p53 mutations or post-translational modifications are useful in understanding p53 structure/function relationships and categorizing tumor mutations. We have exploited variable expression of human p53 in yeast to identify mutants with novel phenotypes that would correspond to altered promoter selectivity and affinity. The p53 cDNA regions coding for the DNA binding and tetramerization domains were subjected to random PCR mutagenesis and were cloned directly by recombination in yeast into a vector with a GAL1 promoter whose level of expression could be easily varied. p53 variants exhibiting higher than wild type levels of transactivation (supertrans) for the RGC responsive element were identified at low level of p53 protein expression. All the p53 mutants obtained with this screen were located in the DNA binding domain. Two out of 17 supertrans mutants have been found in tumors. Six mutations were in the L1 loop region between amino acids 115 and 124. The transactivation potential of a panel of supertrans p53 mutants on different promoters was evaluated using the p53 responsive elements, RGC, PIG3, p21 and bax. Although all mutants retained some activity with all promoters, we found different patterns of induction based on strength and promoter specificity. In particular none of the mutants was supertrans for the p21 responsive element. Interestingly, further analysis in yeast showed that the transactivation function could be retained even in the presence of dominant-negative p53 tumor mutations that could inhibit wild type p53. Five mutants were also characterized in human cells in terms of growth suppression and transactivation of various promoters. These novel supertrans p53 mutants may be useful in studies aimed at dissecting p53 downstream pathways, understanding specific interactions between p53 and the DNA, and could replace wild type p53 in cancer gene therapy protocols. The approach may also prove useful in identifying p53 tumor mutations."

To identify such genes we have analysed the gene expression in a myelomonocytic chicken cell line that carries an estrogen inducible version of v-Myb by differential display. Here we describe the identification of the chicken homolog of the mouse Pdcd4 gene as a novel v-Myb target gene.

https://openalex.org/W2028945951,"Checkpoint mechanism plays a crucial role in ensuring genomic integrity during cell cycle. Loss of checkpoint function is known to induce genomic instability and to alter ploidy of dividing cells. In this study, we examined mechanisms of hyperploid formation in glioma cells by treatment with nocodazole, which activates spindle assembly checkpoint by inhibiting microtubule polymerization. By prolonged nocodazole treatment, U251MG human glioma cell, which has a p53 mutation, underwent transient arrest at mitosis, and subsequently exited from mitotic arrest (termed 'mitotic slippage') followed by DNA replication without cytokinesis, resulting in hyperploid formation. Additionally, the heterogeneity in the number of centrosomes per cell increased during the hyperploid formation, suggesting that these hyperploid cells have genomic instability. By employing LN382 glioma cell that has a temperature-sensitive p53 mutation, we found that the activation of p53 prevents hyperploid formation after the prolonged nocodazole treatment. Furthermore, staurosporine, an inhibitor for a broad range of serine/threonine kinases including cdc2, was found to enhance hyperploid formation in U251MG cells by accelerating the induction of mitotic slippage. Interestingly, inhibitors specific for cdc2 kinase prevented the G2 to M transition but did not accelerate mitotic slippage, suggesting that staurosporine-sensitive kinases other than cdc2 are required for maintenance of spindle assembly checkpoint. Moreover, the enhancement of hyperploid formation by staurosporine was also blocked by p53-dependent G1 checkpoint. These results suggest that abrogation of G1 checkpoint is a critical factor for formation of hyperploid cells after the mitotic slippage."
https://openalex.org/W2325599805,"CEACAM1 (also known as biliary glycoprotein, C-CAM or CD66a) is a cell adhesion molecule of the immunoglobulin family behaving as a tumor inhibitory protein in colon, prostate, liver, endometrial and breast cancers. Inhibition of tumor development is dependent upon the presence of the long 71–73 amino acid cytoplasmic domain of the CEACAM1 protein (CEACAM1-L). We have recently defined a number of cis-acting motifs within the long cytoplasmic domain participating in tumor cell growth inhibition. These are Tyr488, corresponding to an Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Inhibition Motif, as well as the three terminal lysine residues of the protein. In this study, we provide evidence that treatment with phorbol esters leads to increased phosphorylation of in vivo 32P-labeled CEACAM1-L in mouse CT51 carcinoma cells, in the mouse 1MEA 7R.1 liver carcinoma cells and in 293 human embryonic kidney cells transfected with the Ceacam1-L cDNA. Basal level Ser phosphorylation was abrogated by treatment with the staurosporine inhibitor, but not by the protein kinase C-specific inhibitor calphostin C or other inhibitors such as H7 or sphingosine. Specific inhibitors of protein kinase A or calmodulin kinase had only minimal effects on the levels of basal or PMA-induced Ser phosphorylation. Furthermore, PMA treatment of the CT51 cells induced cell spreading and cellular relocalization of the CEACAM1-L protein. Since Ser503 has been described as a PMA-induced phosphorylation site in other cell systems, we investigated whether Ser503 was involved in these responses in mouse intestinal cells. No differences were noticed in the basal or the PMA-induced phosphorylation levels, kinase inhibitor sensitivity or the PMA-induced relocalization of the protein between the wild-type and the Ser503Ala mutant CEACAM1-L. However, we provide evidence that Ser503 participates in CEACAM1-L-mediated tumor inhibition as its mutation to an Ala led to in vivo tumor development, contrary to the tumor inhibitory phenotype observed with the wild-type CEACAM1-L protein."

https://openalex.org/W2324774713,"Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is associated with heavy smoking and drinking, but the molecular pathway of tumorigenesis is not understood. Inactivation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene is likely to play an important role since p53 mutation is frequently found. The p14ARF tumor suppressor gene is functionally linked to p53, because it is activated by oncogenes and causes p53-dependent growth arrest and apoptosis. The relationship between p14ARF and p53 inactivation has not been described for OSCC. We studied 25 cases of OSCC to determine if there is an inverse correlation between p53 mutation and p14ARF inactivation by homozygous deletion or mutation. p53 mutation was found in 16 of 25 cases (64%), including nine missense and seven truncating mutations. While all cases with missense mutations showed abnormal accumulation of p53 protein, there were also five carcinomas which showed increased p53 staining in the absence of mutation. p14ARF deletion or mutation was found in eight cases (32%), six of which also demonstrated p53 mutation. Our findings indicate that OSCC often involves loss of both p14ARF and p53 function and suggest that inactivation of these two tumor suppressor genes are not functionally equivalent during tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2334511001,"Procaspase-2 is one of the cysteine aspartate proteases involved in apoptotic cell death. Alternative splicing of CASP-2 messenger RNA generates a long isoform, procaspase-2L, whose overexpression induces cell death and a truncated isoform, procaspase-2S, whose function remains poorly defined. The present study explored the consequences of procaspase-2S overexpression in U937 human leukemic cells exposed to the topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide as an apoptotic stimulus. Overexpression of procaspase-2S in U937 cells partially prevented nuclear changes associated with etoposide-induced cell death, as determined by Hoechst 33342 staining of nuclear chromatin and electron microscopy studies. Procaspase-2S also prevented the maturation of apoptotic bodies, delayed phosphatidylserine externalization on the plasma membrane and prevented the cleavage and activation of procaspase-2L. These effects were not observed when the cysteine 289 in the consensus QACRG motif was mutated into a serine. Wild-type procaspase-2S overexpression did not influence the cleavage of procaspase-3, procaspase-7 and poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase nor the fragmentation of nuclear DNA into nucleosome-sized fragments. Altogether, these results indicate that the short isoform of procaspase-2 negatively interferes with selective features of apoptosis, an activity that is suppressed by mutation of the cysteine 289."
https://openalex.org/W2330308119,"Mutations in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes are associated with increased genomic instability and susceptibility to cancer. Mice rendered deficient in either Mlh1 or Pms2 as a result of gene targeting are prone to tumorigenesis, particularly, lymphomas. In addition, although Mlh1−/− mice also develop small intestinal adenomas and adenocarcinomas, Pms2−/− animals remain free of such tumors. To establish whether this phenotypic dichotomy might be associated with a quantitative and/or qualitative difference in genomic instability in these mice, we determined small intestinal epithelial cell DNA mutant frequency and mutation spectrum using a transgenic λ-phage lacI reporter system. Mutant frequencies obtained from both Mlh1−/− and Pms2−/− mice revealed elevations of 18- and 13-fold, respectively, as compared to their wild-type littermates. Interestingly, we found that C : G→T : A transitions were significantly elevated in Mlh1−/− mice, accounting in large measure for the 1.5-fold lacI mutant frequency increase seen in these animals. We hypothesize that the increased level of C : G→T : A mutations may explain, in part, why Mlh1−/− mice, but not Pms2−/− mice, develop small intestinal tumors. Furthermore, the difference in the lacI mutational spectrum of Mlh1−/− and Pms2−/− mice suggests that other MutL-like heterodimers may play important roles in the repair of G : T mispairs arising within murine small intestinal epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2001737628,"The overexpression of SPRR1B in bronchial epithelium is a marker for early metaplastic changes and the loss of its expression is associated with an irreversible malignant transformation. In the present study, we have used a model system consisting of normal and malignant bronchial epithelial (BE) cells to elucidate the differential transcriptional control of SPRR1B. SPRR1B expression is either detectable or PMA (phorbol 13-myristate 12-acetate) -inducible in several malignant BE cells including squamous, adeno, small and large cell carcinomas. Loss of SPRR1B expression is correlated well with the lack of strong in vivo protein-DNA interactions at the −152 bp promoter, which contains two functional TRE sites. Even though the basal level AP-1 protein DNA binding pattern is different between normal and malignant cells, PMA significantly enhances Jun and Fos binding to the consensus TRE site in both cell types. Intriguingly, the composition of AP-1 protein binding to the −152 to −86 bp SPRR1B promoter is quite different. In untreated cells, SPRR1B promoter is predominantly occupied by JunD and Fra2. PMA significantly induced binding of JunB and Fra1 in normal cells, while JunB and Fra2 bound to TREs in the malignant cells. Overexpression of fra1 in malignant cells significantly enhanced SPRR1B promoter activity. In contrast, overexpression of fra2, but not fra1, strongly reduced both basal and PMA-inducible promoter activities in normal cells. Together, these results indicate that either temporal expression and/or differential activation of AP-1 proteins, especially Fra1 and Fra2, might contribute to the dysregulation of terminal differentiation marker, SPRR1B, expression in various BE cells."

https://openalex.org/W1985237344,"Viral interferon regulatory factor (vIRF) encoded by Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) inhibits the expression of interferon-responsive genes, causes cellular transformation and transactivates KSHV genes. In the present study, we characterized the mRNA expression pattern of the vIRF gene and its promoter. A vIRF transcript of 1.7 kb in size was detected in low level in uninduced KSHV-infected cells and its expression was inducible by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), sensitive to cycloheximide and resistant to phosphonoacetic acid. The transcription start site was mapped to 79 nt upstream of the ATG initiation site by 5'-RACE. Mutagenesis analysis identified a region between -56 and the transcription start site (+1) as the minimal promoter region that contains a functional TATA box at -27. A region between -337 and -125 contains a repressor domain negated by sequence from -991 to -499 in BCBL-1 cells, a region which was also identified to be responsive to TPA induction. These results demonstrate vIRF as a KSHV early gene, identify its promoter and define the promoter regions that contain regulatory elements controlling vIRF transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2076096616,"The mdr1b gene is thought to be a ""stress-responsive"" gene, however it is unknown if this gene is regulated by p53 in the whole animal. Moreover, it is unknown if overexpression of mdr1b affects cell survival. The dependence of mdr1b upon p53 for upregulation was evaluated in p53 knockout mice. Wild-type (wt) or p53-/- mice were treated singly or in combination with gamma irradiation (IR) and/or the potent DNA damaging agent, diethylnitrosoamine (DEN). Both IR and DEN induced mdr1b in wild-type animals, but not in the p53-/- mice. IR also upregulated endogenous mdr1b in the H35 liver cell line, and the mdr1b promoter was activated by IR and activation correlated with p53 levels; moreover activation required an intact p53 binding site. Colony survival studies revealed that co-transfection of both mdr1b and p53 dramatically reduced colony numbers compared to cells transfected with either p53 or mdr1b alone and cells microinjected with both mdr1b and p53 had a more dramatic loss in viability compared to cells injected with either expression vector alone. Further studies using acridine orange and ethidium bromide to measure apoptosis revealed that mdr1b caused apoptosis and this was enhanced by p53, however the increased apoptosis required a functional p53 transactivation domain. These studies indicate that mdr1b is a downstream target of p53 in the whole animal and expression of mdr1b facilitates p53-mediated cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2012968525,"The translocation t(11;16)(q23;p13) has only been documented in patients with acute leukemia or myelodysplasia secondary to therapy with drugs targeting DNA topoisomerase II. We have established a myeloid cell line (SN-1) with the MLL-CBP fusion gene from an acute leukemia patient with t(11;16)(q23;p13). Although SN-1 cells were not induced to differentiate by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (VD3), retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonists, such as 9-cis retinoic acid and Ro48-2250, effectively induced differentiation of the cells. Downregulation of the expression of the MLL-CBP fusion gene occurred during the differentiation of SN-1 cells. When SN-1 cells were treated with MLL-CBP antisense oligonucleotide, the cells were induced to differentiate by ATRA or VD3, suggesting that the MLL-CBP fusion gene dominant-negatively suppresses ATRA- or VD3-induced differentiation. Moreover, suboptimal concentrations of sodium butyrate, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, had a cooperative effect with ATRA or VD3 in inducing the differentiation of SN-1 cells. The downregulation of the expression of MLL-CBP mRNA was accompanied by the induction of differentiation. These findings suggest that RXR agonists or a clinically applicable combination of ATRA and butyrate derivatives might be useful for differentiation therapy in leukemia patients with the MLL-CBP fusion gene."
