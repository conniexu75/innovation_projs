https://openalex.org/W2080883481,"The current state-of-the-art in automatic QRS detection methods show high robustness and almost negligible error rates. In return, the methods are usually based on machine-learning approaches that require sufficient computational resources. However, simple-fast methods can also achieve high detection rates. There is a need to develop numerically efficient algorithms to accommodate the new trend towards battery-driven ECG devices and to analyze long-term recorded signals in a time-efficient manner. A typical QRS detection method has been reduced to a basic approach consisting of two moving averages that are calibrated by a knowledge base using only two parameters. In contrast to high-accuracy methods, the proposed method can be easily implemented in a digital filter design."

In order to make these drugs readily available to the patients at affordable prices, we isolated the endophytic fungi from Catharanthus roseus plant and found a fungus AA-CRL-6 which produces vinblastine and vincristine in appreciable amounts. These drugs were purified by TLC and HPLC and characterized using UV-Vis spectroscopy, ESI-MS, MS/MS and 1H NMR. One liter of culture filtrate yielded 76 µg and 67 µg of vinblastine and vincristine respectively. This endophytic fungal strain was identified as Fusarium oxysporum based upon its cultural and morphological characteristics and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence analysis."
https://openalex.org/W1985862669,"Fungal endophytes--fungi that grow within plant tissues without causing immediate signs of disease--are abundant and diverse producers of bioactive secondary metabolites. Endophytes associated with leaves of tropical plants are an especially exciting and relatively untapped source of novel compounds. However, one major challenge in drug discovery lies in developing strategies to efficiently recover highly bioactive strains. As part of a 15-year drug discovery project, foliar endophytes were isolated from 3198 plant samples (51 orders, 105 families and at least 232 genera of angiosperms and ferns) collected in nine geographically distinct regions of Panama. Extracts from culture supernatants of >2700 isolates were tested for bioactivity (in vitro percent inhibition of growth, % IG) against a human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) and the causative agents of malaria, leishmaniasis, and Chagas' disease. Overall, 32.7% of endophyte isolates were highly active in at least one bioassay, including representatives of diverse fungal lineages, host lineages, and collection sites. Up to 17% of isolates tested per assay were highly active. Most bioactive strains were active in only one assay. Fungal lineages differed in the incidence and degree of bioactivity, as did fungi from particular plant taxa, and greater bioactivity was observed in endophytes isolated from plants in cloud forests vs. lowland forests. Our results suggest that using host taxonomy and forest type to tailor plant collections, and selecting endophytes from specific orders or families for cultivation, will markedly increase the efficiency and efficacy of discovering bioactive metabolites for particular pharmaceutical targets."
https://openalex.org/W1995263201,"Biomarker host genetic signatures are considered key tools for improved early diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) disease (development). The analysis of gene expression changes based on a limited number of genes or single study designs, however, may not be sufficient for the identification of universal diagnostic biomarker profiles. Here we propose that biological pathway and process based analyses from multiple data sets may be more relevant for identification of key pathways in TB pathogenesis, and may reveal novel candidate diagnostic TB biomarkers. A number of independent genome-wide gene expression studies have recently been performed to study expression of biomarkers for TB disease. We have integrated the results from these independent studies and performed pathway- as well as biological process-based analysis on the total data set. Interestingly, IFNα/β signalling is not the single dominant pathway in the analysis of the total dataset, but combined, functional, analysis of biomarkers suggests a strong dominant role for myeloid cell involvement in inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2059112462,"The human intestine hosts a complex bacterial community that plays a major role in nutrition and in maintaining human health. A functional metagenomic approach was used to explore the prebiotic breakdown potential of human gut bacteria, including non-cultivated ones. Two metagenomic libraries, constructed from ileum mucosa and fecal microbiota, were screened for hydrolytic activities on the prebiotic carbohydrates inulin, fructo-oligosaccharides, xylo-oligosaccharides, galacto-oligosaccharides and lactulose. The DNA inserts of 17 clones, selected from the 167 hits that were identified, were pyrosequenced in-depth, yielding in total 407, 420 bp of metagenomic DNA. From these sequences, we discovered novel prebiotic degradation pathways containing carbohydrate transporters and hydrolysing enzymes, for which we provided the first experimental proof of function. Twenty of these proteins are encoded by genes that are also present in the gut metagenome of at least 100 subjects, whatever are their ages or their geographical origin. The sequence taxonomic assignment indicated that still unknown bacteria, for which neither culture conditions nor genome sequence are available, possess the enzymatic machinery to hydrolyse the prebiotic carbohydrates tested. The results expand the vision on how prebiotics are metabolized along the intestine, and open new perspectives for the design of functional foods."
https://openalex.org/W2152405846,"Besides their role in immune system host defense, there is growing evidence that macrophages may also be important regulators of salt homeostasis and blood pressure by a TonEBP-VEGF-C dependent buffering mechanism. As macrophages are known to accumulate in the skin of rats fed under high salt diet conditions and are pivotal for removal of high salt storage, the question arose how macrophages sense sites of high sodium storage. Interestingly, we observed that macrophage-like RAW264.7 cells, murine bone marrow-derived macrophages and peritoneal macrophages recognize NaCl hypertonicity as a chemotactic stimulus and migrate in the direction of excess salt concentration by using an in vitro transwell migration assay. While RAW264.7 cells migrated toward NaCl in a dose-dependent fashion, no migratory response toward isotonic or hypotonic media controls, or other osmo-active agents, e.g. urea or mannitol, could be detected. Interestingly, we could not establish a specific role of the osmoprotective transcription factor TonEBP in regulating salt-dependent chemotaxis, since the specific migration of bone marrow-derived macrophages following RNAi of TonEBP toward NaCl was not altered. Although the underlying mechanism remains unidentified, these data point to a thus far unappreciated role for NaCl-dependent chemotaxis of macrophages in the clearance of excess salt, and suggest the existence of novel NaCl sensor/effector circuits, which are independent of the TonEBP system."

These non-dividing, metabolically active cells are highly secretory and alter tissue homeostasis, creating an environment conducive to metastatic disease progression. IL-1α is a key senescence-associated (SA) proinflammatory cytokine that acts as a critical upstream regulator of the SA secretory phenotype (SASP). We established that SA shifts in steady-state H2O2 and intracellular Ca2+ levels caused an increase in IL-1α expression and processing.

Significance: Targeting senescent cells with antioxidant-based therapeutics may restrict inflammation and combat age-related disease progression. Cellular senescence is an important tumor-constraining mechanism that halts cellular proliferation in response to damage that occurs during replication.

Suppression of IL-1α expression or its biological function can extend cellular life span and restrict SA gene expression, but the mechanism of this age-dependent induction is unknown. IL-1α is synthesized as a precursor protein that is subsequently cleaved into two functional fragments by the Ca2+-activated protease calpain (7.Kobayashi Y. Yamamoto K. Saido T. Kawasaki H. Oppenheim J.J. Matsushima K. Identification of calcium-activated neutral protease as a processing enzyme of human interleukin 1α.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 5548-5552Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The resulting C-terminal fragment of IL-1α (mature IL-1α) can bind IL-1 receptor I at the cell surface. IL-1 receptor I ligation elicits the production of inflammatory mediators, including IL-6 and IL-8 (6.Orjalo A.V. Bhaumik D. Gengler B.K. Scott G.K. Campisi J. Cell surface-bound IL-1α is an upstream regulator of the senescence-associated IL-6/IL-8 cytokine network.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 17031-17036Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The N-terminal propiece of IL-1α has a canonical nuclear localization sequence and can translocate into the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, the IL-1α propiece has been shown to act as a nuclear oncoprotein (8.Stevenson F.T. Turck J. Locksley R.M. Lovett D.H. The N-terminal propiece of interleukin 1α is a transforming nuclear oncoprotein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

These findings imply that IL-1α precursor processing may be required for full function and suggest that the regulated expression and subsequent processing of IL-1α are of functional significance. Recent evidence in immune cells supports this possibility, demonstrating that the processed form of IL-1α is more effective in inducing the production of inflammatory mediators (10.Afonina I.S. Tynan G.A. Logue S.E. Cullen S.P. Bots M. Lüthi A.U. Reeves E.P. McElvaney N.G. Medema J.P. Lavelle E.C. Martin S.J. Granzyme B-dependent proteolysis acts as a switch to enhance the proinflammatory activity of IL-1α.Mol. Cell. 2011; 44: 265-278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Our findings indicate that SA IL-1α expression is induced by endogenous increases in intracellular H2O2. SA increases in intracellular Ca2+ levels provide sufficient quantities of this required cofactor for calpain activation. Consequently, calpain is aberrantly active in senescent cells and results in enhanced IL-1α processing. Reducing SA oxidative stress restricts inflammatory gene expression and effectively prevents senescent cells from adopting the SASP. Chelating Ca2+ during senescence inhibits calpain activation and IL-1α processing and attenuates the SASP phenotype. Functionally, restricting SA oxidative stress or aberrant Ca2+ signaling prevents senescent fibroblasts from promoting an invasive phenotype in proximal metastatic cancer epithelial cells. Together, these findings demonstrate how oxidant accumulation and Ca2+ deregulation during senescence coordinately influence the SASP and its impact on the tumor microenvironment.

MDA-MB-231 and A549 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. IMR-90 primary human fetal lung fibroblasts were cultured in minimal essential medium with 10% FBS and incubated at 21 or 3% oxygen tension at 37 °C with 5% CO2. These cells were lifted in 0.05% trypsin/EDTA and serially passaged at a dilution of 1:4. Cells were transfected using FuGENE HD transfection reagent at a ratio of 2.5:1 reagent to plasmid DNA. The cell-permeant oxidation-sensitive dye H2DCFDA (Invitrogen) was loaded into cells according to the manufacturer's protocol, followed by analysis by imaging flow cytometry. The oxidation-insensitive dye 5(6)-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (CDCF; Invitrogen) was used as a control so that any changes in fluorescence seen between groups with the oxidation-sensitive dye could be directly attributed to changes in dye oxidation. Briefly, cells were loaded with 1 μm H2DCFDA or CDCF in PBS for 45 min, followed by several PBS washes. The fluorescence intensity of oxidized DCF was measured using an Amnis ImageStreamX flow cytometer. The IDEAS software program was used to determine the mean fluorescence intensity and standard deviation for each sample. Mean fluorescent values for H2DCFDA-treated cells were normalized to values for control CDCF-treated passage (p) 15 and p25 cells. RNA was isolated from samples using TRIzol (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript III (Invitrogen) with random hexamers. Real-time PCR was performed with an Applied Biosystems 7500 real-time thermocycler with SYBR Green. Specific primers were used for each target, and the PCR conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of melting at 95 °C for 15 s, and annealing and elongation at 60 °C for 1 min. Product specificity was verified with a melt curve. For filamentous actin staining, cells were fixed in an appropriate volume of methanol-free 4% formaldehyde diluted in PBS. These cells were then stained with Alexa Fluor 488-phalloidin conjugate (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells expressing a DsRed-IL-1α N-terminal fusion construct were seeded on glass coverslips 1 day prior to imaging. The next day, these cells were washed three times with 1× PBS and fixed in an appropriate volume of 3 parts acetone to 2 parts PBS. Cells were imaged using an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope. Nuclei were stained with DAPI that was present in the Prolong mounting medium (Invitrogen). Cells were stained for β-galactosidase (catalog no. 98603, Cell Signaling) at pH 6 following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were fixed and stained overnight in a dry incubator at 37 °C. Staining was detected the following day using a light microscope. Cells positive for staining turned blue. Intracellular calcium levels were determined using ratiometric analysis of the calcium-binding dye Fura-2-AM (Invitrogen). This cell-permeable dye excites at 340 nm when bound to calcium and at 380 nm when unbound. Fluorescence intensities were then measured at an emission wavelength of 510 nm. These intensities were represented as a ratio of 340 to 380 nm. Cells were lysed in an appropriate volume of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitors) at pH 7.5 for 15 min, with rotation at 4 °C. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C, and the protein-containing supernatant was analyzed for protein concentration using BCA (Thermo Scientific). Equal amounts of protein were then subjected to PAGE and subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, followed by overnight incubation with primary antibodies at 4 °C. Blots were visualized using chemiluminescence. Where exogenous catalase uptake was measured, the cells were vigorously washed three times prior to cellular lysis to exclude any catalase that may have been attached to the cell surface. Calpain activity was measured using a calpain activity assay kit (catalog no. K240-100, BioVision). Briefly, 1 × 106 cells were pelleted by centrifugation, followed by resuspension in extraction buffer on ice for 20 min. Equal amounts of lysate (normalized to total protein) were incubated with fluorescently labeled calpain substrate at 37 °C for 1 h. Relative fluorescence was measured in a plate reader with a 400-nm excitation filter and 505-nm emission filter. 24-well chamber inserts precoated with Matrigel (BD Biosciences) were partly submerged in 750 μl of conditioned medium (CM) collected over 18 h. MDA-MB-231 cells were placed in the top chamber in serum-free medium and allowed to invade over 22 h. Non-invading cells were removed from the insert with cotton-tipped applicators. Invaded cells were fixed in 100% methanol for 20 min at −20 °C and mounted on Prolong mounting medium containing DAPI for visualization. The primers used were as follow: IL-1α, AACCAGTGCTGCTGAAGGA (sense) and TTCTTAGTGCCGTGAGTTTCC (antisense); actin, ACCAACTGGGACGACATGGAGAAA (sense) and TAGCACAGCCTGGATAGCAACGTA (antisense); IL-6, CCACACAGACAGCCACTCACC IL-6 (sense) and CTACATTTGCCGAAGAGCCCTC (antisense); and IL-8, CTCTCTTGGCAGCCTTCCTGATT (sense) and AACTTCTCCACAACCCTCTGCAC (antisense). IL-1α expression increases as cells near their replicative life span (3.Mariotti M. Castiglioni S. Bernardini D. Maier J.A. Interleukin 1α is a marker of endothelial cellular senescent.Immun.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 17031-17036Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), and this elevated expression coincides with an increase in oxidation of the redox-sensitive fluorophore H2DCFDA (Fig. 1, A and B) and supports prior work indicating that senescence is accompanied by increases in steady-state H2O2 concentration (SS-[H2O2]) (11.Dasgupta J. Kar S. Liu R. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. Remington S.J. Chen C. Melendez J.A. Reactive oxygen species control senescence-associated matrix metalloproteinase-1 through c-Jun N-terminal kinase.J. Cell. Physiol. 2010; 225: 52-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Because SA increases in IL-1α and SS-[H2O2] occur concurrently, we first determined if shifts in SS-[H2O2] influence the expression of SA IL-1α. Primary human fibroblasts (IMR-90) approach their replicative life span in 21% O2 at or near 50 population doublings (≈p25), which coincides with increased SS-[H2O2] (11.Dasgupta J. Kar S. Liu R.

Maintaining cells in a low (3%) O2 environment reduces SS-[H2O2] and oxidative damage and delays the onset of senescence (11.Dasgupta J. Kar S. Liu R. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. Remington S.J. Chen C.

IL-1α expression was increased in senescent (>p25) cells cultured in 21% O2, but not in the replicative age-matched controls cultured in 3% O2 (Fig. 1D). To further define the oxidant dependence of this process, late passage (>p25) cells were treated with recombinant catalase, and IL-1α levels were determined. When added to the medium, catalase gains entry into cells, where it specifically scavenges H2O2 (14.Guikema B.J. Ginnan R. Singer H.A. Jourd'heuil D. Catalase potentiates interleukin-1β-induced expression of nitric oxide synthase in rat vascular smooth muscle cells.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2005; 38: 597-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Exogenous catalase loading was confirmed (Fig. 1E) and significantly reduced IL-1α expression in >p25 cells (Fig. 1F). In addition, treatment with catalase or the glutathione precursor N-acetyl-l-cysteine abrogated SA IL-1α expression in late passage cells (Fig. 1G). Notably, production of SA IL-1α was accompanied by preferential processing to its 17-kDa form (Fig. 1G). Together, these data indicate that shifts in oxidant production control SA increases in IL-1α expression and processing. Calpain, a protease that processes IL-1α, is functionally dependent on the availability of Ca2+, the homoeostasis of which can be oxidant-sensitive (15.Gleichmann M. Mattson M.P. Neuronal calcium homeostasis and dysregulation.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2011; 14: 1261-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 16.Galan C. Jardín I. Dionisio N. Salido G. Rosado J.A.

To determine whether senescent cells display alterations in [Ca2+]i, we used the cell-permeant Ca2+-binding ratiometric fluorophore Fura-2-AM and monitored [Ca2+]i in both <p15 and >p25 cells. Senescent cells displayed higher basal [Ca2+]i than presenescent cells (Fig. 2A), which was attenuated in cells acutely exposed to low oxygen (3%) (Fig. 2B). Ca2+ is a required cofactor for calpain activity; thus, we next determined the degree of calpain activation in <p15 and >p25 cells. Upon Ca2+-dependent activation, calpain undergoes autolysis, which involves the removal of several N-terminal residues (18.Badugu R. Garcia M. Bondada V. Joshi A. Geddes J.W. N terminus of calpain 1 is a mitochondrial targeting sequence.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 3409-3417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Utilizing antibodies that recognize either the N-terminal epitope that is lost upon activation or total calpain, we determined the degree of calpain activation by immunoblotting. Total calpain levels were similar between <p15 and >p25 cells; however, the amount of inactive calpain was decreased in >p25 cells (Fig. 2, C and D), suggesting that calpain in these cells is primarily in its active state. We next measured calpain activity in <p15 and >p25 cells using fluorescently tagged substrates. This assay quantitatively confirmed our findings, displaying an ∼6-fold increase in calpain activity during senescence (Fig. 2E). To link SA increase in [Ca2+]i to calpain activation, we next treated >p25 cells with BAPTA-AM, a Ca2+-specific chelator, and measured calpain activation quantitatively and by immunoblotting. Ca2+ chelation restricted calpain activity, albeit in a modest and short-lived fashion (Fig. 2, F and G). Furthermore, SA IL-1α processing was effectively prevented when >p25 cells were treated with BAPTA-AM (Fig. 2F). Together, these data identify SA shifts in Ca2+ homeostasis that are linked to aberrant calpain activation and IL-1α processing. IL-1α processing is often accompanied by its cellular redistribution (9.Werman A. Werman-Venkert R. White R. Lee J.K. Werman B. Krelin Y. Voronov E. Dinarello C.A. Apte R.N.

To determine IL-1α localization, <p15 and >p25 IMR-90 cells were transiently transfected with a DsRed-IL-1α N-terminal fusion construct, and its cellular distribution was monitored when exposed to low or ambient O2 tension. DsRed-IL-1α was localized primarily in the nucleus in >p25 cells, but not in <p15 cells cultured in 21% O2 (Fig. 3, A and B). Cells maintained at 3% O2 abrogated the SA IL-1α nuclear localization compared with their age-matched controls maintained at 21% O2 (Fig. 3C). Treatment with recombinant catalase prevented IL-1α nuclear localization (Fig. 3D), further implicating H2O2 in this process. Furthermore, SA IL-1α was excluded from the nucleus of cells treated with a calpain inhibitor (Fig. 3E), indicating calpain involvement. Together, these findings support a role for oxidants and calpain in SA IL-1α nuclear localization. SA IL-1α has been reported to functionally act as an initiator of the SASP (1.Campisi J.

We confirmed, this finding using a neutralizing antibody against the secreted form of IL-1α (mature IL-1α), which inhibited the SA expression of both IL-6 and IL-8 (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, IL-1α neutralization also inhibited the expression of nascent IL-1α, suggesting a feed-forward mechanism (Fig. 4A). To investigate whether the SASP is also under redox control, we monitored SA IL-6 and IL-8 expression in cells exposed to 21 and 3% O2 or treated with an antioxidant. Both IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA levels were increased during senescence, but only IL-6 (not IL-8) expression was attenuated by low oxygen tension (Fig. 4, A and B). However, SA expression of both cytokines was prevented by the addition of the H2O2-scavenging enzyme catalase (Fig. 4C). Treatment of senescent cells with BAPTA-AM also reduced the expression of IL-8, but not IL-6, at 5 and 7 h post-treatment (Fig. 4, D and E). IL-6 levels decreased modestly, but insignificantly (p = 0.10), at 7 h post-treatment. Later time points may be needed to determine whether the effect on IL-6 is delayed. Inhibition of the IL-1α-processing enzyme calpain caused a reduction in the expression of both IL-6 and IL-8 (Fig. 4F). Our findings further support a role for IL-1α as an upstream regulator of the SASP (6.Orjalo A.V. Bhaumik D. Gengler B.K. Scott G.K. Campisi J. Cell surface-bound IL-1α is an upstream regulator of the senescence-associated IL-6/IL-8 cytokine network.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

SASP factors can act on neighboring tissue, promoting the invasive properties of premalignant cells (1.Campisi J. Senescent cells, tumor suppression, and organismal aging: good citizens, bad neighbors.Cell. 2005; 120: 513-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1820) Google Scholar). We next tested whether the invasive behavior of metastatic breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) is sensitive to exposure to CM from IMR-90 fibroblasts cultured in 21 or 3% O2 or treated with antioxidants. CM collected from cells exposed to 3% O2 failed to induce significant Matrigel invasion compared with CM from cells exposed to 21% O2. CM from <p15 cultures exposed to 21 or 3% O2 had no impact on the invasive capacity of MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 5, A and B). Similarly, senescent CM collected from cells treated with recombinant catalase significantly reduced the number of invading cells (Fig. 5C), whereas direct catalase exposure of the MDA-MB-231 cells had no impact on their invasive potential (Fig. 5D). Collectively, these data demonstrate that the ability of senescent CM to drive the invasive potential of proximal cancer cells is redox-sensitive. We next exposed >p25 cells to BAPTA-AM and a calpain inhibitor and monitored the ability of senescent CM to promote invasion. BAPTA-AM modestly but significantly impaired invasion driven by exposure to senescent CM, similar to its impact on IL-6 and IL-8 (Fig. 5E). Treatment of >p25 cells with a calpain inhibitor also significantly reduced the resultant invasion of breast cancer cells cultured in this CM (Fig. 5F). MD-MB-231 cells are highly invasive, and therefore, it was of interest to test the effects of CM on the less invasive A549 lung carcinoma cells. Much like the effect on MDA-MB-231 cells, CM from >p25 fibroblasts increased invasion relative to CM from <p15 fibroblasts (Fig. 5, G and H). Overall, these findings establish that SASP impairment in response to low oxygen, antioxidant treatment, Ca2+ chelation, or calpain inhibition can limit paracrine signaling that promotes neighboring tumor cell invasion. We next evaluated the distribution of filamentous actin in MDA-MB-231 cells exposed to fibroblast CM, as actin reorganization and polarization are critical steps in the process of epi"
https://openalex.org/W2056526417,"Aspergillus niger is known to secrete large amounts of β-glucosidases, which have a variety of biotechnological and industrial applications. Here, we purified an A. niger β-glucosidase (AnBgl1) and conducted its biochemical and biophysical analyses. Purified enzyme with an apparent molecular mass of 116 kDa forms monomers in solution as judged by native gel electrophoresis and has a pI value of 4.55, as found for most of the fungi of β-glucosidases. Surprisingly, the small angle x-ray experiments reveal that AnBgl1 has a tadpole-like structure, with the N-terminal catalytic domain and C-terminal fibronectin III-like domain (FnIII) connected by the long linker peptide (∼100 amino acid residues) in an extended conformation. This molecular organization resembles the one adopted by other cellulases (such as cellobiohydrolases, for example) that frequently contain a catalytic domain linked to the cellulose-binding module that mediates their binding to insoluble and polymeric cellulose. The reasons why AnBgl1, which acts on the small soluble substrates, has a tadpole molecular shape are not entirely clear. However, our enzyme pulldown assays with different polymeric substrates suggest that AnBgl1 has little or no capacity to bind to and to adsorb cellulose, xylan, and starch, but it has high affinity to lignin. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested that clusters of residues located in the C-terminal FnIII domain interact strongly with lignin fragments. The simulations showed that numerous arginine residues scattered throughout the FnIII surface play an important role in the interaction with lignin by means of cation-π stacking with the lignin aromatic rings. These results indicate that the C-terminal FnIII domain could be operational for immobilization of the enzyme on the cell wall and for the prevention of unproductive binding of cellulase to the biomass lignin."
https://openalex.org/W2084532391,"Objective Dysfunction of the intestinal epithelial tight junction (TJ) barrier is known to have an important etiologic role in the pathophysiology of heat stroke. N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), play a role in maintaining and protecting the TJ structure and function. This study is aimed at investigating whether n-3 PUFAs could alleviate heat stress-induced dysfunction of intestinal tight junction. Methods Human intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells were pre-incubated with EPA, DHA or arachidonic acid (AA) and then exposed to heat stress. Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP) permeability were measured to analyze barrier integrity. Levels of TJ proteins, including occludin, ZO-1 and claudin-2, were analyzed by Western blot and localized by immunofluorescence microscopy. Messenger RNA levels were determined by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR). TJ morphology was observed by transmission electron microscopy. Results EPA effectively attenuated the decrease in TEER and impairment of intestinal permeability in HRP flux induced by heat exposure. EPA significantly elevated the expression of occludin and ZO-1, while DHA was less effective and AA was not at all effective. The distortion and redistribution of TJ proteins, and disruption of morphology were also effectively prevented by pretreatment with EPA. Conclusion This study indicates for the first time that EPA is more potent than DHA in protecting against heat-induced permeability dysfunction and epithelial barrier damage of tight junction."
https://openalex.org/W2072850443,"Bordetella pertussis, the pathogenic bacteria responsible for whooping cough, secretes several virulence factors, among which is the adenylate cyclase toxin (CyaA) that plays a crucial role in the early stages of human respiratory tract colonization. CyaA invades target cells by translocating its catalytic domain directly across the plasma membrane and overproduces cAMP, leading to cell death. The molecular process leading to the translocation of the catalytic domain remains largely unknown. We have previously shown that the catalytic domain per se, AC384, encompassing residues 1-384 of CyaA, did not interact with lipid bilayer, whereas a longer polypeptide, AC489, spanning residues 1-489, binds to membranes and permeabilizes vesicles. Moreover, deletion of residues 375-485 within CyaA abrogated the translocation of the catalytic domain into target cells. Here, we further identified within this region a peptidic segment that exhibits membrane interaction properties. A synthetic peptide, P454, corresponding to this sequence (residues 454-485 of CyaA) was characterized by various biophysical approaches. We found that P454 (i) binds to membranes containing anionic lipids, (ii) adopts an α-helical structure oriented in plane with respect to the lipid bilayer, and (iii) permeabilizes vesicles. We propose that the region encompassing the helix 454-485 of CyaA may insert into target cell membrane and induce a local destabilization of the lipid bilayer, thus favoring the translocation of the catalytic domain across the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2087072817,"Popeye domain containing1 (Popdc1), also named Bves, is an evolutionary conserved membrane protein. Despite its high expression level in the heart little is known about its membrane localization and cardiac functions. The study examined the hypothesis that Popdc1 might be associated with the caveolae and play a role in myocardial ischemia tolerance. To address these issues, we analyzed hearts and cardiomyocytes of wild type and Popdc1-null mice. Immunoconfocal microscopy revealed co-localization of Popdc1 with caveolin3 in the sarcolemma, intercalated discs and T-tubules and with costameric vinculin. Popdc1 was co-immunoprecipitated with caveolin3 from cardiomyocytes and from transfected COS7 cells and was co-sedimented with caveolin3 in equilibrium density gradients. Caveolae disruption by methyl-β-cyclodextrin or by ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) abolished the cellular co-localization of Popdc1 with caveolin3 and modified their density co-sedimentation. The caveolin3-rich fractions of Popdc1-null hearts redistributed to fractions of lower buoyant density. Electron microscopy showed a statistically significant 70% reduction in caveolae number and a 12% increase in the average diameter of the remaining caveolae in the mutant hearts. In accordance with these changes, Popdc1-null cardiomyocytes displayed impaired [Ca(+2)]i transients, increased vulnerability to oxidative stress and no pharmacologic preconditioning. In addition, induction of I/R injury to Langendorff-perfused hearts indicated a significantly lower functional recovery in the mutant compared with wild type hearts while their infarct size was larger. No improvement in functional recovery was observed in Popdc1-null hearts following ischemic preconditioning. The results indicate that Popdc1 is a caveolae-associated protein important for the preservation of caveolae structural and functional integrity and for heart protection."

Data were abstracted from TB registers and individual treatment charts. Logistic regression analysis was done to examine associations between baseline demographic and clinical factors and three outcomes adherence, sputum smear conversion at two months, and death.Out of 725 eligible patients the treatment chart was retrieved for 581 (80%). Fifty-six (10%) of these patients took <90% of doses (defined as poor adherence). Baseline demographic characteristics were not associated with adherence to TB treatment, but adherence was lower among HIV patients not taking antiretroviral therapy (ART); p = 0.03). Sputum smear results around 2 months after start of treatment were available for 220 of 311 initially sputum-smear-positive pulmonary TB (PTB+) patients (71%); 175 (80%) had achieved sputum smear conversion. In multivariable analysis, baseline sputum smear grade (odds ratio [OR] = 2.7, 95% Confidence interval [CI] 1.1-6.6 comparing smear 3+ against 1+) and HIV infection (OR 3.0, 95%CI 1.3-6.7) were independent predictors for non-conversion at 2 months. Sixty-nine of 574 patients (12%) with known TB treatment outcomes had died. Besides other known determinants, poor adherence had an independent, strong effect on mortality (OR 3.4, 95%CI 1.4-7.8).HIV infection is an important independent predictor of failure of sputum smear conversion at 2 months among PTB+ patients. Poor adherence to TB treatment is an important independent determinant of mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2029406542,"Asparagine (N)-linked glycosylation regulates numerous cellular activities, such as glycoprotein quality control, intracellular trafficking, and cell-cell communications. In eukaryotes, the glycosylation reaction is catalyzed by oligosaccharyltransferase (OST), a multimembrane protein complex that is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). During N-glycosylation in the ER, the protein-unbound form of oligosaccharides (free oligosaccharides; fOSs), which is structurally related to N-glycan, is released into the ER lumen. However, the enzyme responsible for this process remains unidentified. Here, we demonstrate that eukaryotic OST generates fOSs. Biochemical and genetic analyses using mutant strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed that the generation of fOSs is tightly correlated with the N-glycosylation activity of OST. Furthermore, we present evidence that the purified OST complex can generate fOSs by hydrolyzing dolichol-linked oligosaccharide, the glycan donor substrate for N-glycosylation. The heterologous expression of a single subunit of OST from the protozoan Leishmania major in S. cerevisiae demonstrated that this enzyme functions both in N-glycosylation and generation of fOSs. This study provides insight into the mechanism of PNGase-independent formation of fOSs."

Our aims were to evaluate circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) levels in patients with TRAPS, in comparison to controls without inflammatory diseases, and to correlate their levels with parameters of disease activity and/or disease severity. Expression levels of circulating miRNAs were measured by Agilent microarrays in 29 serum samples from 15 TRAPS patients carrying mutations known to be associated with high disease penetrance and from 8 controls without inflammatory diseases. Differentially expressed and clinically relevant miRNAs were detected using GeneSpring GX software. We identified a 6 miRNAs signature able to discriminate TRAPS from controls. Moreover, 4 miRNAs were differentially expressed between patients treated with the interleukin (IL)-1 receptor antagonist, anakinra, and untreated patients. Of these, miR-92a-3p and miR-150-3p expression was found to be significantly reduced in untreated patients, while their expression levels were similar to controls in samples obtained during anakinra treatment. MiR-92b levels were inversely correlated with the number of fever attacks/year during the 1(st) year from the index attack of TRAPS, while miR-377-5p levels were positively correlated with serum amyloid A (SAA) circulating levels. Our data suggest that serum miRNA levels show a baseline pattern in TRAPS, and may serve as potential markers of response to therapeutic intervention."

So far, mutations in more than 20 genes have been known to cause LCA and among them, RPE65 is a suitable candidate for gene therapy. The mutational screenings of RPE65 and other LCA genes are requisite in support of emerging gene specific therapy for LCA. Therefore, we have carried out a comprehensive LCA genes screening using a combined approach of direct sequencing and DNA microarray based Asper chip analysis.Thirty clinically diagnosed index LCA cases from Southern India were screened for coding and flanking intronic regions of RPE65 through direct sequencing. Among thirty, 25 cases excluded from RPE65 mutations were subjected to Asper chip analysis, testing 784 known pathogenic variations in 15 major LCA genes. In RPE65 screening, four different pathogenic variations including two novel (c.361insT & c.939T>A) and two known (c.394G>A & c.361delT) mutations were identified in five index cases. In the chip analysis, seven known pathogenic mutations were identified in six index cases, involving genes GUCY2D, RPGRIP1, AIPL1, CRX and IQCB1. Overall, 11 out of 30 LCA cases (36.6%) revealed pathogenic variations with the involvement of RPE65 (16.6%), GUCY2D (10%), RPGRIP1 (3.3%), AIPL1 (3.3%) and CRX & IQCB1 (3.3%).Our study suggests that such combined screening approach is productive and cost-effective for mutation detection and can be applied in Indian LCA cohort for molecular diagnosis and genetic counselling."
https://openalex.org/W1994909642,"Formation of the peptidoglycan stem pentapeptide requires the insertion of both L and D amino acids by the ATP-dependent ligase enzymes MurC, -D, -E, and -F. The stereochemical control of the third position amino acid in the pentapeptide is crucial to maintain the fidelity of later biosynthetic steps contributing to cell morphology, antibiotic resistance, and pathogenesis. Here we determined the x-ray crystal structure of Staphylococcus aureus MurE UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanyl-D-glutamate:meso-2,6-diaminopimelate ligase (MurE) (E.C. 6.3.2.7) at 1.8 Å resolution in the presence of ADP and the reaction product, UDP-MurNAc-L-Ala-γ-D-Glu-L-Lys. This structure provides for the first time a molecular understanding of how this Gram-positive enzyme discriminates between L-lysine and D,L-diaminopimelic acid, the predominant amino acid that replaces L-lysine in Gram-negative peptidoglycan. Despite the presence of a consensus sequence previously implicated in the selection of the third position residue in the stem pentapeptide in S. aureus MurE, the structure shows that only part of this sequence is involved in the selection of L-lysine. Instead, other parts of the protein contribute substrate-selecting residues, resulting in a lysine-binding pocket based on charge characteristics. Despite the absolute specificity for L-lysine, S. aureus MurE binds this substrate relatively poorly. In vivo analysis and metabolomic data reveal that this is compensated for by high cytoplasmic L-lysine concentrations. Therefore, both metabolic and structural constraints maintain the structural integrity of the staphylococcal peptidoglycan. This study provides a novel focus for S. aureus-directed antimicrobials based on dual targeting of essential amino acid biogenesis and its linkage to cell wall assembly."

In this work we aimed to identify genes expressed during spermatogenesis in the functional hermaphrodite scallop Nodipecten subnodosus (Mollusca: Bivalvia: Pectinidae), with the purpose of obtaining a panel of genes that would allow for the study of differentially transcribed genes between diploid and triploid scallops in the context of meiotic arrest and reproductive sterility. Because our aim was to isolate genes involved in meiosis and other testis maturation-related processes, we generated suppressive subtractive hybridization libraries of testis vs. inactive gonad. We obtained 352 and 177 ESTs by clone sequencing, and using pyrosequencing (454-Roche) we maximized the identified ESTs to 34,276 reads. A total of 1,153 genes from the testis library had a blastx hit and GO annotation, including genes specific for meiosis, spermatogenesis, sex-differentiation, and transposable elements. Some of the identified meiosis genes function in chromosome pairing (scp2, scp3), recombination and DNA repair (dmc1, rad51, ccnb1ip1/hei10), and meiotic checkpoints (rad1, hormad1, dtl/cdt2). Gene expression analyses in different gametogenic stages in both sexual regions of the gonad of meiosis genes confirmed that the expression was specific or increased towards the maturing testis. Spermatogenesis genes included known testis-specific ones (kelch-10, shippo1, adad1), with some of these known to be associated to sterility. Sex differentiation genes included one of the most conserved genes at the bottom of the sex-determination cascade (dmrt1). Transcript from transposable elements, reverse transcriptase, and transposases in this library evidenced that transposition is an active process during spermatogenesis in N. subnodosus. In relation to the inactive library, we identified 833 transcripts with functional annotation related to activation of the transcription and translation machinery, as well as to germline control and maintenance."

We found a strong correlation between the ability of AP1 and its isogenic mutants lacking protein H to inhibit opsonization with complement C3b and binding of C4BP. C4BP bound to immobilized protein H or AP1 bacteria retained its cofactor activity for degradation of 125I-C4b. Furthermore, C4b deposited from serum onto AP1 bacterial surfaces was processed into C4c/C4d fragments, which did not occur on strains unable to bind C4BP. Recombinant C4BP mutants, which (i) lack certain CCP domains or (ii) have mutations in single aa as well as (iii) mutants with additional aa between different CCP domains were used to determine that the binding is mainly mediated by a patch of positively charged amino acid residues at the interface of domains CCP1 and CCP2.

https://openalex.org/W2006018565,"Background and Objectives The neuropsychological exam plays a central role in the assessment of elderly patients with cognitive complaints. It is particularly relevant to differentiate patients with mild dementia from those subjects with mild cognitive impairment. Formal education is a critical factor in neuropsychological performance; however, there are few studies that evaluated the psychometric properties, especially criterion related validity, neuropsychological tests for patients with low formal education. The present study aims to investigate the validity of an unstructured neuropsychological assessment protocol for this population and develop cutoff values for clinical use. Methods and Results A protocol composed by the Rey-Auditory Verbal Learning Test, Frontal Assessment Battery, Category and Letter Fluency, Stick Design Test, Clock Drawing Test, Digit Span, Token Test and TN-LIN was administered to 274 older adults (96 normal aging, 85 mild cognitive impairment and 93 mild Alzheimer`s disease) with predominantly low formal education. Factor analysis showed a four factor structure related to Executive Functions, Language/Semantic Memory, Episodic Memory and Visuospatial Abilities, accounting for 65% of explained variance. Most of the tests showed a good sensitivity and specificity to differentiate the diagnostic groups. The neuropsychological protocol showed a significant ecological validity as 3 of the cognitive factors explained 31% of the variance on Instrumental Activities of Daily Living. Conclusion The study presents evidence of the construct, criteria and ecological validity for this protocol. The neuropsychological tests and the proposed cutoff values might be used for the clinical assessment of older adults with low formal education."

Despite their widespread use, the benefits of periodic harvesting strategies for multi-species fisheries have, to date, been largely untested. We examine catch and effort data from four periodically-harvested reef areas and 55 continuously-fished reefs in Solomon Islands. We test the hypothesis that fishing in periodically-harvested closures would yield: (a) higher catch rates, (b) proportionally more short lived, fast growing, sedentary taxa, and (c) larger finfish and invertebrates, compared to catches from reefs continuously open to fishing. Our study showed that catch rates were significantly higher from periodically-harvested closures for gleaning of invertebrates, but not for line and spear fishing. The family level composition of catches did not vary significantly between open reefs and periodically-harvested closures. Fish captured from periodically-harvested closures were slightly larger, but Trochus niloticus were significantly smaller than those from continuously open reefs. In one case of intense and prolonged harvesting, gleaning catch rates significantly declined, suggesting invertebrate stocks were substantially depleted in the early stages of the open period. Our study suggests periodically-harvested closures can have some short term benefits via increasing harvesting efficiency. However, we did not find evidence that the strategy had substantially benefited multi-species fin-fisheries."
https://openalex.org/W2044034913,"The role of CD4(+) T cells in the generation of therapeutic primary and memory immune responses in cancer diverse immunotherapy settings remains ambiguous. We herein investigated this issue using two vaccine formulations containing a novel costimulatory molecule, SA-4-1BBL, as adjuvant and HPV E7 or survivin (SVN) as tumor associated antigens (TAAs) in two mouse transplantable tumor models; the TC-1 cervical cancer expressing xenogeneic HPV E7 and 3LL lung carcinoma overexpressing autologous SVN. Single vaccination with optimized SA-4-1BBL/TAA formulations resulted in the eradication of 6-day established TC-1 and 3LL tumors in >70% of mice in both models. The in vivo depletion of CD4(+) T cells one day before tumor challenge resulted in compromised vaccine efficacy in both TC-1 (25%) and 3LL (12.5%) tumor models. In marked contrast, depletion of CD4(+) T cells 5 days post-tumor challenge and one day prior to vaccination did not significantly alter the therapeutic efficacy of these vaccines. However, long-term immunological memory was compromised in the 3LL, but not in TC-1 model as a significant number (85.7%) of tumor free-mice succumbed to tumor growth when rechallenged with 3LL cells 60 days after the initial tumor inoculation. Collectively, these results demonstrate the indispensable role CD4(+) T cells play in the generation of therapeutic primary immune responses elicited by SA-4-1BBL/TAA-based vaccines irrespective of the nature of TAAs and establish the importance of CD4(+) T cells for long-term immune memory against 3LL tumor expressing self-antigen SVN, but not TC-1 expressing xenogeneic viral antigen E7."

Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and serotonin (5-HT) systems are essential for PFC function. Therefore, we examined the effects of adult exposure to BPA on 5α-Reductase (5α-R) and cytochrome P450 aromatase (P450arom), enzymes that synthesize GABAA receptor modulators, and tryptophan hydroxylase (Tph), the rate-limiting enzyme in 5-HT biosynthesis. To gain better understanding of BPA's action in the adult PFC, 84 genes involved in neurotoxicity were also analysed. Adult male and female rats were subcutaneously injected for 4 days with 50 µg/kg/day, the current reference safe dose for BPA. mRNA and protein levels of 5α-R, P450arom and Tph were quantified by real-time RT-PCR and Western blot. Genes linked to neurotoxicity were analyzed by PCR-Array technology. Adult exposure to BPA increased both P450arom and Tph2 expression in PFC of male and female, but decreased 5α-R1 expression in female. Moreover, we identified 17 genes related to PFC functions such as synaptic plasticity and memory, as potential targets of BPA. Our results provided new insights on the molecular mechanisms underlying BPA action in the physiopathology of PFC, but also raise the question about the safety of short-term exposure to it in the adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W2021172533,"Background This study aims to describe the trends in and determinants of six month mortality and loss to follow up (LTFU) during 2005–2009 in 13 outpatient clinics in Vietnam. Method Data were obtained from clinical records of 3,449 Vietnamese HIV/AIDS patients aged 18 years or older who initiated ART between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2009. Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test, log rank test were conducted to examine the trends of baseline characteristics, six month mortality and LTFU. Cox proportional hazards regression models were performed to compute hazard ratio (HR) and 95% Confidence Interval (CI). Results Though there was a declining trend, the incidence of six month mortality and LTFU remained as high as 6% and 15%, respectively. Characteristics associated with six month mortality were gender (HR females versus males 0.54, 95%CI: 0.34–0.85), years of initiation (HR 2009 versus 2005 0.54, 95%CI: 0.41–0.80), low baseline CD4 (HR 350–500 cells/mm3 versus <50 cells/mm3 0.26, 95%CI: 0.18–0.52), low baseline BMI (one unit increase: HR 0.96, 95%CI: 0.94–0.97), co-infection with TB (HR 1.61, 95%CI: 1.46–1.95), history of injecting drugs (HR 1.58, 95%CI: 1.31–1.78). Characteristics associated with LTFU were younger age (one year younger: HR 0.97, 95%CI: 0.95–0.98), males (HR females versus males 0.82, 95%CI: 0.63–0.95), and poor adherence (HR 0.55, 95%CI: 0.13–0.87). Conclusions To reduce early mortality, special attention is required to ensure timely access to ART services, particularly for patients at higher risk. Patients at risk for LTFU after ART initiation should be targeted through enhancing treatment counselling and improving patient tracing system at ART clinics."

Although the roles of 5-mC in epigenetic regulation of gene expression are well established, the effects of 5-hmC, 5-foC and 5-caC on DNA replication remain unclear. Here we report a systematic study on how these cytosine derivatives (5-hmC, 5-foC and 5-caC) perturb the efficiency and accuracy of DNA replication using shuttle vector technology in conjugation with next-g sequencing. Our results demonstrated that, in Escherichia coli cells, all the cytosine derivatives could induce CT transition mutation at frequencies of 0.17%-1.12%, though no effect on replication efficiency was observed. These findings provide an important new insight on the potential mutagenic properties of cytosine derivatives occurring as the intermediates of DNA demethylation."
https://openalex.org/W2067486956,"The increasing resistance to current therapeutic agents for HIV drug regiment remains a major problem for effective acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) therapy. Many potential inhibitors have today been developed which inhibits key cellular pathways in the HIV cycle. Inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase associated ribonuclease H (RNase H) function provides a novel target for anti-HIV chemotherapy. Here we report on the applicability of conceptually different in silico approaches as virtual screening (VS) tools in order to efficiently identify RNase H inhibitors from large chemical databases. The methods used here include machine-learning algorithms (e.g. support vector machine, random forest and kappa nearest neighbor), shape similarity (rapid overlay of chemical structures), pharmacophore, molecular interaction fields-based fingerprints for ligands and protein (FLAP) and flexible ligand docking methods. The results show that receptor-based flexible docking experiments provides good enrichment (80–90%) compared to ligand-based approaches such as FLAP (74%), shape similarity (75%) and random forest (72%). Thus, this study suggests that flexible docking experiments is the model of choice in terms of best retrieval of active from inactive compounds and efficiency and efficacy schemes. Moreover, shape similarity, machine learning and FLAP models could also be used for further validation or filtration in virtual screening processes. The best models could potentially be use for identifying structurally diverse and selective RNase H inhibitors from large chemical databases. In addition, pharmacophore models suggest that the inter-distance between hydrogen bond acceptors play a key role in inhibition of the RNase H domain through metal chelation."
https://openalex.org/W1994026540,"Climate change is expected to aggravate feed and food safety problems of crops; however, quantitative estimates are scarce. This study aimed to estimate impacts of climate change effects on deoxynivalenol contamination of wheat and maize grown in the Netherlands by 2040. Quantitative modelling was applied, considering both direct effects of changing climate on toxin contamination and indirect effects via shifts in crop phenology. Climate change projections for the IPCC A1B emission scenario were used for the scenario period 2031-2050 relative to the baseline period of 1975-1994. Climatic data from two different global and regional climate model combinations were used. A weather generator was applied for downscaling climate data to local conditions. Crop phenology models and prediction models for DON contamination used, each for winter wheat and grain maize. Results showed that flowering and full maturity of both wheat and maize will advance with future climate. Flowering advanced on average 5 and 11 days for wheat, and 7 and 14 days for maize (two climate model combinations). Full maturity was on average 10 and 17 days earlier for wheat, and 19 and 36 days earlier for maize. On the country level, contamination of wheat with deoxynivalenol decreased slightly, but not significantly. Variability between regions was large, and individual regions showed a significant increase in deoxynivalenol concentrations. For maize, an overall decrease in deoxynivalenol contamination was projected, which was significant for one climate model combination, but not significant for the other one. In general, results disagree with previous reported expectations of increased feed and food safety hazards under climate change. This study illustrated the relevance of using quantitative models to estimate the impacts of climate change effects on food safety, and of considering both direct and indirect effects when assessing climate change impacts on crops and related food safety hazards."
https://openalex.org/W2042027491,"Geminin is an important regulator of proliferation and differentiation in metazoans, which predominantly inhibits the DNA replication licensing factor Cdt1, preventing genome over-replication. We show that Geminin preferentially forms stable coiled-coil heterodimers with its homologue, Idas. In contrast to Idas-Geminin heterodimers, Idas homodimers are thermodynamically unstable and are unlikely to exist as a stable macromolecule under physiological conditions. The crystal structure of the homology regions of Idas in complex with Geminin showed a tight head-to-head heterodimeric coiled-coil. This Idas-Geminin heterodimer binds Cdt1 less strongly than Geminin-Geminin, still with high affinity (∼30 nm), but with notably different thermodynamic properties. Consistently, in Xenopus egg extracts, Idas-Geminin is less active in licensing inhibition compared with a Geminin-Geminin homodimer. In human cultured cells, ectopic expression of Idas leads to limited over-replication, which is counteracted by Geminin co-expression. The properties of the Idas-Geminin complex suggest it as the functional form of Idas and provide a possible mechanism to modulate Geminin activity."
https://openalex.org/W2134345633,"Purpose Iron deposition has been shown to occur following myocardial infarction (MI). We investigated whether such focal iron deposition within chronic MI lead to electrical anomalies. Methods Two groups of dogs (ex-vivo (n = 12) and in-vivo (n = 10)) were studied at 16 weeks post MI. Hearts of animals from ex-vivo group were explanted and sectioned into infarcted and non-infarcted segments. Impedance spectroscopy was used to derive electrical permittivity () and conductivity (). Mass spectrometry was used to classify and characterize tissue sections with (IRON+) and without (IRON-) iron. Animals from in-vivo group underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) for estimation of scar volume (late-gadolinium enhancement, LGE) and iron deposition (T2*) relative to left-ventricular volume. 24-hour electrocardiogram recordings were obtained and used to examine Heart Rate (HR), QT interval (QT), QT corrected for HR (QTc) and QTc dispersion (QTcd). In a fraction of these animals (n = 5), ultra-high resolution electroanatomical mapping (EAM) was performed, co-registered with LGE and T2* CMR and were used to characterize the spatial locations of isolated late potentials (ILPs). Results Compared to IRON- sections, IRON+ sections had higher, but no difference in. A linear relationship was found between iron content and (p<0.001), but not (p = 0.34). Among two groups of animals (Iron (<1.5%) and Iron (>1.5%)) with similar scar volumes (7.28%±1.02% (Iron (<1.5%)) vs 8.35%±2.98% (Iron (>1.5%)), p = 0.51) but markedly different iron volumes (1.12%±0.64% (Iron (<1.5%)) vs 2.47%±0.64% (Iron (>1.5%)), p = 0.02), QT and QTc were elevated and QTcd was decreased in the group with the higher iron volume during the day, night and 24-hour period (p<0.05). EAMs co-registered with CMR images showed a greater tendency for ILPs to emerge from scar regions with iron versus without iron. Conclusion The electrical behavior of infarcted hearts with iron appears to be different from those without iron. Iron within infarcted zones may evolve as an arrhythmogenic substrate in the post MI period."
https://openalex.org/W2042249109,"There has been a long history of using neural networks for combinatorial optimization and constraint satisfaction problems. Symmetric Hopfield networks and similar approaches use steepest descent dynamics, and they always converge to the closest local minimum of the energy landscape. For finding global minima additional parameter-sensitive techniques are used, such as classical simulated annealing or the so-called chaotic simulated annealing, which induces chaotic dynamics by addition of extra terms to the energy landscape. Here we show that asymmetric continuous-time neural networks can solve constraint satisfaction problems without getting trapped in non-solution attractors. We concentrate on a model solving Boolean satisfiability (k-SAT), which is a quintessential NP-complete problem. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the stable fixed points of the neural network and the k-SAT solutions and we present numerical evidence that limit cycles may also be avoided by appropriately choosing the parameters of the model. This optimal parameter region is fairly independent of the size and hardness of instances, this way parameters can be chosen independently of the properties of problems and no tuning is required during the dynamical process. The model is similar to cellular neural networks already used in CNN computers. On an analog device solving a SAT problem would take a single operation: the connection weights are determined by the k-SAT instance and starting from any initial condition the system searches until finding a solution. In this new approach transient chaotic behavior appears as a natural consequence of optimization hardness and not as an externally induced effect."
https://openalex.org/W2125005162,"P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is an ATP binding cassette transporter that effluxes a variety of structurally diverse compounds including anticancer drugs. Computational models of human P-gp in the apo- and nucleotide-bound conformation show that the adenine group of ATP forms hydrogen bonds with the conserved Asp-164 and Asp-805 in intracellular loops 1 and 3, respectively, which are located at the interface between the nucleotide binding domains and transmembrane domains. We investigated the role of Asp-164 and Asp-805 residues by substituting them with cysteine in a cysteine-less background. It was observed that the D164C/D805C mutant, when expressed in HeLa cells, led to misprocessing of P-gp, which thus failed to transport the drug substrates. The misfolded protein could be rescued to the cell surface by growing the cells at a lower temperature (27 °C) or by treatment with substrates (cyclosporine A, FK506), modulators (tariquidar), or small corrector molecules. We also show that short term (4-6 h) treatment with 15 μM cyclosporine A or FK506 rescues the pre-formed immature protein trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum in an immunophilin-independent pathway. The intracellularly trapped misprocessed protein associates more with chaperone Hsp70, and the treatment with cyclosporine A reduces the association of mutant P-gp, thus allowing it to be trafficked to the cell surface. The function of rescued cell surface mutant P-gp is similar to that of wild-type protein. These data demonstrate that the Asp-164 and Asp-805 residues are not important for ATP binding, as proposed earlier, but are critical for proper folding and maturation of a functional transporter."
https://openalex.org/W2102509975,"Background Folklore remedies for pain and inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis include the application of magnets and copper to the skin. Despite the popular use of devices containing magnets or copper for this purpose, little research has been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of such treatments. Objective To investigate whether the practice of wearing magnetic wrists straps, or copper bracelets, offers any specific therapeutic benefit for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Design Randomised double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial. Methods 70 patients, aged 33 to 79 years and predominantly female (n = 52), with painful rheumatoid arthritis were recruited from general practices within Yorkshire. Participants were randomly allocated to wear four devices in a different order. Devices tested were: a standard (1502 to 2365 gauss) magnetic wrist strap, a demagnetised (<20 gauss) wrist strap, an attenuated (250 to 350 gauss) magnetic wrist strap, and a copper bracelet. Devices were each worn for five weeks, with treatment phases being separated by one week wash-out periods. The primary outcome measured was pain using a 100 mm visual analogue scale. Secondary pain measures were the McGill Pain Questionnaire and tender joint count. Inflammation was assessed using C-reactive protein and plasma viscosity blood tests and by swollen joint count. Physical function was assessed using the Health Assessment Questionnaire (Disability Index). Disease activity and medication use was also measured. Results 65 participants provided complete self-report outcome data for all devices, four participants provided partial data. Analysis of treatment outcomes did not reveal any statistically significant differences (P>0.05) between the four devices in terms of their effects on pain, inflammation, physical function, disease activity, or medication use. Conclusions Wearing a magnetic wrist strap or a copper bracelet did not appear to have any meaningful therapeutic effect, beyond that of a placebo, for alleviating symptoms and combating disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis.

https://openalex.org/W2042757700,"Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)-regulated chemotaxis plays critical roles in various physiological and pathophysiological conditions. S1P-regulated chemotaxis is mediated by the S1P family of G-protein-coupled receptors. However, molecular details of the S1P-regulated chemotaxis are incompletely understood. Cultured human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines abundantly express S1P receptor subtype 3 (S1P3), thus providing a tractable in vitro system to characterize molecular mechanism(s) underlying the S1P3 receptor-regulated chemotactic response. S1P treatment enhances CD44 expression and induces membrane localization of CD44 polypeptides via the S1P3/Rho kinase (ROCK) signaling pathway. Knockdown of CD44 completely diminishes the S1P-stimulated chemotaxis. Promoter analysis suggests that the CD44 promoter contains binding sites of the ETS-1 (v-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog 1) transcriptional factor. ChIP assay confirms that S1P treatment stimulates the binding of ETS-1 to the CD44 promoter region. Moreover, S1P induces the expression and nuclear translocation of ETS-1. Knockdown of S1P3 or inhibition of ROCK abrogates the S1P-induced ETS-1 expression. Furthermore, knockdown of ETS-1 inhibits the S1P-induced CD44 expression and cell migration. In addition, we showed that S1P3/ROCK signaling up-regulates ETS-1 via the activity of JNK. Collectively, we characterized a novel signaling axis, i.e., ROCK-JNK-ETS-1-CD44 pathway, which plays an essential role in the S1P3-regulated chemotactic response."
https://openalex.org/W2003341197,"Leptin is an adipokine that is thought to be important in many inflammatory diseases, and is known to influence the function of several leukocyte types. However, no clear consensus is present regarding the responsiveness of neutrophils for this adipokine. In this study a 2D DIGE proteomics approach was used as an unbiased approach to identify leptin-induced effects on neutrophils. Additionally chemotaxis and survival experiments were performed to reproduce results from literature showing putative effects of leptin on these neutrophil responses. Leptin did not induce any significant changes in the proteome provided leptin was added at physiologically relevant concentrations (250 ng). Our leptin batches were biologically active as they induced proliferation in LeptinR expressing Ba/F3 cells. At high concentrations (25000 ng) leptin induced a change in neutrophil proteome. Seventeen differently regulated spots were identified of which twelve could be characterized by mass spectrometry. Two of these identified proteins, SerpinB1 and p40 phox, were chosen for further analysis but leptin-induced expression analyzed by western blot were highly variable. Additionally leptin also induced neutrophil survival at these high concentrations. No leptin-induced chemotaxis of human neutrophils was detected at any concentration. In conclusion, physiological concentrations of leptin do not affect neutrophils. High leptin concentrations induced survival and changes in the neutrophils proteome, but this was most likely mediated by an indirect effect. However, it cannot be ruled out that the effects were mediated by a yet not-identified leptin receptor on human neutrophils."
https://openalex.org/W2004238754,"Introduction This study aimed to assess the top-down control of sound processing in the auditory brainstem of rats. Short latency evoked responses were analyzed after unilateral or bilateral ablation of auditory cortex. This experimental paradigm was also used towards analyzing the long-term evolution of post-lesion plasticity in the auditory system and its ability to self-repair. Method Auditory cortex lesions were performed in rats by stereotactically guided fine-needle aspiration of the cerebrocortical surface. Auditory Brainstem Responses (ABR) were recorded at post-surgery day (PSD) 1, 7, 15 and 30. Recordings were performed under closed-field conditions, using click trains at different sound intensity levels, followed by statistical analysis of threshold values and ABR amplitude and latency variables. Subsequently, brains were sectioned and immunostained for GAD and parvalbumin to assess the location and extent of lesions accurately. Results Alterations in ABR variables depended on the type of lesion and post-surgery time of ABR recordings. Accordingly, bilateral ablations caused a statistically significant increase in thresholds at PSD1 and 7 and a decrease in waves amplitudes at PSD1 that recover at PSD7. No effects on latency were noted at PSD1 and 7, whilst recordings at PSD15 and 30 showed statistically significant decreases in latency. Conversely, unilateral ablations had no effect on auditory thresholds or latencies, while wave amplitudes only decreased at PSD1 strictly in the ipsilateral ear. Conclusion Post-lesion plasticity in the auditory system acts in two time periods: short-term period of decreased sound sensitivity (until PSD7), most likely resulting from axonal degeneration; and a long-term period (up to PSD7), with changes in latency responses and recovery of thresholds and amplitudes values. The cerebral cortex may have a net positive gain on the auditory pathway response to sound."
https://openalex.org/W2034960771,"R2 is a non-long terminal repeat retrotransposon that inserts site-specifically in the tandem 28S rRNA genes of many animals. Previously, R2 RNA from various species of Drosophila was shown to self-cleave from the 28S rRNA/R2 co-transcript by a hepatitis D virus (HDV)-like ribozyme encoded at its 5' end. RNA cleavage was at the precise 5' junction of the element with the 28S gene. Here we report that RNAs encompassing the 5' ends of R2 elements from throughout its species range fold into HDV-like ribozymes. In vitro assays of RNA self-cleavage conducted in many R2 lineages confirmed activity. For many R2s, RNA self-cleavage was not at the 5' end of the element but at 28S rRNA sequences up to 36 nucleotides upstream of the junction. The location of cleavage correlated well with the types of endogenous R2 5' junctions from different species. R2 5' junctions were uniform for most R2s in which RNA cleavage was upstream in the rRNA sequences. The 28S sequences remaining on the first DNA strand synthesized during retrotransposition are postulated to anneal to the target site and uniformly prime second strand DNA synthesis. In species where RNA cleavage occurred at the R2 5' end, the 5' junctions were variable. This junction variation is postulated to result from the priming of second strand DNA synthesis by chance microhomologies between the target site and the first DNA strand. Finally, features of R2 ribozyme evolution, especially changes in cleavage site and convergence on the same active site sequences, are discussed."

We confirmed the significance of the RANK-mediated signaling network in castration resistant clinical human prostate cancer (PC) tissues. In this report, we used a multispectral quantum dot labeling technique to label six RANK and c-Met convergent signaling pathway mediators simultaneously in formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue specimens, quantify the intensity of each expression at the sub-cellular level, and investigated their potential utility as predictors of patient survival in Caucasian-American, African-American and Chinese men. We found that RANKL and neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) expression predicts survival of Caucasian-Americans with PC. A Gleason score ≥ 8 combined with nuclear p-c-Met expression predicts survival in African-American PC patients. Neuropilin-1, p-NF-κB p65 and VEGF are predictors for the overall survival of Chinese men with PC. These results collectively support interracial differences in cell signaling networks that can predict the survival of PC patients."

In the late 1980s populations of Spectacled Flying-foxes (SFF) (Pteropus conspicillatus), a species confined, in Australia, to north Queensland became infected by paralysis tick (Ixodes holocyclus), resulting in mortality. This Pteropus-tick relationship was new to Australia. Curiously, the relationship was confined to several camps on the Atherton Tableland, north Queensland. It was hypothesised that an introduced plant, wild tobacco (Solanum mauritianum), had facilitated this new host-tick interaction. This study quantifies the impact of tick paralysis on SFF and investigates the relationship with climate. Retrospective analysis was carried out on records from the Tolga Bat Hospital for 1998–2010. Juvenile mortality rates were correlated to climate data using vector auto-regression. Mortality rates due to tick paralysis ranged between 11.6 per 10,000 bats in 2003 and 102.5 in 2009; more female than male adult bats were affected. Juvenile mortality rates were negatively correlated with the total rainfall in January to March and July to September of the same year while a positive correlation of these quarterly total rainfalls existed with the total population. All tick affected camps of SFF were located in the 80% core range of S. mauritianum. This initial analysis justifies further exploration of how an exotic plant might alter the relationship between a formerly ground-dwelling parasite and an arboreal host."
https://openalex.org/W2004107805,"Vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) transports monoamines into storage vesicles in a process that involves exchange of the charged monoamine with two protons. VMAT2 is a member of the DHA12 family of multidrug transporters that belongs to the major facilitator superfamily of secondary transporters. Tetrabenazine (TBZ) is a non-competitive inhibitor of VMAT2 that is used in the treatment of hyperkinetic disorders associated with Huntington disease and Tourette syndrome. Previous biochemical studies suggested that the recognition site for TBZ and monoamines is different. However, the precise mechanism of TBZ interaction with VMAT2 remains unknown. Here we used a random mutagenesis approach and selected TBZ-resistant mutants. The mutations clustered around the lumenal opening of the transporter and mapped to either conserved proline or glycine, or to residues immediately adjacent to conserved proline and glycine. Directed mutagenesis provides further support for the essential role of the latter residues. Our data strongly suggest that the conserved α-helix breaking residues identified in this work play an important role in conformational rearrangements required for TBZ binding and substrate transport. Our results provide a novel insight into the mechanism of transport and TBZ binding by VMAT2."
https://openalex.org/W1979947618,"Hepatic aldose reductase (AR) expression is known to be induced in liver diseases, including hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the role of AR in the development of these diseases remains unclear. We performed this current study to determine whether and how AR might be involved in the development of diet-induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Our results showed that the level of AR protein expression was significantly higher in db/db mice fed the methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet than in mice fed the control diet. In parallel with the elevation in AR, steatohepatitis was observed in MCD diet-fed mice, and this diet-induced steatohepatitis was significantly attenuated by lentiviral-mediated knock-down of the AR gene. This suppressive effect of AR knock-down was associated with repressed levels of serum alanine aminotransferase and hepatic lipoperoxides, reduced mRNA and protein expression of hepatic cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), and decreased mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Moreover, AR-induced elevations on the level of CYP2E1 expression, reactive oxygen species, mRNA expression of TNF-α and IL-6 were confirmed in AML12 hepatocytes. Further, lentiviral-mediated knock-down of AR ameliorated MCD diet-induced collagen deposition in the livers of db/db mice. With the improvement in liver fibrosis, the mRNA levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), two genes involved in hepatic fibrogenesis, were found to be significantly suppressed, while TIMP-2 and MMP-13 were unaffected. Together these data indicate that inhibition of AR alleviates the MCD diet-induced liver inflammation and fibrosis in db/db mice, probably through dampening CYP2E1 mediated-oxidative stress and ameliorating the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines."
https://openalex.org/W1969418932,"Endothelin receptor A (ETA), a G protein-coupled receptor, mediates endothelin signaling, which is regulated by GRK2. Three Ser and seven Thr residues recently proven to be phosphoacceptor sites are located in the C-terminal extremity (CTE) of the receptor following its palmitoylation site. We created various phosphorylation-deficient ETA mutants. The phospholipase C activity of mutant receptors in HEK-293 cells was analyzed during continuous endothelin stimulation to investigate the impact of phosphorylation sites on ETA desensitization. Total deletion of phosphoacceptor sites in the CTE affected proper receptor regulation. However, proximal and distal phosphoacceptor sites both turned out to be sufficient to induce WT-like desensitization. Overexpression of the Gαq coupling-deficient mutant GRK2-D110A suppressed ETA-WT signaling but failed to decrease phospholipase C activity mediated by the phosphorylation-deficient mutant ETA-6PD. In contrast, GRK2-WT acted on both receptors, whereas the kinase-inactive mutant GRK2-D110A/K220R failed to inhibit signaling of ETA-WT and ETA-6PD. This demonstrates that ETA desensitization involves at least two autonomous GRK2-mediated components: 1) a phosphorylation-independent signal decrease mediated by blocking of Gαq and 2) a mechanism involving phosphorylation of Ser and Thr residues in the CTE of the receptor in a redundant fashion, able to incorporate either proximal or distal phosphoacceptor sites. High level transfection of GRK2 variants influenced signaling of ETA-WT and ETA-6PD and hints at an additional phosphorylation-independent regulatory mechanism. Furthermore, internalization of mRuby-tagged receptors was observed with ETA-WT and the phosphorylation-deficient mutant ETA-14PD (lacking 14 phosphoacceptor sites) and turned out to be based on a phosphorylation-independent mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2099793164,"UDP-N,N'-diacetylbacillosamine (UDP-diNAcBac) is a unique carbohydrate produced by a number of bacterial species and has been implicated in pathogenesis. The terminal step in the formation of this important bacterial sugar is catalyzed by an acetyl-CoA (AcCoA)-dependent acetyltransferase in both N- and O-linked protein glycosylation pathways. This bacterial acetyltransferase is a member of the left-handed β-helix family and forms a homotrimer as the functional unit. Whereas previous endeavors have focused on the Campylobacter jejuni acetyltransferase (PglD) from the N-linked glycosylation pathway, structural characterization of the homologous enzymes in the O-linked glycosylation pathways is lacking. Herein, we present the apo-crystal structures of the acetyltransferase domain (ATD) from the bifunctional enzyme PglB (Neisseria gonorrhoeae) and the full-length acetyltransferase WeeI (Acinetobacter baumannii). Additionally, a PglB-ATD structure was solved in complex with AcCoA. Surprisingly, this structure reveals a contrasting binding mechanism for this substrate when compared with the AcCoA-bound PglD structure. A comparison between these findings and the previously solved PglD crystal structures illustrates a dichotomy among N- and O-linked glycosylation pathway enzymes. Based upon these structures, key residues in the UDP-4-amino and AcCoA binding pockets were mutated to determine their effect on binding and catalysis in PglD, PglB-ATD, and WeeI. Last, a phylogenetic analysis of the aforementioned acetyltransferases was employed to illuminate the diversity among N- and O-linked glycosylation pathway enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2092374332,"Parkinsonian and essential tremor can often be effectively treated by deep brain stimulation. We propose a novel explanation for the mechanism by which this technique ameliorates tremor: a reduction of the delay in the relevant motor control loops via preferential antidromic blockade of slow axons. The antidromic blockade is preferential because the pulses more rapidly clear fast axons, and the distribution of axonal diameters, and therefore velocities, in the involved tracts, is sufficiently long-tailed to make this effect quite significant. The preferential blockade of slow axons, combined with gain adaptation, results in a reduction of the mean delay in the motor control loop, which serves to stabilize the feedback system, thus ameliorating tremor. This theory, without any tuning, accounts for several previously perplexing phenomena, and makes a variety of novel predictions."

Understanding risk factors of adult mortality is crucial towards designing appropriate public health interventions. In this paper we proposed a structured additive two-part random effects regression model for adult mortality data. Our proposal assumed two processes: (i) whether death occurred in the household (prevalence part), and (ii) number of reported deaths, if death did occur (severity part). The proposed model specification therefore consisted of two generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) with correlated random effects that permitted structured and unstructured spatial components at regional level. Specifically, the first part assumed a GLMM with a logistic link and the second part explored a count model following either a Poisson or negative binomial distribution. The model was used to analyse adult mortality data of 25,793 individuals from the 2006/2007 Namibian DHS data. Inference is based on the Bayesian framework with appropriate priors discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1989688084,"Privacy information is prone to be leaked by illegal software providers with various motivations. Privacy leak behavior has thus become an important research issue of cyber security. However, existing approaches can only qualitatively analyze privacy leak behavior of software applications. No quantitative approach, to the best of our knowledge, has been developed in the open literature. To fill this gap, in this paper we propose for the first time four quantitative metrics, namely, possibility, severity, crypticity, and manipulability, for privacy leak behavior analysis based on Privacy Petri Net (PPN). In order to compare the privacy leak behavior among different software, we further propose a comprehensive metric, namely, overall leak degree, based on these four metrics. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using real-world software applications. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach can quantitatively analyze the privacy leak behaviors of various software types and reveal their characteristics from different aspects."
https://openalex.org/W2089492870,"As demonstrated by the recent 2012/2013 flu epidemic, the continual emergence of new viral strains highlights the need for accurate medical diagnostics in multiple community settings. If rapid, robust, and sensitive diagnostics for influenza subtyping were available, it would help identify epidemics, facilitate appropriate antiviral usage, decrease inappropriate antibiotic usage, and eliminate the extra cost of unnecessary laboratory testing and treatment. Here, we describe a droplet sandwich platform that can detect influenza subtypes using real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rtRT-PCR). Using clinical samples collected during the 2010/11 season, we effectively differentiate between H1N1p (swine pandemic), H1N1s (seasonal), and H3N2 with an overall assay sensitivity was 96%, with 100% specificity for each subtype. Additionally, we demonstrate the ability to detect viral loads as low as 10(4) copies/mL, which is two orders of magnitude lower than viral loads in typical infected patients. This platform performs diagnostics in a miniaturized format without sacrificing any sensitivity, and can thus be easily developed into devices which are ideal for small clinics and pharmacies."

In order to determine the number of hsp90 gene copies and encoded proteins in fungal and animal lineages and through that key duplication events that this family has undergone, we collected and evaluated Hsp90 protein sequences and corresponding Expressed Sequence Tags and analyzed available genomes from various taxa. We provide evidence for duplication events affecting either single species or wider taxonomic groups. With regard to Fungi, duplicated genes have been detected in several lineages. In invertebrates, we demonstrate key duplication events in certain clades of Arthropoda and Mollusca, and a possible gene loss event in a hymenopteran family. Finally, we infer that the duplication event responsible for the two (a and b) isoforms in vertebrates occurred probably shortly after the split of Hyperoartia and Gnathostomata."
https://openalex.org/W2077004249,"Coal workers' pneumoconiosis (CWP) is characterized by chronic pulmonary inflammation and fibrotic nodular lesions that usually lead to progressive fibrosis. Inflammation is the first step in the development of CWP. E-selectin, an adhesion molecule, is involved in the development of various inflammatory diseases.We investigated the association between the functional polymorphisms in SELE and the risk of CWP in Han Chinese population. Three polymorphisms (T1880C/rs5355, T1559C/rs5368, A16089G/rs4786) in SELE were genotyped and analyzed in a case-control study with 697 CWP cases and 694 controls. The genotyping was based on the TaqMan method with the ABI 7900HT Real Time PCR system.The SELE rs5368 CT genotype was associated with a significantly increased risk of CWP (OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.02-1.60, P = 0.03) relative to the CC genotype. The statistical analysis of classification and regression tree (CART) and multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) were used to predict the interactions among risk factors of CWP. The MDR analysis found that the best interaction model was the two-factor model that contains pack-years smoked and SELE rs5368 genotypes. For non-smokers, the CART analysis showed an increased risk of CWP for carriers of the SELE rs_5368 variant genotype compared with the common genotype (OR = 1.51; 95% CI = 1.11-2.05, P = 0.0069).The results suggest that the T1559C/rs5368 polymorphism and smoking are involved in the susceptibility to CWP. Further studies are warranted to validate these findings."
https://openalex.org/W2085561415,"Single-site polymorphisms in human class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) products (HLA-B) have recently been shown to correlate with HIV disease progression or control. An identical single-site polymorphism (at residue 97) in the mouse class I product H-2Ld influences stability of the complex. To gain insight into the human polymorphisms, here we examined peptide binding, stability, and structures of the corresponding Ld polymorphisms, Trp97 and Arg97. Expression of LdW97 and LdR97 genes in a cell line that is antigen-processing competent showed that LdR97 was expressed at higher levels than LdW97, consistent with enhanced stability of self-peptide·LdR97 complexes. To further examine peptide-binding capacities of these two allelic variants, we used a high affinity pep-Ld specific probe to quantitatively examine a collection of self- and foreign peptides that bind to Ld. LdR97 bound more effectively than LdW97 to most peptides, although LdW97 bound more effectively to two peptides. The results support the view that many self-peptides in the Ld system (or the HLA-B system) would exhibit enhanced binding to Arg97 alleles compared with Trp97 alleles. Accordingly, the self-peptide·MHC-Arg97 complexes would influence T-cell selection behavior, impacting the T-cell repertoire of these individuals, and could also impact peripheral T cell activity through effects of self-peptide·Ld interacting with TCR and/or CD8.

Ultimately the MHC-associated control or progression of diseases is related to the presence of functional T cells that express TCRs that bind to antigenic (or self) peptide·MHC complexes. The presence of functional T cells, and the breadth of the TCR repertoire, is controlled both by thymic selection processes that occur during development of a T cell, and peripheral processes that regulate mature T cell activity (13.Morris G.P. Allen P.M. How the TCR balances sensitivity and specificity for the recognition of self and pathogens.Nat. Immunol. 2012; 13: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In the thymus, positive and negative selection operates on T cells through the αβ TCR and the CD4 and CD8 co-receptors. T cells that have TCRs with a low affinity for self-peptides presented on self-MHC molecules are positively selected, yet T cells that express TCRs with higher affinity for self-peptide·MHC complexes are clonally deleted (14.Daniels M.A. Teixeiro E.

Proteases, processing, and thymic selection (see comments).Science. 1998; 280: 394-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It is widely hypothesized that the diversity of peripheral T cells of an individual correlates with the effectiveness of the adaptive immune system in eliminating viral infections, and that the breadth of the TCR repertoire correlates in turn with the diversity of self-peptides presented by MHC alleles of the individual during development (17.Kosmrlj A.

Importantly, the peripheral regulatory processes are also influenced by interactions of T cells with self-pep·MHC complexes, which can control functional T cell activity by promoting the deletion or anergy of particular T cells (as reviewed in Refs. 21.Mueller D.L.

Zachary K.C. Zeeman B. Zhao M. The major genetic determinants of HIV-1 control affect HLA class I peptide presentation.Science. 2010; 330: 1551-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that these amino acid positions in HLA-B could contribute to disease control or progression by affecting the ability of either foreign peptides or self-peptides to bind the different alleles; the former could operate by inducing favorable immunity, and the latter could operate by influencing thymic selection (as reviewed in Ref. 24.Goulder P.J. Walker B.D. HIV and HLA class I. An evolving relationship.Immunity. 2012; 37: 426-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). However, biochemical and structural explanations for these effects remain unknown, and thus a mechanistic explanation of the polymorphisms is yet to be developed. The mouse MHC (known as H-2) represented the first system to reveal the properties of polymorphism and the process of T cell recognition that required MHC “restriction” of the antigen (25.Zinkernagel R.M.

Restriction of in vitro T cell-mediated cytotoxicity in lymphocytic choriomeningitis within a syngeneic or semiallogeneic system.Nature. 1974; 248: 701-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (1437) Google Scholar). The class I H-2 molecule Ld has been well studied and is known to exhibit lower stability than many other class I products such as Kb (26.Lie W.R. Myers N.B. Connolly J.M. Gorka J. Lee D.R.

Flow microfluorometric analysis of H-2L expression.J. Immunol. 1981; 127: 580-584PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, it appears that peptides that bind to Ld may be influenced by more of their individual residues than peptides that bind to Kb, which appear to have dominant anchor residues (31.Bowerman N.A. Colf L.A. Garcia K.C. Kranz D.M. Different strategies adopted by Kb and Ld to generate T cell specificity directed against their respective bound peptides.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 32551-32561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Relevant to recent information about HIV and HLA-B polymorphisms are previous studies showing that two alleles called Lq and Ld contained the same polymorphism at residue 97 as in the HLA-B studies, and these alleles exhibited differences in stability between the ternary complexes (peptide, H-2L heavy chain, and β2-microglobulin) (32.Smith R.A. Myers N.B. Robinson M. Hansen T.H. Lee D.R. Polymorphism at position 97 in MHC class I molecules affects peptide specificity, cell surface stability, and affinity for β2-microglobulin.J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 3105-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In an independent approach, the W97R substitution was identified in a “needle in a haystack” experiment in which more stable Ld mutants were identified because they conferred higher surface levels of the protein in a yeast display system (33.Jones L.L. Brophy S.E. Bankovich A.J. Colf L.A. Hanick N.A. Garcia K.C. Kranz D.M. Engineering and characterization of a stabilized α1/α2 module of the class I major histocompatibility complex product Ld.J.

Thus, completely different approaches have revealed the importance of position 97 in Ld stability. The crystal structures of Ld complexes with Trp (34.Balendiran G.K. Solheim J.C. Young A.C.

To examine more fully the hypotheses regarding the impact of the position 97 polymorphisms on peptide binding, here we introduced two variants, LdW97 and LdR97, into a mouse cell line and examined various aspects of peptide binding and stability of the complexes. The binding analysis was facilitated by the use of a high affinity, soluble TCR that was available against the specific peptide complex called QL9-Ld, allowing a quantitative assay of binding by a panel of peptides. The results showed that LdR97, compared with LdW97, conferred a greater average stability to peptide·Ld complexes and resulted in a broader repertoire of peptide binding from the panel of peptides. Each peptide tested showed preferential binding to one of the Ld variants, but most of them bound better to LdR97. The structures of several different peptides bound to one or the other Ld variants suggested that the Arg97 residue acts not by having increased flexibility itself, but by tolerating more side chain flexibility in the vicinity of the peptide and adjacent MHC residues, compared with Trp97. Overall, these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that many self-peptides will be presented at physiologically higher levels by an allele with Arg97, compared with an allele with Trp97. Thus, our results support the notion that Arg97 alleles exhibit a preference for a progressor phenotype in HIV patients because potentially effective T cells in these individuals have been deleted by negative selection in the thymus. It is also possible that these self-peptide·Arg97 allele complexes may be capable of driving enhanced peripheral T cell anergy (as reviewed in Ref. 21.Mueller D.L. Mechanisms maintaining peripheral tolerance.Nat. Immunol. 2010; 11: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). A derivative of BW5147, a mouse T cell thymoma (AKR mouse, H-2k), was used for the Ld studies because it is readily transduced by the pMP71 retroviral vector, and it is capable of normal antigen processing of self and foreign peptides (e.g. it is TAP sufficient). The BW5147 subline called 58−/− was used to generate Ld-transfectants, as described below. BW5147 and the hybridoma 30-5-7 that secretes an anti-Ld monoclonal antibody (against the α2 domain) were cultured in RPMI 1640 media containing 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The gene encoding the full-length murine MHC allele heavy chain LdW97, residues 1–338 with a 24-amino acid leader sequence, was cloned into retroviral vector pmp71 as a NotI-EcoRI fragment. The LdW97-pMP71 ligation product was obtained and a single-site mutation was made using the Stratagene QuikChange Lightning kit to generate a pMP71 construct containing the gene for LdR97. BW5147-LdW97 and BW5147-LdR97 cell lines were generated by retroviral transduction (38.Adams J.J. Narayanan S. Liu B. Birnbaum M.E. Kruse A.C. Bowerman N.A. Chen W. Levin A.M. Connolly J.M. Zhu C.

https://openalex.org/W2094125863,"A novel flavoprotein monooxygenase, trans-anethole oxygenase (TAO), from Pseudomonas putida JYR-1, which is capable of catalyzing the oxidation of trans-anethole to p-anisaldehyde, was heterologously expressed in E. coli and purified. Enzymatic kinetics of diverse substrates and cofactors revealed that TAO is likely to be a novel self-sufficient flavoprotein monooxygenase. Enzyme assays of GST-TAO demonstrated that TAO catalyzed a trans-anethole oxidation reaction without auxiliary component enzyme-like electron-transfer flavin reductases. The single component TAO had the ability to reduce flavin cofactors and simultaneously oxidize trans-anthole to p-anisaldehyde. In the processes of reduction of flavin and oxidation of trans-anethole, TAO accepted various flavin and NAD(P)H cofactors. TAO also catalyzed oxidation of isoeugenol, O-methyl isoeugenol, and isosafrole, all of which contain the 2-propenyl functional group on the aromatic ring structure with different catalytic efficiency. TAO had the greatest catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) with the original substrate, trans-anethole. Investigation about partially deleted mutants of TAO indicated that reductase active sites appeared to be located near the N terminal. Site directed mutagenesis studies also proved that the proposed flavin binding sites, Trp-38, Thr-43, Tyr-55, were critical for flavin reduction. However, disruption of any portion of TAO eliminated the oxygenase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2077644962,"We introduce the Conceal or Reveal Dilemma, in which individuals receive unfair benefits, and must decide whether to conceal or to reveal this unfair advantage. This dilemma has two important characteristics: it does not lend itself easily to cost-benefit analysis, neither to the application of any strong universal norm. As a consequence, it is ideally suited to the study of interindividual and intercultural variations in moral-economic norms. In this paper we focus on interindividual variations, and we report four studies showing that individuals cannot be swayed by financial incentives to conceal or to reveal, and follow instead fixed, idiosyncratic strategies. We discuss how this result can be extended to individual and cultural variations in the tendency to display or to hide unfair rewards."
