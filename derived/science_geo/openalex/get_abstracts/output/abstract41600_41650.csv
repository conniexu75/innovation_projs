https://openalex.org/W1569531441,"The modification reaction of 28 S rRNA in eukaryotic ribosomes by ricin A-chain was characterized. To examine whether ricin A-chain release any bases from 28 S rRNA, rat liver ribosomes were incubated with a catalytic amount of the toxin, and a fraction containing free bases and nucleosides was prepared from the postribosomal fraction of the reaction mixture by means of ion-exchange column chromatography. Thin-layer chromatographic analysis of this fraction revealed a release of 1 mol of adenine from 1 mol of ribosome. When the ribosomes or naked total RNAs were treated with ricin A-chain in the presence of [32P] phosphate, little incorporation of the radioactivity into 28 S rRNA was observed, indicating that the release is not mediated by phosphorolysis. Thus, considering together with the previous result (Endo, Y., Mitsui, K., Motizuki, M., and Tsurugi, K. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 5908-5912), the results in the present experiments demonstrated that ricin A-chain inactivates the ribosomes by cleaving the N-glycosidic bond of A4324 of 28 S rRNA in a hydrolytic fashion."
https://openalex.org/W1991445188,"We have isolated three genes (TPK1, TPK2, and TPK3) from the yeast S. cerevisiae that encode the catalytic subunits of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Gene disruption experiments demonstrated that no two of the three genes are essential by themselves but at least one TPK gene is required for a cell to grow normally. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequences of the TPK genes indicates conserved and variable domains. The carboxy-terminal 320 amino acid residues have more than 75% homology to each other and more than 50% homology to the bovine catalytic subunit. The amino-terminal regions show no homology to each other and are heterogeneous in length. The TPK1 gene carried on a multicopy plasmid can suppress both a temperature-sensitive ras2 gene and adenylate cyclase gene."
https://openalex.org/W2047193748,"The type 2 complement receptor, CR2, a B lymphocyte surface glycoprotein, is known to be a component of the EBV receptor. We now demonstrate that the major EBV outer membrane glycoprotein, gp350/220, is a highly specific ligand for CR2. EBV or beads coated with purified recombinant gp350/220 adsorb to normal B lymphocytes, cap with CR2, become endocytosed into vesicles, and are released into the cytoplasm. This is the first demonstration of herpesvirus glycoprotein-cell glycoprotein receptor interaction in viral adsorption and penetration. The capping of CR2 in response to virus, gp350/220-coated beads, or anti-CR2 monoclonal antibodies is associated with cocapping of surface immunoglobulin. Interaction between CR2 and surface immunoglobulin may be important in modulating the B cell activation that normally follows EBV infection or exposure to antigen."

https://openalex.org/W1519177607,"A radioactive photoactive dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, [3H]azidopine, was used to photoaffinity label plasma membranes of multidrug-resistant Chinese hamster lung cells selected for resistance to vincristine (DC-3F/VCRd-5L) or actinomycin D (DC-3F/ADX). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic fluorograms revealed the presence of an intensely radiolabeled 150-180-kDa doublet in the membranes from drug-resistant but not from the drug-sensitive parental (DC-3F) cells. A similar radiolabeled doublet was barely detected in a drug-sensitive partial revertant (DC-3F/ADX-U) cell line. The 150-180-kDa doublet exhibited a specific half-maximal saturable photolabeling at 1.07 X 10(-7) M [3H]azidopine. The dihydropyridine binding specificity was established by competitive blocking of specific photolabeling with nonradioactive azidopine as well as with nonphotoactive calcium channel blockers nimodipine, nitrendipine, and nifedipine. In addition, [3H]azidopine photolabeling was blocked by verapamil and diltiazem but was stimulated by excess prenylamine and bepridil suggesting a cross-specificity for up to four different classes of calcium channel blockers. The 150-180-kDa calcium channel blocker acceptor co-electrophoresed exactly with the 150-180-kDa surface membrane glycoprotein (gp150-180 or P-glycoprotein) Vinca alkaloid acceptor from multidrug-resistant cells and was immunoprecipitated by polyclonal antibody recognizing gp150-180. [3H]Azidopine photolabeling of the 150-180-kDa component in the presence of excess vinblastine was reduced over 90%, confirming the identity or close relationship of the calcium channel blocker acceptor and the gp150-180 Vinca alkaloid acceptor. The [3H]azidopine photolabeling of gp150-180 also was reduced by excess actinomycin D, adriamycin, or colchicine, demonstrating a broad gp150-180 drug recognition capacity. The ability of gp150-180 to recognize multiple natural product cytotoxic drugs as well as calcium channel blockers suggests a direct function for gp150-180 in the multidrug resistance phenomenon and a role in the circumvention of that resistance by calcium channel blockers."
https://openalex.org/W2170499910,"A negative-acting transcriptional regulatory factor encoded by bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1) was identified. This factor inhibits BPV-1-mediated transformation of mouse C127 cells; inhibition is BPV-1-specific and occurs only when the BPV-1 transforming genes are regulated by authentic transcriptional control elements. Plasmids expressing the inhibition function also repress E2 transactivation of the BPV-1 E2-dependent enhancer, and this repression is mediated by the same cis-acting element required for E2 transactivation. Inhibition of transformation may result from down-regulation of E2-dependent viral gene expression. Analysis of cDNA expressing the inhibition/repression activities mapped the function to the 3' domain of the E2 open reading frame. The E2 open reading frame thus encodes both positive and negative transcriptional regulatory factors, and these factors share a carboxy-terminal domain."
https://openalex.org/W1519718418,"Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) plays a major role in mammalian growth and regenerative processes as a mediator of many of the biological effects of growth hormone. We have demonstrated recently that the human IGF-I gene is transcribed and processed into distinct messenger RNA molecules, each of which directs the synthesis of unique IGF-I-containing peptides. As a means to determine whether a similar model of IGF-I gene organization and expression is the paradigm in mammals and as an initial step in devising experimental approaches to the study of regulation of IGF-I biogenesis, we have isolated and characterized the rat IGF-I gene. The rat gene, like its human counterpart, is very large, extending over at least 73 kilobases, and is composed of five exons subdivided by four introns. As in the human example, the rat IGF-I gene hybridizes to several messenger RNAs: 0.8-1.2, 1.6-2.1, and 7.8 kilobases. There is extensive nucleotide and amino acid sequence conservation between the two genes. The predicted mature rat IGF-I protein is identical to the human peptide in 67 of 70 residues. A comparably high degree of amino acid sequence identity is also found for both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal extension peptides, suggesting that, like mature IGF-I, the extension molecules may have physiological function."
https://openalex.org/W1488068148,"An approximately 16-kilobase pair region of the Bacillus subtilis chromosome at 55 degrees containing genes for de novo purine nucleotide synthesis (Piggot, P. J., and Hoch, J. A. (1985) Microbiol. Rev. 49, 158-179) was cloned. The nucleotide sequence of over 13 kilobase pairs indicates that this region contains a cluster of 12 genes, 11 of which encode enzymes that catalyze the 10 reactions for de novo purine nucleotide synthesis from 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate to IMP. The genes were identified by complementation of Escherichia coli pur mutants and by sequence comparisons with homologous enzymes. The cluster is likely an operon and is organized into three groups of overlapping genes followed by the last gene: purEKB-purC(orf)QLF-purMNH(J)-purD. Sequence comparisons provide evidence for homology of monofunctional purine nucleotide biosynthetic enzymes from B. subtilis with the corresponding multifunctional enzymes from yeast and Drosophila. Sequence alignment of the phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxylase heterodimer from B. subtilis with the monomeric enzyme from Methanobrevibacter smithii indicates an evolutionary relationship between these two enzymes. S1 nuclease analysis was used to map the mRNA 5′ and 3′ ends and to estimate levels of mRNA. These experiments indicate that synthesis of purine nucleotides is regulated independently by adenine and guanine nucleotides. Adenine nucleotides regulate transcription initiation. Guanine nucleotides regulate transcription by a termination-antitermination mechanism in a 242-nucleotide 5′ untranslated mRNA leader region. Groups of overlapping genes, regulated at least in part by transcription termination-antitermination is likely to be a common theme for genetic organization and regulation of biosynthetic genes in this Gram-positive organism."
https://openalex.org/W1689925871,"Transport of the precursor to the ADP/ATP carrier from the cytosol into the mitochondrial inner membrane was resolved into several consecutive steps. The precursor protein was trapped at distinct stages of the import pathway and subsequently chased to the mature form. In a first reaction, the precursor interacts with a protease-sensitive component on the mitochondrial surface. It then reaches intermediate sites in the outer membrane which are saturable and where it is protected against proteases. This translocation intermediate can be extracted at alkaline pH. We suggest that it is anchored to the membrane by a so far unknown proteinaceous component. The membrane potential delta psi-dependent entrance of the ADP/ATP carrier into the inner membrane takes place at contact sites between outer and inner membranes. Completion of translocation into the inner membrane can occur in the absence of delta psi. A cytosolic component which is present in reticulocyte lysate and which interacts with isolated mitochondria is required for the specific binding of the precursor to mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1582749228,"Cholesterol efflux from cultured cells can be mediated through binding of high density lipoprotein (HDL) to a cell-surface site which shows many characteristics of a biological receptor. To determine whether a specific protein forms a component of this site, cell membrane proteins were analyzed by ligand blotting using 125I-HDL3. Results demonstrated that membranes from a number of cell types possess a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 110 kDa that binds HDL and apoA-I and apoA-II proteoliposomes, but not low density lipoprotein, acetylated low density lipoprotein, or apoE proteoliposomes. The binding activity of this protein was increased by loading cells with cholesterol and was abolished by trypsin treatment of intact cell monolayers. These results suggest that HDL binds with specificity to a cell-surface protein which is regulated by intracellular cholesterol levels. Since HDL binding to intact cell monolayers shows the same characteristics, the 110-kDa binding protein may represent the proposed HDL receptor that functions to facilitate transport of cholesterol from cells to HDL particles."
https://openalex.org/W1573804402,"cDNA clones for rat acyl-CoA oxidase were isolated. The 3.8-kilobase mRNA sequence of the enzyme was completely covered by two overlapping clones. The composite cDNA sequence consisted of 3741 bases and contained a 1983-base open reading frame which encodes a polypeptide of 661 amino acid residues. Two species of acyl-CoA oxidase cDNA were identified. They differed in their coding nucleotide sequences, only within a small region. They contained the same number of nucleotides and can be translated in a common reading frame. They are 55% and 50% homologous in the above region at the nucleotide and the amino acid levels, respectively. Both types of cDNA were isolated from a library constructed from mRNA of a single rat, thereby suggesting the occurrence of two species of acyl-CoA oxidase in each rat. The amino terminus of the enzyme was determined to be N-acetylmethionine, which corresponds to the initiator methionine, thus confirming the absence of a terminal presequence. We reported previously that a purified preparation of the enzyme contained three polypeptide components, A, B, and C, and suggested that components B and C are produced by a proteolytic cleavage of component A (Osumi, T., Hashimoto, T., and Ui, N. (1980) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 87, 1735-1746). We located components B and C on the amino- and the carboxyl-terminal sides of component A. Possible functional significances of several stretches of amino acids of the enzyme are discussed, based on the sequence comparison data between rat and yeast acyl-CoA oxidases."
https://openalex.org/W1592916130,"The topological organization of the major rat liver gap junction protein has been examined in intact gap junctions and gap junction-derived single membrane structures. Two methods, low pH and urea at alkaline pH, were used to transform or double membrane gap junctions into single membrane structures. Low pH treatment transforms rat liver gap junctions into small single membrane vesicles which have an altered sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis profile after digestion with L-1-to-sylamido-2-phenylethylchloromethyl ketone-trypsin. Alkaline pH treatment in the presence of 8 M urea can split isolated rat liver gap junctions into single membrane sheets which have no detectable structural alteration or altered sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis profile after proteolytic digestion, suggesting that these single membrane sheets may be useful for topological studies of the gap junction protein. Proteolytic digestion studies have been used to localize the carboxyl terminus of the molecule on the cytoplasmic surface of the intact gap junction. However, the amino terminus does not appear to be accessible to proteases or to interaction with an antibody that is specific for the amino-terminal region of the molecule in intact or split gap junctions. Binding of antibodies, that block junctional channel conductance, can be eliminated by proteolytic digestion of intact gap junctions, suggesting that all antigenic sites for these antibodies are located on the cytoplasmic surface of the intact gap junction. In addition, calmodulin gel overlays indicate that at least two calmodulin binding sites exist on the cytoplasmic surface of the junctional protein. The information generated from these studies has been used to develop a low resolution two-dimensional model for the organization of the major rat liver gap junctional protein in the junctional membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1568172136,"Mouse glandular kallikreins are encoded by a family of closely linked genes which are located on chromosome 7 at a site corresponding to the genetically defined Tam-1, Prt-4, and Prt-5 loci. We have characterized 24 kallikrein genes by genomic cloning and restriction mapping of 310 kilobase pairs of BALB/c mouse DNA. Most of these genes are highly homologous, have the same exon/intron organization, and are linked in clusters of up to 11 genes. Partial sequence analysis of the kallikrein genes has facilitated identification of those members of the family for which protein sequence data exist and assignment of those which are pseudogenes or encode proteins of unknown function. We find that a maximum of 14 mouse kallikrein genes have the potential to encode functional proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2018808458,"An oocyte expression system was used to test the relation between a complementary DNA (cDNA) clone encoding the liver gap junction protein and cell-cell channels. Total liver polyadenylated messenger RNA injected into oocytes induced cell-cell channels between paired oocytes. This induction was blocked by simultaneous injection of antisense RNA transcribed from the gap junction cDNA. Messenger RNA selected by hybridization to the cDNA clone and translated in oocyte pairs yielded a higher junctional conductance than unselected liver messenger RNA. Cell-cell channels between oocytes were also formed when the cloned cDNA was expressed under the control of a heat-shock promoter. A concentration-dependent induction of channels was observed in response to injection with in vitro transcribed gap junction messenger RNA. Thus, the liver gap junction cDNA encodes a protein that is essential for the formation of functional cell-cell channels."
https://openalex.org/W1574370462,"cDNA clones of rat peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase were isolated. By blotting analysis using the cDNAs as probes, the mRNA for this enzyme was estimated to be about 1.9-kilobase pairs. Elevation of mRNA levels in the liver with administration of di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate was also evident. Sequencing analysis revealed 1,272 bases of the open reading frame which encoded 424 amino acid residues. Amino acid sequence data on six tryptic peptides and the amino terminus of the purified enzyme confirmed the cDNA sequence. The precursor of peroxisomal thiolase contains at its amino terminus a peptide extension of 26 residues. The mature enzyme is composed of 398 amino acids and the molecular weight is 41,074. The presequence has a net positive charge, lacks a long stretch of hydrophobic residues, and contains a cluster of serine residues. When the primary structure of the precursor was compared to structure of known peroxisomal proteins, there was no common homologous sequence. Peroxisomal thiolase exhibits a significant sequence homology with the mitochondrial thiolase. Possible location of the transport signal of the peroxisomal thiolase is discussed. Acyl-CoA binding sites were also located on primary structures of the two thiolases. The occurrence of interrupting sequences in several clones likely originates from intron sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1502498409,"Autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor on tyrosine residues and activation of the endogenous insulin receptor kinase is postulated to be a critical step in the mechanism of action of insulin. To investigate this hypothesis, the insulin-mimicking effects of vanadate (sodium orthovanadate) and H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide) alone and in combination were examined in freshly isolated rat adipocytes. Vanadate and H2O2 stimulated the translocation of insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) receptors to the plasma membrane of rat adipocytes in a manner analogous to insulin. IGF-II binding was increased by maximally effective doses of vanadate (1 mM), H2O2 (1 mM), and insulin (10 ng/ml) to 172 +/- 10, 138 +/- 12, and 289 +/- 16% of control, respectively. Previously (Kadota, S., Fantus, I. G., Hersh, B., and Posner, B. I. (1986) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 138, 174-178), we showed that the combination of these concentrations of vanadate plus insulin was not more potent than insulin alone. In this study, similar results were found with H2O2 plus insulin. In contrast, the combination of vanadate plus H2O2 was synergistic, effecting an increase of IGF-II binding to 488 +/- 23% of control. Amiloride inhibited the effects of vanadate, H2O2, and insulin. Adipocyte insulin receptors purified by wheat germ agglutinin chromatography were assayed for tyrosine kinase activity using the synthetic substrate poly(Glu,Tyr) (4:1). Basal activity (no in vitro insulin) was stimulated by exposure of intact cells to vanadate, H2O2, insulin, and vanadate + H2O2 to 147.7 +/- 4.3, 178.2 +/- 43.4, 495.0 +/- 67.1, and 913.2 +/- 92.0% of control, respectively. The stimulation of tyrosine kinase activity by these agents was accounted for by the insulin receptor as the augmented activity was completely immunoprecipitated with insulin receptor antibody. In these studies, the increase in IGF-II binding correlated significantly with the activation of the insulin receptor-tyrosine kinase (r = 0.927, p less than 0.001). These data support the hypothesis that activation of the insulin receptor kinase is linked to insulin action."
https://openalex.org/W1975146019,"Cell cycle-dependent histone genes are transcribed at a basal level throughout the cell cycle, with a three- to fivefold increase during early S phase. Protein-DNA interactions in the 5' promoter region of a cell cycle-regulated human H4 histone gene have been analyzed at single-nucleotide resolution in vivo. This region contains two sites, with four potential protein-binding domains, at which the DNA is protected from reaction with dimethyl sulfate in cells and from digestion with deoxyribonuclease I in nuclei. These protein-DNA interactions persist during all phases of the cell cycle and dissociate with 0.16 to 0.2M sodium chloride."
https://openalex.org/W2085301445,"Bovine papilloma virus (BPV) replicates as a multicopy nuclear plasmid in mouse fibroblasts. Using fluorescence activated cell sorting and mitotic selection procedures, we show that the replication of BPV occurs throughout S phase of the cell cycle and that replication is confined to S phase. After one round of chromosomal DNA replication, almost one quarter of BPV plasmids have replicated more than once, while a similar number of plasmids have not replicated at all. While multiple forms of BPV exist in the cell, all forms show the same pattern of replication. These results are consistent with a model in which BPV plasmids are chosen at random for replication throughout, and only during, S phase and support the view that the completion of S phase is a specifically activated event in the cell cycle rather than simply the end of one round of chromosomal DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W2086604490,"DNA containing breakpoints of two different t(7;9) chromosomal translocations was cloned from the T lymphoblastic tumor cell lines SUP-T1 and SUP-T3. Sequence analysis of DNA from the t(7;9)(q34;q34.3) translocation of SUP-T1 revealed that chromosome 9 DNA had recombined with DNA 5' to rearranged D-J regions in the beta T cell receptor gene of chromosome 7. Restriction analysis and hybridization studies using DNA fragments cloned from the t(7;9)(q34;32) translocation of SUP-T3 confirmed that beta T cell receptor DNA is also joined to the DNA of chromosome 9 in these cells. Using hybridization probes for the two breakpoints, several other cases of T lymphoblastic tumors were shown to possess DNA rearrangements near the 9q34.3 and 9q32 sites. Hybridization with the 9q34.3 probe detected multiple transcripts in SUP-T1 RNA and small amounts of larger transcripts in T cells lacking the t(7;9)(q34;q34.3) translocation. This work directly demonstrates that the beta T cell receptor locus may frequently be involved in chromosomal translocations within T lymphoblastic neoplasms."
https://openalex.org/W1992170617,"We describe the unusual structure of a vaccinia virus late mRNA. In these molecules, the protein-coding sequences of a major late structural polypeptide are preceded by long leader RNAs, which in some cases are thousands of nucleotides long. These sequences map to different regions of the viral genome and in one instance are separated from the late gene by more than 100 kb of DNA. Moreover, the leader sequences map either upstream or downstream of the late gene, are transcribed from either DNA strand, and are fused to the late gene coding sequence via a poly(A) stretch. This demonstrates that vaccinia virus produces late mRNAs by tagging the protein-coding sequences onto the 3′ end of other RNAs."

https://openalex.org/W1487756086,"Studies of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor biosynthesis and degradation have been limited by the lack of anti-receptor antibodies. In this study, peptides based on the cDNA-predicted amino acid sequence of the PDGF receptor were used to produce antisera that specifically immunoprecipitated the receptor. PDGF receptor biosynthesis was examined by pulse-chase labeling of cultured fibroblasts with [35S]methionine followed by immunoprecipitation. In BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts the receptor was synthesized as a 160-kDa precursor that was converted to a mature 180-kDa form within 30-45 min. Removal of high mannose oligosaccharides by endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H treatment reduced the apparent molecular weight of the 160-kDa precursor but did not affect the migration of the 180-kDa mature receptor. When mannosidase II was inhibited by swainsonine, the 160-kDa precursor failed to mature; instead a 168-kDa form of the receptor was observed. Nevertheless, swainsonine-treated cells responded mitogenically to PDGF. The mature 180-kDa form of the receptor had a half-life of approximately 3 h in the absence of ligand. Addition of PDGF reduced the receptor half-life to 45 min. These studies define and characterize a PDGF receptor precursor, show that receptor degradation is enhanced by PDGF, and demonstrate the functional integrity of incompletely processed PDGF receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2165738510,"We have previously cloned lethal(2)giant larvae, a tumor-suppressor gene of Drosophila that normally controls cell proliferation and/or differentiation in the optic centers of the brain and the imaginal discs. Here we describe the structure of the l(2)gl genes as determined by sequencing genomic and cDNA clones. The structure of the cDNAs indicates the use of alternative splicing, either in the 5' untranslated exons or in the 3' coding exons. Thus the gene encodes two putative proteins of 1161 and 708 amino acids, p127 and p78, respectively, differing at their C termini. A 3'-truncated l(2)gl transposon that leaves the coding sequence of p78 intact but deletes 141 residues of p127 was capable of suppressing tumor formation in l(2)gl-deficient animals. These results suggest that the putative p78 protein is effective in controlling cell proliferation and/or differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1492475114,"Abstract Overlapping genomic clones containing the entire sequence of the rat acyl-CoA oxidase gene were isolated and characterized. This gene spans about 25 kilobases, and there are 14 exons and 13 introns. All of the exon-intron junction sequences agree with the GT/AG rule. The results of Southern blot analyses indicated that the gene occurs once per haploid genome. In a preceding paper (Miyazawa, S., Hayashi, H., Hijikata, M., Ishii, N., Furuta, S., Kagamiyama, H., Osumi, T., and Hashimoto, T. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 8131-8137), we described the presence of two species of acyl-CoA oxidase mRNA which have different sequences, only in a small region. We identified two exons corresponding to this region. The above two mRNA species are produced by alternative splicing of these exons. Several mRNA cap sites were detected by S1 mapping and by the primer extension method. The principal one was mapped at 75 nucleotides upstream of the initiator methionine codon. The 5'-flanking region of the acyl-CoA oxidase gene was sequenced up to about 1300 nucleotides, upstream of the cap sites. There was neither a TATA box nor a typical CCAAT box sequence, at least up to nucleotide -500, rather, this region is G + C-rich (65%). GC box hexanucleotides (GGGCGG or CCGCCC) repeat six times in this region. Two of them, located nearest the cap sites, are in a complete 11-base pair direct repeat, 5'-GGGCGGGGCCG-3'. The features of the 5'-flanking sequence of this gene resemble those of the gene for rat enoyl-CoA hydratase:3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase bifunctional enzyme. The possible functional significance of the characteristic 5'-flanking sequence elements in the transcriptional regulation of acyl-CoA oxidase is given attention."

In tubulin dimers containing tyrosine at the carboxyl-terminal of their alpha subunit, phosphate was incorporated in that residue, and the phosphorylated protein did not assemble into polymers. In tubulin dimers lacking this tyrosine residue, phosphate was incorporated into different tyrosine residues located in other parts of the molecule, and the phosphoprotein retained its capacity to polymerize."
https://openalex.org/W1971981203,"To explore the mechanism and control of alternative splicing, we have characterized the products formed by splicing of SV40 early pre-mRNA in vitro and in vivo. Large T and small t mRNAs are derived from this precursor by joining alternative 5' splice sites to a single shared 3' splice site. In contrast to pre-mRNAs studied previously, we have shown that splicing to large T RNA involves the utilization of multiple lariat branch sites, while small t splicing uses a single branch site. Interestingly, the predominant branch sites utilized in splicing of large T RNA in vitro were found to differ in nuclear extracts from HeLa and human 293 cells, correlated with previously observed differences in the ratio of large T to small t mRNAs produced in the two cell types. To test the significance of this correlation, we examined the products formed by splicing of an SV40 early precursor microinjected into X. laevis oocytes. Strikingly, both the pattern of branch sites used in large T splicing and the ratio of large T to small t mRNAs produced were found to be identical to those observed in 293 cells and extracts."
https://openalex.org/W1549928911,"The nature of the free radical species observed in the peroxide complex of yeast cytochrome c peroxidase is described for protein variants containing amino acid substitutions at Met-172 and Trp-51. As was the case with Met-172 mutations (Goodin, D.B., Mauk, A.G., and Smith, M. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 83, 1295-1299), Trp-51 can be substituted to give active enzyme. Phe-51-containing enzyme has a higher turnover rate than the original enzyme and exhibits an altered pH dependence. The properties of the isotropic and axial components (Hoffman, B.M., Roberts, J.E., Kang, C.H., and Margoliash, E. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 6556-6564; Hori, H., and Yonetani, T. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 349-355) of the EPR signal of the wild-type enzyme-peroxide complex, studied as a function of H2O2 stoichiometry, support proposals (Goodin et al. (1985) and Hori and Yonetani (1985), see above) that two distinct radical species are formed, and spin quantification shows that the isotropic radical is always formed in substoichiometric amounts. The peroxide complexes for proteins containing amino acid substitutions at either Met-172 or Trp-51 exhibit somewhat larger than normal levels of the isotropic radical signal. In addition, these mutants are unlike wild-type enzyme in that the axial EPR signal associated with the peroxide complex is seen only at 10 K and not at 90 K. Thus, neither amino acid can be considered to be the molecular species responsible for either radical signal, but both mutations appear to affect the physical properties of the axial signal representing the major radical species."

It also serves to anchor the spectrin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane via its association with ankyrin. We have isolated and largely sequenced the 17-kilobase murine Band 3 gene. We show that this gene is present in a single copy in the mouse genome and have identified and mapped the 19 intervening sequences. The locations of the intron/exon junctions in the Band 3 mRNA correlate with predicted structural features of the erythrocyte Band 3 protein structure and membrane topology. One of the introns within this gene contains a single copy of a murine Alu-type high dispersed sequence, in addition to several unusual tandemly repeated sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1488135609,"Abstract Enoyl-CoA hydratase:3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase bifunctional enzyme is a monomeric protein which catalyzes the second and the third reactions of the peroxisomal beta-oxidation system. We cloned the gene for this enzyme from rat genomic libraries. The gene spans about 31 kilobases and consists of seven exons and six introns. The transcription initiation site was located 24 nucleotides upstream of the initiator methionine codon, ATG, determined by S1 nuclease mapping and primer extension analysis. The 5'-flanking region of the gene lacks typical TATA and CCAAT sequences, but contains G + C-rich sequences, including one CCGCCC (GC box) and two related GC hexanucleotides. Some of the structural features of the 5'-flanking region of this gene are shared by the 5'-upstream sequence of the gene for acyl-CoA oxidase, which catalyzes the first reaction of the peroxisomal beta-oxidation system and is induced coordinately with the bifunctional enzyme. Southern blot analysis of rat genomic DNA indicates that the bifunctional enzyme gene occurs once per haploid genome. The amino acid sequence of the carboxyl-terminal region of the bifunctional enzyme exhibits a significant level of homology to the sequence of pig mitochondrial 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase. This region of the bifunctional enzyme is encoded mainly by the last exon (Exon VII) which codes for as much as 58% of the protein sequence. Based on the data plus our unpublished findings (N. Ishii, T. Osumi, and T. Hashimoto, unpublished data), we propose that the amino-terminal domain, which is principally encoded by Exons I-V, has enoyl-CoA hydratase activity, and the carboxyl-terminal one, which is mainly coded for by Exon VII, has a 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase function."
https://openalex.org/W2062183507,"The chromosome 14 inversion produces cytogenetic breakpoints at either end of the long arm of this chromosome. Previous studies have shown that a hybrid gene (designated IgT) consisting of an immunoglobulin VH gene segment and T cell receptor J alpha C alpha segments encompasses the telomeric breakpoint in SUP-T1, a cell line derived from a human T cell lymphoma. Here, we report that the centromeric breakpoint in SUP-T1 constitutes the reciprocal of a VH-J alpha join but involves gene segments different from those at the telomeric breakpoint. Therefore, chromosome inversion and IgT formation were mediated by two sequential VH-J alpha joining events. Moreover, sequences adjacent to the centromeric breakpoint detect a T-cell-specific RNA, encoded within the immunoglobulin VH locus, whose transcriptional activity may have facilitated the illegitimate VH-J alpha rearrangements."
https://openalex.org/W2076899783,"The molecular analysis of genes identified by mutations is a major problem in mammalian genetics. As a step toward this goal, preparative field inversion gel electrophoresis (FIGE) was used to selectively isolate clones from the environment of genetically linked markers, and to select a subset of these clones containing sequences next to specific restriction sites rare in mammalian DNA. This approach has been used to generate a library highly enriched in sequences closely linked to the cystic fibrosis marker met. One clone derived from the end of a Not I restriction fragment containing the met sequence was analyzed in detail and localized within a long range map to a position 300 kilobase pairs 5' of the metD sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1609933325,"Adenosine diphosphopyridoxal, the affinity labeling reagent specific for a lysyl residue in the nucleotide-binding site of several enzymes (Tagaya, M., and Fukui, T. (1986) Biochemistry 25, 2958-2964; Tamura, J. K., Rakov, R. D., and Cross R. L. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 4126-4133) was applied to adenylate kinase from rabbit muscle. Incubation of the enzyme with a low concentration of the reagent at 25 degrees C for 20 min followed by reduction by sodium borohydride resulted in rapid inactivation of the enzyme. Extrapolation to 100% loss of enzyme activity gave a value of 1.0 mol of the reagent per mol of enzyme. ADP, ATP, and MgATP almost completely protected the enzyme from inactivation, whereas AMP offered little retardation of the inactivation. Dilution of the inactivated enzyme which had not been treated with the reducing reagent led to restoration of enzyme activity. This reactivation was accelerated by ATP but not by AMP. Structural study of the labeled peptide showed that Lys21 is exclusively labeled by adenosine diphosphopyridoxal. These results suggest that the epsilon-amino group of Lys21 is located in the ATP-binding site of the enzyme, more specifically at or close to the subsite for the gamma-phosphate of the nucleotide."
https://openalex.org/W2417092591,"These studies were undertaken to determine the molecular events by which estradiol and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulate in ovarian granulosa cells the increase in the content of one of the regulatory subunits of cAMP-dependent protein kinase type II, RII51 (Mr = 51,000), and its electrophoretic variants RII51.5 (Mr = 51,500) and RII52 (Mr = 52,000). To analyze the de novo synthesis of RII51/52, granulosa cells were cultured (10(6) cells/ml) for 0, 12, 24, or 48 h with estradiol (10 nM) +/- FSH (12.5, 25, and 50 ng/ml), 8-bromo-cAMP (0.25-3 mM), or forskolin (0.5-100 microM) and then pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine (300 microCi/ml; 4 h). Labeled RII51, present either in urea extracts of total cellular protein or after partial purification from a soluble cell extract by cAMP-Sepharose chromatography, was quantitated by autoradiography of two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels and by excision of the silver-stained spots of the RII51 variants from the gels and counting. Synthesis of RII51 and its electrophoretic variants was low in cells cultured with estradiol alone for 48 h, whereas it was increased 4-5-fold in cells cultured with estradiol and FSH. Changes in the synthesis of actin were minor throughout the culture period regardless of hormone treatment. Pulse-chase experiments using [35S]methionine provided evidence that the isoelectric variants RII51.5 and RII52 may be derived from RII51 by post-translation modification, such as phosphorylation. Labelling with [32P]orthophosphate showed that RII52 contained more radioactivity than RII51.5 and RII51. Northern and filter hybridization assays demonstrated a 6-10-fold dose- and time-dependent increase in the amount of RII51 mRNA in granulosa cells exposed to estradiol and FSH or estradiol and forskolin compared to those cultured with estradiol alone. In vitro translation of poly(A)+ mRNA of granulosa cells from estradiol- and FSH-treated hypophysectomized rats also demonstrated an increase in the content of translatable RII51 mRNA. These studies indicate that in cultured rat granulosa cells the synthesis of RII51 and the content of its mRNA are selectively increased by estradiol and cAMP in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Based on these observations, RII51 appears to be a useful marker to determine the molecular (genomic?) sites of estradiol and FSH action in differentiating rat granulosa cells."
https://openalex.org/W2147635650,"The v-sis oncogene encodes a platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-related product whose transforming activity is mediated by its functional interaction with the PDGF receptor. PDGF, as well as processed forms of the v-sis gene product, is a disulfide-linked dimer with eight conserved cysteine residues in the minimum region necessary for biologic activity. Site-directed mutagenesis of the v-sis gene revealed that each conserved cysteine residue was required directly or indirectly for disulfide-linked dimer formation. However, substitution of serine for cysteine codons at any of four positions had no detrimental effect on transforming activity of the encoded v-sis protein. These results establish that interchain disulfide bonds are not essential in order for this protein to act as a functional ligand for the PDGF receptor. The remaining four substitutions of serine for cysteine each inactivated transforming function of the molecule. In each case this was associated with loss of a conformation shown to involve intramolecular disulfide bonds. These studies provide insight into the role of individual cysteine residues in determining the structure of the sis/PDGF molecule critical for biological activity."
https://openalex.org/W1552198120,"The dnaB protein of Escherichia coli, a multifunctional DNA-dependent ribonucleotide triphosphatase and dATPase, cross-links to ATP on ultraviolet irradiation under conditions that support rNTPase and dATPase activities of dnaB protein. The covalent cross-linking to ATP is specifically inhibited by ribonucleotides and dATP. Tryptic peptide mapping demonstrates that ATP cross-links to only the 33-kDa tryptic fragment (Fragment II) of dnaB protein. The presence of single-stranded DNA alters the covalent labeling of dnaB protein by ATP, suggesting a possible role of DNA on the mode of nucleotide binding by dnaB protein. Present studies demonstrate that the dnaC gene product binds ribonucleotides independent of dnaB protein. On dnaB-dnaC protein complex formation, covalent incorporation of ATP to dnaB protein decreases approximately 70% with a concomitant increase of ATP incorporation to dnaC protein by approximately 3-fold. The mechanism of this phenomenon has been analyzed in detail by titrating dnaB protein with increasing amounts of dnaC protein. The binding of dnaC protein to dnaB protein appears to be a noncooperative process. The lambda P protein, which interacts with dnaB protein in the bacteriophage lambda DNA replication, does not bind ATP in the presence or absence of dnaB protein. However, lambda P protein enhances the covalent incorporation of ATP to dnaB protein approximately 4-fold, suggesting a direct physical interaction between lambda P and dnaB proteins with a probable change in the modes of nucleotide binding to dnaB protein. The lambda P protein likely forms a lambda P-dnaB-ATP dead-end ternary complex. The implications of these results in the E. coli and bacteriophage lambda chromosomal DNA replication are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1569544376,"The entire proton NMR spectrum of the aminoglycoside antibiotic neomycin B has been assigned at physiological pH by a combination of two-dimensional J-resolved and J-correlated and nuclear Overhauser enhancement difference spectroscopy. Unambiguous assignment of all four ring systems is possible without recourse to model or derivative compounds by observing nuclear Overhauser enhancements between as well as within rings. The subsequent assignment of the carbon 13 spectrum is simply achieved using two-dimensional heteronuclear J-correlated techniques. The proton NMR spectrum of a sonicated aqueous dispersion of the intracellular second messenger precursor phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate is reported for the first time. The spectrum is consistent with a high degree of side chain unsaturation and a conformation for the myo-inositol head group, which appears highly mobile, in which all bulky substituents are equatorial (except the 2-hydroxyl). Addition of aliquots of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to an aqueous buffered solution of neomycin B induces complex changes in the whole spectrum of the latter, including downfield shifts of differential magnitude for several well-resolved signals, viz. the anomerics, and the pair of methylene protons of the substituted cyclohexane. The complexation kinetics are fast on the NMR time scale at 25 degrees C. The binding results are discussed in terms of a tentative complexation geometry."
https://openalex.org/W1600342641,"Flavin adenine dinucleotide synthetase (ATP:FMN adenylyltransferase, EC 2.7.7.2) was purified about 10,000-fold from the high-speed supernatant of rat liver by a sequence of ammonium sulfate fractionation and column chromatographies on DEAE-Sephadex (A-50), chromatofocusing, FMN-agarose affinity, and Sephadex G-200. The specific activity of the purified enzyme was 133 units (nanomoles of FAD formed per min at 37 degrees C)/mg of protein. This preparation was free from contaminating FAD pyrophosphatase. The apparent molecular weight was estimated to be 97,000 by gel filtration on Sephadex G-200. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed an apparent subunit molecular weight of 53,000. Hence, the enzyme is a dimer of approximately 100,000. The enzyme was found most active at pH 7.1, requires Mg2+, and is essentially irreversible in the direction of FAD formation. Kinetic analysis gave Km values of 9.6 microM for FMN and 53 microM for ATP."
https://openalex.org/W2099021047,"cAMP binds to Dictyostelium discoideum surface receptors and induces a transient activation of adenylatecyclase, which is followed by desensitization. cAMP also induces a loss of detectable surface receptors (down-regulation). Cells were incubated with constant cAMP concentrations, washed free of cAMP, and cAMP binding to surface receptors and cAMP-induced activation of adenylate cyclase were measured. cAMP could induce maximally 65% loss of binding activity and complete desensitization of cAMP-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. Half-maximal effects for down-regulation were observed at 50 nM cAMP and for desensitization at 5 nM cAMP. Down-regulation was rapid with half-times of 4, 2.5, and 1 min at 0.1, 1, and 10 microM cAMP, respectively. Similar kinetic data have been reported for desensitization (Dinauer, M.C., Steck, T.L., and Devreotes, P.N. (1980) J. Cell Biol. 86, 554-561). Down-regulation and desensitization were not reversible at 0 degrees C. Down-regulation reversed slowly at 20 degrees C with a half-time of about 1 h. Resensitization of adenylate cyclase was biphasic showing half-times of 4 min and about 1 h, respectively; the contribution of the rapidly resensitizing component was diminished when down-regulation of receptors was enhanced. These results suggest that cAMP-induced down-regulation of receptors and desensitization of adenylate cyclase stimulation proceed by at least two steps. One step is rapidly reversible, occurs at low cAMP concentrations, and induces desensitization without down-regulation, while the second step is slowly reversible, requires higher cAMP concentrations, and also induces down-regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1615555718,"A role of the hinge protein is studied in the electron transfer reaction between cytochromes c1 and c, using highly purified one-band cytochrome c1 and two-band cytochrome c1. The results show that the hinge protein (Hp), which is essential for a stable ionic strength-sensitive c1-Hp-c complex, seems to play a certain role in electron transfer between cytochromes c1 and c; Keq for electron transfer reaction between cytochromes c1 and c in the presence of the hinge protein is found to be about 40% higher than that in the absence of the hinge protein at low ionic strength, but no difference exists at high ionic strength. We propose a hypothesis that the hinge protein may function as regulator for the electron transfer reaction between cytochromes c1 and c, and this may be at least one of the roles of the hinge protein in mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1486405406,"A mutant of Escherichia coli with defective Na+/H+ antiporter was isolated. The rationale for its isolation was that cells possessing defective Na+/H+ antiporter, which is essential for establishment of a Na+ gradient, could not grow with a carbon source that was taken up with Na+. The mutant had no appreciable Na+/H+ antiporter activity, but its K+/H+ antiporter and Ca2+/H+ antiporter activities were normal. Judging from the reversion frequency, the defect seems to be due to a single mutation. The mutant could not grow at alkaline pH. Therefore, the Na+/H+ antiporter, but not the K+/H+ antiporter or the Ca2+/H+ antiporter, seems to be responsible for pH regulation in alkaline medium. This mutant will be useful for cloning the Na+/H+ antiporter gene and for detection of Na+-substrate cotransport systems."
https://openalex.org/W1602109699,"The primary structure of the Hypoderma lineatum collagenase was determined. Chymotrypsin digestion and thermolysin fragmentation of the chymotryptic core gave 30 and 5 peptides, respectively, accounting for all the residues of the protein. These peptides were aligned with overlapping peptides derived from tryptic and Staphylococcus aureus V8 proteinase digests. Hypoderma collagenase is a serine proteinase composed of 230 amino acids (Mr 25,223). It displays a high degree of sequential homology with the serine proteinases of the trypsin family, especially with another collagenolytic enzyme, the proteinase I of the crab Uca pugilator. The six half-cystinyl residues of Hypoderma collagenase correspond to 6 of the 10 half-cystinyl residues of chymotrypsin, and the residues forming the charge-relay system of the active site of chymotrypsin (His-57, Asp-102, and Ser-195) are found in corresponding regions. The prediction of the secondary structure of the collagenase is given."
https://openalex.org/W2143064311,"The gene YEF-3 encoding the elongation factor 3 (EF-3) for peptide chain elongation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been isolated by immunoscreening of a yeast genomic library in the phage lambda gt11. The identity of the EF-3 gene was confirmed by several methods. First, a clone-encoded protein could affinity purify the antibody that specifically reacted with EF-3. Second, a recombinant fusion protein, which reacted with anti-beta-galactosidase antibody as well as with anti-EF-3 antibody, was found in the lysate of a positive clone lysogen. Third, the function of EF-3 in a yeast mutant in which the EF-3 activity is temperature-sensitive in an in vitro assay could be complemented by transformations. EF-3 protein was overproduced in a transformant which contained the EF-3 gene on a multicopy plasmid YEp-13. Southern blot analysis shows that YEF-3 is a single copy gene. The transcript unit as mapped by S1 nuclease mapping, is consistent with the size of the message determined by Northern blot analysis and shows no evidence of introns."
https://openalex.org/W1587748294,"The adrenergic regulation of cyclic GMP in isolated pinealocytes was investigated. In this cell, norepinephrine stimulates cyclic GMP and cyclic AMP greater than 100-fold by activating both alpha 1- and beta-adrenoceptors. beta-Adrenergic activation is a requisite event and is potentiated by alpha 1-adrenergic activation (Vanecek, J., Sugden, D., Weller, J. L., and Klein, D. C. (1985) Endocrinology 116, 2167-2173). The current study found that cholera toxin could substitute for beta-adrenergic agonists in stimulating pinealocyte cyclic GMP content, as has been found to be the case for cyclic AMP. Treatment with cholera toxin alone (1 microgram/ml for 90 min) had a small effect (2- to 4-fold increase) on cyclic GMP; addition of the alpha 1-adrenergic agonists, phenylephrine, cirazoline, or methoxamine to cholera toxin-treated cells rapidly (peak at 5 min) caused a further 30- to 300-fold increase. The alpha 1-adrenergic agonists had little effect by themselves at concentrations which potentiated the effects of cholera toxin. The potentiating effect of phenylephrine was inhibited nearly completely by an alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist, but not by either an alpha 2- or beta-adrenergic antagonist. The purified cholera toxin subunits A and B did not stimulate cyclic GMP either alone or in the presence of phenylephrine. Furthermore, the potentiating action of phenylephrine was observed following 90 min but not 20 min of cholera toxin pretreatment. these results suggest that the regulation of cyclic GMP levels in the pineal gland involves an Ns-like GTP-binding regulatory protein. This is of interest because it is the first indication that cyclic GMP is regulated by such a GTP-binding protein in nonretinal tissue. It remains to be determined whether the mechanisms involved in the transmembrane regulation of cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP in any other tissue are similar."
https://openalex.org/W1606598383,"Inhibition of host protein synthesis after poliovirus infection has been suggested to be a consequence of the proteolytic degradation of a p220 polypeptide necessary to translate capped mRNAs. However, the synthesis of several adenovirus late proteins on capped mRNAs was resistant to poliovirus inhibition. Thus, the hexon protein was still made 8 h after poliovirus superinfection. The synthesis of other adenovirus proteins such as the fiber was much more sensitive to poliovirus-induced inhibition than the hexon, either in the absence or in the presence of guanidine. Detailed densitometric analyses clearly showed the differential behavior of several adenovirus late mRNAs to poliovirus shut-off of translation. This is striking in view of the fact that a common leader sequence in the 5' termini is present in the adenovirus late mRNAs. The use of 3-methyl quercetin, an inhibitor of poliovirus RNA synthesis (Castrillo, J. L., Vanden Berghe, D., and Carrasco, L. (1986) Virology 152, 219-227), showed that translation of several capped adenovirus mRNAs took place in poliovirus-infected cells after the synthesis of host proteins had ceased. The poliovirus mRNA and the adenovirus mRNA coding for the hexon protein are very efficient mRNAs and have a leader sequence of more than 740 and 250 nucleotides, respectively, with very rich secondary structures making it difficult to predict how the scanning model will operate on these two mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1560892725,"The behavior of mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors of rabbit kidney cytosol was investigated on two affinity gels: a new affinity matrix prepared with a 3-O-derivative of carboxymethyloxime deoxycorticosterone (deoxycorticosterone gel) and a gel linked to a 17 beta-dexamethasone derivative (dexamethasone gel). Deoxycorticosterone gel was highly specific, since it retained mineralocorticoid but not glucocorticoid receptors, and dexamethasone gel exhibited high selectivity for glucocorticoid receptors since it did not bind mineralocorticoid receptors. The use of these two matrices allowed separation of mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors and further characterization of each type of cytosolic receptors after its isolation. Cytosolic mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors stabilized by tungstate were found to have a Stokes radius of approximately 6 nm, as determined by high performance size exclusion chromatography and a sedimentation coefficient of approximately 9 S, determined on a glycerol density gradient containing tungstate, under either high or low salt conditions. The hydrodynamic parameters, binding characteristics, and specificity of mineralocorticoid receptors were the same in the untreated and dexamethasone gel-treated cytosol. Similarly glucocorticoid receptor characteristics remained unchanged after deoxycorticosterone gel treatment, indicating biochemical independence of cytosolic mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors. The [3H]aldosterone receptor complex eluted from deoxycorticosterone gel was recovered with a 30-40% yield and a purification factor of about 1000. Purified mineralocorticoid receptors had the same sedimentation coefficient as cytosolic mineralocorticoid receptors (9 S) but a different Stokes radius (4 versus 6 nm). The decrease in the Stokes radius of the purified mineralocorticoid receptors was probably due to the gel filtration method. These results indicate that the newly synthesized matrix specific for mineralocorticoid receptors constitutes a powerful tool for their extensive purification."
https://openalex.org/W1506728145,"Incubation of a crude rat liver plasma membrane preparation with [gamma-32P]ATP resulted in a rapid Mg2+-dependent incorporation of 32P into phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Preincubation of the membranes with cholera toxin under ADP-ribosylating conditions reduced the labeling of the polyphosphoinositides. This action of cholera toxin required NAD+ and guanine nucleotides, was dose-dependent with respect to cholera toxin, and could not be mimicked by cAMP. It therefore appears that ADP-ribosylation of the stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein of adenylate cyclase, or another G-protein, in rat liver plasma membranes affects the activity of enzymes in the polyphosphoinositide pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1539099492,"Nuclear protein extracts were prepared from uninduced myeloid leukemic KG-1 cells and analyzed for interferon-specific DNA binding by a gel electrophoresis DNA binding assay. A protein was detected that bound specifically to a 163-base pair upstream region of the IFN-beta promoter. A series of competition studies were performed to assess whether this was a general DNA binding protein; binding of this factor was competed from radiolabeled beta 163 fragment only by an excess of cold unlabeled beta 163 or a 67-base pair fragment (beta 67) derived from beta 163. Other promoter and enhancer transcriptional domains including 1) c-fos serum responsive element, 2) c-fos promoter, 3) SV40 enhancer, 4) IFN-alpha 1 promoter, and 5) plasmid pAT153 did not compete effectively for binding of the protein. These results indicate that this protein is not a general enhancer or promoter binding factor and may be unique to IFN-beta. Analysis of beta 67 DNA sequences revealed no homology to known recognition sequences for Sp1 or CTF transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W1479922321,"Human angiotensinogen cDNA clones were isolated from a human liver library. Nucleotide sequence analysis of these cDNA clones revealed that position 1075 in the messenger RNA, which is part of a PstI recognition sequence, is different from the published sequence (Kageyama, R., Ohkubo, H., and Nakanishi, S. (1984) Biochemistry 23, 3603-3609). This change results in an altered amino acid at this position in the corresponding protein sequence and suggests possible restriction fragment length polymorphism. The full length human angiotensinogen cDNA was constructed from partial cDNA clones and ligated into an isopropyl-1-thio-beta-D-galactopyranoside inducible bacterial expression vector pUC9 to develop expression plasmid pUCHAG27. This plasmid permitted the synthesis of human angiotensinogen in Escherichia coli. The recombinant bacteria overproduced a 53-kDa protein which was recognized by anti-human angiotensinogen antibodies. The synthesis of this protein was greatly increased upon induction with isopropyl-1-thio-beta-D-galactopyranoside. The chimeric protein, almost identical to human angiotensinogen, was partially purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation and gel filtration on Sephadex G-100. Human kidney renin was shown to enzymatically cleave this recombinant protein to produce des-(angiotensin I)-angiotensinogen and a small polypeptide. Thus, we provide evidence that recombinant human angiotensinogen synthesized through E. coli is biologically active and serves as a substrate for human renin."
https://openalex.org/W1588494179,"Hybrid proteins were constructed by coupling beta-lactamase to the signal sequence (plus nine amino acids) of selected mutant prolipoproteins of Escherichia coli. The mutant prolipoprotein signal peptides contained lesions in two structural domains of the signal peptide, the basic amino-terminal domain and the hydrophobic core domain. We then compared the processing and localization of the mutant prolipo-beta-lactamases to the processing and localization of the comparable mutant prolipoproteins. We show that a mutant signal sequence with an anionic amino terminus exhibits similar limitations in the processing of prolipo-beta-lactamase as previously observed in prolipoprotein. Deletion of four hydrophobic residues from hydrophobic core results in a signal peptide which slowly translocates a fraction of the total mutant hybrid protein synthesized. This signal peptide was previously shown to translocate lipoprotein efficiently. Alteration of this hydrophobic core, which stimulated synthesis of mutant prolipoproteins, does not stimulate synthesis of prolipo-beta-lactamase. Finally mutations that slowed processing of prolipoprotein by affecting the proposed helical structure of the signal peptide had no significant effect on the processing of prolipo-beta-lactamase. These results suggest that the positively charged amino-terminal domain of the signal peptide has a common role in protein secretion regardless of the secretory protein. On the other hand, other domains of the signal peptide exhibit different phenotypes when the secretory protein is changed."
