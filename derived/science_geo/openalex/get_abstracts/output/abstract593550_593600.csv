https://openalex.org/W2728092904,"Quantum key distribution (QKD) uses individual light quanta in quantum superposition states to guarantee unconditional communication security between distant parties. However, the distance over which QKD is achievable has been limited to a few hundred kilometres, owing to the channel loss that occurs when using optical fibres or terrestrial free space that exponentially reduces the photon transmission rate. Satellite-based QKD has the potential to help to establish a global-scale quantum network, owing to the negligible photon loss and decoherence experienced in empty space. Here we report the development and launch of a low-Earth-orbit satellite for implementing decoy-state QKD-a form of QKD that uses weak coherent pulses at high channel loss and is secure because photon-number-splitting eavesdropping can be detected. We achieve a kilohertz key rate from the satellite to the ground over a distance of up to 1,200 kilometres. This key rate is around 20 orders of magnitudes greater than that expected using an optical fibre of the same length. The establishment of a reliable and efficient space-to-ground link for quantum-state transmission paves the way to global-scale quantum networks."

Aging is associated with increased cellular senescence, which is hypothesized to drive the eventual development of multiple comorbidities1. Here we investigate a role for senescent cells in age-related bone loss through multiple approaches. In particular, we used either genetic (i.e., the INK-ATTAC 'suicide' transgene encoding an inducible caspase 8 expressed specifically in senescent cells2,3,4) or pharmacological (i.e., 'senolytic' compounds5,6) means to eliminate senescent cells. We also inhibited the production of the proinflammatory secretome of senescent cells using a JAK inhibitor (JAKi)3,7. In aged (20- to 22-month-old) mice with established bone loss, activation of the INK-ATTAC caspase 8 in senescent cells or treatment with senolytics or the JAKi for 2–4 months resulted in higher bone mass and strength and better bone microarchitecture than in vehicle-treated mice. The beneficial effects of targeting senescent cells were due to lower bone resorption with either maintained (trabecular) or higher (cortical) bone formation as compared to vehicle-treated mice. In vitro studies demonstrated that senescent-cell conditioned medium impaired osteoblast mineralization and enhanced osteoclast-progenitor survival, leading to increased osteoclastogenesis. Collectively, these data establish a causal role for senescent cells in bone loss with aging, and demonstrate that targeting these cells has both anti-resorptive and anabolic effects on bone. Given that eliminating senescent cells and/or inhibiting their proinflammatory secretome also improves cardiovascular function4, enhances insulin sensitivity3, and reduces frailty7, targeting this fundamental mechanism to prevent age-related bone loss suggests a novel treatment strategy not only for osteoporosis, but also for multiple age-related comorbidities."
https://openalex.org/W2725161044,"Quantum teleportation of single-photon qubits from a ground observatory to a satellite in low-Earth orbit via an uplink channel is achieved with a fidelity that is well above the classical limit. The laws of quantum physics give rise to protocols for ultra-secure cryptography and quantum communications. However, to be useful in a global network, these protocols will have to function with satellites. Extending existing protocols to such long distances poses a tremendous experimental challenge. Researchers led by Jian-Wei Pan present a pair of papers in this issue that take steps toward a global quantum network, using the low-Earth-orbit satellite Micius. They demonstrate satellite-to-ground quantum key distribution, an integral part of quantum cryptosystems, at kilohertz rates over 1,200 kilometres, and report quantum teleportation of a single-photon qubit over 1,400 kilometres. Quantum teleportation is the transfer of the exact state of a quantum object from one place to another, without physical travelling of the object itself, and is a central process in many quantum communication protocols. These two experiments suggest that Micius could become the first component in a global quantum internet. An arbitrary unknown quantum state cannot be measured precisely or replicated perfectly1. However, quantum teleportation enables unknown quantum states to be transferred reliably from one object to another over long distances2, without physical travelling of the object itself. Long-distance teleportation is a fundamental element of protocols such as large-scale quantum networks3,4 and distributed quantum computation5,6. But the distances over which transmission was achieved in previous teleportation experiments, which used optical fibres and terrestrial free-space channels7,8,9,10,11,12, were limited to about 100 kilometres, owing to the photon loss of these channels. To realize a global-scale ‘quantum internet’13 the range of quantum teleportation needs to be greatly extended. A promising way of doing so involves using satellite platforms and space-based links, which can connect two remote points on Earth with greatly reduced channel loss because most of the propagation path of the photons is in empty space. Here we report quantum teleportation of independent single-photon qubits from a ground observatory to a low-Earth-orbit satellite, through an uplink channel, over distances of up to 1,400 kilometres. To optimize the efficiency of the link and to counter the atmospheric turbulence in the uplink, we use a compact ultra-bright source of entangled photons, a narrow beam divergence and high-bandwidth and high-accuracy acquiring, pointing and tracking. We demonstrate successful quantum teleportation of six input states in mutually unbiased bases with an average fidelity of 0.80 ± 0.01, well above the optimal state-estimation fidelity on a single copy of a qubit (the classical limit)14. Our demonstration of a ground-to-satellite uplink for reliable and ultra-long-distance quantum teleportation is an essential step towards a global-scale quantum internet."
https://openalex.org/W2746917316,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disease burden worldwide. While the incidence, symptoms and treatment of MDD all point toward major sex differences, the molecular mechanisms underlying this sexual dimorphism remain largely unknown. Here, combining differential expression and gene coexpression network analyses, we provide a comprehensive characterization of male and female transcriptional profiles associated with MDD across six brain regions. We overlap our human profiles with those from a mouse model, chronic variable stress, and capitalize on converging pathways to define molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying the expression of stress susceptibility in males and females. Our results show a major rearrangement of transcriptional patterns in MDD, with limited overlap between males and females, an effect seen in both depressed humans and stressed mice. We identify key regulators of sex-specific gene networks underlying MDD and confirm their sex-specific impact as mediators of stress susceptibility. For example, downregulation of the female-specific hub gene Dusp6 in mouse prefrontal cortex mimicked stress susceptibility in females, but not males, by increasing ERK signaling and pyramidal neuron excitability. Such Dusp6 downregulation also recapitulated the transcriptional remodeling that occurs in prefrontal cortex of depressed females. Together our findings reveal marked sexual dimorphism at the transcriptional level in MDD and highlight the importance of studying sex-specific treatments for this disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2746871805,"Loss-of-function mutations in TET2 occur frequently in patients with clonal hematopoiesis, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and are associated with a DNA hypermethylation phenotype. To determine the role of TET2 deficiency in leukemia stem cell maintenance, we generated a reversible transgenic RNAi mouse to model restoration of endogenous Tet2 expression. Tet2 restoration reverses aberrant hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) self-renewal in vitro and in vivo. Treatment with vitamin C, a co-factor of Fe2+ and α-KG-dependent dioxygenases, mimics TET2 restoration by enhancing 5-hydroxymethylcytosine formation in Tet2-deficient mouse HSPCs and suppresses human leukemic colony formation and leukemia progression of primary human leukemia PDXs. Vitamin C also drives DNA hypomethylation and expression of a TET2-dependent gene signature in human leukemia cell lines. Furthermore, TET-mediated DNA oxidation induced by vitamin C treatment in leukemia cells enhances their sensitivity to PARP inhibition and could provide a safe and effective combination strategy to selectively target TET deficiency in cancer.

https://openalex.org/W2749641460,"Biallelic inactivation of BRCA1 or BRCA2 is associated with a pattern of genome-wide mutations known as signature 3. By analyzing ∼1,000 breast cancer samples, we confirmed this association and established that germline nonsense and frameshift variants in PALB2, but not in ATM or CHEK2, can also give rise to the same signature. We were able to accurately classify missense BRCA1 or BRCA2 variants known to impair homologous recombination (HR) on the basis of this signature. Finally, we show that epigenetic silencing of RAD51C and BRCA1 by promoter methylation is strongly associated with signature 3 and, in our data set, was highly enriched in basal-like breast cancers in young individuals of African descent."
https://openalex.org/W2746373891,"Stem-cell fate can be influenced by metabolite levels in culture, but it is not known whether physiological variations in metabolite levels in normal tissues regulate stem-cell function in vivo. Here we describe a metabolomics method for the analysis of rare cell populations isolated directly from tissues and use it to compare mouse haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to restricted haematopoietic progenitors. Each haematopoietic cell type had a distinct metabolic signature. Human and mouse HSCs had unusually high levels of ascorbate, which decreased with differentiation. Systemic ascorbate depletion in mice increased HSC frequency and function, in part by reducing the function of Tet2, a dioxygenase tumour suppressor. Ascorbate depletion cooperated with Flt3 internal tandem duplication (Flt3ITD) leukaemic mutations to accelerate leukaemogenesis, through cell-autonomous and possibly non-cell-autonomous mechanisms, in a manner that was reversed by dietary ascorbate. Ascorbate acted cell-autonomously to negatively regulate HSC function and myelopoiesis through Tet2-dependent and Tet2-independent mechanisms. Ascorbate therefore accumulates within HSCs to promote Tet activity in vivo, limiting HSC frequency and suppressing leukaemogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2747228919,"Neuronal representations change as associations are learned between sensory stimuli and behavioral actions. However, it is poorly understood whether representations for learned associations stabilize in cortical association areas or continue to change following learning. We tracked the activity of posterior parietal cortex neurons for a month as mice stably performed a virtual-navigation task. The relationship between cells’ activity and task features was mostly stable on single days but underwent major reorganization over weeks. The neurons informative about task features (trial type and maze locations) changed across days. Despite changes in individual cells, the population activity had statistically similar properties each day and stable information for over a week. As mice learned additional associations, new activity patterns emerged in the neurons used for existing representations without greatly affecting the rate of change of these representations. We propose that dynamic neuronal activity patterns could balance plasticity for learning and stability for memory."

Their integrated analyses implicate two major classes of genetic changes in Wilms tumors that preserve the progenitor state and/or interrupt normal kidney development. We performed genome-wide sequencing and analyzed mRNA and miRNA expression, DNA copy number, and DNA methylation in 117 Wilms tumors, followed by targeted sequencing of 651 Wilms tumors. In addition to genes previously implicated in Wilms tumors (WT1, CTNNB1, AMER1, DROSHA, DGCR8, XPO5, DICER1, SIX1, SIX2, MLLT1, MYCN, and TP53), we identified mutations in genes not previously recognized as recurrently involved in Wilms tumors, the most frequent being BCOR, BCORL1, NONO, MAX, COL6A3, ASXL1, MAP3K4, and ARID1A. DNA copy number changes resulted in recurrent 1q gain, MYCN amplification, LIN28B gain, and MIRLET7A loss. Unexpected germline variants involved PALB2 and CHEK2. Integrated analyses support two major classes of genetic changes that preserve the progenitor state and/or interrupt normal development."

It is generally thought that formation and retrieval of a memory are accomplished by activation and reactivation of memory-holding cells (engram cells), respectively, by a largely common set of neural circuits that convey relevant sensory and processed information. However, this hypothesis has not been well studied. One of the best neural systems to prove this issue is the medial temporal lobe (MTL), including the hippocampus (HPC) and entorhinal cortex (EC), which plays crucial roles in episodic memory (Eichenbaum et al., 2007Eichenbaum H.

Numerous studies have identified specific and crucial roles of individual HPC subfields and EC layers to the overall mnemonic function (Deng et al., 2010Deng W. Aimone J.B. Gage F.H.

However, the essential function of one HPC subfield, subiculum (Sub), is poorly known. The mammalian HPC formation is organized primarily as a unidirectional circuit, where information transferred from the EC’s superficial layers to the dentate gyrus (DG) is processed successively in CA subfields: CA3, CA2, and CA1. Dorsal CA1 (dCA1) sends its primary projections directly to medial EC layer 5 (EC5) or indirectly via dorsal subiculum (dSub) (a detour circuit). One of the interesting differences between the direct and indirect HPC output pathways is that in the latter, dSub projects not only to EC5, but also to many cortical and subcortical brain regions (Ding, 2013Ding S.L. Comparative anatomy of the prosubiculum, subiculum, presubiculum, postsubiculum, and parasubiculum in human, monkey, and rodent.J. Comp.

Topographical organization of projections from the subiculum to the hypothalamus in the rat.J. Comp. Neurol. 2000; 419: 205-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Using functional magnetic resonance imaging of human subjects, several studies have suggested that the DG and CA subfields are selectively activated during episodic memory formation, whereas subiculum (Sub) is active during the recollection of an episode (Eldridge et al., 2005Eldridge L.L. Engel S.A. Zeineh M.M. Bookheimer S.Y. Knowlton B.J. A dissociation of encoding and retrieval processes in the human hippocampus.J.

Separate neural bases of two fundamental memory processes in the human medial temporal lobe.Science. 1997; 276: 264-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). In rodents, ibotenic acid lesions of the CA1 subfield or Sub caused impairments in the acquisition of place navigation (Morris et al., 1990Morris R.G. Schenk F. Tweedie F. Jarrard L.E. Ibotenate lesions of hippocampus and/or subiculum: dissociating components of allocentric spatial learning.Eur. J. Neurosci. 1990; 2: 1016-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). However, since human imaging studies provide only correlative, rather than causal, evidence and rodent lesions are not well targeted to a specific hippocampal subregion—especially given the close proximity of CA1 and dSub—it has not been possible to identify the essential function of Sub in episodic memory. Furthermore, previous studies did not address the potential purpose of the parallel diverging and converging dCA1 to medial EC5 and dCA1 to dSub to medial EC5 circuits in memory formation versus retrieval. In the present study, we addressed these issues by creating a mouse line expressing Cre recombinase specifically in dSub neurons. Combined with circuit tracing and optogenetic manipulations during behavioral paradigms, we found differential roles of dSub projections in hippocampal memory retrieval and retrieval-induced stress hormone responses. We demonstrate that dSub and the circuit, CA1→dSub→EC5, are selectively required for memory retrieval, while the dSub to mammillary bodies (MB) circuit regulates stress hormones following memory retrieval. In contrast, the direct CA1→EC5 circuit is essential for hippocampal memory formation, but not recall. Our study reveals a functional double-dissociation between parallel hippocampal output circuits that are important for memory formation versus memory retrieval. We took advantage of the finding that fibronectin-1 (FN1) gene expression is restricted to dSub neurons (Lein et al., 2004Lein E.S. Zhao X. Gage F.H. Defining a molecular atlas of the hippocampus using DNA microarrays and high-throughput in situ hybridization.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 3879-3889Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and created a transgenic mouse line (FN1-Cre) that expresses Cre recombinase under the FN1 promoter (Figure 1A and see STAR Methods). When infected with a Cre-dependent adeno-associated virus containing an eYFP gene, eYFP expression was highly restricted to dSub neurons and was completely absent in neighboring dCA1 excitatory neurons identified by WFS1 (Figure 1B). The expression of eYFP was restricted to CaMKII+ excitatory neurons in both the deep and superficial layers of dSub (Figures 1C, 1D, and see Figure S1A). This eYFP expression accounted for over 85% of all excitatory neurons in this brain region and was dSub specific along the entire medial-lateral axis (Figures 1E–1K). Further, Cre expression was absent in ventral subiculum (vSub) and medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) in this mouse line (Figures S1B–S1K). Using in situ hybridization, we confirmed that Cre expression in this mouse line is highly restricted to dSub and the dorsal tegmental nucleus (DTg) in the brain stem (Figure S1L). Thus, FN1-Cre mice allows for the genetic manipulation of dSub excitatory neurons with unprecedented specificity.Figure S1Characterization of FN1-Cre Mice, Related to Figures 1 and 2Show full caption(A) FN1-Cre mice were injected with a Cre-dependent virus expressing eYFP.

The results confirmed that dCA1 provides the major input to dSub excitatory neurons (Figures 2A–2C) (Ding, 2013Ding S.L.

Other brain areas that provide inputs to dSub include parasubiculum (PaS), retrosplenial agranular cortex (RSA), superficial layers of EC (MEC II/III), nucleus of the diagonal band (NDB), nucleus accumbens shell (Acb Sh), and several thalamic nuclei (Thal Nucl) (Figure 2D, and see Figure S1M). A Cre-dependent channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)-eYFP virus combined with light sheet microscopy of CLARITY (Chung et al., 2013Chung K. Wallace J. Kim S.Y. Kalyanasundaram S. Andalman A.S. Davidson T.J.

Denisin A.K. et al.Structural and molecular interrogation of intact biological systems.Nature. 2013; 497: 332-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1390) Google Scholar, see STAR Methods)-processed brain samples revealed that major efferents of dSub neurons were directed to RSA, mammillary bodies (MB), medial EC5, and postrhinal cortex (Pos) (Figures 2E and 2F). No projections from dSub were observed in the superficial layers (II/III) of MEC (Figure 2G). These dSub neurons converged on both medial and lateral regions of MB (Figure 2H). Using a Cre-dependent synaptophysin virus to label dSub axonal terminals, we found that these Cre+ neurons express vesicular glutamate transporters 1 and 2 (Kaneko et al., 2002Kaneko T. Fujiyama F. Hioki H. Immunohistochemical localization of candidates for vesicular glutamate transporters in the rat brain.J. Comp. Neurol. 2002; 444: 39-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), reflecting their excitatory nature (Figures S1N–S1P). Injection of a retrograde tracer, cholera toxin subunit B (CTB), into the MB revealed a gradient of CTB555 with higher intensity labeling in the proximal part of dSub (i.e., closer to CA1), whereas injection into medial EC5 showed a gradient of CTB488 with higher intensity labeling in the distal part of dSub (i.e., away from CA1) (Figures 2I–2M, and see Figure S1Q) (Witter et al., 1990Witter M.P. Ostendorf R.H. Groenewegen H.J. Heterogeneity in the dorsal subiculum of the rat. Distinct neuronal zones project to different cortical and subcortical targets.Eur. J.

Together, these results indicate that dCA1 serves as the main input structure to dSub and that the majority of dSub neurons send projections to multiple downstream target structures. To examine the functional role of dSub neurons and their circuits, we performed optogenetic inhibition experiments using a Cre-dependent eArch3.0-eYFP virus. During the contextual fear-conditioning (CFC) paradigm, we confirmed that green light inhibition of dSub decreased behavior-induced immediate early gene cFos-positive neurons (Figures S2A–S2L). Inhibition of dSub neurons during CFC training had no effect on footshock-induced freezing behavior or long-term memory formation (Figure 3A). In contrast, dSub inhibition during CFC recall tests decreased behavioral performance (Figure 3B). Inhibition of dSub neurons had no effect on motor behaviors in an open-field assay (Figure S2M). Inhibition of dSub terminals in medial EC5, but not in MB, also revealed a memory-retrieval deficit (Figure 3C). Since the behavioral effect of dSub inhibition in this mouse line is based on eArch expression in approximately 85% of excitatory neurons in this brain region, we examined the effect of a more complete inhibition of dSub neurons. Inhibition of dSub→EC5 terminals in wild-type (WT) mice using an EF1α-eArch3.0-eYFP virus revealed a greater memory retrieval deficit (Figure S3 versus Figure 3C). Further, inhibition of vSub→EC5 terminals showed normal levels of memory recall (Figure S3).Figure 3Differential Roles of dSub Projections in Hippocampal Memory Retrieval and Retrieval-Induced Stress Hormone ResponsesShow full caption(A and B) FN1-Cre mice were injected with a Cre-dependent virus expressing eArch3.0-eYFP into dSub.

Conversely, optogenetic activation of ChR2-eYFP-expressing dSub projections to medial EC5 during CFC recall tests increased recall-induced freezing behavior in the training context, but not in a neutral context (Figure 3D, and see Figure S4A). This result indicates that dSub is involved in hippocampal memory retrieval in a context-specific manner. Activation of dSub→EC5 in mice that did not receive footshocks during training lacked freezing behavior during the recall test, supporting the specificity of increased memory retrieval in CFC-trained animals. Our interpretation of these optogenetic activation experiments is that, in the training context, natural recall cues reactivate engram cells in all subfields of the hippocampus, like DG, CA3, and CA1, but also in dSub. When the activity of dSub projections to EC5 is further increased by ChR2, this leads to enhanced freezing"
https://openalex.org/W2747548029,"Disruption of gene silencing by Polycomb protein complexes leads to homeotic transformations and altered developmental-phase identity in plants. Here we define short genomic fragments, known as Polycomb response elements (PREs), that direct Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) placement at developmental genes regulated by silencing in Arabidopsis thaliana. We identify transcription factor families that bind to these PREs, colocalize with PRC2 on chromatin, physically interact with and recruit PRC2, and are required for PRC2-mediated gene silencing in vivo. Two of the cis sequence motifs enriched in the PREs are cognate binding sites for the identified transcription factors and are necessary and sufficient for PRE activity. Thus PRC2 recruitment in Arabidopsis relies in large part on binding of trans-acting factors to cis-localized DNA sequence motifs."
https://openalex.org/W2620639795,"The amygdala central nucleus (CeA) has been implicated in feeding regulation, but the underlying circuit mechanisms are incompletely understood. The authors show, in mice, that GABAergic serotonin receptor 2a–expressing CeA neurons are active during eating and promote positive reinforcement and food consumption, partly through long-range inhibition of the parabrachial nucleus. The complex behaviors underlying reward seeking and consumption are integral to organism survival. The hypothalamus and mesolimbic dopamine system are key mediators of these behaviors, yet regulation of appetitive and consummatory behaviors outside of these regions is poorly understood. The central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) has been implicated in feeding and reward, but the neurons and circuit mechanisms that positively regulate these behaviors remain unclear. Here, we defined the neuronal mechanisms by which CeA neurons promote food consumption. Using in vivo activity manipulations and Ca2+ imaging in mice, we found that GABAergic serotonin receptor 2a (Htr2a)-expressing CeA neurons modulate food consumption, promote positive reinforcement and are active in vivo during eating. We demonstrated electrophysiologically, anatomically and behaviorally that intra-CeA and long-range circuit mechanisms underlie these behaviors. Finally, we showed that CeAHtr2a neurons receive inputs from feeding-relevant brain regions. Our results illustrate how defined CeA neural circuits positively regulate food consumption."
https://openalex.org/W2746775567,"Prominent theories of decision making suggest that the basal ganglia (BG) play a causal role in deliberation between action choices. An alternative hypothesis is that deliberation occurs in cortical regions, while the BG control the speed-accuracy trade-off (SAT) between committing to a choice versus continuing to deliberate. Here, we test these hypotheses by recording activity in the internal and external segments of the globus pallidus (GPi/GPe) while monkeys perform a task dissociating the process of deliberation, the moment of commitment, and adjustment of the SAT. Our data suggest that unlike premotor and motor cortical regions, pallidal output does not contribute to the process of deliberation but instead provides a time-varying signal that controls the SAT and reflects the growing urgency to commit to a choice. Once a target is selected by cortical regions, GP activity confirms commitment to the decision and invigorates the subsequent movement."
https://openalex.org/W2749856153,"Summary The lateral ventricle subventricular zone (SVZ) is a frequent and consequential site of pediatric and adult glioma spread, but the cellular and molecular mechanisms mediating this are poorly understood. We demonstrate that neural precursor cell (NPC):glioma cell communication underpins this propensity of glioma to colonize the SVZ through secretion of chemoattractant signals toward which glioma cells home. Biochemical, proteomic, and functional analyses of SVZ NPC-secreted factors revealed the neurite outgrowth-promoting factor pleiotrophin, along with required binding partners SPARC/SPARCL1 and HSP90B, as key mediators of this chemoattractant effect. Pleiotrophin expression is strongly enriched in the SVZ, and pleiotrophin knock down starkly reduced glioma invasion of the SVZ in the murine brain. Pleiotrophin, in complex with the binding partners, activated glioma Rho/ROCK signaling, and ROCK inhibition decreased invasion toward SVZ NPC-secreted factors. These findings demonstrate a pathogenic role for NPC:glioma interactions and potential therapeutic targets to limit glioma invasion. PaperClip"
https://openalex.org/W2745958356,"Structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) protein complexes are key determinants of chromosome conformation. Using Hi-C and polymer modelling, we study how cohesin and condensin, two deeply conserved SMC complexes, organize chromosomes in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The canonical role of cohesin is to co-align sister chromatids, while condensin generally compacts mitotic chromosomes. We find strikingly different roles for the two complexes in budding yeast mitosis. First, cohesin is responsible for compacting mitotic chromosome arms, independently of sister chromatid cohesion. Polymer simulations demonstrate that this role can be fully accounted for through cis-looping of chromatin. Second, condensin is generally dispensable for compaction along chromosome arms. Instead, it plays a targeted role compacting the rDNA proximal regions and promoting resolution of peri-centromeric regions. Our results argue that the conserved mechanism of SMC complexes is to form chromatin loops and that distinct SMC-dependent looping activities are selectively deployed to appropriately compact chromosomes."

In humans and rodents, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been implicated in suppressing reward seeking; however, despite vital significance in health and disease, the neural circuitry through which mPFC regulates reward seeking remains incompletely understood. Here, we show that a specific subset of superficial mPFC projections to a subfield of nucleus accumbens (NAc) neurons naturally encodes the decision to initiate or suppress reward seeking when faced with risk of punishment. A highly resolved subpopulation of these top-down projecting neurons, identified by 2-photon Ca2+ imaging and activity-dependent labeling to recruit the relevant neurons, was found capable of suppressing reward seeking. This natural activity-resolved mPFC-to-NAc projection displayed unique molecular-genetic and microcircuit-level features concordant with a conserved role in the regulation of reward-seeking behavior, providing cellular and anatomical identifiers of behavioral and possible therapeutic significance.

The complexity of the environment of animals may be contrasted with the unitary nature of action. Many choices involving outcome components of known conflicting-valence (e.g., both reward and punishment) must still be implemented by a single coherent action. To achieve such adaptively important outcomes in the brain, neural circuitry is required to efficiently resolve inconsistencies, select single actions, and transmit the result of this adjudication to motor-output circuitry. Neuroeconomic gain/loss considerations may be of insufficient complexity for the large majority of naturalistic situations, wherein reward and harm are categorically different. Maladaptive evaluation/selection of such choices is also important in clinical settings (Everitt and Robbins, 2005Everitt B.J. Robbins T.W. Neural systems of reinforcement for drug addiction: from actions to habits to compulsion.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1481-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (2716) Google Scholar). For example, physically destructive consequences of substance use (normally aversive and thus effective in deterring behavior) often fail to deter drug-use action plans. Clinically relevant suppression of behavioral responses to aversive stimuli is not limited to substance use; self-injurious behaviors can become of neutral or even positive motivational valence in OCD, borderline personality disorder, and other neuropsychiatric diseases. Thus requiring neither drug nor dependence, selecting actions with known harmful outcomes arises in diverse adaptive and maladaptive contexts and thus may involve conserved circuitry and neurophysiology with substantial developmental and evolutionary significance. The relevant neural circuitry is incompletely understood from the brainwide to cellular level, but studies of reward and aversion circuitry have identified separate and overlapping networks (Haber and Knutson, 2010Haber S.N. Knutson B. The reward circuit: linking primate anatomy and human imaging.Neuropsychopharmacology. 2010; 35: 4-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (2359) Google Scholar). Reward circuitry is heavily dependent upon ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons and their targets, which include cortex and nucleus accumbens (NAc) as well as additional corticostriatal circuitry involving the ventral pallidum, anterior cingulate cortex and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and diverse other structures spanning amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, and habenular and brainstem nuclei (Robbins and Everitt, 1996Robbins T.W.

Notably, regions shared across reward- and aversion-processing, such as prefrontal cortices and the nucleus accumbens, have been implicated in mediating behavior in approach/avoidance conflict with punishment (reviewed in Orsini et al., 2015aOrsini C.A.

Cellular-level and brainwide investigation of how circuits carry out this transformation of a complex choice into unitary action may thus require advances in the ability to manipulate and measure brain-spanning circuit activity patterns during behavior. Here, we seek underlying principles by developing and applying methods to control, observe, and structurally resolve naturally occurring and causally relevant circuit activity patterns in awake mice during behaviors wherein unitary action is both challenging and required. We detect the circuit elements that are specifically recruited and strongly active during selection of a learned rewarding action in the setting of known punishment, quantify naturally occurring real-time signals in neocortex-arising deep-brain projections, and employ all-optical imaging and control methods to test causal significance of the identified populations, pathways, and dynamics.

Together, these data suggested that mPFC→NAc and mPFC→VTA cells could reside in distinct cortical laminae.Table 1Genes Enriched in mPFC→NAc and mPFC→VTA NeuronsGenes enriched in mPFC→NAcGenes enriched in mPFC→VTAGeneGene productGeneGene productNPTX2Neuronal pentraxin 2TCERG1LTranscription elongation regulator 1-likeF2RL2Coagulation factor II (thrombin) receptor-like 2POU3F1POU domain, class 3, transcription factor 1FOSFBJ osteosarcoma oncogenePTCD3Pentatricopeptide repeat domain 3LCN2Lipocalin 2CHST8Carbohydrate (N-acetylgalactosamine 4-0) sulfotransferase 8PTGFRNProstaglandin F2 receptor negative regulatorIGFBP4Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 4SCCPDHSaccharopine dehydrogenaseBCL11B (CTIP2)B cell leukemia/lymphoma 11BTMEM254BTransmembrane protein 254bPARM1Prostate androgen-regulated mucin-like protein 1BIN2Bridging integrator 2NRIP3Nuclear receptor interacting protein 3NRN1Neuritin 1BCL6B cell leukemia/lymphoma 6LY6ALymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus ADSCAML1Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule like 1CD7CD7 antigenRHBDL3Rhomboid, veinlet-like 3 (Drosophila)LY96Lymphocyte antigen 96GLRA3Glycine receptor, alpha 3 subunitIGLC3Immunoglobulin lambda constant 3NDUFA4L2NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) 1 alpha subcomplex, 4-like 2TOMM5Translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 5 homolog (yeast)LORLoricrinLRRC3BLeucine rich repeat containing 3BVMN1R127Vomeronasal 1 receptor 127KRTAP5-1Keratin associated protein 5-1SYCP3Synaptonemal complex protein 3ZNRD1Zinc ribbon domain containing, 1KLF10Kruppel-like factor 10MAP3K8Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 8CYP11A1Cytochrome P450, family 11, subfamily a, polypeptide 1TMEM126ATransmembrane protein 126ACTSHCathepsin HCNIH3Cornichon homolog 3 (Drosophila)ANKRD33BAnkyrin repeat domain 33BMPV17MpV17 mitochondrial inner membrane proteinKRT12Keratin 12RIMS3Regulating synaptic membrane exocytosis 3COX20COX20 Cox2 chaperoneLBPLipopolysaccharide binding proteinHMGN2High mobility group nucleosomal binding domain 2SRGNSerglycinFAPFibroblast activation proteinCD33CD33 antigenSPG21Spastic paraplegia 21 homolog (human)LOC10264184860S ribosomal protein L15-likeList of candidate genes enriched in mPFC→NAc neurons or enriched in mPFC→VTA neurons.

To definitively examine anatomical organization of these different subpopulations, we used different retrograde viruses to label mPFC→NAc or mPFC→VTA neurons within individual mice (Figure 1C). We injected a herpes simplex virus encoding flp recombinase (HSV-flp; Fenno et al., 2014Fenno L.E. Mattis J. Ramakrishnan C. Hyun M. Lee S.Y. He M. Tucciarone J. Selimbeyoglu A. Berndt A. Grosenick L. et al.Targeting cells with single vectors using multiple-feature Boolean logic.Nat. Methods. 2014; 11: 763-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) in NAc, CAV2-Cre in VTA, and a mixture of adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) encoding Cre-dependent mCherry and flp-dependent eYFP in mPFC (Table S2). This strategy resulted in robust and specific labeling of mPFC→NAc or mPFC→VTA neurons (Figures 1D and S2A–S2C). Confirming our molecular profiling, these two populations were distributed in different laminae in mPFC, with NAc-projecting neurons medially in more superficial layer 5a and VTA-projecting neurons laterally in deeper layer 5b (Figure 1E). To exclude viral competition for cell-surface receptors, we repeated these experiments using CAV2-Cre and a Cre-dependent eYFP in separate mice to label each projection and found the same laminar separation among projection neurons (Figures 1F–1H, S2D, and S2E). We next linked these anatomical findings to molecular profiling. Immunohistochemical staining for CTIP2—a marker for cortical layer 5b neurons (DeNardo et al., 2015DeNardo L.A. Berns D.S. DeLoach K. Luo L. Connectivity of mouse somatosensory and prefrontal cortex examined with trans-synaptic tracing.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 1687-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar)—colocalized with mPFC→VTA neurons, while mPFC→NAc neurons were distinct and superficial to the CTIP2 label (Figures 1G, 1H, S2F, and S2G). Thus, mPFC→NAc and mPFC→VTA neurons represent distinct populations, raising the possibility of distinct roles in reward-related behavior. To explore whether mPFC→NAc and mPFC→VTA neurons naturally serve distinct roles in regulation of reward seeking, we recorded activity from these populations during behavior using frame-projected independent-fiber photometry (FIP; Kim et al., 2016Kim C.K. Yang S.J. Pichamoorthy N. Young N.P. Kauvar I. Jennings J.H. Lerner T.N. Berndt A. Lee S.Y.

Methods. 2016; 13: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar; Figures 2A, S3A, and S3B). We trained mice on a self-paced, freely moving lever-press task designed to suppress reward seeking (risk of foot-shock on 30% of lever presses; Figure 2B). Validating the task, we demonstrated that mice receiving pseudorandomly delivered foot-shocks instead of lever-contingent foot-shocks did not exhibit lever-pressing suppression, whereas lever-contingent shock delivery resulted in immediate partial suppression of lever-pressing (Figures 2C, 2D, and S3C–S3F). Exhibiting similar Ca2+ signals, both mPFC→NAc and mPFC→VTA neurons showed reduced activity upon lever-pressing with reward-receipt during baseline sessions and increased activity following lever-pressing with shock-receipt (Figures 2E–2H). Lever re-positioning relative to reward port had no effect on mPFC→NAc activity (Figures S3G and S3H), excluding a contribution from ipsilateral movement as in striatal neurons (Cui et al., 2013Cui G. Jun S.B. Jin X. Pham M.D. Vogel S.S. Lovinger D.M. Costa R.M.

Although foot-shocks substantially suppressed reward seeking, mice continued to seek reward occasionally. Since broadly increased mPFC activity suppresses active reward seeking (Ferenczi et al., 2016Ferenczi E.A. Zalocusky K.A. Liston C. Grosenick L. Warden M.R. Amatya D. Katovich K. Mehta H. Patenaude B. Ramakrishnan C. et al.Prefrontal cortical regulation of brainwide circuit dynamics and reward-related behavior.Science. 2016; 351: aac9698Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that immediately prior to lever presses for reward with risk of foot-shock, cells of both projections would exhibit relative activity-reduction (corresponding to released mPFC suppression of reward seeking). We observed relative suppression but surprisingly only in mPFC→NAc (not mPFC→VTA) prior to lever presses on shock-risk days compared to baseline days (Figures 2I–2L). This suppression could be readily observed within individual mPFC→NAc mice (Figure 2M), and the magnitude of suppression in each mouse predicted reward-seeking propensity (Figure 2N), whereas for mPFC→VTA mice, neither suppression prior to reward seeking nor correlation between suppression and reward seeking was observed (Figures 2O and 2P). To determine whether mPFC→NAc or mPFC→VTA projections could causally drive suppression of reward seeking, we generated mice with an excitatory opsin optimized for expression and redshifted actuation (bReaChES-mCherry; Rajasethupathy et al., 2015Rajasethupathy P. Sankaran S. Marshel J.H. Kim C.K. Ferenczi E. Lee S.Y. Berndt A. Ramakrishnan C. Jaffe A. Lo M. et al.Projections from neocortex mediate top-down control of memory retrieval.Nature. 2015; 526: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) expressed bilaterally. To target mPFC→NAc neurons, we injected CAV2-Cre into NAc and AAV-DIO-bReaChES-mCherry into mPFC, with optical fiber in mPFC (Figure 3A). Testing whether stimulation of mPFC→NAc cell bodies would be aversive using real-time place preference (RTPP), we found reduced occupancy on the otherwise-neutral stimulation side (place aversion), with no effect on locomotion velocity (Figures 3B–3D). However, stimulation of mPFC→VTA cell bodies affected neither side-occupancy nor locomotion velocity (Figures 3E–3H). While mPFC→NAc may preferentially target circuitry promoting aversion behavior, mPFC→VTA may not or may instead target neurons promoting both appetitive and aversive responses. Next, we trained mice to lever-press for reward and asked whether pairing stimulation of the mPFC→NAc projection with lever presses could suppress simple reward seeking (Figure 3I). Activation of mPFC→NAc (Figures 3J and 3K) suppressed neither reward-seeking nor lever-pressing rate (nor did activation of mPFC→VTA; Figures 3L and 3M). We then asked whether stimulation of either projection could suppress reward seeking in the setting of contingent foot-shock. To avoid floor effects, we reduced shock probability from 30% to 10%, resulting in ∼40%–50% reduction in lever-pressing rate on shock days (Figure 3N). Here, even on shock days, optogenetic stimulation of mPFC→NAc or mPFC→VTA still had no effect on lever-pressing rate (Figures 3O–3R), suggesting a need for more refined targeting to identify a causally relev"
https://openalex.org/W2731059737,"AMPA receptors mediate fast excitatory neurotransmission in the mammalian brain and transduce the binding of presynaptically released glutamate to the opening of a transmembrane cation channel. Within the postsynaptic density, however, AMPA receptors coassemble with transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs), yielding a receptor complex with altered gating kinetics, pharmacology, and pore properties. Here, we elucidate structures of the GluA2-TARP γ2 complex in the presence of the partial agonist kainate or the full agonist quisqualate together with a positive allosteric modulator or with quisqualate alone. We show how TARPs sculpt the ligand-binding domain gating ring, enhancing kainate potency and diminishing the ensemble of desensitized states. TARPs encircle the receptor ion channel, stabilizing M2 helices and pore loops, illustrating how TARPs alter receptor pore properties. Structural and computational analysis suggests the full agonist and modulator complex harbors an ion-permeable channel gate, providing the first view of an activated AMPA receptor."

Although the prefusion closed conformation is a potential target for inhibition, development of small-molecule leads has been stymied by difficulties in obtaining structural information. Here, we report crystal structures at 3.8-Å resolution of an HIV-1-Env trimer with BMS-378806 and a derivative BMS-626529 for which a prodrug version is currently in Phase III clinical trials. Both lead candidates recognized an induced binding pocket that was mostly excluded from solvent and comprised of Env elements from a conserved helix and the β20-21 hairpin. In both structures, the β20-21 region assumed a conformation distinct from prefusion-closed and CD4-bound states. Together with biophysical and antigenicity characterizations, the structures illuminate the allosteric and competitive mechanisms by which these small-molecule leads inhibit CD4-induced structural changes in Env."
https://openalex.org/W2745668358,"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a leading genetic cause of intellectual disability and autism. FXS results from the loss of function of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), which represses translation of target transcripts. Most of the well-characterized target transcripts of FMRP are synaptic proteins, yet targeting these proteins has not provided effective treatments. We examined a group of FMRP targets that encode transcriptional regulators, particularly chromatin-associated proteins. Loss of FMRP in mice results in widespread changes in chromatin regulation and aberrant gene expression. To determine if targeting epigenetic factors could reverse phenotypes associated with the disorder, we focused on Brd4, a BET protein and chromatin reader targeted by FMRP. Inhibition of Brd4 function alleviated many of the phenotypes associated with FXS. We conclude that loss of FMRP results in significant epigenetic misregulation and that targeting transcription via epigenetic regulators like Brd4 may provide new treatments for FXS."
https://openalex.org/W2747264648,"Recent large-scale genetic sequencing efforts have identified rare coding variants in genes in the triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TRL) clearance pathway that are protective against coronary heart disease (CHD), independently of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. Insight into the mechanisms of protection of these variants may facilitate the development of new therapies for lowering TRL levels. The gene APOC3 encodes apoC-III, a critical inhibitor of triglyceride (TG) lipolysis and remnant TRL clearance. Here we report a detailed interrogation of the mechanism of TRL lowering by the APOC3 Ala43Thr (A43T) variant, the only missense (rather than protein-truncating) variant in APOC3 reported to be TG lowering and protective against CHD. We found that both human APOC3 A43T heterozygotes and mice expressing human APOC3 A43T display markedly reduced circulating apoC-III levels. In mice, this reduction is due to impaired binding of A43T apoC-III to lipoproteins and accelerated renal catabolism of free apoC-III. Moreover, the reduced content of apoC-III in TRLs resulted in accelerated clearance of circulating TRLs. On the basis of this protective mechanism, we developed a monoclonal antibody targeting lipoprotein-bound human apoC-III that promotes circulating apoC-III clearance in mice expressing human APOC3 and enhances TRL catabolism in vivo. These data reveal the molecular mechanism by which a missense variant in APOC3 causes reduced circulating TG levels and, hence, protects from CHD. This protective mechanism has the potential to be exploited as a new therapeutic approach to reduce apoC-III levels and circulating TRL burden."
https://openalex.org/W2951384183,"How GABAergic interneurons regulate segregation and integration among pyramidal cells to separate brain networks remains unclear. In this study, the authors show that subsets of chandelier cells in prelimbic area mediate directional inhibitory control of both local pyramidal neuron ensembles and global cortical subnetworks. The neocortex comprises multiple information processing streams mediated by subsets of glutamatergic pyramidal cells (PCs) that receive diverse inputs and project to distinct targets. How GABAergic interneurons regulate the segregation and communication among intermingled PC subsets that contribute to separate brain networks remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that a subset of GABAergic chandelier cells (ChCs) in the prelimbic cortex, which innervate PCs at spike initiation site, selectively control PCs projecting to the basolateral amygdala (BLAPC) compared to those projecting to contralateral cortex (CCPC). These ChCs in turn receive preferential input from local and contralateral CCPCs as opposed to BLAPCs and BLA neurons (the prelimbic cortex–BLA network). Accordingly, optogenetic activation of ChCs rapidly suppresses BLAPCs and BLA activity in freely behaving mice. Thus, the exquisite connectivity of ChCs not only mediates directional inhibition between local PC ensembles but may also shape communication hierarchies between global networks."

PknG mutant displayed minimal growth in nutrient-limited conditions, suggesting its role in modulating cellular metabolism. Intracellular metabolic profiling revealed that PknG is necessary for efficient metabolic adaptation during hypoxia. Notably, the PknG mutant exhibited a reductive shift in mycothiol redox potential and compromised stress response. Exposure to antibiotics and hypoxic environment resulted in higher oxidative shift in mycothiol redox potential of PknG mutant compared with the wild type. Persistence during latency-like conditions required kinase activity and thioredoxin motifs of PknG and is mediated through phosphorylation of a central metabolic regulator GarA. Finally, using a guinea pig model of infection, we assessed the in vivo role of PknG in manifestation of disease pathology and established a role for PknG in the formation of stable granuloma, hallmark structures of latent tuberculosis. Taken together, PknG-mediated GarA phosphorylation is important for maintenance of both mycobacterial physiology and redox poise, an axis that is dispensable for survival under normoxic conditions but is critical for non-replicating persistence of mycobacteria.

In response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, host mounts a robust immune response, which contains the bacterium in ∼90% of the cases, leading to latent infection. During latency, bacilli become non-responsive to nearly all known anti-TB antibiotics (1McDermott W. Inapparent infection: relation of latent and dormant infections to microbial persistence.Public Health Rep. 1959; 74: 485-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), serving as the major reservoir of the pathogen. Granuloma formation represents the tissue hallmark of the latent mycobacterium. This bunch of immune aggregates, previously thought to be beneficial for host by curtailing bacteria in a nutritionally starved, hypoxic environment, is now being reexamined as a niche for survival and dissemination during latency and reactivation (2Davis J.M. Ramakrishnan L. The role of the granuloma in expansion and dissemination of early tuberculous infection.Cell. 2009; 136: 37-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). M. tuberculosis is a facultative aerobe, which can survive during hypoxia only if oxygen is gradually depleted (3Wayne L.G. Lin K.Y. Glyoxylate metabolism and adaptation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to survival under anaerobic conditions.Infect. Immun. 1982; 37: 1042-1049Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Wayne L.G. Dynamics of submerged growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis under aerobic and microaerophilic conditions.Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1976; 114: 807-811PubMed Google Scholar). However, sudden anaerobiosis is lethal for the bacilli (5Wayne L.G. Diaz G.A. Autolysis and secondary growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in submerged culture.J. Bacteriol. 1967; 93: 1374-1381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), highlighting the importance of sensory mechanisms necessary for the adaptation to a hypoxic environment. M. tuberculosis down-regulates transcription of key complexes of the electron transport chain in response to hypoxia, and ATP levels are reported to be approximately 5 times lower as compared with the replicating counterparts (6Rao S.P.

Eukaryotic-like serine/threonine protein kinases (STPKs) are regulatory elements associated with signal recognition and adaptive responses. M. tuberculosis encodes 11 STPKs, which are involved in a myriad of functions, such as cell division, virulence, transport of metabolites, and regulation of metabolic processes (10Chakraborti P.K.

Nguyen L. Prescianotto-Baschong C. Huygen K. Klebl B. Thompson C. Bacher G. Pieters J. Protein kinase G from pathogenic mycobacteria promotes survival within macrophages.Science. 2004; 304: 1800-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). However, recent reports suggests a more definitive role of PknG in regulating bacterial metabolism (14Rieck B. Degiacomi G. Zimmermann M. Cascioferro A. Boldrin F. Lazar-Adler N.R. Bottrill A.R. le Chevalier F. Frigui W. Bellinzoni M. Lisa M.N. Alzari P.M. Nguyen L. Brosch R. Sauer U. Manganelli R. O'Hare H.M.

This is supported by its ubiquitous presence across pathogenic and non-pathogenic species. PknG-mediated in vitro phosphorylation of GarA relieves its interaction with α-ketoglutarate decarboxylase and glutamate dehydrogenase (15O'Hare H.M. Durán R. Cerveñansky C. Bellinzoni M. Wehenkel A.M. Pritsch O. Obal G. Baumgartner J. Vialaret J. Johnsson K. Alzari P.M. Regulation of glutamate metabolism by protein kinases in mycobacteria.Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 70: 1408-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Recently, amino acid availability was shown to act as a stimulus for PknG-mediated GarA phosphorylation (14Rieck B. Degiacomi G. Zimmermann M. Cascioferro A. Boldrin F. Lazar-Adler N.R. Bottrill A.R. le Chevalier F. Frigui W. Bellinzoni M. Lisa M.N. Alzari P.M. Nguyen L. Brosch R. Sauer U. Manganelli R. O'Hare H.M. PknG senses amino acid availability to control metabolism and virulence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.PLoS Pathog. 2017; 13: e1006399Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Furthermore, upon oxidative stress, PknG-mediated phosphorylation of L13 promotes its interaction with RenU, which in turn regulates the NADH levels (16Wolff K.A. de la Peña A.H. Nguyen H.T. Pham T.H. Amzel L.M. Gabelli S.B. Nguyen L. A redox regulatory system critical for mycobacterial survival in macrophages and biofilm development.PLoS Pathog. 2015; 11: e1004839Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Disruption of PknG enhances the susceptibility of mycobacteria toward antibiotics (17Wolff K.A. Nguyen H.T. Cartabuke R.H. Singh A. Ogwang S. Nguyen L. Protein kinase G is required for intrinsic antibiotic resistance in mycobacteria.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2009; 53: 3515-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), attenuates growth during stationary phase (18Cowley S. Ko M. Pick N. Chow R. Downing K.J. Gordhan B.G. Betts J.C. Mizrahi V. Smith D.A. Stokes R.W. Av-Gay Y. The Mycobacterium tuberculosis protein serine/threonine kinase PknG is linked to cellular glutamate/glutamine levels and is important for growth in vivo.Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 1691-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and impairs the biofilm formation (16Wolff K.A. de la Peña A.H. Nguyen H.T. Pham T.H. Amzel L.M. Gabelli S.B. Nguyen L. A redox regulatory system critical for mycobacterial survival in macrophages and biofilm development.PLoS Pathog. 2015; 11: e1004839Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), suggesting a plausible role in latency. However, to date, the role of PknG in latency and maintenance of redox poise has not been elucidated. In this study, we demonstrate the role of PknG in mycobacterial survival through in vitro models of latency like hypoxia, persisters, and nutrition starvation. Real-time redox measurements demonstrated an enhanced oxidative shift in the presence of antibiotics and hypoxia, resulting in the lower survival of the pknG mutant. The absence of PknG not only limits utilization of host-derived carbon sources but also results in lower metabolic activity compared with the wild type. Our study demonstrates that by regulating the TCA cycle through GarA phosphorylation and maintenance of the precarious redox status of bacilli, PknG augments the survival of mycobacteria during latency-like conditions. Moreover, we establish that PknG also plays a critical role in the formation of stable granulomas in guinea pigs, repositories of dormant mycobacteria. In vivo survival of the pknG mutant in mice is more attenuated during the early phase of infection (18Cowley S. Ko M. Pick N. Chow R. Downing K.J. Gordhan B.G. Betts J.C. Mizrahi V. Smith D.A. Stokes R.W. Av-Gay Y. The Mycobacterium tuberculosis protein serine/threonine kinase PknG is linked to cellular glutamate/glutamine levels and is important for growth in vivo.Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 1691-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), indicating a role in subverting host-inflicted stresses, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitrogen intermediates, and low pH. Thioredoxin motifs, present at the N terminus of PknG, are known to protect mycobacteria against oxidative defense of host innate cells. To elucidate the role of PknG in combating host-imposed defenses, mycobacterial strains were exposed to various stresses in vitro. Survival of RvΔG was 100- and 10-fold lower as compared with Rv and RvΔG::G in the presence of ROS generators like cumene hydroperoxide (CHP) and menadione, respectively (Fig. 1, a and b). Deletion of PknG also leads to ∼10-fold higher susceptibility of mycobacteria in acidic media (Fig. 1c). Similarly, pknG mutant had reduced survival in the presence of 0.1% SDS (Fig. 1d). The lack of restoration in the complemented strain might be the result of overexpression of PknG (Fig. 1d). Together, these results suggest that PknG plays a critical role in surmounting a plethora of insults imposed by the host. The success of M. tuberculosis as a pathogen relies on its immense ability to persist inside hypoxic granulomas for decades by undergoing transcriptional and translational remodeling of redox-responsive genes. Expression of pknG has been shown to be up-regulated during hypoxia in both Mycobacterium smegmatis (19Berney M. Cook G.M. Unique flexibility in energy metabolism allows mycobacteria to combat starvation and hypoxia.PLoS One. 2010; 5: e8614Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and M. tuberculosis (20Sherman D.R. Voskuil M. Schnappinger D. Liao R. Harrell M.I. Schoolnik G.K. Regulation of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis hypoxic response gene encoding α-crystallin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 7534-7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Moreover, PknG has been shown to be important for biofilm formation (16Wolff K.A. de la Peña A.H. Nguyen H.T. Pham T.H. Amzel L.M. Gabelli S.B. Nguyen L. A redox regulatory system critical for mycobacterial survival in macrophages and biofilm development.PLoS Pathog. 2015; 11: e1004839Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), whose core is hypoxic (21Anand A. Verma P. Singh A.K. Kaushik S. Pandey R. Shi C. Kaur H. Chawla M. Elechalawar C.K. Kumar D. Yang Y. Bhavesh N.S. Banerjee R. Dash D. Singh A. et al.Polyketide quinones are alternate intermediate electron carriers during mycobacterial respiration in oxygen-deficient niches.Mol. Cell. 2015; 60: 637-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To comprehensively understand the role of PknG in hypoxia, we examined the survival of the pknG mutant in a modified Wayne's model (22Wayne L.G. Hayes L.G. An in vitro model for sequential study of shiftdown of Mycobacterium tuberculosis through two stages of nonreplicating persistence.Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2062-2069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of PknG was resulted in ∼100-fold lower survival at 40 days post-hypoxia in M. tuberculosis (Fig. 2a). Expression blots demonstrated that PknG levels reduced significantly at day 20 of hypoxia with a sharp increase at day 40 (Fig. 2b). To elucidate the functional conservation across pathogenic (M. tuberculosis) and non-pathogenic (M. smegmatis) mycobacteria with respect to the hypoxia phenotype, we generated a pknG deletion mutant in M. smegmatis (Fig. 2, c–e). Similar results were obtained with M. smegmatis strains, wherein MsmΔG mutant showed significantly attenuated survival during hypoxia in comparison with M. smegmatis and MsmΔG::G (complementation strain) (Fig. 2f). Anaerobic cells have been shown to be refractory to antibiotics (23Gomez J.E. McKinney J.D. M. tuberculosis persistence, latency, and drug tolerance.Tuberculosis. 2004; 84: 29-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Such phenotypically drug-tolerant cells are called persisters and are also used as an in vitro model of latency (24Alnimr A.M. Dormancy models for Mycobacterium tuberculosis: a minireview.Braz. J. Microbiol. 2015; 46: 641-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To examine the contribution of PknG in the survival of persisters, we first determined the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of isoniazid and found it to be similar for both wild-type and pknG mutant strains (data not shown). Survival of persisters was scored in the presence of isoniazid (50× MIC) for M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis and was found to be drastically lower (∼10–30-fold) for pknG mutant (Fig. 3, a and b) in comparison with the parental and complementation strains. Based on our observations that PknG promotes mycobacterial survival during hypoxia and abets drug tolerance, we suggest that PknG ameliorates survival of mycobacteria during latency-like conditions. Dormancy is tenuously linked with nutrient starvation inside granuloma of infected animals (25Nyka W. Studies on the effect of starvation on mycobacteria.Infect. Immun. 1974; 9: 843-850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the role of PknG in the survival of M. tuberculosis during its growth in nutrient-rich and limiting media. Whereas pknG mutant in M. tuberculosis had no survival defect in 7H9+ADC medium, its growth was severely compromised in nutrient-limited Dubos medium, which could be restored upon in trans complementation (Fig. 3c). Whereas supplementation with glucose partially restored the growth of the pknG mutant, the addition of acetate, succinate, or fumarate failed to rescue the growth defect (Fig. 3c). These results suggest that the levels of multiple metabolites of the TCA cycle may be lower in the pknG mutant. M. tuberculosis adapts to oxygen limitation and nutrient depletion by remodeling its TCA cycle (26Betts J.C. Lukey P.T. Robb L.C. McAdam R.A. Duncan K.

Fumarate reductase activity maintains an energized membrane in anaerobic Mycobacterium tuberculosis.PLoS Pathog. 2011; 7: e1002287Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). PknG has been shown to in vitro phosphorylate TCA cycle enzyme, malate dehydrogenase (29Wang X.M. Soetaert K. Peirs P. Kalai M. Fontaine V. Dehaye J.P. Lefèvre P. Biochemical analysis of the NAD+-dependent malate dehydrogenase, a substrate of several serine/threonine protein kinases of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.PLoS One. 2015; 10: e0123327PubMed Google Scholar), and central carbon metabolic regulator GarA (15O'Hare H.M. Durán R. Cerveñansky C. Bellinzoni M. Wehenkel A.M. Pritsch O. Obal G. Baumgartner J. Vialaret J. Johnsson K. Alzari P.M. Regulation of glutamate metabolism by protein kinases in mycobacteria.Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 70: 1408-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar); thus, it may directly or indirectly regulate the TCA cycle. Therefore, we examined the metabolic profile of the central carbon metabolites in M. smegmatis and MsmΔG in normoxia and hypoxia (Fig. 4 and supplemental Fig. S1). Interestingly, the levels of most of the glycolysis and TCA cycle metabolites were significantly lower in MsmΔG compared with M. smegmatis during normoxia, suggesting that mycobacteria are metabolically not as active in the absence of PknG (Fig. 4). In corroboration with the previous studies (28Watanabe S. Zimmermann M. Goodwin M.B. Sauer U. Barry 3rd, C.E. Boshoff H.I. Fumarate reductase activity maintains an energized membrane in anaerobic Mycobacterium tuberculosis.PLoS Pathog. 2011; 7: e1002287Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 30Fang X. Wallqvist A. Reifman J. Modeling phenotypic metabolic adaptations of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv under hypoxia.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2012; 8: e1002688Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), we observed that the wild-type mycobacterial strain effectively adapts to micro-aerophilic conditions by significantly waning its central carbon metabolism (∼3–4-fold; Fig. 4 and supplemental Table S1). Interestingly, the decrease in metabolite levels in hypoxic conditions was not as perceptible in the MsmΔG mutant (∼2 fold; Fig. 4 and supplemental Table S1). Taken together, we propose that PknG aids in efficient metabolic remodeling during hypoxia, and its absence results in inept metabolic adaptation, eventually compromising the survival. PknG expression is induced by NADH, a key player in metabolism and redox homeostasis (16Wolff K.A. de la Peña A.H. Nguyen H.T. Pham T.H. Amzel L.M. Gabelli S.B. Nguyen L. A redox regulatory system critical for mycobacterial survival in macrophages and biofilm development.PLoS Pathog. 2015; 11: e1004839Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thioredoxin motifs of PknG render its kinase activity sensitive to variations in the redox state of the microenvironment (31Tiwari D. Singh R.K. Goswami K. Verma S.K. Prakash B. Nandicoori V.K. Key residues in Mycobacterium tuberculosis protein kinase G play a role in regulating kinase activity and survival in the host.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 27467-27479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that lower survival of pknG mutant under latency-like conditions is probably due to its inability to maintain intramycobacterial redox balance. To test our hypothesis, we measured the precise perturbations in the mycothiol redox potential (EMSH) upon deletion of PknG, using a highly sensitive, noninvasive redox biosensor specific to mycobacteria (Mrx1-roGFP2) (32Bhaskar A. Chawla M. Mehta M. Parikh P. Chandra P. Bhave D. Kumar D. Carroll K.S. Singh A. Reengineering redox sensitive GFP to measure mycothiol redox potential of Mycobacterium tuberculosis during infection.PLoS Pathog. 2014; 10: e1003902Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). An increase in the fluorescence excitation ratio at 405/488 nm indicates oxidative stress, whereas a decrease corresponds to reductive stress (32Bhaskar A. Chawla M. Mehta M. Parikh P. Chandra P. Bhave D. Kumar D. Carroll K.S. Singh A. Reengineering redox sensitive GFP to measure mycothiol redox potential of Mycobacterium tuberculosis during infection.PLoS Pathog. 2014; 10: e1003902Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We found that the intracellular redox state of bacteria was significantly shifted toward reductive EMSH in MsmΔG and RvΔG as compared with the parental strains (Fig. 5a). In trans complementation of PknG restored the redox state in MsmΔG::G (Fig. 5a). In addition, we examined the antioxidant capacity with increasing dose of H2O2 and found that deletion of PknG results in oxidized EMSH in M. smegmatis (Fig. 5b) and M. tuberculosis (data not shown). Analysis of redox status after low-dose H2O2 exposure revealed that, whereas M. smegmatis was able to restore its resting redox state within ∼15 min, the ratiometric -fold change was higher in MsmΔG, and it failed to return to its ambient redox state even after 25 min (Fig. 5c). These results suggest that enhanced sensitivity of the pknG mutant to oxidative stress (Fig. 1, a and b) is due to its inability to maintain redox poise. Furthermore, exposure to isoniazid resulted in enhanced oxidative stress in RvΔG (Fig. 5d) and MsmΔG (Fig. 5e). This phenomenon was not isoniazid-specific, as exposure to other anti-mycobacterial antibiotics like rifampicin and clofazimine also lead to 3–4-fold higher oxidized environment in MsmΔG, as early as 6 h after antibiotic treatment (Fig. 5, f and g). Most importantly, even under hypoxia, MsmΔG was ineffective in maintaining redox homeostasis (Fig. 5h), which corroborated with its reduced survival (Fig. 2, a and f). Together, these results demonstrate that PknG is crucial for maintenance of redox homeostasis in in vitro models of latent mycobacteria. PknG harbors three domains: an N-terminal rubredoxin domain with two CXXC thioredoxin motifs, a central kinase domain, and a C-terminal tetratricopeptide domain (Fig. 6a). The kinase activity of PknG is essential for its established role in virulence and metabolism (13Walburger A. Koul A. Ferrari G. Nguyen L. Prescianotto-Baschong C. Huygen K. Klebl B. Thompson C. Bacher G. Pieters J. Protein kinase G from pathogenic mycobacteria promotes survival within macrophages.Science. 2004; 304: 1800-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 31Tiwari D.

Chem. 2009; 284: 27467-27479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The presence of thioredoxin motifs is necessary for modulation of its kinase activity in response to changes in redox environment (31Tiwari D. Singh R.K. Goswami K. Verma S.K. Prakash B. Nandicoori V.K. Key residues in Mycobacterium tuberculosis protein kinase G play a role in regulating kinase activity and survival in the host.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 27467-27479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thus, we investigated the contributions of kinase activity and thioredoxin domain in abetting survival of mycobacteria during latency-like conditions. The MsmΔG mutant was complemented with either wild-type (MsmΔG::G) or kinase-inactive PknG (MsmΔG::GK) or thioredoxin mutant, wherein cysteine residues were mutated to alanines (MsmΔG::TT) and checked for survival in latency models (Fig. 6b). In agreement with our previous results (Fig. 2, a and f), deletion of PknG led to reduced survival during hypoxia (Fig. 6b). Interestingly, whereas in trans expression of PknG was able to rescue the survival defect, complementation with kinase-inactive PknG or thioredoxin mutant failed to do so, indicating the importance of kinase activity as well as the functional thioredoxin motifs of PknG (Fig. 6b). Similar observations were found with the persister model of latency (Fig. 6c). PknG and PknB have been shown previously to in vitro phosphorylate GarA at residues Thr-21 and Thr-22 (15O'Hare H.M. Durán R. Cerveñansky C. Bellinzoni M. Wehenkel A.M. Pritsch O. Obal G. Baumgartner J. Vialaret J. Johnsson K. Alzari P.M. Regulation of glutamate metabolism by protein kinases in mycobacteria.Mol.

Biol. 2005; 350: 953-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), respectively (Fig. 7a). GarA phosphorylation at Thr-21 alleviates the inhibition of α-ketoglutarate decarboxylase and glutamate dehydrogenase, leading to derepression of the TCA cycle (15O'Hare H.M. Durán R. Cerveñansky C.

However, despite anatomical links between the two, few studies have tested the importance of hippocampal–OFC interactions. Here, we recorded OFC neurons in rats performing a decision making task while suppressing activity in a key hippocampal output region, the ventral subiculum. OFC neurons encoded information about expected outcomes and rats’ responses.

In addition, ventral subiculum inactivation prevented OFC neurons from integrating information about features of outcomes to form holistic representations of the outcomes available in specific trial blocks.

Moreover, theories of hippocampal and OFC function have converged to a surprising degree, implicating the pair in broadly similar classes of cognitive processes (Ramus et al., 2007Ramus S.J.

Springer, 2014: 517-560Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). While hippocampus is best known as a cognitive map of space (O’Keefe and Nadel, 1978O’Keefe J. Nadel L.

Despite this convergence, few studies have examined how perturbing interactions between OFC and hippocampus affects behavior or neural activity in either region. Here, we tested how suppressing neurons in one intermediary that links hippocampus to OFC—the ventral subiculum—affected decision making behavior and associated neural representations in the OFC. Neurons were recorded as rats chose between outcomes that differed in size and flavor and whose location changed or reversed across blocks of trials. Reversal tasks have been used extensively to probe OFC function (Cooch et al., 2015Cooch N.K. Stalnaker T.A. Wied H.M. Bali-Chaudhary S. McDannald M.A. Liu T.-L. Schoenbaum G.

Furthermore, the arrangement of trials into blocks creates periods during which there are unique and temporarily stable rules governing how to obtain the rewarding outcomes. Such trial blocks have been argued to constitute “abstract contexts” or states (Saez et al., 2015Saez A. Rigotti M. Ostojic S. Fusi S. Salzman C.D. Abstract context representations in primate amygdala and prefrontal cortex.Neuron. 2015; 87: 869-881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), the use of which has been proposed to depend on OFC (Wilson et al., 2014Wilson R.C.

Here we test whether such outcome-relevant block or state representations depend on output from hippocampus (Wikenheiser and Schoenbaum, 2016Wikenheiser A.M. Schoenbaum G. Over the river, through the woods: cognitive maps in the hippocampus and orbitofrontal cortex.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2016; 17: 513-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Prior to recording, rats (n = 4) were trained on an odor-guided decision making task (Figure 1A). In each trial, rats sampled one of three odor cues presented in a central odor port. The odor port was flanked by two fluid-delivery wells, where liquid rewards were dispensed. Two odors instructed rats that a response to only one fluid well, either the left or right would be rewarded on that trial (“forced-choice” trials). A third cue indicated that responses to either well would be rewarded (“free-choice” trials). The rewards delivered at each fluid well differed in flavor (chocolate or vanilla milk) and size (three drops or one drop) and were presented in complementary pairs, such that the flavor and size of the reward at one fluid well unambiguously determined the flavor and size of reward available at the other well. The pairing of outcomes and fluid wells was stable for blocks of approximately 60 trials, after which the location of the large and small rewards reversed positions. Block transitions were unsignaled. After rats reached proficiency on the task, they were injected with an AAV construct targeting the ventral subiculum bilaterally, resulting in expression of the inhibitory opsin molecule eNpHR3.0-eYFP under the control of the CamKII promoter (Figures 1B and 1C). At the same time, bundles of electrodes were implanted, targeting the OFC. After recovery from surgery and time to allow viral expression, the rats received several sessions of reminder training during which they were acclimated to the recording/fiber optic cable before neural recording sessions were conducted. During all neural recording sessions, light was delivered to the ventral subiculum for the full duration of each trial. In eNpHR sessions (n = 30), 620 nm light was delivered through the implanted optical fibers to activate eNpHR and suppress the activity of expressing neurons. In control sessions (n = 26), 450 nm light (which falls largely outside the range of the eNpHR3.0 frequency sensitivity range; Zhang et al., 2007Zhang F. Wang L.-P. Brauner M. Liewald J.F. Kay K. Watzke N. Wood P.G. Bamberg E. Nagel G. Gottschalk A. Deisseroth K. Multimodal fast optical interrogation of neural circuitry.Nature. 2007; 446: 633-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar) was delivered instead to control for the effects of light delivery to the tissue. In both control and eNpHR sessions, rats exhibited a preference for the large reward. This was evident on both free- (Figure 2A) and forced-choice (Figures 2B and 2C) trials. On forced-choice trials, the rats were significantly more accurate (eNpHR: p = 1.20 × 10−3; W = 1,065; rank sum test; control: p = 6.90 × 10−3; W = 1,625.5; rank sum test) and faster (eNpHR: p = 0.02; W = 713; rank sum test; control: p = 5.40 × 10−3; W = 1,005; rank sum test) when the large reward was at stake (Figures 2B and 2C). Notably these effects did not differ between session types, indicating that suppressing ventral subiculum neurons did not interfere with cue-guided responses or with differences in behavior that did not require comparison of the different rewards. By contrast, while rats also showed a strong preference for the large reward on free-choice trials in both eNpHR and control sessions, there was an effect of ventral subiculum suppression (Figure 2A). Large choice rate dropped transiently following block switches in both types of session and then rose again as rats updated their behavior to reflect the changed reward contingencies. However, it was significantly higher in control than eNpHR sessions (p = 5.00 × 10−3; W = 734; rank sum test; Figure 2A, inset), an effect which was present even when large choice rate was computed separately for the first 20 trials and last 20 trials of blocks (Pearly = 0.02; Wearly = 727.5; Plate = 0.02; Wlate = 773; rank sum tests). In shuffled surrogate datasets in which the identity of eNpHR and control sessions were randomly reassigned, only rarely (27 of 1,000 instances; 2.7%) did the magnitude of the difference in large choice rate between the two groups equal or exceed the difference observed in the un-shuffled dataset, suggesting that session-to-session variability could not account for the difference in behavior between control and eNpHR sessions. We recorded activity from 229 OFC units (124 neurons in control sessions; 105 neurons in eNpHR sessions; Table S1). Firing rates were significantly lower in OFC neurons during ventral subiculum inactivation (p = 0.03; W = 1.10 × 104; rank sum test), but not during the intertrial interval when no light stimulation was active (p = 0.33; W = 1.15 × 104; rank sum test, Figure S1). Baseline firing rates of OFC neurons were stable over time in both control and eNpHR sessions (Figure S1). To examine units’ general response properties, we divided correctly performed forced-choice trials (which were free from the confound of behavioral differences between control and eNpHR sessions) into seven 0.5 s epochs (Figure 3A), computed firing rates in each epoch, and sorted the neurons according to the time of their peak firing rate (Figure 3B). This revealed a significant effect of subiculum inactivation on the time course of neural responses in OFC. Specifically, during control sessions, many neurons were most active during the reward anticipation epoch, the period after rats had entered one of the fluid wells, but before the outcome was delivered, whereas during eNpHR sessions, significantly fewer neurons were maximally active during this epoch (Figure 3C; p = 7.14 × 10−3; z228 = 2.16; z test for population proportions, corrected for multiple comparisons). The population’s average firing rate followed a similar pattern (Figure 3D): cells recorded during eNpHR sessions showed a lower mean firing rate as rats moved from the odor port to the reward well, and this difference persisted through the reward anticipation period. These data suggest that hippocampal outflow via ventral subiculum exerted its greatest influence over neural activity in OFC during reward anticipation, the interval bounded by action initiation and outcome receipt. The previous analyses showed that inhibiting ventral subiculum altered the response dynamics of OFC neurons but did not address whether the information they encoded was affected. Consistent with previous work (Feierstein et al., 2006Feierstein C.E. Quirk M.C. Uchida N. Sosulski D.L. Mainen Z.F.

Neurosci. 2009; 29: 2569-2574Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), we observed that during the reward anticipation period many OFC neurons represented features of the task related to the anticipated outcomes. Indeed, all three variables characterizing the outcomes—response direction (whether the animal chose the left or right fluid well), outcome flavor (chocolate or vanilla), and outcome size (large or small)—were prominently encoded by individual OFC neurons (Figure 4). To quantify selectivity for these variables across all OFC neurons recorded during task performance, we fit generalized linear models to each units’ firing rate at every point throughout correct, forced-choice trials and plotted the proportion of neurons selective for each variable (after correction for multiple comparisons) at each moment. This revealed that selectivity for each of the individual variables increased during the odor sampling epoch, the earliest point in a trial that rats had information about the available actions and outcomes, and remained elevated during action execution and reward anticipation. However, while the proportion of neurons selective for outcome size and flavor was generally similar between eNpHR and control sessions (Figure 5A), the proportion selective for response direction was significantly lower in eNpHR sessions at nearly every point after rats sampled the odor cue. Collapsing across task epochs, the fraction of neurons that were selective for at least one variable during at least one epoch between odor sampling and reward anticipation was significantly lower in eNpHR sessions (66% control sessions; 52% eNpHR sessions; p = 0.02; z228 = 2.38; z test for population proportions; Figure 5B). This difference was driven by a decrease in the proportion of cells selective for response direction (Figure 5C; p = 4.04 × 10−3; z228 = 2.87; z test for population proportions). There was no significant change in the proportion of cells with significant responses to either outcome size (despite a numerical decline; p = 0.13; z228 = 1.48; z test for population proportions) or outcome flavor (p = 0.91; z228 = 0.12; z test for population proportions). This pattern of selectivity was generally consistent across rats (Figure S2). The preceding analyses showed that individual neurons in OFC represented the individual features characterizing the anticipated outcomes—their size, flavor, and location—and that ventral subiculum inactivation weakened representations of at least one of these variables, response direction. These analyses did not, however, speak to how information about outcomes was integrated at the population level. To address this question, we tested whether the chosen outcome (its direction, flavor, and size) could be decoded from OFC firing patterns during the outcome anticipation period, when many OFC neurons were active and the largest difference in neural activity between control and eNpHR sessions occurred. The structure of the task resulted in eight unique direction × flavor × size outcomes. We used linear discriminant analysis to measure how well the outcome chosen on a given trial could be decoded from the pattern of firing across neurons. Synthetic OFC pseudoensembles were generated by randomly selecting subsets of units from the population of recorded cells, using data from half of the correctly executed, forced-choice trials to fit the classifier and the remainder to test classification performance. The process of drawing and testing pseudoensembles of different numbers of neurons was repeated 250 times for both eNpHR and control neurons. Classification accuracy exceeded the 1 in 8 chance level for both eNpHR and control pseudoensembles (Figure 6A). However, control ensembles outperformed ensembles composed of neurons drawn from eNpHR sessions—a two-way ANOVA with factors session type (control or eNpHR) and pseudoensemble size revealed significant main effects of session type (p = 1.00 × 10−273; F1,4482 = 1441.37; Cohen’s D = 0.92) and pseudoensemble size (p < 2.23 × 10−308; F8,4482 = 248.30), along with a significant interaction (p = 6.45 × 10−75; F8,4482 = 48.10). Post hoc tests (paired t tests, corrected for multiple comparisons) revealed that decoding of chosen outcomes was more accurate in control session data for pseudoensembles larger than two neurons. Examining how errors in classification were distributed provided some additional insight into the underlying differences in information processing between control and eNpHR sessions. Misclassified control trials were typically correctly identified as left or right choices, as evidenced by the greater proportion of erroneous classifications confined within the upper-left and lower-right quadrants of the confusion matrix (Figure 6B). Consistent with the reduction in directional information observed at the level of single units (Figure 5), this pattern was attenuated in eNpHR pseudoensembles. However, if ventral subiculum suppression had only affected this direction information, then errors in eNpHR session classification should have distributed to outcomes of the same flavor and size as the rat’s choice, only in the opposite location. The actual pattern of misclassification appears more complicated than this. Similarly, when we used the classifier to decode pairs of variables (Figure 6C), the disparity between eNpHR and control pseudoensembles was greatest for pairs that included response direction, for example direction and flavor (Psession type = 6.45 × 10−90; F1,4482 = 423.12; Cohen’s D = 0.56; Ppseudoensemble size = 3.94 × 10−158; F8,4482 = 103.00; Pinteraction = 5.77 × 10−11; F8,4482 = 8.12; two-way ANOVA with factors session type and pseudoensemble size; Figure 6C, left) or direction and size (Psession type = 3.04 × 10−111; F1,4482 = 531.56; Cohen’s D = 0.62; Ppseudoensemble size = 2.46 × 10−195; F8,4482 = 129.02; Pinteraction = 1.13 × 10−9; F8,4482 = 7.30; two-way ANOVA with factors session type and pseudoensemble size; Figure 6C, middle). Yet deficits in decoding flavor and size (ignoring direction) were also evident (Psession type = 1.76 × 10−18; F1,4482 = 77.61; Cohen’s D = 0.26; Ppseudoensemble size = 3.81 × 10−49; F8,4482 = 31.90; Pinteraction = 0.01; F8,4482 = 2.38; two-way ANOVA with factors session type and pseudoensemble size; Figure 6C, middle). These results hint at a more complicated effect of ventral subiculum suppression on OFC encoding of anticipated outcomes. To explore how ventral subiculum suppression affected integrated OFC outcome encoding with more precision, beyond simply cataloging its effect on the representation of individual outcome features, we fit each OFC unit’s responses during reward anticipation with a generalized linear model as described previously (Figure 5), using response direction, outcome flavor, and outcome size as predictors of firing rate. Such models use a weighted combination of predictor variables to explain firing rate across trials. The difference between model-estimated and observed firing rates—the residuals of the model—represent the portion of the neuron’s firing rate response that is not explained by the predictor variables. Testing these residuals in the discriminant classification analysis described above (Figure 6) allowed us to ask whether information about chosen outcome might exist in OFC neural responses independent of the influence of size, flavor, and direction and, further, whether any such integrated representations are also affected by ventral subiculum inactivation. Surprisingly, this analysis revealed that there was significant information about the chosen outcome remaining in the residual activity of control ensembles. Despite the removal of variance in firing that encoded direction, flavor, and size, the classification accuracy remained significantly above chance for control data, increasing with pseudoensemble size (Figure 7A). A two-way ANOVA with factors session type (control or eNpHR) and pseudoensemble size revealed that classification accuracy was significantly greater for control pseudoensembles (Psession type = 1.03 × 10−52; F1,4482 = 239.70; Cohen’s D = 0.45; Ppseudoensemble size = 4.75 × 10−22; F8,4482 = 15.10; Pinteraction = 3.46 × 10−27; F8,4482 = 18.28). Further, the residual information about chosen outcomes generated a different pattern of misclassification than was observed when all information was present. Specifically, errors in classification were frequently assigned to the unchosen action-flavor-size combination that accompanied the rat’s actual choice within the block of trials. This tendency resulted in the X-shaped pattern present in the control (but not eNpHR) confusion matrix, with trials correctly classified falling along the main diagonal (Figure 7B; from upper left to lower right), and trials erroneously classified as the unchosen option of the same trial block falling along the minor diagonal (Figure 7B; from lower left to upper right). This suggests that the residual information represented trial block, an abstract state defined by the reward structure of the task but not otherwise overtly signaled to rats, and that this information was absent from residuals from eNpHR pseudoensembles analyzed in this manner. Thus, neurons recorded during control sessions encoded information about the task above and beyond what they encoded about the particular features of chosen outcomes, and this additional information was lost with ventral subiculum inactivation. But is this information equivalent to a representation of trial block or state? To confirm this directly, we attempted to decode trial block from OFC neural activity. Critically, we again used OFC responses from which information about response direction, outcome size, and outcome flavor had been removed (Figure 8A). A two-way ANOVA with factors session type (control or eNpHR) and pseudoensemble size showed that classification accuracy was significantly greater for control than for eNpHR pseudoensembles (Psession type = 1.10 × 10−154; F1,4482 = 760.04; Cohen’s D = 0.77; Ppseudoensemble size = 6.74 × 10−93; F8,4482 = 59.61; Pinteraction = 1.22 × 10−37; F8,4482 = 24.75). Indeed, when we fit OFC responses with regression models that included trial block as a predictor along with action and outcome information (Figure 8B), the difference in ensemble performance between the two session types was eliminated (Psession type = 0.56; F1,4482 = 0.34; Cohen’s D = 0.01; Ppseudoensemble size = 0.43; F8,4482 = 1.01; two-way ANOVA with factors session type and pseudoensemble size). Together, these data show that OFC neurons recorded during control sessions contained information about trial block or state and that this information was strongly reduced with inactivation of ventral subiculum.

Here we functionally characterized the nuclear-enriched lncRNA SNHG1, which is highly expressed in multiple types of cancer. We also provide evidence that SNHG1 promotes cancer cell growth by regulating gene expression both in cis and in trans. SNHG1 was involved in the AKT signaling pathway as it promotes the neighboring transcription of the protein-coding gene SLC3A2 in cis by binding the Mediator complex to facilitate the establishment of enhancer–promoter interaction. In trans, SNHG1 directly interacted with central domain of FUBP1 and antagonize the binding of FBP-interacting repressor to FUBP1, thereby coordinating the expression of the oncogene MYC. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that lncRNA SNHG1 can function both in cis and in trans with distinct mechanisms to regulate transcription, promoting tumorigenesis and cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W2749420750,"The eukaryotic genome consists of DNA molecules far longer than the cells that contain them. They reach their greatest compaction during chromosome condensation in mitosis. This process is aided by condensin, a structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) family member. The spatial organization of mitotic chromosomes and how condensin shapes chromatin architecture are not yet fully understood. Here we use chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) to study mitotic chromosome condensation in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. This showed that the interphase landscape characterized by small chromatin domains is replaced by fewer but larger domains in mitosis. Condensin achieves this by setting up longer-range, intrachromosomal DNA interactions, which compact and individualize chromosomes. At the same time, local chromatin contacts are constrained by condensin, with profound implications for local chromatin function during mitosis. Our results highlight condensin as a major determinant that changes the chromatin landscape as cells prepare their genomes for cell division."
https://openalex.org/W2748985090,"The ability of presynaptic dopamine terminals to tune neurotransmitter release to meet the demands of neuronal activity is critical to neurotransmission. Although vesicle content has been assumed to be static, in vitro data increasingly suggest that cell activity modulates vesicle content. Here, we use a coordinated genetic, pharmacological, and imaging approach in Drosophila to study the presynaptic machinery responsible for these vesicular processes in vivo. We show that cell depolarization increases synaptic vesicle dopamine content prior to release via vesicular hyperacidification. This depolarization-induced hyperacidification is mediated by the vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT). Remarkably, both depolarization-induced dopamine vesicle hyperacidification and its dependence on VGLUT2 are seen in ventral midbrain dopamine neurons in the mouse. Together, these data suggest that in response to depolarization, dopamine vesicles utilize a cascade of vesicular transporters to dynamically increase the vesicular pH gradient, thereby increasing dopamine vesicle content."

Exosomes are produced by epithelial cells and are found in biologic fluids including blood and urine. The packaged material within exosomes includes proteins and lipids, but the molecular comparison within exosome subtypes is largely unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate differences between exosomes derived from the apical plasma membrane and basolateral plasma membrane of polarized murine cortical collecting duct principal cells. Nanoparticle tracking analysis showed that the size and concentration of apical and basolateral exosomes remained relatively stable across 3 different temperatures (23, 37, and 42°C). Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis revealed marked differences between the proteins packaged within the two types of exosomes from the same cells. Several proteins expressed at the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, including α-actinin-1, moesin, 14-3-3 protein ζ/δ, annexin A1/A3/A4/A5/A6, clathrin heavy chain 1, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, α-enolase, filamin-A, and heat shock protein 90, were identified in samples of apical plasma membrane-derived exosomes, but not in basolateral plasma membrane exosomes from mouse cortical collecting duct cells. In addition to differences at the protein level, mass spectrometry-based shotgun lipidomics analysis showed significant differences in the lipid classes and fatty acid composition of the two types of exosomes. We found higher levels of sphingomyelin and lower levels of cardiolipin, among other phospholipids in the apical plasma membrane compared to the basolateral plasma membrane exosomes. The molecular analyses of exosome subtypes presented herein will contribute to our understanding of exosome biogenesis, and the results may have potential implications for biomarker discovery.-Dang, V.

https://openalex.org/W2740609008,"Loss-of-function mutations of cyclic-AMP response element binding protein, binding protein (CREBBP) are prevalent in lymphoid malignancies. However, the tumour suppressor functions of CREBBP remain unclear. We demonstrate that loss of Crebbp in murine haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) leads to increased development of B-cell lymphomas. This is preceded by accumulation of hyperproliferative lymphoid progenitors with a defective DNA damage response (DDR) due to a failure to acetylate p53. We identify a premalignant lymphoma stem cell population with decreased H3K27ac, which undergoes transcriptional and genetic evolution due to the altered DDR, resulting in lymphomagenesis. Importantly, when Crebbp is lost later in lymphopoiesis, cellular abnormalities are lost and tumour generation is attenuated. We also document that CREBBP mutations may occur in HSPCs from patients with CREBBP-mutated lymphoma. These data suggest that earlier loss of Crebbp is advantageous for lymphoid transformation and inform the cellular origins and subsequent evolution of lymphoid malignancies. Horton et al. show that early Crebbp loss in haematopoietic progenitors results in a defective p53-mediated DNA damage response, leading to the accumulation of epigenetic and genetic alterations, which promote the onset of lymphoid malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2746303421,"Metabolic profiling of individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has previously been limited to single-time-point samples, ignoring time-of-day variation. Here, we tested our hypothesis that body mass and T2DM affect daily rhythmicity and concentrations of circulating metabolites across a 24-h day in 3 age-matched, male groups-lean, overweight/obese (OW/OB), and OW/OB with T2DM-in controlled laboratory conditions, which were not confounded by large meals. By using targeted liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry metabolomics, we quantified 130 plasma metabolites every 2 h over 24 h, and we show that average metabolite concentrations were significantly altered by increased body mass (90 of 130) and T2DM (56 of 130). Thirty-eight percent of metabolites exhibited daily rhythms in at least 1 study group, and where a metabolite was rhythmic in >1 group, its peak time was comparable. The optimal time of day was assessed to provide discriminating biomarkers. This differed between metabolite classes and study groups-for example, phospholipids showed maximal difference at 5:00 AM (lean vs. OW/OB) and at 5:00 PM (OW/OB vs. T2DM). Metabolites that were identified with both robust 24-h rhythms and significant concentration differences between study groups emphasize the importance of controlling the time of day for diagnosis and biomarker discovery, offering a significant improvement over current single sampling.-Isherwood, C.

https://openalex.org/W2750427492,"Interleukin 17A (IL-17A) and complement (C') activation have each been implicated in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). We have reported that IL-17A induces epithelial injury via TGF-β in murine bronchiolitis obliterans; that TGF-β and the C' cascade present signaling interactions in mediating epithelial injury; and that the blockade of C' receptors mitigates lung fibrosis. In the present study, we investigated the role of IL-17A in regulating C' in lung fibrosis. Microarray analyses of mRNA isolated from primary normal human small airway epithelial cells indicated that IL-17A (100 ng/ml; 24 h; n = 5 donor lungs) induces C' components (C' factor B, C3, and GPCR kinase isoform 5), cytokines (IL8, -6, and -1B), and cytokine ligands (CXCL1, -2, -3, -5, -6, and -16). IL-17A induces protein and mRNA regulation of C' components and the synthesis of active C' 3a (C3a) in normal primary human alveolar type II epithelial cells (AECs). Wild-type mice subjected to IL-17A neutralization and IL-17A knockout (il17a-/- ) mice were protected against bleomycin (BLEO)-induced fibrosis and collagen deposition. Further, BLEO-injured il17a-/- mice had diminished levels of circulating Krebs Von Den Lungen 6 (alveolar epithelial injury marker), local caspase-3/7, and local endoplasmic reticular stress-related genes. BLEO-induced local C' activation [C3a, C5a, and terminal C' complex (C5b-9)] was attenuated in il17a-/- mice, and IL-17A neutralization prevented the loss of epithelial C' inhibitors (C' receptor-1 related isoform Y and decay accelerating factor), and an increase in local TUNEL levels. RNAi-mediated gene silencing of il17a in fibrotic mice arrested the progression of lung fibrosis, attenuated cellular apoptosis (caspase-3/7) and lung deposition of collagen and C' (C5b-9). Compared to normals, plasma from IPF patients showed significantly higher hemolytic activity. Our findings demonstrate that limiting complement activation by neutralizing IL-17A is a potential mechanism in ameliorating lung fibrosis.-Cipolla, E., Fisher, A. J., Gu, H., Mickler, E.

https://openalex.org/W2746520501,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress occurs frequently in cancers. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated to cope with ER stress. This has generated widespread interest in targeting UPR as therapeutic strategies. Inositol-requiring transmembrane kinase/endonuclease 1α (IRE1α), an ER stress sensor, is a key component of UPR. However, the role of IRE1α in tumorigenesis remains unclear. The purpose of this work is to investigate the role of IRE1α in colon cancer and to determine whether IRE1α could serve as a target for therapy. We found that knockdown of IRE1α suppressed the proliferation of colon cancer cells in vitro and xenograft growth in vivo. Inhibition of expression of IRE1α decreased stemness of colon cancer stem cells (CSCs) and attenuated growth of intestinal organoids. Genetic ablation of IRE1α prevented the colitis-associated colonic tumorigenesis in mice. The mechanistic study indicates that knockdown of IRE1α repressed the expression of β-catenin, a key factor that drives colonic tumorigenesis, through activating pancreatic ER kinase/eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α signaling. We found that the IRE1a-specific inhibitor 4μ8C could suppress the production of β-catenin, inhibited the proliferation of colon cancer cells, repressed colon CSCs and prevented xenograft growth. The results suggest that IRE1α has a critical role in colonic tumorigenesis and IRE1α targeting might be a strategy for treatment of colon cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2748846347,"Physical inactivity and disuse are major contributors to age-related muscle loss. Denervation of skeletal muscle has been previously used as a model with which to investigate muscle atrophy following disuse. Although gene regulatory networks that control skeletal muscle atrophy after denervation have been established, the transcriptome in response to the recovery of muscle after disuse and the associated epigenetic mechanisms that may function to modulate gene expression during skeletal muscle atrophy or recovery have yet to be investigated. We report that silencing the tibialis anterior muscle in rats with tetrodotoxin (TTX)-administered to the common peroneal nerve-resulted in reductions in muscle mass of 7, 29, and 51% with corresponding reductions in muscle fiber cross-sectional area of 18, 42, and 69% after 3, 7, and 14 d of TTX, respectively. Of importance, 7 d of recovery, during which rodents resumed habitual physical activity, restored muscle mass from a reduction of 51% after 14 d TTX to a reduction of only 24% compared with sham control. Returning muscle mass to levels observed at 7 d TTX administration (29% reduction). Transcriptome-wide analysis demonstrated that 3714 genes were differentially expressed across all conditions at a significance of P ≤ 0.001 after disuse-induced atrophy. Of interest, after 7 d of recovery, the expression of genes that were most changed during TTX had returned to that of the sham control. The 20 most differentially expressed genes after microarray analysis were identified across all conditions and were cross-referenced with the most frequently occurring differentially expressed genes between conditions. This gene subset included myogenin (MyoG), Hdac4, Ampd3, Trim63 (MuRF1), and acetylcholine receptor subunit α1 (Chrna1). Transcript expression of these genes and Fboxo32 (MAFbx), because of its previously identified role in disuse atrophy together with Trim63 (MuRF1), were confirmed by real-time quantitative RT-PCR, and DNA methylation of their promoter regions was analyzed by PCR and pyrosequencing. MyoG, Trim63 (MuRF1), Fbxo32 (MAFbx), and Chrna1 demonstrated significantly decreased DNA methylation at key time points after disuse-induced atrophy that corresponded with significantly increased gene expression. Of importance, after TTX cessation and 7 d of recovery, there was a marked increase in the DNA methylation profiles of Trim63 (MuRF1) and Chrna1 back to control levels. This also corresponded with the return of gene expression in the recovery group back to baseline expression observed in sham-surgery controls. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that skeletal muscle atrophy in response to disuse is accompanied by dynamic epigenetic modifications that are associated with alterations in gene expression, and that these epigenetic modifications and gene expression profiles are reversible after skeletal muscle returns to normal activity.-Fisher, A.

https://openalex.org/W2748464056,"Cardiac hypertrophy and associated heart fibrosis remain a major cause of death worldwide. Phytochemicals have gained attention as alternative therapeutics for managing cardiovascular diseases. These include the extract from the plant Terminalia arjuna, which is a popular cardioprotectant and may prevent or slow progression of pathological hypertrophy to heart failure. Here, we investigated the mode of action of a principal bioactive T. arjuna compound, arjunolic acid (AA), in ameliorating hemodynamic load-induced cardiac fibrosis and identified its intracellular target. Our data revealed that AA significantly represses collagen expression and improves cardiac function during hypertrophy. We found that AA binds to and stabilizes the ligand-binding domain of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) and increases its expression during cardiac hypertrophy. PPARα knockdown during AA treatment in hypertrophy samples, including angiotensin II-treated adult cardiac fibroblasts and renal artery-ligated rat heart, suggests that AA-driven cardioprotection primarily arises from PPARα agonism. Moreover, AA-induced PPARα up-regulation leads to repression of TGF-β signaling, specifically by inhibiting TGF-β-activated kinase1 (TAK1) phosphorylation. We observed that PPARα directly interacts with TAK1, predominantly via PPARα N-terminal transactivation domain (AF-1) thereby masking the TAK1 kinase domain. The AA-induced PPARα-bound TAK1 level thereby shows inverse correlation with the phosphorylation level of TAK1 and subsequent reduction in p38 MAPK and NF-κBp65 activation, ultimately culminating in amelioration of excess collagen synthesis in cardiac hypertrophy. In conclusion, our findings unravel the mechanism of AA action in regressing hypertrophy-associated cardiac fibrosis by assigning a role of AA as a PPARα agonist that inactivates non-canonical TGF-β signaling.

Increased hemodynamic load in heart leads to activation of the renin–angiotensin system resulting in heightened local concentration of angiotensinII (AngII), which has been established as a principal causal factor for cardiac hypertrophy and associated fibrosis (3Rosenkranz S.

Therefore, ameliorating AngII-induced cardiac fibrosis might be one of the possible measures for prevention of such disease progression with improved efficacy of cardiac performance. Phytomedicines have been greatly appreciated in recent times as promising candidates toward alternative therapeutic regime in several fibrotic diseases (6Chen J.C. Tsai C.C. Chen L.D. Chen H.H.

Terminalia arjuna (arjuna), considered as one of the most accepted beneficial plants from ancient times, has also widely been known to have cardiotonic functions (8Dwivedi S. Chopra D. Revisiting Terminalia arjuna–an ancient cardiovascular drug.J. Tradit. Complement. Med. 2014; 4: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Preclinical studies with arjuna extracts as well as clinical trials in the form of combination therapy with standard drugs have shown to be protective in several models of cardiac ailments (9Maulik S.K. Talwar K.K. Therapeutic potential of Terminalia arjuna in cardiovascular disorders.Am. J. Cardiovasc. Drugs. 2012; 12: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 10Amalraj A. Gopi S. Medicinal properties of Terminalia arjuna (Roxb.) Wight & Arn.: a review.J. Tradit. Complement. Med. 2017; 7: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Arjunolic acid (AA), a chiral triterpenoid, is one of the principal bioactive components of arjuna extracts. Aqueous extract of arjuna bark containing AA significantly inhibited isoprenaline-induced increase in oxidative stress and also prevented fibrosis without regression of hypertrophy or improvement of cardiac function (11Kumar S. Enjamoori R. Jaiswal A. Ray R. Seth S. Maulik S.K. Catecholamine-induced myocardial fibrosis and oxidative stress is attenuated by Terminalia arjuna (Roxb.).J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 2009; 61: 1529-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Purified AA resulted in anti-oxidant, anti-platelet, anti-coagulant, anti-necrotic, anti-apoptotic, free radical-scavenging, anti-inflammatory, hypolipidemic, or hypotensive effects in various cardiac disease models (9Maulik S.K.

Arjunolic acid: a new multifunctional therapeutic promise of alternative medicine.Biochimie. 2013; 95: 1098-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, the precise molecular mechanism of cardioprotection by AA has still remained elusive. Furthermore, pleiotropic effects of AA make it even harder to annotate specific molecular targets within the cellular milieu. Thus, the objective of our study was to look into the effect of AA, which is purified and crystallized from ethyl acetate and methanol extracts of the corewood of arjuna plant (14Ramesh A.S. Christopher J.G. Radhika R. Setty C.R. Thankamani V. Isolation, characterisation and cytotoxicity study of arjunolic acid from Terminalia arjuna.Nat. Prod. Res. 2012; 26: 1549-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) on cardiac hypertrophy-associated fibrosis, and to seek out its plausible mechanism of action on fibrotic signaling through identification of its specific molecular target. Our study for the first time establishes PPARα as a molecular target of AA. It is a ligand-dependent transcription factor, and the most abundant PPAR isoform in heart (15Kelly D.P. PPARs of the heart.Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 482-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). PPARα primarily acts as a modulator of energy metabolism but also acts as an anti-inflammatory agent (16Smeets P.J. Planavila A. Van Der Vusse G.J. Van Bilsen M.

Growing evidence has shown that PPARα activators are involved in integrating inflammatory and hypertrophic pathways thereby governing the pathological outcome of hypertrophy-associated fibrosis (18Diep Q.N.

Moreover, PPARα double knock-out mice subjected to transverse aortic constriction (TAC) showed heightened fibrotic and inflammatory gene expressions along with severely aggravated hemodynamic function compared with wild-type mice that has undergone TAC (21Smeets P.J.

Cardiac hypertrophy is enhanced in PPARα−/− mice in response to chronic pressure overload.Cardiovasc. Res. 2008; 78: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). During pressure overload hypertrophy, autocrine and paracrine actions of locally expressed AngII induce TGF-β signaling in cardiac fibroblasts (2Creemers E.E. Pinto Y.M. Molecular mechanisms that control interstitial fibrosis in the pressure-overloaded heart.Cardiovasc. Res. 2011; 89: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 3Rosenkranz S. TGF-β1 and angiotensin networking in cardiac remodeling.Cardiovasc. Res. 2004; 63: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding, TGF-β receptor II (TβRII) transphosphorylates TGF-β receptor I (TβRI). In the canonical branch, active TβRI phosphorylates the “suppressor of mothers against decapentaplegic” (SMAD 2/3), which combines with co-SMADs (SMAD 4) for nuclear translocation. Active nuclear SMADs up-regulate transcription of several genes involved in ECM synthesis (3Rosenkranz S. TGF-β1 and angiotensin networking in cardiac remodeling.Cardiovasc. Res. 2004; 63: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 22Hata A. Chen Y.G. TGF-β signaling from receptors to Smads.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2016; 8: a022061Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). SMAD3−/− mice have shown reduced cardiac fibrosis after TAC (23Divakaran V. Adrogue J. Ishiyama M. Entman M.L. Haudek S.

Heart Fail. 2009; (CIRCHEARTFAILURE-108)Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Independent of the SMAD kinase activity, the non-canonical pathway is principally governed by MAPKs, and TAK1 is a principal MAP3K. Phosphorylation-dependent activation of TAK1 requires interaction of its kinase domain with the C terminus of TAK1-binding protein (TAB1) (24Kishimoto K. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J.

Non-Smad pathways in TGF-β signaling.Cell Res. 2009; 19: 128-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar). Once activated, TAK1 phosphorylates the inhibitor of κB kinase β (IKKβ) (but not IKKα), MKK4/7, and MKK3/6, which in turn phosphorylate NF-κB, JNK, and p38 MAPK, respectively (25Zhang Y.E.

TAK1, but not TAB1 or TAB2, plays an essential role in multiple signaling pathways in vivo.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2668-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Ultimately, NF-κB and other transcription factors downstream of JNK and p38 MAPK are activated resulting in transcription of the target genes (27Mao R. Fan Y. Mou Y. Zhang H. Fu S. Yang J. TAK1 lysine 158 is required for TGF-β-induced TRAF6-mediated Smad-independent IKK/NF-κB and JNK/AP-1 activation.Cell. Signal. 2011; 23: 222-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The importance of the non-canonical branch via TAK1 has also been well-documented in cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis (28Zhang D. Gaussin V. Taffet G.E. Belaguli N.S. Yamada M. Schwartz R.J. Michael L.H. Overbeek P.A. Schneider M.D. TAK1 is activated in the myocardium after pressure overload and is sufficient to provoke heart failure in transgenic mice.Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 556-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Dominant-negative TAK1 has been found to inhibit TGF-β-induced hypertrophic events in mouse cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts, including ECM production (29Ono K. Ohtomo T. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Tsuchiya M.

Our work thus aims to study the role of PPARα in AA-driven modulation of the TGF-β axes during cardiac hypertrophy and associated fibrosis. This work identifies the PPARα-TAK1 interaction as a causal factor preventing TAK1 phosphorylation, and it further analyzes the relative strength of different PPARα domains contributing toward inhibition of non-canonical TGF-β axes and regression of subsequent collagen synthesis during cardiac hypertrophy. AngII treatment in cardiac fibroblasts in vitro (Fig. 1A) and renal artery ligation in vivo (Fig. 1B) confirmed a significant increase in collagen-1 (col-1; 2.29 ± 0.032-fold in vitro and 1.71 ± 0.017-fold in vivo) and collagen-3 (col-3; 1.96 ± 0.035-fold in vitro and 1.76 ± 0.015-fold in vivo) gene expressions compared with respective DMSO-treated control samples as revealed by RT-PCR analyses (Fig. 1, A and B). Hydroxyproline assay also showed significant up-regulation in total secreted collagen content in the fibroblast culture supernatant in vitro (471.99 ± 20.188 ng/ml vis à vis 220.57 ± 10.289 ng/ml culture supernatant; Fig. 1C) as well as significantly increased total left ventricular collagen content in vivo (446.63 ± 12.808 μg/g vis à vis 214.91 ± 18.828 μg/g of wet tissue; Fig. 1D) in hypertrophy samples compared with respective control samples in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 1, C and D). AA treatment in AngII-pretreated cardiac fibroblasts (Fig. 1A) and renal artery-ligated rat heart (Fig. 1B) showed significant down-regulation of col-1 (2.51 ± 0.025-fold in vitro and 2.20 ± 0.022-fold in vivo) and col-3 (1.77 ± 0.050-fold in vitro and 1.86 ± 0.016-fold in vivo) gene expressions compared with respective DMSO-treated hypertrophy samples in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 1, A and B). Hydroxyproline assay further revealed that AA treatment during hypertrophy leads to significant reduction in total secreted collagen content in fibroblast culture supernatant (301.49 ± 22.191 ng/ml vis à vis 471.99 ± 20.188 ng/ml of culture supernatant; Fig. 1C) as well as total left ventricular collagen content (315.57 ± 28.761 μg/g vis à vis 446.63 ± 12.808 μg/g of wet tissue; Fig. 1D) compared with respective hypertrophy samples in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 1, C and D). In vitro adult cardiac fibroblasts were also treated with equivalent amounts of AA. There was no significant difference in col-1 and col-3 gene expressions (Fig. 1A) or total secreted collagen content in the culture supernatant (Fig. 1C) of AA-treated control fibroblasts compared with fibroblasts treated with equivalent amounts of DMSO. Hypertrophy was confirmed in vivo by significantly increased heart weight (in milligrams) to body weight (in grams) ratio (HW/BW; 1.71 ± 0.091-fold; Fig. 1E), increased cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area (CSA) (627.42 ± 21.197 μm2 vis à vis 379.48 ± 10.606 μm2; Fig. 1F), and increased expression of atrial natriuretic factor (anf) (3.27 ± 0.019-fold), β-myosin heavy chain (β-mhc) (2.54 ± 0.092-fold), and skeletal α-actin (acta1) (1.89 ± 0.024-fold) genes (Fig. 1G) in ligated rats compared with sham-operated control rat heart. AA-mediated regression of hypertrophy was confirmed by the significantly reduced HW/BW ratio (1.28 ± 0.067-fold; Fig. 1E), significantly decreased CSA (505.81 ± 20.326 μm2 vis à vis 627.42 ± 21.197 μm2; Fig. 1F), and significant down-regulation in anf (1.69 ± 0.009-fold), β-mhc (2.38 ± 0.086-fold), and acta1 (1.57 ± 0.017-fold) gene expressions (Fig. 1G) in AA-treated hypertrophy samples compared with renal artery-ligated rat heart (Fig. 1, E–G). Hypertrophic induction significantly reduced cardiac functional efficacy in ligated rats (fractional shortening (%FS): 38.53 ± 1.781%, and left ventricular internal diastolic diameter (LvIDd): 5.65 ± 0.273 mm) compared with sham-operated control rats (%FS: 57.51 ± 1.026%, and LvIDd: 3.56 ± 0.062 mm) as observed by M-mode echocardiography in transthoracic parasternal short axis view at papillary muscle level. Furthermore, significant restoration of such compromised cardiac function was evident in AA-treated ligated rats showing increased %FS (46.67 ± 1.504%) and decreased LvIDd (4.01 ± 0.096 mm) compared with the aforementioned hypertrophy samples in vivo (Fig. 1H). The viability measured was more than 90% after AA treatment in all hypertrophied fibroblasts as checked by cell viability assay (data not shown). The effective doses of AA for both in vitro and in vivo experiments were determined by maximal regression of collagen during hypertrophy via dose-dependent study (data not shown). Steady-state fluorescence titrations of PPARα with increasing concentrations of AA showed no apparent shifts around 330 nm (λmax), indicative of unaltered tertiary architecture. However, the corresponding hypochromic shifts observed indicated binding of AA to PPARα (Fig. 2A, panel i). The binding was also apparent when monitored through CD analyses where similar titrations induced marginal secondary structure perturbations (near 55 μm) in this predominantly α-helical protein. (Fig. 2A, panel ii). FTIR spectrum of AA supported previous reports (14Ramesh A.S. Christopher J.G. Radhika R. Setty C.R. Thankamani V. Isolation, characterisation and cytotoxicity study of arjunolic acid from Terminalia arjuna.Nat. Prod. Res. 2012; 26: 1549-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) showing characteristic –OH, C–H, and C=O stretches at 3467, 2927, and 1708 cm−1 positions, respectively. Characteristic C–O stretching vibrations were also obtained at 475, 598, 1042, and 1456 cm−1. In vitro translated and purified PPARα revealed intense absorption characteristic of amide-I and amide A bands of the secondary structure of a protein (33Surewicz W.K. Mantsch H.H. Chapman D. Determination of protein secondary structure by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy: a critical assessment.Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar, 34Krimm S. Bandekar J. Vibrational spectroscopy and conformation of peptides, polypeptides, and proteins.Adv. Protein Chem. 1986; 38: 181-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (2699) Google Scholar). The peak at 1642 cm−1 position represented the amide-I bond. The amide-A band (at 3300–3600 cm−1), representing the N–H stretching vibrations, was also obtained. Successful interaction between PPARα and AA by in vitro interaction assay was shown by the absence of peaks at 3467, 2927, and 1708 cm−1 in the complex compared with free AA. Peaks characteristic of free AA at 952, 1018, 1317, 1412, and 1456 cm−1 and those characteristic of free in vitro translated PPARα at 1642 cm−1 and in the range of 3300–3600 cm−1 were maintained in the complex when compared with free AA or free in vitro translated protein, respectively (Fig. 2B). The stabilization of the tertiary and secondary architecture of PPARα by AA was assessed by monitoring changes in melting temperature (Tm) (Fig. 2C, panels i and ii). In fluorescence thermal shift (FTS) assays, PPARα, bound to AA, showed higher Tm (59.5 ± 0.5 °C) compared with PPARα alone (56.4 ± 0.2 °C) (Fig. 2C, panel i). A similar trend was observed through CD studies where changes in both θ218 (α-helical content, Fig. 2C, panel ii) and θ222 (β content, inset Fig. 2C, panel ii) with respect to temperature clearly showed a higher Tm (56.4 ± 0.1 °C) upon AA binding compared with control (53 ± 0.2 °C). Rattus norvegicus PPARα protein model was built, and the integrity of the model was confirmed through all atomistic molecular dynamics simulation. To gain atomistic details, binding mode of AA with rat-PPARα (UniProtKB-P37230) was compared with the other known agonists, namely iloprost, TIPP-703, and fenofibrate. PPARα-AA complex obtained through docking via “binding site prediction and shape-based ligand matching” (BSP-SLIM) tool showed binding score close to previously studied synthetic agonists such as iloprost, TIPP-703, and fenofibrate. Additionally, the calculated binding free energy (−6.3 kcal/mol) matched with its experimentally determined energy obtained from fluorescence and CD titrations (−6.2 kcal/mol). Interestingly, AA was found to bind to the identical pocket (formed of Met-220, Cys-276, Ser-280, Thr-283, Phe-318, Leu-331, Ile-332, Leu-324, Tyr-334, and His-440) for which binding of all other PPARα agonists have been reported, including the predocked complex with fenofibrate. With root mean square deviation (RMSD) of ∼0.62 Å among all aligned structures, it showed structural superposition of AA with other agonists, confined to the same ligand-binding site. This was further confirmed through tertiary structure alignment of modeled PPARα (bound to AA and fenofibrate) with known crystal structures of PPARα in complex with agonists such as iloprost and TIPP-703 (Fig. 2D and supplemental Table 1). For all atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, the molecular dynamics simulation trajectories of both free and AA-bound PPARα were analyzed for changes in backbone RMSD, gyration radius (Rg), root mean square fluctuations in Cα atoms (RMSF), as well as protein–ligand H-bond network occupancy. In simulations of PPARα alone, projection of variations in backbone RMSD versus Rg showed dual distribution of species along both components (Fig. 2E, panel i). The projections were, however, dominated by the species with high RMSD and Rg compared with initial model. However, I the presence of AA, only moderate variations were observed along both components (Fig. 2E, panel ii). This system showed single distribution with dominant population close to initial starting conformation (low RMSD and marginal variations in Rg). These variations were identically reflected in RMSF analysis of both systems (Fig. 2E, panel iii). Marginal changes in Cα fluctuations were observed in residues of the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of PPARα. However, the LBD showed much reduced Cα fluctuations in AA-bound PPARα complexes compared with PPARα alone, indicating stabilization of LBD by AA. H-bond network analysis showed persistence of at least three H-bonds per time frame between AA and Thr-283, Leu-331, and Tyr-334 of PPARα (Fig. 2E, panel iv). Effect of AA upon PPARα-mediated autoregulation of PPARα transcription was analyzed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using anti-PPARα antibody coupled to qRT-PCR analyses of PPAR-response element (PPRE) within the PPARα promoter, both in vitro and in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2746298814,"A combination of bulk and single-molecule FRET, as well as cleavage activity assays, reveals that the twister ribozyme requires more Mg2+ for folding than it does for self-cleavage, and is also more efficiently activated by several transition metals. Twister is a small ribozyme present in almost all kingdoms of life that rapidly self-cleaves in variety of divalent metal ions. We used activity assays, bulk FRET and single-molecule FRET (smFRET) to understand how different metal ions promote folding and self-cleavage of the Oryza sativa twister ribozyme. Although most ribozymes require additional Mg2+ for catalysis, twister inverts this expectation, requiring 20–30 times less Mg2+ to self-cleave than to fold. Transition metals such as Co2+, Ni2+ and Zn2+ activate twister more efficiently than Mg2+ ions. Although twister is fully active in ≤ 0.5 mM MgCl2, smFRET experiments showed that the ribozyme visits the folded state infrequently under these conditions. Comparison of folding and self-cleavage rates indicates that most folding events lead to catalysis, which correlates with metal bond strength. Thus, the robust activity of twister reports on transient metal ion binding under physiological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2746605095,"Within the tumor, malignant and stromal cells support each other by secreting a wide variety of growth factors and cytokines, allowing tumor growth and disease progression. The identification and regulation of those key factors in this crosstalk has opened the opportunity to develop new therapeutic strategies that not only act on the tumor cells but also on the stroma. Among these factors, S100A7 protein has gained interest in the last years. With key roles in cell motility its expression correlates with increased tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastatic potential. This work aims to deepen in the role played by extracellular S100A7 in the tumor microenvironment, offering a new integrative insight of its mechanism of action on each cellular compartment (tumor, endothelial, immune and fibroblast). As a result, we demonstrate its implication in cell migration and invasion, and its important contribution to the formation of a proinflammatory and proangiogenic environment that favors tumor progression and metastasis. Furthermore, we define its possible role in the pre-metastatic niche formation. Considering the relevance of S100A7 in cancer progression, we have developed neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, reporting for the first time the proof of principle of this promising therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2749583601,"Human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) aggregation is associated with β-cell dysfunction and death in type 2 diabetes (T2D). we aimed to determine whether in vivo treatment with chemical chaperone 4-phenylbutyrate (PBA) ameliorates hIAPP-induced β-cell dysfunction and islet amyloid formation. Oral administration of PBA in hIAPP transgenic (hIAPP Tg) mice expressing hIAPP in pancreatic β cells counteracted impaired glucose homeostasis and restored glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Moreover, PBA treatment almost completely prevented the transcriptomic alterations observed in hIAPP Tg islets, including the induction of genes related to inflammation. PBA also increased β-cell viability and improved insulin secretion in hIAPP Tg islets cultured under glucolipotoxic conditions. Strikingly, PBA not only prevented but even reversed islet amyloid deposition, pointing to a direct effect of PBA on hIAPP. This was supported by in silico calculations uncovering potential binding sites of PBA to monomeric, dimeric, and pentameric fibrillar structures, and by in vitro assays showing inhibition of hIAPP fibril formation by PBA. Collectively, these results uncover a novel beneficial effect of PBA on glucose homeostasis by restoring β-cell function and preventing amyloid formation in mice expressing hIAPP in β cells, highlighting the therapeutic potential of PBA for the treatment of T2D.-Montane, J., de Pablo, S., Castaño, C., Rodríguez-Comas, J., Cadavez, L., Obach, M., Visa, M., Alcarraz-Vizán, G., Sanchez-Martinez, M., Nonell-Canals, A., Parrizas, M., Servitja, J.-M., Novials, A.

https://openalex.org/W2745403509,"Classical homocystinuria (HCU) is an inborn error of sulfur amino acid metabolism caused by deficient activity of cystathionine β-synthase (CBS), resulting in an accumulation of homocysteine and a concomitant decrease of cystathionine and cysteine in blood and tissues. In mice, the complete lack of CBS is neonatally lethal. In this study, newborn CBS-knockout (KO) mice were treated with recombinant polyethyleneglycolylated human truncated CBS (PEG-CBS). Full survival of the treated KO mice, along with a positive impact on metabolite levels in plasma, liver, brain, and kidneys, was observed. The PEG-CBS treatment prevented an otherwise fatal liver disease characterized by steatosis, death of hepatocytes, and ultrastructural abnormalities of endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. Furthermore, treatment of the KO mice for 5 mo maintained the plasma metabolite balance and completely prevented osteoporosis and changes in body composition that characterize both the KO model and human patients. These findings argue that early treatment of patients with HCU with PEG-CBS may prevent clinical symptoms of the disease possibly without the need of dietary protein restriction.-Majtan, T., Hůlková, H., Park, I., Krijt, J., Kožich, V., Bublil, E.

https://openalex.org/W2750245026,"Yeast Prx1 is a mitochondrial 1-Cys peroxiredoxin that catalyzes the reduction of endogenously generated H2O2. Prx1 is synthesized on cytosolic ribosomes as a preprotein with a cleavable N-terminal presequence that is the mitochondrial targeting signal, but the mechanisms underlying Prx1 distribution to distinct mitochondrial subcompartments are unknown. Here, we provide direct evidence of the following dual mitochondrial localization of Prx1: a soluble form in the intermembrane space and a form in the matrix weakly associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane. We show that Prx1 sorting into the intermembrane space likely involves the release of the protein precursor within the lipid bilayer of the inner membrane, followed by cleavage by the inner membrane peptidase. We also found that during its import into the matrix compartment, Prx1 is sequentially cleaved by mitochondrial processing peptidase and then by octapeptidyl aminopeptidase 1 (Oct1). Oct1 cleaved eight amino acid residues from the N-terminal region of Prx1 inside the matrix, without interfering with its peroxidase activity in vitro. Remarkably, the processing of peroxiredoxin (Prx) proteins by Oct1 appears to be an evolutionarily conserved process because yeast Oct1 could cleave the human mitochondrial peroxiredoxin Prx3 when expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Altogether, the processing of peroxiredoxins by Imp2 or Oct1 likely represents systems that control the localization of Prxs into distinct compartments and thereby contribute to various mitochondrial redox processes."
https://openalex.org/W2746456470,"Mechanical loading is necessary for the development and maintenance of the musculoskeletal system. Removal of loading via microgravity, paralysis, or bed rest leads to rapid loss of muscle mass and function; however, the molecular mechanisms that lead to these changes are largely unknown, particularly for the spaceflight (SF) microgravity environment. Furthermore, few studies have explored these effects on the shoulder, a dynamically stabilized joint with a large range of motion; therefore, we examined the effects of microgravity on mouse shoulder muscles for the 15-d Space Transportation System (STS)-131, 13-d STS-135, and 30-d Bion-M1 missions. Mice from STS missions were euthanized within 4 h after landing, whereas mice from the Bion-M1 mission were euthanized within 14 h after landing. The motion-generating deltoid muscle was more sensitive to microgravity than the joint-stabilizing rotator cuff muscles. Mice from the STS-131 mission exhibited reduced myogenic (Myf5 and -6) and adipogenic (Pparg, Cebpa, and Lep) gene expression, whereas either no change or an increased expression of these genes was observed in mice from the Bion-M1 mission. In summary, muscle responses to microgravity were muscle-type specific, short-duration SF caused dramatic molecular changes to shoulder muscles and responses to reloading upon landing were rapid.-Shen, H., Lim, C., Schwartz, A.

Open table in a new tab Mitochondria of W303/COX16-CH were isolated from cells grown in galactose with and without an additional 2 h of growth in medium containing chloramphenicol. The chloramphenicol treatment has been shown in other studies to enhance translation of some mitochondrial gene products (20Rak M. Gokova S. Tzagoloff A. Modular assembly of yeast mitochondrial ATP synthase.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 920-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), presumably as a result of the increased pools of nuclear gene products needed for assembly of respiratory and ATP synthase complexes. Mitochondria were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine plus cysteine, extracted with digitonin and the CH-tagged Cox16p in the digitonin extract purified on protein C antibody beads. Analysis of the digitonin extracts by SDS-PAGE indicated a small increase in incorporation of the radioactive precursors into Cox1p of mitochondria isolated from chloramphenicol-treated cells. Consistent with prior results, the chloramphenicol incubation substantially increased translation of cytochrome b and Atp9p (Fig. 2A). The increase in translation of cytochrome b and Cox1p in mitochondria of chloramphenicol-treated cells was also evident in the SDS gel of the fractions containing affinity-purified Cox16p-CH (Fig. 2A). BN-PAGE analysis of affinity-purified Cox16p-CH revealed a dramatic increase in co-immunoadsorption of newly assembled supercomplexes as a result of the chloramphenicol incubation. The chloramphenicol treatment led to an increase in radiolabeled material that migrated between the 480- and 242-kDa markers (Fig. 2B). This region was previously shown to contain the D3 and D4 assembly intermediates of Cox1p (13McStay G.P. Su C.H. Tzagoloff A. Modular assembly of yeast cytochrome oxidase.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2013; 24: 440-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 21McStay G.P. Su C.H. Thomas S.M. Xu J.T. Tzagoloff A. Characterization of assembly intermediates containing subunit 1 of yeast cytochrome oxidase.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 26546-26556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional electrophoresis of the Cox16-CH enriched fraction confirmed a large increase of labeled Cox1p in the region corresponding to the D3 and D4 assembly intermediates of COX (Fig. 2C). Thus, most of the radioactivity between the 242- and 480-kDa markers migrated as Cox1p following depolymerization and separation in the second dimension by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that Cox16p is a component of the Cox1p module (13McStay G.P. Su C.H. Tzagoloff A. Modular assembly of yeast cytochrome oxidase.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2013; 24: 440-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 21McStay G.P. Su C.H. Thomas S.M. Xu J.T. Tzagoloff A. Characterization of assembly intermediates containing subunit 1 of yeast cytochrome oxidase.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 26546-26556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The two-dimensional gels also revealed a large chloramphenicol-induced increase of radiolabeled cytochrome b in the supercomplexes (Fig. 2C). The observation that the supercomplexes are pulled down with Cox16p-CH suggested that it may be associated with COX. This was borne out by Western analysis of the fraction affinity-purified on the protein C antibody beads. The fraction eluted from the beads was separated by BN-PAGE and visualized with protein C antibody. The blot indicated the presence of Cox16p in COX and the supercomplexes (Figs. 2B and 3, A and B). The concentrations of the radiolabeled D3 and D4 intermediates are detected as radiolabeled proteins, but their concentrations are too low to be detected immunochemically, even after a long exposure to X-ray film. Cox16-CH also pulls down COX when it is not part of the supercomplexes. This was shown by introducing a null cbp3 allele into the strain containing Cox16p with the CH tag. (W303ΔCBP3/COX16-CH). The cbp3 mutant lacks the bc1 complex because Cbp3p is required for expression of cytochrome b (22Wu M. Tzagoloff A. Identification and characterization of a new gene (CBP3) required for the expression of yeast coenzyme QH2-cytochrome c reductase.J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11122-11130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Gruschke S. Kehrein K. Römpler K. Gröne K. Israel L. Imhof A. Herrmann J.M. Ott M. Cbp3-Cbp6 interacts with the yeast mitochondrial ribosomal tunnel exit and promotes cytochrome b synthesis and assembly.J. Cell Biol. 2011; 193: 1101-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The absence of the bc1 complex resulted in a higher accumulation of radiolabeled COX and Cox1 intermediates (Fig. 3C). As expected, in the absence of the bc1 complex, all the COX migrated as a dimer. The antibody signal of COX in the bc1 mutant was comparable with that of COX in the supercomplexes of the strain expressing the bc1 complex (Fig. 3C). The presence of Cox16p in COX was also was confirmed by purifying the enzyme from strains that express Cox16p with a CH tag. As a control, COX was also purified from a strain expressing Cox1p with a double HA and protein C tag (Cox1p-HAC). COX was extracted from mitochondria with lauryl maltoside or with digitonin and purified on protein C antibody beads. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE under conditions that resolve low-molecular-weight proteins (24Schägger H. von Jagow G. Tricine-SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for the separation of proteins in the range from 1–100 kDa.Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10470) Google Scholar). In contrast to digitonin, lauryl maltoside dissociates the supercomplexes. The silver-stained gel indicated that the major proteins purified from the lauryl maltoside extract corresponded to known subunits of COX, although there were some contaminating proteins in the high molecular weight region of the gel (Fig. 4A). The purified fraction obtained from the digitonin extract contained additional proteins, which are probably subunits of the bc1 complex because this detergent does not dissociated the yeast supercomplexes. No attempt was made to identify the extra bands in the digitonin extract that co-purify with either Cox1p-HAC or Cox16p-CH. The only significant difference between the enzyme pulled down with the tagged Cox1p and Cox16p was the presence in the former of a protein of ∼18 kDa (Fig. 4A). This protein was absent in COX purified recovered in the Cox16p-CH pulldown (Fig. 4A). This protein was identified as Hsp10p by mass spectrometry. The failure of tagged Cox16p to pull down Hsp10p suggests that that different assembly intermediates may exist, some of which contain Cox1p and Hsp10p but not Cox16p. Alignment of a silver and antibody-stained gel revealed that the antibody detected Cox16p-CH at the position of Cox5p (Fig. 4B). In the absence of an antibody to Cox16p, it was not possible to determine the position of the untagged protein. However, assuming that the tag on Cox16p elicits a shift in its migration similar to that observed for Cox4p, Cox5p, and Cox6p, untagged Cox16p would be expected to migrate in the region of Cox 6p. This is supported by the silver-stained gel of COX purified from a strain expressing Cox16-CH. The upward shift in the migration of Cox16p-CH elicits an increase in staining at the position of Cox4p and Cox5p with a concomitant decrease but not complete disappearance of stain at the position of Cox6p (third lane in Fig. 4C). The remaining stain at the position of Cox6p in this strain is probably Cox16p. The strain expressing Cox16p-CH also showed a decrease of silver staining at the position of Cox6 (last lane in Fig. 4C). The silver-stained band remaining in this strain is probably Cox6p. COX is a hetero-oligomeric member of bacterial and mitochondrial respiratory chains. X-ray crystallography of bovine COX indicates that it is composed of 13 unique subunit polypeptides (1Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. The whole structure of the 13-subunit oxidized cytochrome c oxidase at 2.8 A.Science. 1996; 272: 1136-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1921) Google Scholar). Three core subunits that are in encoded in mtDNA are homologous to the three subunits of the bacterial complex. Whereas bacterial COX is composed of three or four subunits (25Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H. (1995) Structure at 2.8 A resolution of cytochrome c oxidase from Paracoccus denitrificans.Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1980) Google Scholar), mitochondrial COX has additional subunits that appear to play a structure role but do not contribute to the mechanism of electron transfer and proton translocation across the inner membrane. These nuclear encoded subunits surround the three catalytic core subunits. The eight structural subunits of yeast COX are all homologous to the bovine subunits. Two of the bovine subunits (VIIb and VIII), however, have no homologues in yeast (Table 1). Although the composition of bovine COX has been determined from crystallographic studies, that of yeast has been inferred from a combination of SDS-PAGE separations of the subunits in purified COX (26Taanman J.W.

Chem. 1992; 267: 22473-22480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate the presence in the yeast supercomplexes of COX with a 12th low-molecular-weight subunit protein (Cox26p) (2Strecker V. Kadeer Z. Heidler J. Cruciat C.M. Angerer H. Giese H. Pfeiffer K. Stuart R.A. Wittig I. Supercomplex-associated Cox26 protein binds to cytochrome c oxidase.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2016; 1863: 1643-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 3Levchenko M. Wuttke J.M. Römpler K. Schmidt B. Neifer K. Juris L. Wissel M. Rehling P. Deckers M. Cox26 is a novel stoichiometric subunit of the yeast cytochrome c oxidase.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2016; 1863: 1624-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In the present study, we present evidence that Cox16p, a protein previously proposed to be a COX-specific assembly factor (16Carlson C.G. Barrientos A. Tzagoloff A. Glerum D.M. COX16 encodes a novel protein required for the assembly of cytochrome oxidase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3770-3775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), is associated with yeast with either COX itself or with the supercomplexes. This is based on the following evidence. 1) Pull down assays with tagged Cox16p co-immunopurify the D2, D3 and D4 but not the smaller D1 (13McStay G.P. Su C.H. Tzagoloff A. Modular assembly of yeast cytochrome oxidase.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2013; 24: 440-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 21McStay G.P. Su C.H. Thomas S.M. Xu J.T. Tzagoloff A. Characterization of assembly intermediates containing subunit 1 of yeast cytochrome oxidase.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 26546-26556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) assembly intermediates of Cox1p. 2) Cox16p is also associated with mature COX and with COX present in the supercomplexes. This was shown both by immune adsorption of Cox16p-CH and by Western analysis of affinity-purified COX separated by BN-PAGE. Mass spectrometry analysis also indicated the presence of Cox16p in the yeast supercomplexes (31Vukotic M. Oeljeklaus S. Wiese S. Vögtle F.N. Meisinger C. Meyer H.E. Zieseniss A. Katschinski D.M. Jans D.C. Jakobs S. Warscheid B. Rehling P. Deckers M. Rcf1 mediates cytochrome oxidase assembly and respirasome formation, revealing heterogeneity of the enzyme complex.Cell Metab. 2012; 15: 336-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Cox16p-CH migrates in the region of Cox4p and Cox5p when the purified complex is separated by SDS-PAGE. Native Cox16p, however, probably migrates together with Cox6p. Based on the antibody-antigen signal strength, Cox16p appears to be substoichiometric with Cox1p and Cox4p. This could be a consequence of a difference in the accessibility to the protein C antibody of the tags on the two proteins. Alternatively, Cox16p may be associated with only a fraction of COX. Based on protein sequence alignments and hydrophilicity profiles, Cox16p does not appear to be related to either subunit VIIB or VIII of bovine COX. The yeast protein, however, has homologues in a broad range of organisms including fungi and mammals. An alignment of the yeast, mushroom, and human proteins are shown in Fig. 5A. The three proteins also share a similar hydrophilicity profile, although yeast Cox16p has a longer hydrophilic N-terminal sequence. The presence in the bovine genome of a Cox16p homologue and its absence in the purified COX complex are perplexing. One possible explanation is that the interaction of the mammalian Cox16p with mammalian COX is weaker than it is in yeast and as a consequence is shed during purification, which involves use of strong detergents such as lauryl maltoside or bile acids. The genotypes and sources of the S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are described in Table 2. The compositions of solid and liquid YPD, YPGal, and YEPG have been described previously (32Myers A.M. Pape L.K. Tzagoloff A. Mitochondrial protein synthesis is required for maintenance of intact mitochondrial genomes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2087-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). COX16-CH, expressing Cox16p with a C-terminal tandem protein C followed by a polyhistidine tag, was constructed by PCR amplification of the gene with 500 bp of 5′-UTRs plus the coding sequences (minus the termination codon) from purified nuclear DNA of W303-1B with primers 5′-ggcgagctctctgggaaggtttcaactcat and 5′-ggcctgcagccagacattctcagattcatc. The PCR product was digested with a combination of SacI plus PstI and was ligated to YIp349-CH, an integrative plasmid with a TRP1 selectable marker and the CH cassette (gaagatcaggtagatccacggttaatcgatggtaagggaggaggacaccatcaccatcatcactaa) inserted between PstI and HindIII sites of the multiple cloning sequence of YIp349. YIp349 is similar to YIp351 (33Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast/E.coli shuttle vectors with multiple unique restriction sites.Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar), except that LEU2 is replaced with TRP1. The resultant plasmid (pG22/ST13) was linearized by digestion with BstX1 internal to TRP1 and was integrated at the trp1 locus of W303-1B (34Rothstein R.J. One-step gene disruption in yeast.Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2026) Google Scholar). Yeast was grown in YPGal and mitochondria isolated by the method of Herrmann et al. (35Herrmann J.M. Foelsch H. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Isolation of yeast mitochondria and study of mitochondrial protein translation.in: Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. Vol. I.

Unless otherwise indicated, the mitochondria (250 μg of protein) were labeled for 20 min at 25 °C with [35S]methionine/cysteine (3,000 Ci/mmol; MP Biochemicals, Solon, OH) (13McStay G.P. Su C.H. Tzagoloff A. Modular assembly of yeast cytochrome oxidase.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2013; 24: 440-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The labeled mitochondria were extracted with digitonin and purified on protein C antibody beads as described previously. Purification, ligation and transformation of DNA in Escherichia coli were done under standards conditions (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Yeast was transformed by the lithium acetate method of Schiestl and Gietz (37Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. High efficiency transformation of intact yeast cells using single stranded nucleic acids as a carrier.Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1773) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, the proteins were separated by either by SDS-PAGE on 12% in standard Laemmli buffer (38Laemmli U.K. Cleavage of structural proteins during the assembly of the head of bacteriophage T4.Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar) or in 17.5% polyacrylamide with a ratio of acrylamide to bis-acrylamide of 30:0.2 and run in Laemmli buffer (36Sambrook J.

Western blots were treated with a polyclonal antibody to the protein C epitope followed by a second reaction with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma), and proteins were detected with SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate kit (Pierce).

We reported previously that Janus kinase 3, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, plays a crucial role in AJ formation through its interaction with β-catenin. In this report, we characterize the structural determinants responsible for Jak3 interactions with β-catenin and determine the functional implications of previously unknown tyrosine residues on β-catenin phosphorylated by Jak3. We demonstrate that Jak3 autophosphorylation was the rate-limiting step during Jak3 trans-phosphorylation of β-catenin, where Jak3 directly phosphorylated three tyrosine residues, viz. Tyr30, Tyr64, and Tyr86 in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of β-catenin. However, prior phosphorylation of β-catenin at Tyr654 was essential for further phosphorylation of β-catenin by Jak3. Interaction studies indicated that phosphorylated Jak3 bound to phosphorylated β-catenin with a dissociation constant of 0.28 μm, and although both the kinase and FERM (Band 4.1, ezrin, radixin, and moesin) domains of Jak3 interacted with β-catenin, the NTD domain of β-catenin facilitated its interactions with Jak3. Physiologically, Jak3-mediated phosphorylation of β-catenin suppressed EGF-mediated epithelial–mesenchymal transition and facilitated epithelial barrier functions by AJ localization of phosphorylated β-catenin through its interactions with α-catenin. Moreover, loss of Jak3-mediated phosphorylation sites in β-catenin abrogated its AJ localization and compromised epithelial barrier functions.

https://openalex.org/W2748265524,"Protein kinase Cα (PKCα) belongs to the family of AGC kinases that phosphorylate multiple peptide substrates. Although the consensus sequence motif has been identified and used to explain substrate specificity for PKCα, it does not inform the structural basis of substrate-binding and kinase activity for diverse substrates phosphorylated by this kinase. The transient, dynamic, and unstructured nature of this protein–protein interaction has limited structural mapping of kinase–substrate interfaces. Here, using multiscale MD simulation-based predictions and FRET sensor-based experiments, we investigated the conformational dynamics of the kinase–substrate interface. We found that the binding strength of the kinase–substrate interaction is primarily determined by long-range columbic interactions between basic (Arg/Lys) residues located N-terminally to the phosphorylated Ser/Thr residues in the substrate and by an acidic patch in the kinase catalytic domain. Kinase activity stemmed from conformational flexibility in the region C-terminal to the phosphorylated Ser/Thr residues. Flexibility of the substrate–kinase interaction enabled an Arg/Lys two to three amino acids C-terminal to the phosphorylated Ser/Thr to prime a catalytically active conformation, facilitating phosphoryl transfer to the substrate. The structural mechanisms determining substrate binding and catalytic activity formed the basis of diverse binding affinities and kinase activities of PKCα for 14 substrates with varying degrees of sequence conservation.

Substrate selectivity of protein kinases is currently best rationalized by a consensus amino acid sequence flanking the phosphorylated serine or threonine, termed the substrate recognition motif (1Rust H.L. Thompson P.R. Kinase consensus sequences: a breeding ground for crosstalk.ACS Chem. Biol. 2011; 6: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). As we have shown recently (3Sommese R.F.

These FRET sensors are designed using Systematic Protein Affinity Strength Modulation (SPASM) (13Sivaramakrishnan S. Spudich J.A.

U.S.A. 2011; 108: 20467-20472Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), which has the sensitivity to measure weak protein–protein interactions and is scalable to multiple substrates. Using SPASM measurements on 14 different substrate peptides (shown in supplemental Fig. S1) with PKCα, we showed that above a minimum-required binding affinity to induce kinase activity, the kinase-specific activity is inversely correlated with the substrate-binding affinity (3Sommese R.F. Sivaramakrishnan S. Substrate affinity differentially influences protein kinase C regulation and inhibitor potency.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 21963-21970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This inverse correlation between the binding affinity and kinase activity toward substrates are shown in supplemental Fig. S1. Consequently, substrates with high-affinity but low activity outcompete their low-affinity but high activity counterparts, suggesting a simple biochemical mechanism for selective substrate phosphorylation in cells. However, our FRET sensor measurements lack the structural resolution to dissect the conformational dynamics of the interaction, and identify specific residues that modulate binding affinity and activity. Given that the region of the substrate peptide that binds to PKCα is largely disordered, multiscale MD simulation methods are ideally suited to study the ensemble of conformations that the substrate peptides adopt when they bind to PKCα. The generalized Newton-Euler inverse mass operator (GNEIMO) internal coordinate molecular dynamics method has several advanced multiresolution features that are essential for the enriched conformational sampling of disordered substrate binding to PKCα (14Nishikawa K.

The GNEIMO method allows coarsening of the dynamic model of the protein, without using a coarse grain force field that loses the atomistic resolution of the simulations (16Gerlits O. Tian J. Das A. Langan P. Heller W.T. Kovalevsky A. Phosphoryl transfer reaction snapshots in crystals: insights into the mechanism of protein kinase A catalytic subunit.J. Biol.

Comparative protein structure modeling using MODELLER.Curr. Protoc. Bioinformatic. 2014; 2014: 5.6.1Crossref Scopus (795) Google Scholar). In GNEIMO torsional MD, the helices/β-sheets in the catalytic domain are treated as a rigid body, whereas the loops and peptide-binding surfaces in the kinase and the entire substrate peptide are modeled as flexible torsions (see supplemental Fig. S2). Use of such a coarse grain model permits a broader range of conformational sampling of the kinase-substrate conformational ensemble. Here, we have used the GNEIMO coarse grain dynamic model to perform torsional MD simulations of the binding of 14 peptide substrates (shown in supplemental Table S1) to PKCα. The predictions of the residues in the substrate that contribute to binding and kinase activity from the GNEIMO MD model have been tested extensively with SPASM FRET sensors and kinase activity assays to gain insight into the structural dynamics of kinase–substrate interactions. The schematic of the workflow combining the GNEIMO with SPASM FRET methods to probe the dynamics of the kinase peptide substrate interactions is shown in Fig. 1. Details of this workflow are described under “Experimental procedures.” Using this combination of computational and experimental methods, we find that the substrate region N-terminal to the phosphorylated serine residue determines the kinase–substrate interaction affinity. In contrast, high kinase activity requires a high degree of conformation flexibility within the substrate region C-terminal to the phosphorylated serine residue. High activity substrates show greater conformational flexibility within the kinase active site compared with their low activity counterparts. An arginine residue located either two or three amino acids C-terminal to the phosphorylated serine residue, optimally positions the phosphorylated serine for catalysis. Taken together, our study reveals two distinct mechanisms that dictate substrate-binding affinity and activity, whereas emphasizing the importance of substrate conformational dynamics in determining the relative activity of a kinase for distinct substrates. We have studied the dynamics of 14 peptide substrates binding to the catalytic domain of PKCα using GNEIMO coarse grain MD simulations followed by all-atom MD simulations. Fig. 2A shows the binding groove of the tight binding peptide p12 that shows the lowest kinase activity among the 14 peptides (see supplemental Fig. S1 for the relative binding affinities and kinase activity of all 14 substrate peptides). Our MD simulation results indicate that an acidic patch of residues located in the substrate-binding groove of PKCα make strong electrostatic interactions with the basic residues in the N terminus of the peptide substrates (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S3). In contrast, the residues in the kinase that interact with the C terminus of the peptide are hydrophobic, resulting in a deep insertion of the peptide C terminus (Fig. 2A). We analyzed the residues in PKCα that make sustained (present in over 40% of the snapshots from MD simulations) salt bridge, hydrogen bond, or van der Waals contact with residues in the N terminus of the peptides. The acidic patch of residues consisting of Asp383, Asp470, Asp506, Glu533, and Glu544, Glu548, and Asp542 (shown in spheres and sticks in Fig. 2A) make close contact with the N terminus residues of the peptide substrates (see the electrostatic surface shown in supplemental Fig. S3). Many of these acidic residues listed above are conserved across the PKC family as shown in supplemental Fig. S4. The stronger electrostatic interactions of the peptide N terminus compared with the C terminus suggested that this region contributes substantially to the peptide-binding energy. To test this possibility, we calculated the average interaction energies, averaged across the three all-atom MD trajectories for each peptide substrate and compared them to previous FRET measurements (3Sommese R.F. Sivaramakrishnan S. Substrate affinity differentially influences protein kinase C regulation and inhibitor potency.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 21963-21970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The calculated interaction energies between the N terminus residues of the peptide substrate with the catalytic domain of PKCα correlate linearly with the measured binding affinity of kinase–substrate peptide interaction (3Sommese R.F. Sivaramakrishnan S. Substrate affinity differentially influences protein kinase C regulation and inhibitor potency.J. Biol.

U.S.A. 2011; 108: 20467-20472Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) with a R2 = 0.8, as shown in Fig. 2B. However, the calculated interaction energies of the entire peptide substrate with the catalytic domain of PKCα did not show a good correlation (R2 = 0.48; supplemental Fig. S5). The structural ensemble for the peptide–PKC interface interactions were generated using GNEIMO-MD simulations followed by all-atom MD simulations as described under “Experimental procedures.” To test these predicted peptide–kinase interactions, we proposed mutations in the poor binding and high activity peptides such as p1, p2, p4, and p6 to improve their binding affinity to the kinase without affecting the kinase activity toward these peptides. We calculated the average interaction energy of each residue in every peptide substrate with the kinase. Using the residues that contribute weakly to the substrate–kinase interaction, we predicted mutations in these four weak binding peptides and these mutants were expressed as FRET sensors along with the catalytic domain of PKCα (see “Experimental procedures”). Residue numbering on the peptide substrates is from the N to C terminus with the phosphorylated Ser/Thr numbered as position 9 for all peptide substrates (see supplemental Table S1). Each of these mutations showed a significant increase in FRET ratio, suggesting an increase in binding affinity of the peptide for the catalytic domain (Fig. 2D). It is clearly seen that mutation of N terminus residues to a basic residue such as Arg increases affinity for the acidic patch of PKCα and therefore improves their binding. As seen in Fig. 2E, most of the mutations in the N terminus residues of p1, p2, p4, and p6 showed a small but not significant increase in kinase activity. This suggests that the kinase activity on these 14 peptide substrates may be governed additionally by other mechanisms. Interestingly, the kinase–substrate-binding affinity correlates linearly with a recognition metric derived based on the consensus motif (14Nishikawa K. Toker A. Johannes F.J. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Determination of the specific substrate sequence motifs of protein kinase C isozymes.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 952-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C). Nishikawa et al. (14Nishikawa K. Toker A. Johannes F.J. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Determination of the specific substrate sequence motifs of protein kinase C isozymes.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 952-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) characterized the substrate recognition motif of PKCα using a degenerate peptide library phosphorylated by the kinase. For each location relative to the phosphorylated serine/threonine, they reported the fold-enrichment in substrate phosphorylation with a specific amino acid compared with a degenerate sequence. With the assumption that the reported fold-enrichments are additive, we linearly combined these values for all conserved residues to arrive at a recognition metric. Our finding highlights the role of consensus motif and its correlation to the peptide substrate-binding affinity correlation to the peptide substrate-binding affinity and not to the kinase activity. We examined further the properties of the dynamics of the peptide substrate that would correlate to the kinase activity. The peptide substrates with good kinase activity show an enrichment of catalytic conformations during the dynamics simulations. Recently, Gerlits et al. (15Gerlits O. Waltman M.J. Taylor S. Langan P. Kovalevsky A. Insights into the phosphoryl transfer catalyzed by cAMP-dependent protein kinse: an x-ray crystallographic study of complexes with various metals and peptide substrate SP20.Biochemistry. 2013; 52: 3721-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) solved crystal structures of PKA that represent different snapshots of the kinase in the catalytic process of transferring the PO4 group, to show a plausible “catalytic conformation” of PKA. Such a catalytic conformation shows the Ser/Thr that gets phosphorylated in the peptide substrate close to the Asp166 (residue number as in PKA) as well as the γ-PO4 group of the ATP. The Asp166 is involved in abstracting the proton from the hydroxyl group of the pSer that enables the transfer of the PO4 group from ATP to pSer/Thr in the peptide substrate. We used this definition of the catalytic conformation to analyze the differences in the population of the catalytic conformation in the conformational ensemble derived from MD trajectories for the high activity peptides p1, p2, and p3 compared with the poor activity peptides p10, p11, and p12. Fig. 3A shows a snapshot from the MD simulation trajectory of high activity peptide p2 that shows the shortest distance between the Ser in p2 and Asp466 and the γ-PO4 group of the ATP. This conformation is representative of a plausible catalytic conformation of PKCα as seen in our dynamics simulations. The oxygen atom of the Ser in the peptide is about 4 Å from both the Asp466 of PKCα and the γ-PO4 group of the ATP. We also observed that the Na+ ions used to neutralize charges in the MD simulations cluster around the PO4 groups of the ATP. The position of these Na+ ions is similar to the Ca2+ ions in the crystal structure (PDB code 4XW5) of the catalytic conformation of PKA (15Gerlits O. Waltman M.J. Taylor S. Langan P. Kovalevsky A. Insights into the phosphoryl transfer catalyzed by cAMP-dependent protein kinse: an x-ray crystallographic study of complexes with various metals and peptide substrate SP20.Biochemistry. 2013; 52: 3721-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Fig. 3B shows the snapshot with the closest distance of the poor activity peptide p12 to Asp466 and γ-PO4 group of the ATP extracted from the MD simulations. As anticipated, the catalytic distances in this low activity peptide is longer than that of the good activity of p2, thus leading to lower kinase activity of this peptide substrate. We clustered the MD ensemble for peptides p1, p2, p3, p9, p11, and p12 by the two distances of the phosphorylated Ser/Thr to Asp466 and the γ-PO4 group of ATP as shown in Fig. 3C and supplemental Fig. S6. This population distribution shows that the highest population cluster for the good activity peptides p1, p2, and p3 is around shorter distances and is much tighter for high activity peptides compared with their low activity counterparts p9, p11, and p12 (Fig. 3C and supplemental Fig. S6). This suggests that peptides with high kinase activity are more likely to populate catalytic conformations compared with the low activity peptides as shown in Fig. 3D. The crystal structures of PKA (16Gerlits O. Tian J. Das A. Langan P. Heller W.T. Kovalevsky A.

Chem. 2015; 290: 15538-15548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) show a rotamer flip in the χ1 angle of the phosphorylated Ser/Thr as shown in Fig. 3E. The side chain rotamer of the Ser/Thr in the peptide substrate flips its rotamer after the PO4 transfer to the Ser/Thr of the peptide. To verify if we could capture this rotamer flip in the pSer/Thr in the substrate, we performed MD simulations after transferring the PO4 group from ATP to the pSer/Thr in the substrate. To this end we extracted the best catalytic conformation with the shortest distance of Ser/Thr (OG) to the γ-PO4 of ATP as well as to Asp466 (OD), in the peptide p1 as detailed under ”Experimental procedures.“ We then transferred the PO4 group to the Ser/Thr of the peptide, leaving ADP in the ATP-binding site. We performed all-atom MD simulations on these two peptides bound to PKCα. We then examined the rotamer conformations of the Ser/Thr residue in the peptide substrate before and after phosphoryl transfer. Fig. 3F shows the rotamer flip of the χ1 angle of the Ser/Thr in peptide substrates before and after the phosphoryl transfer. The rotamer change leads to moving the side chain of Ser/Thr away from Asp466 (Fig. 3F). The repulsion between the PO4 group in pSer/Thr with Asp466 could trigger the rotamer flip in the pSer/Thr, and we speculate that this could be the initiating event for the peptide substrate to move away from the catalytic conformation before it dissociates from the kinase. In summary, our simulations show that high activity peptides show a higher population of the kinase–substrate conformations that are conducive to catalysis, with subsequent phosphoryl transfer leading to an expected change in rotamer of the pSer as seen in the crystal structures. Our dynamics simulations capture the conformational changes that lead to the catalysis of PO4 transfer. Why do high activity peptides more frequently populate active conformations? Analysis of the MD simulation results showed that long range Coulombic attraction of the Arg/Lys, located two or three residues C-terminal to the phosphorylated residue (positions 11 and 12), to the γ-PO4 group of the ATP ushers the Ser/Thr that is adjacent to this residue closer to the ATP thereby priming phosphoryl transfer. Fig. 4A shows the plot of distance between the γ-PO4 group of ATP and the residues at positions (Ser) 9 and 11 in the peptide substrates p2 and p12 with time in nanoseconds. In the high activity peptide p2, the Arg11 in p2 gets close to the γ-PO4 group of ATP thereby ushering in its neighbor Ser at position 9 in the peptide substrate p2. Such a long range Coulombic attraction between Phe11 in peptide p12 and the γ-PO4 group of ATP is not possible in the low activity peptide p12. Fig. 4B shows a snapshot from the MD simulations demonstrating the proximity of the γ-PO4 group of ATP to Ser9 and Arg11 of peptide p2. To test this further using our kinase Glo assays, we mutated to Arg/Lys these positions in the low activity peptides p9, p10, and p12 (supplemental Fig. S1). Mutation of residues at positions 11 and 12 in low activity peptides p9, p10, and p12 to Arg or Lys shows improved activity in all the three peptides (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, peptide p2 has only two basic residues, Arg4 and Arg11, but exhibits high kinase activity. Mutagenesis of Arg11 to Ile is sufficient to completely abolish the activity of this peptide (Fig. 4C). Likewise, transfer of Arg to position 12 (R11I and G12R) retains partial peptide activity attesting to the importance of the long-range Coulomb interaction mediated by an Arg/Lys residue 2–3 amino acids C-terminal to the phosphorylated Ser/Thr in driving kinase-specific activity. These single point and double mutations to Arg in the peptides p2, p9, p10, and p12 do not change their FRET ratio and therefore their binding affinities, as shown in Fig. 4D. As seen in supplemental Fig. S1, peptide substrates p10 and p13 show similar binding affinities but p13 shows significantly different kinase activity. What are the differences in the dynamics of p10 and p13 that explain the differences in their kinase activities? To examine the dynamics of the peptide substrate when bound to the kinase, we compared the root mean square fluctuation (r.m.s. fluctuation) of p10 and p13. The r.m.s. fluctuation for every residue in the peptide substrate reflects the flexibility of the peptide in the binding groove in PKCα. Supplemental Fig. S7 shows the population density of r.m.s. fluctuation for every residue in p10 and p13 when bound to PKCα during all-atom explicit MD simulations. The r.m.s. fluctuation is calculated with respect to the average structure derived from the MD trajectories as reference. Position 9 in the figure is the position of the Ser/Thr that gets phosphorylated by PKCα. Although residues N-terminal to the phosphorylated Ser/Thr display overlapping distributions of r.m.s. fluctuation, the C-terminal residues of p13 have a considerably broader distribution than p10. We examined the peptide substrates p4, p5, and p13 that exhibit similar kinase activity but substantial differences in binding affinity (supplemental Fig. S1; p4 > p5 > p13). These three peptides show similar flexibility (by r.m.s. fluctuation) for all the residues in the peptides (shown in supplemental Fig. S8). However, the interaction energies of the residues N terminus to pSer/Thr in these substrates correspond to the reported binding strengths of these peptides (shown in supplemental Table S2). Thus, higher flexibility in the region C-terminal to pSer/Thr in the peptide substrates corresponds to the better kinase activity. The goal of this study is to provide mechanistic insights into the structural and dynamic features of the PKCα–peptide interface that contribute to the binding and kinase activity of 14 different peptide substrates. We identify that the basic residues (Arg/Lys) located N-terminal to the pSer/Thr in the peptide substrates contribute significantly to their binding affinity. The acidic residues Asp383, Asp470, Asp506, Glu533, and Glu544, Glu548, and Asp542 in PKCα form a negatively charged patch to embed the Arg/Lys-rich N terminus of the tight binding peptide substrates.

Here we report that 6-methoxyethylamino-numonafide (MEAN) is a potent growth inhibitor of murine xenografts of 2 human HCC cell lines. At the same dose and with the same treatment strategies, MEAN was more efficacious in inhibiting tumor growth in mice than sorafenib, the only approved drug for HCC. Treatment by MEAN at an effective dose for 6 wk was well tolerated by animals. Combined therapy using both sorafenib and MEAN enhanced tumor growth inhibition over monotherapy with either agent. Additional experiments revealed that MEAN inhibited tumor growth through mechanisms distinct from those of either its parent compound, amonafide, or sorafenib. MEAN suppressed C-MYC expression and increased expression of several tumor suppressor genes, including Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase-1 (SHP-1) and TXNIP (thioredoxin-interacting protein). As an encouraging feature for envisioned clinical application, the IC50 of MEAN was not significantly changed in several drug-resistant cell lines with activated P-glycoprotein drug efflux pumps compared to drug-sensitive parent cells, demonstrating the ability of MEAN to be effective in cells resistant to existing chemotherapy regimens.

Among patients with sporadic CJD (sCJD), a wide range of clinical and neuropathological phenotypes has been observed. The molecular basis of such phenotypic diversity involves a methionine/valine (Met/Val) polymorphism at codon 129 of the prion protein gene (PRNP), combined with different folding patterns of the PrPSc that accumulates in the brain of affected individuals. The latter is reflected by different sizes of the residual, protease-resistant core fragments of PrPSc (21 kDa: type 1; 19 kDa: type 2a) detected by Western blot analysis following digestion with proteinase-K (PK), suggesting different PK cleavage sites for different conformations of PrPSc (8Parchi P.

A higher proportion of diglycosylated forms characterizes the type 2b PrPSc that is found in variant CJD (vCJD), which results from the cattle to human transmission of the prion strain responsible for the epizootic bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) (9Collinge J. Rossor M. A new variant of prion disease.Lancet. 1996; 347: 916-917Abstract PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). vCJD is associated with a particular involvement of the posterior thalamus (10Brandel J.P.

One of the fundamental challenges in prion research is the development and implementation of in vitro models, as protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) (11Saborio G.P. Permanne B. Soto C. Sensitive detection of pathological prion protein by cyclic amplification of protein misfolding.Nature. 2001; 411: 810-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar), for the investigation of the mechanisms underlying the strain-specific targeting of brain regions. Using PrPSc from CJD-infected brain homogenate as seed and an excess of PrPC from normal brain homogenate as substrate, PMCA conducted in a cyclic manner, conceptually analogous to polymerase chain reaction (PCR), is able to amplify minute quantities of PrPSc present in a sample. This technology has proven very useful to study prion strain behaviors such as genotypic barrier of transmission and strain mutation/adaptation (12Jones M. Peden A.H. Prowse C.V. Gröner A.

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease protein misfolding cyclic amplification proteinase-K sporadic CJD variant CJD region-specific PMCA Met/Met genotype at codon 129 of the prion protein gene Val/Val genotype at codon 129 of the prion protein gene. To address this still unresolved issue regarding human prion diseases, we took advantage of PMCA. In this study, we provide the first evidence that a model of specific targeting by human prion strains can be obtained in vitro using region-specific PMCA (rsPMCA). Our results also indicate that (i) strain targeting depends not only on neuroanatomical pathways or cell to cell interactions, which cannot operate in PMCA, but also on local molecular factors and (ii) in addition to cellular prion protein, other region- and species-specific molecular factors influence the conversion process in a strain-dependent-manner. When transmitted to transgenic mice (Fig. 1A) overexpressing human PrPC with a methionine at codon 129 (tg650), as shown by PrP immunohistochemistry (Fig. 1B) and Western blot detection of PrPSc (Fig. 1C), the vCJD strain replicated variously in the different brain regions with high PrPSc load notably in the striatum and the occipital cortex and a low involvement of the cerebellum in agreement with a previous study (16Béringue V. Le Dur A. Tixador P. Reine F. Lepourry L. Perret-Liaudet A. Haïk S. Vilotte J.L. Fontés M. Laude H. Prominent and persistent extraneural infection in human PrP transgenic mice infected with variant CJD.PLoS One. 2008; 3: e1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Using rsPMCA (Fig. 1D), we observed that frontal cortex, striatum, and occipital cortex from tg650 mice amplified vCJD seed more efficiently than cerebellar cortex (Fig. 1E). The values of relative amplification obtained with frontal cortex and striatum were significantly different (p < 0.05) compared with the value obtained with cerebellum (Fig. 1F). Interestingly, when amplification results were plotted as a function of relative PrPSc levels in corresponding brain regions from vCJD-infected tg650 mice (Fig. 1G), we observed a strong and significant correlation (r = 0.99, p < 0.01). This suggests that the strain tropism observed in experimental prion disease could be mimicked in vitro by rsPMCA. To further explore this phenomenon, we used three well characterized experimental scrapie strains (139A, 22L, and ME7) stabilized in a C57BL/6 background. These strains induce distinct lesion profiles (Fig. 2, A, E, and I) and have shown distinct behaviors when propagated in primary neurons from various brain origins (17Hannaoui S. Maatouk L. Privat N. Levavasseur E. Faucheux B.A. Haïk S. Prion propagation and toxicity occur in vitro with two-phase kinetics specific to strain and neuronal type.J. Virol. 2013; 87: 2535-2548Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The amplification obtained with rsPMCA partially matched the spread of the scrapie agents observed in vivo (Fig. 2, B and C, F and G, J and K) showing a correlation coefficient of 0.88 for the 139A strain, of 0.54 for the 22L strain, and of 0.54 for the ME7 strain (Fig. 2, D, H, and L). To note, the proportion of diglycosylated forms of PK-resistant PrP was increased in PMCA products as compared with infected brain homogenates (see supplemental Fig. S1). A very similar change in the glycosylation pattern of PrPSc with PMCA conditions has been already observed with the 139A strain and using the same anti-PrP 6D11 antibody (18Gao C. Han J. Zhang J. Wei J. Zhang B.Y. Tian C. Zhang J. Shi Q. Dong X.P. Protein misfolding cyclic amplification cross-species products of mouse-adapted scrapie strain 139A and hamster-adapted scrapie strain 263K with brain and muscle tissues of opposite animals generate infectious prions.Mol. Neurobiol. 2017; 54: 3771-3782Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). When all the experimental amplification results are plotted as a function of relative PrPSc levels in corresponding C57BL/6-infected brain regions, we observed a positive and significant correlation (r = 0.65; p < 0.01) (Fig. 2M). In the context of an interspecies transmission (vCJD to tg650) and despite the expression of the M129 human PrP by mice, the regional brain tropism of the vCJD agent is different from that observed in vCJD patients where the pulvinar nuclei and the cerebellar cortex are strongly involved (10Brandel J.P. Heath C.A. Head M.W. Levavasseur E. Knight R. Laplanche J.L. Langeveld J.P. Ironside J.W. Hauw J.J. Mackenzie J. Alpérovitch A. Will R.G. Haïk S. Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in France and the United Kingdom: Evidence for the same agent strain.Ann. Neurol. 2009; 65: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To assess whether rsPMCA could mimic the brain tropism observed in humans, we next performed rsPMCA using vCJD PrPSc seed and human brain substrates from codon 129 MM individuals. The same vCJD seed was efficiently but variously amplified using different areas sampled from human MM brains (Fig. 3A). Significant interregional differences in amplification results were observed (p < 0.05, frontal cortex versus pulvinar, occipital cortex versus striatum, pulvinar, and cerebellum) (Fig. 3B). The Pearson correlation coefficient between amplification values and PrPSc levels in the corresponding brain areas of the vCJD patient was 0.68 (Fig. 3C). We validated this result using (i) additional substrates from a distinct MM individual and the same vCJD seed and (ii) an additional seed from another vCJD isolate with the first set of substrates. When using an additional vCJD seed, the correlation coefficient between amplification values and PrPSc levels in corresponding areas was 0.12. When the relative amplification values were corrected for PrPC relative levels of each substrate, the coefficient value reached 0.78 (close to that obtained using the first vCJD case, i.e. 0.84). When we used an additional set of human substrates from a codon 129 MM individual, we obtained a final correlation coefficient of 0.68 (supplemental Fig. S2). To note, despite similar post-mortem delay, the relative level of PrPC in the different human brain areas varied between both MM individuals. Interestingly, the amplifications obtained with human cerebellum were in contrast with those obtained using tg650 cerebellar substrates. Next, we assessed a sCJD isolate characterized by a distinct genotype at codon 129 of PRNP, and, in contrast with vCJD, mild involvement of the pulvinar region and strong targeting of the cerebellar cortex (i.e. the ataxic VV2a subtype of sCJD with early cerebellar ataxia and late dementia). We were able to amplify this seed with various brain regions selected from a human VV individual (Fig. 3D). Interregional variations in amplification results were observed (p < 0.01, cerebellum versus frontal cortex, pulvinar, and occipital cortex; p < 0.05, striatum versus cerebellum and pulvinar) (Fig. 3E). Pulvinar substrate showed poor amplification efficiency, and, as expected, cerebellar substrate efficiently amplified VV2a PrPSc seed. We found a high correlation between amplification values and PrPSc levels in the corresponding brain areas of the VV2a-sCJD patient (r = 0.98, p < 0.01) (Fig. 3F). When all human amplification results were plotted as a function of relative PrPSc levels in corresponding infected brain regions (Fig. 3G), a significant correlation was observed (r = 0.59, p < 0.01). The correlation was better (r = 0.75, p < 0.001) when the relative amplification values were corrected for PrPC levels of each substrate (Fig. 3H). Finally, when all seed/substrate couples (n = 8) were pooled (Fig. 4A), we found a highly significant correlation between the regional tropism of prion strains and the relative amplification values obtained using rsPMCA (r = 0.65, p < 0.0001). When the relative amplification values were corrected for PrPC relative levels of each substrate (Fig. 4B), the correlation between in vivo and rsPMCA results decreased (r = 0.40) consistently with a positive role of PrPC level in PMCA efficacy. Interestingly, a significant correlation was maintained (p = 0.01), however, suggesting that PrPC is not the sole factor involved in the region-specific conversion of PrP. To further investigate this hypothesis, we assessed whether homogenates from distinct brain regions of mice devoid of PrPC could modulate the PMCA efficacy. In vCJD amplification experiment, we observed that the significant decrease of PMCA efficacy induced by the dilution of tg650 frontal cortex substrate with conversion buffer was abolished by replacing the conversion buffer with a homogenate prepared with the frontal cortex of PrP knock-out mouse. Interestingly, no effect was observed when a homogenate prepared with the cerebellum from a PrP knock-out mouse was used. When similar experiments were performed with tg650 substrate prepared with the cerebellum, no effect of the homogenates prepared with the frontal cortex or the cerebellum of a PrP knock-out mouse was noted (Fig. 4C). Our study demonstrates that results obtained using rsPMCA are consistent with in vivo observations in mice and humans. This was observed using seeds from two different forms of human prion diseases associated with distinct brain involvement: An infectious form acquired by peripheral contamination (vCJD) and a sporadic subtype of CJD (VV2a sCJD). Both strains were selected because of their ability to be amplified in our hands without addition of PMCA supplements such as digitonin or heparin (19Moda F. Gambetti P. Notari S. Concha-Marambio L. Catania M. Park K.W. Maderna E. Suardi S. Haïk S. Brandel J.P. Ironside J. Knight R. Tagliavini F. Soto C. Prions in the urine of patients with variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.N. Engl. J. Med. 2014; 371: 530-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 20Abid K. Morales R. Soto C. Cellular factors implicated in prion replication.FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 2409-2414Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Because it is well known that region-specific targeting of a given strain varies during interspecies transmission and that interspecies transmission does not depend only on PrP sequence homology (1Prusiner S.B. Prions.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5129) Google Scholar), we assessed whether rsPMCA could also mimic such interspecies variations in prion spread. To this purpose, using the first of the two vCJD seeds amplified by the human MM substrate, we simulated a primary transmission of vCJD in the brain of tg650 mice expressing human PrP with a methionine at codon 129. Amplification levels obtained using rsPMCA matched the spread of the vCJD agent observed in vivo when primary transmission of vCJD in tg650 was performed, showing high involvement of striatum and occipital cortex with important PrPSc deposits, and weak targeting of cerebellar cortex. This result was distinct from that obtained using human MM substrates where a high level of amplification was observed using cerebellar cortex. This implies that the molecular factors involved in vCJD-specific targeting are not only region-specific but also vary between species. Finally, when all the results were pooled, we found a highly significant correlation between in vivo and in vitro regional brain targeting, suggesting that the mechanisms involved are common to various prion strains. From a fundamental point of view, the ability of rsPMCA to mimic prion tropism supports the idea that PrP conversion plays a central role in strain behavior and that differences in conformation and aggregation properties of PrPSc encipher strain diversity (21Prusiner S.B. Shattuck lecture—neurodegenerative diseases and prions.N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 1516-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 22Legname G. Nguyen H.O. Peretz D. Cohen F.E. DeArmond S.J.

U.S.A. 2006; 103: 19105-19110Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In contrast with our results, Hu et al. (23Hu P.P. Morales R. Duran-Aniotz C. Moreno-Gonzalez I. Khan U. Soto C.

Chem. 2016; 291: 12880-12887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) observed that in vitro conversion did not reproduce the pattern of deposition observed in vivo using scrapie-infected hamsters. The discrepancy between the two studies may be explained by the use of distinct prion strains (hamster-adapted scrapie strains versus mouse-adapted scrapie strains and human strains). It is worth noting that the effect of PMCA cofactors may vary with species. Deleault et al. (24Deleault N.R. Kascsak R. Geoghegan J.C. Supattapone S. Species-dependent differences in cofactor utilization for formation of the protease-resistant prion protein in vitro.Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 3928-3934Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) reported that, whereas hamster PrPSc preferentially utilizes RNA as a cofactor, RNA fails to facilitate mouse PrPSc amplification. In addition, a clarification step of the substrate using centrifugation was performed in the hamster study and may have removed some of the components responsible for region-specific modulation of PMCA. Hu et al. (23Hu P.P. Morales R. Duran-Aniotz C. Moreno-Gonzalez I. Khan U. Soto C. Role of prion replication in the strain-dependent brain regional distribution of prions.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 12880-12887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) suggested that in vitro conversion in hamsters was dependent on the availability of PrPC. Using mouse-adapted strains, human isolates amplified using human brain areas, and mouse transgenic brains, we confirmed this results. In addition, our data suggest that brain region targeting depends, in part, on local molecular factors distinct from PrPC. Indeed, a significant correlation was preserved when values were corrected for the relative PrPC level of each substrate, suggesting that additional cofactors may be involved during conversion using distinct brain regions. We also observed that the substrate containing the highest PrPC level is not necessarily the one associated with the highest PMCA efficiency. Moreover, supplementation experiments using homogenates prepared with brain areas from PrP knock-out mice suggested the presence of region-specific modulators of PrP conversion, other than PrPC. Altogether, these results suggest that strain-specific tropism not only depends on neuroanatomical pathways or cell-to-cell interactions, but also on both PrPC level and locally expressed non-PrPC cofactors. It has been suggested that a species-specific cofactor designated protein X, which might function as a molecular chaperone, interferes with the conversion of PrPC into PrPSc (25Telling G.C. Scott M.

The ability to mimic prion strain tropism, in an accelerated model and under controlled conditions in vitro, provides a unique and valuable tool for identifying local molecular cofactors that could highly influence the prion protein conversion process and might even constitute therapeutic targets in human prion diseases. Furthermore, rsPMCA may have various applications in the diagnosis field, risk assessment, and from the public health point of view. Exploiting rsPMCA (for example by using the most efficient brain area as a substrate to amplify a specific strain) may be useful to improve the sensitivity of prion detection in early cases, body fluids, or medical material, as well as in studies of interspecies barrier of transmission, especially in those dealing with the zoonotic risk associated with emerging prion diseases in animals.

SREBPs are cleaved in the Golgi through the combined action of the Dsc E3 ligase complex, the rhomboid protease Rbd2, and the essential ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities (AAA+) ATPase Cdc48. The soluble SREBP N-terminal transcription factor domain is then released into the cytosol to enter the nucleus and regulate gene expression. Previously, we reported that Cdc48 binding to Rbd2 is required for Rbd2-mediated SREBP cleavage. Here, using affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry experiments, we identified Cdc48-binding proteins in S. pombe, generating a list of many previously unknown potential Cdc48-binding partners. We show that the established Cdc48 cofactor Ufd1 is required for SREBP cleavage but does not interact with the Cdc48-Rbd2 complex. Cdc48-Ufd1 is instead required at a step prior to Rbd2 function, during Golgi localization of the Dsc E3 ligase complex. Together, these findings demonstrate that two distinct Cdc48 complexes, Cdc48-Ufd1 and Cdc48-Rbd2, are required for SREBP activation and low-oxygen adaptation in S. pombe."

Moreover, most lysosomal glycosidases are low-mass soluble proteins that do not allow for bulky fluorescent protein fusions. We selected α-galactosidase A (GALA) as a model lysosomal glycosidase involved in Anderson-Fabry disease (AFD) for the current LCI approach. Examination of the subcellular localization of AFD-causing mutants can reveal the mechanism underlying cellular trafficking deficits. To minimize genetic GALA modification, we employed a biarsenical labeling protocol with tetracysteine (TC-tag) detection. We tested the efficiency of halogen-substituted biarsenical probes to interact with C-terminally TC-tagged GALA peptide at pH 4.5 in vitro and identified F2FlAsH-EDT2 as a superior detection reagent for GALA. This probe provides improved signal/noise ratio in labeled COS-7 cells transiently expressing TC-tagged GALA. The investigated fluorescence-based LCI technology of TC-tagged lysosomal protein using an improved biarsenical probe can be used to identify novel compounds that promote proper trafficking of mutant GALA to lysosomal compartments and rescue the mutant phenotype.-Bohl, C., Pomorski, A., Seemann, S., Knospe, A.-M., Zheng, C., Krężel, A., Rolfs, A., Lukas, J.
