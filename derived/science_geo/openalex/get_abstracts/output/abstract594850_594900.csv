https://openalex.org/W2753295567,"Background Informal caregivers of individuals with dementia have an increased risk to face social isolation due to progression of the disease. Online social media interventions might offer a new opportunity to increase access to social support and enhance positive interactions and openness in dementia care networks. Objective This explorative pilot study describes (1) the development of an online social support intervention Inlife, and (2) the evaluation of the feasibility of this intervention and the measurements to assess its effectiveness. Methods The Medical Research Council (MRC) framework guided the development of the online social support intervention. This is a stepwise approach that integrates potential users’ views with the development and validation of the program content. The program was developed by combining (1) individual caregiver interviews (n = 10), (2) focus group sessions with experts and web designers (n = 6), and (3) individual think-aloud tests (n = 2). Subsequently, a pilot study with informal caregivers was conducted (n = 25) to examine the program’s feasibility and preliminary effectiveness. Online self-report measures were completed at baseline and at four follow-up time points. Results In total, 23 participants completed the newly developed Inlife intervention. Despite the high number of low-active users (17/23, 73%), Inlife had a good feasibility score of 7.1 (range: 1–10). The Calendar and Timeline were used most frequently and contributed to better care coordination and positive interactions. Conclusions Although the Inlife platform received a sufficient feasibility rating, the uptake was not optimal. Therefore, the Inlife platform was adapted to limit the number of low-active users and improve user friendliness. Recommendations for additional treatment adherence were provided. The development according to the MRC framework and the sufficient feasibility rating of Inlife formed the basis for a future effectiveness study."
https://openalex.org/W2753820764,"Benzene is a ubiquitous, volatile pollutant present at high concentrations in toxins (e.g. tobacco smoke) known to increase cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Despite its prevalence, the cardiovascular effects of benzene have rarely been studied. Hence, we examined whether exposure to benzene is associated with increased CVD risk. The effects of benzene exposure in mice were assessed by direct inhalation, while the effects of benzene exposure in humans was assessed in 210 individuals with mild to high CVD risk by measuring urinary levels of the benzene metabolite trans,trans-muconic acid (t,t-MA). Generalized linear models were used to assess the association between benzene exposure and CVD risk. Mice inhaling volatile benzene had significantly reduced levels of circulating angiogenic cells (Flk-1+/Sca-1+) as well as an increased levels of plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) compared with control mice breathing filtered air. In the human cohort, urinary levels of t,t-MA were inversely associated several populations of circulating angiogenic cells (CD31+/34+/45+, CD31+/34+/45+/AC133-, CD34+/45+/AC133+). Although t,t-MA was not associated with plasma markers of inflammation or thrombosis, t,t-MA levels were higher in smokers and in individuals with dyslipidemia. In smokers, t,t-MA levels were positively associated with urinary metabolites of nicotine (cotinine) and acrolein (3-hydroxymercapturic acid). Levels of t,t-MA were also associated with CVD risk as assessed using the Framingham Risk Score and this association was independent of smoking. Thus, benzene exposure is associated with increased CVD risk and deficits in circulating angiogenic cells in both smokers and non-smokers."
https://openalex.org/W2753152025,"We recently hypothesized that the intestinal microbiota and the innate immune system play key roles in the mechanism of Kilham Rat Virus-induced type 1 diabetes in the LEW1.WR1 rat. We used this animal model to test the hypothesis that maternal therapy with short-chain fatty acids can modulate the intestinal microbiota and reverse virus-induced proinflammatory responses and type 1 diabetes in rat offspring. We observed that administration of short-chain fatty acids to rat breeders via drinking water prior to pregnancy and further treatment of the offspring with short-chain fatty acids after weaning led to disease amelioration. In contrast, rats that were administered short-chain fatty acids beginning at weaning were not protected from type 1 diabetes. Short-chain fatty acid therapy exerted a profound effect on the intestinal microbiome in the offspring reflected by a reduction and an increase in the abundances of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes taxa, respectively, on day 5 post-infection, and reversed virus-induced alterations in certain bacterial taxa. Principal component analysis and permutation multivariate analysis of variance tests further revealed that short-chain fatty acids induce a distinct intestinal microbiota compared with uninfected animals or rats that receive the virus only. Short-chain fatty acids downregulated Kilham Rat Virus-induced proinflammatory responses in the intestine. Finally, short-chain fatty acids altered the B and T cell compartments in Peyer's patches. These data demonstrate that short-chain fatty acids can reshape the intestinal microbiota and prevent virus-induced islet autoimmunity and may therefore represent a useful therapeutic strategy for disease prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2752032958,"Scientists are increasingly dissatisfied with funding systems that rely on peer assessment and, accordingly, have suggested several proposals for reform. One of these proposals is to distribute available funds equally among all qualified researchers, with no interference from peer review. Despite its numerous benefits, such egalitarian sharing faces the objection, among others, that it would lead to an unacceptable dilution of resources. The aim of the present paper is to assess this particular objection. We estimate (for the Netherlands, the U.S. and the U.K.) how much researchers would receive were they to get an equal share of the government budgets that are currently allocated through competitive peer assessment. For the Netherlands, we furthermore estimate what researchers would receive were we to differentiate between researchers working in low-cost, intermediate-cost and high-cost disciplines. Given these estimates, we then determine what researchers could afford in terms of PhD students, Postdocs, travel and equipment. According to our results, researchers could, on average, maintain current PhD student and Postdoc employment levels, and still have at their disposal a moderate (the U.K.) to considerable (the Netherlands, U.S.) budget for travel and equipment. This suggests that the worry that egalitarian sharing leads to unacceptable dilution of resources is unjustified. Indeed, our results strongly suggest that there is room for far more egalitarian distribution of funds than happens in the highly competitive funding schemes so prevalent today."
https://openalex.org/W2752353038,"Producing indices composed of multiple input variables has been embedded in some data processing and analytical methods. We aim to test the feasibility of creating data-driven indices by aggregating input variables according to principal component analysis (PCA) loadings. To validate the significance of both the theory-based and data-driven indices, we propose principles to review innovative indices. We generated weighted indices with the variables obtained in the first years of the two-year panels in the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey initiated between 1996 and 2011. Variables were weighted according to PCA loadings and summed. The statistical significance and residual deviance of each index to predict mortality in the second years was extracted from the results of discrete-time survival analyses. There were 237,832 surviving the first years of panels, represented 4.5 billion civilians in the United States, of which 0.62% (95% CI = 0.58% to 0.66%) died in the second years of the panels. Of all 134,689 weighted indices, there were 40,803 significantly predicting mortality in the second years with or without the adjustment of age, sex and races. The significant indices in the both models could at most lead to 10,200 years of academic tenure for individual researchers publishing four indices per year or 618.2 years of publishing for journals with annual volume of 66 articles. In conclusion, if aggregating information based on PCA loadings, there can be a large number of significant innovative indices composing input variables of various predictive powers. To justify the large quantities of innovative indices, we propose a reporting and review framework for novel indices based on the objectives to create indices, variable weighting, related outcomes and database characteristics. The indices selected by this framework could lead to a new genre of publications focusing on meaningful aggregation of information."
https://openalex.org/W2752812513,"Brown rats are one of the most widespread urban species worldwide. Despite the nuisances they induce and their potential role as a zoonotic reservoir, knowledge on urban rat populations remains scarce. The main purpose of this study was to characterize an urban brown rat population from Chanteraines park (Hauts-de-Seine, France), with regards to haematology, population genetics, immunogenic diversity, resistance to anticoagulant rodenticides, and community of parasites. Haematological parameters were measured. Population genetics was investigated using 13 unlinked microsatellite loci. Immunogenic diversity was assessed for Mhc-Drb. Frequency of the Y139F mutation (conferring resistance to rodenticides) and two linked microsatellites were studied, concurrently with the presence of anticoagulant residues in the liver. Combination of microscopy and molecular methods were used to investigate the occurrence of 25 parasites. Statistical approaches were used to explore multiple parasite relationships and model parasite occurrence. Eighty-six rats were caught. The first haematological data for a wild urban R. norvegicus population was reported. Genetic results suggested high genetic diversity and connectivity between Chanteraines rats and surrounding population(s). We found a high prevalence (55.8%) of the mutation Y139F and presence of rodenticide residues in 47.7% of the sampled individuals. The parasite species richness was high (16). Seven potential zoonotic pathogens were identified, together with a surprisingly high diversity of Leptospira species (4). Chanteraines rat population is not closed, allowing gene flow and making eradication programs challenging, particularly because rodenticide resistance is highly prevalent. Parasitological results showed that co-infection is more a rule than an exception. Furthermore, the presence of several potential zoonotic pathogens, of which four Leptospira species, in this urban rat population raised its role in the maintenance and spread of these pathogens. Our findings should stimulate future discussions about the development of a long-term rat-control management program in Chanteraines urban park."
https://openalex.org/W2753219523,"Sepsis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, especially at the extremes of age. To understand the human age-specific transcriptomic response to sepsis, a multi-cohort, pooled analysis was conducted on adults, children, infants, and neonates with and without sepsis. Nine public whole-blood gene expression datasets (636 patients) were employed. Age impacted the transcriptomic host response to sepsis. Gene expression from septic neonates and adults was more dissimilar whereas infants and children were more similar. Neonates showed reductions in inflammatory recognition and signaling pathways compared to all other age groups. Likewise, adults demonstrated decreased pathogen sensing, inflammation, and myeloid cell function, as compared to children. This may help to explain the increased incidence of sepsis-related organ failure and death in adults. The number of dysregulated genes in septic patients was proportional to age and significantly differed among septic adults, children, infants, and neonates. Overall, children manifested a greater transcriptomic intensity to sepsis as compared to the other age groups. The transcriptomic magnitude for adults and neonates was dramatically reduced as compared to children and infants. These findings suggest that the transcriptomic response to sepsis is age-dependent, and diagnostic and therapeutic efforts to identify and treat sepsis will have to consider age as an important variable."
https://openalex.org/W2752346774,"Stress plays a role in the exacerbation and possibly the development of functional lower urinary tract disorders. Chronic water avoidance stress (WAS) in rodents is a model with high construct and face validity to bladder hypersensitive syndromes, such as interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS), characterized by urinary frequency and bladder hyperalgesia and heightened stress responsiveness. Given the overlap of the brain circuits involved in stress, anxiety, and micturition, we evaluated the effects chronic stress has on bladder function, as well as its effects on regional brain activation during bladder filling. Female Wistar-Kyoto rats were exposed to WAS (10 days) or sham paradigms. One day thereafter, cystometrograms were obtained during titrated bladder dilation, with visceromotor responses (VMR) recorded simultaneously. Cerebral perfusion was assessed during passive bladder distension (20-cmH2O) following intravenous administration of [14C]-iodoantipyrine. Regional cerebral blood flow was quantified by autoradiography and analyzed in 3-dimensionally reconstructed brains with statistical parametric mapping. WAS animals compared to controls demonstrated a decreased pressure threshold and visceromotor threshold triggering the voiding phase. At 20-cmH2O, VMR was significantly greater in WAS animals compared to controls. WAS animals showed greater activation in cortical regions of the central micturition circuit, including the posterior cingulate, anterior retrosplenial, somatosensory, posterior insula, orbital, and anterior secondary (“supplementary”) motor cortices, as well as in the thalamus, anterior hypothalamus, parabrachial and Barrington nuclei, and striatum. Seed analysis showed increased functional connectivity of WAS compared to control animals of the posterior cingulate cortex to the pontine parabrachial nucleus; of the Barrington nucleus to the anterior dorsal midline and ventrobasilar thalamus and somatosensory and retrosplenial cortices; and of the posterior insula to anterior secondary motor cortex. Our findings show a visceral hypersensitivity during bladder filling in WAS animals, as well as increased engagement of portions of the micturition circuit responsive to urgency, viscerosensory perception and its relay to motor regions coordinating imminent bladder contraction. Results are consistent with recent findings in patients with interstitial cystitis, suggesting that WAS may serve as an animal model to elucidate the mechanisms leading to viscerosensitive brain phenotypes in humans with IC/BPS."
https://openalex.org/W2752458676,"A comparative characterization of the oral mucosa in various animals is needed to identify the best animal model(s) for nonclinical evaluation of sublingual immunotherapy products. With this aim, we studied the histological characteristics and immune cell infiltrates of oral mucosae from common animal species.Three oral regions (i.e. ventral surface of the tongue, mouth floor and cheek) obtained from eight animal species, including rodents (i.e. mice, rats, hamsters, guinea pigs) and non-rodents (i.e. rabbits, dogs, minipigs and monkeys) were characterized by histology and immunohistology in comparison with a human tongue.Rodents exhibit a thin keratinized epithelium with low epithelial extensions, whereas non-rodents, most particularly minipigs and monkeys, display a non-keratinized epithelium with larger rete ridges, similarly to humans. Glycogen-rich cells in the superficial epithelial layers are observed in samples from both minipigs, monkeys and humans. Comparable immune subpopulations detected in the 3 oral regions from rodent and non-rodent species include MHC-II+ antigen presenting cells, mostly CD163+ macrophages, located in the lamina propria (LP) and muscle tissue in the vicinity of resident CD3+CD4+ T cells. Limited numbers of mast cells are also detected in the LP and muscle tissue from all species.The oral mucosae of minipigs and monkeys are closest to that of humans, and the immune networks are quite similar between all rodents and non-rodents. Taking into account the ethical and logistical difficulties of performing research in the latter species, rodents and especially mice, should preferentially be used for pharmacodynamics/efficacy studies. Our data also support the use of minipigs to perform biodistribution and safety studies of sublingual immunotherapy products."
https://openalex.org/W2751968896,"Background In register-based pharmacoepidemiological studies, construction of drug exposure periods from drug purchases is a major methodological challenge. Various methods have been applied but their validity is rarely evaluated. Our objective was to conduct an expert-opinion based evaluation of the correctness of drug use periods produced by different methods. Methods Drug use periods were calculated with three fixed methods: time windows, assumption of one Defined Daily Dose (DDD) per day and one tablet per day, and with PRE2DUP that is based on modelling of individual drug purchasing behavior. Expert-opinion based evaluation was conducted with 200 randomly selected purchase histories of warfarin, bisoprolol, simvastatin, risperidone and mirtazapine in the MEDALZ-2005 cohort (28,093 persons with Alzheimer’s disease). Two experts reviewed purchase histories and judged which methods had joined correct purchases and gave correct duration for each of 1000 drug exposure periods. Results The evaluated correctness of drug use periods was 70–94% for PRE2DUP, and depending on grace periods and time window lengths 0–73% for tablet methods, 0–41% for DDD methods and 0–11% for time window methods. The highest rate of evaluated correct solutions for each method class were observed for 1 tablet per day with 180 days grace period (TAB_1_180, 43–73%), and 1 DDD per day with 180 days grace period (1–41%). Time window methods produced at maximum only 11% correct solutions. The best performing fixed method TAB_1_180 reached highest correctness for simvastatin 73% (95% CI 65–81%) whereas 89% (95% CI 84–94%) of PRE2DUP periods were judged as correct. Conclusions This study shows inaccuracy of fixed methods and the urgent need for new data-driven methods. In the expert-opinion based evaluation, the lowest error rates were observed with data-driven method PRE2DUP."
https://openalex.org/W2753897877,"In food deprivation assays, several different responses have been observed in crustaceans. However, studying energy reserves utilization among more than one species during the same starvation period has not yet been performed, particularly to discern whether the responses are due to intrinsic and/or environmental factors. We hypothesize that decapod species with similar feeding habits have the same strategies in the use of energetic reserves during starvation, even though they inhabit different environments. The aim of this study was to compare the energy reserves mobilization of three decapods species (Cherax quadricarinatus, Palaemon argentinus and Munida gregaria) with similar feeding habits, exposed to similar food deprivation conditions. The crayfish, shrimp and squat-lobster were experimentally kept at continuous feeding or continuous starvation throughout 15 days. Every 3rd day, the midgut gland index (MGI), and the glycogen, lipid and protein contents were measured in the midgut gland (MG) and pleon muscle. Palaemon argentinus mobilized more reserves during starvation, followed by C. quadricarinatus, and the last M. gregaria. The starved shrimps presented low MGI, whereas MG showed a reduction in glycogen (from day 6 to 15), lipid (from day 3 to 15), and protein levels (at day 9 and 15) while in their muscle, lipid reserves decreased at days 3 and 6. In C. quadricarinatus, the most affected parameters in the MG were MGI, glycogen (from day 6 to 15), and lipids (at day 12 and 15). In the MG of M. gregaria only the glycogen was reduced during fasting from 3 to 15 days. Even though the three studied species have similar feeding habitats, we found that their energetic profile utilization is different and it could be explained by the habitat, life span, temperature, organ/tissue, and metabolism of the species. Our results may be useful to understand the several different responses of crustaceans during starvation."
https://openalex.org/W2751511489,"Background Medicinal plants are the basic source of health care in the Pearl Valley District Poonch, Azad Jammu, and Kashmir. The basic aim of present study was to record information about the use of plants in herbal preparation and quantification of recorded data. Materials and methods The research was conducted with the null hypothesis that there was no differential distribution of knowledge among the communities between genders and among different age groups in the study area and across cultural medicinal uses of the plants are similar. To check these hypotheses information about medicinal plants was collected from 46 laypeople and 18 herbalists by using an open ended and semistructured questionnaire. Different ethnobotanical indices were calculated in order to quantify the knowledge on the medicinal plants reported in the study. Results Our study recorded 136 species of medicinal plants belonging to 45 families with Asteraceae (14 species) as the dominant family of the area. Decoction (26 species), juice and powder (24 species each) were most common methods of preparation. Spearman’s correlation analysis showed that age and gender had the significant effect on both numbers of mentioned species and different uses. A number of known medicinal plants and the number of different uses (H: 38.51; p < 0.001) differ significantly as indicated by Kruskal-Wallis tests. These results showed that the knowledge about the plant varies among different age groups, which were the first hypothesis of the present study. The highest use values (UVs) were reported for Berberis lyceum and Ajuga bracteosa (1.13 each) followed by Abies pindrow (1.03). Highest informant consensus factor (ICF) values were recorded for digestive system diseases (ICF = 0.90) and muscular and skeletal system diseases (ICF = 0.89). The value of Jaccarad index ranged from 6.11 to 32.97 with an average value of 19.84, percentage of similarity was highest between study area and Pir Lasura National Park (34.62%). Conclusion High similarity might be due to the fact that the communities living in these areas have same sociocultural values and have more opportunities to exchange their traditional knowledge. The present study provides practical evidence about the use of medicinal plants among the inhabitants of the Pearl Valley."
https://openalex.org/W2751918931,"Reduced knee flexion is a leading feature of post-stroke gait, but the causes have not been well understood. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between the knee flexion and the lower-limb muscle activation within the stance-to-swing phases of gait cycle in the post-stroke hemiplegic patients. Ten stroke patients and 10 age- and gender-matched healthy subjects participated in the experiment. The lower-limb kinematic signals and the surface electromyography (sEMG) signals of the left and right rectus femoris (RF), biceps femoris (BF) and lateral gastrocnemius (GS) were recorded during walking. The angle range (AR) of knee flexion, the root mean square (RMS) and the mean frequency (MNF) of sEMG signals were calculated from the terminal stance (TSt) to the initial swing (ISw) phases of gait cycle. Stroke patients showed lower bilateral AR of knee flexion and lower RMS of GS on the paretic side, but higher MNF of RF on the non-paretic side compared with the controls. Within the stroke patients, significant differences were found between their paretic and non-paretic limbs in the AR of knee flexion, as well as in the RMS and MNF of GS (p < 0.05). Regression analysis showed that the RMS of BF, MNF of BF and MNF of GS explained 82.1% of variations in AR of knee flexion on paretic side (r2 = 0.821). But the RMS and MNF of all the muscles (including the RF, GS and BF) could explain 65.6% of AR of knee flexion variations on the non-paretic side (r2 = 0.656), and 45.2% of variations for the healthy subjects (r2 = 0.452). The reduced knee flexion during gait was associated with altered magnitude and frequency of muscle contractions and with simplified muscle synergy in the post-stroke hemiplegic patients. Identifying the muscles that are responsible for knee stiffness may facilitate improvement of rehabilitation strategy for post-stroke gait."
https://openalex.org/W2752911680,"Public health's terms of engagement with unhealthy commodity industries (alcohol, tobacco and ultra-processed food and drinks) have become increasingly contested in policy and research. We sought to identify approaches that could attract consensus support within and across policy domains.Using snowball sampling, we undertook an online survey of 335 health researchers, advocates and policymakers, in 40 countries, assessing responses to stated principles, claims and recommendations for engaging with unhealthy commodity industries in relation to key policy and research initiatives.Most respondents identified a fundamental conflict between industry interests and public health objectives for all three industries, with agreement greatest in relation to tobacco and weakest for food. This pattern was replicated across diverse questions regarding potential forms of engagement, including in rejecting voluntarism and partnership approaches to health policy. While awareness of tobacco industry tactics to influence policy and research was higher than for alcohol and food, most respondents rejected the view that the influence of the latter was less significant for public health. Proposals that health and research organisations should divest their funds attracted less support with respect to food, while restricting publication of industry-funded research in academic journals was the issue that most divided opinion. Respondents reported most difficulty in answering questions about the food industry.The strong consensus around restricting interactions with the tobacco industry supports increased implementation of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control's conflict of interest provisions. There is strong support for the extension of such practices to the alcohol industry, challenging current norms. More mixed responses indicate a need for greater clarity in defining the food industry, and for research analyzing links, similarities and differences across different types of unhealthy commodity producers. Partnership approaches to addressing non-communicable diseases seem incapable of attracting widespread support across public health, challenging practice in many contexts."
https://openalex.org/W2753083403,"Orexins are hypothalamic neuropeptides that regulate feeding, reward, wakefulness and energy homeostasis. The present study sought to characterize the involvement of orexin A in glucose metabolism in HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells, and investigated the role of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) in the response. HepG2 cells were exposed to different concentrations of orexin A (10−9 to 10−7 M) in vitro, without or with the orexin receptor 1 (OX1R) inhibitor (SB334867), HIF-1α inhibitor (YC-1) or a combination of both inhibitors. Subsequently, OX1R, HIF-1α expression and localization, glucose uptake, glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) expression and ATP content were measured. We further investigated the intracellular fate of glucose by measuring the gene expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1), lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA) and pyruvate dehydrogenase B (PDHB), as well as metabolite levels including lactate generation and mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity. The activity of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway was also assessed. Our results showed that the expression of OX1R was predominantly located in the nucleus in HepG2 cells. Orexin A oxygen-independently promoted the mRNA and protein expression of HIF-1α as well as its nuclear accumulation in HepG2 cells and the elevated HIF-1α protein was associated, at least partly, with the activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Orexin A stimulated GLUT1 expression, glucose uptake as well as ATP generation in HepG2 cells via OX1R acting through the HIF-1α pathway. Moreover, orexin A inhibited LDHA, PDK1 expression and lactate production, stimulated PDHB expression and PDH enzyme activity independent of HIF-1α. Our results indicated that orexin signaling facilitated the glucose flux into mitochondrial oxidative metabolism rather than glycolysis in HepG2 cells. These findings provide new insight into the regulation of glucose metabolism by orexin A in hepatocellular carcinoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W2750599945,"Background Indigenous populations globally are disproportionately affected by chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection however contemporary sero-prevalence data are often absent. In the Indigenous population of the Northern Territory (NT) of Australia the unique C4 sub-genotype of HBV universally circulates. There are no studies of the sero-prevalence, nor the impact of the vaccination program (which has a serotype mismatch compared to C4), at a population-wide level. Methods We examined all available HBV serology results obtained from the three main laboratories serving NT residents between 1991 and 2011. Data were linked with a NT government database to determine Indigenous status and the most recent test results for each individual were extracted as a cross-sectional database including 88,112 unique individuals. The primary aim was to obtain a contemporary estimate of HBsAg positivity for the NT by Indigenous status. Results Based on all tests from 2007–2011 (35,633 individuals), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positivity was 3·40% (95%CI 3·19–3·61), being higher in Indigenous (6·08%[5·65%-6·53%]) than non-Indigenous (1·56%[1·38%-1·76%]) Australians, p<0·0001. Birth cohort analysis showed HBsAg positivity fell over time for Indigenous people, with this decrease commencing prior to universal infant vaccination (which commenced in 1990), with an ongoing but slower rate of decline since 1990, (0·23% decrease per year versus 0·17%). Conclusions HBsAg positivity is high in the NT, particularly in the Indigenous population. HBsAg positivity has fallen over time but a substantial part of this decrease is due to factors other than the universal vaccination program."
https://openalex.org/W2750747133,"The Caulobacter crescentus cell extension known as a stalk represents an unusual bacterial morphology. C. crescentus produces stalks under multiple nutrient conditions, but the length of the stalk is increased in response to phosphate starvation. However, the exact function of the stalk is not known, nor is it known how much stalk biogenesis or function is conserved with other stalked bacteria. Work presented here shows that many organisms in the Caulobacter genus and the next closest genus (Brevundimonas) generally do not synthesize stalks in the relatively-rich PYE growth medium, suggesting that the synthesis of a stalk under nutrient-rich conditions by C. crescentus may be the exception instead of the norm among its phylogenetic group. Brevundimonas subvibrioides can be induced to synthesize stalks by genetically mimicking phosphate starvation conditions, indicating stalk synthesis in this organism may be performed on an as-need basis. This mutation, however, does not appear to increase the incidence of holdfast synthesis. While B. subvibrioides stalks appear to be synthesized with the same polarity with respect to holdfast as C. crescentus stalks, evidence is presented that suggests B. subvibrioides may disassemble stalks when they are no longer needed. Many homologs of C. crescentus genes encoding stalk-associated proteins are absent in the B. subvibrioides genome, and B. subvibrioides PstA-GFP as well as C. crescentus StpX-GFP are able to enter the B. subvibrioides stalk compartment, calling into question the level of compartmentalization of the B. subvibrioides stalk. In summary, this work begins to address how much the C. crescentus model for this unusual morphological adaptation can be extended to related organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2751518012,"Background Secondary prevention after acute coronary syndrome (ACS) could reduce morbidity and mortality, but guideline targets are seldom reached. We hypothesized that nurse-led telephone-based intervention would increase adherence. Methods The NAILED ACS trial is a prospective, controlled, randomized trial. Patients admitted for ACS at Östersund hospital, Sweden, were randomized to usual follow-up by a general practitioner or a nurse-led intervention. The intervention comprised telephone follow-up after 1 month and then yearly with lifestyle counselling and titration of medications until reaching target values for LDL-C (<2.5 mmol/L) and blood pressure (BP; <140/90 mmHg) or set targets were deemed unachievable. This is a 12-month exploratory analysis of the intervention. Results A total of 768 patients (396 intervention, 372 control) completed the 12-month follow-up. After titration at the 1-month follow-up, mean LDL-C was 0.38 mmol/L (95% CI 0.28 to 0.48, p<0.05), mean systolic BP 7 mmHg (95% CI 4.5 to 9.2, p<0.05), and mean diastolic BP 4 mmHg (95% CI 2.4 to 4.1, p<0.05) lower in the intervention group. Target values for LDL-C and systolic BP were met by 94.1% and 91.9% of intervention patients and 68.4% and 65.6% of controls (p<0.05). At 12 months, mean LDL was 0.3 mmol/L (95% CI 0.1 to 0.4, p <0.05), systolic BP 1.5 mmHg (95% CI -1.0 to 4.1, p = 0.24), and mean diastolic BP 2.1 mmHg (95% CI 0.6 to 3.6, p <0.05) lower in the intervention group. Target values for LDL-C and systolic BP were met in 77.7% and 68.9% of intervention patients and 63.2% and 63.7% of controls (p<0.05 and p = 0.125). Conclusion Nurse-led telephone-based secondary prevention was significantly more efficient at improving LDL-C and diastolic BP levels than usual care. The effect of the intervention declined between 1 and 12 months. Further evaluation of the persistence to the intervention is needed."
https://openalex.org/W2751176223,"The integration of food production and biodiversity conservation represents a key challenge for sustainability. Several studies suggest that even small structural elements in the landscape can make a substantial contribution to the overall biodiversity value of the agricultural landscapes. Pastures can have high biodiversity potential. However, their intensive and monofunctional use typically erodes its natural capital, including biodiversity. Here we address the ecological value of fine scale structural elements represented by sparsely scattered trees and shrubs for the spider communities in a moderately intensively grazed pasture in Transylvania, Eastern Europe. The pasture was grazed with sheep, cattle and buffalo (ca 1 Livestock Unit ha-1) and no chemical fertilizers were applied. Sampling sites covered the open pasture as well as the existing fine-scale heterogeneity created by scattered trees and shrub. 40 sampling locations each being represented by three 1 m2 quadrats were situated in a stratified design while assuring spatial independency of sampling locations. We identified 140 species of spiders, out of which 18 were red listed and four were new for the Romanian fauna. Spider species assemblages of open pasture, scattered trees, trees and shrubs and the forest edge were statistically distinct. Our study shows that sparsely scattered mature woody vegetation and shrubs substantially increases the ecological value of managed pastures. The structural complexity provided by scattered trees and shrubs makes possible the co-occurrence of high spider diversity with a moderately high intensity grazing possible in this wood-pasture. Our results are in line with recent empirical research showing that sparse trees and shrubs increases the biodiversity potential of pastures managed for commodity production."
https://openalex.org/W2751629240,"Aimed at providing a contribution to the optimization of cryopreservation processes, the present work focuses on the osmotic behavior of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). Once isolated from the umbilical cord blood (UCB) of three different donors, hMSCs were characterized in terms of size distribution and their osmotic properties suitably evaluated through the exposure to hypertonic and isotonic aqueous solutions at three different temperatures. More specifically, inactive cell volume and cell permeability to water and di-methyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were measured, being cell size determined using impedance measurements under both equilibrium and dynamic conditions. Experimental findings indicate that positive cell volume excursions are limited by the apparent increase of inactive volume, which occurs during both the shrink-swell process following DMSO addition and the subsequent restoration of isotonic conditions in the presence of hypertonic solutions of impermeant or permeant solutes. Based on this evidence, hMSCs must be regarded as imperfect osmometers, and their osmotic behavior described within a scenario no longer compatible with the simple two-parameter model usually utilized in the literature. In this respect, the activation of mechano-sensitive ion-channels seemingly represents a reasonable hypothesis for rationalizing the observed osmotic behavior of hMSCs from UCB."
https://openalex.org/W2750730751,"Background We aimed to identify the risk factors associated with colonic cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in ulcerative colitis (UC) and to compare the clinical course between antiviral therapy-treated and -untreated groups in mucosal CMV-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -positive cases. Methods We retrospectively selected 46 UC patients (>15 years old) in active phase who underwent colonoscopy with biopsy and were analyzed for CMV infection by mucosal PCR between October 2011 and December 2015 at our institution. Colonic CMV in inflamed mucosa was detected using quantitative real-time PCR. The clinical course was evaluated, including need for drug therapy/surgery or drug therapy intensification. In addition, we evaluated the clinical course between CMV-DNA− cases and CMV-DNA+ cases with low viral load. Results At baseline, CMV-DNA+ patients were significantly older, had higher endoscopic scores, and required higher corticosteroid doses during the past 4 weeks than CMV-DNA− patients (p< 0.05). No significant differences were observed in disease duration, disease distribution, laboratory data, or use of other medication between CMV-DNA+ and CMV-DNA− patients. In the anti-CMV-treated group with a median (range) DNA load of 16,000 (9,000–36,400), 3patients achieved remission without additional UC therapy, 2 required additional UC therapy, and 1 required colectomy despite azathioprine and infliximab therapy. In the CMV-untreated group with a median (range) DNA load of 919 (157–5,480), all patients achieved remission with UC therapy alone. No significant difference was observed in the clinical course between CMV-DNA− cases and CMV-DNA+ cases with low viral loads. Conclusions Aging, endoscopic UC activity, and corticosteroid dose predispose to colonic CMV infection, as determined by mucosal PCR, in UC. UC treatment without anti-CMV therapy may be warranted, particularly in patients with low-load CMV-DNA. Anti-CMV therapy alone does not always achieve clinical response in UC even in cases with high-load PCR."
https://openalex.org/W2753686741,"Purpose To assess the tear film and meibomian gland (MG) features in a Norwegian cohort of patients with primary Sjögren´s syndrome (pSS) and in age- and gender-matched control subjects. Methods Thirty-four female patients with pSS (age 52.9±11.9 years) and 32 female control subjects (age 49.0±11.5 years) were recruited. After completion of Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire and McMonnies Dry Eye Questionaire, participants underwent measurements of tear osmolarity, tear break-up time (TBUT), ocular surface and corneal staining, Schirmer I test, corneal sensitivity, MG expressibility evaluations, and lid margin morphology examination using slitlamp microscopy. Non-contact infrared meibography images were assessed by computer-assisted analysis. The MG loss, calculated as (tarsal area-MG area)/tarsal area, was evaluated in both upper (UL) and lower lids (LL). Results Compared to the control group, pSS patients demonstrated higher MG loss in both UL (33.8±13.2% vs. 24.4±8.5%, p< 0.01) and LL (52.5±15.7% vs. 43.0±9.6%, p<0.05), as well as higher lid abnormality score (0.8±0.8 vs. 0.2±0.6, p< 0.01). Furthermore, pSS patients showed higher OSDI and McMonnies questionnaire scores, elevated osmolarity, shorter TBUT, shorter blink interval, less wetting in Schirmer I test, more ocular surface staining and more corneal staining. MG loss in UL correlated negatively with TBUT (r = -0.386, p = 0.029) in the pSS group, whereas MG loss in LL correlated negatively with TBUT (r = -0.380, p = 0.035) in the control group. Conclusions Significantly elevated dry eye symptoms and signs were found in the pSS group compared with the control group, which might be attributed to both decreased aqueous tear production and increased tear evaporation."

The eyes were divided into two groups: (1) DE group with DE symptoms and BUT ≤ 5 s and (2) non-DE group without DE symptoms and BUT > 5 s. We excluded eyes with Schirmer score ≤ 5 mm and positive keratoconjunctival epithelial damage. Tear evaluation, AMF, and functional visual acuity (VA) examinations were performed. AMF parameters included total high-frequency component (HFC), HFC with low accommodation for the task of staring into the distance (HFC1), and HFC with high accommodation for deskwork (HFC2). Functional VA parameters included starting VA, functional VA, visual maintenance ratio, and blink frequency.A total of 33 and 34 eyes were categorized in the DE and non-DE groups, respectively. Mean blink frequency and HFC1 values were significantly higher in the DE group than they were in the non-DE group.DEs with symptoms showed abnormal AMF and visual function, which may be associated with DE symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W2753118839,"Recently, there is ample evidence suggesting the important role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in autoimmune diseases via modulating B cells function. Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a progressive immune-mediated liver disease with unclear pathogenic mechanism. Whether the miRNA in peripheral B cells of PBC involve the mechanisms of pathology and progression is not known. The present study explores miRNA deregulation in peripheral B-cell of PBC from stage I to IV and healthy controls. Peripheral B cells were obtained from 72 PBC patients (stage I, n = 17; stage II, n = 23; stage III, n = 16; stage IV, n = 16) and 15 healthy controls. Initially, in a discovery study, miRNA array analysis was performed, subsequently, in a validation study, quantitative PCR was used to investigate miRNA expression profile in B cells of PBS patients compared to healthy controls. Based on bioinformatics analysis, we identified the potential biological processes and significant signaling pathways affected by these microRNAs, and generated the microRNA–gene network. The discovery study identified 558 miRNAs differentially expressed in B cells of PBC patients compared to controls. Interestingly, among all differentially expressed miRNAs, hsa-miR-223-3p and hsa-miR-21-5p were the only miRNAs that showed consistent and significant down-regulation from stage I to stage III of PBC. Bioinformatics showed that potential target genes of both miRNAs involved in migration, cell differentiation, apoptosis, and signal transduction pathways. In conclusion, our results suggest that the expression profiles of miRNA in peripheral B cells of PBC patients are closely associated with the disease progression, especially the down-regulation of hsa-miR-223-3p and hsa-miR-21-5p. Taken together, our study offers novel perspectives on the role of miRNAs in PBC pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2751549482,"The purpose of this study was to explore the relationships among employees' usage intention pertaining to mobile information devices, focusing on subjective judgement, technology acceptance tendency, information sharing behavior and information transfer. A research model was established to verify several hypotheses. The research model based on integrated concepts of knowledge management and technology acceptance modeling. Participants were employees of enterprises in Taiwan, selected by combining snowball and convenience sampling. Data obtained from 779 e-surveys. Multiple-regression analysis was employed for hypothesis verification. The results indicate that perceived ease-of-use of mobile devices was affected by computer self-efficacy and computer playfulness directly; meanwhile, perceived ease-of-use directly affects perceived usefulness. In addition, perceived ease-of-use and perceived usefulness can predict information-sharing behavior in a positive manner, and impact knowledge transfer as well. Based on the research findings, it suggested that enterprises should utilize mobile information devices to create more contact with customers and enrich their service network. In addition, it is recommended that managers use mobile devices to transmit key information to their staff and that they use these devices for problem-solving and decision-making. Further, the staff’s skills pertaining to the operation of mobile information devices and to fully implement their features are reinforced in order to inspire the users' knowledge transfer. Enhancing the playfulness of the interface is also important. In general, it is useful to promote knowledge transfer behavior within an organization by motivating members to share information and ideas via mobile information devices. In addition, a well-designed interface can facilitate employees' use of these devices."
https://openalex.org/W2752634141,"Ecological niche models (ENMs) have increasingly been used to estimate the potential effects of climate change on species’ distributions worldwide. Recently, predictions of species abundance have also been obtained with such models, though knowledge about the climatic variables affecting species abundance is often lacking. To address this, we used a well-studied guild (temperate North American quail) and the Maxent modeling algorithm to compare model performance of three variable selection approaches: correlation/variable contribution (CVC), biological (i.e., variables known to affect species abundance), and random. We then applied the best approach to forecast potential distributions, under future climatic conditions, and analyze future potential distributions in light of available abundance data and presence-only occurrence data. To estimate species’ distributional shifts we generated ensemble forecasts using four global circulation models, four representative concentration pathways, and two time periods (2050 and 2070). Furthermore, we present distributional shifts where 75%, 90%, and 100% of our ensemble models agreed. The CVC variable selection approach outperformed our biological approach for four of the six species. Model projections indicated species-specific effects of climate change on future distributions of temperate North American quail. The Gambel’s quail (Callipepla gambelii) was the only species predicted to gain area in climatic suitability across all three scenarios of ensemble model agreement. Conversely, the scaled quail (Callipepla squamata) was the only species predicted to lose area in climatic suitability across all three scenarios of ensemble model agreement. Our models projected future loss of areas for the northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) and scaled quail in portions of their distributions which are currently areas of high abundance. Climatic variables that influence local abundance may not always scale up to influence species’ distributions. Special attention should be given to selecting variables for ENMs, and tests of model performance should be used to validate the choice of variables."
https://openalex.org/W2751846858,"Introduction Haloperidol has been extensively used in various psychiatric conditions. It has also been reported to induce severe side effects. We aimed to evaluate whether haloperidol can influence host methylome, and if so what are the possible mechanisms for it in neuronal cells. Impact on host methylome and miRNAs can have wide spread alterations in gene expression, which might possibly help in understanding how haloperidol may impact treatment response or induce side effects. Methods SK-N-SH, a neuroblasoma cell line was treated with haloperidol at 10μm concentration for 24 hours and global DNA methylation was evaluated. Methylation at global level is maintained by methylation maintenance machinery and certain miRNAs. Therefore, the expression of methylation maintenance genes and their putative miRNA expression profiles were assessed. These global methylation alterations could result in gene expression changes. Therefore genes expressions for neurotransmitter receptors, regulators, ion channels and transporters were determined. Subsequently, we were also keen to identify a strong candidate miRNA based on biological and in-silico approach which can reflect on the pharmacoepigenetic trait of haloperidol and can also target the altered neuroscience panel of genes used in the study. Results Haloperidol induced increase in global DNA methylation which was found to be associated with corresponding increase in expression of various epigenetic modifiers that include DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B and MBD2. The expression of miR-29b that is known to putatively regulate the global methylation by modulating the expression of epigenetic modifiers was observed to be down regulated by haloperidol. In addition to miR-29b, miR-22 was also found to be downregulated by haloperidol treatment. Both these miRNA are known to putatively target several genes associated with various epigenetic modifiers, pharmacogenes and neurotransmission. Interestingly some of these putative target genes involved in neurotransmission were observed to be upregulated while CHRM2 gene expression was down regulated. Conclusions Haloperidol can influence methylation traits thereby inducing a pharmacoepigenomic response, which seems to be regulated by DNMTs and their putative miRNA expression. Increased methylation seems to influence CHRM2 gene expression while microRNA could influence neurotransmission, pharmacogene expression and methylation events. Altered expression of various therapeutically relevant genes and miRNA expression, could account for their role in therapeutic response or side effects."
https://openalex.org/W2752193047,"Hepatitis C is a liver disease caused by infection of the Hepatitis C virus (HCV). Many individuals infected by the virus are unable to resolve the viral infection and develop chronic hepatitis, which can lead to formation of liver cirrhosis and cancer. To understand better how initial HCV infections progress to chronic liver diseases, we characterised the long term pathogenic effects of HCV infections with the use of a humanised mouse model (HIL mice) we have previously established. Although HCV RNA could be detected in infected mice up to 9 weeks post infection, HCV infected mice developed increased incidences of liver fibrosis, granulomatous inflammation and tumour formation in the form of hepatocellular adenomas or hepatocellular carcinomas by 28 weeks post infection compared to uninfected mice. We also demonstrated that chronic liver inflammation in HCV infected mice was mediated by the human immune system, particularly by monocytes/macrophages and T cells which exhibited exhaustion phenotypes. In conclusion, HIL mice can recapitulate some of the clinical symptoms such as chronic inflammation, immune cell exhaustion and tumorigenesis seen in HCV patients. Our findings also suggest that persistence of HCV-associated liver disease appear to require initial infections of HCV and immune responses but not long term HCV viraemia."
https://openalex.org/W2750752000,"Background Approximately 2.6 million children live with HIV globally, and efavirenz (EFV) is one of the most widely used antiretroviral agents for HIV treatment in children and adults. There are concerns about the appropriateness of current EFV dosing and it has been discussed whether EFV dosing should be adapted according to genotype in children as suggested for adults. Aim To investigate if pediatric EFV dosing should be guided by genetic variation in drug metabolizing enzymes rather than by body weight. Method EFV plasma concentrations measured for clinical purposes from all children less than 18 years old at Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden, treated with EFV were collected retrospectively. They were genotyped for eleven polymorphisms in genes coding for drug-metabolizing enzymes and P-glycoprotein, of potential importance for EFV disposition. Data on country of origin, sex, age, weight, HIV RNA, viral resistance patterns, CD4 cells, adherence to treatment, subjective health status and adverse events were collected from their medical records. Results Thirty-six patients and 182 (mean 5 samples/patient) EFV plasma concentration measurements from children of African, Asian and Latin American origin were included. EFV plasma concentration varied 21-fold between measurements (n = 182) (0.85–19.3 mg/L) and 9-fold measured as mean EFV plasma concentration across the subjects (1.55–13.4 mg/L). A multivariate mixed-effects restricted maximum likelihood regression model, including multiple gene polymorphisms, identified CYP2B6*6 T/T (p < 0.0005), CYP2B6*11 G/G (p < 0.0005), CYP2A6*9 A/C (p = 0.001) genotypes, age at treatment initiation (p = 0.002) and time from treatment initiation (p < 0.0005) as independent factors significantly related to loge concentration/(dose/weight). The contribution of the model to the intra- and interindividual variation were 6 and 75%, respectively (Bryk/Raudenbush R-squared level). Conclusion Genetic polymorphisms in CYP2B6 and CYP2A6 explained a significant proportion of variability in EFV plasma concentration in HIV-infected children in a multi-ethnic outpatient clinic. Knowledge about individual variants in key drug metabolizing enzyme genes could improve clinical safety and genotype directed dosing could achieve more predictable EFV plasma concentrations in HIV-infected children."

Here we performed a microRNA microarray to identify the molecular causes of this cardiac phenotype that revealed the dysregulation of several microRNAs including miR-301a, which was highly downregulated in Cs1-ko mice compared to the wild-type littermates. Cofilin-2 (Cfl2) was identified as one of the potential targets of miR-301a using prediction databases, which we validated by luciferase assay and mutation of predicted binding sites. Furthermore, expression of miR-301a contrastingly regulated Cfl2 expression levels in neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes (NRVCM). Along these lines, Cfl2 was significantly upregulated in Cs1-ko mice, indicating the physiological association between miR-301a and Cfl2 in vivo. Mechanistically, we found that Cfl2 activated serum response factor response element (SRF-RE) driven luciferase activity in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and in C2C12 cells. Similarly, knockdown of miR301a activated, whereas, its overexpression inhibited the SRF-RE driven luciferase activity, further strengthening physiological interaction between miR-301a and Cfl2. Interestingly, the expression of SRF and its target genes was strikingly increased in Cs1-ko suggesting a possible in vivo correlation between expression levels of Cfl2/miR-301a and SRF activation, which needs to be independently validated. In summary, our data demonstrates that miR-301a regulates Cofilin-2 in vitro in NRVCM, and in vivo in Cs1-ko mice. Our findings provide an additional and important layer of Cfl2 regulation, which we believe has an extended role in cardiac signal transduction and dilated cardiomyopathy presumably due to the reported involvement of Cfl2 in these mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2751413571,"Eyes with polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) were recently reported to have various choroidal thickness, and choroidal thickness might be associated with visual outcome in the treatment of many retinal disorders. The range of subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT), clinical features, and 3-month treatment response among three groups having different range of SFCT were investigated in PCV eyes. In 78 treatment-naïve eyes with PCV, SFCT was measured using optical coherence tomography. Eyes were classified into thin, medium, and thick groups, using mean and one standard deviation of SFCT. Clinical features and imaging findings were compared among the three groups. Some eyes were treated with three consecutive monthly injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as an initial treatment. They were also classified into three thickness groups, and the short-term post-treatment improvement in visual acuity and central retinal thickness were compared among groups. The mean SFCT was 271.9 ± 135.6 μm. Twelve, 53, and 13 eyes were classified into thin (<136.3 μm), medium (136.3-407.5 μm), and thick (>407.5 μm) groups, respectively. The thin group showed older age, lower visual acuity, and a higher prevalence of fundus tessellation than the other two groups (P <0.05). In multiple linear regression analyses, baseline BCVA was correlated with baseline SFCT. Forty-six eyes completed three consecutive anti-VEGF treatments. The thin group showed no visual improvement after treatment (P = 0.141), unlike the other two groups showing visual improvement (P<0.05). Eyes with PCV have a broad range of SFCT, and PCV eyes with a thin choroid manifest worse visual function than eyes with a medium or thick choroid."
https://openalex.org/W2751538554,"Purpose To compare the concordance in risk classification between the EndoPredict and the MammaPrint scores obtained for the same cancer samples on 40 estrogen-receptor positive/HER2-negative breast carcinomas. Methods Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded invasive breast carcinoma tissues that were previously analyzed with MammaPrint as part of routine care of the patients, and were classified as high-risk (20 patients) and low-risk (20 patients), were selected to be analyzed by the EndoPredict assay, a second generation gene expression test that combines expression of 8 genes (EP score) with two clinicopathological variables (tumor size and nodal status, EPclin score). Results The EP score classified 15 patients as low-risk and 25 patients as high-risk. EPclin re-classified 5 of the 25 EP high-risk patients into low-risk, resulting in a total of 20 high-risk and 20 low-risk tumors. EP score and MammaPrint score were significantly correlated (p = 0.008). Twelve of 20 samples classified as low-risk by MammaPrint were also low-risk by EP score (60%). 17 of 20 MammaPrint high-risk tumors were also high-risk by EP score. The overall concordance between EP score and MammaPrint was 72.5% (κ = 0.45, (95% CI, 0.182 to 0.718)). EPclin score also correlated with MammaPrint results (p = 0.004). Discrepancies between both tests occurred in 10 cases: 5 MammaPrint low-risk patients were classified as EPclin high-risk and 5 high-risk MammaPrint were classified as low-risk by EPclin and overall concordance of 75% (κ = 0.5, (95% CI, 0.232 to 0.768)). Conclusions This pilot study demonstrates a limited concordance between MammaPrint and EndoPredict. Differences in results could be explained by the inclusion of different gene sets in each platform, the use of different methodology, and the inclusion of clinicopathological parameters, such as tumor size and nodal status, in the EndoPredict test."
https://openalex.org/W2752959756,"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a well-established treatment for patients with severe aortic valve stenosis. This procedure requires pre-operative planning by assessment of aortic dimensions on CT Angiography (CTA). It is well-known that the aortic root dimensions vary over the heart cycle. However, sizing is commonly performed at either mid-systole or end-diastole only, which has resulted in an inadequate understanding of its full dynamic behavior.We studied the variation in annulus measurements during the cardiac cycle and determined if this variation is dependent on the amount of calcification at the annulus.We measured and compared aortic root annular dimensions and calcium volume in CTA acquisitions at 10 cardiac cycle phases in 51 aortic stenosis patients. Sub-group analysis was performed based on the volume of calcium by splitting the population into mildly and severely calcified valves subgroups.For most annulus measurements, the largest differences were found between 10% and 70 to 80% cardiac cycle phases. Mean difference (±standard deviation) in annular minimum diameter, maximum diameter, area, and aspect ratio between mid-systole and end-diastole phases were 1.0 ± 0.29 mm (p = 0.065), 0.30 ± 0.24 mm (p = 0.7), 24.1 ± 7.6 mm2 (p < 0.001), and 0.041 ± 0.012 (p = 0.039) respectively. Calcium volume measurements varied strongly during the cardiac cycle. The dynamic annulus area was behaving differently between mildly and severely calcified subgroups (p = 0.02). Furthermore, patients with severe aortic calcification were associated with larger annulus diameters.There is a significant variation of annulus area and calcium volume measurement during the cardiac cycle. In our measurements, only the dynamic variation of the annulus area is dependent on the severity of the aortic calcification. For TAVI candidates, the annulus area is significantly larger in mid-systole compared to end-diastole."
https://openalex.org/W2752988067,"Assessment methods in human locomotion often involve the description of normalised graphical profiles and/or the extraction of discrete variables. Whilst useful, these approaches may not represent the full complexity of gait data. Multivariate statistical methods, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA), have been adopted since they have the potential to overcome these data handling issues. The aim of the current study was to develop and optimise a specific machine learning algorithm for processing human locomotion data. Twenty participants ran at a self-selected speed across a 15m runway in barefoot and shod conditions. Ground reaction forces (BW) and kinematics were measured at 1000 Hz and 100 Hz, respectively from which joint angles (°), joint moments (N.m.kg-1) and joint powers (W.kg-1) for the hip, knee and ankle joints were calculated in all three anatomical planes. Using PCA and DFA, power spectra of the kinematic and kinetic variables were used as a training database for the development of a machine learning algorithm. All possible combinations of 10 out of 20 participants were explored to find the iteration of individuals that would optimise the machine learning algorithm. The results showed that the algorithm was able to successfully predict whether a participant ran shod or barefoot in 93.5% of cases. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to optimise the development of a machine learning algorithm."
https://openalex.org/W2753049169,"We previously reported a 84-Kb hemi-deletion copy number variant at the SLC1A1 gene locus that reduces its expression and appeared causally linked to schizophrenia. In this report, we characterize the in vivo and in vitro consequences of reduced expression of Slc1a1 in mice. Heterozygous (HET) Slc1a1+/- mice, which more closely model the hemi-deletion we found in human subjects, were examined in a series of behavioral, anatomical and biochemical assays. Knockout (KO) mice were also included in the behavioral studies for comparative purposes. Both HET and KO mice exhibited evidence of increased anxiety-like behavior, impaired working memory, decreased exploratory activity and impaired sensorimotor gating, but no changes in overall locomotor activity. The magnitude of changes was approximately equivalent in the HET and KO mice suggesting a dominant effect of the haploinsufficiency. Behavioral changes in the HET mice were accompanied by reduced thickness of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. Whole transcriptome RNA-Seq analysis detected expression changes of genes and pathways involved in cytokine signaling and synaptic functions in both brain and blood. Moreover, the brains of Slc1a1+/- mice displayed elevated levels of oxidized glutathione, a trend for increased oxidative DNA damage, and significantly increased levels of cytokines. This latter finding was further supported by SLC1A1 knockdown and overexpression studies in differentiated human neuroblastoma cells, which led to decreased or increased cytokine expression, respectively. Taken together, our results suggest that partial loss of the Slc1a1 gene in mice causes haploinsufficiency associated with behavioral, histological and biochemical changes that reflect an altered redox state and may promote the expression of behavioral features and inflammatory states consistent with those observed in schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W2752917247,"Introduction 
Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) is an innate immune system DNA-receptor that regulates tumor invasion and immunity in vitro. Low tumor TLR9 expression has been associated with poor survival in Caucasian patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). African American (AA) patients with TNBC have worse prognosis than Caucasians but whether this is due to differences in tumor biology remains controversial. We studied the prognostic significance of tumor Toll like receptor-9 (TLR9) protein expression among African American (AA) triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients. Germline TLR9 variants in European Americans (EAs) and AAs were investigated, to determine their contribution to AA breast cancer risk.


Methods 
TLR9 expression was studied with immunohistochemistry in archival tumors. Exome Variant Server and The Cancer Genome Atlas were used to determine the genetic variation in the general EA and AA populations, and AA breast cancer cases. Minor allele frequencies (MAFs) were compared between EAs (n = 4300), AAs (n = 2203), and/or AA breast cancer cases (n = 131).


Results 
Thirty-two TLR9 variants had a statistically significant MAF difference between general EAs and AAs. Twenty-one of them affect a CpG site. Rs352140, a variant previously associated with protection from breast cancer, is more common in EAs than AAs (p = 2.20E-16). EAs had more synonymous alleles, while AAs had more rare coding alleles. Similar analyses comparing AA breast cancer cases with AA controls did not reveal any variant class differences; however, three previously unreported TLR9 variants were associated with late onset breast cancer. Although not statistically significant, rs352140 was observed less frequently in AA cases compared to controls. Tumor TLR9 protein expression was not associated with prognosis.


Conclusions 
Tumor TLR9 expression is not associated with prognosis in AA TNBC. Significant differences were detected in TLR9 variant MAFs between EAs and AAs. They may affect TLR9 expression and function. Rs352140, which may protect from breast cancer, is 1.6 X more common among EAs. These findings call for a detailed analysis of the contribution of TLR9 to breast cancer pathophysiology and health disparities."
https://openalex.org/W2753530550,"Over the last decade, a large number of nucleotide sequences have been generated by next-generation sequencing technologies and deposited to public databases. However, most of these datasets do not specify the sex of individuals sampled because researchers typically ignore or hide this information. Male and female genomes in many species have distinctive sex chromosomes, XX/XY and ZW/ZZ, and expression levels of many sex-related genes differ between the sexes. Herein, we describe how to develop sex marker sequences from syntenic regions of sex chromosomes and use them to quickly identify the sex of individuals being analyzed. Array-based technologies routinely use either known sex markers or the B-allele frequency of X or Z chromosomes to deduce the sex of an individual. The same strategy has been used with whole-exome/genome sequence data; however, all reads must be aligned onto a reference genome to determine the B-allele frequency of the X or Z chromosomes. SEXCMD is a pipeline that can extract sex marker sequences from reference sex chromosomes and rapidly identify the sex of individuals from whole-exome/genome and RNA sequencing after training with a known dataset through a simple machine learning approach. The pipeline counts total numbers of hits from sex-specific marker sequences and identifies the sex of the individuals sampled based on the fact that XX/ZZ samples do not have Y or W chromosome hits. We have successfully validated our pipeline with mammalian (Homo sapiens; XY) and avian (Gallus gallus; ZW) genomes. Typical calculation time when applying SEXCMD to human whole-exome or RNA sequencing datasets is a few minutes, and analyzing human whole-genome datasets takes about 10 minutes. Another important application of SEXCMD is as a quality control measure to avoid mixing samples before bioinformatics analysis. SEXCMD comprises simple Python and R scripts and is freely available at https://github.com/lovemun/SEXCMD."
https://openalex.org/W2751108297,"Tripartite efflux pumps are among the main actors responsible for antibiotics resistance in Gram-negative bacteria. In the last two decades, structural studies gave crucial information about the assembly interfaces and the mechanistic motions. Thus rigidifying the assembly seems to be an interesting way to hamper the drug efflux. In this context, xenon is a suitable probe for checking whether small ligands could act as conformational lockers by targeting hydrophobic cavities. Here we focus on OprN, the outer membrane channel of the MexEF efflux pump from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. After exposing OprN crystals to xenon gas pressure, 14 binding sites were observed using X-ray crystallography. These binding sites were unambiguously characterized in hydrophobic cavities of OprN. The major site is observed in the sensitive iris-like region gating the channel at the periplasmic side, built by the three key-residues Leu 405, Asp 109, and Arg 412. This arrangement defines along the tunnel axis a strong hydrophobic/polar gradient able to enhance the passive efflux mechanism of OprN. The other xenon atoms reveal strategic hydrophobic regions of the channel scaffold to target, with the aim to freeze the dynamic movements responsible of the open/close conformational equilibrium in OprN."
https://openalex.org/W2751937913,"Epichloë grass endophytes comprise a group of filamentous fungi of both sexual and asexual species. Known for the beneficial characteristics they endow upon their grass hosts, the identification of these endophyte species has been of great interest agronomically and scientifically. The use of simple sequence repeat loci and the variation in repeat elements has been used to rapidly identify endophyte species and strains, however, little is known of how the structure of repeat elements changes between species and strains, and where these repeat elements are located in the fungal genome. We report on an in-depth analysis of the structure and genomic location of the simple sequence repeat locus B10, commonly used for Epichloë endophyte species identification. The B10 repeat was found to be located within an exon of a putative bZIP transcription factor, suggesting possible impacts on polypeptide sequence and thus protein function. Analysis of this repeat in the asexual endophyte hybrid Epichloë uncinata revealed that the structure of B10 alleles reflects the ancestral species that hybridized to give rise to this species. Understanding the structure and sequence of these simple sequence repeats provides a useful set of tools for readily distinguishing strains and for gaining insights into the ancestral species that have undergone hybridization events."

Materials and methods In a multi-method qualitative study based on individual interviews with TB patients, facility observations and focus group discussions with health workers (HWs) in 13 public health facilities, and key informant interviews with governmental and non-governmental experts, we describe TB contact investigation in the context of an urban setting in Kenya and identify opportunities for optimization. Results Invitation of TB patients to bring close contacts by HWs was key for all patient decisions that led to contact screening in addition to patients’ understanding of TB transmission and desire to avoid contacts suffering from TB. Sub-optimal HW enquiry of TB patients and contacts presenting at the facility were missed opportunities which stemmed from lack of standardized operational procedures, documentation tools and HW training. Stakeholders proposed provision of fast tracked and holistic health packages for contacts seeking TB screening, and sustainable government led funding for the requisite infrastructure and workforce. Conclusion TB contact invitation by HWs leading to contact screening occurs in this context. Stakeholder perspectives inform the design of an operational framework for optimized delivery."
https://openalex.org/W2751992513,"The use of hip joint simulators to evaluate the tribological performance of total hip replacements is widely reported in the literature, however, in vitro simulation studies investigating the tribology of the natural hip joint are limited with heterogeneous methodologies reported. An in vitro simulation system for the complete natural hip joint, enabling the acetabulum and femoral head to be positioned with different orientations whilst maintaining the correct joint centre of rotation, was successfully developed for this study. The efficacy of the simulation system was assessed by testing complete, matched natural porcine hip joints and porcine hip hemiarthroplasty joints in a pendulum friction simulator. The results showed evidence of biphasic lubrication, with a non-linear increase in friction being observed in both groups. Lower overall mean friction factor values in the complete natural joint group that increased at a lower rate over time, suggest that the exudation of fluid and transition to solid phase lubrication occurred more slowly in the complete natural hip joint compared to the hip hemiarthroplasty joint. It is envisaged that this methodology will be used to investigate morphological risk factors for developing hip osteoarthritis, as well as the effectiveness of early interventional treatments for degenerative hip disease."

To garner a better understanding of hockey's multifaceted nature, two structural equation models (SEMs) assessing the interrelations between offense, defense, and possession were built from three seasons of NHL data. Overall, it was found that the concepts of offense, defense, and possession are best understood via a small constellation of measured variables, and that offense mediates the relationship between possession and defense such that higher levels of offense leads to poorer defensive performance. These findings are discussed within the context of ranking player performance."
https://openalex.org/W2752403794,"Binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) is a molecular chaperone important for the folding of numerous proteins, which include millions of immunoglobulins in human body. It also plays a key role in the unfolded protein response (UPR) in the endoplasmic reticulum. Free radical generation is a common phenomenon that occurs in cells under healthy as well as under stress conditions such as ageing, inflammation, alcohol consumption, and smoking. These free radicals attack the cell membranes and generate highly reactive lipid peroxidation products such as 4-oxononenal (4-ONE). BiP is a key protein that is modified by 4-ONE. In this study, we probed how such chemical modification affects the biophysical properties of BiP. Upon modification, BiP shows significant tertiary structural changes with no changes in its secondary structure. The protein loses its thermodynamic stability, particularly, that of the nucleotide binding domain (NBD) where ATP binds. In terms of function, the modified BiP completely loses its ATPase activity with decreased ATP binding affinity. However, modified BiP retains its immunoglobulin binding function and its chaperone activity of suppressing non-specific protein aggregation. These results indicate that 4-ONE modification can significantly affect the structure-function of key proteins such as BiP involved in cellular pathways, and provide a molecular basis for how chemical modifications can result in the failure of quality control mechanisms inside the cell."

The results suggest that: i) observers' experience affects their judgment: only the expert observers correctly rated the swimmers' proficiency level; ii) evaluation of movement (technical and aesthetic scores) is correlated with the level of skill as expressed in the kinematics of the observed action (swimming speed, stroke frequency, and stroke length); iii) expert and non-expert observers use different strategies to rate the aesthetic and technical qualities of movement: equating the technical skill with the aesthetic quality is a general rule non-expert observers follow in the evaluation of human movement."
https://openalex.org/W2750693510,"To introduce a new method of deriving a virtual source model (VSM) of a linear accelerator photon beam from a phase space file (PSF) for Monte Carlo (MC) dose calculation.A PSF of a 6 MV photon beam was generated by simulating the interactions of primary electrons with the relevant geometries of a Synergy linear accelerator (Elekta AB, Stockholm, Sweden) and recording the particles that reach a plane 16 cm downstream the electron source. Probability distribution functions (PDFs) for particle positions and energies were derived from the analysis of the PSF. These PDFs were implemented in the VSM using inverse transform sampling. To model particle directions, the phase space plane was divided into a regular square grid. Each element of the grid corresponds to an area of 1 mm2 in the phase space plane. The average direction cosines, Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) between photon energies and their direction cosines, as well as the PCC between the direction cosines were calculated for each grid element. Weighted polynomial surfaces were then fitted to these 2D data. The weights are used to correct for heteroscedasticity across the phase space bins. The directions of the particles created by the VSM were calculated from these fitted functions. The VSM was validated against the PSF by comparing the doses calculated by the two methods for different square field sizes. The comparisons were performed with profile and gamma analyses.The doses calculated with the PSF and VSM agree to within 3% /1 mm (>95% pixel pass rate) for the evaluated fields.A new method of deriving a virtual photon source model of a linear accelerator from a PSF file for MC dose calculation was developed. Validation results show that the doses calculated with the VSM and the PSF agree to within 3% /1 mm."
https://openalex.org/W2753905845,"This study analyzed the characteristics of Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis) functional trait responses to geographic and climatic factors in the eastern region of Northeast China (41°-48°N) and the linear relationships among Korean pine functional traits, to explore this species' adaptability and ecological regulation strategies under different environmental conditions. Korean pine samples were collected from eight sites located at different latitudes, and the following factors were determined for each site: geographic factors-latitude, longitude, and altitude; temperature factors-mean annual temperature (MAT), growth season mean temperature (GST), and mean temperature of the coldest month (MTCM); and moisture factors-annual precipitation (AP), growth season precipitation (GSP), and potential evapotranspiration (PET). The Korean pine functional traits examined were specific leaf area (SLA), leaf thickness (LT), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), specific root length (SRL), leaf nitrogen content (LNC), leaf phosphorus content (LPC), root nitrogen content (RNC), and root phosphorus content (RPC). The results showed that Korean pine functional traits were significantly correlated to latitude, altitude, GST, MTCM, AP, GSP, and PET. Among the Korean pine functional traits, SLA showed significant linear relationships with LT, LDMC, LNC, LPC, and RPC, and LT showed significant linear relationships with LDMC, SRL, LNC, LPC, RNC, and RPC; the linear relationships between LNC, LPC, RNC, and RPC were also significant. In conclusion, Korean pine functional trait responses to latitude resulted in its adaptation to geographic and climatic factors. The main limiting factors were precipitation and evapotranspiration, followed by altitude, latitude, GST, and MTCM. The impacts of longitude and MAT were not obvious. Changes in precipitation and temperature were most responsible for the close correlation among Korean pine functional traits, reflecting its adaption to habitat variation."
https://openalex.org/W2752791152,"Nonconvulsive seizures (NCS) are frequent in hospitalized patients and may further aggravate injury in the already damaged brain, potentially worsening outcomes in encephalopathic patients. Therefore, both early seizure recognition and treatment have been advocated to prevent further neurological damage.Evaluate the main EEG patterns seen in patients with impaired consciousness and address the effect of treatment with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), continuous intravenous anesthetic drugs (IVADs), or the combination of both, on outcomes.This was a single center retrospective cohort study conducted in a private, tertiary care hospital. Consecutive adult patients with altered consciousness submitted to a routine EEG between January 2008 and February 2011 were included in this study. Based on EEG pattern, patients were assigned to one of three groups: Group Interictal Patterns (IP; EEG showing only interictal epileptiform discharges or triphasic waves), Group Rhythmic and Periodic Patterns (RPP; at least one EEG with rhythmic or periodic patterns), and Group Ictal (Ictal; at least one EEG showing ictal pattern). Groups were compared in terms of administered antiepileptic treatment and frequency of unfavorable outcomes (modified Rankin scale ≥3 and in-hospital mortality).Two hundred and six patients (475 EEGs) were included in this analysis. Interictal pattern was observed in 35.4% (73/206) of patients, RPP in 53.4% (110/206) and ictal in 11.2% (23/206) of patients. Treatment with AEDs, IVADs or a combination of both was administered in half of the patients. While all Ictal group patients received treatment (AEDs or IVADs), only 24/73 (32.9%) IP group patients and 55/108 (50.9%) RPP group patients were treated (p<0.001). Hospital length of stay (LOS) and frequency of unfavorable outcomes did not differ among the groups. In-hospital mortality was higher in IVADs treated RPP patients compared to AEDs treated RPP patients [11/19 (57.9%) vs. 11/36 (30.6%) patients, respectively, p = 0.049]. Hospital LOS, in-hospital mortality and frequency of unfavorable outcomes did not differ between Ictal patients treated exclusively with AEDs or IVADs.In patients with acute altered consciousness and abnormal routine EEG, antiepileptic treatment did not improve outcomes regardless of the presence of periodic, rhythmic or ictal EEG patterns."
https://openalex.org/W3022183573,"Telomeres, the nucleoprotein complexes at the termini of linear chromosomes, are essential for the processes of end replication, end protection, and chromatin segregation. The Mre11 complex is involved in multiple cellular roles in DNA repair and structure in the regulation and function of telomere size homeostasis. In this study, we characterize yeast telomere chromatin structure, phenotypic heritability, and chromatin segregation in both wild-type [MRE11] and A470 motif alleles. MRE11 strains confer a telomere size of 300 base pairs of G+T irregular simple sequence repeats. This DNA and a portion of subtelomeric DNA is embedded in a telosome: a MNase-resistant non-nucleosomal particle. Chromatin immunoprecipitation shows a three to four-fold lower occupancy of Mre11A470T proteins than wild-type proteins in telosomes. Telosomes containing the Mre11A470T protein confer a greater resistance to MNase digestion than wild-type telosomes. The integration of a wild-type MRE11 allele into an ectopic locus in the genome of an mre11A470T mutant and the introduction of an mre11A470T allele at an ectopic site in a wild-type strain lead to unexpectedly differing results. In each case, the replicated sister chromatids inherit telosomes containing only the protein encoded by the genomic mre11 locus, even in the presence of protein encoded by the opposing ectopic allele. We hypothesize that the telosome segregates by a conservative mechanism. These data support a mechanism for the linkage between sister chromatid replication and maintenance of either identical mutant or identical wild-type telosomes after replication of sister chromatids. These data suggest the presence of an active mechanism for chromatin segregation in yeast."
