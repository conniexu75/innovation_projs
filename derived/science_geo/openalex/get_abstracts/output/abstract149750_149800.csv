https://openalex.org/W2003446134,"The existence of receptor dimers has been proposed for several G protein-coupled receptors. However, the question of whether G protein-coupled receptor dimers are necessary for activating or modulating normal receptor function is unclear. We address this question with somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) of which there are five distinct subtypes. By using transfected mutant and wild type receptors, as well as endogenous receptors, we provide pharmacological, biochemical, and physical evidence, based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis, that activation by ligand induces SSTR dimerization, both homo- and heterodimerization with other members of the SSTR family, and that dimerization alters the functional properties of the receptor such as ligand binding affinity and agonist-induced receptor internalization and up-regulation. Double label confocal fluorescence microscopy showed that when SSTR1 and SSTR5 subtypes were coexpressed in Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cells and treated with agonist they underwent internalization and were colocalized in cytoplasmic vesicles. SSTR5 formed heterodimers with SSTR1 but not with SSTR4 suggesting that heterodimerization is a specific process that is restricted to some but not all receptor subtype combinations. Direct protein interaction between different members of the SSTR subfamily defines a new level of molecular cross-talk between subtypes of the SSTR and possibly related receptor families.

The GABA-B receptor associates as a heterodimer via the cytoplasmic C-tail in the endoplasmic reticulum and is targeted to the plasma membrane as a preformed dimer, independent of agonist regulation (11.Kuner R.

Whether other GPCR dimers are similarly preformed or whether they undergo dimerization at the plasma membrane in response to agonist activation is unclear (9.George S.R. Lee S.P. Varghese G.

Dopamine and muscarinic receptors have been postulated to exist on the membrane as preformed dimers that are stabilized by ligand binding (9.George S.R. Lee S.P. Varghese G. Zeman P.R. Seeman P.

Chem. 1999; 274: 16629-16640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The β-adrenergic receptor on the other hand undergoes ligand-dependent dimerization and activation, whereas agonists at the δ opioid receptor have been suggested to favor monomer formation that is required for agonist-induced internalization (10.Cvejic S. Devi L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26959-26964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 16.Hebert T.E. Bouvier M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In the case of somatostatin (SST) receptors (SSTRs), there are five distinct subtypes that bind the two natural ligands, SST-14 and SST-28, with comparable low nanomolar affinity (22.Patel Y.C. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 1999; 20: 157-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar). The five subtypes also share common signaling pathways such as the ability to inhibit adenylyl cyclase and to activate phosphotyrosine phosphatase (22.Patel Y.C. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 1999; 20: 157-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar, 23.Reardon D.B. Dent P. Wood S.L. Kong T. Sturgill T.W. Mol.

Furthermore, individual target cells typically express more than one SSTR subtype and often all five isoforms (25.Patel Y.C. Panetta R. Escher E. Greenwood M. Srikant C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1506-1509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Kumar U. Laird D. Srikant C.B. Escher E. Patel Y.C.

FASEB J. 1999; 13: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) raising the question of whether multiple SSTRs in the same cell are redundant or whether they interact for greater functional diversity. By using pharmacological, biochemical, and physical methods, here we show that SSTRs associate as dimers, both as homodimers or heterodimers with other members of the SSTR family, and that dimerization alters the functional properties of the receptor such as ligand binding affinity, signaling, and agonist-induced regulation. We provide the first direct evidence based on the sensitive fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis that hSSTR5 exists as a monomer in the basal state and undergoes dose-dependent increase in dimerization when treated with SST-14 suggesting that dimerization is induced by agonist binding. Peptides and antisera were obtained as follows: SST-14, SST-28 (Bachem); Leu8-d-Trp22, Tyr25, SST-28 (LTT-SST-28) (Peninsula); SMS-(201–995) and Tyr3SMS (Sandoz, Basel, Switzerland); des-AA1,2,5[d-Trp8,IAMP9]SRIF (SCH275) and des-AA1,5[Tyr2-d-Trp8,IAMP9]SRIF (SCH288) (J. Rivier, Salk Institute); anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody (12CA5) and fluorescein- and rhodamine-conjugated monoclonal antibodies against HA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The Δ318 hSSTR5 C-tail deletion mutant and the second extracellular loop (ECL2) hSSTR5 mutant in which 7 of the 10 COOH-terminal residues of the second ECL were conservatively altered have been described previously (29.Greenwood M.T.

Neomycin-resistant clones were selected and maintained in F12 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 700 μg/ml G418. Binding studies were carried out for 30 min at 37 °C with cell membrane protein or whole cells with125I-labeled LTT-SST-28 radioligand or subtype-selective ligands as previously reported (29.Greenwood M.T.

Receptor coupling to adenylyl cyclase was tested by incubating cells for 30 min with 1 mm forskolin with or without SST (10−10–10−6m) at 37 °C as described previously (30.Hukovic N. Panetta R.

Internalization experiments were carried out by incubating cells overnight at 4 °C with radioligand with or without SST (0.1 mm) (30.Hukovic N. Panetta R. Kumar U. Rocheville M. Patel Y.C. J. Biol.

At the end of each incubation, surface-bound radioligand was removed by acid wash, and internalized radioligand was measured as acid-resistant counts in 0.1 n NaOH extracts of acid-washed cells (30.Hukovic N.

The ability of long term treatment with SST to up-regulate surface SSTR binding was studied in cells cultured with 1 μm SST or SMS for 22 h as described previously (32.Hukovic N. Panetta R. Kumar U.

After acid wash to remove surface-bound SST, whole cell binding assays were performed to determine total and nonspecific binding. Residual surface binding was calculated as the difference between control and experimental groups (32.Hukovic N. Panetta R. Kumar U. Patel Y.C.

CHO-K1 cells expressing HA-SSTR5 were analyzed for receptor protein by Western blots as reported previously (27.Kumar U. Sasi R. Suresh S. Patel A. Thangaraju M. Metrakos P. Patel S.C. Patel Y.C. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Membranes were incubated with or without SST-14 (10−6m) for 30 min at 37 oC and then solubilized in sample buffer containing 62.5 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 50 mmol/liter dithiothreitol. 50-μg samples of membrane protein were fractionated by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels as described by Laemmli (34.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). The fractionated proteins were transferred by electrophoresis to nitrocellulose membranes in a transfer buffer containing 0.025 mol/liter Tris, 0.192 mol/liter glycine, and 15% methanol. The membranes were then probed for HA-SSTR5 using the mouse monoclonal antibody and the lumilight+ Western blotting Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) (27.Kumar U. Sasi R. Suresh S. Patel A. Thangaraju M. Metrakos P. Patel S.C. Patel Y.C. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Blots were analyzed semi-quantitatively using the computer scanning software Masterscan. Generally, FRET efficiencies are determined indirectly by measuring changes in the quantum yield of any competitive donor deactivation process upon introduction of an acceptor molecule (35.Forster T.

Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1543-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Donor photobleaching represents such a competitive process that can be exploited in pbFRET microscopy. The effective FRET efficiency E is calculated from the photobleaching time constants of the donor (D) obtained in the absence (τD−A) and presence (τD+A) of acceptor (A) according to Equation 1. E=1−τD−AτD+AEquation 1 In a two-state model, the minimal amount of receptor dimerization (αmin) is related to the fraction of acceptor labeled receptor (fA) and Eas shown in Equation 2, αmin=8EfA(2+E) 2Equation 2 where fA is determined from the relative affinities of fluorescein- and rhodamine-conjugated mAbs and the concentration ratio used for incubation (39.Gadella T.W.J. Jovin T.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1543-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). pbFRET experiments were performed on CHO-K1 cells stably expressing HA-hSSTR5 using a Leica DMBL fluorescence microscope equipped with epi-illumination. An OSRAM HBO 100-watt mercury lamp was used as excitation light source. In order to separate fluorescein excitation from emission as well as to optimize fluorescein excitation while simultaneously blocking rhodamine excitation, the following filters were used: Leitz BP 450–490 (excitation), RKP510 (dichroic mirror), and BP 515–535 (emission). Digital images (8-bit) were generated with an Electrim-1000U CCD camera with a spatial resolution of 1134 × 486 pixels of size 7.8 × 13.6 μm. Exposure as well as time delays were software controlled. IGOR Pro 3.13 (Wavemetrics, OR) was used for image analysis. Images were corrected for dark current, background, and flatness. Expression of SSTRs in transfected CHO-K1 cells was determined by immunocytochemistry. Rabbit polyclonal antipeptide antibodies directed against sequences in the amino-terminal segment of hSSTR1 (diluted 1:300) or mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibodies (diluted 1:300) were used as primary antibodies followed by reaction with rhodamine or fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody as described previously (33.Hukovic N.

To demonstrate colocalization of hSSTR1 with hSSTR5, CHO cells stably cotransfected with wt hSSTR1 and HA-hSSTR5 were treated with 1 μm SMS for 12 h at 4 °C. For receptor localization on the plasma membrane, cells were fixed at 4 °C in 3.7% formalin for 15 min. For receptor localization in vesicles, cells were incubated for an additional 60 min at 37 °C to allow internalization, fixed, and permeabilized in methanol/acetone at −10 °C for 15 min. The fixed cells in both instances were processed for double label confocal fluorescence immunocytochemistry. Cells were mounted with immunofluor and viewed under a Zeiss LSM 410 confocal microscope. Images were obtained as single optical sections taken through the middle of cells and averaged over 32 scans/frame. Results are presented as mean ± S.E. We first demonstrated SSTR homodimerization by functional complementation of two partially active mutants of human SSTR5 (hSSTR5) that we have previously described (29.Greenwood M.T. Hukovic N.

Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21416-21422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). One is a conservative segment exchange mutant of the second extracellular loop, ECL2 hSSTR5 which fails to bind SST-14/SST-28 but which is correctly targeted to the plasma membrane as shown by immunocytochemistry (29.Greenwood M.T. Hukovic N. Kumar U. Panetta R. Hjorth S.A. Srikant C.B. Patel Y.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 807-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The other is a cytoplasmic tail (C-tail) deletion mutant Δ318 hSSTR5 that displays complete loss of adenylyl cyclase coupling while retaining full agonist binding potency and the ability to undergo agonist-dependent internalization (30.Hukovic N. Panetta R. Kumar U. Rocheville M. Patel Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21416-21422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We wondered whether loss of adenylyl cyclase coupling by the C-tail deletion mutant could be rescued by cotransfection, whereby the binding competent mutant would associate and signal through the C-tail of the binding-deficient mutant. The two mutants were stably cotransfected in CHO-K1 cells (B max 119 ± 36 fmol/mg protein) and compared with individual Δ318 hSSTR5 (B max 126 ± 43 fmol/mg protein) or ECL2 hSSTR5 (no binding) stable monotransfectants. Coupling to adenylyl cyclase was determined by the ability of SST-28 to inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP. In the cotransfectant, SST-28 produced dose-dependent inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP (31 ± 2.5% at 1 μm agonist) which was completely abolished by pertussis toxin treatment (Fig.2 B). This suggests that the two mutant receptors assemble as homodimers to constitute a functional G protein-linked effector complex. Competition analysis showed a significant 4-fold increase in the binding affinity of SST-14 for the putative Δ318-hSSTR5/ECL2-hSSTR5 dimeric receptors (K i 3.1 ± 1.9 nm) compared with Δ318 hSSTR5 alone (K i 12.1 ± 2.5 nm) suggesting physical association leading to a change in receptor conformation (Fig. 2 A). We next investigated the effect of coexpression of the mutant receptors on receptor internalization (Fig. 2 C). CHO-K1 cells expressing either Δ318 hSSTR5 or Δ318 hSSTR5 and ECL2 hSSTR5 mutants were incubated at 37 °C for different times with 125I-labeled LTT-SST-28 (a nonselective radioligand for all five SSTR subtypes) with or without 0.1 μm SST-28 (30.Hukovic N.

Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4046-4049Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The Δ318 hSSTR5 mutant displayed time-dependent internalization with a maximum of 41 ± 2.8% at 60 min (Fig. 2 C). Coexpression of the ECL2 mutant markedly inhibited internalization of the putative dimeric complex to only 13 ± 3.9% at 60 min. This suggests that the association of the ECL2 hSSTR5 mutant with the binding competent Δ318 hSSTR mutant, although promoting ligand binding affinity, impairs internalization of the dimeric receptor complex perhaps because only one of the receptor subunits is in a ligand-bound state. Physical association of SSTRs was investigated by Western blot analysis of CHO-K1 cell membranes expressing full-length hSSTR5 tagged at the amino terminus with a nonapeptide of the hemagglutinin (HA) sequence (31.Koller K.J.

These cells expressed a high level of membrane hSSTR5 (B max 800 ± 90 fmol/mg protein) that existed in the basal state as a mixture of broad monomeric 55–65-kDa and dimeric 105–115-kDa bands (ratio 73 ± 3%: 27 ± 3%) (Fig. 3). Treatment with SST-14 resulted in a dose-dependent saturating increase in the proportion of dimers (monomer:dimer ratio 54 ± 1%:46 ± 1% with 1 μm ligand). The dose-response curve for hSSTR5 dimerization paralleled that for ligand-induced receptor signaling (Fig. 2 B).Figure 2Homodimerization of hSSTR5.

https://openalex.org/W1982544588,"Prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) is a recently defined homologue of the Thy-1/Ly-6 family of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cell surface antigens. PSCA mRNA is expressed in the basal cells of normal prostate and in more than 80% of prostate cancers. The purpose of the present study was to examine PSCA protein expression in clinical specimens of human prostate cancer. Five monoclonal antibodies were raised against a PSCA-GST fusion protein and screened for their ability to recognize PSCA on the cell surface of human prostate cancer cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of PSCA expression was performed on paraffin-embedded sections from 25 normal tissues, 112 primary prostate cancers and nine prostate cancers metastatic to bone. The level of PSCA expression in prostate tumors was quantified and compared with expression in adjacent normal glands. The antibodies detect PSCA expression on the cell surface of normal and malignant prostate cells and distinguish three extracellular epitopes on PSCA. Prostate and transitional epithelium reacted strongly with PSCA. PSCA staining was also seen in placental trophoblasts, renal collecting ducts and neuroendocrine cells in the stomach and colon. All other normal tissues tested were negative. PSCA protein expression was identified in 105/112 (94%) primary prostate tumors and 9/9 (100%) bone metastases. The level of PSCA expression increased with higher Gleason score (P=0.016), higher tumor stage (P=0.010) and progression to androgen-independence (P=0. 021). Intense, homogeneous staining was seen in all nine bone metastases. PSCA is a cell surface protein with limited expression in extraprostatic normal tissues. PSCA expression correlates with tumor stage, grade and androgen independence and may have prognostic utility. Because expression on the surface of prostate cancer cells increases with tumor progression, PSCA may be a useful molecular target in advanced prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2312641146,"The tumour suppressor p53 is mutated in half of all human cancers, most frequently with missense substitutions in its core domain. We present a new assessment of the mutation database based on quantitative folding and DNA-binding studies of the isolated core domain. Our data identify five distinct mutant classes that correlate with four well-defined regions of the core domain structure. On extrapolation to 37 degrees C the wild-type protein has a stability of 3.0 kcal/mol. This also emerges as an oncogenic threshold: all beta-sandwich mutants destabilized by this amount (50% denatured) are expected to promote cancer. Other weakly destabilizing mutations are restricted to loop 3 in the DNA-binding region. Drugs that stabilize mutant p53 folding have the potential to reactivate apoptotic signalling pathways in tumour cells either by transactivation-dependent or independent pathways. Using an affinity ligand as a proof of principle we have recovered the thermodynamic stability of the hotspot G245S. With reference states for the five mutant classes as a guide, future therapeutic strategies may similarly stabilize partially structured or binding states of mutant p53 that restore limited p53 pathways to tumour suppression."

For instance, an anti-HER-2/neu antibody (HerceptinTM) has been used clinically as a potent growth inhibitor of such breast cancer cells (6.Pegram M.D. Lipton A. Hayes D.F. Weber B.L. Baselga J.M.

Jing T. Liu B. Yao J. Tan M. McDonnell T.J. Hung M.-C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 581-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Still, the mechanism ofHER-2/neu-mediated TNF resistance in cancer cells remains unclear. The HER-2/neu gene encodes a 185-kDa transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase with homology to members of the EGF receptor family. Unlike the other EGF receptors,HER-2/neu has an intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity that activates receptor-mediated signal transduction in the absence of ligand. Although EGF can bind to EGF receptor to induce receptor dimerization and activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) (7.Hu P. Margolis B. Skolnik E.Y. Lammers R. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 981-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), it is not known whether HER-2/neu homodimer can activate the PI3K pathway without extracellular stimulation. Activation of PI3K generates PtdIns-3,4-P2, which in turn recruits and activates a downstream serine/threonine kinase, Akt. Activated Akt phosphorylates specific targets such as Bad (8.Peso L.D.

Thus, the Akt signaling pathway has a critical role in anti-apoptosis that may contribute to the pathogenesis of cancer (12.Frank T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar,13.Downward J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the activation of Akt in breast tumor specimens and breast cancer cell lines for its anti-apoptotic roles in HER-2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer cells. We found that Akt was constitutively activated inHER-2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer cells and that Akt activity was required for these cells resistance to TNF-induced apoptosis. We showed that HER-2/neu-overexpressing cancer cells became sensitive to apoptosis when the Akt pathway was blocked by the dominant-negative Akt. Furthermore, we found that Akt activity was required for the activation of both IKK-α and -β, for IκB phosphorylation, and for NF-κB activation. Our results provide a molecular explanation for the finding thatHER-2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer cells are more resistant to TNF-induced apoptosis, leading to poor prognosis and shortened survival of patients. All breast cancer cell lines and NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.HER-2/neu-transformed NIH3T3 cells were generated by transfecting the cells with membrane point-mutated humanHER-2/neu cDNA. Transformed cells were cloned from the transformed foci in three rounds of selection. The DN-Akt transfectants in MDA-MB453 and HER-2/neu-transformed 3T3 cells were established by transfecting these cells with HA-tagged Akt (K179M) cDNA. The transfectants were grown under the same conditions, except that 600 μg/ml of G418 was added to the culture medium. Cells treated with or without TNF were collected at the time interval as indicated and washed once with ice-cold PBS, and apoptosis was analyzed by either a flow cytometry assay or DNA fragmentation, as described previously (14.Shao R.

Cell nuclear extracts from samples treated with or without TNF for 30 min were prepared as described previously (14.Shao R. Karunagaran D. Zhou B.P. Li K. Lo S.-S. Deng J. Chiao P.J. Hung M.-C. J.

The nuclear extract (5 μg) was incubated with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) on ice for 20 min, and a 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the κB site of the human immunodeficiency virus was added. Binding of the probe was carried out at room temperature for 20 min. The resulting complexes were resolved in 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. Cells were washed twice with PBS, scraped into 500 μl of lysis buffer, and incubated on ice for 20 min. After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min, 500 μg of each supernatant was preincubated with 2 μg of rabbit immunoglobulin G and 50 μl of protein G for 1 h at 4 °C. Endogenous IKK-α was immunoprecipitated overnight with 2 μg of anti-IKK-α antibody (Santa Cruz) and 50 μl of protein G. The immunocomplex was washed five times with lysis buffer, dissolved in loading buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The protein samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with primary antibodies and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies according to the manufacturer's instructions. The immunoblots were visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Cell extracts were prepared from samples treated with or without TNF, and immunocomplex kinase assays were performed as described previously (15.Shao R. Hu M.C.-T. Zhou B.P. Lin S.-Y.

Approximately 0.2 × 106 cells of either MDA-MB453 or its DN-Akt transfectants were cotransfected in 6-well plates with pcDNA3-lacZ and either wild-type NF-κB luciferase (κB-luc) or mutant NF-κB luciferase (mut/κB-luc). After 40 h of transfection, TNF was added to the culture medium as indicated, and both TNF-treated and untreated cultures were continued to incubate for another 8 h. The luciferase activity of each sample was measured with the luciferase assay kit (Promega) and normalized with a β-galactosidase assay. Because overexpression of HER-2/neu induced resistance to TNF (4.Hudziak R.M. Lewis G.D. Shalaby M.R. Eessalu T.E. Aggarwal B.B. Ullrich A. Shepard H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5102-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 5.Lichtenstein A. Berenson J. Gera J.F. Waldburger K. Martinez-Maza O. Berek J. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 7364-7370PubMed Google Scholar), and the Akt pathway is known to enhance cell survival, we examined whether expression of HER-2/neu correlated with activation of Akt in breast cancers. We compared the levels of activated Akt (phosphorylated Akt) (p-Akt) of 10HER-2/neu-positive and 10 HER-2/neu-negative human breast tumors by immunostaining them with an antibody specific to p-Akt. Although no p-Akt signal was detected in the 10HER-2/neu-negative tumors, 7 of 10HER-2/neu-positive tumors showed strong p-Akt staining, suggesting that expression of HER-2/neu correlates significantly with Akt activation (p < 0.01). As control, all samples were Akt-positive when they were stained with an anti-Akt antibody. Representative stainings of p-Akt are shown in Fig.1 A. To confirm our observation of a correlation between HER-2/neu expression and Akt activation in the clinical samples, we used Western blotting with an anti-p-Akt antibody to analyze p-Akt in nine breast cancer cell lines that showed various expression levels of HER-2/neu. The level of p-Akt paralleled the cell's HER-2/neu expression (Fig. 1 B), indicating that activation of Akt correlates well with expression of HER-2/neu in breast cancer cells. Moreover, this correlation remained the same in the absence of serum, suggesting that activation of Akt corresponds to the level ofHER-2/neu, independent of stimulation of growth factors or cytokines in the serum (i.e. constitutive activation). To create a model system, and to rule out the possibility that some other mechanisms might contribute to concurrent activation of Akt and overexpression of HER-2/neu, we compared Akt activation between the HER-2/neu-transformed NIH3T3 cell clones with that of their parental cells. In the absence of serum, Akt was activated constitutively in the HER-2/neu-transformed cells but not in the parental cells (Fig. 1 C), which confirmed that Akt was activated by the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity ofHER-2/neu in the absence of extracellular stimulation. Furthermore, activation of Akt was blocked by wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3K, suggesting that this HER-2/neu-mediated Akt activation occurs through PI3K. If the HER-2/neu–induced resistance to TNF is caused primarily by activation of Akt and not by other mechanisms, blocking this Akt pathway should render the cells sensitive to TNF-induced apoptosis. Therefore, to inhibit the Akt pathway, we transfected a DN-Akt (kinase-dead) DNA into the HER-2/neu-transformed NIH3T3 (HER-2/neu-3T3) cells. Upon TNF treatment, the DN-Akt transfectants of HER-2/neu-3T3 and NIH3T3 cells were about 20-fold more sensitive to apoptosis than the HER-2/neu-3T3 cells (Fig. 2 A). Expression levels of DN-Akt in these cell clones are indicated in theinsert to Fig. 2 A. To confirm the Akt anti-apoptotic effect in the HER-2/neu-overexpressed human breast cancer cells, we transfected DN-Akt DNA intoHER-2/neu-overexpressing MDA-MB453 cells and obtained several independent DN-Akt-overexpressing cell clones (Fig.2 B, insert). Similarly, the DN-Akt transfectants (clones 1 and 2) of MDA-MB453 cells became about 10-fold more sensitive to TNF-induced apoptosis than the parental cells (Fig. 2 B). Apoptosis induced by TNF was further verified by DNA fragmentation assay (Fig. 2 C). Thus, HER-2/neu was found to block TNF-induced apoptosis via the PI3K/Akt pathway. PI3K has recently been shown to be involved in the activation of transcription factor NF-κB (16.Beuaud C. Henzel W.J. Baeuerle P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 17.Kane L.P. Shapiro V.S. Stokoe D. Weiss A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 601-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar), which is a p50/p65 (RelA) heterodimer regulated by its inhibitory protein, IκB (18.Baeuerle P.A.

A. 1998; 95: 9067-9069Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Clinical evidence indicates that loss of estrogen receptor (ER) correlates strongly with overexpression of HER-2/neu (20.Tagliabue E. Menard S. Robertson J.F. Harris L. Int. J. Biol. Markers. 1999; 14: 16-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), which is consistent with our previous finding that ER down-regulatesHER-2/neu expression (21.Russell K.S. Hung M.-C. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6624-6629PubMed Google Scholar). Analogously, NF-κB is often activated constitutively in ER-negative breast cancer cells (22.Nakshatri H. Bhat-Nakshatri P. Martin D.A. Goulet Jr., R.J. Sledge Jr., G.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3629-3639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that activation of Akt by HER-2/neu may turn on NF-κB, which inhibits TNF-induced apoptosis (23.Baltimore D. Beg A.A. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2931) Google Scholar, 24.Wanxg C.-Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2505) Google Scholar, 25.Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2445) Google Scholar). To test whether overexpression of HER-2/neu can activate NF-κB, we assayed the NF-κB DNA binding and transcriptional activation activities in HER-2/neu-3T3 and NIH3T3 cells and found NF-κB DNA binding activity higher in the HER-2/neu-3T3 cells than in the NIH3T3 cells, in a serum-independent manner (Fig.3 A, lanes 4 and5). As controls, NF-κB DNA binding activities were strongly activated by TNF treatment (Fig. 3 A); these activities were abrogated by the competing wild-type κB oligonucleotides (data not shown; see below). Furthermore, activation of the transcriptional activity of NF-κB in theHER-2/neu-3T3 cells without serum was confirmed by luciferase assay (Fig. 3 B). Similar results were obtained in rat HER-2/neu-transformed NIH3T3 and SW3T3 cells (data not shown). These data strongly suggested that overexpression ofHER-2/neu activates NF-κB constitutively. To determine whether sensitization of TNF-induced apoptosis in the DN-Akt transfectants occurs through inhibition of NF-κB, we measured NF-κB activities in the transfectants and MDA-MB453 cells. As shown in Fig.3, C and D, TNF-induced NF-κB DNA binding and transcription activities in the DN-Akt transfectants were significantly inhibited (3–5-fold). That these inhibitions were not caused by down-regulation of p65 or p50 by TNF is demonstrated by the finding of no change in the p65 and p50 levels of these cells in the absence or presence of TNF (Fig. 3 C, bottom panel). To investigate whether DN-Akt inhibits IκB phosphorylation and degradation, we analyzed the expression and phosphorylation patterns of IκB-α in the DN-Akt transfectants and MDA-MB453 cells before and after TNF treatment. As shown in Fig.4 A, only one IκB-α band was observed in the DN-Akt transfectants before or after the TNF treatment, whereas two bands were detected in the TNF-treated parental cells. The upper band may be the phosphorylated form of IκB-α (p-IκB-α), because it disappeared after treatment with calf intestine phosphatase (CIP, Fig. 4 B). TNF has been demonstrated to activate IκB kinases (IKKs), which in turn phosphorylate IκB, which is then degraded and activates NF-κB (26.Maniatis T. Science. 1997; 278: 818-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar,27.Verma I.M. Stevenson J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11758-11760Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). To examine whether DN-Akt blocks activation of IKKs, we compared the kinase activities of IKK-α and -β in the DN-Akt transfectants with those in the parental cells after TNF treatment, using immunocomplex kinase assays. The endogenous IKK-α and -β kinase activities were readily detected in the MDA-MB453 cells, whereas their activities were inhibited in the DN-Akt transfectants (Fig.4 C), suggesting that Akt activity is required for activation of IKKs by TNF. Furthermore, we showed that in the DN-Akt transfectants, DN-Akt and the endogenous Akt associate specifically with IKK-α in vivo regardless of TNF treatment (Fig.4 D). To further confirm that Akt is an activator upstream of IKKs, we transfected the DNA of p65 (RelA), IKK-α or -β, or a constitutively active Akt into the DN-Akt transfectants to restore TNF-induced NF-κB activities in these cells. Overexpression of each of these proteins significantly overrode the inhibitory effect of DN-Akt and restored activation of NF-κB by TNF (Fig. 4 E), indicating that Akt is indeed upstream of both IKKs. Taken together, our results suggested that Akt activity is essential for NF-κB activation by HER-2/neu and TNF. A model we propose to illustrate the parallel HER-2/neu- and TNF-induced anti-apoptotic pathways is shown in Fig. 4 F. While we were preparing this manuscript, NF-κB was reported to be a target of Akt (28.Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar, 29.Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1664) Google Scholar), confirming our finding that HER-2/neu activates the NF-κB anti-apoptotic pathway through Akt. In general, activation of the Akt signaling pathway requires extracellular survival factors (mitogenic stimuli) such as EGF, insulin, platelet-derived growth factor, thrombin, heregulin, and nerve growth factor. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence thatHER-2/neu activates the Akt/NF-κB pathway without extracellular stimulation. Our study also details a molecular mechanism of TNF resistance that may provide an interpretation for theHER-2/neu-overexpressing cancer cells, escape from host immune defenses, and the contribution of this mechanism to the poor survival of cancer patients with HER-2/neu overexpression. Understanding the HER-2/neu-mediated anti-apoptotic pathway may open an avenue for developing novel anticancer therapies forHER-2/neu-overexpressing breast and ovarian cancers."
https://openalex.org/W1481263059,"In Alzheimer's disease, beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques are surrounded by activated astrocytes and microglia. A growing body of evidence suggests that these activated glia contribute to neurotoxicity through the induction of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) and the production of neurotoxic free radicals, mediated in part by the expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS). Here, we address the possibility that Abeta-stimulated iNOS expression might result from an initial induction of IL-1beta and TNFalpha. We find that in Abeta-stimulated astrocyte cultures, IL-1beta and TNFalpha production occur before iNOS production, new protein synthesis is required for increased iNOS mRNA levels, and the IL-1 receptor antagonist IL-1ra can inhibit nitrite accumulation. Likewise, dominant-negative mutants of tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 6, TRAF2, and NFkappaB-inducing kinase (NIK), intracellular proteins involved in IL-1 and TNFalpha receptor signaling cascades, inhibit Abeta-stimulated iNOS promoter activity. Our data suggest that Abeta stimulation of astrocyte iNOS is mediated in part by IL-1beta and TNFalpha, and involves a TRAF6-, TRAF2-, and NIK-dependent signaling mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2109778555,"DNA supercoiling is essential for bacterial cell survival. We demonstrated that DNA topoisomerase IV, acting in concert with topoisomerase I and gyrase, makes an important contribution to the steady-state level of supercoiling in Escherichia coli. Following inhibition of gyrase, topoisomerase IV alone relaxed plasmid DNA to a final supercoiling density (sigma) of -0.015 at an initial rate of 0.8 links min(-1). Topoisomerase I relaxed DNA at a faster rate, 5 links min(-1), but only to a sigma of -0.05. Inhibition of topoisomerase IV in wild-type cells increased supercoiling to approximately the same level as in a mutant lacking topoisomerase I activity (to sigma = -0.08). The role of topoisomerase IV was revealed by two functional assays. Removal of both topoisomerase I and topoisomerase IV caused the DNA to become hyper-negatively supercoiled (sigma = -0.09), greatly stimulating transcription from the supercoiling sensitive leu-500 promoter and increasing the number of supercoils trapped by lambda integrase site-specific recombination."

A specialized form of ECM lining epithelial sheets and blood vessels is the basal lamina or basement membrane. The basement membrane is composed predominantly of collagen type IV, laminin, enactin/nidogen, and proteoglycans (5.Madri J.A. Dreyer B. Pitlick F.A. Furthmayr H. Lab.

Moreover, studies indicate that specific functional domains within ECM molecules such as fibronectin, laminin, and thrombospondin may regulate angiogenesis and tumor growth (9.Carnemolla B. Neri D.

The most widely distributed form of collagen type IV, composed of a network of two α1(IV) chains and one α2(IV) chain, is found in the basal lamina of many tissues, including blood vessels (12.Hudson B.G.

Collagen type IV, like many matrix macromolecules, is organized into functional domains (see Fig. 1) (16.Kühn K. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 439-445Crossref Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The 7 S domain at the amino terminus mediates association of collagen IV molecules into a tetramer, whereas the NC1 domain at the carboxyl terminus is thought to promote individual chain selection, lateral association, and dimerization during matrix assembly (17.Siebold B.

In contrast, the central triple helical region of collagen type IV promotes cellular interactions by ligation of β1 integrins (20.Vandenberg P. Kern A. Ries A. Luckenbill-Edds L. Mann K. Kühn K. J.

Previous studies utilizing a wide variety of species and experimental systems have established the importance of basement membranes, and type IV collagen in particular, in the process of morphogenesis. The fact that basement membrane formation is essential for morphogenesis and cell differentiation in such ancient and divergent invertebrate organisms as Hydra vulgaris, emphasizes the fundamental importance of cell/ECM interactions in biological systems (22.Zhang X. Hudson B.G. Sarras Jr., M.P. Dev. Biol. 1994; 164: 10-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Experiments in which exogenously added NC1 domains of type IV collagen caused a perturbation of ECM formation and a subsequent blockage of morphogenesis in H. vulgaris also highlights the importance of this particular matrix component to growth, development, and cellular function (22.Zhang X. Hudson B.G. Sarras Jr., M.P. Dev. Biol. 1994; 164: 10-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This work has been extended to vertebrates, where it has been shown that type IV collagen α3-deficient mice have auditory (23.Cosgrove D. Samuelson G. Meehan D.T. Miller C. McGee J Walsh E. Siegel M. Hearing Res. 1998; 121: 84-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and renal (24.Miner J.H. Sanes J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1403-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) deficits related to alterations in basement membrane structure and function. Similarly, deletion of the paired collagen type IV α5 and α6 genes leads to abnormalities in basement membrane structure and the development of such disease states as Alport syndrome and an inherited smooth muscle cancer termed diffuse leiomyomatosis (25.Zhou J.

From the standpoint of potential medical treatments, specialized forms of morphogenesis such as angiogenesis have received increased attention because of the importance of blood vessel formation in tumor growth (26.Blood C.H.

To more fully understand the molecular functions of NC protein domains, we generated recombinant NC1 domains from each of the six genetically distinct human collagen IV chains to evaluate whether these domains could regulate endothelial cell behavior. Here we demonstrate that specific collagen IV NC1 domains provide novel αv and β1 integrin-dependent binding sites for endothelial cells. Importantly, systemic administration of recombinant α2, α3, and α6(IV) NC1 domains potently inhibit angiogenesis and tumor growth in vivo. Taken together, these findings suggest that unique NC1 domains of collagen IV may regulate neovascularization by promoting integrin/endothelial cell interactions as well as directing matrix assembly of collagen IV within the subendothelial basement membrane. Thus, these NC1 domains may help define an important new class of anti-angiogenic molecules for the treatment of neovascular diseases.

The secreted proteins carried the FLAG sequence fused to the amino terminus of the respective full-length NC1 domains. The proteins were purified from serum-free conditioned media by affinity chromatography on anti-FLAG agarose. The recombinant protein pools were concentrated by Amicon YM10 ultrafiltrators, and the elution buffer was exchanged to PBS. Recombinant α(IV)NC1 domains (25 μg/ml) were immobilized on 48-well non-tissue culture-treated plates as described previously (37.Brooks P.C. Klemke R.L. Schön S. Lewis J.M.

The coating efficiency of all six NC1 domains was essentially equal as measured by both total protein BCA and anti-FLAG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (data not shown). Wells were washed and incubated with 1% BSA in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. Subconfluent HUVECs were harvested, washed, and resuspended in adhesion buffer containing RPMI 1640 medium, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm MnCl2, and 0.5% BSA. HUVECs (1 × 105) resuspended in 200 μl of the adhesion buffer were added to each well and allowed to attach for 30 min at 37 °C. Function-blocking antibodies were added to the adhesion buffer at a final concentration of 25 μg/ml. The nonattached cells were removed by washing, and the attached cells were stained for 10 min with crystal violet as described (37.Brooks P.C. Klemke R.L. Schön S. Lewis J.M.

Cells (HUVEC and CS1 melanoma) were plated in 6-well culture plates (25,000 cells/well) in the presence or absence of recombinant NC1 domains at concentration of 1, 10, and 30 μg/ml.

Cell counts were determined every 24 h up to 7 days with the use of a hemacytometer. Angiogenesis was induced on chick chorioallantoic membranes (CAMs) of 10-day-old chick embryos by placing a filter disc containing either bFGF (1 μg/ml) or VEGF (1 μg/ml) (approximately 20 μl/disc) on the CAMs in an area that was reduced in the number of pre-existing blood vessels as described previously (40.Brooks P.C. Montgomery A.M.P. Cheresh D.A. Howlett A.R. Methods in Molecular Biology: Integrin Protocols. 129. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1999: 257-269Google Scholar). The embryos were treated with a single intravenous injection of recombinant α(IV)NC1 domain (1.0–30.0 μg) in a total volume of 100 μl of sterile PBS. The embryos were allowed to incubate for a total of 3 days at which time the filter discs and surrounding CAM tissue were excised, washed, and analyzed. Angiogenesis was quantified by determining the number of branching blood vessels at a fixed focal length within the confined region of the filter disc by observers unaware of the experimental conditions. Angiogenesis was expressed as an angiogenic index, which was calculated as the mean number of blood vessel branches from experimental treated CAMs minus that of the control CAMs in the absence of cytokine (40.Brooks P.C. Montgomery A.M.P. Cheresh D.A. Howlett A.R. Methods in Molecular Biology: Integrin Protocols. 129. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1999: 257-269Google Scholar). Angiogenesis experiments were completed three to five times with 5 to 15 embryos per condition. Single cell suspensions of CS1 melanoma (5 × 106 per embryo), HT1080 fibrosarcoma (4 × 105 per embryo), or B16 melanoma cells (5 × 106 per embryo) were applied in a total volume of 40 μl of RPMI 1640 to the CAMs of 10-day-old chick embryos (41.Brooks P.C. Silletti S. von Schalscha T.L. Friedlander M. Cheresh D.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 391-400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours later, the embryos received a single intravenous injection of recombinant NC1 domains (30.0 μg) in a total volume of 100 μl. Tumors were allowed to grow for a total of 7 days, the resulting tumors were removed and trimmed free of surrounding CAM tissue, and wet weights were determined. Tumor experiments were performed three to four times with 5 to 15 embryos per condition. Biopsies of human malignant melanoma and bladder carcinoma were embedded in OCT and snap frozen as described previously (42.Brooks P.C. Strömblad S. Klemke R. Visscher D. Sarkar F.H. Cheresh D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1815-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). Tumor sections (4.0 μm) were incubated with 1.0% BSA in PBS for 2 h at 37 °C to block nonspecific binding sites. Following washes, the tissue sections were co-stained with a polyclonal antibody directed to Factor VIII-related antigen (1:100) and a mAb directed to the α2(IV)NC1 domain (1:500) in 1.0% PBS-BSA. The slides were allowed to incubate for 2 h at room temperature. The tissues were washed five times with PBS for 5 min each followed by incubation with rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgGs for 1 h at 37 °C. Tissue sections were washed as above and mounted with fluoromount anti-fade reagent and sealed. Photographs were taken with an Olympus microscope fitted with epifluorescence at 200× magnification as described previously (42.Brooks P.C. Strömblad S. Klemke R. Visscher D. Sarkar F.H. Cheresh D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1815-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). Tumor-associated angiogenesis was quantified by counting the number of branching blood vessels within a fixed focal length that were associated with the surface of the tumors as described previously (43.Brooks P.C. Clark R.A.F. Cheresh D.A. Science. 1994; 264: 569-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (2741) Google Scholar). Vessel counts were made with the use of a stereo microscope and were completed for both the upper and lower surfaces of each tumor within a fixed focal length. Blood vessel counts were expressed as the mean number of surface vessels per tumor. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test for unpaired samples or the Wilcoxon signed rank test. p values less than 0.05 were considered significant. Six genetically distinct collagen chains have been identified that can be organized into a number of specific triple helical collagen type IV molecules (Fig.1). The formation of supramolecular networks of collagen type IV involves unique interactions between amino-terminal 7 S domains resulting in tetramers and between NC1 domains at the carboxyl terminus forming hexameric structures (Fig. 1). Interestingly, the NC1 domain is also thought to regulate individual chain selection as well as lateral association of individual collagen molecules during matrix assembly (17.Siebold B. Qian R.A. Glanville R.W. Hofmann H. Deutzmann R. Kühn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 168: 569-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 18.Ries A. Engel J. Lustig A. Kühn K. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2467-2473Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Recent studies, however, suggest that collagen IV NC1 domains may also promote cellular interactions (44.Tsilibary E.C. Reger L.A. Vogel A.M. Koliakos G.G. Anderson S.S. Charonis A.S. Alegre J.N. Furcht L.T. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1583-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 45.Setty S. Kim Y. Fields G.B.

Therefore, we evaluated whether specific NC1 domains from collagen IV could interact with human endothelial cells. To facilitate these studies recombinant forms of all six genetically distinct human α(IV)NC1 domains were generated; the amino acid sequences are provided in Table I.Table ISequence of recombinant human collagen type IV NC1 domainsAmino acid sequences for the six NC1 domain recombinant fusion proteins of human collagen IV.

The remaining sequences represent the FLAG Tag sequence for each fusion protein. The arrow indicates the RGD site, a known amino acid binding sequence for αAβBintegrin. To assess the ability of these domains to interact with endothelial cells, they were immobilized on microtiter wells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells were allowed to attach for 30 min. As shown in Fig. 2 A, α3 and α6 NC1 domains supported endothelial cell adhesion. Interestingly, α2 also promoted cell adhesion but was less potent. In contrast, α1, α4, and α5 showed little if any adhesion promoting ability. To further examine endothelial cell interactions with α(IV)NC1 domains, the capacity of these collagen domains to support endothelial cell migration was evaluated by the well established method using Transwell™ migration chambers (37.Brooks P.C.

Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 441-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2 B, human endothelial cells migrated on NC1 α2, α3, and α6, whereas little if any migration was seen on α1, α4, or α5. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that specific NC1 domains can directly interact with human endothelial cells yet differ significantly in their capacity to promote both adhesion and migration. The integrin family of cell adhesion receptors has been shown to mediate cellular interactions with the ECM (46.Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9014) Google Scholar). However, little is known concerning the roles of integrins in the cellular interactions with NC1 domains of collagen. Thus, we examined the possibility that specific members of this family may directly bind the α(IV)NC1 domains. To test this possibility, recombinant α(IV)NC1 domains capable of supporting cellular adhesion and migration were immobilized on microtiter wells and human endothelial cells were allowed to interact in the presence or absence of specific function-blocking anti-integrin antibodies. As shown in Fig.3 A, human endothelial cells attached to immobilized α2(IV)NC1. Surprisingly, this cell attachment depended in large part on integrin αvβ3, because anti-αvβ3 mAb (LM609) inhibited cell adhesion by over 90%. Interestingly, α2 NC1 does not contain the classical RGD tripeptide sequence recognized by αvβ3 (Table I), suggesting the existence of a novel non-RGD αvβ3 binding site. Endothelial cell interactions with α2(IV)NC1 were also partially inhibited by the function-blocking mAb (P1F6) directed to the αvβ5 heterodimer (34.Wayner E.A. Orlando R.A. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 919-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) and a mAb (P4C10) that blocks the function of β1-containing integrins (34.Wayner E.A. Orlando R.A. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 919-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), suggesting the involvement of αvβ5 and other β1 integrin receptors. To determine which β1 integrins were involved in cellular interactions with α2(IV)NC1, we examined endothelial cell adhesion in the presence or absence of function-blocking antibodies directed to specific β1 integrins. As shown in Fig. 3 B, mAb directed to α3 inhibited cellular interactions with α2(IV)NC1 by approximately 50%, whereas mAbs directed to α1 and α2 integrins showed little effect. These findings suggest a role for α3β1 integrin in this interaction. To determine whether integrin receptors were also involved in mediating endothelial cell interactions with α3(IV)NC1 and α6(IV)NC1, similar experiments were perform"
https://openalex.org/W2092250096,"The membrane topology of the human Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 1 (NHE1) was assessed by substituted cysteine accessibility analysis. Eighty-three cysteine residues were individually introduced into a functional cysteineless NHE1, and these mutants were expressed in the exchanger-deficient PS120 cells. The topological disposition of introduced cysteines was determined by labeling with a biotinylated maleimide in the presence or absence of preincubation with the membrane-impermeable sulfhydryl reagent, 2-trimethylammoniumethyl-methanethiosulfonate in streptolysin O-permeabilized or nonpermeabilized cells. We proposed a new model for the topology of NHE1 that is significantly different from the model derived from hydropathy analysis. In this model, NHE1 is composed of 12 transmembrane segments (TMs) with the N and C termini located in the cytosol. The large, last extracellular loop in the membrane domain of the original model was suggested to comprise an intracellular loop, a new transmembrane segment (TM11), and an extracellular loop in the new model. Interestingly, cysteines at 183 and 184 and at 324 and 325 mapped to intracellular loops connecting TMs 4 and 5 (IL2) and TMs 8 and 9 (IL4), respectively, were accessible to sulfhydryl reagents from the outside. Furthermore, exchange activities of two mutants, R180C and Q181C, within IL2 were markedly inhibited by external MTSET. These data suggest that part of IL2 or IL4 may be located in a pore-lining region that is accessible from either side of the membrane and involved in ion transport.

Although these isoforms differ in tissue localization, sensitivity of inhibitors, and mode of regulation, they have a similar overall structure consisting of an N-terminal membrane domain (∼500 amino acids) and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (∼300 amino acids). The former catalyzes an amiloride-sensitive Na+/H+ exchange, while the latter functions as a regulatory domain (9.Wakabayashi S. Fafournoux P. Sardet C. Pouysségur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Previous biochemical and molecular studies have provided important information about the structure-function of the cytoplasmic domain of NHE1 (2.Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. Pouysségur J. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 51-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). We have recently found that the cytoplasmic domain consists of at least four distinct functional subdomains in terms of pHisensitivity, some of which are involved in the regulation of the exchanger by cytosolic Ca2+, protein phosphorylation, and cell ATP (10.Bertrand B. Wakabayashi S. Ikeda T. Pouysségur J. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13703-13709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Wakabayashi S. Bertrand B. Ikeda T. Pouysségur J.

(Tokyo). 1997; 121: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). On the other hand, little is known about the structure of the N-terminal membrane domain of NHE1, which precludes the clarification of the mechanism for ion exchange and the interaction between the cytoplasmic domain and the ion transport pathway in the membrane domain. The N-terminal membrane domain is highly conserved (70% overall identity) among NHE isoforms and is predicted to span the lipid bilayer 10–12 times. A 12-transmembrane segment (TM) model predicted by hydropathy analysis of NHE1 according to the Kyte-Doolittle algorithm (13.Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17093) Google Scholar) is shown in Fig. 1. The N-terminal region including TM1 is believed without experimental evidence to be cleaved off as a signal peptide, because its amino acid sequence is highly variable among NHE isoforms. In the human NHE1, evidence was presented showing that N-glycosylation occurs in the first putative extracellular loop (14.Counillon L. Pouysségur J. Reithmeier R.A.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10463-10469Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a recent chymotryptic cleavage experiment suggested that some other extracellular loops in the membrane domain of NHE1 are not fully exposed on the extracellular surface (15.Shrode L.D. Gan B.S. D'Souza S.J.A. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C431-C439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Clearly, more systematic analysis of the topology of the exchanger molecule is required. In this study, to map the transmembrane topology of NHE1, we determined the accessibility of 83 cysteine residues introduced into a cysteineless form of NHE1 (designated “Cys-less NHE1”) to cysteine-directed reagents, biotin maleimide and MTSET, in normal and permeabilized cells (16.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 17.Grunewald M. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. Neuron. 1998; 21: 623-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The former reagent is almost membrane-impermeable and covalently labels cysteine residues with a biotin group that is readily detectable by the use of streptavidin-biotin chemistry. The latter is membrane-impermeable and used to block the biotinylation. Based on the detailed analysis, we proposed a new topology model of NHE1, which consists of 12-transmembrane segments with the N and C termini located in the cytosol. We found that some introduced cysteines within the intracellular loops are also accessible from the outside, suggesting that residues at these positions may be part of the ion transport pathway. Biotin maleimide was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). MTSET and streptavidin-conjugated agarose were purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals Inc. and Pierce, respectively. Streptolysin O (SLO) was obtained from Sigma. The amiloride derivative, 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride (EIPA) was a gift from New Drug Research Laboratories of Kanebo, Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). 22NaCl was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. A NHE1-specific polyclonal antibody (RP-cd) was described previously (10.Bertrand B. Wakabayashi S. Ikeda T. Pouysségur J. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13703-13709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All other chemicals were of the highest purity available. The Na+/H+ exchanger-deficient cell line (PS120) (18.Pouysségur J. Sardet C. Franchi A. L'Allemain G. Paris S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4833-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) kindly provided by Dr. J. Pouysségur (Nice, France) and the corresponding transfectants were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 25 mmNaHCO3 and supplemented with 7.5% (v/v) fetal calf serum, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. PS120 cells (5 × 105 cells/100-mm dish) were transfected with each plasmid construct (20 μg) by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation technique. Cell populations that stably express mutant NHE1 were selected by a “H+ killing” procedure as described (9.Wakabayashi S. Fafournoux P. Sardet C. Pouysségur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Among 89 substituted cysteine mutants, stable transfectants for six mutants (see Fig. 9) were not obtained. The plasmid carrying cDNA coding for the Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE1 human isoform) containing some unique restriction sites (pEAP-Δ5′AN) was described previously (19.Wakabayashi S. Ikeda T. Iwamoto T. Pouysségur J. Shigekawa M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12854-12861Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In this study, we introduced several additional unique restriction sites into pEAP-Δ5′AN by a polymerase chain reaction-based construction strategy as described previously (11.Wakabayashi S. Bertrand B. Ikeda T. Pouysségur J. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13710-13715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid contained multiple unique sites for XhoI,AatII, KpnI, Bsu36I, AccI,SacII, AflII, NdeI, andApaI at the positions corresponding to amino acids 126, 159, 179, 358, 503, 599, 635, 658, and 698 of NHE1, respectively. For the construction of cDNA for Cys-less NHE1, we synthesized the oligonucleotide sense and antisense primers in which nucleotides corresponding to cysteine were changed to those for alanine. Using these mutant primers and appropriate external primers, the DNA fragments were generated by polymerase chain reaction, digested, and inserted into appropriate sites of the modified plasmid. We finally replaced nine cysteine residues with alanine. Furthermore, we introduced single cysteine residues into this Cys-less NHE1 (see Fig.1) using a similar polymerase chain reaction-based method. DNA sequences of polymerase chain reaction fragments were confirmed with a Perkin-Elmer ABI model 373S autosequencer. Biotin maleimide labeling of the NHE1 mutant molecules was carried out as described previously (16.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar,17.Grunewald M. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. Neuron. 1998; 21: 623-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) with modification. Confluent cells cultured on 60-mm dishes were washed twice with 5 ml of PBSCM (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mmMgCl2 at pH 7.2) and incubated in 1 ml of PBSCM containing 0 or 5 mm MTSET for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with 5 ml of PBSCM and then incubated in 1 ml of PBSCM containing 0.05 or 0.5 mm biotin maleimide (100 mm stock in Me2SO) for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed once with PBSCM containing 1% 2-mercaptoethanol and once with PBSCM and collected in the tube by centrifugation. Cells were solubilized with 1 ml of the lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mmHepes/Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm benzamidine. After centrifugation for 10 min at 15,000 rpm, the supernatant was mixed with streptavidin-agarose beads (30 μl of resin) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with mild agitation. Agarose beads were washed more than five times with 1 ml of lysis buffer, mixed with 50 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 3% SDS, and boiled for 10 min at 100 °C. The proteins were separated on an 8.5% gel by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by the immunoblot with the NHE1 antibody as described previously (10.Bertrand B. Wakabayashi S. Ikeda T. Pouysségur J. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13703-13709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The blots were developed using the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). When indicated, cells were permeabilized with SLO (Sigma) immediately before the biotinylation, as described previously (17.Grunewald M. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. Neuron. 1998; 21: 623-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Before the experiment, an aliquot of the SLO stock solution (25,000 units/ml of water) was diluted 70-fold into SLO buffer containing 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 115 mm potassium acetate, and 25 mm Hepes/KOH (pH 7.4), and the diluted solution was kept on ice for at least 10 min. Cells were washed twice with SLO buffer and then incubated for 15 min on ice in 1 ml of the above SLO-containing solution. Cells were washed twice with 5 ml of ice-cold SLO buffer and then incubated with 5 ml of prewarmed SLO buffer for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed with SLO buffer and then with PBSCM, which was followed by the biotinylation step. 22Na+ uptake activity and its pHi dependence were measured by K+/nigericin pHi clamp method (12.Ikeda T. Schmitt B. Pouysségur J. Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Serum-depleted cells in 24-well dishes were preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C in Na+-free choline chloride/KCl medium containing 20 mm Hepes/Tris (pH 7.4), 1.2–140 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, and 5 μm nigericin. Choline chloride was added to medium to maintain the total concentration of KCl plus choline chloride at 140 mm. 22Na+ uptake was started by adding the same choline chloride/KCl solution containing22NaCl (37 kBq/ml) (final concentration, 1 mm), 1 mm ouabain, and 100 μm bumetanide. In some wells, the uptake solution contained 0.1 mm EIPA. After 1 min, cells were rapidly washed four times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline to terminate 22Na+uptake. pHi was calculated from the imposed [K+] gradient by assuming the equilibrium [K+]i/[K+]o = [H+]i/[H+]o and an intracellular [K+] of 120 mm. As indicated, cells were washed three times with PBSCM and incubated with 10 mm MTSET for 30 min at room temperature before the22Na+ uptake measurement. Protein concentration was measured by the bicinchoninic assay system (Pierce Chemical Co.) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. In this study, we first characterized Cys-less NHE1 expressed in the exchanger-deficient PS120 cells. Fig. 2 A shows pHi dependence of 22Na+ uptake in cells expressing the wild-type and Cys-less mutant exchangers. Cys-less NHE1 exhibited a high 22Na+ uptake activity (>40 nmol/mg/min) similar to the wild-type, and the pK values for both exchangers were found to be similar (∼6.7). Hill coefficients were also similar (1.22 or 1.25 for the wild-type or Cys-less NHE1). Fig.2 B shows the concentration dependence of EIPA on22Na+ uptake by both exchangers, which gave similar IC50 values (60–80 nm). The amounts of the exchanger proteins expressed were also similar (Fig.2 C). Thus, Cys-less NHE1 is fully functional and has almost the same basic properties as the wild-type NHE1. We compared the biotinylation efficiency among the wild-type, Cys-less, and other mutant exchangers that were well expressed in PS120 cells (Fig. 2 C). Cells were incubated with 0.05 or 0.5 mm biotin maleimide, and biotinylated proteins were subsequently recovered with streptavidin-agarose. After SDS-PAGE, the biotinylated exchangers were visualized by immunoblot analysis with an anti-NHE1 antibody (Fig. 2 D). As expected, recovery of the Cys-less NHE1 protein was minimal, indicating that the mutant was only slightly labeled with externally applied biotin maleimide. In contrast, heavy antibody staining was observed for the cysteine-substituted mutant E151C, indicating its strong biotinylation (Fig. 2 D). We observed very weak labeling of the wild-type and M-Cys-less NHE1. In the latter mutant, we replaced 6 endogenous cysteine residues in the N-terminal membrane domain with alanine while retaining 3 endogenous cysteines in the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. Thus, the endogenous cysteine residues in the N-terminal membrane domain are not accessible from the external surface, and a relatively low concentration (0.5 mm) of biotin maleimide is virtually membrane-impermeable under the conditions used. We introduced 15 cysteine residues individually into the putative first extracellular loop. All of the mutants were well expressed in PS120 cells (Fig. 3,A and C). We observed two forms of the exchanger with a high (∼110 kDa) or low (∼90 kDa) apparent molecular mass that are thought to be the mature proteins with N- andO-linked glycosylation or immature proteins containing onlyN-linked high mannose oligosaccharide, respectively (14.Counillon L. Pouysségur J. Reithmeier R.A.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10463-10469Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Mutant exchangers with a high molecular weight were labeled with externally applied biotin maleimide (Fig. 3, B andD). In addition, an aggregated form of the exchanger was also biotinylated. We found that these mutant exchangers were biotinylated with variable efficiency. For example, H35C, S56C, T79C, and H81C were strongly biotinylated, while S40C, T68C, R72C, and H76C were only weakly labeled. Preincubation of cells with the membrane-impermeable SH modifier MTSET significantly reduced the biotinylation of all these mutants, indicating that substituted cysteines are accessible to external MTSET. However, the variable efficiency of biotinylation suggests that the first extracellular loop may form a structure in which some amino acid residues are not readily accessible to biotin maleimide. We introduced 3, 5, 8, and 12 cysteine residues into the putative second, third, fourth, and fifth extracellular loops, respectively (see Fig. 1). These mutants were well expressed in PS120 cells (data not shown). The mutants for the putative second, third, and fourth extracellular loops were all strongly labeled with biotin maleimide, which was significantly reduced by preincubation with MTSET (Fig.4, A–C). In the putative fifth loop, all of the mutants were strongly biotinylated in a MTSET-sensitive manner (Fig. 4 D). However, some mutants (E368C, S375C, H376C, and T377C) were less sensitive to MTSET (Fig.4 D), suggesting that the fifth extracellular loop may form a structure in which some amino acid residues are not readily accessible to MTSET. K384C and S388C were not labeled with biotin maleimide from either side of the membrane (data not shown). Thus substituted cysteines except for those at positions 384 and 388 in these putative loops are exposed to extracellular medium. We introduced 2, 5, 4, 6, and 3 cysteine residues into the putative intracellular loops connecting TMs 2 and 3 (IL1), TMs 4 and 5 (IL2), TMs 6 and 7 (IL3), TMs 8 and 9 (IL4), and TMs 10 and 11 (IL5), respectively (see Fig. 1). These mutants were well expressed in PS120 cells (data not shown). The mutants for IL1–IL4, i.e.S126C, S127C, F182C, E184C, E248C, I249C, H250C, and I251C were not labeled or were only faintly labeled with biotin maleimide both in the presence and absence of MTSET (see E151C for positive control) (Fig.5, A–D). The other mutants, R180C, Q181C, S320C, R321C, and F322C, were slightly labeled without change with MTSET. Thus, these cysteines are not readily accessible to biotin maleimide applied from the outside. In contrast, cysteine mutants for IL5 (H407C, H408C, and W409C) were typically labeled with externally applied biotin maleimide in a MTSET-sensitive manner (Fig.5 E), indicating that these three positions are accessible from external medium. In order to test if substituted cysteines not readily accessible from the outside in Fig. 5 are accessible from the cytosol, we permeabilized cells with streptolysin O. As shown in Fig.6 A, cell permeabilization extensively increased the biotinylation of M-Cys-less NHE1 that contains three endogenous cysteines in the cytoplasmic domain. However, the same treatment did not enhance the biotinylation of Cys-less NHE1 and E151C (data not shown). The streptolysin O treatment also increased biotinylation of R180C, Q181C, F182C, E248C, I249C, H250C, T251C, R321C, or R323C, each of which was inhibited by preincubation with MTSET (Fig. 6, B–D; data not shown for some mutants). The data suggest that these substituted cysteines are accessible from the cytosol. In contrast, two mutants, S126C (data not shown) and S127C (Fig. 6 A), were not labeled even in permeabilized cells, suggesting that these residues may be embedded in the lipid bilayer and thus inaccessible from either side of the membrane. Intriguingly, we found that T183C was strongly biotinylated in a MTSET-sensitive manner in nonpermeabilized cells (Fig. 5 B), although biotinylation of R180C and Q181C was strongly enhanced by the streptolysin O treatment as stated above (Fig. 6 B). Similar aberrant biotinylation occurred in nonpermeabilized cells expressing T323C, S324C, or H325C (Fig. 5 D), although the labeling is not so strong. The data suggest that these cysteines are accessible from outside, despite their suggested intracellular localization. We next determined the localization of the N terminus by utilizing a cysteine mutant designated C8*, in which 8 endogenous cysteines except for the most N-terminal one (see Fig. 1) were replaced by alanine. C8* was strongly biotinylated in a MTSET-sensitive manner only after cells were permeabilized (Fig. 6 E), suggesting that the N terminus is localized in the cytosol. We had a particular interest in the last putative extracellular loop, not only because a previous report (15.Shrode L.D. Gan B.S. D'Souza S.J.A. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C431-C439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that this region may not be fully exposed to the outside but also because our preliminary study revealed that mutation of some residues within this region was able to alter the function of NHE1 (e.g. see K472C in Fig. 8). We introduced 26 cysteines individually into this region. All of the single cysteine mutants except for K438C, R440C, I451C, G456C, and R458C were well expressed in PS120 cells (Fig. 7 A, but data not shown for some mutants) and fully functional (see Fig.8). The mutants with extremely reduced exchange activity did not produce stable transfectants, suggesting that the native residues at these positions might be important for the ion transport or expression of the exchanger in the plasma membrane.Figure 7Biotinylation of single cysteine mutants for the last putative extracellular loop. A–C, nonpermeabilized cells expressing Cys-less NHE1 or single cysteine mutants were treated with biotin maleimide in the presence or absence of preincubation with MTSET as described in the legend to Fig. 3. Total cell lysate (40 μg) (A) or the proteins recovered with streptavidin-agarose (B and C) were separated by SDS-PAGE, and mutant NHE1 proteins were visualized by immunoblot analysis with the NHE1 antibody. D, cells expressing indicated mutants were treated with or without 350 units/ml of SLO and then incubated with biotin maleimide in the presence or absence of preincubation with MTSET as described in the legend to Fig. 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We found that in nonpermeabilized cells, 14 single cysteine mutants (from K447C to S464C) were not efficiently labeled with biotin maleimide in the absence or presence of external MTSET (Fig. 7,B and C). However, four mutants, K471C, K472C, H473C, and F474C, in the C-terminal portion of the last putative extracellular loop (see Fig. 1) were biotinylated in nonpermeabilized cells in a MTSET-sensitive manner (Fig. 7 C), indicating that these cysteines are accessible from the outside. In contrast, the labeling of K443C, K447C, and D448C in the N-terminal portion of the last putative extracellular loop (see Fig. 1) was strongly enhanced by treatment with streptolysin O (Fig. 7 D), indicating the accessibility of these cysteines from the inside. The streptolysin O treatment did not increase the biotinylation of Q449C (Fig.7 D) and other mutants, F450C to S464C (data not shown). These results suggest that the region from Gln449 to Ser464 are not accessible from both extracellular and intracellular biotin maleimide. Thus, the last putative extracellular loop appears to consist of an intracellular loop, a transmembrane segment, and an extracellular loop. We investigated the effect of externally applied MTSET (10 mm) on22Na+ uptake by almost all functional cysteine mutants (Fig. 8). We found that uptake activities of many mutants were not affected by MTSET. However, a slight but significant MTSET-dependent inhibition of activity was observed in P153C, A281C, N282C, H373C, and K471C (activity decreased to 82 ± 2, 91 ± 3, 87 ± 3, 77 ± 3, and 89 ± 3% of control, respectively, after MTSET treatment). These cysteine mutants were labeled in nonpermeabilized cells with biotin maleimide in a MTSET-sensitive manner (see above). Intriguingly, MTSET markedly inhibited uptake activities of R180C and Q181C (residual activity of 32 ± 4 and 39 ± 10%, respectively, after MTSET treatment), indicating that these two cysteines are accessible to externally added MTSET. Of note, these substituted cysteines were not efficiently labeled in nonpermeabilized cells with biotin maleimide in an MTSET-sensitive manner (Fig. 5 B). Thus, the loop between TM4 and TM5 could be involved in the ion transport. In this study, we have utilized the reactivity of introduced cysteines toward biotinylating reagent to determine the membrane topology of NHE1. This approach has been used to determine the topology of human P-glycoprotein (16.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) and several other transporters (17.Grunewald M. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. Neuron. 1998; 21: 623-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 20.Fujinaga J. Tang X-B. Casey J.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 12675-12681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We found that externally applied biotin maleimide did not virtually label the wild-type, Cys-less, and M-Cys-less NHE1 (Figs. 2,C and D) but strongly labeled M-Cys-less NHE1, in which 3 native cysteines were retained in the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain, when cells were permeabilized (Fig. 6 A). These results confirmed the previous observations (16.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) that this reagent is relatively membrane-impermeable and highly cysteine-directed if it is used in low concentrations (0.5 mm). Therefore, labeling with biotin maleimide in a manner sensitive to the membrane-impermeable MTSET primarily defines the introduced cysteine as being exposed on the cell surface, while similar labeling with biotin maleimide only in permeabilized cells defines the cysteines as being localized intracellularly. Using Cys-less NHE1, we introduced single cysteine residues into the regions of the exchanger modeled to be localized extracellularly or intracellularly from hydropathy analysis. Cys-less NHE1 has basic properties similar to the wild-type NHE1 in that it was highly expressed in the transfectants and exhibited Na+/H+ exchange activity comparable with that of the wild-type exchanger (Figs. 2 A and 8). In addition, both Cys-less and wild-type exchangers exhibited essentially the same pHi and EIPA concentration dependences of exchange activity (Fig. 2, A and B). We found that most of single cysteine mutants exhibited relatively high exchange activity (Fig. 8), although stable transfectants could not be obtained with some mutants. We observed two bands reactive with the NHE1-antibody in the transfected cells (Figs. 3 A and 7 A),i.e. high and low molecular weight forms of the exchanger that are thought to be the mature proteins with N- andO-linked glycosylation or the immature proteins only containing high mannose oligosaccharide, respectively (14.Counillon L. Pouysségur J. Reithmeier R.A.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10463-10469Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). As expected, in most of the cases, the cysteine residues introduced into the putative extracellular loops were strongly labeled with biotin maleimide only in the high molecular weight form of the exchanger. However, the low molecular weight form of NHE1 was also slightly biotinylated in some cases (e.g. see Fig. 4 D). Although we do not know the precise reason for that, it is possible that part of the lower form is expressed in the plasma membrane under some conditions. Fig. 9 shows a new topological model of NHE1 predicted on the basis of the present results. The model consists of 12 TMs and intracellular and extracellular loops connecting TMs with both the N and C termini located in the cytoplasm. Interestingly, a 12-TM model with the intracellular N and C termini has been proposed for a Na+/H+ antiporter of Escherichia coli (22.Rothman A. Padan E. Shuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32288-32292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The assignment of TM1 to TM9 of NHE1 in the new model is not different from that in the original hydropathy model (Fig. 1). We could not obtain evidence for the existence of the intracellular loop connecting TM2 and TM3 (IL1), because the introduced cysteines at positions 126 (data not shown) and 127 (Fig. 6 A) were not labeled in permeabilized as well as in nonpermeabilized cells. However, since the hydrophobic region of amino acids 105–150 is long enough to span the lipid bilayer twice, we consider this hydrophobic region to form TM2 and TM3. The transmembrane disposition of TM10 to TM12 of the original model is extensively modified in the new model. We found that introduced cysteines at positions 373–377, 381, and 407–409 were accessible from the outside. The intervening hydrophobic stretch of amino acids 385–406, which mostly corresponds to TM10 of the original model, is not long enough to span the lipid bilayer twice if it forms an α-helix. Because two mutants, K384C and S388C, were not labeled with biotin maleimide from either side of the membrane (see “Results”), we tentatively placed most of this hydrophobic segment within the lipid bilayer. Cysteines at positions 471–474 in the last extracellular loop of the original model were labeled with biotin maleimide from the outside in a MTSET-sensitive manner, while cysteines at positions 443, 447, and 448 were labeled from the inside. Thus, the hydrophobic stretch of amino acids 449–470 appears to cross the lipid bilayer with an inside to outside orientation. Such an interpretation is consistent with our finding that introduced cysteines in this region were not readily biotinylated from either side of the membrane (Fig. 7,B and C). Since cysteine at position 448, but not that at position 449, was biotinylated from the inside, the new TM11 could start from Gln449 (Fig. 7 D). The N terminus has been predicted to be cleaved off as a signal peptide at a site somewhere before the glycosylation sites in the first extracellular loop. A typical structure of the signal peptide has three distinct domains, i.e. an N-terminal positively charged region (1–5 residues long); a central, hydrophobic region (7–15 residues); and a more polar C-terminal region (3–7 residues long) (23.von Heijne G. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 115: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). Although NHE1 was indeed predicted to possess a signal peptide, 2Prediction of the signal peptide was made on the World Wide Web. cleavage of the N terminus of NHE1 has not yet been experimentally proven. We observed that all of the introduced cysteines in the first extracellular loop were biotinylated in a MTSET-sensitive manner (Fig. 3, B andD), suggesting that these residues including cysteine at position 35 near the extracellular interface of TM1 were retained in the mature NHE1 protein. Furthermore, mutant C8* was labeled only after cells were permeabilized (Fig. 6 E), suggesting that Cys8 is also retained in the mature protein and localized in the cytosol. It is therefore most likely that NHE1 is not cleaved during protein processing, unless introduced individual cysteines somehow prevent the cleavage of protein by signal peptidases. Thus, the central hydrophobic stretch in the N-terminal signal peptide-like structure is likely to form the first transmembrane α-helix. As described above, we observed that M-Cys-less NHE1 containing three endogenous cysteines (amino acids 538, 561, and 794) were labeled with biotin maleimide only after cells were permeabilized (Fig.6 A). This result is consistent with much previous biochemical data showing that most of the C-terminal domain of NHE1 (∼300 amino acids) is located intracellularly (10.Bertrand B. Wakabayashi S. Ikeda T. Pouysségur J. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13703-13709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Sardet C. Counillon L. Franchi A. Pouysségur J.

Recently, Shrode et al. (15.Shrode L.D. Gan B.S. D'Souza S.J.A. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C431-C439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that hemagglutinin epitope tagged at the C-terminal end of NHE1 can be recognized by the hemagglutinin-specific antibody only after cells expressing NHE1-hemagglutinin are permeabilized. All these results strongly suggest that the C-terminal tail (amino acids 500–815) of NHE1 is entirely located intracellularly, which is in contrast to the recent report that part of the C terminus of NHE3 is exposed on the extracellular side (27.Biemesderfer D. DeGray B. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12391-12396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We found that cysteines at positions 180–182 were readily biotinylated from the inside but not from the outside (Figs. 5 B and6 B). This suggests that these positions are accessible from the inside. Intriguingly, however, 22Na+ uptake by two mutants R180C and Q181C was strongly inhibited by externally applied MTSET (Fig. 8), suggesting that these residues are accessible from the outside. We also found that cysteine at position 183 was strongly biotinylated from the outside in a MTSET-sensitive manner (Fig. 5 B). These data suggest that at least a portion of the loop connecting TM4 and TM5 (IL2) is localized within the membrane, raising an intriguing possibility that it could form a structure lining the aqueous pore that is accessible from either side of the membrane and involved in the ion transport. As described above, cysteines at positions 180 and 181 are accessible to MTSET from the outside as evidenced by its inhibition of 22Na+ uptake but were not readily accessible to biotin maleimide from the same side. Such a difference in the accessibility may simply reflect the difference in the reagent size, because biotin maleimide is much bulkier than MTSET. It is important to note that TM4 has been suggested to contain part of the amiloride-binding site (28.Counillon L. Franchi A. Pouysségur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4508-4512Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Single amino acid substitutions at Phe161 and Leu163 within the160VFFLFLLPPI169 segment of TM4 were initially found to cause reduction of the amiloride sensitivity (29.Counillon L. Noël J. Reithmeier R.A.F. Pouysségur J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2951-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), while more recently the G174S mutation in the adjacent region in TM4 was also found to cause reduction in the amiloride affinity (29.Counillon L. Noël J. Reithmeier R.A.F. Pouysségur J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2951-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Double mutant L163F/G174S exhibited markedly reduced affinity not only for amiloride (or its derivatives) but also for Na+ (29.Counillon L. Noël J. Reithmeier R.A.F. Pouysségur J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2951-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These previous results fit nicely with the present results and together support the view that TM4 and the adjacent loop (IL2) may form part of an ion transport pathway in the exchanger. As pointed out previously (29.Counillon L. Noël J. Reithmeier R.A.F. Pouysségur J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2951-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), TM4 is a proline-rich segment containing three highly conservative proline residues (Pro167, Pro168, and Pro178). It is likely that these proline residues produce a kink in α-helix, which could create a space to accommodate part of IL2 in the membrane. Cysteines introduced into the putative intracellular loop connecting TM8 and TM9 (IL4) exhibited topological dispositions similar to those in the loop connecting TM4 and TM5 (IL2) in that positions 321 and 323 were accessible from the inside, while positions 324 and 325 were accessible from the outside (Figs. 5 D and 6 D). However, 22Na+ uptake by six cysteine mutants of IL4 was not significantly influenced by external MTSET (Fig. 8). On the other hand, recent molecular studies including one with chimeric exchangers between NHE1 and NHE3 revealed the functional importance of a 66-amino acid segment encompassing IL4, TM9, and EL5 for the interaction of the exchanger with inhibitors such as amiloride derivatives and HOE694 (30.Orlowski J. Kandasamy R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19922-19927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) as well as of His349 in TM9 for the amiloride sensitivity (31.Wang D. Balkovetz D.F. Warnock D.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C392-C402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These previous results, together with our data showing that at least a portion of IL4 is localized within the membrane, raise a possibility that this loop may also be involved in ion transport. Clearly, more detailed analysis is required to clarify the functional importance of the region encompassing IL4 and TM9. In summary, based on the results from cysteine accessibility analysis, we proposed a novel 12-TM model with the N and C termini located in the cytoplasm. This new topology model would provide a basis for the further study of the structure-function relationship of NHE1."

RS domains are also found in proteins that have influence on other aspects of gene expression. Proteins that contain an RS domain are often located in the speckled domains of the nucleus. Here we show that the RS domain derived from a human papillomavirus E2 transcriptional activator can target a heterologous protein to the nucleus, as it does in many other SR proteins, but insufficient for localization in speckles. By using E2 as a bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified a human importin-β family protein that is homologous to yeast Mtr10p and almost identical to human transportin-SR. This transportin-SR2 (TRN-SR2) protein can interact with several cellular SR proteins. More importantly, we demonstrated that TRN-SR2 can directly interact with phosphorylated, but not unphosphorylated, RS domains. Finally, an indirect immunofluoresence study revealed that a transiently expressed TRN-SR2 mutant lacking the N-terminal region becomes localized to the nucleus in a speckled pattern that coincides with the distribution of the SR protein SC35.

Cell. 1998; 1: 243-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Thus, RS domain-containing proteins can function in gene expression at different levels. Cytological studies have revealed that a variety of SR proteins are localized in nuclear speckled domains, which are thought to be the sites for storage/reassembly of splicing factors and/or supplying splicing factors to active genes (10.Spector D. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 229: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 11.Singer R.H. Green M.R. Cell. 1997; 91: 291-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The RS domains of some, but not all, SR proteins have been shown to be necessary and sufficient for targeting to the nuclear speckles (12.Hedley M.L. Amrein H. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11524-11528Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 13.Caceres J.F. Misteli T. Screaton G.R. Spector D.L. Krainer A.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Hyperphosphorylation of the RS domain by SR protein-specific kinases can relocate SR proteins from a speckled pattern into a more diffuse distribution (14.Gui J.F. Lane W.S. Fu X.D.

Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 737-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that a subset of SR proteins can continuously shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (17.Caceres J.F. Screaton G.R. Krainer A.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation states of the RS domain appear to have influence on the shuttling properties of SR proteins (17.Caceres J.F. Screaton G.R. Krainer A.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Thus, the nucleocytoplasmic transport and nuclear speckle localization of SR proteins are likely to be complex and regulated processes. Translocation of macromolecules across the nuclear envelope occurs through the nuclear pore complex (18.Nigg E.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar, 19.Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2721-2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 20.Izaurralde E. Adam S. RNA. 1998; 4: 351-364PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). Proteins targeted for the nucleus are initially complexed with corresponding soluble import receptors in the cytoplasm via specific signal-receptor recognition. Receptor-cargo complexes subsequently dock at saturable sites on the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear pore and then translocate through the pore to the nuclear interior. Nuclear translocation of cargo requires additional factors such as the small GTPase Ran and NTF2 (18.Nigg E.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar, 19.Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2721-2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 20.Izaurralde E. Adam S. RNA. 1998; 4: 351-364PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). Different import cargoes possess different nuclear localization signals (NLSs) (18.Nigg E.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar, 21.Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). The prototypical NLS is composed of one or more clusters of basic amino acid residues and is recognized by importin-α, which functions as an adapter and in turn interacts with importin-β for nuclear pore complex docking. Nonclassic NLSs include the glycine-rich M9 sequence of heteronuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (22.Michael W.M. Choi M. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1995; 83: 415-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar,23.Siomi H. Dreyfuss G. J.

Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1218-1225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Truant R. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1210-1217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the RGG box of the yeast RNA-binding protein Npl3p (26.Pemberton L.F. Rosenblum J.S. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1645-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 27.Senger B. Simos G. Bischoff F.R. Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2196-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). These NLSs, unlike the prototypical NLS, interact directly with their corresponding import receptors. All of the import receptors belong to the importin-β family. They are of similar size (90–130 kDa) and appear to consist of 18 or more helix-turn-helix HEAT repeats as revealed by the crystal structures of two importin-β proteins (28.Chook Y.M. Blobel G. Nature. 1999; 399: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 29.Cingolani G. Petosa C. Weis K. Muller C.W.

It is well known that the N- and C-terminal halves of the importin-β proteins contribute to interaction with GTP-bound Ran and the NLS of cargo, respectively. However, importin-β interactions with Ran and NLS are mutually exclusive, implying the existence of a RanGTP-mediated cargo release mechanism. We previously showed that a RS domain-containing human papillomavirus (type 5) E2 transcriptional activator can function to facilitate the splicing of pre-mRNA made via transactivation by E2 itself (6.Lai M.-C. Teh B.H. Tarn W.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11832-11841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This E2 transactivator colocalizes with cellular splicing factors in nuclear speckles, and its RS-rich hinge domain is required for colocalization (6.Lai M.-C. Teh B.H. Tarn W.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11832-11841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In the present study, we establish that the E2 hinge can target a heterologous protein to the nucleus but not to subnuclear speckle domains. To understand the mechanism of RS domain-mediated nuclear entry and its regulation, we searched for factors that could play a role in the nuclear trafficking of SR proteins. A human importin-β family protein was identified and its interactions with the phosphorylated SR proteins characterized. The β-gal-hinge and β-gal-RS expression vectors were constructed by insertion of a PCR product derived from the entire hinge region (amino acids 212–396) or the RS-rich subdomain (amino acids 212–346) of HPV-5 E2 into the uniqueKpnI site within pCH110 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), respectively. The resulting fusion proteins expressed in HeLa cells can be detected by monoclonal anti-β-gal antibody. The SRPK1 expression vector that produced FLAG-tagged SRPK1 in HeLa cells was kindly provided by X.-D. Fu (University of California, San Diego, CA) (16.Wang H.Y. Lin W. Dyck J.A. Yeakley J.M. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Fu X.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 737-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Plasmid pGST-TRN-SR2C was obtained by subcloning the DNA fragment encoding the C-terminal 399 amino acids of the human TRN-SR2 protein into Escherichia coli expression vector pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The resulting plasmid was used to produce the recombinant GST-TRN-SR2C protein in bacteria. ASF and SRPK1 open reading frames (gifts of X.-D. Fu) were also inserted into pGEX-2T to generate plasmids encoding GST-ASF and GST-SRPK1 fusion proteins, respectively. The pBluescript-derived plasmids encoding full-length and ΔN281 TRN-SR2 were constructed by appropriate restriction digestion of the parental pBluescript plasmid containing a 3.4-kilobase pair TRN-SR2 cDNA (see “Results”) to remove the 5′-untranslated region and 5′-untranslated region plus a region coding for the N-terminal 281 amino acid residues, respectively. The resulting plasmids generated in-frame fusion of TRN-SR2 to the first 34 amino acids of β-gal at the N terminus. Cell culture, transfection, and indirect immunofluorescence staining were performed essentially according to Lai et al. (6.Lai M.-C. Teh B.H. Tarn W.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11832-11841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). For treatment of cells with an RNA pol II inhibitor, transfected cells were incubated with 100 μm DRB for 4 h before fixation. The primary antibodies used included monoclonal anti-β-gal antibody (2 μg/ml; Promega), purified anti-TRN-SR2 antibodies (0.5 μg/ml), monoclonal anti-HA antibody (1:100 dilution from the supernatant of hybridoma culture medium; gift of S.-C. Cheng, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan), polyclonal anti-HA antibodies (1:50 dilution; Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY), and monoclonal anti-SC35 antibody (4.6 μg/ml; Sigma). The secondary antibodies used were fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (7.5 μg/ml; Cappel Laboratories) for monoclonal primary antibodies and rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (12 μg/ml, Cappel Laboratories) for polyclonal primary antibodies. The specimens were observed using a laser confocal microscope (MRC 600 model; Bio-Rad) coupled with an image analysis system. HPV-5 E2 was cloned in frame into the GAL4 DNA binding domain (DB) plasmid pAS2–1 and then used as a bait to screen a HeLa cell cDNA library (CLONTECH) that was constructed in the GAL4 activation domain (AD)-containing pGAD GH vector. Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed as described in the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Initially, the bait plasmid was transformed intoSaccharomyces cerevisiae Y190 and maintained by selection in Trp− plates. The cDNA library was then transformed into the bait-containing yeast cells, and transformants were selected by the use of appropriate media. One of the positive clones, which encoded the C-terminal 399 amino acids of a human importin-β family protein, was named pGAD-TRN-SR2 (see “Results”). To obtain cDNAs encoding full-length TRN-SR2, the insert of pGAD-TRN-SR2 was used as a probe to screen a λZAP cDNA library made from HeLa cells (CLONTECH). The cDNA inserts of positive phage clones were excised into pBluescript phagemids as described in the manufacturer's instruction, and the sequences were then determined by autosequencing. The TRN-SR2 coding sequence matched perfectly to GenBank™ accession number AJ133769. To assay for pairwise interactions between TRN-SR2 and SR proteins, pGAD-TRN-SR2 and a pEG202-derived plasmid expressing individual SR proteins (gifts of J. Y. Wu, Washington University, St. Louis, MO) or domains as LexA fusion proteins were co-transformed into reporter (pSH18–34)-containing EGY48. The method of the liquid β-galactosidase assay was as described in theCLONTECH protocol. To examine whether phosphorylation of the RS domain is important for the TRN-SR2-SR protein interaction, pGAD-TRN-SR2 was co-transformed with pEG-ASF or pEG-SC35 into EGY48, corresponding sky1Δ strain (kind gift of X.-D. Fu; Ref. 31.Yeakley J.M. Tronchere H. Olesen J. Dyck J.A. Wang H.Y. Fu X.D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), or sky1Δ expressing human SRPK1. Expression of SRPK1 was driven by the GPD promoter in the 2 μ plasmid pG-1. A pair of yeast plasmids encoding Gal4 AD-PRP19 and LexA DB-SNT309, respectively, were kindly provided by S.-C. Cheng (32.Chen H.-R. Jan S.-P. Tsao T.Y. Sheu Y.-J. Banroques J. Cheng S.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2196-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and used as control. The recombinant GST-TRN-SR2C protein was overproduced in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography via a glutathione-Sepharose column according to the manufacturer's instruction (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The purified fusion protein was subjected to cleavage by thrombin protease followed by preparative gel electrophoresis. Gel-purified TRN-SR2 C-terminal domain was then used to raise antiserum in rabbits. To purify anti-TRN-SR2 antibodies, antisera were incubated with nitrocellulose containing immobilized GST-TRN-SR2C protein at room temperature overnight. Antibodies were eluted from the filters with a solution containing 50 mm glycine (pH 2.3) and 150 mm NaCl, followed by neutralization with Tris base. His-tagged wild-type Ran and RanQ69L (gifts from I. W. Mattaj, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany) were expressed in E. coli strain BL21/pRep4 and purified on nickel-agarose (Novagen) essentially according to Gorlich et al. (33.Gorlich D. Pante N. Kutay U. Aebi U. Bischoff F.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5584-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Purified Ran and RanQ69L were initially dialyzed against 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 8.7% glycerol, and 0.1 mm GDP (for Ran) or 0.1 mm GTP (for RanQ69L). Before use, they were loaded with 1 mm GDP and GTP, respectively, according to Floer and Blobel (34.Floer M. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16279-16286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). GST-ASF and GST-SRPK1 were overexpressed inE. coli strains BLR and XA90, respectively, upon isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction. The two GST fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose, and then dialyzed against buffer D containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 20% glycerol. Recombinant full-length and ΔN281 TRN-SR2 proteins were expressed in E. coli strain XA90 after induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The extracts were prepared by lysis of cells with modified transport buffer (35.Adam S.A. Sterne-Marr R. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 111: 807-816Crossref Scopus (763) Google Scholar) containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 110 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm sodium acetate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, 8.7% glycerol, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysates were stored in aliquots after removal of cell debris. HeLa cells (strain S3) were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at a density of ∼5 × 105 cells/ml. The cytoplasmic extract was prepared from HeLa cells essentially according to Paschal (36.Paschal B.M. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 2. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1998: 305-313Google Scholar), and finally dialyzed against the transport buffer supplemented with 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin. The concentration of the cytoplasmic extract was ∼28 mg/ml. In vitrophosphorylation of GST-ASF was carried out in a 20-μl mixture containing 2 μg of GST-ASF, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm ATP (or 0.5 mm ATPγS), and 30 ng of GST-SRPK1 at 30 °C for 45 min. ATP was eliminated in the mock-phosphorylation reaction. Subsequently, phosphorylated or mock-phosphorylated GST-ASF was incubated with 35 μl of the HeLa cell cytoplasmic extract (equivalent to ∼1 mg of proteins) in a 60-μl mixture at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction mix was then supplemented with an equal volume of NET-2 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40) and subsequently incubated with 10 μl of glutathione-Sepharose at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were washed extensively with NET-2 buffer. Bound proteins were extracted with SDS lysis buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting with purified anti-TRN-SR2 antibodies. The blot was stripped and then reprobed with mAb 104 to examine phosphorylated GST-ASF. To detect both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated GST-ASF, 1/20 volume each of the samples were fractionated in another SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-GST antibodies. Western blot analysis was performed by using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To test the interaction of GST-ASF with the recombinant TRN-SR2 protein, the pull-down experiments were carried out by using E. coli extract containing full-length or ΔN281 TRN-SR2 protein. The reactions were performed as described above. Bound proteins were analyzed as above, or, after blotting with anti-TRN-SR2, the filter was stained with Ponceau S. For Ran competition experiments, reaction mixtures containing phosphorylated GST-ASF, TRN-SR2-containing extract, and RanQ69L-GTP or Ran-GDP were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Pull-down experiments were performed as described above. Phosphorylation of the SR peptide [CGGG(RS)8R] was carried out in a 25-μl reaction mix containing 2.5 nmol of the peptide, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.8 mmATP, and 0.24 μg of GST-SRPK1 at 30 °C for 45 min. Mock-phosphorylation was carried out in the reaction excluding ATP. Phosphorylated or mock-phosphorylated SR peptide was added to the reaction mix containing phosphorylated GST-ASF and recombinant TRN-SR2; the pull-down assay was performed as described above. The E2 protein encoded by epidermodysplasia verruciformis-associated papillomaviruses contains an RS-rich sequence in its hinge region. Previously, we showed that this hinge domain is essential for the colocalization of transiently expressed HPV-5 E2 protein with splicing factors in nuclear speckle domains (6.Lai M.-C. Teh B.H. Tarn W.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11832-11841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In an attempt to determine whether the RS-rich hinge is sufficient for nuclear speckle targeting, we inserted the entire hinge or the RS-rich subdomain into a heterologous protein, β-gal, and examined the cellular localization of the fusion protein. Fig. 1 shows that both fusion proteins localized predominantly in the nucleus (panels c and e), whereas β-gal itself was distributed throughout the whole cell (panel a). Although neither of the tested domains was sufficient for speckle targeting, this result suggests that the RS domain of E2 can serve as a functional NLS, like the RS domains or subdomains of some splicing factors (12.Hedley M.L. Amrein H. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11524-11528Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 13.Caceres J.F. Misteli T. Screaton G.R. Spector D.L. Krainer A.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 17.Caceres J.F. Screaton G.R. Krainer A.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). We next asked whether the subcellular localization of the HPV-5 E2 protein could be altered or regulated upon phosphorylation. We first examined the ability of the E2 protein to serve as a substrate for cellular SR protein kinases in vivo. A human SR protein kinase, SRPK1, was transiently coexpressed with the full-length or hinge-deleted E2 protein in transfected HeLa cells. As shown in Fig.2 A, only full-length E2, but not hinge-deleted E2, changed its gel mobility in the presence of overexpressed SRPK1, suggesting phosphorylation of the hinge. Because the E2 protein purified from the baculovirus expression system is readily detectable by mAb 104, which recognizes phosphorylated epitopes in SR proteins (6.Lai M.-C. Teh B.H. Tarn W.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11832-11841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), E2 might be moderately phosphorylated by a cellular kinase even in the absence of exogenous SRPK1 in HeLa cells. Thus, our finding may indicate that excess SRPK1 extensively phosphorylates the E2 protein in the hinge. Furthermore, the E2 protein, similar to ASF/SF2, appeared to accumulate in the cytoplasm upon hyperphosphorylation of the hinge by excess SRPK1 (Fig. 2 B,panels b and f). In contrast, hinge-deleted E2 remained in the nucleus despite the presence of exogenous SRPK1 (panel d). Thus, the hinge of the HPV-5 E2 transactivator behaved similarly to the RS domains of several cellular SR proteins (12.Hedley M.L. Amrein H. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11524-11528Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 13.Caceres J.F. Misteli T. Screaton G.R. Spector D.L. Krainer A.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 17.Caceres J.F. Screaton G.R. Krainer A.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) in both its nuclear targeting activity and cytoplasmic distribution upon hyperphosphorylation. We next performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to search for HPV-5 E2-interacting proteins from a HeLa cell cDNA library. We wished to identify candidates that could specifically recognize the RS domain of E2 and function as a nuclear transporter. A screen of 3.5 × 105 primary transformants yielded 37 positive clones. The majority of the isolated clones encoded known proteins including SF2p32, ASF/SF2, SC35, 9G8, Tra2β, and ribosomal proteins S4 and S14 (data not shown). One partial cDNA encoded a protein of about 400 amino acid residues homologous to the C terminus of yeast importin-β family protein Mtr10p and almost identical to human transportin-SR (Ref. 37.Kataoka N. Bachorik J.L. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1145-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar; hereafter termed TRN-SR1) and thus attracted our further attention. Such a clone had no detectable interaction with hinge-deleted E2, suggesting that its encoded protein interacts only with the RS-rich hinge domain of E2 (data not shown). Therefore, it is named transportin-SR2 (abbreviated as TRN-SR2). Northern blot analysis with the 3′ end of the coding region of human TRN-SR2 revealed a single transcript of ∼4.5 kilobase pairs that is ubiquitously expressed in all human tissues, with higher abundance in testis (data not shown). A ∼3.4-kilobase pair cDNA containing the possible entire open reading frame of human TRN-SR2 was obtained by screening a λZAP cDNA library made from HeLa cells. The human TRN-SR2 protein of 923 amino acid residues is ∼23% identical toS. cerevisiae Mtr10p and also shares similarities with the putative homologs in several other species (Fig.3, bottom panel). Intriguingly, TRN-SR2 lacks two regions of ∼30 amino acid residues from TRN-SR1 (37.Kataoka N. Bachorik J.L. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1145-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) as shown in Fig. 3 (top panel). Further experiments are needed to clarify the relationship between these two proteins. In addition, human TRN-SR2 exhibited significant homology (∼22%) to another human open reading frame, namely the KIAA0724 protein (38.Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Suyama M. Kikuno R. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), throughout the entire sequence. However, this putative importin-β family protein did not interact with SR proteins, as judged by the yeast two-hybrid interaction assay (data not shown). Since E2's RS-rich hinge behaved similarly to some splicing factors' RS domains in many different aspects (6 and see above), we next tested the interaction of TRN-SR2 with cellular SR splicing factors by using the yeast two-hybrid interaction assay. As shown in Fig. 4, human TRN-SR2 interacted with three tested SR proteins, i.e.ASF/SF2, SC35, and Tra2β, via its C-terminal 400 amino acid residues. TRN-SR2 interaction was also detected with truncated Tra2β, which possessed only the N-terminal RS domain, but not with the RNA binding domains of ASF and Tra2β (Fig. 4). This result suggests that the RS domain is sufficient to mediate the interaction of SR proteins with TRN-SR2. Thus, TRN-SR2 can probably interact with the whole family of SR protein splicing factors. Since cellular SR proteins represent key regulators in the expression of eukaryotic genes, and moreover, the hinge itself is dispensable for the nuclear entry of the E2 transactivators (6.Lai M.-C. Teh B.H. Tarn W.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11832-11841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 39.Skiadopoulos A.H. McBride A.A. J. Viol. 1996; 70: 1117-1124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we focused further experiments on SR splicing factors instead of HPV E2. To test whether phosphorylation plays any role in TRN-SR2-SR protein interactions, we performed a protein-protein interaction assay in a SR protein kinase-deficient (sky1Δ) yeast strain (31.Yeakley J.M. Tronchere H. Olesen J. Dyck J.A. Wang H.Y. Fu X.D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The interaction of TRN-SR2 with either ASF/SF2 or SC35 was severely affected"
https://openalex.org/W2135606345,"The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is an inherited X-linked immunodeficiency characterized by thrombocytopenia, eczema, and a tendency toward lymphoid malignancy. Lymphocytes from affected individuals have cytoskeletal abnormalities, and monocytes show impaired motility. The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) is a multi-domain protein involved in cytoskeletal organization. In a two-hybrid screen, we identified the protein Cdc42-interacting protein 4 (CIP4) as a WASP interactor. CIP4, like WASP, is a Cdc42 effector protein involved in cytoskeletal organization. We found that the WASP-CIP4 interaction is mediated by the binding of the Src homology 3 domain of CIP4 to the proline-rich segment of WASP. Cdc42 was not required for this interaction. Co-expression of CIP4 and green fluorescent protein-WASP in COS-7 cells led to the association of WASP with microtubules. In vitro experiments showed that CIP4 binds to microtubules via its NH2 terminus. The region of CIP4 responsible for binding to active Cdc42 was localized to amino acids 383–417, and the mutation I398S abrogated binding. Deletion of the Cdc42-binding domain of CIP4 did not affect the colocalization of WASP with microtubules in vivo. We conclude that CIP4 can mediate the association of WASP with microtubules. This may facilitate transport of WASP to sites of substrate adhesion in hematopoietic cells. The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is an inherited X-linked immunodeficiency characterized by thrombocytopenia, eczema, and a tendency toward lymphoid malignancy. Lymphocytes from affected individuals have cytoskeletal abnormalities, and monocytes show impaired motility. The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) is a multi-domain protein involved in cytoskeletal organization. In a two-hybrid screen, we identified the protein Cdc42-interacting protein 4 (CIP4) as a WASP interactor. CIP4, like WASP, is a Cdc42 effector protein involved in cytoskeletal organization. We found that the WASP-CIP4 interaction is mediated by the binding of the Src homology 3 domain of CIP4 to the proline-rich segment of WASP. Cdc42 was not required for this interaction. Co-expression of CIP4 and green fluorescent protein-WASP in COS-7 cells led to the association of WASP with microtubules. In vitro experiments showed that CIP4 binds to microtubules via its NH2 terminus. The region of CIP4 responsible for binding to active Cdc42 was localized to amino acids 383–417, and the mutation I398S abrogated binding.

Although the function of WASP1 was not immediately apparent from knowledge of its primary structure, a variety of interactions have been discovered showing that WASP plays a role in cytoskeletal organization. The NH2 terminus of WASP binds to WASP-interacting protein (WIP), a protein with profilin binding and actin binding motifs, overexpression of which causes changes in cytoskeletal structure (15.Ramesh N.

Motifs in the COOH terminus of WASP show homology to the actin-binding proteins verprolin (verprolin homology domain, amino acids 430–446) and cofilin (cofilin homology domain, amino acids 469–487) (18.Symons M.

Biol. 1998; 8: 1347-1356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). A WASP homolog expressed in neural and other tissues, N-WASP, has the ability to depolymerize actin filaments in vitro (28.Miki H. Miura K. Takenawa T.

WASP, N-WASP, and the related proteins Scar1 in human and Bee1/Las17 in yeast interact with the Arp2/3 complex, a key regulator of actin polymerization (31.Winter D. Lechler T. Li R. Curr.

WASP-coated microspheres exhibit cytoplasmic actin-based motility, dependent on the presence of the Arp2/3 complex (33.Aspenström P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 479-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies suggest that WASP is a mediator of Cdc42/Rac signaling, and has direct effects on the actin cytoskeleton via actin-binding domains and activation of the Arp2/3 complex. SH3 protein interactions may play a role in localization of WASP and/or transmission of extracellular signals to and through WASP. We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to look for novel WASP-interacting proteins. One WASP-interacting clone encoded a portion of the protein CIP4. This protein was identified previously as interacting with the active form of Cdc42 (34.Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar). CIP4 is a 545-amino acid protein, widely expressed, that has an NH2-terminal domain of unknown function with homology to the NH2 termini of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Fer and the Fes/Fps proto-oncogene, which was termed the FCH domain. The central region of the protein (amino acids 293–481) was shown to interact with Cdc42, although it does not contain a GBD/CRIB motif. An SH3 domain is found in the COOH terminus of CIP4. We performed a series of studies exploring the mechanism of WASP/CIP4 interaction, and the effects of co-expression of CIP4 on WASP distribution and actin cytoskeletal structure in COS-7 cells. We used the Interaction Trap two-hybrid screen (35.Golemis E.A. Gyuris J. Brent R. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1994: 13.14.1-13.14.17Google Scholar). Yeast and vectors were obtained from Roger Brent (University of Massachusetts, Boston, MA). An human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type I-transformed T-cell line cDNA library for this system was purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). The screen was performed as described (16.Stewart D.M. Tian L. Nelson D.L. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5019-5024PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Stewart D. Treiber-Held S. Kurman C.C. Facchette F. Notarangelo L.D. Nelson D.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2627-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) using full-length WASP as bait in the LexA system. Additional methods were obtained from material supplied with the library. The specificity of interaction of clones expressing the interaction phenotype was tested with a bait plasmid containing an open reading frame of Drosophilabicoid protein that was included with the materials obtained from Dr. R. Brent, and with a bait plasmid containing an open reading frame of human IGF1-Rβ cytoplasmic domain that was a gift from Bhakta Dey (NCI Metabolism Branch, Bethesda, MD). A cDNA encoding full-length WASP was cloned into pQBI-25 (Quantum Biotechnologies Inc., Laval, Quebec, Canada) in order to produce GFP-WASP, and into pCR2 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for in vitro translation. GST-Cdc42 expression constructs were generously provided by Dr. Anne Ridley (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, University College, London, United Kingdom). A full-length CIP4 cDNA PCR product from a B-cell cDNA library (gift from Dr. Colin Duckett, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) was cloned into pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen). This CIP4 cDNA was used as a template to clone CIP4 and CIP4 fragments into pCR2.1 for in vitro translation and into pGEX4T-2 for expression of GST-tagged proteins. CIP4 cDNA was cloned into a derivative of the mammalian expression vector pRK5 (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) that was modified to include an NH2-terminal myc epitope tag (pRK5-myc) in order to express myc-tagged CIP4 in mammalian cells. Point mutations were produced by whole vector PCR with primers containing the desired base change using the QuikChangeTMsite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Internal deletion mutants of CIP4 and WASP were generated by whole vector PCR using the QuikChangeTM kit, with primers flanking the sites of the intended deletion. T4 DNA ligase was then used for blunt end ligation of the PCR products. All constructs were sequenced to confirm the presence of the intended mutations. In vitro binding assays of WASP with CIP4, and WASP or CIP4 with Cdc42 were performed using the GST pull-down technique. In these assays, an in vitrotranslated, [35S]methionine-radiolabeled protein was incubated with a potential binding partner in the form of an unlabeled GST fusion protein bound to beads of glutathione-agarose. Specifically, GST fusion protein (10 μg) bound to glutathione-agarose was incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with 10 μl of the in vitrotranslated protein in PBS, 1% Triton X-100 or, in the case of loaded Cdc42, with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2% bovine serum albumin in a total volume of 100 μl, then washed three times with the same buffer. Proteins adhering to the beads (labeled protein and unlabeled GST protein) were released from the beads, and any interaction disrupted by boiling in SDS gel loading buffer containing 2% 2-mercaptoethanol. This protein mixture was analyzed on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and the gel exposed to x-ray film. Any labeled protein that had bound to the GST fusion protein will appear as a band on the film. Radiolabeled WASP or CIP4 was prepared by in vitrotranslation using the TnT® coupled transcription-translation system (Promega, Madison WI) in the presence of [35S]methionine. GST fusion proteins were expressed using the protease-deficient Escherichia coli bacterial strain BL21. Cells from induced cultures were collected, resuspended in 50 μl of ice-cold PBS/ml of culture and disrupted by sonication. Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1% and the lysate was mixed for 30 min. The lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 10 min, diluted 5-fold with 1% Triton X-100/PBS, and reduced glutathione-agarose (Sigma) added. After binding of GST fusion proteins, the glutathione-agarose was washed and stored at 4 °C. The quantity and purity of the GST fusion proteins was assessed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie Blue staining. GST-Cdc42 proteins were loaded with the non-hydrolyzable GTP analog GTPγS immediately before use by adding equal volumes of the purified fusion protein bound to glutathione-agarose in PBS and 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm GTPγS or GDPβS at 37 °C for 30 min and fixed with 12.5 mm MgCl2. Affinity-purified anti-CIP4 antibody was prepared as follows. A PCR product encoding CIP4 residues 118–481 was cloned into pFLAG-ATS vector (Kodak-IBI) and recombinant FLAG-CIP4 expressed in E. coli BL-21. The FLAG-CIP4 was purified by affinity chromatography on anti-FLAG M2 agarose according to manufacturer's directions. Rabbits were immunized with 100 μg of purified FLAG-CIP4 initially, followed by 10 μg/week for 10 weeks. Preimmune and immune sera were collected and assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using GST or GST-CIP4 as antigens. Anti-CIP4 antibody was purified from the immune sera by affinity chromatography on GST-CIP4 bound to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Rabbit anti-tubulin antibody, mouse anti-tubulin monoclonal antibody DM1A, and phalloidin-TRITC were purchased from Sigma. Goat anti-rabbit IgG AlexaTM594 and goat anti-mouse IgG AlexaTM488 were purchased from Molecular Probes. Rabbit anti-myc antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, and mouse monoclonal anti-myc was purchased from Invitrogen. Monoclonal anti-WASP was obtained as described (37.Masson D. Kreis T.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was prepared using the Qiagen Maxi Prep kit. COS-7 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mml-glutamine. Cells were transfected by electroporation. COS-7 cells transfected with GFP-WASP and myc-CIP4 were lysed at 1.2 × 107cells/ml in 1% digitonin, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl supplemented with Complete® proteinase inhibitor mixture (Sigma) at 4 °C for 20 min and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min. The clarified lysate was diluted 1:3 with washing buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl with proteinase inhibitor), and affinity-purified rabbit anti-CIP4 or preimmune serum was added to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml or 5 μl/ml, respectively. After incubation at 4 °C for 2 h, protein A-Sepharose (50 μl of a 50% slurry in wash buffer) was added, and the suspension rocked at 4 °C for 1 h. The pellet was washed three times with washing buffer and bound proteins analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blot using either monoclonal anti-myc or monoclonal anti-WASP. Microtubules were obtained by incubating 5 mg/ml tubulin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in G-PEM buffer (100 mm K-PIPES, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm GTP, pH 6.8) with 30% glycerol at 35 °C for 10 min. Microtubules were stabilized by 10 μm paclitaxel (Molecular Probes) as instructed by the manufacturer. The microtubule binding experiments were performed as described (38.Linder S. Nelson D. Weiss M. Aepfelbacher M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9648-9653Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μl of in vitro translated, [35S]methionine-labeled CIP4 or CIP4 mutants was diluted in 200 μl of PB (80 mm K-PIPES, pH 6.9, 1 mmEGTA, 1 mm CaCl2) containing Complete® proteinase inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The mixture was spun at 50,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C in a 70.1Ti rotor (Beckman). 100 μl of supernatant was incubated with or without 30 μg of microtubules for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 10 μm paclitaxel. The microtubule and CIP4 mixtures were layered over 1 ml of 15% sucrose in PB, and spun for 30 min at 30,000 × g in a SW55 rotor (Beckman). Both supernatants (above the sucrose) and pellets were analyzed for the presence of CIP4 and its mutants by 4–20% SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography. The gels were then stained with Coomassie Blue to confirm that an equal mass of microtubules was loaded on the gel in each sample. COS-7 cells were transfected with pQBI25-GFP-WASP in the presence or absence of pRK5-myc-CIP4 by electroporation. Cells were plated on coverslips in 24-well culture plates. 24–48 h after transfection, cells were fixed and permeabilized by Cytoperm/Fix kit (PharMingen). Primary human macrophages were prepared and cultured for 7 days as described (39.Avila J. Brandt R. Kosik K.S. Brain Microtubule Associated Proteins. Harwood Academic Publishers, Boston1998Google Scholar). To visualize microtubules, cells were fixed and permeabilized by 4% formaldehyde, 0.1% Triton X-100, 80 mm K-PIPES, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgSO4, 30% glycerol at room temperature for 30 min (40.Miki H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Takenawa T. Nature. 1998; 391: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar) or by 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.3% Triton X-100, 0.05% glutaraldehyde in cytoskeleton buffer (10 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mmMgCl2, 100 μg/ml streptomycin) at room temperature for 15 min. Both methods gave similar results. After staining, coverslips were mounted on glass slides by FluorSave® reagent (Calbiochem). Confocal laser scanning microscopy was performed using an Olympus confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with argon and krypton ion lasers. Series of optical sections through the cells were collected. Images were assembled using Adobe PhotoShop software. Several unique WASP-interacting clones were identified in the two-hybrid screen. One clone, our number 4–2, encoded a portion of the protein CIP4, a 545 amino acid protein that previously had been identified as an SH3-domain containing protein with partial homology to the non-receptor kinase Fer that interacts with the active form of Cdc42 (33.Aspenström P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 479-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The nucleic acid sequence of clone 4–2 was identical to bases 390–1949 of the published CIP4 sequence (GenBank accession number AJ000414) with the exception of a single C insertion at 1911 in the 3′-untranslated region. The cDNA encoded CIP4 amino acids 118–545. The interaction was specific to the WASP-LexA bait protein; no interaction of CIP4 with eitherDrosophila bicoid protein or the cytoplasmic domain of IGF1-Rβ was detected in the two-hybrid system (data not shown). The region of WASP responsible for interaction with CIP4 was mapped by deletion mutation analysis in the two-hybrid system. This showed that CIP4 interacted with a WASP construct retaining amino acids 1–442, but failed to interact with a WASP construct retaining amino acids 1–201 (data not shown). Since the WASP 1–442 has both the GBD (230–260) and the proline-rich region (310–420), two mechanisms of interaction were thought possible. First, the CIP4 SH3 domain might bind directly to WASP in the proline-rich region. Alternatively, since the yeast homolog of Cdc42 is similar to the human protein, the binding of endogenous yeast Cdc42 to WASP and CIP4 simultaneously could contribute to the interaction. We therefore performed an in vitro binding assay to explore the mechanisms of CIP4/WASP interaction. The interaction between radiolabeled, in vitro translated WASP of different lengths and GST-CIP4 full-length and deletion mutants is shown in Fig. 1. Full-length CIP4 (GST-CIP4 wild type (WT)) bound strongly to WASP mutants retaining amino acids 1–442 and 1–502, which contain both the polyproline region and the GBD. WASP mutants lacking the polyproline region (1–302 and 1–201) bound CIP4 weakly, whether or not the WASP GBD was present (1–302) or absent (1–201). This indicates that the proline-rich region of WASP is necessary for effective CIP4 binding. However, full-length WASP bound weakly to GST-CIP4 SH3, which contains the isolated CIP4 SH3 domain. WASP mutant 1–442, which retains the polyproline region but lacks the COOH-terminal actin binding region, bound GST-CIP4 SH3 strongly. This difference may be due to a WASP intramolecular interaction between COOH-terminal acidic residues and basic residues just NH2-terminal of the GBD, which may render the proline-rich region less available for binding to the CIP4 SH3 domain (41.Kato M. Miki H. Imai K. Nonoyama S. Suzuki T. Sasakawa C. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27225-27230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 42.Glaven J.A. Whitehead I. Bagrodia S. Kay R. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2279-2285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). WASP mutants lacking the polyproline region (1–302 and 1–201) failed to bind the CIP4 SH3 domain. A CIP4 mutant lacking the SH3 domain (GST-CIP4 118–481) bound all WASP mutants weakly, if at all. These results demonstrate that the WASP-CIP4 interaction is mediated chiefly by the binding of the CIP4 SH3 domain to the polyproline region of WASP, and that the presence or absence of the WASP GBD has no influence on this binding. To further establish that the CIP4-WASP interaction can occur independently of Cdc42 binding, the binding of in vitrotranslated radiolabeled WASP to both CIP4 and the constitutively active Cdc42 mutant V12 was examined. As shown in Fig.2, a deletion mutant of WASP specifically lacking the GBD retains the ability to bind CIP4, but Cdc42 binding is lost. This shows that CIP4 can bind to WASP in the absence of Cdc42 binding. To further investigate the CIP4-WASP interaction, COS-7 cells were co-transfected with GFP-WASP and myc-tagged CIP4. GFP-WASP co-immunoprecipitated with CIP4 as shown in Fig.3. The CIP4 118–481 mutant did not show binding to WASP, again showing the necessity of the CIP4 SH3 domain. When expressed alone, the CIP4 SH3 domain localized entirely in the cell nucleus as detected by immunofluorescence (data not shown), and was not tested for interaction with WASP by co-immunoprecipitation. The primary sequence of CIP4 does not contain the GBD/CRIB motif characteristic of the binding site of Cdc42. We therefore tested a series of CIP4 deletion mutants for the ability to interact with the active form of Cdc42. Full-length in vitrotranslated CIP4 interacted specifically with GST-Cdc42-GTPγS or with the constitutively active mutant Cdc42-V12-GTPγS but not to the GDPβS-loaded forms (not shown). The dominant negative Cdc42 mutant N17 failed to bind CIP4 regardless of GTP or GDP loading (not shown). As shown in Fig. 4, full-length CIP4 (1–545) or CIP4 constructs retaining amino acids 1–417 and 1–423 reacted with Cdc42, but CIP4 1–383 or 1–407 did not. A series of substitution mutations in this region of the CIP4 construct 1–417 revealed that the mutation I398S abrogated binding of CIP4 to active Cdc42 (Fig. 4 B). We conclude that the CIP4 amino acids 383–417 and the amino acid Ile-398 are critical for Cdc42 binding to CIP4.

We have also shown that membrane association of endosomal COPs depends on the acidic endosomal pH, in contrast to biosynthetic COPs. In this paper, we report that both membrane recruitment of endosomal COPs and in vitro biogenesis of transport intermediates destined for late endosomes, depend on a cytosolic factor, which we identified as the small GTP-binding protein ARF1. Our data indicate that ARF1 does not act via activation of an endosomal phospholipase D. We also find that ARF1 membrane association is regulated by the endosomal pH, and that this controls the pH-dependent association of endosomal COPs. These studies thus show that ARF1 regulates COP functions in the endocytic pathway, and indicate that ARF1 acts as the cytosolic component of a transmembrane pH-sensing mechanism.

Most internalized cell surface molecules are recycled, whereas molecules which are destined to be degraded, including all down-regulated cell surface receptors, are sorted within early endosomes, and then transported toward late endosomes and lysosomes (1.Gruenberg J.

These pH- and COP-dependent processes are related functionally and biochemically, since COP association to endosomal membranes, but not to biosynthetic membranes, is itself pH-sensitive (8.Aniento F.

These observations lead us to propose that a transmembrane pH-sensor regulates COP association to endosomes, thereby signaling the onset of the degradation pathway on early endosomal membranes.In the present paper, we have further dissected the molecular process which regulates membrane association of endosomal COPs. Our data show that the small GTP-binding protein ARF1 is required for COP recruitment onto endosomes, and for ECV/MVB biogenesis from donor early endosomal membranes in vitro. We find that PLD and phosphatidic acid are not involved in this process, indicating that ARF1 does not act via PLD on early endosomal membranes, in contrast to biosynthetic COPs (16.Ktistakis N.T. Brown H.A. Waters M.G. Sternweis P.C. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Moreover, our data show that ARF1 recruitment onto endosomes depends on the acidic lumenal pH, in agreement with previous studies on ARF binding to microsomes (17.Zeuzem S. Feick P. Zimmermann P. Haase W. Kahn R.A. Schulz I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6619-6623Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and that this mechanism accounts for the pH dependence of endosomal COPs association to membranes. Our data thus show that ARF1 mediates COP binding to endosomes and ECV/MVB biogenesis, in a pH-dependent, but PLD-independent, process. ARF1 thus appears to act as the cytosolic component relaying lumenal pH variations to endosomal COPs during ECV/MVB biogenesis.

Unstained crystals are colorless, but their positive charge attracts eosin, and the crystals are brightly eosinophilic (acidophilic) in tissue sections histochemically stained with a standard hematoxylin and eosin protocol. The sharply angular eosinophilic crystals are of variable size and shape and are generally found in the cytoplasm of macrophages and multinucleated giant cells and extracellular within tissue lumina (7.Schuh J.C.L.

Control animals included +/+ andme v/+ littermates, and sex- and age-matched C57BL/6NTac or BALB/c mice (Taconic, Germantown, NY). The SPCTNFRIIFc transgenic mice (C57BL/6NTac × Sv/129) secrete soluble human tumor necrosis factor receptor p75 under the control of the surfactant apoprotein C promotor (17.Smith S. Skerrett S.J. Chi E.Y. Jonas M. Mohler K. Wilson C.B. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 19: 881-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and were paired with littermates or age-matched control mice (gift of Drs. C. Wilson and S. Smith, University of Washington). Heterozygote matings were used to generate additional mice to backcross 4–5 generations onto C57BL/6NTac mice. Lung tissue was also examined from an in-house colony of C57BL/6J × Sv/129 and C57BL/6 mice with a targeted deletion of CD40L that results in spontaneous P. carinii infection (15.Schuh J.C.L. Campbell K.A. Wright B. Harrington K.A. Fanslow W.C. Vet. Pathol. 1996; 33 (616): 616Google Scholar). All mice were housed in microisolator units and fed rodent chow and waterad libitum, and the colony was routinely monitored for murine pathogens. At 6–10 weeks (me v /me v) or 16–88 weeks (SPCTNFRIIFc) of age, mice were humanely killed by CO2 and exsanguinated through the abdominal vena cava. The trachea was exposed by a midline incision and cannulated with an infusion set (21 g, ¾ in; Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). The lungs were lavaged with 1–3 ml of sterile Hanks' balanced salt solution delivered by one or more tuberculin syringes. The cellularity of the 1–2 ml of recovered BAL was evaluated by examination of cytospin preparations stained with Diff-quik® stain (Dade Diagnostics, Inc., Aguada, PR). The entire lung was collected into 10% neutral buffered formalin or Fekete's formol-acetic alcohol, processed, embedded in paraffin, and cut at 5 μm, and sections were stained by hematoxylin and eosin stain. To purify the crystals, 3 ml of BAL fluid fromme v /me v mice were mixed with 6 ml of diatrizoate-Ficoll (Isolymph®, Gallard-Schlesinger Industries, Inc., Carle Place, NY) and centrifuged at 250 × G for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant and most of the diatrizoate-Ficoll layer were removed by aspiration. The remaining ∼0.2 ml of diatrizoate-Ficoll from the bottom of the tube, which contained the crystals, were resuspended in 2.8 ml of PBS and 6 ml of diatrizoate-Ficoll, and the precipitation was repeated. The above PBS wash/diatrizoate-Ficoll precipitation step was repeated five more times. The final ∼0.2 ml of crystal-containing diatrizoate-Ficoll was resuspended in 2 ml of PBS and centrifuged at 200 × gfor 5 min at 4 °C, and the bottom ∼0.2 ml of PBS plus crystals was preserved. Microscopically, a few cell contaminants were observed with the purified crystals. After removing the residual cell contaminants under a microscope using a small gel loading tip, the purified crystals were solubilized by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 10 min, and the protein components were identified by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry analysis. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed under reducing conditions using Tris-glycine 4–20% gradient gels (Novex, San Diego, CA). Protein bands were detected by staining with Colloidal Blue (Novex), excised from the SDS-PAGE gel, and destained by washing with mixtures of 200 mm NH4HCO3/acetonitrile (1:1). Proteins were reduced with dithiothreitol, alkylated with iodoacetamide, and digested with trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) as described (18.Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7736) Google Scholar). Tryptic peptides were concentrated and desalted with approximately 150 nl of POROS R2 sorbent (Perseptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) before mass spectrometric analysis. Mass spectrometry analysis of tryptic peptides was performed on a Finnigan LCQ ion trap instrument (Finnigan, San Jose, CA). Ionization was achieved with a home-built nanoflow electrospray source (19.Wilm M. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar). The nanospray tips were purchased from Protana (Denmark). A search of a nonredundant protein sequence data base with the collision-induced dissociation mass spectra was performed using the SEQUESTTM data base search program (20.Yates III, J.R. Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Schieltz D. Anal. Chem. 1995; 67: 1426-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar), and matches were verified using a de novo sequence interpretation program (Lutefisk 97) (21.Taylor J.A. Johnson R.S. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1997; 11: 1067-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The chitinase activity of BAL was assayed with the fluorogenic substrates 4-methylumbelliferyl (4-MU)N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminide, 4-MU β-d-N,N′-diacetylchitobioside, and 4-MU β-d-N,N′,N“-triacetylchitotrioside (all from Sigma). Assays were performed as described with minor modifications (22.Hollak C.E.M. van Weely S. Oers M.H.J. Aerts J.M.F.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1288-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Briefly, BAL fluid was incubated with a substrate in citrate/phosphate buffer (0.1 m/0.2 m), pH 5.2, at a concentration of 0.02 μm. After incubation at 37 °C for 15 min, the reaction (final volume, 110 μl) was stopped with 1 ml of 0.3 m glycine/NaOH buffer, pH 10.6, and the fluorescent 4-methylumbelliferone released was measured with a fluorimeter (excitation, 350 nm; emission, 450 nm). A 4-methylumbelliferone (Sigma) standard curve was generated and used to quantify the enzyme activity. Protein concentrations were determined using the Pierce micro-BCA protein assay kit. Chitotriosidase activity was also assayed after gel electrophoresis. Nonreducing SDS-PAGE (with 4–20% Novex gradient gels) were used to separate BAL protein components. After electrophoresis, the gel was soaked in 25% (v/v) isopropyl alcohol for 15 min, followed by rehydration in water for 20 min. Five milliliters of 4-MU-β-d-N,N′,N”-triacetylchitotrioside in citrate/phosphate buffer (0.1m/0.2 m, pH 5.2) at 0.2 mg/ml was added to the gel and incubated at 25 °C for 15 min. The enzymatic reactions were stopped with 1 ml of 0.3 m glycine, pH 10.6, and the activities were detected as fluorescent bands under UV light. After the in-gel enzyme assay, the gel was stained with Colloidal Coomassie (Novex). Eosinophilic crystals were identified in varying numbers, sizes, and shapes within the cytoplasm of alveolar macrophages and multinucleate giant cells and free within alveolar spaces in the lungs ofme v/me v (Fig.1 A), SPCTNFRIIFc transgenic (Fig. 1 B) and wild type litter mate control mice, CD40L-deficient mice (Fig. 1 C), and occasionally in older C57BL/6 control mice. In younger mice, eosinophilic crystals were only found intracellularly in activated alveolar macrophages and often in isolated scattered intra-alveolar clusters in one or two lung lobes. Intracellular and extracellular crystals were found in moribundme v/me v mice by 5–8 weeks of age and in the SPCTNFRIIFc mice by 32 weeks of age. As the transgenic mice aged, diffuse involvement of all five lung lobes was normal, whereas age-matched control mice seldom had more than a few foci within several lung lobes. In the tissue sections, many intracellular crystals appeared to be fine spicules, which were found to correspond to stacks of flat, 10-μm2 crystals identified in the BAL cytospin. Crystals between 20 and 120 μm in length were also identified in BAL cytospin (Fig. 1 D) as multifaceted (8–10 sides) and in tissue sections as extracellular. Large crystals were found in association with degeneration and hyperplasia of respiratory epithelium and mixed cellular inflammation, particularly in the SPCTNFRIIFc mice. In theme v /me v mice, the inherent progressive lung injury consisted of numerous infiltrating neutrophils, lymphocytes, and eosinophils, along with hemorrhage that generally proved fatal by 10 weeks of age. In the original line of SPCTNFRIIFc mice, eosinophilic crystals and lung pathology (Fig.1 B) was consistently identified only in mice older than 24 weeks of age, with some mortality after 48 weeks of age. With advancing age, the frequency and size of crystals, mixed inflammation, and mechanical injury induced by the crystals increased dramatically. Littermate controls were also found to have eosinophilic crystals but at a much lower frequency and generally only as intracellular crystals. Subsequently, SPCTNFRIIFc mice backcrossed onto C57BL/6Ntac mice (4–5 generations) were less frequently affected, had fewer lung lobes involved, and had less lung injury (epithelial hyperplasia and inflammation) than found in the original line (C57BL/6NTac × Sv/129). CD40L-deficient mice consistently developed spontaneousP. carinii infection typified by foamy alveolar material and proliferation of fungus-laden macrophages and multinucleated giant cells. Eosinophilic crystals were rarely found early in the disease but were an obvious intracellular and extracellular component in most moribund mice. Except for P. carinii in CD40L-deficient mice, all mice were determined to be free of other spontaneous murine pathogens or other confounding diseases that might alter the frequency of pulmonary damage and eosinophilic crystal formation. SDS-PAGE gels were used to separate the BAL fluid protein components. Several additional protein bands were observed in lanes loaded with me v/me vBAL fluids compared with the control BAL fluid (Fig.2 A). Protein bands fromme v/me v BAL were excised and were identified through in-gel trypsin digest and mass spectrometry sequencing of tryptic peptides. Proteins identified as BAL components of me v/me v mice include transferrin, serum albumin, Ym1, actin, ferritin light chain, and hemoglobin (Fig. 2 A). Through repeated Ficoll precipitation/PBS washing procedures, eosinophilic crystals were further purified. By SDS-PAGE, a single protein band with apparent molecular mass of ∼40 kDa was observed (Fig. 2 A). Using mass spectrometry, sequences of 11 tryptic peptides from this protein band were obtained and shown to encompass 125 amino acids of the Ym1 sequence (TableI). Besides peptides from Ym1, autolysis products of trypsin were the only other peptides found in the sample. Therefore, Ym1 was identified as the sole protein component of the eosinophilic crystal. The ∼40-kDa protein band from the unpurifiedme v/me v BAL contained two proteins, Ym1 and actin (Fig. 2 A), whereas a ∼40-kDa protein band from the control BAL was shown to only contain actin (Fig.2 A). This further supports the notion that Ym1 is a unique protein component ofme v/me v BAL. Besides the 40-kDa protein band, several lower molecular weight protein bands fromme v/me v BAL also contained fragments of Ym1 (Fig. 2 A). Unlike the 40-kDa Ym1, these bands were not present in the purified crystals (Fig.2 A), thus indicating that degraded Ym1 is not a component of the crystal.Table IPeptide sequences identified through mass spectrometry sequencing of purified eosinophilic crystalsPeptide numberObservedm rCalculated m rSequences identified by CIDaCollision-induced dissociation.1941.6941.6HLFSVLVK2957.2957.6TLLAIGGWK31021.21021.5DYEALNGLK41102.41102.6QIFIQSVIR51264.41234.6DYEALNGLKDK61329.41329.6EEESVEKDIPR71342.41342.6DGYTGENSPLYK81352.41352.7TGIGAPTISTGPPGK91547.61547.7AFEEESVEKDIPR101628.41628.7YQLM*CYYTSWAKbM*, methionine sulfoxide.111721.61721.8FGPAPFSAM*VSTPQNRa Collision-induced dissociation.b M*, methionine sulfoxide. Open table in a new tab The 40-kDa Ym1 protein was also found in BAL of SPCTNFRIIFc transgenic mice, although the protein was in much lower quantity compared with Ym1 in BAL from me v/me v mice (data not shown). Compared withme v/me v mice, the majority of the crystals in the lung sections of the SPCTNFRIIFc transgenic mice were intracellular in alveolar macrophages and thus not accessible by BAL. The Ym1 cDNA sequence, which encodes a 399-amino acid secreted protein transiently expressed by activated murine peritoneal macrophages, was submitted directly to the GenBankTM data base (accession no. M94584) in 1992. Later on, a second cDNA called ECF-L with a somewhat different sequence from Ym1 was also deposited with the data base (GenBankTMaccession no. D87757). Comparing the Ym1 and ECF-L sequences, several minor differences exist in the cDNA sequences. Of the Ym1 tryptic peptides sequenced in this study (Table I), we identified a 16-amino acid peptide, FGPAPFSAMVSTPQNR (Fig. 2 B), which indicated that nucleotides 328–330 encode a proline (as in Ym1) rather than serine (as in ECF-L) (codon ccg instead of tcg; GenBankTMaccession no. M94584). Another tryptic peptide obtained fromme v/me v BAL, IPELSQSLDYIQVMTYDLHDPK (data not shown), was consistent with the 9-amino acid sequence between nucleotides 595 and 624 given in the ECF-L sequence, but due to a reading frameshift in the Ym1 cDNA, a different 9- amino acid sequence was predicted. In addition, the sequence of a nontryptic peptide (YQLMCYYTSWAK) (Table I) revealed the N terminus of the Ym1 protein after the secretion signal was removed. Sequence homology searches indicated that Ym1 belongs to a family of mammalian proteins that resemble bacterial and plant chitinases. Chitin is a linear polymer of β-1,4-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine, and chitinase breaks down the β-1,4 linkage between the carbohydrate monomers. Furthermore, protein sequence regions that are required for the biological activities of bacterial chitinases (23.Watanabe T. Kobori K. Miyashita K. Fujii T. Sakai H. Uchida M. Tanaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18567-18572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were found to be conserved in Ym1. Since Ym1 has extensive homology with chitinase, the enzymatic activity of BAL fluid fromme v/me v mice to hydrolyze an artificial chitotrioside substrate (chitotriosidase activity) was assayed. Compared with control BAL fluids,me v/me v BAL fluids had 3–5-fold increases in chitotriosidase activities (Fig.3 A). The detection of chitotriosidase activity after gel electrophoresis demonstrated that the enzymatic activity in BAL co-localized with the Ym1 protein (Fig.3 B). When the purified eosinophilic crystals were solubilized in the SDS-PAGE sample buffer, the enzymatic activities were also detected by the in-gel chitotriosidase assay (data not shown). Although the possibility cannot be ruled out completely that the enzymatic activities in the BAL fromme v/me v mice were due to trace amount of unknown enzyme contaminants at this time, our data indicated that Ym1 is probably the protein component in the BAL that contributes to the chitotriosidase activity. Further enzymatic assays were performed using 4-MUN-acetyl-α-d-glucosaminide, 4-MUN-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminide, or 4-MU β-d-N,N′-diacetylchitobioside as substrate (Fig. 3 B). These data indicated that the glycosylhydrolase activity in BAL ofme v/me v mice only cleaves the β-d-linkage of N-acetyl glucosamine, not the α-d-linkage. Eosinophilic crystals are seldom observed in the absence of preexisting pulmonary disease that induces inflammation or activation of endogenous alveolar macrophages. Our studies indicate that macrophages are the minimum and in some cases the only cell found in association with eosinophilic crystal formation. Other investigators have suggested that these eosinophilic crystals in the mouse lung may represent phagocytosed eosinophilic proteins (8.Murray A.B. Luz A. Vet. Pathol. 1990; 27: 274-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, even in the presence of active inflammation with eosinophils, macrophages or multinucleated giant cells containing crystals are proportionally the most frequent cell type observed in mice. The possibility that previously infiltrated eosinophils have been phagocytosed cannot be completely eliminated, but the disproportionately low number of eosinophils in the face of active disease with large numbers of crystals would also suggest that the protein base for the crystals is not the eosinophil. Eosinophilic crystals have been described as an integral part of the eosinophilic infiltration and dependent on interleukin-5 in Cryptococcus neoformans infection on a C57BL/6 background. However, the investigators used BALB/c mice as controls, a mouse that does not appear to form eosinophilic crystals (24.Huffnagle G.B. Boyd M.B. Street N.E. Lipscomb M.F. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2393-2400PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, interleukin-5-deficient mice lack a significant eosinophilia in response to Toxocara canis infestation in C57BL/6 mice yet have eosinophilic crystals at a similar level to wild type C57BL/6 mice (25.Takamoto M. Ovington K.S. Behm C.A. Sugane K. Young I.G. Matthaei K.I. Immunology. 1997; 90: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). With the increasing use of deletional mutant and transgenic mice, eosinophilic crystals are being identified, sometimes erroneously, as part of the phenotype of the gene deletion or overexpression itself, particularly when lung-specific expression is used or pulmonary injury is present. Experimental manipulation of genetically altered mice may also enhance crystal formation. Cryptogenic background lesions that occur sporadically are age-dependent and can be enhanced in young animals under experimental manipulations need to be considered in evaluating pulmonary findings in mice. It is probably not coincidental that in addition to eosinophilic crystals, C57BL/6 mice also develop alveolar histiocytosis, a proliferation of alveolar macrophages that may also contain a few intracytoplasmic eosinophilic crystals (26.Ernst H. Dungworth D.L. Kamino K. Rittinghausen S. Mohr U. Mohr U. Dungworth D.L. Capen C.C. Carlton W.W. Sundberg J.P. Ward J.M. Pathobiology of the Aging Mouse. ILSI Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 281-313Google Scholar). Eosinophilic crystals in SPCTNFRIIFc mice are an example of cryptogenic enhancement of eosinophilic crystal formation in C57BL/6 mice. Other mechanisms for the enhancement of eosinophilic crystals include modification of a genetic factor from Sv/129 mice, because our backcrossed C57BL/6 line had a much lower frequency of crystals. Mice with similar severity of crystal formation secrete different levels of human TNFRII into BAL and serum, and mice transgenic for TNF under the SPC promotor also have crystals (10.Sueoka N. Sueoka E. Miyazaki Y. Okabe S. Kurosumi M. Takayama S. Fujiki H. Cytokine. 1998; 10: 124-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), indicating that manipulation of cytokines and their receptors are probably not directly involved. Furthermore, mice transgenic for interleukin-13 inserted under a Clara cell promotor also exhibit an age-dependent formation of crystals predominately in one but not both lines generated (28.Zhu Z. Homer R.J. Wang Z. Chen Q. Geba G.P. Wang J. Zhang Y. Eng J.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 779-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar). If interleukin-13 induced an eosinophilia that provided a protein of eosinophil origin, then both lines would be expected to produce crystals. Reports of eosinophilic crystals in some but not all genetically altered mice with manipulation of either the surfactant C and Clara cell promotors would argue against a direct effect of the promotors. An indirect insertional event in the different transgenic lines could be the modifier that explains differing results between lines and promotors. Furthermore, eosinophilic crystals are not specific to transgenic mice. Mice with immunodeficiencies that result from targeted deletions such as CD40L and T cell receptors α and β develop crystals subsequent to P. carinii infection, and crystals are found in older severe combined immunodeficient mice (scid/scid) and in aged immunocompetent mice in our colonies (29.Schuh J.C.L. Morrissey P.J. Fanslow W.C. Pettit D.K. Vet. Pathol. 1997; 34 (abstr.): 493Google Scholar). Age, spontaneous infections, and experimental manipulation modulate eosinophilic crystal formation in the lungs of mice. Therefore, mice that are unable to respond appropriately to opportunistic infections or environmental antigens and the age-dependent acquisition of crystals in other mice indicate that eosinophilic crystals are a secondary phenomenon of lung pathology in certain strains of mice. Care must be taken in ascribing a pulmonary phenotype to genetically altered mice. Eosinophilic crystals in the lungs of mice should be considered to be a confounding lesion rather than a primary phenotype until proven otherwise. A recent study of the genomic structure of Ym1 gene revealed that several genes named Ym2, Ym3, andYm4, which are highly homologous to Ym1, are clustered at the Ym1 locus. Expression of these genes is localized in different tissues, and their functions are unknown in the mouse (30.Jin H.M. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Kirkpatrick R.B. Rosenberg M. Genomics. 1998; 54: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We have observed that the primary site of eosinophilic crystal accumulation is within the respiratory tract of mice. This site is consistent with Ym1 gene expression (30.Jin H.M. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Kirkpatrick R.B. Rosenberg M. Genomics. 1998; 54: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Ym1 is also known as ECF-L, a T-lymphocyte-derived eosinophil chemotactic factor. The production of ECF-L was associated with the eosinophil-rich granuloma formation in mice infected withSchistosoma japonicum or T. canis (31.Owhashi M. Maruyama H. Nawa Y. Int. J. Parasitol. 1996; 26: 705-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 32.Owhashi M. Arita H. Niwa A. Parasitol. Res. 1998; 84: 136-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Chitin is not a normal component of mammalian tissue but occurs in other organisms including parasites, fungi, and bacteria. Therefore, since Ym1 has homology to chitinases and we have shown in vitro chitinase activity associated with Ym1, an anti-chitin activity against parasites may play a role in eosinophil chemotactic activity during parasitic infestations. We also routinely see eosinophilic crystal formation secondary to P. cariniifungal infections in mice (29.Schuh J.C.L. Morrissey P.J. Fanslow W.C. Pettit D.K. Vet. Pathol. 1997; 34 (abstr.): 493Google Scholar), further suggesting that anti-chitin activity by Ym1 may be part of the normal host defense mechanism against chitin-bearing microorganisms. Ym1 may also have biological functions that are not related to eosinophil chemotactic activity. Other proteins in the mammalian chitinase-like protein family include a human chitotriosidase that is elevated in the serum of patients with Gaucher's disease (22.Hollak C.E.M. van Weely S. Oers M.H.J. Aerts J.M.F.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1288-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar) and two secreted glycoproteins of cultured human chondrocytes (YKL-39 and YKL-40) (33.Hu B. Trinh K. Figueira W.F. Price P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19415-19420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 34.Hakala B.E. White C. Recklies A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268 (23810): 25803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), one of which (YKL-40) is elevated in joints of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (34.Hakala B.E. White C. Recklies A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268 (23810): 25803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polysaccharides with similar structure form various glycosaminoglycans that are abundant in the extracellular compartment. Could Ym1 and related proteins be involved in binding extracellular polysaccharide and/or in degradation of glycosaminoglycans? One of the other overproduced proteins that we found in the BAL ofme v /me v mice was transferrin. Transferrin was not considered to be a component of the eosinophilic crystal because it was not enriched in partially purified crystals (Fig. 2 A). In a previous study, a protein closely related to transferrin, lactoferrin, was found to co-localize and co-mobilize with another chitinase, YKL-40, found in granules of human neutrophils (35.Volck B. Price P.A. Johansen J.S. Sorensen O. Benfield T.L. Nielsen H.J. Calafat J. Borregaard N. Proc. Assoc. Am. Physicians. 1998; 110: 351-360PubMed Google Scholar). Transferrin and lactoferrin are iron-binding proteins that are nonspecifically increased during the acute phase reaction of infections. Therefore, it would not be unexpected to find chitinase-like proteins in association with the overproduction of such acute phase reactants, particularly in the context of pulmonary injury of the me v /me v mice. Alveolar macrophages from pulmonary interstitial disease have increased hydrolytic enzymatic activity including β-d-N-acetyl glucosaminidase (36.Perez-Arellano J.L. Barrios M.N. Martin T. Sanchez M.L. Jimenez A. Gonzalez-Buitrago J.M. Respir. Med. 1996; 90: 159-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The progressive lung disease inme v /me v mice is similar to that observed in patients with chronic interstitial lung disease; therefore, proliferating alveolar macrophages may be a source of enzymatically active Ym1 in mice. Why and under what conditions do crystals form? What are the biological functions of Ym1? Is Ym1 production regulated by cytokines? Are the eosinophilic crystals in the biliary tree and other tissues of mice also Ym1? These are some of the questions that remain for further study. Since eosinophilic crystals are usually found at the site of pulmonary inflammation involving macrophages, further studies of the biological activity of Ym1 in mice may reveal new therapeutic avenues.

https://openalex.org/W1978772438,"The CD44 glycoprotein is expressed in multiple isoforms on a variety of cell types where it functions as a receptor for hyaluronan-mediated motility. Recently, interest has centered on CD44 heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) isoforms because of their potential to sequester heparin-binding growth factors and chemokines. Expression of these isoforms on ectodermal cells has recently been shown to regulate limb morphogenesis via presentation of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 4/FGF 8 while expression on tumor cells was shown to sequester hepatocyte growth factor and promote tumor dissemination. To date, however, CD44 HSPG expression in tissue macrophages and lymphocytes has not been adequately investigated, despite the fact these cells actively synthesize growth factors and chemokines and indirect evidence that monocyte CD44 sequesters macrophage inflammatory protein-1β. Here we show primary human monocytes rather than lymphocytes express CD44 HSPGs, but only following in vitro differentiation to macrophages or activation with the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1α or bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Furthermore, we show these isoforms are preferentially modified with heparan rather than chondroitin sulfate, bind the macrophage-derived growth factors FGF-2, vascular endothelial growth factor, and heparin-binding epidermal growth factor with varying affinities (K d 25–330 nm) and in the case of FGF-2, can stimulate productive binding to the high affinity tyrosine kinase FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1). In contrast, we find no evidence for significant binding to C-C chemokines. Last, we confirm by immunofluorescent antibody staining that inflamed synovial membrane macrophages express CD44 HSPGs and that expression is greatest in cells containing high FGF-2 levels.

These results suggest a paracrine role for macrophage CD44 HSPG isoforms in the regulation of growth factor action during inflammation. hyaluronan interleukin-1 tumor necrosis factor-α heparan sulfate proteoglycan heparan sulfate chondroitin sulfate fibroblast growth factor FGF receptor 1 vascular endothelial growth factor heparin-binding epithelial growth factor macrophage inflammatory protein monocyte chemoattractant protein regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted factor phycoerythrin fluorescein isothiocyanate peripheral blood mononuclear cell monocyte-derived macrophage monoclonal antibody phosphate-buffered saline reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis rheumatoid arthritis (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethyoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium fluorescence-activated cell sorter base pair(s) N-methyl-N-(2-N-methyl-N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)aminoethyl)acetamido heparan sulfate The human CD44 molecule is a widely expressed cell surface receptor for hyaluronan (HA)1that occurs in multiple isoforms generated by differential splicing of up to nine alternative exons (v2-v10) into a single site within the extracellular domain (1.Lesley J. Hyman R. Kincade P.W. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 54: 271-335Crossref Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). The common N-terminal ectodomain contains the binding site for hyaluronan within a protein module homologous to the B-domain of cartilage link protein (2.Stamenkovic I. Amiot M. Pesando J.M. Seed B. Cell. 1989; 56: 1057-1062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 3.Goldstein L.A. Zhou D.F. Picker L.J. Minty C.N. Bargatze R.F. Ding J.F. Butcher E.C. Cell. 1989; 56: 1063-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The variable portion is largely mucin-like and differs in length between isoforms according to the number and nature of spliced exons inserted therein (4.Screaton G.R. Bell M.V. Bell J.I. Jackson D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12235-12238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pattern of CD44 alternative splicing is highly tissue-specific (1.Lesley J. Hyman R. Kincade P.W. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 54: 271-335Crossref Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). For example, cells in most normal tissues express only the standard CD44H isoform and constitutive expression of the alternatively spliced variants is restricted almost exclusively to epithelia or neoplastic cells (5.Fox S. Fawcett J. Jackson D.G. Collins I. Gatter K. Harris A. Gearing A. Simmons D. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4539-4546PubMed Google Scholar). In hemopoietic cells and some transformed cell lines, however, alternative splicing of exons including v6 and v9 can be induced by cell activation or by treatment with inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and TNFα (6.Koopman G. Heider K.H. Horst E. Adolf G.R. van den Berg F. Ponta H. Herrlich P. Pals S.T. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 897-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 7.Arch R. Wirth K. Hofmann M. Ponta H.

In rodents, the induced lymphocyte isoforms have also been reported to play a role in T-and B-cell effector functions (7.Arch R. Wirth K. Hofmann M. Ponta H. Matzku S. Herrlich P. Zoller M. Science. 1992; 257: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Potentially, CD44 isoforms could also help regulate leukocyte trafficking into tissues such as the synovial membrane, where CD44 levels on leukocytes are up-regulated by inflammation (11.Haynes B.F. Hale L.P. Patton K.L. Martin M.E. McCallum R.M. Arthritis Rheum. 1991; 34: 1434-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 12.Johnson B.A. Haines G.K. Harlow L.A. Koch A.E. Arthritis Rheum. 1993; 36: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), and interactions with HA or other ligands appear to be critically important for extravasation (13.Mikecz K. Brennan F.R. Kim J.H. Glant T.T. Nature Med. 1995; 1: 558-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 14.Mikecz K. Dennis K. Shi M. Kim J.H. Arthritis Rheum. 1999; 42: 659-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).The precise functions of all the CD44 alternative exons are still not fully clear. However, two general roles have emerged from recent data. First, the insertion of variant exons and their glycosylation can regulate HA-binding, presumably by altering the conformation of the link module (15.Bennett K. Modrell B. Greenfield B. Bartolazzi A. Stamenkovic I. Peach R. Jackson D. Spring F. Aruffo A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1623-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) or by inducing CD44 oligomerization (16.Sleeman J. Rudy W. Hofmann M. Moll J. Herrlich P. Ponta H. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1139-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Second, individual alternative exons may confer binding sites for novel CD44 ligands, unrelated to HA. For example, the v3 exon uniquely contains a motif SGSG that directs O-glycosylation with heparan and chondroitin sulfates and its inclusion is now known to generate CD44 heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) forms that are abundant on epithelial cells (17.Jackson D.G. Bell J.I. Dickinson R. Timans J. Shields J. Whittle N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 673-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 18.Bennett K. Jackson D.G. Simon J.C. Tanczos E. Peach R. Modrell B. Stamenkovic I. Plowman G. Aruffo A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 687-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). One of the main functions associated with HSPGs is the sequestration of heparin-binding growth factors and chemokines. This can increase the half-life of bound growth factor by protecting against proteolytic degradation (19.Saksela O. Moscatelli D. Sommer A. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 743-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in the case of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), sequestration by free heparin or cell surface HSPGs appears to drive growth factor dimerization and subsequent binding and cross-linking of the high affinity signal-transducing receptors (20.Ornitz D.M. Yayon A. Flanagan J.G. Svahn C.M. Levi E. Leder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 21.Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2073) Google Scholar). These same functions may well be shared by CD44 HSPGs. These certainly bind the growth factors FGF-2 and heparin-binding EGF (hbEGF) as first demonstrated using truncated ectodomain constructs in monkey COS cells (18.Bennett K. Jackson D.G. Simon J.C. Tanczos E. Peach R. Modrell B. Stamenkovic I. Plowman G. Aruffo A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 687-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). In addition, CD44 HSPG isoforms identified in the embryonic mouse apical ectodermal ridge have been shown to bind and present FGF-4 and FGF-8 during limb bud development in embryonic mice (22.Sherman L. Wainwright D. Ponta H. Herrlich P. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1058-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and CD44 HSPGs from tumor cells have been shown to present hepatocyte growth factor as a mechanism to increase tumor cell dissemination (23.Van der Voort R. Taher T.E.I. Wielenga V.J.M. Spaargaren M. Prevo R. Smit L. David G. Hartmann G. Gherardi E. Pals S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6499-6506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). To date, however, no quantitative estimates of CD44 HSPG/growth factor binding affinities have been reported.The expression of CD44 HSPGs by hemopoietic cells has received comparatively little attention, despite the fact activated lymphocytes and particularly macrophages up-regulate CD44 (24.Levesque M.C. Haynes B.F. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1557-1565PubMed Google Scholar) and synthesize many heparin-binding growth factors and chemokines. Furthermore, in one report, leukocyte-derived CD44 molecules presumed to carry heparan or chondroitin sulfate chains were shown to sequester the heparin-binding chemokine macrophage inhibitory protein (MIP)-1β (25.Tanaka Y. Adams D.H. Hubscher S. Hirano H. Siebenlist U. Shaw S. Nature. 1993; 361: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). In the light of such evidence we have investigated the expression of CD44 HSPGs on primary human leukocytes and have characterized their ligand-binding properties. Here we show CD44 HSPG isoforms similar to those of neoplastic epithelial cells are inducible specifically on macrophages, that they constitute intermediate affinity receptors for macrophage-derived growth factors FGF-2, VEGF, and hbEGF but not chemokines and that they can present FGF-2 in paracrine fashion to its receptor (FGFR1) on adjacent cells. We further show these CD44 HSPG isoforms are dramatically up-regulated on synovial membrane and subintimal macrophages in inflammatory (rheumatoid) arthritis and co-localize with cells containing cytoplasmic FGF-2. The likely physiological significance of these findings is discussed.DISCUSSIONIn this article we have investigated the expression and likely function of HSPG isoforms of the CD44 HA receptor in primary human macrophages. These cells which differentiate from peripheral blood monocytes play key roles in regulating tissue repair and re-modeling during wound healing and inflammation, and have been implicated in the regulation of tumor angiogenesis (39.Auger M.J. Ross J.A. The Macrophage. Oxford University Press, Oxford1992Google Scholar, 40.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). These functions are thought to be mediated to a large extent by macrophage-derived growth factors and chemokines, many of which contain binding sites for HS and whose interactions with HSPGs have been well documented (41.Schlesinger J. Lax I. Lemmon M. Cell. 1995; 83: 357-360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Examples include the fibroblast growth factors FGF-1, FGF-2, and VEGF which promote mesenchymal proliferation and angiogenesis by triggering the proliferation of fibroblasts and vascular endothelium (42.Burgess W.H. Maciag T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 575-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43.Leung D.W. Cachianes G. Kuang W.J. Goeddel D.V. Ferrara N. Science. 1989; 246: 1306-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (4413) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which macrophages regulate the bioavailability of potent heparin-binding growth factors at appropriate times and in the appropriate tissue locations are not well understood. The results which we have presented in this study provide substantial evidence that HSPG isoforms of CD44 with the capacity to bind such factors are induced on differentiated and cytokine-activated macrophages both in vitro and in vivo and can augment productive binding of FGF-2 to the signal-transducing receptor FGFR1 on adjacent cells. Such findings suggest macrophages may utilize CD44 HSPGs for the paracrine regulation of growth factor action.Using flow cytometric analyses to detect the alternative v3 exon which encodes the motif SGSG for O-glycosylation with HS or CS, we showed that CD44 HSPG isoforms are induced within the first 24 h during differentiation of peripheral blood monocytes to macrophage-like cells. In contrast, we detected little or no CD44 HSPG expression on resting or mitogen (phytohemagglutinin)-activated T-cells or on mitogen-activated B-cells (data not shown). While others have reported isoforms containing the v6 exon are up-regulated upon T-cell activation (6.Koopman G. Heider K.H. Horst E. Adolf G.R. van den Berg F. Ponta H. Herrlich P. Pals S.T. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 897-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 7.Arch R. Wirth K. Hofmann M. Ponta H. Matzku S. Herrlich P. Zoller M. Science. 1992; 257: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 8.Mackay C.R. Terpe H.J. Stauder R. Marston W.L. Stark H. Gunthert U. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), we have consistently found the extent of induction to be small,i.e. less than 2-fold as detected by standard immunofluorescent antibody staining and flow cytometry (44.Screaton G.R. Caceres J.F. Mayeda A. Bell M.V. Plebanski M. Jackson D.G. Bell J.I. Krainer A.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4336-4339Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In macrophages, culture-induced differentiation increased CD44 HSPG expression by more than 5-fold, by a mechanism involving de novo RNA and protein synthesis rather than the mobilization of intracellular stores. In addition, a further 2–3-fold increase in CD44 HSPG expression was induced by the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1α and bacterial lipopolysaccharide. To our knowledge this is the first demonstration that these agents induce CD44 isoform expression in macrophages. Just recently, however, IL-1 was reported to induce CD44 expression in both vascular smooth muscle (45.Foster L. Arkonac B.M. Sibinga N.E.S. Chengwei S. Perella M.A. Haber E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20341-20346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and vascular endothelial cells (10.Fitzgerald K. O'Neill L.A.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4920-4927PubMed Google Scholar), via a transcriptional mechanism critically dependent on an Egr-1 responsive element upstream of the CD44 promoter (10.Fitzgerald K. O'Neill L.A.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4920-4927PubMed Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that IL-1 treatment also increases the HA binding affinity of macrophage CD44 (46.Levesque M.C. Haynes B.F. Cell Immunol. 1999; 193: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and furthermore, that IL-1 can up-regulate synthesis of HA on vascular endothelial cells (47.Mohamadzadeh M. DeGrendele H. Arzipe H. Estess P. Siegelman M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Based upon these and other observations (see below for futher discussion) it has been postulated that interactions between CD44 on monocytes and HA on inflamed endothelia are critical for extravasation at the sites of tissue inflammation (47.Mohamadzadeh M. DeGrendele H. Arzipe H. Estess P. Siegelman M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In the light of our own results, it is highly likely that extravasating monocyte/macrophages also up-regulate expression of CD44 HSPGs and that these isoforms play a role in macrophage functions within inflamed tissue.Consistent with the properties of HSPGs in other cell types (41.Schlesinger J. Lax I. Lemmon M. Cell. 1995; 83: 357-360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), we found the CD44 HSPG isoforms induced in macrophages could sequester heparin-binding growth factors with intermediate affinity. Using radioligand-binding analyses we measured apparent K dvalues of 45 and 330 nm, respectively, for FGF-2, VEGF and hbEGF. These studies represent the first quantitative analyses of CD44-growth factor interactions and both extend and corroborate earlier semiquantitative analyses with Fc fusion proteins expressed in monkey fibroblasts (18.Bennett K. Jackson D.G. Simon J.C. Tanczos E. Peach R. Modrell B. Stamenkovic I. Plowman G. Aruffo A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 687-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Moreover, we showed CD44 HSPGs could augment FGF-stimulated proliferation of BaF cells expressing FGFR1, indicating these proteoglycans can present growth factor in biologically active form. Although these results were obtained using transfected lymphoid cells in which the fine structure of HS may differ from that of MDMs, it is very likely that CD44 HSPGs in primary macrophages share the same properties. Such an argument is supported by the fact that syndecan-2 HS chains display comparable binding and presentation of FGF-2 when the core protein is expressed either in transfected Namalwa cells or in primary macrophages (31.Clasper S. Vekemans S. Fiore M. Plebanski M. Wordsworth P. David G. Jackson D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24113-24123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Our results are therefore consistent with a model in which inflammatory macrophages sequester endogenous or locally synthesized heparin-binding growth factors using coordinately induced cell surface HSPGs for the paracrine regulation of tissue growth.In contrast to growth factors, our studies revealed CD44 HSPGs had little or no affinity for heparin-binding chemokines. Although we surveyed only the C-C chemokines MCP-1, RANTES, and MIP-1β, additional experiments have also indicated little or no binding to the CXC chemokine IL-8. These findings conflict with an earlier report demonstrating that CD44 isolated from peripheral blood monocytes could immobilize MIP-1β and trigger integrin-mediated T-cell adhesion (25.Tanaka Y. Adams D.H. Hubscher S. Hirano H. Siebenlist U. Shaw S. Nature. 1993; 361: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this discrepancy cannot be explained by the fact our binding assays with CD44 HSPGs were conducted using B-lymphoma transfectants in which the pattern of HS sulfation may differ from that of macrophages, as intact MDMs also failed to display HS-mediated chemokine binding (data not shown). A likely explanation is that the HS chains on MDMs and B-lymphoma cells lack the appropriate sugar sulfation for chemokine binding. This is supported by recent evidence indicating that MIP-1β has appreciable affinity only for highly sulfated HS chains (48.Koopman W. Ediriwickrema C. Krangel M.S. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2120-2127PubMed Google Scholar).The various characteristics of macrophage CD44 HSPG expression reported here are strikingly similar to those observed for syndecan-2 (31.Clasper S. Vekemans S. Fiore M. Plebanski M. Wordsworth P. David G. Jackson D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24113-24123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), a member of the larger syndecan family of HSPGs normally expressed on fibrobasts and endothelial cells (49.Lories V. Cassiman J.J. Van den Berghe H. David G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1116-1122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 50.Carey D.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Like CD44, syndecan-2 is specifically up-regulated on macrophages, following in vitrodifferentiation and activation with IL-1 and lipopolysaccharide (31.Clasper S. Vekemans S. Fiore M. Plebanski M. Wordsworth P. David G. Jackson D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24113-24123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In addition, syndecan-2 on macrophages augments binding of FGF-2 to the signal transducing receptor FGFR1 on neighboring cells but does not engage in heparin-dependent chemokine binding. While these properties predict the functions of both syndecan-2 and CD44 HSPGs on macrophages are likely to overlap, others suggest they may have subtle but significant differences. First, each HSPG is likely to be segregated within a different functional domain of the plasma membrane. CD44 molecules inhabit free surface domains and interact with ERM (Ezrin, Radixin, and Moesin) proteins that cross-link actin filaments to the plasma membrane and organize the formation of microvilli (51.Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1497-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In contrast, syndecan-2 molecules interact with PDZ domain proteins and are implicated in the formation of plasma membrane-extracellular matrix signaling complexes involving growth factor receptors, cytoskeletal actin, and membrane-associated guanylate kinases (52.Grootjans J.J. Zimmerman P. Reekemans G. Smets A. Degeest G. Durr J. David G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13683-13688Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 53.Cohen A.R. Wood D.F. Marfatia S.M. Walther Z. Chishti A.H. Anderson J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Second, the two HSPGs differ in size. CD44 HSPG core proteins are composed mostly of mucin-like sequences and the ectodomains can exceed 600 residues in length, while the syndecan-2 ectodomain is only 127 residues long. These differences in dimensions predict the HS chains extend different distances from the surface of the lipid bilayer, and this could in turn result in differences in their capacity to present growth factor to the appropriate receptors through geometric constraints.The physiological significance of CD44 HSPG expression on MDMs is underlined by our finding that these HSPGs are also up-regulatedin vivo on tissue macrophages within the inflamed synovial membrane in rheumatoid arthritis. Previous studies by other groups have revealed that CD44H is abundantly expressed on synovial fibroblasts, lymphocytes, and macrophages from rheumatoid compared with non-inflamed (osteo-arthritic) synovium (11.Haynes B.F. Hale L.P. Patton K.L. Martin M.E. McCallum R.M. Arthritis Rheum. 1991; 34: 1434-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 12.Johnson B.A. Haines G.K. Harlow L.A. Koch A.E. Arthritis Rheum. 1993; 36: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 38.Henderson K.J. Edwards J.C. Worrall J.G. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1994; 53: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and that CD44 isoforms containing v6 and v9 are induced on synovial membrane fibroblasts (54.Croft D.R. Dall P. Davies D. Jackson D.G. McIntyre P. Kramer I.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1680-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), multinucleated “giant cells” or monocyte polykaryons in RA and in various granulomatous inflammatory diseases (24.Levesque M.C. Haynes B.F. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1557-1565PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the importance of CD44 in the recruitment of leukocytes from the circulation and in the maintenance of inflammation in RA has been highlighted by the recent demonstration that mAbs which induce surface shedding of CD44 block leukocyte infiltration and joint swelling in mouse models of rheumatoid arthritis (13.Mikecz K. Brennan F.R. Kim J.H. Glant T.T. Nature Med. 1995; 1: 558-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 14.Mikecz K. Dennis K. Shi M. Kim J.H. Arthritis Rheum. 1999; 42: 659-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 55.Verdrengh M. Holmdahl R. Tarkowski A. Scand. J. Immunol. 1995; 42: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In this present study we have shown using a combination of immunohistochemical staining and immunofluorescence microscopy that macrophages both within and beneath the synovial membrane express CD44 HSPGs while B- and T-cells display little if any expression. The inflammatory response within the rheumatoid synovium is thought to be sustained by the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF-α which in turn induce the production of heparin-binding growth factors such as FGF, VEGF, and PDGF that promote synovial fibroblast proliferation and angiogenesis (56.Feldmann M. Brennan F.M. Maini R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 397-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (2280) Google Scholar, 57.Firestein G.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 3-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Monocytes and macrophages are a likely source of these growth factors since they not only synthesize FGF-2 in response to both IL-1 and TNF but also express the HSPGs syndecan-2 and CD44 that can regulate FGF action (31.Clasper S. Vekemans S. Fiore M. Plebanski M. Wordsworth P. David G. Jackson D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24113-24123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Hence we speculate that CD44 HSPGs and/or syndecan-2 on synovial membrane and subintimal macrophages are involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory arthritis. Should this prove to be the case, then a blockade of glycosaminoglycan-mediated interactions involving CD44 or other cell surface HSPGs will be a useful strategy for anti-inflammatory drug design. The human CD44 molecule is a widely expressed cell surface receptor for hyaluronan (HA)1that occurs in multiple isoforms generated by differential splicing of up to nine alternative exons (v2-v10) into a single site within the extracellular domain (1.Lesley J. Hyman R. Kincade P.W. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 54: 271-335Crossref Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). The common N-terminal ectodomain contains the binding site for hyaluronan within a protein module homologous to the B-domain of cartilage link protein (2.Stamenkovic I. Amiot M. Pesando J.M. Seed B. Cell. 1989; 56: 1057-1062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 3.Goldstein L.A. Zhou D.F. Picker L.J. Minty C.N. Bargatze R.F. Ding J.F. Butcher E.C. Cell. 1989; 56: 1063-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The variable portion is largely mucin-like and differs in length between isoforms according to the number and nature of spliced exons inserted therein (4.Screaton G.R. Bell M.V. Bell J.I. Jackson D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12235-12238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pattern of CD44 alternative splicing is highly tissue-specific (1.Lesley J. Hyman R. Kincade P.W. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 54: 271-335Crossref Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). For example, cells in most normal tissues express only the standard CD44H isoform and constitutive expression of the alternatively spliced variants is restricted almost exclusively to epithelia or neoplastic cells (5.Fox S. Fawcett J. Jackson D.G. Collins I. Gatter K. Harris A. Gearing A. Simmons D. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4539-4546PubMed Google Scholar). In hemopoietic cells and some transformed cell lines, however, alternative splicing of exons including v6 and v9 can be induced by cell activation or by treatment with inflammatory cytokines"
https://openalex.org/W2004748537,"Ganglioside sialidases have been implicated in neuronal differentiation processes, including neurite outgrowth. To understand further the roles and regulation mechanisms of the sialidase in neuronal systems, we have cloned mouse ganglioside sialidase cDNA and observed its expression in Neuro2a cell differentiation. A 3339-base pair cDNA, cloned based on the sequence information of previously cloned enzymes, encodes 418 amino acids containing three Asp boxes characteristic of sialidases. Northern blot analysis revealed a 3.4-kilobase transcript expressed highly in heart but also in several other tissues including brain. In situ hybridization of mouse brain demonstrated the mRNA to be present in the cerebral cortex, as well as in the granule cell layer, Purkinje cells, and deep cerebellar nucleus of the cerebellum. Transient expression of the cDNA in COS-1 cells resulted in over 300-fold increase in sialidase activity toward gangliosides compared with the control level, with a preference for ganglioside substrate. During 5-bromodeoxyuridine-induced Neuro2a cell differentiation, the expression of the sialidase was increased as assessed by activity assays and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses. Stable transfection of the sialidase in Neuro2a cells resulted in accelerated neurite arborization following 5-bromodeoxyuridine treatment, indicating the direct participation of this ganglioside sialidase in neuronal cell differentiation. Ganglioside sialidases have been implicated in neuronal differentiation processes, including neurite outgrowth. To understand further the roles and regulation mechanisms of the sialidase in neuronal systems, we have cloned mouse ganglioside sialidase cDNA and observed its expression in Neuro2a cell differentiation. A 3339-base pair cDNA, cloned based on the sequence information of previously cloned enzymes, encodes 418 amino acids containing three Asp boxes characteristic of sialidases.

In the nervous system, gangliosides have been observed to undergo metabolic alterations during development and have been implicated in various biological phenomena, including neuritogenesis (3.Purpura D.P.

Ganglioside accretion is largest during dendritic arborization and synaptogenesis and is accompanied by marked changes in the ganglioside composition, which then persist during adult life (9.Vanier M.T.

Neuroblastoma cell lines can be triggered to undergo neuronal differentiation with a marked alteration of ganglioside patterns by several pharmacological agents (11.Li R. Ladisch S. J.

On the other hand, a number of exogenous gangliosides are known to cause neuritogenesis, including ganglioside GM1 (14.Facci L. Leon A. Toffano G. Sonnino S. Ghidoni R. Tettamanti G. J. Neurochem. 1984; 42: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), enhances the effects of neurotrophic factors, such as nerve growth factor (15.Ferrari G. Fabris M. Gorio A. Dev.

Biochem. 1983; 94: 303-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) reported that very low amounts of exogenous GQ1b specifically stimulated neurite outgrowth in a human neuroblastoma cell line, GOTO cells. Although the general mechanism by which gangliosides promote neuritogenesis has not been elucidated, their desialylation by endogenous as well as exogenous sialidases has been suggested as a critical event for neuronal differentiation (18.Pitto M.

Res. 1995; 40: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A potent ganglioside sialidase activity, in fact, is located in the neuronal membranes (24.Schengrund C.-L. Rosenberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 6196-6200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with a relative enrichment in the synaptosomal fraction as compared with the neuronal perikarya (23.Saito M. Tanaka Y.

Chem. 1977; 252: 2412-2418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this context, it is necessary to clarify the expression mechanisms of endogenous sialidase responsible for ganglioside degradation in the nervous system. In the present study, we obtained new insights into the role of the ganglioside sialidase during neuronal differentiation by studies with a newly cloned cDNA. Mammalian sialidases, catalyzing the first step in glycoconjugate degradation, have been classified based on their subcellular distribution into at least four types: cytosolic, lysosomal matrix, lysosomal membrane, and plasma membrane (26.Miyagi T. Tsuiki S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 27.Miyagi T. Tsuiki S. J. Biol.

They differ from each other not only in subcellular location but also catalytic and immunological properties. Membrane-associated sialidases hydrolyze gangliosides preferentially, and those in plasma membrane are distinct from lysosomal membrane sialidase in acting specifically on gangliosides residing in the same membrane (28.Miyagi T. Sagawa J. Konno K. Handa S. Tsuiki S. J. Biochem. 1990; 107: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 29.Hata K. Wada T. Hasegawa A. Kiso M. Miyagi T. J.

The spatial and temporal expression of the sialidase mRNA was investigated in adult mouse brain and during differentiation of Neuro2a cells induced by 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd).1 The results revealed the ganglioside sialidase to be widely expressed in the central nervous system and to play a positive regulatory role in differentiation of neuronal cells. Possible mouse ganglioside sialidase cDNA fragments were first amplified by PCR using oligonucleotide primers, based on the amino acid sequences of previously cloned sialidases. One pair of the primers, 1S (5′-GGACACCGGACCATGAACCCCTGTCCT-3′) (sense) and 2A (5′-CCTGGCCCCACAGCAAAAGTGGCCCA-3′) (antisense), and degenerate primers 3S (5′-AC(C/T)TT(C/T)CT(G/C)GCCTT(C/T)GC(A/T)GAG-3′) and 4A (5′ CTG(A/G)AT(A/G) CCAI I(A/G)CC(C/T)GG(G/T)CCIII(A/G)GCAAA-3′) were designed from sequences in regions in which the amino acids of the bovine membrane sialidase are identical to those of rat cytosolic and of human lysosomal sialidases, respectively. The first strand cDNAs were synthesized from poly(A)+ RNA from BALB/c mouse brain, prepared by the acid guanidium-phenol-chloroform extraction procedure (39.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar), followed by oligo(dT) column chromatography, using random primers and murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Superscript RNase H−, Life Technologies, Inc.). The cDNA was then used as a template for PCR under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min, with final elongation at 72 °C for 10 min. Appropriate PCR products were gel purified and blunt end-ligated to the SmaI site of a Bluescript vector. At this step, three positive fragments (MBI, MBIIA, and MBIIB) were obtained. To obtain a complete cDNA, the 3′ and 5′ ends of the mouse membrane sialidase cDNA were extended according to the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) methods described by Frohman et al.(40.Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4341) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. The primer 5A (5′-ATCAGCCCTCGTCTGAGCACCA-3′), derived from the 5′ end sequence obtained from the degenerate PCR product MBIIA, was used in the reverse transcription of the 5′ end of the mRNA from mouse brain poly(A)+ RNA. After reverse transcription, the RNA was degraded by incubation for 15 min at 37 °C with 2 units of RNase H. The purified cDNA was polyadenylated at its 3′ end by incubation with 10 units of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase in the presence of 6 mm ATP at 37 °C for 10 min. The mixture was then heated to 65 °C to denature the enzyme, and the polyadenylated single-strand cDNA (one-tenth of the aliquot of the cDNA pool synthesized above) was applied directly in the first PCR amplification. The poly(A) tail generated was used to initially amplify the cDNA with the (dT)17 adaptor primer (5′-GACTCGAGTCGACATCGATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′), followed by further amplification with the adaptor primer (5′-GACTCGAGTCGACATCG-3′) and the specific primers 6A (5′-AGGCAGCATCCTCATCTCTGAC-3′) and 7A (5′-TCATCTCTGACTGAGGTCCGCT-3′), deduced from the MBIIA fragment. In the first amplification, the cDNA was amplified using 37.5 pmol of (dT)17 adaptor, 12.5 pmol of adaptor, and 25 pmol of 6A primer, using the following conditions: 95 °C for 5 min, 3 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min followed by 37 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min with final elongation at 72 °C for 10 min. A 2-μl aliquot of the PCR product was reamplified using 25 pmol of each of the nested primers, adaptor, and 7A primer, under the same conditions except for an annealing temperature of 55 °C. For derivation of the 3′ end, a (dT)17 adaptor, an adaptor, and a set of oligonucleotides, 8S (5′-TTGACCGAGGAGGTCATTGG-3′) and 9S (5′-TCATTGGCTCAGAGGTGAAG-3′) primers specific to the 3′ end sequence of the MBIIA fragment, were used as primers. First strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription of mouse brain poly(A)+ RNA (1 μg) using the (dT)17 adaptor primer. The single-stranded cDNA generated by reverse transcription was purified from primers using a NICK column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The cDNA (one-tenth of the aliquot synthesized above) as template, adaptor (12.5 pmol), and primer 8S (25 pmol) were used for amplification as described above. A 2-μl sample of the product was reamplified in 50 μl with adaptor primer (25 pmol) and a nested specific primer (9S, 25 pmol). Mouse cytosolic sialidase was cloned based on the primary structure of rat cytosolic sialidase by RT-PCR and RACE methods in a manner similar to that described above. Degenerate primers (sense, 5′-GAAGTCTATGCTTAC(A/C)GIA(T/C)CC-3′; antisense, 5′-AGCTTCCGGTAGGCATAAGC-3′) were used in combination with template cDNA reverse-transcribed from mouse skeletal muscle poly(A)+ RNA. A 513-bp PCR fragment was obtained, and its 5′ and 3′ sequences were extended by the RACE methods using specific primers derived from the fragment sequence: for 5′-RACE, mcSD1A (5′-TGCTGGCTCGCTTTTCCGCAAA-3′), mcSD2A (AAAGGCCAGCAGGGTCTTCTGCTT-3′), and mcSD3A (5′-TGCTTCTTCAGGTAGAGCAGAGCA-3′); for 3′-RACE, mcSD4S (5′-GTCTGCAGCTGC GGAACCCAGCT-3′) and mcSD5S (5′-AGCTGGGAGCCTGCTGGTACCT-3′). The appropriate PCR products in Bluescript were sequenced with a Model 4200L-2 DNA autosequencer (LI-COR) using a Thermo Sequenase Cycle Sequencing Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with fluorescence-labeled M13 forward and reverse primers. Nucleotide and amino acid sequences thus obtained were compared with the nonredundant sequence data bases present at the National Center for Biotechnology Information using the BLAST network service. Multiple amino acid sequence alignment was performed using the Parallel Protein Information Analysis system (41.Akiyama Y. Onizuka K. Noguchi T. Ando M. Proceedings of the 9th Genome Informatics Workshop. Universal Academy Press, Tokyo1998: 131-141Google Scholar) (Parallel Application TRC Laboratory, Real World Computing Partnership, Tsukuba, Japan). Protein sorting signals and subcellular localization were predicted using the PSORT World Wide Web server (42.Nakai K. Horton P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 34-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1839) Google Scholar). To construct the sialidase expression plasmid, a set of primers, 10S (5′-CCCGAATTCGCCATGGAGGAAGTCCCA-3′) and 11A (5′-CCCGAATTCTTAGTCGCTACTAGGGCT-3′), both containing EcoRI restriction sites at the 5′ end, was used to amplify the sequence encoding the entire open reading frame, including the Kozak sequence (43.Kozak M. J. Cell. Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar), with the template cDNA synthesized from mouse brain poly(A)+ RNA. After digestion with EcoRI, PCR products were ligated into the EcoRI site of the pME18S eukaryotic expression vector. The presence, orientation, and fidelity of the cDNA in the vector were confirmed by digestion of restriction enzyme and DNA sequencing. To verify the ganglioside-hydrolyzing sialidase activity, COS-1 cells (Riken Cell Bank) were transfected by electroporation with the empty expression vector or the expression vector containing the mouse ganglioside sialidase cDNA by the following procedures. Cells washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were resuspended in HEPES-PBS at a final concentration of 1.0 × 107 cells/ml, and an aliquot of the suspension (750 μl) was added to sterile cuvettes with 40 μg of plasmid DNA. The cuvette was placed on ice for 10 min and electroporated at 240 V, 975 μF using a Bio-Rad Genepulser. The cuvette was placed on ice for an additional 10 min, and cells were cultured in 40 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with penicillin (100 IU/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. After 48 h, cells were pelleted, lysed in 9 volumes of ice-cold PBS by sonication, and centrifuged at 1000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant (crude homogenate) was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h. The resulting supernatant and pellet were used as cytosolic and membrane fractions, respectively, and were assayed for sialidase activity with various substrates that included gangliosides. Stable transfectants of the sialidase were obtained using mouse neuroblastoma Neuro2a cells (American Type Culture Collection, CCL-131), cultured in DMEM containing high glucose supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. After overnight culture at 2 × 105 cells per 35-mm culture dish, cells at 50–60% confluence were washed with serum-free medium and then incubated with a DNA (2 μg)-PLUS (6 μl)-LipofectAMINE (8 μl) (Life Technologies, Inc.) reagent complex for 5 h. At 48 h after lipofection, selection started in growth medium containing 500 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Following 5 weeks of selection, discrete colonies were subcloned and expanded. Sialidase activity was assayed using various substrates as described elsewhere (27.Miyagi T. Tsuiki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6710-6716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction mixture contained 30 nmol of substrate as bound sialic acid, 0.2 mg of bovine serum albumin, 10 μmol of sodium acetate (pH 4.6), and 0.2 mg of Triton X-100. After incubation at 37 °C for 10–30 min, released sialic acid was determined by the thiobarbituric acid method of Aminoff (44.Aminoff D. Biochem. J. 1961; 81: 384-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (1443) Google Scholar). Sialidase activity toward 4-methylumbelliferyl-neuraminic acid was assayed by spectrofluorometrical measurement of 4-methylumbelliferone released. To determine the pH profile of the activity, HEPES, 2-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid, and citrate-phosphate buffers also were used. One unit of sialidase was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the release of 1 nmol of sialic acid/h. Cells (107) harvested at subconfluency were washed with PBS and lyophilized. The glycolipids were extracted in sequence with 5 ml of chloroform/methanol (C/M) (1:1, v/v), 2.5 ml of C/M (2:1, v/v), and 2.5 ml of C/M (1:2, v/v), and then evaporated to dryness. After desalting by dialysis, the glycolipids were again lyophilized and dissolved in a small volume of C/M (2:1, v/v), and one-tenth of the amount was chromatographed on high performance thin layer chromatographic plates (Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ) in C/M/0.5% CaCl2 (60:40:9, v/v/v). Glycolipids were visualized with the orcinol-H2SO4. To determine the cellular sialic acids, the glycolipid extracts (lipid-bound sialic acid) and the residues after extraction (protein-bound sialic acid) were treated in 0.1 n H2SO4 at 80 °C for 1 h and assayed for sialic acids. To estimate small amounts of sialic acids, fluorometric high performance liquid chromatography with 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylene dioxybenzene was employed (45.Hara S. Yaguchi M. Takemori Y. Nakamura M. J. Chromatogr. 1986; 377: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Neuro2a cells were initially grown in DMEM with penicillin, streptomycin, and 5% fetal bovine serum, with cell passage every 2–3 days. They were seeded in 150-cm2 sterile tissue culture flasks at a density of 2 × 104/cm2. After overnight incubation in the above medium, cells were exposed for variable periods (0–5 days) to 0.25 mm BrdUrd (46.Chatterjee D. Chakraborty M. Anderson G.M. Brain Res. 1992; 583: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The morphology of the cells was examined, and photographs were taken at × 100 magnification. To quantify neuritogenesis, five randomly chosen fields in each flask were counted, and cells bearing neurites at least 1.5-fold the length of the soma diameter were considered as differentiated. All of the cells collected were assayed for sialidase activity using bovine brain mixed gangliosides as substrates and for acetylcholinesterase activity using the spectrophotometric procedure described by Ellman et al. (47.Ellman G.L. Courtney K.D. Andres Jr., V. Featherstone R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21721) Google Scholar).Total RNAs were extracted for quantitative PCR by the acid guanidium-phenol-chloroform extraction procedure (39.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). To evaluate the mRNA level of the sialidase in variously differentiated Neuro2a cells, we adopted competitive PCR methods (48.Gilliland G. Perrin S. Blanchard K. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2725-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1419) Google Scholar) using the deleted mouse sialidase cDNA clone as a competitor. The competitor cDNA was prepared by double-digestion of the mouse sialidase cDNA encoding the entire open reading frame in Bluescript vector with MunI and BbsI. From 5 μg of total RNA, cDNA was synthesized using 200 units of MoMuLV-RT and oligo(dT) primers in a final volume of 20 μl. 10 μl of the 25-fold-diluted solution was subjected to quantitative PCR analysis. PCR amplifications were performed with a set of primer pairs 12S (5′-GCCATGGAGGAAGTCCCA-3′) and 13A (5′-TTAGTCGCTACTAGGGCT-3′) under the following conditions: 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 54 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C for 40 cycles, preceded by 10 min at 95 °C and followed by 10 min at 72 °C, generating a 1254-bp product from the target cDNA and a 937-bp product from the competitor cDNA. The quantitative PCR analysis consisted of two steps: the first PCR for rough measurement using 10 fg of competitor DNA, and the second PCR for precise quantification based on the amount of target DNA estimated from the first PCR. To check for sample-to-sample variation, the expression level of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (49.Sabath D.E. Broome H.E. Prystowsky M.B. Gene. 1990; 91: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) was measured for each cDNA sample using a GAPDH competitor, prepared by digestion of the 0.5-kilobase cDNA (nucleotides 566–1017) withStyI and BspMI. After amplification, 10-μl aliquots were electrophoresed in 1% agarose gels, followed by photographic recording of the gels stained with ethidium bromide. Gel photos were scanned and densitometric analyses of PCR products were performed using the image analysis program NIH Image, version 1.61 (Research Services Branch, NIMH, National Institutes of Health). Under the PCR conditions, a linear correlation between the densitometry intensity and amount of template was also confirmed using standard cDNAs. Mouse multiple tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH) were hybridized with an [α-32P]dCTP-labeled MBIIA fragment amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, according to the manufacturer's specifications. After overnight incubation at 42 °C, membranes were washed twice in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 42 °C for 30 min and used to expose imaging plates. The radioactivity was visualized with an Image Analyzer BAS2000 system (Fuji Photo Film). The tissue mRNA level was further estimated by quantitative RT-PCR methods as described above. The mouse sialidase cDNA fragment stretching from base 374 to 769 was cloned into the Bluescript vector in the correct orientation. To generate sense and antisense probes, the plasmids were then linearized by HindIII and XbaI and transcribed by T3 and T7 RNA polymerase, respectively, in the presence of digoxigenin-labeled UTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Probes were fragmented to approximately 150 bp in length by alkaline treatment before use. Sagittal sections (15-μm) of brain from a 7-week-old BALB/c mouse were cut on a Micron cryostat at −20 °C and thaw-mounted onto silane coated slides. The sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde plus 0.5% glutaraldehyde/PBS and incubated with 10 μg/ml proteinase K for 30 min at 37 °C. After acetylation with 0.25% acetic anhydride for 10 min in room temperature, the sections were dehydrated and prehybridized for 1 h at 48 °C in a hybridization buffer consisting of 50% deionized formamide, 4× SSC, 20% dextran sulfate, 1× Denhardt's solution, and 0.25 mg/ml yeast tRNA. They were then incubated with an antisense riboprobe (or a sense probe as a negative control) at 48 °C overnight in a humidified box followed by successive incubations in 2× SSC at 48 °C for 15 min twice, in 2× SSC with 100 μg/ml RNaseA at 37 °C for 30 min, and in 0.1× SSC at room temperature for 10 min. Positive signals were detected by immunoassay with anti-digoxigenin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate and the color substrates NBT/X-phosphate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The PCR with primers designed on the basis of conserved amino acid sequences between bovine membrane and rat cytosolic sialidases yielded a specific product MBI of 240 bp showing 80% amino acid sequence identity with the bovine sialidase.

Synaptosome-associated 23-kDa protein (SNAP23) is a widely expressed isoform of SNAP25, the principal t-SNARE of neuronal cells, and colocalizes with syntaxin4 in the plasma membrane of 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In the present study, two SNAP23 mutants, SNAP23-ΔC8 (amino acids 1 to 202) and SNAP23-ΔC49 (amino acids 1 to 161), were generated to determine whether SNAP23 is required for insulin-induced translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Wild-type SNAP23 (SNAP23-WT) promoted the interaction between syntaxin4 and VAMP2 both in vitro andin vivo. Although SNAP23-ΔC49 bound to neither syntaxin4 nor VAMP2, the SNAP23-ΔC8 mutant bound to syntaxin4 but not to VAMP2. In addition, although SNAP23-ΔC8 bound to syntaxin4, it did not mediate the interaction between syntaxin4 and VAMP2. Moreover, overexpression of SNAP23-ΔC8 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer inhibited insulin-induced translocation of GLUT4 but not that of GLUT1. In contrast, overexpression of neither SNAP23-WT nor SNAP23-ΔC49 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes affected the translocation of GLUT4 or GLUT1.

Insulin achieves this effect by inducing the translocation of GLUT4 glucose transporters from an intracellular vesicular compartment to the plasma membrane. Under basal conditions, GLUT4 cycles slowly between this intracellular compartment and the plasma membrane (1.Rea S. James D.E.

However, activation of insulin receptors triggers a large increase in the rate of exocytosis of GLUT4-containing vesicles and a smaller decrease in the rate of GLUT4 internalization by endocytosis (3.Holman G.D. Kozka I.J. Clark A.E. Flower C.J. Saltis J. Habberfield A.D. Simpson I.A. Cushman S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18172-18179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Yang J. Holman G.D. J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 17710-17715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Intracellular membrane fusion is mediated by evolutionarily conserved membrane proteins known as solubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF)1 attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) (7.Rothman J.E.

SNARE proteins that contribute to neuronal exocytosis include the synaptic vesicle protein synaptobrevin (also referred to as VAMP) and the plasma membrane proteins synaptosome-associated 25-kDa protein and syntaxin1A. These proteins readily assemble into a stable ternary complex; however, disassembly of this complex can be reversibly induced by the ATPase NSF in conjunction with soluble cofactors termed SNAPs (soluble NSF-attachment proteins) (9.Söllner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2603) Google Scholar). The formation of the SNARE complex is thought to be a critical step in the pathway leading to membrane fusion.The insulin-stimulated trafficking of GLUT4 vesicles in adipocytes shares several features with the regulated pathway of synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Thus, members of the synaptobrevin (VAMP) family of proteins were shown to localize to GLUT4 vesicles in rat adipocytes (10.Cain C.C. Trimble W.S. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11681-11684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins were identified as VAMP2 and cellubrevin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (11.Volchuk A. Sargeant R. Sumitani S. Liu Z. He L. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8233-8240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and were subsequently shown to be essential for insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation in these cells (12.Tamori Y.

Gould C.W. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1444-1452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Furthermore, syntaxin isoform 4 was shown to contribute to the translocation of GLUT4 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (14.Olson A. Knight J.B. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2425-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In addition, SNAP23, a widely expressed isoform of SNAP25 (15.Ravichadran V. Chawla A. Roche P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13300-13303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), was shown to be present in the plasma membrane of 3T3-L1 adipocytes (16.Araki S. Tamori Y.

J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19740-19746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Thus, SNAP23 in adipocytes, like SNAP25 in neurons, may function in the exocytosis of intracellular vesicles.We have now investigated the possible role of SNAP23 as a functional plasma membrane t-SNARE in insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. Our data demonstrate that SNAP23 is required for insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane and that it mediates the formation of a complex between syntaxin4 and VAMP2.DISCUSSIONWe have shown that the SNAP23 mutant SNAP23-ΔC8, which binds to syntaxin4 but not to VAMP2, inhibits the translocation of GLUT4, but not that of GLUT1, to the plasma membrane in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. This inhibition of GLUT4 translocation is likely attributable to prevention of the formation of a ternary SNARE complex among SNAP23, syntaxin4, and VAMP2 at the plasma membrane of these cells. Thus, SNAP-23 appears to function as a t-SNARE in the translocation of GLUT4 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.SNAP23 was identified as a widely expressed homolog of SNAP25 (15.Ravichadran V. Chawla A. Roche P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13300-13303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Although SNAP25 is essential for exocytotic membrane fusion in neurons, this t-SNARE does not appear to be expressed in most nonneural tissues, with the exception of pancreatic islets of Langerhans (34.Sadoul K.

In contrast, SNAP-23 was shown not only to be expressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (16.Araki S. Tamori Y. Kawanishi M. Shinoda H. Masugi J. Mori H. Niki T. Okazawa H. Kubota T. Kasuga M. Biochem. Biophys.

James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18784-18792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), both of which are implicated as important mediators of the translocation of GLUT4 (12.Tamori Y.

Biol. 1997; 17: 2425-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). These observations thus suggest that SNAP23 plays an important role as a plasma membrane t-SNARE, functioning together with syntaxin4 and VAMP2 in the translocation of GLUT4 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Furthermore, the observation that botulinum neurotoxin E, which cleaves SNAP25 but not SNAP23, does not markedly inhibit insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (42.Macaulay S.L. Rea S. Gough G.H. Ward C.W. James D.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 388-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) is consistent with the hypothesis that SNAP23, but not SNAP25, functions as a t-SNARE in the translocation of GLUT4 in these cells.SNAP25 is hydrolyzed by botulinum neurotoxin E between Arg180 and Ile181 and is also cleaved by botulinum neurotoxin A between Gln197 and Arg198 (43.Schiavo G. Santucci A. Dasgupta B.R. Mehta P.P. Jontes J. Benfenati F. Wilson M.C. Monteccuco C. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Removal of the nine COOH-terminal residues of SNAP25, which yields a fragment corresponding to that generated by neurotoxin A, reduces the extent of the interaction between SNAP25 and VAMP2 but not of that between SNAP25 and syntaxin1 (29.Chapman E.R. An S. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27427-27432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Neither of these neurotoxins hydrolyzes SNAP23 (31.Chen F. Foran P. Shone C.C. Foster K.A. Melling J. Dolly J.O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5719-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 42.Macaulay S.L. Rea S. Gough G.H. Ward C.W. James D.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 388-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We therefore constructed two SNAP23 mutants. SNAP23-ΔC8 lacks the eight COOH-terminal amino acids of the full-length protein and corresponds to the fragment of SNAP25 generated by neurotoxin A, whereas SNAP23-ΔC49 lacks the COOH-terminal coiled-coil region. The observation that SNAP23-ΔC8 retained the ability to bind syntaxin4 but was not able to bind VAMP2 is consistent with the binding properties of the SNAP25 fragment lacking the nine COOH-terminal residues of the full-length protein. However, whereas the binding of SNAP23-ΔC49 to syntaxin4 was markedly reduced compared with that of the wild-type protein, the binding affinity of the NH2-terminal half of SNAP25 for syntaxin1 was similar to that of the full-length protein (29.Chapman E.R. An S. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27427-27432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This difference between SNAP23 and SNAP25 may result from the fact that SNAP25 contains two putative coiled-coil domains, which are thought to be important for association with syntaxins in its NH2-terminal region, whereas SNAP23-ΔC49 contains only one such domain; the COOH-terminal coiled-coil region of SNAP23 may thus be important for the interaction with syntaxin4. Although both overexpressed SNAP23-WT and SNAP23-ΔC8 expressed in the plasma membrane of 3T3-L1 adipocytes formed a complex with endogenous syntaxin4, only SNAP23-WT interacted to a substantial extent with VAMP2 localized on GLUT4 vesicles. This observation is consistent with our in vitro data showing that only the complex of SNAP23-WT with syntaxin4, not that of SNAP23-ΔC8 with syntaxin4, bound to GST-VAMP2. It is therefore likely that SNAP23-ΔC8 inhibited the translocation of GLUT4 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by interfering with formation of a ternary SNARE complex consisting of SNAP23, syntaxin4, and VAMP2.Recent electron microscopic, spectroscopic, and x-ray crystallographic data indicate that SNAREs form a rod-shaped complex consisting of a coiled-coil of four α helices, one contributed by the v-SNARE (VAMP) and three by the t-SNAREs (one by syntaxin and two by SNAP25). The syntaxin and SNAP25 helices are knit together by many nonpolar interactions that hold VAMP in position in the four-helix coiled coil; the binary t-SNARE complex (syntaxin and SNAP25) forms a cradle-like structure to which the v-SNARE (VAMP) appears to bind (44.Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). On the basis of these observations, it is likely that the coiled coil of three α helices formed by syntaxin4 and SNAP23-ΔC8 cannot associate with the α helix of VAMP2 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. A synthetic peptide corresponding to the 24 COOH-terminal amino acids of SNAP23 inhibits insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation to the surface of permeabilized 3T3-L1 adipocytes (41.Rea S. Martin L.B. McIntosh S. Macaulay S.L. Ramsdale T. Baldini G. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18784-18792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, this peptide did not interfere with the formation in vitro of a functional SNARE complex comprising syntaxin4, SNAP23, and VAMP2, as revealed by surface plasmon resonance (41.Rea S. Martin L.B. McIntosh S. Macaulay S.L. Ramsdale T. Baldini G. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18784-18792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In contrast, our results indicate that SNAP23 functions in the translocation of GLUT4 by promoting the interaction between syntaxin4 and VAMP2.GLUT4 appears to be localized to at least two intracellular compartments: the endosomal compartment and a post-endocytotic compartment (13.Martin L.B. Shewan A. Millar C.A. Gould C.W. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1444-1452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In contrast, GLUT1 is predominantly targeted to the recycling endosomal compartment (45.Martin S. Rice J.E. Gould G.W. Keller S.R. Slot J.W. James D.E. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2281-2291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46.Martin S. Tellam J. Livingstone C. Slot J.W. Gould G.W. James D.E. J.

J. 1996; 315: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). It must, however, be added that several studies show that GLUT1 and GLUT4 largely co-localize in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (32.Calderhead D.M. Kitagawa W. Tanner L.I. Holman G.D. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13801-13808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48.El-Jack A.K. Kandor K.V. Pilch P.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1581-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Further investigations are needed to clarify the degree of the colocalization of intracellular GLUT1 and GLUT4 in adipocytes. Our observation that overexpression of SNAP23-ΔC8 inhibited translocation of GLUT4 but not that of GLUT1 suggests that SNAP23 may regulate the post-endocytotic compartment but not the endosomal compartment. Consistent with these data, introduction of antibodies to SNAP23 or a synthetic peptide corresponding to the 24 COOH-terminal amino acids of SNAP23 into 3T3-L1 adipocytes inhibited insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation but not that of GLUT1 (41.Rea S. Martin L.B. McIntosh S. Macaulay S.L. Ramsdale T. Baldini G. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18784-18792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the observations that syntaxin4 (14.Olson A. Knight J.B. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2425-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and VAMP2 (13.Martin L.B. Shewan A. Millar C.A. Gould C.W. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1444-1452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) participate in the translocation of GLUT4, but not that of GLUT1, suggest that the SNARE complex comprising syntaxin4, SNAP23, and VAMP2 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes contributes to regulated exocytosis in these cells. Possible reasons why SNAP23-ΔC8 did not completely inhibit insulin-induced glucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes may be explained by its lack of effect on insulin-induced translocation of GLUT1 or to GLUT4 proteins, which were not inhibited by the SNAP23-ΔC8 and translocated to plasma membrane.Analysis of neuronal SNARE proteins (syntaxin1, SNAP25, and VAMP2) has revealed that, whereas VAMP2 binds weakly to syntaxin1 in the absence of SNAP25, the presence of SNAP25 greatly increases the affinity of the interaction between these two proteins (27.McMahon H.T. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2213-2217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 28.Pevsner J. Hsu S.C. Braun J.E.A. Calakos N. Ting A.E. Bennett M.K.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Similarly, we have shown that SNAP23 also increases the extent of the interaction between VAMP2 and syntaxin4 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. However, another in vitro study concerning SNAP23 reports that SNAP23 proteins did not potentiate VAMP2 binding to syntaxin4 (49.Foster L.J. Yeung B. Mohtashami M. Ross K. Trimble W.S. Klip A.

Although the reason for the difference is not clear, we confirmed by in vivo (Fig. 1) and in vitro (Fig. 3) studies that SNAP23 potentiates the association between VAMP2 and syntaxin4. The syntaxin4-binding protein Munc18c inhibits the interaction between syntaxin4 and SNAP23 (16.Araki S. Tamori Y. Kawanishi M. Shinoda H. Masugi J. Mori H. Niki T. Okazawa H. Kubota T. Kasuga M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) as well as that between syntaxin4 and VAMP2 (50.Thurmond D.C. Ceresa B.P. Okada S. Elmendorf J.S. Coker K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33876-33883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), suggesting that this protein may negatively regulate the association between syntaxin4 and SNAP23 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Dissociation of Munc18c from syntaxin4 may result in the formation of the syntaxin4-SNAP23-VAMP2 complex and thereby lead to fusion of GLUT4 vesicles with the plasma membrane.In conclusion, we have shown that SNAP23, acting together with syntaxin4 and VAMP2, mediates the translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The mechanism by which insulin regulates the formation of the syntaxin4-SNAP23-VAMP2 complex remains to be determined. A primary function of insulin is to stimulate the transport of glucose into target tissues, prominent among which are skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and adipose tissue. Insulin achieves this effect by inducing the translocation of GLUT4 glucose transporters from an intracellular vesicular compartment to the plasma membrane. Under basal conditions, GLUT4 cycles slowly between this intracellular compartment and the plasma membrane (1.Rea S. James D.E. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1667-1677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Kandror K.V. Pilch P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: E1-E14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, activation of insulin receptors triggers a large increase in the rate of exocytosis of GLUT4-containing vesicles and a smaller decrease in the rate of GLUT4 internalization by endocytosis (3.Holman G.D. Kozka I.J. Clark A.E. Flower C.J. Saltis J. Habberfield A.D. Simpson I.A. Cushman S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18172-18179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Yang J. Holman G.D. J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 17820-17829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the former action likely contributing most to the insulin-induced increase in the amount of GLUT4 in the plasma membrane (6.Jhun B.H. Rampal A.L. Liu H. Lachaal M. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17710-17715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Intracellular membrane fusion is mediated by evolutionarily conserved membrane proteins known as solubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF)1 attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) (7.Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1995) Google Scholar, 8.Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). SNARE proteins that contribute to neuronal exocytosis include the synaptic vesicle protein synaptobrevin (also referred to as VAMP) and the plasma membrane proteins synaptosome-associated 25-kDa protein and syntaxin1A. These proteins readily assemble into a stable ternary complex; however, disassembly of this complex can be reversibly induced by the ATPase NSF in conjunction with soluble cofactors termed SNAPs (soluble NSF-attachment proteins) (9.Söllner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2603) Google Scholar). The formation of the SNARE complex is thought to be a critical step in the pathway leading to membrane fusion. The insulin-stimulated trafficking of GLUT4 vesicles in adipocytes shares several features with the regulated pathway of synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Thus, members of the synaptobrevin (VAMP) family of proteins were shown to localize to GLUT4 vesicles in rat adipocytes (10.Cain C.C. Trimble W.S. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11681-11684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins were identified as VAMP2 and cellubrevin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (11.Volchuk A. Sargeant R. Sumitani S. Liu Z. He L. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8233-8240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and were subsequently shown to be essential for insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation in these cells (12.Tamori Y.

Gould C.W. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1444-1452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Furthermore, syntaxin isoform 4 was shown to contribute to the translocation of GLUT4 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (14.Olson A. Knight J.B. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2425-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In addition, SNAP23, a widely expressed isoform of SNAP25 (15.Ravichadran V. Chawla A. Roche P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13300-13303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), was shown to be present in the plasma membrane of 3T3-L1 adipocytes (16.Araki S. Tamori Y. Kawanishi M. Shinoda H. Masugi J. Mori H. Niki T. Okazawa H. Kubota T. Kasuga M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and to be colocalized with syntaxin4 in these cells (17.Tamori Y. Kawanishi M. Niki T. Shinoda H. Araki S. Okazawa H. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19740-19746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Thus, SNAP23 in adipocytes, like SNAP25 in neurons, may function in the exocytosis of intracellular vesicles. We have now investigated the possible role of SNAP23 as a functional plasma membrane t-SNARE in insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. Our data demonstrate that SNAP23 is required for insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane and that it mediates the formation of a complex between syntaxin4 and VAMP2. DISCUSSIONWe have shown that the SNAP23 mutant SNAP23-ΔC8, which binds to syntaxin4 but not to VAMP2, inhibits the translocation of GLUT4, but not that of GLUT1, to the plasma membrane in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. This inhibition of GLUT4 translocation is likely attributable to prevention of the formation of a ternary SNARE complex among SNAP23, syntaxin4, and VAMP2 at the plasma membrane of these cells. Thus, SNAP-23 appears to function as a t-SNARE in the translocation of GLUT4 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.SNAP23 was identified as a widely expressed homolog of SNAP25 (15.Ravichadran V. Chawla A. Roche P.A.

Although SNAP25 is essential for exocytotic membrane fusion in neurons, this t-SNARE does not appear to be expressed in most nonneural tissues, with the exception of pancreatic islets of Langerhans (34.Sadoul K.

Mutations at a singleN-glycosylation sequon of tyrosinase have been reported to be responsible for oculocutaneous albinism type IA in humans, characterized by inactive tyrosinase and the total absence of pigmentation. To probe the role that each N-glycosylation site plays in the synthesis of biologically active tyrosinase, we analyzed the calnexin mediated folding of tyrosinaseN-glycosylation mutants. We have determined that four of the six potential N-glycosylation sites, including that associated with albinism, are occupied. Analysis of the folding pathway and activity of 15 tyrosinase mutants lacking one or more of the occupied N-glycosylation sites shows that glycans at any two N-glycosylation sites are sufficient to interact with calnexin and give partial activity, but a specific pair of sites (Asn86 and Asn371) is required for full activity. The mutants with less than two N-glycosylation sites do not interact with calnexin and show a complete absence of enzyme activity. Copper analysis of selected mutants suggests that the observed partial activity is due to two populations with differential copper content. By correlating the degree of folding with the activity of tyrosinase, we propose a local folding mechanism for tyrosinase that can explain the mechanism of inactivation of tyrosinaseN-glycosylation mutants found in certain pigmentation disorders.

Methods Enzymol. 1987; 142: 154-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The presence of two copper atoms in the active site is essential for activity. The enzyme also has sixN-glycosylation sequons (Fig.1). All six potentialN-glycosylation sites are conserved in human and mouse tyrosinase (2.Muller G. Ruppert S. Schmid E. Schutz G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2723-2730Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), suggesting that the glycosylation may be functionally relevant. The absence of tyrosinase activity is associated with oculocutaneous albinism in many animal species, including humans (3.Witkop Jr., C.J. Clin. Dermatol. 1989; 7: 80-91Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This inborn disorder is characterized by the absence of melanin in the skin, hair, and eyes and a series of related abnormalities of the ocular system. Several mutations within the tyrosinase gene of individuals with type I oculocutaneous albinism have been reported, including a substitution in codon 371 causing a putative amino acid change from threonine (ACA) to lysine (AAA) causing abolition of the sixth potential N-glycosylation site (4.Spritz R.A.

Witkop Jr., C.J. Kwon B.S. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1993; 52: 406-413PubMed Google Scholar). We have found that following treatment of mouse melanoma cells withN-butyldeoxynojirimicin (NB-DNJ), an inhibitor of α-glucosidases I and II, the resulting expressed tyrosinase, which carries immature Glc3Man7–9GlcNAc2 N-glycans, is catalytically inactive and fails to initiate melanin biosynthesis (6.Petrescu S.M.

We and others have shown that tyrosinase activity is dependent on the interaction between tyrosinase and calnexin during the initial stages of folding (7.Toyofuku K. Wada I. Hirosaki K. Park J.S. Hori Y. Jimbow K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 8.Branza-Nichita N. Petrescu A.J. Dwek R.A. Wormald M.R. Platt F.M. Petrescu S.M. Biochem. Biophys.

Calnexin and calreticulin are two lectin-like chaperones that interact transiently with partially trimmedN-linked oligosaccharides of the newly synthesized glycoprotein, their substrates being incompletely folded, monoglucosylated proteins (9.Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. Cell. 1995; 81: 425-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Calnexin is part of the folding/quality control mechanism within the endoplasmic reticulum, along with other endoplasmic reticulum chaperones and the enzymes α-glucosidase II and UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyl transferase (GT) (10.Rodan A.R. Simons J.F. Trombetta E.S. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6921-6930Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 11.Zapun A. Petrescu S.M. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.

Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3779) Google Scholar) and GT, the latter only recognizing denatured or incompletely folded proteins (13.Parodi A.J.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8108-8116Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Thus, the substrates of these chaperones are driven through a cycle of deglucosylation/reglucosylation and returned to the cycle by GT as long as the native conformation is not achieved (15.Sousa M.C. Ferrero Garcia M.A. Parodi A.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Interference in the early stages of glycan processing prevents the interaction of tyrosinase with calnexin and leads to inactive enzyme being produced (6.Petrescu S.M. Petrescu A.J. Titu H.N.

Although it is now accepted that calnexin promotes folding of tyrosinase by interacting with monoglucosylated N-glycans (7.Toyofuku K. Wada I. Hirosaki K. Park J.S. Hori Y. Jimbow K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 8.Branza-Nichita N. Petrescu A.J. Dwek R.A. Wormald M.R. Platt F.M. Petrescu S.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 720-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), it remains unclear as to whether glycans at all six of the potential N-glycosylation sites of the polypeptide chain are involved in these interactions and hence in folding. The object of this paper is to probe the role that each of the six individual N-glycosylation sites plays in the synthesis of biologically active tyrosinase. We have identified theN-glycosylation sites that are normally occupied in tyrosinase (four of the six). Fifteen tyrosinase mutants have been constructed lacking one or more of these four sites using site-directed mutagenesis and have been transiently expressed in CHO cells. We measured the enzymatic activity of the wild type and recombinant tyrosinases and investigated their kinetics of folding and calnexin interaction. These studies show that the mutants with less than two glycans do not interact with calnexin and have no enzymatic activity. Any pair of the four normal glycans is sufficient to give an interaction with calnexin resulting in partial activity, but only one specific pair reproduces the folding kinetics of the wild type protein and gives full activity. The analysis of copper content for two of the mutants suggests that the observed partial activity is a result of incomplete copper loading. These results show that individualN-glycans play distinct roles in the tyrosinase folding kinetics, suggesting a local folding mechanism for this glycoprotein.

Nucleotide sequences of all constructs were confirmed by the dye terminator double-stranded DNA sequencing method. For transfection, 75-cm2 culture flasks of CHO cells in logarithmic phase growth were used to transiently express different variants of tyrosinase N-glycosylation mutants, usingTransIT TMLT transfection kit (PanVera Corporation), according to the manufacturer's instructions. In all experiments, controls were included in which the cells were transfected with the expression plasmid lacking the fragment coding for tyrosinase. For metabolic labeling, 48 h post-transfection, CHO cells were starved in the cysteine/methionine-free medium for 1 h, pulse labeled with 100–150 μCi of [ 35S]cysteine/methionine (Tran35S-label, 1100 Ci/mmol, ICN Flow, Thame Oxfordshire, UK), for 30 min and chased for the indicating time. When the effect of α-glucosidases I and II inhibition was followed, NB-DNJ was added to the cells either 1 h before or immediately after the pulse labeling and was maintained through out the chase period. Labeled cells were harvested, washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated in 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide for 1 h to block the free sulfhydryl groups, by alkylation. Cells were then lysed with lysis buffer (2% CHAPS in 50 mm Hepes, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Sigma)), for 1 h, on ice. After lysis as described above, cell extracts were first precleared by incubation with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 1 h, at 4 °C. Proteins were then immunoprecipitated in supernatants with either α PEP 7 anti-tyrosinase antibodies (20.Jimenez M. Tsukamoto K. Hearing V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Aroca P. Urabe K. Kobayashi T. Tsukamoto K. Hearing V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25650-25655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or anti-calnexin antibodies followed by anti-tyrosinase antibodies. The bound proteins were eluted with either 1% SDS for 30 min, at room temperature (nonreducing conditions, under which activity is retained) or by boiling in reducing buffer with 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, for 5 min (reducing conditions). The eluted proteins were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. The DOPA-oxidase assay measuring the second catalytic activity of tyrosinase, the conversion of DOPA to DOPAchrome was performed as described before (22.Winder A. Kobayashi T. Tsukamoto K. Urabe K. Aroca P. Kameyama K. Hearing V.J. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 613-626PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 48 h after transfection with different mutant tyrosinase cDNAs, CHO cells grown in 75-cm2 culture flasks were harvested and lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer. 50 μl of cell extracts were mixed with 950 μl of 1 mm DOPA in 0.1m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, for 30 min at 37 °C. The appearance of DOPAchrome was measured spectrophotometrically at 475 nm. The specific activity of different tyrosinaseN-glycosylation mutants was defined as the enzyme activity/mg of total protein. Protein concentration in the cell lysates was determined using the BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce). The remaining 50 μl of each cell extract was boiled for 5 min in reducing sample buffer and loaded on 7.5% acrylamide gels. Electrophoretically separated proteins were transferred to Immobilon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Blots were incubated with 1:100 dilutions of rabbit anti-tyrosinase antibodies (αPEP 7), for 1 h, at 37 °C. Immunoreactivity of proteins was detected by enhanced chemiluminescent Western blotting (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples for copper analysis were prepared by 7.5% SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. The bands of interest were identified by DOPA oxidase activity, excised from the gel, and resolubilized in phosphate-buffered saline. The presence of tyrosinase was confirmed by Western blotting. The proteins were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline followed by exhaustive dialysis against water to remove chloride ions (which interfere with the analysis of sulfur). The samples were concentrated by ultrafiltration using a 30-kDa cut-off membrane to a final concentration of 1 μg of protein in 100 μl. Three or four 0.5-μl drops of each sample were spotted on to 2-μm-thick mylar film sample holders and allowed to dry by evaporation overnight. Direct inspection showed that the majority of the protein was concentrated on the circumference of the drop but not uniformly distributed. The elemental composition of each sample was measured by proton induced x-ray emission spectroscopy using a scanning proton microprobe (23.Garman E.F. Struct. Fold Des. 1999; 7: 291-299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, this involves irradiating the sample with a proton beam of 1-μm diameter and monitoring the emitted x-rays. Each element that is irradiated by the beam gives a distinctive x-ray peak that can be identified and integrated with an accuracy of ± 5%. The beam can be scanned across the sample to produce a spatial map of elemental distribution or focused at a single point to obtain accurate spectra. The procedure used here was initially to generate a map of sulfur distribution. The only source of sulfur present in the sample comes from methionine and cysteine side chains and residual SDS, and so this gives a map of the protein distribution. Three or four points on each sample that gave a high sulfur peak were then selected to obtain point spectra. The copper content at each point was measured and standardized to the amount of protein present at that point by taking the ratio of copper to sulfur (23.Garman E.F. Struct. Fold Des. 1999; 7: 291-299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We have previously investigated the folding and maturation of tyrosinase in the melanotic B16 melanoma cell line (8.Branza-Nichita N. Petrescu A.J. Dwek R.A. Wormald M.R. Platt F.M. Petrescu S.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 720-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). CHO cells do not normally synthesize tyrosinase and do not contain melanosomes. Transfection of CHO cells with the expression vector pHDmcTyr1 containing the full-length mouse tyrosinase cDNA (2.Muller G. Ruppert S. Schmid E. Schutz G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2723-2730Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) resulted in the production of fully active enzyme. Tyrosinase biosynthesis was monitored in vivo by pulse-chase analysis, followed by immunoprecipitation of labeled cell lysates with anti-tyrosinase antibodies (αPEP7) and analysis by nonreducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 A). A slower migrating (upper) band is observed immediately after 30 min of pulse, which disappears within about 3 h. A faster migrating (lower) band appears approximately 2 h post pulse labeling and is still present up to 7 h of chase. On reducing gels, tyrosinase runs as a single 72-kDa band for all pulse-chase times examined (Fig. 2 B), confirming that the two species resolved in nonreducing gels are two folding intermediates. Because tyrosinase synthesized in melanoma cells associates with the chaperone calnexin all along its folding pathway (8.Branza-Nichita N. Petrescu A.J. Dwek R.A. Wormald M.R. Platt F.M. Petrescu S.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 720-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), we analyzed whether this association occurs in CHO cells transfected with tyrosinase cDNA. Interactions between tyrosinase and calnexin were probed using double immunoprecipitation with anti-calnexin followed by anti-tyrosinase antibodies and analysis of the bound proteins by nonreducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 C). The resulting gel is almost identical to that in Fig. 2 A except that the lower band disappears 3 h post-pulse. Under reducing conditions, calnexin bound tyrosinase runs as a single band at 72 kDa (Fig. 2 D). Tyrosinase could not be precipitated by anti-calnexin antibodies in the presence of NB-DNJ (data not shown), demonstrating the requirement of calnexin for monoglucosylated glycans. All these results are similar to those obtained previously (8.Branza-Nichita N. Petrescu A.J. Dwek R.A. Wormald M.R. Platt F.M. Petrescu S.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 720-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) in melanoma cells (B16 cell line). Thus, CHO cells are capable of producing active tyrosinase with maturation kinetics and calnexin binding properties similar to those of melanocytes. Tyrosinase recombinants lacking singleN-glycosylation sites were used to determine the occupancy of the six putative N-glycosylation sites. CHO cell lysates expressing the above mutants were subjected to electrophoresis under reducing conditions followed by Western blotting and tyrosinase immunodetection. Four of the six mutants, Δ(1), Δ(4), Δ(5), and Δ(6), showed faster migration than the wild type (Fig.3 A; see Table II for explanation of notation). Δ(2) and Δ(3) showed similar migration to the wild type (Fig. 3 A). Thus sites 1, 4, 5, and 6 at Asn residues 86, 230, 337, and 371 are fully occupied, whereas sites 2 and 3 at Asn residues 111 and 161 are unoccupied. Tyrosinase mutants lacking one, two, three, or four of the normally occupied N-glycosylation sites were constructed, and their expression in CHO cells were analyzed by Western blotting. Migration patterns of these mutants were consistent with the molecular weight of the mutants lacking one to all of the four glycans. The mutant Δ(1,4,5,6) has a similar migration to that of the wild type protein digested with PNGase F, confirming the absence of any N-linked oligosaccharides (Fig.3 B). Folding of these mutants was analyzed by single and double immunoprecipitation with anti-tyrosinase and anti-calnexin antibodies (summarized in Table II). All 15 mutants gave two bands on nonreducing SDS-PAGE after immunoprecipitation with anti-tyrosinase antibodies (typical data given in Fig. 4, A, C, and E). Δ(4), Δ(5), and Δ(4,5) show behavior similar to that of the wild type protein (Fig. 4 C). All the mutants lacking site 1 had 5–10% of the upper band remaining up to 7 h post-pulse (for example, Fig. 4, A and E). The remaining mutants all show intermediate behavior with the upper band disappearing and the lower band appearing between 0 min and 1 h (Table II). The mutants lacking three or four normally occupiedN-glycosylation sites cannot be co-immunoprecipitated by anti-calnexin antibodies. All the remaining mutants can be precipitated by anti-calnexin antibodies (typical data given in Fig. 4,B, D, and F). Again, Δ(4), Δ(5), and Δ(4,5) show behavior similar to that of the wild type protein (Fig. 4 D). The other mutants also show two bands, but the lower band disappears between 30 min and 2 h post-pulse (Fig. 4,B and F, and Table II). The mutants lacking three or four normally occupied N-glycosylation sites (Δ(1,4,5,6) shown in Fig.5 A) show behavior similar to that of the wild type protein in the presence of NB-DNJ (Fig. 5 B). We have previously shown in B16 cells that wild type tyrosinase binds irreversibly to calnexin in the absence of α-glucosidase II activity (by post-pulse inhibition using NB-DNJ), leading to premature degradation (8.Branza-Nichita N. Petrescu A.J. Dwek R.A. Wormald M.R. Platt F.M. Petrescu S.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 720-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We have repeated this experiment on the Δ(1,6) and Δ(4,5) mutants, both of which show identical behavior to the wild type protein (data not shown), demonstrating that both mutants bind irreversibly to calnexin in the absence of α-glucosidase II activity. The enzymatic activity of wild type or mutant tyrosinase synthesized in CHO cells was determined by measuring their DOPA oxidase activity (Table II). Δ(4), Δ(5), and Δ(4,5) show activity similar to the wild type. Significantly lower activities were measured for the single mutants Δ(1) and Δ(6), i.e. 70 and 64%, respectively, from the wild type activity. In contrast to the high activity of the double mutant Δ(4,5), the mutant Δ(1,6) retains only 30% of the wild type activity. All the mutants lacking three or four normally occupied N-glycosylation sites show no activity. The remaining mutants show intermediate activity, ranging from 30 to 70%. Samples for copper analysis of wild type tyrosinase and the mutants Δ(4,5) and Δ(1,6) were prepared by SDS-PAGE. The bands with DOPA oxidase activity were excised and dialyzed. All three samples contained approximately the same concentration of protein as determined by DOPA oxidase activity, allowing for the lower activity of Δ(1,6). This method produces samples contaminated with other proteins but was the only method of obtaining sufficient quantities for elemental analysis. However, the contaminants are normally synthesized CHO cell proteins and thus lack DOPA oxidase activity and are the same in every sample. The copper content was measured by proton induced x-ray emission spectroscopy using a scanning proton microprobe. Each measurement is accurate to ±5%, but inhomogeneities in samples dried by evaporation lead to a greater variation in measurements taken at different points on the sample. Thus three or four measurements were taken for each sample and the copper content is reported as the ratio of copper to sulfur (see “Materials and Methods”). The four measurements for the wild type sample gave copper:sulfur values of 1:79, 1:58, and 1:48 and one reading below the detection limit. For the last point, the sulfur content was also low, indicating a low level of total protein at that point. The average copper:sulfur ratio from the first three values was 1:62. The four measurements for the Δ(4,5) mutant gave copper:sulfur values of 1:74, 1:42, 1:53, and 1:50, giving an average of 1:55. The three measurements for the Δ(1,6) mutant were below the detection limit for copper. Each of these measurements gave a relatively high sulfur value and the detection limit was calculated as 1:185, 1:232, and 1:264. Thus, the Δ(1,6) mutant contains at least three times less copper relative to total protein than the wild type and Δ(4,5) mutant. This is consistent with the ∼100% activity for the wild type and Δ(4,5) mutant compared with the ∼30% activity for the Δ(1,6) mutant. Tyrosinase is a type I membrane glycoprotein localized in the membrane of melanosomes, comprising 533 amino acids, six potential glycosylation sites, 17 cysteine residues grouped in two cysteine-rich domains, and two copper binding domains (2.Muller G. Ruppert S. Schmid E. Schutz G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2723-2730Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). To address the role of individual N-glycans in tyrosinase folding, knowledge of the occupancy of the sites is required. Expression in CHO cells of tyrosinase mutants lacking single N-glycosylation sites shows that sites 1, 4, 5, and 6 (at Asn residues 86, 230, 337, and 371) are fully occupied, whereas sites 2 and 3 (at Asn residues 111 and 161) are unoccupied. Although the exact locations have not been identified, four asparagine-linked oligosaccharides chains/molecule have been found on hamster tyrosinase (16.Ohkura T. Yamashita K. Mishima Y. Kobata A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 235: 63-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and both hamster (16.Ohkura T. Yamashita K. Mishima Y. Kobata A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 235: 63-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and mouse (17.Negroiu, G., Branza-Nichita, N., Petrescu, A.-J., Dwek, R. A., and Petrescu, S. M. (1999) Biochem. J., in pressGoogle Scholar) tyrosinase show a similar range of oligomannosidic and sialilated complex antennary structures. These data, together with the observation that mouse and human tyrosinase have 85% sequence identity and identical potential N-glycosylation sites, indicate an interesting and possibly functionally relevant conservation ofN-glycosylation between tyrosinases from different mammalian species. It remains unclear as to why the two unoccupied potentialN-glycosylation sites are also conserved. Wild type tyrosinase expressed in CHO cells shows very similar kinetics of folding and interaction with calnexin to the enzyme synthesized in B16 cells (8.Branza-Nichita N. Petrescu A.J. Dwek R.A. Wormald M.R. Platt F.M. Petrescu S.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 720-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Calreticulin has also been shown to interact with tyrosinase but only in the first 30 min after synthesis. 2S. M. Petrescu, N. Branza-Nichita, G. Negroiu, A. J. Petrescu, E. F. Garman, F. M. Platt, M. R. Wormald, and R. A. Dwek, personal communication. In both B16 and CHO cells, two inactive calnexin-bound folding intermediates of tyrosinase can be observed, resolved on nonreducing SDS-PAGE but not on reducing gels. Treatment with NB-DNJ results in inactive enzyme in both cell lines. These data suggest that the folding machinery used by tyrosinase is common to both melanoma and CHO cells and that CHO cells are a suitable model system to use to study the effects of glycosylation mutants on the folding of tyrosinase. Tyrosinase mutants with less than two occupiedN-glycosylation sites expressed in CHO cells cannot be co-immunoprecipitated with anti-calnexin, whereas all other mutants can. This implies that the interaction between tyrosinase and calnexin is multivalent in vivo. Similar results have been obtainedin vitro for ribonuclease (10.Rodan A.R. Simons J.F. Trombetta E.S. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6921-6930Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and influenza hemagglutinin (18.Hebert D.N. Zhang J.X. Chen W. Foellmer B. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 613-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). We cannot rule out the possibility that complexes involving monoglycosylated proteins are formed, the interaction being too weak to be observed by co-immunoprecipitation. However, tyrosinase mutants with only one occupied site have no enzymatic activity and show the same folding kinetics as wild type tyrosinase expressed in the presence ofNB-DNJ. Thus any interactions between monoglycosylated tyrosinase and calnexin have no effect on protein folding. The tyrosinase mutant with sites 1 and 6 occupied, Δ(4,5), shows the same kinetics of interaction with calnexin and final activity as the wild type enzyme. This implies that calnexin is either divalent or is acting as a dimer during its interaction with tyrosinase, glycans at sites 1 and 6 being sufficient to reproduce the wild type behavior. Tyrosinase mutants with three occupied glycosylation sites behave equivalently to the corresponding double mutant carrying the pair that gives the longest interaction time with calnexin. For example, the mutant with sites 1, 4, and 5 occupied (Δ(6)) shows the same kinetics of folding and enzymatic activity as the double mutant with sites 1 and 5 occupied (Δ(4,6)). This confirms the concept that the interaction between tyrosinase and calnexin is divalent. The location of N-glycans dramatically affects both folding kinetics and final enzymatic activity of the mutants. For instance the mutant Δ(4,5) has wild type activity, whereas Δ(1,6) is only 30% active. Copper analysis of the wild type protein, the Δ(4,5) mutant and the Δ(1,6) mutant shows that the copper content is significantly lower in the Δ(1,6) mutant. Because the presence of copper is critical to enzymatic activity, the Δ(1,6) mutant must contain a high proportion of completely inactive protein, explaining its overall 30% level of activity. A wide range of activities from 0 to 100% is seen for the whole range of N-glycosylation mutants. The simplest explanation of these results is that the expressed protein from each mutant consists of a mixture of active and inactive protein, the latter lacking copper. The observed percentage of activity represents the percentage of fully active protein present and thus the efficiency of folding of that mutant in vivo. The presence of any two occupied glycosylation sites is sufficient to produce some fully active protein, but the efficiency of folding depends on which sites are occupied, and wild type folding efficiency is only obtained with sites 1 and 6 occupied. This difference in folding efficiency cannot be due to the difference in affinity of the glycosylation mutants for calnexin, because both the Δ(1,6) and Δ(4,5) mutants bind irreversibly to calnexin in the absence of α-glucosidase II activity. It has previously been reported that some of the N-linked oligosaccharides ofSchizosaccharomyces pombe double mutant Gls2/alg6 are not recognized by GT under denaturing conditions (19.Fernandez F. D'Alessio C. Fanchiotti S. Parodi A.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5877-5886Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It is possible that although the glycans at all the occupied N-glycosylation sites of tyrosinase can interact with calnexin, some of the glycans are not accessible to GT. Alternatively, the regions of the protein local to some of the glycan sites may fold rapidly and correctly with limited chaperone assistance and so may not be recognized by GT. The presence of glycans in regions of the protein structure that spontaneously fold less efficiently may be necessary for the correct function of the GT quality control system and hence may explain the conservation of glycosylation sites in tyrosinase. It is interesting to note that there is a linear relationship that holds for the wild type and all the N-glycosylation mutants between the interaction time with calnexin and the enzymatic activity of the mature protein. Accelerated folding of tyrosinase mutants is accompanied by a lower enzymatic activity of the mature protein (Fig.6). The in vivo acquisition of activity of tyrosinase appears to be zero-order with respect to tyrosinase, suggesting that one or more additional components are rate-limiting, for example other chaperones assisting tyrosinase during calnexin-mediated folding or the acquisition of copper at a later stage. We have found recently that Erp57 interacts with tyrosinase (data not shown). Other chaperones are currently being investigated to understand the whole picture of tyrosinase folding in the endoplasmic reticulum. 3A. Hillebrand, personal communication. Removal of glycans has been shown in vitro to result in the accelerated folding of influenza hemagglutinin monomers but not to impair final function (18.Hebert D.N. Zhang J.X. Chen W. Foellmer B. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 613-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The data here indicate that for tyrosinase only a subpopulation (indistinguishable on the basis of its electrophoretic mobility) is able to reach the active conformation, and this increases with the time spent by the glycoprotein in the calnexin cycle. In conclusion, the efficiency of in vivo folding of tyrosinase is dependent on the occupancy of its N-glycan sites. In the absence of interaction with calnexin, no activity is obtained. Recruitment into the calnexin chaperone system occurs for any form of the enzyme that has two occupied N-glycan sites, leading to the production of some fully active molecules. Specific glycans are required for efficient operation of this pathway, leading to maximum activity. We propose that the quality control system operates locally with individual N-glycans having distinctive roles. Mutations at glycosylation sites critical to the operation of the quality control mechanism lead to a reduction in the activity of the expressed protein. It is interesting to note that the removal of site six has the most significant effect on the activity of the expressed enzyme, and this is the site at which mutations have been implicated in oculocutaneous albinism.

Agonists that can also activate platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa are able to activate integrin α2β1, but those operating via glycoprotein Ib cannot. Activation of α2β1 induced by low thrombin or collagen-related peptide concentrations was almost completely inhibited by apyrase, and the inhibitors wortmannin, 4-amino-5-(chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine, bisindolylmaleimide I, and SQ29548 significantly inhibited it. Activation induced by high thrombin or collagen-related peptide concentrations was far less sensitive to these inhibitors. However, only wortmannin markedly inhibited ADP-induced integrin α2β1 activation, and this was not ADP concentration-dependent. These results suggest that at the low agonist concentrations, the released ADP would be a primary inducer of integrin α2β1 activation, while at the high agonist concentrations, there would be several pathways through which integrin α2β1 activation can be induced. Kinetic analyses revealed that ADP-induced platelets had about the same number of binding sites (B max) as thrombin-induced platelets, but their affinity (K d) for soluble collagen was 3.7–12.7-fold lower, suggesting that activated integrin α2β1 induced by ADP is different from that induced by thrombin. The data are consistent with an activation mechanism involving released ADP and in which there exists two different states of activated integrin α2β1; these activated forms of integrin α2β1 would have different conformations that determine their ligand affinity.

In humans, at least 15 different α-subunits and eight different β-subunits have been identified to date. The various permutations of the α- and β-subunit complexes yield integrin dimers with diverse ligand specificities and biological activities. There is tissue-specific expression of each type of integrin; some integrins are only expressed in a certain tissue, while others are more universal.Integrin αIIbβ3 (platelet glycoprotein (GP)1 IIb/IIIa) is only expressed in platelets and megakaryocytes, but integrin α2β1 (platelet GP Ia/IIa) is known to be present in many cell types (1.Zutter M.M. Santoro S.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 137: 113-120PubMed Google Scholar). The GP IIb/IIIa complex is present as a nonactive heterodimer in resting platelets and becomes activated when platelets are induced by agonists (2.Marguerie G.A. Plow E.F. Edgington T.S. J. Biol.

Elsevier, Amsterdam1987: 95-125Google Scholar); activated GP IIb/IIIa possesses high affinity for its ligand, fibrinogen. GP IIb/IIIa is one of the most abundant proteins in the platelet membrane, and its binding reaction with fibrinogen was shown to be one of the most important reactions in platelet aggregation. On the other hand, although integrin α2β1 was indicated to be a receptor for collagen from studies on a patient's platelets lacking this protein (5.Nieuwenhuis H.K. Akkerman J.W.N. Houdijk W.P.M. Sixma J.J. Nature. 1985; 318: 470-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), neither soluble ligand binding to integrin α2β1 nor the activation of the integrin had not been clearly demonstrated until recently. In our previous paper, we showed that upon agonist stimulation of platelets, integrin α2β1 is activated to a form with high affinity for soluble collagen (6.Jung S.M. Moroi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14827-14837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These results suggested that integrin α2β1 might be converted to its activated form through a mechanism similar to that responsible for the activation of GP IIb/IIIa.The activation mechanism of GP IIb/IIIa has been examined by many investigators, but is yet not fully explained. Recombinant proteins having various mutational changes in the cytoplasmic domains of GP IIb, GP IIIa, or both, with different conformational states of the extracellular portion of the integrin (7.O'Toole T.E.

These results suggested that transformation of the extracellular domain to a conformation with high affinity for fibrinogen would be regulated by interactions involving the cytoplasmic domain(s) of GP IIb/IIIa (10.Shattil S.J.

However, none of these proteins was indicated to function as a regulator of GP IIb/IIIa activity in platelets. As to the β1-integrins, the cytoplasmic domain of the α2-chain has been indicated to act as a negative regulator (16.Kawaguchi S. Bergelson J.M. Finberg R.W. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 977-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and the NPXY motif of the β-cytoplasmic domain was indicated to be critical for inside-out signaling (8.O'Toole T.E. Ylanne J. Culley B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8553-8558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Furthermore, several proteins were reported to interact with the cytoplasmic domains of integrin α2β1 and suggested to regulate its function; these are calreticulin (17.Coppolino M. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Dedhar S. Wilkins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23132-23138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), integrin-linked kinase 1 (18.Hannigan G.E.

Smith H. Liu J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1149-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) in addition to cytoskeletal proteins. The contributions of these factors to platelet function remain to be analyzed.Phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of GP IIb/IIIa was also suggested to control the affinity of the integrin (20.van Willigen G. Hers I. Gorter G. Akkerman J.-W.N. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), but other studies suggested that the phosphorylation of GP IIb/IIIa is related to the interaction with the cytoskeleton; i.e. outside-in signaling (21.Lerea K.M.

The activated GP IIb/IIIa binds with fibrinogen, and this interaction also stimulates platelets (outside-in signaling), which severely complicates the analyses of the activation mechanism of GP IIb/IIIa. However, this is not the case for integrin α2β1, where collagen is not secreted from platelets after they are activated; thus, this allows us to neglect the effect of outside-in signaling, making it particularly amenable to the analysis of the integrin activation mechanism.Our previous study demonstrated that platelet integrin α2β1 is activated to a form with high affinity for soluble collagen after platelets are stimulated by various agonists (6.Jung S.M. Moroi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14827-14837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Although many cells were observed to increase their adhesive activity to the integrin ligands after cell activation with stimuli (23.Shimizu Y. van Seventer G.A. Hogan K.J. Shaw S. Nature. 1990; 345: 250-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 24.Chan B.M. Wong J.G. Rao A. Hemler M.E. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 398-404PubMed Google Scholar), the activation of integrins, especially of β1-integrins, was ascribed to avidity changes, since there had not been any clear evidence for the affinity change of β1-integrins using soluble ligand binding (25.Bazzoni G. Hemler M.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 30-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Our demonstration of the activation of integrin α2β1 associated with affinity change suggested the existence of an activation mechanism that would induce a conformational change in the integrin. A similar activation mechanism was indicated for integrin GP IIb/IIIa (integrin αIIbβ3) of platelets, and many investigations have been performed to describe this activation mechanism, designated as inside-out signaling (4.Marguerie G.A. Ginsberg M.H. Plow E.F. MacIntyre D.E. Gordon J.L. Platelets in Biology and Pathology III. Elsevier, Amsterdam1987: 95-125Google Scholar, 26.Shattil S.J. Kashiwagi H. Pampori N. Blood. 1998; 91: 2645-2657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In this paper, we analyzed the effects of various inhibitors and agonists on the activation of integrin α2β1. The results indicated the following. 1) All of the agonists that induce GP IIb/IIIa-dependent platelet aggregation induced integrin α2β1activation. 2) An ADP scavenger, apyrase, almost completely inhibited integrin α2β1 when platelets were stimulated with a low concentration of an agonist (thrombin or collagen-related peptide (CRP)); and other inhibitors, wortmannin, PP2, bisindolylmaleimide I (BIMI), and SQ29548, inhibited the activation significantly under this condition. 3) When platelets were stimulated with higher concentrations of agonists, these inhibitors had no significant effect, except for the case of wortmannin, which had an inhibitory effect on ADP-induced activation. 4) Integrin α2β1 activated with ADP and integrin α2β1 activated by a high concentration of thrombin showed different K d values but had the same number of binding sites per platelet. These results suggest that released ADP participates in the activation of integrin α2β1 and suggest the presence of two different states of activated integrin α2β1that have different conformations. Integrins comprise a family of heterodimeric cell surface proteins that mediate intracellular and cell-to-extracellular interactions. In humans, at least 15 different α-subunits and eight different β-subunits have been identified to date. The various permutations of the α- and β-subunit complexes yield integrin dimers with diverse ligand specificities and biological activities. There is tissue-specific expression of each type of integrin; some integrins are only expressed in a certain tissue, while others are more universal. Integrin αIIbβ3 (platelet glycoprotein (GP)1 IIb/IIIa) is only expressed in platelets and megakaryocytes, but integrin α2β1 (platelet GP Ia/IIa) is known to be present in many cell types (1.Zutter M.M. Santoro S.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 137: 113-120PubMed Google Scholar). The GP IIb/IIIa complex is present as a nonactive heterodimer in resting platelets and becomes activated when platelets are induced by agonists (2.Marguerie G.A. Plow E.F. Edgington T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 5357-5363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Mustard J.F. Packham M.A. Kinlough-Rathbone R.L. Perry D.W. Regoeczi E.

Elsevier, Amsterdam1987: 95-125Google Scholar); activated GP IIb/IIIa possesses high affinity for its ligand, fibrinogen. GP IIb/IIIa is one of the most abundant proteins in the platelet membrane, and its binding reaction with fibrinogen was shown to be one of the most important reactions in platelet aggregation. On the other hand, although integrin α2β1 was indicated to be a receptor for collagen from studies on a patient's platelets lacking this protein (5.Nieuwenhuis H.K. Akkerman J.W.N. Houdijk W.P.M. Sixma J.J. Nature. 1985; 318: 470-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), neither soluble ligand binding to integrin α2β1 nor the activation of the integrin had not been clearly demonstrated until recently. In our previous paper, we showed that upon agonist stimulation of platelets, integrin α2β1 is activated to a form with high affinity for soluble collagen (6.Jung S.M. Moroi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14827-14837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These results suggested that integrin α2β1 might be converted to its activated form through a mechanism similar to that responsible for the activation of GP IIb/IIIa. The activation mechanism of GP IIb/IIIa has been examined by many investigators, but is yet not fully explained. Recombinant proteins having various mutational changes in the cytoplasmic domains of GP IIb, GP IIIa, or both, with different conformational states of the extracellular portion of the integrin (7.O'Toole T.E.

These results suggested that transformation of the extracellular domain to a conformation with high affinity for fibrinogen would be regulated by interactions involving the cytoplasmic domain(s) of GP IIb/IIIa (10.Shattil S.J.

https://openalex.org/W2328908679,"CDC25 dual-specificity phosphatases are essential regulators that activate cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) at critical stages of the cell cycle. In human cells, CDC25A and C are involved in the control of G1/S and G2/M respectively, whereas CDC25B is proposed to act both in S phase and G2/M. Evidence for an interaction between CDC25 phosphatases and members of the 14-3-3 protein family has been obtained in vitro and in vivo in several organisms. On the basis of the work performed with CDC25C, it has been proposed that phosphorylation is required to mediate the interaction with 14-3-3. Here we have examined the molecular basis of the interaction between CDC25B phosphatases and 14-3-3 proteins. We show that in the two-hybrid assay all three splice variants of CDC25B interact similarly and strongly with 14-3-3eta, beta and zeta proteins, but poorly with epsilon and Theta. In vitro, CDC25B interacts at a low level with 14-3-3beta, epsilon, zeta, eta, and Theta isoforms. This interaction is not increased upon phosphorylation of CDC25B by CHK1 and is not abolished by dephosphorylation. In contrast, a specific, strong interaction between CDC25B and 14-3-3zeta and eta isoforms is revealed by a deletion of 288 residues in the amino-terminal region of CDC25B. This interaction requires the integrity of Ser 323, although it is independent of phosphorylation. Thus, interaction between 14-3-3 proteins and CDC25B is regulated in a manner that is different from that with CDC25C. We propose that, in addition to a low affinity binding site that is available for all 14-3-3 isoforms, post-translational modification of CDC25B in vivo exposes a high-affinity binding site that is specific for the zeta and eta14-3-3 isoforms."
https://openalex.org/W2054165881,"A 58-residue-long, PEST-like sequence within the yeast a-factor receptor (Ste3p) specifies the ubiquitination, endocytosis, and consequent vacuolar degradation of the receptor protein (Roth, A. F., Sullivan, D. M., and Davis, N. G. (1998) J. Cell Biol. 142, 949–961). The present work investigates three lysyl residues that map within this sequence as the potential ubiquitin acceptor sites. Lys → Arg substitution mutants were tested for effects on both ubiquitination and endocytosis. Results indicate that the three lysines function redundantly; a severe blockade to both ubiquitination and endocytosis is seen only for receptors having all three lysines replaced. Of the three, Lys432plays the predominant role; ubiquitination and turnover are significantly impaired for receptors having just the K432R mutation. CNBr fragmentation of the receptor protein, used for the physical mapping of the ubiquitin attachment sites, showed PEST-like sequence lysines to be modified both with single ubiquitin moieties as well with short multi-ubiquitin chains, two or three ubiquitins long. Thus, in addition to being the signal for ubiquitination, the Ste3p PEST-like sequence also provides the site for ubiquitin attachment. To test if this endocytosis signal functions solely for ubiquitination, we have asked if the requirement for the PEST-like sequence in endocytosis might be bypassed through pre-attachment of ubiquitin to the receptor protein. Indeed, Ste3-ubiquitin translational fusions that have a ubiquitin moiety fused to the receptor in place of the PEST-like signal do undergo rapid endocytosis and vacuolar turnover. We conclude that ubiquitin alone, with no required contribution from receptor sequences, provides the sufficient signal for initiating uptake. In addition, our results confirm conclusions originally drawn from studies with the α-factor receptor (Terrell, J., Shih, S., Dunn, R., and Hicke, L. (1998) Mol. Cell 1, 193–202), namely that mono-ubiquitin, and not multi-ubiquitin chains provide the primary recognition determinant for uptake. Although mono-ubiquitination suffices, our results indicate that multi-ubiquitination serves to augment the rate of uptake. A 58-residue-long, PEST-like sequence within the yeast a-factor receptor (Ste3p) specifies the ubiquitination, endocytosis, and consequent vacuolar degradation of the receptor protein (Roth, A.

Although mono-ubiquitination suffices, our results indicate that multi-ubiquitination serves to augment the rate of uptake. cytoplasmic tail domain ubiquitin polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis The mechanisms that select plasma membrane substrates for clathrin-mediated endocytosis in mammalian cells are reasonably well understood (3.Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar, 4.Schmid S.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 511-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Substrates subject to constitutive uptake display short peptidyl endocytosis signals centered around either an aromatic residue, usually a tyrosine, or a Leu-Leu dipeptide (5.Heilker R. Spiess M. Crottet P. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 558-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). These signals are decoded through the binding of the AP-2 adaptin complex which then serves to coordinate the assembly of the clathrin coat protein complex, thereby initiating the invagination of a patch of the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm. A variation on this theme has recently been described for the agonist-dependent uptake of the β2-adrenergic receptor (6.Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar). In this case, the adaptin role in clathrin-coated pit assembly is replaced by the binding of β-arrestin to the phosphorylated cytoplasmic tail domain of the liganded receptor. β-Arrestin also binds strongly to clathrin, thus allowing the assembly of the receptor into the clathrin-coated pit. Endocytosis in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae differs in several regards from the classic clathrin-dependent endocytosis of mammalian cells. While yeast express obvious homologues of the key players for clathrin-mediated uptake, i.e.clathrin heavy and light chains and the adaptin subunits, a clear demonstration of the requirement of these proteins in yeast uptake has remained elusive. Exhaustive deletion of the genes encoding the adaptin subunits is without discernible effect on yeast uptake processes (7.Huang K.M. D'Hondt K. Riezman H. Lemmon S.K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3897-3908Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). For clathrin, while mutations that disable clathrin function show partial endocytosis defects, the interpretation of this partial defect remains uncertain (8.Payne G.S. Baker D. van Tuinen E. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1453-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 9.Tan P.K. Davis N.G. Sprague G.F. Payne G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1707-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Clathrin may either function redundantly as one of several coat proteins functioning in yeast uptake, or alternatively, as these clathrin mutants also severely impair viability, the effect on endocytosis could be indirect. In yeast, it is now clear for a variety of endocytic substrates that the selectivity of uptake depends at least in part on selective ubiquitination (10.Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 19-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 11.Hicke L. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 107-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Plasma membrane proteins destined for uptake are marked with added ubiquitin. Nonetheless, as with the clathrin-mediated uptake, the selectivity of the process ultimately depends upon the recognition of determinants or signals encoded within the endocytic substrate's amino acid sequence. Sequences involved in directing uptake have been identified for several yeast endocytic substrates (1.Roth A.F. Sullivan D.M. Davis N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 12.Rohrer J. Benedetti H. Zanolari B. Riezman H. Mol. Biol.

Biol. 1998; 18: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Given the differences between clathrin- and ubiquitin-dependent uptake processes, it is not surprising that these yeast sequences bear little resemblance to the signals directing the clathrin-mediated endocytosis of mammalian cells. The two yeast pheromone receptors, the α-factor receptor (Ste2p) and thea-factor receptor (Ste3p), both have been well studied in terms of endocytosis. These two G protein-coupled receptors mediate the hormonal cross-talk that precedes the sexual conjugation of theMAT a cell with the MATα cell. The two receptors are subject both to a ligand-dependent internalization mechanism as well as to a ligand-independent (i.e. constitutive) uptake mechanism. For Ste2p, the sequence SINNDAKSS, which maps to the regulatory C-terminal cytoplasmic tail domain (CTD),1 has been shown to be required for α-factor-induced uptake (12.Rohrer J. Benedetti H. Zanolari B. Riezman H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 16.Hicke L. Riezman H. Cell. 1996; 84: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). Mutations in this sequence block both ubiquitination and endocytosis. Indeed, the Lys of this sequence has been suggested to be the major site for ubiquitination as its replacement by Arg blocks both the ubiquitination and internalization of the receptor (16.Hicke L. Riezman H. Cell. 1996; 84: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). The sequence NPFSTD, located within the Ste3p CTD, has been shown to be required for itsa-factor-induced endocytosis (13.Tan P.K. Howard J.P. Payne G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1789-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). While required for uptake, these sequences within Ste2p and Ste3p clearly do not constitute sufficient signals for endocytosis. Additional receptor domains also are required. For instance, ligand-dependent uptake obviously also depends upon the ability of the receptor to bind ligand. Indeed, for Ste2p, in addition to the CTD sequence SINNDAKSS, mutations that map to predicted extracellular domains of the receptor also are found to impair ligand-dependent uptake (17.Dosil M. Giot L. Davis C. Konopka J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5981-5991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One well characterized yeast endocytosis signal is the signal that directs the rapid constitutive, ligand-independent internalization of the a-factor receptor (1.Roth A.F. Sullivan D.M. Davis N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For Ste3p, constitutive endocytosis is the more prominent of the two uptake modes. In the absence of a-factor ligand, Ste3p is rapidly internalized from the cell surface and delivered to the vacuole for degradation (18.Davis N.G. Horecka J.L. Sprague Jr., G.F. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 53-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Ste3p consequently is a short-lived protein with at 1/2 of only 15 min in cells growing at 30 °C. This rapid endocytosis depends upon a 58 residue-long sequence mapping to the C terminus of the receptor CTD (1.Roth A.F. Sullivan D.M. Davis N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Receptor mutants deleted for this sequence fail to undergo both constitutive ubiquitination and endocytosis and instead stably accumulate at the cell surface. Furthermore, this sequence also is a sufficient signal; when transplanted to the cytoplasmically disposed C terminus of the plasma membrane ATPase Pma1p, normally a stable cell surface resident, the Ste3p sequence directs both ubiquitination and rapid internalization of the ATPase to the vacuole for degradation. With its preponderance of both the acidic residues Asp and Glu and hydroxylated residues Ser and Thr, the Ste3p signal most closely resembles a class of ubiquitination signals known as PEST sequences (19.Rechsteiner M. Rogers S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 267-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1405) Google Scholar). Similar sequences rich in acidic and hydroxylated residues have also been implicated in the endocytosis of both the a-factor export protein Ste6p and the uracil permease Fur4p (14.Kolling R. Losko S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2251-2261Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 15.Marchal C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Urban-Grimal D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The present work extends the analysis of the Ste3p PEST-like endocytosis signal, particularly with regards to its role in ubiquitination. First, we ask if, in addition to specifying ubiquitination, the PEST-like sequence also provides the locus for ubiquitin attachment. Lys → Arg replacement mutagenesis of the three lysine residues located within the PEST-like sequence indicates that the three likely function redundantly as the sites for ubiquitin attachment: receptors having these three lysines replaced, fail to be ubiquitinated and fail to be internalized. Direct mapping of the ubiquitination site confirms the PEST-like signal as the primary locus for ubiquitin attachment. In addition, this analysis identifies the presence of short multi-ubiquitin chains attached therein. To test if these multi-ubiquitin chains might be required for directing uptake, we have applied the ubiquitin fusion methodology of Terrell et al. (2.Terrell J. Shih S. Dunn R. Hicke L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 193-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Results with Ste3-ubiquitin fusions confirm results made previously with the Ste2-ubiquitin fusions (2.Terrell J. Shih S. Dunn R. Hicke L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 193-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), namely that recognition of mono-ubiquitin, and not the multi-ubiquitin chain, is key for endocytosis. In addition, the conclusions of Terrell et al.(2.Terrell J. Shih S. Dunn R. Hicke L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 193-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) are also extended with the demonstration that ubiquitin addition to a plasma membrane protein is not only necessary for initiating uptake, but also is sufficient; ubiquitin functions alone to specify uptake, not in conjunction with other receptor sequences or signals. The plasmid pSL1904 serves as the starting point for many of STE3 mutations constructed in this work. pSL1904 is GAL1-STE3 carried on the URA3 integrating plasmid pRS306 (20.Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of chromosomal flanking sequences upstream and downstream of the GAL1-STE3, 1.1 and 2.3 kilobase pairs long, respectively, allow both wild-type and mutantGAL1-STE3 constructs to be introduced back into the yeast chromosome by homologous recombination in place ofste3Δ::LEU2 alleles. pSL1904 is identical to pSL1839 (1.Roth A.F. Sullivan D.M. Davis N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), except in having a 760-base pair GAL1,10promoter fragment substituting for the STE3 promoter (21.Bender A. Sprague Jr., G.F. Cell. 1986; 47: 929-937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), replacing the sequences 417 to 110 base pairs upstream of theSTE3 ORF. The plasmid pND751 is identical to the CUP1-driven, myc-ubiquitin 2μ/URA3 expression plasmid pND747 (1.Roth A.F. Sullivan D.M. Davis N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), except that the Met15 codon of the myc-ubiquitin fusion (corresponding to ubiquitin Met1) has been replaced by a Leu codon. The M15L mutation removes a CNBr cleavage site that would otherwise result in the loss of the identifying myc epitope extension from the tagged ubiquitin. The M15L mutation was introduced by oligonucleotide mutagenesis (Table I) of single-stranded DNA derived from pND153, a BamHI to KpnI subclone of the 0.6-kilobase pair CUP1-myc-Ubi portion of YEp105 (22.Ellison M.J. Hochstrasser M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21150-21157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) into pRS306 (20.Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, pND751 was derived by swapping theBamHI-KpnI fragment carrying the M15L mutation back into pND747.Table IOligonucleotide-directed mutagenesisMutationMutagenic oligonucleotideSingle-stranded DNA templateRestriction siteaEach of the mutations either adds or removes a restriction enzyme digestion site, which was used diagnostically to identify plasmids with the mutations.GAL1-STE3(K424R)CGAGAGTAACTCTCGAGAATCCTCCpSL1904XhoIGAL1-STE3(K432R)GAATTATGAAGCCTTTCTGAATAATCpSL1904RemovesHindIIIGAL1-STE3(K453R)GAATTCTCTTCTCTAGAAGCTGGAGAGpSL1904XbaIGAL1-STE3(K424R,K432R)GAATTATGAAGCCTTTCTGAATAATCpSL1904 with K424RRemoves HindIIIGAL1-STE3(K424R,K453R)GAATTCTCTTCTCTAGAAGCTGGAGAGpSL1904 with K424RXbaIGAL1-STE3(K432R,K453R)GAATTCTCTTCTCTAGAAGCTGGAGAGpSL1904 with K432RXbaIGAL1-STE3(K424R,K432R,K453R)GAATTATGAAGCCTTTCTGAATAATCpSL1904 with K424R and K453RRemoves HindIIIGAL1-STE3(S412T,F413M,K424R,K453R)GATATTTCGTCGTCCATGGTCTGTCCTTGCGpSL1904 with K424R and K453RNcoIGAL1-STE3(G421M,F422L,K424R,K453R)GTAACTCTCGAGAGCATGCCAAGTGATATTTCpSL1904 with K424R and K453RSphIGAL1-STE3(K424R,N440T,F441M,K453R)GACTTTCCCCTTCCATGGTGGAGCTTGCAGpSL1904 with K424R and K453RNcoIGAL1-STE3(K424R,S452M,K453E)GAATTCTCTTCTTCCATGGCTGGAGAGTAGCpSL1904 with K424R and K453RNcoICUP1-myc-Ubi(M15L)GAAGACTTGGGTCTGCAGATCTTCpND153PstIGAL1-STE3(Δ399)-Ub(7K→R,G76A)CTTGGTACCTCAGGCGCCTCTTAGTCpND774HaeIIGAL1-STE3(Δ399)-Ub(7K→R,Δ75–76)GTACCTCAGGCTTATCTTAGTCTTAAGpND774 with G76ARemoves HaeIIa Each of the mutations either adds or removes a restriction enzyme digestion site, which was used diagnostically to identify plasmids with the mutations. Open table in a new tab The ubiquitin sequences were joined to STE3 sequences at one of two XhoI sites previously introduced into STE3, one at codons 398/399 and the other at codons 466/467 (1.Roth A.F. Sullivan D.M. Davis N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The Ste3(Δ399)-Ub class of fusions lacks the 72 C-terminal residues of Ste3p (residues 399–470), including the PEST-like endocytosis signal (residues 413–470). The Ste3(wt)-Ub fusions lack just the C-terminal five amino acid residues. Interpolated between the STE3 and ubiquitin sequences in all fusions is an artificial, 15-residue-long, glycine-rich linker sequence described by Robinson and Sauer (23.Robinson C.R. Sauer R.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and utilized by Terrell et al. (2.Terrell J. Shih S. Dunn R. Hicke L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 193-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) in the construction of the Ste2-Ub fusions. The linker, which encodes the peptide GGGSGGGTGGGSGGG, was constructed through hybridization of two complementary 52-mer oligonucleotides: TCGAGGGAGGTGGAAGTGGAGGCGGAACAGGCGGAGGGTCAGGAGGGGGGCA and GATCTGCCCCCCTCCTGACCCTCCGCCTGTTCCGCCTCCACTTCCACCTCCC. The resulting double-stranded DNA has an XhoI sticky end for fusion with upstream STE3 sequences and a BglII sticky end for ligation to the BglII site located at the second and third codons of the ubiquitin gene from YEp96 (22.Ellison M.J. Hochstrasser M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21150-21157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fusions to the 7K→R ubiquitin used the BglII site of pTER62 (Mike Ellison, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada), a plasmid identical to YEp96, except with AGA arginine codons in place of all seven lysine codons. The Ste3-Ub fusions were ligated into theGAL1-STE3 context of pSL1904 where the upstream and downstream chromosomal flanking sequences allow for the homologous integration of the GAL1-STE3-Ub constructs at theSTE3 locus. The pSL1904-derived plasmids forGAL1-STE3(Δ399)-Ub(wt),GAL1-STE3(Δ399)-Ub(7K→R), GAL1-STE3(wt)-Ub(7K→R), andGAL1-STE3(3K→R)-Ub(7K→R) are pND774, pND885, pND942, and pND901, respectively. In addition, two C-terminal ubiquitin mutations,Δ75,76 and G76A were introduced into theGAL1-STE3(Δ399)-Ub(7K→R) context via oligonucleotide mutagenesis (Table I). A number of site-directed mutations (24.Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar) were introduced both into STE3 and into various ubiquitin constructs (Table I). In addition to the introduced coding change, mutations also were designed to either add or remove restriction enzyme digestion sites, simplifying the identification of the mutant plasmids by restriction analysis (TableI). Fidelity of the mutations was checked by DNA sequencing. Strains were constructed for each of the differentSTE3 mutations and Ste3-Ub fusions characterized in this work, wherein the mutant construct is integrated at the chromosomalSTE3 locus. Constructs were integrated in place of chromosomal ste3Δ::LEU2 allele via a two-step gene replacement strategy (25.Roth A.F. Davis N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 661-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Plasmid constructs linearized at a unique upstream HpaI site (for the Lys → Arg and methionyl substitution mutants) or at a unique upstream SfiI site (for the Ste3-Ub fusions) were introduced by transformation into one of three strains, either the wild-type MATα strain NDY343 (ste3Δ::LEU2 ura3 leu2 his4), or the isogenicend4–1 or pep4Δ versions, NDY344 and NDY372, respectively (1.Roth A.F. Sullivan D.M. Davis N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The resulting Ura+ integrants have the introduced mutant allele in tandem array with theste3Δ::LEU2 allele. As a final step, 5-fluoro-orotic acid counterselection was used as described previously (25.Roth A.F. Davis N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 661-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) to isolate Leu−, mating-competent segregants that had lost via homologous recombination, theste3Δ::LEU2 together with the integrated pRS306 plasmid sequences. Ste3p and Ste3-Ub turnover was assessed via a non-radioactive pulse-chase protocol (18.Davis N.G. Horecka J.L. Sprague Jr., G.F. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 53-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). A 2-h “pulse” of receptor synthesis was induced with the addition of 2% galactose to exponential cultures of cells carrying theGAL1-driven constructs growing in YP-raffinose (2%) medium. Following this, the “chase” period was instigated with the addition of 3% glucose. The time-dependent loss of Ste3 antigen was followed by Western blotting of protein extracts from culture aliquots removed at various times during the glucose chase. For the first time point (taken immediately subsequent to the addition of glucose), culture volumes corresponding to 5 × 107 cells were collected by centrifugation and protein extracts were prepared for SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described previously (18.Davis N.G. Horecka J.L. Sprague Jr., G.F. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 53-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). For subsequent time points, the same culture volume collected for the initial time point was again harvested. Although this translates into increased number of cells being collected at later time points, the amount of Ste3 antigen present in this aliquot should remain the same for conditions in which Ste3p is not turning over and should diminish appropriately under conditions in which Ste3p turns over. The affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies used for detecting Ste3p were prepared as described (1.Roth A.F. Sullivan D.M. Davis N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The analysis of Ste3-Ub protein turnover in some instances utilized a protocol in which cells were treated with energy poisons prior to the preparation of extracts. The conditions and the buffers utilized are identical to those used in the protease-shaving protocol, except that no protease is added. Visualization of the ubiquitinated forms of the receptors was enhanced with treatment of the protein extracts with potato acid phosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) prior to analysis by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (25.Roth A.F. Davis N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 661-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The treatment of whole cells with Pronase (Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp., La Jolla, CA) and the subsequent extract preparation was as described previously (18.Davis N.G. Horecka J.L. Sprague Jr., G.F. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 53-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). To assess the maintenance of cell integrity during the course of the protease treatments, extracts were routinely monitored for the resistance of the cytoplasmic protein, phosphoglycerate kinase (Pgk1p) to digestion. For the a-factor treatment of the cell cultures used for following ligand-dependent endocytosis, a 50% volume of a cell-free filtrate from a saturated culture of EG123 cells (26.Siliciano P.G. Tatchell K. Cell. 1984; 37: 969-978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) transformed with the the a-factor overproduction plasmid pKK16 (27.Kuchler K. Sterne R.E. Thorner J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3973-3984Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) was added. Mock pheromone treatments involved the addition of an equivalent filtrate from the isogenic mfa1::LEU2 mfa2::URA3 strain (18.Davis N.G. Horecka J.L. Sprague Jr., G.F. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 53-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Protein extracts for CNBr digestion differed in two ways from those utilized for Western analysis (18.Davis N.G. Horecka J.L. Sprague Jr., G.F. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 53-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar); extracts were prepared from 1.5 × 108 cells instead of 5 × 107, and urea was omitted from the SDS-PAGE sample buffer (40 mm Tris/Cl, pH 6.8, 5% SDS, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1% β-mercaptoethanol) used in the glass bead disruption of the cells. Twenty microliters of protein extract in a 200-μl reaction volume was incubated for 1 h in the dark at 25 °C in 2.5 m CNBr, 70% formic acid. One milliliter of 13% trichloroacetic acid was added, and, following 1 h at 0 °C, the precipitated protein was pelleted with a 15-min microcentrifuge spin at 4 °C. The pellet was washed once with acetone, desiccated, dissolved at 65 °C for 5 min with 20 μl of 40 mm Tris/Cl, pH 6.8, 8 m urea, 0.5% SDS, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1% β-mercaptoethanol. Fifteen microliters of the CNBr-fragmented extract was then subjected to digestion with potato acid phosphatase in a 1-ml reaction volume, essentially as described previously (25.Roth A.F. Davis N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 661-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Following the phosphatase treatment, protein was trichloroacetic acid-precipitated and redissolved in sample buffer as described (25.Roth A.F. Davis N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 661-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The loss of Ste3 antigen either to endogenous turnover mechanisms or to digestion by added proteases was measured using quantitative AMBIS densitometry (AMBIS Systems, Inc., San Diego, CA) of films developed from ECL chemiluminescent Western blots (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Estimation of the fractional loss of Ste3 antigen entailed comparing remaining Ste3 antigen (following turnover or protease shaving) to a standard curve generated by dilution of the initial sample (e.g. receptor present at the 0-h time point of a turnover experiment or present in the control sample not subjected to protease shaving). Twenty-four lysine residues map to the predicted cytoplasmic portions of the a-factor receptor. Three of these, Lys424, Lys432, and Lys453, fall within the C-terminal, 58-residue PEST-like ubiquitination/endocytosis signal (Fig.1). We have first focused on these three lysines as potential acceptor sites for the ubiquitination associated with constitutive endocytosis. Mutant receptors were constructed with conservative arginine substitutions at one, two, or all three lysines. Mutants were compared with wild-type Ste3p for effects on both turnover and ubiquitination. Mutant receptors were expressed from the GAL1 promoter, and turnover was assessed by following the rate of receptor loss subsequent to glucose-mediated repression of new receptor synthesis. Turnover rates measured in this way are roughly equivalent to those measured viain vivo labeling, pulse-chase analysis of cells expressing Ste3p from its natural promoter (1.Roth A.F. Sullivan D.M. Davis N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 18.Davis N.G. Horecka J.L. Sprague Jr., G.F. J.

Analysis of the single lysyl replacements showed no detectable effect on turnover of either the K424R or K453R mutations (Fig.2 A). For K432R, however, turnover was clearly impaired, but not fully blocked. For receptors with two of the three lysines replaced (Fig. 2 B), the K424R,K453R receptor displayed wild-type turnover kinetics. The other two double mutants, both of which included the K432R mutation, showed partial impairments similar to that observed for the single K432R mutant. The most complete blockade to turnover was seen for the triple 3K→R mutant (K424R,K432R,K453R), its"

A combination of difluoromethylornithine and bis(benzyl)polyamines were curative in rodent malaria (15.Bitonti A.J. Dumont J.A. Bush T.L. Edwards M.L. Stemerick D.M. McCann P.P. Sjoerdsma A. Proc.

These data provide evidence that the polyamine biosynthesis might be a potential target for a chemotherapeutic attack of P. falciparum blood stage forms.We have identified a protein of unusual size from P. falciparum exhibiting both AdoMetDC and ODC activity. Further, we have isolated the corresponding transcript that encodes a bifunctional plasmodial AdoMetDC and ODC in a single open reading frame. Recombinant expression of the entire transcript resulted in the formation of a protein that exhibited both enzyme activities supporting the existence of a novel bifunctional ODC/AdoMetDC in P. falciparum.DISCUSSIONOrnithine decarboxylase and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase represent the rate-limiting enzymes of polyamine biosynthesis. Their abundance, activity, and stability is regulated individually on the transcriptional, translational, and post-translational level in all organisms investigated so far. We have identified a transcript in the malaria parasite P. falciparum that shows homology to ODC sequences of other organisms in the C-terminal region and to AdoMetDC sequences in the N-terminal region demonstrated by the occurrence of residues essential for catalytic activity, dimerization, and pro-enzyme processing (28.Lu L.

Within the folate metabolic pathway of Plasmodia but also of other protozoa, two bifunctional proteins were identified that are thought to coordinate consecutive reactions in this pathway (39.Bzik D.

Parasitol. 1995; 72: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The best known example is that of thymidylate synthase and dihydrofolate reductase, which form a bifunctional protein containing the dihydrofolate reductase domain in the N-terminal region joined to thymidylate synthase at the C terminus by a junction peptide of varying size depending on the organism (39.Bzik D.

Parasitol. 1989; 34: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The other bifunctional protein identified in P. falciparum consists of an N-terminal dihydropteroate synthetase joined to a C-terminal dihydro-6-hydroxymethylpterin pyrophosphokinase (41.Triglia T. Cowman A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7149-7153Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). It has been speculated that the biological advantage of bifunctional proteins is a metabolic channeling of substrates and thus an optimized formation of products without any further regulatory processes involved (40.Ivanetich K.M. Santi D.V. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 1591-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).However, that seems not to be likely for the particular bifunctional ODC/AdoMetDC because the products decarboxylated AdoMet and putrescine require the activity of a third enzyme, spermidine synthase, to form spermidine. Coordinated regulation on the transcriptional and translational level of ODC/AdoMetDC synthesis appears to be advantageous to ensure that AdoMet, which may be in short supply, is only decarboxylated when putrescine is available for the formation of spermidine. This hypothesis is in agreement with the predominant transcription of the ODC/AdoMetDC gene at the trophozoite stage, demonstrating that at this time of parasite development the requirement for polyamines is high due to rapid growth and the onset of DNA synthesis. In addition, it can be envisaged that in the bifunctional protein the catalytic activity of the ODC and AdoMetDC are directly affected by each other, their substrates, and products.The deduced polypeptide chain of the bifunctional Plasmodiumenzyme has a predicted molecular mass of 166 kDa, whereas the enzymatically active native enzyme as well as the recombinantly expressed ODC/AdoMetDC exhibited a molecular mass of about 330 kDa. Further, SDS-PAGE analysis of the recombinant bifunctional ODC/AdoMetDC revealed that the enzyme consists of subunits of 160 and 9 kDa, suggesting a heterotetrameric structure, derived from two proproteins, post-translationally processed and cleaved within the AdoMetDC domain.The monofunctional mammalian ODC consists of two identical subunits and forms a homodimer (45.Seely J.E. Pösö H. Pegg A.E. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 3394-3399Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Monofunctional AdoMetDC isolated from several organisms, including parasitic worms and protozoa, is post-translationally cleaved and two low and two high molecular weight subunits form the heterotetrameric active protein. During this post-translational processing the essential pyruvate prosthetic group is formed from a serine residue at the cleavage site (19.Da'dara A.A. Henkle-Dührsen K. Walter R.D. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 25.Pajunen A. Crozat A. Jänne O.A. Ihalainen R. Laitinen P.H. Stanley B. Madhubala R. Pegg A.E. J. Biol.

The region surrounding the potential cleavage site is almost completely conserved within the plasmodial sequence. Assuming that a similar process occurs in P. falciparum,2 the native ODC/AdoMetDC most likely is an enzyme complex consisting of a homodimeric ODC part and a heterotetrameric AdoMetDC part separated by a hinge region that may facilitate the formation of such a complex structure. However, the results obtained on the organization of the bifunctional protozoan dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase revealed that it is a homodimeric protein, consistent with the occurrence of a homodimeric monofunctional thymidylate synthase but in contrast to the monofunctional dihydrofolate reductase, which is usually a monomer in other organisms (47.Blakely R.L. Blakely R.L. Folates and Pteridines. John Wiley & Sons, New York1984: 191-253Google Scholar, 48.Perryman S.M. Rossana C. Deng T. Vanin E.F. Johnson L.F. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1986; 3: 313-321PubMed Google Scholar).The unusual size of the P. falciparum ODC/AdoMetDC results also from the fact that a number of large insertions interrupt the regions of amino acid homology within both the ODC and AdoMetDC domains. Insertions of different sizes have been identified in several plasmodial proteins such as protein kinases, HSP 90, RNA polymerases, and the γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (20.Lüersen K. Walter R.D. Müller S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 98: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 49.Giesecke H. Barake J.C. Langsley G. Cornelissen A.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Parasitol. 1995; 72: 163-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These insertions are characterized by a high abundance of charged amino acids like Asp, Asn, Gln, Glu, Ser, and Lys. Conspicuously, both insertions in the putative bifunctional PfODC/AdoMetDC are enriched in the amino acid asparagine, which represents about 18% in the AdoMetDC insertion and 30% in the insert of the ODC domain. The function of such insertions is still unknown.Both ODC and AdoMetDC are proteins of low stability in mammalian cells. Their half-lives range between 10 min and 1 h. Rapid degradation is conferred by antizyme (in the case of ODC) and the presence of the so called PEST region in their protein sequences (52.Russell D.H. Snyder S.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1969; 5: 253-262PubMed Google Scholar, 53.Hayashi S. Hayashi S. Ornithine Decarboxylase: Biology, Enzymology and Molecular Genetics. Pergamon Press, New York1989: 47-58Google Scholar). Such PEST regions are characterized by a high abundance of the amino acids proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine and are found to be correlated with the short half-life of proteins (54.Rogers S. Wells R. Rechensteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1946) Google Scholar). Such sequences are not only found in mammalian ODC and AdoMetDC but also in the sequence of C. fasciculata ODC (27.Svensson F. Ceriani C. Wallström E.L. Kockum I. Algranati I.D. Heby O. Persson L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), which is surprising because other trypanosomatids contain an ODC protein with a much longer half-life of several hours. Accordingly, the sequence ofTrypanosoma brucei ODC does not contain a region enriched in the amino acids PEST (55.Ghoda L. Phillips M.A. Bass K.E. Wang C.C. Coffino P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11823-11826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the C-terminal part of thePfODC domain revealed a relatively high abundance of Pro, Glu, and Ser, which may indicate a rapid turnover of the plasmodial protein. However, it has been reported previously that plasmodial ODC is rather stable (56.Assaraf Y.G. Kahana C. Spira D.T. Bachrach U. Exp. Parasitol. 1988; 67: 20-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).Preliminary steady-state kinetic parameters for both enzyme activities were determined using partially purified ODC/AdoMetDC. TheK m values of both enzyme activities were comparable to those of the AdoMetDC and ODC monofunctional proteins from mammals (32.Stanley B.A. Shantz L.M. Pegg A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7901-7907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46.Persson K. Aslund L. Grahn B. Hanke J. Heby O. Biochem.

Biochem. J. 1983; 213: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).The data presented here describe the occurrence of a unique bifunctional ODC/AdoMetDC in P. falciparum. This organization suggests differences in comparison to the mammalian proteins, which may be exploitable for the design and synthesis of parasite-specific inhibitors. Using such inhibitors and applying molecular methods for the validation of the essential role of this protein for the survival of P. falciparum we will further assess this novel bifunctional protein as a target for the design of new antimalarials. Polyamines are ubiquitous and play a pivotal role in cell growth and differentiation (1.Tabor H. Tabor C.W. Pharmacol. Rev. 1984; 16: 245-300Google Scholar, 2.Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Microbiol. Rev. 1985; 49: 81-99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of polyamines depends on the decarboxylation of ornithine to putrescine and the subsequent attachment of aminopropyl groups to its terminal amino substituents to form spermidine and spermine, respectively. Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC,1 EC 4.1.1.17) andS-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC, EC 4.1.1.50), the latter provides the aminopropyl group, are rate-limiting enzymes in this pathway. Usually the level and the activities of both of these enzymes are individually regulated on the transcriptional, translational as well as the post-translational level (3.Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1986; 234: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar, 4.Persson H. Holm I. Stjernborg L. Heby O. Adv. Exp. Med.

The rapidly spreading resistance against existing drugs has led to an urgent need for the development of new antimalarials, which attack novel targets in the metabolism of P. falciparum. In previous studies it was shown that inhibition of polyamine biosynthesis as well as the use of polyamine analogues that interfere with polyamine functions have antitumor and antiparasitic effects (7.Porter C.W.

Conspicuously, both insertions in the putative bifunctional PfODC/AdoMetDC are enriched in the amino acid asparagine, which represents about 18% in the AdoMetDC insertion and 30% in the insert of the ODC domain. The function of such insertions is still unknown.Both ODC and AdoMetDC are proteins of low stability in mammalian cells. Their half-lives range between 10 min and 1 h. Rapid degradation is conferred by antizyme (in the case of ODC) and the presence of the so called PEST region in their protein sequences (52.Russell D.H. Snyder S.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1969; 5: 253-262PubMed Google Scholar, 53.Hayashi S. Hayashi S. Ornithine Decarboxylase: Biology, Enzymology and Molecular Genetics. Pergamon Press, New York1989: 47-58Google Scholar). Such PEST regions are characterized by a high abundance of the amino acids proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine and are found to be correlated with the short half-life of proteins (54.Rogers S. Wells R. Rechensteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1946) Google Scholar). Such sequences are not only found in mammalian ODC and AdoMetDC but also in the sequence of C. fasciculata ODC (27.Svensson F. Ceriani C. Wallström E.L. Kockum I. Algranati I.D. Heby O. Persson L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), which is surprising because other trypanosomatids contain an ODC protein with a much longer half-life of several hours. Accordingly, the sequence ofTrypanosoma brucei ODC does not contain a region enriched in the amino acids PEST (55.Ghoda L. Phillips M.A. Bass K.E. Wang C.C. Coffino P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11823-11826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the C-terminal part of thePfODC domain revealed a relatively high abundance of Pro, Glu, and Ser, which may indicate a rapid turnover of the plasmodial protein. However, it has been reported previously that plasmodial ODC is rather stable (56.Assaraf Y.G. Kahana C. Spira D.T. Bachrach U. Exp. Parasitol. 1988; 67: 20-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).Preliminary steady-state kinetic parameters for both enzyme activities were determined using partially purified ODC/AdoMetDC. TheK m values of both enzyme activities were comparable to those of the AdoMetDC and ODC monofunctional proteins from mammals (32.Stanley B.A. Shantz L.M. Pegg A.E. J. Biol.

This organization suggests differences in comparison to the mammalian proteins, which may be exploitable for the design and synthesis of parasite-specific inhibitors. Using such inhibitors and applying molecular methods for the validation of the essential role of this protein for the survival of P. falciparum we will further assess this novel bifunctional protein as a target for the design of new antimalarials. Ornithine decarboxylase and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase represent the rate-limiting enzymes of polyamine biosynthesis. Their abundance, activity, and stability is regulated individually on the transcriptional, translational, and post-translational level in all organisms investigated so far. We have identified a transcript in the malaria parasite P. falciparum that shows homology to ODC sequences of other organisms in the C-terminal region and to AdoMetDC sequences in the N-terminal region demonstrated by the occurrence of residues essential for catalytic activity, dimerization, and pro-enzyme processing (28.Lu L.

Biochem. 1993; 218: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Bifunctional proteins are not unusual in P. falciparum. Within the folate metabolic pathway of Plasmodia but also of other protozoa, two bifunctional proteins were identified that are thought to coordinate consecutive reactions in this pathway (39.Bzik D.

Parasitol. 1995; 72: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The best known example is that of thymidylate synthase and dihydrofolate reductase, which form a bifunctional protein containing the dihydrofolate reductase domain in the N-terminal region joined to thymidylate synthase at the C terminus by a junction peptide of varying size depending on the organism (39.Bzik D. Li W.-B. Hori T. Inselburg J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8360-8364Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 43.Grumont R. Washtien W.L. Caput D. Santi D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Parasitol. 1989; 34: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The other bifunctional protein identified in P. falciparum consists of an N-terminal dihydropteroate synthetase joined to a C-terminal dihydro-6-hydroxymethylpterin pyrophosphokinase (41.Triglia T. Cowman A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7149-7153Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). It has been speculated that the biological advantage of bifunctional proteins is a metabolic channeling of substrates and thus an optimized formation of products without any further regulatory processes involved (40.Ivanetich K.M. Santi D.V. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 1591-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, that seems not to be likely for the particular bifunctional ODC/AdoMetDC because the products decarboxylated AdoMet and putrescine require the activity of a third enzyme, spermidine synthase, to form spermidine. Coordinated regulation on the transcriptional and translational level of ODC/AdoMetDC synthesis appears to be advantageous to ensure that AdoMet, which may be in short supply, is only decarboxylated when putrescine is available for the formation of spermidine. This hypothesis is in agreement with the predominant transcription of the ODC/AdoMetDC gene at the trophozoite stage, demonstrating that at this time of parasite development the requirement for polyamines is high due to rapid growth and the onset of DNA synthesis. In addition, it can be envisaged that in the bifunctional protein the catalytic activity of the ODC and AdoMetDC are directly affected by each other, their substrates, and products. The deduced polypeptide chain of the bifunctional Plasmodiumenzyme has a predicted molecular mass of 166 kDa, whereas the enzymatically active native enzyme as well as the recombinantly expressed ODC/AdoMetDC exhibited a molecular mass of about 330 kDa. Further, SDS-PAGE analysis of the recombinant bifunctional ODC/AdoMetDC revealed that the enzyme consists of subunits of 160 and 9 kDa, suggesting a heterotetrameric structure, derived from two proproteins, post-translationally processed and cleaved within the AdoMetDC domain. The monofunctional mammalian ODC consists of two identical subunits and forms a homodimer (45.Seely J.E. Pösö H. Pegg A.E. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 3394-3399Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Monofunctional AdoMetDC isolated from several organisms, including parasitic worms and protozoa, is post-translationally cleaved and two low and two high molecular weight subunits form the heterotetrameric active protein. During this post-translational processing the essential pyruvate prosthetic group is formed from a serine residue at the cleavage site (19.Da'dara A.A. Henkle-Dührsen K. Walter R.D. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 25.Pajunen A. Crozat A. Jänne O.A. Ihalainen R. Laitinen P.H. Stanley B. Madhubala R. Pegg A.E. J. Biol.

The region surrounding the potential cleavage site is almost completely conserved within the plasmodial sequence. Assuming that a similar process occurs in P. falciparum,2 the native ODC/AdoMetDC most likely is an enzyme complex consisting of a homodimeric ODC part and a heterotetrameric AdoMetDC part separated by a hinge region that may facilitate the formation of such a complex structure. However, the results obtained on the organization of the bifunctional protozoan dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase revealed that it is a homodimeric protein, consistent with the occurrence of a homodimeric monofunctional thymidylate synthase but in contrast to the monofunctional dihydrofolate reductase, which is usually a monomer in other organisms (47.Blakely R.L. Blakely R.L. Folates and Pteridines. John Wiley & Sons, New York1984: 191-253Google Scholar, 48.Perryman S.M. Rossana C. Deng T. Vanin E.F. Johnson L.F. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1986; 3: 313-321PubMed Google Scholar). The unusual size of the P. falciparum ODC/AdoMetDC results also from the fact that a number of large insertions interrupt the regions of amino acid homology within both the ODC and AdoMetDC domains. Insertions of different sizes have been identified in several plasmodial proteins such as protein kinases, HSP 90, RNA polymerases, and the γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (20.Lüersen K. Walter R.D. Müller S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 98: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 49.Giesecke H. Barake J.C. Langsley G. Cornelissen A.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

https://openalex.org/W1990061796,"The human growth hormone (hGH) cluster contains five genes. The hGH-N gene is predominantly expressed in pituitary somatotropes, whereas the remaining four genes, the chorionic somatomammotropin genes (hCS-L, hCS-A, and hCS-B) and hGH-V, are expressed selectively in the placenta. In contrast, the mouse genome contains a single pituitary-specific GH gene and lacks any GH-related CS genes. Activation of the hGH transgene in the mouse is dependent on its linkage to a previously described locus control region (LCR) located −15 to −32 kilobases upstream of the hGH cluster. The sporadic, nonreproducible expression of hCS transgenes lacking the LCR suggests that they may be dependent on hGH LCR activity as well. To determine whether the hCS genes could be expressed with appropriate placental specificity, a series of five transgenic mouse lines carrying an 87-kilobase human genomic insert encompassing the majority of the hGH gene cluster and the entire contiguous LCR was established. All of the hGH cluster genes were appropriately expressed in each of these lines. High level expression of hGH was restricted to the pituitary and hCS to the labyrinthine layer of the placenta. The expression of the GH cluster genes in their respective tissues paralleled transgene copy numbers irrespective of the transgene insertion site in the host mouse genome. These studies have extended the utility of the transgenic mouse model for the analysis of the full spectrum of hGH gene cluster activation.

It contains five genes that share greater than 94% sequence identity (1.Chen E.Y. Liao Y.-C. Smith D.H. Barrera-Saldaña H.A. Gelinas R.E. Seeburg P.

Boime I. Endocrinology. 1980; 107: 761-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 4.Walker W.H. Fitzpatrick S.L. Barrera-Saldaña H.A. Resendez-Perez D. Saunders G.F.

Invest. 1989; 83: 1985-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Among the placental genes, hCS-A and hCS-B are highly expressed, whereas hCS-L and hGH-V are expressed at trace levels (6.MacLeod J.N. Lee A.K. Liebhaber S.A. Cooke N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14219-14226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mutually exclusive tissue specificities and distinctive developmental controls of the closely spaced and structurally related hGH and hCS genes make the hGH gene cluster a highly informative model system for the study of gene expression in mammalian development. Activation and expression of genes in their native chromatin context reflect the combined actions of multiple determinants. The most well characterized cis-acting determinants of gene expression are those located in close proximity to the respective promoter. There are a number of well defined and functionally characterized promoter proximal determinants critical to the expression of hGH-N. Among these are a pair of binding sites for the tissue-restricted POU-homeodomain protein, Pit-1/GHF-1 (7.Lefevre C. Imagawa M. Dana S. Grindlay J. Bodner M. Karin M. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 971-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and a binding site for the more widely expressed zinc-finger protein factor (Zn-15) (8.Lipkin S.M. Näär A.M. Kalla K.A. Sack R.A. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1674-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In the case of the hGH-N gene these proximal promoter elements, necessary for gene expression in cell transfection assays, are insufficient to mediatein vivo, tissue-specific expression in transgenic mouse lines (9.Hammer R.E. Palmiter R.D. Brinster R.L. Nature. 1984; 311: 65-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 10.Jones B.K. Monks B.R. Liebhaber S.A. Cooke N.E. Mol. Cell.

A. 1998; 95: 10655-10660Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This observation points to the existence of determinants located at a greater distance from the hGH gene that are essential to the establishment of a transcriptionally active chromatin domain. A set of such determinants, located from 14.5 to 32 kb 5′ to the hGH-N gene promoter, were identified by DNaseI hypersensitivity (HS) mapping of chromatin from expressing tissues. The closely spaced HSI and HSII are specific to pituitary chromatin, HSIII and HSV are shared by pituitary and placental chromatin, and HSIV is specific to placental chromatin. When linked to the hGH-N gene, the full set of determinants directs high level, position-independent, somatotrope-specific expression of the hGH-N gene in transgenic mice in a consistent and predictable manner (10.Jones B.K. Monks B.R. Liebhaber S.A. Cooke N.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7010-7021Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 11.Bennani-Baiti I.M. Asa S.L. Song D. Iratni R. Liebhaber S.A. Cooke N.E. Proc Natl. Acad. Sci.U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10655-10660Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The ability of these determinants to overcome site of integration effects on the hGH-N gene fulfills the functional criteria for a locus control region (LCR). These criteria were initially defined for the human β-globin LCR (12.Palmiter R.D. Brinster R.L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1986; 20: 465-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar, 13.Forrester W.C.

Cell. 1998; 95: 299-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). A similar dependence of the placental genes in the hGH gene cluster on LCR activation has not been demonstrated. The hCS-A transgene, with extensive 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences, is either not expressed at all or is expressed at low and unpredictable levels in the mouse placenta (10.Jones B.K. Monks B.R. Liebhaber S.A. Cooke N.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7010-7021Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). These observations might reflect two alternative, or coexisting, mechanisms: 1) the mouse, which lacks CS-like genes, is unable to support hCS transgene expression in the placenta because of a species-specific array of placental transcription factors poorly suited for hCS gene activation or 2) the consistent activation of the hCS transgene is dependent on linkage to the hGH LCR. This second possibility is supported by our previous observation that a specific subset of hGH LCR HS form in the chromatin of primary human placental syncytiotrophoblast nuclei (10.Jones B.K. Monks B.R. Liebhaber S.A. Cooke N.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7010-7021Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In the present report we have isolated a human genomic clone that contains the entire LCR as well as much of the contiguous gene cluster encompassing both hGH-N and hCS-A. By introducing this 87-kb transgene into the mouse genome we are able to document the competence of the mouse transgenic model to reliably support appropriate expression of the hGH gene cluster in both the pituitary and the placenta. These data support the role of the hGH LCR in activation of both hGH and hCS gene expression.

Oligonucleotide probes were labeled at their 5′-terminus by [γ-32P]ATP with T4 polynucleotide kinase. Antisense and sense riboprobes were labeled with [α-33P]UTP by T7- or SP6-mediated transcription of respective templates. The hGH-N genomic probe was a 1.37-kb SmaI fragment (coordinates −494 to 876 bp, relative to the hGH-N transcription initiation site) (10.Jones B.K. Monks B.R. Liebhaber S.A. Cooke N.E. Mol. Cell.

The MX probe, which detects the unique sequence 3′-flanking region of the mζ-globin gene, was released as a 1.3-kb BamHI fragment from pMX plasmid (20.Liebhaber S.A. Wang Z. Cash F.E. Monks B.

A doubly positive clone, P1 6057, was obtained. P1 6057 was mapped by Southern blot analysis of complete restriction enzyme digestions (see “Results”) and by indirect end labeling of partial digestions. In the latter case, the DNA was linearized with NotI and subsequently partially digested with ClaI or EcoRI. Digests were electrophoresed on pulsed field gels (FIGE Mapper Electrophoresis System), DNA was transferred to Zetabind, and the membranes were incubated with a 32P-labeled oligomer corresponding to the T7 site in the P1 vector or to a probe corresponding to the 3′-end of linearized P1 6057. This mapping served to screen for any deletions or rearrangements in the insert compared with the sequence (GenBankTMAC005803) or the known restriction map of the LCR and gene cluster (1.Chen E.Y. Liao Y.-C. Smith D.H. Barrera-Saldaña H.A. Gelinas R.E. Seeburg P. Genomics. 1989; 4: 479-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 10.Jones B.K. Monks B.R. Liebhaber S.A. Cooke N.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7010-7021Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). P1 6057 plasmid DNA was linearized at the NotI site (Fig. 1), purified by Elutip (Schleicher & Schuell), adjusted to 2 ng/μl in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm EDTA, and microinjected into the male pronucleus of fertilized mouse eggs (University of Pennsylvania Transgenic and Chimeric Mouse Core). Positive founders were identified by dot blot analysis of tail DNA using the hGH-N probe. The transgene was mapped in F1 progeny, and the transgene copy number for each line was determined by Southern blot analysis (described in “Results”). 7–10 μg of restriction enzyme-digested mouse tail DNA was fractionated on 0.8% agarose gels. This was transferred to a Zetabind nylon membrane with 10× SSC (1.5m NaCl, 0.15 m sodium citrate), UV cross-linked to the membrane, and prehybridized (0.5 mNaPO4, pH 7.2, 7% SDS, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 200 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA) at 65 °C overnight. The membrane was subsequently hybridized at 65 °C overnight with 2 × 106 cpm/ml of probe, washed twice with 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS, and washed a third time with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS. The washed blots were exposed to XAR-5 film (Kodak), and signals were quantified by phosphorimager analysis. Total RNA was extracted from various organs with RNAzol, and poly(A)+ RNA was extracted from placenta with an Oligotex mRNA Mini Kit. 5–10 μg of total RNA or poly(A)+ mRNA were denatured at 65 °C, fractionated on 1% agarose gels containing 2.2 m formaldehyde in 0.1m MOPS, pH 7.0, 0.6 m sodium acetate, 0.1m EDTA, pH 8.0, and transferred to Zetabind nylon membrane in 10× SSC. After UV cross-linking, the blot was prehybridized in 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS at 42 °C for 1–5 h. The membrane was subsequently hybridized by adding 1–2 × 106 cpm/ml of the indicated probe at 42 °C overnight and washed (2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, then 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS, and finally 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS) at room temperature to 65 °C. hGH-N expression in the pituitary was documented and quantified relative to endogenous mGH mRNA by the RT-PCR approach generating an hGH-N to mGH mRNA ratio as described previously (10.Jones B.K. Monks B.R. Liebhaber S.A. Cooke N.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7010-7021Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Briefly, reverse transcription and subsequent PCR were carried out beginning with 0.2–0.5 μg of total RNA using primers corresponding to regions perfectly conserved between mGH and hGH (mhGH primer set, Table I). After 30 cycles of PCR the 3′-end-labeled cDNA products were digested with BstNI to generate fragments specific to hGH-N and mGH mRNAs. Intensities of the two bands were compared by phosphorimager analyses. The RT-PCR analysis of hCS-A expression was performed with the hGHNCSA I primer set (Table I). These primers annealed to both hCS-A and hGH-N mRNAs. The 5′-end-labeled cDNA products were cut withBamHI to generate a 104-bp end-labeled hCS-A cDNA band. The nested RT-PCR analysis for distinguishing hGH-N and hGH-V mRNAs was performed by using primers hGH-N/V5′ A and hGH-N 3′ and a nested [γ-32P]ATP-labeled hGH-N/V5′ B. These primers correspond to the regions conserved between hGH-N and hGH-V but do not anneal to hCS-A or hCS-L. After RT with hGH-N 3′ and 3 cycles of cold PCR with hGH-N/V5′ A and hGH-N 3′, [γ-32P]ATP-labeled hGH-N/V5′ B was added before the final 27 cycles of PCR. PCR was carried out with 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase at 1 mm Mg2+. The temperatures for annealing, elongation, and denaturation were 55, 72, and 94 °C, respectively. The 5′-end-labeled PCR products were digested with TaqI; a specific 38-bp hGH-N end-labeled cDNA fragment and a specific 120-bp hGH-V fragment were expected. The samples were analyzed on 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The RT-PCR analyses for comparing hCS-A and hGH-N expression in the placenta were performed by using the hGHNCSA II primer set followed by a nested amplification between hGHNCSA II 5′ and32P-labeled hGHNCSA II 3′ B. The 3′-end-labeled products were cut with HhaI and fractionated on 6% polyacrylamide gels to generate 141-bp hGH-N- and 130-bp hCS-A-specific fragments. Intensities of these two bands were compared by phosphorimager analysis. A pair of primers (hcs cDNA 5′ and hcs cDNA 3′; Table I) were used to amplify a 614-bp hCS-A cDNA fragment extending from coordinates 114 to 738 of the hCS-A cDNA clone (pG12F extends from 102 to 654 nucleotides of hCS-A cDNA plus the 3′-UTR and 77 base poly(A) tail (6.MacLeod J.N. Lee A.K. Liebhaber S.A. Cooke N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14219-14226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). PCR products were purified by recovery from the gel and ligation into pGEM-T easy vector (Promega). The subcloned hCS-A cDNA plasmid (641 pGEM-T-A) was linearized with SpeI (for T7 transcription) or NcoI (for Sp6 transcription). The linearized plasmids were transcribed in vitro using MEGAshortscript T7 Kit (for the antisense probe) or Sp6 Kit (for sense probe), in the presence of [α-33P]UTP. Placentas were collected from mouse embryos generated by crossing an hGH P1 line 813I male with a CD-1 female. The mother was euthanized at embryonic day 16 and the placentas were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.2) at 4 °C overnight. Genotypes were determined by dot blot analyses of embryonic tissues. Placentas of the transgenic and wild-type mice were embedded in paraffin, and 5-μm sections were prepared and treated for in situ hybridization as described previously with minor modifications (22.Duncan S.A. Manova K. Chen W.S. Hoodless P. Weinstein D.C. Bachvarova R.F. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7598-7602Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Briefly, wax was removed, and the sections were rehydrated, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.2) for 20 min, and washed twice with PBS for 5 min each. The sections were treated with 20 μg/ml proteinase K in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA for 7.5 min, washed with PBS, and fixed again in 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min. After washing with PBS, the slides were treated in 0.1 m triethanolamine for 5 min followed by incubation in 0.25% acetic anhydride in 0.1 mtriethanolamine for 5 min. Following washing with 2× SSC, the slides were incubated overnight with 4 × 106 cpm of probe in 100 μl of hybridization buffer (40% formamide, 0.48 mNaCl, 8 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.6 mm EDTA, 0.8× Denhardt's solution, 0.4 mg/ml yeast tRNA, 80 μg/ml poly(A)+ RNA, and 10% dextran sulfate) overnight at 65 °C. The slides were washed with 5× SSC for 10 min at 50 °C, then in 50% formamide, 2× SSC for 20 min at 65 °C, next in RNase buffer (0.3 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA) for 30 min at 37 °C, and then digested with RNase A (50 μg/ml) in the same buffer for 30 min at 37 °C. Finally the slides were washed with RNase buffer, 50% formamide in 2× SSC, 2× SSC alone, and 0.1× SSC. The slides were dehydrated and exposed to emulsion for about 2 weeks and then developed and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Bright field and dark field micrographs were generated using a Nikon Microphot-FX microscope. A genomic fragment containing the entire hGH LCR and the majority of the contiguous hGH gene cluster was isolated from a human genomic P1 library. The library was screened with amplimers specific for the region immediately 5′ to HSV of the LCR and a second primer set specific for a site 3 kb 3′ to the hCS-A gene. A clone positive with both probes, P1 6057, was isolated and named “hGH/P1.” The restriction map of this clone was compared with the known genomic structure (1.Chen E.Y. Liao Y.-C. Smith D.H. Barrera-Saldaña H.A. Gelinas R.E. Seeburg P. Genomics. 1989; 4: 479-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 10.Jones B.K. Monks B.R. Liebhaber S.A. Cooke N.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7010-7021Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The hGH-N probe, which cross-hybridizes to each of the genes in the cluster, identified unique 10.5 and 7.8 kb BglII bands corresponding to hCS-A and hCS-L and a more intense 2.6-kb band containing the two identically sized fragments with the hGH-N and hGH-V genes, respectively (Fig.1 B, right). Missing was the most 3′-gene in the cluster, hCS-B, which would have been present on a 3-kb BglII fragment. The HSI and -II probe detected the expected 1.6-kb BglII fragment (Fig.1 B, middle), and the HSIV probe hybridized to the expected 22 kb EcoRI band encompassing HSIII, HSIV, and HSV (Fig. 1 B, left). Additional mapping of the hGH/P1 insert DNA by complete and partial digestions failed to reveal any rearrangements or deletions when compared with the genomic structure (data not shown). The orientation of the insert relative to the vector (Fig. 1 C) was established by demonstrating that the vector-derived T7 polymerase segment and the HSIV site were located on the same ClaI restriction fragment (data not shown). Thus the 87-kb P1 6057 (hGH/P1) insert spanned coordinates −45.8 to 40.6 kb of the hGH locus (hGH-N transcription start site as coordinate 1) and contained all five HS sites of the LCR and the contiguous hGH-N, hCS-L, hCS-A, and hGH-V genes (Fig. 1, A andC). The hGH/P1 plasmid was mapped for rare cutting endonucleases sites to identify a unique site for linearization prior to zygotic microinjection.NotI, SalI, and SfiI were tested because each cleaves a single site adjacent to the P1 vector cloning site (23.Sternberg N.L. Trends Genet. 1992; 8: 11-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The banding pattern of the restriction digestions on 1% agarose pulsed field gels demonstrated that the insert contained twoSfiI sites and one SalI site but lacked aNotI site (data not shown). NotI was therefore used for linearization (Fig. 1 C). The size of theNotI-linearized plasmid was consistent with the 87-kb genomic insert size (see above). The linearized hGH/P1 plasmid was microninjected into fertilized mouse oocytes, and five transgenic founders were obtained: 809C, 809F, 811B, 811D, and 813I. Each founder was crossed with a CD1 mate to generate an F1 transgenic. The integrity and copy number of the transgene in each line was determined by Southern blot of F1 tail DNA. Membranes were sequentially hybridized with probes for hGH-N, HSI, -II, and HSIV. Fig.2 shows a representative Southern blot using the 1.37-kb hGH-N probe. In all cases, the bands predicted by the map (Fig. 1) were obtained. The transgene copy number was estimated for each line by normalizing the transgene signals to a loading control, the mouse ζ-globin probe (m-MX), and to human genomic DNA. The transgene copy numbers determined in this way ranged from 2 to 19 (Fig.2). In previous studies we documented that the hGH-N gene is appropriately expressed in the pituitaries of transgenic mice when linked to its contiguous LCR (10.Jones B.K. Monks B.R. Liebhaber S.A. Cooke N.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7010-7021Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). To confirm and extend this observation, expression of the hGH cluster containing the hGH-N gene as well as the linked and placentally expressed hCS-L, hCS-A, and hGH-V genes was analyzed. RNA was isolated from the pituitaries of adult F1 transgenic mice from each of the five hGH/P1 lines. These samples were analyzed for hGH-N, hCS, and hGH-V mRNAs. hGH-N mRNA was identified and quantified relative to endogenous mGH mRNA using an RT-PCR co-amplification assay (10.Jones B.K. Monks B.R. Liebhaber S.A. Cooke N.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7010-7021Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) (Fig.3 A). This approach co-amplifies hGH and mGH as identically sized fragments that can be subsequently differentiated and quantified by restriction analysis (the primers do not amplify hGH-V or hCS). The analyses of all five transgenic mouse lines revealed the expected three cDNA fragments; two (170 and 125 bp) corresponding to the two major splice products of the hGH transcript and the third (110 bp) corresponding to mGH cDNA. The ratios of the hGH to mGH signals were quantified and normalized to transgene copy number. The pituitary expression from the hGH-N gene was consistent from line to line, varying less than 3-fold (0.34–0.96) (Fig. 3 A). This range of hGH-N transgene expression was remarkably similar to that observed previously for the LCR linked to the isolated hGH-N gene (10.Jones B.K. Monks B.R. Liebhaber S.A. Cooke N.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7010-7021Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). This result demonstrated reproducible, copy number-dependent expression of the hGH-N gene from the 87-kb hGH P1 transgene. The genes in the hGH gene cluster are highly similar in structure and yet are expressed in mutually exclusive tissue distributions, predominantly in the pituitary or the placenta. To determine whether this tissue specificity of expression from the hGH gene cluster is maintained in the mouse model, the expression of hCS and hGH-V was tested in the pituitary. RT-PCR was performed on transgenic pituitary RNA using a pair of primers that were complementary to both hGH-N and hCS-A mRNAs; the co-amplified cDNAs were then distinguished by restriction digestions (Fig. 3 B). In contrast to the strong hGH-N signals in each sample, there was a complete absence of hCS-A expression in all lines. The total lack of hCS-A expression was confirmed using a technically independent hCS-specific nested RT-PCR assay (data not shown). A similar RT-PCR approach designed to detect ectopic expression of the placental hGH-V revealed total absence of expression in transgenic mouse pituitaries from each of the five transgenic lines (Fig. 3 C). Expression of the hCS-L gene was not tested, because the function of this gene has been lost during the evolution of the cluster via multiple alternative splicing errors (24.Misra-Press A., N.E. Cooke N.E. Liebhaber S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23220-23229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The high levels of hGH-N and absence of detectable expression of hGH-V or hCS-A indicated that the genes in the hGH gene cluster were expressed with appropriate tissue specificity in the pituitaries of all five of the hGH/P1 lines. All five of the hGH/P1 transgenic mouse lines displayed normal fertility, fecundity, and lifespan. Males and females from each line were weighed at intervals starting at 3 weeks of age. Although there was minor variations in body weight from line to line, only line 813I displayed a growth curve that differed significantly from sex-matched wild-type littermates. The 813I transgenic mice (both males and females) were approximately 10% larger than the matched controls after 7 weeks of age. This difference did not increase with time. The normal body growth rate of all the remaining groups indicated that hGH expression from the P1 transgene was under normal physiologic control and that no significant ectopic and/or unregulated transgene expression was occurring in other tissues. In a previous study, we had gener"

Growth factors stimulate NHE3 via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K), but mechanism of this process is not clear. To examine the hypothesis that growth factors stimulate NHE3 by modulating NHE3 recycling, and that PI3-K participates in this mechanism, we used PS120 fibroblasts expressing a fusion protein of NHE3 and green fluorescent protein. At steady state, ∼25% of cellular NHE3 content was expressed at PM. Inhibition of PI3-K decreased PM expression of NHE3, which correlated with retention of the exchanger in recycling endosomal compartment. In contrast, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) increased PM expression of NHE3, which was associated with a 2-fold increase in rate constant for exit of the exchanger from the recycling compartment. Qualitatively similar effects of bFGF were observed in cells pretreated with PI3-K inhibitors, but their magnitude was only ∼50% of that in intact cells. These data suggest that: (i) bFGF stimulates NHE3 by increasing PM expression of the exchanger; (ii) PI3-K mediates PM expression of NHE3 in both basal and bFGF-stimulated conditions, and (iii) not all of the effects of bFGF on NHE3 expression are mediated by PI3-K, suggesting additional regulatory mechanisms.

In the small intestine, NHE3 participates in neutral NaCl absorption, and in the increase in Na+ absorption that occurs via neurohormonal stimulation after meals (5.Donowitz M. Janecki A. Akhtar S.

Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1999: 89-115Google Scholar). The activity of NHE3 is acutely regulated by multiple mechanisms involving growth factors and protein kinases (6.Donowitz M. Levine S. Yun C. Brant S. Nath S. Yip J. Hoogerwerf S. Pouyssegur J.

We and others have shown that stimulation of NHE3 activity by growth factors, okadaic acid, and serum occurs via an increase in the maximal velocity (V max) of the exchange, whereas phorbol ester and carbachol inhibits NHE3 via a decrease inV max (6.Donowitz M.

Molecular Biology of Membrane Transport Disorders. Plenum Press, New York1996: 259-275Crossref Google Scholar). These effects were observed in non-polarized mesenchymal cells as well as in epithelial cells, and they suggested that at least part of the acute regulation might be accomplished by rapid changes in the number of active exchanger molecules at the plasma membrane. Over the last few years, a growing body of evidence has indicated that NHE3 might, indeed, be regulated by redistribution of the exchanger molecules between the cytoplasm and the plasma membrane. Thus, recycling of NHE3 has been suggested in kidney epithelial cells based on the results of subcellular fractionation experiments (7.Hensley C.B. Bradley M.E. Mircheff A.K. Am. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 2035-2043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) provided the first direct evidence for constitutive recycling of NHE3. These investigators used AP-1 cells expressing rat NHE3 to show that the exchanger molecules recycled between plasma membrane and a juxtanuclear cytoplasmic compartment, and that the latter most probably represented the recycling endosomal compartment. The same laboratory also provided evidence that the constitutive recycling of NHE3 in AP-1 cells was dependent on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K) activity, and that PI 3-K predominantly controlled the exocytic arm of recycling (11.Kurashima K. Szabo E.Z. Lukacs G. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20828-20836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). These observations suggested some degree of similarity between NHE3 and the family of other membrane proteins whose constitutive recycling has been shown to be controlled by PI 3-K activity. These include the transferrin receptor (12.Shepherd P.R. Soos M.A. Siddle K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 13.Spiro D.J. Boll W. Kirchhausen T. Wessling-Resnick M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 355-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), glucose transporters GLUT4 and GLUT1 (14.Yang J. Clarke J.F. Ester C.J. Young P.W. Kasuga M. Holman G.D. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and the ATP-dependent canalicular transporters in the liver (15.Misra S. Ujhazy P. Gatmaitan Z. Varticovski L. Arias I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26638-26644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Some evidence suggest that PI 3-K activity might be essential not only for control of constitutive activity, but also for mediation of the stimulation of NHE3 by growth factors. Our laboratory reported recently that inhibition of PI 3-K with wortmannin eliminated the stimulatory effects of epidermal growth factor (EGF) on the Na+reabsorption in the rabbit ileum, and on Na+/H+exchange in Caco-2 cells (16.Khurana S. Nath S.K. Levine S.A. Bowser J.M. Tse C.M. Cohen M.E. Donowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9919-9927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Based on these results, it was tempting to speculate that the PI 3-K-mediated mechanism by which growth factors stimulate NHE3 activity involves changes in the dynamics of recycling of NHE3, which, in turn, results in an increased expression of the exchanger at the PM. Such mechanism could, theoretically, be based on the same signal transduction pathway(s) as the constitutive regulation of the exchanger. In such situation, regulatory stimulus might simply amplify the existing mechanisms (e.g. by stimulating the activity and/or intracellular redistribution of PI 3-kinase). Alternatively, the growth factor-regulated pathway might also involve specific mechanisms different from those utilized by the constitutive pathway. In this report we present data suggesting that bFGF stimulates NHE3 activity by increasing expression of the exchanger at the PM. We also provide evidence suggesting that the increased expression results from increased rate of exit of the exchanger molecules from the recycling endosomal compartment, and that this mechanism is partially dependent on PI 3-K activity. In order to correlate changes in cellular distribution of NHE3 with Na+/H+ exchange rate, we engineered and stably expressed in PS120 fibroblasts a fusion protein of rabbit NHE3 and green fluorescent protein (GFP). The cellular distribution and activity of the fusion protein closely resembled that of NHE3 lacking the GFP tag, confirming usefulness of this model for the intended studies. Changes in the intracellular steady-state distribution and kinetics of recycling of the fusion protein were examined in living cells using laser confocal microscopy and a novel confocal morphometric analysis. To express the NHE3-GFP fusion protein in PS120 cells, we used a cDNA coding for rabbit NHE3-VSVG protein and the red-shifted variant of green fluorescent protein (eGFP) from Aequorea victoria. The reason for choosing NHE3-VSVG (NHE3 fused at C terminus with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSVG) epitope tag) was to introduce a spacing sequence between the C terminus of NHE3 and N terminus of GFP. This had the additional advantage of providing a convenient tag for immunolocalization of the NHE3-VSVG part of the fusion protein using highly specific anti-VSVG monoclonal antibody. The red-shifted variant of GFP fluoresces approximately 35-fold more intensely than the wild type GFP, and it is also significantly more resistant to photobleaching (17.Patterson G.H. Knobel S.M. Sharif W.D. Kain S.R. Piston D.W. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 2782-2790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). The open reading frame of NHE3-VSVG (in pBluescript cassette) was amplified by PCR using primers containing HindIII andSalI restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ end, respectively. The PCR fragment was gel-purified, digested with HindIII andSalI, and subcloned into a pEGFP-N3 vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA; Fig.1). The absence of PCR-introduced mutations in the NHE3-GFP construct was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis (310 Genetic Analyzer, PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts (PS120 cells) deficient in endogenous Na+/H+ exchangers (gift from Dr. J. Pouyssegur) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 1 mm pyruvate, penicillin (50 IU/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), and 10% fetal bovine serum, in a 10% CO2 humidified incubator at 37 °C. Cells were transfected with NHE3-GFP cDNA (or with pEGFP-N3 vector) using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cell population expressing NHE3-GFP was initially enriched using the acid selection technique (18.Tse C.M. Ma A.I. Yang V.W. Watson A.J. Levine S. Montrose M.H. Potter J. Sardet C. Pouyssegur J. Donowitz M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1957-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Stable clones expressing functional NHE3-GFP (PS120-E3G cells) were subsequently isolated using dilutional cloning, propagated in a large scale culture, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. In all experiments, transfected cells were used during the initial three passages after being thawed from the frozen stock. The rate of Na+/H+ exchange in the transfected cells was examined using a modification of the previously described method based on confocal microscopy and SNARF-1 as a pH-sensitive fluorescent indicator (19.Chu S. Montrose M.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 589-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). PS120-E3G cells cultured on glass coverslips (∼75% confluence) were serum-starved for 3–4 h, and incubated for 30 min at room temperature in Na+ medium (90 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgSO4, 0.8 mm Na2H(PO4), 0.2 mmNaH2(PO4), 25 mm glucose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing 15 μm SNARF-1 (5-(and-6)-carboxy SNARF-1, acetoxymethyl ester, acetate; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and 40 mm NH4Cl (to promote subsequent intracellular acidification). Cells were initially perfused with tetramethylammonium (TMA) medium (similar to Na+medium, except that Na+ salts were replaced by TMA salts), which was then switched to Na+ medium. Images were collected every 6 s using Zeiss LSM 410 confocal fluorescent microscope, with excitation wavelength set to 488 nm, and with emission signals at 580 and 640 nm collected simultaneously by two separate photomultipliers. The ratio of signal intensity at 640 and 580 nm were calculated and then translated into intracellular pH (pHi) values using the equation obtained from the calibration curve. The calibration curve for SNARF-1 was generated in NHE3-E3G cells using the nigericin equilibration method as described previously (20.Thomas J.A. Buchsbaum R.N. Zimniak A. Racker E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar). Rates of pHi recovery (ΔpHi/s) in the presence of 131 mmNa+ were calculated for each analyzed cell separately, and were compared at the same pHi within a linear segment of the recovery curves. To examine the distribution of NHE3-GFP in PS120-E3G cells we developed a morphometric method based on confocal microscopy and digital image processing, which we describe in detail elsewhere. 2A. J. Janecki, S. Akhter, M. Donowitz, and M. Janecki, submitted for publication. The principle of this method was to label the plasma membrane (PM) of the examined living cells with a vital fluorescent dye, and then to digitally subtract the areas corresponding to the membrane from the serial confocal images of the GFP fluorescence in the examined cells. To label the PM for studies of cellular distribution of NHE3, and also for examination of endo- and exocytosis of NHE3-GFP in living cells, we used a fluorescent styryl dye FM 4–64 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). PS120-E3G cells cultured on glass coverslips were perfused on the microscope stage at 4 °C with Na+ medium containing FM 4–64 (20 μm) for 1 min, and serial optical sections in the xy plane were collected in steps of 0.4 μmin the z axis across the entire cell. The excitation wavelength was set at 488 nm, and fluorescent images were collected simultaneously at 510 nm (eGFP) and 640 nm (FM 4–64). The stored images were subsequently analyzed using MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging Corp.) as follows. First, the images of FM 4–64 fluorescence were binarized and reversed. Next, a new series of images was generated by performing a Boolean operation “AND” in the pairs of images representing FM 4–64 and eGFP signals within the same optical section. The result of this operation was a series of images in which the eGFP signal overlapping with the FM 4–64 signal was digitally subtracted. Final quantitation of the PM content of NHE3-GFP (expressed as percent of total cellular content) was performed using formula:Σ n [(IFIT − IFIC)/IFIT × 100], where IFIT and IFIC stand for total cellular and cytoplasmic eGFP fluorescence intensity, respectively, and n stands for the number of optical sections required to scan the entire cell. To complement data obtained by the morphometric analysis, we quantitated the cellular distribution of NHE3-GFP using cell surface biotinylation. PS120-E3G cells grown to ∼75% confluence in 10-cm Petri dishes were rinsed several times with phosphate-buffered saline followed by borate buffer (154 mm NaCl, 7.2 mmKCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 10 mmH3BO3, pH 9.0). The entire procedure was performed at 4 °C unless otherwise indicated. Cells were then incubated twice for 20 min with 3 ml of borate buffer containing 1.5 mg of NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce; biotinylation solution), followed by incubation with quenching buffer (120 mm NaCl and 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4. Cells were then scraped, solubilized in 1 ml of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA trisodium, 3 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 60 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), and sonicated for 20 s. The lysates were agitated for 30 min and spun at 12,000 ×g to remove insoluble debris (total fraction). The supernatant was incubated with avidin-agarose, spun, and the remaining supernatant was retained as the intracellular fraction. The avidin-agarose beads were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer yielding the surface fraction. Western analysis was performed on dilutions of all three fractions run on the same gel. Separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with monoclonal anti-VSVG antibody P5D4 (hybridoma culture medium at 1:5 dilution; kindly provided by Dr. D. Louvard, Curie Institute, Paris, France), or polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (1:1,000; CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence and quantified using a densitometer and Imagequant software. To examine the dynamics of NHE3-GFP entry into juxtanuclear cytoplasmic compartment (JNC), the PS120-E3G cells on glass coverslips were perfused in Na+ medium containing FM 4–64 (20 μm). Cells were scanned (serial 0.4-μm optical sections in xy axis) every 2–3 min, with signals from eGFP (510 nm) and FM 4–64 (640 nm) collected by separate photomultipliers. Analysis of yellow-orange particles colocalizing both fluorophores (vesicles derived from the PM containing FM 4–64 and NHE3-GFP) in the cytoplasm and in JNC was performed in the stored images using MetaMorph software. First, the JNC area was defined by selecting contiguous 6 × 6 pixel areas containing >50% of pixels with intensity of eGFP signal higher then the set threshold. This approach let us detect the border of JNC within a zone of 0.3 μm (∼3 pixels). In the JNC defined this way, more than 90% of all pixels colocalized with internalized Texas Red-conjugated transferrin (TX-Tf), a relatively specific marker of recycling endosomal compartment. Next, the particles outside JNC were counted in three categories: (i) containing only eGFP; (ii) containing only FM 4–64, and; (iii) containing both eGFP and FM 4–64. Within JNC area, the intensity of FM 4–64 signal was quantitated on a pixel to pixel basis, separately for pixels colocalizing and not colocalizing with eGFP. The values obtained for each optical section were then summed, yielding the integrated fluorescent intensity of eGFP in the PM-derived vesicles accumulated in peripheral cytoplasm and in the JNC. To evaluate the dynamics of exit of NHE3-GFP from JNC, the PS120-E3G cells were first perfused in the presence of FM 4–64 (20 μm) for 30 min at 33 °C to saturate JNC with PM-derived, NHE3-GFP-containing vesicles. Next, the cells were perfused with FM 4–64-free medium, which resulted in a dissociation of FM 4–64 from the PM within ∼90 s. Following perfusion for 3 min (to chase any remaining endocytic vesicles to the JNC), serial images were collected as described above. The fading fluorescence of FM 4–64 within the area of JNC was quantitated in the stored images as described above, separately for pixels colocalizing and not colocalizing with eGFP. To visualize the recycling endosomal compartment in PS120-E3G cells, the cells cultured on glass coverslips were incubated for 30 min at 33 °C with 25 μg/ml TX-Tf (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in the presence or absence of an excess of unconjugated transferrin (1 mg/ml; Sigma). To promote up-regulation of expression of transferrin receptor (TfR) in PS120-E3G cells, the cells were cultured for 24 h in the presence of 5% fetal bovine serum and 4 μmdeferoxamine (Sigma). Cells were than fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 10 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and examined using confocal fluorescent microscopy. The excitation/emission wavelengths were set at 288/510 nm and 543/640 nm, for eGFP and TX-Tf, respectively. With these settings, the crossover of signals between the channels was <2% of maximum fluorescence intensity in either direction (data not shown). To investigate the effect of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and/or PI 3-K inhibition on NHE3 activity, the PS12-E3G cells were serum-starved for 3–4 h and then incubated in Na+ medium containing 25 ng/ml bFGF (recombinant human bFGF; Sigma), 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Goldmark Biologicals, Phillipsburg, NJ), 15 μm SNARF-1, and 40 mm NH4Cl at 33 °C for 20 min. Coverslips with cells were than transferred to perfusion chambers, and perfused as described above, with bFGF and bovine serum albumin present in all media. To asses the effect of PI 3-K inhibition, wortmannin (100 nm) or LY294002 (50 μm) (both from Sigma) were added to the SNARF-1/NH4Cl incubation media for 30 min at 33 °C, which was followed by standard perfusion with TMA and Na+ media. In a separate set of experiments, the pHi recovery was preceded by first incubating the cells with Na+ medium containing wortmannin (100 nm) for 30 min at 33 °C, which was followed by addition of bFGF (25 ng/ml), SNARF-1 (15 μm), and NH4Cl (40 mm) for the next 20 min at 33 °C. In experiments conducted only to examine the cellular distribution of NHE3-GFP, the cells were incubated and perfused as above but with omission of SNARF-1 and NH4Cl in the incubation medium. Numerical data are expressed as means ± S.E., and the significance of difference between experimental groups was analyzed by using the two-tailed Student'st test. The pattern of cellular distribution of NHE3-GFP in stably transfected PS120 fibroblasts was examined in three-dimensional reconstructions of images of both living and fixed cells obtained by confocal microscopy. In control conditions, the bulk of NHE3-GFP was divided among three compartments: (i) the PM, (ii) the juxtanuclear accumulation, and (iii) the population of small particles (0.1–0.4 μm) distributed throughout the peripheral cytoplasm (Fig. 2, top). In both living and fixed cells, NHE3-GFP within the juxtanuclear compartment colocalized to high degree with the steady-state juxtanuclear accumulation of internalized TX-Tf/TfR complexes (Fig. 2,bottom). Quantitative analysis of the colocalization revealed that approximately 94% of all TX-Tf pixels within the JNC area colocalized with NHE3-GFP, and that only ∼8% of the NHE3-GFP pool residing in JNC did not colocalize with TX-Tf. This high degree of colocalization was found in control cells as well as in cells exposed to wortmannin (Fig. 2, bottom). No detectable accumulation of TX-Tf was observed in cells incubated with TX-Tf and an excess of unlabeled transferrin (data not shown). These findings indicated that the juxtanuclear accumulation of NHE3-GFP corresponded to the recycling endosomal compartment (REC), as suggested previously for AP-1 cells (10.D'Souza S. Garcia-Cabado A., Yu, F. Teter K. Lukacs G. Skorecki K. Moore H.P. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2035-2043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In PS120 cells transfected with pEGFP-N3 vector, eGFP was expressed diffusely throughout the cytoplasm, with no distinctive accumulation pattern (data not shown). Confocal morphometric analysis (Fig. 3,top) revealed that, in control cells, 25 ± 3% of total cellular NHE3-GFP content was expressed at the PM, regardless of the observed variability in the cell size and total amounts of expressed fusion protein. This finding suggested that the relative distribution of NHE3-GFP was tightly controlled and well conserved among the cultured cells. To complement the confocal morphometric analysis we also examined the steady-state cellular distribution of NHE3-GFP using surface biotinylation (Fig. 3, bottom). The relative surface expression of the fusion protein yielded by this method was 21.7 ± 0.9% (mean ± S.E.; n = 3 monolayers), thus very similar to the value obtained from confocal analysis. Biotinylation experiments also revealed that practically all NHE3-VSVG molecules were expressed in fusion with eGFP, and that no detectable amounts of NHE3-VSVG free of GFP moiety (M r ∼85 kDa) was expressed in the transfected cells (Fig. 3, bottom). Similar results were obtained when the blots were probed with the anti-GFP antibody (data not shown). The main reason for using SNARF-1 (instead of BCECF, which we have used in the past) as a pHiindicator was an overlap of emission maxima for eGFP (510 nm) and BCECF (530 nm). The SNARF-1 method could reliably detect a difference in pHi ≥ 0.02 pHi units within the pHi range of 6.30–7.60. Moreover, the calibration curve obtained for PS120-E3G cells was almost identical to the one obtained for PS120-E3V cells, suggesting similar buffering capacities of PS120-E3G and PS120-E3V cells (Fig.4 A). An example of pHi recovery curves obtained from five PS120-E3G cells is shown in Fig. 4 B. At 33 °C in control conditions, the average exchange rate (ΔpHi/s) was 0.052 ± 0.004 (mean ± S.E.; 180 cells in 12 experiments). In comparison, the average rate of pHi recovery (at pHi = 6.7) in PS120-E3V was 0.040 ± 0.006 (mean ± S.E.; 40 cells in three experiments). The rate of Na+/H+exchange in PS120 cells transfected with pEGFP-N3 vector was undetectable (data not shown). Experiments in which PM of living PS120-E3G cells was labeled with FM 4–64 revealed that NHE3 constitutively recycled between PM and REC. The fluorescent styryl dye FM 4–64 binds to the outer lipid layer of PM and saturates the binding sites within ∼50 s. It remains bound to PM as long as it is present in the perfusate at a sufficiently high concentration (21.Betz W.J. Mao F. Smith C.B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). FM 4–64 is highly fluorescent in a lipid environment, it does not penetrate PM, and is not cytotoxic, thus fulfilling nearly all the conditions for an ideal PM marker in living cells. Shortly after exposure of PS120-E3G cells to FM 4–64, the PM was uniformly labeled with the fluorophore (Fig. 5 B). Within a few minutes, yellow-orange particles colocalizing FM 4–64 and eGFP could be seen in the peripheral cytoplasm and within REC (Fig.5 B). Quantitative analysis of these particles revealed that 93 ± 8% (mean ± S.E., 36 cells in three separate experiments) of all particles containing FM 4–64 colocalized with eGFP. At 33 °C, the maximum integrated intensity of FM 4–64 within REC was observed after approximately 15 min (Fig. 5 C). This level of FM 4–64 fluorescence within REC did not change for up to 60 min of perfusion, suggesting a steady-state concentration (data not shown). Within ∼90 s following removal of FM 4–64 from perfusate, more than 95% of the fluorophore dissociated from the PM, thus interrupting the supply of endocytic vesicles containing both the membrane marker and NHE3-GFP. Over the following 3–4 min, most of the cytoplasmic particles colocalizing FM 4–64 and NHE3-GFP were chased to REC and disappeared from the cell periphery. Within the next several minutes, the intensity of FM 4–64 colocalizing with GFP within REC begun to decrease visibly. This was associated with the reappearance of yellow-orange particles of 0.1–0.4 μm in diameter in the peripheral cytoplasm (Fig. 5 D). After 28 min of perfusion, only approximately 5% of the initially present FM 4–64 fluorescence remained within REC (Fig. 5 E). Analysis of the kinetics of recycling of FM 4–64/NHE3-GFP vesicles in PS120-E3G cells revealed that both accumulation in, and exit from REC of NHE3-GFP were governed by a single exponential function, thus suggesting first order kinetics. In order to calculate the apparent rate constants for both processes, the kinetic data were normalized for the maximal intensity of the FM 4–64 fluorescence within the REC, and the logarithms of the obtained values were plotted against"
https://openalex.org/W1981204372,"P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) is a disulfide-bonded, homodimeric mucin (∼250 kDa) on leukocytes that binds to P-selectin on platelets and endothelial cells during the initial steps in inflammation.

Recombinant forms of PSGL-1 were created in which the single extracellular Cys (Cys320) was replaced with either Ser (C320S-PSGL-1) or Ala (C320A-PSGL-1).

Affinity and kinetic analysis indicates that P-selectin binds with high affinity (K d ∼300 nm) to a single class of sites on neutrophil-derived PSGL-1 (20.Mehta P. Cummings R.D. McEver R.P. J. Biol.

The post-translational modifications of PSGL-1 required for high affinity interactions with P-selectin have been a major focus of inquiry. Cleavage of the signal peptide and propeptide generates mature PSGL-1 with an NH2 terminus beginning at residue 42. PSGL-1 contains a Thr residue at position 57 and three Tyr residues at positions 46, 48, and 51 that are required for high affinity interactions with P-selectin (11.Wilkins P.P. Moore K.L.

Furthermore, PSGL-1 expressed recombinantly in CHO cells requires co-expression of an α1,3-fucosyltransferase and core-2 β1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase for recognition by P-selectin (17.Li F. Wilkins P.P. Crawley S. Weinstein J. Cummings R.D. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3255-3264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 22.Kumar R. Camphausen R.T. Sullivan F.X. Cumming D.A. Blood. 1996; 88: 3872-3879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, neutrophils from mice lacking the core-2 β1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase bind poorly to fluid-phase P-, L-, and E-selectin (23.Ellies L.G. Tsuboi S. Petryniak B. Lowe J.B. Fukuda M. Marth J.D. Immunity. 1998; 9: 881-890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), further suggesting a role for core-2 based O-glycans in PSGL-1 function. Earlier studies on recombinant chimeric forms of PSGL-1 suggested that P-selectin recognizes the NH2-terminal region of PSGL-1 in both static cell adhesion assays (12.Sako D. Comess K.M. Barone K.M. Camphausen R.T. Cumming D.A. Shaw G.D. Cell. 1995; 83: 323-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 13.Pouyani T. Seed B. Cell. 1995; 83: 333-343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) and affinity capture precipitation assays (12.Sako D. Comess K.M. Barone K.M. Camphausen R.T. Cumming D.A. Shaw G.D. Cell. 1995; 83: 323-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Soluble Ig chimeras containing various lengths of the NH2 terminus of PSGL-1 bound fluid-phase P-selectin in affinity capture assays when immobilized on Protein A beads. Cells expressing P-selectin also adhered to plates coated with the Ig chimeras under static conditions. In both assays, however, binding of the smallest Ig chimera containing the first 19 residues of fully processed PSGL-1 (residues 42–60) to P-selectin appeared to be reduced compared with that of longer constructs (12.Sako D. Comess K.M. Barone K.M. Camphausen R.T. Cumming D.A. Shaw G.D. Cell. 1995; 83: 323-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Appendage of amino acid residues 38–57 to CD43, a membrane-bound sialomucin, promoted cell adhesion to immobilized P-selectin (13.Pouyani T. Seed B. Cell. 1995; 83: 333-343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). In contrast with these results, it was recently reported that mutation of the single extracellular Cys residue in the context of full-length PSGL-1 prevents dimerization and eliminates binding of PSGL-1 to P-selectin in both flow cytometric and cell adhesion assays (18.Fujimoto T. Noda M. Takafuta T. Shimomura T. Fujimura K. Kuramoto A. Int. J. Hematol. 1996; 64: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 19.Snapp K.R. Craig R. Herron M. Nelson R.D. Stoolman L.M. Kansas G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Based on these studies it was proposed that only covalently dimerized forms of PSGL-1 can bind to P-selectin. However, we recently generated a series of semi-synthetic, monomeric glycosulfopeptides based on the NH2-terminal region of human PSGL-1 (24.Leppänen A. Mehta P. Ouyang Y-B. Ju T. Helin J. Moore K.L. van Die I. Canfield W.M. McEver R.P. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24838-24848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and tested them for their binding to P-selectin. The results demonstrated that a glycosulfopeptide containing 3 Tyr-SO3− residues and a core-2 based O-glycan expressing the sLexantigen binds P-selectin with an affinity equivalent to that of the native, dimeric PSGL-1 from human neutrophils (20.Mehta P. Cummings R.D. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32506-32513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 24.Leppänen A. Mehta P. Ouyang Y-B. Ju T. Helin J.

Here we report our studies on the factors controlling dimerization of membrane PSGL-1 and our re-examination of the issue of whether monomeric forms of PSGL-1 can bind to P-selectin. Our results confirm that the Cys residue at position 320 in full-length PSGL-1 is required for covalent dimerization. However, recombinant forms of the full-length PSGL-1 in which Cys320 has been mutated to either Ser or Ala retain the ability to bind P-selectin in either fluid-phase binding assays or in cell adhesion assays under shear conditions. Unexpectedly, these mutated forms of PSGL-1 efficiently associate noncovalently in the membrane and chemical cross-linking generates dimeric species. Replacement of the transmembrane domain in PSGL-1 with that of CD43 generated a recombinant form of PSGL-1 that no longer self-associates in the membrane, but is able to support P-selectin binding. Proteolytic cleavage of membrane native and recombinant PSGL-1 generated small glycosulfopeptides derived from the NH2 terminus of PSGL-1 that retain high affinity binding to P-selectin. Taken together, the results demonstrate that dimerization of membrane PSGL-1 is not required for P-selectin binding.

The 3.5-kb and 1187-bp AvrII-EcoNI bands were gel purified. The 3.5-kbAvrII-EcoNI band was stored for later use. The 1187-bp AvrII-EcoNI band was further digested with BsmI, and the 912-bp AvrII-BsmI band was gel purified. The 275-bp BsmI-EcoNI PCR product containing the C320S mutation was then ligated to theAvrII-BsmI 912-bp PSGL-1/pZeoSV fragment. The resultant AvrII-EcoNI 1187-bp C320S fragment was then ligated into the 3.5-kb PSGL-1/pZeoSVAvrII-EcoNI fragment to form C320S-PSGL-1/pZeoSV. C320A-PSGL-1/pZeoSV (Fig. 1) was made using the strategy employed for C320S with the following changes: primer 2 (antisense, C320A mutation): CCAGCAGTGCCTGCTTCACAG; primer 3 (sense, C320A mutation): CTGTGAAGCAGGCACTGCTGGCCAT; PCR 3.

An annealing temperature of 61 °C was used in the PCR. The 288-bp PCR product was gel purified and digested with BsmI and EcoNI. The resultant BsmI-EcoNI 275-bp fragment containing the S304A mutation was gel purified and inserted into PSGL-1/pZeoSV exactly as described above for the C320S construct to generate the S304A-PSGL-1/pZeoSV construct.

Thirty cycles of amplification were performed with an annealing temperature of 61 °C. The 284-bp PCR product was gel purified using phenol:chloroform extraction. PCR 3, primers 5 and 6 were used with PSGL-1/pZeoSV as the template. The PCR reaction was carried out as in PCR 1, and the 171-bp PCR product was gel purified. PCR 4, primers 3 and 6 were used with the annealed products of PCR 2 and PCR 3 as the template. An annealing temperature of 62 °C was used in the PCR.

After incubation of the ligation mixture at 16 °C for 2 h, the 3.5-kb fragment ofAvrII/KpnI-digested pZeoSV was added and ligation was allowed to continue overnight to generate the T67A, S113A, S304A-PSGL-1/pZeoSV construct, which we designated ΔN-PSGL-1/pZeoSV. CD43TMD-PSGL-1/pZeoSV (Fig. 5A) was made using the following overlapping PCR strategy: primer 1 (sense, BsmI site), CTCTGTTACTCACAAGGGCATTC; primer 2 (antisense, 5′CD43TMD/3′PSGL-1 chimera), CACTGGCAGCATCTTCACAGAGATGTGGTCTGGG; primer 3 (sense, 5′CD43TMD/3′PSGL-1 chimera), CTGCTCCTGCTGTGGCGCCTCTCCCGCAAGGGCCA; primer 4 (antisense, EcoNI site), GCTTGGCCTTGGACAGGCCCCCATTGGCTGTGGCAGAGG; primer 5 (sense, 5′PSGl-1/3′CD43TMD chimera), CATCTCTGTGAAGATGCTGCCAGTGGCTGTGCTTG; primer 6 (antisense, 5′PSGL-1/3′CD43TMD chimera), TGCGGGAGAGGCGCCACAGCAGGAGCAGAGCCACG. A small extracellular region of PSGL-1 immediately adjacent to the TMD was amplified. The sense primer (primer 1) is homologous to a region just upstream of the PSGL-1 TMD and contains theBsmI restriction site, thus defining the extracellular region of PSGL-1 to be manipulated. The chimeric antisense primer (primer 2) contains sequence encoding amino-terminal residues of the CD43 TMD at its 5′ end, thus incorporating the proper splice junction between the extracellular residues of PSGL-1 adjacent to the TMD and the new CD43-based TMD into the PCR product. Primers 1 and 2 were used with PSGL-1/pZeoSV as the template. An annealing temperature of 55 °C was used. The 101-bp product was gel purified. In a similar manner, the cytoplasmic region of PSGL-1 adjacent to the TMD was amplified using a chimeric sense primer (primer 3) containing sequence encoding carboxyl-terminal residues of the CD43 TMD at its 5′ end. The antisense primer (primer 4) is homologous to a region just downstream of the PSGL-1 TMD and contains theEcoNI restriction site, thus defining the extent of the cytoplasmic region of PSGL-1 to be manipulated. Primers 3 and 4 were used with PSGL-1/pZeoSV as the template and an annealing temperature of 72 °C. The 159-bp product was gel-purified. The TMD of CD43 was amplified using chimeric sense and antisense primers that contained 5′ sequence encoding the residues which encompass the TMD of PSGL-1. Primers 5 and 6 were used with CD43/pBKEF as the template and an annealing temperature of 68 °C. The program included a 1o/4-s slope in the transition from annealing to extension temperature (72 °C). The 97-bp product was gel-purified. The 3 purified PCR products were mixed together in 1× PCR buffer with 1.25 mm dNTPs and Pfu polymerase. They were allowed to denature for 3 min, anneal at 62 °C for 1 min, and extend at 72 °C for 10-min in order to generate the chimeric template. Primers 1 and 4 were added after the extension period and amplification was performed with an annealing temperature of 62 °C. The 301-bp product was gel purified and digested with BsmI andEcoNI. The resultant 269-bp BsmI-EcoNI product was gel-purified and ligated into PSGL-1/pZeoSV following the strategy outlined for C320S-PSGL-1/pZeoSV. After restriction enzyme screening, several potential clones were sequenced. All of the clones had correct splice sites at the PSGL-1/CD43 TMD junctions, but the internal portion of the CD43 TMD was not correct due to mispriming of primer 5. Fortunately, the incorrect sequence was flanked byAlwNI and NarI sites, so the following strategy was used to fix the sequence: CD43/pBKEF was digested withAlwNI and NarI, and the 55-bpAlwNI-NarI fragment encoding the internal portion of the CD43 TMD was gel purified and saved for later use. The partial CD43TMD-PSGL-1/pZeoSV clone (pCD43TMD-PSGL-1/pZeoSV) was digested withAlwNI to generate two species. The 3674-bpAlwNI-AlwNI product containing the bulk of the pZeoSV vector and the sequence encoding the extracellular domain of PSGL-1 up to the AlwNI site in the CD43 TMD was stored for later use.

Previously, we showed that both estrogens and retinoids regulated osteoclastic bone resorption and postulated that such regulation was directly mediated through their cognate receptors expressed in mature osteoclasts. In this study, we searched for expression of other members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily in osteoclasts. Using the low stringency homologous hybridization method, we isolated the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ/β (PPARδ/β) cDNA from mature rabbit osteoclasts. Northern blot analysis showed that PPARδ/β mRNA was highly expressed in highly enriched rabbit osteoclasts. Carbaprostacyclin, a prostacyclin analogue known to be a ligand for PPARδ/β, significantly induced both bone-resorbing activities of isolated mature rabbit osteoclasts and mRNA expression of the cathepsin K, carbonic anhydrase type II, and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase genes in these cells. Moreover, the carbaprostacyclin-induced bone resorption was completely blocked by an antisense phosphothiorate oligodeoxynucleotide of PPARδ/β but not by the sense phosphothiorate oligodeoxynucleotide of the same DNA sequence. Our results suggest that PPARδ/β may be involved in direct modulation of osteoclastic bone resorption. Osteoclasts modulate bone resorption under physiological and pathological conditions.

These cells are characterized by a combination of some unique properties. They possess tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)1 activity, an abundance of cathepsin K, and highly developed ion transport systems (1.Teitelbaum S.L. Abu-Amer Y. Ross F.P. J. Cell.

Mature osteoclasts are involved in bone metabolism, especially they resorb mineralized bone surfaces under both physiological and pathological conditions (3.Erlebacher A. Filvaroff E.H. Gitelman S.E. Derynck R. Cell. 1995; 80: 371-378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Much evidence obtained from in vitro studies has demonstrated that the differentiation of osteoclasts is controlled by various factors, such as vitamin D3, osteoclast differentiation factor, osteoclastogenesis inhibitory factor, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and parathyroid hormone (4.Yasuda H.

The osteoclast is also active in postmenopausal osteoporosis (bone loss), a major health problem (2.Rifkin B.R. Gay C.V. Biology and Physiology of the Osteoclast. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992Google Scholar). Estrogen deficiency has long been recognized as a cause of postmenopausal osteoporosis, and estrogen replacement therapy is an effective treatment for the prevention of bone loss. Research has shown that estrogen loss promotes interleukin-6 secretion in nonosteoclastic cells and that interleukin-6 up-regulates osteoclast differentiation and formation (8.Pacifici R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 1043-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 9.Poli V. Balena R. Fattori E. Markatos A. Yamamoto M. Tanaka H. Ciliberto G. Rodan G.A. Costantini F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1189-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). However, the function and metabolism of fully mature osteoclasts remain unclear, especially at the molecular level, because of the difficulty in obtaining large quantities of highly enriched osteoclasts for use in such in vitro studies. For assessment of the bone-resorbing activity of mature osteoclasts, it would be desirable to have a cell suspension consisting of highly enriched mature osteoclasts that could be cultured on a mineralized substratum such as a bone or dentine slice. Previously, we succeeded in isolating the highly enriched mature osteoclasts by treating unfractionated rabbit bone cells cultured on plastic dishes with Pronase E/EDTA (10.Tezuka K. Sato T. Kamioka H. Nijweide P.J. Tanaka K. Matsuo T. Ohta M. Kurihara N. Hakeda Y. Kumegawa M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). However, it was impossible to detach these isolated osteoclasts from the substratum in order to prepare the cell suspension. Recently, we established a method to isolate mature rabbit osteoclasts with high purity (>99%) from a collagen gel to obtain them in suspension form for subsequent incubation on dentine slices (11.Kakudo S. Miyazawa K. Kameda T. Mano H. Mori Y. Yuasa T. Nakamaru Y. Shiokawa M. Nagahira K. Tokunaga S. Hakeda Y. Kumegawa M. J. Bone Miner. Metab. 1996; 14: 129-136Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Using these highly enriched mature osteoclasts, we clarified that estrogen directly inhibited bone resorption and cathepsin K gene expression and induced osteoclastic apoptosis through estrogen receptor α (12.Mano H. Yuasa T. Kameda T. Miyazawa K. Nakamaru Y. Shiokawa M. Mori Y. Yamada T. Miyata K. Shindo H. Azuma H. Hakeda Y. Kumegawa M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Kumegawa M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Moreover, we demonstrated that retinoids activated both osteoclastic bone resorption and gene expression of cathepsin K, and of retinoic acid receptor α and retinoid X receptor β were expressed in mature osteoclasts (14.Saneshige S. Mano H. Tezuka K. Kakudo S. Mori Y. Honda Y. Itabashi A. Yamada T. Miyata K. Hakeda Y. Ishii J. Kumegawa M. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 721-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Receptors for steroid hormones, retinoids, vitamin D, thyroid hormone, and prostanoids comprise a superfamily of regulatory proteins that are structurally and functionally related. Previous studies showed that members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily shared high homology in their amino acid sequences, with the highest homology conserved among their DNA binding domains. Nuclear hormone receptors bind to cis-acting elements in the promoters of their target genes and modulate gene expression in response to their ligands (15.Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M.

Molecular cloning studies revealed both new nuclear receptors and orphan nuclear receptors, the natural ligands of which remain unclear. These findings suggest potentially novel signal pathways in the body (17.Blumberg B. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3149-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In order to examine the possibility of such a novel signal pathway in mature osteoclasts, we screened for nuclear hormone receptors in a rabbit mature osteoclast cDNA library by taking advantage of the structural homology of the DNA-binding domain of nuclear receptors. Thereby, the rabbit cDNA of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) δ/β was cloned from this cDNA library. PPAR is known to be activated by arachidonic metabolites. Three types of PPAR are now known to exist, i.e. PPARα, PPARγ, and PPARδ/β. PPARα is abundantly expressed in liver tissue and is activated by leukotriene B4 (18.Devchand P.R. Keller H. Peters J.M. Vazquez M. Gonzalez F.J. Wahli W. Nature. 1996; 384: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar). PPARγ is abundantly expressed in adipose tissue and is activated by 15-deoxy-prostaglandin J2, 9- and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid, and thiazolidinediones (19.Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2721) Google Scholar, 20.Nagy L. Tontonoz P. Alvarez J.G. Chen H. Evans R.M. Cell. 1998; 93: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar). The distribution of PPARδ/β mRNA is the most widespread, and prostacyclin and its analogues activate PPARδ/β (21.Hertz R. Berman I. Keppler D. Bar-Tana J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 22.Kliewer S.A. Forman B.M. Blumberg B. Ong E.S. Borgmeyer U. Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7355-7359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). Although PPARγ plays a principal role in adipogenesis, it is unclear what functions PPARα and PPARδ/β have in the body. Here we demonstrate the abundant expression of PPARδ/β mRNA in mature osteoclasts and the activation of osteoclastic functions such as bone resorption and osteoclastic gene expression by a ligand of PPARδ/β. Moreover, antisense S-ODN for PPARδ/β blocked this activation in mature osteoclasts. These results suggest that in part PPARδ/β plays a role in osteoclastic bone resorption. Unfractionated bone cells were isolated from tibiae, femora, humeri, ulnae, and radii of 10-day-old rabbits. After the removal of soft tissues, these bones were minced in α-minimum essential medium (α-MEM). Cells were dissociated from the bone fragments by sedimentation under normal gravity for 1 min. The supernatant was used as unfractionated bone cells (crude osteoclasts). These cells were plated in 10-cm tissue culture dishes coated with 0.24% collagen gel (Nitta Gelatin, Tokyo, Japan) in α-MEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and incubated for 3 h. Nonosteoclastic cells were then removed from the gel by sequential treatment with 0.001% Pronase E, 0.02% EDTA, and 0.01% collagenase. The remaining osteoclasts were subsequently collected by treatment with 0.1% collagenase. After having been washed with calcium- and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the isolated osteoclasts were replated onto dentine slices in phenol red-free α-MEM supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin for generating cDNA libraries and used in the pit assay (11.Kakudo S. Miyazawa K. Kameda T. Mano H. Mori Y. Yuasa T. Nakamaru Y. Shiokawa M. Nagahira K. Tokunaga S. Hakeda Y. Kumegawa M. J. Bone Miner. Metab. 1996; 14: 129-136Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The purity of the isolated osteoclasts was confirmed by microscopic scoring of TRAP-positive multinucleate cells in the presence of 50 mml-tartrate with a leukocyte-acid-phosphatase kit (Sigma). When TRAP-positive multinucleate cells isolated from collagen gels were placed on dentine slices, they showed a compact and round shape, and the morphology of the cells resembled that of osteoclasts in vivo more than the cells cultured on plastic plates (10.Tezuka K. Sato T. Kamioka H. Nijweide P.J. Tanaka K. Matsuo T. Ohta M. Kurihara N. Hakeda Y. Kumegawa M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). These TRAP-positive multinucleate cells (100 cells/culture drop) were cultured in tissue-culture dishes for 7 days to assess formation of colonies of nonosteoclastic stromal cells. Only 0.4 ± 0.49 (n = 5) colonies were formed per culture drop after a 1-week culture. Thus, the purity of the TRAP-positive multinucleate cells was more than 99%. When these cells were cultured on dentine slices, resorption pits were formed around these cells as observed under a scanning electron microscope. Transmission electron microscopic observation revealed a ruffled border-like membrane and clear zone on the side of these cells attached to the surface of the dentine. Thus, cells isolated from collagen gels exhibited the typical morphology of authentic osteoclasts, and the multinucleate cells had the ability to excavate dentine even when stromal cells were absent from the culture. These TRAP-positive multinucleate cells were indeed mature osteoclasts (data not shown). Total RNA of mature rabbit osteoclasts cultured on dentine slices was isolated by the acid guanidium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method, and the poly(A)+ RNA was purified by using an oligo(dT) cellulose column. The cDNA library was synthesized by using a ZAP II-cDNA Synthesis Kit (Stratagene). An EcoT14I–HindIII DNA fragment containing the DNA-binding domain of the human estrogen receptor α (ATCC, Manassas, VA) was used as a probe to screen the ZAP II rabbit mature osteoclast cDNA library under low stringency conditions. Positive clones were sequenced by the dideoxy sequencing method (23.Tezuka K. Tezukam Y. Maejima A. Sato T. Nemoto K. Kamioka H. Hakeda Y. Kumegawa M. J. Biol.

To determine the bone-resorbing activity of the isolated mature osteoclasts, we measured the area and number of resorption pits formed on dentine slices by them. Briefly, isolated osteoclasts were plated on dentine slices (circular, 6 mm in diameter) in 96-well plates at a density of 150 isolated osteoclasts/slice/well and cultured for 1 h in phenol red-free α-MEM supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin at 37 °C in 10% CO2. The medium was then replaced with fresh medium containing various concentrations of any given reagent and cultured for 20 h (25.Takada Y. Kusuda M. Hiura K. Sato T. Mochizuki H. Nagao Y. Tomura M. Yahiro M. Hakeda Y. Kawashima H. Kumegawa M. Bone Miner. 1992; 17: 347-359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The dentine slices were then brushed with a rubber policeman to remove the cells and stained with acid hematoxylin for 5 min. The total number of pits on a dentine slice was counted under a light microscope, and the total area of pits was quantified by densitometric analysis of dentine slice images by videomicroscopy and using of NIH Image software (25.Takada Y. Kusuda M. Hiura K. Sato T. Mochizuki H. Nagao Y. Tomura M. Yahiro M. Hakeda Y. Kawashima H. Kumegawa M. Bone Miner. 1992; 17: 347-359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Antisense or sense S-ODNs of PPARδ/β were used to transfect mature osteoclasts by the method of Inui et al. (26.Inui T. Ishibashi O. Inaoka T. Origane Y. Kumegawa M. Kokubo T. Yamamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8109-8112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The PPARδ/β antisense S-ODN was designed to be composed of 21 bases and to target the region that spans the translation start codon of rabbit PPARδ/β mRNA (5′-cggaggctgctccatggctga-3′). The sense counter part of the antisense S-ODN was also designed as a negative control (5′-tcagccatggagcagcctccg-3′). All of these S-ODNs were synthesized (Nippon Flour Mills Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) on an automated solid-phase nucleotide synthesizer and subsequently purified and sterilized. A fraction of the synthesized S-ODNs was labeled with fluorescein at the 5′-ends, in order to confirm the efficiency of S-ODN uptake into mature osteoclasts. Mature rabbit osteoclasts isolated by the method described above were incubated at 37 °C in 10% CO2 on dentine slices at a concentration of 150 osteoclasts/dentine slice in 96-well tissue culture plates in the presence or absence of carbaprostacyclin (10−8m) (Cayman Chemical Company) in α-MEN containing 5% FBS. After a 2-h incubation, the medium was exchanged for the transfection medium, and the cells were incubated in the presence or absence of carbaprostacyclin (10−8m) and in the presence or absence of the antisense or sense S-ODNs in serum-free α-MEM containing 100 nmTfxTM-50 (Promega, Madison, WI). After an 8-h incubation, the medium in each well was exchanged for the identical medium except that the α-MEM now contained 5% FBS, and the incubation was then continued for an additional 12 h. After the incubation, the pit number and area were determined. Unfractionated bone cells were plated into 90-mm tissue culture dishes with α-MEM plus 5% FBS at 108 cells/dish. After an overnight culture period, the plates were washed with PBS to remove nonadherent cells such as hematopoietic cells. The cells were then incubated with PBS containing 0.001% Pronase E, 0.02% EDTA for 20 min at 37 °C to remove nonosteoclastic cells. These detached nonosteoclastic cells were saved as the source of stromal cells. The purity of the osteoclasts in the dishes was more than 99%. Isolated osteoclasts on the tissue culture dishes were cultured with carbaprostacyclin (1 × 10−8m) for 5 h in α-MEM containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for the study of target gene expression elicited by prostacyclin. Other cells were cultured on dishes with antisense or sense S-ODNs and 100 nm Tfx-50 (Promega, WI) as a carrier for 20 h in α-MEM containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for the study of the effect of S-ODN. The total RNA was extracted from the cultured cells by the acid guanidinium-phenol-chloroform method. Total RNA was fractionated on a formaldehyde agarose gel by electrophoresis and then blotted onto a nylon membrane for Northern blot analysis (14.Saneshige S. Mano H. Tezuka K. Kakudo S. Mori Y. Honda Y. Itabashi A. Yamada T. Miyata K. Hakeda Y. Ishii J. Kumegawa M. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 721-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).32P-Labeled cDNA probes were prepared by the random primer labeling procedure. The cDNAs of rabbit cathepsin K, carbonic anhydrase type II, TARP, and matrix metalloproteinase 9 from osteoclast cDNA library were used as hybridization probes (23.Tezuka K. Tezukam Y. Maejima A.

Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 459-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The mouse IP, membrane prostacyclin receptor, cDNA was obtained from S. Narumiya (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan). The cDNAs of mouse PPARs were a gift from R. M. Evans (The Salk Institute). A rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe was used as a reference. A 480-base pair cDNA fragment containing the human estrogen receptor α DNA binding domain was used to screen the rabbit mature osteoclast cDNA library. Positive clones were isolated for sequence analyses. Fig. 1 Ashows the nucleotide and the deduced amino acid sequences of a positive clone, ROCHER10. It contained a 3.4-kb insert with an open reading frame of 1323 base pairs, encoding a polypeptide of 441 amino acids. Sequence comparison of ROCHER10 against the GenBankTM data base showed that ROCHER10 was most closely related to the PPARδ/β gene with a 94.8% overall identity to human PPARδ/β, and 89.6%, and 90.5% overall identities to the rat and mouse PPARδ/β, respectively (Fig. 1 B). ROCHER10 shared distant homologies of 67.1, 63.0, 64.6, and 62.9% to the human PPARα, human PPARγ, mouse PPARα, and mouse PPARγ, respectively. Thus, we concluded that clone ROCHER10 represented the rabbit PPARδ/β gene. Next, we examined the mRNA expression levels of PPAR isoforms in rabbit bone cells and mouse clonal osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells by Northern blot analysis using the rabbit PPARδ/β cDNA, mouse PPARα, and mouse PPARγ cDNA as probes (Fig.2). A 3.5-kb PPARδ/β mRNA transcript was detected in MC3T3-E1 cells, rabbit stromal cells, and mature osteoclasts. The expression level of PPARδ/β mRNA was most abundant in mature osteoclasts. Similar results were obtained when a mouse PPARδ/β cDNA probe was used instead (data not shown). Conversely, no PPARα or PPARγ mRNA expression was detectable in mature osteoclasts and stromal cells, whereas weak expression of PPARα (8.5-kb) mRNA was detected in MC3T3-E1 cells. The unique expression patterns of the PPAR isoforms in bone cells suggest that whereas PPARδ/β may play a direct role in modulating mature osteoclasts, the PPARα isoform may have specific functions in other cell systems in bone. With the abundant expression of PPARδ/β in mature osteoclasts, we postulated that ligands of PPARδ/β may play a role in regulating osteoclastic cell function. Thus, we treated highly enriched mature osteoclasts with carbaprostacyclin, a prostacyclin analogue, and tested them in the osteoclastic resorption pit assay. As shown in Fig.3, 10−9 to 10−8m carbaprostacyclin induced an increase to approximately 2-fold greater pit area excavated by highly enriched mature osteoclasts on dentine slices. These concentrations of carbaprostacyclin did not significantly affect the number of pits excavated. In contrast, a high dose of carbaprostacyclin (10−5m) decreased the pit area excavated by mature osteoclasts. 10−7m leukotriene B4, an agonist of both PPARα and its own plasma membrane receptor, induced a 1.5-fold greater pit area. WY-14643, a strong agonist of both PPARα and PPARγ, did not affect osteoclastic bone resorption significantly. Cathepsin K and matrix metalloproteinase 9 are proteases whose function is to break down bone matrix proteins, and the carbonic anhydrase type II gene product produces [H+] to dissolve mineralized bone matrix. TRAP is an osteoclast marker whose function in bone metabolism remains to be further defined. To examine whether a PPARδ/β ligand would regulate the expression of genes related to osteoclastic bone resorption, we treated highly enriched mature osteoclasts on plastic culture dishes with carbaprostacyclin (1 × 10−8m) for 5 h. Total RNA was extracted from these cells, and mRNA levels of cathepsin K, carbonic anhydrase type II, TRAP, and matrix metalloproteinase 9 were determined by Northern blot analysis. Fig. 4 shows that carbaprostacyclin increased the mRNA level of cathepsin K, carbonic anhydrase type II, and TRAP but not that of matrix metalloproteinase 9 in the mature osteoclasts. This ligand doubled the mRNA level of cathepsin K and tripled the mRNA levels of carbonic anhydrase type II and TRAP in the cells. However, the mRNA level of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was constant in the osteoclasts treated with carbaprostacyclin. To establish a direct role of PPARδ/β in carbaprostacyclin-induced osteoclastic bone resorption, we included an antisense S-ODN of PPARδ/β in the pit assay. S-ODN uptake by osteoclasts was confirmed by incubating the cells for 24 h at 37 °C with fluorescein-labeled cathepsin K-antisense S-ODN in the culture medium in the presence of Tfx-50 (data not shown; Ref. 26.Inui T. Ishibashi O. Inaoka T. Origane Y. Kumegawa M. Kokubo T. Yamamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8109-8112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The carbaprostacyclin-induced increase in pit area was completely blocked by 5–20 μm antisense S-ODN of PPARδ/β (Fig.5 A). Even 20 μmsense PPARδ/β S-ODN could not inhibit the increase in pit area caused by carbaprostacyclin. Neither of the S-ODNs for PPARδ/β affected the number of pits on the dentine slices in either control or carbaprostacyclin-treated cultures (Fig. 5 B). To confirm that the antisense S-ODN of PPARδ/β reduced the endogenous level of PPARδ/β expression, we analyzed the PPARδ/β mRNA expression level in osteoclasts by Northern blotting. Fig.6 shows that antisense S-ODN for PPARδ/β reduced the mRNA level of PPARδ/β in mature osteoclasts cultured on plastic dishes. In contrast, the sense S-ODN for PPARδ/β had no effect (data not shown). Prostacyclin also acts through its plasma membrane receptor, IP. To eliminate the involvement of IP in activation of osteoclast functions by prostacyclin, we checked the expression of IP mRNA in the cells. Fig. 7 shows that the typical size (3.5 kb) of IP mRNA was expressed in osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 and stromal cells but not in the osteoclasts and that small (about 2 kb) and smear transcripts were detected in all cell types. We cloned the full-length cDNA of rabbit PPARδ/β from a mature osteoclast cDNA library. Both the amino acid sequence and the mRNA transcript sizes of the rabbit PPARδ/β were highly conserved with their human and rodent counterparts. Although previous reports showed that PPARδ/β mRNA was widely expressed in mouse organs (22.Kliewer S.A. Forman B.M. Blumberg B. Ong E.S. Borgmeyer U. Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7355-7359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar), until now it was unclear whether PPAR mRNA was expressed in bone tissue. Our data show that PPARδ/β was more abundantly expressed in mature osteoclasts than in osteoblasts and stromal cells, whereas PPARα mRNA was expressed only in the clonal osteoblastic cells. This cell-specific expression of PPARs in bone cells may suggest a specific role of each PPAR in a given type of bone cells. It is clear that PPARs are activated by arachidonic acid metabolites such as prostacyclin (prostaglandin I2) and its analogues,i.e. carbaprostacyclin and iloprost (21.Hertz R. Berman I. Keppler D. Bar-Tana J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The metabolites produced from arachidonic acid, such as leukotriene and prostaglandin, have complex actions affecting bone metabolism (28.Donahue H.J. Rifkin B.R. Gay C.V. Biology and Physiology of the Osteoclast. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 207-222Google Scholar, 29.Klein D.C. Raisz L. Endocrinology. 1970; 86: 1436-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). Leukotriene B4, which is one of the 5-lipoxygenase metabolites, directly activates the bone resorption activity in rat, mouse, and chicken osteoclasts (30.Flynn M.A. Qiao M. Garcia C. Dallas M. Bonewald L.F. Calcif. Tissue. Int. 1999; 64: 154-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 31.Garcia C. Boyce B.F. Gilles J. Dallas M. Qiao M. Mundy G.R. Bonewald L.F. J. Bone Miner.

Chem. 1993; 268: 10087-10094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our data show that mature rabbit osteoclasts also were activated by leukotriene B4 but that nuclear leukotriene B4 receptor (PPARα) mRNA was not detected in mature rabbit osteoclasts by Northern blot analysis. However, it was reported that leukotriene B4 binding, which is considered to reflect the leukotriene B4 receptor, occurred in mature chicken osteoclasts (30.Flynn M.A. Qiao M. Garcia C. Dallas M. Bonewald L.F. Calcif. Tissue. Int. 1999; 64: 154-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These data suggest that leukotriene B4 activates osteoclast function through its membrane receptor. Leukotriene B4 also inactivates osteoblast-mediated bone formation (34.Traianedes K. Dallas M.R. Garrett I.R. Mundy G.R. Bonewald L.F. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3178-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, 5-lipoxygenase metabolites appear to down-regulate bone formation. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which is one of the prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase metabolites, has paradoxical functions in osteoclasts. PGE2 directly inhibits bone-resorbing activity in rabbit and rat mature osteoclasts (35.Chambers T.J. McSheehy P.M. Thomson B.M. Fuller K. Endocrinology. 1985; 116: 234-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 36.Adebanjo O.A. Pazianas M. Zaidi A. Shankar V.S. Bascal Z.A. Dacke C.G. Huang C.L. Zaidi M.J. Endocrinology. 1994; 143: 375-381Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). On the other hand, PGE2 indirectly activates osteoclastic bone resorption through accessory cells, such as osteoblasts and stromal cells. Moreover, PGE2 activates mouse osteoclast differentiation (37.Tokushima T. Sato T. Morita I. Murota S. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 433: 307-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 38.Sato T.

Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1476-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These paradoxical functions of PGE2 may be due to variations in experimental conditions, such as the presence of accessory cells, difference in species of osteoclasts, and differences in the differentiation stage of the osteoclasts (40.Lader C.S. Flanagan A.M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3157-3164Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 41.Collins D.A. Chambers T.J. J. Bone Miner.

Reszka A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Previously, it was reported that prostacyclin activated osteoclastic bone resorption through accessory cells in calvaria cultures (44.Walenga R.W. Bergstrom W. Prostaglandins. 1985; 29: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a millimolar level of prostacyclin inhibited the pit formation by mature osteoclasts (35.Chambers T.J. McSheehy P.M. Thomson B.M. Fuller K. Endocrinology. 1985; 116: 234-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Moreover, a high concentration (2.5 × 10−5m) of prostacyclin reduced osteoclastic motility and cell size, whereas low concentrations (1.5 × 10−7m) increased osteoclast motility and cell size in isolated mature osteoclasts (36.Adebanjo O.A. Pazianas M. Zaidi A. Shankar V.S. Bascal Z.A. Dacke C.G. Huang C.L. Zaidi M.J. Endocrinology. 1994; 143: 375-381Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Also, our results show that 1 × 10−5mcarbaprostacyclin inhibited bone resorption by mature osteoclasts but that 1 × 10−9 to 1 × 10−8m carbaprostacyclin activated the cells. These results indicate a differential effect of various levels of prostacyclin on mature osteoclasts. These may be due to the action of more than one type of receptor for prostacyclin in osteoclasts. It is reported that prostacyclin exerts its function through a nuclear receptor (PPARδ/β) and a membrane receptor (IP) (21.Hertz R. Berman I. Keppler D. Bar-Tana J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 45.Namba T. Oida H. Sugimoto Y. Kakizuka A. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9986-9992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The plasma membrane receptor for prostacyclin, IP, is abundantly expressed in thymus, lung, heart, and spleen (45.Namba T. Oida H. Sugimoto Y. Kakizuka A. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9986-9992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46.Boie Y. Rushmore T.H. Darmon-Goodwin A. Grygorczyk R. Slipetz D.M. Metters K.M. Abramovitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12173-12178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our present study, typical IP mRNA could not be detected in mature rabbit osteoclasts by Northern blot analysis. These results suggest the possibility of the existence of some other types of membrane receptor and/or nuclear receptor for prostacyclin in mature rabbit osteoclast to response to a high concentration of prostacyclin. We clearly showed that antisense S-ODN for PPARδ/β blocked the induction of osteoclastic bone resorption by carbaprostacyclin. However, antisense and sense S-ODN for PPARδ/β or carbaprostacyclin did not affect pit formation number on dentine slice. These data indicate that S-ODN for PPARδ/β does not have any toxic effect on mature osteoclasts in the concentrations used. We can thus conclude that PPARδ/β has a role in regulation of osteoclast function through prostacyclin. This conclusion is also supported by the data showing that antisense S-ODN for PPARδ/β reduced the level of PPARδ/β mRNA in osteoclasts and that carbaprostacyclin stimulated an increase in the mRNA levels of several osteoclastic genes. One of the PPAR subtypes, PPARγ, has been implicated as a mediator of adipocyte and monocyte/macrophage differentiation (47.Manolagas S.C.

Also, it was reported that osteoclasts are differentiated from blood stem cells, especially those of the monocyte/macrophage lineage (1.Teitelbaum S.L. Abu-Amer Y. Ross F.P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 59: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 2.Rifkin B.R. Gay C.V. Biology and Physiology of the Osteoclast. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992Google Scholar, 3.Erlebacher A. Filvaroff E.H. Gitelman S.E. Derynck R. Cell. 1995; 80: 371-378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). The transcriptional factor c-Fos mediates osteoclast differentiation but not macrophage differentiation (51.Grigoriadis A.E. Wang Z.Q. Cecchini M.G. Hofstetter W. Felix R. Fleisch H.A. Wagner E.F. Science. 1994; 266: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Another transcriptional factor, PU. 1, mediates both osteoclast and macrophage differentiation (52.Tondravi M.M. McKercher S.R. Anderson K. Erdmann J.M. Quiroz M. Maki R. Teitelbaum S.L. Nature. 1997; 386: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). We cannot exclude the possibility that PPARs play a critical role in osteoclastogenesis, because we used only mature osteoclasts in all of our studies. Our data indicate that PPARδ/β mRNA but not IP mRNA is abundantly expressed in mature osteoclasts and that a prostacyclin analogue induced osteoclastic bone resorption in vitro. In addition, the results of antisense S-ODN analysis support the involvement of PPARδ/β in prostacyclin-induced osteoclastic bone resorption. These data suggest that, in part, the bone loss mediated by prostacyclin, a metabolite of arachidonic acid, is modulated by PPARδ/β in mature osteoclasts. We express our gratitude to Dr. Na N. Yang (Lilly) for useful comments on the manuscript and to Y. Katagiri and S. Ishii for technical assistance. We also thank Drs. M. Kobori (Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd) and H. Kawashima (Nigata University) for the generous gift of rabbit TRAP cDNA."

Most are exported from cells by means of a classical amino-terminal signal sequence that is cleaved from the mature protein during its passage through the secretory pathway. Fibroblast growth factor-9 (Fgf-9) does not contain a recognizable signal sequence, although it is efficiently secreted. In this study, we show that Fgf-9 enters the endoplasmic reticulum and traverses the Golgi complex in a similar manner to other constitutively secreted proteins. Deletion and point mutation analysis has revealed an atypical non-cleaved signal sequence within the amino-terminal region of Fgf-9. Moreover, the first 28 amino acids of Fgf-9 can function as an efficient non-cleaved signal peptide when appended to the amino terminus of green fluorescent protein.

Moscatelli D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1992; 59: 115-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar, 2.McKeehan W.L. Wang F. Kan M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 59: 135-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). In addition to acting as mitogens for a wide spectrum of cell types, they can also act to promote cell migration, induce or inhibit cell differentiation. In vivo, Fgf signaling has been implicated in many aspects of animal development, from myoblast migration in Caenorhabditis elegans to a range of inductive and patterning roles in mammals (3.DeVore D.L. Horvitz H.R. Stern M.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 611-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 4.Yamaguchi T.P. Rossant J. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1995; 5: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In humans, genetic linkage analysis has implicated three members of the Fgf receptor gene family as the underlying cause of several skeletal dysplasias and autosomal dominant craniosynostosis syndromes (5.DeMoerlooze L. Dickson C. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1997; 7: 378-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In adult mammals, Fgfs are involved in wound healing and can act as potent factors in angiogenesis, whereas their inappropriate expression has been associated with proliferative disorders such as cancer. Many members of the Fgf family possess a classical amino-terminal signal sequence for export through the constitutive secretory pathway that includes the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi complex/trans-Golgi network. However, two notable exceptions are Fgf-1 and Fgf-2 that are located both in the cytoplasm and nucleus (6.Renko M. Quarto N. Morimoto T. Rifkin D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 144: 108-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 7.Bugler B. Amalric F. Prats H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 573-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 8.Zhan X. Hu X.G. Friedman S. MacIag T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 982-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic forms of these Fgfs appear to be secreted by novel mechanisms (9.LaVallee T.M. Tarantini F. Gamble S. Carreira C.M. Jackson A. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22217-22223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 10.Florkiewicz R.Z. Anchin J. Baird A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 22209-22216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Fgf-3 is also unusual in that it is not only secreted but also an extended uncleaved form is localized in the cell nucleus (12.Acland P. Dixon M. Peters G. Dickson C. Nature. 1990; 343: 662-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In this example the dual subcellular localization appears to be the result of competition between a weak classical signal peptide and an adjacent nuclear localization signal (13.Kiefer P. Acland P. Pappin D. Peters G. Dickson C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4126-4136Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Other exceptions are Fgf-11 to Fgf-14 (also known as FGF homologous factors 1 to 4) that represent a less closely conserved group found predominantly in fetal and adult brain, where they reside primarily as nuclear proteins (14.Smallwood P.M. Munozsanjuan I. Tong P. MacKe J.P. Hendry S.H.C. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9850-9857Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Fgf-9 was discovered as a secreted factor from a glioma cell line and originally named glia-activating factor (15.Miyamoto M. Naruo K. Seko C. Matsumoto S. Kondo T. Kurokawa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4251-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Expression of Fgf-9 in cell culture demonstrated that it was glycosylated and efficiently secreted, although sequencing of the major secreted isoform showed it had only lost the amino-terminal methionine from the primary translation product (15.Miyamoto M. Naruo K. Seko C. Matsumoto S. Kondo T. Kurokawa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4251-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 16.Song J. Slack J.M.W. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 206: 427-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Despite its secretion and glycosylation, the amino-terminal domain of Fgf-9 is mildly hydrophobic and does not demonstrate the expected characteristics of a signal peptide (Fig.1 A). More recently Fgf-16 has been identified and shown to be closely related to Fgf-9 on the basis of its primary sequence, and like Fgf-9 it too is secreted although lacking a classical signal sequence (17.Miyake A. Konishi M. Martin F.H. Hernday N.A. Ozaki K. Yamamoto S. Mikami T. Arakawa T. Itoh N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Thus it would seem that this family of highly related proteins has evolved or acquired a diverse set of signals for their export from cells. In this report we have analyzed the sequences involved in the secretion of Fgf-9, and we show there is a non-cleaved signal sequence in the amino-terminal domain that directs protein into the constitutive secretory pathway. The mouse Fgf-9 coding sequence was generated by reverse transcriptase-PCR from adult mouse brain RNA. The primers were chosen from the rat Fgf-9 sequence (15.Miyamoto M. Naruo K. Seko C. Matsumoto S. Kondo T. Kurokawa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4251-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The forward primer was GGGATCCCATGGCTCCCTTAGGTGAAGT including a BamHI site (underlined), and the reverse primer was GGAATTCTCAGCTTTGGCTTAGAATATCC including an EcoRI site (underlined). The PCR was performed with 4 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 53 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min followed by 25 cycles with an annealing temperature of 58 °C. The PCR fragment that was identical to the sequence previously published (18.Hecht D. Zimmerman N. Bedford M. Avivi A. Yayon A. Growth Factors. 1995; 12: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) was cloned into pCDNA3 vector (Invitrogen), as were all subsequent modified mFGF9 cDNAs. Amino-terminal truncations, internal deletions, and point mutations of the mFgf-9 cDNA sequence were generated by PCR (Pfupolymerase, Stratagene), and the resulting mutations were confirmed by sequencing. The amino-terminal deletions were constructed using the same 3′ oligonucleotide primer, GCGAATTCGCTCAGCTTTGGCTTAGAATATCCTTAT, (EcoRI site underlined) and unique 5′ primers for each mutant, containing a unique BamHI site (underlined) to facilitate subsequent manipulation. The 5′ primers were as follows: mFGF9Δ6, CGCGGATCCGCATGGGGAGCTATTTCGGTGTGC; mFGF9Δ12, CGCGGATCCGCATGCAGGACGCGGTACCGTT; mFGF9Δ19, CGCGGATCCGCATGGGGAACGTACCGGTGTTG; mFGF9Δ22, CGCGGATCCGCATGGTGTTGCCGGTGGACAGTCC; mFGF9Δ26, CGCGGATCCGCATGGACAGTCCGGTGTTGCT; mFGF9Δ37, CGCGGATCCGCATGGGTCAGTCCGAAGCAGGG. The sequences of the mutants are schematically depicted in Fig. 3. For the internal deletion mutants, mFGF9Δ20-52 and mFGF9Δ28-52, a two-step cloning strategy was used. The 3′ portion of both mutants encompassed residues 52 to the carboxyl terminus (forward primer, GCAGTCACGGAATTCGATCATTTA/reverse primer, GCTCTAGAGCTCAGCTTTGGCTTAGAATATCCTTAT). AnEcoRI site (underlined) in the forward primer was introduced to facilitate cloning. The 5′ regions of these mutants were generated using a forward primer with a BamHI site (underlined), CGCGGATCCGCGATGGCTCCCTTAGGTGAAGTTGG, and the reverse primers, CGGGAATTCCACCGGCAACACC and CACCGGTACGAATTCGAACGGTACCGC for mFGF9Δ28-52 and mFGF9Δ20-52, respectively. The underlined EcoRI site allowed joining of the 5′ and 3′ domains. In positions 52 and 53 the EcoRI site made the conservative amino acid changes from DL to EF. For the point mutants mFGF9G20K, mFGF9V22K, and mFGF9G20K/V22K, the same 5′-oligonucleotide containing a BamHI site was used CGCGGATCCGCGATGGCTCCCTTAGGTGAAGTTGG together with the following reverse primers: mFGF9G20K, ATGATCGAATTCCACCGGCAACACCGGTACGTTCTTGAACGGTAC; mFGF9V22K, ATGATCGAATTCCACCGGCAACACCGGTTTGTTCCCGAACGGTAC; mFGF9G20K/V22K, ATGATCGAATTCCACCGGCAACACCGGTTTGTTCTTGAACGGTAC. The PCR products were used to replace the amino-terminal sequences in mFGF9Δ20–52. To construct the mFGF9-GFP chimera a two-step strategy was used. The GFP from the vector pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH) was amplified by PCR using the following oligonucleotides: forward primer AAAGGAGAAGAATTCTTCACTGGA/reverse primer GCTCTAGAGCCTAGAAGCTTTTGTATAGTTCATCCATGC. The forward primer lacks the ATG codon and includes an in-frameEcoRI site (underlined). The reverse primer contains anXbaI site (underlined) adjacent to the translational stop codon (bold). The EcoRI/XbaI-digested PCR product was cloned into the mFGF9Δ28-52 construct after the 3′ portion of Fgf-9 (residues 52 to the carboxyl terminus) had been removed. The resulting construct (FGF9GFP) contains a cDNA encoding the first 28 amino acids of Fgf-9 fused in-frame to enhanced GFP. A vector (GFP) with the enhanced GFP under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter was used as a control. COS-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% newborn calf serum. The cells were transiently transfected with 4 μg of different plasmid DNA constructs using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). In some experiments, tunicamycin was used at 10 μg/ml (Calbiochem) and was added on day 1 after transfection. Cell extracts were prepared by lysis in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40) at 4 °C for 30 min, passing the cells through a 23-gauge needle followed by one cycle of freezing/thawing. Cell extracts and cell supernatants obtained by centrifugation were incubated with heparin-Sepharose beads overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), twice with buffer IV (see under “Immunoprecipitation (Pulse-Chase Experiment”), and suspended in Laemmli buffer. The eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (12.5% gels) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Protran, Schleicher & Schuell). After blocking with 5% fat-free milk powder in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 (3 h at room temperature). The membranes were incubated overnight with the relevant antibodies at 4 °C, washed in PBS containing 5% milk powder, and the bound antibodies revealed with peroxidase-conjugated affinity purified F(ab′)2 fragment of donkey anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Thirty six hours after transfection, subconfluent cell cultures were washed and incubated for 45 min in serum-free DMEM lacking methionine and cysteine. This was then replaced by 1 ml of the same medium but containing 200 μCi of [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine (1000 Ci/mm, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were labeled for 30 min at 37 °C, washed twice with cold DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum, and chased with 1 ml of DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum for the times indicated. At each time point protein extracts from cell supernatants and cell pellets were prepared in RIPA buffer. Samples were precleared 45 min at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose beads and then with protein A-Sepharose bound with rabbit anti-FGF9 (Prepotech) overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed once in buffer I (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% bovine serum albumin), twice in buffer II (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.2% bovine serum albumin), twice in buffer III (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.2% bovine serum albumin), and twice in buffer IV (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). All buffers were at 4 °C. After SDS-PAGE, gels were fixed (acetic acid:ethanol:water, 10:10:80) for 30 min, washed with water for 30 min, treated with Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and dried. Radioactivity was detected by autoradiography and quantified using a PhosphorImager (Storm 860, Molecular Dynamics). For the immunoprecipitation of GFP, a rabbit antiserum to GFP was used in the same procedure (19.Sawin K. Hajibagheri M. Nurse P. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1335-1338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), but the radioactivity was detected by autoradiography. Forty eight hours post-transfection, cells grown on coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (10 min at room temperature), permeabilized with PBS Triton X-100 (6 min), and incubated 1 h with a 1 in 100 dilution of a rabbit anti-FGF9 serum or with a 1 in 50 dilution of a monoclonal mouse anti-Golgi-58K antibody (Sigma). After washing, cells were incubated 30 min with either rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:100) or fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1 (1:100) and mounted in Mowiol (Calbiochem). Second antibodies with fluorescent labels were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Confocal microscopic analysis of FGF9, Golgi-58K, mFGF9-GFP, and GFP proteins was performed using a Zeiss confocal microscope (LSM 510 invert). Cells were optically sectioned in the xy plane (parallel to the substratum) using a × 63 NA1.4 objective and minimum slice thickness of 1 μm, with multiple scan averaging. Simultaneous two-channel recording was performed using excitation wavelengths of 488/543 nm, a 515–525 band pass fluorescein isothiocyanate filter together with a 570-nm pass filter. C57MG mouse mammary epithelial cells were grown in 48-well tissue culture dishes in DMEM containing 10% newborn calf serum and assayed for mitogenicity as described (30.Keifer P. Mathieu M. Close M. Peters G. Dickson C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4159-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The FGF9 proteins used in this assay were produced using an in vitro translation assay kit (TNT Coupled Reticulocytes Lysates Systems, Promega). For each protein tested, 10 μl of its in vitro translate was added directly to the quiescent cells in 0.5 ml of culture medium. Experiments were performed in duplicate using duplicate cultures (n = 4). Recombinant Fgf-9 at 50 ng/ml (Peprotech) and 10% serum were used as positive controls in the assay. Previous studies have shown that the major Fgf-9 form is a secreted glycoprotein of 30 kDa (15.Miyamoto M. Naruo K. Seko C. Matsumoto S. Kondo T. Kurokawa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4251-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). To confirm these findings mouse Fgf-9 was expressed in COS-1 cells. Immunoblotting revealed a major secreted band in COS-1 cell supernatants corresponding to the predicted size of 30 kDa with a smaller, less intense 27-kDa band. By comparison only very small amounts of similarly sized proteins were detected in the cell extracts (Fig. 1 B). In the presence of tunicamycin, the secreted and cell-associated Fgf-9 protein migrated on SDS-PAGE as a single band of 27 kDa (Fig. 1 B), consistent with the inhibition of N-linked glycosylation on the single predicted consensus site (Fig. 1 A). To establish directly the subcellular location of Fgf-9, transfected COS-1 cells were analyzed for Fgf-9 and the Golgi 58K protein by immunofluorescence. Faint reticular staining over the cytoplasm and strong perinuclear staining was observed for Fgf-9, whereas the Golgi 58K protein gave the expected peri-nuclear staining characteristic of the Golgi complex (Fig. 2, A and B). Combination of the two optical sections and the phase contrast image clearly demonstrates a predominant co-localization of the two proteins and confirms that Fgf-9 is associated with the Golgi complex and therefore enters the constitutive secretory pathway (Fig.2 D). Analysis of the primary protein sequence of Fgf-9 using a computer-based program failed to identify a candidate signal peptide region (Ref. 20.Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 12: 3-9Crossref Scopus (535) Google Scholar and data not shown). In the amino-terminal 60 amino acid residues there are two peaks of weak hydrophobic character within the first 35 residues followed by a weak hydrophilic region (Fig.1 A). In contrast, a typical signal sequence usually shows a strong hydrophobic region at the amino terminus. The remaining portion of Fgf-9 essentially constitutes a highly conserved region shared by other Fgfs. To determine whether the amino terminus was necessary for secretion, we generated a series of deletions by progressively removing sequences from the 5′ end of the Fgf-9 cDNA, while retaining a 5′-methionine codon to allow translational initiation (Fig.3 A). After transfection of COS-1 cells with these deletion mutants, the amount of Fgf-9 proteins in the cells and supernatants was determined by immunoblotting (Fig.3 B). The degree of N-linked glycosylation was also assessed by comparison with similar extracts prepared from cells grown in the presence of tunicamycin. As N-linked glycosylation only occurs in the ER, this provides evidence for export of the mutant proteins through the secretory pathway. Deletion of the first 6 amino acids caused a profound reduction in the overall level of Fgf-9 synthesis, as can be seen by comparing expression from the full-length cDNA to other deletion mutants (Fig. 3 B). However, despite an overall reduction in yield, a significant proportion of Fgf-9 protein was glycosylated and exported. A similar result was also obtained for FGF9Δ12 expression. Removal of 19 amino acids (FGF9Δ19) also resulted in a secreted and glycosylated Fgf-9, but most of the protein remained cell-associated and non-glycosylated. After removal of 22 amino acids (FGF9Δ22) only a small amount of the truncated Fgf-9 was secreted, and most of this was not glycosylated. Deletions of 26 and 37 amino acids from the amino terminus resulted in a single non-secreted and non-glycosylated product. To gain further insight into the processing of the various amino-terminal deletion mutants, appropriately transfected COS-1 cells were analyzed by immunofluorescent microscopy. As already shown above (Fig. 2), wild-type Fgf-9 was almost entirely associated with the Golgi complex (Fig. 4, A–D). The 12 amino acid deletion mutant (FGF9Δ12) also showed clear staining of the Golgi as well as staining of the cytoplasm (Fig. 4,E–H). For the mutant FGF9Δ19, there was still staining of the Golgi but the cytoplasmic staining predominated, whereas the FGF9Δ37 showed no co-localization with the Golgi marker and relatively even staining throughout the cell (Fig. 4, I–Land M–P, respectively). Hence, the increasing amounts of non-glycosylated protein were associated with the progressive amino-terminal deletion of Fgf-9 and were paralleled by the presence of increasing amounts of cytoplasmic protein (compare Figs. 3 and 4). To examine the efficiency of export and stability of Fgf-9, a moderately secreted mutant (FGF9Δ19) and a non-secreted mutant (FGF9Δ37) were studied along with the full-length protein. Cultures of appropriately transfected COS-1 cells were pulsed with radiolabeled methionine and chased up to 6 h (Fig. 5). After 30 min of chase, approximately 50% of the labeled wild-type protein was detected in the supernatant, and nearly all the cell-associated protein was glycosylated, indicating that most had entered the secretory pathway. Subsequently, the proportion of extracellular Fgf-9 increased at the expense of the cell-associated protein, and by 6 h more than 80% of the labeled protein had been secreted. By comparison, the truncated FGF9Δ19 protein although glycosylated was secreted less efficiently (Fig. 5), and immunofluorescent staining (Fig. 3) showed that some protein remained in the cytoplasm and was probably never exported. This would also explain the low level of cell-associated glycosylated Fgf-9Δ19 throughout the chase period. The non-secreted mutant protein (FGF9Δ37) showed a small amount of non-glycosylated protein in the medium probably arising from a small amount of cell lysis. From these experiments it would seem that native Fgf-9 is very efficiently secreted. Moreover, the proportion of FGF9Δ19 protein that enters the secretory pathway is also rapidly exported since there is no intracellular accumulation of its glycosylated form. It was possible that the more extensive truncations of Fgf-9 were not secreted because of incorrect folding of the mutant proteins that may have compromised the function of the signal sequence or caused the protein to be re-routed to the lysosomes. As an indirect assessment of correct folding, we used a mitogenicity assay as a sensitive assessment of biological activity. Recombinant proteins from cell-free transcription/translation reactions were tested directly in a thymidine incorporation assay to measure their ability to induce DNA synthesis. All the mutant proteins, including those that were not exported from cells, were biologically active, indicating that even severely truncated proteins are functional and therefore retain their tertiary structure (Fig. 6). To define more precisely the sequences responsible for Fgf-9 secretion, internal deletion mutants of the amino-terminal region were tested for their ability to be N-glycosylated and exported. As proteins with deletions of up to 19 amino acids from the amino terminus were still glycosylated and secreted, whereas those with deletions of more than 26 amino acids were intracellular and cytoplasmic, it was anticipated that the core of the cryptic signal peptide would not reside in the first 19 amino acids. To investigate whether sequences downstream of amino acid 19 would function as a signal sequence, internal deletions of amino acids 28–52 and 20–52 were generated as shown (Fig.7 A). The smaller deletion (FGF9Δ28–52) was secreted as efficiently as wild-type Fgf-9, more surprisingly the larger deletion (FGF9Δ20–52) was also secreted, although it was less efficiently synthesized and the product poorly glycosylated. Nevertheless, considerably more Fgf-9 mutant protein accumulated in the supernatant than was found in the cell (Fig.7 B). This would suggest that the amino acid sequences between 28 and 52 are not necessary for secretion, whereas those upstream of position 28 are required for efficient secretion. However, proteins with deletions up to amino acid 19 can still enter the secretory pathway, albeit very inefficiently, suggesting that the long moderately hydrophobic sequence covering the amino-terminal region of the protein must be redundant in its ability to act as a signal peptide. To determine whether it was important for secretion that the region located toward the center of the domain was hydrophobic, the glycine at residue 20 and the valine at residue 22 were mutated to lysine as single mutations and as the double mutant on a FGF9Δ28–52 background. The two point mutations resulted in proteins that were efficiently secreted, whereas the double point mutation was secreted, but to a lower efficiency, suggesting that neither position was critical, but a significant decrease in hydrophobicity diminished the efficiency of secretion. To determine whether the amino-terminal sequences of Fgf-9 are sufficient to act as an efficient signal sequence, they were joined to a heterologous protein that normally resides in the cytoplasm and nucleus. DNA encoding the amino-terminal 28 amino acids of Fgf-9 was joined to a cDNA encoding a GFP open reading frame. The GFP provided a marker that could be directly and easily detected in cells. In initial experiments, appropriately transfected COS-1 cells were labeled overnight with [35S]methionine, and it was observed that virtually all the labeled FGF9-GFP hybrid protein was exported from the cell (Fig.8 A). In control cultures, GFP was distributed between the cell extract and supernatant. The appearance of GFP in the cell supernatant was expected as expression of GFP in these cells caused a significant amount of cell death as indicated by numerous floating cells at the time of processing. The toxicity associated with expressing GFP in cell culture has been reported by others (21.Liu H. Jan M. Chou C. Ke N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 712-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Interestingly, no toxicity was observed for FGF9GFP expressing COS-1 cells, perhaps reflecting a change in the intracellular trafficking route. To determine whether the hybrid protein was secreted without cleavage of the signal sequence, its size was compared with the primary translation product synthesized in vitro. The two proteins from in vivo and in vitro sources were indistinguishable by SDS-PAGE, indicating that the signal sequence was not cleaved and behaves in a similar fashion when joined to GFP as in its normal context (Fig. 8 B). To determine directly whether the efficient export of FGF9GFP was due to its redirection into the secretory pathway, we utilized the autofluorescence of GFP to examine the subcellular distribution of the control and hybrid protein. Fluorescence microscopy showed that GFP resided throughout the cell in a pattern that demonstrated both a cytoplasmic and nuclear distribution (Fig.9, A–D). In contrast FGF9GFP showed a clear perinuclear staining that was coincident with Golgi staining (Fig. 9, E–H). The low intensity of staining reflects its efficient export (Fig. 8 A). Taken together, these finding show that the first 28 amino acids of Fgf-9 can act as an efficient non-cleaved signal sequence for the export of a heterologous protein.Figure 9Subcellular localization of GFP and FGF9GFP by fluorescence microscopy.

Although many members of the Fgf family contain a classical amino-terminal signal sequence, Fgf-1 and Fgf-2 do not and appear to be primarily located in the cytoplasm and cell nucleus. However, they are also exported by novel mechanisms that bypass the constitutive secretory pathway (6.Renko M. Quarto N. Morimoto T. Rifkin D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 144: 108-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 7.Bugler B. Amalric F. Prats H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 573-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 8.Zhan X.

Chem. 1998; 273: 22209-22216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Another anomaly concerns Fgf-3 that not only encodes a signal sequence but also a nuclear import signal (12.Acland P. Dixon M. Peters G. Dickson C. Nature. 1990; 343: 662-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). These act in competition with each other giving rise to dual intracellular location of the proteins (13.Kiefer P. Acland P. Pappin D. Peters G. Dickson C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4126-4136Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). More recently Fgf-9 and Fgf-16, which share a high degree of sequence conservation (73% homology), were shown to be secreted efficiently despite the lack of a signal sequence for secretion (15.Miyamoto M. Naruo K. Seko C. Matsumoto S. Kondo T. Kurokawa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4251-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 17.Miyake A. Konishi M. Martin F.H. Hernday N.A. Ozaki K. Yamamoto S. Mikami T. Arakawa T. Itoh N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Moreover, the secreted form of Fgf-9 retains its amino-terminal region, apart from the initiating methionine. In the study reported here, we show that the weakly hydrophobic sequences contained in the first 28 residues of Fgf-9 are sufficient when fused to GFP to function as a non-cleaved signal peptide. However, a deletion analysis of the amino-terminal region of Fgf-9 indicates that the amino acids further downstream can functionally compensate for loss of the immediate amino-terminal residues, suggesting that both hydrophobic domains in the amino-terminal domain can form part of a signal sequence. This is suggested by the finding that deletion of up to 22 amino-terminal residues still gives rise to a secreted protein, although the efficiency of export gets progressively worse with increasing size of the deletion (Figs. 3 and 4). Moreover, an internal deletion removing amino acids 20–52 reduces but does not abolish glycosylation and secretion of the protein (Fig. 7). However, the residues at the immediate amino terminus of Fgf-9 are required for its very efficient secretion, and an internal deletion of residues 28–52 had no significant effect on its secretion efficiency. Together these results suggest that the first 28 amino acids encompass the bona fide signal sequence, a finding supported by the efficient export of FGF9GFP. The identification of a weakly hydrophobic sequence that confers secretory properties upon a protein is unusual but not unique (22.Kalies K.-U. Hartmann E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Two other known examples are ovalbumin and plasminogen-activator inhibitor type 2 (PAI-2) which are both members of the serpin family. Although ovalbumin is an efficiently secreted protein, there is disagreement about the location of the amino acid residues important for its secretion (23.Tabe L. Krieg P. Strachan R. Jackson D. Wallis E. Colman A. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 180: 645-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 24.Lingappa V. Lingappa J. Blobel G. Nature. 1979; 281: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In one study amino acids 231–279 from ovalbumin were shown to compete with authentic signal sequences for entry into microsomes in vitro, whereas another study implicated amino acids 22–41 as sufficient for translocating a heterologous protein across the ER membrane of Xenopus oocytes. The protease inhibitor PAI-2 has a non-glycosylated cytoplasmic form and a secreted form that is glycosylated (25.Genton C. Kruithof E. Schleuning W. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 705-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 26.Wohlwend A. Belin D. Vassalli J. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 320-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The signal sequence of PAI-2 is composed of two hydrophobic domains located near the amino terminus (27.von Heijne G. Liljestrom P. Mikus P. Andersson H. Ny T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15240-15243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It would appear that both hydrophobic domains are necessary for ER import, a process that can be improved by increasing the hydrophobicity of either domain. However, although the overall characteristics of the Fgf-9 signal sequence are similar to that of PAI-2, its export appears to be much more efficient. At present it is not clear if the non-cleaved signal sequence of Fgf-9 is part of an in vivo regulatory mechanism that determines whether and when the protein is secreted from cells. For example, PAI-2 is not secreted efficiently from U-937 cells until they are stimulated with phorbol ester, suggesting that the atypical signal sequence may serve some regulatory role (28.Ye R. Wun T.-C. Sadler J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4869-4875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, the amino-terminal residues may contribute to the biological properties of Fgf-9, which requires their retention in the mature protein. During the preparation of this manuscript another study on the secretion of Fgf-9 reported that the internal hydrophobic region, located around amino acid 100 (see Fig. 1 A), was crucial for Fgf-9 secretion and acted as an internal signal sequence (29.Miyakawa K. Hatsuzawa K. Kurokawa T. Asada M. Kuroiwa T. Imamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29352-29357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In this study the main observation was that deletion of 90 amino acids from the start of Fgf-9, which leaves its central hydrophobic domain at the amino terminus, yielded a polypeptide that was translocated into microsomes and that deletion or point mutation of the central hydrophobic region abolished Fgf-9 secretion. However, the subcellular location of these mutant proteins was not determined. The conclusions from their work are that the central hydrophobic region is crucial for translocation but that the amino-terminal sequences also make a contribution. The different conclusions deduced from our study and that of Miyakawa et al. (29.Miyakawa K. Hatsuzawa K. Kurokawa T. Asada M. Kuroiwa T. Imamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29352-29357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) probably reflect both differences in methodology and interpretation. In our study we show that the amino-terminal 28 amino acids of Fgf-9 can act as an efficient non-cleaved signal sequence in its natural context, as well as when joined to the amino terminus of a heterologous protein. We thank John Sgouros for help with the computer analyses, Kenneth Sawin for generously providing the antiserum to GFP, and Vera Fantl and Sharon Tooze for helpful comments on the manuscript."

The rat 5-HT1A receptor gene is regulated by a proximal TATA-driven promoter and by upstream repressors that inhibit gene expression. Deletion of a 71-base pair (bp) segment between −1590/−1519 bp of the 5-HT1A receptor gene induced over 10-fold enhancement of transcriptional activity in both 5-HT1A receptor-expressing (RN46A raphe and SN48 septal) cells and receptor-negative (L6 myoblast and C6 glioma) cells. A 31-bp segment of the repressor was protected from DNase I digestion by RN46A or L6 nuclear extracts. Within the 31-bp segment, a single protein complex was present in receptor-expressing cells that bound a novel 14-bp DNA element; in receptor-negative cells, an additional complex bound an adjacent 12-bp sequence. In receptor-positive but not receptor-negative cells, mutation of the 14-bp element to eliminate protein binding abrogated repression to nearly the same extent as deletion of the −1590/−1519 bp segment. Additional mutation of both 14-bp and 12-bp elements abolished protein binding and repressor activity in receptor-negative cells. Thus a single protein-DNA complex at the 14-bp element represses the 5-HT1A receptor gene in 5-HT1A receptor-positive neuronal cells, whereas adjacent DNA elements provide a dual repression mechanism in 5-HT1A receptor-negative cells.

Activation of postsynaptic receptors in the above regions is associated with serotonergic regulation of memory, motivation, emotion, neuroendocrine stress response, etc. (2.Hoyer D. Clarke D.E.

The prolonged (2–3 week) time course required for antidepressant action suggests an alteration in transcriptional activity of the 5-HT1A receptor. To investigate the mechanisms that regulate cell-specific and basal regulation of the 5-HT1A receptor, we have identified the transcriptional start site and examined the regulation of the transcriptional activity of a 2.719-kb1 fragment of the rat 5-HT1A receptor gene in several cell lines, including 5-HT1A receptor-positive RN46A raphe and SN48 septal cells (18.Charest A.

Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2238-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We identified a region of the rat 5-HT1A receptor gene located upstream of an ubiquitously active promoter region that reduces transcriptional activity. In the present study, we have identified a 14-bp element in the 5′-flanking region of the 5-HT1A gene that mediates transcriptional repression in raphe cells, but is dispensable in receptor-negative cells where an adjacent 12-bp element maintains repression of the gene. In contrast to the single repressor-DNA complex present in 5-HT1A receptor-expressing cells that may modulate basal levels of receptor expression, the presence of two protein-DNA complexes in receptor-negative cell lines provides a dual mechanism to repress 5-HT1A receptor expression. The 2.7-kb fragment of rat 5-HT1A receptor promoter-luciferase pGL3-Basic (Promega, Madison, WI) reporter construct (−2719 (21.Storring J.M. Charest A. Cheng P. Albert P.R. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2238-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar)) was digested with XbaI to generate a plasmid that was ligated internally with a 1.590-kb 5-HT1A gene fragment (−1590) containing 71 bp from the repressor region (between −1519 and −1590) and two other resultant fragments of 0.4 and 0.8 kb, respectively. The −1590 construct was digested with SmaI and ligated internally to obtain construct −1519, which lacks the repressor segment. To obtain constructs of −2300 and −2300/−1519, the fragment of 0.8 kb was ligated with −1590 and −1519 constructs, respectively. All of the constructs were verified by dideoxynucleotide DNA sequencing. The −2300 mutations were made by site-specific mutagenesis of the −2300 sequence contained in the pGL3-Basic plasmid using a mutagenesis kit (U.S.E., Pharmacia Biotech, Milwaukee, WI). Three mutants (designated −2300 m1, −2300 m2, and −2300 m3) were made to incorporate the nucleotide substitutions (underlined in Table I) in the mut14, mut12, and mut14 + mut12 electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) primers (Table I,lanes 4 and 8) using the oligonucleotides listed in Table I (lanes 5, 9, and 10, respectively). The nucleotide substitutions preserved the nucleotide content, but were found to interfere with protein binding to the 31-bp element (−1555/−1524). The resulting plasmids were verified by dideoxynucleotide DNA sequencing.Table ISequences of the proximal repressor element of the rat 5-HT1A receptor promoter and other fragments involved in band-shift assays and mutagenesisSequence location and nameDNA sequence1. −1555/−1524 (31 bp)5′-CGGCATAAGCAAGCCCTTATTGCACAGAGCT-3′2. −1532/−1517 (15 bp)5′-ACAGAGCTGTCCCGG-3′3. −1554/−1540 (14 bp)5′-GGCATAAGCAAGCC-3′4. −1554/−1540 (mut14)5′-GGACATAGAGCACC-3′5. −1555/−1524 (31-bp m1)5′-CGGACATAGAGCACCCTTATTGCACAGAGCT-3′6. −1557/−1537 (mut21)5′-GGCGGCATAGAACAGCCCTTA-3′7. −1543/−1532 (12 bp)5′-GCCCTTATTGCA-3′8. −1543/−1532 (mut12)5′-GCCCTTTGTACA-3′9. −1555/−1524 (31-bp m2)5′-CGGCATAAGCAAGCCCTTTGTACACAGAGCT-3′10. −1555/−1524 (31-bp m3)5′-CGGACATAGAGCACCCTTTGTACACAGAGCT-3′11.

Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2 except for the RN46A cell line, which was maintained in Neurobasal medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 33 °C in 5% CO2. All cell lines were grown to 50–60% confluence, and the media were replaced 12 h before transfection. Cells were transfected transiently by calcium phosphate coprecipitation (18.Charest A. Wainer B.H. Albert P.R. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 5164-5171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using 20 μg/plate of luciferase constructs and 10 mg/plate of pCMV-lacZII plasmid (ATCC) except for RN46A cells. RN46A cells were transfected in 3.5-cm Primaria 6-well plates (Falcon, Franklin Lakes, NJ) using 1.5 μg/plate luciferase plasmid and 0.5 μg/plate pCMV-lacZII with 12 μg/plate pFx-7 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) at 33 °C for 8 h and harvested at 48 h following transfection (21.Storring J.M. Charest A. Cheng P. Albert P.R. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2238-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). All plasmids used for transfection were purified using columns (Maxiprep, Qiagen, Inc., Chatsworth, CA) and quantified by spectrophotometric analysis and by ethidium bromide staining. Cells were extracted with 100 μl/well of Reporter lysis buffer (Promega), and the supernatants were collected and assayed for luciferase activity using a Promega luciferase assay system using a luminometer (model 1250, BioOrbit, Finland). To correct for variations in transfection efficiency, plasmid pCMV-lacZII was cotransfected with each luciferase reporter construct. A portion of the harvested cell extract (10%) was assayed for β-galactosidase activity based on the conversion of 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-galactoside (Sigma) to the highly fluorescent molecule methylumbelliferone and quantitated using a Perkin-Elmer LS50 spectrofluorometer, at 350-nm excitation and 450-nm emission. The ratio of luciferase to β-galactosidase activity was determined in triplicate samples and normalized to vector-transfected extracts. All data are presented as the mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments normalized to pGL3-Basic activity. The −1590 construct was digested with MluI. The resulting linear DNA was end-labeled using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase and 3000 Ci/mmol [α-32P]dCTP. Labeled DNA was digested withHpaI to generate a 208-bp fragment, which was purified on an agarose gel. The 60-μl reactions contained 20,000 cpm of labeled probe, 3 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 30 μg of nuclear extract from RN46A and L6 cells in binding buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, and 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.9 and were incubated for 25 min at room temperature. Following incubation samples were digested with DNase I (Pharmacia) for 2 min at room temperature with addition of 15 μg of yeast tRNA to stop the reaction. After phenol/chloroform extraction, samples were resuspended in formamide/dye solution and electrophoresed through 6% polyacrylamide/urea gel. Total nuclear protein for all extracts was quantitated according to the Bradford method with bovine serum albumin as standard. Complementary oligonucleotides with 5′ overhangs were designed according to the nucleotide sequence of the proximal repressor region of the 5-HT1A receptor gene (see Table I) and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase. Nuclear extract (15 μg/sample) was preincubated with or without competitor DNA in a 20-μl reaction containing DNA binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 100 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 5% glycerol, and 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.9) and 3 μg of poly(dI-dC) at room temperature for 25 min.32P-Labeled probe (50,000 cpm/sample) was added and incubated for an additional 20 min at room temperature. The reaction was separated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel at 4 °C. The gels were dried and then exposed to film overnight at −80 °C with an intensifying screen. Transcription of the rat 5-HT1A receptor gene is initiated at a major start site located −967 bp upstream from the translational initiation ATG sequence and is regulated by a TATA-containing promoter/enhancer region between −1519 and −967 bp (21.Storring J.M. Charest A. Cheng P. Albert P.R. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2238-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A region of strong repressor activity is located upstream from this promoter. To identify specific gene regulatory elements, a series of finer deletions of the rat 5-HT1A receptor gene fused to the luciferase reporter gene were transfected in 5-HT1A receptor-positive rat raphe RN46A and receptor-negative rat L6 myoblast cell cultures and the relative luciferase activity was quantitated (Fig.1). Luciferase activities of the 2300-luciferase gene were 5.66 ± 0.49- and 4.6 ± 0.36-fold basal in RN46A and L6 cells, respectively. The results show that the 5′ region of the 5-HT1A receptor gene contains a negative regulatory region between −1519 and −1590 bp. Specific deletion of the putative repressor region between −1590/−1519 in the 2300/1519-luciferase construct revealed a striking increase in luciferase activity that attained 47.5 ± 6.6- and 52.2 ± 7.2-fold basal in RN46A and L6 cells, respectively, which represents an enhancement of over 10-fold compared with the −2300 construct. This result indicates the presence of a strong repressor activity between −1590/−1519 bp that inhibits the activity of the 5-HT1A receptor gene. The 1590-luciferase construct displayed weak luciferase activity that was 1- to 1.5-fold basal, suggesting the presence of enhancer elements between −2300 and −1590 bp. Luciferase activity of the 5-HT1A receptor gene was markedly enhanced in the 1519-luciferase construct to 6.2 ± 0.45- and 5.1 ± 0.58-fold basal in RN46A cells and L6 cells, respectively. Therefore, upon removal of the −1590/−1519 region in the −2300/−1519 or −1519 constructs, the 5-HT1A promoter was derepressed compared with the −2300 and −1590 constructs, respectively. To determine whether nuclear proteins interact with specific sequences within the proximal repressive element (−1590/−1519 bp), DNase I protection and EMSA were conducted. For the DNase I protection assay a 208-bp fragment that contained the 71-bp sequence between −1590 and −1519 was end-labeled and incubated with nuclear proteins prepared from L6 and RN46A cells. A discrete segment spanning from −1524 to −1555 bp of the 5-HT1A receptor gene was protected from DNase I digestion at low but not high concentrations of DNase I (Fig. 2). The protected region was similar for nuclear extracts from both RN46A cells and L6 cells. The sequence of this 31-bp region (TableI, lane 1) did not match known DNA elements and therefore may correspond to a novel element. To further investigate the DNA binding activities of proteins from RN46A and L6 cells, double-stranded 31-bp oligonucleotides were designed according to the nucleotide sequence of the segment of the 5-HT1A repressor that exhibited a clear DNase I footprint (−1555/−1524 bp; Table I). The 31-bp probe was labeled and incubated with nuclear protein extracts from RN46A and L6 cells and examined by EMSA. A single specific protein complex was identified from RN46A extracts that was competed by excess unlabeled oligonucleotide but was not displaced by the unrelated E2F binding site sequence (Fig.3 A). This specific interaction provides further evidence that the 31-bp segment spanning from −1524 to −1555 is recognized by a nuclear protein or protein complex from RN46A cells. To further localize the site of protein binding, competition experiments were done using double-stranded oligonucleotides targeted within the 31-bp segment (Table I). The 15-bp segment (Fig. 3 B) competed weakly for the protein binding site of the 31-bp oligonucleotide, whereas the 14-bp primer competed as effectively as the unlabeled 31-bp primer to eliminate protein binding to the labeled 31-bp oligonucleotide (Fig. 3 C). Thus the DNA element bound by RN46A proteins is located primarily in the region −1554/−1540 bp upstream from the translational start site. Because no consensus DNA element has been found so far, this 14-bp element may represent a novel protein interaction site. To examine whether the same protein complex was present in L6 myoblasts, EMSA was performed using nuclear extracts from L6 and RN46A cells and the 31-bp oligonucleotide as probe (Fig.4 A). Interestingly, the L6 lanes displayed two nuclear protein complexes: the lower complex had an identical migration to that in the RN46A extracts, whereas the upper complex was not detected in RN46A extracts. The 14-bp primer was equally effective in competition of the lower protein complex but was relatively ineffective in competing with the upper complex. The 14-bp oligonucleotide was labeled and used as a probe to conduct the EMSA using protein extracts from both the RN46A and L6 cell lines (Fig.4 B). One specific band was detected in both L6 and RN46A cells and was competed by the unlabeled 14-bp oligonucleotide. This result indicates that the 14-bp element is essential and sufficient for DNA binding of an identical regulatory protein complex from both RN46A cells and L6 cells (the lower complex, Fig. 4 A). However, the upper complex is absent from RN46A cells and represents protein binding to an adjacent site on the 31-bp probe, because it is weakly competed for by the 14-bp primer and does not bind to the labeled 14-bp primer. Thus nuclear proteins from L6 cells bind to the two adjacent complexes, one of which is identical to the raphe RN46A nuclear complex. To generate inactivating mutations of the 14-bp element, two mutants within the −1554/−1540-bp region (mut21 and mut14, Table I) were designed to preserve nucleotide content. The mut21 mutant converted AGCA to CAAG, while mut14 rearranged eight nucleotides within the element. These primers were examined in competition assays for protein binding to labeled 31-bp or 14-bp oligonucleotides, respectively. Like the 14-bp nonmutated primer, the mut21 mutant did not compete with the upper complex of L6 nuclei, but competed equally well for the lower complex present in both L6 and RN46A cells (Fig. 4 A). By contrast, rearrangement of 8 of 14 nucleotides in the mut14 oligonucleotide completely (for RN46A) or substantially (for L6) impaired the ability to compete for protein binding to the intact 14-bp primer (Fig. 4 B). Thus, the mutation in mut14 inactivates protein binding to the lower complex in L6 cells and completely blocks protein interaction in RN46A cells. The location of the upper protein-DNA binding complex in L6 cells was probed using double-stranded oligonucleotides directed at the 3′ portion of the 31-bp repressor located adjacent to the 14-bp site. Both 15-bp and 12-bp probes were used as competitors in EMSA using L6 extracts, and they failed to compete the two protein-DNA complexes (Fig. 5). The 14-bp sequence competed only the lower complex in L6 cells (Fig. 4 A). However, the combination of the 14- and 12-bp sequences competed effectively and eliminated the two protein complexes associated with the labeled 31-bp oligonucleotide (Fig. 5 A). Mutation of the 14- and 12-bp sequences (mut14 + mut12, Fig. 5 A) substantially impaired their ability to compete for protein binding. Because both 12-mer and 14-mer oligonucleotides were necessary to compete the upper complex, it suggested that the upper protein complex interacts with the 12-mer site and a small portion of the adjacent 14-mer site. To further examine the importance of these segments, mutations of the 14-mer, 12-mer, or both were incorporated in the 31-mer oligonucleotide as competitors in EMSA using L6 extracts. The 31-mer with the mutated 14-mer site selectively displaced the upper complex, the 31-mer with the mutated 12-mer site blocked the lower complex as expected, and the 31-mer with both mutations was ineffective in competition (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that the 12-mer segment is required for the upper protein-DNA complex, and the 14-mer sequence is essential for formation of the lower complex. We examined whether protein interaction with the 14-bp sequence mediates repression of the 5-HT1A receptor gene by mutating the 2300-luciferase construct (−2300) to incorporate the changes of the mut14 oligonucleotide (−2300 m1, Fig.6), which failed to displace protein binding to the labeled 14-bp oligonucleotide. When transfected in RN46A cells, mutation of the 14-bp element (−2300 m1) resulted in a 36.8 ± 6.2-fold basal induction of luciferase activity that was 80% of the activity observed upon deletion of the entire region between −1590 and −1519 bp (−2300/−1519). However, upon transfection in L6 cells luciferase activity was not altered between the wild type and mutated constructs, with average luciferase activities of 4.6 ± 0.8- and 4.7 ± 0.7-fold basal for the 2300-luciferase and 2300 m1-luciferase constructs, respectively. In contrast to the RN46A cell line, intact protein-DNA interaction at the 14-bp site was not essential for repression of the transcriptional activity of the 5-HT1A gene in L6 cell. Therefore, the 14-bp element suppresses the basal expression of 5-HT1A receptor in the raphe RN46A cell line. However, additional DNA elements maintain repression of the 5-HT1A receptor gene in L6 cells. This additional repressor may correspond to the second protein-DNA binding complex identified by EMSA using L6 nuclear extracts. In the same way, the 2300-luciferase construct was mutated at the 12-mer site (−2300 m2). Upon transfection in RN46A or L6 cells, luciferase activities were not significantly different from the nonmutated −2300 construct (Fig. 6, lane 4). Because this mutation eliminated only the upper complex in EMSA (Fig. 5), these functional data indicate that the 14-mer complex is sufficient to repress the 5-HT1A receptor gene in both RN46A and L6 cells. We examined whether combined mutation to disrupt protein binding to the 14-bp and 12-bp elements would derepress the 5-HT1A receptor gene in L6 cells. The 2300-luciferase construct (−2300) was mutated to inactivate both elements (−2300 m3, Table I), and luciferase activity was measured in transfected RN46A and L6 cells (Fig. 6, lane 5). The −2300 m1 (14-bp mutant only) and −2300 m3 (14- and 12-bp elements mutated) constructs displayed equivalent activities in RN46A cells, hence, no additional derepression was observed in the RN46A cells upon mutation of the 12-bp element. In contrast, although the 2300 m1 mutant remained repressed in L6 cells, the −2300 m3 mutant displayed a 37.2 ± 3.1-fold basal induction of luciferase activity that was nearly equivalent to the induction observed for the deletion mutant (−2300/−1519). Therefore, additional protein-DNA interactions at the 12-bp element in L6 cells maintain repression of the 5-HT1A receptor gene upon inactivation of the 14-bp element, suggesting that the upper protein-DNA complex provides a novel dual repression mechanism to regulate 5-HT1A gene transcription in the receptor-negative cell line. We investigated whether the single versus dual site repression could be extended to other 5-HT1A receptor-positive (SN48) or -negative (C6 glioma) cell lines, respectively. To examine protein-DNA interactions, nuclear extracts from RN46A, L6, C6, and differentiated SN48 cells (18.Charest A. Wainer B.H. Albert P.R. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 5164-5171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were incubated with labeled 31-bp probe and analyzed by EMSA (Fig. 7 A). SN48 and C6 cells displayed similar protein-DNA complexes as those of RN46A and L6 cells, respectively, suggesting that a single repressor operates in SN48 cells, and a dual repressor is present in C6 cells. To examine the importance of the 14- and 12-bp elements in these cells, the luciferase activities of the 5-HT1A receptor gene constructs used above were measured in SN48 and C6 cell lines (Fig. 7 B). A similar pattern of activities was observed. Mutation of the 14-bp element (2300 m1) derepressed the gene to nearly the same extent as the deletion mutant (−2300/−1519) in SN48 cells as observed in RN46A cells. However, mutation of both 14- and 12-bp elements (2300 m3) was required to derepress the gene in receptor-negative C6 and L6 cell lines. Thus, the 14-bp element appears to be crucial for regulation of 5-HT1A receptor expression in receptor-positive cells, whereas a dual mechanism appears to repress the gene in receptor-negative cells. Repression of gene transcription appears to be an important mechanism for determining neuronal specificity of expression (22.Mandel G. McKinnon D. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 323-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 23.Schoenherr C.J. Anderson D.J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 566-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Hence we sought to identify novel DNA elements that repress the 5-HT1A receptor gene in neuronal and non-neuronal cells. In the present study we have identified a proximal repressor region located between −1590 and −1519 bp and a putative positive regulatory region located between −2300 and −1590 bp upstream of the translational initiation site using a series of finer deletions of the 5-HT1A receptor gene fused to luciferase. Specific deletion of the putative repressor region between −1590 and −1519 bp revealed a striking 10-fold increase in luciferase activity (Fig. 1). The site of protein binding was further localized to a region spanning from −1524 to −1555 bp (Fig. 2). A 31-bp oligonucleotide based on this sequence interacted with a single protein complex of identical migration in EMSA from nuclei of 5-HT1A receptor-expressing cells; however, an additional complex was present in receptor-negative cell lines (Figs. 4 and 7). The minimal element essential for protein binding was identified within a 14-bp sequence (−1554/−1540 bp), although the DNase I protection assay (Fig. 2) suggested that other interactions with adjacent sequences may also occur. The sequence of the 14-bp element is novel and does not contain any recognizable repeats or palindromes. Sequence analysis of the 14-bp element aligned with two half-sites (CATAAG and GCAAGCC) for nuclear factor 1 (NF1) binding. Apart from its traditional role as a transcriptional activator, NF1 functions as a silencer in the Pit-1 gene (24.Rajas F. Delhase M. De La Hoya M. Verdood P. Castrillo J.L. Hooghe-Peters E.L. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, supershift using anti-NF1 antibody in EMSA failed to identify NF1 in protein complexes bound to the 31-bp probe (data not shown). A search of the GenBankTM data base identified a matching sequence for the 14-bp element (CATAAGCAAGCC) located at −1357/−1368 bp relative to the transcription start site in the human neurotrophin-3 promoter (25.Shintani A. Ono Y. Kaisho Y. Sasada R. Igarashi K. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1993; 17: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This location is within a strong repressor region (−2914/−514 bp) that preferentially silences the neurotrophin-3 gene in nonexpressing leukemia cells, but also partially in neurotrophin-3-positive glioma cells. Thus the 14-bp element may mediate repression of other genes in addition to the 5-HT1A receptor. We have also identified a sequence with high homology to the 14-bp element located in a repressor region of the human 5-HT1A receptor gene. 2S. Lemonde and P. R. Albert, unpublished observations. Preliminary results using the 31-bp element to probe a cDNA expression library indicate that a novel protein interacts with this sequence. 3X.-M. Ou, R. Farahani, Jafar-Nejad, and P. R. Albert, unpublished observations. Further identification of this protein is undergoing. Thus the 14-bp repressor element appears to represent a novel element that interacts with a new class of DNA binding proteins. An intriguing finding was the crucial role of the 14-bp element in repression of the 5-HT1A receptor gene selectively in 5-HT1A receptor-expressing neuronal cells. Upon mutation to inactivate protein interaction with the 14-bp element the extent of transcriptional derepression was nearly identical to that observed with deletion of the entire 71-bp repressor region, suggesting that the 14-bp element largely accounts for the inhibitory activity of this region in these neuronal cells. The RN46A and SN48 cell lines examined are derived from different neuronal populations that were transformed by different means. The RN46A cells are derived from transformation of e13 raphe cells using the temperature-sensitive SV40 T antigen (19.White L.A. Eaton M.J. Castro M.C. Klose K.J. Globus M.Y. Shaw G. Whittemore S.R. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 6744-6753Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the SN48 cells are hybrid p21 septal X N18TG2 neuroblastoma fusion cells (26.Lee H.J. Hammond D.N. Large T.H. Roback J.D. Sim J.A. Brown D.A. Otten U.H. Wainer B.H. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 1779-1787Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, both cell lines share the property of expressing a low level of 5-HT1A receptors, which can be increased upon differentiation of the cells (18.Charest A. Wainer B.H. Albert P.R. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 5164-5171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19.White L.A. Eaton M.J. Castro M.C. Klose K.J. Globus M.Y. Shaw G. Whittemore S.R. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 6744-6753Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results suggest that endogenous expression of 5-HT1A receptors is correlated with the presence of a single protein-DNA complex at the proximal repressor. The low level of 5-HT1A receptor expression in these transformed cell lines may reflect the presence of elevated levels of the repressor protein compared with postmitotic raphe or septal neurons. In contrast to the neuronal cell lines examined above, the non-neuronal L6 myoblast and C6 glioma cells lack 5-HT1A receptors (21.Storring J.M. Charest A. Cheng P. Albert P.R. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2238-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In these cell lines there was no change in the extent of repression of the 5-HT1A receptor gene upon mutation of the 14-bp element. The maintenance of repression in L6 and C6 cells upon mutation of the 14-bp element appears to result from a second protein complex in these cells that binds to a 12-bp segment located adjacent to the 14-bp element, because mutation of both 14- and 12-bp segments blocked repression in receptor-negative L6 and C6 cells. We postulate that two repressor elements are involved, because the 14-bp element selectively competed one, but not both, protein-DNA complexes in EMSA with the 31-bp probe. The upper protein complex may result not only from direct protein binding at a second DNA site but also from indirect protein-protein interactions to form a stable complex with an enlarged DNA recognition domain, because both 14- and 12-bp oligonucleotides were required to compete for protein binding to the 31-bp probe. Elucidation of the exact mechanism for repression in 5-HT1A receptor-negative cells will await the identification of the proteins involved. Both positive and negative cis-acting elements and factors are required for correct tissue-specific expression (22.Mandel G. McKinnon D. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 323-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 27.Ogbourne S. Antalis T.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Previously, repression of neuron-specific genes was thought to occur only in non-neuronal tissues that robustly express neural restriction proteins such as the silencer protein REST/NRSF (28.Chong J.A. Tapia-Ramirez J. Kim S. Toledo-Aral J.J. Zheng Y. Boutros M.C. Altshuller Y.M. Frohman M.A. Kraner S.D. Mandel G. Cell. 1995; 80: 949-957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar, 29.Schoenherr C.J. Anderson D.J. Science. 1995; 267: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar, 30.Chen Z.F. Paquette A.J. Anderson D.J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). The concept that gene repression plays important roles in neurons is gaining wider attention. For example, mutation of the RE-1/NRSE in the BDNF promoter does not influence extra-neuronal BDNF expression, but enhances both basal and kainate-induced induction of BDNF in hippocampal neurons (31.Timmusk T. Palm K. Lendahl U. Metsis M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1078-1084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, REST is expressed in brain (e.g., midbrain, pons/medulla, and hippocampus) and its expression is induced by kainic acid treatment (32.Palm K. Belluardo N. Metsis M. Timmusk T. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1280-1296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This indicates that REST may regulate gene expression in neurons as well as silencing expression in non-neuronal cells. Another example of repressor function in neurons is the SNOG element that restricts the expression of the GAP-43 gene to neurons (33.Weber J.R.M. Skene J.H.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7583-7593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However this element also exerts repression in cortical neurons, and a binding protein that associates with the SNOG element is present in neurons, although at lower apparent levels than in non-neuronal cells. By analogy, our results indicate that the 14-bp repressor of the 5-HT1A receptor gene plays a crucial role in the inhibitory regulation of the 5-HT1A receptor in receptor-expressing raphe and septal cells. The precise role of the 14-bp element in repression of the 5-HT1A receptor in vivo remains to be elucidated. However, a reduction of 5-HT1A receptor gene repression at the raphe could lead to elevated levels of 5-HT1A autoreceptors, which have been correlated with major depression (11.Stockmeier C.A. Shapiro L.A. Dilley G.E. Kolli T.N. Friedman L. Rajkowska G. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7394-7401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, an increase in gene repression would reduce the number of 5-HT1A receptors expressed in the raphe and limbic system, a condition that is thought to underlie generalized anxiety syndromes (8.Ramboz S. Oosting R. Amara D.A. Kung H.F. Blier P. Mendelsohn M. Mann J.J. Brunner D. Hen R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14476-14481Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar, 9.Parks C.L.

Parsons L.H. Tecott L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15049-15054Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Unlike cell-specific repression models involving non-neuronal expression of a single repressor (such as REST), we find that in 5-HT1A receptor-negative cells there is a dual repressor involving an additional protein complex that mediates repression of the gene. This suggests that the neural specificity of 5-HT1A receptor expression may be achieved in large part by differential repression using dual DNA elements. In summary, our results provide evidence for an alternate paradigm of single and dual repressors for cell-specific regulation of the rat 5-HT1A receptor gene. We have identified a novel 14-bp repressor element within the proximal repressive region that mediates selective repression of the 5-HT1A receptor gene in raphe and septal cells that express the 5-HT1A receptor. By contrast, in cells that do not express the 5-HT1A receptor, two adjacent repressors and their associated protein complexes provide a novel dual repression mechanism. The 14-bp element is likely to play an important role in the regulation of basal 5-HT1A receptor expression in neuronal cells that express the receptor. Conversely, the dual repression mechanism helps to ensure that the gene is inactivated in cells that do not express the receptor, such as non-neuronal cells. Because alteration in the level of 5-HT1A receptors in the raphe nuclei and limbic system is associated with mental disorders, mechanisms that selectively regulate 5-HT1A receptor gene transcription in the raphe nuclei could provide a molecular basis for illnesses such as major depression or anxiety disorders.

CaM-dependent protein kinase type IV calspermin cyclic AMP-responsive element modulator follicle stimulating hormone cytoskeletal buffer 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid Spermatogenesis consists of three phases: mitosis, meiosis, and spermiogenesis. Spermatogonia comprise the stem cell population around the periphery of the seminiferous tubules and maintain cell numbers by mitotic divisions. Unknown signals lead to the commitment of some cells to differentiate into spermatocytes, which spend the majority of time in meiotic prophase before undergoing meiosis. Postmeiotic spermatids are closest to the lumen and differentiate into spermatozoa during spermiogenesis, a process that includes flagellar formation and nuclear condensation. Within the seminiferous tubule, there are well characterized cell associations that define the histological classification of spermatogenesis in the mouse into 12 distinct stages (1.Russell L.D.

Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV)1 and calspermin (CaS) are two proteins expressed in the testis and encoded by a common gene, Camk4. This gene has three promoters; the first two regulate expression of the α and β isoforms of CaMKIV, while the third promoter lies within the 10th kinase intron and controls transcription of calspermin (2.Means A.R.

CaMKIV is a multifunctional enzyme dependent on both calcium and calmodulin for activity (2.Means A.R. Cruzalegui F. LeMagueresse B. Needleman D.S. Slaughter G.R. Ono T. Mol. Cell.

Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2081-2087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CaMKIV is expressed in several tissues in addition to the testis, including brain and thymus (2.Means A.R.

Biol. 1991; 11: 3960-3971Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), whereas calspermin is found only in the testis (5.Ono T. Slaughter G.R. Cook R.G. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2081-2087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Within the testis, the mRNAs encoding CaMKIV and calspermin have distinct expression patterns. In situ hybridization studies in rat testis have demonstrated that Camk4 mRNA is expressed within pachytene spermatocytes (2.Means A.R. Cruzalegui F. LeMagueresse B. Needleman D.S. Slaughter G.R. Ono T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3960-3971Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). On the other hand, calspermin mRNA is localized to postmeiotic round spermatids (2.Means A.R. Cruzalegui F.

Several reports have suggested that CaMKIV plays a role in transcriptional regulation in lymphocytes and neurons (6.Enslen H. Sun P. Brickey D. Soderling S.H. Klamo E. Soderling T.R. J. Biol.

Cell. 1996; 87: 1203-1214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). In the testis, CaMKIV has been proposed to regulate calspermin expression by phosphorylation and activation of the testis-specific transcription factor CREMτ, which in turn drives transcription of several germ cell genes, including calspermin, whose promoters contain cyclic AMP-responsive elements (4.Sun Z. Sassone-Corsi P. Means A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 11.Sun Z. Means A.R. Hansson V. Proceedings of the 9th European Testis Workshop.

Calspermin has no kinase activity and instead may be involved in regulating high levels of calmodulin found in germ cells (13.Means A.R. Cruzalegui F. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1993; 48: 79-97Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Little is currently known about the regulation of CaMKIV in the testis. We have examined the expression and regulation of CaMKIV and calspermin in mouse testis. We report that, contrary to predictions based on studies in rat testis, mouse CaMKIV is expressed in spermatogonia and spermatids and excluded from pachytene spermatocytes. In contrast, calspermin is restricted to spermatids as expected. The expression of CaMKIV and calspermin in seminiferous tubules is stage-dependent and appears to be coordinately regulated. We further demonstrate that CaMKIV is associated with chromatin and the nuclear matrix and may be targeted to the latter structure by phosphorylation. These results may point to a novel function for CaMKIV in posttranscriptional spermatids. The cDNA for mouse calspermin was cloned by RT-PCR from mouse testis RNA with the following primers: sense 5′-TTCCCATGGACACTGCTCAGAAGA-3′ and antisense 5′-CTGATCTAGAGGAAGCCAGCTTAG-3′. The sequence was then subcloned into the NcoI and XbaI sites of the pET-30c vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) to generate His6-tagged calspermin. The fusion protein was expressed inEscherichia coli and purified over a nickel resin according to the manufacturer's protocol. Purified protein was mixed with Freund's adjuvant and injected into rabbits to raise a polyclonal antibody against calspermin (anti-CaS). Testes were homogenized in a buffer with 25 mm Hepes, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, and 0.1 μg/ml Pefablock. 75 μg of protein were subjected to electrophoresis on a 12% gel, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and blocked with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20. Membranes were incubated with anti-CaS (1:5000), anti-CaMKIVβ (1:1000) (kindly provided by Dr. Hiroyuki Sakagami, Tohoku University School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan), anti-CaMKK (1:1000) (Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA), or anti-lamin B (1:1000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody, and developed with the ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 75 μg of testis protein were subjected to electrophoresis on a 12% gel, transferred to an Immobilon membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), and then incubated with 100 mm imidazole (pH 7.0) for 10 min followed by a 40-min incubation in solution G (20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 200 mm KCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% NaN3, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.05% Tween 20) (14.Glenney Jr., J.R. Weber K. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10551-10554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane was then incubated in solution G with125I-calmodulin (specific activity 1 × 106 cpm/ml) for 2 h and washed twice with solution G for 30 min. Calmodulin binding was detected by autoradiography. Iodination of CaM was performed with Bolton-Hunter reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described (15.Chafouleas J.G. Dedman J.R. Munjaal R.P. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10262-10267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Testes were fixed in Bouin's fixative and paraffin-embedded. 7-μm sections were cut and stained with periodic acid Schiff-hematoxylin (Poly Scientific, Bay Shore, NY). For immunohistochemistry, sections were incubated in 3% H2O2 to block endogenous peroxidase activity, subjected to antigen retrieval by microwaving in 10 mmsodium citrate, pH 6.0, for 10 min, and incubated with anti-calspermin at 1:200 overnight at 4 °C. Following three washes in phosphate-buffered saline, sections were incubated with biotinylated secondary antibody and streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), detected with diaminobenzidine (Sigma) or NovaRed substrate (Vector Laboratories), and counterstained with hematoxylin. 23-Day-old male mice were injected intraperitoneally with FSH administered in the form of 5 IU of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (Sigma) each day for 7 days and then sacrificed. In a separate experiment, hypophysectomized 6-week-old male mice were obtained from Taconic (Germantown, NY) and sacrificed 7 days postsurgery. Testis proteins were fractionated by Nonidet P-40 solubility as described by Moroiet al. (16.Moroi S. Saitou M. Fujimoto K. Sakakibara A. Furuse M. Yoshida O. Tsukita S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1708-C1717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, testes were homogenized in 1 ml of Nonidet P-40 buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 25 mm NaF, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin), rotated at 4 °C for 30 min, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was designated the Nonidet P-40-soluble fraction, and the pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of SDS buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 4 mm EDTA, 25 mm NaF, 1% SDS, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Following the addition of 900 μl of Nonidet P-40 buffer, samples were rotated at 4 °C for 30 min and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting supernatant was designated the Nonidet P-40-insoluble fraction. 50 μg of testis protein were incubated with 100, 400, or 1000 units of λ phosphatase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) for 1 h at 30 °C. Phosphatase activity was inhibited by the addition of 50 mmEDTA. Isolation of chromatin and nuclear matrix was performed as described (17.Reyes J.C. Muchardt C. Yaniv M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) with modifications. Testes were homogenized in cytoskeletal buffer (CSK; 10 mm Pipes, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 25 mm NaF). Following incubation at 4 °C for 3 min, samples were centrifuged at 5000 × g for 3 min. Chromatin was released by digestion with 1000 units/ml RNase-free DNase I (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in CSK buffer for 15 min at 37 °C. Ammonium sulfate in CSK buffer was added to a final concentration of 0.25 m. Samples were incubated at 4 °C for 5 min and centrifuged. The pellet was extracted with 2m NaCl in CSK buffer for 5 min at 4 °C and then centrifuged. The resulting nuclear matrix fraction was solubilized in urea buffer (8 m urea, 0.1 mNaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris, pH 8). Although the rat and mouse forms of CaMKIV are highly conserved in their amino termini, they diverge significantly at the carboxyl termini (18.Mosialos G. Hanissian S.H. Jawahar S. Vara L. Kieff E. Chatila T.A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1697-1705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To characterize the patterns of CaMKIV and calspermin expression in the mouse, we cloned and expressed mouse calspermin as a His-tagged fusion protein (his-CaS; Fig.1 A, lanes 1 and 2). Purified His-tagged calspermin is recognized at high concentrations by an antibody raised against rat calspermin (lane 3) and binds125I-CaM on overlay (lane 4), confirming the presence of a functional calmodulin binding domain in the recombinant protein. This protein was used to raise a polyclonal rabbit antibody that detects both CaMKIV and calspermin (Fig.1 B). We used the polyclonal rabbit antibody to examine the age-dependent expression patterns of CaMKIV and calspermin in the mouse testis during postnatal development. The first wave of spermatogenesis after birth proceeds synchronously. For the first two postnatal weeks, seminiferous tubules are populated only by Sertoli cells and spermatogonia, with pachytene spermatocytes appearing on day 14 and round spermatids on day 21 (19.Don J. Winer M.A. Wolgemuth D.J. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1994; 38: 16-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We unexpectedly found that CaMKIV protein is already expressed at day 9, although at low levels (Fig. 1 C, upper panel). The appearance of CaMKIV in the testis occurs earlier than would be expected for localization in pachytene spermatocytes and suggests that CaMKIV may in fact be expressed instead in spermatogonia. CaMKIV protein levels first peak at day 15, with a second, more pronounced increase after day 25. In contrast, calspermin protein does not appear until day 25, as predicted if expressed in postmeiotic spermatids (Fig. 1 C,lower panel). Western blotting of testis extracts from germ cell-deficient W/Wv mice, which contain only Sertoli cells, confirmed that CaMKIV is restricted to germ cells (Fig.1 D). To examine the cell types expressing CaMKIV and calspermin, we performed immunohistochemical analysis of testes from mice of varying ages. Positive staining can be seen in numerous cells at the periphery of the seminiferous tubule by day 8, when Western blot results indicate that only CaMKIV is expressed (Fig.2 A). Since CaMKIV is not expressed in Sertoli cells, these cells must be spermatogonia. Sections incubated with preimmune serum or with antibody preabsorbed with antigen show no positive staining of spermatogonia (Fig. 2 Band data not shown). By day 15, CaMKIV-positive cells are clearly restricted to peripheral spermatogonia, with no staining visible in newly emerging pachytene spermatocytes (Fig. 2 C). Immunostaining of testes at day 25, when calspermin is first expressed as determined by Western blotting, revealed the appearance of positive staining in round spermatids as they reached stages IV and V, confirming that calspermin is produced in haploid postmeiotic germ cells (Fig. 2 D). The adult pattern of immunohistochemical staining was established by day 30 (Fig. 2 E). Interestingly, there is a clear stage dependence in staining of both spermatogonia and spermatids. Both of these cell types first stain positive at stages IV and V and maintain expression through stages VIII and IX (Fig.2 F). These results establish a novel cellular localization for CaMKIV as well as an apparently coordinated stage-dependent pattern of expression for both CaMKIV and calspermin. There is a significant increase in CaMKIV protein levels after day 25 (Fig. 1 C). This is coincident with the time when mice begin to attain sexual maturity and may simply reflect the increase in germ cell numbers at puberty. However, there is a surge in gonadotropin levels at this time as well, raising the possibility that CaMKIV might be hormonally regulated. Injections of a peptide with FSH action can induce early puberty in mice (20.Grasso P. Rozhavskaya M. Reichert Jr., L.E. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4215-4219Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To determine whether repeated administrations of FSH could increase CaMKIV levels in the testis, 23-day-old mice were injected with 5 IU of FSH every day for a week. Testis lysates from hormone-treated and control mice were then immunoblotted for CaMKIV, with no detectable change in CaMKIV levels (data not shown). Hypophysectomy has also been used to study hormonal effects on gene regulation in rat testis (21.Nazian S.J. Brewer L.D. Ness G.C. J. Androl. 1991; 12: 264-272PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Krummen L.A. Toppari J. Kim W.H. Morelos B.S. Ahmad N. Swerdloff R.S. Ling N. Shimasaki S. Esch F. Bhasin S. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 1630-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Postpubertal mice were hypophysectomized and sacrificed 1 week later. Again, no change in CaMKIV levels was evident (data not shown). These results indicate that CaMKIV is not acutely regulated by hormonal stimuli. Another explanation for the observed increase in CaMKIV levels in postpubertal mice would be the expression of CaMKIV in a new population of cells. Although immunohistochemistry results confirm that CaMKIV is expressed in spermatogonia while calspermin is found in spermatids, they do not rule out the possibility that CaMKIV is also expressed in spermatids, since the antibody cannot distinguish between the two proteins. To address this question, we turned to germ cell fractionation, in which relatively pure populations of germ cells can be isolated by passing them through a density gradient (23.Bellve A.R. Cavicchia J.C. Millette C.F. O'Brien D.A. Bhatnagar Y.M. Dym M. J. Cell Biol. 1977; 74: 68-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). Western blotting of isolated pachytene spermatocyte, round spermatid, and condensing spermatid fractions demonstrated that CaMKIV is indeed expressed at high levels in round and condensing spermatids but is completely absent in pachytene spermatocytes (Fig.3 A). Therefore, contrary toin situ hybridization studies to detect Camk4mRNA in rat testis, our results establish that mouse CaMKIV protein is excluded from pachytene spermatocytes but expressed in both spermatogonia and elongating spermatids. Proteins expressed in elongating spermatids are frequently subjected to translational regulation. For instance, the protamine genes are transcribed in round spermatids and then stored for 1 week as cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein particles before being translated in late elongating spermatids (24.Kleene K.C. Distel R.J. Hecht N.B. Dev. Biol. 1984; 105: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). More extensive analysis has demonstrated that the increase in CaMKIV protein levels occurs at approximately day 27 (Fig. 4 B and data not shown). If CaMKIV were translationally regulated, one might predict an up-regulation of mRNA levels before the increase in protein levels at day 27. Northern blot analysis of testis RNA from mice of increasing ages revealed that there is a significant increase in mRNA levels at day 27, along with an apparent decrease in the length of the CaMKIV message (Fig. 3 B). The increase in mRNA levels occurs concomitantly with the increase in CaMKIV protein, indicating that CaMKIV expression in spermatids is not translationally regulated. Likewise, calspermin mRNA appears on day 27, the same day at which calspermin protein is first expressed. By immunohistochemical staining at higher magnifications, CaMKIV appears to be present in the nucleus of both spermatogonia and spermatids, where CaMKIV might be expected to localize if it is involved in transcriptional regulation. The acidic COOH terminus of CaMKIV may be characteristic of chromatin-associated proteins (25.Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1479-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To determine whether CaMKIV might be bound to chromatin, we first examined whether CaMKIV in a testis lysate is resistant to detergent extraction (16.Moroi S. Saitou M. Fujimoto K. Sakakibara A. Furuse M. Yoshida O. Tsukita S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1708-C1717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CaMKIV is present in both Nonidet P-40-soluble and -insoluble fractions (Fig. 4 A). Furthermore, it exists as a doublet in both, although the upper band runs with slower electrophoretic mobility in the Nonidet P-40-insoluble fraction. Western blotting of testis lysates from mice of varying ages revealed that the higher band in the insoluble fraction does not appear until day 27 (Fig. 4 B), suggesting that this might represent a spermatid-specific pool of CaMKIV. In support of this possibility, the upper band comigrates with a band of higher electrophoretic mobility seen in purified elongating spermatids (Fig. 3 A and data not shown). The appearance of the higher band accounts for the increased protein levels after day 25 seen in Fig. 1 C. The doublet bands seen in both Nonidet P-40-soluble and -insoluble fractions might represent different CaMKIV isoforms or posttranslational modification. Two isoforms of CaMKIV have been identified in the cerebellum, with the larger β-isoform distinguished by a 28-amino acid NH2-terminal extension (26.Ohmstede C.A. Jensen K.F. Sahyoun N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5866-5875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Sakagami H. Kondo H. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1993; 19: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A Western blot was performed with an antibody specific for the CaMKIVβ isoform to determine whether the two bands of CaMKIV seen in the testis correspond to the two different isoforms. Although CaMKIVβ is clearly expressed in the cerebellum, there is no discernible expression in the testis, suggesting that the upper band is not the CaMKIVβ isoform (Fig. 4 C). Activation of CaMKIV requires phosphorylation by an upstream Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (28.Tokumitsu H. Enslen H. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19320-19324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 29.Edelman A.M. Mitchelhill K.I. Selbert M.A. Anderson K.A. Hook S.S. Stapleton D. Goldstein E.G. Means A.R. Kemp B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10806-10810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To establish whether the upper band represents a posttranslational modification of CaMKIVα, testis lysates were treated with increasing concentrations of λ-phosphatase (Fig.4 D). This resulted in the collapse of the doublet into a single band of faster electrophoretic mobility, indicating that the electrophoretic mobility shift is due to phosphorylation. This shift could be prevented by the addition of 50 mm EDTA to inhibit the phosphatase (Fig. 4 D, lane 5). To determine whether CaMKIV is indeed associated with chromatin, the detergent-insoluble pellet was treated with DNase I followed by 0.25m ammonium sulfate to release chromatin-bound proteins (17.Reyes J.C. Muchardt C. Yaniv M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The remaining pellet was then washed with 2 m NaCl and resuspended in urea buffer to obtain the nuclear matrix. Western blotting of these fractions demonstrated that CaMKIV is associated with both chromatin and the nuclear matrix (Fig.5 A, upper panel). The presence of nuclear matrix proteins was confirmed by blotting for lamin B, a matrix-specific marker (Fig.5 A, lower panel) (27.Sakagami H. Kondo H. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1993; 19: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the CaMKIV present in each fraction appears to be differentially phosphorylated, with the higher band present only in the nuclear matrix. To examine whether this might be spermatid-specific hyperphosphorylated CaMKIV, testes from mice at different ages were fractionated and blotted for CaMKIV. CaMKIV is not present in the nuclear matrix until day 27 (Fig. 5 B, lane 12), although it can be found in the chromatin at any age (Fig. 5 B, lanes 2, 6, and10). These results suggest that at least a portion of CaMKIV expressed in elongating spermatids is hyperphosphorylated and targeted to the nuclear matrix. These studies have focused on the characterization of CaMKIV regulation and expression patterns in mouse testis. They have led to the unexpected finding that CaMKIV is not expressed in pachytene spermatocytes as had been predicted based on previous studies in rat testis (2.Means A.R. Cruzalegui F. LeMagueresse B. Needleman D.S. Slaughter G.R. Ono T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3960-3971Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). CaMKIV is instead expressed initially in spermatogonia, and then again in elongating spermatids. There are several potential explanations for the observed differences. One reason is that conclusions about CaMKIV localization in rat testis were based only onin situ hybridization to detect mRNA, whereas our experiments have examined the localization of the protein in mouse. It is possible that the mRNA is synthesized early in spermatocytes, then stored until the spermatid stage for translation, as occurs with the protamines (24.Kleene K.C. Distel R.J. Hecht N.B. Dev. Biol. 1984; 105: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). However, although Camk4 mRNA is already present at day 9 in mouse testis, there is a significant increase in mRNA level at day 27 coincident with the appearance of CaMKIV in spermatids, suggesting that CaMKIV expression in spermatids is not translationally regulated. This increase is accompanied by a reduction in the length of the Camk4 mRNA. Human testis has been reported to have CaMKIV mRNAs of several different lengths (30.Bland M.M. Monroe R.S. Ohmstede C.A. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 142: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The decrease in length may be due to use of an alternate polyadenylation site, shortening of the poly(A) tail, or perhaps even alternative splicing. In the rat brain, use of alternate polyadenylation sites results in CaMKIV mRNAs of differing lengths (31.Ohmstede C.A. Bland M.M. Merrill B.M. Sahyoun N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5784-5788Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Another explanation for the discrepancy in expression patterns is that there may be some species differences in CaMKIV expression patterns. Further studies on the localization of CaMKIV protein in rat testis will be required to clarify this issue. We have also found that CaMKIV expression is stage-dependent in the adult mouse testis and appears to be coordinated with that of calspermin. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of coordinated stage-dependent expression for two proteins encoded by the same genetic locus. In the testis, germ cell-specific isoforms of proteins are often produced by the use of alternative promoters and/or splicing (32.Erickson R.P. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 264-269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 33.Eddy E.M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). However, CaMKIV and calspermin are unusual in that the proteins are functionally distinct and both are expressed in the testis. Intriguingly, several examples of functionally unrelated gene products involve other calmodulin-dependent protein kinases. These include three proteins lacking kinase activity, telokin/KRP (34.Collinge M. Matrisian P.E. Zimmer W.E. Shattuck R.L. Lukas T.J. Van Eldik L.J. Watterson D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2359-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), αKAP (35.Bayer K.U. Lohler J. Harbers K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 29-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and CARP (36.Vreugdenhil E. Datson N. Engels B. de Jong J. van Koningsbruggen S. Schaaf M. de Kloet E.R. J. Neurobiol. 1999; 39: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), derived from the loci encoding myosin light chain kinase, CaM-dependent protein kinase IIα, and CaM-dependent protein kinase VI, respectively. The coordinated expression of CaMKIV and calspermin in stages IV through IX suggests a common regulation, although the mechanism is not clear. However, the expression of calspermin is not dependent on CaMKIV, since calspermin production is unaffected in mice lacking CaMKIV. 2J. Y. Wu and A. R. Means, submitted for publication. The appearance of CaMKIV in elongating spermatids is temporally coincident with the increase in CaMKIV protein and mRNA levels at day 27 as well as the appearance of a slower migrating band of CaMKIV resistant to detergent extraction. This shift in electrophoretic mobility is due to phosphorylation, since the testis is devoid of the CaMKIVβ isoform and phosphatase treatment of testis lysates results in the presence of only a single band of faster electrophoretic migration. Taken together, these findings suggest the presence of a previously unidentified fraction of hyperphosphorylated CaMKIV in elongating spermatids. This hyperphosphorylated CaMKIV is exclusively targeted to the nuclear matrix. The nature of the phosphorylation events targeting CaMKIV to the nuclear matrix has not been elucidated. Activation of CaMKIV is thought to require a unique three-step mechanism: 1) binding of Ca2+/CaM, 2) phosphorylation of Thr196 by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase, and 3) autophosphorylation of Ser12 and Ser13 in the amino terminus (8.Chatila T. Anderson K.A. Ho N. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21542-21548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Expression of CaMKIVα in BJAB cells (18.Mosialos G. Hanissian S.H. Jawahar S. Vara L. Kieff E. Chatila T.A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1697-1705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or rabbit reticulocyte lysates (8.Chatila T. Anderson K.A. Ho N. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21542-21548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) results in the appearance of two closely migrating bands. Mutations that abrogate kinase activity abolish the upper band (8.Chatila T. Anderson K.A. Ho N. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21542-21548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), suggesting that phosphorylation of one or more of these sites may be responsible for a shift in electrophoretic mobility. There is also a phosphorylated band in the soluble CaMKIV fraction that migrates somewhat faster than phosphorylated detergent-insoluble CaMKIV and may reflect phosphorylation on fewer or perhaps alternate sites. Identification of the target residues in each case may offer further insights into the regulatory mechanisms governing CaMKIV expression and localization in germ cells. The novel finding of CaMKIV expression in elongating spermatids raises the question of the function of CaMKIV in these cells. In lymphocytes and hippocampal neurons, there is evidence to suggest that CaMKIV plays a role in cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein-mediated transcription (6.Enslen H. Sun P. Brickey D.

Cell. 1996; 87: 1203-1214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). This led to the proposal that in the testis CaMKIV has a similar function in regulating CREMτ, another member of the B-ZIP family of transcription factors (11.Sun Z. Means A.R. Hansson V. Proceedings of the 9th European Testis Workshop. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1996: 29-52Google Scholar). However, the results we report here cast doubt on the role of CaMKIV as a physiologically relevant activator of CREMτ. CaMKIV is not expressed in pachytene spermatocytes or early round spermatids, where it might colocalize with CREMτ. In addition, CaMKIV is not produced until spermatids begin to elongate, after transcriptional activity has ceased (37.Soderstrom K.O. Parvinen M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1976; 5: 181-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Indeed, we have recently demonstrated that cyclic AMP-responsive element-dependent gene transcription is intact in mice with a targeted deletion of CaMKIV.2 Some clues to the function of CaMKIV in spermatids might be found in its localization to the chromatin (an observation previously noted in neurons by Jensen et al. (42.Jensen K.F. Ohmstede C-A. Fisher R.S. Sahyoun N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2850-2853Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar)) and nuclear matrix. One of the hallmarks of spermiogenesis is nuclear condensation, during which DNA is compacted by the sequential replacement of histones by transition proteins and protamines (38.Meistrich M.L. Hnilica L.S. Stein G.S. Stein J.L. Histones and Other Basic Nuelar Proteins. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1989: 165-182Google Scholar). DNA packaging in sperm differs from that of other cell types in that sperm DNA is organized into linear, side-by-side arrays rather than into nucleosomes as found in somatic cells (39.Ward W.S. Coffey D.S. Biol. Reprod. 1991; 44: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). These linear arrays allow for greater packing of DNA, with the result that sperm DNA is 6-fold more condensed than DNA in mitotic chromosomes (39.Ward W.S. Coffey D.S. Biol. Reprod. 1991; 44: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 40.Balhorn R. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Of particular note is that CaMKIV appears to be targeted to the nuclear matrix only in elongating spermatids. In mammalian sperm nuclei, the nuclear matrix is believed to organize DNA further into loop domains (41.Ward W.S. Partin A.W. Coffey D.S. Chromosoma. 1989; 98: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The localization of CaMKIV to the nuclear matrix may indicate its involvement in chromatin remodeling. This proposed role for CaMKIV is supported by the finding that spermiogenesis is abrogated in CaMKIV-deficient mice, with impaired chromatin condensation and disruption of protamine 2 in late spermatids.2 These results point to a novel function for CaMKIV in mammalian spermatids.

CAD is complexed with its inhibitor (ICAD-L), also called DFF45, as a latent form in growing non-apoptotic cells. When caspase 3 is activated by apoptotic stimuli, it cleaves ICAD-L at two sites. This cleavage causes the release of CAD, which degrades chromosomal DNA in nuclei. We previously found that when CAD is synthesized alone in insect cells, the protein forms aggregates and has no detectable DNase activity (17.Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15740-15744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, active, soluble CAD protein was recovered as a complex with ICAD-L when CAD was co-expressed with ICAD-L, suggesting that ICAD-L is necessary for production of the functional CAD. One of characteristics of CAD is a high content of cysteine residues (11.Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2784) Google Scholar). Mouse CAD consists of 344 amino acids, 14 of which are cysteines. In this report, we found that most, if not all, of the cysteine residues in mouse CAD exist as thiol form. The ICAD-L-dependent production of functional CAD in reticulocyte lysates was enhanced by reducing agents and inhibited by oxidized glutathione, suggesting that the formation of disulfide bonds causes CAD to aggregate. Furthermore, ICAD-L enhanced the renaturation of the chemically denatured CAD in an ATP-independent manner under highly reducing conditions. In contrast, the reticulocyte lysates stimulated the renaturation of denatured CAD in the absence of a high concentration of reducing agents. This process was dependent not only on ICAD-L but also on ATP. These results suggest that reticulocyte lysates contain a factor(s) that keeps CAD at a reduced and folding competent state, in an ATP-dependent manner. They further suggest that this form of CAD is recognized specifically by ICAD-L, which helps it to acquire its final, appropriately folded form. Recombinant mouse ICAD-L or ICAD-S fused with glutathione S-transferase (GST-ICAD-L or GST-ICAD-S) and hexahistidine-tagged recombinant human caspase 3 were prepared inEscherichia coli as described (11.Enari M.

In brief, plasmid DNA (1 μg) carrying mouse CAD in a pBluescript vector was incubated at 30 °C for 2 h with 40 μl of the TNT reagents. The CAD activity was determined by measuring DNase activity as described previously (11.Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S.

After the reaction, the DNA was extracted and analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel. The DNase activity was quantified by determining the concentration of CAD that causes the complete disappearance of the intact plasmid DNA (17.Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. J. Biol.

In brief, the recombinant mouse CAD (1.0 μg) was spotted onto a PVDF membrane (Applied Biosystem), incubated at 25 °C for 30 min in the dark with 2 mg of 4-vinylpyridine (Wako Pure Chemicals) in 0.2 m sodium acetate (pH 6.0), 0.1% SDS, 5% acetonitrile, and 8 m guanidine hydrochloride.

The reduced cysteine residues were then carboxymethylated at 25 °C for 15 min with 3 mg of iodoacetic acid in 1 n NaOH. The filter was washed with 2% acetonitrile and then with 0.1% SDS. The immobilized, alkylated CAD was digested with Achromobacter protease I as described (19.Iwamatsu A. Yoshida-Kubomura N. J. Biochem.

Recombinant CAD (10 μg) was concentrated by acetone precipitation, dissolved in 20 μl of buffer B (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 50 mm KCl, 20% (v/v) glycerol) containing 10 mm DTT and 6 mguanidine hydrochloride, and incubated at 30 °C for 60 min to denature the protein. The 0.5-μl aliquots of the reaction mixture was diluted 100-fold with buffer C (buffer B supplemented with 500 mm NaCl) containing 0.3 μm GST-ICAD-L and 100 mm DTT and incubated at 30 °C for 120 min. To renature CAD in the presence of reticulocyte lysates, 10 μg of the recombinant mouse CAD was denatured in 20 μl of buffer D (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 50 mm KCl, and 10 mmDTT) containing 6 m guanidine hydrochloride as described above. The denatured protein (0.5 μl of the reaction mixture) was diluted with 50 μl of buffer D containing reticulocyte lysates and 0.3 μm GST-ICAD-L and incubated at 30 °C for 120 min. The 1.0-kilobase pair coding sequence of mouse CAD cDNA (11.Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2784) Google Scholar) was inserted under the T7 promoter of pET expression vector, and the resultant plasmid was introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3) (21.Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5981) Google Scholar). The cells were grown in 400 ml of 2× YT medium at 37 °C untilA 600 reached 0.8 and treated for 2.5 h with 1 mm IPTG. The cells were pelleted and resuspended in 40 ml of buffer E (10 mm HEPES-KOH buffer, pH 7.2, containing 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm p-APMSF) and disrupted by sonication with 3 cycles of freezing and thawing. The lysates were spun for 30 min at 30,000 × g, and the precipitates were resuspended in 6 ml of buffer B containing 10 mm DTT and 7 m guanidine hydrochloride. After incubation at 30 °C for 2 h, the suspensions were spun for 30 min at 30,000 × g, and the supernatant fractions were diluted 100-fold with buffer C containing 0.3 μm GST-ICAD-L. The mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 120 min and applied to a 6-ml glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The GST-ICAD-L·CAD complex was eluted with 20 mm glutathione in 100 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 9.6, containing 10% glycerol, 0.1 mmDTT, and 0.1 mm p-APMSF and further purified on a Mono S HR5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with a 150–650 mm linear NaCl gradient in buffer E. Approximately, 2 mg of GST-ICAD-L·CAD complex was obtained. Mouse and human CADs carry 14 and 11 cysteine residues, respectively, 10 of which are conserved between them (15.Mukae N. Enari M. Sakahira H. Fukuda Y. Inazawa J. Toh H. Nagata S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9123-9128Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The cytosol of mammalian cells is in a highly reduced state (22.Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar), where CAD is localized, suggesting that all cysteine residues of CAD can be in reduced form. To examine whether these cysteine residues form disulfide bonds or exist as thiols, the cysteine residues of mouse CAD were alkylated in two steps. In the first step, the denatured mouse CAD was immobilized on a PVDF membrane, and the free thiols were alkylated with 4-vinylpyridine under nonreducing conditions. Any disulfide bonds in CAD were then reduced by treatment with a high concentration of DTT and were alkylated with iodoacetic acid. The alkylated CAD was then digested with Achromobacter protease I, which released several peptides. Molecular masses of the peptides were determined by MALDI-MS (Fig. 1) and compared with those expected for pyridylethylated or carboxymethylated peptides. As shown in Table I, molecular masses of 5 cysteine-containing peptides agreed well with the masses expected forS-pyridylethylated peptides, indicating that Cys-2, -20, -29, -307, and -317 do not form disulfide bonds. Double digestion of the alkylated CAD with Achromobacter protease I and Asp-N released additional peptides. Analysis of these peptides with MALDI-MS indicated that Cys-37, -50, -197, -221, and -238 are also pyridylethylated, and no carboxymethylated peptides were detected (data not shown). Although the status of the other four cysteine residues (Cys-10, -62, -163, and -229) was not confirmed, these results indicated that most of cysteine residues in mouse CAD exist as free thiols.Table IMolecular mass analysis of CAD peptidesObserved massTheoretical massΔ massSequencesPositions1025.501025.570.07LVHIACaPyridylethylcystein.HK302–3091061.531061.580.05Ac-CaPyridylethylcystein.

To examine the involvement of cysteine residues in the enzymatic activity of CAD, CAD's DNase activity was assayed in the presence of reducing or oxidizing agents. As shown in Fig.2 A, the DNase activity of CAD was barely affected by these agents. Similarly, no inhibition of DNase activity was seen with other cysteine-modifying reagents such as 5 mm iodoacetamide (data not shown), suggesting that cysteine residues are not actively involved in the enzymatic activity of CAD. On the other hand, a high concentration of DTT greatly enhanced the production of functional CAD in a cell-free system. As shown in Fig.2 B, the addition of 30 mm DTT to the reaction mixture produced about 4-fold more functional CAD in the presence of ICAD-L, whereas the presence of 3 mm oxidized glutathione (GSSG) completely inhibited the production of active CAD. The other reducing agent, 2-mercaptoethanol, also showed an enhancing effect although its effect at 30 mm was weaker than that of DTT (data not shown). The enhancing and inhibitory effects of these agents were not due to effects on the transcription or translational machinery, because Western blotting analysis with anti-mouse CAD antibody detected similar amounts of 40-kDa CAD protein under both reducing and oxidizing conditions (data not shown). The above results suggested that most of the cysteine residues of CAD should be in reduced form upon its synthesis. The requirement of ICAD-L for the production of functional CAD (17.Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15740-15744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) suggests that ICAD-L works as a chaperone for CAD. Chaperones are known to enhance the renaturation of denatured proteins (23.Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3077) Google Scholar, 24.Jakob U. Buchner J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 205-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 25.Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2397) Google Scholar). To examine whether ICAD-L in fact works as a chaperone, we established an assay system for the refolding of denatured CAD. Purified CAD was denatured at a concentration of 12.5 μm with 6 mguanidine hydrochloride and diluted 100-fold with a buffer containing 20% glycerol and 0.5 m NaCl. Under these conditions, CAD did not renature, and the addition of 0.3 μm ICAD-L had little effect. However, ICAD-L-dependent renaturation of CAD was observed in the presence of reducing agents. As shown in Fig.3 A, when the denatured CAD was renatured in the presence of 100 mm DTT and 0.3 μm ICAD-L, about 60% of the original activity of CAD was recovered within 2 h. Similarly, 100 mm2-mercaptoethanol stimulated renaturation of CAD, although its effect was weaker than that of 100 mm DTT (data not shown), whereas 3 mm oxidized glutathione completely inhibited the renaturation of CAD (Fig. 3 A). Many chaperones require ATP to fold the target protein (23.Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3077) Google Scholar, 24.Jakob U. Buchner J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 205-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 25.Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2397) Google Scholar). In contrast, the renaturation of CAD under reducing conditions with ICAD-L was not affected by the addition of ATP or apyrase. ICAD has two different forms (ICAD-L and ICAD-S), which are generated by alternative splicing (26.Kawane K. Fukuyama H. Adachi M. Sakahira H. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Nagata S. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We and others (17.Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15740-15744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 27.Gu J. Dong R.P. Zhang C. McLaughlin D.F. Wu M.X. Schlossman S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20759-20762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) have previously shown that ICAD-L but not ICAD-S can enhance synthesis of functional CAD in an in vitro transcription and translation coupled system. Accordingly, the recombinant ICAD-L but not ICAD-S could efficiently stimulate the renaturation of CAD (Fig. 3 B). Maximal renaturation of CAD was obtained in the presence of near equimolar ICAD-L and CAD concentrations, suggesting that CAD forms a one-to-one complex with ICAD-L during its renaturation. The renaturation of CAD is a rather slow process; it took about 30 min for the reaction to be completed at 30 °C (Fig. 3 C). Other components in the reaction mixture such as 20% glycerol and 0.5m NaCl were also required for the ICAD-dependent renaturation of CAD, because their removal from the renaturation buffer severely slowed the reaction (data not shown). ICAD inhibits the DNase of CAD but not DNase I (11.Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2784) Google Scholar). Similarly, ICAD-L had no effect on the renaturation of denatured DNase I (data not shown). The above results indicated that functional CAD can be produced from denatured CAD by refolding in the presence of ICAD-L. This procedure was used to produce functional CAD from protein synthesized in E. coli. Mouse CAD was synthesized inE. coli using the pET expression system (21.Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5981) Google Scholar) (Fig.4 A). Most of the 40-kDa mouse CAD was recovered as inclusion bodies. The purity of the protein was about 50%, but it had no DNase activity. This CAD protein, when denatured with 7 m guanidine hydrochloride, could then be renatured in an ICAD-L-dependent manner, and a large amount of the DNase activity was recovered in the soluble fraction (Fig.4 B). The GST-ICAD-L·CAD complex was then purified by chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose and Mono S column. As shown in Fig. 4 C, the purified protein existed as a complex of the 62-kDa GST-ICAD-L and the 40-kDa CAD as indicated by its mobility on an a SDS-polyacrylamide gel. This complex had DNase activity when it was assayed in the presence of caspase 3, and its specific activity was similar to that obtained with the recombinant F-ICAD-L·CAD complex produced in Sf9 cells (17.Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15740-15744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The above results indicate that the denatured CAD could be refolded in the presence of ICAD-L. However, the conditions for this refolding were rather extreme, that is 100 mm DTT, 20% glycerol, and 0.5 m NaCl. On the other hand, functional CAD could be produced in the reticulocyte lysates in the presence of ICAD-L under physiological conditions, although a high concentration of DTT enhanced the production of functional CAD in this system (Fig.2 B). These results indicate that the reticulocyte lysates may contain a factor(s) that enhances the correct folding of CAD or that prevents the aggregation of the nascent CAD peptides. To examine this possibility, the denatured CAD was diluted with buffer D, which lacks glycerol and 0.5 m NaCl but contains 10 mm DTT. Under these conditions, the denatured CAD could not be renatured, even in the presence of ICAD-L (Fig.5 A). However, the addition of the reticulocyte lysates to this mixture stimulated the renaturation of the denatured CAD in a dose-dependent manner. This process required ATP and was time-dependent, that is no renaturation of the denatured CAD was observed in the absence of ATP (Fig. 5 A), and it took about 60 min to complete the reaction (Fig. 5 B). Reticulocyte lysates stimulate the renaturation of denatured luciferase by an ATP-dependent process (28.Minami Y. Hohfeld J. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19617-19624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar,29.Frydman J. Nimmesgern E. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1994; 370: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar), but ICAD-L had no effect on this process (data not shown), indicating a specific role for ICAD-L in CAD renaturation. Chaperones are proteins that aid in the correct folding of the nascent polypeptides of various target proteins during synthesis or that help transport proteins into mitochondria or chloroplasts by keeping them in an unfolded state (23.Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3077) Google Scholar, 25.Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2397) Google Scholar, 30.Netzer W.J. Hartl F.U. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 68-73Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Two major chaperone systems have been well characterized for the folding of cytosolic proteins. In one system, heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp70), a eukaryotic homolog of E. coli DnaK, together with Hsp40 (a homolog ofE. coli DnaJ) helps to fold a set of proteins through the expenditure of ATP. In the other system, the chaperonin TCP1-ring complex (TRiC, also called CCT, a homolog of E. coli GroEL) cooperates with another hetero-oligomeric complex called GIM or prefoldin to mediate the folding of polypeptide chains in an ATP-dependent manner (31.Vainberg I.E. Lewis S.A. Rommelaere H. Ampe C. Vandekerckhove J. Klein H.L. Cowan N.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 863-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 32.Siegers K. Waldmann T. Leroux M.R. Grein K. Shevchenko A. Schiebel E. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). These two systems work as general chaperones, that is they facilitate the folding of many different proteins, although recent analysis indicates that only about 20% of newly synthesized polypeptides transiently bind Hsp70 (Hsc70) and only 15% associate with TRiC (33.Thulasiraman V. Yang C.F. Frydman J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). These results suggest that there are other chaperone systems or that different polypeptides have different and specific mechanisms for folding during their synthesis. Since the functional CAD was not synthesized in reticulocyte lysates, or Sf9 cells without ICAD, we proposed that general chaperons cannot fold CAD, and ICAD works as a specific chaperone for CAD (11.Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2784) Google Scholar,17.Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15740-15744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The key properties that characterize a protein as a chaperone are as follows: 1) suppression of aggregation of the target protein during protein folding; 2) suppression of aggregation during protein unfolding; 3) influence on the yield and kinetics of folding; and 4) effects exerted at near-stoichiometric levels (24.Jakob U. Buchner J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 205-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). In this report, we showed in two different assay systems that ICAD-L is indispensable for the refolding of chemically unfolded CAD. In the first assay system (0.5 m NaCl and 20% glycerol), functional CAD could be folded in the presence of a near-stoichiometric concentration of ICAD-L, if the environment contained large amounts of reducing agent. This refolding was inhibited by oxidized glutathione, which may cause disulfide bond formation. The successful folding in the presence of 100 mm DTT confirms that all 14 cysteine residues in mouse CAD are in the reduced thiol form and are probably buried inside the molecule. During the folding of CAD, the stretches of peptides carrying thiol residues were probably partially refolded due to the high salt and glycerol content of the reaction mixture. This form was recognized by ICAD-L, which facilitated the further folding of CAD. In agreement with the properties of other chaperones, but unlike the recently identified Hsp104 (34.Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Cell. 1998; 94: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar), if ICAD-L was added to the refolding mixture after the denatured CAD had been diluted, no functional refolding of CAD was observed (data not shown). These results indicate that the denatured CAD may quickly aggregate, even in the presence of 20% glycerol, 0.5 m NaCl, and 100 mm DTT, and that ICAD-L can prevent this aggregation. Mouse ICAD-S, 66 amino acids shorter at the C terminus than ICAD-L, can inhibit the DNase activity of CAD by forming a complex with CAD (16.Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1408) Google Scholar). However, ICAD-S could not support the folding of CAD, suggesting that the C-terminal 66 amino acid region of ICAD-L is indispensable for recognizing the denatured CAD. In the second refolding system, which does not contain 0.5m NaCl and 20% glycerol, reticulocyte lysates enhanced folding of the denatured CAD in the presence of ICAD-L. In contrast to the first assay system, this reaction required ATP, suggesting that general chaperone systems such as those involving Hsp70 (Hsc70) or TRiC may be involved in the folding of CAD. This situation is similar to that found for the folding of nuclear receptors with Hsp90 (24.Jakob U. Buchner J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 205-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 35.Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1513) Google Scholar). Hsp90 can refold denatured proteins in an ATP-independent manner (36.Wiech H. Buchner J. Zimmermann R. Jakob U. Nature. 1992; 358: 169-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). However, reconstitution experiments with purified glucocorticoid receptor and Hsp90 showed that Hsp70 and other chaperones transiently bind to the unfolded glucocorticoid receptor in an ATP-dependent manner and keep the molecule in the correct state for further folding (37.Hutchison K.A. Dittmar K.D. Czar M.J. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5043-5049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Bose S. Weikl T. Bugl H. Buchner J. Science. 1996; 274: 1715-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 39.Frydman J. Hohfeld J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 87-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). This form of the receptor is transferred to Hsp90 which facilitates its final folding, and thus the newly translated glucocorticoid receptor is recovered as a complex with Hsp90 (40.Dalman F.C. Bresnick E.H. Patel P.D. Perdew G.H. Watson Jr., S.J. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19815-19821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Denis M. Gustafsson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6005-6008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A similar scenario may apply to the folding of CAD, that is when CAD is synthesized on ribosomes, its nascent chain may be recognized by general chaperones and kept in a soluble and aggregation-resistant form. When translation is complete, the folding of CAD could be completed by ICAD-L. If the concentration of ICAD-L added to the re-folding mixture largely exceeded that of CAD, the yield of the functional CAD·ICAD complex decreased, 2H. Sakahira and S. Nagata, unpublished results. suggesting that excess ICAD-L can bind to inappropriate places in the unfolded or partially folded CAD, inhibiting its correct folding. These results, and the lack of ATP dependence for the ICAD-L-mediated folding, suggest that once ICAD-L binds to the unfolded CAD, it remains complexed. In any case, the development of an ATP-dependent CAD-refolding system with the reticulocyte lysates will facilitate the identification of molecules involved in its folding. Hsp90 works as a chaperone not only for a family of nuclear receptors but also for other molecules such as oncogenic tyrosine kinases and cellular serine-threonine kinases (24.Jakob U. Buchner J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 205-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). It also enhances the folding of citrate synthase and the Fab fragment of immunoglobulin in a cell-free system (36.Wiech H. Buchner J. Zimmermann R. Jakob U. Nature. 1992; 358: 169-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 42.Jakob U. Lilie H. Meyer I. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7288-7294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). In contrast, ICAD-L could not enhance the refolding of DNase I or luciferase. Mice deficient in the ICAD gene lack CAD activity, but they show no other deficiency (43.Zhang J. Liu X. Scherer D.C. van Kaer L. Wang X. Xu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12480-12485Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Furthermore, general chaperones such as Hsp70 and GroEL could not enhance the renaturation of CAD in the absence of ICAD (data not shown). These results indicate that ICAD-L is indispensable as a specific chaperone for CAD. How this specificity is determined is not clear. If ICAD-L recognizes the completely unfolded stretches of polypeptides, it may be difficult to explain its specificity. We suggest instead that ICAD-L probably recognizes a partially folded domain of CAD. The N-terminal 80-amino acid region of CAD has significant homology with the corresponding region of ICAD (called the CAD or CIDE domain) (15.Mukae N. Enari M. Sakahira H. Fukuda Y. Inazawa J. Toh H. Nagata S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9123-9128Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 44.Inohara N. Koseki T. Chen S. Wu X. Nunez G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2526-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). It is possible that ICAD-L first recognizes the partially folded CAD domain of CAD through homodimeric interaction. Here, we showed that the functional production of CAD, which is active at the final stage of apoptosis, is regulated by ICAD-L, which acts as a chaperone. Recently, many other molecules involved in apoptosis have been shown to be regulated by chaperones or regulators of chaperone functions. For example, the processing and activation of pro-caspase 3, a key enzyme in the promotion of apoptosis, is regulated by Hsp60 in mitochondria (45.Samali A. Cai J. Zhivotovsky B. Jones D.P.

This partition complex is composed of P1 ParB and <i>Escherichia coli</i> integration host factor (IHF), bound specifically to <i>parS</i>. We have investigated the assembly of ParB at <i>parS</i> and its stoichiometry of binding. Measured by gel mobility shift assays, ParB and IHF bind tightly to <i>parS</i> and form a specific complex, called I + B1. We observed that as ParB concentration was increased, a second, larger complex (I + B2) formed, followed by the formation of larger complexes, indicating that additional ParB molecules joined the initial complex. Shift Western blotting experiments indicated that the I + B2 complex contained twice as much ParB as the I + B1 complex. Using mixtures of ParB and a larger polyhistidine-tagged version of ParB (His-ParB) in DNA binding assays, we determined that the initial I + B1 complex contains one dimer of ParB. Therefore, one dimer of ParB binds to its recognition sequences that span an IHF-directed bend in<i>parS</i>.

Due to the crucial role of WI-1 in adherence and disease pathogenesis, we investigated how the protein localizes to the surface of B. dermatitidis. WI-1 released extracellularly by wild-type yeast coated the surfaces of co-cultured knockout yeast within 3 h of incubation, implying that secreted WI-1 provides a pathway for loading the protein onto the yeast cell wall. In radioligand binding assays, purified WI-1 bound saturably, specifically, and with high affinity (K d = 8.3 × 10−9) to the cell surface of knockout yeast devoid of WI-1. WI-1 added exogenously,in vitro, to knockout yeast was indistinguishable from native cell surface WI-1 by fluorescence staining and restored adhesivity to the knockout yeast in macrophage binding and phagocytosis assays. Analysis of interactions between WI-1 and elements of the yeast cell wall identified chitin as the anchor point for WI-1. This interaction was shown to hinge on the 24-amino acid tandem repeat sequence of WI-1. Efforts to extract surface WI-1 from the yeast demonstrated that it is fastened to the wall by non-covalent interactions and covalent links between cysteine residues. We conclude that the yeast cell surface adhesin WI-1 localizes to the cell wall, in part, through extracellular release followed by high affinity binding back onto exposed chitin fibrils. These findings point to a novel pathway of cell wall biogenesis in yeast and an unanticipated role for chitin in anchoring and displaying a surface adhesin and virulence determinant.

Vergeront J.M. Weeks R.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1986; 314: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). At the elevated temperature of 37 °C in a host, the fungus undergoes a phase transition to the pathogenic yeast form. A 120-kDa protein on the cell wall of B. dermatitidis yeast, designated WI-1, plays a crucial role in the establishment of pulmonary infection and its dissemination to visceral organs (2.Brandhorst T.T. Wüthrich M. Warner T. Klein B.S. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1207-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). WI-1 promotes yeast adherence to and phagocytosis by macrophages through binding of CD11b/CD18 and CD14 receptors (3.Newman S.L. Chaturvedi S. Klein B.S. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 753-761Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Structurally, the WI-1 adhesin consists of a short amino-terminal region, a 24-amino acid repeat, which is present in 30 copies and arrayed in tandem within the core of the protein, and a carboxyl-terminal region that has homology to epidermal growth factor (4.Hogan L.H. Josvai S. Klein B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30725-30732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). According to Chou-Fasman predictions (5.Levitt M. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4277-4285Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 6.Klein B.S. Hogan L.H. Jones J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 330-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the tandem repeats in the core of the protein are likely to assume an α-helical conformation, suggesting a tendency toward an elongated overall structure. WI-1 contains few small amino acid residues (4.Hogan L.H. Josvai S. Klein B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30725-30732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), which supports the notion that it may adopt a rod-like configuration due to a reduced flexibility. It contains 95 residues of tyrosine and an impressive 146 residues of tryptophan (4.Hogan L.H. Josvai S. Klein B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30725-30732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), representing a substantial metabolic investment by B. dermatitidis. WI-1 also has 90 cysteine residues, 2 within each tandem repeat, which could be involved in covalent bonding within or between WI-1 molecules or between WI-1 and cell wall structural proteins. A strain of B. dermatitidis in which the WI-1 locus has been targeted and disrupted by gene replacement was recently engineered by this laboratory (2.Brandhorst T.T. Wüthrich M. Warner T. Klein B.S. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1207-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Strain 55 is devoid of WI-1 protein but is otherwise viable and morphologically similar to the parent strain, ATCC 26199. Nevertheless, strain 55 binds poorly to macrophages in vitro and to lung tissue ex vivo and is avirulent in a murine model of pulmonary infection (2.Brandhorst T.T. Wüthrich M. Warner T. Klein B.S. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1207-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Despite the indispensible role of WI-1 in mediating adherence and pathogenicity of B. dermatitidis, it is not known how this protein localizes to the yeast cell wall and surface. There is no evidence of glycosylation or a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor in the mature protein (7.Audet R. Brandhorst T.T. Klein B.S. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 11: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). A secretion signal identified in the WI-1 cDNA is removed during processing, and B. dermatitidisyeast can release up to 25 mg of WI-1 per liter of medium during growth in liquid culture (7.Audet R. Brandhorst T.T. Klein B.S. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 11: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 8.Klein B.S. Chaturvedi S. Hogan L.H. Jones J.M. Newman S.L. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 3536-3542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, much of the WI-1 that is produced decorates the surfaces of yeast cells (9.Klein B.S. Jones J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 152-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These findings raise the possibility that WI-1 is being shed after it reaches its destination on the surface or that it is in transit to the surface after being released extracellularly, as part of the process of cell wall biogenesis. In this study, we sought to elucidate how WI-1 localizes to the yeast cell wall and what role, if any, the extracellular pool of released WI-1 plays in the process of cell wall biogenesis. We also wished to identify the cell wall elements that bind WI-1 and the sequence(s) of WI-1 that mediate this interaction. The availability of isogenic yeast strains that lack or contain WI-1 allowed us to analyze, in real time, the extracellular transfer of WI-1 between yeast cells of each strain and the interaction of purified WI-1 with cell wall components of the knockout strain. We report here a novel mechanism of protein loading onto the yeast cell surface, which entails the initial release of WI-1 into an extracellular pool, followed by its reattachment through binding surface chitin fibrils in a specific, high affinity interaction via the tandem repeat. Calcofluor (fluorescent brightener 28), chitin, cellulose, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)1-labeled wheat germ agglutinin, and FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies were obtained from Sigma.

Zymolyase was purchased from Zymo Research, Orange, CA. Uvitex 2B stain was obtained from Specialty Chemicals for Medical Diagnostics, Kandern, Germany. Monoclonal antibody (mAb) DD5-CB4 reactive against the 25-amino acid repeat sequence of WI-1 (10.Green, J. H., Harell, W. K., and Aloisio, C.

C.Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Sandra Bragg (Centers for Disease Control). American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) strain 26199 of B. dermatitidis was used in this study (ATCC, Manassas, VA), along with the WI-1 knockout strain 55 derived from it (2.Brandhorst T.T. Wüthrich M. Warner T. Klein B.S. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1207-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and the WI-1 knockout strain 99 derived from ATCC 60915. Stock cultures were maintained in the yeast form on 7H10 agar slants enriched with oleic acid-albumin complex (Sigma) at 37 °C. Liquid cultures were grown in Erlenmeyer flasks containingHistoplasma-Macrophage Medium (HMM) (11.Worsham P.L. Goldman W.E. J. Med. Vet. Mycol. 1988; 26: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) at 37 °C in a gyratory shaker at 150 rpm. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains ECY36-3A (MATα chs1-23 ura3-52 leu2-2 trp1-1) and ECY36-3D (MATa chs1-23 chs3 ura3-52 leu2-2 trp1-1) (12.Shaw J.A. Mol P.C. Bowers B. Silverman S.J. Valdivieso M.H. Duran A. Cabib E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Enrico Cabib (NIDDKD, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). Strains of S. cerevisiae were grown on Yeast Peptone Dextrose (YPD) agar media at 37 °C. Wangiella dermatitidis strain 8656 (wild type) and mutants wdchs 1,2,3 and wdchs 1,3,4 were kindly provided by Paul Szaniszlo (Department of Microbiology, University of Texas, Austin) and maintained on YPD as above. Histoplasma capsulatum strains G217B, G184AR, and G184AS were kindly provided by Jon Woods (Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, University of Wisconsin, Madison) and were maintained on HMM or brain heart infusion media (Difco). To investigate extracellular transfer of WI-1, isogenic strains 26199 (wild-type) and 55 (WI-1 knockout) were co-cultured. Yeasts were harvested from slants in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and washed five times with distilled H2O (dH2O) to remove loosely associated protein. 107 yeast of each strain were combined in 10 ml of HMM in a 25-ml shake flask and incubated at 37 °C. At serial time intervals, 0.75-ml aliquots were removed and fixed in 0.25% glutaraldehyde and 0.75% paraformaldehyde buffered with PBS. Yeast were fixed for 10 min, pelleted, and resuspended in 150 mmglycine for an additional 10 min to occupy unreacted aldehyde groups. Fixed yeast were washed twice with PBS and stained for WI-1 and analysis by flow cytometry as described below. WI-1 was purified as described (7.Audet R. Brandhorst T.T. Klein B.S. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 11: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, yeasts were grown in liquid HMM in a gyratory shaker at 37 °C for 2 weeks. WI-1 was purified from the supernatants in a two-step process using anion-exchange chromatography followed by hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Homogeneity was assessed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. A crude H2O extract of WI-1 was obtained by washing 1 × 107 26199 yeast off of a 2-day-old 7H10 slant with PBS, pelleting the yeast in a microcentrifuge, and then washing the yeasts repeatedly in 2-ml volumes of dH2O for 20 min at 37 °C. The first, second, and third dH2O washes were then combined. These washes contained all of the WI-1 that could be collected by dH2O extraction. Immunofluorescence staining was performed as described (3.Newman S.L. Chaturvedi S. Klein B.S. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 753-761Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Hogan L.H. Josvai S. Klein B.S. J. Biol.

Briefly, 106yeasts were stained for WI-1 indirectly using 1 μg of anti-WI-1 mAb DD5-CB4 in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) followed by goat anti-mouse (GAM) IgG-FITC. Stained cells were inspected for fluorescence microscopically using an Olympus BX60 fluorescent microscope (Leeds Precision Instruments, Inc., Minneapolis, MN) or a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA).

Mφ were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with heat-inactivated 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone Laboratories Inc., Logan, UT), 10% NCTC-109 medium, and 1% nonessential amino acids (Life Technologies, Inc.). Mφ were plated at 2.5 × 105 cells/well in 16-well tissue culture chamber slides (Nunc Inc., Naperville, IL) and were incubated overnight at 37 °C, 8% CO2. Binding and phagocytosis of yeast were analyzed in vitro as described (14.Mukherjee J. Zuckier L.S. Scharff M.D. Casadevall A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 580-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 15.Zebedee S.L. Koduri R.K. Mukherjee J. Mukherjee S. Lee S. Sauer D.F. Scharff M.D. Casadevall A. Antimicrob.

Briefly, yeast were heat-killed for 45 min at 65 °C and Mφ and yeast were incubated together at an effector-to-target ratio of 1:4 for varying periods at 37 °C, 8% CO2. Unattached yeast were removed by washing wells three times with PBS. Attached but uningested yeast were stained with 0.1% Uvitex 2B for 30 s. To quantify binding and phagocytosis, the number of yeast attached to and ingested by 100 Mφ was counted at × 400 magnification using a U-MWU fluorescence cube in an Olympus BX60 microscope. Binding is defined as the number of attached and ingested yeast per 100 Mφ. Phagocytosis is defined as the number of yeast ingested per 100 Mφ. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of three experiments in which 100 Mφ were analyzed per experiment. WI-1 (0.3 mg) was radiolabeled with 1.0 mCi of Na125I using IODO-BEADS, as per manufacturer's instructions (Pierce), to a specific activity of 104 μCi/μg. Cold WI-1 was used to dilute the specific activity to 2.9 μCi/μg. Cells of strain 55 were heat-killed as above and washed three times with dH2O. Yeast (106) in 100 μl of distilled H2O were combined with serial dilutions of125I-WI-1 (40 to 0.78 μg) in 100 μl of TBS. Cells were incubated with agitation for 60 min at 25 °C, followed by centrifugation through a layer of silicon:paraffin oil (81:19) to separate bound and free ligand. Tubes were snipped so that bound and free counts could be measured separately in a Packard Multi-Prias 4 gamma counter (Packard Instrument Co.). Nonspecific binding for each cell type was determined by adding a 100-fold molar excess of cold WI-1 to a duplicate set of tubes containing the median quantity of labeled WI-1 used in the assay. The percentage of nonspecific cpm bound was subtracted from the total cpm bound for each data point to determine the level of specific binding. Scatchard binding analysis was performed on the data with the aid of Equilibrium Binding Data Analysis software as described (17.deJong J.L.O. Farner N.L. Widmer M.B. Giri J.G. Sondel P.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1339-1348PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast were heat-killed as above. Cells (106) were aliquoted into microcentrifuge tubes and treated as follows: laminarinase treatment utilized 0.5 milliunits of the enzyme in 1 ml of 100 mmsodium acetate, pH 5, at 37 °C for 2 h with agitation (18.Schreuder M.P. Brekelmans S. Van Den Ende H. Klis-Frans M. Yeast. 1993; 9: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Zymolyase treatment utilized 50 μl of the enzyme in 1 ml of TBS, pH 7, at 37 °C for 2 h with agitation (19.Pierce M. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3576-3582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chitinase treatment utilized 2 mg of the enzyme in 1 ml of TBS, pH 7, with 0.1m EDTA and 48 mm mercaptoethanol, at 37 °C for 2 h with agitation (19.Pierce M. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3576-3582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Crowe H.M. Levitz S.M. Sugar A.M. Exp. Mycol. 1987; 11: 159-161Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Lipase treatment utilized 2 mg of lipase and 0.2 mg of phospholipase A2 in 1 ml of TBS, pH 7, and 10 mm CaCl2, at 37 °C for 2 h with agitation (21.Menashe M. Romero G. Biltonen R.L. Lichtenberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5328-5333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protease treatment utilized 10 mg of Pronase, 2 mg of proteinase K, and 10 mg of protease from S. griseus in 1 ml of TBS with 10 mm DTT, at 24 °C for 2 h with agitation (19.Pierce M. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3576-3582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Leusch H. Curr. Microbiol. 1989; 19: 193-198Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Acid hydrolysis utilized 1 ml of 2 mHCl at 100 °C for 2 h (19.Pierce M. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3576-3582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alkaline hydrolysis utilized 1 ml of 1 m NaOH at 37 °C for 2 h with agitation (19.Pierce M. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3576-3582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chitin in the cell walls of wild-type yeast, genetically altered yeast, and chitinase-treated yeast was detected by staining with Calcofluor white at 25 μg/ml or wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)-FITC at 0.1 mg/ml in TBS. Staining was for 30 min at 24 °C, and cells were washed three times with TBS. Cells were examined for fluorescence microscopically as above and on a FACStar plus flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) with a multiline UV laser exciter. The preparation of recombinant WI-1 fragments has been described previously (33.Chang W.L. Audet R.G. Aizenstein B.D. Hogan L.H. DeMars R.I. Klein B. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 502-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, nested deletions of genomic WI-1 DNA (strain 26199) were made with exonuclease III (Erase-a-base, Promega, Madison, WI). Subclones H4D, H11, and H13 of the tandem repeat were selected by size from minipreps. They were purified and ligated in-frame to nucleotides coding for a 6-histidine tag in the expression plasmid pQE32 (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). DNA encoding the amino terminus was generated by restricting the WI-1 genomic clone with BsgI and KpnI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), dropping out DNA encoding the carboxyl terminus and all tandem repeats. The DNA was ligated into pQE32 as above. DNA encoding the carboxyl terminus fragment was derived from a B. dermatitidis (ATCC strain 60636) cDNA expression library (6.Klein B.S. Hogan L.H. Jones J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 330-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and cloned as above. Recombinant WI-1 fragments were expressed inEscherichia coli XL1-Blue and purified by affinity to nickel-agarose according to the manufacturer's specifications (Qiagen). In previous work (7.Audet R. Brandhorst T.T. Klein B.S. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 11: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 8.Klein B.S. Chaturvedi S. Hogan L.H. Jones J.M. Newman S.L. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 3536-3542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we found that B. dermatitidis yeast release WI-1 extracellularly. Either the WI-1 adhesin is not inviolably bound to the cell surface, or this extracellular pool of WI-1 is an intermediate stage in the delivery of the adhesin to the cell surface, or both. We investigated these possibilities. A portion of the WI-1 protein on the surface of B. dermatitidis yeast could be extracted by washes with dH2O (Fig. 1). This property is reminiscent of the surface array proteins fromCampylobacter fetus, which are released from the bacterial surface under conditions of calcium depletion (24.Yang L. Pei Z. Fujimoto S. Blaser M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1258-1267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Release of surface WI-1 by dH2O was similarly inhibitable by inclusion of low concentrations of divalent calcium (≤5 mm) or cobalt (≤10 mm) or higher concentrations (>10 mm) of magnesium. Monovalent cations such as lithium (Fig. 1) and trivalent cations such as Fe(III) (not shown) inhibited release only poorly, as in C. fetus. These parallels between B. dermatitidis and Campylobacter suggested the possibility that WI-1 could be induced to bind to cell surfaces devoid of WI-1 in the same way that surface array proteins can be reattached to stripped C. fetus cells. If so, this property would allow us to elucidate the nature of the interaction of WI-1 with cell wall components. Purified WI-1 (20 μg) or a dH2O extract of B. dermatitidis yeast (ATCC 26199) enriched for WI-1 was added to cells of the WI-1 null strain 55. Cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, washed three times in PBS, and subjected to immunofluorescence staining for WI-1. Strain 55 cells became uniformly coated with WI-1 so that they resembled strain 26199, both by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry (Fig.2 A). Purified WI-1 and dH2O extracts of 26199 (enriched for WI-1) were comparable in their ability to coat yeast surfaces. The coating of strain 55 yeast could also be achieved by co-culture with the parental strain, 26199 (see below). Thus, strain 55 could serve as a suitable target for ligand/receptor analysis. Interaction of WI-1 with the cell wall of strain 55 yeast was investigated further by tracking the binding of radiolabeled WI-1. Scatchard analysis of the WI-1 binding profile yielded a linear relationship between bound WI-1 and the ratio of bound:free WI-1 (Fig. 2 B). Labeled WI-1 bound to strain 55 saturably and specifically, yielding a high affinity constant (K d = 8.3 × 10−9) between WI-1 ligand and its cell surface receptor(s). Cold competition with a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled WI-1 nearly abolished radioligand binding and demonstrated that ∼1% of the radioligand bound nonspecifically. Up to 4 × 105 WI-1 molecules could bind an individual yeast cell of strain 55 under the conditions of this assay. Thus, WI-1 added in vitro will coat the surface of yeast. Therefore, an external pool of WI-1 released by actively growing yeast in vivo could potentially be captured by the surface elements of nascent cells, coating the cells during the natural process of cell wall biogenesis. To investigate whether WI-1 released from wild-type 26199 yeast could bind directly to the surface of WI-1 knockout yeast under normal growth conditions, we co-cultured the two strains together in liquid HMM. At the initiation of the experiment, the two strains were discernible by FACS, appearing as two distinct histogram peaks, one strain with abundant WI-1 (26199) and the other with none (Fig.2 C). With increasing duration of co-culture, the WI-1 knockout yeast became coated with WI-1, presumably binding WI-1 freshly secreted by 26199. By 3 h of co-culture, the two strains were indistinguishable (Fig. 2 C). They displayed equivalent amounts of surface WI-1 by FACS, as indicated by a homogeneous, single peak. The average doubling time of B. dermatitidis is about 17 h (2.Brandhorst T.T. Wüthrich M. Warner T. Klein B.S. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1207-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), making it unlikely that one strain had overgrown the other during this short time interval. To confirm that this had not occurred, we plated the mixed population of yeast onto solid agar in the presence and absence of selection with 100 μg/ml hygromycin B (The WI-1 locus had been replaced in strain 55 with the gene for hygromycin B resistance (2.Brandhorst T.T. Wüthrich M. Warner T. Klein B.S. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1207-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar).). Twice the number of colonies grew out in the absence of hygromycin B as in the presence of the antibiotic, indicating that the two strains were equally represented in the mixed culture after 3 h of growth. Thus, WI-1 released from wild-type yeast is transferred and reattaches to the surface of knockout yeast rapidly during co-culture, well before yeast double. To assess whether WI-1 attached exogenously to strain 55 confers expected adhesive function, we investigated WI-1-mediated interactions with Mφ in binding and phagocytosis assays. Yeast cells of strain 55 were first coated with WI-1 from a dH2O extract of wild-type yeast as above. Coating of strain 55 with WI-1 enhanced the binding and phagocytosis of yeast by 10-fold, when compared with the uncoated strain 55 (Fig.3). Thus, the adhesive function of WI-1 could be imparted by coating yeast cells in vitro with exogenous protein. However, such yeast demonstrated lower Mφ binding and entry than the wild-type, suggesting that full reconstitution of WI-1 on the yeast cell surface may require conditions that are not reproduced precisely in vitro. To elucidate the linkage of WI-1 with the cell surface under normal growth conditions, we analyzed wild-type yeast cultured in liquid medium. First, as shown above, a dH2O wash releases a large amount of surface WI-1. This finding, together with prior data on cation inhibition (Fig. 1), indicates a cation-dependent, non-covalent bond. Second, boiling in 1% SDS releases additional WI-1 resistant to extraction with dH2O (Fig. 4), indicating a cation-independent, non-covalent bond. Third, the inclusion of 100 mm DTT in further SDS washes releases still more WI-1, indicating that some WI-1 is covalently bound to cell wall elements through cysteine-cysteine disulfide bonds. SDS-DTT treatment fails to remove all of the residual WI-1 from 26199 (see below), indicating that there may be additional covalent linkages. FACS analysis and fluorescence histograms were used to compare and contrast the WI-1 linkage on surfaces of in vitro coated strain 55versus parental strain 26199 grown in liquid broth. WI-1 that had been bound in vitro to the surface of strain 55 could not be re-extracted by simple dH2O washes, which contrasts with wild-type yeast (data not shown). However, much of the surface adhesin on strain 55 could be stripped away by treatment with hot 1% SDS (Fig. 5). In contrast, 26199 cells treated with hot SDS unexpectedly showed an increase in fluorescence intensity (Fig.5), implying substantial residual WI-1 on yeast, even though PAGE gels showed that a large amount of WI-1 is stripped from 26199 by this treatment (Fig. 4). Results were similar when DTT was included in SDS washes. Thus, after these treatments, most of the WI-1 on strain 55 was removed, whereas substantial WI-1 remained on the surface of strain 26199, possibly through covalent bonds that can be formed only immediately after release or when WI-1 enters the cell wall via a different pathway than release and reattachment. We tested the possibility that freshly released WI-1 was more likely to bond covalently with elements of the yeast cell surface than WI-1 that had been extracted and/or purified and added in vitro. To expose strain 55 yeast to freshly released WI-1, cells were co-cultured, as before, in the same shaker flask as the parental strain, 26199. The two strains appeared equally coated with WI-1 within 3 h (Fig. 5), forming a single peak in the fluorescence histogram. WI-1 bound to strain 55 in this manner proved to be more resistant to treatment with hot 1% SDS. The histogram of the SDS treated co-culture developed a shoulder of slightly diminished fluorescence, but the majority of WI-1 was not stripped from 55 by this treatment. When DTT was added to SDS washes, two clear peaks emerged, implying that WI-1 was stripped preferentially from co-cultured 55. Nevertheless, this second peak of lower fluorescence intensity demonstrated far more WI-1 retention than the in vitro coated, SDS/DTT-treated cells of strain 55, implying that a portion of the WI-1 on co-cultured strain 55 was resistant to DTT, as in wild-type 26199.

Glutamine is hydrolyzed to glutamate plus NH3 at an N-terminal glutaminase site, and NH3 is transferred through a 20-Å hydrophobic channel to a distal PRPP site for synthesis of phosphoribosylamine. Binding of PRPP is required to activate the glutaminase site (termed interdomain signaling) to prevent the wasteful hydrolysis of glutamine in the absence of phosphoribosylamine synthesis. Mutations were constructed to analyze the function of the NH3 channel. In the wild type enzyme, NH3derived from glutamine hydrolysis was transferred to the PRPP site, and little or none was released. Replacement of Leu-415 at the PRPP end of the channel with an alanine resulted in a leaky channel and release of NH3 to the solvent. Mutations in five amino acids that line the channel and two other residues required for the reorganization of phosphoribosyltransferase domain “flexible loop” that leads to formation of the channel perturbed channel function as well as interdomain signaling.

The enzyme is a member of an Ntn, N-terminal nucleophile family of glutamine amidotransferases (1.Zalkin H. Smith J.L. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 87-144PubMed Google Scholar). The overall reaction, shown by Equation 1, takes place in two steps at active sites in two domains. Glutamine+PRPP+H2O→PRA+Glutamate+PPiEquation 1 Glutamine+H2O→Glutamate+NH3Equation 2 PRPP+NH3→PRA+PPiEquation 3 An N-terminal glutaminase domain is responsible for hydrolysis of glutamine (Equation 2). NH3 derived from glutamine hydrolysis reacts with PRPP at a site in the C-terminal PRTase domain (Equation 3). Crystal structures have been determined for a ligand-free (2.Muchmore C.R.A. Krahn J.M. Kim J.H. Zalkin H. Smith J.L. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and an enzyme-substrate analog ternary complex (3.Krahn J.M. Kim J.H. Burns M.R. Parry R.J. Zalkin H. Smith J.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11061-11068Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In the ligand-free enzyme, denoted state I, the two active sites are separated by 16 Å, and neither of the sites is properly organized for catalysis. The PRPP site is open to the solvent such that bound substrate would be susceptible to hydrolysis. The glutamine site in the ligand-free enzyme is in a closed conformation, unfavorable for entry of glutamine, and Arg-73, a residue required for glutamine binding, is extensively hydrogen-bonded and unavailable for interaction with the glutamine α-carboxyl group. In the crystal structure of the ternary complex, designated state III, conformational changes have optimized the two sites for catalysis, and a 20-Å hydrophobic tunnel has formed to channel NH3 derived from glutamine hydrolysis to the PRPP site. There are thus several functional consequences resulting from PRPP binding. First, binding of PRPP activates the glutamine site by lowering the K m for glutamine by 100-fold and increasing k cat by 3-fold (4.Kim J.H. Krahn J.M. Tomchick D.R. Smith J.L. Zalkin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15549-15557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This interdomain signaling prevents the wasteful hydrolysis of glutamine in the absence of PRA synthesis. Formation of the NH3 channel is a second consequence of PRPP binding. This channel, which connects the physically separated active sites, provides the mechanism to sequester NH3 from solvent and to deliver it to the PRTase domain for nucleophilic attack at C1 of PRPP. NH4+is not a substrate, and it is therefore important to prevent protonation of NH3 derived from glutamine hydrolysis. Molecular interactions important for interdomain signaling were first inferred from the crystal structures of the state I and state III conformers and from an earlier analysis of Tyr-74 mutant enzymes (4.Kim J.H. Krahn J.M. Tomchick D.R. Smith J.L. Zalkin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15549-15557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). According to the structure-based mechanism (5.Smith J.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 8: 686-694Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar), PRPP binding results in a reorganization of a PRTase flexible loop (residues 326–350), which closes over the PRPP site and forms the NH3 channel. Interaction of PRTase loop residue Ile-335 with “glutamine loop” residue Tyr-74 is one consequence of flexible loop ordering. This signaling interaction repositions the glutamine loop and moves Arg-73 for an optimal salt bridge with the carboxyl of glutamine, which is required for high affinity glutamine binding. The interdomain signaling steps that activate the glutamine site in response to PRPP binding have recently been monitored through changes in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence in enzymes engineered to contain single tryptophan reporters (6.Chen S. Burgner J.W. Krahn J. Zalkin H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11659-11669Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 7.Bera A.K. Chen S. Smith J.L. Zalkin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36498-36504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Interestingly, replacements of Ile-335 or Tyr-74 were shown not only to perturb the interdomain signaling that activates the glutamine site but also to perturb channel function. Here we report results of a mutational analysis of conserved, non-polar amino acid residues in the NH3 channel as well as key amino acids in the PRTase flexible loop. Ordering of the flexible loop is a prerequisite for channel formation. The results indicate that channel function and interdomain signaling are coupled. Wild typeEscherichia coli glutamine PRPP amidotransferase was produced in E. coli strain B834 (DE3) from plasmid pETpurF as described previously (6.Chen S. Burgner J.W. Krahn J. Zalkin H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11659-11669Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Mutations were constructed by the procedure of Kunkel et al. (8.Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Koukour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar). Two series of recombinant proteins were constructed. The first series of mutant enzymes was derived from the wild type and contains single amino acid replacements. This series of mutant enzymes was used to assay enzyme activity andK m for substrates. The second series of enzymes was constructed to assay ligand binding using intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (6.Chen S. Burgner J.W. Krahn J. Zalkin H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11659-11669Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A parental enzyme with C1S/W290F/S345W mutations has been described (6.Chen S. Burgner J.W. Krahn J. Zalkin H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11659-11669Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The C1S mutation prevents turnover of the enzyme substrate complex. W290F removes the single tryptophan in the wild type enzyme. S345W provides a single tryptophan reporter in the PRTase flexible loop. Amino acid replacements were introduced into this parental enzyme to probe channel function and signaling. Glutamine PRPP amidotransferase was purified as described previously (6.Chen S. Burgner J.W. Krahn J. Zalkin H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11659-11669Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Glycinamide ribonucleotide synthetase, used for assay of PRA, was overproduced and purified as described (6.Chen S. Burgner J.W. Krahn J. Zalkin H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11659-11669Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Standard assays were used for glutamine PRPP amidotransferase. The production of glutamate, referred to as glutaminase, and PRA, referred to as Gln-PRA, was determined as described (6.Chen S. Burgner J.W. Krahn J. Zalkin H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11659-11669Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the Gln-PRA assay, PRA production is coupled to the synthesis of glycinamide ribonucleotide using an excess of glycinamide ribonucleotide synthetase. In cases where saturation by glutamine was not achieved in the standard assay, maximal velocity was extrapolated from plots of data fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation using Ultrafit software (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). For all assays, one enzyme unit gives the production of 1.0 μmol of product/min at 37 °C. Specific activity is units/mg of protein. Protein was determined byA 278 using the value 8.2 for a 1% solution (9.Messenger L.J. Zalkin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3382-3392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Release of nonchanneled NH3 derived from glutamine hydrolysis in the Gln-PRA reaction was determined using glutamate dehydrogenase. After the Gln-PRA reaction was stopped by heating for 1 min in a boiling water bath, an aliquot was transferred to a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 5 mm α- ketoglutarate, 250 μm NADPH, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 2.8 units of glutamate dehydrogenase. The absorbance at 340 nm was measured after the reaction was completed at room temperature for 5 min. Channel efficiency was calculated from the ratio of Gln-PRA to glutaminase activities. For the wild type enzyme, NH3 derived from glutamine hydrolysis was expected to be channeled to the PRPP site and used for synthesis of PRA, thus giving a 1:1 stoichiometry between glutamate and PRA. The experimentally determined Gln-PRA:glutaminase ratio was normalized to 1.0 for the wild type enzyme. Corresponding values for mutant enzymes were determined and compared with the wild type. All fluorescence measurements were carried out in enzymes containing a single tryptophan reporter. Intrinsic fluorescence of Trp-345 was used to monitor conformational changes resulting from binding of PRPP to the ligand-free enzyme and binding of glutamine to the enzyme-PRPP complex (6.Chen S. Burgner J.W. Krahn J. Zalkin H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11659-11669Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).K d values for substrates were determined exactly as described (6.Chen S. Burgner J.W. Krahn J. Zalkin H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11659-11669Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). According to the glutamine PRPP amidotransferase structure-based mechanism (5.Smith J.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 8: 686-694Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar), NH3 derived from glutamine hydrolysis must be sequestered from solvent and channeled to the PRTase site for reaction with PRPP. The results of two experiments, shown in Figs. 1 and2, provide direct evidence for channeling of NH3 between sites in the glutaminase and PRTase domains. Data in Fig. 1 show the concentration dependence of glutamine and of NH4Cl for PRA synthesis at pH 7.0. The initial rate of PRA synthesis using glutamine as the nitrogen donor was 70 times faster than with an equivalent concentration of NH4Cl. Clearly, NH3 derived from hydrolysis of glutamine cannot be released from the enzyme and equilibrated with NH4+ in the solvent. The data in Fig.2 A show that for the wild type enzyme the coupling between the two half-reactions, glutamine hydrolysis and synthesis of PRA, was greater than 90%, and detection of released NH3 was barely perceptable. We have not determined whether the small difference between the rates of glutaminase and Gln-PRA reactions seen in Fig.2 A is due to imperfect channeling of NH3 or to the lability of PRA (10.Schendel F.J. Cheng Y.S. Otvos J.D. Wehrli S. Stubbe J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2614-2623Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and less than 100% coupling with glycinamide ribonucleotide synthetase in vitro. In either case, the data in Fig. 2 A demonstrate the interdomain channeling of NH3.Figure 2Measurement of products in the Gln-PRA reaction. The reaction conditions were as described in Fig. 1, except that the glutamine concentration was 20 mm, and the Tris-HCl was pH 7.5.

B, L415A mutant enzyme.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Data in Fig. 2 B show the effects of an L415A mutation that results in a leaky NH3 channel. Leu-415 is at the base of the NH3 channel in the PRTase domain (Fig.3). The rates of the two half-reactions, glutaminase and NH3-PRA, in the L415A enzyme are 1.8- and 1.3- fold higher than the respective activities in the wild type enzyme (Table I). However, the Gln-PRA activity of the mutant, which is dependent upon interdomain channeling of NH3, is only 30% that of the wild type activity. The consequences of the L415A channel defect are seen clearly in Fig.2 B. Approximately 85% of the NH3 derived from glutamine hydrolysis is released from the enzyme, and only about 15% is channeled to the PRTase domain for synthesis of PRA. The data suggest that the smaller side chain in the L415A replacement results in a leaky NH3 channel that perturbs the tight coupling between the two half-reactions. The data in Table I show thatK m values for glutamine and NH3 are similar in the wild type and L415A mutant enzyme.Table IIdentifiction of a leaky channelEnzymeGlutaminaseGln-PRANH3-PRAActivityKm GlnActivityKm GlnActivityKm NH3units/mgmmunits/mgmmunits/mgmmWild type59.5 ± 7.21.57 ± 0.153.8 ± 3.81.66 ± 0.2152 ± 6.210.1 ± 1.7L415A108 ± 101.44 ± 0.117.5 ± 0.71.63 ± 0.3197 ± 126.90 ± 1.1 Open table in a new tab The glutamine PRPP amidotransferase NH3 channel is lined with conserved, mostly nonpolar amino acids. These residues include Tyr-74, Phe-254, Tyr-258, Phe-259, Phe-334, Ile-335, and also Thr-333. The positions of these residues in the enzyme-substrate ternary complex are shown in Fig. 3. To probe their roles, these amino acids were replaced by alanine or by more conservative substitutions. After enzyme purification, several assays were carried out to monitor function of the NH3 channel and interdomain signaling. Interdomain signaling was assessed by measurement of glutamineK d. In the wild type enzyme, PRPP binding to the PRTase domain catalytic site is required for high affinity binding of glutamine and for glutamine site catalysis. An interaction between Ile-335 in the PRTase domain and Tyr-74 in the glutamine domain has been shown to have a primary role in signaling (7.Bera A.K. Chen S. Smith J.L. Zalkin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36498-36504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The roles of Tyr-74 and Ile-335 in signaling and channel function have been reported and, thus, are not considered in detail here. Channel function was assessed by comparison of the glutaminase and Gln-PRA activities. For the wild type enzyme, the stoichiometry between the products glutamate and PRA is expected to be 1:1, as shown by Equation 1, reflecting stoichiometric transfer of the NH3 derived from glutamine hydrolysis through the NH3 channel to the PRPP site for synthesis of PRA. However, as seen in Table I and in Fig.2 A, Gln-PRA activity was approximately 90% that of the glutaminase activity for the wild type enzyme. The wild type Gln-PRA:glutaminase ratio has been normalized to 1.0 under “Channeling Efficiency” in Table II. For the purpose of this study, departures from the glutaminase:Gln-PRA stoichiometry seen for the wild type enzyme are considered to reflect defective channel function.Table IIMutational analysis of channel function abd signalingEnzymeGlutaminaseChanneling efficiencyaFraction of the NH3 derived from glutamine hydrolysis that was used for synthesis of PRA.

Open table in a new tab To assess the roles of the conserved, nonpolar amino acids that line the NH3 channel, we have mutagenized Phe-254, Tyr-258, Phe-259, and Phe-334, and the results are summarized in Table II. Entries for Tyr-74 and Ile-335 from earlier work (7.Bera A.K. Chen S. Smith J.L. Zalkin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36498-36504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) are also included for comparison. Most of the mutations in the channel residues lead to multiple functional defects. All of the mutant enzymes except for the F259V mutant have perturbations in interdomain signaling as seen in Table II from the increased values of K d for glutamine binding. Each of the mutant enzymes also had some perturbation of channel function as seen from comparison of Gln-PRA activity with the corresponding value for glutaminase activity. In addition to the four nonpolar channel residues and Thr-333, listed in Table II, we also mutagenized two conserved amino acids in the PRTase flexible loop. Binding of PRPP initiates the ordering of the flexible loop and results in formation of the NH3 channel. Of 7 conserved amino acids in the flexible loop (residues 326–350), Arg-332 and Arg-338 are essential and could not be replaced (data not shown), Thr-333 and Phe-334 are included as channel residues, and Ile-335 has a key role in signaling and was examined previously (7.Bera A.K. Chen S. Smith J.L. Zalkin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36498-36504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), thus leaving Pro-337 and Lys-349. Data for the mutant analyses, given in Table II, are analyzed below. The F259V amino acid replacement is the only mutation of a channel residue listed in Table II that did not perturb signaling. The K d for glutamine binding to the F259V enzyme and the glutaminase activity were not changed significantly from the wild type. In addition, PRPP binding affinity was similar to that of the wild type enzyme. Channeling efficiency, as calculated from the Gln-PRA/glutaminase activity ratio, was 0.63 compared with the wild type enzyme. Thus, approximately 40% of the NH3 produced at the glutamine site was not channeled for reaction with PRPP. A decrease in the size of the side chain from valine to alanine at position 259 led to virtually complete loss of glutaminase and Gln-PRA activities in an F259A enzyme (data not shown). Since the F259A enzyme was without activity it is not listed in Table II. Data in Table II indicate that Phe-254 has roles in signaling and channel function. Values of K d for glutamine binding, shown in Table II, were 4-fold and 36-fold higher, respectively, for F254Y and F254V enzymes relative to the wild type. This suggests that transmission of the PRPP binding signal to the glutamine site was perturbed in the F254Y and F254V enzymes. There was a significant increase in K d for PRPP in the F254V enzyme. The basis for this change in PRPP binding affinity is not apparent. Measurements of fluorescence emission of a Trp-345 reporter group were made to examine the role of channel residue Phe-254 in the interdomain signaling. Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence in enzymes engineered to contain a single tryptophan reporter group has been used to monitor conformational changes in glutamine PRPP amidotransferase (6.Chen S. Burgner J.W. Krahn J. Zalkin H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11659-11669Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Fluorescence emission is dependent upon the micro environment of Trp-345 resulting from the conformation of the PRTase flexible loop (residues 326–350). An increase in Trp-345 fluorescence upon binding of PRPP reflects the ordering of the PRTase flexible loop that is required to form the NH3 channel (Fig.4 A). A comparable Trp-345 fluorescence change in the F254V enzyme indicates that this channel mutation did not significantly perturb the ordering of the flexible loop that occurs when PRPP binds (Fig. 4 B). In addition, the PRPP binding signal was communicated to the glutamine site, enabling glutamine to bind, although the K d for glutamine binding, determined by fluorescence titration, was increased by 36-fold compared with the wild type enzyme. An F254A mutation, which abolished glutaminase and Gln-PRA activities (data not shown), inhibited the binding of glutamine to the enzyme PRPP binary complex as detected by the Trp345 reporter (Fig. 4 C). This result emphasizes the importance of a channel residue to interdomain signaling. Data in Table II show reductions of channeling efficiency for the F254Y and F254V enzymes. Channeling efficiency was 0.68 for the F254V enzyme and 0.37 for the F254Y enzyme. Insertion of the hydroxyl group of Tyr-254 into the hydrophobic channel was detrimental to function. As for the Phe-254 mutants, the increasedK d value for glutamine binding and reduced glutaminase activity in the Y258F enzyme indicates a signaling defect in this enzyme. The Tyr-258 mutation also decreased the PRPP binding affinity by 4-fold. A low Gln-PRA to glutaminase activity ratio of 0.08 suggests defective function of the NH3 channel. However, in the case of Tyr-258 mutants, an alternative interpretation for the low Gln-PRA activity must be considered because of a hydrogen bond between the Tyr-258 hydroxyl group and the 02α phosphate of PRPP (3.Krahn J.M. Kim J.H. Burns M.R. Parry R.J. Zalkin H. Smith J.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11061-11068Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). This interaction does not make a major contribution to PRPP binding, since the K d for PRPP was increased by only 4-fold, and the PRPP binding signal activated glutaminase activity in the Y258F enzyme 50% as well as in the wild type. However, it is not known whether the interaction of Tyr-258 with the α phosphate of PRPP has a role in catalysis. If this interaction is important in catalysis, the Gln-PRA activity would not be a reliable monitor of channel function. The F334A channel mutant bound PRPP similarly to the wild type enzyme, yet signaling to the glutamine site was perturbed as shown by the 40-fold elevated K d for glutamine. Notwithstanding the signaling defect, glutaminase activity was approximately 35% higher than that of the wild type enzyme. However, virtually none of the NH3 derived from glutamine hydrolysis was available for synthesis of PRA, as indicated by the low channeling efficiency. In contrast to the L415A enzyme, which has a low channeling efficiency and a leaky channel phenotype, the NH3-PRA activity of the F334A enzyme was at the lower limit of detection (data not shown). The F334A enzyme thus has the features expected for a blocked or disrupted NH3 channel. There is no direct interaction between Phe-334 and PRPP to suggest perturbation of a step in the reaction of NH3 with PRPP. Pro-337 and Lys-349 are conserved in the flexible loop of the glutamine PRPP amidotransferase from more than 20 organisms. These residues have no known direct role in the structure of the NH3 channel, yet conservation suggests an important function. Since no role is apparent in the ligand-free conformer for Pro-337 and Lys-349, these residues may be important for the PRPP-mediated reorganization of the flexible loop, or they may have a role after binding of PRPP and glutamine. P337A and K349A mutant enzymes had a small increase in K d for glutamine binding, indicative of some perturbation in signaling. The binding affinity for PRPP was similar to that of the wild type enzyme. The capacity to transfer NH3 derived from glutamine hydrolysis through the channel for reaction with PRPP was decreased to about the same extent as seen for F254V and F259V channel mutations. Overall, the two enzymes with mutations in the flexible loop exhibit modest perturbations in signaling and channel function. The flexible loop has three functions in its closed state. It sequesters the PRTase active site from solvent, it signals the glutaminase domain that PRPP is available for reaction with a nucleophile, and it forms a channel for the nucleophile NH3. Thus it is no surprise that substitutions of conserved residues in the flexible loop impair one or more of these functions. The only physical contact between the flexible loop and glutaminase domain is between Ile-335 and Tyr-74. The importance of Ile-335 and Tyr-74 to signaling was demonstrated in earlier work (7.Bera A.K. Chen S. Smith J.L. Zalkin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36498-36504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In addition to glutamine PRPP amidotransferase, two other enzymes with physically separated active sites, tryptophan synthase and carbamoylphosphate synthetase, have been structurally defined (11.Miles E.W. Rhe S. Davies D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12193-12196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 12.Miles B.W. Banzon J.A. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16773-16779Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Two mechanisms are used to couple the partial reactions at the catalytic sites in all three enzymes. First, substrate binding to site 1 activates the partial reaction at site 2. Second, an intermediate product generated at site 2 is transferred through a channel for reaction at site 1. The glutamine PRPP amidotransferase NH3 channel, in contrast to the tryptophan synthase indole channel, is a transient structure that is formed by the reorganization of a PRTase domain flexible loop upon binding of PRPP. Carbamoylphosphate synthetase, similar to tryptophan synthase, likely maintains channels for NH3 and for carbamate throughout the catalytic cycle. The present results along with earlier work (7.Bera A.K. Chen S. Smith J.L. Zalkin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36498-36504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) emphasize that mutations in residues lining the NH3 channel perturb not only the transfer of NH3 derived from glutamine hydrolysis to the PRPP site but also transmission of the PRPP binding signal to the glutamine site. The structural basis for the signaling deficiency of channel mutants is not obvious. The positions of Phe-254, Tyr-258, and Phe-259 do not change relative to the glutaminase active site when the signaling interaction is established, and Phe-334 does not contact the glutaminase domain. Modest changes to some of the side chains lining the NH3channel (F254Y, F259V) perturbed channeling as did substitutions at other conserved residues near, but not part of, the NH3channel (T333A, P337A, K349A, L415A). The effects of channel residues on signaling and of nonchannel residues on channeling may be explained by the unique properties of the NH3 channel. The NH3 channel is formed by loosely packed, hydrophobic side chains. However, unlike the hydrophobic interior of proteins, the transient NH3 channel is not supported by a skeleton of hydrogen-bonded secondary structure. Thus side chain substitutions in the channel or in residues surrounding it are likely to result in a different structure for the flexible loop when it closes over bound PRPP. The transient functions of sequestering, signaling, and channeling require transient structures for the flexible loop and are inconsistent with extensive hydrogen bonding. As a consequence of these structural constraints, channel formation and signaling are linked."

Previously we have shown that the tyrosine kinase Lyn associates with the erythropoietin receptor and is essential for hemoglobin synthesis in three erythroleukemic cell lines. To understand Lyn signaling events in erythroid cells, the yeast two-hybrid system was used to analyze interactions with other proteins. Here we show that the hemopoietic-specific protein HS1 interacted directly with the SH3 domain of Lyn, via its proline-rich region. A truncated HS1, bearing the Lyn-binding domain, was introduced into J2E erythroleukemic cells to determine the impact upon responsiveness to erythropoietin. Truncated HS1 had a striking effect on the phenotype of the J2E line—the cells were smaller, more basophilic than the parental proerythoblastoid cells and had fewer surface erythropoietin receptors. Moreover, basal and erythropoietin-induced proliferation and differentiation were markedly suppressed. The inability of cells containing the truncated HS1 to differentiate may be a consequence of markedly reduced levels of Lyn and GATA-1. In addition, erythropoietin stimulation of these cells resulted in rapid, endosome-mediated degradation of endogenous HS1. The truncated HS1 also suppressed the development of erythroid colonies from fetal liver cells.

Like Lyn knockout mice, studies on HS1-deficient mice have revealed a central role for HS1 in B cell responsiveness (27.Hibbs M.L. Tarlinton D.M. Armes J. Grail D. Hodgson G. Maglitto R. Stacker S.A.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3664-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). While this manuscript was in preparation, HS1 was shown to bind the novel hematopoietic progenitor kinase (HPK1) in erythroid cells (29.Nagata Y. Kiefer F. Watanabe T. Todokoro K. Blood. 1999; 93: 3347-3354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In this study we attempted to identify downstream effectors of Lyn in erythroid cells using a yeast two-hybrid screen of wild type and a kinase inactive mutant (Y397F) of Lyn. Of the seven Lyn-interacting proteins identified, we report here on the interaction between Lyn and HS1, and the crucial role of HS1 for epo-induced differentiation of erythroid cells.DISCUSSIONIn this manuscript we have shown that the known Src kinase substrate HS1 associates with Lyn in erythroid cells. We have also demonstrated that a truncated HS1 (tHS1) markedly interferes with the phenotype of erythroid cells and impairs their ability to proliferate and differentiate. By disrupting the Lyn/HS1 interaction, we have generated a cascade of events which had a profound effect on erythroid maturation. These data indicate that HS1 plays a pivotal role in regulating intracellular signaling within erythroid cells and support the recent prediction by Nagata et al. (29.Nagata Y. Kiefer F. Watanabe T. Todokoro K. Blood. 1999; 93: 3347-3354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that “ … HS1 is likely to be involved in erythroid proliferation and differentiation. . . . . ”Introduction of a truncated form of HS1 into erythroid cells produced significant morphological, biochemical, and functional perturbations. The truncated mutant spanned the carboxyl-terminal, Lyn-binding region of HS1 that is sequentially phosphorylated by kinases (49.Ruzzene M. Brunati A.M. Marin O. Donella-Deana A. Pinna L.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5327-5332Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), but it did not include the amino-terminal Hax1-binding region (50.Suzuki Y. Demoliere C. Kitamura D. Takeshita H. Deuschle U. Watanabe T. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2736-2744PubMed Google Scholar). Strikingly, cells expressing tHS1 were smaller, more basophilic, and replicated much more slowly. In addition, epo-induced differentiation was almost totally blocked as the cells failed to mature morphologically and did not synthesize hemoglobin. These data demonstrate that tHS1 acted in a dominant negative fashion and emphasize the importance of a fully functional HS1 to erythroid maturation.The tHS1 mutant had several biochemical effects on the erythroid cells, which may account for its dominant negative activity. First, it greatly reduced the level of Lyn protein within the cells, and as a consequence a marked decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular proteins was detected. This result is compatible with our previous observation that the J2E-NR subclone expressed low levels of Lyn, and tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins was substantially reduced (5.Tilbrook P.A. Ingley E. Williams J.H. Hibbs M.L. Klinken S.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1610-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). As Lyn associates with the epo receptor (5.Tilbrook P.A. Ingley E. Williams J.H. Hibbs M.L. Klinken S.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1610-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 6.Chin H. Arai A. Wakao H. Kamiyama R. Miyasaka N. Miura O. Blood. 1998; 91: 3734-3745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), transmission of signals from the receptor via this kinase would be significantly diminished in the transfected cells. Second, the GATA-1 content fell dramatically in these cells. GATA-1 is a key transcription factor involved with erythroid development (51.Tsai S. Martin D.I.K. Zon L.I. D'Andrea A.D. Wong G.G. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 446-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 52.Pevny L. Lin C.-S., V., D.A. Simon M.C. Orkin S.H. Constantini F. Development. 1995; 121: 163-172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and in its absence erythroid precursors arrest at the proerythroblast stage (53.Weiss M.J. Keller G. Orkin S.H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1184-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Thus, the loss of GATA-1 protein may play a significant role in the inability of cells bearing tHS1 to mature morphologically or to produce hemoglobin.In addition to reducing the levels of Lyn and GATA-1, tHS1 had a significant effect on endogenous HS1. While the epo receptor was phosphorylated normally in cells containing the mutant HS1 (Fig. 6), endogenous HS1 was degraded rapidly in endosomes/lysosomes after exposure to epo (Fig. 7), indicating that the truncated mutant promoted this proteolysis. It is likely that degradation of endogenous HS1 prevented transmission of signals by this molecule. Thus, tHS1 uncovered an unexpected mechanism for dominant negative action. This observation warrants further investigation with the recent association of signaling molecules with degradation viz. the SOCS family of negative regulators of cytokine action target Janus kinases for degradation by associating with elongins (54.Zhang J.G.

In addition to intracellular co-localization within erythroid cells, the proline-rich region of HS1 was shown to bind the SH3 domain of Lyn, similar to the Lck/HS1 interaction reported previously (21.Takemoto Y. Furuta M. Li X.K. Strong-Sparks W.J. Y. H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3403-3414Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Lyn has been shown to associate with HS1 in B and T cells (45.Takemoto Y. Furuta M. Sato M. Findell P.R. Ramble W. Hashimoto Y. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 625-630PubMed Google Scholar), but this is the first report that we are aware of where Lyn interacts with HS1 in erythroid cells. Although HS1 and Lyn were constitutively associated in erythroid cells, the interaction increased appreciably after epo activation (Fig. 2 C), which is consistent with previous observations in T cells where the SH3 domain of Lck, or Lyn, binds to HS1 in the absence of stimulation, then the SH2 domain of these kinases associates with HS1 upon receptor activation, increasing the interaction (25.Takemoto Y. Sato M. Furuta M. Hashimoto Y. Int. Immunol. 1996; 8: 1699-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).HS1 is linked with several kinases. Here we demonstrated HS1 co-immunoprecipitated with Lyn, and two other Src kinases (Lck and Fyn) in J2E cells (Fig. 2 B); tHS1 could potentially interfere with signaling from these molecules. HS1 also associates with the novel hemopoietic kinase HPK1 in the erythroid SKT6 cell line (29.Nagata Y. Kiefer F. Watanabe T. Todokoro K. Blood. 1999; 93: 3347-3354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Takemoto et al. (45.Takemoto Y. Furuta M. Sato M. Findell P.R. Ramble W. Hashimoto Y. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 625-630PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that the HS1 association with the SH3 domain of Grb2 may regulate the Grb2 and Src signaling pathways. Together these results suggest that HS1 may mediate signals emanating from several kinases and play a crucial role in transmitting intracellular signals within erythroid cells. Erythropoiesis, the process of red blood cell development, is primarily controlled by erythropoietin (epo).1 Several model systems have been used to study erythropoiesis in vitro. Although primary erythroid cells provide the ideal cell type for analysis, heterogeneity in preparations and insufficient numbers can preclude biochemical analysis of epo signaling. A number of erythroid cell lines have been derived which provide useful models for analyzing epo-induced signaling cascades, including the SKT6 and J2E lines (1.Todokoro K. Kanazawa S. Amanuma H.

Like Lyn knockout mice, studies on HS1-deficient mice have revealed a central role for HS1 in B cell responsiveness (27.Hibbs M.L. Tarlinton D.M. Armes J. Grail D. Hodgson G. Maglitto R. Stacker S.A.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3664-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). While this manuscript was in preparation, HS1 was shown to bind the novel hematopoietic progenitor kinase (HPK1) in erythroid cells (29.Nagata Y. Kiefer F. Watanabe T. Todokoro K. Blood. 1999; 93: 3347-3354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we attempted to identify downstream effectors of Lyn in erythroid cells using a yeast two-hybrid screen of wild type and a kinase inactive mutant (Y397F) of Lyn. Of the seven Lyn-interacting proteins identified, we report here on the interaction between Lyn and HS1, and the crucial role of HS1 for epo-induced differentiation of erythroid cells. DISCUSSIONIn this manuscript we have shown that the known Src kinase substrate HS1 associates with Lyn in erythroid cells. We have also demonstrated that a truncated HS1 (tHS1) markedly interferes with the phenotype of erythroid cells and impairs their ability to proliferate and differentiate. By disrupting the Lyn/HS1 interaction, we have generated a cascade of events which had a profound effect on erythroid maturation. These data indicate that HS1 plays a pivotal role in regulating intracellular signaling within erythroid cells and support the recent prediction by Nagata et al. (29.Nagata Y. Kiefer F. Watanabe T. Todokoro K. Blood. 1999; 93: 3347-3354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that “ … HS1 is likely to be involved in erythroid proliferation and differentiation. . . . . ”Introduction of a truncated form of HS1 into erythroid cells produced significant morphological, biochemical, and functional perturbations. The truncated mutant spanned the carboxyl-terminal, Lyn-binding region of HS1 that is sequentially phosphorylated by kinases (49.Ruzzene M. Brunati A.M. Marin O. Donella-Deana A. Pinna L.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5327-5332Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), but it did not include the amino-terminal Hax1-binding region (50.Suzuki Y. Demoliere C. Kitamura D. Takeshita H. Deuschle U. Watanabe T. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2736-2744PubMed Google Scholar). Strikingly, cells expressing tHS1 were smaller, more basophilic, and replicated much more slowly. In addition, epo-induced differentiation was almost totally blocked as the cells failed to mature morphologically and did not synthesize hemoglobin. These data demonstrate that tHS1 acted in a dominant negative fashion and emphasize the importance of a fully functional HS1 to erythroid maturation.The tHS1 mutant had several biochemical effects on the erythroid cells, which may account for its dominant negative activity. First, it greatly reduced the level of Lyn protein within the cells, and as a consequence a marked decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular proteins was detected. This result is compatible with our previous observation that the J2E-NR subclone expressed low levels of Lyn, and tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins was substantially reduced (5.Tilbrook P.A. Ingley E. Williams J.H. Hibbs M.L. Klinken S.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1610-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). As Lyn associates with the epo receptor (5.Tilbrook P.A. Ingley E. Williams J.H. Hibbs M.L. Klinken S.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1610-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 6.Chin H. Arai A. Wakao H. Kamiyama R. Miyasaka N. Miura O. Blood. 1998; 91: 3734-3745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), transmission of signals from the receptor via this kinase would be significantly diminished in the transfected cells. Second, the GATA-1 content fell dramatically in these cells. GATA-1 is a key transcription factor involved with erythroid development (51.Tsai S. Martin D.I.K. Zon L.I. D'Andrea A.D. Wong G.G. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 446-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 52.Pevny L. Lin C.-S., V., D.A. Simon M.C. Orkin S.H. Constantini F. Development. 1995; 121: 163-172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and in its absence erythroid precursors arrest at the proerythroblast stage (53.Weiss M.J. Keller G. Orkin S.H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1184-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Thus, the loss of GATA-1 protein may play a significant role in the inability of cells bearing tHS1 to mature morphologically or to produce hemoglobin.In addition to reducing the levels of Lyn and GATA-1, tHS1 had a significant effect on endogenous HS1. While the epo receptor was phosphorylated normally in cells containing the mutant HS1 (Fig. 6), endogenous HS1 was degraded rapidly in endosomes/lysosomes after exposure to epo (Fig. 7), indicating that the truncated mutant promoted this proteolysis. It is likely that degradation of endogenous HS1 prevented transmission of signals by this molecule. Thus, tHS1 uncovered an unexpected mechanism for dominant negative action. This observation warrants further investigation with the recent association of signaling molecules with degradation viz. the SOCS family of negative regulators of cytokine action target Janus kinases for degradation by associating with elongins (54.Zhang J.G.

In addition to intracellular co-localization within erythroid cells, the proline-rich region of HS1 was shown to bind the SH3 domain of Lyn, similar to the Lck/HS1 interaction reported previously (21.Takemoto Y. Furuta M. Li X.K. Strong-Sparks W.J. Y. H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3403-3414Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Lyn has been shown to associate with HS1 in B and T cells (45.Takemoto Y. Furuta M. Sato M. Findell P.R. Ramble W. Hashimoto Y. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 625-630PubMed Google Scholar), but this is the first report that we are aware of where Lyn interacts with HS1 in erythroid cells. Although HS1 and Lyn were constitutively associated in erythroid cells, the interaction increased appreciably after epo activation (Fig. 2 C), which is consistent with previous observations in T cells where the SH3 domain of Lck, or Lyn, binds to HS1 in the absence of stimulation, then the SH2 domain of these kinases associates with HS1 upon receptor activation, increasing the interaction (25.Takemoto Y. Sato M. Furuta M. Hashimoto Y. Int. Immunol. 1996; 8: 1699-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).HS1 is linked with several kinases. Here we demonstrated HS1 co-immunoprecipitated with Lyn, and two other Src kinases (Lck and Fyn) in J2E cells (Fig. 2 B); tHS1 could potentially interfere with signaling from these molecules. HS1 also associates with the novel hemopoietic kinase HPK1 in the erythroid SKT6 cell line (29.Nagata Y. Kiefer F. Watanabe T. Todokoro K. Blood. 1999; 93: 3347-3354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

A proximal step in apoptotic signaling through Fas is implicated in this resistance, as these cells undergo normal levels of apoptosis induction after exposure to tumor necrosis factor-α. We studied the Fas receptors expressed in human thymocytes to search for mechanisms of receptor-mediated inhibition of Fas signaling in these cells. We describe here a unique, membrane-bound form of Fas receptor that contained a complete extracellular domain of Fas but that lacked a death domain due to alternative splicing of exon 7. This Fas decoy receptor (FDR) was shown to have nearly wild-type ability to bind native human Fas ligand and was expressed predominantly at the plasma membrane. Unlike soluble forms of Fas receptor, FDR dominantly inhibited apoptosis induction by Fas ligand in transfected human embryonic kidney cells. Titration of FDR in Fas-expressing cells suggests that FDR may operate through the formation of mixed receptor complexes. FDR also dominantly inhibited Fas-induced apoptosis in Jurkat T cells. In mixing experiments with wild-type Fas, FDR was capable of inhibiting death signaling at molar ratios less than 0.5, and this relative level of FDR:wild type message was observed in at least some thymocytes tested. The data suggest that Fas signal pathways in primary human cells may be regulated by expression of a membrane-bound decoy receptor, analogous to the regulation of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis by decoy receptors.

Nevertheless, primary cells of several types have been described that express Fas but that remain resistant to apoptosis induction after its ligation (6.Nagafuji K. Shibuya T. Harada M. Mizuno S.

Immunol. 1992; 149: 3753-3758PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, resistance to Fas-induced apoptosis has been described in activated CD8 cells (9.Noble A. Pestano G.A. Cantor H. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 559-565PubMed Google Scholar) and CD4 cells (10.Yang Y. Kim D. Fathman C.G. Int. Immunol. 1998; 10: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and co-stimulation through CD28 has been implicated in the resistance of antigen-activated cells (11.McLeod J.D. Walker L.S. Patel Y.I. Boulougouris G. Sansom D.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2072-2079PubMed Google Scholar). Although many mechanisms may regulate the sensitivity of Fas-expressing cells to Fas-induced apoptosis (12.Wallach D. Kovalenko A.V. Varfolomeev E.E. Boldin M.P. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), alterations in the Fas receptor itself have received the greatest attention. In particular, alternative splicing of Fas mRNA in both mouse (13.Hughes D.P. Crispe I.N. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1395-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and human (14.Cheng J. Zhou T.

Fiucci G. Papoff G. Ruberti G. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2706-2713PubMed Google Scholar) cells has been reported to result in an array of receptor proteins with various deletions or truncations. These variants include soluble forms of the Fas receptor that do not require proteolytic cleavage from the cell surface and that are also potential inhibitors of Fas ligand. However, these soluble Fas receptors appear to lack the ability to inhibit Fas signaling in the tissues in which they are found, including mouse thymocytes and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)1(13.Hughes D.P. Crispe I.N. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1395-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 14.Cheng J. Zhou T. Liu C. Shapiro J.P. Brauer M.J. Kiefer M.C. Barr P.J. Mountz J.D.

Thus, their contribution to Fas resistance in vivo remains unproven. We recently reported that most human thymocytes express Fas but are resistant to Fas-induced apoptosis (18.Jenkins M. Keir M. McCune J.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1195-1204PubMed Google Scholar). Such resistance was shown to be species-specific, specific for Fas and not for tumor necrosis factor α, and not abrogated by cycloheximide treatment. We hypothesized that the mechanism of resistance was receptor-intrinsic and therefore characterized the Fas receptors expressed on human thymocytes. In addition to previously described truncated receptor proteins, we found a unique form of Fas generated by alternative splicing of exon 7, resulting in a protein lacking a death domain but with an intact transmembrane domain. This Fas decoy receptor (FDR) is expressed on the plasma membrane, has wild-type ability to bind Fas ligand, but is incapable of transmitting a death signal, as assayed with several readouts including annexin V binding, hypodiploid analysis, and the TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) technique. FDR interferes with Fas apoptosis signaling in a dominant negative fashion in both 293T cells and in Jurkat cells. FDR message was quantified by exon-specific RT-PCR in fetal thymocytes and PBMC. A ratio of FDR-to-wild-type message, which was sufficient to account for Fas resistance, was observed in some but not all fetal thymocyte samples studied but was not seen either in unstimulated PBMC or in phytohemagglutinin-stimulated blasts or Jurkat cells. These data suggest that Fas-induced apoptosis may be regulated in part by the tissue-specific expression of a membrane-bound decoy receptor, in a manner similar to that described for TRAIL (19.Marsters S.A. Sheridan J.P. Pitti R.M. Huang A. Skubatch M. Baldwin D. Yuan J. Gurney A. Goddard A.D. Godowski P. Ashkenazi A. Curr.

Human fetal thymus specimens were derived from elective abortions, and PBMC were obtained from healthy adult volunteers. Protocols and consent procedures governing the collection and use of all human specimens were approved by the University of California, San Francisco Committee on Human Research. Jurkat E6 clone 1 cells were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin. The human embryonic kidney cell line 293T was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented in a similar manner. Ficoll-separated PBMC were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (5 μg/ml) (Sigma) and interleukin-2 (10 units/ml) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 5 days before harvest. Total RNA was prepared from 4 × 106 human fetal thymocytes (15–18 weeks of gestation) or from 4 × 106 PBMC using guanidine isothiocyanate/phenol and reverse-transcribed with Superscript (Life Technologies, Inc.) and random hexamer primers. Fas transcript cDNAs were amplified by Taq polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)-catalyzed PCR with primers (5′ Eco Fas and 3′ Xba Fas) (Table I), which correspond to the first or last 15 coding nucleotides and the 6 flanking noncoding nucleotides of the human Fas-coding sequence, as reported by Itohet al. (21.Itoh N. Yonehara S. Ishii A. Yonehara M. Mizushima S. Sameshima M. Hase A. Seto Y. Nagata S.

Thermal cycling parameters were 95 °C for 60 s, 50 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 90 s, performed for 40 cycles. PCR products were digested withEcoRI and XbaI and ligated into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Individual transformed colonies were screened for insert size by restriction mapping or by PCR product size analysis using SP6 and T7 primers. 88 clones were screened for insert size, 17 of which were sequenced on both strands using an ABI Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing system (Perkin-Elmer). Sequenced plasmids served as vectors for the expression of wild-type (wt) or alternatively-spliced Fas.Table IOligonucleotide primersNameLocationSequence5′ Eco FasSense (189–209)ccg gaa ttc aca acc atg ctg ggc atc tgg3′ Xba FasAntisense (1208–1188)ccg tct aga ttc act cta gac caa gct ttgwt Δ stopAntisense (1199–1179)gct cta gac tgc agg acc aag ctt tgg att tca ttFDR Δ stopAntisense (868–848)gct cta gac tgc agg ata aat tta ttg cca ctg ttwt exon 7Antisense (785–765)gct cta gac tgc agt ttc tgt act tcc ttt ctc ttExon 5 FasSense (681–698)acc aag tgc aaa gag gaaExon 8 FasAntisense (869–852)aga taa att tat tgc cac Open table in a new tab Cloned full-length (wt) Fas or Δ7 Fas were used as templates for mutagenesis PCR using 5′ Eco Fas as upstream primer and either wt Δ stop or FDR Δ stop as downstream primers to remove stop codons and to incorporate PstI and XbaI restriction sites (Table I). A third PCR product with a truncation of the wt Fas sequence after the first eight residues of exon 7 was created by using wt Fas as the template with primers 5′ Eco Fas and wt exon 7. All three products were gel-purified, digested withEcoRI and XbaI, and cloned into pcDNA3. These three constructs and unmodified pcDNA3 plasmid were then digested with SalI and PstI to generate fragments containing the cytomegalovirus promoter, Kozak and initiation sequences, and Fas-coding regions. These were ligated intoXhoI-PstI-digested pEGFP-1 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) to create promoter-receptor-GFP fusion protein expression vectors. Surface expression of GFP-Fas fusion proteins was assessed by staining unfixed 293T with phycoerythrin-conjugated antibody to Fas (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) at 24 h after transfection and 2-color analysis on a FACScan (BD Biosciences). Nearly confluent 293T cell cultures were split 1/20 into 6-well plates one day before calcium phosphate transfection. 0.5–1 μg of plasmid expression vector for Fas, Fas ligand, or variant Fas was used per well, and the total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant at 2 μg/well with the addition of vector DNA. Transformation of Jurkat cells for transient expression was accomplished by washing and resuspending 107 cells in 400 μl of serum-free RPMI medium containing 60 μg of expression plasmid DNA in a 0.4-cm electroporation cuvette (Bio-Rad) followed by electroporation in a Bio-Rad Gene pulser at 250 mV, 950 microfarads. An expression plasmid for recombinant soluble human Fas ligand covalently linked to a Flag epitope (rs Fas ligand-Flag), similar to that described by Schneider et al. (22.Schneider P. Bodmer J.L. Holler N. Mattmann C. Scuderi P. Terskikh A. Peitsch M.C. Tschopp J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18827-18833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), was created from the extracellular portion of cloned Fas ligand fused C-terminal to a prolactin leader sequence and a Flag epitope, as described (18.Jenkins M. Keir M. McCune J.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1195-1204PubMed Google Scholar). 24 h after transfection, 293T cells were detached with trypsin, treated with Fix and Perm reagent (Caltag, Burlingame CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and serially stained with biotinylated M2 anti-Flag monoclonal antibody (Sigma) or isotype and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated avidin (BD Biosciences). Cytometric analysis was performed on a FACScan (BD Biosciences). Calcium phosphate-transfected 293T cells were grown in 10-cm2 dishes for 24 h and then labeled for 2.5 h in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1 μCi of [35S]methionine. 1 ml of reserved supernatant or of cells lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer with protease inhibitors (Complete Mini, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were precleared with Protein A/G Plus beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) overnight and then immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of biotinylated anti-Flag antibody (M2, Sigma) and Protein A/G beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Half of the recovered protein was analyzed on a 10% polyacrylamide SDS minigel before autoradiographic exposure for 24 h at room temperature. Poly(A) RNA was reverse-transcribed with murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and random hexamer primers and subjected to 45 cyles of PCR with primers to the fifth and eighth exons of Fas (Table I). PCR products were separated on an 8% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel and stained with ethidium bromide before photography and band densitometry analysis. PCR products from plasmid templates for wild-type, Δ exon 6, and Δ exon 7 Fas were used as migration standards to estimate the relative abundance of message encoding each of these splice variants in mRNA from samples of fetal thymocyte cells, PBMCs, and phytohemagglutinin-stimulated blasts. 293T cells were assayed for apoptosis induction 24 h after transfection by three methods that gave similar results. First, flow cytometric quantitation of hypodiploid DNA was carried out using a modification of a published protocol (23.Robinson J.P. Darzynkiewicz Z. Dean P.N. Dressler L.G. Rabinovitch P.S. Stewart C.C. Tanke H.J. Wheeless L.L. Current Protocols in Cytometry. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 7.5.8-7.5.9Google Scholar). After a brief fixation in 1% paraformaldehyde, cells were stained with 40 μg/ml propidium iodide in 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and 0.1% sodium citrate for 30 min at room temperature and analyzed on a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson). The pulse width-pulse area plot was used to exclude doublets, and forward and side scatter gates were drawn to exclude debris. The percent of remaining cells with subdiploid DNA content was measured on DNA histograms. Second, the TUNEL technique (24.Gorczyca W. Gong J. Darzynkiewicz Z. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1945-1951PubMed Google Scholar) was used with reagents from Roche Molecular Biochemicals following the manufacturer's protocols. In other experiments, phycoerythrin-conjugated annexin V (Pharmingen, San Diego CA) was used to enumerate apoptotic cells in parallel with other readouts. Jurkat cells were used 24 h following electroporation and were split into two wells that received either no addition (control) or rs Fas ligand-Flag (1/100 dilution of unpurified cell culture supernatant) and 2 μg/ml M2 anti-Flag monoclonal antibody (induced). 24 h after stimulation, cells were washed, and apoptosis was assessed flow cytometrically, either by quantitation of hypodiploid DNA stained with propidium iodide (as above) or by apoptotic morphology, determined by forward and side light scatter criteria. These two assays gave equivalent results. Mock-electroporated cells were included as controls. The percent of cells with apoptotic morphology was calculated for GFP+ (transduced) cells, and the percent apoptosis induced by Fas-ligand was calculated as % apoptosis induced = (% apoptosis (induced) − % apoptosis (control))/(100 − % apoptosis (control)). The resistance of human thymocytes to apoptosis induced by Fas ligation was the subject of a prior study (18.Jenkins M. Keir M. McCune J.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1195-1204PubMed Google Scholar). Since apoptotic signaling in steps distal to FADD recruitment were normal in human thymocytes stimulated with tumor necrosis factor α, the mechanism of Fas resistance appeared to be proximal to the FADD signaling step. Moreover, we observed that protein synthesis with cycloheximide did not alter the Fas resistance of human thymocytes, making it unlikely that a short-lived inhibitor protein was responsible. We therefore sought to characterize the Fas receptors expressed by human thymocytes. RNA was isolated from fetal human thymocytes and from PBMC blasts, and RT-PCR was performed to amplify cDNA of Fas transcripts. The cloned cDNAs were screened by restriction analysis or by PCR to identify transcripts that would likely represent alternatively spliced RNAs (16.Papoff G. Cascino I. Eramo A. Starace G. Lynch D.H. Ruberti G. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4622-4630PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Cascino I. Fiucci G. Papoff G. Ruberti G. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2706-2713PubMed Google Scholar) (i.e. those shorter in length than wt Fas cDNA). Although most thymocyte clones represented full-length Fas transcripts, 17 of 88 clones (in contrast to only 1 of 16 cDNAs from PBMC blasts) revealed internally truncated transcripts. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed five forms of truncated Fas receptor cDNAs from human thymocytes, all of which were apparently produced by alternative splicing of mRNA with deletion of one to three exons of the full-length receptor (Fig.1). Four of these forms have been previously identified: Δ3,4,6 Fas (15.Liu C. Cheng J. Mountz J.D. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 957-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 16.Papoff G. Cascino I. Eramo A. Starace G. Lynch D.H. Ruberti G. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4622-4630PubMed Google Scholar), Δ4,6 Fas (16.Papoff G. Cascino I. Eramo A. Starace G. Lynch D.H. Ruberti G. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4622-4630PubMed Google Scholar), Δ4,7 Fas (15.Liu C. Cheng J. Mountz J.D. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 957-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and Δ6 Fas (14.Cheng J. Zhou T. Liu C. Shapiro J.P. Brauer M.J. Kiefer M.C. Barr P.J. Mountz J.D. Science. 1994; 263: 1759-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). The first three of these encode Fas molecules that have partial extracellular domains but that lack transmembrane anchor regions and death domains. The fourth, Δ6 Fas, contains a coding sequence for a death domain but, like the first three forms, lacks a transmembrane domain. In addition to these forms, we found a cDNA encoding a previously undescribed Fas receptor bearing a deletion of exon 7 alone. The Δ7 Fas cDNA encodes a receptor protein of 181 amino acids (designated Fas decoy receptor or FDR), which contains a full-length extracellular ligand binding domain as well as a transmembrane anchor region. However, due to a frameshift and misreading of exon 8, FDR has a premature stop codon after coding only 8 amino acid residues of the intracellular tail and so lacks a death domain. These unique features of FDR made it a potential candidate as a functional membrane-bound decoy receptor for Fas ligand in primary cells. We therefore evaluated critical functional properties that might be associated with a dominant negative inhibitor of Fas signaling: expression on the plasma membrane, ability to bind Fas ligand, and inability to transmit a death signal. Membrane localization was assessed by expressing fusion proteins of either wt Fas or FDR linked N-terminal to GFP in 293T cells. Cells transfected with either construct demonstrated surface Fas expression that was proportional to GFP expression, confirming that both receptors could be expressed on the plasma membrane (Fig.2). Fluorescence microscopy also revealed that cells transfected with expression vectors for GFP-tagged wt Fas, FDR, or wt Fas truncated at exon 7 exhibited fluorescence predominantly at the plasma membrane, in contrast to the cytoplasmic localization of GFP in cells transfected with expression vectors for GFP alone (data not shown). We next assessed the ability of the various Fas receptors to bind Fas ligand using an expression vector for a Flag epitope-tagged, soluble form of Fas ligand (rs Fas ligand-Flag). Transfection of this vector into 293T cells resulted in export of protein into the culture supernatant. If, however, this vector was co-transfected with a vector expressing wt Fas, Fas ligand was trapped intracellularly, as demonstrated by intracellular staining with anti-Flag monoclonal antibody and flow cytometric analysis (Fig.3 A). Radiolabeled rs Fas ligand-Flag was immunoprecipitated from the conditioned medium of cells transfected with the rs Fas ligand-Flag expression vector alone, but less material was recovered from conditioned medium of cells co-transfected with wt Fas (Fig. 3 B), confirming that Fas ligand interaction with wt Fas resulted in intracellular trapping. In addition, anti-Flag immunoprecipitates of the cellular lysate demonstrated predominantly mature glycosylation forms of Fas ligand protein, but co-expression of wt Fas resulted in a predominance of lower molecular weight forms of Fas ligand (Fig. 3 B), possibly corresponding to glycosylated forms of Fas ligand that are not fully processed (22.Schneider P. Bodmer J.L. Holler N. Mattmann C. Scuderi P. Terskikh A. Peitsch M.C. Tschopp J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18827-18833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The ability of wt Fas to bind and trap Fas ligand intracellularly formed the basis of an assay to determine the relative Fas ligand binding capacity of each of the five variant Fas receptors. 293T cells were co-transfected with expression plasmids for Flag-tagged Fas ligand and variant Fas receptors and then stained with an anti-Flag antibody to determine the relative degree of intracellular trapping of Fas ligand induced by each. As shown in Fig. 3 C, the degree of Fas ligand binding observed was roughly proportional to the size of the expressed Fas extracellular domain, suggesting that several domains of this protein may contribute to ligand binding. Δ6 Fas and FDR, both with full-length extracellular domains, were the most effective in intracellular trapping of Fas ligand, although neither was as effective as wt Fas in this assay. The ability to bind Fas ligand without activating downstream apoptotic signaling suggested that FDR may uniquely act as a dominant negative inhibitor of Fas apoptotic signaling. We therefore tested whether each of the variant Fas receptors could interfere with apoptosis induction in 293T cells co-transfected with wt Fas and Fas ligand. Expression of Fas ligand alone in these cells resulted in levels of apoptosis approximately 30% above base line (Fig.4 A, compare panels 1 and 2). The addition of wt Fas did not augment cell death to levels above those seen with Fas ligand alone (Fig.4 A, compare panels 2 and 3). Co-expression of equivalent amounts of variant Fas receptors which lacked transmembrane domains had no effect on the observed levels of apoptosis induction (Fig. 4 A, panels 4–7). However, co-expression of FDR effectively abrogated Fas ligand-induced apoptosis to the levels of nontransfected controls (Fig. 4 A,panel 8). To guarantee that the native level of Fas expression on 293T cells was not limiting for apoptosis induction, 293T cells were also transfected with Fas ligand, variant Fas receptors, and an equivalent amount of expression vector for wt Fas (Fig.4 B). Once again, FDR was unique among the variant Fas receptors in its ability to block apoptosis induction. These data demonstrate that FDR can inhibit Fas signaling of apoptosis in a dominant negative fashion. To estimate the relative receptor density necessary for effective apoptosis inhibition, graded amounts of FDR were co-expressed with a fixed amount of expression plasmid for wt Fas and Fas ligand, and apoptosis induction was scored using the TUNEL assay (Fig.4 C). Maximal inhibition of Fas-induced apoptosis was observed at an inhibitor to wild-type ratio of 1 or greater, with lesser degrees of inhibition apparent at lower ratios. This stoichiometry of apoptosis inhibition suggests that the formation of mixed receptor complexes is the mechanism of apoptosis inhibition. We next assessed the ability of FDR to inhibit apoptotic signaling through the native Fas receptor on the Jurkat T cell line. The Fas receptor expressed on Jurkat cells is competent to transmit a death signal upon ligation with either anti-Fas monoclonal antibody or with cross-linked soluble Fas ligand. Expression of Fas-GFP fusion proteins in Jurkat cells allowed analysis of Fas ligand-induced apoptosis levels among successfully transfected cells. In three experiments, Jurkat cells expressing either FDR or truncated wild-type Fas were substantially protected from apoptosis compared with nontransfected cells in the same culture (Fig. 4 D). To determine whether the observed resistance of human thymocytes to Fas-induced apoptosis was related to the expresssion of FDR, levels of wild-type Fas, ΔFas, and FDR mRNA were quantitated in human fetal thymocytes, PBMC, and PBMC blasts. As shown in Fig.5, the level of FDR mRNA in Fas-susceptible PBMC and PBMC blasts was low, not exceeding 4% that of the level of wt Fas message in 8 samples tested. The ratio of FDR to wt Fas message was also less than 9% in Jurkat T cells, which were also sensitive to apoptosis through Fas signaling (data not shown). Fas-resistant human thymocytes were more variable in FDR expression levels, with three of six samples tested showing FDR:wt Fas ratios of 30–53% (Fig. 5 and data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that FDR is preferentially expressed in human fetal thymocytes and that the level of expression is sufficiently high to account for resistance to Fas signaling in at least some human thymi. We describe here a unique FDR that is expressed in human thymocytes and that acts as a dominant negative inhibitor of Fas signaling. Unlike most Fas receptors generated by alternative splicing, FDR is not secreted. It may thereby be able to act in a cell-specific manner. FDR is also distinguished from most soluble Fas receptors in that it appears to be fully capable of binding to Fas ligand. Perhaps most importantly, FDR is unique in its ability to substantially protect cells expressing equivalent levels of wt Fas from apoptosis induced by Fas ligand. These data are consistent with the possibility that mixed receptor complexes of FDR and wt Fas form on the plasma membrane, preventing the multimerization of receptor tails that is thought to be critical for FADD recruitment to the death signaling complex (25.Takahashi T. Tanaka M. Ogasawara J. Suda T. Murakami H. Nagata S. Nature. 1993; 364: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1815) Google Scholar,26.Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Behrmann I. Germer M. Pawlita M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5579-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar). Other mutations of the intracellular death domain of Fas have been reported in T cell lines selected for resistance to Fas (27.Cascino I. Papoff G. De Maria R. Testi R. Ruberti G. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 13-17PubMed Google Scholar) and from patients with the penetrant form of Canale-Smith syndrome (28.Rieux-Laucat F. Le Deist F. Hivroz C. Roberts I.A. Debatin K.M. Fischer A. de Villartax J. Science. 1995; 268: 1347-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar, 29.Fisher G.H. Rosenberg F.J. Straus S.E. Dale J.K. Middleton L.A. Lin A.Y. Strober W. Lenardo M.J. Puck J.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 935-946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar). These mutations do not prevent binding of Fas ligand with wt Fas but impair signaling through the death domain instead. Recently, the mechanism of Fas signaling defects in patients with lymphoproliferative syndromes and heterozygous CD95 mutations has been studied (30.Vaishnaw A.K. Orlinick J.R. Chu J.L. Krammer P.H. Chao M.V. Elkon K.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The highly penetrant and dominantly inherited forms of this syndrome were seen only in those patients with mutations affecting the receptor death domain. The two critical features of these dominant negative inhibitors, wt ability to bind Fas ligand and loss of a functional death domain, are shared by the decoy receptor, which we describe here. The native expression in human thymocytes of this alternatively spliced receptor suggests that sensitivity to Fas-induced apoptosis may be developmentally modulated in part by the regulated expression of this dominant negative decoy receptor. Whether FDR is solely or jointly responsible for the observed resistance of human thymocytes to Fas-induced apoptosis is still under investigation. The ability of T cells to undergo activation-induced cell death clearly depends not only upon the expression of Fas and Fas ligand but also upon the inactivation of cellular negative regulators of apoptosis (31.Irmler M. Thome M. Hahne M. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Steiner V. Bodmer J.L. Schroter M. Burns K. Mattmann C. Rimoldi D. French L.E. Tschopp J.

Redundant controls on cell death appear to have evolved as a protection against accidental cell death (12.Wallach D. Kovalenko A.V. Varfolomeev E.E. Boldin M.P. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In this light, the role of FDR in the human thymus may be to act as a Fas-specific negative regulator of apoptosis within cells that must pass through a stage of marked vulnerability to apoptosis induction (e.g. during negative selection). The tissue-specific regulation of apoptotic signaling implied by these findings shares features with the TRAIL-TRAIL receptor system (34.Griffith T.S. Lynch D.H. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 559-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). As a transmembrane death receptor lacking a death domain, FDR resembles TRAIL-R4 or decoy receptor 2 (19.Marsters S.A. Sheridan J.P. Pitti R.M. Huang A. Skubatch M. Baldwin D. Yuan J. Gurney A. Goddard A.D. Godowski P. Ashkenazi A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 1003-1006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 20.Degli-Esposti M.A. Dougall W.C. Smolak P.J. Waugh J.Y. Smith C.A. Goodwin R.G. Immunity. 1997; 7: 813-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar), a decoy receptor for TRAIL whose expression appears to correlate with sensitivity to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Unlike TRAIL-R4/decoy receptor 2, FDR arises from alternative splicing and so is itself regulated in a promoter-independent fashion. Control of apoptotic signaling pathways is complicated by the convergence of multiple signal pathways at the stage of FADD recruitment and in distal steps. FDR provides a mechanism to exert stimulus-specific control of Fas-induced apoptosis in a cell-specific manner. Furthermore, by virtue of its severely abbreviated intracellular tail, it is unlikely that FDR is capable of transmitting non-apoptotic signals. These features make it attractive as a tool to dissect the role of Fas in human biology and as a potential therapeutic agent in autoimmune disease and in tissue transplantation.

With this method the UvrB-DNA preincision complex remains stable even in the absence of ATP. For the binding of UvrC to the UvrB-DNA complex no cofactor is needed. The subsequent induction of 3′ incision does require ATP binding by UvrB but not hydrolysis. This ATP binding induces a conformational change in the DNA, resulting in the appearance of the DNase I-hypersensitive site at the 5′ side of the damage. In contrast, the 5′ incision is not dependent on ATP binding because it occurs with the same efficiency with ADP. We show with competition experiments that both incision reactions are induced by the binding of the same UvrC molecule. A DNA substrate containing damage close to the 5′ end of the damaged strand is specifically bound by UvrB in the absence of UvrA and ATP (Moolenaar, G. F., Monaco, V., van der Marel, G. A., van Boom, J. H., Visse, R., and Goosen, N. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 8038–8043). To initiate the formation of an active UvrBC-DNA incision complex, however, UvrB first needs to hydrolyze ATP, and subsequently a new ATP molecule must be bound.

Implications of these findings for the mechanism of the UvrA-mediated formation of the UvrB-DNA preincision complex will be discussed. adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) Nucleotide excision repair in Escherichia coli is initiated by the binding of the UvrA2B complex to DNA containing damage. Following this, UvrB is loaded onto the site of the damage, and the UvrA protein is released. The resulting UvrB-DNA preincision complex is bound by the UvrC protein, leading to incision of the DNA at the 4th or 5th phosphodiester bond on the 3′ side of the damage. This 3′ incision is immediately followed by hydrolysis of the 8th phosphodiester bond at the 5′ side of the damage. The repair reaction is completed by the action of the UvrD, polymerase I, and ligase proteins, which replace the damaged oligo with a newly synthesized strand (for reviews see Refs. 1.Sancar A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 43-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar and 2.Goosen N. Moolenaar G.F. Visse R. van de Putte P. Eckstein F. Lilley D.M.J. Nucleic Acids and Molecular Biology: DNA Repair. Springer Verlag, Berlin1998: 103-123Google Scholar).ATP binding and hydrolysis play important roles throughout the repair reaction. The function of this cofactor is quite complex, which is illustrated by the presence of five ATP-binding sites in a single UvrA2B complex, two in each UvrA subunit and one in UvrB. The dimerization of UvrA is stimulated by ATP binding but not hydrolysis (3.Mazur S.J. Grossman L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4432-4443Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The formation of an (active) UvrA2B complex in solution requires the hydrolysis of ATP by UvrA (4.Orren D.K. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5237-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The ATP hydrolysis by UvrA is also an important factor in discriminating between damaged and nondamaged DNA (5.Oh E.Y. Grossman L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 16067-16071Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In solution the UvrB protein on its own does not hydrolyze ATP, but as part of the UvrA2B complex it displays a DNA damage-dependent ATPase activity (6.Seeley T.W. Grossman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7158-7165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This ATPase activity is associated with a limited DNA unwinding activity (7.Oh E.Y. Grossman L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3638-3642Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), which was shown to be important for loading the UvrB protein onto the site of the damage (8.Moolenaar G.F. Visse R. Ortiz-Buysse M. Goosen N. van de Putte P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 240: 294-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Finally it has been shown that binding of ATP to the UvrBC-DNA complex is important for incision (9.Orren D.K. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15796-15803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the latter experiments incision was monitored by the conversion of UV-irradiated supercoiled DNA substrate to the relaxed form, and therefore it could not be determined whether ATP binding is needed for 3′ incision alone or for both incision reactions.In this paper we take a closer look at the function of ATP binding and hydrolysis in formation of the UvrB-DNA preincision complex and formation of the UvrBC-DNA incision complex and in the two incision reactions. For this purpose we have constructed biotinylated damaged DNA substrates, which are used to capture repair intermediates on streptavidin-coated magnetic beads.DISCUSSIONOn a double-stranded damaged DNA substrate the loading of UvrB onto the site of the damage requires the action of UvrA and ATP. Several observations have suggested that the resulting UvrB-DNA preincision complex is stable in the presence of ATP only: (i) Isolation of UvrB-DNA complexes by column chromatography at room temperature was only possible if the chromatography buffers contained ATP (9.Orren D.K. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15796-15803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (ii) Separation of preincision complexes by gel retardation results in a much higher yield when ATP is included in the gel and the electrophoresis buffer (10.Visse R. de Ruijter M. Moolenaar G.F. van de Putte P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4820-4827Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 17.Moolenaar G.F. Monaco V. van de Marel G.A. van Boom J.H. Visse R. Goosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8038-8043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this paper we show that a stable UvrB-DNA complex can be isolated in the absence of ATP by capture of a biotinylated damaged DNA substrate on streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. The complex survived multiple washes in buffer without ATP even at room temperature. Apparently the stability of the UvrB-DNA complex is highly dependent on the method used to separate it from the other components of the reaction mixture.Binding of ATP to the UvrB-DNA complex induces a conformational change in the DNA as was shown by DNase I footprinting. In the presence of ATP the UvrB-DNA complex shows a DNase I-hypersensitive site at the 5′ side of the damage. This site is generally believed to be characteristic for the formation of the preincision complex. The DNase I-hypersensitive site is also apparent in the presence of ATPγS but not with ADP, indicating that it is the ATP binding and not the hydrolysis that induces the specific DNA conformation. We will refer to the UvrB-DNA complex prior to the binding of ATP as the pro-preincision complex and with bound ATP as the preincision complex. The appearance of the DNase I-hypersensitive site fully correlates with the induction of 3′ incision after addition of UvrC to the isolated complexes; efficient incision occurs in the presence of ATP and ATPγS, but not with ADP or without cofactor. The binding of UvrC to the UvrB-DNA complex does not require a cofactor, suggesting that the ATP-induced conformational change is needed for the 3′ incision itself. The ATP-induced conformational change is not required for the 5′ incision. Although on a 3′ prenicked substrate ATP and ATPγS still specifically induce the DNase I-hypersensitive site, the 5′ incision is as efficient with ADP, which does not give this conformational change. The 5′ incision can even take place in the absence of cofactor, albeit at a very low level. Strikingly, addition of UvrC to isolated UvrB-DNA complexes formed on a 3′ prenicked substrate resulted in a very efficient 5′ incision at 0 °C, even after incubation for only 3 min. Apparently the binding of UvrC to the preincised complex directly docks the 5′ incision position into the catalytic site of the protein. The 3′ incision event, in contrast, appears to be much more difficult to achieve. In the accompanying paper (17.Moolenaar G.F. Monaco V. van de Marel G.A. van Boom J.H. Visse R. Goosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8038-8043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) we have shown that in a UvrB-DNA complex without ATP the DNA region of the 3′ incision is under torsional stress, resulting in the instability of this pro-preincision complex as discussed above. This deformation of the DNA is important for the eventual 3′ incision, because relaxation of the DNA by introduction of a single strand nick opposite the 3′ site completely abolishes incision (17.Moolenaar G.F. Monaco V. van de Marel G.A. van Boom J.H. Visse R. Goosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8038-8043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Subsequent binding of ATP to the pro-preincision complex not only induces the DNase I-hypersensitive site as we show here, but it also seems to release or compensate for the torsional stress in the 3′ region, because it stabilizes the complex in a retardation gel (17.Moolenaar G.F. Monaco V. van de Marel G.A. van Boom J.H. Visse R. Goosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8038-8043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that 3′ incision requires two consecutive conformational changes in the 3′ region of the DNA, the first one made during formation of the pro-preincision complex and the second one because of subsequent ATP binding. Moreover the 3′ incision appears also to require thermal energy, because addition of UvrC to preformed preincision complexes does not give any 3′ incision at 0 °C. Taken together, the exposure of the 3′ incision site to the catalytic residues seems to need a very specific protein-DNA conformation in which the DNA helix is likely to be considerably distorted. Recently we have shown that the UvrC protein contains two catalytic sites, one for the 3′ incision and one for the 5′ incision (21.Verhoeven E.E.A. van Kesteren M. Moolenaar G.F. Visse R. Goosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275 (article number 806636)Google Scholar). From the results in this paper, it is clear that both incisions are made by the same UvrC molecule. The competition experiments indicate that the coiled-coil interaction between the C-terminal domain of UvrB and the homologous domain of UvrC is maintained after the 3′ incision has occurred, even though it has been shown that it is not essential for the 5′ incision (20.Moolenaar G.F. Franken K.L.M.C. Dijkstra D.M. Thomas-Oates J.E. Visse R. van de Putte P. Goosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30508-30515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).Damage recognition by the UvrB protein per se does not require ATP (17.Moolenaar G.F. Monaco V. van de Marel G.A. van Boom J.H. Visse R. Goosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8038-8043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), which is why UvrB can specifically bind to the site of the damage in substrate G10 in the absence of cofactor. Before incision can occur, however, the UvrB-DNA complex on this substrate first needs to hydrolyze ATP, and then a new ATP molecule must be bound. These two ATP-dependent reactions are most likely required to induce the two consecutive conformational changes associated with formation of the pro-preincision complex and the preincision complex, respectively, as discussed above. On a double-stranded DNA substrate, ATP hydrolysis by UvrB is also needed in a prior step to trigger the DNA helicase activity of the UvrA2B complex, which is required for the loading of UvrB onto the damaged site (6.Seeley T.W. Grossman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7158-7165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Oh E.Y. Grossman L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 8038-8043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) we have shown that this helicase activity presumably unwinds the DNA at the 5′ side of the damage, thereby allowing UvrB access to the damage.Taken together we come to a model in which UvrB hydrolyzes multiple ATP molecules during the repair reaction (Fig.8). First ATP hydrolysis by the UvrA2B complex is needed for opening up the DNA helix to bring UvrB close to the damage. Next the UvrB protein binds to this damaged site, and in the resulting UvrB·DNA complex a second round of ATP hydrolysis is triggered, thereby inducing the conformational changes that lead to formation of the relatively unstable pro-preincision complex. The experiments with substrate G10 have shown that this ATP hydrolysis can occur in the absence of UvrA. Therefore UvrA might be released from the complex during formation of the initial UvrB·DNA complex, although we cannot exclude the possibility that this dissociation occurs at a later stage. The binding of ATP to the pro-preincision complex induces formation of the preincision complex, which after binding of UvrC can be incised at the 3′ site. Finally, for the 5′ incision no further ATP binding or hydrolysis is needed. We have shown in this paper that the UvrC protein is capable of binding to all three UvrB-DNA intermediate complexes. In the normal chain of events the UvrB·DNA complex formed after loading of UvrB, and the pro-preincision complex are expected to be very short-lived. Thereforein vivo UvrC will most probably bind when the preincision complex is formed. Nucleotide excision repair in Escherichia coli is initiated by the binding of the UvrA2B complex to DNA containing damage. Following this, UvrB is loaded onto the site of the damage, and the UvrA protein is released. The resulting UvrB-DNA preincision complex is bound by the UvrC protein, leading to incision of the DNA at the 4th or 5th phosphodiester bond on the 3′ side of the damage.

The binding of ATP to the pro-preincision complex induces formation of the preincision complex, which after binding of UvrC can be incised at the 3′ site. Finally, for the 5′ incision no further ATP binding or hydrolysis is needed. We have shown in this paper that the UvrC protein is capable of binding to all three UvrB-DNA intermediate complexes. In the normal chain of events the UvrB·DNA complex formed after loading of UvrB, and the pro-preincision complex are expected to be very short-lived. Thereforein vivo UvrC will most probably bind when the preincision complex is formed. On a double-stranded damaged DNA substrate the loading of UvrB onto the site of the damage requires the action of UvrA and ATP. Several observations have suggested that the resulting UvrB-DNA preincision complex is stable in the presence of ATP only: (i) Isolation of UvrB-DNA complexes by column chromatography at room temperature was only possible if the chromatography buffers contained ATP (9.Orren D.K. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15796-15803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (ii) Separation of preincision complexes by gel retardation results in a much higher yield when ATP is included in the gel and the electrophoresis buffer (10.Visse R. de Ruijter M. Moolenaar G.F. van de Putte P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4820-4827Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 17.Moolenaar G.F. Monaco V. van de Marel G.A. van Boom J.H. Visse R. Goosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8038-8043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this paper we show that a stable UvrB-DNA complex can be isolated in the absence of ATP by capture of a biotinylated damaged DNA substrate on streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. The complex survived multiple washes in buffer without ATP even at room temperature. Apparently the stability of the UvrB-DNA complex is highly dependent on the method used to separate it from the other components of the reaction mixture. Binding of ATP to the UvrB-DNA complex induces a conformational change in the DNA as was shown by DNase I footprinting. In the presence of ATP the UvrB-DNA complex shows a DNase I-hypersensitive site at the 5′ side of the damage. This site is generally believed to be characteristic for the formation of the preincision complex. The DNase I-hypersensitive site is also apparent in the presence of ATPγS but not with ADP, indicating that it is the ATP binding and not the hydrolysis that induces the specific DNA conformation. We will refer to the UvrB-DNA complex prior to the binding of ATP as the pro-preincision complex and with bound ATP as the preincision complex. The appearance of the DNase I-hypersensitive site fully correlates with the induction of 3′ incision after addition of UvrC to the isolated complexes; efficient incision occurs in the presence of ATP and ATPγS, but not with ADP or without cofactor. The binding of UvrC to the UvrB-DNA complex does not require a cofactor, suggesting that the ATP-induced conformational change is needed for the 3′ incision itself. The ATP-induced conformational change is not required for the 5′ incision. Although on a 3′ prenicked substrate ATP and ATPγS still specifically induce the DNase I-hypersensitive site, the 5′ incision is as efficient with ADP, which does not give this conformational change. The 5′ incision can even take place in the absence of cofactor, albeit at a very low level. Strikingly, addition of UvrC to isolated UvrB-DNA complexes formed on a 3′ prenicked substrate resulted in a very efficient 5′ incision at 0 °C, even after incubation for only 3 min. Apparently the binding of UvrC to the preincised complex directly docks the 5′ incision position into the catalytic site of the protein. The 3′ incision event, in contrast, appears to be much more difficult to achieve. In the accompanying paper (17.Moolenaar G.F. Monaco V. van de Marel G.A. van Boom J.H. Visse R. Goosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8038-8043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) we have shown that in a UvrB-DNA complex without ATP the DNA region of the 3′ incision is under torsional stress, resulting in the instability of this pro-preincision complex as discussed above. This deformation of the DNA is important for the eventual 3′ incision, because relaxation of the DNA by introduction of a single strand nick opposite the 3′ site completely abolishes incision (17.Moolenaar G.F.

Subsequent binding of ATP to the pro-preincision complex not only induces the DNase I-hypersensitive site as we show here, but it also seems to release or compensate for the torsional stress in the 3′ region, because it stabilizes the complex in a retardation gel (17.Moolenaar G.F.

These observations indicate that 3′ incision requires two consecutive conformational changes in the 3′ region of the DNA, the first one made during formation of the pro-preincision complex and the second one because of subsequent ATP binding. Moreover the 3′ incision appears also to require thermal energy, because addition of UvrC to preformed preincision complexes does not give any 3′ incision at 0 °C. Taken together, the exposure of the 3′ incision site to the catalytic residues seems to need a very specific protein-DNA conformation in which the DNA helix is likely to be considerably distorted. Recently we have shown that the UvrC protein contains two catalytic sites, one for the 3′ incision and one for the 5′ incision (21.Verhoeven E.E.A. van Kesteren M. Moolenaar G.F. Visse R. Goosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275 (article number 806636)Google Scholar). From the results in this paper, it is clear that both incisions are made by the same UvrC molecule. The competition experiments indicate that the coiled-coil interaction between the C-terminal domain of UvrB and the homologous domain of UvrC is maintained after the 3′ incision has occurred, even though it has been shown that it is not essential for the 5′ incision (20.Moolenaar G.F. Franken K.L.M.C. Dijkstra D.M. Thomas-Oates J.E. Visse R. van de Putte P. Goosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30508-30515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Damage recognition by the UvrB protein per se does not require ATP (17.Moolenaar G.F. Monaco V. van de Marel G.A. van Boom J.H. Visse R. Goosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8038-8043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), which is why UvrB can specifically bind to the site of the damage in substrate G10 in the absence of cofactor. Before incision can occur, however, the UvrB-DNA complex on this substrate first needs to hydrolyze ATP, and then a new ATP molecule must be bound. These two ATP-dependent reactions are most likely required to induce the two consecutive conformational changes associated with formation of the pro-preincision complex and the preincision complex, respectively, as discussed above. On a double-stranded DNA substrate, ATP hydrolysis by UvrB is also needed in a prior step to trigger the DNA helicase activity of the UvrA2B complex, which is required for the loading of UvrB onto the damaged site (6.Seeley T.W.

Chem. 2000; 275: 8038-8043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) we have shown that this helicase activity presumably unwinds the DNA at the 5′ side of the damage, thereby allowing UvrB access to the damage. Taken together we come to a model in which UvrB hydrolyzes multiple ATP molecules during the repair reaction (Fig.8). First ATP hydrolysis by the UvrA2B complex is needed for opening up the DNA helix to bring UvrB close to the damage. Next the UvrB protein binds to this damaged site, and in the resulting UvrB·DNA complex a second round of ATP hydrolysis is triggered, thereby inducing the conformational changes that lead to formation of the relatively unstable pro-preincision complex. The experiments with substrate G10 have shown that this ATP hydrolysis can occur in the absence of UvrA. Therefore UvrA might be released from the complex during formation of the initial UvrB·DNA complex, although we cannot exclude the possibility that this dissociation occurs at a later stage. The binding of ATP to the pro-preincision complex induces formation of the preincision complex, which after binding of UvrC can be incised at the 3′ site.

https://openalex.org/W2060904047,"The UvrB-DNA preincision complex plays a key role in nucleotide excision repair in Escherichia coli. To study the formation of this complex, derivatives of a DNA substrate containing a cholesterol adduct were constructed. Introduction of a single strand nick into either the top or the bottom strand at the 3′ side of the adduct stabilized the UvrB-DNA complex, most likely by the release of local stress in the DNA. Removal of both DNA strands up to the 3′ incision site still allowed formation of the preincision complex. Similar modifications at the 5′ side of the damage, however, gave different results. The introduction of a single strand nick at the 5′ incision site completely abolished the UvrA-mediated formation of the UvrB-DNA complex. Deletion of both DNA strands up to the 5′ incision site also prevented the UvrA-mediated loading of UvrB onto the damaged site, but UvrB by itself could bind very efficiently. This demonstrates that the UvrB protein is capable of recognizing damage without the matchmaker function of the UvrA protein. Our results also indicate that the UvrA-mediated loading of the UvrB protein is an asymmetric process, which starts at the 5′ side of the damage.

Our results also indicate that the UvrA-mediated loading of the UvrB protein is an asymmetric process, which starts at the 5′ side of the damage. Nucleotide excision repair in Escherichia coli is a multi-step process that leads to the removal of a 12–13-mer oligonucleotide containing the damaged site, followed by filling in of the resulting gap by DNA polymerase I and ligation of the nick by DNA ligase (1.Sancar A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 43-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar, 2.Goosen N. Moolenaar G.F. Visse R. van de Putte P. Eckstein F. Lilley D.M.J. Nucleic Acids and Molecular Biology: DNA Repair. Springer Verlag, Berlin1998Google Scholar). The key intermediate of the repair process is the UvrB-DNA preincision complex, in which UvrB is tightly bound to the DNA at the site of the lesion. The UvrC protein interacts with this preincision complex, resulting in cleavage of the 4th or 5th phosphodiester bond 3′ to the damage. This 3′ incision is immediately followed by cleavage of the 8thphosphodiester bond on the 5′ side of the damage.The UvrB protein on its own has no significant affinity for damaged or undamaged double-stranded DNA, but very low affinity binding to single-stranded DNA carrying a lesion has been shown (3.Hsu D.S. Kim S.T. Sun Q. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8319-8327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Loading of UvrB onto damaged double-stranded DNA requires the action of the UvrA protein. A dimer of UvrA associates with UvrB in solution, and the trimeric UvrA2B complex initially binds to a damaged site in the DNA. Next, conformational changes take place in the UvrA2B-DNA complex resulting in stable binding of UvrB to the DNA and the release of UvrA (4.Orren D.K. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5237-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This UvrA-directed binding of UvrB to the DNA has been shown to require ATP hydrolysis by the UvrB protein (5.Oh E.Y. Claassen L. Thiagalingham S. Mazur S. Grossman L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4145-4159Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and the UvrA2B-associated DNA helicase activity (6.Moolenaar G.F. Visse R.

Chem. 1989; 264: 1336-1343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that this loading of UvrB involves denaturation of the DNA near the site of the lesion.In addition to the damage-specific DNA binding of UvrB via the action of UvrA, a complex of UvrB and UvrC (in the absence of UvrA) has been shown to specifically bind to nondamaged DNA with a double strand-single strand junction (8.Moolenaar G.F.

These substrates are subsequently incised by the UvrBC complex at 7 nucleotides from the 3′ end of the junction. It has been proposed that the UvrBC incision of the nondamaged substrate mimics the 5′ incision event on damaged DNA (8.Moolenaar G.F. Bazuine M. van Knippenberg I.C. Visse R. Goosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34896-34903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar,9.Zou Y. Walker R. Bassett H. Geacintov N.E. Van Houten B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4820-4827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).In this paper we investigate the role of the DNA flanking the incision positions for formation of the UvrB-DNA preincision complex and the subsequent incisions. We show that a double-stranded substrate in which DNA at the 3′ side of the damage has been removed up to the 3′ incision site can still form a stable preincision complex via the UvrA-mediated loading of the UvrB protein. Deletion of DNA on the 5′ side up to the 5′ incision position abolished the UvrA-mediated formation of the UvrB-DNA complex. In the absence of UvrA, however, the UvrB protein by itself could efficiently bind to this 5′-truncated substrate. Implications of these findings for the process of UvrA-mediated preincision complex formation will be discussed.DISCUSSIONBinding of UvrB to a damaged site in double-stranded DNA has been generally believed to require the “molecular matchmaker” function of UvrA. Here we show for the first time that UvrB by itself is capable of recognizing and binding to the site of a lesion, if this lesion is located close to the end of a double-stranded fragment. This damage-specific binding of UvrB alone seems to have a polarity, occurring when the damage is close to the 5′ end of the damaged strand but not when it is close to the 3′ end. This indicates that for the direct binding of UvrB, the protein needs to “approach” the damage from the 5′ side. This directionality is likely to be a reflection of the mechanism that UvrA uses to load UvrB onto a damaged site. After initial recognition of damage by the UvrA protein in the UvrA2B complex, the UvrA2B-associated helicase activity might transiently unwind the DNA region at the 5′ side of the damage. As a result of this, an “entry site” for UvrB is created close to the 5′ side of the damage, to which it will subsequently bind via its own damage-recognizing determinants. Several experiments described in this paper are in agreement with such a mechanism of UvrB loading: (i) On a truncated DNA fragment, which has 7 base pairs at the 5′ side of the damage, UvrA can no longer load the UvrB protein. A deletion at the other side leaving only 4 base pairs at the 3′ side of the damage, however, does not interfere with this process. Apparently for the loading process the 5′-flanking region is more important than the 3′-flanking region, which would be in agreement with an entry site function of this 5′ region. (ii) Mutants of UvrB that affect the ATPase/helicase activity of the UvrA2B complex can no longer be loaded onto a damaged site via UvrA (6.Moolenaar G.F. Visse R. Ortiz-Buysse M. Goosen N. van de Putte P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 240: 294-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The same mutants, however, do bind to the damaged site when it is close to the end of the DNA fragment. This shows that the DNA unwinding activity per se is not needed for the damage recognition, but it is more likely creating a DNA conformation that allows UvrB to access the damage,i.e. opening up of the DNA helix in the 5′ region. When the damage is located close to the end, this active opening up is no longer required. (iii) The introduction of a single-stranded nick at the 5′ incision position completely abolishes the UvrA-mediated loading of UvrB. Gel retardation experiments showed that the nick does not inhibit the damage-specific binding of the UvrA2B complex. Because the presence of a nick does not alter the number of possible DNA contacts with the UvrA and/or UvrB proteins, its effect must be topological. The DNA conformation in the protein-DNA complex after the postulated unwinding of the 5′ region would be different when a nick is present. The 19-mer top strand might even dissociate completely from the complex. A nick in the bottom strand does not interfere with the UvrA-mediated loading of UvrB, although this nick is expected to influence the topology of the DNA after unwinding as well. This could indicate that after the unwinding of the 5′-flanking region by UvrA2B, the UvrB protein mainly interacts with the top strand of this region. The presence of a nick in this strand would then prevent the access of UvrB to the damaged site.The UvrB protein by itself is capable of specifically binding to the damage of substrate G10 in the absence of ATP. The subsequent stable binding of UvrC can occur in the absence of a cofactor too. However, for the incisions to take place, ATP is indispensable, indicating that for the formation of an active UvrBC-DNA incision complex an ATP-induced conformational change of UvrB is required. The role of the cofactor in formation of the incision complex is further discussed in the accompanying paper (13.Moolenaar G.F. Pen̆a Herron M.F. Monaco V. van de Marel G.A. van Boom J.H. Visse R. Goosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8044-8050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).Once UvrA has loaded UvrB onto the DNA, the stability of the resulting preincision complex is influenced by the conformation of the damage-flanking regions. The gel retardation experiments in the absence of ATP indicate that the UvrB-DNA complex is stabilized by introduction of a single-stranded nick in either top or bottom strand at the 3′ side of the lesion. This indicates that in the UvrB-DNA complex without ATP the DNA is in a state of torsional tension. Nicking of the DNA will release this tension thereby stabilizing the complex. Because the presence of a nick at the 5′ side of the lesion (in the bottom strand) does not stabilize the UvrB-DNA complex, the DNA helix seems mainly distorted at the 3′ side of the damage. In a retardation gel with ATP, the UvrB-DNA complex of substrate G1 is much more stable than in a gel without ATP. This indicates that ATP alters the conformation of the UvrB-DNA complex such that the DNA tension in the 3′ region is (partially) released.Stable binding of UvrC to the preincision complex is largely determined by protein-protein interactions between the homologous domains of UvrB and UvrC (14.Moolenaar G.F. Franken K.L.M.C. Dijkstra D. Thomas-Oates J.E. Visse R. van de Putte P. Goosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30508-30515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Additional interaction of UvrC with the DNA contributes to the stability (16.Moolenaar G.F. Schoot Uiterkamp R. Zwijnenburg D. Goosen N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 462-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Here we show that the DNA region at the 5′ side of the lesion is important for stable UvrC binding. Substrate G11, in which this region is missing, efficiently binds UvrB by itself, but the subsequent association with UvrC is very weak. Truncation of the other end of the DNA substrate, leaving only 4 base pairs at the 3′ side of the lesion does not destabilize UvrC binding significantly. The interaction of UvrC with the 5′-flanking region seems to be mainly with the top strand, because substrate G10, in which only the bottom strand of this region is missing forms a substantially more stable UvrBC-DNA complex than G11. An interaction with the top strand is not unexpected, because it is this strand that is incised by the UvrC protein (11.Lin J.-J. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17688-17692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Although nicking or truncation of DNA at the 3′ side of the lesion does not seem to have large effects on the formation of the UvrBC-DNA complex, it does influence both incision reactions. The introduction of a single-stranded nick opposite the 3′ incision site, which seemingly allows normal UvrB-DNA and UvrBC-DNA complex formation, almost completely blocks 3′ incision. Apparently the topology of the DNA is extremely important for this incision reaction. As argued above, the DNA in the UvrB-DNA complex (without ATP) seems to be distorted at the 3′ side of the lesion. Possibly this specific conformation is essential for the eventual positioning of the catalytic site for 3′ incision in the UvrBC-DNA incision complex. When a damaged DNA substrate is incised at the 3′ position, this immediately triggers induction of the 5′ incision. Relaxation of the DNA as a result of the 3′ incision, however, cannot be the only determinant for this second event, because a nick in the nondamaged strand (G4) does not induce 5′ incision. Apparently, specific protein-DNA contacts need to be established before 5′ incision can take place. The bottom strand adjacent to the 3′ incision position appears to be very important for these contacts, either with UvrB or with UvrC because G3 containing this region is incised very efficiently, whereas G6 lacking this strand is not incised at all.Combining our results we come to the following model. After initial recognition of damage by the UvrA2B complex, the DNA at the 5′ side of the damage is unwound, creating an entry site for the UvrB protein, which subsequently binds to the site of the damage. In the resulting UvrB-DNA complex the DNA is distorted, creating stress mainly at the right-hand side of the damage. The UvrC protein binds to the UvrB-DNA complex via the coiled-coil interaction between the C-terminal domain of UvrB and the homologous domain of UvrC (14.Moolenaar G.F. Franken K.L.M.C. Dijkstra D. Thomas-Oates J.E. Visse R. van de Putte P. Goosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30508-30515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In addition UvrC makes contacts with the DNA at the left-hand side of the damage, mainly with the damaged strand. For 3′ incision to occur, a specific DNA conformation in the region of the incision site seems essential. The subsequent incision possibly opens up the DNA in this region, thereby exposing the bottom strand at the right-hand side of the lesion. Interaction of UvrB and/or UvrC with this bottom strand triggers the 5′ incision event. In agreement with this last part of the model, it has recently been found that a damaged DNA substrate containing 2 unpaired bases 5′ and 7 or 9 unpaired bases 3′ to the lesion is efficiently incised by UvrBC at the 5′ site, without 3′ incision (20.Zou Y. Van Houten B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4889-4901Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Probably the unpairing of the DNA around the 3′ incision site sufficiently exposes the bottom strand for UvrB and/or UvrC to bind to. Nucleotide excision repair in Escherichia coli is a multi-step process that leads to the removal of a 12–13-mer oligonucleotide containing the damaged site, followed by filling in of the resulting gap by DNA polymerase I and ligation of the nick by DNA ligase (1.Sancar A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 43-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar, 2.Goosen N. Moolenaar G.F. Visse R. van de Putte P. Eckstein F. Lilley D.M.J. Nucleic Acids and Molecular Biology: DNA Repair. Springer Verlag, Berlin1998Google Scholar). The key intermediate of the repair process is the UvrB-DNA preincision complex, in which UvrB is tightly bound to the DNA at the site of the lesion. The UvrC protein interacts with this preincision complex, resulting in cleavage of the 4th or 5th phosphodiester bond 3′ to the damage. This 3′ incision is immediately followed by cleavage of the 8thphosphodiester bond on the 5′ side of the damage. The UvrB protein on its own has no significant affinity for damaged or undamaged double-stranded DNA, but very low affinity binding to single-stranded DNA carrying a lesion has been shown (3.Hsu D.S. Kim S.T. Sun Q. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8319-8327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Loading of UvrB onto damaged double-stranded DNA requires the action of the UvrA protein. A dimer of UvrA associates with UvrB in solution, and the trimeric UvrA2B complex initially binds to a damaged site in the DNA. Next, conformational changes take place in the UvrA2B-DNA complex resulting in stable binding of UvrB to the DNA and the release of UvrA (4.Orren D.K. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5237-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This UvrA-directed binding of UvrB to the DNA has been shown to require ATP hydrolysis by the UvrB protein (5.Oh E.Y. Claassen L. Thiagalingham S. Mazur S. Grossman L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4145-4159Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and the UvrA2B-associated DNA helicase activity (6.Moolenaar G.F. Visse R.

These substrates are subsequently incised by the UvrBC complex at 7 nucleotides from the 3′ end of the junction.

In this paper we investigate the role of the DNA flanking the incision positions for formation of the UvrB-DNA preincision complex and the subsequent incisions. We show that a double-stranded substrate in which DNA at the 3′ side of the damage has been removed up to the 3′ incision site can still form a stable preincision complex via the UvrA-mediated loading of the UvrB protein. Deletion of DNA on the 5′ side up to the 5′ incision position abolished the UvrA-mediated formation of the UvrB-DNA complex. In the absence of UvrA, however, the UvrB protein by itself could efficiently bind to this 5′-truncated substrate. Implications of these findings for the process of UvrA-mediated preincision complex formation will be discussed. DISCUSSIONBinding of UvrB to a damaged site in double-stranded DNA has been generally believed to require the “molecular matchmaker” function of UvrA. Here we show for the first time that UvrB by itself is capable of recognizing and binding to the site of a lesion, if this lesion is located close to the end of a double-stranded fragment. This damage-specific binding of UvrB alone seems to have a polarity, occurring when the damage is close to the 5′ end of the damaged strand but not when it is close to the 3′ end. This indicates that for the direct binding of UvrB, the protein needs to “approach” the damage from the 5′ side. This directionality is likely to be a reflection of the mechanism that UvrA uses to load UvrB onto a damaged site. After initial recognition of damage by the UvrA protein in the UvrA2B complex, the UvrA2B-associated helicase activity might transiently unwind the DNA region at the 5′ side of the damage. As a result of this, an “entry site” for UvrB is created close to the 5′ side of the damage, to which it will subsequently bind via its own damage-recognizing determinants. Several experiments described in this paper are in agreement with such a mechanism of UvrB loading: (i) On a truncated DNA fragment, which has 7 base pairs at the 5′ side of the damage, UvrA can no longer load the UvrB protein. A deletion at the other side leaving only 4 base pairs at the 3′ side of the damage, however, does not interfere with this process. Apparently for the loading process the 5′-flanking region is more important than the 3′-flanking region, which would be in agreement with an entry site function of this 5′ region. (ii) Mutants of UvrB that affect the ATPase/helicase activity of the UvrA2B complex can no longer be loaded onto a damaged site via UvrA (6.Moolenaar G.F. Visse R. Ortiz-Buysse M. Goosen N. van de Putte P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 240: 294-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The same mutants, however, do bind to the damaged site when it is close to the end of the DNA fragment. This shows that the DNA unwinding activity per se is not needed for the damage recognition, but it is more likely creating a DNA conformation that allows UvrB to access the damage,i.e. opening up of the DNA helix in the 5′ region. When the damage is located close to the end, this active opening up is no longer required. (iii) The introduction of a single-stranded nick at the 5′ incision position completely abolishes the UvrA-mediated loading of UvrB. Gel retardation experiments showed that the nick does not inhibit the damage-specific binding of the UvrA2B complex. Because the presence of a nick does not alter the number of possible DNA contacts with the UvrA and/or UvrB proteins, its effect must be topological. The DNA conformation in the protein-DNA complex after the postulated unwinding of the 5′ region would be different when a nick is present. The 19-mer top strand might even dissociate completely from the complex. A nick in the bottom strand does not interfere with the UvrA-mediated loading of UvrB, although this nick is expected to influence the topology of the DNA after unwinding as well. This could indicate that after the unwinding of the 5′-flanking region by UvrA2B, the UvrB protein mainly interacts with the top strand of this region. The presence of a nick in this strand would then prevent the access of UvrB to the damaged site.The UvrB protein by itself is capable of specifically binding to the damage of substrate G10 in the absence of ATP. The subsequent stable binding of UvrC can occur in the absence of a cofactor too. However, for the incisions to take place, ATP is indispensable, indicating that for the formation of an active UvrBC-DNA incision complex an ATP-induced conformational change of UvrB is required. The role of the cofactor in formation of the incision complex is further discussed in the accompanying paper (13.Moolenaar G.F. Pen̆a Herron M.F. Monaco V. van de Marel G.A. van Boom J.H. Visse R. Goosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8044-8050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).Once UvrA has loaded UvrB onto the DNA, the stability of the resulting preincision complex is influenced by the conformation of the damage-flanking regions. The gel retardation experiments in the absence of ATP indicate that the UvrB-DNA complex is stabilized by introduction of a single-stranded nick in either top or bottom strand at the 3′ side of the lesion. This indicates that in the UvrB-DNA complex without ATP the DNA is in a state of torsional tension. Nicking of the DNA will release this tension thereby stabilizing the complex. Because the presence of a nick at the 5′ side of the lesion (in the bottom strand) does not stabilize the UvrB-DNA complex, the DNA helix seems mainly distorted at the 3′ side of the damage. In a retardation gel with ATP, the UvrB-DNA complex of substrate G1 is much more stable than in a gel without ATP. This indicates that ATP alters the conformation of the UvrB-DNA complex such that the DNA tension in the 3′ region is (partially) released.Stable binding of UvrC to the preincision complex is largely determined by protein-protein interactions between the homologous domains of UvrB and UvrC (14.Moolenaar G.F. Franken K.L.M.C. Dijkstra D. Thomas-Oates J.E. Visse R. van de Putte P. Goosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30508-30515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Additional interaction of UvrC with the DNA contributes to the stability (16.Moolenaar G.F. Schoot Uiterkamp R. Zwijnenburg D. Goosen N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 462-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Here we show that the DNA region at the 5′ side of the lesion is important for stable UvrC binding. Substrate G11, in which this region is missing, efficiently binds UvrB by itself, but the subsequent association with UvrC is very weak. Truncation of the other end of the DNA substrate, leaving only 4 base pairs at the 3′ side of the lesion does not destabilize UvrC binding significantly. The interaction of UvrC with the 5′-flanking region seems to be mainly with the top strand, because substrate G10, in which only the bottom strand of this region is missing forms a substantially more stable UvrBC-DNA complex than G11. An interaction with the top strand is not unexpected, because it is this strand that is incised by the UvrC protein (11.Lin J.-J. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17688-17692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Although nicking or truncation of DNA at the 3′ side of the lesion does not seem to have large effects on the formation of the UvrBC-DNA complex, it does influence both incision reactions. The introduction of a single-stranded nick opposite the 3′ incision site, which seemingly allows normal UvrB-DNA and UvrBC-DNA complex formation, almost completely blocks 3′ incision. Apparently the topology of the DNA is extremely important for this incision reaction. As argued above, the DNA in the UvrB-DNA complex (without ATP) seems to be distorted at the 3′ side of the lesion. Possibly this specific conformation is essential for the eventual positioning of the catalytic site for 3′ incision in the UvrBC-DNA incision complex. When a damaged DNA substrate is incised at the 3′ position, this immediately triggers induction of the 5′ incision. Relaxation of the DNA as a result of the 3′ incision, however, cannot be the only determinant for this second event, because a nick in the nondamaged strand (G4) does not induce 5′ incision. Apparently, specific protein-DNA contacts need to be established before 5′ incision can take place. The bottom strand adjacent to the 3′ incision position appears to be very important for these contacts, either with UvrB or with UvrC because G3 containing this region is incised very efficiently, whereas G6 lacking this strand is not incised at all.Combining our results we come to the following model. After initial recognition of damage by the UvrA2B complex, the DNA at the 5′ side of the damage is unwound, creating an entry site for the UvrB protein, which subsequently binds to the site of the damage. In the resulting UvrB-DNA complex the DNA is distorted, creating stress mainly at the right-hand side of the damage. The UvrC protein binds to the UvrB-DNA complex via the coiled-coil interaction between the C-terminal domain of UvrB and the homologous domain of UvrC (14.Moolenaar G.F. Franken K.L.M.C. Dijkstra D. Thomas-Oates J.E. Visse R. van de Putte P. Goosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30508-30515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In addition UvrC makes contacts with the DNA at the left-hand side of the damage, mainly with the damaged strand. For 3′ incision to occur, a specific DNA conformation in the region of the incision site seems essential. The subsequent incision possibly opens up the DNA in this region, thereby exposing the bottom strand at the right-hand side of the lesion. Interaction of UvrB and/or UvrC with this bottom strand triggers the 5′ incision event. In agreement with this last part of the model, it has recently been found that a damaged DNA substrate containing 2 unpaired bases 5′ and 7 or 9 unpaired bases 3′ to the lesion is efficiently incised by UvrBC at the 5′ site, without 3′ incision (20.Zou Y. Van Houten B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4889-4901Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Probably the unpairing of the DNA around the 3′ incision site sufficiently exposes the bottom strand for UvrB and/or UvrC to bind to.

MR is closely related to the glucocorticoid receptor, with which it shares a highly homologous primary structure organized in distinct functional domains (1.Arriza J.L. Weinberger C. Cerelli G. Glaser T.M. Handelin B.L. Housman D.E. Evans R.M. Science. 1987; 237: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (1643) Google Scholar). MR binds with the same affinity aldosterone and glucocorticoid hormones; however, in epithelial tissues, mineralocorticoid selectivity of aldosterone action is ensured by the presence of the enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 (2.Albiston A.L. Obeyesekere W.R. Smith R.E. Krozowski Z.S. Mol. Cell.

In addition, other mineralocorticoid selectivity-conferring mechanisms seem to be necessary to fully account for receptor specificity. At the receptor level, MR is able to discriminate between aldosterone and glucocorticoids in ligand-dependent conformational changes and stabilization of the ligand binding domain (5.Couette B.

MR is expressed in a wide variety of tissues, including polarized epithelial cells of the distal nephron, colon, and sweat glands, which all co-express 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2, and where MR is known to regulate transepithelial ionic transports, mostly sodium reabsorption (11.Bonvalet J.P. Kidney Int. Suppl. 1998; 65: S49-S56PubMed Google Scholar). MR is also found in non-epithelial target cells of the central nervous (12.Anderson N.S. Fanestil D.D. Endocrinology. 1976; 98: 676-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and cardiovascular systems (13.Pearce P. Funder J.W. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol.

Circulation. 1995; 92: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar); however, in these tissues, the exact nature of MR actions remains largely unknown. The regulatory mechanisms controlling the tissue-specific expression of MR is still poorly understood. We have recently identified two functional promoter regions in the human MR (hMR) gene (15.Zennaro M.-C. Le Menuet D. Lombès M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1549-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), which have been shown to direct expression of two hMR mRNA isoforms, hMRα and hMRβ, that differ by their 5′-untranslated sequences (16.Zennaro M.-C.

Using a series of hMR promoter constructs in transient transfection assays, we have characterized the 5′-flanking regions of the two first untranslated exons, 1α and 1β, and defined two regulatory sequences corresponding to a proximal P1 and a distal P2 promoter respectively. The P1 promoter (1 kb of exon 1α 5′-flanking region) possesses a stronger transcriptional activity than the P2 promoter (1.7-kb fragment of exon 1β 5′-flanking region). In addition, although both promoters were inducible by glucocorticoids, only the distal P2 promoter appears to be sensitive to mineralocorticoids (15.Zennaro M.-C. Le Menuet D. Lombès M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1549-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The fact that alternative promoter utilization controls in a extremely fine-tuned manner the expression of hMR isoforms may represent a key step in regulating multiple aldosterone actions in various target tissues. In the present study, transgenic mouse models were created to better understand the in vivo function of hMR alternative promoters as well as to study mechanisms of aldosterone action by means of establishment of novel mineralocorticoid-sensitive cell lines, which are not yet available. For this purpose, we have developed a targeted oncogenesis strategy in which the P1 and P2 promoter regions were fused to the simian virus 40 large T antigen (TAg) to generate two transgenes, called P1.TAg and P2.TAg, in order to drive oncogene expression in normally MR-expressing cells. TAg was used as a reporter gene to analyze cis-acting elements of each promoter sequence as well as for its properties that facilitate immortalization of cells in a variety of lineages by inactivating the retinoblastoma gene product and p53 (17.Furth P.A.

All P1.TAg animals developed tumors of the brown adipose tissue called hibernomas, whereas P2.TAg mice exhibited primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET) and leiomyosarcomas. More importantly, as compared with the endogenous mMR expression in wild type animals, analyses of transgene expression patterns revealed a distinct tissue-specific utilization of hMR alternative promoters. Finally, we have succeeded in generating various novel cell lines originating from neoplastic as well as normal tissues of transgenic mice, which constitute original cellular models to further identify the molecular and cellular mechanisms of mineralocorticoid signaling. The P1.TAg and P2.TAg were constructed using the optimized transgenic vector H31 kindly provided by Dr. L. M. Houdebine (INRA, Jouy en Josas, France). It essentially contains an untranslated region for stabilizing mRNA transcripts and the terminal block of the human β-globin including the last intron and polyadenylation site. As presented in Fig.1, a HindIII-AvaII fragment (HA, −965, +216) containing approximately 1 kb of hMR P1 proximal promoter and the beginning of exon 1α blunt-ended with Klenow DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and aSspI-SspI fragment (SS, −1673, +123 bp) including 1.7 kb of the P2 distal promoter and the beginning of exon 1β were ligated into the unique SmaI site of H31 vector to generate the P1-H31 and P2-H31 plasmids, respectively. Subsequently for each construct, the 2.2-kb StuI-BamHI fragment, which contains the entire coding sequence of the SV40 TAg, was inserted into the unique BstXI site of P1-H31 and P2-H31 plasmid after filling in all recessive ends with Klenow treatment. P1.TAg and P2.TAg transgenes were separated from plasmid vector sequences byNotI digestion and purified after 0.7% low melting gel agarose electrophoresis with Elutip-d columns (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany) and ethanol precipitation. Transgene DNA resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, were microinjected into fertilized oocytes obtained from B6D2 mice at the Service d'Expérimentation Animale et de Transgenèse (SEAT, CNRS, Villejuif, France). Founders harboring the transgene were first identified from polymerase chain reaction analyses of tail DNA from 2-week-old mice with oligonucleotides specific to the SV40 TAg, using forward and reverse primers (S5108, 5′-TTGAAAGGAGTGCCTGGGGGAAT-3′; A4920, 5′-CAGTTGCATCCCAGAAGCCTCCA-3′) with an annealing temperature of 54 °C for a 189-bp amplified fragment. To ascertain the presence of the integrated transgene, PCR analyses were also performed with antisense primer A4920 and specific forward primers in each of the two hMR promoters, S180 (5′-TGCAACAGGTAGACGCGAGAGA-3′) and SC8 (5′-CCGCTGCCTCGCCGCCTCTTGTA-3′) for P1 and P2 promoters, respectively. Thirty cycles (95 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 45 s) were used to amplify the ∼1.3-kb fragments. Number of integrated copies of transgenes was determined by Southern blot analysis of 10 μg of genomic DNA digested by SalI using standard protocols (18.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with P1.TAg or P2.TAg 32P-labeled probes (Rediprime II random prime labeling system; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Total RNA was extracted from various tissues of wild type and transgenic mice. Tissues were disaggregated with a Polytron homogenizer in Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) and total RNA isolated following manufacturer's instructions. The TAg riboprobe synthesis was achieved using a 1665-bpPstI-PstI fragment of TAg coding region inserted in pBluescriptII KS+ plasmid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). This plasmid linearized by PvuII was used to synthesize a 377-base32P-labeled riboprobe with T3 RNA polymerase (riboprobe kit; Promega Madison, WI). The expected protected fragment is 302 bases long. The rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) probe was synthesized using T7 RNA polymerase after digestion of a pBluescript SK-GAPDH plasmid (kindly provided by Dr. Escoubet, Paris, France) by PvuII and StyI. Unprotected riboprobe was 184 bases long with a 164-base protected fragment. The mMR riboprobe was synthesized with a PstI-PstI fragment of mMR exon 2 inserted into pBlueScript KS (kindly provided by Drs. S. Berger and G. Schütz, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany), linearized by StuI, using T7 polymerase. This generated a 452-base probe and a protected fragment of 380 bases. Ribonuclease protection assays (RPA) were performed as described previously (19.Kaabache T. Barraud B. Feldmann G. Bernuau D. Lardeux B. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 232: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μg of total RNA are hybridized overnight at 50 °C in a formamide Pipes hybridization buffer with 4 × 105 cpm TAg or mMR probe and 5 × 104 cpm GAPDH probe as an internal control. Non-hybridized RNA was digested at 30 °C for 1 h with a ribonuclease A and T1 mixture followed by a 30-min proteinase K and SDS treatment. After phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, protected fragments were electrophoresed on a 6% polyacrylamide/urea gel. Gels were dried and fixed in 10% acetic acid. Radioactivity was counted generally overnight with an InstantImager (Packard, Meriden, CT), followed by an autoradiography. Results are expressed in arbitrary units and correspond to the ratio between TAg- or mMR-specific countsversus GAPDH signal. Tissues and organs were collected at the time of necropsy and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. Sections (7 μm) were cut and stained with hematoxylin-eosin. Immunohistochemical studies were performed on some tissue sections of different transgenic animals. To enhance signal, sections were immersed in a 10 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 6, and passed through microwave heating for 5 min, three times at 500 watts. To reduce background staining due to endogenous peroxidase activities, some tissue sections were preincubated with 3% H2O2. The presence of SV40 TAg protein was detected using a 1:20 to 1:50 dilution of the monoclonal anti-SV40 TAg antibody (Ab-2; Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA). Specific antibodies against vimentin (Dako, Copenhagen, Denmark), desmin (Dako), glial fibrillary acidic protein (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA), neurofilament (Novocastra, Le Perret en Yvelines, France), and vascular smooth muscle actin (Sigma) were also used. Sections were then incubated with a secondary biotinylated horse anti-mouse IgG (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and the avidin-biotin peroxidase complex (Vectastain Elite ABC kit, Vector Laboratories). Tissues were counterstained with Mayer's hemalum. Specificity of the reaction was tested by omitting primary antibodies. For immunocytochemistry, cells were cultured on glass coverslides, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, rinsed for 5 min with PBS, incubated with 100% ethanol for 5 min, and stored at −20 °C before processing the immunocytochemical experiments. To prepare TAg sense and antisense riboprobes, a 885-bp HindIII-HindIII fragment of TAg coding sequence subcloned in pBlueScriptII KS+ (Stratagene) was used. Uridine 35S-labeled probes (1000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were synthesized using T3 RNA polymerase and plasmid linearized by BamHI for sense probe while antisense probe was generated using KpnI-linearized plasmid and T7 RNA polymerase. Other reagents are from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). In situ hybridization was performed on 7-μm sections of paraffin-embedded organs. All steps were carried out as described previously (20.Zennaro M.-C. Farman N. Bonvalet J.-P. Lombès M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 1345-1352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After rehydration of sections in graded ethanol solutions, sections were postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (in PBS); proteinase K (0.8 μg/ml) treatment and a 10-min acetylation step were then carried out (0.1 m triethanolamine with 0.25m acetic anhydride, and successively 5 min with PBS, 5 min with 145 mm NaCl). Sections were covered with 100 μl of the hybridization mixture (50% formamide, 1 mm DTT, 2× SSC, 10% dextran sulfate, 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 4 × 106 cpm of 35S-labeled probe), covered with a parafilm (American National Can, Neenah, WI), and incubated overnight at 50 °C. Posthybridization treatment consists of an initial wash in 5× SSC, 10 mm DTT, at 50 °C for 30 min, followed by high stringency wash in 50% formamide, 2× SSC, 0.1 m DTT at 65 °C for 20 min and several washes in NaCl-Tris-EDTA (0.5m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA) at 37 °C. Sections were incubated in RNase A (20 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 20 min. After rinsing with 0.1× SSC for 15 min, sections were dehydrated and dried. Slides were dipped in Kodak NTB2 (melted at 42 °C), dried, and exposed at −20 °C for 2–4 weeks. Slides were developed and counterstained with toluidine. Different P1.TAg and P2.TAg animals were used in an attempt to derive various cell lines originating from normal as well as neoplastic tissues. Briefly, at the time of surgery of anesthetized animals with 0.5 ml of Avertin (Fluka, L'Isle d'Abeau Chesne, France), (150 μg/ml) intraperitoneally per animal, organs were excised under sterile conditions, cut in small pieces, rinsed twice with culture medium, and teased with two forceps in a Petri dish containing 10 ml of defined medium containing fungizone (1 μg/ml). The medium was composed of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 20 mm Hepes. After centrifugation, pelleted cells were rinsed twice with medium and grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. For some tissues, special protocols were used to isolate specific cells. Distal nephron fragments were microdissected, colonic mucosa was scrapped, and small ventricular heart samples were treated with collagenase. The cell culture medium was generally replaced every 2 days. All cell lines were cultured for at least 20 passages for approximately 6 months, stored under liquid nitrogen, and successfully recultured after thawing. For some cell lines, cells have been subcloned by limiting dilution or after microscopic isolation of a particular clone. Total RNA was extracted from cells using the trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) and subjected to DNase I treatment in order to avoid any genomic DNA contamination. Briefly, 2 μg of total RNA were reverse-transcribed with 200 units of reverse transcriptase using the SuperscriptTM II kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. cDNA was then amplified for 30–35 cycles in a total volume of 25 μl containing 1× PCR buffer (50 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4), 200 μm dNTPs, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 pmol of sense and antisense primers, and 0.25 units of Taq polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Specific gene expressions were detected using specific oligonucleotides to involucrin (sense primer mInv 359, 5′-AACAGCAGCAAGAGCCACAAATG-3′; antisense primer mInv 612, 5′GCTTTTCTCCTGGAATCAGTTTC-3′), MUC1 (sense MUC1 3103, 5′-TAACGGAGATTTTCTGGGGATCT-3′; antisense MUC1 3653, 5′-AGGAAATAGACGATAGCCAAAGC-3′), nestin (sense nestSC129, 5′-GGAGGGTTGCGTCGGGGAAG-3′; antisense nestBR568, 5′-CTCCTCCTCGTGCGCGGCTCG-3′), HNF1β (sense HNFSC154, 5′-AGCGGGGCGGATCTCGACACCAA-3′; and antisense HNFBR465, 5′-GGGTCTTCATGGGGGTGCCCTTG-3′), smooth muscle α-actin (sense αACTSC61, 5′-GGAAGACAGCACAGCCCTGGTGT-3′; antisense αACTBR391, 5′-TCATTTTCTCCCGGTTGGCCTTA-3′) according to the mouse vascular smooth muscle α-actin cDNA (GenBank™ accession nos.X13297 and X07935). The thermal cycling program was 95 °C for 45 s, following an hybridization step at 56 °C (involucrin), 57 °C (MUC1), 60 °C (HNF1β), 59 °C (α-actin) or 62 °C (nestin), each for 45 s, and an elongation step at 72 °C for 45 s. Involucrin (276 bp), MUC1 (289 bp), nestin (460 bp), HNF1β (334 bp), and α-actin (353 bp) PCR products were run on a 2% agarose gel. In an attempt to determine the tissue specific pattern of endogenous mMR expression, we first analyzed mMR mRNA distribution in various tissues of B6D2 wild type mice by ribonuclease protection assays. As shown in Fig.2, a reproducible expression pattern was obtained with five different animals, although with some individual differences. The colon was always the site of the highest level of mMR mRNA expression. The receptor was also strongly expressed in the lung, salivary glands, and brain. Interestingly, mMR transcripts were clearly detected in the testis and uterus, a finding that has not been reported to date. As expected, mMR mRNA was found in the kidney and heart, but a detectable signal could also be evidenced in the liver, spleen, muscle, and skin. Quantitative analyses were performed to precisely define the relative abundance of mMR transcripts among mouse tissues. Fig. 2 B presents the results of mRNA levels expressed as a percentage of the colonic expression. Note that renal mMR level is relatively low, due to the fact that, in kidney, MR expression is restricted to a minority of cells of the distal nephron. This pattern of tissue-specific mMR expression was subsequently used as a basis to compare expression of the transgene driven by each of the hMR promoters. The P1.TAg transgene consists of 1 kb of hMR P1 proximal promoter and 0.2 kb of exon 1α inserted upstream of the TAg coding sequence (see Fig. 1). TableI summarizes the main characteristics of transgenic animals obtained after two series of injections (Ref. 21.Zennaro M.-C. Le Menuet D. Viengchareun S. Walker F. Ricquier D. Lombès M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1254-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar and present work). As already described for the first transgenic animals (21.Zennaro M.-C. Le Menuet D. Viengchareun S. Walker F. Ricquier D. Lombès M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1254-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), all founders presented with malignant liposarcomas originating from brown adipose tissue (hibernomas) before 4 months of age. Hibernomas mostly developed in the dorsal region and were generally extremely voluminous (up to few grams), resulting in a buffalo-like appearance of the transgenic animal. Unfortunately, the moribund condition and/or the premature death of the transgenic P1.TAg animals prevented derivation of mice lines. Most transgenic founders were sacrificed before their condition deteriorated except mice 18 and 22, which appeared normal at sacrifice at 2 weeks of age. Complete autopsy was performed for each founder animal. Tissues samples were collected for histological evaluation, RNA extraction, and/or tissue culture attempts.Table IPhenotypic features of P1.TAg transgenic miceFounderSexAge of deathCopy no.Phenotypeweeks16F1715Interscapular hibernoma17M55Perirachidian hibernoma18F25Normal at sacrifice20F152Interscapular hibernoma22F210Normal at sacrifice34F210Dorsal hibernoma36M151Small mediastinal hibernoma37F21Dorsal hibernoma40M135Dorsal hibernoma44F1010Dorsal hibernomaNumber of integrated transgene copies was determined by Southern blot analysis after digestion of 10 μg of genomic DNA with SalI and hybridization with a P1.TAg probe following standard techniques. Open table in a new tab Number of integrated transgene copies was determined by Southern blot analysis after digestion of 10 μg of genomic DNA with SalI and hybridization with a P1.TAg probe following standard techniques. SV40 TAg mRNA expression was analyzed in various tissues of several transgenic founders by RPA. TAg signal was quantified and normalized by the GAPDH signal. There was no hybridization of TAg riboprobe with total RNA samples of wild type mouse organs (data not shown). Fig.3 illustrates the tissue-specific pattern of transgene expression observed in mouse 22, a 2-week-old female. Although no hibernoma was observed in this animal, its interscapular brown adipose tissue already expressed high levels of TAg, suggesting that there might already be a transformation process ongoing, and that P1 promoter is probably transcriptionally active during early life in this tissue. Moreover, RPA revealed transgene expression in almost every tissue examined. Indeed, TAg was detected in the salivary glands, lung, brain, and liver and, at lower levels, in the skin. The level of transgene transcripts was relatively low in the kidney and colon of this animal. As the integration site is known to influence the expression of the transgene, we compared the tissue-specific pattern of TAg expression in three other P1.TAg founder animals, 36, 40, and 44, in order to analyze the P1 promoter utilization (data not shown). Although absolute TAg expression levels vary among animals, relative tissue-specific expression was comparable and exhibited some common features. Most importantly, in all founders highest levels of transgene expression were detected in the testis and the salivary glands, while the heart, kidney, and colon expressed relatively low transgene mRNA amounts. In other tissues, intermediary levels of TAg messengers were detected with some gender differences in the liver where expression was weaker in males. To compare the relative strength of hMR P1 promoter in vivowith that of the endogenous mMR regulatory sequences, we measured TAg and mMR expression in the same tissue samples. As shown in Fig.4 for P1.TAg mouse 40, the tissue-specific pattern of mMR expression was similar to that observed in the wild type animals (see Fig. 2), indicating that the presence of TAg does not modify mMR transcription. The TAg/mMR ratio was then calculated for each tissue. In the salivary glands and testis, transgene expression far exceeds that of mMR; in contrast, TAg and mMR were almost equally expressed in the lung, liver, and brain. Although TAg expression was low in the heart, it was in the same range than that of mMR in this organ. Finally, in the kidney and colon, TAg mRNA levels were clearly lower than those of mMR transcripts. Immunohistochemical studies with an anti-TAg antibody were used to determine which type of cells expressed the oncogene (Fig.5). A strong nuclear staining was observed in the distal nephron, most notably in the distal convoluted tubule (Fig. 5 A) and the cortical collecting ducts (Fig.5 B), whereas the proximal tubules and glomeruli were negative. This localization was identical to that of renal MR. In the liver (Fig. 5 C), some hepatocytes presented a nuclear labeling, while some others were clearly negative, indicating that the transgene was not evenly expressed in hepatocytes. Similarly, TAg expression was clearly evidenced in some cells of the central nervous system (Fig. 5 D), most likely neurons, while smaller nuclei of other cells were devoid of immunoreactivity. In the heart, some nuclei of cardiomyocytes exhibited a positive labeling, most of them presented nuclear abnormalities (data not shown). Altogether, our results demonstrate that 1 kb of P1 promoter region is sufficient to direct transgene expression in all MR-expressing tissues, although the strength of its transcriptional activity varies among organs. In addition, the P1-driven TAg is expressed in an appropriate localization especially in the kidney. The P2.TAg transgene was constructed with 1.6 kb of the distal hMR P2 promoter and 0.1 kb of exon 1β driving expression of TAg cDNA (see Fig. 1).TableII presents results concerning the three founder animals obtained (mice 45, 54, and 55) and their offspring. Lines could only be developed for mice 45 and 54, as mouse 55 died before breeding. The three transgenic founders and all F1 animals examined presented with neurological abnormalities such as major motor disorders related to the formation of brain tumors. Importantly, none of the P2.TAg animals developed hibernomas. Transgenic mice died at approximately 6 months of age. At necropsy, macroscopic examination of all founders and some of their offspring revealed the presence of cerebral tumors associated with thymus hyperplasia. Histological studies disclosed neoplastic tissue in the brain. As presented in Fig.6 A, a typical field shows a highly cellular primitive neuroec"

During the course of apoptosis, the C-terminal cleavage product of PARP interacted with intact PARP and down-regulated PARP activity by blocking the homodimerization of PARP. The basic leucine zipper motif in the auto-modification domain of the C-terminal fragment of PARP represented the site of association, and Leu405 was critical to the ability of the basic leucine zipper motif to associate with intact PARP. The expression of the C-terminal fragment of PARP stimulated UV-mediated apoptosis. These results suggest that the C-terminal cleavage product of PARP produced during apoptosis blocks the homodimerization of PARP and inhibits the cellular PARP activity. The inhibition of the cellular PARP activity might prevent cellular NAD+ depletion and stimulate apoptosis by maintaining the basal cellular energy level required for the completion of apoptosis.

Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). Numerous cellular proteins are cleaved by caspases during the course of apoptosis. However, the biochemical consequence of proteolytic cleavage of the substrate proteins by caspases during the course of apoptosis has been poorly understood. PARP1 has been known to be cleaved by caspases during apoptosis (2.Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2346) Google Scholar). The cleavage of PARP yields a 25-kDa N-terminal fragment containing two zinc-fingers and an 89-kDa C-terminal fragment containing the auto-modification domain and the NAD+ binding domain (3.Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Ottaviano Y. Davidson N.E. Poirier G.G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3976-3985PubMed Google Scholar). The two zinc-finger motifs in the N-terminal DNA-binding domain bind to DNA at the sites of single- or double-stranded breaks, resulting in the catalytic activation of PARP. The DNA-bound, activated PARP utilizes NAD+ to synthesize poly(ADP-ribose) on various nuclear proteins, such as DNA polymerase α (4.Yoshihara S. Simbulan C.M.G. Mol. Cell.

Sci. 1995; 20: 405-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Many studies have described PARP as a positive regulator of apoptosis. The overexpression of PARP in the transfected cells was known to stimulate apoptosis (12.Van Gool L. Meyer R. Tobiasch E. Cziepluch C. Jauniaux J.C. Mincheva A. Lichter P. Poirier G.G. Burkle A. Kupper J.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The pro-apoptotic role of PARP activation was further supported by the finding that a specific chemical inhibitor of PARP, 3-aminobenzamide, suppresses apoptosis (13.Nosseri C. Coppola S. Ghibelli L. Exp. Cell. Res. 1994; 212: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). However, the controversial roles of PARP during apoptosis have been argued in the studies using PARP-deficient mice. Wang et al. (14.Wang Z.Q. Stingl L. Morrison C. Jantsch M. Los M. Schulze-Osthoff K. Wagner E.F. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2347-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar) proposed a dispensable role of PARP in apoptosis by showing a normal level of apoptosis in PARP-deficient mouse cells treated with various apoptosis inducers. An indispensible role of PARP on apoptosis was presented by Simbulan-Rosenthal et al. (15.Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M. Rosenthal D.S. Iyer S. Boulares A.H. Smulson M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13703-13712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), who reported an early burst of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of nuclear proteins during Fas-mediated apoptosis in PARP+/+ cells, whereas no induction of apoptosis was shown in PARP−/− cells by Fas stimulation. The importance of PARP cleavage in apoptosis has recently been recognized. For example, it has been suggested that the activity of PARP is stimulated by DNA breaks during the early course of apoptosis, but proteolytic cleavage decreases PARP activity in the late course of apoptosis (16.Rosenthal D.S. Ding R. Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M. Vaillancourt J.P. Nicholson D.W. Smulson M. Exp. Cell. Res. 1997; 232: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Oliver et al. (17.Oliver F.J. de la Rubia G. Rolli V. Ruiz-Ruiz M.C. de Murcia G. Menissier-de Murcia J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33533-33539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) observed a delayed apoptosis in PARP−/− cells expressing an uncleavable mutant of PARP. They suggested that PARP cleavage might be a sign that cells should undergo apoptosis because cells were unable to repair the cellular injury triggered by the apoptosis inducers. More recently, the importance of PARP cleavage during apoptosis was emphasized by the finding that the extensive poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of p53 early during apoptosis decreases, as activated caspase-3 cleaves PARP and the expression of p53-responsive pro-apoptotic genes, bax andFas, is elevated during the late course of apoptosis (18.Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M. Rosenthal D.S. Luo R. Smulson M.E. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2190-2194PubMed Google Scholar). However, the biological relevance of PARP cleavage during apoptosis and the cellular function of the cleavage products have not been yet clarified. Recent studies have proposed that an adequate level of intracellular ATP is required for the completion of apoptosis (19.Leist M. Single B. Castoldi A.F. Kuhnle S. Nicotera P. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1481-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (1642) Google Scholar, 20.Eguchi Y. Srinivasan A. Tomaselli K.J. Shimizu S. Tsujimoto Y. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2174-2181PubMed Google Scholar). Because the intracellular ATP level is directly affected by the catalytic activity of PARP, apoptosis, an energy-requiring process, may well be influenced by PARP activity. The N-terminal fragment of PARP containing the DNA-binding domain preferentially binds to DNA breaks and prevents the activation of PARP, whose activity is stimulated by DNA binding (21.Rhun Y.L. Kirkland J.B. Shah G.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The pro-apoptotic role of the N-terminal fragment of PARP on apoptosis has been strongly supported by a recent finding that the N-terminal fragment of PARP irreversibly binds to DNA ends produced during apoptosis (22.Smulson M.E. Pang D. Jung M. Dimtchev A. Chasovskikh S. Spoonde A. Simbulan-Rosenthal C. Rosenthal D. Yakovlev A. Dritschilo A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3495-3498PubMed Google Scholar). However, the role of the C-terminal fragment of PARP on apoptosis has not been delineated. In the present study, we propose a putative role for the C-terminal cleavage product of PARP on apoptosis based on the following findings: (a) the C-terminal fragment of PARP interacts with intact PARP through an association between the auto-modification domains and (b) the C-terminal fragment suppresses its catalytic activity by blocking homodimerization of PARP. We have found that the disruption of homodimerization of PARP by the cleaved C-terminal fragment stimulates apoptosis in UV-treated HeLa cells. Radioactive chemicals, including [adenylated-32P]NAD+ (∼1,000 Ci/mmol) and [35S]methionine (1,000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Anti-PARP monoclonal antibody against the C-terminal domain of PARP (MCA 1522) was purchased from Serotech. Monoclonal antibody against glutathione S-transferase (GST) was supplied by Sigma. Anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP) IgG was from CLONTECH. Monoclonal antibody against hemaglutinin (HA) was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Annexin V-FITC was purchased from Pharmingen. The cDNA encoding full-length human PARP and truncated PARP fragments were cloned in-frame to pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH) or pEBG vector to produce GFP or GST fusion products, respectively. For the active transport of GFP-N214 and GFP-M in the nuclei of HeLa cells, the PKKKRK sequence of the nuclear localization signal (NLS) in SV40 large T-antigen (23.Kalderon D.B. Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 499-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1864) Google Scholar) was inserted between GFP and the N termini of PARP fragments by polymerase chain reaction using oligomers of 5′-GGAATTCAAGCTTCGCCAAAGAAAAAAGCGAAAGTCGACGCGC-3′ and 5′-GCGCGTCGACTTTCGCTTTTTTCTTTGGCGAAGCTTGAATTCC-3′. N214-NLS and M-NLS were then prepared by polymerase chain reaction to construct pEBG-N214 and pEBG-M, respectively. The vector constructs encoding PARP fragments were transfected into cells by employing LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). HeLa cells (107) were transiently co-transfected with 2 μg of pSRα-HA-PARP and 2 μg of pEBG, pEBG-N214, pEBG-C215, pEBG-M, pEBG-PARPΔM, or pEBG-MΔbZip. After incubation for 36 h, cells were irradiated with 50 J/m2 UV and incubated for 6 h. The cellular PARP activity was measured by the method of Grube et al. (24.Grube K. Kupper J. Burkle A. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 193: 236-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Permeabilized cells were incubated with 10 μCi/ml of [32P]NAD+ for 30 min at 30 °C. Cells were lysed by adding Nonidet P-40 (final concentration, 1%), and HA-tagged PARP (HA-PARP) was immunoprecipitated using monoclonal antibody against HA. The catalytic activity of PARP was assessed by examining auto-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of HA-PARP in 10% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. PARP derivatives were cloned in pGEX-5X-3, and GST-fused PARP fragments were produced inEscherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells. Purified GST fusion products (1 μg) were transferred to 200 μl of an assay buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 0.05% bovine serum albumin, and 5% glycerol (25.Takayama S. Sato T. Krajewski S. Kochel K. Irie S. Millan J.A. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 279-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). The35S-labeled PARP was prepared by in vitrotranscription/translation procedures using TNT linked kit (Promega).In vitro translated 35S-labeled PARP was treated with 1 unit of DNase I for 30 min prior to the incubation with GST fusion products at 4 °C for 1 h. The GST fusion products were recovered in glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). The 35S-labeled PARP bound to GST fusion products was analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and subsequent autoradiography. HeLa cells (107) were transfected with 2 μg of pEBG, pEBG-N214, pEBG-C215, pEBG-M, pEBG-PARPΔM or pEBG-MΔbZip and incubated for 36 h. Cells were lysed in a lysis buffer containing 100 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl and 1% Nonidet P-40 for 30 min on ice. After centrifugation of cell lysate at 10,000 × g for 5 min, the resulting supernatant was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin for 1 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and the bound proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using monoclonal antibody against the C terminus of PARP following by 10% SDS-PAGE. Cells were lysed in a lysis buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mg/ml leupeptin. Caspase activity was measured using a fluorogenic peptide substrate, zVAD-AMC (Bachem). Cell lysate proteins (10 μg) were incubated with 20 μmof zVAD-AMC for 2 h at 30 °C, and caspase activity was monitored fluorometrically in a fluorescence spectrophotometer (excitation, 366 nm; emission, 465 nm). HeLa cells (105) expressing GFP fusion products were irradiated with 100J/m2UV, resuspended in 100 μl of an incubation buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 5% Annexin-V-FITC solution (Pharmingen) and incubated at room temperature for 15 min in the dark. Green fluorescent and annexin-V positive cells were analyzed by fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACScalibur System; Becton-Dickinson) (26.Koopman G. Reutelingsperger C.P.M. Kuijten G.A.M. Keehnen R.M.J. Pals S.T. van Oers M.H.J. Blood. 1994; 84: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The apoptotic morphology of cells were evaluated by fluorescence microscopic observation (excitation, 490 nm; emission, 510 nm). After the induction of apoptosis, cells were fixed with 4% para-formaldehyde for 30 min, and apoptotic cells expressing GFP with condensed nuclei were counted after staining the cells with Hoechst33342 (1 μg/ml) for 10 min. PARP is a catalytic dimer, and the self-association of PARP is known to stimulate its catalytic activity (27.Bauer P.I. Buki K.G. Hakam A. Kun E. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 28.Mendoza-Alvarez H. Alvarez-Gonzalez R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22575-22580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PARP domains participating in the self-association were examined as shown in Fig. 1. GST-fused PARP fragments were incubated with [35S]PARP prepared by in vitrotranscription/translation procedures, and [35S]PARP specifically bound to GST-fused PARP fragments was resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE after GST pull-down. To exclude the possibility of intermolecular linking of PARP mediated by the DNA duplex that contacts the DNA-binding domains of separate PARP molecules, DNA employed inin vitro transcription/translation procedures was digested with DNase I before GST pull-down. The interaction between intact PARP and the N-terminal fragments that contain the DNA-binding domain disappeared after DNase I treatment, suggesting that the association was mediated by DNA. In contrast, the C-terminal fragments of PARP maintained the association with [35S]PARP after DNase I treatment (Fig. 1 B). Data shown in Fig. 1 Cindicate that the auto-modification domain of PARP is the site of intermolecular association. A bZip motif (amino acids 394–422) known to participate in protein-protein interaction (29.Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1989; 243: 1681-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 30.O'Shea E.K. Rutkowski R. Stafford III, W.F. Kim P.S. Science. 1989; 245: 646-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) has been identified in the auto-modification domain of PARP. Thus, we examined whether the bZip motif in the auto-modification domain provides a structural framework for the intermolecular association. Data in Fig.1 C strongly suggest that the bZip motif in the auto-modification domain of PARP represents the site of the association. The intermolecular association of the cellular PARP was studied in Fig.2. GST-fused PARP fragments were expressed in HeLa cells, and the association of GST fusion products with the cellular PARP was monitored by immunoblot analysis using anti-PARP monoclonal antibody (Fig. 2 A). Data demonstrate that the bZip motif in the auto-modification domain interacts with the cellular PARP. A putative role of the C-terminal fragment of PARP on the self-association was investigated in cells co-expressing HA-tagged PARP (HA-PARP) with GST-fused PARP fragments. The association of the endogenous cellular PARP with HA-PARP was almost completely inhibited by the PARP fragments containing the auto-modification domain (C215 and M). However, a PARP fragment that lacks the auto-modification domain (PARPΔM) or an auto-modification domain that lacks the bZip (MΔbZip) failed to block the self-association of PARP in the transfected cells (Fig. 2 B). The bZip motif in the auto-modification domain of PARP contains invariable leucine residues (31.Uchida K. Hanai S. Ishikawa K. Ozawa Y. Uchida M. Sugimura T. Miwa M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3481-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, the function of the conserved leucine residues was evaluated in an experiment in which the leucine residues in the bZip motif were substituted, and the association of intact PARP with the mutated auto-modification domain was examined (Fig. 3). The leucine residues in the bZip motif were important for the association, and Leu405was of critical importance. The auto-modification domain in which Leu405 was substituted to Arg405 failed to interact with 35S-labeled PARP prepared by in vitro transcription/translation. However, the association between the auto-modification domain and intact PARP was not disturbed by the substitution of leucine residues to valine, implicating that hydrophobic interaction is involved in the association. The role of the C-terminal fragment of PARP on the cellular PARP activity was examined in co-transfected HeLa cells expressing HA-PARP and GST-fused PARP fragments. Cells were irradiated with 50 J/m2 UV and incubated for 30 min in a culture medium containing [32P]NA+. HA-PARP was then isolated by immunoprecipitation, and the cellular PARP was assessed by the transfer of 32P-labeled ADP-ribose moieties from NAD+ to HA-PARP. The expression of the C-terminal fragments that contain the bZip motif (C-215 and M) suppressed the cellular PARP activity. The auto-modification domain that lacks the bZip motif (MΔbZip) failed to interfere with the cellular PARP activity. Data also showed that the cellular PARP activity was inhibited by the expression of PARP fragments containing N-terminal fragment (N-214 and PARPΔM), a known trans-dominant inhibitor of PARP (32.Molinete M. Vermeulen W. Burkle A. Murcia M. Kupper J.H. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. de Murcia G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2109-2117Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 33.Schreiber V. Hunting D. Trucco C. Gowans B. Grunwald D. de Murcia G. de Murcia J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4753-4757Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). These results implicate that the C-terminal fragment of PARP as well as N-terminal fragment is the trans-dominant inhibitor of the resident PARP in HeLa cells (Fig.4). Apoptotic responses followed by UV irradiation (100 J/m2) were evaluated by measuring the activation of zVAD-directed caspase and annexin-V binding to phosphatidyl serine at the surface of apoptotic HeLa cells. PARP cleavage products did not interfere with the caspase activation in cells undergoing apoptosis (Fig.5 A). The expression of the N-terminal or C-terminal fragment containing the bZip motif, induced elevated level of UV-mediated apoptosis, as assessed by the appearance of annexin-V binding at the cell surface (Fig. 5 B). In addition, cells expressing the N-terminal or C-terminal fragment containing the bZip motif showed morphological changes characteristic to apoptosis, such as condensed nuclei (Fig. 5 C). Although PARP cleavage has been used as a prominent biochemical hallmark of apoptosis, the physiological relevance and functional consequence of PARP cleavage during apoptosis have not been clarified. A recent report by Oliver et al. (17.Oliver F.J. de la Rubia G. Rolli V. Ruiz-Ruiz M.C. de Murcia G. Menissier-de Murcia J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33533-33539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) showed that Fas-induced apoptosis was delayed in cells expressing an uncleavable PARP mutant. Furthermore, Herceg and Wang (34.Herceg Z. Wang Z.-Q. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5124-5133Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) reported that the failure of PARP cleavage induced necrosis by the depletion of cellular energy in cells treated with various apoptotic inducers. These results suggested that the inactivation of PARP by the caspase-mediated proteolytic cleavage is a necessary requirement for the completion of apoptosis. In the present study, we attempted to interpret the biological meaning of the proteolytic cleavage of PARP during the course of apoptosis. We found that apoptosis requires the self-regulatory function of PARP, whose catalytic activity is regulated by its proteolytic cleavage products. The N-terminal fragment of PARP containing the DNA-binding domain preferentially binds to DNA breaks and thereby prevents the activation of PARP (32.Molinete M. Vermeulen W. Burkle A. Murcia M. Kupper J.H. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. de Murcia G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2109-2117Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 33.Schreiber V. Hunting D. Trucco C. Gowans B. Grunwald D. de Murcia G. de Murcia J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4753-4757Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that the N-terminal fragment of PARP irreversibly binds to DNA ends produced during apoptosis (22.Smulson M.E. Pang D. Jung M. Dimtchev A. Chasovskikh S. Spoonde A. Simbulan-Rosenthal C. Rosenthal D. Yakovlev A. Dritschilo A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3495-3498PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of the N-terminal fragment of PARP to DNA breaks has generally been known to contribute to apoptosis by blocking the access of repair enzymes to the DNA breaks generated during the course of apoptosis. The roles of the C-terminal fragment of PARP on apoptosis have not yet been described. The present study proposes that the intermolecular association of the cellular PARP with the C-terminal fragment containing the auto-modification domain contributes to apoptosis by blocking the homodimerization of PARP in cells irradiated with UV. The C-terminal fragments of PARP containing the auto-modification domain interacted with intact PARP, whereas the N-terminal fragment containing the DNA-binding domain interacted with DNA. The association between the N-terminal fragment and intact PARP disappeared after DNase I treatment, suggesting that the association was mediated by DNA (Fig.1). We further demonstrated that the bZip motif in the auto-modification domain is the site of self-association of the cellular PARP (Fig. 2 A). The homodimerization of PARP was blocked by the expression of PARP cleavage products containing the bZip motif in HeLa cells (Fig. 2 B). The hydrophobic amino acid Leu405 in the bZip motif was of critical importance in the structural framework required for the intermolecular association and an efficient dimerization of PARP (Fig. 3). The association of PARP with the basic components of the auto-modification domain in the C-terminal fragment seem to compete with the homodimerization of PARP. There are number of studies suggesting that oligomerization serves as an important biochemical mechanism for the regulation of protein function. Dimerization was known to provide mechanisms for the modulation of catalytic activity of enzymes (35.Climent I. Sjoberg B.M. Huang C.Y. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5164-5171Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 36.Baek K.J. Thiel B.A. Lucas S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21120-21129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and receptor functions (37.Zhu X. Wess J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15773-15784Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 38.Heldin C.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1437) Google Scholar). Several studies have also provided evidence for the inhibition of protein dimerization by the peptides derived from the same protein. For example, the catalytic activity of E. coliribonucleotide reductase was shown to be inhibited by the C-terminal peptide, which inhibits the homodimerization of the enzyme (35.Climent I. Sjoberg B.M. Huang C.Y. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5164-5171Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The truncated G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which inhibit the formation of dimeric arrays of GPCRs, were also identified as negative regulators of GPCR function (37.Zhu X. Wess J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15773-15784Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). It was known that the catalytic function of PARP is maximal when PARP tends to be self-associated to the dimer form (27.Bauer P.I. Buki K.G. Hakam A. Kun E. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 28.Mendoza-Alvarez H. Alvarez-Gonzalez R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22575-22580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Data in Fig. 4 implicate that the expression of the C-terminal fragment of PARP in UV-treated HeLa cells suppresses auto-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of PARP, probably by blocking the homodimerization of the cellular PARP. The failure of the homodimerization may interfere with the binding of PARP to DNA breaks, resulting in the catalytic inactivation of PARP. However, the expression of a mutated PARP fragment that contains the C-terminal fragment but lacks the auto-modification domain (PARPΔM) also suppressed the cellular PARP activity. The trans-dominant inhibition of PARP activity by the N-terminal fragment might be the case with PARPΔM. Indeed, the cellular PARP activity was inhibited by the expression of the N-terminal fragment of PARP. This result is likely to reflect the fact that the N-terminal fragment of PARP competes with intact PARP for binding at DNA breaks, which activate PARP (Fig.4). The pro-apoptotic role of the C-terminal fragment of PARP on apoptosis was examined in Fig. 5. Both annexin-V binding and caspase activation are well defined markers of apoptosis (39.Toyoshima F. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1005-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that the pro-apoptotic role of the C-terminal fragment of PARP does not correlate with the enhanced caspase activation in cells undergoing UV-mediated apoptosis. The level of caspase activity in cells expressing the C-terminal fragment that lacks the bZip motif was virtually same as in cells expressing PARP cleavage products containing the bZip motif. However, the intracellular caspase activity was blocked by the expression of a known inhibitor of caspase-3, CrmA (40.Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z. Beidler D.R. Poirier G.G. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 801-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2274) Google Scholar). However, the expression of the C-terminal fragment of PARP stimulated UV-mediated apoptosis as assessed by the appearance of annexin-V positive cells (Fig. 5 B). In addition, the expression of PARP fragments containing the bZip motif (C215 and M) stimulated the induction of morphological changes characteristic to apoptosis in UV-treated HeLa cells (Fig. 5 C). These results suggest that the intermolecular association of PARP at the bZip motif is required for the completion of apoptosis. The homodimerization of PARP might facilitate the progression of apoptotic cell death beyond the caspase activation step."
https://openalex.org/W2066128960,"The oscillatory [Ca2+]i signals typically seen following physiologically relevant stimulation of phospholipase C-linked receptors are associated with a receptor-activated entry of Ca2+, which plays a critical role in driving the oscillations and influencing their frequency. We have recently shown that this receptor-activated entry of Ca2+ does not conform to the widely accepted “capacitative” model and, instead, reflects the activity of a distinct, novel Ca2+ entry pathway regulated by arachidonic acid (Shuttleworth, T. J., and Thompson, J. L. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 32636–32643). We now show that the generation of arachidonic acid under these conditions results from the activity of a type IV cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2). Although cPLA2 activation commonly involves a Ca2+-dependent translocation to the membrane, at these low agonist concentrations cPLA2 activation was independent of increases in [Ca2+]i, and no detectable translocation to the membrane occurs. Nevertheless, stimulation of cPLA2 activity was confined to the membrane fraction, where an increase in phosphorylation of the enzyme was observed. We suggest that, at the low agonist concentrations associated with oscillatory [Ca2+]i signals, cPLA2 activation involves an increased phosphorylation of a discrete pool of the total cellular cPLA2 that is already localized within the membrane fraction at resting [Ca2+]i.

In many nonexcitable cells, activation with physiological levels of agonist results in a [Ca2+]i signal that takes the form of a series of repetitive [Ca2+]i oscillations (1.Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6148) Google Scholar, 2.Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In their simplest form, these oscillations consist of an InsP3-induced release of Ca2+ from intracellular agonist-sensitive stores, followed by a subsequent reuptake of released Ca2+ back into the stores via the sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum calcium pumps (3.Atri A. Amundson J. Clapham D. Sneyd J. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 1727-1739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 4.Goldbeter A. Dupont G. Berridge M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1461-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Although such models for the agonist-activated [Ca2+]ioscillations essentially rely only on the specific properties of the InsP3 receptors on the intracellular Ca2+stores, the oscillations are also associated with an enhanced entry of Ca2+ across the plasma membrane. Importantly, the rate of this activated entry of Ca2+ has been shown to have a profound influence on the frequency of the oscillations (5.Kawanishi T. Blank L.M. Harootunian A.T. Smith M.T.

J. 1996; 313: 815-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), apparently by affecting the ability of low levels of agonist-generated InsP3 to induce the release of Ca2+ from the stores (8.Shuttleworth T.J. Thompson J.L. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 815-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 9.Morgan A.J. Jacob R. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 505-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).The prevailing model of receptor-activated external Ca2+entry in nonexcitable cells is the so-called “capacitative” or store-operated model (10.Putney J.W. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2089) Google Scholar, 11.Putney J.W. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar) in which the emptying of the agonist-sensitive stores alone is both necessary and sufficient to activate Ca2+ entry. However, we have recently described a novel mechanism of agonist-activated Ca2+ entry that is independent of store depletion (i.e. noncapacitative) and that is entirely dependent on the receptor-mediated generation of arachidonic acid (12.Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21720-21725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 13.Shuttleworth T.J. Thompson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32636-32643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The evidence suggests that the Ca2+ entry pathway is activated by arachidonic acid itself, not a metabolite, and is entirely distinct from the capacitative or store-operated pathway (12.Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21720-21725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 13.Shuttleworth T.J. Thompson J.L. J. Biol.

Importantly, it is this novel entry pathway that appears to be the primary route for the receptor-induced entry of Ca2+ that plays a critical role in the generation and modulation of the oscillatory [Ca2+]i signals seen at low agonist concentrations.As yet, the mechanisms involved in the receptor activation of arachidonic acid generation under such conditions are unclear. Using HEK293 cells stably transfected with the human m3 muscarinic receptor (m3-HEK cells), we have previously shown that the generation of arachidonic acid following stimulation of the muscarinic receptor with low concentrations of agonist was independent of the simultaneous stimulation of phosphatidylinositol-specific PLC activity (13.Shuttleworth T.J. Thompson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32636-32643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Further evidence suggested that this agonist-induced arachidonic acid generation probably involved a member of the PLA2 enzyme family. However, the specific identity of the PLA2 enzyme involved and the mechanism of its activation by low concentrations of muscarinic agonists remained unknown. We now show that the carbachol-induced generation of arachidonic acid seen in the m3-HEK cells reflects the activity of a type IV cPLA2. Increases in the activity of this enzyme induced by muscarinic receptor activation can be readily detected within the agonist concentration range known to result in arachidonic acid generation, as well as the activation of the noncapacitative entry of Ca2+ that is associated with oscillatory [Ca2+]i signals in these same cells. Although activation of the type IV cPLA2in cells commonly involves a Ca2+-dependent translocation of the enzyme to the membrane (15.Channon J.Y. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5409-5413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we report that, at the low agonist concentrations used in this study, the activation of the cPLA2 was independent of any change in [Ca2+]i, and no significant translocation to the membrane fraction could be detected. This [Ca2+]i-independent activation of the type IV cPLA2 seen at low concentrations of agonist may reflect the activation of a discrete pool of the total cellular cPLA2that is already localized within the membrane fraction at resting levels of [Ca2+]i. Activation of this putative receptor-coupled pool of PLA2 results in generation of arachidonic acid and an increase in Ca2+ entry.RESULTSThe liberation of arachidonic acid from phosphatidylcholine can occur via a variety of different pathways. It was therefore important to confirm that the assay we have employed was genuinely reporting the activity of a PLA2 enzyme. The most likely alternative was a phospholipase D activity that can hydrolyze phosphatidylcholine to phosphatidic acid and choline. The phosphatidic acid can then be acted upon by phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase to yield diacylglycerol from which arachidonic acid can be released via the action of diacylglycerol and monoacylglycerol lipases. It is possible that the whole cell lysates used could contain such activities and could have resulted in the release of [3H]arachidonic acid in the assay. To examine this possibility, the cell lysates were incubated in the presence of ethanol or butanol. These agents have been shown to replace water as a donor in the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine to choline and diacylglycerol, thereby leading to a loss of arachidonic acid generation. However, treatment of the lysates with 2% ethanol or 100 mm butanol failed to significantly inhibit either resting enzyme activity or the carbachol-stimulated activity measured in the assay (Fig. 1). Neither component, therefore, involves the action of a phospholipase D.To determine whether the PLA2 activity we were recording in the enzyme assay could realistically account for the arachidonic acid generation we have previously observed in intact cells, the sensitivity of the measured PLA2 activity in the m3-HEK cells to stimulation with low concentrations of carbachol (0.5–3.0 μm) was examined. The data obtained show that significant stimulation of PLA2 activity could be readily detected at carbachol concentrations as low as 0.5 μm, and the activity was further increased at 1 and 3 μm, where an approximate 3-fold stimulation was observed (Fig.2). This is precisely the concentration range over which we see carbachol-induced increases in arachidonic acid generation and the subsequent m3-type muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-induced activation of the noncapacitative, arachidonic acid-dependent entry of Ca2+ (13.Shuttleworth T.J. Thompson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32636-32643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Moreover, although the above assays were performed after a 5-min stimulation with carbachol, additional experiments showed that significant increases in activity of the PLA2 could be readily detected within 1 min of the addition of carbachol (1.75 ± 0.12-fold stimulation (n = 3) with 1 μm carbachol). Again this is consistent with the enzyme activity determined here being responsible for the previously reported arachidonic acid generation in intact cells.Figure 2Concentration-dependent stimulation of carbachol on the measured PLA2 activity. Enzyme activity was determined in whole cell lysates from cells incubated for 5 min in the presence of the indicated concentrations of carbachol as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data (mean ± S.E., n = 5) are expressed relative to the corresponding control value for each experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Identification of the PLA2 Subtype InvolvedPLA2 activity is demonstrated by a family of distinct enzymes with markedly different molecular structures, pharmacological profiles, and enzymatic mechanisms. The reducing agent dithiothreitol has been shown to inhibit the secretory PLA2enzymes (types I, II, III, and V) by virtue of disrupting intramolecular disulfide bonds. To examine the possibility that the measured activity involves a member of the secretory PLA2family, preliminary assays performed in the presence and absence of 1 mm dithiothreitol were compared. Under control (unstimulated) conditions, measured PLA2 activity in the presence of dithiothreitol was 103% of that seen in the absence of dithiothreitol (mean of duplicate experiments). In cells stimulated with 1 μm carbachol, this activity increased to 2.8-fold in the absence of dithiothreitol and 3.15-fold in the presence of dithiothreitol (mean of duplicate experimemts). These data demonstrate that neither the basal PLA2 activity nor the carbachol-stimulated activity is inhibited by dithiothreitol and, therefore, excludes the involvement of a member of the secretory PLA2 family. As an added precaution, all subsequent assays were performed in the presence of 1 mm dithiothreitol.In contrast, the compound AACOCF3 (10 μm) markedly inhibited both the basal and carbachol-stimulated PLA2 activity determined in whole cell lysates (Fig.3). AACOCF3, an active site-directed inhibitor, was originally thought to be specific for the type IV cPLA2, but subsequent studies have shown that it is also an effective inhibitor of the type VI PLA2(iPLA2) (17.Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 272: 16069-16072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (284) Google Scholar). It is without affect on the secretory PLA2 enzymes. The data obtained therefore indicate that either a cPLA2 or iPLA2 is responsible for the activity measured. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we used the haloenol lactone suicide substrate HELSS, which has been shown to be a potent and specific inhibitor of the type VI iPLA2, with a greater than 1000-fold selectivity for iPLA2 over cPLA2 (18.Hazen S.L.

Acta. 1995; 1259: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Experiments showed that both basal and carbachol-stimulated PLA2 activity in the m3-HEK cell lysates were unaffected by HELSS (Fig. 3). Based on the combined evidence from the experiments using AACOCF3 and HELSS, it is concluded that the PLA2 activity observed, including the portion that is sensitive to stimulation by the muscarinic agonist carbachol, reflects the action of a type IV PLA2. Immunoblotting of SDS-polyacrylamide gels using a specific antibody to the human type IV cPLA2 subtype confirmed that the m3-HEK cells do indeed express a type IV cPLA2 enzyme (Fig. 6; see below).Figure 3The effect of AACOCF3 and HELSS on PLA2 activity. Enzyme activity was determined in whole cell lysates from cells incubated for 5 min in the presence or absence of 1 μm carbachol (CCh) as indicated.

Thompson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32636-32643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it is generally considered that a key step in the receptor activation of the type IV PLA2 in most cells is a Ca2+-dependent translocation of the enzyme to its substrate in the membrane involving a Ca2+-dependent phospholipid-binding domain present in the amino terminus of the type IV PLA2 protein (21.Sharp J.D. White D.L. Chiou X.G. Goodson T. Gamboa G.C. McClure D. Burgett S. Hoskins J. Skatrud P.L. Sportsman J.R. Becker G.W. Kang L.H. Roberts E.F. Kramer R.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 16709-16712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the [Ca2+]idependence of the agonist-induced stimulation of cPLA2activity in the m3-HEK cell lysates. Consistent with our earlier studies on arachidonic acid release in intact cells (13.Shuttleworth T.J. Thompson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32636-32643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), preloading the cells with the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA sufficient to completely block any agonist-induced [Ca2+]isignal failed to affect the carbachol-induced stimulation of cPLA2 activity (Fig. 4). Nevertheless, additional experiments where the cell lysates were separated into membrane and cytosol fractions revealed that the agonist-induced stimulation of activity did occur exclusively within the membrane fraction (Fig. 5). Importantly, these data cannot result from any limitations on availability of substrate in the cytosolic fraction, since excess exogenous substrate is provided in the enzyme assay. Although this observed increase in the membrane-associated enzyme activity could reflect the transfer of enzyme from the cytosol to the membrane pool, our observation that the overall stimulation of cPLA2activity was independent of any increase in [Ca2+]i suggests that the normal Ca2+-dependent translocation of cPLA2 to the membrane does not play any significant role in the muscarinic receptor activation of the enzyme, at least at the low agonist concentrations used in this study. Alternatively, the increase in membrane-associated activity could result from an agonist-induced stimulation of a component of the total cPLA2 enzyme that is already localized within the membrane fraction. To examine this possibility, membrane fractions were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the resulting gels were probed using immunoblotting with a specific antibody against the type IV cPLA2. Immunoreactive bands of the appropriate molecular size (approximately 100 kDa) (24.Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Manetta J.V. Hyslop P.A. Jakubowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26796-26804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were readily detected, but the data obtained revealed marked differences in the fractions from controlversus carbachol-stimulated cells (Fig.6). Most obvious was that the position of the cPLA2 immunoreactivity appeared to shift to a more slowly migrating electrophoretic form in the fractions from stimulated cells. Such a gel shift is known to correlate with an increased phosphorylation of cPLA2 (24.Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Manetta J.V. Hyslop P.A. Jakubowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26796-26804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and this was confirmed by treatment of the fractions with alkaline phosphatase, which resulted in the reversal of the observed gel shift in the fractions from stimulated cells (data not shown). Furthermore, the carbachol-induced gel shift was not observed in fractions from cells treated with atropine (10 μM). Based on this, we conclude that that stimulation of the m3 muscarinic receptors on the cells with 1 μm carbachol results in a significant increase in the phosphorylation state of the membrane-associated enzyme. Importantly, when the same densitometric analysis was used to measure the total immunoreactivity (i.e. sum of the density measured over an area covering the location of both bands), no significant difference was detected in the fractions from control and stimulated cells despite identical levels of protein being applied to the gel in the two lanes. Thus the total density of the immunoreactive bands in the membrane fractions from carbachol-stimulated cells was 90.3 ± 4.8% of that in control cells (mean ± S.E., n = 3). The clear implication is that no significant translocation of enzyme to the membrane-associated fraction occurred upon stimulation, despite the observed approximately 2-fold increase in enzyme activity in the membrane fractions.Figure 4The effect of carbachol on the measured PLA2 activity in BAPTA-loaded cells. Where indicated, cells were preloaded with sufficient BAPTA to completely obliterate any detectable carbachol-induced [Ca2+]i signal by incubating in the presence of BAPTA-AM (see Ref. 13.Shuttleworth T.J. Thompson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32636-32643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was determined in whole cell lysates from cells incubated for 5 min in the presence (filled bars) or absence (empty bars) of 1 μm carbachol. Values are mean ± S.E.

Similar to previous reports (see, for example, Ref. 25.Leslie C.C. Channon J.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1045: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), increasing the Ca2+ concentration in the enzyme assay over the range of nominally Ca2+-free to 5 mm resulted in marked increases in measured activity. However, whereas the activity in the cytosolic fraction increased more than 20-fold over this range of Ca2+ concentrations, that in the membrane fraction showed only a 2-fold increase (-fold increase equals 23.1 ± 7.1 in the cytosol fraction compared with 2.1 ± 0.6 in the membrane fraction, n = 3). This demonstrates that the membrane-associated pool of enzyme has a markedly different in vitro Ca2+ sensitivity compared with the cytosolic enzyme.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have examined the nature of the release of arachidonic acid seen in m3-HEK cells following stimulation with the muscarinic agonist carbachol at concentrations known to result in the activation of the noncapacitative arachidonic acid-dependent entry of Ca2+ and the generation of oscillatory [Ca2+]i signals. The generation of free arachidonic acid following receptor stimulation can result from the activity of a variety of different phospholipases including PLA2, PLC, and phospholipase D (26.Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously argued that the receptor-activated arachidonic acid generation we have observed in these cells is unlikely to involve the activity of a phospholipase D and that it appeared to be independent of the simultaneous activation of PLC (13.Shuttleworth T.J. Thompson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32636-32643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The remaining phospholipase, PLA2, has many subtypes that show a wide diversity in function, structure, and regulation (27.Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13057-13060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Dennis E.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 1-2Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 29.Kramer R.M. Sharp J.D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The type I–III and type V PLA2 enzymes are secretory, do not show specificity for the fatty acid moiety at the sn-2-position of phosphatidylcholine, and require millimolar concentrations of Ca2+ for activity. The type IV and VI PLA2enzymes are cytosolic and show a preference for the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine possessing an arachidonyl moiety at thesn-2-position, thereby leading to the release of arachidonic acid. The type IV PLA2 typically requires submicromolar concentrations of Ca2+ for translocation to its substrate in the membranes (15.Channon J.Y. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5409-5413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Clark J.D. Lin L.L. Kriz R.W. Ramesha C.S. Sultzman l.A. Lin A.Y. Milona N. Kopf J.L. Cell. 1991; 65: 1043-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar), while the type VI PLA2 has no calcium requirement for activity. Both the type IV PLA2(cPLA2), and type VI PLA2 (iPLA2) have been shown to be activated following agonist binding to receptors and to result in the release of arachidonic acid. However, the type VI PLA2 is considered to be principally involved in the restructuring of membranes by reincorporating free arachidonic acid into phospholipid (Refs. 17.Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 272: 16069-16072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (284) Google Scholar and 30.Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 13915-13927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In contrast, it is the type IV cPLA2 that is generally thought to be the principal enzyme involved in agonist-induced arachidonic acid generation. Consistent with this, agonist binding to various cell surface receptors, including muscarinic receptors, has been shown to lead to the activation of cPLA2 and the generation of arachidonic acid in several different cell types (12.Shuttleworth T.J.

In this study, we have demonstrated that the arachidonic acid generation we have previously observed in the m3-HEK cells following activation of muscarinic receptor at low concentrations of agonists results from the activity of a type IV cPLA2.

Significantly, PriA can also direct replication fork assembly on double-stranded templates carrying a D loop in a reactionin vitro that also requires PriB, PriC, DnaT, DnaB, DnaC, DnaG, and the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (Pol III HE) (20.Liu J.

Seventeen independent, naturally arising UVR Rec+ revertants ofpriA2::kan strains that carry extragenic suppressors have been isolated (13.Sandler S.J. Sawra H.S. Clark A.J. Genetics. 1996; 143: 5-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All of these extragenic suppressors map to the C-terminal half of dnaC. Two of these extragenic suppressors alleles, dnaC809 anddnaC810, arise as a result of GAA → GGA and GAA → GGT nucleotide changes, respectively, at codon 176. This generates a E176G amino acid substitution in each case.In order to understand the mechanism of suppression of ablation of PriA activity, we have cloned the dnaC810 allele and overexpressed, purified, and characterized the DnaC810 protein. This protein is capable of catalyzing a single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB)-independent general priming reaction with DnaB and DnaG. Direct examination by gel mobility shift analysis showed that, unlike wild-type DnaC, DnaC810 could transfer DnaB from a DnaB-DnaC810 complex to either SSB-coated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) or D loop DNA. This gain of function of the mutant enzyme explains its ability to bypass the requirement for PriA, PriB, PriC, and DnaT during replication fork assembly on a template carrying a D loop (20.Liu J. Xu L. Sandler S.J. Marians K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3552-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONCurrent models suggest that the replication forks formed atoriC often stall and collapse either at DNA damage such as nicks and noncoding lesions or by colliding with protein roadblocks on the DNA (12, 13 16, 34, 35). Correction of the lesion requires both repair and recombination proteins and continued viability of the cell requires replication fork restart. Restart is likely to occur in the majority of instances through recombination-directed DNA replication, where a recombination intermediate such as a D loop serves to provide both the primer for leading-strand synthesis (the 3′-OH of the invading strand) and the site at which a replisome assembles.Because strains carrying a disruption in priA were constitutively induced for the SOS response (9.Nurse P.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5338-5345Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) (which requires both recA andrecBCD (36.Kogoma T. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 212-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar)), it was proposed that PriA was involved in directing replication fork assembly at recombination intermediates (13.Sandler S.J.

This has been supported by the demonstration that PriA binds specifically to D loop DNA (17.McGlynn P. Al-Deib A.A. Liu J. Marians K.J. Lloyd R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 18.Nurse P. Liu J. Marians K.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 25033-25041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and a replication fork (20.Liu J. Xu L. Sandler S.J. Marians K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3552-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) at a D loopin vitro.In this report, we have investigated the properties of the DnaC810 protein, encoded by dnaC810, a naturally arising, extragenic suppressor of all of the phenotypes of thepriA2::kan mutation (13.Sandler S.J. Sawra H.S. Clark A.J. Genetics. 1996; 143: 5-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic analysis has indicated that dnaC810 bypasses PriA function. This suggested that DnaC810 could also direct replication fork assembly at a D loop. This proved to be the case (20.Liu J. Xu L. Sandler S.J. Marians K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3552-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Here we show that the underlying gain of function that allows DnaC810 to bypass PriA activity is an ability to load DnaB, the replication fork DNA helicase (7.Minden J.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9316-9325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Kaguni J.M. Kornberg A. Cell. 1984; 38: 183-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar,38.Mok M. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16644-16654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to SSB-coated DNA.Although DnaB can bind ssDNA to act in vitro as a ssDNA-dependent NTPase (31.Wickner S. Wright M. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 783-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), a DNA helicase (5.LeBowitz J.H. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4738-4748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a landing pad for DnaG during general priming (26.Arai K.-I. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 76: 4308-4312Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar), the protein is, in general, prevented from binding indiscriminately to ssDNA in vivo by its association with DnaC in a tight stoichiometric complex (36.Kogoma T. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 212-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). While in this complex, DnaC can transfer DnaB to exposed ssDNA but not to SSB-coated ssDNA. This transfer is mediated by a cryptic DNA-binding site in DnaC that is activated by binding of DnaB (33.Learn B.A. Um S.-J. Huang L. McMacken R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1154-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). While in the form of a DnaB-DnaC complex, DnaB cannot bind ssDNA (33.Learn B.A. Um S.-J. Huang L. McMacken R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1154-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Under normal circumstances, any exposed ssDNA will be coated with SSB. Access of DnaB to the DNA is therefore effectively limited to targeting by other mechanisms that involve additional DNA replication proteins to generate a SSB-free region of ssDNA for DnaB binding. The two mechanisms that operate in vivo to do this are DnaA-directed initiation of DNA replication at oriC (37.Kaguni J.M. Kornberg A. Cell. 1984; 38: 183-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and PriA-directed assembly of a primosome at recombination intermediates such as a D loop (20.Liu J. Xu L. Sandler S.J. Marians K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3552-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar).DnaC810 was able to load DnaB to both SSB-coated ssDNA and D loop DNA. We have previously shown by DNA footprinting studies that during assembly of the φX-type primosome, DnaB is loaded to the displaced strand in the D loop (19.Liu J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25033-25041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the ability of DnaC810 to form a replication fork at a D loop in the presence of SSB, DnaB, and the Pol III HE, where the invading strand is used as the leading strand primer (20.Liu J. Xu L. Sandler S.J. Marians K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3552-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This also places DnaB on the displaced strand that becomes the lagging strand template. Thus, we believe that DnaC810 is also loading DnaB to the displaced strand of the D loop. Because this is the only region of the D loop that can bind SSB, this would also explain the inability of the wild-type DnaC to load DnaB to the D loop in the presence of SSB.The most likely explanation for the gain of function exhibited by DnaC810 is that the affinity for ssDNA of its cryptic DNA binding activity has been increased. This would account for its ability to compete with SSB for binding to the ssDNA. In addition to having gained the ability to transfer DnaB to SSB-coated DNA, DnaC810 can also be found on the same DNA as DnaB. Although there is no direct evidence that DnaC810 and DnaB are together in a complex on the DNA, we believe that this is the case.DnaC810 alone will not bind to ssDNA, either in the presence or absence of SSB. Thus, in order for both DnaB and DnaC810 to be on the same DNA, a DnaB-DnaC810 complex would have to have interacted with the DNA and then rearranged in such a manner that both proteins were left on the DNA. This seems unlikely, because free DnaB can be found on the DNA, transferred from the DnaB-DnaC810 complex, but free DnaC810 (or DnaC, for that matter) is never found bound to the DNA. In addition, DnaC is not present on the DNA after formation of the φX-type primosome (32.Ng J.Y. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15642-15648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar,39.Ng J.Y. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15649-15655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).The nature of this DnaB-DnaC810 complex on the DNA, however, is unclear. The argument advanced above would suggest that it is bound in a stable fashion as a result of the DnaC DNA-binding site and not that of DnaB. Presumably, transfer of DnaB to the DNA ejects DnaC from the complex. This could be seen to be consistent with the requirement for higher concentrations of DnaC810 to form this complex compared with the concentration required to transfer DnaB directly to the DNA.Based on our biochemical analyses described here, can we account for the properties of the dnaC810 mutation in vivo? The answer is mixed. The ability to bypass PriA function and rescue all of the phenotypes of the priA2::kan mutation can clearly be attributed to the gain of function that allows DnaC810 to load DnaB to SSB-coated D loop DNA. This allows the crucial replication fork restart downstream of recombination intermediates required for continued cell viability. Biochemically, neither PriA, PriB, PriC, nor DnaT are required for this bypass step. Thus, it is interesting that genetically, priA2::kan, dnaC810strains appear to be partially priB- andpriC-dependent.In contrast to what was predicted based on the pathway of assembly of the φX-type primosome (32.Ng J.Y. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15642-15648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), neither priB norpriC disruptions exhibit any of the phenotypes associated with the priA2::kan mutation (40.Sandler S.J. Marians K.J. Zavitz K.H. Coutu J. Parent M.A. Clark A.J. Mol. Micobiol. 1999; 34: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Remarkably, however, the priB, priC double mutant did display the multiple phenotypes associated with thepriA2::kan mutation and was even less viable and grew more slowly (40.Sandler S.J. Marians K.J. Zavitz K.H. Coutu J. Parent M.A. Clark A.J. Mol. Micobiol. 1999; 34: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).This suggests that PriB and PriC have redundant functions in a pathway that involves PriA. Although the biochemical properties of DnaC810 would lead one to expect that the dnaC810 mutation should be able to completely suppress the phenotypes of the priB,priC double mutant, this is not the case. ThepriB, priC, dnaC810 triple mutant strain is still as recombination-deficient and induced for the SOS response as priA2::kan. A second suppressor mutation that also arises in dnaC, dnaC820, is required for complete reversion of the phenotypes. This implies, contrary to the biochemical properties demonstrated here, that DnaC810 would be partially PriB- and PriC-dependent.We suspect that these apparent inconsistencies between the biochemical and genetic data relate to the fact that we have yet to incorporate recombination proteins into our biochemical systems. Replication fork assembly at a recombination intermediate such as a D loop in vivo presumably has to compete with the binding and action of a variety of recombination proteins. This could easily change the apparent biochemical requirements for replication fork restart. PriA, a 3′ → 5′ DNA helicase (1.Lee M.S. Marians K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8345-8349Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 2.Lasken R.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5512-5518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was discovered because of its requirement, along with PriB, PriC, DnaT, DnaB, DnaC, and DnaG, for assembly of a primosome on φX174 (φX)1 viral DNA during complementary strand DNA replication in vitro (3.Wickner S. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4120-4124Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 4.Schekman R. Weiner J. Weiner A. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 5859-5865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the φX-type primosome could provide both the DNA unwinding (via the 5′ → 3′ DNA helicase activity of DnaB (5.LeBowitz J.H. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4738-4748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) and Okazaki fragment priming (via the primase activity of DnaG (6.Bouche J.-P. Zechel K. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 5995-6001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) functions at a replication fork (7.Minden J.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9316-9325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Wu C.A. Zechner E.L. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4030-4044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these biochemical analyses never revealed a role for either PriA, PriB, PriC, or DnaT during chromosomal DNA replication. The advent of strains in which priA had been disrupted soon changed this (9.Nurse P. Zavitz K.H. Marians K.J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6686-6693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Lee E.H. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3029-3032Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Based on our initial observation that thepriA2::kan strain was constitutively induced for the SOS response (9.Nurse P. Zavitz K.H. Marians K.J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6686-6693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that SOS induction could be suppressed completely by providing a mutant priA allele intrans that encoded a protein that could not act as a DNA helicase but did direct primosome assembly (11.Zavitz K.H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6933-6940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we proposed that PriA-directed replication fork assembly was required to rescue replication forks that had formed at oriC and then stalled because of encountering endogenous DNA damage (9.Nurse P. Zavitz K.H. Marians K.J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6686-6693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Zavitz K.H. Marians K.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2869-2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The actual substrate for replication fork assembly became clear as detailed genetic analyses were performed with the priA null strains. These subsequent genetic studies showed that in addition to induction of the SOS response, strains null for PriA activity had very complex phenotypes. They were poorly viable (9.Nurse P. Zavitz K.H.

A. 1999; 96: 3552-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) at a D loopin vitro.In this report, we have investigated the properties of the DnaC810 protein, encoded by dnaC810, a naturally arising, extragenic suppressor of all of the phenotypes of thepriA2::kan mutation (13.Sandler S.J. Sawra H.S. Clark A.J. Genetics. 1996; 143: 5-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic analysis has indicated that dnaC810 bypasses PriA function. This suggested that DnaC810 could also direct replication fork assembly at a D loop. This proved to be the case (20.Liu J. Xu L. Sandler S.J. Marians K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3552-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Here we show that the underlying gain of function that allows DnaC810 to bypass PriA activity is an ability to load DnaB, the replication fork DNA helicase (7.Minden J.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9316-9325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Kaguni J.M. Kornberg A. Cell. 1984; 38: 183-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar,38.Mok M. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16644-16654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to SSB-coated DNA.Although DnaB can bind ssDNA to act in vitro as a ssDNA-dependent NTPase (31.Wickner S. Wright M. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 783-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), a DNA helicase (5.LeBowitz J.H. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4738-4748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a landing pad for DnaG during general priming (26.Arai K.-I. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 76: 4308-4312Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar), the protein is, in general, prevented from binding indiscriminately to ssDNA in vivo by its association with DnaC in a tight stoichiometric complex (36.Kogoma T. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 212-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). While in this complex, DnaC can transfer DnaB to exposed ssDNA but not to SSB-coated ssDNA. This transfer is mediated by a cryptic DNA-binding site in DnaC that is activated by binding of DnaB (33.Learn B.A. Um S.-J. Huang L. McMacken R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1154-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). While in the form of a DnaB-DnaC complex, DnaB cannot bind ssDNA (33.Learn B.A. Um S.-J. Huang L. McMacken R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1154-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Under normal circumstances, any exposed ssDNA will be coated with SSB. Access of DnaB to the DNA is therefore effectively limited to targeting by other mechanisms that involve additional DNA replication proteins to generate a SSB-free region of ssDNA for DnaB binding. The two mechanisms that operate in vivo to do this are DnaA-directed initiation of DNA replication at oriC (37.Kaguni J.M. Kornberg A. Cell. 1984; 38: 183-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and PriA-directed assembly of a primosome at recombination intermediates such as a D loop (20.Liu J. Xu L. Sandler S.J. Marians K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3552-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar).DnaC810 was able to load DnaB to both SSB-coated ssDNA and D loop DNA. We have previously shown by DNA footprinting studies that during assembly of the φX-type primosome, DnaB is loaded to the displaced strand in the D loop (19.Liu J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25033-25041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the ability of DnaC810 to form a replication fork at a D loop in the presence of SSB, DnaB, and the Pol III HE, where the invading strand is used as the leading strand primer (20.Liu J. Xu L. Sandler S.J. Marians K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3552-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This also places DnaB on the displaced strand that becomes the lagging strand template. Thus, we believe that DnaC810 is also loading DnaB to the displaced strand of the D loop. Because this is the only region of the D loop that can bind SSB, this would also explain the inability of the wild-type DnaC to load DnaB to the D loop in the presence of SSB.The most likely explanation for the gain of function exhibited by DnaC810 is that the affinity for ssDNA of its cryptic DNA binding activity has been increased. This would account for its ability to compete with SSB for binding to the ssDNA. In addition to having gained the ability to transfer DnaB to SSB-coated DNA, DnaC810 can also be found on the same DNA as DnaB. Although there is no direct evidence that DnaC810 and DnaB are together in a complex on the DNA, we believe that this is the case.DnaC810 alone will not bind to ssDNA, either in the presence or absence of SSB. Thus, in order for both DnaB and DnaC810 to be on the same DNA, a DnaB-DnaC810 complex would have to have interacted with the DNA and then rearranged in such a manner that both proteins were left on the DNA. This seems unlikely, because free DnaB can be found on the DNA, transferred from the DnaB-DnaC810 complex, but free DnaC810 (or DnaC, for that matter) is never found bound to the DNA. In addition, DnaC is not present on the DNA after formation of the φX-type primosome (32.Ng J.Y. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15642-15648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar,39.Ng J.Y. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15649-15655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).The nature of this DnaB-DnaC810 complex on the DNA, however, is unclear. The argument advanced above would suggest that it is bound in a stable fashion as a result of the DnaC DNA-binding site and not that of DnaB. Presumably, transfer of DnaB to the DNA ejects DnaC from the complex. This could be seen to be consistent with the requirement for higher concentrations of DnaC810 to form this complex compared with the concentration required to transfer DnaB directly to the DNA.Based on our biochemical analyses described here, can we account for the properties of the dnaC810 mutation in vivo? The answer is mixed. The ability to bypass PriA function and rescue all of the phenotypes of the priA2::kan mutation can clearly be attributed to the gain of function that allows DnaC810 to load DnaB to SSB-coated D loop DNA. This allows the crucial replication fork restart downstream of recombination intermediates required for continued cell viability. Biochemically, neither PriA, PriB, PriC, nor DnaT are required for this bypass step. Thus, it is interesting that genetically, priA2::kan, dnaC810strains appear to be partially priB- andpriC-dependent.In contrast to what was predicted based on the pathway of assembly of the φX-type primosome (32.Ng J.Y. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15642-15648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), neither priB norpriC disruptions exhibit any of the phenotypes associated with the priA2::kan mutation (40.Sandler S.J. Marians K.J. Zavitz K.H. Coutu J. Parent M.A. Clark A.J. Mol. Micobiol. 1999; 34: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Remarkably, however, the priB, priC double mutant did display the multiple phenotypes associated with thepriA2::kan mutation and was even less viable and grew more slowly (40.Sandler S.J. Marians K.J. Zavitz K.H. Coutu J. Parent M.A. Clark A.J. Mol. Micobiol. 1999; 34: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).This suggests that PriB and PriC have redundant functions in a pathway that involves PriA. Although the biochemical properties of DnaC810 would lead one to expect that the dnaC810 mutation should be able to completely suppress the phenotypes of the priB,priC double mutant, this is not the case. ThepriB, priC, dnaC810 triple mutant strain is still as recombination-deficient and induced for the SOS response as priA2::kan. A second suppressor mutation that also arises in dnaC, dnaC820, is required for complete reversion of the phenotypes. This implies, contrary to the biochemical properties demonstrated here, that DnaC810 would be partially PriB- and PriC-dependent.We suspect that these apparent inconsistencies between the biochemical and genetic data relate to the fact that we have yet to incorporate recombination proteins into our biochemical systems. Replication fork assembly at a recombination intermediate such as a D loop in vivo presumably has to compete with the binding and action of a variety of recombination proteins. This could easily change the apparent biochemical requirements for replication fork restart. Current models suggest that the replication forks formed atoriC often stall and collapse either at DNA damage such as nicks and noncoding lesions or by colliding with protein roadblocks on the DNA (12, 13 16, 34, 35). Correction of the lesion requires both repair and recombination proteins and continued viability of the cell requires replication fork restart. Restart is likely to occur in the majority of instances through recombination-directed DNA replication, where a recombination intermediate such as a D loop serves to provide both the primer for leading-strand synthesis (the 3′-OH of the invading strand) and the site at which a replisome assembles. Because strains carrying a disruption in priA were constitutively induced for the SOS response (9.Nurse P. Zavitz K.H. Marians K.J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6686-6693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and shown to be defective in homologous recombination (13.Sandler S.J. Sawra H.S. Clark A.J.

In turn, latent cytoplasmic transcription factors, known as signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) are recruited to the receptor complex and become tyrosine-phosphorylated (6.Berry S.A.

The serine protease inhibitor (Spi) 2.1 gene has served as a useful model for investigating the mechanism of GH action in rat liver.

We purified a GH-inducible nuclear factor complex, GHINF, from rat liver, in which the major DNA binding component was Stat5 (15.Bergad P.L. Shih H.M. Towle H.C. Schwarzenberg S.J. Berry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24903-24910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We also found that the GHINF complex contained additional unknown proteins. We now report the identities of the additional components and evidence for their role in the GH induction process. All animals were handled in accordance with experimental protocols approved by the University of Minnesota Institutional Committee on the Care and Use of Animals. Male rats (Harlan Sprague Dawley) were hypophysectomized at 100–125 grams by the supplier (Harlan Sprague Dawley, Indianapolis, IN) and observed for 3 weeks to confirm growth failure. Administration of GH (Lilly) to these rats at a dosage of 150 μg/100 g, body weight, led to the accumulation of activated Stat5 in liver nuclei (6.Berry S.A. Bergad P.L. Whaley C.D. Towle H.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1714-1719PubMed Google Scholar). Liver nuclei from normal male rats contain variable amounts of activated Stat5, a consequence of the pulsatile nature of the GH level in the male rat (12.Waxman D.J. Ram P.A. Park S.H. Choi H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13262-13270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 22.Jansson J.O. Eden S. Isaksson O. Endocr. Rev. 1985; 6: 128-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). We found that treating a normal rat with GH 1 h before sacrifice consistently led to accumulation of activated Stat5 in liver nuclei. Its phosphorylation status, as determined by supershift assays with antibodies to phosphoserine or phosphotyrosine with the GHRE, is identical to that observed when a hypophysectomized rat is treated with GH. We therefore used both GH-treated normal and hypophysectomized rats for these studies. Preparation of crude rat hepatic nuclear extracts, affinity purification of GHINF, and EMSA have all been reported previously (15.Bergad P.L. Shih H.M. Towle H.C. Schwarzenberg S.J. Berry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24903-24910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Briefly, in an EMSA reaction, 5 μg of hepatic nuclear extracts or ∼2 ng of GHINF were incubated with 20 fmol of the radiolabeled probe of interest in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 10% glycerol, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 4% Ficoll 400, 1 mmspermidine, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg of poly(dI·dC). The final KCl concentration was adjusted to 50 mm. After 30 min of incubation at 30 °C, the binding mixture was loaded on to a nondenaturing, 3.2% glycerol, 5% polyacrylamide gel in a Bio-Rad Protean II system in 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.3) and electrophoresed at 150 V for 2.5 h. The gel was dried and exposed to film. Quantitation of the shifted complexes on the film was determined using the Kodak Digital Science ID Image Analysis Software. In supershift assays, GHINF or hepatic nuclear extracts were incubated with the antibody under investigation for 30 min at 4 °C prior to the addition of the radiolabeled probe. The sequences of the consensus YY1 probe, wild type GHRE, and mutant GHREs are shown in Table I. To prepare double-stranded oligonucleotides, primer P1, P2, or P3 was annealed to the appropriate oligonucleotide as stated in Table I. The annealed duplexes were then extended with the Klenow fragment ofEscherichia coli DNA polymerase I and radiolabeled dCTP. The products were subsequently purified through Bio-Spin 6 columns (Bio-Rad).Table ISequences of YY1, GHRE wild type, and mutation oligonucleotidesNameSequenceDescriptionYY1GATCCACCCAAATATGGCGACGAGATCConsensus sequenceGHRE (Spi-A-CAT)TCGACGCTTCTACTA ATCCATGTT CT GAGAAATCATCCAGTCTGCCCACWild typeK (Spi-K-CAT)CATTCTAGAATTTCTCAG AACATGGAtccgagcTTAGTAGAAGCGTA CTGATCTCCTGAGCAC (bottom strand)7 additional bp between two GAS sitesL (Spi-L-CAT)CATTCTAGAATTTCTCAG AACATttAtccgagcTTAGTAGAAGCGTA CTGATCTCCTGAGCAC (bottom strand)K and CC to aa within YY1 binding siteM2TCGACGGTTCTACTAATCTTCTGAGAAATCATCCAGTCTGCCCAC2 bp between two GAS in GHREM4TCGAGCGTTCTACTAATgCGTTCTGAGAAATCATCCAGTCTGCCCAC4 bp between two GAS in GHREP (Spi-P-CAT)TCGACGCTTCTACT AAcatggaT TCTGAGAAATTCTAGAGTCTGCCCACYY1 site on bottom strandQ (Spi-Q-CAT)TCGACGCTTCTACTc ATCCATGTT CTGAGAAATCATCCAGTCTGCCCACTAA to TcA in 5′ GASR (Spi-R-CAT)TCGACGCTTCTACTA ATaaATGTT CTGAGAAATCATCCAGTCTGCCCACMutation of YY1 siteSTCGACGCTTCTACTAAgagtaTCCATGTT CTGAGAAATCATCCAGTCT GCCCAC5 additional bp between two GASPrimer P1GTGGGCAGACFor GHRE, M2, M4, P, O, R, SPrimer P2GTGCTCAGGAGATCAGTACGCFor K and LPrimer P3GATCTCGTCGFor YY1The names of the corresponding plasmid constructs of the oligonucleotides are given in parentheses.

Antibody to YY1 (C-20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA; catalogue no. sc-281 or sc-281X) is a polyclonal antibody generated against amino acids 395–414 mapping at the carboxyl terminus of human YY1. Antibody to GR (P-20) (catalogue no. sc-1002) is a polyclonal antibody generated against amino acids 750–769 mapping at the carboxyl terminus of human GR. Antibody to Stat5a (L-20) (catalogue no. sc-1081X) is a polyclonal antibody generated against amino acids 774–793 mapping at the carboxyl terminus of mouse Stat5a. This antibody is specific for Stat5a and is nonreactive with Stat5b. Stat5b antibody (C-17) (catalog no. sc-835 or sc-835X) is a polyclonal antibody generated against amino acids 711–727 at the carboxyl terminus of mouse Stat5b. This antibody reacts with both Stat5a and Stat5b. Antibody to phosphoserine (catalogue no. P3430) and antibody to phosphothreonine (catalogue no. P3555) were from Sigma. These two antibodies do not cross-react with each other. Antibody to serine-phosphorylated Stat5a/b (catalogue no. 06-867, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) was raised against a synthetic peptide (DQAPpSPAVC, where pS represents phosphoserine) corresponding to amino acids 722–730 of human Stat5a or 727–735 of human Stat5b. This antibody cross-reacts with both mouse and rat Stat5a/b. Immunoprecipitations were performed with liver nuclear extracts from either hypophysectomized rats or normal rats treated with GH. Aliquots containing 100 μg were incubated with 2 μg of the antibody of interest in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.1% sodium deoxycholate) containing, in addition, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 mm NaF. The mixtures were mixed for 1 h on end over end rotation at 4 °C (19.Silva C.M. Lu H.W. Day R.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 508-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Protein A-agarose (120 μg) was then added to each mixture, and end to end mixing was continued for 16 h at 4 °C. The mixtures were centrifuged at 700 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellets were washed four times with radioimmune precipitation buffer, each time collecting agarose by centrifuging for 5 min at 4 °C. SDS electrophoresis sample buffer (40 μl) was added to each final agarose pellet, and the mixture was boiled for 90 s and centrifuged. Five μl of the resultant supernatant were then loaded onto a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Immunoblotting was performed as reported previously (15.Bergad P.L. Shih H.M. Towle H.C. Schwarzenberg S.J. Berry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24903-24910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The construction of Spi 2.1 (−275/+85) into theHindIII/PstI sites of the parent CAT reporter plasmid pCAT(An), designated here as Spi-A-CAT, and that of mutations in place of the wild type GHRE sequence in Spi-A-CAT were described previously (15.Bergad P.L.

Based on our observation that the insertion of theXba site at −116/−111 does not disrupt the GH response, we constructed long PCR primers extending from this site to 15 base pairs (bp) 5′ of the putative YY1 recognition site. Within these primers, we inserted short mutated sequences into or upstream of the putative YY1 recognition site. Primers incorporating mutations R, P, K, L, and Q, listed in Table I, were used to generate PCR products extending from −116 to −275. These were subsequently ligated, together with PCR products extending from −116 to +85, into pCAT(An). All mutations were confirmed by TaqFs dye terminator cycle sequencing (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) performed by the Microchemical Facilities at the University of Minnesota. Functional assays in primary rat hepatocytes were carried out as described previously (15.Bergad P.L. Shih H.M. Towle H.C. Schwarzenberg S.J. Berry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24903-24910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Briefly, primary hepatocytes were isolated from male Harlan Sprague Dawley rats (180–240 g) using the collagenase perfusion method and plated on 35-mm culture dishes at a concentration of 1.2 × 106 cells/plate. After a 4-h attachment period, transfection was performed using Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) in modified Williams E medium with 27.5 mm glucose for 12–14 h. 500 μg/ml of Matrigel (Life Technologies) was then added to the medium, and the hepatocytes were cultured for 48 h in the presence or absence of 0.5 μg/ml GH. At the end of 48 h, the cells were harvested and lysed in 1× Reporter lysis buffer (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assays. Results of the assays were expressed as percentage conversion of chloramphenicol to its acetylated forms as determined by phosphor screen autoradiography (Molecular Dynamics Corp., Sunnyvale, CA). Each experiment was repeated three times with freshly isolated hepatocytes. At least two different plasmid preparations of each construct were tested in these experiments. The GHINF complex was purified from liver nuclear extracts of GH-treated rats using affinity chromatography on a GHRE sequence (−147/−103) from the Spi 2.1 promoter. The GHINF complex contained two bands with apparent molecular masses of ∼93 and ∼70 kDa. The ∼93-kDa band was previously shown to contain Stat5 that was tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to GH treatment. To determine what forms of Stat5 were present in this band and to further examine their phosphorylation states, we used antibodies to Stat5a, Stat5b, phosphoserine, and phosphothreonine in GHRE binding assays. Fig.1 a demonstrates that the GHINF·GHRE complex can be partially supershifted with an antibody specific to Stat5a. An antibody recognizing both Stat5a and Stat5b (Stat5b antibody) supershifted the GHINF·GHRE complex. In addition to containing phosphorylated tyrosine residues, both Stat5a and Stat5b isoforms are serine-phosphorylated, since a phosphoserine antibody supershifted the GHINF·GHRE complex (Fig. 1 b). Similarly, an antibody specific for serine-phosphorylated Stat5a/b supershifted the entire GHINF·GHRE complex (data not shown). In contrast, these isoforms of Stat5 are not threonine-phosphorylated, since a phosphothreonine antibody did not alter the GHINF·GHRE complex (Fig.1 c). Examination of the GHRE sequence reveals a potential YY1 binding site, ATCCATGTT, located between the two GAS and overlapping them both (Table I). A comparison of this sequence with the consensus sequence for YY1 binding, (C/g/a)(G/t)(C/t/a)CATN(T/a)(T/g/c), with the uppercase letters denoting preferred bases (23.Hyde-DeRuyscher R., P. Jennings E. Shenk T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4457-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), indicates that this is a lower affinity YY1 binding site. Previously, we showed that UV-cross-linking of GHINF led to the appearance of two bands, migrating to ∼93 and ∼70 kDa respectively, on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (15.Bergad P.L. Shih H.M. Towle H.C. Schwarzenberg S.J. Berry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24903-24910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We had shown that the 93-kDa band contained Stat5. We now show that the ∼70-kDa species is YY1. YY1, with a molecular mass of 48 kDa and a highly charged N terminus, migrates in an anomalous fashion to ∼70-kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (24.Becker K.G. Jedlicka P. Templeton N.S. Liotta L. Ozato K. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 150: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Utilizing an antibody to YY1, we tested for the presence of YY1 in GHINF by means of EMSA and immunoblotting. Fig.2 a shows that YY1 antibody diminishes the formation of the GHINF·GHRE complex in EMSA. The extent of this inhibition is similar to that observed with a consensus YY1 binding site, indicating that YY1 is present in GHINF. This is further confirmed on an immunoblot of purified GHINF (Fig.2 b), which contains a band migrating at ∼70 kDa that is immunoreactive with YY1 antibody. To examine whether the presence of YY1 in GHINF was merely a contaminant of the purification process and to assess whether YY1 might associate with Stat5 in a state-specific manner, antibodies to YY1 were used for immunoprecipitation of hepatic nuclear extracts from hypophysectomized rats and normal rats treated with GH. Fig.3 a shows an immunoblot of these immunoprecipitates probed with Stat5b antibody. The YY1 immunoprecipitate from a normal rat treated with GH contains Stat5 (lane 2), since this band co-migrates with Stat5 in hepatic extracts and GHINF (lanes 3 and4). Hepatic nuclear extracts from hypophysectomized rats contain little Stat5, and YY1 antibody immunoprecipitates from these extracts contained little Stat5 (lane 1). A faster moving and rather diffuse band in lanes 1and 2 is an artifact of YY1 immunoprecipitations, since the same band was also seen on an identical blot probed with YY1 antibody (Fig. 3 b, lanes 1 and 2). This blot also showed that YY1 immunoprecipitates from both hypophysectomized and normal rats treated with GH contain YY1 (Fig.3 b, lanes 1 and 2). These results indicate that YY1 is associated with Stat5 during the response to GH. GHINF binds synergistically to the two GAS in GHRE (15.Bergad P.L. Shih H.M. Towle H.C. Schwarzenberg S.J. Berry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24903-24910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). One hypothesis, given the above data, is that YY1 may play a role in promoting this synergistic binding. To test this hypothesis, we studied the effects of altering the sequence or spacing between these two GAS on GHINF binding. EMSA was carried out with hepatic nuclear extracts from a hypophysectomized rat treated with GH (Fig. 4). There was no formation of the GHINF·GHRE complex when the spacing between the two GAS was changed from the native spacing of 6 bp to 2 bp (M2) or 4 bp (M4) (lanes 1 and 2). Within the wild type spacing of 6 bp, mutating only 2 bp critical to YY1 binding (CC → AA) led to a significant decrease in GHINF binding (R, lane 4), when compared with the wild type GHRE (lane 3). Placement of the putative YY1 binding site on the opposite strand (P) led to little change in GHINF binding (lane 5) when the differences in specific activities of the probes were taken into consideration (Table II). However, increasing the spacing between the two GAS to 11 or 13 bp, thus changing the phase of the GAS (S, K, and L), led to noticeable decreases in the intensities of GHINF binding. Mutation of the TAA of the 5′ GAS to TCA (Q) led to a further decrease in GHINF binding (lane 9). The decreases in GHINF binding to these probes were particularly noteworthy, since the specific activities of these probes were at least 2-fold higher than that of GHRE (Table II). Therefore, either mutating the putative YY1 binding site or changing the phase of the GAS led to significant decreases in GHINF binding.Table IIComparisons of specific activities of the probes and intensities of their binding complexes as shown in Fig. 4ProbeSpecific activity (S.A.)S.A. of MutationIntensity of Mutation ComplexS.A. of GHREIntensity of GHRE Complexcpm/20 fmolGHRE1.4 × 1051.01.00R2.1 × 1051.50.61P3.4 × 1052.42.10aThe ratio for mutation P complex intensity to that of wild type GHRE was calculated from a lighter exposure.

EMSAs carried out with these probes (between three and ten times for each probe) gave very similar results. Open table in a new tab Two different exposures of the gel in Fig. 4 were subjected to analyses by the Kodak Digital Science ID Image Analysis Software. Spi 2.1 promoter fragments (−275/+85), incorporating the sequences of mutations K, P, R, L, and Q in place of wild type sequences, were cloned into a CAT reporter plasmid and tested for their responses to GH over a range from 5 to 500 ng/ml in primary hepatocytes (Fig. 5). The activity of Spi-P-CAT, with the YY1 recognition site on the opposite strand compared with wild type, was somewhat lower than that observed for wild type Spi-A-CAT in the entire range of GH concentrations tested. Their response curves, however, were very similar. Mutation of only 2 bp within the putative YY1 site, Spi-R-CAT, led to a dramatic decrease of the GH response. For the entire range of GH concentrations in which Spi-A-CAT had a positive response (12.5–500 ng/ml), the response of Spi-R-CAT was only 10–17% of that of Spi-A-CAT. Increasing the spacing between the GAS but retaining the YY1 binding site, Spi-K-CAT, led to a diminished GH response and a shift of the response curve considerably to the right, since there was no response at GH concentrations of 12.5 or 25 ng/ml. For GH concentrations of 50–500 ng/ml, the response of Spi-K-CAT was only 15–25% of that of Spi-A-CAT. A combination of these two alterations, mutation of 2 bp within the putative YY1 binding site and an increase of the spacing between the two GAS, Spi-L-CAT, led to an almost total abrogation of the GH response over the entire range of concentrations tested. Spi-Q-CAT, with an intact YY1 site but only a 4 out of 6 match in its 5′ GAS sequence to that of the 3′ GAS, was likewise unresponsive to GH. Thus, the synergistic binding of two dimers of Stat5, the length of spacing between these two Stat5 binding sites, and the sequence of that spacing are all critical factors in the ability of GHRE to respond to GH. Stat5 can associate with GR when both are overexpressed in COS7 cells (25.Stoecklin E. Wissler M. Moriggl R. Groner B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6708-6716Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In addition, a role for GR in the Stat5-mediated PRL induction of the β-casein gene has been reported (26.Stocklin E. Wissler M. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Nature. 1996; 383: 726-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). To determine if GHINF purified from livers of rats after GH treatment also contains GR, we used an antibody to GR to probe an immunoblot of purified GHINF (Fig.6 a). A ∼93-kDa band that is immunoreactive with GR antibody was detected in purified GHINF. Of note, GR and Stat5 have similar molecular masses and migrate to similar positions on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (26.Stocklin E. Wissler M. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Nature. 1996; 383: 726-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). To assess whether GR associates with Stat5 during a GH response, we carried out GR antibody co-immunoprecipitations of hepatic nuclear extracts from hypophysectomized rats and normal rats treated with GH. Fig.6 b shows an immunoblot of these immunoprecipitates probed with an antibody to Stat5b. In the immunoprecipitate from the hepatic nuclear extract from a normal rat treated with GH, there is a band migrating to ∼93 kDa that is immunoreactive with Stat5b antibody (lane 2).

https://openalex.org/W1974022352,"A mutation was constructed in the CAP homology domain of yeast topoisomerase II that resulted in hypersensitivity to the intercalating agentN-[4-(9-acridinylamino)-3-methoxy-phenyl]methanesulfonamide and the fluoroquinolone 6,8-difluoro-7-(4′-hydroxyphenyl)-1-cyclopropyl-4-quinolone-3-carboxylic acid, but not to etoposide. This mutation, which changes threonine at position 744 to proline, also confers hypersensitivity to anti-bacterial fluoroquinolones. The purified T744P mutant protein had wild type enzymatic activity in the absence of drugs, and no alteration in drug-independent DNA cleavage. Enhanced DNA cleavage in the presence ofN-[4-(9-acridinylamino)-3-methoxy-phenyl]methanesulfonamide and fluoroquinolones was observed, in agreement with the results observed in vivo. DNA cleavage was also seen in the presence of norfloxacin and oxolinic acid, two quinolones that are inactive against eukaryotic topoisomerase II. The hypersensitivity was not associated with heat-stable covalent complexes, as was seen in another drug-hypersensitive mutant. Molecular modeling suggests that the mutation in the CAP homology domain may displace amino acids that play important roles in catalysis by topoisomerase II and may explain the drug-hypersensitive phenotype.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar). Two major classes of topoisomerases have been identified, type I enzymes, which introduce single strand breaks in DNA, and type II enzymes, which introduce transient double strand breaks. The ability of these enzymes to resolve the winding problems that arise during nucleic acid metabolism render them essential for many of DNA metabolic processes including transcription, DNA replication, and chromosome segregation. Both type I and type II enzymes are ubiquitous among both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and recent work has led to the discovery of several novel topoisomerases with novel biochemical properties and important specialized physiological roles (reviewed in Ref.2.Nitiss J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 63-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In addition to their numerous biological functions, topoisomerases are important targets for both anti-bacterial agents and anti-cancer chemotherapeutic agents (reviewed in Refs. 3.Nitiss J.L. Beck W.T. Eur. J. Cancer. 1996; 32: 958-966Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 4.Froelich-Ammon S.J. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21429-21432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 5.Pommier Y. Semin. Oncol. 1996; 23: 3-10PubMed Google Scholar). Most of the topoisomerase targeting drugs in clinical use are topoisomerase poisons, agents that lead to enhanced levels of an intermediate of the topoisomerase reaction where the enzyme is covalently bound to DNA by a phosphotyrosine linkage and the DNA strand scission has occurred (4.Froelich-Ammon S.J. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21429-21432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Extensive evidence supports the hypothesis that topoisomerase poisons kill cells because of the DNA damage generated by the covalent complex rather than by depriving cells of an essential enzymatic activity (3.Nitiss J.L. Beck W.T. Eur. J. Cancer. 1996; 32: 958-966Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (182) Google Scholar,6.Nitiss J.L. Rose A. Sykes K.C. Harris J. Zhou J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 803: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Therefore, resistance to topoisomerase poisons can occur by a change in the level of protein-DNA covalent complexes that arise in the presence of drug, either by reduced activity of the enzyme or by an intrinsic change in sensitivity of the enzyme to the poison. Eukaryotic topoisomerase I is the target of camptothecins, whereas eukaryotic topoisomerase II is the target of numerous agents including DNA intercalating agents such as the anthracycline doxorubicin and nonintercalating agents such as the epipodophyllotoxin etoposide. Prokaryotic topoisomerase II is the target of fluoroquinolones, which are important broad spectrum anti-bacterial agents (7.Hooper D.C. Wolfson J.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 324: 384-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 8.Hendershot E.F. Infect. Dis. Clin. North Am. 1995; 9: 715-730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although most fluoroquinolones that have been described are highly specific for prokaryotic type II topoisomerases, several agents have been described that are also very active against eukaryotic topoisomerase II (9.Gootz T.D. Barrett J.F. Sutcliffe J.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1990; 34: 8-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 10.Robinson M.J. Martin B.A. Gootz T.D. McGuirk P.R. Osheroff N. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1992; 36: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Notably, 6,8-difluoro-7-(4′-hydroxyphenyl)-1-cyclopropyl-4-quinolone-3-carboxylic acid (CP-115,953),1 a fluoroquinolone closely related to ciprofloxacin, is a potent eukaryotic topoisomerase II poison (10.Robinson M.J.

Moynihan M. Sutcliffe J.A. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14585-14592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies in yeast demonstrated that TOP2 is the primary physiological target for this quinolone (12.Elsea S.H. Osheroff N. Nitiss J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13150-13153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, mutations that lead to quinolone resistance are most often found in gyrA, the structural gene for the DNA gyrase A subunit. Ser83 of gyrA is the amino acid most frequently changed in strains with high levels of quinolone resistance. E. coli also expresses an additional fluoroquinolone sensitive type II topoisomerase, encoded by theparC and parE genes (13.Kato J. Nishimura Y. Imamura R. Niki H. Hiraga S. Suzuki H. Cell. 1990; 63: 393-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 14.Hoshino K. Kitamura A. Morrissey I. Sato K. Kato J. Ikeda H. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 2623-2627Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The parClocus is homologous to gyrA, and mutations inparC at sites analogous to quinolone-resistant gyrase mutations are also associated with fluoroquinolone resistance inE. coli and other bacteria (15.Kumagai Y. Kato J.I. Hoshino K. Akasaka T. Sato K. Ikeda H. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1996; 40: 710-714Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Pan X.S. Fisher L.M. J.

Proteins bearing Ser83 mutations have essentially normal gyrase activity but have decreased affinity for fluoroquinolones (19.Yonezawa M. Takahata M. Banzawa N. Matsubara N. Watanabe Y. Narita H. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 39: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 20.Critchlow S.E. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7387-7393Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In addition to the sites in gyrA or parC, mutations have also been found in gyrB that lead to quinolone resistance, which has led to the suggestion that domains in gyrA andgyrB collaborate to form a quinolone-binding pocket (21.Gensberg K. Jin Y.F. Piddock L.J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 132: 57-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Yoshida H. Bogaki M. Nakamura M. Yamanaka L.M. Nakamura S. Antimicrob.

A wide range of mutations have been isolated in eukaryotic topoisomerase II leading to resistance to topoisomerase targeting drugs (reviewed in Ref. 24.Nitiss J.L. Anticancer Drugs. 1996; 7: 27-34PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations are found in regions of eukaryotic topoisomerase II that are homologous to gyrB andgyrA as well as in other regions of the protein. However, few mutations have been described that make the enzymes more sensitive to topoisomerase poisons (25.Elsea S.H. Hsiung Y. Nitiss J.L. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1913-1920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 26.Hsiung Y. Elsea S.H. Osheroff N. Nitiss J.L. J. Biol.

Because mutations that render the enzyme more resistant to poisons can occur by a variety of ways, including reduction in enzyme activity, drug-resistant mutations may not be informative about the mechanisms of actions of drugs (28.Nitiss J.L. Liu Y.X. Hsiung Y. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 89-93PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Sabourin M. Byl J.A.W. Hannah S.E. Nitiss J.L. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29086-29092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Drug-hypersensitive mutations may therefore be a uniquely useful set of tools for probing drug mechanisms. In this report, we describe a mutation in yeast topoisomerase II that renders the enzyme hypersensitive to multiple classes of topoisomerase II poisons, including intercalating agents and fluoroquinolones. All experiments for assessing drug sensitivity were carried out in JN362a (MATa ura3-52 leu2 trp1 his7 ade1-2 ISE2) or its isogenicrad52 − and top2-4 derivatives, JN362at2-4, (MATa ura3-52 leu2 trp1 his7 ade1-2 ISE2 top2-4), JN394 (MATa ura3-52 leu2 trp1 his7 ade1-2 ISE2 rad52::LEU2), and JN394t2-4 (MATa ura3-52 leu2 trp1 his7 ade1-2 ISE2 rad52::LEU2 top2-4). Yeast Top2p was purified using a top1 derivative of the protease-deficient strain JEL1 (30.Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10485-10489Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 31.Nitiss J.L. Zhou J. Rose A. Hsiung Y. Gale K.C. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3078-3085Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis was carried out in a 50 ml PCR reaction with a Perkin-Elmer GeneAmp PCR System 9600 (Norwalk, CT) using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The formation of each mutation requires two complementary oligonucleotides containing desired mutation site. For the construction of T744P mutant, the following pair of oligonucleotides were used. The underlined nucleotides indicate the change from wild type yeast TOP2: 5′-CAG TCA TTG GCA CAACCT ATT ATT GGG CTA GC-3′ and 5′-GC TAG CCC AAT AAT AGG TTG TGC CAA TGA CTG-3′. For the construction of the T744A mutant, the following pair of oligonucleotides were used: 5′-CAG TCA TTG GCA CAA GCT ATT ATT GGG CTA GC-3′ and 5′-GC TAG CCC AAT AAT AGC TTG TGC CAA TGA CTG-3′. For the construction of Q743P mutant, the following pair of oligonucleotides were used: 5′-GAG CAG TCA TTG GCA CCA ACT ATT ATT GGG C-3′ and 5′-G CCC AAT AAT AGT TGG TGC CAA TGA CTG CTC-3′. The plasmid pDEDTOP2 (32.Nitiss J.L. Liu Y.X. Harbury P. Jannatipour M. Wasserman R. Wang J.C. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4467-4472PubMed Google Scholar) was used as the template in PCR reactions. The reaction mixture (50 μl) contained 1× reaction buffer (supplied by Stratagene), 20 ng of template DNA plasmid, 125 ng of each primer with desired mutation nucleotide(s), 10 nm dNTPs, and 2.5 units of PfuDNA polymerase. PCR amplification used the following temperature regimes: one cycle of 95 °C for 30 s and then 16 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 24 min. To eliminate the wild type parental plasmid, the PCR products were then treated with 10 units of DpnI for 2 h at 37 °C.DpnI is an endonuclease specific for methylated or hemimethylated guanine (Gm6) and, presumably, should digest the parent template. One ml of the DpnI-treated PCR DNA was used to transform supercompetent XL1-Blue Epicurian colicells (supplied by Stratagene). Bacterial colonies were selected and subsequently grown up on LB medium containing 100 μg/ml of ampicillin. Plasmids were purified using QIAGEN-tip 100 (Santa Clarita, CA), as described by the manufacturer's protocol. All mutations mentioned above were verified by DNA sequencing. Drug sensitivity in yeast cells was carried out as described previously (26.Hsiung Y. Elsea S.H. Osheroff N. Nitiss J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20359-20364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar,32.Nitiss J.L. Liu Y.X. Harbury P. Jannatipour M. Wasserman R. Wang J.C.

Potmesil M. Kohn K. DNA Topoisomerases and Cancer. Oxford University Press, London1991: 77-91Google Scholar). Briefly, a logarithmically growing culture of yeast cells (grown in either YPDA (2% Bacto-peptone, 2% glucose, 1% yeast extract, 5 mg/liter adenine sulfate) or synthetic complete dropout medium as indicated) was diluted to 2 × 106 cells/ml, and drug or Me2SO was added. Aliquots were removed, diluted, and plated either to YPDA plates or to synthetic complete dropout plates. Synthetic complete dropout plates lack one nutrient required for growth of the yeast strains used and were used to maintain selection for plasmids that complement the auxotrophy. For example, in experiments examining cell survival with cells carrying pMJ1, cells were plated to synthetic complete medium lacking uracil. Survival is expressed relative to the number of viable colonies at the time of drug addition. Drug sensitivity determinations were carried out at least three times for each strain, and representative results are shown. Minimum lethal concentration (mlc) was determined by extrapolating cell survival versus drug concentration curves and determining the point that gives 100% cell survival. Cell survival curves for mlc determination were all calculating using 24-h drug exposure. Western analysis of yeast Top2 proteins was carried out as described previously. 2Jensen, L. H., Nitiss, K. C., Rose, A., Dong, J., Zhou, J., Hu, T., Osheroff, N., Jensen, P. B., Sehested, M., and Nitiss, J. L. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275,2137–2146. The yeast strains 394t2-4 pDEDTOP2 and 394t2-4 pDEDT744P were each inoculated into 200 ml of YPDA and grown at 30 °C to anA 600 of 2.0. Cell pellets were lysed with glass beads and a bead beater. Protein concentrations were quantitated using the Bradford reagent (35.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217370) Google Scholar), and 100 and 250 μg of protein from the total cell lysate were denatured and run on a 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad), and the membrane was incubated with 1:2500 anti-yeast TOP2 polyclonal antibody (Topogen) in phosphate-buffered saline plus 5% nonfat dried milk followed by incubation with a 1:2000 anti-rabbit Ig, horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.1% Tween 20. The proteins were visualized by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Yeast topoisomerase II was expressed for purification using the plasmid pGAL1TOP2 (36.Worland S.T. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4412-4416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in yeast strain JEL1t1−. Induction of Top2 by galactose and protein purification were as described previously (25.Elsea S.H.

Briefly, the reaction mixture contained 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 5.0 mmMgCl2, 2.5% glycerol, 0.5 mm ATP, 200 ng of pUC18, and the indicated amount of purified TOP2 protein. The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, subsequently stopped by addition of 1 μl of 0.5 m EDTA into each reaction. The reactions were loaded onto an agarose gel, and after electrophoresis, the DNA was visualized by staining the gel with ethidium bromide and photographing under UV light. Decatenation assays used the same conditions except 100 ng of kDNA from Crithidia fasiculata was substituted for pUC18 plasmid DNA. The K+/SDS assay was used to determine drug stabilized DNA cleavage and was performed as described previously (26.Hsiung Y. Elsea S.H. Osheroff N. Nitiss J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20359-20364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar,37.Jannatipour M. Liu Y.X. Nitiss J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18586-18592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of topoisomerase II to DNA was performed using gel mobility shift assay as described previously with minor modifications (25.Elsea S.H. Hsiung Y. Nitiss J.L. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1913-1920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 38.Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9944-9950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a 10-μl reaction volume containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 2.5% glycerol, 88.5 ng of pUC18, and varying amounts of purified Top2 protein was incubated at 30 °C for 6 min. The samples were then mixed with 1 μl of loading buffer consisting of 60% sucrose and 0.67% orange G and subjected to electrophoresis using a 1% agarose gel in TAE buffer (0.04m Tris acetate, 0.01 m EDTA). After electrophoresis at 6 volts/cm for 2.5 h, the gel was stained with ethidium bromide, visualized under UV light, and photographed. The DNA binds were quantitated using an IS-100 Digital Imaging System (Alpha Innotech Corporation, San Leandro, CA). The coordinates for the 92-kDa wild type yeast topoisomerase II structure were obtained from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (accession number 1bgw). The Protein Data Bank file was edited to remove residues 410–682, which includes the disordered linker region. Threonine 744 was replaced with proline using the Biopolymer module of the Insight II package (Molecular Simulations Inc.) on a Silicon Graphics workstation. All molecular dynamics simulations and energy minimizations were carried out using the SANDER module of the AMBER program, version 5.0 (Oxford Molecular). The T744P mutant was subjected to a 250-ps simulation (1-fs time step) at 310 K following a 40-ps equilibration cycle. The resulting structures were averaged and energy minimized. All graphics were constructed using Insight II (version 2.97/95.0). The crystal structure of a 92-kDa fragment of yeast topoisomerase II indicated the presence of a helix-turn-helix domain (39.Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Wang and colleagues (39.Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar) have suggested that the helix-turn-helix domain plays a critical role in DNA binding. This model of a structure of the yTOP2 protein, along with observations indicating that mutations within the helix-turn-helix altered sensitivity to topoisomerase II poisons, prompted us to construct a defined series of mutations in this domain. One mutagenesis strategy that we adopted changed residues in the helices of the domain to proline to test the effect of disrupting the secondary structures within this domain. Thr744 is in the middle of helix (the helix that is thought to be in the major groove of DNA. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis changed Thr744 to Pro in plasmid pDEDTOP2 (12.Elsea S.H. Osheroff N. Nitiss J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13150-13153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid expresses yeast TOP2 from the yeast DED1 promoter and results in 10–20-fold overexpression of the yeast enzyme. The mutagenized plasmid was transformed into strain JN394t2-4, which carries a temperature sensitive top2 allele. JN394t2-4 cells are unable to grow at 34 °C, because of a lack of topoisomerase II activity at this temperature. Transformation with pDEDTOP2 (T744P) restored normal growth of JN394t2-4 cells at 34 °C, indicating that the mutation did not eliminate top2 activity. Because the only topoisomerase II active at 34 °C is the top2 expressed from the plasmid, we next assessed the drug sensitivity of JN394t2-4 cells carrying the T744P mutant, compared with the same strain carrying an unmutagenized plasmid. Expression of T744P mutant resulted in a strain that was hypersensitive to the quinolone CP-115,953, a fluoroquinolone that is active against eukaryotic topoisomerase II (Fig. 1 A and Table I). Approximately 2.7 μm CP-115,953 was the mlc of drug with wild type yeastTOP2, and 0.6 μm was the mlc with cells expressing the T744P allele. Similar results were seen with yeast cells exposed to the intercalating topoisomerase II poison amsacrine (Fig.1 B). At 24 h, less than 1 μm mAMSA is required for cell killing when cells express the T744P TOP2mutant. The mlc of mAMSA for the mutant is approximately 0.6 μm. By contrast, cell killing is only observed with about 5 μm amsacrine when cells express wild typeTOP2.Table IMinimum lethal concentrations of Top2 mutations at positions 743 and 744 to mAMSA and CP-115,953mAMSACP-115,953μmμmWild type5.32.7T744P1.80.6T744A4.61.5Q743P12.23.3 Open table in a new tab Because the T744P mutant was hypersensitive to the fluoroquinolone CP-115,953, we were interested in determining whether the mutant was also hypersensitive to other fluoroquinolones that are principally active against prokaryotic type II topoisomerases. T744P expressing cells were hypersensitive to the antibacterial fluoroquinolones ciprofloxacin (data not shown). This result suggests that the T744P mutant is hypersensitive to quinolones generally and not just CP-115,953. A different result was obtained with the nonintercalating topoisomerase II poison etoposide. Yeast cells expressing either wild type TOP2 or the T744P mutant enzyme had comparable sensitivity to etoposide (data not shown). Although cell survival was consistently lower when cells expressing T744P were exposed to etoposide, compared with wild type cells, the differences in survival were not statistically significant, and no difference in the mlc was observed. This result suggests that the T744P mutant does not confer etoposide hypersensitivity. We previously showed that the level of drug sensitivity can depend on the level of active topoisomerase II protein and that an unstable topoisomerase II protein can lead to in vivo drug resistance (29.Sabourin M. Byl J.A.W. Hannah S.E. Nitiss J.L. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29086-29092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Conversely, an abnormally stable protein could lead to drug hypersensitivity. The level of topoisomerase II protein was examined by Western blot. Fig. 2 shows the level of topoisomerase II polypeptides in yeast cells expressing Top2 proteins from the DED1 promoter. Although the levels of wild type and T744P proteins are similar, there is a slightly lower level of the T744P polypeptide. This suggests that the hypersensitivity is not due to enhanced stability of the T744P polypeptide. To examine the biochemical properties of the T744P mutant, we introduced the T744P mutation into the plasmid pGALTop2 (36.Worland S.T. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4412-4416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), overexpressed the protein in yeast strain JELt1−, and purified the mutant protein. The activity of the mutant protein was then compared with wild type topoisomerase II, by examining ATP-dependent relaxation of supercoiled plasmid DNA. Top2p carrying the T744P mutation has essentially the same specific activity for relaxation of supercoiled DNA as wild type Top2p (Fig.3). Similar levels of specific activity between wild type and Thr744 Top2p were also seen when comparing the decatenation of kinetoplast DNA (data not shown). We next examined levels of drug-dependent and drug-independent cleavage by K+/SDS precipitation. In these assays, drug-induced cleavage was compared with DNA cleavage in the absence of drug for both wild type and T744P Top2 proteins. Data for the drug-independent cleavage for this series of experiments were pooled to compare the level of drug-independent cleavage of the wild type and mutant proteins. To account for the different specific activities of the 32P-labeled DNA substrate prepared on different days, we determined the ratio of drug-independent cleavage with T744P protein to the drug-independent cleavage with wild type topoisomerase II, where the measurements with both enzymes were carried out with the same batch of substrate. This ratio was 1.09 ± 0.22 (mean ± S.D., n = 11). The 95% confidence interval was 0.94–1.24. These results suggest that there was not a significant difference in drug-independent cleavage between the T744P and wild type topoisomerase II proteins. We next compared the level of DNA cleavage obtained with wild type and Thr744 topoisomerase II in the presence of topoisomerase II poisons. Fig. 4 A shows the DNA cleavage obtained at low mAMSA concentrations, and Fig. 4 Bshows the results obtained at higher drug concentrations. Enhanced cleavage can be clearly seen at low mAMSA concentrations. The mAMSA concentration required to increase the drug-independent cleavage by a factor of two is approximately 0.15 μm for the T744P protein and 0.64 μm with wild type topoisomerase II. There is less difference between the two proteins at higher drug concentrations. At 50 μm, there is approximately a 2-fold difference in the level of cleavage between the two proteins. A similar result was obtained with CP-115,953. DNA cleavage in the presence of CP-115,953 is shown in Fig.5. A drug concentration of 0.3 μm doubles DNA cleavage over drug-independent levels with the T744P protein, whereas approximately 3 μm is required to double DNA cleavage with wild type Top2p. A smaller difference is seen at 10 μm drug, where the fold stimulation differs between the two proteins by a factor of two. Results obtained from drug cytotoxicity measurements suggested that the T744P mutant would not show enhanced cleavage in the presence of etoposide. The experiment shown in Fig. 6bears out this prediction. Etoposide-stimulated cleavage is essentially identical between the T744P and wild type Top2p at all etoposide concentrations examined. Taken together, results with the purified T744P protein demonstrate the same pattern of drug sensitivity predicted from in vivo cytotoxicity measurements. We also examined the effect of a more potent intercalating topoisomerase II poison, mitoxantrone. Mitoxantrone, like other strong intercalating agents, shows a sharp maximum in the level of cleavage at relatively low drug concentrations. At higher drug concentrations, DNA cleavage is inhibited. Both wild type and T744P proteins show identical maxima at 0.45 μm mitoxantrone (Fig.7). The concentration of mitoxantrone required to double DNA cleavage was about 0.1 μm with the T744P protein and about 0.2 μm with wild type Top2p. The level of maximal level of cleavage was also slightly higher with the T744P mutant protein. The T744P protein also shows slightly more inhibition of cleavage at higher mitoxantrone c"
https://openalex.org/W2331514128,"The transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) plays an important role in constraining cellular proliferation, but it is also a potent inducer of programmed cell death or apoptosis. Here, we demonstrate that TGF-beta can have an opposite effect, acting as a survival factor to prevent c-Myc-induced cell death in Rat-1 fibroblasts. However, in marked contrast to TGF-beta, Smad2, which is a critical intracellular mediator of the TGF-beta signaling pathway, functions as an antagonist to induce increased cell death. The protective activity of TGF-beta was associated with the activation of c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) and was not linked to the ability of TGF-beta to promote cell cycle progression. Expression of dominant-interfering forms of various components of the JNK signaling pathway, including Rac1, Cdc42, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (MKK4), and c-Jun, abolished TGF-beta-mediated cell survival. Furthermore, overexpression of the constitutively activated mutant RacL61F37A, which selectively stimulates JNK cascade but not G1 cell cycle progression or actin polymerization, was sufficient to prevent apoptosis induced by c-Myc. These findings describe a differential effect of two separated signaling pathways of TGF-beta and indicate for the first time that Smad2 can act as antagonist to suppress TGF-beta-dependent cell survival.

The complexity of the various populations of endosomes has been demonstrated by the exquisite repertoire of endogenous proteins. In this study we examined the distribution of cellubrevin in the endocytic compartment of hepatocytes, since its intracellular location and function in polarized cells are largely unknown. Highly purified rat liver endosomes were isolated from estradiol-treated rats, and the early/sorting endosomal fraction was further subfractionated in a multistep sucrose density gradient, and studied.

In general, the main features of this pathway are relatively well understood and involve the internalization of receptor/ligand complexes via clathrin-coated pits and vesicles that rapidly lose their coat to fuse with the early/sorting endocytic compartment. Whereas receptors are sorted and diverted into a complex tubular network of membranes, and recycle back to the plasma membrane, ligands are targeted into the late endosomes and eventually to the lysosomal compartment for degradation. Although this is still considered the main route, different ports of entry have now been described, for example by non-clathrin-coated pits and/or by caveolae (1.Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). Indeed, the endocytic destination for these different ports of entry could also differ, as could the connections between intracellular pathways along the endocytic stations, which are multiple and complex. Thus, whether endosomes undergo maturation (2.Stoorvogel W. Strous G.J. Geuze H.J. Oorschot V. Schwartz A.L. Cell. 1991; 65: 417-427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) or whether endocytic carrier vesicles are transported through pre-existing (3.Gruenberg J. Griffiths G. Howell K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1301-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) early and late endocytic compartments is still a matter of controversy. Besides, the possibility that, in some cells, early and late endosomes are part of an extensive tubular endocytic network has recently been shown (4.Gibson A. Futter C.E. Maxwell S. Allchin E.H. Shipman M. Kraehenbulh J.-P. Domingo D. Odorizzi G. Trowbridge I.S. Hopkins C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In polarized epithelial cells, surface polarity is generated and maintained by the membrane trafficking along the exocytic and endocytic pathways. For this reason, it is crucial to understand the molecular mechanism(s) as well as the endosomal constituents which contribute to these processes. Cellubrevin is a ubiquitous intracellular integral membrane protein involved in the constitutive recycling pathway (5.McMahon H.T. Ushkaryov Y.A. Edelman L. Link E. Binz T. Niemann H. Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 364: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 6.Daro E. van der Sluijs P. Galli T. Mellman I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It belongs to the v-SNARE1 family (synaptobrevin/VAMP-related protein) and, like synaptobrevin II (VAMP-2), it is proteolysed by tetanus toxin light chain. Recently, the localization of different SNAREs in MDCK cells and in CaCo-2 cells has been defined (7.Low S.H. Chapin S.J. Weimbs T. Kömüves L.G. Bennett M.K. Mostov K.E. Mol. Biol.

However, its precise function in polarized cells remains unknown. In the hepatocyte, it is generally assumed that there is a default biosynthetic transport of membrane proteins to the basal surface (sinusoidal plasma membrane). From there on and through the endocytic compartment, there is a specialized transcellular transport to the bile canalicular plasma membrane (apical domain), where transcytosis is accomplished (e.g. transcytosis of pIgA). Although this is assumed to be the main route, evidence for direct targeting into the apical (bile canalicular) plasma membrane has been reported (9.Kipp H. Sai Y. Arias I.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 209aCrossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 10.Ali N. Evans W.H. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 11.van Ijzendoorn S.C.D. Hoekstra D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 683-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Less known is the route for the incorporation of membrane proteins into the lateral plasma membrane, e.g. connexins, which assemble in a gap junction (12.George C.H. Kendall J.M. Evans W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8678-8685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), or desmosomal glycoproteins. Two different intracellular regions actively involved in the sorting and processing of endocytosed ligands and receptors have been depicted in the hepatic cell: 1) the subapical endocytic compartment (13.Barr V.A. Hubbard A.L. Gastroenterology. 1993; 105: 554-571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 14.Barroso M. Sztul E.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 83-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) involved in the deep recycling of receptors, such as the ASGP-R (15.Enrich C. Evans W.H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 48: 344-352PubMed Google Scholar), in the late stages of transcytosis of pIgA (16.Tuma P.L. Finnegan C.M. Hubbard A.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1089-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and defined by its enrichment of annexin VI (17.Ortega D. Pol A. Biermer M. Jäckle S. Enrich C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 261-269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Topologically, is located around the bile canaliculus and is close to the Golgi-lysosomal region of the cell. 2) Less characterized are the basolateral early/sorting endosomes at the subsinusoidal region of hepatocyte, presumably involved in the rapid (constitutive) recycling of receptors back to the sinusoidal plasma membrane, in the early sorting of molecules for transcytosis and, as shown recently, in the activation of signal transduction (18.16 Pol A. Calvo M. Enrich C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In this study we demonstrated that cellubrevin is specifically located in these early/sorting subsinusoidal endocytic structures. It shows an almost restricted location underneath the sinusoidal plasma membrane of hepatocytes, but after exogenous pIgA uptake it “moves” to the subapical domain, along the transcytotic pathway. Since no change in the cellubrevin-staining pattern was observed, in livers loaded with ligands that enter by receptor-mediated endocytosis (e.g.LDL) or by fluid phase markers (e.g dextran-FITC) and that follow the degradation pathway, we conclude that cellubrevin may be involved in transcytosis of IgA through the endocytic compartment. Male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 200–250 g were maintained under a controlled lighting schedule with 12-h dark period. All animals received humane care in compliance with institutional guidelines. Food and water were availablead libitum. pIgA was from Nordic Immunological Laboratories (Tilburg, The Netherlands); dextran-FITC (M r 70,000) was from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands). Human LDL (1.025 <d < 1.050 g/ml) was isolated from normolipidemic adult humans (19.Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6449) Google Scholar). The rabbit polyclonal affinity-purified antibody to membrane-bound annexin VI (17.Ortega D. Pol A. Biermer M. Jäckle S. Enrich C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 261-269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was provided by Dr. S. Jäckle (University of Hamburg), and the rabbit affinity-purified anti-cellubrevin (20.Majó G. Aguado F. Blasi J. Marsal J. Life Sci. 1998; 62: 607-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) was prepared in our laboratory. Mouse anti-transferrin receptor and anti-pIgR (SC-166) monoclonal antibodies were kindly provided by Dr. K. E. Mostov (University of California, San Francisco, CA). Mouse monoclonal antibodies to anti-annexin II (A14020) and anti-Raf-1 (R-19120) were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Rabbit polyclonal affinity-purified anti-Rab4 (sc-312) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). A rabbit anti-human apoB100 polyclonal antibody was kindly donated by Dr. Ulrike Beisiegel (University of Hamburg). Finally, a monoclonal anti-human IgA (α-chain-specific) (clone GA-112) was from Sigma (Madrid, Spain). Fluorescently conjugated (FITC and Cy 3) antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). After 3 days of 17-α-ethinyl estradiol treatment to induce the expression of the low density lipoprotein receptors (21.Chao Y.S. Windler E.E Chen G.C. Havel R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11360-11366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), rats were anesthetized with isofluorane, and human LDL (5 mg of protein) was injected into the femoral vein. 20 min later, livers were removed and homogenized in 0.25 m sucrose with protease inhibitors. The method used for the isolation of the endosomal fractions from rat liver is described elsewhere (22.Belcher J.D. Hamilton R.L. Brady S.E. Hornick C.A. Jäckle S. Schneider W.J. Havel R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6785-6789Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 23.Jäckle S. Runquist E.A. Miranda-Brady S. Havel R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1396-1402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Three distinct endosomal fractions were obtained after centrifugation of a crude endosome fraction in a sucrose gradient: MVB at 8.24%/19.3%, CURL at 19.3%/28.81%, and RRC at 28.81%/36.37% (w/v) interfaces. Each fraction was collected, and ice-cold water was added to render the fractions isotonic. The isotonic fractions were pelleted, resuspended in 0.9% NaCl, and stored at −80 °C. In some experiments, the interface corresponding to CURL or to RRC were mixed with heavy sucrose (2.5 m) and loaded at the bottom of a discontinuous sucrose gradient with 19%, 21%, 23%, 25%, 27%, and 29% sucrose (w/v) for CURL or 29%, 31%, 33%, 35%, 37%, and 39% for RRC, and the tubes were centrifuged at 28,000 rpm for 2 h 50 min, in a Beckman SW28 rotor. Following centrifugation, the interfaces were unloaded, pelleted, resuspended in 0.9% NaCl, and stored at −80 °C. The same procedure was also performed in those experiments where IgA was injected into the portal vein. A plasma membrane fraction derived from the lateral and canalicular domains of the hepatocyte was isolated essentially according to the method described by Neville (24.Neville Jr., D.M. J. Biophys. Biochem. Cytol. 1960; 8: 413-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE of proteins was performed in 10% or 12% polyacrylamide, as described by Laemmli (25.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). For Western blotting, polypeptides (3–5 μg of protein/channel) were transferred electrophoretically at 60 V for 60–90 min at 4 °C (depending on the proteins to be identified) to Immobilon-P transfer membranes (Millipore), and antigens were identified using specific antibodies diluted in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5% powdered skimmed milk, and finally the reaction product was detected using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Image analysis of Western blots and band quantification were performed with a Bio-Image system (Millipore). For cellubrevin immunoprecipitation, 50 μg of protein of the endosomal fractions RRC and CURL, from control and from IgA-injected rats, were solubilized with 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 140 mm KCl, 10 mm EDTA on ice, containing the following proteinase inhibitors: 50 mm NaF, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. After removal of the insoluble material in a microcentrifuge, the soluble fractions were incubated with rabbit anti-cellubrevin antibody or with normal rabbit serum (control) overnight at 4 °C. Protein immunocomplexes were then incubated with Protein A-Sepharose (Pierce) for 1 h at 4 °C, collected by centrifugation, and washed three times with the same buffer used for solubilization except that 0.1% Triton X-100 was used. For the pIgR immunoprecipitation, the mouse monoclonal anti-pIgR antibody (SC-166) was used according the procedure described by Lutonet al. (26.Luton F. Vergés M. Vaerman J.-P. Sudol M. Mostov K.E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 627-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar); briefly, liver endosomal fractions (50 μg of protein), with or without IgA, were solubilized in a freshly buffer of 1% Nonidet P-40, 125 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mm NaF, 2 mm sodium vanadate, and protease inhibitor mixture. After washing, immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the presence of coimmunoprecipitated pIgR or cellubrevin analyzed by Western blotting. A non-related monoclonal antibody was used as control. The protein content of the samples was measured by the method of Bradford (27.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. pIgA (100 μg), LDL (5 mg), or dextran-FITC (5 mg) (M r 70,000) or 0.9% NaCl for control animals, were injected into the portal vein (except for LDL, which was injected into the femoral vein) of Harlan Sprague-Dawley (200–250 g) rats anesthetized with isofluorane, and 2.5 or 20 min later livers were perfused with 2% paraformaldehyde-PBS (50 ml). Small pieces of liver were post-fixed for 2 h in the same fixative, then washed in PBS and cryoprotected by sucrose embedding, and finally frozen on dry ice. Cryostat sections (6–8 μm) were obtained, air-dried, and hydrated in PBS before immunostaining (15.Enrich C. Evans W.H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 48: 344-352PubMed Google Scholar). Confocal microscopy (Leica TCS NT) was used to collect the images, equipped with a 63× Leitz Plan-Apo objective (numeric aperture 1.4). Images represent approximately 1.0-μm optical sections. Adobe Photoshop software (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA) was used for image processing. Finally, in some experiments, hepatocytes in primary culture were prepared from Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats by liver perfusion using collagenase type IV (28.Bissell D.M. Hammker L.E. Meyer U.A. J. Cell Biol. 1973; 59: 722-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) (30 μg/ml Hanks' medium) (Sigma). Isolated hepatocytes were allowed to attach overnight at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator before fixation. In hepatocytes, transferrin-FITC (20 μg/ml) in 0.5% BSA/Hepes-buffered serum-free medium was internalized over 60 min. After washes, cells were fixed in PLP (4% paraformaldehyde in 40 mm sodium phosphate, 75 mm lysine buffer (pH 7.4) containing 9.1 mm sodium periodate) fixative and permeabilized with 0.1% saponin in 0.5% BSA/PBS, 20 mmglycine for 10 min. Cells were subsequently processed for indirect immunofluorescence with anti-cellubrevin antibody and a goat anti-rabbit IgG F(ab)′2-conjugated-Cy 3 secondary antibody. Finally, cells on coverslips were mounted on glass slides with Mowiol and examined under a confocal microscope. For electron microscopy, rat livers were perfused in situ with 50 ml of PBS containing 2 mm CaCl2 and 2 mm MgCl2and then with 100 ml of 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 3% polyvinylpyrrolidone (15.Enrich C. Evans W.H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 48: 344-352PubMed Google Scholar). Liver pieces were placed in cold fixative, further dissected, and left in fixative overnight at 4 °C. The tissue was then washed in PBS and incubated in 0.5 mNH4Cl in PBS for 60 min. at 4 °C. After washing in PBS, the tissue was dehydrated with increasing concentrations of ethanol in distilled water (30 min/change) on ice up to 75% ethanol, transferred to 95% ethanol and then to absolute ethanol, both changes at −20 °C for 2 h each. Tissue samples were then infiltrated with Lowicryl K4M:ethanol (1:2 and then 2:1 at −20 °C for 1 h each) and then with daily changes of undiluted Lowicryl for 1 week at −20 °C. For polymerization, each piece of liver was transferred to a gelatin capsule containing Lowicryl and left under UV (360 nm) overnight at −35 °C and then for additional 48 h at room temperature. Ultrathin sections were cut using a Reichert Ultracut E microtome and collected on Formvar-coated gold grids. For cellubrevin localization, grids were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with primary antibodies (1:10) in PBS containing 1% BSA. After washing, the grids were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with protein A conjugated to colloidal gold particles in PBS containing 1% BSA, 0.075% Triton X-100, 0.075% Tween 20. After several washes, sections were stained with saturated ethanolic uranyl acetate, counterstained with lead citrate, and examined in a Hitachi HT-600 electron microscope. As control for immunostaining, sections were incubated with the second antibodies (protein A-gold) only; the labeling was specific as no signal was obtained (data not shown). Cellubrevin is a ubiquitous integral membrane protein, abundantly expressed in the liver but with a completely unknown intracellular location and function. By using an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody to cellubrevin (developed and characterized in our laboratory (Ref. 20.Majó G. Aguado F. Blasi J. Marsal J. Life Sci. 1998; 62: 607-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar)), we studied the intracellular distribution of this v-SNARE protein in rat liver and in isolated endosomes. Highly purified endosomes from estradiol-treated rats were used to find out the distribution of cellubrevin in the hepatic endocytic compartment. The high level of purity of the three endosomal fractions, isolated from rat liver by the method developed by Havel and co-workers, is well documented (22.Belcher J.D. Hamilton R.L. Brady S.E.

Recently, we have also carried out a detailed comprehensive biochemical characterization of these endosomal fractions (18.16 Pol A. Calvo M. Enrich C.

Fig.1 shows the distribution of cellubrevin by Western blotting in the endosome and plasma membrane fractions isolated from rat liver. Cellubrevin was specifically enriched in two of the endosomal fractions (CURL, 45% and RRC, 40%). The late endosomal fraction (MVB) contained only 15% of the total cellubrevin. Cellubrevin was also detected in a Golgi-isolated fraction (10 -20%, compared with the amount of TGN38; data not shown) but was not detected in a plasma membrane fraction isolated from rat liver (this fraction was mainly from the canalicular/lateral plasma membrane domains). CURL has been characterized as the early/sorting compartment, whereas the RRC is a more complex fraction that includes recycling (22.Belcher J.D. Hamilton R.L. Brady S.E. Hornick C.A. Jäckle S.

Hepatology. 1996; 24: 226-232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but also contains caveolin (38.Pol A. Calvo M. Lu A. Enrich C. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 1848-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy of isolated fractions showed the differential morphology between isolated endosomes; whereas MVB is always a very homogeneous fraction, CURL and RRC showed a certain degree of heterogeneity, most probably reflecting the presence of various subpopulations of “early” and “recycling” endosomes. In order to dissect and further characterize the early endocytic structures, we attempted to separate them in an additional subfractionation step. Isolated CURLs were loaded in an additional continuous sucrose density gradient, and fractions were separated by flotation at 28,000 rpm for 2 h and 50 min (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Samples unloaded from different densities of the gradient were analyzed by Western blotting. The amount and the distribution of annexin VI, transferrin receptor, Rab4, and annexin II were very similar along the 19–29% (w/v) sucrose density gradient (Fig. 2). Interestingly, cellubrevin, pIgA, and Raf-1 showed a more restricted distribution, with a peak in the middle of the sucrose gradient (25% sucrose). The distribution of cellubrevin was studied and compared with annexin VI as an endosomal marker for the apical endosomes (17.Ortega D. Pol A. Biermer M. Jäckle S. Enrich C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 261-269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Examination of frozen sections of rat liver treated with the affinity-purified anti-annexin VI antibody showed that fluorescence was concentrated predominantly in the canalicular (apical) region of hepatocytes (Fig.3 b). The staining with anti-cellubrevin affinity-purified antibody shows the labeling in the subsinusoidal (basal) region of hepatocytes (Fig. 3 a) (double labeling was not attempted because both antibodies were polyclonal). Controls using antibodies to antigens located at the plasma membrane of endothelial cells (RECA-1) clearly showed labeling with anti-cellubrevin in the hepatocyte (data not shown). In some experiments, the intracellular location of cellubrevin was also examined in primary cultured hepatocytes. Cellubrevin showed a punctate, vesicular, staining underneath the plasma membrane around single cells or, in couplets, it was also observed in the pericanalicular (Golgi-lysosomal) region (Fig. 3 c). In these experiments, transferrin-FITC was internalized for 60 min, then cells were fixed and immunolabeled with anti-cellubrevin antibody; Fig.3 d shows that cellubrevin did not co-localize with the recycling transferrin compartment, in the perinuclear region of hepatocytes. Finally, to examine in more detail the type of structures labeled by the anti-cellubrevin antibody, immuno-electron microscopy was performed on Lowicryl sections. Fig. 4 shows representative areas in which intracellular subsinusoidal structures were labeled with anti-cellubrevin antibody (protein A and 10 nm gold used as a secondary antibody). Tubules, but also vesicles and tubulovesicular endocytic structures close to the sinusoidal plasma membrane, can be observed with scattered gold labeling on the cytoplasmic face. A few small vesicles were also labeled with anti-cellubrevin in the pericanalicular region of the hepatocyte (subapical endocytic compartment), where most of the endocytic structures were larger and with vesiculotubular morphology (positive for annexin VI; see Ortega et al. (Ref. 17.Ortega D. Pol A. Biermer M. Jäckle S. Enrich C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 261-269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). To assess the possible involvement of cellubrevin containing endocytic structures in the transcytotic route of the hepatic cell, exogenous pIgA (100 μg) was injected into the portal vein and 2.5 and 20 min later livers were removed and immunocytochemical studies were performed (control livers were injected with 0.9% NaCl). Human IgA was efficiently taken up by the liver of normal and estradiol-treated rats; 15 min after intravenous injection, approximately 50% was recovered in the liver (37.Enrich C. Jäckle S. Havel R.J. Hepatology. 1996; 24: 226-232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows the immunocytochemical localization of cellubrevin in control (0.9% NaCl) and in IgA-injected rats. Rat liver frozen sections were double labeled with anti-cellubrevin antibodies, followed by the secondary fluorescently labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG-FITC and a mouse anti-human IgA followed by a rabbit anti-mouse IgG-Cy 3. Cellubrevin (optical section from confocal microscopy) was mainly concentrated underneath the sinusoidal plasma membrane domain of hepatocytes (Fig. 5 a). The labeling with anti-mouse human IgA showed little cross-reactivity with the endogenous rat IgA (Fig. 5 b). When a pulse of exogenous pIgA (100 μg) was given and livers analyzed 2.5 and 20 min later, it can be observed that, although the subsinusoidal cellubrevin staining remained (arrowheads), a subapical cellubrevin labeling emerged in some hepatocytes after 20 min, which co-localized with IgA (Fig. 5 g,arrows; see also overlay panels c,f and i). After 2.5 or 20 min, the exogenous IgA was detected inside the hepatocytes and at the sinusoidal plasma membrane (Fig. 5, e and h) (in agreement with studies of Hoppe et al. (39.Hoppe C.A.

We have been studying the role of p300 in the transcription of a variety of genes, and we became interested in the role of this coactivator in the transcription of genes important in breast epithelial cell biology. From MCF-10A cells (spontaneously immortalized, nontransformed human breast epithelial cells), we developed cell lines that stably overexpress p300. These p300-overexpressing cells displayed reduced adhesion to culture dishes and were found to secrete an extracellular matrix deficient in laminin-5. Laminin-5 is the major extracellular matrix component produced by breast epithelium. Immunofluorescence studies, as well as experiments using normal matrix, confirmed that the decreased adhesion of p300-overexpressing cells is due to laminin-5-deficient extracellular matrix and not due to loss of laminin-5 receptors. Northern blots revealed markedly decreased levels of expression of two of the genes (designated LAMA3 andLAMC2) encoding the α3 and γ2 chains of the laminin-5 heterotrimer in the cells that overexpress p300, whereasLAMB3 mRNA, encoding the third or β3 chain of laminin-5, was not markedly reduced. Transient transfection experiments with a vector containing a murine LAMA3 promoter demonstrate that overexpressing p300 down-regulates theLAMA3 promoter. In summary, overexpression of p300 leads to down-regulation of laminin-5 production in breast epithelial cells, resulting in decreased adhesion.

Peters D.J. Breuning M.H. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 178-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). p300 has enzymatic activity as a histone acetyltransferase that links chromatin remodeling with activation of transcription (2.Ogryzko V.V.

Yao T.P. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2478-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), is essential for normal embryonic and fetal development (5.Yao T.P. Oh S.P. Fuchs M.

Cell. 1998; 93: 361-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar), and may function as a tumor suppressor (6.Muraoka M. Konishi M. Kikuchi-Yanoshita R. Tanaka K. Shitara N. Chong J.M. Iwama T. Miyaki M. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1565-1569PubMed Google Scholar). The p300 protein has several distinct domains that interact specifically with diverse proteins. p300 shares many functions with a highly homologous protein, cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP).1 Whereas p300 and CBP seem to behave interchangeably for many functions, especially in vitro, there are also some specific functions for which one of the proteins cannot replace the other (7.Kawasaki H. Eckner R. Yao T.P. Taira K. Chiu R. Livingston D.M. Yokoyama K.K. Nature. 1998; 393: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Recently, experiments utilizing targeted gene disruption (knockout) technology have confirmed that p300 function is essential for normal embryonic cellular proliferation, morphogenesis, and development, with double knockouts resulting in 100% embryonic lethality (5.Yao T.P. Oh S.P. Fuchs M. Zhou N.D. Ch'ng L.E. Newsome D. Bronson R.T. Li E. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Cell. 1998; 93: 361-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). Even the haploinsufficiency of p300, as generated in the heterozygotes, resulted in severe developmental abnormalities and frequent embryonic lethality. Likewise, haploinsufficiency of CBP gives rise to the severe developmental abnormalities characteristic of the Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, including mental retardation, craniofacial abnormalities, skeletal abnormalities, and increased cancer incidence (8.Petrij F. Giles R.H. Dauwerse H.G. Saris J.J. Hennekam R.C. Masuno M. Tommerup N. van Ommen G.J. Goodman R.H. Peters D.J. Breuning M.H. Nature. 1995; 376: 348-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). Thus, normal levels of p300 cannot replace CBP during embryonic development, and normal levels of CBP cannot replace p300 during embryonic development: both proteins are required. In this paper, we describe the generation of stable cell lines from MCF10A cells that overexpress full-length p300 and the effects of this overexpression on production of laminin-5. Laminin-5 is the major extracellular matrix protein produced by MCF10A cells and is also the major protein in extracellular matrix of breast epithelium in vivo. The laminin-5 protein is a heterotrimeric glycoprotein consisting of the α3, β3, and γ2 chains with each chain the product of a separate gene, designated LAMA3,LAMB3, and LAMC2, respectively (9.Burgeson R.E. Chiquet M. Deutzmann R. Ekblom P. Engel J. Kleinman H. Martin G.R. Meneguzzi G. Paulsson M. Sanes J. et al.Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 209-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Not much is known about the transcriptional regulation of these genes to date. The murine promoter for the LAMA3 gene has been cloned (10.Ferrigno O. Virolle T. Galliano M.F. Chauvin N. Ortonne J.P. Meneguzzi G. Aberdam D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20502-20507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and its regulation by transforming growth factor β in keratinocytes was found to involve three AP-1 sites (11.Virolle T.

We show that p300 overexpression decreases the mRNA of both the LAMA3 andLAMC2 genes and can down-regulate the murineLAMA3 promoter in transient transfection assays. These results suggest that p300 may play an important role in the transcriptional regulation of the LAMA3 gene. The MCF10A (12.Soule H.D. Maloney T.M. Wolman S.R. Peterson Jr., W.D. Brenz R.

Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6075-6086PubMed Google Scholar) normal breast epithelial cell line was obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and was maintained in a 1:1 mix of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% equine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 0.01 mg/ml insulin (Sigma), 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA) 100 ng/ml cholera toxin (Sigma) and 500 ng/ml hydrocortisone (Collaborative Biomedical Products). Stably transfected clones were also supplemented with 50 μg/ml hygromycin (Sigma). 8O4G rat bladder carcinoma cells were maintained as described previously (13.Riddelle K.S. Green K.J. Jones J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Matrix preparations from MCF10A and 8O4G cells were prepared as described previously (14.Langhofer M. Hopkinson S.B. Jones J.C. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 753-764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Gospodorawicz D. Barnes D.W. Sirbasku D.A. Stao G.H. Methods for Preparation of Media Supplements and Substrata. Alan R. Liss, New York1984Google Scholar). Matrix still attached to plastic surfaces was either collected in sample buffer and run on an SDS-PAGE gel for Western blotting or labeled with 0.5 mg/ml biotinamidocaproic acid 3-sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Sigma) in PBS and then collected in sample buffer. Matrix preparations were resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and blotted to nitrocellulose. Blots were incubated with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and detected with the ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To coat surfaces with matrix for immunofluorescence and adhesion studies, MCF10A cells or 8O4G cells were grown to confluence, treated with 20 mm ammonium hydroxide to destroy the cells but preserve the matrix on the desired surface, and washed well to remove cell debris (15.Gospodorawicz D. Barnes D.W. Sirbasku D.A. Stao G.H. Methods for Preparation of Media Supplements and Substrata. Alan R. Liss, New York1984Google Scholar). New test cells for experiments were then plated on this matrix-coated surface. For stable transfections, MCF10A cells were transfected either with a helium-pulse Accell (gene gun) device (Agracetus, Inc., Middleton, WI) or with Superfect (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA) with the pTKHygro vector containing a hygromycin resistance gene under a thymidine kinase promoter and a vector designated pmet300. To generate pmet300, the cDNA for p300 was obtained from the p300CHA vector (16.Eckner R. Ewen M.E. Newsome D. Gerdes M. DeCaprio J.A. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 869-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar) and inserted 3′ to the metallothionein promoter in the pMet vector previously described by Morosov et al. (17.Morosov A. Phelps W.C. Raychaudhuri P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18434-18440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were selected for hygromycin resistance in MCF10A medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml hygromycin (Sigma), and clones were isolated. Individual clones were tested for incorporation of the pmet300 vector by genomic and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction with primers specific for p300 from the vector. Isolated clones positive for p300 were designated MOP1 and MOP2. Hygromycin-resistant MCF10A cells that do not contain the pmet300 vector were designated M-H cells. Protein expression of p300 from the pmet300 vector was confirmed by immunoprecipitation with an antibody to the HA tag: 12CA5 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The following plasmids were used for transient transfections. The plasmid CMVp300CHA, containing a CMV promoter driving expression of full-length p300 with an HA tag, was a kind gift of David Livingston (16.Eckner R. Ewen M.E. Newsome D. Gerdes M. DeCaprio J.A. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 869-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). The plasmid pGalA, containing the murine LAMA3Apromoter upstream from a β-galactosidase reporter, is the kind gift of Daniel Aberdam (10.Ferrigno O. Virolle T. Galliano M.F. Chauvin N. Ortonne J.P. Meneguzzi G. Aberdam D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20502-20507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). MCF10A cells were transfected in 60-mm plates with Superfect (Qiagen, Inc.) with 10 μg of pGalA and cotransfected with 2.5 μg of pCMVp300CHA or empty vector and 2 μg of pCMV luciferase vector as an internal control. Cells were harvested in Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) between 24 and 48 h. Cells were washed with PBS and lysed with 1× lysis reagent (Promega), following the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was assayed by mixing aliquots of cell extracts with luciferin reaction mixture (Promega luciferase assay kit), and emission of light was quantitated with a Microlumat luminometer. β-Galactosidase activity was determined using the β-galactosidase luminescence kit (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) per the manufacturer's instruction. Transfections were normalized for efficiency by normalizing relative light units from the β-galactosidase assay to the luciferase light units for each individual sample. To verify protein expression from the pmet300 vector, exogenous p300 was immunoprecipitated using antibody to the HA tag. For the MOP1 cell line, cells were radiolabeled with [35S]methionine for 24 h, lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mmTris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin), and immunoprecipitated with the 12CA5 antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to the HA tag of p300. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, the gel was fixed and dried, and bands detected by autoradiography. With the MOP2 cell line, whole cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the 12CA5 antibody, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and blotted with the anti-p300, carboxyl terminus, clone RW128 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Analysis of total p300 levels was performed by collecting cell lysates in a borate buffer (50 mm sodium borate, 150 mmNaCl, 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid). 150 μg of protein was loaded on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. This membrane was then blotted with the p300 N15 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), which does not cross react with CBP, incubated with a secondary goat-anti-mouse antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, and detected by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Western analysis of laminin-5 subunits was performed on cell lysates and matrix preparations in SDS-urea buffer. Antibody 10B5 to laminin-5 α3 (18.Goldfinger L.E. Stack M.S. Jones J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), mouse monoclonal antibody 3D5 to laminin-5 γ2, and the commercially available mouse antibody to kalinin B1 (laminin-5 β3 subunit), Clone 17 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) were used. The anti-vinculin antibody was the mouse monoclonal VIN-11–5 from Sigma. Goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad) was used as a secondary antibody. The primary antibody to actin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was detected with a secondary goat-anti mouse IgM (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). The probe for β3 laminin-5 chain, clone 5-5C, and the EP-1 plasmid containing the laminin-5 α3 chain probe were generous gifts of Drs. Robert E. Burgeson and Maureen C. Ryan. TheLAMC2 probe was amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction with MCF10A RNA using polymerase chain reaction primers specific for the LAMC2gene (5′-AGATGTTGATGGCTGGAAGGCTAGC-3′ and 5′-AGGGTCACATTGTCAATGTA-3′). These primers create a fragment that runs from base pair 756 to base pair 1211 of the LAMC2 sequence obtained from GenBankTM. RNA was harvested from cells using the RNEasy Kit (Qiagen, Inc.). Samples of 30 μg of total RNA were electrophoresed in denaturing 1% agarose/formaldehyde gels and transferred by capillary action to Hybond-N membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 20× SSC. Blots were fixed and prehybridized at 68 °C for 1 h in QuikHyb buffer (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA).32P-Labeled probes were prepared by the random primer Redivue method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 1 × 106 cpm/ml of the LAMA3 probe plus an equal amount of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe as an internal control were added to the blot for 1 h of hybridization at 68 °C. The membrane was then washed twice in 2× SSC/0.1% SDS at room temperature for 5 min and once in 0.1× SSC/0.1% SDS for 30 min at 60 °C. This same blot was stripped and reprobed similarly with the LAMB3 and LAMC2 probes. Blots were visualized by autoradiography. Cells were trypsinized, washed with PBS, and resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-Ham's F-12 medium and plated in 96-well plates at a concentration of 2 × 104 cells/well. Fibronectin- and laminin-1-coated 96-well plates were obtained from Collaborative Biomedical Products. Rat laminin-5 was purified as described previously (19.Gonzales M. Haan K. Baker S.E.

Medium was aspirated from the plates, which were then washed by submersion in PBS. Remaining cells were stained in a solution of 0.05% methylene blue in 25% methanol for 10 min. Plates were then rinsed well with dH2O and allowed to dry. Once dry, 0.1 m sodium citrate in 50% ethanol was added to the wells to resuspend the methylene blue, and the absorbance was read at 540 nm. Measurements were normalized to crystal violet staining per cell for each cell type. M-H, MOP1, and MOP2 cells were grown on glass coverslips and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 5 min, washed with PBS, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 7 min, and washed again in PBS. The coverslips were incubated with primary antibody GoH3 (Immunotech, Inc., Westbrook, ME) for α6integrin staining, and antibody P1B5 (Life Technologies, Inc.) for α3 staining, diluted in PBS at 4 °C in a humid chamber overnight, washed three times in PBS, and incubated with an appropriate fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at 37 °C. MCF10A cells were stably transfected with the pmet300 plasmid expressing full-length p300 cDNA from the metallothionein promoter (17.Morosov A. Phelps W.C. Raychaudhuri P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18434-18440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The p300 in this construct was tagged with a hemagglutinin epitope at the carboxyl terminus (16.Eckner R. Ewen M.E. Newsome D. Gerdes M. DeCaprio J.A. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 869-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). These cells were simultaneously transfected with a plasmid containing the hygromycin resistance gene as a selectable marker. We chose the metallothionein promoter for two reasons: (a) we felt that high level p300 expression, using a CMV promoter for example, was likely to be toxic to the cells, and (b) the metallothionein promoter was likely to be activated in MCF10A medium containing 4 μm ZnSO4. Two clones, called MCF10A-overexpressing p300 1 and 2 (MOP1 and MOP2), were isolated that express p300 in low enough amounts that the cells continue growing in long term culture. Fig.1 A shows an immunoprecipitation of [35S]methionine-labeled cell lysates with an anti-HA antibody that was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. M-H control cells, which are resistant to hygromycin but do not contain the pmet300 vector, expressed no HA-tagged protein. MOP1 cells expressed a protein that migrated at 300 kDa and was immunoprecipitated with an antibody to the HA tag. In Fig. 1 B, we show that cell lysates from MOP2 cells immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody and blotted with an anti-p300 antibody detected HA-tagged p300, which was absent in M-H control cells. This confirms the identity of the 300-kDa band immunoprecipitated by the anti-HA antibody to be p300. Western analysis of whole cell extracts in Fig. 1 C demonstrates that there was a 3-fold increase of p300 in MOP1 cells compared with M-H control cells and that MOP2 cells maintained a 5-fold higher level of p300 than M-H cells. The morphology of these cells in tissue culture is shown in Fig. 2. M-H cells maintain a normal epithelial cobblestone morphology (Fig. 2 A).Panels B and C of Fig. 2 show the more stellate morphology of MOP1 and MOP2 cells, respectively. We have observed that the stellate morphology of MOP cells is more pronounced when the cells are at a low density and less so at higher densities.Figure 2Cellular morphology. Photos of cells growing in tissue culture at a magnification of × 200 taken with an Olympus model SC35 camera. A, typical epithelial cobblestone morphology of M-H control cells.

Sorensen T.S. Shikama N. La Thangue N.B. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2695-2710Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In muscle cells, p300 is required for Myo-D-dependent cell cycle arrest (22.Puri P.L. Avantaggiati M.L. Balsano C. Sang N. Graessmann A. Giordano A. Levrero M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 369-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we hypothesized that overexpression of p300 in MOP cells may have altered the growth rates of these cells. Fig.3 shows that M-H cells maintained a faster growth rate than MOP1 and MOP2 cells. Growth of M-H cells is similar to that of parental MCF10A cells (data not shown). Saturation densities at day 8 were 31.2, 9.1, and 5.4 × 104cells/cm2 for M-H, MOP1, and MOP2 cells, respectively. We observed that the MOP1 and MOP2 cells required less time for trypsinization when passaging the cells. This observation led us to test the adhesion of cells overexpressing p300 on tissue culture and three extracellular matrix substrates. Fig. 4 shows the results of 3-h adhesion assays. MOP1 and MOP2 cell adhesion was 75 and 41% of the M-H control cell adhesion, respectively. The adhesion of cells on fibronectin improved by 14, 37, and 230% for M-H, MOP1, and MOP2 cells, respectively. The increase in adhesion of M-H, MOP1, and MOP2 cells to laminin-5 was 56, 25, and 154%, respectively. When plated on laminin-1, the adhesion of all three cell lines decreased by approximately 40%. Adhesion experiments were performed in which cells were treated with 20 μg/ml cycloheximide at the time of plating for the adhesion assay to inhibit protein synthesis in the cells. Cells were incubated for 3 h and stained as above. Adhesion of control cells was decreased by 72%, and MOP1 and MOP2 adhesion was reduced 100%, to the cell-free baseline. This shows that protein synthesis is necessary for maximal adhesion in all of the cells tested. MCF10A cells secrete abundant extracellular matrix, of which laminin-5, a heterotrimeric protein with a molecular mass of greater than 400 kDa, makes up more than 80%. Laminin-5 consists of three subunits, α3, β3, and γ2, which in their processed forms are 160, 140, and 105 kDa, respectively. We analyzed more closely the laminin-5 production in these cells. Northern blot analysis with probes for the human LAMA3, LAMB3,and LAMC2 genes, which code for the α3, β3, and γ2 subunits of laminin-5 respectively, were performed. TheLAMA3 transcript was virtually absent in MOP cells overexpressing p300 (Fig. 5 A) compared with control cells. A longer exposure of the blot shown revealed that low amounts of LAMA3 transcript were visible in MOP cell lanes when MCF10A and M-H lanes were highly overexposed. The LAMB3 transcript normalized levels were not significantly different among the four cell types (Fig. 5 B). Densitometry of this LAMB3 blot revealed normalized values of 1.0, 0.9, 0.56, and 1.33 for MCF10A, M-H, MOP1, and MOP2 respectively. This shows that the values for LAMB3 levels may vary somewhat but not by a large amount or in a manner specifically correlating with p300 overexpression. The LAMC2 transcript was dramatically decreased in MOP cells similarly to theLAMA3 transcript (Fig. 5 C). Longer exposure of the blot shown revealed low levels of LAMC2 in MOP cells. Levels of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase are constant in all four cell types, which confirms that the down-regulation ofLAMA3 and LAMC2 transcript was not due to a general effect on transcription of overexpressing p300. On the basis of the RNA data, we examined protein levels of the α3, β3, and γ2 subunits by Western analysis of whole cell extracts and matrix preparations. We first collected matrix from confluent cells, which was subsequently biotinylated, electrophoresed, transferred to nitrocellulose, and detected by blotting with horseradish peroxidase-linked streptavidin. Fig.6 A shows the analysis of total cellular matrix from M-H, MOP1, and MOP2 cells. Laminin-5 subunits were easily detected in M-H cells but absent in MOP cells. We further analyzed matrix production by M-H, MOP1, and MOP2 cells by Western analysis with specific antibodies to each subunit. The α3 subunit was present in cell lysates and matrix from MCF10A and M-H cells in the 190-kDa unprocessed form and the 160-kDa processed forms (Fig.6 B). The α3 subunit was not detectable by Western blot in the MOP1 and MOP2 cell lysates or matrix (Fig. 6 B). The β3 subunit was present in the lysates of all cell types but was not seen in the MOP1 and MOP2 cell matrices (Fig. 6 C). We simultaneously blotted the β3 blot with an antibody to actin to control for protein loading. Densitometric analysis of the β3 blot in Fig. 6 B revealed that the amount of β3 protein present in the cell lysates from MCF10A and M-H cells contained 3.5-fold the amount present in MOP1 and MOP2 cells. This is different from the levels of RNA, which do not change significantly, but the difference is probably due to decreased β3 protein stability in MOP cells due to the lack of the other laminin-5 subunits. The γ2 subunit has a 155-kDa unprocessed and 105-kDa processed form. The Western analysis for the γ2 subunit showed mainly the unprocessed form in cell lysates of MCF10A and M-H cells but no γ2 in MOP1 or MOP2 cell lysates (Fig.6 D). The processed form was more evident in the matrix of MCF10A and M-H cells. The unprocessed form was still present because matrix samples were collected from subconfluent cells. Fig.6 E shows Western analysis of the blot shown in Fig.6 D, with an antibody to vinculin as a loading control for the cell lysates. Because the laminin-5 α3 subunit was dramatically reduced, we considered it possible that this gene is down-regulated at the transcriptional level. We performed experiments using a clone, designated pGalA, containing the promoter of the murine LAMA3A gene linked to the β-galactosidase reporter (8.Petrij F. Giles R.H. Dauwerse H.G. Saris J.J. Hennekam R.C. Masuno M. Tommerup N. van Ommen G.J. Goodman R.H. Peters D.J. Breuning M.H. Nature. 1995; 376: 348-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar, 36.Chopra A. Maitra B. Korman N.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 110: 52-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The laminin α3 chain in mice has two isoforms, designated 3A and 3B, each using its own promoter. This clone contains the promoter of the 3A isoform. Transient transfection experiments placing pGalA into MCF10A cells revealed that the mouseLAMA3A promoter drove transcription of beta galactosidase in these human cells (Fig. 7 A). Cotransfection of MCF10A cells with pGalA and a plasmid expressing p300 driven by a CMV promoter resulted in inhibition of pGalA-driven transcription by about 50% (Fig. 7 A). Cells were cotransfected with a CMVLuc construct, and results are shown normalized to luciferase activity. There was no evidence of a general repression of transcription in these cells, as the control CMV-luciferase plasmid expression was unchanged from controls that were not transfected with CMVp300 (data not shown). We next transiently transfected MCF10A, M-H, MOP1, and MOP2 cells with the pGalA vector and compared β-galactosidase activity between the different cell lines. We found that the MOP1 and MOP2 cells that overexpress p300 had decreased pGalA promoter activity compared with MCF10A and M-H controls (Fig. 7 B). The major receptors for laminin-5 on breast cells are the integrins α6β4 and α3β1. The α3β1 integrin localizes primarily in and near areas of cell-to-cell contact. M-H, MOP1, and MOP2 cells all displayed similar cell-to-cell contact accumulation of the α3 integrin (Fig. 8). The"

Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 341-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 2.Mueller B.K. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 351-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). These factors may act either locally or at a distance within the terrain of the developing embryo. A large body of experimental evidence has implicated the phylogenetically conserved netrin gene family in directing the long-range attraction of circumferentially migrating neurons inCaenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, and vertebrates (reviewed in Ref. 1.Goodman C.S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 341-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, the netrin-1 mRNA is expressed in the floor plate, the ventral midline intermediate target of migrating commissural neurons, before and during the migration of these neurons toward this structure (3.Kennedy T.E. Serafini T. de la Torre J.R. Tessier-Lavigne M. Cell. 1994; 78: 425-435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). The netrin-1 receptor on migrating commissural neurons is the netrin-binding DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer) protein, which is expressed on commissural axons as they migrate toward the floor plate (4.Keino-Masu K.

Mutant mice deficient for either the netrin-1 gene product or DCC exhibit defects in commissural axon migration from their birthplace in the dorsal spinal cord to the floor plate, demonstrating that their proper functioning is necessary for commissural axon guidance (5.Fazeli A.

Kennedy T.E. Galko M.J. Mirzayan C. Jessell T.M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Cell. 1994; 78: 409-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar). During this purification, an activity was discovered that collaborates with netrin-1 to promote outgrowth. Although recombinant netrin-1 protein is ∼10 times more active in eliciting axon outgrowth from E13 rat dorsal spinal cord explants than from E11 rat dorsal spinal cord explants, a high salt extract of E10 chicken brain membranes is equally active on E13 and E11 explants. We show that the difference is due to the presence in brain extracts of a distinct activity, netrin-synergizing activity (NSA), that is capable of potentiating the axon outgrowth-promoting effects of netrin-1 from E11 explants (7.Serafini T. Kennedy T.E. Galko M.J. Mirzayan C. Jessell T.M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Cell. 1994; 78: 409-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar). Because of its dramatic potentiation of netrin-mediated axon outgrowth in vitro, it seems likely that this activity may play an important role in commissural axon guidance in vivo. As a first step toward identifying NSA and determining its role in commissural axon guidance in vivo, we report here the results of a biochemical characterization of NSA from a netrin-depleted high salt extract of E10 chicken brain membranes.DISCUSSIONAxon guidance cues can be classified into four categories: positive or negative cues that act either locally or at a distance to guide axons within the developing embryo (1.Goodman C.S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 341-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 2.Mueller B.K. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 351-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The fact that NSA does not have any axon outgrowth-promoting activity on its own suggests that this activity may be acting in a mechanistically distinct manner from that of previously identified positive and negative axon guidance factors, through modulating the activity of a known axon guidance cue. It will be difficult to unravel the mechanism of action and in vivo function of this cue without its molecular identification. The results presented here should aid in that endeavor. Here we describe an improved assay for NSA and the use of this assay to define the biochemical properties of NSA. Fractionation of NSA reveals a number of important observations that should facilitate future molecular identification. First, despite its remarkable stability to a variety of denaturing conditions, this activity contains a necessary protein component for activity since it is abolished by protease treatment. This observation, coupled with the finding that NSA is a basic protein (indicated by the behavior of NSA on ion-exchange resins and on native acid/urea electrophoresis), indicates that NSA is not encoded by a glycosaminoglycan or proteoglycan moiety as was originally hypothesized (7.Serafini T. Kennedy T.E. Galko M.J. Mirzayan C. Jessell T.M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Cell. 1994; 78: 409-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar) since brain-derived proteoglycans (but not NSA) bind to anion exchangers at 150 mm NaCl (15.Herndon M.E. Lander A.D. Neuron. 1990; 4: 949-961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar).It appears that the NSA present in our starting material, a netrin-depleted high salt extract of embryonic chick brain membranes, may be heterogeneous, as indicated by the existence of multiple activity peaks that elute from a C4 reverse-phase chromatography column. All of these peaks must be encoded by basic proteins (since they all elute from heparin at basic pH), and they are likely to all be in the same size range (25–35 kDa) since this is where all NSA-like activity is recovered in nonreducing SDS electrophoresis experiments. One could argue that some of these NSAs are stable to trifluoroacetic acid and not to SDS (a possibility our stability experiments do not address) and that we therefore really know the size of only one of the three NSAs. Although this is possible, we think it is unlikely since resistance to one denaturing condition generally implies a structure that imparts resistance to other denaturing conditions. Examples of this principle include the neuregulins (16.Peles E. Yarden Y. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 815-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) and the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteases (17.Murphy G. Willenbrock F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 496-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), both of which survive exposure to a number of denaturing conditions. The most likely interpretation of our nonreducing electrophoresis and reverse-phase chromatography experiments is that each peak observed on reverse-phase chromatography is in the 25–35-kDa size range we defined for NSA by nonreducing SDS-PAGE.Most of the difficulty in purifying this activity can be attributed to the facts that we have not been able to identify a high enrichment affinity chromatography step specific for this activity (since neither a panel of lectins nor netrin affinity resins bind NSA) and that the steps we have identified so far give only modest enrichment of NSA (Table III). Published biochemical purifications of other axon guidance molecules have all included affinity steps and may not have been possible without them (7.Serafini T. Kennedy T.E. Galko M.J. Mirzayan C. Jessell T.M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Cell. 1994; 78: 409-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar, 18.Luo Y. Raible D. Raper J.A.

Cell. 1999; 96: 771-784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Through future fractionation experiments, we hope to determine whether the three activity peaks we observed with reverse-phase chromatography represent independent proteins, related but distinct proteins, or a single protein with several different modifications. Our suspicion, based on the results of nonreducing SDS-PAGE of NSA-containing fractions, is that NSA is encoded by minor protein species present in trace amounts in our fractions. Mass spectrometry and Edman degradation sequencing of the most abundant protein species that approximately cofractionate with our observed activity on reverse-phase chromatography (the ∼30-kDa bands shown in Fig. 5) bear this conclusion out; to date, the proteins we have sequenced from these fractions are all highly basic histone and ribosomal proteins. 2W. Henzel, C. Turck, M. Tessier-Lavigne, and M. J. Galko, unpublished observations. Although these proteins share biochemical properties with NSA, their intracellular nature makes it unlikely that they actually encode NSA. Due to low recoveries of NSA on reverse-phase chromatography, the lack of an affinity chromatography step, and the fact that NSA in embryonic chicken brain appears to be present in trace amounts, purification of NSA from embryonic chicken brain does not seem currently feasible. Identification of an affinity chromatography step or purification from a more abundant activity source (perhaps adult chicken or bovine brain) may surmount these obstacles to the molecular identification of NSAs. The faithful guidance of axons to their targets during development of the embryonic nervous system is believed to occur through the action of both positive and negative guidance factors (1.Goodman C.S.

The most likely interpretation of our nonreducing electrophoresis and reverse-phase chromatography experiments is that each peak observed on reverse-phase chromatography is in the 25–35-kDa size range we defined for NSA by nonreducing SDS-PAGE.Most of the difficulty in purifying this activity can be attributed to the facts that we have not been able to identify a high enrichment affinity chromatography step specific for this activity (since neither a panel of lectins nor netrin affinity resins bind NSA) and that the steps we have identified so far give only modest enrichment of NSA (Table III). Published biochemical purifications of other axon guidance molecules have all included affinity steps and may not have been possible without them (7.Serafini T. Kennedy T.E. Galko M.J. Mirzayan C.

Through future fractionation experiments, we hope to determine whether the three activity peaks we observed with reverse-phase chromatography represent independent proteins, related but distinct proteins, or a single protein with several different modifications. Our suspicion, based on the results of nonreducing SDS-PAGE of NSA-containing fractions, is that NSA is encoded by minor protein species present in trace amounts in our fractions. Mass spectrometry and Edman degradation sequencing of the most abundant protein species that approximately cofractionate with our observed activity on reverse-phase chromatography (the ∼30-kDa bands shown in Fig. 5) bear this conclusion out; to date, the proteins we have sequenced from these fractions are all highly basic histone and ribosomal proteins. 2W. Henzel, C. Turck, M. Tessier-Lavigne, and M. J. Galko, unpublished observations. Although these proteins share biochemical properties with NSA, their intracellular nature makes it unlikely that they actually encode NSA. Due to low recoveries of NSA on reverse-phase chromatography, the lack of an affinity chromatography step, and the fact that NSA in embryonic chicken brain appears to be present in trace amounts, purification of NSA from embryonic chicken brain does not seem currently feasible. Identification of an affinity chromatography step or purification from a more abundant activity source (perhaps adult chicken or bovine brain) may surmount these obstacles to the molecular identification of NSAs. Axon guidance cues can be classified into four categories: positive or negative cues that act either locally or at a distance to guide axons within the developing embryo (1.Goodman C.S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 341-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 2.Mueller B.K. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 351-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The fact that NSA does not have any axon outgrowth-promoting activity on its own suggests that this activity may be acting in a mechanistically distinct manner from that of previously identified positive and negative axon guidance factors, through modulating the activity of a known axon guidance cue. It will be difficult to unravel the mechanism of action and in vivo function of this cue without its molecular identification. The results presented here should aid in that endeavor. Here we describe an improved assay for NSA and the use of this assay to define the biochemical properties of NSA. Fractionation of NSA reveals a number of important observations that should facilitate future molecular identification. First, despite its remarkable stability to a variety of denaturing conditions, this activity contains a necessary protein component for activity since it is abolished by protease treatment. This observation, coupled with the finding that NSA is a basic protein (indicated by the behavior of NSA on ion-exchange resins and on native acid/urea electrophoresis), indicates that NSA is not encoded by a glycosaminoglycan or proteoglycan moiety as was originally hypothesized (7.Serafini T. Kennedy T.E. Galko M.J. Mirzayan C. Jessell T.M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Cell. 1994; 78: 409-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar) since brain-derived proteoglycans (but not NSA) bind to anion exchangers at 150 mm NaCl (15.Herndon M.E. Lander A.D. Neuron. 1990; 4: 949-961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). It appears that the NSA present in our starting material, a netrin-depleted high salt extract of embryonic chick brain membranes, may be heterogeneous, as indicated by the existence of multiple activity peaks that elute from a C4 reverse-phase chromatography column. All of these peaks must be encoded by basic proteins (since they all elute from heparin at basic pH), and they are likely to all be in the same size range (25–35 kDa) since this is where all NSA-like activity is recovered in nonreducing SDS electrophoresis experiments. One could argue that some of these NSAs are stable to trifluoroacetic acid and not to SDS (a possibility our stability experiments do not address) and that we therefore really know the size of only one of the three NSAs. Although this is possible, we think it is unlikely since resistance to one denaturing condition generally implies a structure that imparts resistance to other denaturing conditions. Examples of this principle include the neuregulins (16.Peles E. Yarden Y. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 815-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) and the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteases (17.Murphy G. Willenbrock F.

https://openalex.org/W2014729640,"Neurotrophins are important for the development and maintenance of the vertebrate nervous system, mediating their signal into the cell by specific interaction with tyrosine kinase receptors of the Trk family. The extracellular portion of the Trk receptors has been previously proposed to consist of a cysteine-rich motif, a leucine-rich motif, a second cysteine-rich motif followed by two immunoglobulin-like domains. Earlier studies have shown that a major neurotrophin-binding site in the Trk receptors resides in the second immunoglobulin-like domain. Although the individual amino acids in TrkA involved in binding to nerve growth factor (NGF) and those in TrkC involved in binding to neurotrophin-3 have been mapped in this domain, the Trk amino acids that provide specificity remained unclear. In this study, a minimum set of residues in the human TrkC second immunoglobulin-like domain, which does not bind nerve growth factor (NGF), were substituted with those from human TrkA. The resulting Trk variant recruited binding of NGF equivalent to TrkA, maintained neurotrophin-3 binding equivalent to TrkC, and also bound brain-derived neurotrophin, although with lower affinity compared with TrkB. This implies that the amino acids in the second immunoglobulin-like domain that determine Trk specificity are distinct for each Trk."
https://openalex.org/W2042767241,"Isovaleric acidemia is a rare inborn error of metabolism caused by a deficiency of isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase (IVD), a nucleus-encoded, homotetrameric, mitochondrial flavoenzyme that catalyzes the conversion of isovaleryl-CoA to 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA. We have previously identified a nucleotide deletion in the gene for IVD in fibroblasts from a patient with isovaleric acidemia leading to a shift in reading frame and premature termination of translation. The mutant IVD precursor is imported and processed to mature size, but no active enzyme is detected in mutant fibroblasts or expressed in Escherichia coli. Examination of the crystal structure of human IVD reveals that the C terminus is involved in tetramer stability. In vitro mitochondrial import experiments show that wild type IVD protein rapidly and stably forms mature homotetramer following import, whereas Type III mutant protein never forms stable oligomers. An additional series of mutant proteins with truncations and/or alterations in the C-terminal sequence implicates the C terminus of IVD in both enzyme activity and tetramer stability. Importantly, a dimeric intermediate in the folding pathway for wild type IVD has been identified in the in vitromitochondrial import experiments, the first report of such an intermediate in the biogenesis of an acyl-CoA dehydrogenase."

Science. 1973; 181: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (5022) Google Scholar), a polypeptide chain spontaneously folds into its most stable conformation.

Thus it may not be surprising to register cases of proteins that upon an influential change of conditions have access to two conformations: one monomeric, the other oligomeric (3.Crestfield A.M.

Protein chains that spontaneously fold and associate into two distinct quaternary structures in equilibrium are a different story. This is the case of bovine seminal RNase (BS-RNase1; for a review, see Ref. 8.D'Alessio G. Di Donato A. Mazzarella L. Piccoli R. D'Alessio G. Riordan J.F. Ribonucleases: Structures and Functions. Academic Press, New York1997: 383-423Crossref Google Scholar), a dimeric protein from the pancreatic-type family (9.Beintema J.J. Schuller C. Irie M. Carsana A. Progr. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1989; 51: 165-192Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar), an RNase also endowed with special, i.e. noncatalytic, biological actions. For this protein two quaternary structures have been described. In one structure (termed MxM), determined by x-ray crystallography (10.Mazzarella L. Capasso S. Demasi D. Di Lorenzo G. Mattia C.A. Zagari A. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1993; 49: 389-402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the two subunits interchange their NH2-terminal α-helices (see Fig.1 A). An alternative structure, in which there is no interchange (termed M=M, see Fig. 1 E) has been determined by biochemical analyses (11.Piccoli R. Tamburrini M. Piccialli G. Di Donato A. Parente A. D'Alessio G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and recently observed by x-ray crystallography (12.Sica F. Adinolfi S. Berisio R. De Lorenzo C. Mazzarella L. Piccoli R. Vitagliano L. Zagari A. J. Crystal Growth. 1999; 196: 305-312Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). It has been found (11.Piccoli R. Tamburrini M. Piccialli G. Di Donato A. Parente A. D'Alessio G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) that when the two quaternary forms of BS-RNase are isolated, they slowly convert into each other under pseudophysiological conditions until the equilibrium ratio of 2:1 is reached between the MxM and M=M forms. Thus, native BS-RNase as isolated, or upon refolding after denaturation and reduction of all disulfides (11.Piccoli R. Tamburrini M. Piccialli G. Di Donato A. Parente A. D'Alessio G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), may be better described as an equilibrium mixture composed of MxM and M=M forms plus all of the transient intermediates in the interconversion process. This interconversion may also be viewed as a steady-state unfolding/refolding of the protein regions comprising the NH2-terminal arms and the hinge peptides connecting them to the main bodies of the subunits. Our aim was to investigate this unusual phenomenon not only for the intrinsic interest in its structural aspects but also for its possible relevance to the special biological actions of the enzyme, in particular to its antitumor action, given the correlation suggested between the antitumor activity of seminal RNase and its content in the swapped form (13.Cafaro V.

Recently, trypsin was tested on the isolated BS-RNase forms and found to be capable of discriminating between MxM and M=M (16.De Lorenzo C. Dal Piaz F. Piccoli R. Di Maro A. Pucci P. D'Alessio G. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2653-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Different limit digest products (see Fig. 1, panels D andH) were obtained from the two forms after extensive digestion, with both products enzymatically active and stable. Here we report on the use of trypsin as a conformational probe to investigate the kinetics and the molecular basis of the MxM ⇔ M=M interconversion process. The results of this investigation led to the identification of relevant intermediates in the interconversion and to the description of a model for the interconversion process. This in turn shed a first light on the unusual case of a protein in which two quaternary conformations coexist. BS-RNase was isolated from bovine seminal vesicles as described (17.Tamburrini M. Piccoli R. De Prisco R. Di Donato A. D'Alessio G. Ital. J. Biochem. 1986; 35: 22-32PubMed Google Scholar); the preparations of the isolated quaternary forms MxM and M=M (11.Piccoli R. Tamburrini M. Piccialli G. Di Donato A. Parente A. D'Alessio G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and of the M-Cm monomeric derivative (18.D'Alessio G. Malorni M.C. Parente A. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 1116-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) of seminal RNase and of dimeric RNase A (19.Fruchter R. Crestfield A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 3868-3874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have been described previously. The S protein fragment of RNase A was a Sigma product. For kinetic analyses, unless otherwise stated, the proteins were incubated with 0.2 μm trypsin (Sigma) in 0.1 M Tris acetate, pH 8.4, at 37 °C, with an enzyme to substrate ratio of 1:50 (w/w). Aliquots of 10 μg were withdrawn, and the reaction was stopped by adding soybean trypsin inhibitor in a 10-fold excess (w/w) with respect to the enzyme. Products were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide (15%) gel electrophoresis (20.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) or by RP-HPLC (reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography) as described (16.De Lorenzo C. Dal Piaz F. Piccoli R. Di Maro A. Pucci P. D'Alessio G. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2653-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). For mass spectrometric analyses, the proteolytic experiments were carried out by treating the isolated dimeric forms (38 μm) of BS-RNase with 0.4 and 0.9 μmtrypsin, for M=M and MxM, respectively, at 37 °C in 0.4% ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5. The extent of proteolysis was monitored on a time course basis by sampling the reaction mixture at different reaction times ranging from 5 to 20 min. Samples were fractionated by RP-HPLC on a Vydac C18 column; peptides were eluted by means of a linear gradient of 5–40% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 60 min; elution was monitored at 220 nm. Individual fractions were collected and identified by ESMS (electrospray mass spectrometry, see below). Alternatively, aliquots of the peptide mixtures were analyzed directly by MALDI-MS without any purification step. When necessary, identification of disulfide-bridged protein fragments was carried out by reduction of samples with dithiothreitol in 50 mmTris-EDTA, 6 m guanidinium chloride, pH 7.5, for 2 h under a nitrogen atmosphere at 37 °C and alkylated with iodoacetamide (Fluka) in the same buffer for 20 min at room temperature in the dark. The modified components were separated by RP-HPLC and analyzed by ESMS. Proteolytic fragments obtained by limited proteolysis of BS-RNase forms, and separated by RP-HPLC (see above), were analyzed by ESMS using a BIO-Q triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Micromass) equipped with an electrospray ion source. Samples were directly injected into the ion source (kept at 80 °C) via a loop injection at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. Data were acquired and elaborated using the MASS-LINK program (Micromass). Mass calibration was performed by means of the multiply charged ions from a separate injection of horse heart myoglobin (average molecular mass 16951.5 Da); all masses are reported as average mass. MALDI mass spectra were recorded using a Voyager DE MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystem). A mixture of analyte solution, α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma) and bovine insulin (Sigma) was applied to the sample plate and dried at room temperature, under atmospheric pressure. Mass calibration was performed using the molecular ions from bovine insulin at 5734.5 Da and the matrix at 379.1 Da as internal standards. Raw data were analyzed by using a computer software provided by the manufacturer and are reported as average masses. Homogeneous MxM and M=M preparations, obtained as described (11.Piccoli R. Tamburrini M. Piccialli G. Di Donato A. Parente A. D'Alessio G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), were incubated at 37 °C at a concentration of 15 μm in 0.1 mTris acetate, pH 8.4, in the absence or in the presence of trypsin (0.3 μm). At suitable time intervals aliquots (30 μg) were tested for the MxM and M=M content as described (11.Piccoli R. Tamburrini M. Piccialli G. Di Donato A. Parente A. D'Alessio G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Briefly, after the selective reduction of the two intersubunit disulfides, noncovalent dimers and monomers were generated from the MxM and M=M form, respectively. The relative percentage of the dimeric and monomeric species was calculated after gel filtration on a Hi-load Superdex 10/30 fast protein liquid chromatography column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), equilibrated in 50 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 0.3 m sodium chloride, at a flow rate of 0.3 ml min−1. An aliquot (5 μg) of the reduced samples was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide (15%) gel electrophoresis (20.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) to verify that disulfide reduction was complete. Because the monomeric derivative (13.7 kDa) coeluted in the gel filtration pattern with the 17-kDa tryptic product, for an accurate evaluation samples were also analyzed by RP-HPLC, as described (16.De Lorenzo C. Dal Piaz F. Piccoli R. Di Maro A. Pucci P. D'Alessio G. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2653-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Native, as isolated BS-RNase (i.e.the equilibrium mixture of its MxM and M=M forms) was treated at a concentration of 66 μm at 37 °C with 1.5 μm trypsin in 0.1 m Tris acetate at pH 8.4. The reaction was stopped by the addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor. Analysis by SDS-gel electrophoresis of the tryptic products, illustrated in Fig. 2 A, shows that the effect of trypsin is limited, as discrete degradation fragments are formed. Moreover, only a small fraction of BS-RNase is cleaved by trypsin under the conditions employed. A fragment of about 20 kDa is detected first, which decreases at longer intervals of incubation time; then a smaller (17-kDa) product forms and accumulates. The same trypsin treatment on the isolated MxM and M=M forms produced identical patterns of products, but at faster rates, especially when the M=M form was tested (see Fig. 2, B and C). It has been shown previously that a 17-kDa product is the limit digest product for either MxM or M=M form after a prolonged treatment with trypsin (16.De Lorenzo C. Dal Piaz F. Piccoli R. Di Maro A. Pucci P. D'Alessio G. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2653-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The intriguing result of all these experiments is that most of the protein remains undigested, even after 2 h of treatment. Because the protein substrates were in large excess (45:1, mol/mol for the dimers; 90:1 for subunits), the possibility was investigated that the concentration of trypsin was limiting. However, identical results of a minimal fraction of protein being digested were obtained when the concentration of trypsin was increased 10-fold (data not shown). Another possibility was also considered: that in the BS-RNase equilibrium mixture, or in the isolated forms, only a preexisting fraction of each protein was a substrate for trypsin, and most of the proteins were resistant to digestion. But a prolonged incubation of BS-RNase under identical digestion conditions, illustrated in Fig.2 D, shows that all of the incubated protein would be digested eventually. These results led to the hypothesis that the real, limiting substrates of trypsin were not the MxM and the M=M forms, either isolated or in the BS-RNase equilibrium mixture, but kinetic intermediates generated from either form in the conversion processes, or equilibrium intermediates in BS-RNase, respectively. This hypothesis was tested by performing the experiment of form conversion on each isolated quaternary form in the presence and in the absence of trypsin. In the absence of trypsin (see Fig.3), each form slowly converted into the other as shown previously (11.Piccoli R. Tamburrini M. Piccialli G. Di Donato A. Parente A. D'Alessio G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). When trypsin was added to the proteins at zero time, very little or no conversion was detected of either form into the other (Fig. 3). This indicates that trypsin blocks at the start the MxM ⇔ M=M interconversion processes by degrading, hence removing, some susceptible conformers in which the two forms are converted as soon as they enter their respective conversion pathways. Hence neither form is a susceptible substrate as such, but their immediate intermediates in their respective conversion pathways are. These results can readily explain the low extent of tryptic degradation of the isolated forms and of equilibrium BS-RNase, illustrated in Fig.2. The MxM and the M=M forms are in excess to the protease, but their respective kinetic intermediates in which each isolated form converts are at low concentrations, hence limiting. The low concentrations of intermediates can in turn be dependent on the slow production of these intermediates from each quaternary form. As for the BS-RNase equilibrium mixture of forms, these intermediates would already be present and therefore susceptible to tryptic hydrolysis, but at low, limiting equilibrium concentrations. The kinetics of MxM or M=M depletion in the presence of trypsin was thus investigated. MxM and M=M forms (38 μm) were incubated separately for 0–21 h at 37 °C in Tris acetate, pH 8.4, with 0.9 μm trypsin. The kinetics data could be fitted to pseudo-first-order plots with satisfactory correlation coefficients (≥ 0.99), from which the rate constantsk MxM = 2.1 × 10−4min−1 and k M=M = 4.7 × 10−4 min−1 were determined for the MxM and the M=M form, respectively. These constants could be related to the rates of tryptic hydrolysis of the intermediate forms susceptible to tryptic attack or to the rate-limiting formation from the MxM and M=M forms of their respective intermediates. The latter interpretation appears as the only realistic one, based on the following considerations. (i) The rates measured for MxM and M=M are 2–3 orders of magnitude lower than those reported in the literature for tryptic hydrolysis of proteins, folded or unfolded (21.Noda Y. Fujiwara K.

Furthermore, when a preparation of S protein dissociated from S peptide was treated with trypsin under the same conditions employed for MxM and M=M, a value ofk hydrolysis = 1,240 × 10−4min−1 was measured. RNase S, the complex of fragments 1–20 (S peptide) and 21–124 (S protein), is generated by limited proteolysis of RNase A with subtilisin (23.Richards F.M. Vithayathil P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 1459-1465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The S protein thus isolated, in which the NH2-terminal arm is missing, is a close analog to a BS-RNase subunit in which the NH2-terminal arm has been dislocated. (ii) The rates were insensitive to increases of trypsin concentration (see above). (iii) The first peptide bond cleaved by trypsin (see below) is the same (Arg10-Gln11) when either MxM or M=M is subjected to tryptic degradation; this indicates that the microscopic substrate of trypsin is identical in either form when they are treated with trypsin. It can thus be concluded that the values of 4.7 and 2.1 × 10−4 min−1 are the rate constants of formation from the M=M and the MxM forms of their respective conformational intermediates. This conclusion, and specifically the slower formation of intermediate in MxM, hence its lower propensity to undergo a conformational change, is perfectly in line with the higher stability of MxM at equilibrium. In fact the ratiok M=M/k MxM of about 2.3 between the constants of formation of intermediates approximates the equilibrium ratio [MxM]/[M=M] of about 2 in the native protein (11.Piccoli R.

The action of trypsin on the isolated forms of BS-RNase was determined step by step by mass spectrometric analyses on homogeneous M=M or MxM forms (38 μm) digested with trypsin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The chronological sequence of tryptic cleavages was deduced from the identification of tryptic products on a time course basis. Aliquots of each incubation mixture were fractionated by RP-HPLC (see “Experimental Procedures”) before and after reduction of disulfides with dithiothreitol, followed by alkylation with iodoacetamide of the exposed sulfhydryls. The separated fragments were identified in the amino acid sequence of BS-RNase subunit by mass spectrometric analyses. In Table I the identified fragments are tabulated. At the shortest time interval (5 min) the molecular mass values of the large digestion products were not determined directly, as these products coeluted with undigested MxM or M=M. However, these values could be determined after reduction and alkylation of the intrachain and interchain disulfides of the fragments, and from the detection by MALDI-MS of the smaller excised fragments. Strikingly, at each time interval identical mass values were determined upon digestion of MxM or M=M, but after disulfide cleavage and sulfhydryl alkylation, different values for the identified fragments were obtained (see TableI).Table IElectrospray mass spectrometric identification of peptide fragments generated during tryptic hydrolysis of the quaternary forms of BS-RNase, MxM, and M=M, and of its monomeric derivative M-CmTimeMolecular massIdentificationMolecular mass (Red-Cam)aMolecular mass values of the peptides identified after selective reduction of disulfide bonds followed by sulfhydryl carboxyamidomethylation (Cam).IdentificationminMxM027,201.7(1–124)=(1′–124′)14,182.81–124 (10 Cam-CysbCarboxyamido-methylated (Cam) or carboxymethylated (Cm) cysteines.)51,135.8cPeptides detected by MALDI-MS analysis.1–1014,183.51–124 (10 Cam-CysbCarboxyamido-methylated (Cam) or carboxymethylated (Cm) cysteines.)13,063.911–124 (10 Cam-CysbCarboxyamido-methylated (Cam) or carboxymethylated (Cm) cysteines.)1520,641.5(11–124)=(1′–55′)-(81′–91′)13,064.311–124 (10 Cam-CysbCarboxyamido-methylated (Cam) or carboxymethylated (Cm) cysteines.)‖(92′–98′)6,342.21–55 (4 Cam-CysbCarboxyamido-methylated (Cam) or carboxymethylated (Cm) cysteines.)2,665.5(56′–61′)-(105′–124′)1,698.962′–76′2018,019.3(11–124)=(1′–39′)-(81′–91′)17,430.7(11–124)=(1′–39′)-(81′–85′)13,063.711–124 (10 Cam-CysbCarboxyamido-methylated (Cam) or carboxymethylated (Cm) cysteines.)4,516.21–39 (3 Cam-CysbCarboxyamido-methylated (Cam) or carboxymethylated (Cm) cysteines.)2,642.0(40′–55′)-(92′–98′)M=M027,201.3(1–124)=(1′–124′)14,183.01–124 (10 Cam-CysbCarboxyamido-methylated (Cam) or carboxymethylated (Cm) cysteines.)51,135.6cPeptides detected by MALDI-MS analysis.1′–10′14,182.91–124 (10 Cam-CysbCarboxyamido-methylated (Cam) or carboxymethylated (Cm) cysteines.)13,064.211–124 (10 Cam-CysbCarboxyamido-methylated (Cam) or carboxymethylated (Cm) cysteines.)1520,640.8(1–124)=(11′–55′)-(81′–91′)14,184.31–124 (10 Cam-CysbCarboxyamido-methylated (Cam) or carboxymethylated (Cm) cysteines.) ‖(92′–98′)5,224.411–55 (4 Cam-CysbCarboxyamido-methylated (Cam) or carboxymethylated (Cm) cysteines.)2,664.9(56′–61′)-(105′–124′)1,699.162′–76′2018,020.1(1–124)=(11′–39′)-(81′–91′)17,430.5(1–124)=(11′–39′)-(81′–85′)14,181.41–124 (10 Cam-CysbCarboxyamido-methylated (Cam) or carboxymethylated (Cm) cysteines.)3,396.811–39 (3 Cam-CysbCarboxyamido-methylated (Cam) or carboxymethylated (Cm) cysteines.)2,642.2(40′–55′)-(92′–98′)M-Cm013,716.41–124 (2 Cm-CysbCarboxyamido-methylated (Cam) or carboxymethylated (Cm) cysteines.)1011,104.8(1–55)-(62–104) (2 Cm-CysbCarboxyamido-methylated (Cam) or carboxymethylated (Cm) cysteines.)2,666.4cPeptides detected by MALDI-MS analysis.(56–61)-(105–124)201,135.8cPeptides detected by MALDI-MS analysis.1–106,484.3(11–33)-(81–98)-(40–55)1,699.062–76The NH2- and the COOH-terminal ends of the peptide fragments are indicated within parentheses when the fragments are linked by single or double disulfide bridges.

To distinguish the two subunits, the sequence positions of one of them are denoted with prime superscripts at the indicated sequence positions. The most relevant result is that for both forms the first tryptic nick, registered at 5 min, occurs at Arg10 of one of the subunits in each dimer. At 15 min only the nicked subunit in the M=M form, whereas only the intact subunit in the MxM form, is cleaved further at several sites. At 20 min the limit digest product of 17 kDa is generated for each form. These results clarify the previous finding (16.De Lorenzo C. Dal Piaz F. Piccoli R. Di Maro A. Pucci P. D'Alessio G. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2653-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) of a different limit digestion product for the two quaternary forms. The cleavage sites are identical in the two forms, but on different subunits, and cleavages occur in an identical time succession, thus the intermediate and final digestion products are not identical for the two forms. As shown in Fig. 1, F and G, in the M=M form after the first cut at Arg10, the attacked subunit is degraded progressively until only its 11–39 segment remains; this is linked by the intersubunit disulfides with the other subunit, which remains entirely resistant to trypsin. For the MxM form instead (Fig. 1,B and C) it is the nicked subunit, now missing peptide 1–10, which remains resistant to trypsin, whereas the partner subunit is degraded down to its 1–39 fragment, also linked to the partner chain by the intersubunit disulfides. These unequal degradation effects of trypsin on the two forms are entirely the result of the main structural feature of each form: the exchange (MxM) or lack of exchange (M=M) of the NH2-terminal arms between subunits. Upon scission of the Arg10-Gln11 bond, the proteolytic removal of the 1–10 arm in one subunit of the MxM form exposes most of the potentially susceptible tryptic sites in the partner subunit, whereas in the M=M form, the removal of the 1–10 arm exposes the available sites on the same nicked subunit. The finding that the tryptic cleavages occur (both in MxM and M=M) only in one subunit may appear surprising, but it is likely that the binding of one trypsin molecule to one Arg10 site in one subunit hinders the binding of a second trypsin molecule. A stably monomeric, enzymatically active derivative of seminal RNase (termed M-Cm) is obtained by selective reduction of its intersubunit disulfides followed by carboxymethylation with iodoacetic acid of the exposed sulfhydryls (18.D'Alessio G. Malorni M.C. Parente A. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 1116-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). When this monomeric derivative at a concentration of 36 μm was tested with trypsin (0.2 μm), it was found to be resistant under the conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”) in which trypsin was active on BS-RNase or on its isolated forms. When the trypsin concentration was increased to 0.8 μm, tryptic degradation of M-Cm was detected by mass spectrometric analyses, but with a succession of cleavages radically different from that registered for MxM or M=M (see Table I). The first detectable cleavage sites, as determined by mass spectrometric analyses after 10 min of incubation, were in the main body of the protein. They were generated by rapid and virtually simultaneous cuts at several sites, including those of lysine 55, 61, and 104. After a longer incubation, further cuts were revealed at arginine 80 and 33, and at lysine 98. The cleavage at arginine 33 is found only in the degradation of M-Cm and not in the dimeric forms of BS-RNase (see above). This is apparently because of its location at the surfaces hidden in the dimers at the intersubunit interface; these surfaces become exposed in the monomers. It may be surprising that a less stable form of BS-RNase, such as its monomeric derivative M-Cm (24.Catanzano F. Graziano G. Cafaro V. D'Alessio G. Di Donato A. Barone G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14403-14408Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 25.Grandi C. D'Alessio G. Fontana A. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3413-3420Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), is more resistant to trypsin than the more stable dimeric forms of the protein. The explanation for this apparent discrepancy can be found in the other more relevant result from these experiments: the lack of cleavage of the bond Arg10-Gln11 in the initial phase of tryptic digestion of M-Cm. We propose that the resistance of the M-Cm monomeric form of BS-RNase at lower trypsin concentrations is not caused by a higher stability of the monomer as a whole, but rather by a higher stability of the NH2-terminal arm, which is not dislocated as it occurs in the dimeric forms, hence it is not cleaved at Arg10. This conclusion is also supported by previous results (26.Parente A. Alb"
