https://openalex.org/W4306898301,"Background The increasing interest to perform and investigate the efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has generated an urge for feasible donor screening. We report our experience with stool donor recruitment, screening, follow-up, and associated costs in the context of clinical FMT trials. Methods Potential stool donors, aged between 18−65 years, underwent a stepwise screening process starting with an extensive questionnaire followed by feces and blood investigations. When eligible, donors were rescreened for MDROs and SARS-CoV-2 every 60-days, and full rescreening every 4−6 months. The costs to find and retain a stool donor were calculated. Results From January 2018 to August 2021, 393 potential donors underwent prescreening, of which 202 (51.4%) did not proceed primarily due to loss to follow-up, medication use, or logistic reasons (e.g. COVID-19 measures). 191 potential donors filled in the questionnaire, of which 43 (22.5%) were excluded. The remaining 148 candidates underwent parasitology screening: 91 (61.5%) were excluded, mostly due to Dientamoeba fragilis and/or high amounts of Blastocystis spp. After additional feces investigations 18/57 (31.6%) potential donors were excluded (mainly for presence of Helicobacter Pylori and ESBL-producing organisms). One donor failed serum testing. Overall, 38 out of 393 (10%) potential donors were enrolled. The median participation time of active stool donors was 13 months. To recruit 38 stool donors, €64.112 was spent. Conclusion Recruitment of stool donors for FMT is challenging. In our Dutch cohort, failed eligibility of potential donors was often caused by the presence of the protozoa Dientamoeba fragilis and Blastocystis spp.. The exclusion of potential donors that carry these protozoa, especially Blastocystis spp., is questionable and deserves reconsideration. High-quality donor screening is associated with substantial costs."
https://openalex.org/W4306898326,"Several studies confirm multiple complications after COVID-19 infection, including men's sexual health, which is caused by both physical and psychological factors. However, studies focusing on long-term effects among recovered patients are still lacking. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the erectile function at three months after COVID-19 recovery along with its predicting factors.We enrolled all COVID-19 male patients, who were hospitalized from May to July 2021, and declared to be sexually active within the previous two weeks. Demographic data, mental health status, and erectile function were collected at baseline and prospectively recollected three months after hospital discharge. To determine changes between baseline and the follow-up, a generalized linear mixed effect model (GLMM) was used. Also, logistic regression analysis was used to identify the associating factors of erectile dysfunction (ED) at three months.One hundred fifty-three men with COVID-19 participated. Using GLMM, ED prevalence at three months after recovery was 50.3%, which was significantly lower compared with ED prevalence at baseline (64.7%, P = 0.002). Declination of prevalence of major depression and anxiety disorder was found, but only major depression reached statistical significance (major depression 13.7% vs. 1.4%, P < 0.001, anxiety disorder 5.2% vs. 2.8% P = 0.22). Logistic regression, adjusted for BMI, medical comorbidities, and self-reported normal morning erection, showed a significant association between ED at three months and age above 40 years and diagnosis of major depression with adjusted OR of 2.65, 95% CI 1.17-6.01, P = 0.02 and 8.93, 95% CI 2.28-34.9, P = 0.002, respectively.Our study showed a high ED prevalence during the third month of recovery from COVID-19. The predicting factors of persistent ED were age over 40 years and diagnosis of major depression during acute infection."
https://openalex.org/W4306898463,"Leukotriene B 4 (LTB 4 ) is a potent lipid mediator involved in the recruitment and activation of neutrophils, which is an important feature of tissue injury and inflammation. The biological effects of LTB 4 are primarily mediated through the high-affinity LTB 4 receptor, BLT1. Postoperative incisional pain is characterized by persistent acute pain at the site of tissue injury and is associated with local inflammation. Here, we compared the role of LTB 4 -BLT1 signaling in postoperative incisional pain between BLT1-knockout (BLT1KO) and wild-type (BLT1WT) mice. A planter incision model was developed, and mechanical pain hypersensitivity was determined using the von Frey test before and after incision. Local infiltration of neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes was quantified by flow cytometry. Inflammatory cytokine levels in the incised tissue were also determined. Mechanical pain hypersensitivity was significantly reduced in BLT1KO mice compared to BLT1WT mice at 2, 3, and 4 days after incision. LTB 4 levels in the tissue at the incision site peaked 3 hours after the incision. Infiltrated neutrophils peaked 1 day after the incision in both BLT1KO and BLT1WT mice. The accumulation of inflammatory monocytes increased 1–3 days after the incision and was significantly more reduced in BLT1KO mice than in BLT1WT mice. In BLT1KO mice, Interleukin-1β and Tumor Necrosis Factor-α levels 1 day after the incision were significantly lower than those of BLT1WT mice. Our data suggest that LTB 4 is produced and activates its receptor BLT1 in the very early phase of tissue injury, and that LTB 4 -BLT1 signaling exacerbates pain responses by promoting local infiltration of inflammatory monocytes and cytokine production. Thus, LTB 4 -BLT1 signaling is a potential target for therapeutic intervention of acute and persistent pain induced by tissue injury."
https://openalex.org/W4306898369,"An ongoing debate in academic and practitioner communities, centers on the measurement similarities and differences between social vulnerability and community resilience. More specifically, many see social vulnerability and community resilience measurements as conceptually and empirically the same. Only through a critical and comparative assessment can we ascertain the extent to which these measurement schemas empirically relate to one another. This paper uses two well-known indices-the social vulnerability index (SoVI) and the Baseline Resilience Indicators for Communities (BRIC) to address the topic. The paper employs spatio-temporal correlations to test for differences or divergence (negative associations) and similarities or convergence (positive associations), and the degree of overlap. These tests use continental U.S. counties, two timeframes (2010 and 2015), and two case study sub-regions (to identify changes in measurement associations going from national to regional scales given the place-based nature of each index). Geospatial analytics indicate a divergence with little overlap between SoVI and BRIC measurements, based on low negative correlation coefficients (around 30%) for both time periods. There is some spatial variability in measurement overlap, but less than 2% of counties show hot spot clustering of correlations of more than 50% in either year. The strongest overlap and divergence in both years occurs in few counties in California, Arizona, and Maine. The degree of overlap in measurements at the regional scale is greater in the Gulf Region (39%) than in the Southeast Atlantic region (21% in 2010; 28% in 2015) suggesting more homogeneity in Gulf Coast counties based on population and place characteristics. However, in both study areas SoVI and BRIC measurements are negatively associated. Given their inclusion in the National Risk Index, both social vulnerability and resilience metrics are needed to interpret the local community capacities in natural hazards risk planning, as a vulnerable community could be highly resilient or vice versa."
https://openalex.org/W4306898411,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common gastrointestinal disorders and affects approximately 4% of the global population. The diagnosis of IBS can be made based on symptoms using the validated Rome criteria and ruling out commonly occurring organic diseases. Although biomarkers exist for “IBS mimickers” such as celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), no such test exists for IBS. DNA microarrays of colonic tissue have been used to identify disease-associated variants in other gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. In this study, our objective was to identify biomarkers and unique gene expression patterns that may define the pathological state of IBS. Mucosal tissue samples were collected from the sigmoid colon of 29 participants (11 IBS and 18 healthy controls). DNA microarray analysis was used to assess gene expression profiling. Extraction and purification of RNA were then performed and used to synthesize cDNA. Reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was employed to identify differentially expressed genes in patients diagnosed with IBS compared to healthy, non-IBS patient-derived cDNA. Additional testing probed vitamin D-mediated regulation of select genes associated with serotonergic metabolism. DNA microarray analyses led to the identification of 858 differentially expressed genes that may characterize the IBS pathological state. After screening a series of genes using a combination of gene ontological analysis and RT-qPCR, this spectrum of potential IBS biomarkers was narrowed to 23 genes, some of which are regulated by vitamin D. Seven putative IBS biomarkers, including genes involved in serotonin metabolism, were identified. This work further supports the hypothesis that IBS pathophysiology is evident within the human transcriptome and that vitamin D modulates differential expression of genes in IBS patients. This suggests that IBS pathophysiology may also involve vitamin D deficiency and/or an irregularity in serotonin metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W4306898435,"Some children born to adolescent mothers may have developmental challenges, while others do not. Research focusing on which children of adolescent mothers are at the highest risk for cognitive delay is still required. Both maternal HIV status and maternal mental health may affect child development. An examination of maternal mental health, especially in the presence of maternal HIV infection may be timely. This study explores the relationship between the mental health of adolescent mothers (comparing those living with and not living with HIV) and the cognitive development performance scores of their children. Additional possible risk and protective factors for poor child development are explored to identify those children born to adolescent mothers who may be at the greatest risk of poor cognitive development.Cross-sectional data utilised within the analyses was drawn from a large cohort of adolescent mothers and their children residing in South Africa. Detailed study questionnaires were completed by adolescent mothers relating to their self and their child and, standardised cognitive assessments were completed by trained researchers for all children using in the Mullen Scales of Early Learning. Chi-square, t-tests (Kruskal Wallis tests, where appropriate), and ANOVA were used to explore sample characteristics and child cognitive development scores by maternal mental health status (operationalised as likely common mental disorder) and combined maternal mental health and HIV status. Multivariable linear regression models were used to explore the relationship between possible risk factors (including poor maternal mental health and HIV) and, child cognitive development scores.The study included 954 adolescent mothers; 24.1% (230/954) were living with HIV, 12.6% (120/954) were classified as experiencing likely common mental disorder. After adjusting for covariates, maternal HIV was found to be associated with reduced child gross motor scores (B = -2.90 [95%CI: -5.35, -0.44], p = 0.02), however, no other associations were identified between maternal likely common mental disorder, or maternal HIV status (including interaction terms), and child cognitive development scores. Sensitivity analyses exploring individual maternal mental health scales identified higher posttraumatic stress symptomology scores as being associated with lower child cognitive development scores. Sensitivity analyses exploring potential risk and protective factors for child cognitive development also identified increased maternal educational attainment as being protective of child development scores, and increased child age as a risk factor for lower development scores.This study addresses a critical evidence gap relating to the understanding of possible risk factors for the cognitive development of children born to adolescent mothers affected by HIV. This group of mothers experience a complex combination of risk factors, including HIV, likely common mental disorder, and structural challenges such as educational interruption. Targeting interventions to support the cognitive development of children of adolescent mothers most at risk may be of benefit. Clearly a basket of interventions needs to be considered, such as the integration of mental health provision within existing services, identifying multiple syndemics of risk, and addressing educational and structural challenges, all of which may boost positive outcomes for both the mother and the child."
https://openalex.org/W4306898497,"The maturity and commercialization of emerging digital technologies represented by artificial intelligence, cloud computing, block chain and virtual reality are giving birth to a new and higher economic form, that is, digital economy. Digital economy is different from the traditional industrial economy. It is clean, efficient, green and recyclable. It represents and promotes the future direction of global economic development, especially in the context of the sudden COVID-19 pandemic as a continuing disaster. Therefore, it is essential to establish the comprehensive evaluation model of digital economy development scientifically and reasonably. In this paper, first on the basis of literature analysis, the relevant indicators of digital economy development are collected manually and then screened by the grey dynamic clustering and rough set reduction theory. The evaluation index system of digital economy development is constructed from four dimensions: digital innovation impetus support, digital infrastructure construction support, national economic environment and digital policy guarantee, digital integration and application. Next the subjective weight and objective weight are calculated by the group FAHP method, entropy method and improved CRITIC method, and the combined weight is integrated with the thought of maximum variance. The grey correlation analysis and improved VIKOR model are combined to systematically evaluate the digital economy development level of 31 provinces and cities in China from 2013 to 2019. The results of empirical analysis show that the overall development of China's digital economy shows a trend of superposition and rise, and the development of digital economy in the four major economic zones is unbalanced. Finally, we put forward targeted opinions on the construction of China's provincial digital economy."
https://openalex.org/W4306898512,"Many vertebrate species undergo population fluctuations that may be random or regularly cyclic in nature. Vertebrate population cycles in northern latitudes are driven by both endogenous and exogenous factors. Suggested causes of mysterious disappearances documented for populations of the Neotropical, herd-forming, white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari, henceforth ""WLP"") include large-scale movements, overhunting, extreme floods, or disease outbreaks. By analyzing 43 disappearance events across the Neotropics and 88 years of commercial and subsistence harvest data for the Amazon, we show that WLP disappearances are widespread and occur regularly and at large spatiotemporal scales throughout the species' range. We present evidence that the disappearances represent 7-12-year troughs in 20-30-year WLP population cycles occurring synchronously at regional and perhaps continent-wide spatial scales as large as 10,000-5 million km2. This may represent the first documented case of natural population cyclicity in a Neotropical mammal. Because WLP populations often increase dramatically prior to a disappearance, we posit that their population cycles result from over-compensatory, density-dependent mortality. Our data also suggest that the increase phase of a WLP cycle is partly dependent on recolonization from proximal, unfragmented and undisturbed forests. This highlights the importance of very large, continuous natural areas that enable source-sink population dynamics and ensure re-colonization and local population persistence in time and space."
https://openalex.org/W4306896979,"Biophysical models are a powerful tool for assessing population connectivity of marine organisms that broadcast spawn. Albula vulpes is a species of bonefish that is an economically and culturally important sportfish found throughout the Caribbean and that exhibits genetic connectivity among geographically distant populations. We created ontogenetically relevant biophysical models for bonefish larval dispersal based upon multiple observed spawning events in Abaco, The Bahamas in 2013, 2018, and 2019. Biological parameterizations were informed through active acoustic telemetry, CTD casts, captive larval rearing, and field collections of related albulids and anguillids. Ocean conditions were derived from the Regional Navy Coastal Ocean Model American Seas dataset. Each spawning event was simulated 100 times using the program Ichthyop. Ten-thousand particles were released at observed and putative spawning locations and were allowed to disperse for the full 71-day pelagic larval duration for A. vulpes. Settlement densities in defined settlement zones were assessed along with interactions with oceanographic features. The prevailing Northern dispersal paradigm exhibited strong connectivity with Grand Bahama, the Berry Islands, Andros, and self-recruitment to lower and upper Abaco. Ephemeral gyres and flow direction within Northwest and Northeast Providence Channels were shown to have important roles in larval retention to the Bahamian Archipelago. Larval development environments for larvae settling upon different islands showed few differences and dispersal was closely associated with the thermocline. Settlement patterns informed the suggestion for expansion of conservation parks in Grand Bahama, Abaco, and Andros, and the creation of a parks in Eleuthera and the Berry Islands to protect fisheries. Further observation of spawning events and the creation of biophysical models will help to maximize protection for bonefish spawning locations and nursery habitat, and may help to predict year-class strength for bonefish stocks throughout the Greater Caribbean."
https://openalex.org/W4306897071,"In recent research of culture and ethnicity in visual perception, some researchers have found support for the hypothesis that more collectivistic cultures tend to be more influenced by surrounding contextual visual information than more individualistic cultures. This hypothesis suggests that even low-level visual perception may not be universal and has great implications on how vision research should be conducted. The current study reexamines this hypothesis in the rod and frame task, which tests the influence of a tilted contextual frame on orientation perception of the rod. We found no difference between participants of East Asian and Western European descent in this task. Despite not finding the cultural effect, we found a well-reported gender effect in which women were more influenced by the tilt of the frame than men, helping to ensure the quality of the data collected. Our results suggest that contextual influence on visual perception does not affect East Asians and white Western Europeans differently."
https://openalex.org/W4306898274,"The identification of ancient worked materials is one of the fundamental goals of lithic use wear analysis and one of the most important parts of understanding how stone tools were used in the past. Given the documented overlaps in wear patterns generated by different materials, it is imperative to understand how individual materials’ mechanical properties might influence wear formation. Because isolating physical parameters and measuring their change is necessary for such an endeavor, controlled (rather than replicative) experiments combined with objective measurements of surface topography are necessary to better grasp how surface modifications formed on stone tools. Therefore, we used a tribometer to wear natural flint surfaces against five materials (bone, antler, beech wood, spruce wood, and ivory) under the same force, and speed, over one, three, and five hours. The study aimed to test if there is a correlation between surface modifications and the hardness of the worked material. We measured each raw material’s hardness using a nano-indentation test, and we compared the surface texture of the flint bits using a 3D optical profilometer. The interfacial detritus powder was analyzed with a scanning electron microscope to look for abraded flint particles. We demonstrate that, contrary to expectation, softer materials, such as wood, create a smoother surface than hard ones, such as ivory."
https://openalex.org/W4306898331,"As an important measure to enhance the allocation of land resources and achieve moderate scale operation in China, land transfer has an irreplaceable role in giving full play to the social and economic value of land. This paper uses data from the China Family Panel Studies in 2018 and applies OLS, PSM and mediator effects to study the impact of land transfer on household income. The results of the study show that: firstly, participation in land transfer can significantly increase the income level of farming households, but the impact of different land transfer acts on household income varies. Secondly, the age and physical condition of the household head, the number of agricultural and non-agricultural members in the household and the poverty status of the household all have a negative effect on household income. On the other hand, the education level of the household head, the household size and the presence of village officials in the household, agricultural subsidies, land titling and land size all have a positive effect on household income. Thirdly, the impact on household income for households that did not participate in land transfer is greater than for those that did. The results of the mediator effect test show that land transfer has a significant effect on household farm income, and that farm income has a full mediator effect, but all have a positive significant effect on household income."
https://openalex.org/W4306898429,"Background Falls and fall-related injuries in older adults are a leading cause of disability and death. Evidence has shown the benefits of exercises in improving functional outcomes and reducing fall rates among community-dwelling older adults. However, there is lack of effective community-based single exercise intervention for a broad population of older adults who are at high risk for falls. We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of Steady Feet (SF), a 6-month tailored community fall prevention exercise programme for improving functional outcomes. SF classes are facilitated by community fitness instructors and an exercise video. The main outcome is between-group changes in short physical performance battery (SPPB) scores. Secondary outcomes include balance confidence, fear of falling, quality of life, fall rates, and cost effectiveness. Methods We present the design of a 6-month randomised controlled trial of 260 older adults (≥ 60 years old). Individuals will be randomised in a 1:1 allocation ratio to the SF group or usual care group. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 3-month, and 6-month. Data on socio-demographics, co-morbidities, balance confidence, fear of falling, quality of life, physical activity level, rate of perceived exertion, fall(s) history, healthcare utilisation and cost, and satisfaction levels will be collected. Participants will also undergo functional assessments such as SPPB. Moreover, providers’ satisfaction and feedback will be obtained at 3-month. Discussion An effective community fall prevention programme may lead to improved functional outcomes and reduced fall rates. Findings will also help inform the implementation and scaling of SF nation-wide. Trial registration Clinicaltrials.gov registration: NCT04801316 . Registered on 15 th March 2021."
https://openalex.org/W4306898439,"Background Tetanus occurring during pregnancy is still an important cause of maternal and neonatal mortality in developing countries. This study estimated the trend of tetanus toxoid (TT) immunization coverage from 2006 to 2019 in Bangladesh, considering socio-demographic, socio-economic, and geospatial characteristics. Methods The dataset used in this study was extracted from Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (2006, 2012–13, and 2019) including 28,734 women aged between 15–49 years. Data analysis was performed using cross-tabulation and logistic regression methods. Further, the spatial distribution of TT immunization coverage was also depicted. Results The trend of TT immunization (81.8% in 2006 to 49.3% in 2019) and that of taking adequate doses of TT (67.1% in 2006 to 49.9% in 2019) has gradually decreased throughout the study period. Among the administrative districts, North and South-West regions had lower coverage, and South and West regions had relatively higher coverage of both TT immunization and that of adequate doses. Antenatal TT immunization (any dosage, inadequate or adequate) was significantly associated with lower age (AOR = 3.13, 1.55–6.34), higher education (AOR = 1.20, 1.03–1.40), living in urban areas (AOR = 1.17, 1.03–1.34), having immunization card (AOR = 5.19, 4.50–5.98), using government facilities for birth (AOR = 1.41, 1.06–1.88), and receiving antenatal care (ANC) (AOR = 1.51, 1.35–1.69). In addition, living in urban areas (AOR = 1.31, 1.10–1.55), having immunization cards (AOR = 1.62, 1.36–1.92), and choosing others’ homes for birth (AOR = 1.37, 1.07–1.74) were significantly associated with adequate TT immunization. However, higher education (AOR = 0.57, 0.44–0.74), having poor wealth index (AOR = 0.65, 0.50–0.83), and receiving ANC (AOR = 0.76, 0.63–0.92) had lower likelihood of taking adequate TT immunization. Conclusions The gradual decline in the TT immunization rate in the present study suggests the presence of variable rates and unequal access to TT immunization, demanding more effective public health programs focusing on high-risk groups to ensure adequate TT immunization."
https://openalex.org/W4306898444,"A phylogeographic analysis of A. agrarius based on the complete mtDNA cytochrome b and control region sequences has been performed using data obtained for the first time for the species from large regions of the central part of Northern Eurasia (23 localities of Altai, Western Siberia, and the Urals). The obtained results have demonstrated a complex intraspecific differentiation of A. agrarius, which has manifested not only in the isolation of the isles populations in Southeast Asia (Jeju and Taiwan), but also in the genetic heterogeneity of mainland populations, which has reflected the history of the modern intraspecific genetic diversity formation against the background of changing physiographic conditions of Eurasia in the Quaternary. The divergence of genetic lineages has taken place apparently simultaneously (in mid-Pleistocene) on the territory of the Eastern part of the modern disjunctive range, where all the identified lineages are present today. The demographic history and possible evolutionary scenarios for A. agrarius in the Western part of the range have been considered. TMRC reconstructions have shown that the lifetime of the common ancestor of the lineage that expanded in the Western Palearctic is about 17.7 [95% HPD 13.2-22.5] kyr. This suggests that the transcontinental expansion of A. agrarius is a relatively recent event that has occurred after the LGM."
https://openalex.org/W4306898457,"Bladder cancer (BCa) is the second most common genitourinary cancer and among the leading causes of cancer-related deaths. We aimed to assess BCa quality of care (QOC) utilizing a novel multi-variable quality of care index (QCI).Data were retrieved from the Global Burden of Disease 1990-2019 database. QCI scores were calculated using four indices of prevalence-to-incidence ratio, Disability-Adjusted Life Years-to-prevalence ratio, mortality-to-incidence ratio, and Years of Life Lost-to-Years Lived with Disability ratio. We used principal component analysis to allocate 0-100 QCI scores based on region, age groups, year, and gender.Global burden of BCa is on the rise with 524,305 (95% UI 475,952-569,434) new BCa cases and 228,735 (95% UI 210743-243193) deaths in 2019, but age-standardized incidence and mortality rates did not increase. Global age-standardized QCI improved from 75.7% in 1990 to 80.9% in 2019. The European and African regions had the highest and lowest age-standardized QCI of 89.7% and 37.6%, respectively. Higher Socio-demographic index (SDI) quintiles had better QCI scores, ranging from 90.1% in high SDI to 30.2% in low SDI countries in 2019; however, 5-year QCI improvements from 2014 to 2019 were 0.0 for high and 4.7 for low SDI countries.The global QCI increased in the last 30 years, but the gender disparities remained relatively unchanged despite substantial improvements in several regions. Higher SDI quintiles had superior QOC and less gender- and age-based inequalities compared to lower SDI countries. We encourage countries to implement the learned lessons and improve their QOC shortcomings."
https://openalex.org/W4306898509,"The effects of the FIFA11+ programme (the 11+) on ankle and groin injuries and performance have remained questionable. The latter, particularly, has potentially reduced the implementation rate and applicability of the programme. This study aimed to evaluate the mid-to-long-term effects of the 11+ and a modified programme including football-specific exercises on injury prevention and performance improvement.Three teams of the Iranian Youth League (division two) volunteered to participate in this study and were randomly assigned to two intervention groups (F11+; n = 29, M11+; n = 31) and a control group (n = 30). The F11+ followed the FIFA 11+ programme, whereas the M11+ performed modified exercises three times weekly as a warm-up protocol before training and competition through a football season. The control group carried out its routine warm-ups, including joggings, basic football drills, and static stretches, while having no injury prevention approaches. Lower extremity injuries, as well as exposure time for each player, were recorded. The football-specific performance was assessed using the Illinois Agility and Slalom Dribbling tests. ANOVA, Fisher Freeman Halton, and chi-square tests were used to analyze the data.Injury incidences differed significantly between groups (p = 0.02, C = 0.40), with M11+ reporting the lowest incidence. Significant differences between the pre- and posttest as well as differences between the groups for development over time were revealed for the Illinois agility and dribbling speed (p≤0.01). Both performance tests demonstrated a large time effect, as the effect sizes for time in agility and dribbling speed were 0.74 (CI = [0.66; 0.79]) and 0.86 (CI = [0.79; 0.87]), respectively. The effect size for the interaction can be categorized as medium, with 0.38 (CI = [0.25; 0.49]) for agility and 0.52 (CI = [0.40; 0.61]) for dribbling speed. M11+ showed the largest improvement in both.Mid-to-long-term application of a structured dynamic warm-up that integrates injury prevention and performance approaches may lower injury incidences and improve youth subelite players' performance. Although additional studies with larger samples are needed to prove the results of the current study, the amateur clubs/teams could integrate such twofold dynamic warm up into their routine training plan and benefit its advantages on injury prevention and performance improvement."
https://openalex.org/W4306898511,"White blood cells (WBCs) play a vital role in the diagnosis of many blood diseases. Such diagnosis is based on the morphological analysis of blood microscopic images which is performed manually by skilled hematologist. However, this method has many drawbacks, such as the dependence on the hematologist's skill, slow performance, and varying accuracy. Therefore, in the current study, a new optical method for discrimination between normal and cancer WBCs of peripheral blood film (PBF) images is presented. This method is based on holographic projection technique which is able to provide an accurate and fast optical reconstruction method of WBCs floating in the air. Besides, it can provide a 3D visualization map of one WBC with its characterization parameters from only a single 2D hologram. To achieve that, at first, WBCs are accurately segmented from the microscopic PBF images using a developed in-house MATLAB code. Then, their associated phase computer-generated holograms (CGHs) are calculated using the well-known iterative Fourier transform algorithm (IFTA). Within the utilized algorithm, a speckle noise reduction technique, based on temporal multiplexing of spatial frequencies, is applied to minimize the speckle noise across the reconstruction plane. Additionally, a special hologram modulation is added to the calculated holograms to provide a 3D visualization map of one WBC, and discriminate normal and cancer WBCs. Finally, the calculated phase-holograms are uploaded on a phase-only spatial light modulator (SLM) for optical reconstruction. The optical reconstruction of such phase-holograms yields precise representation of normal and cancer WBCs. Moreover, a 3D visualization map of one WBC with its characterization parameters is provided. Therefore, the proposed technique can be used as a valuable tool for interpretation and analysis of WBCs, this in turn could provide an improvement in diagnosis and prognosis of blood diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4306897072,"Purpose The 2021 World Health Organization classification includes telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter (TERT p ) mutation status as a factor for differentiating meningioma grades. Therefore, preoperative prediction of TERTp mutation may assist in clinical decision making. However, no previous study has applied fractal analysis for TERTp mutation status prediction in meningiomas. The purpose of this study was to assess the utility of three-dimensional (3D) fractal analysis for predicting the TERTp mutation status in grade 2 meningiomas. Methods Forty-eight patients with surgically confirmed grade 2 meningiomas (41 TERTp-wildtype and 7 TERTp-mutant) were included. 3D fractal dimension (FD) and lacunarity values were extracted from the fractal analysis. A predictive model combining clinical, conventional, and fractal parameters was built using logistic regression analysis. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to assess the ability of the model to predict TERTp mutation status. Results Patients with TERTp-mutant grade 2 meningiomas were older (P = 0.029) and had higher 3D FD (P = 0.026) and lacunarity (P = 0.004) values than patients with TERTp-wildtype grade 2 meningiomas. On multivariable logistic analysis, higher 3D FD values (odds ratio = 32.50, P = 0.039) and higher 3D lacunarity values (odds ratio = 20.54, P = 0.014) were significant predictors of TERTp mutation status. The area under the curve, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the multivariable model were 0.84 (95% confidence interval 0.71–0.93), 83.3%, 71.4%, and 85.4%, respectively. Conclusion 3D FD and lacunarity may be useful imaging biomarkers for predicting TERTp mutation status in grade 2 meningiomas."
https://openalex.org/W4306898340,"Eusociality, where workers typically forfeit their own reproduction to assist their mothers in raising siblings, is a fundamental paradox in evolutionary biology. By sacrificing personal reproduction, helpers pay a significant cost, which must be outweighed by indirect fitness benefits of helping to raise siblings. In 1983, Jon Seger developed a model showing how in the haplodiploid Hymenoptera (ants, wasps and bees), a partially bivoltine life cycle with alternating sex ratios may have promoted the evolution of eusociality. Seger predicted that eusociality would be more likely to evolve in hymenopterans where a foundress produces a male-biased first brood sex ratio and a female-biased second brood. This allows first brood females to capitalize on super-sister relatedness through helping to produce the female-biased second brood. In Seger’s model, the key factor driving alternating sex ratios was that first brood males survive to mate with females of both the second and the first brood, reducing the reproductive value of second brood males. Despite being potentially critical in the evolution of eusociality, however, male survivorship has received little empirical attention. Here, we tested whether first brood males survive across broods in the facultatively eusocial sweat bee Halictus rubicundus . We obtained high estimates of survival and, while recapture rates were low, at least 10% of first brood males survived until the second brood. We provide empirical evidence supporting Seger’s model. Further work, measuring brood sex ratios and comparing abilities of first and second brood males to compete for fertilizations, is required to fully parameterize the model."

Studies have examined the duration of screen use and screen-based activities but have not differentiated between evening and night-time use.Cross sectional questionnaire survey of adolescents recruited in schools. Sleep habits on school nights and weekends, symptoms of insomnia and daytime repercussions were recorded using an online questionnaire administered in the classroom setting. Sleep deprivation (<7 hours in bed /night), school night sleep restriction (≥2 hours difference in sleep duration on school nights vs weekends), excessive sleepiness (score >6 on a visual analogue scale), duration of screen use and timing of screen use (evening vs after bedtime) were determined.2513 students (53.4% female, median age 15 years) were included. 20% were sleep deprived and 41% sleep restricted. A clear dose effect relationship in a model controlling for age, sex, school level and sociodemographic class was seen with all levels of night-time screen use on sleep deprivation and sleep restriction (>2 hours use sleep deprivation OR 5.23[3.03-9.00]. sleep restriction OR 2.05[1.23-3.42]) and > 2 hours evening use (>2 hours use sleep deprivation OR 2.72[2.15-3.44] sleep restriction OR 1.69[1.36-2.11]) but not moderate evening use. All night-time use and > 2 hours evening use increased the risk of insomnia, non refreshing sleep, and affected daytime function (daytime sleepiness, lack of energy and irritability).Both duration of screen use and timing are associated with adverse effects on sleep and daytime functioning in adolescents. More than 2 hours evening use and all night-time use should be avoided."
https://openalex.org/W4306898355,"Several mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroup association studies have suggested that common mtDNA variants are associated with multifactorial diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, such studies have also produced conflicting results. A new mtDNA association model, the 'variant load model' (VLM), has been applied to multiple disease phenotypes. Application of the VLM in a 2017 study failed to find different variant loads in AD patients compared to controls, in two cohorts of European origin. The study also suggested a lower variant load in healthy elderly individuals, but could offer no replicate cohort to support this observation. Here, the VLM is applied to Japanese mtDNA sequences; in doing so, we explored the role of mtDNA variation in AD and ageing in a different global population. Consistent with the previous findings using the VLM in two populations of European origin, we found no evidence for an association between rarer, non-haplogroup associated variation and the development of AD. However, the result in the context of ageing that suggested those with fewer mildly deleterious mutations might undergo healthier ageing, was not replicated. In contrast to our previous study, our present results suggest that those living to advanced old age may harbour more mildly deleterious mtDNA variations. Importantly our analysis showed this finding is not primarily being driven by many rare population variants dispersed across the mtDNA, but by a few more frequent variants with high MutPred scores. It is suggested the variants in question do not exert a mildly deleterious effect in their most frequent haplogroup context."
https://openalex.org/W4306898359,"Fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) has been reported to be associated with tumor progress and poor prognosis in various cancers. However, the relationship between FABP4 expression and tumor immunity in colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) is still poorly understood.FABP4 mRNA expression was analyzed using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-COAD data. FABP4 protein staining was performed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining in our 10 paired COAD samples and corresponding adjacent noncancerous tissues. The association between FABP4 and immune cell infiltration was evaluated by Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) database. FABP4 coexpressed genes were identified based on Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) database, which were employed for further enrichment analysis. FABP4 related immunomodulators was identified by Tumor and Immune System Interaction Database (TISIDB) database, and a prognostic risk signature was constructed based on FABP4-related immunomodulators using stepwise Cox regression analysis. A nomogram consists of FABP4 related immunomodulators signature and clinical parameters was developed to predict the overall survival (OS).In TCGA data, we found that the decreased FABP4 mRNA expression in COAD samples compared with normal samples, and low FABP4 mRNA expression was associated with B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, myeloid dendritic cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. In our 10 paired samples, the protein levels of COAD were lower in all COAD tissues than in their adjacent noncancerous tissues. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that FABP4 coexpressed genes were mostly enriched in immune-related pathways. Based on 54 FABP4-related immunomodulators, a 2-gene FABP4-related prognostic risk signature was developed, and the signature stratified the patients into the high-risk and low-risk groups with statistically different survival outcomes. The Nomogram consists of the prognostic signature and clinical parameters had a certain predictability for prognosis of COAD patients.These findings suggest that FABP4 is associated with 2-gene immune signature which also correlate with the prognosis of COAD patients."
https://openalex.org/W4306898364,"Objectives We sought to examine readmission rates and predictors of hospital readmission following TAVR in patients with ESRD. Background End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is associated with poor outcomes following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Methods We assessed index hospitalizations for TAVR from the National Readmissions Database from 2017 to 2018 and used propensity scores to match those with and without ESRD. We compared 90-day readmission for any cause or cardiovascular cause. Length of stay (LOS), mortality, and cost were assessed for index hospitalizations and 90-day readmissions. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify predictors of 90-day readmission. Results We identified 49,172 index hospitalizations for TAVR, including 1,219 patients with ESRD (2.5%). Patient with ESRD had higher rates of all-cause readmission (34.4% vs. 19.2%, HR 1.96, 95% CI 1.68–2.30, p&lt;0.001) and cardiovascular readmission (13.2% vs. 7.7%, HR 1.85, 95% CI 1.44–2.38, p&lt;0.001) at 90 days. During index hospitalization, patients with ESRD had longer length of stay (mean difference 1.9 days), increased hospital cost (mean difference $42,915), and increased in-hospital mortality (2.6% vs. 0.9%). Among those readmitted within 90 days, patients with ESRD had longer LOS and increased hospital charge, but similar in-hospital mortality. Diabetes (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.31–2.64) and chronic pulmonary disease (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.04–2.18) were independently associated with higher odds of 90-day readmission in patients with ESRD. Conclusion Patients with ESRD undergoing TAVR have higher mortality and increased cost associated with their index hospitalization and are at increased risk of readmission within 90 days following TAVR."

To date, there has been little research on resilience factors preventing people with SMI from experiencing negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of perceived empowerment (PE) as a resilience factor, preventing people with SMI from experiencing negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on daily living.We investigated negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on daily living in 931 persons with SMI at two times within six month between June 2020 and Mai 2021. To take into account the longitudinal structure of the data we applied mixed effects regression analyses and longitudinal path models.A majority of participants experienced negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on several dimensions of daily living. Negative effects increased with rising levels of illness-related impairment but decreased as the level of PE rose. While negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic at follow-up were negatively associated with overall subjective quality of life baseline, PE was negatively associated with the negative impact of the pandemic and positively with quality of life.Patients with SMI need support to reduce negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on their quality of life.

https://openalex.org/W4306898373,"P5A ATPases are expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of all eukaryotic cells, and their disruption results in pleiotropic phenotypes related to severe ER stress. They were recently proposed to function in peptide translocation although their specificity have yet to be confirmed in reconstituted assays using the purified enzyme. A general theme for P-type ATPases is that binding and transport of substrates is coupled to hydrolysis of ATP in a conserved allosteric mechanism, however several independent reports have shown purified Spf1p to display intrinsic spontaneous ATP hydrolytic activity after purification. It has never been determined to what extend this spontaneous activity is caused by uncoupling of the enzyme. In this work we have purified a functional tagged version of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae P5A ATPase Spf1p and have observed that the intrinsic ATP hydrolytic activity of the purified and re-lipidated protein can be stimulated by specific detergents (C12E8, C12E10 and Tween20) in mixed lipid/detergent micelles in the absence of any apparent substrate. We further show that this increase in activity correlate with the reaction temperature and the anisotropic state of the mixed lipid/detergent micelles and further that this correlation relies on three highly conserved phenylalanine residues in M1. This suggests that at least part of the intrinsic ATP hydrolytic activity is allosterically coupled to movements in the TM domain in the purified preparations. It is suggested that free movement of the M1 helix represent an energetic constraint on catalysis and that this constraint likely is lost in the purified preparations resulting in protein with intrinsic spontaneous ATP hydrolytic activity. Removal of the N-terminal part of the protein apparently removes this activity."
https://openalex.org/W4306898380,"Electronic fetal monitoring alone is a poor screening test for detecting fetuses at risk of acidemia or asphyxia. We aimed to evaluation of predictive ability of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) 3-tier fetal heart rate (FHR) system combined with the maternal, obstetric, and fetal risk factors for predicting perinatal acidemia, and to compare this with the predictive of the NICHD 3-tier system alone, and the Fetal Reserve Index (FRI).A retrospective cohort study was conducted among singleton term pregnant women. Fetal heart rate tracings of the last two hours before delivery were interpreted into the NICHD 3-tier FHR classification system by two experienced obstetricians. Demographic data were compared using the χ2 or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and the Student's t test for continuous variables. Logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with perinatal acidemia in neonates. The Odds ratios (OR) and probabilities with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.A total of 674 pregnant women were enrolled in this study. Using the NICHD 3-tier FHR categories I and II combined with the selected risk factors (AUC 0.62) had a better performance for perinatal acidemia prediction than the NICHD 3-tier FHR alone (AUC 0.55) and the FRI (AUC 0.52), (P<0.01). Improvement of predicting perinatal acidemia was found when NICHD category I was combined with preeclampsia or arrest disorders of labor (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.30‒7.82) or combined with abnormal second stage of labor (OR 6.19, 95% CI 1.07‒36.06) and when NICHD category II was combined with meconium-stained amniotic fluid (OR 4.73, 95% CI 2.17‒10.31).The NICHD 3-tier FHR categories I or II combined with selected risk factors can improve the predictive ability of perinatal acidemia in neonates compared with the NICHD 3-tier system alone or the FRI."
https://openalex.org/W4306898462,"Dengue, Zika and chikungunya viruses cause significant human public health burdens in the world. These arboviruses are transmitted by vector mosquito species notably Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. In the Pacific region, more vector species of arboviruses belonging to the Scutellaris Group are present. Due to the expansion of human travel and international trade, the threat of their dispersal in other world regions is on the rise. Strengthening of entomological surveillance ensuring rapid detection of introduced vector species is therefore required in order to avoid their establishment and the risk of arbovirus outbreaks. This surveillance relies on accurate species identification. The aim of this study was to assess the use of the Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) as a tool for an international identification and surveillance of these mosquito vectors of arboviruses. Field-mosquitoes belonging to 8 species (Ae. aegypti, Ae. albopictus, Aedes polynesiensis, Aedes scutellaris, Aedes pseudoscutellaris, Aedes malayensis, Aedes futunae and Culex quinquefasciatus) from 6 countries in the Pacific, Asian and Madagascar, were included in this study. Analysis provided evidence that a MALDI-TOF database created using mosquitoes from the Pacific region allowed suitable identification of mosquito species from the other regions. This technic was as efficient as the DNA sequencing method in identifying mosquito species. Indeed, with the exception of two Ae. pseudoscutellaris, an exact species identification was obtained for all individual mosquitoes. These findings highlight that the MALDI-TOF MS is a promising tool that could be used for a global comprehensive arbovirus vector surveillance."

https://openalex.org/W4306898535,"To determine whether modified K-12 student quarantine policies that allow some students to continue in-person education during their quarantine period increase schoolwide SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk following the increase in cases in winter 2020-2021.We conducted a prospective cohort study of COVID-19 cases and close contacts among students and staff (n = 65,621) in 103 Missouri public schools. Participants were offered free, saliva-based RT-PCR testing. The projected number of school-based transmission events among untested close contacts was extrapolated from the percentage of events detected among tested asymptomatic close contacts and summed with the number of detected events for a projected total. An adjusted Cox regression model compared hazard rates of school-based SARS-CoV-2 infections between schools with a modified versus standard quarantine policy.From January-March 2021, a projected 23 (1%) school-based transmission events occurred among 1,636 school close contacts. There was no difference in the adjusted hazard rates of school-based SARS-CoV-2 infections between schools with a modified versus standard quarantine policy (hazard ratio = 1.00; 95% confidence interval: 0.97-1.03).School-based SARS-CoV-2 transmission was rare in 103 K-12 schools implementing multiple COVID-19 prevention strategies. Modified student quarantine policies were not associated with increased school incidence of COVID-19. Modifications to student quarantine policies may be a useful strategy for K-12 schools to safely reduce disruptions to in-person education during times of increased COVID-19 community incidence."

Members of the medical team are particularly at risk of exposure to high viral load of coronavirus. They have also the best access to professional information regarding disease treatment and prophylaxis and disseminate such knowledge. The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of use of T&CM for the prophylaxis of COVID 19 among the healthcare professionals and students in Jordan, along with the most common types and the factors associated with T&CM use.A cross-sectional study of T&CM use was conducted in Jordan using a snowball sampling method to distribute Google Forms and to enrol participants during coronavirus outbreak between June 10, 2021, and August 28, 2021. The study included healthcare professionals or students who consented to participate in the survey. The survey excluded those participants who had filled the questionnaire at least once or were pregnant/breast-feeding at the time of the study. The questionnaire consisted of 29 items, including screening, checkbox, dichotomous, matrix and open-ended questions.The response rate was 97.1%. Out of 560 study respondents, 359 (64.1%) reported using T&CM for COVID 19 prevention. Vitamins and nutrients were consumed by almost half (48.4%) of study participants, while nonpharmacological methods and herbal remedies were consumed by 35.2% and 25.2%, respectively. The most common source of information regarding T&CM use for COVID 19 prophylaxis included scientific publications (59.5%), followed by disease treatment guidelines (38.0%) and social media (32.3%). Adverse effects were reported by 8.5% and possible adverse effects were reported by another 8.5% of participants. The T&CM use was associated with working in contact with COVID 19 patients (OR: 1.625 (95% CI 1.047-2.523) (P = 0.03) and having a colleague as a source of information (OR: 1.720 (95% CI 1.026-2.883) (P = 0.04).The prevalence of T&CM use for COVID 19 prevention among healthcare professionals and students in Jordan is high, with a significant proportion of participants reporting adverse effects.

https://openalex.org/W4306896986,"Understanding temporally attention fluctuations can benefit scientific knowledge and real-life applications. Temporal attention studies have typically used the reaction time (RT), which can be measured only after a target presentation, as an index of attention level. We have proposed the Micro-Pupillary Unrest Index (M-PUI) based on pupillary fluctuation amplitude to estimate RT before the target presentation. However, the kind of temporal attention effects that the M-PUI reflects remains unclear. We examined if the M-PUI shows two types of temporal attention effects initially reported for RTs in the variable foreperiod tasks: the variable foreperiod effect (FP effect) and the sequential effect (SE effect). The FP effect refers to a decrease in the RT due to an increase in the foreperiod of the current trial, whereas the SE effect refers to an increase in the RT in the early part of the foreperiod of the current trial due to an increase in the foreperiod of the previous trial. We used a simple reaction task with the medium-term variable foreperiods (Psychomotor Vigilance Task) and found that the M-PUI primarily reflects the FP effect. Inter-individual analyses showed that the FP effect on the M-PUI, unlike other eye movement indices, is correlated with the FP effect on RT. These results suggest that the M-PUI is a potentially powerful tool for investigating temporal attention fluctuations for a partly unpredictable target."

This study aimed to identify factors affecting the complications time of congestive heart failure patients treated from January 2016 to December 2019 at Felege Hiwot comprehensive specialized referral hospital in Bahir Dar, Ethiopia. Methods A hospital-based retrospective data collection was collected from the medical charts of 218 randomly selected congestive heart failure patients. The Kaplan-Meier curve and the Cox proportional hazards model were used to compare and identify the factors associated with time to complication in patients with congestive heart failure. Results The median complication time of congestive heart failure patients was 22 months [95% CI: 21.98–28.01]. About 194 (88.99%) of the patients were complicated. The Kaplan-Meier curve depicts the survival probability of complicated patients decreasing as the complication time increases. The hazard ratios for serum sodium concentration, left ventricular ejection fraction, patients from rural areas, age of patients, serum hemoglobin concentration, and New York heart association classes I, II, and III were given 0.94 [95% CI: 0.90–1.00], 0.74 [95% CI: 0.65–0.85], 0.75 [95% CI: 0.68–0.84], 1.28 [95% CI: 1.12–1.46], 0.89 [95% CI: 0.85–0.94], 0.44 [95% CI: 0.36–0.53], 0.54 [95% CI: 0.47–0.62] and 0.73 [95% CI: 0.65–0.81] respectively, and they are statistically associated with the complication time of congestive heart failure patients. Conclusions The median complication time of congestive heart failure patients was 22 months. This study strongly suggests that healthcare awareness should be strengthened earlier about the potential complications for patients with lower serum sodium concentrations below the threshold and aged congestive heart failure patients to reduce the risk of developing complications."

Its palace buildings are the typical examples of Tibetan Buddhist monastery buildings and living fossils of Tibetan social history. This study selected 12 palace buildings of Kumbum Monastery as the study objects, used typological approaches and numerical method to analyse their spatial features, classified these features into four types (the ring road surrounding Dugang-style palace space, single-sided eaves of the Duguang-style palace space, three-stage palace space with cloisters connecting to Dugang, and other variants) according to their spatial structures, and discussed the temporal evolution of the spatial features from spatial and temporal perspectives to obtain the development process for the palace buildings of Kumbum Monastery. The analysis showed that: 1) Because the Han people migrated to Qinghai, the architectural space of the monastery followed the practices of Tibet in the same period and began to adopt the practices of the Han people under the effect of religious indoctrination and sociopolitical influence of the Ming dynasty. 2) Due to the influence of religious development facilitated by the political environment in the Qing dynasty, all the palace buildings of Kumbum Monastery adopted the practice of monasteries in Lhasa. After being implicated by the political rebellion, the monastery initiated to add the spatial layout elements of the buildings in Qinghai. Therefore, the monastery was obtaining the cues from the Han culture. 3) The dominance of religious significance over the spatial designing of the palace buildings of Kumbum Monastery gradually shifted to the political dominance. This paper revealed the spatial and temporal features and evolution of the palace building space, explored the generation process of the palace buildings space of Tibetan Buddhist monasteries in Qinghai, and provided a reference for the static conservation and dynamic development of Tibetan Buddhist monastery buildings in Qinghai."

Methods This cohort study in the Swiss Clinical Quality Management in Rheumatic Diseases (SCQM) registry included RA patients starting their first b/tsDMARD (1997-31/04/2018). The odds of achieving remission at ≤12-months, defined by disease activity score 28-joints (DAS28) &lt;2.6, were compared between men and women. Secondary analyses were adjusted for age and seropositivity, and we investigated potential mediators or factors that could explain the main findings. Results The study included 2839 (76.3%) women and 883 (23.7%) men with RA. Compared to women, men were older at diagnosis and b/tsDMARD start, but had shorter time from diagnosis to b/tsDMARD (3.4 versus 5.0 years, p&lt;0.001), and they had lower DAS28 at b/tsDMARD start. Compared to women, men had 21% increased odds of achieving DAS28-remission, with odds ratio (OR) 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02–1.42. Adjusting for age and seropositivity yielded similar findings (adjusted OR 1.24, 95%CI 1.05–1.46). Analyses of potential mediators suggested that the observed effect may be explained by the shorter disease duration and lower DAS28 at treatment initiation in men versus women. Conclusion Men started b/tsDMARD earlier than women, particularly regarding disease duration and disease activity (DAS28), and had higher odds of reaching remission. This highlights the importance of early initiation of second line treatments, and suggests to target an earlier stage of disease in women to match the benefits observed in men."
https://openalex.org/W4306897067,"Bat species inhabit subterranean environments (e.g., caves and mines) in small areas with specific microclimatic conditions, during various periods of their life cycle. Bats can be negatively influenced by microclimatic changes within their roosts if optimal habitat patches become unavailable. Therefore, proper management solutions must be applied for the conservation of vulnerable bat populations, especially in show caves. We have pursued an ensemble species distribution modelling approach in subterranean environments to identify sensible patches for bats. Using multi-annual temperature monitoring and bat distribution surveys performed within ten caves and mines, including show caves, we modelled relevant habitat patches for five bat species. The temperature-based variables generated from this approach proved to be effective when processed via species distribution models, which generated optimal validation results, even for bats that were heavily clustered in colonies. Management measures are proposed for each show cave to help in long-time conservation of hibernation and maternity colonies. These measures include creating suitable microclimatic patches within the caves by ecological reconstruction measures, tourist management practices in relation to bats, and show cave fitting recommendations. This approach has never been performed at this scale due to the complex geostatistical challenges involving subterranean environment mapping and can be further used as best practice guidelines for future conservation projects."
https://openalex.org/W4306897070,"Conservation of sperm-dependent asexual (gynogenetic) species is challenging due to their complicated ecological dynamics, which requires the stable coexistence with their sperm-providing sexual relatives, who often share similar niches. A symbolic but vulnerable gynogenetic animal is the scarlet Carassius fish, or Hibuna, which is mainly found in Lake Harutori on Hokkaido, Japan. Although Hibuna in Lake Harutori has been protected as a symbol of the Natural Monument of Japan, it has recently suffered population decline. To establish an effective conservation strategy for Hibuna, we investigated its origin, reproductive mode, and genetic diversity, with reference to the surrounding wild populations, using nuclear microsatellites and mitochondrial gene sequences. Our genetic analyses revealed that the main ploidy of Hibuna was triploid or tetraploid, and it reproduces gynogenetically. However, no co-existing sexual diploid Carassius was detected among our samples, suggesting that the sexual diploids and the gynogenetic population including Hibuna would be at risk of co-extirpation. In addition, Hibuna showed high genetic/clonal diversity and most Hibuna had nonindigenous mitochondrial haplotypes that are mostly identical to those reported from goldfish. These results indicate that Hibuna most probably originated from hybridization between indigenous gynogenetic triploids and goldfish introduced about 100 years ago, involving rare sexual reproduction. This spontaneous long-term field experiment exemplifies the recently documented diversification process of gynogenetic Carassius via complex interploidy gene flow. Although the priority to be placed on the conservation of Hibuna is controversial, the maintenance of gynogenetic Carassius , including Hibuna, requires strategic conservation of sexual populations."

Median shunt on admission was 17% (IQR 8–24.5); V A /Q was 0.61 (IQR 0.52–0.73). Shunt was 37.5% higher in deaths (median 22%, IQR 9–29) compared to survivors (16%, 8–21; p = 0.0088) and was a predictor of mortality (OR 1.04; 95% CI 1.01–1.07). Admission oxygen saturations were more strongly predictive of mortality (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.87–0.96). There was no difference in V A /Q mismatch between deaths (0.60; IQR 0.50–0.73) and survivors (0.61; IQR 0.52–0.73; p = 0.63) and it was not predictive of mortality (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.18–2.52; p = 0.55). Shunt negatively correlated with admission oxygen saturation (R -0.533; p&lt;0.0001) whereas V A /Q was not (R 0.1137; p = 0.12). Interpretation Shunt, not V A /Q mismatch, was associated with worsening hypoxia, though calculating shunt was not of prognostic value. This study adds to our understanding of the pathophysiology of hypoxaemia in COVID-19. Our inexpensive and reliable technique may provide further insights into the pathophysiology of hypoxia in other respiratory diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4306898325,"Contact allergy is a common skin allergy, which can be studied utilising contact hypersensitivity (CHS) animal model. However, it is not clear, whether CHS is a suitable model to investigate skin microbiota interactions. We characterised the effect of contact dermatitis on the skin microbiota and studied the biological effects of oxazolone (OXA) -induced inflammation on skin thickness, immune cell numbers and changes of the microbiota in CHS mouse model (n = 72) for 28 days. Through 16S rRNA gene sequencing we defined the composition of bacterial communities and associations of bacteria with inflammation. We observed that the vehicle solution of acetone and olive oil induced bacterial community changes on day 1, and OXA-induced changes were observed mainly on day 7. Many of the notably enriched bacteria present in the OXA-challenged positive group represented the genus Faecalibaculum which were most likely derived from the cage environment. Additionally, skin inflammation correlated negatively with Streptococcus, which is considered a native skin bacterium, and positively with Muribacter muris, which is typical in oral environment. Skin inflammation favoured colonisation of cage-derived faecal bacteria, and additionally mouse grooming transferred oral bacteria on the skin. Due to the observed changes, we conclude that CHS model could be used for certain skin microbiome-related research set-ups. However, since vehicle exposure can alter the skin microbiome as such, future studies should include considerations such as careful control sampling and statistical tests to account for potential confounding factors."
https://openalex.org/W4306898333,"To assess quality of care, groups of care units that cared for the same patients at various stages of end-stage renal disease, might be more appropriate than the centre level. These groups constitute “communities” that need to be delineated to evaluate their practices and outcomes. In this article, we describe the use of an agglomerative (Fast Greedy) and a divisive (Edge Betweenness) method to describe dialysis activities in France. The validation was based on the opinion of the field actors at the regional level of the REIN registry. At the end of 2018, ESRD care in France took place in 1,166 dialysis units. During 2016–2018, 32 965 transfers occurred between dialysis units. With the Edge Betweenness method, the 1,114 French dialysis units in metropolitan France were classified into 156 networks and with the Fast Greedy algorithm, 167 networks. Among the 32 965 transfers, 23 168 (70%) were defined in the same cluster by the Edge Betweenness algorithm and 26 016 (79%) in the same cluster by the Fast Greedy method. According to the Fast Greedy method, during the study period, 95% of patients received treatment in only one network. According to the opinion of the actors in the field, the Fast Greedy algorithm seemed to be the best method in the context of dialysis activity modelling. The Edge Betweenness classification was not retained because it seemed too sensitive to the volume of links between dialysis units."
https://openalex.org/W4306898342,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is a global threat. To forestall the pandemic, developing safe and effective vaccines is necessary. Because of the rapid production and little effect on the host genome, mRNA vaccines are attractive, but they have a relatively low immune response after a single dose. Replicon RNA (repRNA) is a promising vaccine platform for safety and efficacy. RepRNA vaccine encodes not only antigen genes but also the genes necessary for RNA replication. Thus, repRNA is self-replicative and can play the role of an adjuvant by itself, which elicits robust immunity. This study constructed and evaluated a repRNA vaccine in which the gene encoding the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 was inserted into a replicon of yellow fever virus 17D strain. Upon electroporation of this repRNA into baby hamster kidney cells, the S protein and yellow fever virus protein were co-expressed. Additionally, the self-replication ability of repRNA vaccine was confirmed using qRT-PCR, demonstrating its potency as a vaccine. Immunization of C57BL/6 mice with 1 μg of the repRNA vaccine induced specific T-cell responses but not antibody responses. Notably, the T-cell response induced by the repRNA vaccine was significantly higher than that induced by the nonreplicative RNA vaccine in our experimental model. In the future, it is of the essence to optimize vaccine administration methods and improve S protein expression, like protection of repRNA by nanoparticles and evasion of innate immunity of the host to enhance the immune-inducing ability of the repRNA vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W4306898345,"Early detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) in clinical specimens, its susceptibility to anti-TB drugs and disruption of infection transmission to new hosts are essential components for global tuberculosis (TB) control efforts. This study investigated major Mtb genotypes circulating in Kuwait and evaluated the performance of REBA MTB-MDR (REBA) test in comparison to GenoType MTBDRplus (gMTBDR+) assay for rapid detection of resistance of Mtb to isoniazid and rifampicin (MDR-TB). M. tuberculosis isolates (n = 256) originating predominantly from expatriate patients during a 6-month period were tested by spoligotyping and a dendrogram was created by UPGMA using MIRU-VNTRplus software. Phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST) was performed by MGIT 960 system. Genotypic DST for isoniazid and rifampicin was done by REBA and gMTBDR+ assays. Spoligotyping assigned 188 (73.4%) isolates to specific spoligotype international type (SIT) while 68 isolates exhibited orphan patterns. All major M. tuberculosis lineages were detected and EAI, CAS and Beijing families were predominant. Phylogenetic tree showed 131 patterns with 105 isolates exhibiting a unique pattern while 151 isolates clustered in 26 patterns. Fifteen isolates were resistant to one/more drugs. REBA and gMTBDR+ detected isoniazid resistance in 11/12 and 10/12 and rifampicin resistance in 4/5 and 4/5 resistant isolates, respectively. The diversity of SIT patterns are highly suggestive of infection of most expatriate patients with unique Mtb strains, likely acquired in their native countries before their arrival in Kuwait. Both, REBA and gMTBDR+ assays performed similarly for detection of resistance of Mtb to isoniazid and rifampicin for rapid detection of MDR-TB."
https://openalex.org/W4306898346,"Product information (PI) is a vital part of any medicinal product approved for use within the European Union and consists of a summary of products characteristics (SmPC) for healthcare professionals and package leaflet (PL) for patients, together with the product packaging. In this study, based on the English corpus of the EMA product information documents for all centrally approved medicinal products within the EU, a BERT sentence embedding model was used together with clustering and dimensional reduction techniques to identify sentence similarity clusters that could be candidates for standardization. A total of 1258 medicinal products were included in the study. From these, a total of 783 K sentences were extracted from SmPC and PL documents which were aggregated into a total of 284 and 129 semantic similarity clusters, respectively. The spread distribution among clusters shows separation into different cluster types. Examples of clusters with low spread include those with identical word embeddings due to current standardization, such as section headings and standard phrases. Others show minor linguistic variations, while the group with the largest variability contains variable wording but with significant semantic overlap. The sentence clusters identified could serve as candidates for further standardization of the PI. Moving from free text human wording to auto-generated text elements based on multiple-choice input for appropriate parts of the package leaflet and summary of product characteristics, could reduce both time and complexity for applicants as well as regulators, and ultimately provide patients and prescribers with documents that are easier to understand and better adapted for search availabilities."
https://openalex.org/W4306898383,"COVID-19 is an emerging infectious disease with a high transmission rate and substantial deaths. Various vaccines have been developed to combat it. This study is aimed to assess COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and hesitancy among the Nepalese population through a web-based survey.This is a web-based cross-sectional descriptive study of Nepalese people 18 years and above from different regions of Nepal who use social media (Facebook, Twitter, Reddit) as well as instant messaging applications (Messenger, Viber, WhatsApp). The duration of the study was 3 months from 1st June 2021 to 31st August 2021. The sampling technique used was self-selected non-probability sampling. A validated questionnaire had been taken to record the data.A total of 307 participants were included in the study. About three-fourths of participants 231 (75.2%) had not been vaccinated while 76 (24.8%) had been vaccinated with COVID -19 vaccine. Out of 231 non-vaccinated participants, most of participants 213 (92.2%) had shown acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine. More than two-thirds of participants believed that the vaccine would protect them, their family members, and the community from having COVID-19 in the future. Very few participants 18 (7.2%) were hesitant to receive the vaccine against COVID-19. About two-thirds of participants were being afraid of adverse effects of the COVID-19 vaccine while more than half of participants hesitated due to lack of enough information regarding COVID-19 vaccine.This study can aid in the planning of vaccination campaigns and the direction of future public health efforts aimed at increasing COVID-19 vaccine uptake."
https://openalex.org/W4306898406,"The aim of this cohort study was to describe the change in ocular surface signs and symptoms before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to associate changes with potential pandemic-related events.First-visit patients from 2019 to 2021 were examined for corneal staining, lacrimal function and refraction. We assessed the presence of seven common ocular symptoms. Patients with glaucoma and macular disease were excluded. Dry eye (DE) was diagnosed according to the criteria of the Asia Dry Eye Society.The mean age of 3,907 participants was 59.6±18.6y and 63.8% were female. Mean age and the prevalence of diagnosed DE and shortened tear break-up time decreased from 2019 to 2021. The prevalence of eye fatigue, blurring and photophobia decreased in 2020.The prevalence of diagnosed DE did not increase among first-visit patients during the pandemic compared with 2019, despite many survey results suggesting that DE may have worsened due to frequent masking, increased screen time, mental stress, and depression under quarantine and social infection control. It might be considered however, that many elderly DE patients might have refrained from consulting an ophthalmologist and possibly delayed treatment of DE during the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4306898450,"Schools have the potential to be sites of support for vulnerable children, but can also be sites of violence perpetration. In this qualitative study we explore how adult school stakeholders in and around two public Catholic primary schools in Zimbabwe conceptualise and enact child protection. We analysed our findings in light of the protracted economic crisis in Zimbabwe; the current policy context for child protection; and the Covid-19 pandemic. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 18 adult education stakeholders in and around one rural and one urban school in the Harare Archdiocese, from October 2020 to January 2021. This comprised 12 school-level stakeholders, including teachers (N = 4), parents (N = 4), school priests (N = 2), and headteachers (N = 2), who were the main focus of this study, and a further 6 high-level education actors. We employed thematic analysis. Adults in this study placed considerable responsibility on children to protect themselves, with often unreasonably high expectations of children's capacity to prevent abuse. At times they also blamed and stigmatised children, which was gendered, and particularly emerged around adolescent sexuality. Our findings suggest that this was linked to social norms around discipline, protection and gender, but in particular, the way these emerged in relation to the challenges of the context. Policy and interventions to promote child protection in schools in Zimbabwe should incorporate both an attention to the challenges teachers face in contexts of adversity, as well as address a tendency for adult school stakeholders to hold children responsible for their own protection."
https://openalex.org/W4306898480,"The burden of macro- and microvascular complications in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is substantial in Middle East countries. The current study assessed the healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) and costs related to cardiovascular and renal complications among patients with T2DM.This non-interventional, longitudinal, retrospective, cohort study collected secondary data from three insurance claims databases across Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) of patients diagnosed with T2DM. The study included adult patients aged ≥18 years diagnosed with first cardiovascular disease (CVD) during index time period and at least one T2DM claim anytime during the study time period. The primary analyses were conducted per database, stratified by three cohorts; patients with at least one claim every six months during the 1-year pre-index and 1-year post-index period (cohort 1), patients with at least one claim every six months during the 1-year pre-index, and two years post-index period (cohort 2) and patients with at least one claim every six months during the 1-year pre-index and 3-year post-index period (cohort 3). For each Payer database, demographics, CVD subgroups, HCRU, and costs were analysed. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the data.The study sample comprised of 72-78% male and 22-28% female T2DM patients with CVD and renal complications. Patients in the age group of 35-65 years or above contributed to the significant disease burden. Nearly 68 to 80% of T2DM patients developed one CVD event, and 19 to 31% of patients developed multiple CVD events during the follow-up period. For most patients with comorbid CVD and renal disease, the average HCRU cost for post‑index periods was higher compared to 1-year pre-index period across the different visit types and activities.The study findings elucidates the need for early initiation of therapies that would reduce the long-term cardiovascular and renal outcomes and the associated costs in patients with T2DM."
https://openalex.org/W4306898527,"Important factors may influence the bioactive compounds in grapes, including scion–rootstock interaction. Therefore, the bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity in grape skin and pulp fractions of ‘Isabel Precoce’, ‘BRS Carmem’, ‘BRS Cora’, ‘BRS Violeta’ and ‘IAC 138–22 Máximo’ were assessed. These cultivars, from genetic improvement programs in Brazil, have good adaptation to subtropical and tropical climate conditions, and can be widely used by winegrowers aiming at adding value to the grape. All grapevines were grafted onto ‘IAC 766’ and ‘IAC 572’ rootstocks under tropical conditions in Brazil. The highest concentration of bioactive compounds was found in skins of ‘BRS Violeta’, followed by ‘IAC 138–22 Máximo’, both grafted onto ‘IAC 766’. There was a strong correlation between phenolic content and antioxidant properties, since antioxidant activity also decreased in the sequence: ‘BRS Violeta’ &gt; ‘IAC 138–22 Máximo’ &gt; ‘BRS Cora’ &gt; ‘BRS Carmem’ &gt; ‘Isabel Precoce’. Skin from hybrid grapes (‘BRS Violeta’, ‘IAC 138–22 Máximo’, ‘BRS Cora’ and ‘BRS Carmem’) grafted in both rootstocks contains higher levels of (poly)phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity than ‘Isabel Precoce’ ( V . labrusca ). Skin from ‘BRS Violeta’ grafted onto ’IAC 766’ stand out from the others due to their high content of bioactive compounds."
https://openalex.org/W4306898544,"Benford’s law states that the first digits of numbers in any natural dataset appear with defined frequencies. Pioneering, we use Benford distribution to analyse the geo-location of cities and their population in the majority of countries. We use distances in three dimensions: 1D between the population values, 2D between the cities, based on geo-coordinates of location, 3D between cities’ location and population, which jointly reflects separation and mass of urban locations. We get four main findings. Firstly, we empirically show that mutual 3D socio-geo distances between cities and populations in most countries conform with Benford’s law, and thus the urban geo-locations have natural spatial distribution. Secondly, we show empirically that the population of cities within countries follows the composition of gamma (1,1) distributions and that 1D distance between populations also conforms to Benford’s law. Thirdly, we pioneer in replicating spatial natural distribution–we discover in simulation that a mixture of three pure point-patterns: clustered, ordered and random in proportions 15:3:2 makes the 2D spatial distribution Benford-like. Complex 3D Benford-like patterns can be built upon 2D (spatial) Benford distribution and gamma (1,1) distribution of cities’ sizes. This finding enables generating 2D and 3D Benford distributions, which may replicate well the urban settlement. Fourth, we use historical settlement analysis to claim that the geo-location of cities and inhabitants worldwide followed the evolutionary process, resulting in natural Benford-like spatial distribution and to justify our statistical findings. Those results are very novel. This study develops new spatial distribution to simulate natural locations. It shows that evolutionary settlement patterns resulted in the natural location of cities, and historical distortions in urbanisation, even if persistent till now, are being evolutionary corrected."
https://openalex.org/W4306898567,"Anecdotally there are reports of newly diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection shortly after vaccination. This has led some to speculate that vaccination itself might inadvertently increase the short-term risk of COVID potentially due to airborne spread at mass vaccination clinics or relaxation of precautions following vaccination. We explored whether receipt of vaccination was associated with a short-term increase in the risk of being diagnosed with COVID-19 and if differences exist between vaccination settings.We conducted a cohort study in Ontario, Canada to compare the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection within 21 days of receiving a first vaccination, according to the setting in which vaccines were administered between March 1, 2021 and May 6, 2021. We used linked population-wide vaccination, laboratory testing, and health administrative databases. We created a 1:1 matched comparison group of unexposed individuals. We reported the overall risk of infection calculated at 3, 7, 10, 14, 18, and 21 days. This was completed overall and by setting of vaccine receipt.We identified 4,798,430 Ontario residents who received their first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. In the primary analysis, the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection was significantly lower among vaccine recipients vs non-recipients at all the post-vaccination time points. Analysis stratified by vaccination setting found that mass vaccination clinics, pharmacies, and physician offices were consistent with the main findings. Individuals who received their first vaccine dose in congregate residential settings had a higher rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection at 7 days (HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.00-1.83) and 10 days (HR 1.49, 95% CI 1.03-2.15).In this population-based cohort study, we found that there was no increased risk of SARS-CoV2 infection after vaccination suggesting no broad transmission of disease at time of vaccination. Some evidence of increased risk among those vaccinated in congregate settings, highlighting the need to consider opportunities for supporting safe vaccine administration in these settings. Given ongoing and future immunization programs, the results support the need for continued vigilance during any mass vaccination processes and education regarding the delayed nature of protection following vaccination."
