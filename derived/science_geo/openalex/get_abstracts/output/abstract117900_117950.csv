https://openalex.org/W1988688040,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent and specific mitogen for endothelial cells. VEGF is synthesized and secreted by many differentiated cells in response to a variety of stimuli including hypoxia. VEGF is expressed in a variety of tissues as multiple homodimeric forms (121, 165, 189, and 206 amino acids/monomer) resulting from alternative RNA splicing. VEGF121 is a soluble mitogen that does not bind heparin; the longer forms of VEGF bind heparin with progressively higher affinity. The higher molecular weight forms of VEGF can be cleaved by plasmin to release a diffusible form(s) of VEGF. We characterized the proteolysis of VEGF by plasmin and other proteases. Thrombin, elastase, and collagenase did not cleave VEGF, whereas trypsin generated a series of smaller fragments. The isolated plasmin fragments of VEGF were compared with respect to heparin binding, interaction with soluble VEGF receptors, and ability to promote endothelial cell mitogenesis. Plasmin yields two fragments of VEGF as indicated by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis: an amino-terminal homodimeric protein containing receptor binding determinants and a carboxyl-terminal polypeptide which bound heparin. Amino-terminal sequencing of the carboxyl-terminal peptide identified the plasmin cleavage site as Arg110-Ala111. A heterodimeric form of VEGF165/110, was isolated from partial plasmin digests of VEGF165. The carboxyl-terminal polypeptide (111-165) displayed no affinity for soluble kinase domain region (KDR) or Fms-like tyrosine kinase (FLT-1) receptors. The various isoforms of VEGF (165, 165/110, 110, and 121) bound soluble kinase domain region receptor with similar affinity (approximately 30 pM). In contrast, soluble FLT-1 receptor differentiated VEGF isoforms (165, 165/110, 110, and 121) with apparent affinities of 10, 30, 120, and 200 pM, respectively. Endothelial cell mitogenic potencies of VEGF110 and VEGF121 were decreased more than 100-fold compared to that of VEGF165. The present findings indicate that removal of the carboxyl-terminal domain, whether it is due to alternative splicing of mRNA or to proteolysis, is associated with a significant loss in bioactivity."
https://openalex.org/W1560891849,"We have isolated a 16-amino acid peptide from the venom of the marine snail Conus magus which potently blocks nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) composed of α3β2 subunits. This peptide, named α-conotoxin MII, was identified by electrophysiologically screening venom fractions against cloned nicotinic receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The peptide's structure, which has been confirmed by mass spectrometry and total chemical synthesis, differs significantly from those of all previously isolated α-conotoxins. Disulfide bridging, however, is conserved. The toxin blocks the response to acetylcholine in oocytes expressing α3β2 nAChRs with an IC50 of 0.5 nM and is 2-4 orders of magnitude less potent on other nAChR subunit combinations. We have recently reported the isolation and characterization of α-conotoxin ImI, which selectively targets homomeric α7 neuronal nAChRs. Yet other α-conotoxins selectively block the muscle subtype of nAChR. Thus, it is increasingly apparent that α-conotoxins represent a significant resource for ligands with which to probe structure-function relationships of various nAChR subtypes.

https://openalex.org/W1594617739,"Lactacystin is a Streptomyces metabolite that inhibits cell cycle progression and induces differentiation in a murine neuroblastoma cell line. The cellular target of lactacystin is the 20 S proteasome, also known as the multicatalytic proteinase complex, an essential component of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway for intracellular protein degradation. In aqueous solution at pH 8, lactacystin undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis to yield N-acetyl-L-cysteine and the inactive lactacystin analog, clasto-lactacystin dihydroxy acid. We have studied the mechanism of lactacystin hydrolysis under these conditions and found that it proceeds exclusively through the intermediacy of the active lactacystin analog, clasto-lactacystin beta-lactone. Conditions that stabilize lactacystin (and thus prevent the transient accumulation of the intermediate beta-lactone) negate the ability of lactacystin to inactivate the proteasome. Together these findings suggest that lactacystin acts as a precursor for clasto-lactacystin beta-lactone and that the latter is the sole species that interacts with the proteasome."

Syntaxin, VAMP, and SNAP-25 serve as soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein (SNAP) receptors essential for docking and/or fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic plasma membrane. Genetic analyses in yeast, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila suggest that Munc-18 is essential for vesicle transport. On the other hand, protein kinase C (PKC) stimulates Ca2+-dependent exocytosis in various types of secretory cells. However, the modes of action of Munc-18 and PKC in vesicle transport have not been clarified. Here, we show that recombinant Munc-18 is phosphorylated by conventional PKC in a Ca2+- and phospholipid-dependent manner in a cell-free system. About 1 mol of phosphate is maximally incorporated into 1 mol of Munc-18. The major phosphorylation sites are Ser306 and Ser313. The Munc-18 complexed with syntaxin is not phosphorylated. The PKC-catalyzed phosphorylation of Munc-18 inhibits its interaction with syntaxin. These results suggest that the PKC-catalyzed phosphorylation of Munc-18 plays an important role in regulating the interaction of Munc-18 with syntaxin and thereby the docking and/or the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic plasma membrane.

Recent results from biochemical and genetic studies allow formation of a model for how synaptic vesicles are docked and fused with the presynaptic plasma membrane (for reviews, see (1.Rothman J.E.

SEC1 was isolated as a gene essential for vesicle transport in yeast(8.Aalto M.K. Keranen S. Ronne H. Cell. 1992; 68: 181-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Unc-18 and rop were identified as SEC1 homologs in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila, respectively(9.Pelham H.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 582Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 10.Salzberg A. Cohen N. Halachmi N. Kimchie Z. Leve Z. Development (Camb.). 1993; 117: 1309-1319PubMed Google Scholar). An unc-18 mutant inhibits neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic nerve terminals in Caenorhabditis elegans(11.Hosono R. Hekimi S. Kamiya Y. Sassa T. Murakami S. Nishiwaki K. Miwa J. Taketo A. Kodaira K.I. J.

Broadie K. van de Goor J. Rubin G.M. Neuron. 1994; 13: 555-566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Munc-18 was isolated as a syntaxin-binding protein and turned out to be a mammalian homolog of yeast Sec1p(13.Hata Y. Slaughter C.A. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). A mammalian homolog of yeast SEC1 was also isolated by the polymerase chain reaction method and named n-Sec1 and rbSec1(14.Pevsner J. Hsu S.C. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1445-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 15.Garcia E.P. Gatti E. Butler M. Burton J. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2003-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). These three genes, Munc-18, n-Sec1, and rbSec1, were identical. Munc-18 interacts with syntaxin with the highest affinity (Kd ≈ 80 nM) among all syntaxin-interacting molecules, and the interaction of Munc-18 with syntaxin inhibits the association of VAMP and SNAP-25 with syntaxin (16.Pevsner J. Hsu S.C. Braun J.E. Calakos N. Ting A.E. Bennett M.K. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1994; 13: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the syntaxin-related proteins, Sso1p and Sso2p, suppresses a partial loss of SEC1 gene activity in yeast (17.Aalto M.K. Ronne H. Keranen S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4095-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). These results suggest that Munc-18 plays a central role in synaptic vesicle transport by regulating the formation of the NSF-SNAP•SNARE complex. PKC was originally isolated as a Ca2+- and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (18.Takai Y. Kishimoto A. Inoue M. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol.

Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4195) Google Scholar)). The PKC family is divided into three types: conventional PKCs (α, β, and γ isoforms), novel PKCs (δ, ε, η, and θ isoforms), and atypical PKCs (ζ and λ isoforms)(21.Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4195) Google Scholar). Of many functions of PKC, conventional PKCs are involved in Ca2+-dependent exocytosis in many types of secretory cells (for a review, see a (22.Takai Y. Kikkawa U. Kaibuchi K. Nishizuka Y. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Protein Phosphorylation Res. 1984; 18: 119-158PubMed Google Scholar)), including platelets (23.Kaibuchi K. Takai Y. Sawamura M. Hoshijima M. Fujikura T. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol.

However, the mode of action of PKC in exocytosis has not been understood. In the present study, we have examined whether Munc-18 is phosphorylated by PKC and whether this phosphorylation affects the interaction of Munc-18 with syntaxin. pQE9-Munc-18 was transformed into BL21(DE3) cells. His6-Munc-18 was purified by Ni2+-NTA-agarose column chromatography (Invitrogen). Recombinant GST-syntaxin-1a was purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B column chromatography as described(4.Bennett M.K. Calakos N. Scheller R.H. Science. 1992; 257: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). A mixture of conventional PKCs (α, β, and γ isoforms) was purified from rat brain (29.Kikkawa U. Go M. Koumoto J. Nishizuka Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 135: 636-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and separated into each isoform by hydroxyapatite column chromatography (30.Sekiguchi K. Tsukuda M. Ase K. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 103: 759-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The catalytic subunit of PKA was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle(31.Bechtel P.J. Beavo J.A. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2691-2697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CaMKII and calmodulin were purified from rat brain and testis, respectively(32.Yamauchi T. Fujisawa H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 132: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 33.Gopalakrishna R. Anderson W.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 104: 830-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Munc-18 was performed in a reaction mixture (50 μl) containing 50 mM Tris/HCl at pH 7.5, 6 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 50 mM imidazole, 0.06% CHAPS, 100 μM CaCl2, 50 μM EGTA, 50 μM [γ-32P]ATP (0.5-1.2 × 103 cpm/pmol), and the mixture of conventional PKCs at 30°C for the indicated periods of time. Where specified, each isoform was used. The amounts of His6-Munc-18, PKC, PS, and TPA in a reaction mixture were 30 pmol, 0.4 pmol, 0.5 μg, and 100 nM, respectively, when not indicated. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 25 μl of 3 × Laemmli's buffer(34.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (204700) Google Scholar). Each sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by protein staining with a Coomassie Brilliant Blue and autoradiography. The radioactivity of each band was measured with Fujix BAS2000 Bioimaging Analyzer. Forty pmol of GST-syntaxin-1a fusion protein, 30 pmol of His6-Munc-18, or both were preincubated at 4°C for 30 min in the PKC reaction mixture containing PKC, PS, and TPA, but no [γ-32P]ATP. After the incubation, [γ-32P]ATP was added, and incubation was further performed at 30°C for 10 min. In one set of experiments, each sample was directly subjected to SDS-PAGE. In another set of experiments, after the phosphorylation reaction, the reaction mixture was incubated with 10 μl of glutathione beads in the presence of 0.3% CHAPS at 4°C for 30 min, followed by centrifugation and extensive washing. The sample was then subjected to SDS-PAGE. Forty pmol of His6-Munc-18 was phosphorylated by PKC maximally for 30 min in the presence of Ca2+, PS, and TPA. Phosphorylated Munc-18 was incubated with 30 pmol of GST-syntaxin-1a bound to 10 μl of glutathione beads in the presence of 1% CHAPS at 4°C for 30 min, followed by centrifugation and extensive washing. As a control, 40 pmol of His6-Munc-18 was incubated under the same conditions as described above except that [γ-32P]ATP was excluded. The intensity of the bands in SDS-PAGE was determined by densitometry. Two hundred pmol of Munc-18 was phosphorylated by PKC as described above. Phosphorylated Munc-18 was resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and digested with Achromobacter protease I(35.Shirataki H. Kaibuchi K. Sakoda T. Kishida S. Yamaguchi T. Wada K. Miyazaki M. Takai Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2061-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The digested peptides were subjected to a COSMOSIL C18 column (Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Kyoto, Japan) pre-equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Elution was performed with a 80-ml linear gradient of acetonitrile (0-65%) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The radioactivity of each peptide was counted. The amino acid sequences and phosphorylated residues of the radioactive peaks were determined as described(36.Kato M. Sasaki T. Imazumi K. Takahashi K. Araki K. Shirataki H. Matsuura Y. Ishida A. Fujisawa H. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1776-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined with bovine serum albumin as a reference protein(37.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (209479) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE(34.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (204700) Google Scholar). Munc-18 has many consensus amino acid sequences for PKC, PKA, and CaMKII (for a review, see a (38.Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). We first examined whether Munc-18 is phosphorylated by these protein kinases. Munc-18 was phosphorylated by the mixture of conventional PKCs in the presence of Ca2+ and PS, but it was rarely phosphorylated by PKA or CaMKII (Fig. 1A). Activities of these three kinases were confirmed using histone IIIss, myelin basic protein, and rabphilin-3A as respective substrates (data not shown). About 1 mol of phosphate was maximally incorporated into 1 mol of Munc-18 by PKC (data not shown). The Km value for Munc-18 was about 1 μM (data not shown), which was comparable to that of the other substrates for PKC, such as histone(39.Huang K.P. Huang F.L. Nakabayashi H. Yoshida Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14839-14845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Munc-18 was equally phosphorylated by each of α, β, and γ isoforms (data not shown). Conventional PKCs are activated by Ca2+ and PS, and this activation of PKCs is further enhanced by diacylglycerol or phorbol ester(20.Takai Y. Kishimoto A. Kikkawa U. Mori T. Nishizuka Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 91: 1218-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 21.Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4195) Google Scholar). Consistently, in the presence of both Ca2+ and PS, Munc-18 was phosphorylated by conventional PKCs (Fig. 1B, lane 3). In the presence of Ca2+ or PS alone, Munc-18 was not phosphorylated at all (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2). TPA, a PKC-activating phorbol ester, further enhanced the Ca2+- and PS-dependent phosphorylation of Munc-18 (Fig. 1B, lane 4). Munc-18 was fully phosphorylated with [γ-32P]ATP and was completely digested with Achromobacter protease I. The digest was subjected to C18 column chromatography. More than thirty peptide peaks were observed (Fig. 2A). When the radioactivity of each peak was measured, two major (Peak-1 and −2) and two minor peaks were detected. The amino acid sequences and the phosphorylated residues of the two major peaks were determined. The two minor peaks were too small to be analyzed. Peak-1 and −2 were derived from Peptide-1 and −2, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2B. Peak-1 contained three Ser residues. Ser313 was phosphorylated, but Ser311 or Ser312 was not as shown in Fig. 2C. Peak-2 contained one Thr and two Ser residues, and only Ser306 was phosphorylated (data not shown). Ser313 is well conserved in rop and unc-18, but Ser306 is not. We next examined whether the interaction of Munc-18 with syntaxin affects its phosphorylation by PKC. Munc-18 was phosphorylated by conventional PKCs in the absence and presence of GST-syntaxin-1a. The phosphorylation of Munc-18 dramatically decreased in the presence of GST-syntaxin, compared with that in the absence of GST-syntaxin (Fig. 3, A and B, lanes 2 and 3). GST-syntaxin itself was not phosphorylated (Fig. 3, A and B, lane 1). GST alone did not affect the phosphorylation of Munc-18 (data not shown). GST-syntaxin did not affect the PKC-catalyzed phosphorylation of another substrate, histone IIIss (data not shown). To confirm that Munc-18 complexed with syntaxin was not phosphorylated by PKC, the Munc-18 samples phosphorylated by PKC in the absence and presence of GST-syntaxin were separately incubated with glutathione beads, and the proteins bound to the beads were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by protein staining and autoradiography. When the phosphorylation was performed in the absence of GST-syntaxin, the Munc-18 protein molecule was very faintly detected in the beads, and the phosphorylation in the Munc-18 bound to the beads was slightly detected (Fig. 3, A and B, lane 4). These results indicate that the Munc-18 protein molecule nonspecifically interacts with the syntaxin-free beads to a very small extent. However, when the phosphorylation was performed in the presence of GST-syntaxin, a significant amount of Munc-18 was detected in the beads, but the phosphorylation in the Munc-18 bound to the beads was not detected at all (Fig. 3, A and B, lane 5). These results indicate that the Munc-18 complexed with GST-syntaxin is not phosphorylated by PKC. We performed another experiment to confirm that the Munc-18 complexed with GST-syntaxin was not phosphorylated by PKC. Munc-18 was first incubated with GST-syntaxin-1a-bound glutathione beads, followed by centrifugation and extensive washings. The Munc-18 bound to the GST-syntaxin beads was incubated with conventional PKCs in the same way as described above, but no phosphorylation of Munc-18 was detected (data not shown). Finally, we examined whether the phosphorylation of Munc-18 affects its interaction with syntaxin. Munc-18 was incubated with conventional PKCs in the absence and presence of [γ-32P]ATP, and incubated with GST-syntaxin-1a-bound glutathione beads. Free Munc-18 and the Munc-18 bound to GST-syntaxin beads were separated by centrifugation and quantitated by SDS-PAGE followed by protein staining and autoradiography. The amount of the Munc-18 bound to GST-syntaxin observed after the incubation with [γ-32P]ATP was about 20%, whereas that observed after the incubation without [γ-32P]ATP was about 65% (Fig. 4, A and C). Of the 32P radioactivity incorporated into Munc-18 after the incubation with [γ-32P]ATP, less than 10% was found in the GST-syntaxin beads, whereas more than 90% was recovered in the supernatant (Fig. 4, B and D). We have first shown here that Munc-18 is phosphorylated by PKC, but not by PKA or CaMKII, in a cell-free system. The major phosphorylation sites are Ser306 and Ser313 located in the middle portion of the protein. Munc-18 tightly interacts with syntaxin and this interaction inhibits the association of VAMP and SNAP-25 with syntaxin(16.Pevsner J. Hsu S.C. Braun J.E. Calakos N. Ting A.E. Bennett M.K. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1994; 13: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), which may lead to blockage of the formation of the NSF•SNAP•SNARE complex. We have shown here that the interaction of Munc-18 with syntaxin inhibits the PKC-catalyzed phosphorylation of Munc-18. This result suggests that the Munc-18 complexed with syntaxin does not serve as a substrate for PKC. The phosphorylation site of Munc-18 may be directly or indirectly masked by interaction with syntaxin. We have moreover shown here that the PKC-catalyzed phosphorylation of Munc-18 inhibits its interaction with syntaxin. Both the N- and C-terminal regions of Munc-18 are responsible for the interaction with syntaxin(40.Hata Y. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13022-13028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), but the definite syntaxin-binding region of Munc-18 has not been determined. Although Munc-18 is phosphorylated at least at two sites, Ser306 and Ser313, about 1 mol of phosphate is maximally incorporated into 1 mol of Munc-18. Therefore, phosphorylated Munc-18 may consist of the Ser306-phosphorylated, Ser313-phosphorylated, and/or Ser306, Ser313-phosphorylated forms. We could not separate these three forms by column chromatographies, but our results suggest that either phosphorylation of Ser306 or Ser313, or both, contributes to the inhibition of the interaction of Munc-18 with syntaxin. This region may be involved in the interaction with syntaxin, and Munc-18 may function as a key regulator in the NSF-SNAP-SNARE system through the phosphorylation of this region. We have not studied here whether the PKC-catalyzed phosphorylation of Munc-18 indeed occurs in intact neuron, because we have not yet succeeded in making a good antibody to precipitate Munc-18. However, our present results have raised several possible physiological functions of the PKC-catalyzed phosphorylation of Munc-18: 1) the phosphorylation of Munc-18 may block its re-interaction with syntaxin, after it dissociates from syntaxin, thus eventually facilitating the formation of the NSF•SNAP•SNARE complex; 2) Munc-18 has been shown to be widely distributed in the axon and not to be restricted to the nerve terminals(41.Garcia E.P. McPherson P.S. Chilcote T.J. Takei K. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 105-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). A majority of membrane-bound Munc-18 is not complexed with syntaxin(41.Garcia E.P. McPherson P.S. Chilcote T.J. Takei K. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 105-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). These results suggest that Munc-18 plays another role and that there is a mechanism to cause this distribution. The PKC-catalyzed phosphorylation of Munc-18 may be involved in this mechanism; and 3) the phosphorylation may confer a novel characteristic on Munc-18 to interact with an unknown protein and to perform an unknown function. Further studies are necessary to establish the physiological function of the PKC-catalyzed phosphorylation of Munc-18. We thank Dr. M. Inagaki for fruitful discussion."

Dose-response analysis showed that the TGF-β concentration needed to induce hepatocyte death (2.5 ng/ml) was 5 times that needed to inhibit growth in these cells (0.5 ng/ml). In response to TGF-β, hepatocytes induced DNA fragmentation and the appearance of nuclei with a DNA content lower than 2C (diploid content), typical of a programmed cell death model. TGF-β-induced apoptosis in fetal hepatocytes was preceded by an induction of reactive oxygen species production and a decrease in the glutathione intracellular content, indicating that this factor induces oxidative stress in fetal hepatocytes. Studies performed to analyze levels of c-fos mRNA, a gene whose expression is modulated by redox state, demonstrated that only high, apoptotic concentrations of TGF-β (2.5 ng/ml) produced an increase in the mRNA levels of this gene, the level of induction being similar to that found when cells were incubated in the presence of tert-butyl hydroperoxide. Gel mobility shift assays showed that the c-fos-induced expression was coincident with an increase in AP-1 activity. Finally, cell death induced by TGF-β in fetal hepatocytes was partially blocked by radical scavengers, which decreased the percentage of apoptotic cells, whereas these agents did not modify the growth-inhibitory effect elicited by TGF-β in these cells.

We designed a multistage study in the genetically isolated population of the Central Valley of Costa Rica to identify genes that promote susceptibility to severe BP (termed BPI), and screened the genome ot two Costa Rican BPI pedigrees (McInnes et al., submitted). We considered only individuals who fulfilled very stringent diagnostic criteria for BPI to be affected. The strongest evidence for a BPI locus was observed in 18q22-q23. We tested 16 additional markers in this region and seven yielded peak lod scores over 1.0. These suggestive lod scores were obtained over a far greater chromosomal length (about 40 cM) than in any other genome region. This localization is supported by marker haplotypes shared by 23 of 26 BPI affected individuals studied. Additionally, marker allele frequencies over portions of this region are significantly different in the patient sample from those of the general Costa Rican population. Finally, we performed an analysis which made use of both the evidence for linkage and for association in 18q23, and we observed significant lod scores for two markers in this region."
https://openalex.org/W1602626976,"Clostridial neurotoxins are zinc endopeptidases that block neurotransmission and have been shown to cleave, in vitro, specific proteins involved in synaptic vesicle docking and/or fusion. We have used immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting to demonstrate alterations in toxin substrates in intact neurons under conditions of toxin-induced blockade of neurotransmitter release. Vesicle-associated membrane protein, which co-localizes with synaptophysin, is not detectable in tetanus toxin-blocked cultures. Syntaxin, also concentrated in synaptic sites, is cleaved by botulinum neurotoxin C. Similarly, the carboxyl terminus of the synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25) is not detectable in botulinum neurotoxin A-treated cultures. Unexpectedly, tetanus toxin exposure causes an increase in SNAP-25 immunofluorescence, reflecting increased accessibility of antibodies to antigenic sites rather than increased expression of the protein. Furthermore, botulinum neurotoxin C causes a marked loss of the carboxyl terminus of SNAP-25 when the toxin is added to living cultures, whereas it has no action on SNAP-25 in in vitro preparations. This study is the first to demonstrate in functioning neurons that the physiologic response to these toxins is correlated with the proteolysis of their respective substrates. Furthermore, the data demonstrate that botulinum neurotoxin C, in addition to cleaving syntaxin, exerts a secondary effect on SNAP-25."

To investigate how binding of the prosthetic heme moiety is related to enzyme activities, cofactor, and L-arginine binding, as well as to secondary and quaternary protein structure, we have purified and characterized heme-deficient neuronal NO synthase. The heme-deficient enzyme, which had preserved its cytochrome c reductase activity, contained FAD and FMN, but virtually no tetrahydrobiopterin, and exhibited only marginal NO synthase activity. By means of gel filtration and static light scattering, we demonstrate that the heme-deficient enzyme is a monomer and provide evidence that heme is the sole prosthetic group controlling the quaternary structure of neuronal NO synthase. CD spectroscopy showed that most of the structural elements found in the dimeric holoenzyme were conserved in heme-deficient monomeric NO synthase. However, in spite of being properly folded, the heme-deficient enzyme did bind neither tetrahydrobiopterin nor the substrate analog NG-nitro-L-arginine.

Recent work has focused on the allosteric regulation of NOS by L-arginine, H4biopterin, and heme. The cytokine-inducible NOS dimer from macrophages was shown to form catalytically inactive monomers in the absence of H4biopterin or L-arginine and, notably, to lose its prosthetic heme group in the absence of these ligands. Reassociation of the monomers to catalytically active dimers required the coincident presence of heme, L-arginine, and pteridine, pointing to a role of these compounds in the post-translational processing of inducible NOS(29.Baek K.J. Thiel B.A. Lucas S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21120-21129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the inducible isozyme, native nNOS maintained its catalytically active, dimeric conformation even in the absence of pteridine and L-arginine(14.Klatt P. Schmidt K. Lehner D. Glatter O. Bächinger H.P. Mayer B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3687-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Thus, it is currently unclear how binding of heme to nNOS is related to subunit assembly, catalytic activity, and pteridine binding. To address this issue, we have purified heme-deficient nNOS (nNOS(h-)) from a baculovirus overexpression system and analyzed the virtually heme-free protein for catalytic activity, cofactor content, amino acid substrate, and H4biopterin binding and determined the secondary and quaternary structural features of the enzyme. L-[2,3,4,5-3H]Arginine hydrochloride (57 Ci/mmol) and NG-nitro-L-[2,3,4,5-3H]arginine hydrochloride (56 Ci/mmol) were purchased from MedPro (Amersham), Vienna, Austria. Labeled L-arginine was further purified by cation exchange HPLC with 50 mM sodium acetate (pH 6.5) as eluent to reduce blank levels in the citrulline assay. 3′-(6R)-5,6,7,8-[3H]Tetrahydro-L-biopterin (14 Ci/mmol) was synthesized enzymatically from [8,5′-3H]GTP as described previously(30.Werner E.R. Schmid M. Werner-Felmayer G. Mayer B. Wachter H. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Pteridines were obtained from Dr. B. Schircks Laboratories, Jona, Switzerland. All other chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich Chemie, Vienna, Austria or from sources described previously(8.Mayer B. John M. Heinzel B. Werner R. Wachter H.

Large scale purification of heme-saturated nNOS (nNOS(h+); ≥0.9 eq of heme per monomer from ~4.5 × 109 Sf9 cells infected in the presence of hemin chloride (4 mg/liter) with rat brain nNOS-recombinant baculovirus (32.Harteneck C.

J. 1994; 304: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) was performed by sequential affinity chromatography on 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose and calmodulin-Sepharose as described in detail recently(33.Mayer, B., Klatt, P., List, B. M., Harteneck, C., Schmidt, K. (1995) Methods Enzymol., in pressGoogle Scholar). Partially heme-deficient nNOS (~0.3 eq of heme per monomer) was obtained from Sf9 cells, which had been infected in the absence of hemin chloride. For the isolation of nNOS(h-), the partially heme-deficient protein was concentrated to ~0.10 mM by means of Vivapore concentrators (Vivascience Ltd., Stonehouse, UK), and 0.20-ml aliquots were subjected to gel filtration chromatography as described below. Fractions (0.3 ml) containing >0.4 nmol of nNOS and <0.1 eq of heme per monomer were pooled and stored at −70°C. Purified nNOS(h-) had a concentration of ~4.5 μM and contained <0.04 eq of heme per monomer. Aliquots of 0.10-0.20 ml containing 0.5-20 nmol of nNOS were injected into an HPLC system (LiChroGraph L-6200, Merck) equipped with a low pressure gradient controller and a gel filtration column, providing a separation range from approximately 5-5,000 kDa (Superose 6 HR 10/30, Pharmacia Biotech, Vienna, Austria). nNOS was eluted at room temperature at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min with a 50 mM triethanolamine/HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.50 M NaCl and detected by its absorbance at 280 nm (UV/VIS-detector L-4250, Merck). Fractions of 0.30 ml were collected for protein and cofactor determinations (see below). The column was calibrated with the gel filtration calibration kit from Pharmacia Biotech (Vienna, Austria), including blue dextran 2,000 (for the determination of the column void volume), thyroglobulin (669 kDa, Stokes radius = 8.50 nm), ferritin (440 kDa, 6.10 nm), catalase (232 kDa, 5.22 nm), aldolase (158 kDa, 4.81 nm), and bovine serum albumin (67 kDa, 3.55 nm). Calibration curves were obtained by plotting (-log Kav)0.5 against the Stokes radii of the above standard proteins (Kav = (Ve - Vo)/(Vt - Vo), with Ve, Vo, and Vt denoting the elution volume of the protein, the column void volume, and the total bed volume of the column, respectively. Unless otherwise indicated, nNOS was preincubated at room temperature in a 50 mM triethanolamine/HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 12 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, with a 2-fold molar excess of FAD and FMN or hemin chloride for 5 min (flavins) or 30 min (hemin chloride). Unbound flavins and hemin were removed by gel filtration chromatography as described above. Protein was determined with the Bradford method (34.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. The amount of bound flavins and H4biopterin was determined by reversed phase HPLC and fluorescence detection with authentic FAD, FMN, and H4biopterin as standards(35.Klatt, P., Schmidt, K., Werner, E. R., Mayer, B. (1996) Methods Enzymol., in pressGoogle Scholar). Enzyme-bound heme was quantified by reversed phase HPLC and UV/VIS-detection using myoglobin as standard(33.Mayer, B., Klatt, P., List, B. M., Harteneck, C., Schmidt, K. (1995) Methods Enzymol., in pressGoogle Scholar). Calculations of molar cofactor/NOS ratios were based on a subunit molecular mass of 160 kDa as calculated from the deduced amino acid sequence of the enzyme(15.Bredt D.S. Hwang P.M. Glatt C.E. Lowenstein C. Reed R.R. Snyder S.H. Nature. 1991; 351: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (2173) Google Scholar). NOS activity was determined as rates of L-[2,3,4,5-3H]citrulline formation from L-[2,3,4,5-3H]arginine(36.Mayer B. Klatt P. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. Neuropharmacology. 1994; 33: 1253-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Incubations were performed for 10 min at 37°C in 0.1 ml of 50 mM triethanolamine/HCl buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.6-2.4 pmol of nNOS, 0.1 mML-[2,3,4,5-3H]arginine (~80,000 cpm), 0.5 mM CaCl2, 10 μg/ml calmodulin, 0.2 mM NADPH, 10 μM H4biopterin, 5 μM FMN, and 5 μM FAD. The detergent CHAPS was included in the incubation mixture at a final concentration of 0.2 mM, since purified rat brain NOS was found to exhibit only ~20% of control activity if assayed in the absence of an added detergent (not shown). Calmodulin-dependent NADPH:oxygen and NADPH:cytochrome c oxidoreductase activities of nNOS were determined in the absence of L-arginine as described previously(8.Mayer B. John M. Heinzel B. Werner R. Wachter H. Schultz G. Böhme E. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 18.Klatt P. Heinzel B. John M. Kastner M. Böhme E. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11374-11378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, purified NOS (0.3-1.2 pmol) was incubated in final volumes of 0.2 ml of 50 mM triethanolamine/HCl buffer, pH 7.0, in the presence of 0.5 mM CaCl2, 10 μg/ml calmodulin, 0.1 mM NADPH, and 0.2 mM CHAPS at 37°C. For the determination of cytochrome c reductase activity, 0.2 mM cytochrome c was additionally present. The changes in absorbance at 340 nm (NADPH) or 550 nm (cytochrome c) were monitored continuously against calmodulin-deficient blank samples, which exhibited ≤2 and 12% of enzyme activity determined in the presence of calmodulin, respectively. Rates of NADPH oxidation and cytochrome c reduction were calculated using extinction coefficients of 6.3 and 21 mM-1 × cm-1, respectively. For the determination of enzyme kinetic parameters, substrate concentrations were 1-50 μM (L-arginine) and 5-100 μM (cytochrome c), respectively. Vmax and Km values were obtained from weighted Lineweaver-Burk plots(37.DeLevie R. J. Chem. Educ. 1986; 63: 10-15Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Turnover numbers (kcat) were calculated from the respective Vmax values and represent the maximum number of converted L-arginine molecules per min and per number of active sites, i.e. the number of heme-containing NOS molecules. Binding experiments were performed as described previously(38.Klatt P. Schmid M. Leopold E. Schmidt K. Werner E.R. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13861-13866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Klatt P. Schmidt K. Brunner F. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1674-1680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, nNOS (18-40 pmol) was incubated for 10 min at 37°C with 12 nML-[3H]NNA (~70 nCi) or [3H]H4biopterin (~17 nCi) and increasing concentrations of the respective unlabeled ligand (10 nM-10 μM) in 0.1 ml of a 50 mM triethanolamine/HCl buffer, pH 7.0. Reactions were stopped by polyethylene glycol precipitation followed by vacuum filtration. The amount of the bound radioligand retained on the filters was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Data were corrected for nonspecific binding determined in the presence of 1 mM unlabeled ligand. KD and Bmax values were calculated using the GIPMAX nonlinear least squares regression curve fitting program(40.Brunner F. Kukovetz W.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 102: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Given the low overall recovery (<25%) of this binding assay(36.Mayer B. Klatt P. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. Neuropharmacology. 1994; 33: 1253-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 38.Klatt P. Schmid M. Leopold E. Schmidt K. Werner E.R. Mayer B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 1674-1680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the calculated Bmax values are only semiquantitative estimates and do not allow the determination of the number of pteridine or L-arginine binding sites. nNOS was subjected to low temperature SDS-PAGE essentially as described recently(14.Klatt P. Schmidt K. Lehner D. Glatter O. Bächinger H.P. Mayer B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3687-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Briefly, nNOS (~150 pmol) was incubated for 5 min at 37°C in 50 μl of 50 mM triethanolamine/HCl buffer (pH 7.0) in the absence or presence of H4biopterin (0.1 mM) and L-arginine (1 mM). Incubations were terminated by the addition of 50 μl of chilled Laemmli buffer(41.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), containing 0.125 M Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4% (w/v) SDS, 20% (w/v) glycerol, and 0.02% (w/v) bromphenol blue. 2-Mercaptoethanol, which interfered with the heme-staining method described below, was omitted from the Laemmli buffer without having any effect on the migration pattern nNOS. Samples, containing ~30 pmol of nNOS, were subjected to SDS-PAGE for 60 min at a constant current of 30 mA on discontinuous 6% SDS-gels (70 × 80 × 1 mm). Gels and buffers, which had been prepared according to Laemmli(41.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), were equilibrated at 4°C prior to electrophoresis, and the buffer tank was cooled by means of an ice bath during electrophoresis. Gels were either stained for protein with Coomassie Blue R-250 or for heme with 3,3′-dimethoxybenzidine/H2O2 following a published method (42.Thomas P.E. Ryan D. Levin W. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 75: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Gels were washed for 10 min in methanol/sodium acetate (0.25 M, pH 5.0) = 3:7 (v/v) and subsequently incubated in the dark for 20 min in a freshly prepared solution, containing 7 parts of 0.25 M sodium acetate, pH 5.0, and 3 parts of 6 mM 3,3′-dimethoxybenzidine dihydrochloride in methanol. Gels were developed for 60 min by adding H2O2 to a final concentration of 60 mM, washed for 30 min in H2O/methanol/acetic acid = 8:1:1 (v/v/v), dried, and photographed. Relative amounts of protein or heme were estimated by densitometric analysis using the vds 800 video system and H1D-software of Hirschmann (Analysentechnik Hirschmann, Taufkirchen, Germany). The molecular mass of nNOS was estimated using a calibration kit from Bio-Rad, including thyroglobulin (subunit molecular mass = 330 kDa), ferritin (subunit molecular mass = 220 kDa), phosphorylase b (94 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), and catalase (subunit molecular mass = 60 kDa). Static light scattering can be used for the determination of the molecular mass of macromolecules in solution by extrapolation of the scattered intensity to zero angle (Zimm plot)(43.Chu B. Laser Light Scattering. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, New York1991Google Scholar, 44.Huglin M.B. Light Scattering from Polymer Solutions. Academic Press, New York1972Google Scholar). Accurate determinations of the specific refractive index increments (δn/δc) of the solute particles are required for molecular mass determinations by this method. Due to limitations in the amount of the available nNOS(h-) protein, reliable n/δc measurements were not possible. However, the δn/δc values for related proteins are identical, and there is virtually no angular dependence of the scattering intensity (I90 ~ I0). Thus, the scattering intensity of different nNOS species measured at a fixed scattering angle depends exclusively on (molecular mass × protein concentration), allowing the determination of the molecular mass ratio of nNOS(h-) and nNOS(h+). Light scattering measurements were performed on an arbitrary scale with equally concentrated solutions of nNOS(h-) and nNOS(h+) (5.4 μM) in rectangular microcuvettes (30 μl) at a scattering angle of 90 degrees at 8°C, using an Ar+ laser (Spectra-Physics, model 2060-65) at a wavelength of 514.5 nm and an output power of 400 milliwatts. Measuring times were 20 s, with each sample being scanned 20 times. For CD measurements, solutions of nNOS (~15 μM) were diluted 1:10 in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 and reconcentrated, using Centricon-30 microconcentrators (Amicon, purchased from W. D. Haider, Kottingbrunn, Austria). This procedure was repeated four times to minimize the amount of 2-mercaptoethanol, EGTA, triethanolamine, and NaCl present in the enzyme preparations. CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-500A spectrophotometer, using a 0.1-mm path length cell (Helma) thermostated at 20°C. Spectra and buffer base lines (filtrate from the last concentration step on Centricon-30 microconcentrators) were averaged from 10 scans, each recorded at 0.1 nm intervals, using a scanning rate of 1 nm/min and a time constant of 2 s. The instrument was calibrated as described(45.Compton L.A. Davis J.M. MacDonald J.R. Bächinger H.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 927-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and base line corrections were made by means of the software provided by Jasco. Calculations of Δε values were based on amino acid analysis, and the secondary structure of nNOS was computed by means of the variable selection method using a set of 33 reference proteins(46.Compton L.A. Mathews C.K. Johnson Jr., W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13039-13043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the role of heme in nNOS structure and function, we attempted to purify recombinant heme-deficient nNOS from a baculovirus overexpression system. From 4.5 × 109 cells, which had been infected with the rat brain NOS-recombinant baculovirus for 48 h in the absence of hemin chloride, we obtained ~80 mg of nNOS with a heme content of 0.29 ± 0.03 eq per monomer (n = 3). The amount of heme bound to the recombinant protein was not significantly reduced by preincubation (24-48 h) and infection (48 h) of Sf9 cells in the presence of 0.25 and 0.50 mM succinyl acetone, an inhibitor of heme biosynthesis(47.Pinnix I.B. Guzman G. Bonkovsky H.L. Zaki S.R. Kinkade J.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 312: 447-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), although cytosolic heme levels were reduced down to 10% of untreated control cells under these conditions (not shown). Partially heme-deficient nNOS was further analyzed for H4biopterin, FAD, and FMN, revealing that substoichiometric amounts of these cofactors were incorporated into the protein (0.12 ± 0.01, 0.17 ± 0.01, and 0.11 ± 0.01 eq per monomer, respectively; n = 3). In the presence of saturating concentrations of exogenous H4biopterin, FAD, and FMN, the partially heme-deficient enzyme exhibited only low specific activity (0.30 ± 0.03 μmol of L-citrulline × min-1 × mg-1, n = 3) as compared with the holoenzyme (1.08 ± 0.14 μmol × min-1 × mg-1, n = 3). To investigate whether partially heme-deficient nNOS can be reconstituted with flavins, we have preincubated the protein with a 2-fold molar excess of FAD and FMN for 5 min at room temperature and subsequently removed free flavins by gel filtration chromatography. Under these conditions, the amount of protein-bound FAD and FMN was increased ~6-fold to 0.98 ± 0.06 and 0.65 ± 0.04 eq per monomer, respectively (n = 3). Increasing the incubation time to 60 min did not further enhance FMN binding. To confirm that the flavins were incorporated into the nNOS protein in a catalytically active form, we have determined cytochrome c reductase activities of the reconstituted protein in the absence of exogenous flavins. Enzyme kinetic analysis revealed that reconstitution of nNOS with flavins had no effect on the affinity of cytochrome c for nNOS but was accompanied by a ~5-fold increase of cytochrome c reductase activity as compared to controls (Km, 14 ± 3 versus 15 ± 1 μM; Vmax, 2.6 ± 0.6 versus 15 ± 2 μmol × min-1 × mg-1; n = 3). Maximal rates of L-citrulline formation as well as L-arginine- and H4biopterin-independent NADPH oxidation were not affected (not shown), demonstrating that the amount of enzyme-bound heme was limiting for NOS activity of the protein. Gel filtration chromatography of the partially heme-deficient enzyme preparations, which had been reconstituted with FAD and FMN, revealed that NOS activity eluted in a single and well defined peak centered at an elution volume of 11.8 ml (Fig. 1, upper panel, filled circles). nNOS eluting in this peak fraction contained 0.56 ± 0.06 eq of heme per monomer (n = 3) and had a specific activity of 0.88 ± 0.09 μmol × min-1 × mg-1 (n = 3) when assayed in the presence of saturating concentrations of exogenous H4biopterin and flavins. Cytochrome c reductase activity eluted in a broad peak with two maxima at 11.8 and 13.0 ml, and ~40% of the total reductase activity were found in fractions which did not exhibit detectable citrulline formation (Fig. 1, upper panel, open circles), suggesting the separation of two protein species. As shown in the lower panel of Fig. 1, comparable elution profiles were found when the eluate was assayed for protein (filled circles), FAD (open circles), and FMN (filled squares), demonstrating that both protein species contained virtually stoichiometric amounts of FAD and ~0.6 eq of FMN per monomer. Substoichiometric binding of FMN as well as a rightward shift of the FMN elution profile points to dissociation of the flavin during gel filtration. In contrast to FAD and FMN, which co-eluted with the reductase activity of nNOS, heme and H4biopterin strictly co-eluted with L-citrulline forming activity, demonstrating that heme-deficient nNOS was separated from the active heme-containing enzyme. Virtually pure heme-deficient nNOS (nNOS(h-), ≤0.04 eq of heme per monomer) was obtained by pooling gel filtration column fractions which contained >0.4 nmol nNOS and <0.1 mol eq of heme per monomer. nNOS(h-) was found to contain only marginal amounts of heme and H4biopterin (0.030 ± 0.006 and 0.007 ± 0.001 eq per monomer, respectively; n = 3). The amount of flavins bound to nNOS(h-) was almost identical with that of the starting material used for the isolation of the heme-deficient protein (0.87 ± 0.14 versus 0.98 ± 0.06 and 0.61 ± 0.08 versus 0.65 ± 0.04 eq per monomer, respectively; n = 3), indicating that heme deficiency do"
https://openalex.org/W2007232880,"Using limited proteolysis, we show that the domain boundaries of human topoisomerase I closely parallel those predicted from sequence comparisons with other cellular Topo I enzymes. The enzyme is comprised of (i) an NH2-terminal domain (~24 kDa), which is known to be dispensable for activity, (ii) the core domain (~54 kDa), (iii) a linker region (~3 kDa), and (iv) the COOH-terminal domain (~10 kDa), which contains the active site tyrosine. The highly conserved core and COOH-terminal domains are resistant to proteolysis, while the unconserved NH2-terminal and linker domains are sensitive. Noncovalent binding of Topo I to plasmid DNA or to short duplex oligonucleotides decreases the sensitivity of the linker to proteolysis by approximately a factor of 10 but has no effect on proteolysis of the NH2-terminal domain. When the enzyme is covalently complexed to an 18 base pair single-stranded oligonucleotide, the linker region is sensitive to proteolysis whether or not duplex DNA is present. The net positive charge of the linker domain suggests that at a certain point in catalysis the linker may bind directly to DNA. Further, we show that limited subtilisin cleavage can generate a mixture of 60-kDa core and ~10-kDa COOH-terminal fragments, which retain a level of topoisomerase activity that is nearly equal to undigested control samples, presumably because the two fragments remain associated after proteolytic cleavage. Thus, despite its potential role in DNA binding, the linker domain (in addition to the NH2-terminal domain) appears to be dispensable for topoisomerase activity. Finally, the limited proteolysis pattern of the human enzyme differs substantially from the limited proteolysis pattern of the vaccinia viral Topo I, indicating that the two enzymes belong to separate eukaryotic topoisomerase I subfamilies.

INTRODUCTIONEukaryotic topoisomerase I (Topo I) ( 1The abbreviations used are: Topo Itopoisomerase ITopo70NH2-terminal truncation of Topo I, missing the first 174 amino acidsTopo58COOH-terminal truncation of Topo70, missing the last 106 amino acidsY723FTopo I with active site tyrosine at position 723 replaced with phenylalaninePMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideCDcircular dichroismDTTdithiothreitolCPGcontrolled pore glassACNacetonitrileSDSsodium dodecyl sulfatePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisSDBstandard digestion bufferKDBpotassium phosphate digestion buffer.) relaxes both negatively and positively supercoiled DNA by catalyzing the transient breakage of a phosphodiester bond in a single DNA strand (reviewed in (1.Champoux J.J. Wang J.C. Cozzarelli N.R. DNA Topology and Its Biological Effects. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990: 217-242Google Scholar)). No metal cation or energy cofactor is required for Topo I activity. Cleavage of a phosphodiester bond in DNA involves a transesterification reaction in which the nucleophilic O-4 oxygen of the active site tyrosine (amino acid 723 in human Topo I(2.Lynn R.M. Bjornsti M.-A. Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3559-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 3.Madden K.R. Champoux J.J. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 525-532PubMed Google Scholar)) attacks the phosphodiester linkage. This results in the formation of a phosphotyrosine bond between the enzyme and the 3′ end of the broken strand. Reversal of the transesterification reaction restores the phosphodiester bond and liberates the enzyme. Two models, free rotation and enzyme-bridging, have been proposed to explain the mechanism by which Topo I promotes topoisomerization of the DNA (reviewed in (1.Champoux J.J. Wang J.C. Cozzarelli N.R. DNA Topology and Its Biological Effects. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990: 217-242Google Scholar)). The free rotation model proposes that the 5′ end of the broken strand is released from the active site and is allowed to freely rotate about the unbroken strand. The enzyme-bridging model proposes that the unbroken strand is passed through an enzyme-bridged break, formed by covalent attachment to the 3′ end of the broken strand and noncovalent binding to the 5′ end of the broken strand.Sequence comparisons of the cellular eukaryotic Topo I enzymes ( 2For further information, contact J. C. Wang at [email protected] .) reveals the human enzyme (765 residues, 91 kDa) can be divided into four domains (see preceding paper (5.Stewart L. Ireton G. Parker L. Madden K. Champoux J.J. J.

Two segments of the human enzyme show similarity to the vaccinia Topo I. These are residues Pro357-His632 of the core domain and residues Gly717-Phe765 of the COOH-terminal domain, which includes the active site tyrosine.2 Like the cellular enzymes, vaccinia Topo I relaxes negatively and positively supercoiled DNA, does not require an energy cofactor or divalent cation, and is stimulated by Mg2+(10.Shuman S.

First, the vaccinia enzyme is not inhibited by camptothecin(10.Shuman S. Golder M. Moss B. J. Biol.

The digestion patterns show that the conserved core and COOH-terminal domains are globular, tightly folded segments of the protein, while the NH2 terminus and the linker domain are extremely sensitive to proteolysis. We also find that noncovalent binding of duplex DNA results in protection of the linker domain, but not the NH2-terminal domain, from proteolysis. When the enzyme is permanently trapped in a covalent complex with a single-stranded oligonucleotide, the linker region is rendered sensitive to proteolysis whether duplex DNA is present or not. Taken together, our results provide the first structural model for human Topo I and provide important insights into the nature of its interaction with DNA. A comparison of this model with that recently proposed for the vaccinia viral Topo I suggests that the cellular and viral enzymes belong to different Topo I families.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneralThe recombinant proteins including (i) the wild type and Y723F forms of full-length human Topo I (91 kDa), (ii) the wild type and Y723F forms of the NH2-terminally deleted Topo70, which starts with an engineered methionine immediately adjacent to residue Lys175 (70 kDa), and (iii) the core fragment Topo58, which has the same NH2 terminus as Topo70 but is terminated following amino acid Ala659 (58 kDa) were generated and purified as described in the accompanying paper (see Fig. 1B in (5.Stewart L. Ireton G. Parker L. Madden K. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7593-7601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar)). Long term storage of crude insect cell nuclear extracts containing recombinant full-length Topo I resulted in proteolytic breakdown of the full-length protein into fragments of 70 and 75 kDa, designated f-Topo70 and f-Topo75(5.Stewart L. Ireton G. Parker L. Madden K. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7593-7601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Both fragments were purified and demonstrated to be NH2-terminally deleted forms of Topo I, where f-Topo75 is missing the first 137 residues and f-Topo70 is missing the first 174 residues(5.Stewart L. Ireton G. Parker L. Madden K. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7593-7601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Plasmid relaxation assays, SDS-PAGE, autoradiography, and amino-terminal sequence analyses were carried out as described in the accompanying paper(5.Stewart L. Ireton G. Parker L. Madden K.

Chem. 1996; 271: 7593-7601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar).Antiserum and ImmunoblottingPolyclonal anti-Topo I serum was raised in a rabbit that had been injected with purified recombinant human Topo I. Immunoaffinity purification of anti-Topo I serum was achieved by incubation of the crude serum with Affi-10 agarose beads (Bio-Rad) to which Topo I had been conjugated. The affinity beads were washed extensively with 100 mM and 10 mM Tris-hydrochloride, pH 8.0, and eluted with 100 mM glycine, pH 3.0(26.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The eluate was neutralized with 0.1 volume of 1 M Tris-hydrochloride, pH 8.0, dialyzed against 50% glycerol in phosphate-buffered saline, and stored at −20°C. The affinity-purified antiserum was used for chemiluminescent immunoblotting as described previously(27.Stewart L. Vogt V.M. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6218-6231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Purification and Radiolabeling of OligonucleotidesDNA oligonucleotides were synthesized by DNA Express (Fort Collins, CO), and obtained while still covalently attached to the controlled pore glass (CPG) beads with the trityl group on. The oligonucleotides were uncoupled from the CPG beads during an overnight incubation in 1 ml of concentrated NH4OH at 55°C in a screw cap tube. The tubes were cooled to −20°C before being uncapped, at which point the CPG beads plus NH4OH were taken up in a syringe that contained 5 ml of 80 mM ammonium acetate, pH 10.0. The diluted material was filtered through a 0.45-μm Elutip (Schleicher & Schuell) syringe filter before being loaded onto a POROS R2-20 column (4.6/100-mm, Perseptive Biosystems). The reverse phase R2 column was eluted with a 0-30% acetonitrile (ACN) gradient in 80 mM ammonium acetate, pH 10.0. The trityl-off failure (n minus-mer) sequences were found to elute at 8% ACN, while the full-length (n-mer) oligonucleotides eluted at 20% ACN. The 20% ACN oligonucleotide pool was diluted with 1.5 volumes of 2% trifluoroacetic acid immediately prior to being loaded onto a strong anion exchange POROS HQ-20 column (4.6/100-mm) that was equilibrated with HQ buffer (25 mM NaOH, 1 mM EDTA). The column was washed with 20 ml of HQ buffer and eluted with a 0-600 mM NaCl gradient in HQ buffer. The peak fractions were pooled and loaded back onto the R2 column, which was washed with 20 ml of 80 mM ammonium acetate, pH 10.0, to remove all traces of NaCl. The R2 column was step-eluted with 100% ACN, and fractions were carefully collected in order to minimize the quantity of ammonium acetate carried over into the ACN eluate. The oligonucleotides were dried down under vacuum, resuspended in water, and stored at −20°C.The purified oligonucleotides were radiolabeled by incubating 5 μg of oligonucleotide with 100 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (Biolabs) in 100 μl of kinase buffer (Biolabs) for 30 min at 37°C. The reactions were terminated by incubation at 65°C for 10 min. Unincorporated label was separated from the oligonucleotide by chromatography through a 1.5-ml Sephadex G-25 spin column that was equilibrated with STE (20 mM Tris-hydrochloride, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA).ProteolysisTrypsin and subtilisin were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim, and resorufin-labeled casein was purchased from Calbiochem. All experimental digestions were carried out for 20 min at room temperature in either the standard digestion buffer (SDB) (100 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-hydrochloride, pH7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT) or KPO4 digestion buffer (KDB) (170 mM KPO4, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 10 mM MgCl2), and terminated by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) to a final concentration of 1 mM. To assess the effect of DNA on the activity of trypsin and subtilisin, resorufin-casein was subjected to digestion in the presence and absence of DNA. Digestions were carried out in SDB with or without 10 mM MgCl2 and in the presence or absence of 80 μg/ml of plasmid DNA. The reactions were terminated, and the undigested protein was precipitated by the addition of 3 volumes of 5% trichloroacetic acid. The samples were stored at 4°C for 16 h, and the precipitate was removed by centrifugation for 10 min in the microfuge. The supernatants were neutralized by the addition of 6 volumes of 0.5 M Tris-hydrochloride, pH 8.5, and subjected to spectrofluorometric analysis with an excitation wavelength of 574 nm and a detector wavelength of 584 nm. In this way, proteolysis of the fluorescent substrate was assessed by measuring the quantity of trichloroacetic acid-soluble chromophore following digestion. This assay demonstrated that DNA has little if any effect on the activity of either trypsin or subtilisin in either the presence or absence of Mg2+ (data not shown).Purification of Radiolabeled Topo I-Oligonucleotide Covalent ComplexesRadiolabeled Topo I-oligonucleotide complexes were generated by incubating 40 μg of topoisomerase (full-length Topo I or Topo70) with 5 μg of 5′-32P-end-labeled suicide oligonucleotide (either 5′-AAAAAGACTTAGAAAAATTTTT-3′ or 5′-GAAAAAAGACTTAGAAAAATTTTTA-3′), in 100 μl of suicide buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-hydrochloride, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM MgCl2) for 3 h at room temperature. The unreacted protein and protein-DNA complexes were separated from excess suicide substrate by small scale SP-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) chromatography. The reaction mixture was passed over a 0.25-ml bed volume of SP-Sepharose that was equilibrated with 100 mM KPO4, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT. The column was washed with 20 volumes of the same buffer to remove excess oligonucleotide and then eluted with two 0.25-ml washes of 500 mM KPO4, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT. The eluate, which contained a mixture of suicided complexes and unreacted enzyme, was stored at 4°C.RESULTSLimited Proteolysis of Topo ITo examine the domain structure of Topo I, we subjected recombinant full-length Topo I to limited proteolytic digestion with a variety of proteases. Subtilisin and trypsin were found to produce the most informative digestion patterns (Fig. 1A). At low concentrations, subtilisin cleaves Topo I into fragments of approximately 75 and 73 kDa (lane 5), while trypsin cleaves Topo I into fragments of sizes between 73 and 67 kDa (lane 10). At higher concentrations, subtilisin and trypsin generate ~60- and ~55-kDa fragments, respectively, defined as s-Topo60 (lanes 2-4) and t-Topo55 (lanes 7-9). At still higher concentrations, fragments of ~33 and ~12 kDa are generated by both proteases (lanes 2 and 7).To learn more about the amino acid sequence content of the Topo I fragments, we subjected s-Topo60 and t-Topo55 to NH2-terminal sequence analysis. The NH2 terminus of s-Topo60 was found to be Lys151, while t-Topo55 begins with Lys197. Given the relative sizes of these two proteins, the specificity of trypsin to cleave at lysine and arginine residues, and the NH2-terminal sequence information, the COOH termini of both fragments are predicted to be located at or near Lys654, and therefore both fragments lack the conserved COOH-terminal ~10-kDa domain.To determine the level of Topo I activity that remains following digestion with subtilisin, we terminated proteolysis by the addition of PMSF and performed plasmid relaxation assays with the digested proteins (Fig. 1B). Surprisingly, even when most of the full-length protein had been converted into the s-Topo60 fragment (sample 2), there was only a ~3-fold drop in enzyme activity. Since it has been shown previously that the smallest NH2-terminally deleted form of Topo I that retains activity is 63 kDa (starting at residue 231)(9.Kikuchi A. Miyaike M. Andoh T. Ikeda H. Oguro M. Molecular Biology of DNA Topoisomerases and Its Application to Chemotherapy. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1993: 121-130Google Scholar), this result suggested that s-Topo60 (which lacks the COOH-terminal domain) may act in conjunction with a COOH-terminal fragment to achieve activity.Identification of COOH-terminal Proteolytic FragmentsTo determine the fate of the COOH-terminal domain during digestion, we radiolabled the COOH terminus of recombinant Topo I by incubating the enzyme with a 32p-5′-end-labeled 22-base “suicide” oligonucleotide, which is capable of forming an intermolecular 8-base pair duplex at its 3′ end. Topo I cleaves one strand of this duplex region, and concomitantly becomes covalently linked to the 3′ end at the site of cleavage (data not shown). However, the topoisomerization reaction cannot be completed since the 3′ segment of the broken strand falls away from the cleaved complex, leaving it with no 5′ hydroxyl to attack the phosphotyrosine bond and reverse the reaction. This results in the formation of a stable radiolabeled covalent complex, which was separated from excess uncleaved oligonucleotide by SP-Sepharose chromatography. It is important to note that the SP-Sepharose eluate contains only a small fraction of radiolabeled molecules, while the bulk of the protein is unlabeled since it did not undergo suicidal cleavage. This mixture was then digested with increasing quantities of either subtilisin or trypsin. Fragments containing the COOH-terminal domain were identified by autoradiography following fractionation by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). This analysis revealed that the 67-75-kDa fragments each contain the COOH-terminal domain (subtilisin lanes 5-8, trypsin lanes 12-16; compare silver stained gels in panel A with the autoradiographs in panel B). As expected, 32p label is absent from the s-Topo60 and t-Topo55 fragments, confirming that they are missing the COOH-terminal domain. It can also be seen that with increasing levels of protease, a 32p-labeled COOH-terminal fragment of ~15 kDa was released from the larger fragments. This 32p-labeled COOH-terminal fragment is composed of a ~5-kDa oligonucleotide that is covalently attached to a COOH-terminal fragment of ~10 kDa. ( 3L. Stewart, G. Ireton, and J. Champoux, manuscript in preparation.) These results indicate that cleavage of the 67-75-kDa fragments generates a ~10-kDa COOH-terminal fragment and the s-Topo60 and t-Topo55 fragments. Though not obvious in the figure, when the autoradiographs are superimposed on their respective silver-stained gels, it can be seen that the radiolabeled molecules, which are only a fraction of the total, migrate slightly slower than the bulk of the unlabeled proteins due to the attached oligonucleotide.Figure 2:Subtilisin and trypsin digestion of 32P-labeled Topo I-oligonucleotide covalent complexes. Full-length Topo I (F.L. topo I) was allowed to undergo suicide cleavage with a 32P-5′-end-labeled 22-mer (5′-AAAAAGACTTAGAAAAATTTTT-3′) substrate. The protein was separated from excess 22-mer by SP-Sepharose chromatography (“Experimental Procedures”), diluted into KDB, and digested with 2-fold decreasing (starting at 50 ng/μl) quantities of subtilisin (lanes 2-8) or trypsin (lanes 10-16). The samples were analyzed by 9-17% SDS-PAGE, followed by silver staining (A) and autoradiography (B). Lane 1 contained radiolabeled suicided recombinant Topo70 that was adjusted to 1 mM PMSF prior (PMSF first) to the addition of 50 ng/μl subtilisin. Lanes 9 and 17 contained radiolabeled suicided Topo I that was incubated under digestion conditions without added protease. The positions of the various cleavage products and the proteases are indicated along the two sides of the figure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Effects of Plasmid DNA on Proteolysis of Topo ITogether the data presented thus far indicate that the actual domain structure of Topo I closely parallels that predicted from sequence comparisons (see Fig. 6). With this picture in mind, we next sought to gain insight into the domain(s) of Topo I that either interact with DNA or undergo a conformational shift upon binding to DNA. To this end, we compared the subtilisin digestion pattern of recombinant Topo I in the presence and absence of plasmid DNA with the goal of identifying regions of Topo I that might either become more resistant or more sensitive to the protease when DNA was present. After performing preliminary experiments to ensure that DNA does not act as general inhibitor of subtilisin (see “Experimental Procedures”), we subjected both wild type and Y723F mutant full-length Topo I to digestion with increasing quantities of subtilisin in the presence or absence of plasmid DNA (Fig. 3). The DNA:protein mass ratio was set at 2:1 to ensure that protein-DNA complexes remained soluble (data not shown).Figure 6:Domain structure of Topo I. As revealed by the biochemical analyses presented in this and the accompanying manuscript(5.Stewart L. Ireton G. Parker L. Madden K. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7593-7601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), the domain structure of human Topo I closely parallels that which is predicted from sequence comparisons. The NH2-terminal domain (residues 1-197) is largely if not entirely unfolded and is dispensable for activity. The core domain (residues 198-651) is largely resistant to proteolysis, as is the COOH-terminal 10-kDa domain (residues 697-765). The linker region (residues 652-696) is sensitive to proteolysis in the absence of DNA, but in the presence of DNA it is 10-fold more resistant to proteolysis. In the suicided covalent complex, this same linker region is sensitive to proteolysis both in the absence and in the presence of excess duplex DNA. Arrows, sites of proteolytic cleavage within the NH2-terminal domain that have been defined by amino-terminal sequencing. Broken arrows, predicted approximate sites of limited subtilisin and trypsin cleavage within the linker domain.

Wild type (top panel) or Y723F active site mutant (bottom panel) Topo I proteins were digested in SDB, in the presence or absence of 100 μg/ml of plasmid DNA (+DNA, lanes 6-10 and lanes 16-20; -DNA, lanes 1-5 and lanes 11-15), with or without 10 mM MgCl2 (+Mg2+, lanes 11-20; -Mg2+, lanes 1-10). The 100-μl reactions contained 5 μg of Topo I plus the following quantities of protease: 0.5 μg (lanes 1, 6, 11, and 16), 0.25 μg (lanes 2, 7, 12, and 17), 0.125 μg (lanes 3, 8, 13, and 18), 0.0625 μg (lanes 4, 9, 14, and 19), or no protease (lanes 5, 10, 15, and 20). The samples were fractionated by 5-17% SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining.

https://openalex.org/W2134139236,"In cortical neurons differentiating in vitro, transmembrane amyloid precursor protein (APP) is distributed in two pools. Whereas the first pool is present in all cell compartments, the second pool is highly enriched in the axon and cell body. In an earlier study we demonstrated that this second pool, referred to as axonal-APP (Ax-APP), is present in the vicinity of the plasma membrane and colocalizes only partially with clathrin (Allinquant, B., Moya, K. L., Bouillot, C., and Prochiantz, A.(1.Allinquant B. Moya K.L. Bouillot C. Prochiantz A. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 6842-6854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) J. Neurosci. 14, 6842-6854). In this report, using immunocytochemical and fractionation techniques we demonstrate that Ax-APP is present in microdomains enriched in the glypiated glycoprotein F3. The F3/Ax-APP microdomains are resistant to nonionic detergents and sediment at low density on a sucrose gradient. The two latter properties are reminiscent of those of caveolae, a type of plasmalemmal vesicle found in several cell types, but not previously described in the nervous system due to the absence of caveolin in neurons. The presence of Ax-APP in caveolae-like vesicles raises the possibility that APP serves as a transmembrane signaling molecule for GPI-linked glycoproteins.

Brain APP is expressed during embryogenesis and in the adult by several cell types, including neurons (for review, see Selkoe et al.(38.Selkoe D.J. Annu. Rev.

Although the exact physiological functions of APP are poorly understood, a large body of observations supports a role in cell interactions both during development and in the adult. The suggestion that it performs an important function in development is supported by the following facts. First, the expression of reporter plasmids under the control of the APP promoter can be regulated by developmental genes of the Hox family (Violette et al., 46.Violette S.M. Shashikant C.S. Salbaum J.M. Belting H.-G. Wang J.C.H. Ruddle F.H. Proc. Nal. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3805-3809Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Second, APP expression increases with neuronal differentiation (Hung et al., 19.Hung A.Y. Koo E.H. Haass C. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9439-9443Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Third, APP is rapidly transported down the axons to their terminals where it might be secreted (Koo et al., 22.Koo E.H. Sisodia S.S. Archer D.R. Martin L.J. Weidemann A. Beyreuther K. Fischer P. Masters C.L. Price D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 17386-17389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a synaptic function, in particular during synaptogenesis. Finally, several observations support a role for APP in neurite outgrowth, and the decreased rate of neurite elongation following APP down-regulation lends weight to the latter hypothesis (Small et al., 41.Small D.H. Nurcombe V. Reed G. Clarris H. Moir R. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 2117-2127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Jin et al., 20.Jin L.W. Ninomiya H. Roch J.M. Schubert D. Masliah E.

Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 919-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In neurons in vitro the predominant APP isoform has 695 amino acids and is found both in the somatodendritic and axonal compartments (Allinquant et al., 1994). In vivo, it is enriched at the synaptic level where its extracellular domain is released. The release of APP ectodomain requires that it be cleaved within the βA4 sequence and is therefore incompatible with the production of the amyloid peptide. The formation and the secretion of the amyloid peptide βA4 has been shown to involve reendocytosis (Koo and Squazzo, 1994). We recently reported that, in embryonic neurons differentiating in vitro, two intracellular pools of APP coexist. A first pool is present in the entire cell (soma, dendrites, and axon) and is seen only upon strong permeabilization with detergents. A second pool, localized primarily in the axon and cell body and almost absent in the dendrites, can be observed upon mild fixation and without detergent treatment, suggesting a localization in the vicinity of the axonal membrane (Allinquant et al., 1994). In our culture conditions, the latter pool referred to as Ax-APP (for axon-specific) is not detected on nonfixed live cells, suggesting that it is not directly exposed to the extracellular medium or that it is present in a vesicular compartment that exchanges very rapidly with the plasma membrane (Allinquant et al., 7.Chang W.J. Ying Y. Rothberg K.G. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Gambliel H.A. De Gunzburg J. Mumby S.M. Gilman A.G. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Ax-APP represents only a small percentage of total APP. Interestingly, double immunostaining experiments indicate that a significant amount of Ax-APP does not colocalize with clathrin (Allinquant et al., 1994), therefore suggesting that some Ax-APP is present in a plasmalemmal compartment that differs both from the plasma membrane and from clathrin-coated vesicles, and it is found in the soma and axon but not in the dendrites. It has been speculated that axons and dendrites could be the neuronal equivalents of the epithelial cell apical and basolateral domains, respectively (Dotti and Simons, 10.Dotti C. Simons K. Cell. 1990; 62: 63-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The imperfect colocalization of Ax-APP and clathrin, as well as its highly polarized distribution in the axon, prompted us to examine whether Ax-APP was associated with GPI-linked molecules present in sphingolipid-rich microdomains and preferentially addressed to the apical compartment of polarized epithelia (Anderson, 4.Anderson R.G.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 647-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). To examine this possibility we have compared the distribution and fractionation characteristics of Ax-APP and F3, a GPI-linked neuronal glycoprotein (Gennarini et al., 15.Gennarini G. Cibelli G. Rougon G. Mattei M.G. Goridis C. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 775-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 16.Gennarini G. Durbec P. Boned A. Rougon G. Goridis C. Neuron. 1991; 6: 595-606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Our results confirm that Ax-APP and F3 glycoprotein are present in membranous microdomains with similar biophysical characteristics. Cortical neurons from embryonic day 16-17 rat fetuses were prepared as described previously (Lafont et al., 25.Lafont F. Rouget M. Triller A. Prochiantz A. Rousselet A. Development. 1992; 114: 17-29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated on polyornithine (1.5 μg/ml)-coated glass coverslips (immunocytochemistry, 50 × 103 cells/cm2) or plastic culture dishes (biochemistry, 15-30 × 104 cells/cm2) and incubated in a chemically defined medium free of serum and supplemented with hormones, proteins, and salts. Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK) cells were grown to confluence on 100-mm dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Neurons were fixed at 5 days in vitro with paraformaldehyde (4% in PBS, pH 7.4) for 30 min at room temperature without further permeabilization (Allinquant et al., 1994). Anti-APP mAb 22C11 and anti-clathrin (Boehringer-Mannheim) were used at 5 and 0.5 μg/ml, respectively. The polyclonal anti-F3 antibody (Gennarini et al., 1989) was diluted 50-fold. The appropriate fluorescein isothiocyanate- or Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Amersham Corp. (Paris, France) or from Southern Biotechnology Associates. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and immunoblotting on cellulose or Immobilon (Millipore) were performed as described in Allinquant et al.,(1994). The presence of the epitopes was revealed with alkaline phosphatase- or peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Southern Biotechnology Associates). In the latter case peroxidase was revealed using the chemiluminescence protocol according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Amersham Corp.). Neurons (150 × 106) after 5 to 7 days in vitro were rinsed twice with PBS, pH 7.4, scraped, and washed once in the same buffer. After centrifugation at 800 rpm for 5 min, cells were resuspended in 2 ml of Mes-buffered saline (MBS; 25 mM Mes, pH 6.5, 0.15 M NaCl) containing 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors (1 mM Pefablock, 1 μM leupeptin, 1 μM pepstatin, 0.3 μM aprotinin, 1.3 μM α2-microglobulin). The extract was homogenized through a combitip (10 passages) and a 22-gauge needle (15 passages) and processed as described by Sargiacomo et al., (36.Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z. Lisanti M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 789-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). The homogenate was adjusted to 40% sucrose and placed at the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube. A 5-30% linear sucrose gradient in MBS without Triton X-100, was formed above the homogenate. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 18 h at 4°C, in a TST 14-41 rotor (Kontron Instruments), 1-ml fractions were harvested from top to bottom, diluted with MBS plus 1% Triton X-100, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. Pellets were then resuspended in different buffers (depending on the subsequent experiment). Pellets (see above) were resuspended in 100 μl of MBS, pH 7.4, containing 0.5 unit/ml phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C (PI-PLC; Immunotech) and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 1 h at 4°C in a Sigma 2K15 centrifuge, pellets and supernatants were separated by centrifugation and solubilized, and their content was analyzed by PAGE. Confocal laser microscopy was performed on a Molecular Dynamics 1000 system using dedicated image software. Optical sections of 0.5-μm increment were scanned for double fluorescent-labeled samples with appropriate filters. Gradient fractions were loaded onto carbo-coated grids and fixed for 10 min with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4. The grids were washed in PBS and incubated with 100 mM NH4Cl for 30 min, and the nonspecific sites were blocked in 0.2% PBS-gelatin for 30 min. The primary antibodies were incubated at room temperature for 2 h. After rinsing in PBS, the samples were incubated with gold-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies diluted to 1/50 in PBS-gelatin. After rinsing five times the grids were stained with 2% uranyl acetate and examined on a Philips 400 electron microscope. After 5 days in vitro, the cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde and immunostained with the anti-APP antibody without permeabilization, a procedure that gives access only to Ax-APP and does not allow revelation of the second pool of APP present in all compartments (Allinquant et al., 1994). Approximately half of the cortical neurons express Ax-APP and the staining is not uniform since, within the axons, Ax-APP-positive and -negative regions alternate. To determine the fraction of axons that coexpress Ax-APP and F3 or clathrin, cells fixed as above were doubled stained with anti-APP and anti-clathrin or anti-F3 antibodies. In three separate experiments in which approximately 1000 neurons were analyzed, we observed that 50% of the axons expressing Ax-APP also expressed F3 and/or clathrin. As illustrated in the confocal sections of Fig. 1 AB, expression of Ax-APP and F3 was often superimposed. In contrast, the colocalization of clathrin and Ax-APP was limited (Fig. 1, C and D) and not very different from that of F3 and clathrin (Fig. 1, E and F). These patterns of colocalization were specific for the axon and not observed in the cell body in which “Ax-APP” colocalized equally well with the two markers (not shown). Virtually no staining was seen in the dendrites which do not express Ax-APP (Allinquant et al., 14.Fra A.M. Williamson E. Simons K. Parton R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30745-30748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggested that, at least in axons, a subfraction of APP and F3 are present in the same membranous structures. GPI-anchored molecules “en route” for the cell surface are normally associated with a class of vesicles enriched with sphingolipids resulting in two distinct properties. They are resistant to nonionic detergents and their density in a sucrose gradient is lighter than that of regular plasma membranes (Sargiacomo et al., 1993). We thus investigated if a fraction of transmembrane APP could be recovered in Triton X-100-insoluble F3-containing fractions, and compared the distribution of APP and F3 on a sucrose density gradient. In extracts from neuronal cultures at 5 days in vitro, the particulate fraction retains almost all transmembrane APP and solubilization of particulate APP with Triton X-100, releases more than 90% of the molecule, meaning that approximately 10% of total APP remains insoluble (Allinquant et al., 1994). APP present in this Triton X-100-resistant fraction can be visualized by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, and Western blot with mAb 22C11 (Fig. 2A). As expected, significant amounts of F3 are also observed in this detergent-insoluble fraction (Fig. 2A). Triton-insoluble complexes from neuronal cultures at 5-7 days in vitro were prepared in 40% sucrose and loaded under a linear sucrose gradient (5-30%). After centrifugation, the material was separated in three main fractions, an insoluble pellet at the bottom of the tube and two opalescent bands in the 40 and 10-20% sucrose regions. In some cases the lighter band was split into two bands with very similar densities. Similar results were obtained with the 22C11 antibody and with antibody CT15 that specifically recognizes true APP and not its APP-like variants (Sisodia et al., 40.Sisodia S.S. Koo E.H. Hoffman P.N. Perry G. Price D.L. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3136-3142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Twelve different 1-ml gradient fractions were collected, from top to bottom, diluted in Triton X-100-containing buffer and centrifuged at high speed. The resulting pellets were analyzed by PAGE and immunoblotting. As seen in the gradient of Fig. 2B, the GPI-linked F3 glycoprotein was highly enriched in low density fraction 7 (18% sucrose) with some immunoreactivity also present in fractions 3 and 4 (12% sucrose). In comparison, APP distributed equally between the clathrin-enriched fraction 12 (40% sucrose, Fig. 2, B and C) and the low density fractions 3, 4, 7, and 8 that contain F3. It is noteworthy that some clathrin was also present in fraction 7. Although the gradient of Fig. 2B is representative of most experiment, it was also found that the distributions of light APP and F3 could be more widely spread (between fractions 5 and 7, e.g.Fig. 3). Fig. 3 illustrates that treating low density fractions 5-7 with PI-PLC, an enzyme that hydrolyzes the GPI-link and thus solubilizes glypiated proteins from the membranes releases a fraction of the F3 glycoprotein. This incomplete hydrolysis probably reflects that a fraction of the molecules is not accessible to the enzyme. As expected for a trans-membrane protein, APP was not solubilized at all upon incubation with PI-PLC. F3-glycoprotein and APP were quantitatively solubilized by the addition of n-octylglucoside (not shown). To ensure that our protocol allowed for the isolation of vesicles of a density expected for noncoated microdomains enriched in GPI-anchored proteins (caveolae), we applied it to MDCK cells. As demonstrated in Fig. 4A, fractions 14-7 are highly enriched in caveolin/VIP 21, a specific marker of caveolae in this cell type. Electron microscopy of these low density fractions 14-7 from MDCK cells show a heterogenous population of membrane fragments and vesicular structures with curved shapes and stria. All these structures contain caveolin as demonstrated by immunocytochemistry (Fig. 4, B and C), therefore confirming that fractions 14-7 prepared from MDCK cells are highly enriched in caveolae. Whole mount electron microscopy of low density fractions 5-7 from neuronal cultures shows a heterogenous population of curved shape vesicular structures (100-500 nm), either isolated or grouped with two to three identical elements and exhibiting a striated coat (Fig. 5). The morphological aspect of these structures is very similar to that observed from MDCK or smooth muscle cell caveolae (Chang et al., 1994). Immunogold double immunocytochemistry demonstrates the presence of APP and F3 associated with these structures. Some of these “caveolae-like” vesicles can be double-labeled with the anti-F3 and anti-APP antibodies (Fig. 5, B and D), demonstrating that the two antigenes can colocalize on the same structures. In this report we demonstrate, using immunocytochemical and biochemical approaches, that in rat forebrain neurons differentiating in vitro, a fraction of APP, enriched in the axon, is colocalized with the glypiated F3 adhesion molecule. Our results also suggest that the neurons contain a population of vesicles that share some of the properties assigned to caveolae in other cell types and that F3 and APP are present in these vesicles herein called microdomains. The results presented here are not in contradiction with other reports demonstrating that most APP molecules are associated with clathrin-coated vesicles (Ferreira et al., 13.Ferreira A. Caceres A. Kosik K. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3112-3123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, Ax-APP as defined by the fraction that is observed upon mild paraformaldehyde fixation is present only in the cell body and in the axon, and not in dendrites. Furthermore, Triton X-100 permeabilization allows the revelation of another very abundant pool of APP present in all cell compartments (Allinquant et al., 1994). From our own immunocytochemical and fractionation experiments we estimate that Ax-APP associated with the microdomains corresponds to 1-5% of total neuronal APP. The properties of the microdomains containing Ax-APP are reminiscent of those reported for a class of vesicles called caveolae present in several cell types, but not described in neurons nor in the nervous system, due to the absence of caveolin, in neural tissue (Rothberg et al., 35.Rothberg K. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y.S. Glenney J.R. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1992; 68: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar; Dupree et al., 11.Dupree P. Parton R.G. Raposo G. Kurzchalia T.V. Simons K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1597-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar; Kurzchalia et al., 23.Kurzchalia T.V. Dupree P. Monier S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In spite of the absence of caveolin, the microdomains that contain Ax-APP share the following traits with bona fide caveolae. First, Ax-APP is enriched in the axon and virtually absent in dendrites, two compartments which, according to Dotti and Simons (1990), are the equivalent, in neurons, of the MDCK apical and basolateral domains, respectively. Significant amounts of Ax-APP colocalize in light immunocytochemistry with F3, a GPI-linked glycoprotein (Gennarini et al., 1989) but not with clathrin a marker of the coated vesicle endocytic pathway. This distribution of Ax-APP is interesting in the context of several reports suggesting that glypiated proteins are enriched in caveolae and, in general, addressed to the apical compartment of polarized cells (Lisanti et al., 26.Lisanti M.P. Sargiacomo M. Graeve L. Saltiel A.R. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9557-9561Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 27.Lisanti M.P. Caras I.W. Davitz M.A. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2145-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar; Brown et al., 6.Brown D.A. Crise B. Rose J.K. Science. 1989; 245: 1499-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Second, APP is present in a Triton-resistant and light density membrane fraction also enriched in F3. The comigration of APP and F3 in fractions 3, 4, 7, and 8 (Fig. 2), added to the immunocytochemical data discussed in the preceding paragraph, and the APP-F3 double labeling in electron microscopy, demonstrates that these fractions are enriched with Ax-APP. Indeed, APP was also retrieved in heavier fractions that contain the bulk of clathrin, suggesting that the protocol of extraction before sucrose separation spares a significant quantity of coated vesicles or of membranes derived from coated vesicles. The presence of small quantities of clathrin in fractions 7 and 8 could reflect the actual presence of clathrin-coated vesicles in the light fractions, and possibly the presence of F3 in such vesicles. Other glypiated molecules have already been observed in coated vesicles (5or et al., 1994; Shyng et al., 39.Shyng S.L. Heuser J.E. Harris D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1239-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). At last, fusion between the two endocytic pathways leading to multivesicular bodies could explain the presence of some clathrin in the enriched-F3 fractions. (Turek et al., 45.Turek J.J. Leamon C.P. Low P.S. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 423-430PubMed Google Scholar). Third, when the same protocol of fractionation was applied to MDCK cells, the membranous structures resistant to Triton and present in the lighter fractions are labeled with anti-caveolin. In the case of MDCK-derived fractions all structures examined by electron microscopy present traits characteristic of caveolae, in particular striated figures and caveolin. In the case of neuron-derived fractions, observations in electron microscopy demonstrate a colocalization of APP and F3 and a striated coat identical to that observed in MDCK or smooth muscle (Chang et al., 1994) caveolae. The possibility that Ax-APP could be localized in structures resembling caveolae raises the possibility that, in analogy with epithelial cells (Smart et al. 42.Smart E.J. Foster D.C. Ying Y.S. Kamen B.A. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholara), protein kinase C activity might affect the subcellular localization of APP. We did not find that protein kinase C activators or inhibitors modify the percentage of axons with strong Ax-APP staining or the amount of Ax-APP in the Triton-resistant light density fractions (not shown). In this context it should be noted that an absence of effect of protein kinase C activity on caveolea endocytosis has been observed by Parton et al.(34.Parton R.G. Joggerst B. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1199-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Taken together these data infer that Ax-APP is present in vesicular microdomains that share several properties with caveolae, with the notable exception that they lack caveolin. Whether the vesicular structure can be maintained in the absence of caveolin, a possibility suggested by Smart et al. (43.Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Conrad P.A. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1185-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholarb) and/or is permitted by the presence of other nonidentified polypeptides has not been investigated. In fact, similar microdomains devoid of caveolin have recently been described in lymphocyte cell lines and in neuroblastoma cells (Fra et al., 1994; Gorodinsky et Harris, 17.Gorodinsky A. Harris D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) and in membrane fractions from mouse cerebellum (Olive et al., 33.Olive S. Dubois C. Schachner M. Rougon G. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 2307-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The identification of a transmembrane molecule, such as APP, in a compartment enriched in GPI-linked molecules raises the possiblity that Ax-APP could serve as a signaling intermediate following the interaction of the glypiated proteins with their ligands to deliver an intracytoplasmic signal. In the context of neurite elongation, it is interesting that F3, NCAM-120, and Thy-1, three GPI-anchored glycoproteins present at the axonal surface, can increase (F3, NCAM) or decrease (Thy-1) the rate of axonal elongation (Durbec et al., 12.Durbec P. Gennarini G. Goridis C. Rougon G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 877-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar; Doherty et al., 9.Doherty P. Barton C.H. Dickson G. Seaton P. Rowett L.H. Moore S.E.

Moris R. Nature. 1992; 355: 745-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). It is also noteworthy that APP can be found associated with Go, a major trimeric GTP-binding protein (Nishimoto et al., 31.Nishimoto I Okamoto T. Matsuura Y. Takahashi S. Okamoto T. Murayama Y. Ogata E. Nature. 1993; 362: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar; Okamoto et al., 32.Okamoto T. Takeda S. Murayama Y. Ogata E. Nishimoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4205-4208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) involved in neurite elongation (Brabet et al., 5.Brabet P. Pantaloni C. Rodriguez M. Martinez J. Bockaert J. Homburger V. J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 1310-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In a recent report, we have demonstrated that APP down-regulation decreases the rate of elongation of both axons and dendrites (Allinquant et al., 1995). Since Ax-APP is almost absent in dendrites, its implication in axonal elongation would be another indication that dendritic and axonal elongation are not regulated by the same sequence of events (reviewed in Lafont and Prochiantz(24.Lafont F. Prochiantz A. Perspect. Dev. Neurobiol. 1994; 2: 259-268PubMed Google Scholar)). A specific role of Ax-APP in the formation and the maturation of the axon or of its terminal, during synaptogenesis, is in agreement with the fact that APP is transported rapidly in the axon (Koo et al., 1990; Morin et al., 1993; Moya et al., 30.Moya K.L. Benowitz L.I. Schneider G.E. Allinquant B. Dev. Biol. 1994; 161: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and that Ax-APP is significantly increased upon calcium influx (Allinquant et al., 1994). Finally, the presence of APP in microdomains is also interesting in terms of our understanding of its processing. APP contains a reendocytosis signal compatible with reinternalization (Chen et al., 8.Chen W.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3116-3123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Haass et al., 18.Haass C. Koo E.H. Mellon A. Hung A.Y. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1992; 357: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar), an event associated with the production and release of the βA4 peptide (Koo and Squazzo, 1994). In cells where caveolae have been observed the molecules associated with these structures can be delivered to multivesicular bodies and to lysozomes (Turek et al., 1993; Parton et al., 1994; Schnitzer et al., 37.Schnitzer J.E. Oh P. Pinney E. Allard J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1217-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). Therefore, and as suggested by a recent report from Amaratunga and Fine(3.Amaratunga A. Fine R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17268-17272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the presence in the axon of microdomains that contain Ax-APP and share distinct properties with caveolae might indicate the existence of an axon-specific pathway for the production and release of amyloidogenic βA4 peptide. We thank Françoise Mongiot for help with the electron microscopy. We express our gratitude to Dr. S. Sisodia for his gift of an APP-CT15 antibody."
https://openalex.org/W2007343054,"Mono ADP-ribosylation is a posttranslational protein modification that has been implicated in the regulation of key biological functions in bacteria as well as in animals. Recently, the first cDNAs for eucaryotic mono(ADPribosyl)transferases were cloned and found to exhibit significant sequence similarity only to one other known protein, the T cell differentiation antigen Rt6. In this paper we describe secondary structure analyses of Rt6 and related proteins and show conserved structure motifs and amino acid residues consistent with a common ancestry of these eucaryotic proteins and bacterial ADP-ribosyltransferases. Moreover, we have expressed soluble mouse Rt6-1 and Rt6-2 gene products in which C-terminal tags (FLAG-His6) replace the native glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor signal sequences. Purified recombinant Rt6-2, but not Rt6-1, shows NAD+ glycohydrolase activity, which is inhibited by the arginine analogue agmatine. Immunoprecipitation of recombinant Rt6-1 and Rt6-2 with anti-FLAG M2 antibody followed by incubation with [32P]NAD+ leads to rapid and covalent incorporation of radioactivity into the light chain of the M2 antibody. The bound label is resistant to treatment with HgCl2 but sensitive to NH2OH, characteristic of arginine-linked ADP-ribosylation. These results demonstrate that Rt6-1 and Rt6-2 possess the enzymatic activities typical for NAD+-dependent arginine/protein mono(ADPribosyl)transferases (EC 2.4.2.31). They are the first such enzymes to be molecularly characterized in the immune system."
https://openalex.org/W2036702421,"Regulation of expression of the scavenger receptor is thought to play a critical role in the accumulation of lipid by macrophages in atherosclerosis. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) has been shown to suppress macrophage scavenger receptor function (van Lenten, B. J., and Fogelman, A. M.(1992) J. Immunol. 148, 112-116). However, the mechanism by which it does so is unknown. We evaluated the mechanism by which TNF-α inhibited macrophage scavenger receptor surface expression and binding of acetylated low density lipoprotein (aLDL). Binding of aLDL to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-differentiated THP-1 macrophages was suppressed by TNF-α in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition of aLDL binding was paralleled by a reduction of macrophage scavenger receptor protein as detected by the Western blot. TNF-α partially decreased macrophage scavenger receptor mRNA steady state levels in PMA-differentiated THP-1 macrophages, a result that was confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. PMA increased the luciferase activity driven by the macrophage scavenger receptor promoter in the transfected cells, whereas TNF-α partially reduced luciferase activity. However, macrophage scavenger receptor mRNA half-life was dramatically reduced in cells treated with TNF-α relative to untreated cells. Reduction in macrophage scavenger receptor message in response to TNF-α was dependent on new protein synthesis because it was blocked by cycloheximide. These results indicate that TNF-α regulates macrophage scavenger receptor expression in PMA-differentiated THP-1 macrophages by transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms but principally by destabilization of macrophage scavenger receptor mRNA. Regulation of expression of the scavenger receptor is thought to play a critical role in the accumulation of lipid by macrophages in atherosclerosis. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) has been shown to suppress macrophage scavenger receptor function (van Lenten, B. J., and Fogelman, A. M.(1992) J. Immunol. 148, 112-116).

Unlike the LDL receptor, expression of the macrophage scavenger receptor is not down-regulated by high levels of intracellular cholesterol. Because of the potential role of this receptor in mediating cholesteryl ester accumulation by macrophages during atherosclerosis, the regulation of expression of these receptors is of considerable important and interest. Circulating monocytes express little or no macrophage scavenger receptor, but receptor mRNA and surface expression are dramatically increased because monocytes differentiate into macrophages in tissue culture. Treatment of monocytes or THP-1 cells (a human monocytic cell line) with phorbol-12 myristate 13-acetate (PMA) also promotes differentiation and induces macrophage scavenger receptor expression(3.Via D.P.

Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a potent activator of mononuclear phagocytes, can inhibit scavenger receptor activity in human macrophages(13.van Lenten B.J. Fogelman A.M. Seager J. Ribi E. Haberland M. Edwards P. J. Immunol. 1985; 134: 3718-3721PubMed Google Scholar). Most of the inhibitory activity of LPS on the macrophage scavenger receptor could be blocked with an antibody to TNF-α(1.van Lenten B.J. Fogelman A.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 112-116PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that TNF-α, which is synthesized in response to LPS, mediated the LPS effect. However, the molecular mechanism(s) by which TNF-α inhibits macrophage scavenger receptor activity have not been elucidated. In this study, we demonstrate that TNF-α inhibits macrophage scavenger receptor binding activity, surface protein expression, and mRNA levels, with subsequent down-regulation of macrophage scavenger receptor-mediated ACAT activity and cholesterol esterification in PMA-differentiated THP-1 macrophages. Although macrophage scavenger receptor transcriptional activity was modestly reduced in response to TNF-α, in the presence of actinomycin D, macrophage scavenger receptor mRNA half-life was significantly reduced, implying that TNF-α inhibits macrophage scavenger receptor expression principally by post-transcriptional decreases in macrophage scavenger receptor mRNA stability.

Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar) yielding 125I-aLDL with specific activity between 120 and 220 cpm/ng protein. The binding of 125I-aLDL was performed according to published methods(22.Goldstein J. Basu S. Brown M. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar). 125I-aLDL was added to cells in the presence or the absence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled aLDL at 4°C. After 2 h on a rotary shaker, the cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin and then washed two times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were solubilized in 0.2 M NaOH, and radioactivity was quantified in a Searle 1185 gamma counter (Searle Radiographics, Inc., IL). Nonspecifically bound 125I-aLDL was determined by incubating cells with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled aLDL. Specific aLDL binding was determined by subtracting nonspecifically bound counts from total counts. Binding was normalized to protein content of the cell layer. Total RNA was isolated by the guanidium isothiocyanate method(23.Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5894-5898Crossref Scopus (16608) Google Scholar).

Gonzalez (Hahnemann University, Philadelphia, PA). RNA from Northern blots was quantified using a PhosphorImager® (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA), and normalized by comparison with mRNA of 28 S ribosomal RNA, a constitutively expressed gene. -Cells were subpassaged the day before transfection and replaced with fresh medium. The transfection method is described elsewhere(27.Dorsett D.L. Keshet I. Winocour E. J. Virol. 1983; 48: 218-228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the plasmid of macrophage scavenger receptor promoter in luciferase reporter gene, such as plasmids HACLDL Xba-A1-luc promoter and HACLDL Xba-A1-luc Enhancer, respectively (a gift from Dr. C. Glass, University of California, San Diego, CA)(28.Wu H. Moulton K. Horvai A. Parik S. Glass C.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2129-2139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were co-transfected with β-galactosidase as to monitor the transfection efficiency. Transfected cells were treated with various reagents as indicated, and luciferase activities were measured according to the method previously described(25.Hsu H.-Y. Nicholson A.C. Hajjar D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9213-9220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase assay was followed the protocol supplied by Promega Co. Acid (lysosomal) CE hydrolase activity was assayed at pH 3.9(29.Haley N.J. Fowler S. deDuve C. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 961-969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and, neutral (cytoplasmic) CE hydrolase activity was assayed at pH 7.0(30.Hajjar D.P. Weksler B. J. Lipid Res. 1983; 24: 1176-1185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ACAT activity in homogenates was measured as an index of CE synthetic activity by determining the rate of CE synthesis from [1-14C]oleoyl CoA using exogenous free cholesterol incorporated into unilamellar liposomes containing egg phosphatidylcholine(31.Hajjar D.P.

THP-1 cells were exposed to a [3H]oleic acid (sp. act. 40,000 dpm/nmol)/albumin mixture (final concentration, 100 μM oleate, 20 μM albumin in the absence of fetal calf serum) for 24 h at 37°C. Cell lipids were extracted, and radioactivity in CE was assessed after separation by TLC as described(32.Hajjar D.P. Wight T. Smith S. Am. J. Pathol. 1980; 100: 683-705PubMed Google Scholar). The method for immunoblotting is described elsewhere(33.Margolis B. Rhee S.G. Felder S. Mervic M. Lyall R. Levitzki A. Ullrich A. Zilberstein A. Schlessinger J.

Briefly, THP-1 monocytes treated with PMA (150 nM), or PMA (150 nM) + TNF-α (200 units/ml) for 24 h. Whole cell lysates (120 μg of protein) were solubilized in SDS sample buffer with mild reducing conditions (boiling for 5 min in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol). Protein was loaded in each lane, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to an Immobilon membrane. The presence of macrophage scavenger receptor protein was examined by incubation the membrane with hSRI-2 anti-macrophage scavenger receptor peptide antibody (a rabbit polyclonal anti-human macrophage scavenger receptor antibody), which recognizes the collagen-like domain that is shared between types SR-AI and SR-AII macrophage scavenger receptor proteins(14.Naito M. Suzuki H. Mori T. Matsumoto A. Kodama T. Takahashi K. Am. J. Pathol. 1992; 141: 591-599PubMed Google Scholar). Blots were stained with a donkey anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate. Protein visualization was performed with Renaissance®, DuPont Western blot Chemiluminescence Reagent, (DuPont NEN). Manufacturer-provided protocols were followed. The reagents in RNA PCR kit for RT-PCR amplification were purchased from Perkin-Elmer. The oligonucleotides for the primers (26.Matsumoto A. Naito M. Itakura H. Ikemoto S. Asaoka H. Hayakawa I.

Thromb. 1994; 14: 798-806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the procedures for RT-PCR amplification were as described (35.Geng Y.-J. Kodama T. Hansson G.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 798-806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with some modification. After electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels, the PCR products were stained with ethidium bromide and visualized on a UV transilluminator. Quantitative analysis of PCR products was performed by using Southern blot, and the membranes were hybridized with the 32P-labeled internal probe as described (35.Geng Y.-J. Kodama T. Hansson G.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 798-806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and quantified using a PhosphorImager®. Differences in intensity of PCR product bands were confirmed by 10-fold serial dilution of cDNA samples to ensure comparability and that the plateau of amplification had not been reached as described(36.Villiers W.J.S.D. Fraser I.P. Hughes D.A. Doyle A.G. Gordon S. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 705-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Protein amounts were determined by the method of Lowry et al.(37.Lowry O. Rosebrough N. Farr A. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the Bio-Rad protein assay. Statistical differences between the experimental groups were examined by analysis of variance, and statistical significance was determined at a p level of <0.05. All data are expressed as the means ± S.E. PMA and M-CSF equivalently increased the specific binding (4°C) of 125I-aLDL to THP-1 macrophages compared with untreated THP-1 monocytes (Fig. 1A). Co-treatment of PMA- or M-CSF-differentiated THP-1 cells with TNF-α reduced specific binding of 125I-aLDL to baseline (control) levels (Fig. 1A) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2). The effect of TNF-α on 125I-aLDL binding resulted from a decrease in the number of binding sites (Bmax) without significant change in receptor affinity (Kd). Scatchard analysis (Fig. 1B) demonstrated that PMA or M-CSF increased Bmax by 6- or 7-fold, respectively, as compared with undifferentiated THP-1 monocytes (undifferentiated THP-1 monocytes (control) = 1.66 × 105 sites/cell; PMA-differentiated THP-1 macrophages) = 9.71 × 105 sites/cell; M-CSF treated THP-1 cells = 10.6 × 105 sites/cell). The Bmax of undifferentiated THP-1 monocytes (control), PMA-differentiated THP-1 macrophages treated with TNF-α (PMA + TNF-α), as well as THP-1 monocytes treated with TNF-α and M-CSF-differentiated THP-1 macrophages treated with TNF-α, (data not shown) were equivalent (each approximately 1.23-1.66 × 105 sites/cell). Kd values were not significantly altered by any treatment (Fig. 1B).Figure 2:Dose response effect of TNF-α on aLDL binding in PMA-differentiated THP-1 macrophages. PMA-differentiated THP-1 macrophages were incubated with varying concentrations of TNF-α (1-300 units/ml). Specific aLDL binding (125I-aLDL, 20 μg/ml) was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Western analysis (Fig. 3) revealed that little or no macrophage scavenger receptor protein was expressed in THP-1 monocytes. PMA-differentiated THP-1 macrophages expressed scavenger receptor protein, but TNF-α suppressed the expression of macrophage scavenger receptor protein when THP-1 cells co-incubated with PMA. TNF-α did not cause any signs of general cellular toxicity. Cells treated with PMA/TNF-α remained adherent and morphologically similar to PMA-treated cells (THP-1 macrophages). Furthermore, there was no decrease in protein content or cell number or any increase in the uptake of trypan blue (data not shown). To dissect the molecular mechanisms by which TNF-α suppressed macrophage scavenger receptor protein expression, we initially examined the influence of TNF-α on macrophage scavenger receptor mRNA levels. Northern blot analyses of PMA-differentiated THP-1 macrophages revealed a time-dependent increase in macrophage scavenger receptor mRNA steady state levels in response to PMA (Fig. 4, A and B). Expression peaked at 48 h. Macrophage scavenger receptor mRNA was not detected in undifferentiated THP-1 monocytes (not treated with PMA), and TNF-α had no effect on this baseline expression. TNF-α decreased macrophage scavenger receptor mRNA expression by 80 (at 20 h) and 70% (at 48 h), respectively, in PMA-differentiated cells relative to PMA-differentiated cells not treated with TNF-α (THP-1 macrophages) (Fig. 4, A and B). RT-PCR demonstrated that TNF-α decreased both human macrophage scavenger receptor types SR-AI and SR-AII mRNA in PMA-treated THP-1 macrophages (Fig. 4C). Dose response experiments showed that maximal inhibition of macrophage scavenger receptor mRNA levels (similar to macrophage scavenger receptor surface expression as determined by aLDL binding) by TNF-α occurred at 200 units/ml (data not shown). To examine if decreased macrophage scavenger receptor mRNA expression in response to TNF-α in PMA-differentiated THP-1 macrophages resulted from decreased transcription of the macrophage scavenger receptor gene, assays for luciferase activity driven by macrophage scavenger receptor gene promoter were performed. THP-1 cells were transiently transfected by the DEAE-dextran sulfate method with plasmid MSR-Luc luciferase construct consisting of 5′ upstream sequences of the macrophage scavenger receptor promoter region. Luciferase activity was measured in untreated cells, cells treated with PMA, and cells treated with PMA + TNF-α (200 units/ml). PMA induced luciferase activity driven by the macrophage scavenger receptor gene promoter by 3.5-fold. TNF-α reduced luciferase activity by 20% after 12 h (Fig. 5). To determine if TNF-α reduced the level of macrophage scavenger receptor mRNA by increasing its rate of degradation, we measured the half-life of macrophage scavenger receptor mRNA in the presence of the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D (5 μg/ml). TNF-α shortened the half-life of macrophage scavenger receptor mRNA from 40 ± 3 to 10 ± 2 h (Fig. 6, A, B, and C). Therefore, the reduction in macrophage scavenger receptor message by TNF-α appears to be mediated principally by a post-transcriptional mechanism, namely, accelerating the degradation of macrophage scavenger receptor mRNA. Moreover, incubation of cells with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) prevented the decrease of macrophage scavenger receptor mRNA at both 3 and 6 h in TNF-α-treated samples (Fig. 7). These findings suggest that the effect(s) of TNF-α on macrophage scavenger receptor mRNA destabilization requires new protein synthesis.Figure 7:Northern blots showing reversal by cycloheximide of the destabilizing effects of TNF-α on MSR mRNA. PMA-differentiated THP-1 macrophages were treated with cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) for 1 h before the addition of TNF-α (200 units/ml). PMA-differentiated THP-1 macrophages (PMA (Control)), PMA-differentiated THP-1 macrophages treated with TNF-α (PMA + TNF-α), and PMA-differentiated THP-1 macrophages treated with TNF-α and incubated with cycloheximide (PMA + TNF-α + CHX) were harvested 3 and 6 h after exposure to TNF-α. Northern blots were hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNAs of MSR and 28 S ribosomal RNA, quantitated by PhosphorImager®, and normalized by comparison with 28 S. All of the data are expressed as a percentage relative to THP-1 macrophages (t = 3 h). The relative intensity of MSR mRNA is plotted against time. Pretreating THP-1 macrophages for 1 h with cycloheximide had no effect on the basal level of MSR mRNA (data not shown). Similar results were obtained in three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Lastly, we characterized the role of TNF-α in macrophage scavenger receptor-mediated CE metabolism by evaluating parameters of the CE cycle. ACAT activity (Fig. 8A) as well as esterification of free cholesterol with [3H]oleic acid to CE (Fig. 8B) were evaluated in PMA-differentiated THP-1 macrophages and PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells treated with TNF-α. TNF-α caused a significant (65%) reduction in ACAT activity and a similar decrease in the synthesis of nascent CE from free fatty acids as compared with untreated cells. These decreases paralleled the decrease in aLDL binding and most likely reflect a decrease in cholesterol delivery. Finally, the effects of TNF-α on CE hydrolase activities were measured, but no significant difference in acid CE hydrolase or neutral CE hydrolase activities in response to TNF-α was observed (data not shown). Expression of the macrophage scavenger receptor (acetylated LDL receptor) occurs as monocytes differentiate into macrophages in tissue culture over a period of several days, a process that mimics what is thought to occur as blood monocytes enter tissue to become tissue macrophages. These differentiation events can be mimicked by treating monocytes or some (but not all) monocytic cell lines, such as THP-1 cells, with PMA. PMA activates protein kinase C (8.Moulton K.S. Wu H.

Nature. 1990; 343: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). Fogelman and his colleagues had previously shown that LPS inhibited scavenger receptor activity in human macrophages (13.van Lenten B.J. Fogelman A.M. Seager J. Ribi E. Haberland M. Edwards P. J. Immunol. 1985; 134: 3718-3721PubMed Google Scholar) and that this inhibitory effect could be blocked with an antibody to TNF-α(1.van Lenten B.J. Fogelman A.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 112-116PubMed Google Scholar). We utilized PMA-differentiated THP-1 macrophages to evaluate the molecular mechanisms by which TNF-α inhibited macrophage scavenger receptor expression. The inhibitory effect of TNF-α on macrophage scavenger receptor expression and activity is comparable with previously demonstrated inhibitory effects of IFN-μ and TGF-β1 on the macrophage scavenger receptor. TNF-α inhibited macrophage scavenger receptor activity (aLDL binding, Fig. 1), protein synthesis (Fig. 3), and mRNA steady state levels (Fig. 4). TNF-α caused a 6-fold decrease in macrophage scavenger receptor number without affecting receptor affinity in PMA-differentiated THP-1 macrophages. IFN-μ inhibited macrophage scavenger receptor activity in human (5.Fong L. Fong A. Cooper A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11751-11760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or mouse monocyte-derived macrophages(6.Geng Y.-J. Hansson G.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1322-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). IFN-μ inhibited binding, internalization, and degradation of aLDL and reduced macrophage scavenger receptor mRNA steady state levels in comparison with untreated cells. This resulted in a reduction of cholesterol and CE content. Inhibition of binding resulted from decreased numbers of aLDL binding sites without a significant change in receptor affinity. Similarly, TGF-β1 inhibited macrophage scavenger receptor activity and mRNA in PMA-differentiated THP-1 macrophages (7.Bottalico L.A. Wager R.E. Agellon L.B. Assoian R.K. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22866-22871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and caused a decrease in binding of aLDL, degradation of aLDL, and ACAT activity relative to PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells. TGF-β1 caused a 2-fold decrease in macrophage scavenger receptor number as well as a decrease in receptor affinity. Inhibition of macrophage scavenger receptor expression in response to cytokines is cell-specific. TNF-α and IFN-μ increased scavenger receptor activity and mRNA in rabbit vascular smooth muscle cells (39.Li H.-M. Freeman M. Libby P. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 122-133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TGF-β, in combination with other cytokines, increased scavenger receptor activity in rabbit smooth muscle cells(40.Gong Q. Pitas R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21672-21678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The mechanism for the divergent effects of these cytokines on these two cell types (macrophages and smooth muscle cells) is unknown. However, it may reflect the fact that basal level of scavenger receptor expression in these two cell types is markedly different. Macrophages constitutively express macrophage scavenger receptor, whereas smooth muscle cells express little or no scavenger receptor mRNA or protein unless induced by cytokines, growth factors, or PMA(39.Li H.-M. Freeman M. Libby P. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 122-133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40.Gong Q. Pitas R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21672-21678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). ( 2H.-Y. Hsu, A. C. Nicholson, and D. P. Hajjar, unpublished data.) Macrophage scavenger receptor mRNA steady state levels in THP-1 monocytes were up-regulated by the addition of PMA; however, TNF-α decreased macrophage scavenger receptor mRNA steady state levels to about 30% of THP-1 macrophages (Fig. 4, A and B). Two isoforms of macrophage scavenger receptor, types SR-AI and SR-AII, on human macrophages (including PMA-differentiated THP-1 macrophages) are encoded by a single gene that gives rise to an alternatively spliced primary transcript(41.Freeman M. Ashkenas J. Rees D.J. Kingsley D.M. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8810-8814Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 42.Emi M. Asaoka A. Matsumoto A. Itakura H. Kurihara Y. Wada Y. Kanamori H. Yazaki Y. Takahashi E. Lepert M. Lalouel J.-M. Kodama T. Mukai T. J. Biol.

To further determine the effect of TNF-α on the differential expression of the macrophage scavenger receptor gene subtypes, RT-PCR amplification for human macrophage scavenger receptor types SR-AI and SR-AII in PMA-differentiated THP-1 macrophages was performed. We found that TNF-α destabilizes the expression of both macrophage scavenger receptor isoforms (SR-AI and SR-AII) during the differentiation of THP-1 monocytes to THP-1 macrophages (Fig. 4C). Glass and his colleagues have studied transcriptional regulation of the macrophage scavenger receptor gene in PMA-differentiated THP-1 macrophages(8.Moulton K.S. Wu H. Barnett J. Parthasarathy S. Glass C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8102-8106Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 28.Wu H. Moulton K. Horvai A. Parik S. Glass C.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2129-2139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44.Moulton K.S. Semple K. Wu H. Glass C.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4408-4418Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). They have identified transcription factor binding sites for AP-1, SP-1, and ets in the promoter of macrophage scavenger receptor gene from THP-1 macrophages(8.Moulton K.S. Wu H. Barnett J. Parthasarathy S. Glass C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8102-8106Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the mechanisms for developmental regulation and cell-specific expression of macrophage scavenger receptor gene have been investigated. Complicated growth- and differentiation-related regulatory pathways of macrophage scavenger receptor gene transcription in THP-1 macrophages have been proposed(28.Wu H. Moulton K. Horvai A. Parik S. Glass C.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2129-2139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44.Moulton K.S. Semple K. Wu H. Glass C.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4408-4418Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Specifically, positive transcriptional control of the macrophage scavenger receptor is dependent on the combinatorial interactions of multiple positive factors (including Spi-1/PU.1, which binds to the region I, and a ternary complex of c-Jun, JunB, and an ets2-like protein, which binds to the region IV) and negative factors (undefined inhibitory elements, which bind to the regions II, III and VI)(44.Moulton K.S. Semple K. Wu H. Glass C.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4408-4418Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Moreover, the ternary complex binding to the region IV is a target for transcriptional activation following stimulation of THP-1 monocytes with PMA. Decreased expression of macrophage scavenger receptor mRNA in response to TNF-α resulted, in part, from decreased transcriptional activity of macrophage scavenger receptor gene. Specifically, PMA increased macrophage scavenger receptor mRNA in THP-1 monocytes via the transcriptional activation of the macrophage scavenger receptor gene as shown (Fig. 5) and as described(44.Moulton K.S. Semple K. Wu H. Glass C.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4408-4418Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). TNF-α reduced macrophage scavenger receptor gene transcription by 20% (Fig. 5). TNF-α has been show to decrease the transcriptional rate of many genes(45.Solis-Herruzo J.A. Brenner D.A. Chojkier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5841-5845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46.Conway E.M. Rosenberg R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5588-5592Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 47.Pape M.E. Kim K.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 974-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, other genes are induced in response to TNF-α mediated by the induction of transcription factors such as NFκB, AP-1, IRF-1, and NF-GMa(48.Schutze S. Machleidt T. Kronke M. Semin. Oncol. 1992; 19: 16-24PubMed Google Scholar). Whether the effect of TNF-α on transcriptional down-regulation of macrophage scavenger receptor mRNA alters the combinatorial interactions of positive and negative factors as described (44.Moulton K.S. Semple K. Wu H. Glass C.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4408-4418Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) remains to be further investigated. Our results demonstrate that in the presence of actinomycin D (an inhibitor of transcription), TNF-α inhibited macrophage scavenger receptor mRNA principally by reducing macrophage scavenger receptor mRNA half-life (Fig. 6). Although both IFN-μ (5.Fong L. Fong A. Cooper A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11751-11760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Geng Y.-J. Hansson G.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1322-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) and TGF-β1 (7.Bottalico L.A. Wager R.E. Agellon L.B. Assoian R.K. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22866-22871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) inhibited macrophage scavenger receptor mRNA steady state levels, it was undetermined if these cytokines reduced macrophage scavenger receptor transcription or if the reduction in mRNA steady state levels was due to increased mRNA degradation. The TNF-α reduction in macrophage scavenger receptor mRNA half-life was inhibited by cycloheximide, implying that new protein synthesis was necessary and suggesting that TNF-α induced expression of protein(s) that accelerated macrophage scavenger receptor mRNA degradation (Fig. 7). A reduction of endothelial cell nitric oxide synthase mRNA half-life has also been demonstrated in response to TNF-α (49.Yoshizumi Y. Perrella M.A. Burnett J.C. Lee M.-E. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar, 50.Mohamed F. Monge J.C. Gordan A. Cernacek P. Blais D. Stewart D.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Res. 1993; 73: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). To assess the effects of TNF-α on cholesterol trafficking in THP-1 macrophages, the role of TNF-α in macrophage scavenger receptor-mediated CE metabolism was characterized by evaluating parameters in the CE cycle. TNF-α decreased ACAT activity (Fig. 8A) and esterification of free cholesterol (Fig. 8B) by 65% as compared with untreated cells and paralleled the decrease in aLDL binding. Decreased ACAT activity most likely resulted from decreased substrate (e.g. cholesterol) availability to the enzyme. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that decreased ACAT activity in response to TNF-α may occur through phosphorylation of ACAT by protein kinase(52.Corton J.M. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). CE hydrolytic enzymes such as acid CE hydrolase and neutral CE hydrolase activities were unaffected by TNF-α treatment. These findings may have physiologic significance in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Scavenger receptors are expressed by macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions and are believed to mediate the binding and uptake of modified LDL including oxidized LDL. Cytokines produced by cells comprising the atheroma (macrophages, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and lymphocytes) modulate macrophage scavenger receptor expression in vitro and are thought to participate in modulating expression in vivo. The expression of TNF-α is increased in atherosclerotic tissue (53.Rus H.G. Niculescu F. Vlaicu R. Atherosclerosis. 1991; 89: 247-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 54.Tipping P.G. Hancock W.W. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 142: 1721-1728PubMed Google Scholar) in comparison with normal vascular tissue. TNF-α within the atherosclerotic lesion could have a modulatory or inhibitory effect on macrophage scavenger receptor-mediated accumulation of oxidized lipoprotein by macrophages. We have previously demonstrated that TNF-α can up-regulate expression of the LDL receptor by HepG2 cells (55.Stopeck A.T. Nicholson A.C. Mancini F.P. Hajjar D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17489-17494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by increasing LDL receptor gene transcription. This study and our previous work (55.Stopeck A.T. Nicholson A.C. Mancini F.P. Hajjar D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17489-17494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrate how cytokines can modulate transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of lipoprotein receptors. These regulatory effects may potentially alter lipoprotein metabolism in vascular and hepatic tissues and alter pathophysiologic processes. We thank Terrance Win for technical assistance."

INTRODUCTIONLiposomes are potentially universal carriers of various molecules, particularly in vivo(1.Lasic D. Papahadjopoulos D. Science. 1995; 267: 1275-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 2.Gregoriadis G. Liposome Technology. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1993Google Scholar, 3.Papahadjopoulos D. Allen T.

Thus far, however, liposome-mediated delivery into the cytosolic space has been inefficient. More often, membrane-impermeant and high molecular weight molecules delivered inside liposomes are degraded inside macrophage lysosomes, without ever crossing endocytic membranes into cytoplasm(4.Straubinger R.M. Hong K. Friend D.S. Papahadjopoulos D. Cell. 1983; 32: 1069-1079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 5.Daleke D.L. Hong K. Papahadjopoulos D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1024: 352-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Currently, the best available formulation is the “pH-sensitive liposome,” which maintains stable phospholipid bilayers at neutral pH but favors non-bilayer structure at the acidic pH of endosomes (for a review, see (6.Straubinger R.M. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 221: 361-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar)). Although delivery from pH-sensitive liposomes into the cytosolic space was better than that achieved by conventional, pH-insensitive liposomes, there remains a significant need for improved mechanisms that can mediate delivery of the liposomal contents into the cytosol after release within endocytic compartments(6.Straubinger R.M. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 221: 361-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 7.Chu C.-J. Dijkstra J. Lai M.-Z. Hong K. Szoka F.C. Pharm. Res. (N. Y.). 1990; 7: 824-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 8.Harding C.V. Collins D.S. Kanagawa O. Unanue E.R. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2860-2863PubMed Google Scholar).The efficiency of cytoplasmic delivery could be greatly enhanced by a mechanism that breaches the endosomal membrane once the liposomal contents are delivered into endosomal lumen. For this, we have adopted a strategy used by a facultative intracellular pathogen, Listeria monocytogenes(9.Portnoy D.A. Jones S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 730: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). After being internalized into phagosomes, L. monocytogenes permeabilizes phagosomal membranes to enter the cytosolic space of host cells(9.Portnoy D.A. Jones S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 730: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Listeriolysin O (LLO) ( 1The abbreviations used are: LLOlisteriolysin OOVAovalbuminPCphosphatidylcholinePEphosphatidylethanolamineCHEMScholesterylhemisuccinateHPTS8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonateDPXp-xylene-bispyridinium bromideSEsheep erythrocytesBFAbrefeldin AMHCmajor histocompatibility complex.) is primarily responsible for this step(10.Gaillard J.L.

Nature. 1990; 345: 175-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), although other factors may augment its action(13.Camilli A. Goldfine H. Portnoy D.A. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 751-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 14.Goldfine H. Knob C. Alford D. Bentz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Purified LLO is hemolytic and shows increased activity at low pH(16.Geoffroy C. Gaillard J.-L. Alouf J. Berche P. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 1641-1646Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Portnoy D.A. Tweten R.K. Kehoe M. Bielecki J. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 2710-2717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we report co-encapsulation of LLO and other molecules to be delivered inside liposomes and demonstrate that LLO can confer upon liposomes, both pH-insensitive and -sensitive, the ability to deliver efficiently their contents into macrophage cytosol.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMurine bone marrow-derived macrophages were prepared as described in Racoosin and Swanson(18.Racoosin E.L. Swanson J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1011-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 20% fetal calf serum and 30% L-cell-conditioned medium. On the sixth or seventh day of culture, cells were replated and cultured on coverslips or appropriate dishes in 10% fetal calf serum containing Dulbecco's minimal essential medium for use the following day.LLO was purified from L. monocytogenes strain M1545 according to a method modified from Goldfine et al. and Geoffroy et al.(14.Goldfine H. Knob C. Alford D. Bentz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2979-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 16.Geoffroy C. Gaillard J.-L. Alouf J. Berche P. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 1641-1646Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, bacterial culture supernatant was concentrated by tangential flow ultrafiltration (30-kDa molecular cutoff filters, Minitan system, Millipore, Bedford, MA), followed by fractionation using successive anion and cation exchange columns (Q-Sepharose; MonoS, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The protein eluant peak from a cation exchange column (NaCl gradient) containing hemolytic activity was pure by Coomassiestained SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The protein migrated at 58 kDa.Liposomes were made by freeze-thaw followed either by extrusion through 0.2 μm size polycarbonate filters (Nuclepore Costar, Cambridge, MA) four times or by sonication(19.Lee K.-D. Hong K. Papahadjopoulos D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1103: 185-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 20.Olson F. Hunt C.A. Szoka F.C. Vail W.J. Papahadjopoulos D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 557: 9-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). LLO was encapsulated inside liposomes as soluble protein in 30 mM Tris buffer, 100 mM NaCl, at pH 8.5, under non-reducing conditions. Unencapsulated molecules and LLO were removed by gel filtration (Sepharose CL, Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ). The liposomes used for morphological studies contained 35 mM 8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonate (HPTS) and 50 mMp-xylene-bispyridinium bromide (DPX) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). For antigen presentation, ovalbumin (OVA) (Sigma) was encapsulated inside liposomes at 20 mg/ml; and LLO was at 200 μg/ml (100 to 1 molar ratio of OVA to LLO). The amount of encapsulated OVA was monitored using OVA labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate. Under the highest OVA concentration we tested in the antigen presentation assay, 100 μg/ml, the lipid concentration was approximately 500 μM and the LLO, 1 μg/ml. LLO-containing liposomes were stable over 2 weeks as indicated by a calcein release assay(4.Straubinger R.M. Hong K. Friend D.S. Papahadjopoulos D. Cell. 1983; 32: 1069-1079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar).The antigen presentation assay was according to a modified method of Harding(21.Harding C.V. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 313-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In brief, after incubation with liposomes for 1 h at 37°C, macrophages were washed and returned to normal culture medium for 2 h. Macrophages were then fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde, washed again, and then incubated with CD8+ T cells (CD8 OVA T1.3 cell line, 106cells/ml) for 20-24 h. Interleukin-2 content in the supernatant was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA). All the experiments with drug treatments were done in the cells pretreated with drugs for 15 min before incubation with liposomes.Phagocytic index of macrophages toward IgG-opsonized sheep erythrocytes (SE) was measured according to the method of Wright and Silverstein (22.Wright S. Silverstein S. J. Exp. Med. 1982; 156: 1149-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Cells treated with liposomes were incubated with SE opsonized with anti-SE IgG at a 10:1 ratio (SE/cell) for 5 min at 37°C. Then, unbound SE were washed and the bound but non-internalized SE were lysed by 3 × alternating 2-s washes with buffer and water. Cells were subsequently fixed, and the number of macrophages containing SE and the number of SE per positive cell were scored.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe tested two lipid compositions: A, pH-insensitive liposomes, which consisted of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and cholesterylhemisuccinate (CHEMS); and B, pH-sensitive liposomes, made of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and CHEMS (Table 1). Both have the same negative charge density at neutral pH and exhibit similar rates of uptake by macrophages(7.Chu C.-J. Dijkstra J. Lai M.-Z. Hong K. Szoka F.C. Pharm. Res. (N. Y.). 1990; 7: 824-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Formulations denoted C and D (Table 1) were the same as A and B, respectively, except that they contained encapsulated LLO. Hereafter, we refer to the LLO-containing liposomes as “primed” liposomes.Tabled 1The cytoplasmic delivery by pH-sensitive, primed liposomes was first visualized directly by fluorescence microscopy. The membrane-impermeant, pH-dependent, fluorescent dye HPTS was encapsulated inside liposomes along with DPX, which at high concentrations quenches the fluorescence of HPTS(6.Straubinger R.M. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 221: 361-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 19.Lee K.-D. Hong K. Papahadjopoulos D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1103: 185-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Fig. 1(a-d) shows HPTS fluorescence excited at 405 and 440 nm, inside macrophages that internalized liposomes. At low pH, HPTS fluorescence is greater with 405 nm excitation, whereas at neutral pH, fluorescence at 440 nm excitation is greater than at 405 nm excitation(5.Daleke D.L. Hong K. Papahadjopoulos D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1024: 352-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 6.Straubinger R.M. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 221: 361-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 19.Lee K.-D. Hong K. Papahadjopoulos D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1103: 185-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Therefore, a strong fluorescence at 405 nm excitation indicates HPTS in acidic compartments (endosomes); and a strong signal at 440 nm indicates HPTS in neutral compartments (cytosol). Cells incubated with pH-sensitive, primed liposomes showed HPTS fluorescence in the cytoplasm, often brightly labeling the nucleus (Fig. 1, c and d), whereas cells incubated with pH-sensitive, unprimed liposomes showed predominantly endosomal, low pH HPTS signal (Fig. 1, a and b). Within 30 min after a 15-min incubation with liposomes, 54 (±16)% of cells incubated with pH-sensitive, primed liposomes showed bright cytoplasmic HPTS fluorescence, in contrast with 14 (±10)% positive using pH-sensitive, unprimed liposomes (n = 4; each ≈50 cells). Furthermore, in the majority of positive cells, the cytoplasmic fluorescence in the cells treated with primed liposomes was stronger than that with unprimed liposomes.Figure 1:a-d, delivery of liposome-encapsulated fluorescent dye by LLO-containing liposomes. Fluorescence of cells incubated with HPTS/DPX containing liposomes: a and b, pH-sensitive, unprimed B formulation; c and d, pH-sensitive, primed (i.e. LLO-containing) D formulation. a and c were with excitation at 405 nm (20 nm bandpass), and b and d with 440 nm (20 nm bandpass); all at emission 520 nm. Liposomes containing HPTS/DPX were incubated with bone marrow-derived macrophages for 15 min at 37°C. Cells were washed and chased for an additional 15 min at 37°C before viewing. e and f, a time lapse sequence of HPTS delivery by pH-sensitive, primed liposomes. The uptake and fate of HPTS/DPX-containing liposomes (formulation D) was monitored using an image analysis system (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA) equipped with alternating excitation filters (e excited by 405 nm; f excited by 440 nm). After 8 min of incubation with liposomes, cells were washed with buffer, and the fluorescence at two excitation wavelengths was collected every minute. Frames represent 1-min intervals, beginning 5 min after the wash.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The sequence from a time lapse movie indicated the mechanism of delivery from the pH-sensitive primed liposomes (Fig. 1, e and f). Release of HPTS from liposomes into endocytic compartments, and subsequently into cytosol, was monitored microscopically, using two alternating fluorescence excitation filters. During the initial period of incubation with liposomes, most cells showed low HPTS fluorescence, because HPTS fluorescence was quenched by DPX inside intact liposomes. Upon destabilization of liposomes and release of liposomal contents inside the endocytic compartment, HPTS fluorescence was dequenched, resulting in an increased signal at 405 nm excitation (Fig. 1e, frame 2). After a lag time of ~1 min, HPTS diffused rapidly from the acidic compartment into the cytosol, producing a diffuse signal throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 1f). The cytoplasmic signal was stronger at 440 nm excitation than at 405 nm excitation, demonstrating that the dye had entered the pH-neutral compartment (i.e. cytosol). This last step was only observed with primed liposomes indicating an important role for LLO in the efficient cytoplasmic delivery.For the LLO-containing liposomes to be effective as a therapeutic delivery vehicle, cells must remain viable after delivery. We measured the viability of cells after liposome uptake in two ways. First, we examined the permeability of plasma membranes to propidium iodide and trypan blue. After incubation with liposomes for 1.5 h, cells were returned to normal culture medium, and dye exclusion was monitored 1.5 and 24 h later. All liposome formulations showed less than 6% cells positive with dyes, and these values were similar to cells treated with buffer only. As a second test, we monitored the phagocytic index of macrophages toward IgG-opsonized SE(22.Wright S. Silverstein S. J. Exp. Med. 1982; 156: 1149-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). None of the liposome formulations affected either the percentage of cells that phagocytosed SE or the average number of SE phagocytosed per macrophage (Table 2).Tabled 1To quantify cytosolic delivery of macromolecules by the pH-sensitive, primed liposomes relative to other liposomes, we used an assay for MHC class I-restricted antigen presentation(21.Harding C.V. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 313-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Exogenous proteins internalized by macrophages are normally processed by proteolysis in endocytic compartments and presented at the cell surface in an MHC class II-restricted response; MHC class I-restricted presentation is induced predominantly when proteins enter cytosol(8.Harding C.V. Collins D.S. Kanagawa O. Unanue E.R. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2860-2863PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Moore M.W. Carbone F.R. Bevan M.J. Cell. 1988; 54: 777-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar, 24.Germain R.N. Cell. 1994; 76: 287-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar). We encapsulated OVA inside liposomes, added them to macrophages, and then measured the extent of OVA antigen presentation via cytosolic pathway, using a CD8+ T cell line that recognizes OVA peptide-MHC I complex on macrophage cell surfaces(21.Harding C.V. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 313-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). OVA delivered into the cytosol is degraded by proteasome-mediated proteolysis in the cytoplasm, the processed peptide is translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum, where it associates with a MHC class I molecule, and this peptide-MHC complex is then transported to the cell surface via the Golgi apparatus.Primed liposomes, both pH-insensitive and -sensitive, delivered OVA into the cytosolic pathway of antigen presentation far more efficiently than corresponding unprimed formulations. Antigen presentation was most efficient using pH-sensitive, primed liposomes (Fig. 2a, D formulation). Although pH-sensitive liposomes have been previously reported to induce MHC class I-restricted antigen presentation in comparison with pH-insensitive liposomes(8.Harding C.V. Collins D.S. Kanagawa O. Unanue E.R. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2860-2863PubMed Google Scholar), neither formulation delivered OVA into cytosol efficiently enough to induce measurable antigen presentation in our assay. This is likely due to the different sensitivities of the assay methods. Antigen presentation was not detectable when macrophages were allowed to internalize free OVA (100 μg/ml) by pinocytosis, with or without free LLO (~1 μg/ml) in the medium (data not shown). In time course experiments (Fig. 2b), the OVA presentation via pH-sensitive, primed liposomes increased after a lag period of 30 min, reached a maximum at 4 h, and then decreased to almost zero after 24 h.Figure 2:a, OVA-specific MHC class I-restricted antigen presentation by macrophages. Different amounts of OVA encapsulated inside liposomes (formulations A-D as listed in Table 1) were incubated with macrophages, and the extent of OVA-specific antigen presentation was documented by measuring interleukin-2 (IL-2) production from CD8 OVA T1.3 cells incubated with macrophages according to the method as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data are averages of two independent triplicate experiments. b, kinetics of antigen presentation after OVA delivery via pH-sensitive primed liposomes. Experiments were the same as in a, at 33 μg/ml OVA concentration. After incubation with liposomes, cells were kept in medium for different lengths of time before being fixed and tested for antigen presentation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To examine the pH dependence of delivery, we elevated the pH of endocytic compartments by treating cells with NH4Cl and monitored OVA delivery. After treatment with 10 mM NH4Cl(25.Ohkuma S. Poole B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3327-3331Crossref PubMed Scopus (1730) Google Scholar), OVA antigen presentation by pH-insensitive, primed liposomes was substantially abrogated (Fig. 3a). This most likely reflected the pH dependence of LLO activity(16.Geoffroy C. Gaillard J.-L. Alouf J. Berche P. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 1641-1646Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Portnoy D.A. Tweten R.K. Kehoe M. Bielecki J. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 2710-2717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); NH4Cl treatment had no effect on the extent of MHC class I-mediated antigen presentation when OVA was directly introduced into the cytoplasm by scrape loading (26.Hollenbeck P.J. Swanson J.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 864-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3a). The antigen presentation by the pH-sensitive primed liposomes was more dramatically reduced (»99%) by NH4Cl treatment, and the levels of antigen presentation by the pH-insensitive and -sensitive formulations were the same in the presence of NH4Cl. This indicated to us that one of the principal differences between the two formulations might be the location and timing of the release of liposomal contents along the endocytic pathway. Accordingly, OVA and LLO inside pH-sensitive liposomes would be released in acidic prelysosomal compartments whereas release from the pH-insensitive formulation would occur later, perhaps in lysosomes, consistent with published data on the pH-sensitive liposomes(6.Straubinger R.M.

The extent of antigen presentation by macrophages using primed liposomes, pH-insensitive (C) and pH-sensitive (D), was monitored in macrophages treated with 10 mM NH4Cl and compared with the values from untreated cells. NH4Cl was present during exposure to liposomes and for 2 h afterward, and the concentration of liposomal OVA incubated with cells was 33 μg/ml. The extent of antigen presentation was also monitored in the cells scrape loaded with 3 mg/ml OVA, with and without NH4Cl treatment. Scrape loading was performed according to the method described in (26.Hollenbeck P.J. Swanson J.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 864-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) (n = 3, ±S.D.). IL-2, interleukin-2. b, the effect of proteasome inhibitor. The extent of antigen presentation using formulation (D) was measured when cells were treated with different concentrations of proteasome inhibitor MG132 (a gift from Dr. A. Goldberg, Harvard Medical School). MG132 was solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and incubated with cells during the incubation with liposomes and chase period. The extent of antigen presentation with different final concentrations of dimethyl sulfoxide is plotted against control (no treatment) as 100% (solid bars). When MG132 was added at different concentrations under the shown dimethyl sulfoxide concentration, antigen presentation was significantly reduced (hatched bars) (n = 3, ±S.D.). c, the effect of BFA. Different duration of BFA treatment during 1-h liposome incubation and 2-h chase period (pulse-chase scheme diagrammed at the bottom) showed a reversible inhibition of antigen presentation by BFA. The antigen presentation in treated cells was expressed as percent of the value in untreated cells. All BFA treatments included a 15-min pretreatment. Final concentration was 1 μg/ml BFA in 0.01% dimethyl sulfoxide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To ensure that the observed antigen presentation occurred via the conventional MHC class I pathway, we monitored the effects of inhibitors of two critical steps in the route for antigen presentation: MG132, an inhibitor of proteasomes(27.Rock K. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2179) Google Scholar), and brefeldin A (BFA), an inhibitor of endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi traffic(28.Nuchtern J. Bonifacino J. Biddison W. Klausner R. Nature. 1989; 339: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Antigen presentation of OVA introduced into cytosol by primed liposomes was inhibited by MG132 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3b). Moreover, it was also inhibited by BFA, and this inhibition by BFA was reversible (Fig. 3c). Together, the inhibition by MG132 and BFA indicated that the liposomal OVA was first delivered into the cytoplasm and then followed the conventional MHC class I antigen presentation pathway. The recovery of antigen presentation after BFA block was an additional indication of cell viability after exposure to LLO-containing liposomes.It is difficult to quantify the percent of internalized macromolecules that reach the cytosolic space. Nonetheless, we have demonstrated that pH-sensitive primed liposomes represent a dramatic improvement over earlier formulations. Based on the data in Fig. 2, we estimate that the antigen presentation efficiency is at least 30-fold higher than that of unprimed pH-sensitive liposomes. It is comparable to antigen presentation mediated by other particulate carriers such as bacteria or beads (29.Pfeifer J.D. Wick M.J. Roberts R.L. Findlay K. Normark S.J. Harding C.V. Nature. 1993; 361: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 30.Kovacsovics-Bankowski M. Rock K. Science. 1995; 267: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar) and perhaps by osmotic lysis of pinosomes(23.Moore M.W. Carbone F.R. Bevan M.J. Cell. 1988; 54: 777-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). However, a liposome delivery system has better potential than these other delivery systems for in vivo and therapeutic applications.This is the first report that utilizes a bacterial hemolytic protein to design a liposome formulation that delivers its contents into cytosol by adopting the strategy used by L. monocytogenes to enter into cytoplasm. The toxicity of LLO is minimized by encapsulation inside liposomes. Furthermore, the natural properties of LLO implicate its minimal toxicity compared with other related pore-forming hemolysins(31.Jones S. Portnoy D.A. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 5608-5613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data further indicate that LLO is sufficient to mediate lysis of endocytic compartments. However, further molecular characterization of the hemolytic function of LLO is needed to improve upon the delivery system we have described here.One obvious application of these liposomes, implicated by the antigen presentation assay in this report, is as vaccine vectors for cell-mediated immunity. Additionally, these formulations should allow cytoplasmic delivery of any macromolecule that can be encapsulated inside liposomes. Such molecules could include drugs, peptide, or protein regulators of molecular events in the cytoplasm, oligonucleotides, and higher molecular weight nucleic acids. The significance may be greater considering this method can be readily transferred to in vivo models. INTRODUCTIONLiposomes are potentially universal carriers of various molecules, particularly in vivo(1.Lasic D. Papahadjopoulos D.

Thus far, however, liposome-mediated delivery into the cytosolic space has been inefficient. More often, membrane-impermeant and high molecular weight molecules delivered inside liposomes are degraded inside macrophage lysosomes, without ever crossing endocytic membranes into cytoplasm(4.Straubinger R.M. Hong K. Friend D.S. Papahadjopoulos D. Cell. 1983; 32: 1069-1079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 5.Daleke D.L. Hong K. Papahadjopoulos D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1024: 352-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Currently, the best available formulation is the “pH-sensitive liposome,” which maintains stable phospholipid bilayers at neutral pH but favors non-bilayer structure at the acidic pH of endosomes (for a review, see (6.Straubinger R.M. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 221: 361-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar)). Although delivery from pH-sensitive liposomes into the cytosolic space was better than that achieved by conventional, pH-insensitive liposomes, there remains a significant need for improved mechanisms that can mediate delivery of the liposomal contents into the cytosol after release within endocytic compartments(6.Straubinger R.M. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 221: 361-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 7.Chu C.-J. Dijkstra J. Lai M.-Z. Hong K. Szoka F.C. Pharm. Res. (N.

Immunol. 1991; 147: 2860-2863PubMed Google Scholar).The efficiency of cytoplasmic delivery could be greatly enhanced by a mechanism that breaches the endosomal membrane once the liposomal contents are delivered into endosomal lumen. For this, we have adopted a strategy used by a facultative intracellular pathogen, Listeria monocytogenes(9.Portnoy D.A. Jones S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 730: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). After being internalized into phagosomes, L. monocytogenes permeabilizes phagosomal membranes to enter the cytosolic space of host cells(9.Portnoy D.A. Jones S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 730: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Listeriolysin O (LLO) ( 1The abbreviations used are: LLOlisteriolysin OOVAovalbuminPCphosphatidylcholinePEphosphatidylethanolamineCHEMScholesterylhemisuccinateHPTS8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonateDPXp-xylene-bispyridinium bromideSEsheep erythrocytesBFAbrefeldin AMHCmajor histocompatibility complex.) is primarily responsible for this step(10.Gaillard J.L.

Purified LLO is hemolytic and shows increased activity at low pH(16.Geoffroy C. Gaillard J.-L. Alouf J. Berche P. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 1641-1646Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Portnoy D.A.

Here, we report co-encapsulation of LLO and other molecules to be delivered inside liposomes and demonstrate that LLO can confer upon liposomes, both pH-insensitive and -sensitive, the ability to deliver efficiently their contents into macrophage cytosol."

https://openalex.org/W1600000815,"Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are important regulators of calvarial osteoblast growth and differentiation. We have studied the regulation of the osteoblast-specific gene osteocalcin (OC) by FGF2 in phenotypically immature MC3T3-E1 calvarial osteoblastic cells. FGF2 markedly induces OC mRNA accumulation in MC3T3-E1 cells in the presence of forskolin (FSK). Similarly, OC promoter activity (luciferase reporter) is up-regulated 6-10-fold by FGF2/FSK or by FGF2/8-bromo cyclic AMP. Half-maximal induction of OC promoter activity occurs at 1 nM FGF2. By 5′ deletion analysis and dinucleotide point mutations, we map one component of this FGF2/FSK response to a GCAGTCA motif in the region −144 to −138 relative to the OC transcription initiation site. The OC promoter region −154 to −90 confers FGF2/FSK responsiveness on the Rous sarcoma virus minimal promoter. By 3′ and internal deletion analyses, the region between −90 to −99 is also found to be necessary for FGF2/FSK synergy (encodes a PuGGTCA motif previously identified as a component of FSK induction).

Previously, we have shown that the osteoblast-specific rat OC promoter is active in MC3T3-E1 cells (21.Towler D.A. Bennett C.D. Rodan G.A. Mol.

Thus, the MC3T3-E1 cell culture model provides a readily manipulable system for studying how hormonal signals, including FGF2, interact with the calvarial osteoblast transcriptional machinery assembled by the OC promoter. In this work, we show that FGF2 up-regulates OC mRNA accumulation and OC promoter activity in phenotypically immature MC3T3-E1 cultures in the presence of cyclic AMP. We map one component of this novel FGF2-dependent response to a GCAGTCA motif at nucleotides −144 to −138 in the osteoblast-specific (19.Stein G.S. Lian J.B. Endocr.

A DNA binding activity that recognizes this region of the rat OC promoter is up-regulated in crude nuclear extracts from MC3T3-E1 cells treated with FGF2 or FGF2/FSK. By internal deletion analysis in the context of the homologous OC promoter and 3′ deletion analysis in the context of a heterologous minimal promoter, we show that a second region, −90 to −99, previously defined as a component of cyclic AMP responsiveness(23.Towler D.A. Rodan G.A. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1089-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), is necessary for FGF2/FSK induction. Intriguingly, FGF2 induction of the OC promoter is selectively inhibited by ATF3, a transcriptional repressor (25.Chen B.P.C. Liang G. Whelan J. Hai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15819-15826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) involved in FGF-dependent up-regulation of proenkephalin gene expression(26.Tan Y. Low K.G. Boccia C. Grossman J. Comb M.J.

Protein was determined by the Pierce BCA assay after precipitation and resolubilization of protein(27.Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7050) Google Scholar). Semi-quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis was carried out following the protocol of Estus and co-workers(28.Estus S. Zaks W.J. Freeman R.S. Gruda M. Bravo R. Johnson E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1717-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). MC3T3-E1 cells were plated at a density of 150,000 cells/cm2 in 15-cm diameter tissue culture dishes. 24 h later, cells were refed with 25 ml of fresh complete medium containing either vehicles (vehicles were Me2SO for FSK and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for FGF2), 10 μM FSK, 6 nM FGF2, or 10 μM FSK and 6 nM FGF2 and then cultured for an additional 18 h. Total RNA was subsequently isolated from confluent monolayers of MC3T3-E1 cells as described(29.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal.

Oligonucleotide directed mutagenesis by PCR was utilized to introduce the dinucleotide substitutions. Deletion of the region −112 to −93 in the homologous promoter context of 154 OCLUC was achieved by ligating the PCR fragment −154 to −113 into the KpnI site of 92 OCLUC(21.Towler D.A. Bennett C.D.

After a 2-day period following the Me2SO shock, transfected cells were switched to complete culture medium containing either vehicles (see above), 10 μM FSK, 6 nM FGF2, or both FSK and FGF2. After treatment for 18 h, cellular luciferase activity was measured as previously detailed (21.Towler D.A. Bennett C.D. Rodan G.A. Mol.

The data are presented as the mean (± standard deviation) luciferase activity of three independent transfections, verified in multiple (two to six) independent experiments. Transfection efficiencies were routinely monitored as described previously (21.Towler D.A. Bennett C.D. Rodan G.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 614-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) with pGL2-Promoter (Promega). MC3T3-E1 cells were plated at a density of 150,000 cells/cm2 in 15-cm diameter tissue culture dishes. 24 h later, cells were refed with 25 ml of fresh complete medium containing either vehicles (see above), 10 μM FSK, 6 nM FGF2, or 10 μM FSK and 6 nM FGF2 and cultured for an additional 18 h. Nuclear extracts and gel shift assays were carried out as described previously (21.Towler D.A. Bennett C.D. Rodan G.A. Mol.

Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1089-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) except that 1 nM okadaic acid and 10 mM sodium orthovanadate were added to inhibit phosphoprotein phosphatases. Synthetic oligonucleotides used for gel shift analyses were: FRE-A, CCTGCAGTCACCAACCACAGCAT (rat OC −146 to −125); FRE-B, GGATGCTGTGGTTGGTGACTGCA; AP1-A, GGCTTGATGAGTCAGCC; AP1-B, CCGGCTGACTCATCAAG. The appropriate oligonucleotide pairs were annealed and end-labeled with [α-32P]dCTP and the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. Oligonucleotides thyroid hormone response element palindrome (23.Towler D.A. Rodan G.A.

Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1089-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar)) were prepared as previously detailed. In supershift assays, crude nuclear extracts were preincubated on ice with 1 μl of the indicated antibody prior to binding and electrophoresis. The α-Fos (K-25), α-Jun (D), ATF2, and ATF3 (antibodies 10 μg/μl) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotech (Santa Cruz, CA). Other polyclonal ATF1, ATF2, and ATF4 antibody reagents were the kind gift of Dr. T. Hai and B. Chen (Ohio State University). Previously, we demonstrated that FSK or 8-bromo cyclic AMP could up-regulate OC in MC3T3-E1 calvarial osteoblasts(23.Towler D.A. Rodan G.A. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1089-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Because FGF2 potentiates OC secretion from bovine calvarial cells(1.Globus R.K. Patterson-Buckendahl P. Gospodarowicz D. Endocrinology. 1988; 123: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), we wished to assess whether FGF2- and FSK-dependent signals interact in MC3T3-E1 cells. As shown in Fig. 1, the combination of FGF2 and FSK markedly up-regulates OC mRNA accumulation in MC3T3-E1 cells. This effect is specific, because the mRNA for GAPD is not affected. As previously observed in MC3T3-E1 cells(20.Hurley M.M. Abreu C. Harrison J.R. Lichtler A.C. Raisz L.G. Kream B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5588-5593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), FGF2 markedly suppresses COL1A1 mRNA accumulation, either in the presence or the absence of FSK. Thus, as observed with bovine calvarial cultures, FGF2 can potentiate OC expression in MC3T3-E1 cells. However, the effect in MC3T3-E1 cells is enhanced upon co-treatment with FSK. We wished to assess whether FGF2 and FSK could synergistically activate the OC promoter. MC3T3-E1 cells were transfected with the rat OC promoter-luciferase reporter construct 1050 OCLUC (contains the region −1050 to 32 of the OC promoter; 21), allowed to recover 2 days, and then treated with vehicles, 10 μM FSK, 6 nM FGF2, or both (FGF2/FSK) for 18 h. Cell extracts were subsequently prepared and analyzed for luciferase activity. As shown in Fig. 2, the combination of FGF2 and FSK synergistically up-regulates OC promoter activity. Synergistic induction is also observed with FGF2/8-bromo cyclic AMP (not shown). The effect is specific for the OC promoter, because the proximal rat BSP promoter (795 BSPLUC) is not up-regulated but is actually suppressed (Fig. 2). In the presence of 10 μM FSK, the FGF2 dose response reveals half-maximal induction of the OC promoter with 1 nM FGF2 (Fig. 3). Thus, FGF2/FSK synergistically and specifically up-regulates OC promoter activity in MC3T3-E1 cells. Using a series of 5′ deletion constructs prepared as previously detailed(21.Towler D.A. Bennett C.D. Rodan G.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 614-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), we mapped the FGF2/FSK interaction to a region between −154 and −138 relative to the transcription initiation site (Fig. 4). A series of dinucleotide substitutions were made within this region within the context of the −154 to 32 homologous rat OC promoter (154 OCMUT series). As shown in Fig. 5, substitutions upstream (154 OCMUT#1-#2) or downstream (154 OCMUT#6-#7) of the region −144 to −138 have little effect on FGF2/FSK induction. By contrast, the GCAGTCA to AAAGTCA alteration seen in 154 OCMUT#4 decreases FGF2/FSK induction by approximately 50%. Furthermore, the GCAGTCA to GCATTTA substitution in 154 OCMUT#5 completely abrogates the FGF2/FSK synergistic induction (without affecting the FSK response), consistent with the results obtained from the 5′ deletion analyses (compare 154 OCLUC with 138 OCLUC; Fig. 4). Introduction of the TTAGTCA motif, an AP1 cognate, at this position (154 OCMUT#3) results in a variant partially inducible by FGF2 alone (2-fold) and subsequently more responsive FGF2/FSK. Thus, the intact GCAGTCA motif in the region −144 to −138 is necessary for the FGF2 component of FGF2/FSK induction of rat OC promoter activity. The region −144 to −138 is necessary for the FGF2/FSK response as shown above by deletion analysis and point mutagenesis. However, three tandem copies of the sequence CTGCAGTCAC (rat OC −146 to −137) are insufficient to reconstitute the response when placed upstream of the RSV minimal promoter (not shown). Recently, we have shown that FSK can modestly induce the OC promoter via the rat osteocalcin cyclic AMP response region −121 to −74 (23.Towler D.A. Rodan G.A. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1089-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) dependent upon two PuGGTCA (TGACCPy) hexamer motifs (see Fig. 11). Therefore, we wished to assess whether this downstream element participated in the FGF/FSK induction. As shown in Fig. 6, the OC promoter fragments −154 to −74 (Fig. 6A) or −154 to −90 (Fig. 6B) confer FGF2/FSK induction on the heterologous RSV minimal promoter. Deletion of the region −74 to −111 (OC (−199 to −74) RSVLUC versus OC (−199 to −112) RSVLUC; Fig. 6A) or −90 to −99 ((−154 to −90) OC RSVLUC versus (−154 to −100) OC RSVLUC; Fig. 6B) completely abrogates FGF2/FSK induction. RSVLUC alone is inactive as a promoter (TATA box only; (23.Towler D.A. Rodan G.A. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1089-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar)). Similarly, deletion of the region −112 to −93 within the homologous promoter context, 154 [Δ −112 to −93] OCLUC, completely abrogates FGF2/FSK induction (Fig. 6B). Thus, in toto, the rat OC promoter region −154 to −90 is necessary and sufficient for the FGF2/FSK response. This response is dependent upon the newly defined GCAGTCA motif at −144 to −138 and a downstream element between −99 and −90, encoding a GGGTCA motif (bottom strand) involved with cyclic AMP responsiveness ((23.Towler D.A. Rodan G.A. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1089-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and Fig. 11). Comb and co-workers (26.Tan Y. Low K.G. Boccia C. Grossman J. Comb M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7546-7556Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) have shown that ATF3 and c-Jun participate in the synergistic induction of the proenkephalin promoter by FGF2 and FSK in SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cells. To assess whether ATF3 participates in the FGF2/FSK induction of the OC promoter, pCG-ATF3 eukaryotic expression construct was co-transfected with 154 OCLUC in MC3T3-E1 cells, followed by treatment with vehicles, FSK, FGF2, or FGF2/FSK. As shown in Fig. 7, co-expression of ATF3 does not potentiate but rather attenuates FGF2/FSK induction of the OC promoter (consistent with its role as a transcriptional repressor; (25.Chen B.P.C. Liang G. Whelan J. Hai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15819-15826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) without altering the FSK response. By contrast, co-expression of pCG-ATF2 has no effect on induction (Fig. 7). Thus, ATF3 is not participating in the synergistic up-regulation of the OC promoter by FGF2/FSK in MC3T3-E1 cells; rather it acts as a transcriptional inhibitor. To assess the DNA-protein interactions occurring in this region of the rat OC promoter, crude nuclear extracts were prepared from MC3T3-E1 cells treated with vehicle, 10 μM FSK, 6 nM FGF2, or FGF2/FSK as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Electrophoretic mobility gel shift assays were then carried out using radiolabeled duplex oligonucleotide encoding the rat OC promoter region −146 to −125 (FRE oligo) encompassing the element described by deletion and mutagenesis to be participating in the FGF2/FSK response. As shown in Fig. 8, a DNA binding activity is up-regulated in nuclear extracts of cells treated with FGF2 (lane 4) or FGF2/FSK (lane 5). A smaller increase in FRE binding activity is also observed by treatment with FSK alone (lane 3). By contrast, both unregulated (constitutive) and inducible DNA binding activities are present in these same extracts, which recognize the homeodomain cognate OCTA 26 (not shown and (21.Towler D.A. Bennett C.D. Rodan G.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 614-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar)). AP1 binding activity is also up-regulated (lanes 7-10); however, the FRE DNA-protein complex and the AP1 DNA-protein complex do not co-migrate. Moreover, unlabeled AP1 cognate does not compete for factor binding to the rat OC FRE oligo (Fig. 9A, lanes 5 and 6). Unlabeled FRE cognate (rat OC −146 to −125; Fig. 9A, lane 3) and the concatamerized sequence CTGCAGTCAC (rat OC −146 to −137; not shown) compete for MC3T3-E1 nuclear factor binding to the FRE oligo. However, the thyroid hormone response element palindrome (half-site AGGTCA) does not compete for binding (Fig. 9B; lanes 5-7). Interestingly, the rat OC BOX, which contains the motif GGGGTCA at −92 to −98 (bottom strand) does compete weakly for FRE binding activity when present in 50-fold molar excess (Fig. 9B, lane 10). Thus, FGF2 and FGF2/FSK up-regulates a specific DNA-protein interaction in the rat OC promoter region conferring FGF2/FSK transcriptional responses. The similarity of the GCAGTCA motif to DNA cognates for a number of leucine zipper transcription factors of the ATF, Fos, and Jun families prompted us to assess whether one of these known factors might be present in the DNA-protein complex binding to the FRE oligo. Antibodies recognizing conserved domains of c-Fos, Fos-B, Fra-1, and Fra-2 (α-Fos) and c-Jun, Jun-B, and Jun-D (α-Jun) did not supershift or disrupt the complex assembling on the FRE oligo (Fig. 10A). By contrast, these same antibodies could supershift and partially disrupt the DNA-protein complex assembling on the AP1 element (31.Lee W. Mitchel P. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 49: 741-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar) known to bind Fos-Jun family members (Fig. 10B). No immunologic evidence of ATF1, ATF2, ATF3, ATF4 (Fig. 10A), or CREB (not shown) could be found in the complex binding the FRE oligo. Thus, the DNA-protein complex assembling on the FRE oligo does not contain common Fos, Jun, or ATF family members. Previously, we identified a cyclic AMP response region (−121 to −74) in the proximal osteocalcin promoter ((23.Towler D.A. Rodan G.A. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1089-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and Fig. 11). We now describe a novel element participating in a FGF2 transcriptional response, which cooperates with cyclic AMP to synergistically induce OC expression and which binds a DNA complex up-regulated in cells treated with FGF2 or FGF2/FSK. To our knowledge, this is the second promoter element shown to be synergistically activated by FGF2/FSK. Tan et al.(26.Tan Y. Low K.G. Boccia C. Grossman J. Comb M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7546-7556Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) recently described a proenkephalin promoter element stimulated by FGF/FSK via ATF3 and c-Jun. However, the inducible MC3T3-E1 protein complex assembling on the rat OC promoter does not contain ATF3 or c-Jun. Moreover, co-expression of ATF3 inhibits FGF2/FSK induction of the OC promoter, consistent with the recently defined role for ATF3 as a transcriptional repressor(25.Chen B.P.C. Liang G. Whelan J. Hai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15819-15826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the character of the OC promoter FGF2/FSK response differs from that of the proenkephalin promoter(26.Tan Y. Low K.G. Boccia C. Grossman J. Comb M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7546-7556Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The sequence of the FRE and the observation that ATF3 inhibits induction introduces the notion that a known or novel member of the leucine zipper family (32.Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (2504) Google Scholar, 33.Hafner S. Adler H.S. Mischak H. Janosch P. Heideker G. Wolfman A. Pippig S. Lohse M. Ueffing M. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6696-6703Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) may be regulating the OC promoter via this element. The similarity of the GCAGTCA FRE motif to the TPyAGTCA AP1 motif prompted us to carefully examine whether common members of the Fos and Jun family were present in the DNA-protein complex assembling on the OC FRE. Alteration of the OC promoter FRE to fit the AP1 consensus does enhance FGF2/FSK induction but also results in basal induction by FGF2 in the absence of FSK, a response not noted with the native OC promoter. Three sets of data strongly suggest that the FGF-inducible DNA-protein interaction at the native OC FRE does not contain AP1 factors: (i) The complex assembling on the OC FRE does not recognize the classic AP1 cognate. (ii) The complex assembling on the OC FRE does not supershift with α-Fos or α-Jun antibodies, whereas the complex assembling on the AP1 element does supershift with these same reagents. (iii) Tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate, which activates AP1 via protein kinase C, cannot replace FGF2 in the synergistic interaction with FSK. ( 3J. M. Boudreaux and D. A. Towler, unpublished observations.) Moreover, Stein and Lian (19.Stein G.S. Lian J.B. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 424-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar) have shown that AP1 activity suppresses the OC promoter during osteoblast proliferation(19.Stein G.S. Lian J.B. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 424-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar); this also suggests that AP1 is unlikely to be directly participating in OC promoter induction via the FRE. The capacity of FGF2 and FSK to synergistically activate OC expression and promoter activity in MC3T3-E1 cells is intriguing. In fibroblasts (33.Hafner S. Adler H.S. Mischak H. Janosch P. Heideker G. Wolfman A. Pippig S. Lohse M. Ueffing M. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6696-6703Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) and osteosarcoma cells(34.Verheijen M.H.G. Defize L.H.K. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3331-3337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), cyclic AMP inhibits mitogen-activated protein kinase activation at the level of Raf-1 interaction with Ras (33.Hafner S. Adler H.S. Mischak H. Janosch P. Heideker G. Wolfman A. Pippig S. Lohse M. Ueffing M. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6696-6703Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). FGF2 does activate mitogen-activated protein kinase(34.Verheijen M.H.G. Defize L.H.K. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3331-3337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Kudla A.J. John M.L. Bowen-Pope D.F. Rainish B. Olwin B.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3238-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, it was recently shown that FGF2 elaborates unique signals that suppress the myogenic differentiation program of MM14 cells; independent activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade by platelet-derived growth factor is not sufficient to suppress MM14 skeletal muscle gene expression(35.Kudla A.J. John M.L. Bowen-Pope D.F. Rainish B. Olwin B.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3238-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Similarly, preliminary studies show that epidermal growth factor does not synergize with FSK to up-regulate OC in MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts.3 Taken together, these observations introduce the notion that FGF receptors may initiate intracellular signal cascades in calvarial osteoblasts that are overlapping yet distinct from those of other mitogen receptor tyrosine kinases, a notion to be directly examined in future studies of MC3T3-E1 gene regulation. The precise mechanisms whereby FGF2 and FSK synergize to up-regulate OC promoter activity remain to be detailed. Possibilities include independent regulation of protein DNA interactions at the the FRE and cyclic AMP response region (23.Towler D.A. Rodan G.A. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1089-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) or regulation of obligate protein-protein interactions between factors bound to these elements. Consistent with both mechanisms, FGF2/FSK induction requires the two elements encompassed by the OC promoter fragment −154 to −90. By both 5′ deletion analysis and point mutagenesis in the context of the native OC promoter, we directly demonstrate that the region −144 to −138 is necessary for the FGF2/FSK response. However, it is not solely sufficient for this response; three tandem copies of the sequence CTGCAGTCAC (−146 to −137) cannot reconstitute the response when placed upstream of the RSV minimal promoter, even though it readily competes for nuclear factor binding to the FRE oligo. We and others have mapped important basal regulatory elements both upstream and downstream of the OC FGF response element (19-24, 38-42; Fig. 11). Furthermore, Ducy and Karsenty (24.Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar) have functionally defined an element contiguous to the FRE that plays an important role in the cell type specificity of the proximal mouse and rat OC promoters(19.Stein G.S. Lian J.B. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 424-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar, 21.Towler D.A. Bennett C.D. Rodan G.A. Mol.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13125-13132Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). However, the FGF-responsive element is distinct from this element, because mutations that destroy factor binding to this element (24.Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 42.Merriman H.L. van Wijnen A.J. Hiebert S. Bidwell J.P. Fey E. Lian J. Stein J. Stein G.S.

The interplay between tissue-specific and stimulus-specific OC promoter elements remains to be detailed. Regardless of the mechanism, in MC3T3-E1 cells the OC promoter is functionally acting as a coincidence detector, responding to bipartite inductive signals elaborated by FGF2 and FSK. The precise nature of this response will require identification and characterization of the proteinaceous factors binding hormonally responsive regions of the OC promoter and should provide a more detailed understanding of how FGF-elaborated signals impact osteogenesis in development and disease(5.Long M.M.

The element they describe differs from the rat OC FRE in several aspects: (i) The human OC element is inducible by FGF2 alone. (ii) The human OC element resembles an NF-1 DNA cognate. (iii) The human OC element maps to a distal upstream promoter fragment, near the vitamin D response element. Moreover, their studies (43.Schedlich L.J. Flanagan J.L. Crofts L.A. Gillies S.A.

Enzyme activity requires a dimeric interaction between two oxygenase domains with the reductase domains attached as monomeric extensions. To understand how dimerization activates iNOS, we synthesized an iNOS heterodimer comprised of one full-length subunit and one histidine-tagged subunit that was missing its reductase domain. The heterodimer was purified using nickel-Sepharose and 2′,5′-ADP affinity chromatography. The heterodimer catalyzed NADPH-dependent NO synthesis from L-arginine at a rate of 52 ± 6 nmol of NO/min/nmol of heme, which is half the rate of purified iNOS homodimer. Heterodimer NO synthesis was associated with reduction of only half of its heme iron by NADPH, in contrast with near complete heme iron reduction in an iNOS homodimer. Full-length iNOS monomer preparations could not synthesize NO nor catalyze NADPH-dependent heme iron reduction. Thus, dimerization activates NO synthesis by enabling electrons to transfer between the reductase and oxygenase domains. Although a single reductase domain can reduce only one of two hemes in a dimer, this supports NO synthesis from L-arginine.

L-Arginine binds near enough to the heme to influence its reduction and its interactions with small ligands such as CO or NO (8.Matsuoka A. Stuehr D.J. Olson J.S. Clark P. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol.

L-Arginine or substrate analog binding to the oxygenase domain is also influenced by H4biopterin, which may bind near the heme(11.Klatt P. Schmidt K. Brunner F. Mayer B. J. Biol.

Conversion of L-arginine to NO occurs in two steps with Nω-hydroxy-L-arginine forming as an enzyme-bound intermediate (for review see Refs. 1, 14, and 15). Both steps require that NADPH-derived electrons be transferred from the reductase domain flavins to the heme group in the oxygenase domain, which is bound to the protein via a cysteine thiolate as in the cytochromes P-450(16.White K.A.

The flavin to heme electron transfer is critical for catalysis because it is thought to enable the heme iron to bind and activate oxygen at both steps in the mechanism, resulting in oxygen insertion into L-arginine and into Nω-hydroxy-L-arginine. In spite of each subunit containing the required flavin and heme groups, the NOSs appear to be active only in dimeric form(20.Baek K.J. Thiel B.A. Lucas S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21120-21129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Klatt P. Schmidt K. Lehner D. Glatter O. Bachinger H.P. Mayer B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3687-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Dimeric structure does not seem to influence the electron transfer properties of the NOS reductase domain, because it reduces electron acceptors like cytochrome c with equal activity when present in a NOS dimer or a monomer(20.Baek K.J. Thiel B.A. Lucas S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21120-21129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Abu-Soud H.M. Loftus M. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11167-11175Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Indeed, recent studies with the cytokine-inducible NOS (iNOS) suggest that the subunit dimeric interaction only involves the oxygenase domains of each subunit, with the reductase domains existing as independent monomeric extensions (7.Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 801-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 24.Ghosh D.K. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1444-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The reductase domains can be removed with trypsin to generate a dimer comprised exclusively of two oxygenase domains. This oxygenase domain dimer maintains all of its native properties, including the ability to bind substrate and catalyze NO synthesis from Nω-hydroxy-L-arginine when supplied with electrons from an external reductase protein(7.Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 801-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 23.Ghosh D.K. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J.

Although the proposed subunit alignment for iNOS raises intriguing possibilities regarding electron transfer and cooperative catalysis between the oxygenase domains during NO synthesis(7.Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 801-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), exactly how dimerization activates iNOS catalysis remains unclear. We recently showed that full-length and oxygenase domain dimers can both be dissociated into heme-containing monomers when treated with urea(22.Abu-Soud H.M. Loftus M. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11167-11175Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 24.Ghosh D.K. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1444-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Each monomer can reassemble into its respective homodimer in the presence of L-arginine and H4biopterin. Besides confirming that all of the determinants for dimerization reside within the oxygenase domain, these results suggest that it may be possible to construct an iNOS heterodimer that contains a single reductase domain linked to a dimeric oxygenase core (Fig. 1). This species, in conjunction with a full-length iNOS monomer, could be used to investigate how dimerization influences electron transfer and catalytic activity in the oxygenase domain. In this report, we describe a method to synthesize and purify such an iNOS heterodimer and report on its catalytic and electron transfer properties. All materials were obtained from Sigma or from sources previously reported(7.Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 801-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 20.Baek K.J.

Full-length iNOS dimer was isolated and purified from the RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line as described previously(17.Stuehr D.J. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol.

The iNOS oxygenase domain (amino acids 1-503) containing a six-histidine tag at its C terminus was overexpressed in Escherichia coli using a modified version of the PCWori vector, ( 2Details will be published elsewhere (C. Wu, J. Parkinson, and D. J. Stuehr, manuscript in preparation).) which has been used to express the oxygenase domain of neuronal NOS(12.McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3686-3693Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The iNOS oxygenase domain was isolated by binding it to nickel affinity resin (Ni-Nitrilotriacetate TSepharose CL4B resin, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), washing the resin to remove unbound proteins, and eluting with imidazole according to the manufacturer's directions. Characterization of the domain showed that it was dimeric and had the same spectral, binding, and catalytic properties as the native iNOS oxygenase domain that is formed by trypsinolysis of full-length dimeric iNOS(23.Ghosh D.K. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11316-11320Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 24.Ghosh D.K. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1444-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Purified oxygenase domain dimers were dialyzed against 40 mMN-(2-hydroxyethylpiperazine)-N′-3-propane sulfonic acid (EPPS), pH 7.6, containing 10% glycerol and 0.5 mM dithiothreitol prior to use. Full-length (~15 μM) or oxygenase domain dimers (~30 μM) were dissociated using 2 or 5 M urea, respectively(22.Abu-Soud H.M. Loftus M. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11167-11175Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 24.Ghosh D.K. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1444-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The dissociation reaction was carried out at 28°C for 90 min and was terminated by a 10-fold dilution with 40 mM EPPS buffer, pH 7.6, containing 10% glycerol. The monomers so prepared were checked by gel filtration chromatography on Superdex 200. In general, this method yielded 70-90% full-length monomers and 50-60% oxygenase domain monomers. Nickel affinity resin previously charged with 50 mM NiSO4 and equilibrated with 40 mM EPPS, pH 7.6, containing 10% glycerol was saturated with the urea-dissociated oxygenase domain monomer preparation. The resin was separated from the unadsorbed protein, washed with a bed volume of equilibration buffer, and incubated with the urea-dissociated full-length monomer preparation at room temperature for 15 min. L-Arginine (5 mM) and H4biopterin (10 μM) were then added to the mixture to induce dimerization and incubated for a further 45 min with gentle shaking. The resin was packed into a column, and the unadsorbed proteins were removed by washing thoroughly with 5 column volumes of the equilibration buffer. The resin-bound protein fraction was then eluted with equilibration buffer containing 100 mM imidazole and then dialyzed against 500 volumes of equilibration buffer that also contained 1 mM dithiothreitol, 4 μM H4biopterin, 2 μM FAD, and 1 mML-arginine. The protein was then incubated for 1 h at 4°C with 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose CL4B resin that had been equilibrated with the above mentioned dialysis buffer. The beads were washed thoroughly to remove unbound material, and the bound protein was eluted with 1 bed volume of 10 mM NADPH. The eluate was concentrated to 0.1-0.2 ml in a Centricon 30 microconcentrator and loaded onto a Superdex 200 gel filtration column equilibrated with the above mentioned dialysis buffer. The eluted protein was collected in 0.3-ml fractions, pooled, concentrated, and stored at −70°C. NO synthesis and NADPH oxidation were assayed by spectrophotometric methods as previously reported(17.Stuehr D.J. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20547-20550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Baek K.J. Thiel B.A. Lucas S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21120-21129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The initial rate of NO synthesis was determined by monitoring the NO-mediated conversion of oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin at 401 nm. The assays were carried out at 37°C in buffer containing 40 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8, supplemented with 5-10 μM oxyhemoglobin, 0.3 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM arginine, 0.1 mM NADPH, 4 μM each of FAD, FMN, and H4biopterin, 100 units/ml catalase, 10 units/ml superoxide dismutase, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin to give a final volume of 0.7 ml. NADPH oxidation was monitored at 340 nm in the same system except oxyhemoglobin was omitted. Anaerobic spectroscopy was carried out in septum-sealed cuvettes as detailed in previous reports(7.Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 801-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 25.Abu-Soud H.M. Feldman P.L. Clark P. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32318-32326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). iNOS concentrations are reported on a per heme basis and were determined using an estimated extinction coefficient of 71 mM-1 cm-1 at 398 nm for macrophage iNOS(17.Stuehr D.J. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20547-20550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The percentage of iNOS ferrous heme iron was estimated based on CO binding and was obtained from the absorbance difference between 444 and 490 nm, using an estimated extinction coefficient of 74 mM-1 cm-1(17.Stuehr D.J. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20547-20550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To form a heterodimer we utilized a full-length iNOS monomer preparation that was generated from dimeric iNOS and an oxygenase domain monomer preparation that was generated from an oxygenase domain dimer that was expressed in E. coli and contained a six-histidine tag at its C terminus. Preliminary experiments with the recombinant oxygenase domain dimer showed that the histidine tag did not alter the spectral or binding properties of the protein relative to native oxygenase domain dimer(7.Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 801-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 24.Ghosh D.K. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1444-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The histidine tag also did not prevent dimerization between two oxygenase domain monomers in solution or when one monomer was bound to nickel affinity resin (data not shown). As detailed under “Experimental Procedures,” the dimerization reaction that formed the heterodimer was carried out between oxygenase domain monomers bound to nickel affinity resin and full-length monomers in solution. The nickel affinity resin enabled us to separate bound heterodimers from most of the unreacted full-length monomers and full-length homodimers that had formed during the dimerization reaction. After eluting the immobilized heterodimer with imidazole, it was separated from contaminating oxygenase domain monomers and homodimers by virtue of its containing a NADPH binding site, using 2′,5′-ADP affinity chromatography. The heterodimer underwent analytical gel filtration as a final step to remove residual full-length and oxygenase domain homodimers (Fig. 2). The protein eluted at 11.7 ml, which was between the elution volumes of authentic full-length iNOS homodimer (10.7 ml) and the oxygenase domain homodimer (13.2 ml). Analysis of the indicated protein peak fraction by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2, inset) showed that it was comprised of both full-length and oxygenase domain subunits whose relative staining densities were 2.4 to 1. Based on this densitometric data and the relative molecular mass of each subunit (130 and 55 kDa), a 1:1 molar ratio of full-length and oxygenase domain subunits was present in the peak fraction. ( 3Densitometric analysis of protein bands contained in fractions that eluted before or after the central heterodimer peak revealed that these fractions also contained both full-length and oxygenase domain proteins but at ratios that indicated some full-length iNOS homodimer and full-length oxygenase dimer eluted before and after the heterodimer peak, respectively.) Thus, we conclude that the isolated protein is an iNOS heterodimer. In the example shown, 0.52 nmol of pure heterodimer was obtained from reacting 9.2 nmol of immobilized oxygenase domain with an equivalent amount of full-length monomer preparation. Activity measurement by the oxyhemoglobin assay showed that the heterodimer could synthesize NO from L-arginine or from Nω-hydroxy-L-arginine. For three separate heterodimer preparations, the catalytic turnover number with L-arginine as substrate was 52.0 ± 5.8 nmol of NO/min/nmol of heme. This is about half of the activity obtained with a purified full-length homodimer when assayed under identical conditions (125 nmol of NO/min/nmol of heme). In contrast, full-length monomer preparations generate either no measurable NO or some small amount of NO in direct proportion to their residual dimer content(22.Abu-Soud H.M. Loftus M. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11167-11175Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The average rate of NADPH oxidation by the three heterodimer preparations during NO synthesis from L-arginine was 77.6 ± 4.3 nmol of NADPH/min/nmol of heme. This gives a calculated stoichiometry of 1.5 NADPH oxidized per NO formed, which is equal to the minimum stoichiometry for NO synthesis from L-arginine (26.Stuehr D.J. Kwon N.S. Nathan C.F. Griffith O.W. Feldman P.L. Wiseman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6259-6263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Klatt P. Schmidt K. Uray G. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14781-14787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and indicates that NO synthesis by the heterodimer was tightly coupled to its NADPH oxidation. We conclude that dimerization enabled the oxygenase domains to catalyze efficient NO synthesis when supported by only a single reductase domain. To examine how dimerization activated NO synthesis in the heterodimer, we utilized CO binding as a means to quantitate NADPH-dependent heme iron reduction. In previous work with a full-length iNOS homodimer, we observed that the addition of NADPH in the presence or the absence of L-arginine results in rapid reduction of 90-95% of the heme iron, as determined by build-up of a characteristic ferrous-CO Soret peak at 444 nm(25.Abu-Soud H.M. Feldman P.L. Clark P. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32318-32326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1993; 90: 10769-10772Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Because NADPH-derived electrons can only reduce the heme iron by passing through the reductase domain(6.Sheta E.A. McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15147-15153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Ghosh D.K. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11316-11320Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we performed an analogous experiment with the heterodimer to determine what portion of its heme is accessible to electrons coming from the single reductase domain. The experiment was carried out under anaerobic conditions in buffer that contained H4biopterin and L-arginine and was saturated with CO. As shown in Fig. 3(solid line), the light absorbance spectrum of the heterodimer displays a broad Soret absorbance centered at 398 nm, indicative of predominantly high spin ferric iNOS, as observed for a full-length iNOS homodimer under similar conditions(17.Stuehr D.J. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20547-20550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Abu-Soud H.M. Feldman P.L. Clark P. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32318-32326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1993; 90: 10769-10772Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). There also is an absorbance shoulder between 425 and 500 nm attributable to bound flavins in the heterodimer. The spectrum obtained immediately after addition of excess NADPH (dashed line) shows that a portion of the heterodimer's heme iron remained ferric, as indicated by the absorbance remaining at 380-420 nm, and a portion had become reduced, as indicated by the new absorbance peak at 444 nm. The relative proportion of oxidized and reduced heme iron did not change with time or upon adding more NADPH (data not shown). Dithionite was then added to completely reduce all of the heme iron present (dotted line), resulting in a further absorbance decrease in the 380-420 nm region and an increase at 444 nm. Quantitation of the amount of heme iron reduced with NADPH relative to the amount reduced with dithionite indicates that 55% of the heme iron was reduced by NADPH in the heterodimer. The percentage of heme iron reduction obtained in two replicate experiments using different heterodimers was calculated to be 56 and 50% (data not shown). Thus, these results clearly distinguish the heterodimer from a full-length iNOS homodimer, where 90-95% of the available heme iron is reduced upon NADPH addition under identical circumstances(25.Abu-Soud H.M. Feldman P.L. Clark P. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32318-32326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1993; 90: 10769-10772Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). We next investigated heme iron reduction in three iNOS monomer preparations that were generated by dissociating a full-length iNOS homodimer with urea(22.Abu-Soud H.M. Loftus M. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11167-11175Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The addition of NADPH in these cases resulted in very little ( 4In iNOS monomer preparations that contained more than 20% residual dimer, small peaks at 420 and 444 nm appeared after adding NADPH that represent the CO-bound forms of the H4biopterin-free and -replete iNOS dimer in the preparation (5.Wang J. Stuehr D.J. Rousseau D.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7080-7087Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).) or no heme iron reduction, as judged by a lack of CO binding. Adding dithionite to the NADPH-treated monomer preparation reduced all of its heme iron as judged by the total loss of Soret absorbance in the 400 nm region and an immediate buildup of the ferrous-CO complex at 444 nm (data not shown). These results indicate that electron transfer between the reductase domain and heme iron in a full-length subunit does not occur when the subunit is in monomeric form. A major finding of our study is that dimerization may activate iNOS NO synthesis by enabling the reductase domain to transfer electrons to the heme iron. This is consistent with heme iron reduction being an essential first step that leads to oxygen activation and insertion into the substrate(1.Kerwin Jr., J.F. Lancaster Jr., J.R. & Feldman P.L. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 4343-4362Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 14.Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 707-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Marletta M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12231-12234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As evidenced with the iNOS heterodimer, transfer of NADPH-derived electrons to the heme can occur even when only one reductase domain is attached and is sufficient to support NO synthesis. Although the heterodimer synthesized NO at a rate that was half-maximal on a per heme basis when compared with the native iNOS homodimer, only half of the heterodimer heme iron was susceptible to reduction by NADPH. This implies that the portion of heterodimer heme iron that was reducible participates in NO synthesis at a rate that equals the heme iron in a full-length iNOS homodimer. It is remarkable that only half of the heme iron in the heterodimer was susceptible to reduction by NADPH. The partial reduction does not appear to reflect a point in a redox equilibrium, because adding extra reductant (NADPH) did not cause an increase in the amount of heme iron reduced. Furthermore, when the same experiment is carried out using a full-length iNOS homodimer, 90-95% of heme iron is reduced(25.Abu-Soud H.M. Feldman P.L. Clark P. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32318-32326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1993; 90: 10769-10772Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Thus, our results suggest that a kinetic barrier exists in the heterodimer toward reduction of half of its heme iron. Based on the available evidence, there is little reason to suspect that the kinetic barrier arises from an inequality between the hemes contained in the oxygenase and full-length subunits of the heterodimer. For example, a homodimer formed from two oxygenase domains has the capacity to bind L-arginine and H4biopterin, accept electrons from an added reductase domain, and synthesize NO from Nω-hydroxy-L-arginine(7.Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 801-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 23.Ghosh D.K. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11316-11320Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 24.Ghosh D.K. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1444-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In addition, the light absorbance spectrum of the heterodimer indicates that both of its heme irons are predominantly high spin in the presence of L-arginine and H4biopterin, as is the case with both full-length and oxygenase domain homodimers(7.Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 801-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 17.Stuehr D.J. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20547-20550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the most likely explanation for why NADPH reduces only half of the heterodimer heme iron is that the single reductase domain can provide electrons to only one of the two heme irons. If the reductase domain can only transfer electrons to one of the two hemes in the heterodimer, which heme becomes reduced? The apparent inability of a full-length iNOS monomer to transfer NADPH-derived electrons to its heme iron implies that electron transfer in the heterodimer may occur in trans, i.e. electrons transfer from the reductase domain in the full-length subunit to the adjacent oxygenase domain heme iron. However, alternative mechanisms that invoke electron transfer within the full-length subunit could also explain the results. For example, dimerization may change the reactivity of the heme iron in the full-length subunit such that it can accept electrons from its reductase domain. Indeed, our related work (22.Abu-Soud H.M. Loftus M. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11167-11175Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 24.Ghosh D.K. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1444-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) indicates that the heme iron in an iNOS monomer is exposed to solvent and as a result is predominantly six-coordinate low spin, which in cytochrome P-450 is associated with a decrease in heme iron reduction potential (29.Sligar S.G. Murray R.I. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P-450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1986: 429-503Crossref Google Scholar, 30.Fisher M.T. Sligar S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 5018-5019Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Dimerization, which shifts the iNOS heme iron spin equilibrium back toward high spin(22.Abu-Soud H.M. Loftus M. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11167-11175Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 24.Ghosh D.K. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1444-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), could thus enable electron transfer by increasing the reduction potential of the heme iron in the full-length subunit. Alternatively, dimerization may cause a protein conformational change in the full-length subunit that creates a path for electrons to pass between its reductase and oxygenase domains. In any case, our current results suggest that dimerization enables electrons to transfer to a single heme in the heterodimer, and this is sufficient for activating a normal rate of NO synthesis from L-arginine. Thus, mechanisms that invoke electron transfer between two adjacent oxygenase domains, participation of both hemes in oxidizing a single molecule of L-arginine, or concerted catalysis between the subunits can be ruled out. In addition, the general method we outline here to create and purify iNOS heterodimers should now make it possible to study how sequence and structural alterations in a single subunit will affect dimerization, electron transfer, H4biopterin binding, and other aspects of the reaction mechanism.

https://openalex.org/W2058236761,"The B-lymphoblastoid cell line JY undergoes homotypic aggregation in a lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1)-mediated, intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1)-dependent manner when stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or anti-LFA-1 antibodies. Under conditions that lead to cell aggregation, we observed rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas, a protein previously identified to be phosphorylated on tyrosine in both v-src- and v-crk-transformed cells. Phosphorylation of p130caswas dependent on binding of LFA-1 to its ligand, ICAM-1, as demonstrated by the use of anti-ICAM-1 antibodies. Several observations suggest that this event may be an important step in the signaling pathway initiated by LFA-1. p130cas phosphorylation was rapidly reversible upon disengagement of the LFA-1•ICAM-1 complex and required cell adhesion since binding of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-stimulated JY cells to purified ICAM-1 or cross-linking of either LFA-1 or ICAM-1 was not sufficient to induce phosphorylation of p130cas. The integrin-stimulated phosphorylation of p130cas created binding sites that were recognized in vitro by the SH2 domain of c-CrkII, a key adaptor protein involved in cell differentiation and transformation. Moreover, we also showed that the LFA-1-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas induces the formation of a p130cas•CrkII and p130cas•CrkL complex in intact cells. This observation suggests that adhesion mediated by the interaction of LFA-1 and ICAM-1 initiates a signaling cascade that involves the activation of protein tyrosine kinases and leads to the regulation of protein-protein interaction via SH2 domains, a key process shared with growth factor signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2091768043,"A requirement for an ATP cofactor in synthesis of the first 8-10 bonds of promoter-specific transcripts by RNA polymerase II is well established. Whether ATP is required for synthesis of the first phosphodiester bond or at a slightly later stage in synthesis of nascent transcripts, however, remains controversial. Goodrich and Tjian (Goodrich, J. A., and Tjian, R.(1994) Cell 77, 145-156) recently proposed that synthesis of the first phosphodiester bond of promoter-specific transcripts by RNA polymerase II is independent of ATP and general transcription factors TFIIE and TFIIH. Here we investigate this model. Taken together, our findings indicate that ATP, TFIIE, and TFIIH can have a profound effect on the efficiency of transcription initiation. First, we observe that synthesis of the first phosphodiester bond of transcripts initiated at the adenovirus 2 major late promoter depends strongly on ATP, TFIIE, and TFIIH in a transcription system reconstituted with RNA polymerase II, TFIIH, and recombinant TBP, TFIIB, TFIIE, and TFIIF. Second, we demonstrate that, in this enzyme system, ATP-dependent activation of transcription initiation can occur immediately prior to synthesis of the first phosphodiester bond of nascent transcripts. Finally, we demonstrate that the activated initiation complex is unstable and decays rapidly to an inactive state in the presence of the inhibitor ATPγS (adenosine 5′-O-(thio)triphosphate), even during reiterative synthesis of abortive transcripts. A requirement for an ATP cofactor in synthesis of the first 8-10 bonds of promoter-specific transcripts by RNA polymerase II is well established. Whether ATP is required for synthesis of the first phosphodiester bond or at a slightly later stage in synthesis of nascent transcripts, however, remains controversial. Goodrich and Tjian (Goodrich, J. A., and Tjian, R.(1994) Cell 77, 145-156) recently proposed that synthesis of the first phosphodiester bond of promoter-specific transcripts by RNA polymerase II is independent of ATP and general transcription factors TFIIE and TFIIH. Here we investigate this model. Taken together, our findings indicate that ATP, TFIIE, and TFIIH can have a profound effect on the efficiency of transcription initiation. First, we observe that synthesis of the first phosphodiester bond of transcripts initiated at the adenovirus 2 major late promoter depends strongly on ATP, TFIIE, and TFIIH in a transcription system reconstituted with RNA polymerase II, TFIIH, and recombinant TBP, TFIIB, TFIIE, and TFIIF.

The isolation procedure included a combination of affinity chromatography on heparin-Sepharose CL-6B and 3′,5′-ADP-agarose, which was repeated twice for each, and finally gel chromatography on Superose 12. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified enzyme showed two protein bands with molecular masses of 47 and 44 kDa. Both proteins appeared to be glycoproteins, because their molecular masses decreased after N-glycanase digestion. When completely desulfated and N-resulfated heparin and mouse Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumor heparan sulfate were used as acceptors, the purified enzyme transferred sulfate to position 2 of L-iduronic acid residue but did not transfer sulfate to the amino group of glucosamine residue or to position 6 of N-sulfoglucosamine residue. Heparan sulfates from pig aorta and bovine liver, however, were poor acceptors. The enzyme showed no activities toward chondroitin, chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and keratan sulfate. The optimal pH for the enzyme activity was around 5.5. The enzyme activity was minimally affected by dithiothreitol and was stimulated strongly by protamine. The Km value for adenosine 3′-phosphate 5′-phosphosulfate was 0.20 μM.

Heparan sulfate and heparin bind to a variety of proteins, such as growth factors and protease inhibitors, suggesting their involvement not only in a fundamental cellular behaviors such as cell growth, differentiation, and cell adhesion, but also in the anticoagulation process and some pathological processes such as viral infections (1.Kjellén L.

Bindings of those ligands to heparan sulfate or heparin seem to be mediated via specific structures in heparan sulfate or heparin.

It has recently been suggested that heparan sulfate proteoglycans on cell surfaces as well as in extracellular matrix may have such specific structures and regulate the biological activity of basic fibroblast growth factor(9.Aviezer D.

In fact, the response of neural cells to either acidic or basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-1 or FGF-2, respectively) seems to be regulated by developmentally modulated forms of heparan sulfate proteoglycans(10.Nurcombe V. Ford M.D. Wildschut J.A. Bartlett P.F Science. 1993; 260: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Thus, microheterogeneity in the heparan sulfate structures, particularly in the sulfation positions may be an important factor to control the biological activity of basic fibroblast growth factor. In this regard, it is important to study how the microheterogeneity is caused and regulated. fibroblast growth factor N-sulfoglucosamine iduronic acid hexuronic acid N-acetylglucosamine glucuronic acid adenosine 3′-phosphate 5′-phosphosulfate heparan sulfate 6-sulfotransferase heparan sulfate 2-sulfotransferase Chinese hamster ovary completely desulfated and N-resulfated heparin dithiothreitol polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis high performance liquid chromatography 2-acetamide-2-deoxy-4-O-(4-deoxy-α-L-threo-hex-4-enepyranosyluronic acid)-6-O-sulfo-D-glucose 2-deoxy-2-sulfamino-4-O-(4-deoxy-α-L-threohex-4-enepyranosyluronic acid)-D-glucose 2-deoxy-2-sulfamino-4-O-(4-deoxy-α-L-threo-hex-4-enepyranosyluronic acid)-6-O-sulfo-D-glucose 2-deoxy-2-sulfamino-4-O-(4-deoxy-2-O-sulfo-α-L-threo-hex-4-enepyranosyluronic acid)-D-glucose 2-deoxy2-sulfamino-4-O-(4-deoxy-2-O-sulfo-α-L-threo-hex-4-enepyranosyluronic acid)-6-O-sulfo-D-glucose this refers to the corresponding alditol formed by reduction of the compound with NaBH4) 4-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm pack polyamine.

The sulfate donor in these reactions is adenosine 3′-phosphate 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) that is synthesized in the cytosol and transported into the lumen of the Golgi to serve as substrate(19.Mandon E.C.

It has been suggested that O-sulfation is the final step in the modification of the structure during the biosynthesis of heparin and heparan sulfate in the lumen of the Golgi apparatus(24.Lindahl U. Lane D.A. Lindahl U. Heparin-Chemical and Biological Properties: Clinical Applications. Edward Arnold, London1989: 159-189Google Scholar, 25.Lidholt K. Lindahl U. Biochem.

We recently purified heparan sulfate 6-sulfotransferase (HS6ST) that catalyzes the transfer of sulfate to position 6 of N-sulfoglucosamine residue in heparan sulfate, with a high yield from the serum-free culture medium of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells(15.Habuchi H. Habuchi O. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4172-4179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, the enzyme activity to catalyze the 2-O-sulfation of L-iduronic acid residue of heparin and heparan sulfate was hardly detected in the culture medium of CHO cells, although heparan sulfate prepared from CHO cells contained HexA(2SO4) and GlcNSO3(6SO4) residues in a proportion of 4:3. These observations have interested us in the intracellular O-sulfotransferases of CHO cells. We found in the present study that in CHO cell culture more than 90% of activities of heparan sulfate O-sulfotransferases in the cell layer catalyzed the transfer of sulfate to position 2 of L-iduronic acid residue. In this report, we describe the purification to apparent homogeneity and some properties of this sulfotransferase from the cultured CHO cells (this enzyme was designated as heparan sulfate 2-sulfotransferase (HS2ST)). [35s]H2SO4 was purchased from the Japan Radioisotope Association (Tokyo, Japan). Adenosine 3′,5′-diphosphate (3′,5′-ADP), unlabeled PAPS, 3′,5′-ADP-agarose, and heparin from porcine intestinal mucosa were from Sigma. Fetal bovine serum was from Cytosystems Pty. Ltd. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and CHO-S-SFM II, serum-free medium for suspension culture of CHO cells were from Life Technologies, Inc. Cosmedium-001 was from Cosmo-Bio (Tokyo, Japan). Fast desalting column HR10/10, heparin-Sepharose CL-6B, Superose 12 HR10/30, and HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 30 pg were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. (Uppsala, Sweden). Partisil-10 SAX column was from Whatman, PAMN column was from YMC (Kyoto, Japan). Heparitinase I, II, and III, chondroitin sulfate A from whale cartilage (4-sulfate unit/6-sulfate unit (80:20)), chondroitin sulfate C from shark cartilage (4-sulfate unit/6-sulfate unit (10:90)), dermatan sulfate from pig skin, keratan sulfate from bovine cornea, heparan sulfates from pig aorta and bovine liver, completely desulfated and N-resulfated heparin (CDSNS-heparin), and unsaturated glycosaminoglycan disaccharide kit were obtained from Seikagaku Corp. (Tokyo, Japan). Heparan sulfate from EHS tumor was a gift of T. Harada, Seikagaku Corp. Recombinant N-glycanase was from Genzyme Co. [35s]PAPS was prepared as described previously(26.Delfert D.M. Conrad H.E. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 148: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Chondroitin (squid skin) was prepared as described previously(27.Habuchi O. Miyata K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 616: 208-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). CHO cells were cultured for 2 days in 10-cm culture dishes (Falcon) containing 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin in humidified 5% CO2, 95% air at 37°C. The culture medium was then replaced with 10 ml of Cosmedium-001 containing antibiotics, and the culture was further continued for another 2 days. The spent medium was collected, and the cell layers were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped off from the dishes in 5 ml of buffer A (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM CaCl2, 20% (v/v) glycerol) containing 0.15 M NaCl, and homogenized in a glass homogenizer. The concentration of Triton X-100 in the homogenate was then increased to 0.5% (w/v). After 1 h of gentle stirring, the homogenate was centrifuged at 4°C for 10 min at 10,000 × g. The supernatant was obtained as the cell extract. For purification of HS2ST, CHO cells were plated onto 10-cm culture dishes at a density of 2.0 × 106 cells/dish in 10 ml of CHO-S-SFM-II containing antibiotics. After 4 days the CHO cells were transferred to 500-ml spinner flasks (Techne, Cambridge, United Kingdom) at a density of 3.0 × 105 cells/ml and continued culturing with constant agitation of 90 rpm for 4 days in 500 ml of the same medium. The CHO cells were harvested and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The cell pellet was suspended in the solution (55 ml/1 × 109 cells) of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM CaCl2, 0.15 M NaCl, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (5 μMNα-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone, 3 μMN-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, 30 μM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 3 μM pepstatin A). Extraction of sulfotransferases from the cells was carried out by homogenizing the cell suspension in the above buffer with a glass homogenizer on ice. After the gentle stirring at 4°C for 1 h, the homogenate was centrifuged at 4°C for 30 min at 10,000 × g. The supernatant was pooled (1.8 liters), designated as the crude extract, and stored at −20°C until use. All operations were performed at 4°C. One-third volume (600 ml) of the crude extract prepared as above was applied to a column of heparin-Sepharose CL-6B (30 × 70 mm, 50 ml) equilibrated with 0.15 M NaCl in buffer A containing a mixture of the protease inhibitors at a flow rate of 76 ml/h. The column was washed with 500 ml (10 volumes of a column) of 0.15 M NaCl in the above buffer and then eluted with a linear gradient from 0.15 to 1.2 M NaCl in the above buffer (total volume, 1,000 ml). Fractions of 13 ml were collected. The fractions containing the sulfotransferase activity were pooled (indicated by a horizontal bar in Fig. 1), concentrated to about 100 ml with polyethylene glycol 20,000 (molecular weight 15,000-25,000), and dialyzed against 0.05 M NaCl in buffer A for the next purification step. Triton X-100 was added to 1% (w/v) at the final concentration before dialysis. The step 1 fraction was applied to a column of 3′,5′-ADP-agarose (14 × 100 mm, 15 ml, 1.9 μmol of 3′,5′-ADP/ml of gel) equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.05 M NaCl at a flow rate of 13 ml/h. The column was washed with 120 ml (8 volumes of a column) of buffer A containing 0.05 M NaCl, and then eluted with 75 ml (5 volumes of a column) of 0.2 mM 3′,5′-ADP in buffer A containing 0.05 M NaCl. This fraction, containing sulfotransferase activity, was brought to 0.15 M NaCl by adding buffer A containing 1 M NaCl. The above processes (steps 1 and 2) were repeated three times, and the fractions thus obtained were combined. The step 2 fraction combined was applied to a heparin-Sepharose CL-6B column (16 × 50 mm, 10 ml) equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.15 M NaCl at a flow rate of 26 ml/h. The column was washed with 30 ml (3 volumes of a column) of buffer A containing 0.15 M NaCl. The sulfotransferase activity was eluted with a linear gradient from 0.15 to 1.0 M NaCl in buffer A (total volume, 300 ml). The fractions containing sulfotransferase activity were pooled (indicated by a horizontal bar in Fig. 2), brought to 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, and dialyzed against 1 M NaCl in buffer A and then against 0.05 M NaCl in buffer A for the next purification step. The step 3 fraction was subjected to the second 3′,5′-ADP-agarose chromatography as the first 3′,5′-ADP-agarose chromatography was performed. Sulfotransferase activity was eluted with 0.2 mM 3′,5′-ADP in buffer A containing 0.05 M NaCl. The fraction was brought to 0.15 M NaCl in buffer A, and concentrated to about 8 ml with polyethylene glycol. After dialysis against 0.1 M NaCl in buffer A, the fraction was applied onto a small heparin-Sepharose CL-6B column (bed volume, 0.5 ml) equilibrated with 0.1 M NaCl in buffer A. The column was washed with 5 ml of 0.1 M NaCl in buffer B (buffer A containing not 0.1% but 0.02% Triton X-100) and then eluted with 2.5 ml of 1 M NaCl in buffer B in order to remove 3′,5′-ADP. The eluate was then concentrated to about 0.5 ml, and dialyzed against 1 M NaCl in buffer A for the next step. Superose 12 HR 10/30 was equilibrated with buffer A containing 2 M NaCl. The step 4 fraction was applied to the column. The column was eluted with buffer A containing 2 M NaCl at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. The fractions (0.25 ml each) containing sulfotransferase activity were pooled (indicated by a horizontal bar in Fig. 3A) and dialyzed against 0.15 M NaCl in buffer A. The fraction was stored at −20°C. Sulfotransferase activity was determined as described previously (15.Habuchi H. Habuchi O. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4172-4179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly, the standard reaction mixture (50 μl) contained 2.5 μmol of imidazole HCl, pH 6.8, 3.75 μg of protamine chloride, 25 nmol (as hexosamine) of CDSNS-heparin, 50 pmol of [35s]PAPS (about 5 × 105 cpm), and enzyme. When the activity of HS2ST was monitored at each purification step, 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) was added to the standard reaction mixture. After incubation at 37°C for 20 min, the reaction was terminated by heating at 100°C for 1 min. Carrier chondroitin sulfate A (0.1 μmol as glucuronic acid) was added to the reaction mixture, and the 35s-labeled polysaccharides were isolated by precipitation with ethanol containing 1.3% potassium acetate and 0.5 mM EDTA and by subsequent gel chromatography on a Fast desalting column to remove [35s]PAPS and its degradation products. The incorporation of [35s]sulfate was linear with the amounts of enzyme proteins and with the incubation time under the above conditions (up to 5.8 ng of protein and up to 30 min when the purified enzyme was used) (data not shown). One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount required to transfer 1 pmol of sulfate/min. For SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), protein in a sample was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. The precipitate was washed twice with acetone, and dissolved in sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. 2-Mercaptoethanol was removed from the sample buffer to avoid an artifact of the following silver staining. SDS-PAGE of proteins was carried out on a 10% polyacrylamide gel as described previously (28.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207481) Google Scholar). Analysis of enzymatic reaction products was performed by HPLC as described previously (15.Habuchi H. Habuchi O. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4172-4179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) with some modification. Briefly, 35s-labeled products were digested with a mixture of 10 milliunits of heparitinase I, 1 milliunit of heparitinase II, and 10 milliunits of heparitinase III in 40 μl of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1 mM CaCl2, 4 μg of bovine serum albumin at 37°C for 2 h. The digested products were injected together with standard unsaturated disaccharides into a column of PAMN (4.6 mm × 25 cm). Fractions of 0.6 ml were collected and mixed with 3 ml of Ready Safe Scintillator (DuPont NEN), and the radioactivity was determined. Degradation of the 35s-labeled glycosaminoglycans with nitrous acid at pH 1.5 and reduction with NaBH4 were carried out as described by Shively and Conrad (29.Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Anomalous deamination products were cleaved by the additional treatment of mild acid hydrolysis (25 mM H2SO4 at 80°C for 30 min)(16.Kusche M. Oscarsson L.-G. Reynertson R. Rodén L. Lindahl U. J.

The fractions corresponding to 35s-labeled disaccharides were collected and analyzed by HPLC on a Partisil-10 SAX column. The galactosamine and glucosamine contents of glycosaminoglycans were determined by the Elson-Morgan method as modified by Strominger et al. (30.Strominger J.L. Park J.T. Thompson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 3263-3268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) after hydrolysis of the glycosaminoglycans with 6 M HCl at 100°C for 4 h. Uronic acid was determined by the method of Bitter and Muir(31.Bitter T. Muir H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (5217) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by a micro-BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. 6.6 ng of the enzyme protein was digested with 0.5 unit of N-glycanase at 37°C for 16 h according to the method recommended by the manufacturer except for omitting mercaptoethanol. In our previous study using CHO cells cultured on plates(15.Habuchi H. Habuchi O. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4172-4179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), HS2ST activity was hardly detected in the culture medium, although the CHO cell heparan sulfate contained HexA(2SO4) and GlcNSO3(6SO4) residues in a proportion of 4:3. To examine a possibility that HS2ST is retained in the cell layer, the activity in the cell extract was compared with that secreted into the medium as follows. The 35s-labeled products formed from CDSNS-heparin and [35s]PAPS by incubation with the spent medium or the crude extract of cultured CHO cells as an enzyme source was analyzed by HPLC on a PAMN column after the digestion with a mixture of heparitinases as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In the case of the products by the spent medium, major radioactivity was recovered in a peak of ΔDi-(6)diS, and a small amount of radioactivity was in a peak of ΔDi-(U)diS (ΔDi-(6)diS:ΔDi-(U)diS = 96:4) as described previously(15.Habuchi H. Habuchi O. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4172-4179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in the case of the products by the cell extract, major radioactivity was recovered in a peak of ΔDi-(U)diS, and only a small amount of radioactivity was in a peak of ΔDi-(6)diS (ΔDi-(U)diS:ΔDi-(6)diS = 92:8). As is evident from the summarized results (Table 1), the major sulfotransferase activity retained in the cell layer catalyzed the transfer of sulfate to position 2 of hexuronic acid residue in heparan sulfate, i.e. HS2ST. The similar results were also obtained when CHO cells were cultured in suspension in a spinner flask (data not shown), which enabled us to culture cells on a large scale. Therefore, spinner culture was chosen in place of adhesion culture to obtain CHO cells enough to purify HS2ST.Tabled 1 We successfully purified HS2ST from the extract of CHO cells to an apparent homogeneity with about 51,700-fold purification. Table 2 shows a summary of the purification of HS2ST from 1,800 ml of the crude extract (3.3 × 1010 cells). In this experiment, HS2ST activity was specifically determined using the standard assay mixtures containing 10 mM DTT as described under “Experimental Procedures.” DTT at this concentration had little effect on HS2ST activity as shown later, while HS6ST activity was substantially decreased(15.Habuchi H. Habuchi O. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4172-4179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).Tabled 1 The details for each purification step are as follows. The crude extract of CHO cells was applied to a heparin-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.15 M NaCl (Fig. 1). More than 75% of total proteins passed through the column, and most of the proteins absorbed to the column were eluted at the low NaCl concentration earlier than HS2ST activity. The sulfotransferase activity inhibited by DTT was noted in the early fractions (fraction number approximately 6). This chromatography brought a 1.9-fold increase of the total activity of HS2ST, suggesting that some inhibitors for HS2ST or degrading enzymes for substrate PAPS might have been removed at this step. This column chromatography resulted in a 44-fold purification of HS2ST. Since the sulfotransferase activity appeared to be stable in the higher concentration of NaCl, each fraction was collected in a tube containing 1 M NaCl in buffer A to make the 0.15 M NaCl solution. HS2ST was also strongly inhibited by 3′,5′-ADP, as observed with other glycosaminoglycan sulfotransferases(12.Pettersson I. Kusche M. Unger E. Wlad H. Nylund L. Lindahl U. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8044-8049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Habuchi H. Habuchi O. Kimata K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 21968-21974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of 3′,5′-ADP giving a 50% inhibition of this sulfotransferase activity was found to be less than 2.5 μM (data not shown). HS2ST activity at this step, therefore, was determined after the removal of 3′,5′-ADP by adsorbing HS2ST to a small heparin-Sepharose column (bed volume, 0.5 ml) and eluting it with 1 M NaCl in buffer A. The elution was performed with a linear gradient of NaCl concentration (Fig. 2). HS2ST activity was eluted with most of the proteins adsorbed to the column. The sulfotransferase activity inhibited by DTT was noted in the more retarded fractions on a downslope of the peak. This activity, judging from the elution position of HS6ST (around 0.8 M) as described previously(15.Habuchi H. Habuchi O. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4172-4179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), appeared to be brought by HS6ST. The fractions indicated by a horizontal bar in Fig. 2 were pooled. When an aliquot of this fraction was applied to a small heparin-Sepharose column and eluted with 1 M NaCl in buffer A, a 2-fold increase of HS2ST activity was detected, indicating that 3′,5′-ADP still existed in the pooled fractions. Therefore, the fraction was dialyzed against 1 M NaCl in buffer A to remove 3′,5′-ADP completely and then against 0.05 M NaCl in buffer A for the ne"

The active protein isolated from E. coli contains a pair of [2Fe-2S] clusters per SoxR dimer. We previously demonstrated that the iron-free protein (apo-SoxR), isolated during purification in thiol-containing buffers, binds soxS promoter DNA with an affinity equal to that of the metalloprotein (Fe-SoxR), but lacks significant ability to activate transcription in vitro. Here we demonstrate the reversibility of this process: the full transcriptional activity of SoxR can be restored by in vitro assembly of iron-sulfur clusters into the apoprotein. Two methods were used to synthesize the metallocenters of SoxR: (i) nonenzymatic, in which apo-SoxR, incubated in the presence of iron, inorganic sulfide, and a reducing agent, regained full transcriptional activity in 5-6 h; (ii) enzymatic, in which NifS protein of Azotobacter vinelandii regenerated active Fe-SoxR in as little as 2 min. Analysis by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy indicated that binuclear [2Fe-2S] clusters were restored by both the enzymatic and nonenzymatic reconstitutions. A mutant SoxR protein missing one of its four cysteine residues failed to undergo either transcriptional activation or the formation of [2Fe-2S] centers, even in the presence of NifS. Thus, only the presence of an iron-sulfur center is required to restore transcriptional activity to apo-SoxR. Moreover, the catalytic generation of [2Fe-2S] centers extends the known specificity of this enzyme beyond that already shown for [4Fe-4S] centers.

However, available intestinal cell lines that recapitulate a monolayer phenotype only express SGLT1 at low levels. Thus, to facilitate studies of the biology of SGLT1 function in epithelial monolayers, we engineered an epitope-tagged construct containing the YTDIEMNRLGK sequence (from the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein). The tag was placed at the carboxyl terminus since this is the least conserved portion of SGLT1. Transiently transfected COS-1 cells demonstrated surface expression of the immunoreactive protein and enhanced Na+-dependent glucose uptake that was phloridzin-sensitive (a specific competitive inhibitor of SGLT1). However, subsequent detailed analyses of epitope-tagged SGLT1 using stably transfected clones derived from the Caco-2 human intestinal epithelial cell line revealed substantial effects of the epitope on critical functions of SGLT1. When compared with native SGLT1 transfectants, the apparent Km for sugar transport was increased 23-fold (313 μM to 7.37 mM for native versus epitope-tagged SGLT1). In contrast, the apparent KNa for epitope-tagged SGLT1 was similar to that for native SGLT1. Permeabilization studies indicated that the C-terminal epitope tag was intracellular and thus could not directly disrupt extracellular ligand-binding sites. Immunolocalization and functional assays designed to detect polarized surface expression indicated that epitope tagging resulted in loss of apical targeting and enrichment of basolateral expression. Functional isolation of the small apical pool of epitope-tagged SGLT1 (by selective inhibition of basolateral epitope-tagged SGLT1) revealed that, despite the documented kinetic alterations in sugar transport, epitope-tagged SGLT1 could promote absorptive Na+ currents. These data show that 1) the C terminus of SGLT1 is intracellular; 2) disruption of protein structure by addition of a C-terminal tag leads to selective modifications of SGLT1 function; 3) the kinetics of sugar transport can be altered independently of influences on the Na+-binding site of SGLT1; and 4) the weak basolateral targeting sequence present within the epitope tag is dominant over endogenous SGLT1 apical targeting information and can direct polytopic membrane protein localization.

To further explore the role of Crk in NGF-induced PC-12 cell differentiation, we found that both NGF and epidermal growth factor stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous Crk II. Moreover, hormone stimulation enhanced the specific association of Crk proteins with the tyrosine-phosphorylated p130Cas, the major phosphotyrosine-containing protein in cells transformed with v-Crk. This interaction is mediated by the SH2 domain of Crk and can be inhibited with a phosphopeptide containing the Crk-SH2 binding motif.

Many receptors for growth and differentiation factors possess intrinsic protein-tyrosine kinase activity, which is increased following ligand binding, resulting in tyrosine autophosphorylation (1.Ullrich A.

These tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins serve as high affinity binding sites for Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing signaling proteins(2.Koch C.A. Anderson N. Moran F.M. Ellis C. Pawson T.

SH2 proteins can also contain src homology 3 (SH3) domains, regions that bind to proline-rich sequences in other proteins (9.Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G.

These bifunctional proteins are thought to couple tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors or their substrates via the SH2 domain to downstream effectors via SH3 binding. v-Crk encodes a viral Gag protein fused to one SH2 and one SH3 domain. Three cellular homologs of v-Crk have been identified, Crk-I, a 21-kDa protein with only one SH2 and SH3(14.Reichman C.T. Mayer B.J. Keshau S. Hanafusa H.

We report here that both NGF and EGF rapidly stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous CRK-II in PC-12 pheochromocytoma cells and induced its association with a variety of intracellular signaling proteins.

Before hormonal treatment, subconfluent cultures of cells grown in 100- or 150-mm dishes were serum-deprived for 12-24 h. Unless otherwise indicated, 100 nM NGF (Bioproducts for Science) or 100 ng/ml EGF (Collaborative Research) were added directly to the medium, and the incubation continued for the indicated times at 37°C. After hormonal treatment, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline before the addition of lysis buffer containing 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 100 mM NaF, 10 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and incubated on ice for 15 min. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C, equal protein concentrations of lysates were immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of anti-Crk-II, anti-p130Cas, or anti-paxillin antibodies (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). After 12 h at 4°C, immunoprecipitates were mixed with protein G/protein A-agarose (Oncogene Science) for 2 h, and the immunocomplexes were solubilized at 100°C for 5 min in 25 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Individual proteins were detected with the specified antibodies, and phosphotyrosine was detected using a mixture of the anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies RC20H (Transduction Laboratories) and 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Bound antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies followed by the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham Corp.). To reprobe immunoblots, the nitrocellulose membranes were incubated for 30 min at 60°C with 62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 2% SDS and 0.7% β-mercaptoethanol and then were washed extensively with 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, and 150 mM NaCl. Denaturing immunoprecipitation of tyrosine-phosphorylated Crk-II was performed by first immunoprecipitating Crk-II from untreated or treated cell lysates with anti-Crk-II antibodies as described above. After the immune complexes had been washed 3 times with lysis buffer, they were denatured by boiling in 50 μl of denaturing buffer (1% SDS, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.7) for 5 min. The agarose beads were pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatants were saved. To 25 μl of the supernatants were added 1 ml of the lysis buffer and 2 μg of the anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. The immune complexes were mixed with protein G/protein A-agarose, and the proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE as described above. Autoradiographs were quantified by computer-assisted video densitometry using the Bio Image system (Imaging Systems, Millipore Corp., Ann Arbor, MI). The glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein containing the SH2 domain of Crk was the generous gift of Drs. R. B. Birge and H. Hanafusa(19.Birge R.B. Fajardo E.J. Reichman C. Shoelson S.E. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4648-4656Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The GST-Grb2 fusion protein was described previously (30.Matsuoka K. Shibata M. Yamakawa A. Takenawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9015-9019Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and the generation and production of GST-Grb2-SH2 fusion protein was as described elsewhere(31.Lowenstein E.J. Daly R.J. Batzer A.G. Li W. Margolis B. Lammers R. Ullrich A. Skolnik E.Y. Bar-Sagi D. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1992; 70: 431-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar). For in vitro association experiments, GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione-agarose beads or GST alone were incubated for 90 min at 4°C with 250 μl of cell lysate (equivalent to 5 × 106 cells in lysis buffer). After washing the beads 3 times with lysis buffer, the adsorbed proteins were eluted and analyzed as described above for immunoprecipitates. The phosphotyrosine-containing peptides derived from the major phosphorylation sites of the EGF receptor, DADEpYLIPQQG (pY992), VPEpYINQSVPK (pY1068), and NPVpYHNQPLN (pY1086) were synthesized, purified, and characterized as described previously(32.McNamara D.J. Dobrusin E.M. Zhu G. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1993; 42: 240-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For phosphopeptide competition experiments, peptides (final concentration 100 μM) were preincubated with the GST-SH2 domain for 30 min prior to the addition of cell lysates, and the incubation continued for 90 min. After washing with lysis buffer, the SH2 bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and identified by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine or anti-p130Cas antibodies. The binding of NGF and EGF to their tyrosine kinase receptors in PC-12 cells induces their association with a variety of SH2-containing proteins. In some cases, recruitment of these proteins to the receptors can result in their tyrosine phosphorylation(33.Ohmichi M. Decker S.J. Pang L. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14858-14861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Ohmichi M. Matsuoka K. Takenawa T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1143-1148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). v-Crk overexpression in PC-12 cells markedly enhanced both NGF- and EGF-induced differentiation. Moreover, v-Crk is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to both NGF and EGF in these cells(26.Hempstead B.L. Birge R.B. Fajardo E.J. Glassman D. Mahadeo R. Kraemer R. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1964-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Because of the proposed role for Crk in NGF signaling pathways in PC-12 cells, we first examined the growth factor-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous Crk proteins in these cells. PC-12 cells were treated with NGF or EGF for 1 min, and lysates were precipitated with anti-Crk-II antibodies. The resulting immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig. 1A). Both NGF and EGF stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of an immunoprecipitated protein migrating with an apparent molecular mass of 42 kDa (Fig. 1A). When the membrane used for the experiment shown in panel A was stripped of the antibodies and reprobed with the anti-Crk-II antiserum, we detected predominately the 40-kDa form of Crk-II with only a trace of the 42-kDa form (Fig. 1B). This pattern was identical in both unstimulated and stimulated cells, as was reported(22.Matsuda M. Hashimoto Y. Muroya K. Hasegawa H. Kurata T. Tanaka S. Nakamura S. Hattori S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5495-5500Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Thus, the growth factors appear to selectively produce the phosphorylation of the higher molecular weight form of Crk-II, in agreement with previous studies demonstrating that the extended 42-kDa form of Crk-II is modestly tyrosine-phosphorylated by EGF in human carcinoma A431 cells overexpressing this form of Crk(35.Fajardo E.J. Birge R.B. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7295-7302Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The proteins in the anti-Crk-II immunoprecipitates were subjected to second round of immunoprecipitation under denaturing conditions with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, followed by immunoblotting with anti-Crk-II antibodies (Fig. 1C). A single band was recognized by the anti-Crk-II antibodies in the anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates. This band appears to comigrate with the 42-kDa form of Crk-II in the control loading. On the basis of comparison of the Crk-II signals present in the loading control (Fig. 1C, lane 4, 50% of the material used in the first round) and the anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates (lanes 2 and 3), we estimated that a significant proportion of the Crk-II (about 30-40%) is tyrosine-phosphorylated. Furthermore, it appears that the more slowly migrating species of Crk-II, which is phosphorylated on tyrosine (Fig. 1A), preferentially bound to the anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. These results further established the fact that Crk-II undergoes an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation upon NGF or EGF stimulation. In previous studies, a 130-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein was detected in fibroblasts transformed by v-Crk as well as by the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase v-Src(17.Matsuda M. Mayer B.J. Fukui Y. Hanafusa H. Science. 1990; 248: 1537-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 20.Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). This protein was subsequently identified as p130Cas(20.Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Although it is apparently devoid of kinase activity, p130Cas has an SH3 domain and clusters of tyrosine phosphorylation sites with proline in the +3 position, suggesting that it might specifically interact with the Crk SH2 domain(9.Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2391) Google Scholar). Therefore, we were interested to determine whether stimulation of PC-12 cells with growth factors could produce the tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas. PC-12 cells were treated with 100 nM NGF or 100 ng/ml EGF for the indicated times. Lysates were prepared and incubated with anti-p130Cas antibodies, and the precipitated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig. 2A). When immunoprecipitated from untreated PC-12 cells, p130Cas exhibited a low level of tyrosine phosphorylation. Both NGF and EGF induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas within 1 min of exposure. This phosphorylation remained stable for 30 min. In addition, the tyrosine phosphorylation of two proteins with apparent molecular masses values of 42 and 50 kDa were also increased in these immunoprecipitates in response to NGF and EGF. In normal 3Y1 cells, p130Cas was detected as multiple bands at ~115 and 125 kDa. Cellular transformation by v-Crk is associated with the appearance of a broad 130-kDa band(20.Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). It appears, therefore, that in NGF- and EGF-stimulated PC-12 cells, p130Cas is also detected as a broad band, perhaps due to different phosphorylation states. The blot was completely stripped of the anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, and the region between the 68- and 200-kDa prestained molecular size markers was excised and reprobed with anti-p130Cas antibodies (Fig. 2B). p130Cas was precipitated equally from all samples and comigrated with the major phosphotyrosine-containing protein detected in this size range. In order to identify the 42-kDa phosphotyrosine-containing protein, the region between the 29- and 68-kDa prestained molecular size markers was immunoblotted with anti-Crk-II antibodies. Although v-Crk overexpressed in 3Y1 cells could be immunoprecipitated with anti-p130Cas antibodies(20.Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar), we were unable to detect Crk-II proteins by blotting with anti-Crk-II antibodies the anti-p130Cas immunoprecipitates from NGF- or EGF-treated cells. It appears that the level of expression of the 42-kDa form of Crk-II is very low compared with the 40-kDa form (Fig. 1B). It is therefore possible that the relative amount of this form of Crk-II coimmunoprecipitated with the anti-p130Cas antibodies is substantially lower than that immunoprecipitated with anti-Crk-II antibodies and cannot be detected under these conditions. To further explore the growth factor-dependent interaction of endogenous Crk-II with p130Cas, PC-12 cells were treated with NGF or EGF for 1 min, and lysates were incubated with anti-Crk-II, anti-p130Cas, or anti-SH PTP2 (Syp) (8.Feng G-S. Hui C-C. Pawson T. Science. 1993; 259: 1607-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar) antibodies prior to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-p130Cas antiserum (Fig. 3). The p130Cas protein was easily detected in the anti-p130Cas precipitates from both untreated or treated cells. Interestingly, treatment of cells with NGF or EGF resulted in increased association of p130Cas with Crk-II, as detected in the anti-Crk-II precipitates. We recently reported that insulin, NGF, and EGF stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of two proteins with molecular masses between 115 and 125 kDa that specifically immunoprecipitated with anti-Syp antibodies (36.Yamauchi K. Ribon V. Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17716-17722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, no p130Cas immunoreactive species were detected in anti-Syp immunoprecipitates, indicating that Syp-associated phosphoproteins are not related to p130Cas. Moreover, p130Cas did not associate with other SH2/SH3-containing proteins including Nck and Shc (data not shown), demonstrating a specific interaction between Crk-II and p130Cas. The concentration dependence of the effect of NGF and EGF on the appearance of the Crk-p130Cas complex in PC-12 cells was also evaluated (Fig. 4). Increasing concentrations of NGF or EGF were added to PC-12 cells for 1 min. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Crk-II antibodies followed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine, anti-Crk-II, or anti-p130Cas antibodies. Immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies revealed an increase in tyrosine-phosphorylated 125-135-kDa protein associating with endogenous Crk (Fig. 4A). This increase was observed with as little as 1 nM NGF and 1 ng/ml EGF. The samples contained equal amounts of Crk-II as detected with anti-Crk-II antibodies immunoblotting (Fig. 4B). To test whether the 125-135-kDa phosphoprotein is p130Cas, the same blot was stripped and reprobed with anti-p130Cas antibodies. Fig. 4C shows that p130Cas comigrated on SDS-PAGE with the 125-135-kDa phosphotyrosine-containing protein. Experiments with peptide libraries suggested that the SH2 domain of Crk specifically binds to phosphotyrosine residues containing the primary sequence pYXXP(9.Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2391) Google Scholar), of which there are 15 in p130Cas(20.Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). The interactions of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins with the SH2 domain of Crk were further examined in PC-12 cells stimulated with NGF or EGF using the SH2 domain of Crk expressed as a GST fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads. Following treatment of PC-12 cells with NGF or EGF for 1 min, lysates were precipitated with GST-fusion proteins of Crk-SH2 or Grb2-SH2 or GST alone. The precipitates were washed, and the bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. As shown in Fig. 5A, both GST-Crk-SH2 and GST-Grb2-SH2 but not GST alone precipitated a 170-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein present in EGF-treated PC-12 cells that was shown to be the EGF receptor (data not shown and (26.Hempstead B.L. Birge R.B. Fajardo E.J. Glassman D. Mahadeo R. Kraemer R. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1964-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and (34.Ohmichi M. Matsuoka K. Takenawa T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1143-1148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) ). Additionally, both NGF and EGF stimulated the interaction of 125-135-kDa and 70-kDa phosphotyrosine-containing proteins with GST-Crk-SH2 but not with GST-Grb2-SH2 or GST alone. GST-Grb2-SH2 precipitated a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein migrating at approximately 52 kDa, previously identified as Shc(34.Ohmichi M. Matsuoka K. Takenawa T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1143-1148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether the 125-135-kDa phosphotyrosine-containing protein that bound to GST-Crk-SH2 is p130Cas, the same blot was stripped and reprobed with anti-p130Cas antibodies. Fig. 5B shows that p130Cas comigrated on SDS-PAGE with the 125-135-kDa phosphotyrosine-containing protein complexed with GST-Crk-SH2 but not with GST-Grb2-SH2 or GST alone. Both NGF and EGF have been shown to stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin (data not shown and (26.Hempstead B.L. Birge R.B. Fajardo E.J. Glassman D. Mahadeo R. Kraemer R. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1964-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar)). The 70-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein precipitated with GST-Crk-SH2 was confirmed to be paxillin by reprobing the blot with anti-paxillin antibodies (Fig. 5C). Paxillin failed to bind to GST alone or to the SH2 domain of Grb2. Recently, studies indicated that the focal adhesion kinase (p125FAK)-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin creates binding sites for Crk(37.Schaller M.D. Parsons T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the ability of the isolated SH2 domain of Crk to precipitate p125FAK from PC-12 cells treated with NGF or EGF. Fig. 5D shows an anti-p125FAK immunoblot of cell lysates from NGF- or EGF-treated PC-12 cells incubated with GST-Crk-SH2 or GST-Grb2-SH2. Anti-p125FAK antibodies were able to detect p125FAK only in samples precipitated with GST-Crk-SH2 from cells treated with NGF or EGF. To further explore the specificity of GST-Crk-SH2 binding to these phosphoproteins, we assessed the ability of phosphopeptides derived from three of the major autophosphorylation sites of the EGF receptor (Tyr992, Tyr1068, and Tyr1086) to affect GST-Crk-SH2 interactions with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. GST-Crk-SH2 or GST-Grb2-SH2 was preincubated with the phosphopeptides at 100 μM prior to the addition of lysates from PC-12 cells that had been treated with NGF or EGF. As evident from the anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting of the bound proteins (Fig. 6A), binding of the EGF receptor and p130Cas to GST-Crk-SH2 was quantitatively inhibited by the phosphopeptide DADEpYLIPQQG (pY992) which contains proline in the +3 position relative to tyrosine, indicating a Crk-SH2 binding motif. The peptide NPVpYHNQPLN (pY1086) only partially inhibited the binding of GST-Crk-SH2, while the phosphopeptide VPEpYINQSVPK (pY1068) had no effect. Reprobing the same immunoblot with anti-p130Cas antibodies revealed a concordant decrease in the amount of p130Cas associated with the Crk-SH2 domain in the presence of pY992 and pY1086 (Fig. 6B). The SH2 region of Grb2 is predicted to bind to a consensus sequence pYXNY(38.Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. McGlade J. Olivier P. Pawson T. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Sabe H. Hanafusa H. Yi T. Ren R. Baltimore D. Ratnofsky S. Feldman R.A. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). The high affinity binding site for Grb2 on the EGF receptor has been mapped to the autophosphorylation site Tyr1068(39.Batzer A.G. Rotin D. Urena J.M. Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5192-5203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both phosphotyrosine peptides, pY1068 and pY1086, which contain potential Grb2-SH2 recognition sites, completely inhibited GST-Grb2-SH2 binding to the tyrosine-phosphorylated EGF receptor from PC-12 cells treated with EGF. However, the pY992 peptide that does not contain this motif had no effect on GST-Grb2-SH2 binding (Fig. 6A). Cellular overexpression of the oncogenic form of Crk leads to cell transformation and elevation of intracellular phosphotyrosine levels of specific proteins(11.Mayer B.J. Hamaguchi M. Hanafusa H. Nature. 1988; 332: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 15.Matsuda M. Tanaka S. Nagata S. Kojima A. Kurata T. Shibuya M. Mol. Cell.

Moreover, overexpression of v-Crk in PC-12 cells accelerates their differentiation in response to both NGF and EGF(26.Hempstead B.L. Birge R.B. Fajardo E.J. Glassman D. Mahadeo R. Kraemer R. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1964-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Although this protein apparently lacks catalytic activity, both its transforming and differentiating functions require intact SH2 and SH3 domains(14.Reichman C.T. Mayer B.J. Keshau S. Hanafusa H. Cell Growth & Differ. 1992; 3: 451-460PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Matsuda M. Mayer B.J. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1607-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 25.Tanaka S. Hattori S. Kurata T. Nagashima K. Fukui Y. Nakamura S. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4409-4415Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Crk has been shown to associate with two guanine nucleotide exchange proteins, Sos and C3G, via its SH3 domain(22.Matsuda M. Hashimoto Y. Muroya K. Hasegawa H. Kurata T. Tanaka S. Nakamura S. Hattori S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5495-5500Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 23.Tanaka S. Morishita T. Hashimoto Y. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Masabumi S. Matsuoka K. Takenawa T. Kurata T.

Chem. 1994; 269: 32781-32787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a role in regulating the Ras signaling pathway. Additionally, Crk proteins can undergo tyrosine phosphorylation in transformed cells or in response to growth factors (21.Feller S.M. Knudsen B.S. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 26.Hempstead B.L. Birge R.B. Fajardo E.J. Glassman D. Mahadeo R. Kraemer R. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell.

Although transfection studies with v-Crk have suggested that this protein plays a major role in tyrosine kinase-initiated signals, little is known about the interactions of endogenous Crk family members. We report here that treatment of PC-12 cells with NGF or EGF causes the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of the 42-kDa form of endogenous Crk-II. In addition to Crk, the NGF- and EGF-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of another SH2 and SH3 domain-containing adapter, Nck, has been reported(41.Park D. Rhee S.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5816-5823Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 42.Li W. Hu P. Skolnik E.Y. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5824-5833Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), although Grb2 is not tyrosine-phosphorylated after exposure to any growth factor(12.Gale N.W. Kaplan S. Lowenstein E.J. Schlessinger J. Bar-Sagi D. Nature. 1993; 363: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The role of the tyrosine phosphorylation of Crk is not clear, but this modification may modulate interactions of the Crk-SH3 domain. Alternatively, the tyrosine phosphorylation of Crk may induce its interaction with other SH2-containing signaling proteins, or perhaps it can produce an intramolecular interaction. In this regard, the c-Abl kinase binds to the Crk-SH3 domain and tyrosine-phosphorylates c-Crk on a single tyrosine, which creates a binding site for Crk-SH2 domain(21.Feller S.M. Knudsen B.S. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 43.Rosen M.K. Yamazakl T. Gish G.D. Kay C.M. Pawson T. Kay L.E. Science. 1995; 374: 477-495Google Scholar). In addition to its tyrosine phosphorylation, Crk is also known to associate with certain tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins via its SH2 domain(17.Matsuda M. Mayer B.J. Fukui Y. Hanafusa H. Science. 1990; 248: 1537-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 18.Matsuda M. Mayer B.J. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1607-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 19.Birge R.B. Fajardo E.J. Reichman C. Shoelson S.E. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4648-4656Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The major phosphotyrosine-containing protein detected in v-Crk-transformed cells has recently been cloned(20.Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). This 130-kDa protein, called Cas, associates directly with v-Crk in these cells (20.Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). We report here that treatment of PC-12 cells with NGF or EGF produced p130Cas tyrosine phosphorylation and enhanced its association with endogenous Crk-II. Because p130Cas contains 15 potential Crk-SH2 recognition sites, we suspected that p130Cas might associate with the SH2 domain of the later protein. This interaction was directly demonstrated using a GST-fusion protein containing the SH2 domain of Crk. These data suggest that upon stimulation of PC-12 cells with NGF or EGF, p130Cas undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation, further inducing its binding to Crk. Although the significance of this association is not known, Crk can be constitutively associated with the nucleotide exchange factor C3G. Thus, one possible physiological role for the p130Cas-Crk-C3G complex in tyrosine kinase-induced signaling may involve targeting the activation of p21ras or a member of the Ras family of GTPases. A low but detectable level of tyrosine-phosphorylated p130Cas that is already associated with Crk could be detected in nonactivated PC-12 cells (Fig. 2A and Fig. 4A). While this work was under review, several reports have demonstrated adhesion-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas, suggesting a role for p130Cas in integrin-mediated signal transduction(44.Nojima Y. Morino N. Mimura T. Hamasaki K. Furuya H. Sakai R. Sato T. Tachibana K. Morimoto C. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol.

It is therefore possible that the low level of p130Cas tyrosine phosphorylation seen in unstimulated PC-12 cells is due to the adhesion of the cells to the dishes. However, it is possible that even a 3-4-fold increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas in response to NGF or EGF and its interaction with Crk further amplify and propagate NGF and EGF signaling. Following NGF or EGF treatment of PC-12 cells, GST-Crk-SH2 also binds the tyrosine-phosphorylated paxillin, a focal adhesion-associated protein. Paxillin becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to a number of stimuli (26.Hempstead B.L. Birge R.B. Fajardo E.J. Glassman D. Mahadeo R. Kraemer R. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1995; 15: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). The exact role of paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation in cytoskeleton organization is not completely understood. It has been shown that the tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin by p125FAK creates binding sites for the Crk-SH2 domain(37.Schaller M.D. Parsons T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we detected p125FAK with Crk-SH2-associated proteins. However, the presence of p125FAK in this complex may be mediated through its interaction with paxillin. Moreover, p125FAK may also phosphorylate other proteins present in this complex, including p130Cas or Crk itself. Despite the relatively high binding affinity of Crk to phosphorylated paxillin in vitro, so far we have detected neither paxillin nor p125FAK in anti-Crk immunoprecipitates. Similarly, we did not observe the coimmunoprecipitation of the EGF receptor with Crk in PC-12 cells. This may reflect the relative instability of such interactions or may indicate that the association is below the limit of detection. Consistent with this later possibility, both the EGF receptor and paxillin are coimmunoprecipitated with v-Crk in PC-12 cells expressing v-Crk(26.Hempstead B.L. Birge R.B. Fajardo E.J. Glassman D. Mahadeo R. Kraemer R. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1964-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the association of Crk with tyrosine-phosphorylated p130Cas is easily detected in PC-12 cells in a growth factor-dependent manner. The multitude of interactions described here indicate that Crk is indeed a versatile signaling molecule that is likely to participate in a number of pathways. Its interactions with p130Cas and C3G via SH2 and SH3 domains suggest that Crk may play a key role as an adapter targeting nucleotide exchange factors for Ras and its homologs. However, the growth factor-dependent interaction of Crk with paxillin and therefore the potential interaction with p125FAK suggests that it may play a separate role in regulating cytoskeletal interactions that result from tyrosine phosphorylation. Thus, Crk proteins belong to a family of bifunctional adapter molecules that link tyrosine phosphorylation to a multitude of downstream cellular processes.

https://openalex.org/W1536840617,"While the functions of several G protein α subunits such as αs and αq are relatively well understood, the action of others such as α13 remain largely undefined. Because of recent interest in regulation of nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) by G protein-coupled signaling systems and findings that receptors for two proinflammatory substances, thrombin and thromboxane couple to α13, we studied the effect of α13 on NOS activity in a renal epithelial cell line. We found that stable overexpression of α13 or its GTPase-deficient mutant, α13Q226L, in a continuous renal epithelial cell line (MCT) increased NOS activity. The increased NOS activity was due to increased expression of the macrophage-inducible form of NOS (iNOS). iNOS protein and activity were not increased in similar cells expressing an activated αs (αsQ227L) or were minimally increased in cells expressing activated αi1 (αi1Q204L) and αq (αqQ209L), members of the three other G protein α chain families. Transient co-expression of α13 or α13Q226L increased the activity of an iNOS promoter-CAT construct demonstrating that α13 increases iNOS expression through transcription. Consequently, α13 induces iNOS through a novel mechanism that is distinct from that of other G protein α chains and that may mediate the actions of G protein-dependent proinflammatory agents."

Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3320) Google Scholar), each of which contains two transmembrane domains and, usually, two nucleotide binding folds. CFTR contains, in addition, a large intracellular regulatory (R) domain(2.Riordan J.R. Rommens J.M. Kerem B.-S. Alon N. Rozmahel R. Grzelczak Z. Zielenski J. Lok S. Plavsic N. Chou J.-L. Drumm M.L.

Some voltage-dependent ion channels, such as the Shaker K+ channel, inactivate or close by the “ball and chain” mechanism(10.Armstrong C.M. Bezanilla F. Rojas E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1973; 62: 375-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal portion of the Shaker K+ channel serves as the “ball” that occludes the conductance pathway of the open K+ channel(11.Zagotta W.N. Hoshi T. Aldrich R.W. Science. 1990; 250: 568-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). It is not known, however, whether the R domain of CFTR functions as a gaing particle for the Cl- channel. In favor of this possibility is the observation that deletion of 130 amino acids from the R domain results in a constitutively open channel(8.Rich D.P. Gregory R.J. Anderson M.P. Manavalan P. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Science. 1991; 253: 205-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the R domain of CFTR is quite large (over 250 amino acids) compared with the putative “ball” for the Shaker K+ channel, which is less than 25 amino acids in length. We took a reconstitutional approach in an attempt to search for the putative gating particle of the CFTR Cl- channel. First, the R domain protein (RDP) was expressed as a peptide in vitro in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. Second, the wild type CFTR cDNA was subcloned into an eukaryotic expression vector pCEP4 and expressed in a human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK 293), from which the microsomal membrane vesicles were isolated and incorporated into lipid bilayers where the CFTR channel activity can be directly assessed. Alternatively, CFTR channels were incorporated into the planar lipid bilayer from vesicles prepared from T84 cells, a human colon carcinoma cell line that expresses abundant CFTR. The effect of RDP on the CFTR channel was then tested in the lipid bilayer reconstitution system. We reasoned that if the R domain, or portions of it, function as a “ball” or gating particle for CFTR, then exogenous R domain protein might enter the CFTR pore or vestibule when the channel is open and block it. Alternatively, if the open configuration of CFTR is stabilized by intramolecular interactions of the R domain with other portions of the molecule, then exogenous R domain might hold the channel in the closed state by occupying this putative intramolecular binding site and preventing the endogenous R domain from assuming the open configuration. Based on the function of intact CFTR, in which phosphorylation at a single site in the R domain is sufficient to induce channel opening in the presence of ATP(9.Rich D.P. Berger H.A. Cheng S.H. Travis S.M. Saxena M. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20259-20267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we postulated that the open channel block model, in which R domain protein blocks the conduction pore, would most likely require unphosphorylated R domain to block, whereas block of the closed channel by the R domain protein occupying an intramolecular stabilization site would probably be favored by phosphorylation of the exogenous R domain. A pseudogene was constructed by polymerase chain reaction to amplify the R domain of CFTR. The pseudogene contains the entire exon 13 plus 85 bases of exon 14, with AGCTTATGGAAAG added at the 5′ end and TGATCTAGAG at the 3′ end for ease of cloning and to provide translational initiation and termination sites. The R pseudogene was ligated 5′ to 3′ into the HindIII and BamHI sites of pBluescript SKII (Stratagene). The HindIII-BamHI orientation allowed for sense transcription of the R domain pseudogene from the T7 promoter. The RDP was made in vitro using the TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). SDS-PAGE was performed on the translation products with electroelution of the gel onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.5% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and 1% bovine serum albumin and then incubated with antibody (mouse monoclonal anti-human CFTR exon 13) against the R domain (Genzyme). A secondary peroxidase-conjugated affinity-purified goat antibody to mouse IgG was added to allow visualization of the RDP-antibody complex. For every in vitro translation, production of RDP was verified by either incubating an aliquot of the translation mix with [35S]methionine and subsequent SDS-PAGE and autoradiography to identify the labeled 35-kDa band or by Western blotting of an aliquot of unlabeled translation product with antibody against the R domain of CFTR to identify the R domain protein. Two control translation mixes were prepared. For one, no exogenous DNA or RNA was added to the reticulocyte lysate system, and when [35S]methionine was added to this mix and incubated exactly as for the R domain translation, no translated protein bands were detected on autoradiography (Fig. 1A, lane 1). This mix does, however, contain all of the endogenous reticulocyte lysate proteins. The second control translation mix was obtained by expressing the six proteins of the brome mosaic virus, one of which migrates on electrophoresis at about 35 kDa, where the R domain protein migrates. This control provides not only the ribosomes and proteins of the reticulocyte but also complete and possibly nascent proteins of about the same molecular weight as the R domain translation product. The wild type CFTR cDNA (12.Drumm M.L. Pope H.A. Cliff W.H. Rommens J.M. Marvin S.A. Tsui L.-C. Collins F.S. Frizzel R.A. Wilson J.M.

A human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK 293-EBNA, Invitrogen) was used for the transfection and expression of CFTR protein. The cell line contains a vector pCMV-EBNA, which constitutively expresses the Epstein-Barr virus EBNA-1 gene product and increases the transfection efficiency of Epstein-Barr virus-based vectors. The parent cell line was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 1% glutamine. Geneticin (G418, 250 μg/ml) was added to the cell culture medium to maintain selection of the cells containing pCMV-EBNA vector until after the CFTR gene transfer. pCEP4(CFTR) was then introduced to the cell using the Lipofectin reagent. Two days after transfection, the cells were passed and selected for hygromycin resistance (hygromycin B, 260 μg/ml). Three weeks after selection, the cells were used for the isolation of the microsomal vesicles. The expression of CFTR protein was detected by the Western blot using antibody against the R domain of CFTR. Microsomal vesicles were isolated from HEK 293 cells expressing the wild type CFTR protein(13.Xie J. Drumm M.L. Ma J. Davis P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28084-28091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Twelve 75-cm2 flasks of 293 HEK cells transfected with pCEP4(CFTR) vectors were harvested. The cell pellet was resuspended in ice-cold hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 1 mM EDTA, 5 μM diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 mg/ml benzamidine) prior to lysis by 10 strokes in a tight fitting Dounce homogenizer, followed by 15 strokes after addition of an equal volume of sucrose buffer (500 mM sucrose, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2). Microsomes were collected by centrifugation of postnuclear supernatant (600 × g, 15 min) at 100,000 × g for 45 min and resuspended with 1.0 ml of prephosphorylation buffer (250 mM sucrose, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 5 mM Mg-ATP, and 100 units/ml PKA catalytic subunit). The membrane vesicles were stored at a protein concentration of 2-6 mg/ml at −75°C until use. Usually, 1-3 μl of microsomal membrane vesicles was added to the cis solution (1-ml volume) for the incorporation of CFTR channels. T84 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:Ham's F12 medium (1:1 ratio) with 5% fetal bovine serum and 2 mM glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Microsomal membrane vesicles from T84 cells were isolated following the procedure of Tilly et al.(14.Tilly B.C. Winter M.C. Ostedgaard L.S. O'Riordan C. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9470-9473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were homogenized in a buffer containing 250 mM sucrose, 2 mM EDTA, 10 mM HEPES-Tris (pH 7.4) plus protease inhibitors. The nuclei and mitochondria were removed by centrifugation at 4500 × g. The resulting plasma membrane was pelleted by centrifugation at 45,000 × g and resuspended in 150 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES-Tris (pH 7.2) at a protein concentration of 1-3 mg/ml. The membrane vesicles were stored at −75°C until use. Lipid bilayer membranes were formed across an aperture of ~200 μm diameter with a lipid mixture of phosphatidylethanolamine:phosphatidylserine:cholesterol in a ratio of 6:6:1; the lipids were dissolved in decane at a concentration of 40 mg/ml(13.Xie J. Drumm M.L. Ma J. Davis P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28084-28091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The recording solutions contained: cis (intracellular), 200 mM KCl, 2 mM ATP, 1 mM MgCl2, and 10 mM HEPES-Tris (pH 7.4); trans (extracellular), 50 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES-Tris (pH 7.4). Microsomal vesicles (1-3 μl) containing wild type CFTR proteins were added to the cis solution. 50 units/ml PKA catalytic subunit (Promega) were always present in the cis solution. The experimental conditions selected only CFTR channels that were oriented in the bilayer membrane in the cis intracellular trans extracellular manner. To maintain stability of the bilayer membrane and the CFTR channel activities, designed pulse protocols were used to measure currents through the single CFTR channels. The bilayer membrane was kept at a holding potential of 0 mV and pulsed to different test potentials of either 2- or 5-s durations. The interval between consecutive episodes was 10 s. Single channel currents were recorded with an Axopatch 200A patch clamp unit (Axon Instrument). Data acquisition and pulse generation are performed with a 486 computer and 1200 Digidata A/D-D/A convertor (Axon Instrument). The currents were sampled at 1-2.5 ms/point and filtered at 60 Hz through an 8-pole Bessel filter. Single channel data analyses were performed with pClamp, TIPS, and custom softwares. When no source of DNA or mRNA was included in the reticulocyte lysate translation mix, no [35S]methionine-labeled translation products were detected by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (Fig. 1A, lane 1). However, when a Bluescript plasmid containing the gene encoding RDP, which contained the entire exon 13 plus 85 base pairs of exon 14 or 28 amino acids was included, a translation product was detected at molecular mass of ~35 kDa (Fig. 1A, lane 2). The R domain contains a second ATG codon in frame at a site nine amino acids downstream from the initial start site, and this second start site probably accounts for the doublet appearance of the protein. The apparent molecular mass of this protein is slightly higher that the calculated molecular mass (32 kDa) for reasons that are not entirely clear. However, this protein appears to be the authentic R domain protein because (i) sequencing of the gene from which it was translated agreed with the reported sequence of the R domain; (ii) unlabeled translation product on SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and Western blotting with antibody directed against the R domain gives a doublet signal at a molecular mass identical to the 35S-labeled translation product (Fig. 1A, lane 3); and (iii) unlabeled translation product can be immunoprecipitated with anti-R domain antibody and phosphorylated with protein kinase A (Fig. 1A, lane 4). The concentration of RDP in the translation mix varied from 30 to 70 ng/ml, based on the incorporation of [35S]methionine (n = 3). CFTR was expressed by transfecting the CFTR cDNA under cytomegalovirus promoter control into the HEK 293 cells(13.Xie J. Drumm M.L. Ma J. Davis P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28084-28091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). After expression of the CFTR protein, microsomal membrane vesicles were isolated from the HEK 293 cells. The Western blot shows that these vesicles contain abundant CFTR protein (Fig. 1B). Alternatively, vesicles prepared from T84 cells were used for bilayer fusion. To measure the CFTR channel activities, 2 mM Mg-ATP and 50 units/ml catalytic subunit of PKA were always present in the cis intracellular solution. If PKA and ATP were not present in the cis solution, no CFTR-like channels were detected in 21 bilayer fusions with HEK293 vesicles and more than 100 fusions with T84 vesicles. In a KCl concentration gradient of 200 mM (cis)/50 mM (trans), a single CFTR channel had a linear conductance of 8.2 ± 0.6 pS, with a reversal potential of +22 ± 1.4 mV. At −80 mV, the channel had an average open probability of 0.318 ± 0.028, with mean open lifetimes of ¬o1 = 23.6 ms and Ƭo2 = 110 ms (n = 76)(13.Xie J. Drumm M.L. Ma J. Davis P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28084-28091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Values were the same for channels from T84 vesicles, except for a small difference in the relative occurrence of Ƭo1 and Ƭo2(15.Tao T. Xie J. Drumm M.L. Zhao J. Davis P.B. Ma J. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 743-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). An inhibitor of the CFTR channel, diphenylcarboxylate (3 mM), when added to the trans solution, completely blocked channel activity. 4,4′-Diisothiocyanate 2,2′-stilbene disulfonate (0.5 mM) added to both solutions had no effect on the channel. These properties are those reported for and expected for CFTR(16.Gadsby D.C. Nairn A.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 513-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Vesicles prepared from untransfected HEK 293 cells never displayed chloride conductances with these properties. When the exogenous RDP was applied to the intracellular solution, it produced a transient block of the CFTR channel (Fig. 2). Closure was maintained for at least 10 min. This was not due to changes in the bilayer environment, as the base line remained essentially unchanged during the entire period of the experiment (~40 min). Also, subsequent addition of more RDP produced a second round of channel block followed by recovery (data not shown). This transient block is not due to nonspecific effects of the reticulocyte lysate translation mix, for the mix alone, added at the same concentration, had no effect (n = 3). Furthermore, the transient block is not a nonspecific effect of a translated protein or protein-ribosome complex of similar molecular weight as RDP. The brome mosaic virus genes were translated in the reticulocyte lysate translation mix, and one of the protein products has similar apparent molecular mass (35 kDa) to RDP. Addition of this translation mix did not affect the CFTR Cl- channel activity (n = 3). The data in Fig. 2 are representative of a total of seven different experiments, but in two experiments, complete channel closure was not detected. Exogenous RDP blocked the CFTR Cl- channel when added to the intracellular side (that is, the same side as contains PKA and ATP) but not to the extracellular side (Fig. 3, n = 3). RDP had no effect on a small conductance 4,4′-diisothiocyanate 2,2′-stilbene disulfonate-sensitive Cl- channel detected in the T84 cells (3.2 pS, distinct from the CFTR channel)(15.Tao T. Xie J. Drumm M.L. Zhao J. Davis P.B. Ma J. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 743-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 17.Gabriel S.E. Price E.M. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C708-C713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A, n = 6) nor on a 98-pS cation channel endogenous to the T84 cells (Fig. 4B, n = 5). The results indicate that RDP binds specifically to the intracellular portion of the CFTR protein, and the results are the same whether native CFTR or heterologously expressed CFTR is studied.Figure 4:Lack of effects of R domain protein on other ion channels in T84 cells. With the same recording solution (200 mM KCl (cis)/50 mM KCl (trans)), two other types of ion channels were also encountered in the microsomal vesicles isolated from T84 cells. The traces shown in A were taken from a small conductance, diphenylcarboxylate-insensitive Cl- channel. The channel had slope conductance of 3.2 ± 0.8 pS, with reversal potential of 24.5 ± 2.8 mV (data not shown). Open probability of this small conductance chloride channel did not change when 20 μl of RDP was added to both sides of the channel. The traces shown in B were obtained from a large conductance K+ channel. This channel is insensitive to inhibition by RDP (20 μl added to the cis solution). The marks on the right of each panel indicate the base-line levels. The records in A were filtered at 40 Hz frequency, and those in B were filtered at 300 Hz frequency.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since these initial experiments were conducted with active PKA plus ATP present on the intracellular side of the channel and we have shown that the R domain protein is susceptible to phosphorylation by PKA (Fig. 1A, lane 4), it is likely that the RDP, though not phosphorylated when it is added to the bilayer system, undergoes phosphorylation during the course of the experiment. To test the role of phosphorylation in mediating the effect of RDP block of the CFTR channel, two sets of experiments were performed. First, to prevent phosphorylation of RDP, a specific peptide inhibitor for PKA, protein kinase inhibitor (PKI), was added to the recording solution before the addition of RDP (Fig. 5). The inclusion of PKI did not cause rundown of CFTR channels in the bilayer either for heterologously expressed channels in HEK293 cells or for endogenous T84 channels, suggesting that the CFTR channels, once phosphorylated by PKA, did not undergo dephosphorylation in the bilayer membrane over the time course of the experiment (10-45 min, n = 2, T84 cells; n = 11, transfected HEK293 cells). In other words, phosphatases were not active in the vesicles fused with the bilayer membrane. These results are similar to those reported by Anderson et al.(5.Anderson M.P. Berger H.A. Rich D.P. Gregory R.J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Cell. 1991; 67: 775-784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) in patch clamp studies of CFTR. Under these conditions, in which RDP cannot be phosphorylated, addition of RDP resulted in an irreversible block of CFTR channels (Fig. 5). In addition, the RDP was phosphorylated in a test tube before addition to the recording solution. The phosphorylated RDP had no significant effect on the channel activities over a period of 12 min (Fig. 6, n = 3).Figure 6:Prephosphorylation of R domain protein eliminates its inhibitory activity. The RDP was prephosphorylated in a test tube with 100 units/ml catalytic subunit of PKA and 5 mM Mg-ATP before addition to the CFTR channel, which was captured in a vesicle from HEK293 cells. Under control conditions, the bilayer contained at least three active CFTR channels (A), which remain stable over a period of 12 min. Panel B illustrates channel activity following addition of the phosphorylated RDP. No inhibition was seen over a period of 12 min. Subsequent addition of PKI and unphosphorylated RDP resulted in progressive inhibition of CFTR channel activity. The traces shown in C were taken 12 min after addition of PKI and unphosphorylated RDP. The residual channel activity remaining could be completely blocked by adding 3 mM diphenylcarboxylate to the trans solution (data not shown). Base line (zero current, closed channels) is shown by a dashed line. This experiment is representative of three others.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The results indicate that phosphorylation plays a key role in mediating the binding of RDP to the CFTR molecule; only the unphosphorylated form of RDP is capable of blocking the CFTR channel. The large intracellular R domain is a special feature of the CFTR molecule, alone among members of the ABC family. In the presence of adequate concentrations of intracellular ATP, phosphorylation of any one of four main phosphorylation sites (18.Cheng S.H. Rich D.P. Marshall J. Gregory R.J. Welsh M.J. Smith A.E. Cell. 1991; 66: 1027-1036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 19.Picciotto M.R. Cohn A.J. Bertuzzi G. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12742-12752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is sufficient for full opening of the channel, and indeed, small increases in channel open probability can be detected in response to PKA phosphorylation even in native CFTR molecules with all consensus phosphorylation sites converted to alanines(20.Chang X.-B. Tabcharani J.A. Hou Y.X. Jensen T.J. Kartner N. Alon N. Hanrahan J.W. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11304-11311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, CFTRΔR-S660A, a molecule with amino acids 708-835 deleted (to render it constitutively open) with the remaining consensus PKA site mutated, is insensitive to activation by PKA(9.Rich D.P. Berger H.A. Cheng S.H. Travis S.M. Saxena M. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20259-20267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that activation by phosphorylation takes place in the R domain. Our results show that the exogenous RDP interacts specifically on the intracellular side of the CFTR channel. Inhibition of channel activity is abolished by phosphorylation of RDP. This inhibitory activity is specific for the R domain, since an anonymous protein of comparable molecular weight translated under the same conditions fails to block the channel, and inhibition appears to be specific for CFTR, since the small linear chloride channel is not blocked, nor is a large cation channel identified in the T84 vesicle preparations. The inhibition depends on the phosphorylation state of the R domain protein, however. Prephosphorylated R domain protein fails to block the channel, and when R domain protein is added under conditions where phosphorylation has been inhibited, the channel is closed indefinitely. However, when unphosphorylated R domain protein is added to the bilayer system in the presence of PKA and ATP, there is an initial block, followed by slow reversal as (presumably) the R domain protein undergoes phosphorylation during the course of the experiment. A second round of block and reversal can be demonstrated by adding fresh, unphosphorylated R domain protein. These experiments demonstrate that block by the R domain protein is not due to destruction of the CFTR channel, since the channel recovers with time (and phosphorylation of the R domain protein), and recovery of the channel is not accompanied by insensitivity to R domain block, since addition of fresh R domain protein restores the block. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the R domain protein binds reversibly to the CFTR channel in its open state, probably in the region of the pore. In the conditions in which PKA and ATP are still available on the intracellular side of the CFTR molecule, unbound R domain protein is gradually phosphorylated. As the R domain protein disengages from CFTR, there is, over time, less and less R domain protein remaining unphosphorylated to interact with CFTR. Eventually, the concentration of unphosphorylated R domain protein falls below that required to bind to and block the channel. When the R domain protein is prephosphorylated, there is no interaction. When the R domain protein is protected from phosphorylation by inclusion of PKI on the intracellular side of CFTR, there is always sufficient unphosphorylated R domain protein to interact with the channel. Since phosphorylation at even a single site in CFTR in the native molecule is sufficient to open the CFTR channel(9.Rich D.P. Berger H.A. Cheng S.H. Travis S.M. Saxena M. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 12742-12752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we speculate that binding of the R domain to the pore requires an unphosphorylated R domain protein molecule. An alternative hypothesis is that the exogenous R domain binds to a site in the closed state of the CFTR molecule, exerting steric hindrance to channel opening. In this case, one would expect that the phosphorylated R domain protein would be a better blocker than the unphosphorylated protein, because in the native molecule, stabilization of the open state must occur when the R domain is phosphorylated. Therefore, our data are less consistent with this hypothesis. The reconstitution system presented here demonstrates specific interaction between the R domain and CFTR, which has functional consequences, and should be useful for further investigation of the specific amino acid residues involved in the binding sites on both RDP and CFTR itself."

However, the specific physiological roles of different isoforms are poorly understood because hepatocytes express multiple C/EBPs, and various isoforms have overlapping functions. To identify the functions of C/EBPα in mature hepatocytes, replication-defective adenovirus vectors were used to efficiently and homogeneously overexpress the mouse C/EBPα gene in a SV40 virus-conditionally transformed rat hepatocyte line that can be induced to express C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ but that has little endogenous C/EBPα expression. Hepatocytes were infected with a recombinant adenovirus vector carrying the cDNA for C/EBPα driven by Rous sarcoma virus promoter elements (AdCEBPα) or a similar vector carrying the Escherichia coli lacZ gene (Adβgal). Staining for β-galactosidase demonstrated an infection efficiency of 100% at a multiplicity of infection of 25 plaque-forming units/cell and persistence of foreign gene expression for at least 9 days. Cultures infected with AdCEBPα had 50-fold higher levels of C/EBPα mRNA and protein than those infected with Adβgal, but similar expression of C/EBPβ. Infection with AdCEBPα inhibited proliferation in cells expressing little C/EBPβ, even when proliferation was driven by the SV40 transforming antigen, and also blunted mitogenic induction of the c-myc proto-oncogene in nontransformed cells with high levels of C/EBPβ. Although overexpression of C/EBPα consistently increased C/EBPα DNA binding activity, it was not sufficient for albumin expression. Infection with AdCEBPα only increased albumin mRNA levels in nontransformed cells that also expressed relatively high levels of C/EBPβ. Thus, in hepatocytes, C/EBPα has a dominant antiproliferative function, but must interact with other factors to regulate hepatocyte-specific gene expression.

CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs) ( 1The abbreviations used are: C/EBPsCCAAT/enhancer-binding proteinsm.o.i.multiplicity of infection.) are members of the basic leucine zipper superfamily of transcription factors. To date, five distinct genes that encode different C/EBP isoforms have been identified(1.Johnson P.F. Landschulz W.H. Graves B.J. McKnight S.L.

For example, C/EBPα is expressed predominately in tissues that regulate metabolic homeostasis (e.g. liver, fat, and intestine), while C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ are more ubiquitous(10.Birkenmeier E.H.

Work in several cell lines indicates that, although they bind to similar regulatory elements, unique C/EBP isoforms differ in their ability to activate various tissue-specific promoters. In cells that express more than one C/EBP isoform, different C/EBPs interact to regulate gene expression by forming homo- and heterodimers(14.Williams S.C. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1553-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 15.Umek R.M. Friedman A.D. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 251: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Since the regulatory regions of many tissue-specific genes contain C/EBP-binding sites, such cells are able to variably titrate the transcriptional rates of a wide array of genes by modifying the relative activities of different C/EBP isoforms(5.Cao Z.

Mature hepatocytes express at least three C/EBP isoforms (α, β, and δ) that interact to regulate their phenotype(12.Alam T. An M.R. Papaconstantinou J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5021-5024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, since these different C/EBP isoforms have overlapping functions(14.Williams S.C. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1553-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), the specific physiological role of each isoform in these cells is not well understood. Attempts to modulate the relative levels of these isoforms in vitro and to examine the resulting phenotype have been thwarted, in part, because the transfection efficiency of both primary adult and neoplastic hepatocytes is relatively poor, in the range of 20-30%(18.Pasco D.S. Fagan J.B. DNA (N. Y.). 1989; 8: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 19.Rippe R.A. Brenner D.A. Leffert H.L. Mol. Cell.

Furthermore, basal expression of C/EBPα is low in these cell lines(21.Mischoulon D. Rana B. Bucher N.L. Farmer S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2553-2560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), unlike in mature hepatocytes, where C/EBPα is strongly and constitutively expressed(10.Birkenmeier E.H. Gwynn B. Howard S. Jerry J. Gordon J.I. Landschulz W.H. McKnight S.L. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 1146-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 11.Kuo C.F. Xanthopoulos K.G. Darnell Jr., J.E. Development (Camb.). 1990; 109: 473-481PubMed Google Scholar). To overcome these experimental difficulties and to clarify the role of C/EBPα in mature hepatocytes, replication-defective adenovirus vectors were used to efficiently overexpress the mouse C/EBPα gene in a conditionally transformed rat hepatocyte line that can be induced to express C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ but that has little endogenous C/EBPα expression. In vitro adenoviral gene transfer has a significant advantage over traditional transient transfection strategies in that up to 100% of the targeted cells can be infected(22.Wilkinson G.W. Akrigg A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2233-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The subsequent analysis reflects changes in a homogeneous population of cells and indicates that C/EBPα has a dominant antiproliferative function in hepatocytes, but must interact with other factors to regulate the expression of hepatocyte-specific genes. The coding sequence for the mouse adipose C/EBPα gene was provided by M. D. Lane (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore)(23.Christy R.J. Yang V.W. Ntambi J.M. Geiman D.E. Landschulz W.H. Friedman A.D. Nakabeppu Y. Kelly T.J. Lane M.D. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 1323-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). A 2200-base pair BamHI-HindIII fragment containing the entire coding sequence for the C/EBPα gene was excised from pBluescript (24.Christy R.J. Kaestner K.H. Geiman D.E. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2593-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) and subcloned into the vector pE1RSV(25.Johns D.C. Nuss H.B. Chiamnovimonvat N. Ramza B. Marban E. Lawrence J.H. J. Clin.

Graham, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada) that incorporated the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat promoter, a multiple cloning site, and the polyadenylation signal from bovine growth hormone between adenovirus E1 recombination sequences. This plasmid, denoted pCEBPα, was cotransfected with pJM17 (26.Bett A.J. Prevec L. Graham F.L. J Virol. 1993; 67: 5911-5921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), containing the full human adenovirus serotype 5 genome, into HEK293 cells using Lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.).

We confirmed successful insertion of the C/EBPα gene cassette by restriction enzyme digestion and by Northern and Western blot analyses as described below. The Adβgal virus containing the Escherichia coli lacZ gene with the human cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter was provided by G. Wilkinson (Department of Medicine, University of Wales College of Medicine, Cardiff, CF4 4XX, United Kingdom). For large-scale preparations, 9-18 T-150 flasks of HEK293 cells were infected with AdCEBPα or Adβgal at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 1-5 plaque-forming units/cell. For detection of β-galactosidase activity, cells were fixed with 0.05% glutaraldehyde for 5 min at room temperature and stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-D-galactoside solution. The cells were lysed by freeze-thawing, and the supernatant was purified on a CsCl step cushion and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline as described previously(25.Johns D.C. Nuss H.B. Chiamnovimonvat N. Ramza B. Marban E. Lawrence J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1152-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A hepatocyte line (RALA255-10G) derived from adult rat hepatocytes that were conditionally transformed with mutant SV40 virus containing a temperature-sensitive T antigen was obtained from Dr. Janice Chou (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). At 33°C (permissive temperature), T antigen is expressed, and these cells actively proliferate, but do not express several hepatocyte-specific genes, including albumin. At 37-39°C (restrictive temperature), T antigen is degraded in RALA255 cells, so they are no longer transformed, and their proliferative activity decreases. This is accompanied by increased transcription of albumin and several other hepatocyte-specific genes(28.Chou J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 1013-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For experiments performed at 33°C, cultures were grown on plastic dishes to 30-40% confluence and then exposed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 2% fetal calf serum containing varying concentrations (10-100 m.o.i.) of AdCEBPα or Adβgal for 2 h. After replacing this medium with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4% fetal calf serum and 0.2 μM dexamethasone, cells were cultured for an additional 1-3 days. To measure treatment-related differences in proliferative activity, 5 μCi of [3H]thymidine was added to cultures 2 h before harvesting, and the tritium-specific activity of DNA was determined. For experiments performed at the restrictive temperature, cultures were grown on plastic dishes coated with type I collagen at 33°C until 70-80% confluent and then treated with AdCEBPα or Adβgal (10-100 m.o.i.) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% fetal calf serum for 2 h at 37°C. This medium was replaced with serum-free Chee medium with 1% dimethyl sulfoxide, ITS (insulin (5 μg/ml), transferrin (5 μg/ml), selenium (5 ng/ml)), and 1 μM dexamethasone, and cells were cultured at 39°C for an additional 3 days. Culture under the latter conditions leads to significantly decreased proliferative activity of uninfected RALA255 cells by day 3. In some experiments, Chee medium was replaced with growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing ITS, 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, Ham's F-12 nutrient mixture (Sigma), 1 mM pyruvic acid, 260 μML-proline, and 24.5 mM Hepes) at the beginning of day 3. Total RNA was isolated from cultures according to the protocol of Chomczynski and Sacchi(29.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Samples (20 μg of RNA/lane) were loaded onto denaturing agarose gels, separated by electrophoresis, and transferred to nylon membranes as described previously(30.Diehl A.M. Yang S.Q. Hepatology. 1994; 19: 447-456PubMed Google Scholar). After rinsing membranes with methylene blue dye to ensure equivalency of RNA loading and transfer, membranes were hybridized at 42°C overnight with +P-labeled cDNAs for C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, albumin, c-myc, or 18 S RNA. cDNAs for C/EBPα and C/EBPβ were donated by M. D. Lane(23.Christy R.J. Yang V.W. Ntambi J.M. Geiman D.E. Landschulz W.H. Friedman A.D. Nakabeppu Y. Kelly T.J. Lane M.D. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 1323-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). The albumin cDNA was provided by D. A. Shafritz (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York)(31.Shalaby F. Shafritz D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2652-2656Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and Dr. Chi Dang (Johns Hopkins University) provided the c-myc cDNA(32.Lee L.A. Resar L.M. Dang C.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 900-904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The probe for 18 S RNA was obtained from Oncogene Science Inc. (Manhasset, NY). Blots were washed under moderately stringent conditions (30.Diehl A.M. Yang S.Q. Hepatology. 1994; 19: 447-456PubMed Google Scholar) and then exposed to film. Autoradiographs from triplicate experiments were analyzed by scanning laser densitometry. To quantify treatment-related differences in mRNA expression, results on each radiograph were normalized to 18 S RNA expression at the same time point, and differences in normalized mRNA levels were evaluated by analysis of variance. Whole cell protein was extracted by boiling cell pellets in 60 mM Tris and 1% SDS for 8 min. Nuclear proteins were extracted from parallel cultures according to the method of Ossipow et al.(33.Ossipow V. Descombes P. Schibler U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8219-8223Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) as described previously(34.Diehl A.M. Yang S.Q. Yin M. Lin H.Z. Nelson S. Bagby G. Hepatology. 1995; 22: 252-261PubMed Google Scholar). The protein concentrations in whole cell and nuclear extracts were determined(34.Diehl A.M. Yang S.Q. Yin M. Lin H.Z. Nelson S. Bagby G. Hepatology. 1995; 22: 252-261PubMed Google Scholar). Samples (200 μg of whole cell protein/lane or 40 μg of nuclear protein/lane) in Laemmli sample buffer were loaded onto SDS-12.5% polyacrylamide gels, separated by electrophoresis, and transferred to nylon membranes(34.Diehl A.M. Yang S.Q. Yin M. Lin H.Z. Nelson S. Bagby G. Hepatology. 1995; 22: 252-261PubMed Google Scholar). After staining the gel and membrane with Coomassie Blue dye to ensure equivalency of protein loading and transfer, immunoblot analysis was performed(34.Diehl A.M. Yang S.Q. Yin M. Lin H.Z. Nelson S. Bagby G. Hepatology. 1995; 22: 252-261PubMed Google Scholar). Blots were incubated with primary antiserum (1:1000 dilution) for C/EBPα or C/EBPβ (gifts from M. D. Lane)(35.MacDougald O.A. Cornelius P. Lin F.T. Chen S.S. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19041-19047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and immunoreactive bands were demonstrated by the chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Corp.). Results of blots from triplicate experiments were analyzed by densitometry (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Densitometric data were evaluated by analysis of variance. Nuclear protein samples (8 μg of protein each) in storage buffer (20 mmol/liter Hepes (pH 7.4), 5 mmol/liter dithiothreitol, 1 mmol/liter MgCl2, 60 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 40 μg/ml bestatin, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μmol/liter sodium vanadate, 20 mmol/liter β-glycerophosphate, and 10 mmol/liter p-nitrophenyl phosphate), the [γ-32P]ATP-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide fragment containing the C/EBP-binding site in the albumin enhancer (5′-ATCATGATTTTGTAATGGGGTAG-3′), and poly(dI•dC) (1.5 μg/ml) were incubated with or without antisera (1 μl of each antiserum/reaction) to various C/EBP isoforms at room temperature for 20 min. Reaction mixtures were suspended in 20% glycerol with 0.1% bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol FF, loaded onto 6% acrylamide gels, and separated by electrophoresis in 0.5 × Tris borate/EDTA buffer at 200 V for 2 h (34.Diehl A.M. Yang S.Q. Yin M. Lin H.Z. Nelson S. Bagby G. Hepatology. 1995; 22: 252-261PubMed Google Scholar). Complexes were detected by exposing the dried gels to film. As expected, uninfected RALA255 cells under the influence of T antigen do not express detectable levels of albumin mRNA at 33°C, but gradually accumulate albumin message during culture at 39°C (Fig. 1). Although others have reported that these condition-dependent differences in albumin expression are transcriptionally regulated and reflect differences in the protection of several DNase-sensitive sites in regulatory elements of the albumin gene(36.Zaret K.S. DiPersio C.M. Jackson D.A. Montigny W.J. Weinstat D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9076-9080Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 37.Liu J.K. Bergman Y. Zaret K.S. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 528-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), differences in albumin mRNA expression are not associated with comparable differences in C/EBP mRNA expression (Fig. 1). Very little C/EBPα mRNA is detected during culture at either 33 or 39°C. Similarly, stable low levels of C/EBPδ mRNA are detected only after prolonged exposure (21 days) of blots to film. C/EBPβ message is more readily detected at both temperatures, but mRNA levels increase <2-fold when cultures are shifted from 33 to 39°C. In contrast to the relatively temperature-insensitive message levels, immunoblot analysis reveals that levels of certain C/EBP isoforms increase at 39°C (Fig. 2). Although C/EBPα expression varies <2-fold, the nuclear concentrations of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ increase 5-10-fold when cultures are shifted to the higher temperature (p < 0.05 for expression at 33°C versus expression during days 1-9 at 39°C). These increases in C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ expression are paralleled by increases in DNA binding activity of these isoforms in gel mobility shift experiments with an oligonucleotide probe that contains the C/EBP-binding site in the albumin gene (Fig. 3)(36.Zaret K.S.

Complex formation with this oligonucleotide is completely eliminated when a mixture of antibodies to C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPδ is added to the reaction mixture, but is unaltered by preimmune sera (see Fig. 7, lanes 9 and 10), confirming previous reports (36.Zaret K.S.

Antisera specific for different C/EBP isoforms were added to some reaction mixtures (lanes 2-4 and 6-8) to determine which isoforms were binding to C/EBP sites under the different culture conditions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 7:Effect of adenovirus-mediated gene transfer on C/EBP binding activity of RALA255 cells. Gel mobility and supershift assays were performed using the 23-base pair oligonucleotide described in the legend to Fig. 3 plus nuclear extracts (8 μg of protein/lane) from cultures infected with either AdCEBPα or Adβgal. Lanes 1-8 illustrate results in extracts harvested 3 days after infection at 33°C. Lanes 9 and 10 show results obtained when identical assays were performed with extracts harvested from Adβgal-infected cultures maintained at 39°C for 3 days. These are included as a control to demonstrate that addition of a mixture of C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPδ antisera (total volume of 3 μl) virtually eliminates complex formation with the same probe (lane 10) but that addition of an equal volume of preimmune serum (IgG) has little effect.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Total C/EBP binding activity is increased in nuclear extracts prepared from 39°C cultures compared with extracts from 33°C cultures. In experiments with extracts obtained from 39°C cultures, addition of anti-C/EBPα antibodies has little effect on complex formation; anti-C/EBPδ antibodies result in a small supershifted band, and anti-C/EBPβ antibodies disrupt most of the protein-probe complexes. Thus, almost all of the increased binding activity at 39°C is secondary to C/EBPβ. Because C/EBPβ accounts for most of the C/EBP binding activity in these cells at both 33 and 39°C, subsequent experiments focused on identifying effects of C/EBPα gene transfer on the expression and function of the C/EBPβ isoform. Infection of RALA255 cultures with Adβgal (m.o.i. = 25) results in expression of the heterologous gene in virtually 100% of the cells within 1 day (Fig. 4). Following exposure to AdCEBPα (m.o.i. = 25), steady-state levels of C/EBPα mRNA are >50-fold higher than in cells treated with Adβgal. Increased expression of C/EBPα mRNA occurs both during culture at 33°C, when T antigen is actively expressed, and after 2 days of culture at 39°C, when T antigen has been completely degraded. In contrast, C/EBPβ mRNA levels are similar in the two groups at both temperatures (Fig. 5). Infection with AdCEBPα increases albumin mRNA levels at 39°C (p < 0.01 versus Adβgal control on the third day of culture at 39°C), but not in cultures maintained at 33°C. However, as shown in a representative immunoblot (Fig. 6), the concentration of C/EBPα protein is increased in AdCEBPα-infected cultures maintained at either 33 or 39°C compared with parallel cultures treated with Adβgal. Triplicate experiments demonstrate that both whole cell and nuclear concentrations of C/EBPα protein are greater in AdCEBPα-infected cultures than in Adβgal-infected cultures at every time point evaluated (i.e. during the first 3 days of culture at 33°C and on the third day of culture at 39°C). Evidence that the treatment-related differences in C/EBPα expression (illustrated in Fig. 6) are not merely artifacts produced by lane-lane differences in the amount of protein on the blot is provided in Fig. 6(lower panel). When this representative blot was reprobed to search for treatment-related differences in C/EBPβ expression, the results demonstrated that C/EBPβ protein concentrations are similar in Adβgal- and AdCEBPα-infected cultures. Thus, the results of Northern and Western blot analyses are consistent with each other and demonstrate that adenovirus-mediated transfer of C/EBPα results in overexpression of this C/EBP isoform, but does not alter the expression of C/EBPβ, a closely related transcription factor.Figure 5:Effect of adenovirus-mediated gene transfer on RALA255 cell expression of several hepatocyte mRNAs. 30-40% confluent cultures of RALA255 were infected with either AdCEBPα or Adβgal (m.o.i. = 25) for 2 h at 33°C and then maintained at this temperature for an additional 1-3 days (D1-D3). In parallel experiments, 70-80% confluent cultures of RALA255 cells were infected with the same vectors for 2 h at 37°C and then shifted to 39°C and maintained at this temperature for 3 days. By day 3 at 39°C, T antigen had been degraded, and albumin mRNA levels were increased in uninfected cultures (see Fig. 1). A, total RNA was harvested from cultures at various time points, and treatment-related differences in mRNA levels of C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and albumin were evaluated by Northern blot analysis (20 μg of RNA/lane). The autoradiographs shown were obtained by repeated hybridization of a single blot. The bottom panel illustrates the same blot after staining with methylene blue. This, coupled with normalization of results to 18 S RNA expression at the same time points (data not shown), confirms that differences in C/EBPα and albumin expression are not due to uneven RNA loading or transfer. The results shown are representative of triplicate experiments. B, densitometric analysis of these results and those from two other blots confirms that infection with AdCEBPα increases C/EBPα mRNA levels 50-80-fold and albumin mRNA levels 4.5-7-fold (p < 0.01 for AdCEBPα at days 1-3 at 33°C and day 3 at 39°C versus Adβgal at the same time points). ▀, Adβgal; ⁄⁄, AdCEBPα.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6:Effect of adenovirus-mediated gene transfer on RALA255 cell expression of C/EBPα and C/EBPβ proteins.

The complex is composed of a pre-existing cytoplasmic component, which translocates to the nucleus, and an inducible nuclear component composed of members of the AP1 family(4.Flanagan W.M.

Bluestone J.A. Nadler L.M. Thompson C.B. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 321-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). One of the major effects of CD28 stimulation is increased production of cytokines, such as IL-2, interferon γ, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor, and others, through transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms(10.Thompson C.B. Lindsten T. Ledbetter J.A. Kunkel S.L. Young H.A. Emerson S.G. Leiden J.M. June C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1333-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 11.Lindsten T.

We reasoned that if CD28 costimulation results in IL-2 production, and if NFAT is required for the expression of IL-2, there must be a CsA-resistant pathway for activation of NFAT. In this report, we demonstrate that NFAT can be activated in a CsA-resistant manner.MATERIALS AND METHODSCells and Tissue CultureFreshly purified human peripheral blood T cells were greater than 95% CD33+ cells. PMA was used at 10 ng/ml, ionomycin at 1 μg/ml, and αCD28 monoclonal antibody (kindly provided by Dr. Carl H. 6) at 100 ng/ml. Cyclosporin A (500 ng/ml) was added 30 min before addition of the other stimuli.PlasmidsThe thymidine kinase-β-galactosidase (TK-βgal) reporter plasmid was constructed by subcloning a HindIII/XhoI fragment containing the TK promoter from the pBLCAT2 vector (14.Luckow B. Schütz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar) into the pEQ3 LacZ plasmid (15.Penix L. Weaver W.M. Pang Y. Young H.A. Wilson C.B. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1483-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The NFAT-TK-βgal plasmid was constructed by synthesizing three copies of the IL-2 distal NFAT site (AAAGAAAGGAGGAAAAACTGTTTCATACAG)3 containing HindIII (at the 5′ end) and BamHI (at the 3′ end) restriction sites, and subcloning into the TK-βgal plasmid. The NFκB-TK-βgal reporter plasmid was constructed as above, using the IgκB sequence (ACAAGGGACTTTCCGCT). The expression vectors for NFATc and for dominant negative NFATc(16.Northrop J.P. Ho S. Chen L. Thomas D.J. Timmerman L.A. Nolan G.P. Admon A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar) were generous gifts from Dr. Gerald R. Crabtree. The pIL2-568 (15.Penix L. Weaver W.M. Pang Y. Young H.A. Wilson C.B. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1483-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) construct (kindly provided by Dr. Christopher B. Wilson) was generated by subcloning the HindIII fragment (−568 to +50) of the IL-2 promoter into the pEQ3 LacZ plasmid.Transfection and β-Galactosidase AssayCells were transfected by a modified DEAE-dextran method(17.Durand D.B. Bush M.R. Morgan J.G. Weiss A. Crabtree G.R. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 395-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In brief, Jurkat cells were washed once with RPMI containing 50 mM Tris (pH 7.4). Cells were resuspended in the same medium at a density of 8 × 106/ml. An aliquot of a 0.5-ml cell suspension containing appropriate plasmids was added to 0.5 ml of Tris-RPMI containing 500 μg/ml DEAE-dextran. The aliquot was incubated for 1 h with occasional stirring, then centrifuged, washed once with Tris-RPMI, and resuspended in 5 ml of RPMI (10% fetal calf serum) and plated in a six-well plate. The cells were stimulated after 24 h and harvested for β-galactosidase assay 18 h after stimulation. When multiple stimulations for a particular plasmid(s) were used, transfection was done in a single tube. After transfection, cells were divided into groups depending on the various stimulations. β-Galactosidase was assayed as reported(18.Eustice D.C. Feldman P.A. Colberg-Poley A.M. Buckery R.M. Neubauer R.H. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 739-743PubMed Google Scholar). The results were expressed as activity, calculated as follows: (A570/μg of protein) × 103.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)The preparation of nuclear extracts and EMSA were performed as described previously (19.Ghosh P. Sica A. Young H.A. Ye J. Franco J.L. Wiltrout R.H. Longo D.L. Rie N.R. Komschlies K.L. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2969-2972PubMed Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used were: IL-2 distal NFAT site (5′-AAAGAAAGGAGGAAAAACTGTTTCATACAG-3′), AP1 site from human collagenase gene (5′-agctATGAGTCAGACACCTCTGGCTTTCTGGAAGG-3′), SP1 site from HIV-1 long terminal repeat (5′-GATCGGGAGGCGT GGCCTGGGCGGGACTGGGGAGTGGCGA-3′).AntiseraAntiserum αNFAT was raised against a peptide that is highly conserved in all NFAT proteins described to date. The peptide is found in the Rel homology domain, and its sequence is NH2-SDIELRKGETDIGRKNTR. Antiserum αNFATp was raised against a peptide specific to NFATp. Its sequence is VPAIKTEPSDEYEPSLI (sequence in murine NFATp, but the antiserum also recognizes the human protein).Cytokine TestingHuman IL-2 was measured by ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) test kits from Genzyme Corp. (Cambridge, MA). The assays were performed by the Clinical Immunology Services Program, SAIC, NCI-FCRDC, Frederick, MD.RESULTSInduction of NFAT Activity in a CsA-resistant PathwayTo investigate whether NFAT can be activated by CD28 costimulation, three copies of the distal NFAT site from the IL-2 promoter were subcloned into a TK-βgal reporter gene construct, designated as NFAT-TK-βgal. This construct was transfected into Jurkat T cells, and NFAT activity was assayed after various treatments of the cells. Since we were looking for a CsA-resistant pathway, we could not use αCD3 as a stimulus, because one of the pathways it activates is Ca2+-dependent. Therefore, we chose to mimic the Ca2+-independent aspect of αCD3 signaling by PMA, as described previously(20.Truneh A. Albert F. Golstein P. Schmitt-Verhulst A.-M. Nature. 1985; 313: 318-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). PMA alone had little effect on reporter activity (Fig. 1A) and αCD28 alone had no effect (data not shown), but the combination of PMA and αCD28 resulted in significant activity (about 4-fold induction relative to the vector alone). Strikingly, nearly all of this (PMA + αCD28)-induced activity was resistant to CsA. In contrast, NFAT activity induced by PMA + ionomycin was essentially completely CsA-sensitive (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that, in addition to the well-known Ca2+-dependent pathway, there is a second Ca2+-independent way to activate NFAT.In the experiment described above, it was possible that the assay measured some other unknown factor able to bind to the NFAT sites in the reporter plasmid rather than bona fide NFAT activity. To test this, the assays were repeated in the presence of cotransfected NFATc. Consistent with the results of others(16.Northrop J.P. Ho S. Chen L. Thomas D.J. Timmerman L.A. Nolan G.P. Admon A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 21.Hoey T. Sun Y.-L. Williamson K. Xu X. Immunity. 1995; 2: 461-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), NFATc had little effect on the multicopy NFAT reporter in untreated cells (Fig. 1C), but had a marked effect in cells stimulated with PMA and αCD28 (15-fold induction of NFAT activity relative to the vector alone). As before, this induction was insensitive to CsA. In the same assay, promoter activity induced by PMA + ionomycin was abolished in the presence of CsA (data not shown). These results indicate that overexpressed NFATc protein can be activated through a CsA-resistant pathway.In order to determine whether the IL-2 promoter can also be activated by a CsA-resistant pathway, the 568-base pair IL-2 promoter-β-galactosidase reporter construct (designated as pIL2-568) was tested in the transient transfection assay (Fig. 2). Like the multicopy NFAT-TK-βgal construct, pIL2-568 showed much higher promoter activity after PMA/αCD28 stimulation compared to either the unstimulated control or to PMA alone (panel A). This activity was further increased in the presence of overexpressed NFATc protein (panel B). The vector alone did not have any activity (data not shown). The inducible promoter activity was completely resistant to CsA (panels A and B), whereas CsA suppressed PMA/ionomycin-inducible promoter activity (panel C). To test whether the promoter activity induced by PMA + αCD28 was mediated by NFAT, a dominant-negative NFATc protein (16.Northrop J.P. Ho S. Chen L. Thomas D.J. Timmerman L.A. Nolan G.P. Admon A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar) was tested in transient transfection assay. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, overexpression of the dominant negative resulted in 70-80% inhibition of PMA/CD28-inducible promoter activity, but, as expected, the dominant negative NFATc protein had very little effect on an NFκB-TK-βgal reporter construct (panel D). These data demonstrate that the IL-2 promoter can be activated by PMA/αCD28 in a CsA-resistant manner, and that this activation is mediated by NFAT.Figure 2:Activation of an IL-2 promoter-β-galactosidase reporter gene construct in the presence of CsA. A, the pIL2-568 reporter gene (5 μg) along with expression vector alone or in combination with the expression vector for a dominant negative form of NFATc (5 μg) was transiently transfected into Jurkat cells and was subsequently stimulated as described above. B, the pIL2-568 reporter gene along with the NFATc expression vector (5 μg each) in the presence or absence of the dominant negative NFATc (5 μg) was transfected into Jurkat cells that were subsequently stimulated as described in Fig. 1. The amount of transfected plasmids was normalized by adding the empty vector, pBJ5. C, similar experiment as B except the stimulation was with PMA and ionomycin. D, the NFκB-TK-βgal reporter gene was transfected into Jurkat cells along with the expression vector for the dominant negative NFATc (5 μg each). Cells were subsequently stimulated as described in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Induction of an NFAT Complex by PMA and αCD28 in the Presence of CsAInduction of NFAT activity implies induction of the DNA-binding NFAT complex in the nuclei of stimulated cells. To look for this complex, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed using the IL-2-distal NFAT site as a probe. As shown in Fig. 3A, nuclear extract of Jurkat T cells stimulated with PMA and αCD28 showed an inducible complex (compare lane 1 with 2) which comigrated with the PMA/ionomycin-inducible complex (lane 4). The PMA/αCD28-inducible complex was resistant to CsA (lane 3), whereas the PMA/ionomycin-induced complex was sensitive to CsA (lane 5). The PMA/αCD28-inducible complex was specific to the probe as demonstrated by the competition assay with specific (lane 6) and nonspecific (lane 8) competitors. The complex was completely blocked in the presence of a consensus AP1 site (lane 7) indicating the involvement of AP1 in the inducible complex. To confirm that the inducible complex contained NFAT protein, we performed supershift analysis. As shown in Fig. 3B, antiserum raised against a peptide that is common to all NFAT proteins was able to block the inducible complex (lane 2). Another antiserum raised against an NFATp-specific epitope showed a partial supershift (lane 4), whereas an irrelevant antiserum failed to react with the complex (lane 3). As shown in Fig. 3C, a PMA/αCD28-inducible complex was also present in the nuclear extracts of peripheral blood T cells (compare lane 2 with 1). As in Jurkat cells, this inducible complex was insensitive to CsA, whereas the PMA/ionomycin-inducible complex was sensitive to CsA (compare lanes 10 and 11). Competition assays and supershift analysis revealed that the PMA/αCD28 complex contained NFAT protein as well as the members of the AP1 family. These data show that in Jurkat cells and in peripheral blood T cells the NFAT DNA-binding complex can be induced in a CsA-resistant manner by PMA/αCD28 stimulation.Figure 3:EMSA demonstrating the presence of inducible NFAT complex.

We expected this to be true under our conditions as well, since reporter assays showed activation of the IL-2 promoter and EMSA showed induction of the NFAT complex. To test for IL-2 production, peripheral blood T cells were stimulated with PMA and αCD28 for 18 h with or without CsA. As shown in Fig. 4, stimulation in the absence of CsA resulted in the production of over 200 units/ml of IL-2; in the presence of CsA, IL-2 was produced at 70-85% of this level (the slight drop may be due to toxic effects from the high concentration of drug used (500 ng/ml)). In contrast, CsA drastically reduced IL-2 production (to 7% of the level produced without CsA) in cells stimulated with PMA + ionomycin. In absolute terms as well, CsA-resistant IL-2 levels are substantially higher in PMA-CD28 stimulated cells (140 units/ml) than in PMA/ionomycin-treated cells (24 units/ml). These data demonstrate the physiological significance of CsA-resistant NFAT activation.Figure 4:Production of IL-2 by peripheral blood T cells. Peripheral blood T cells isolated from two different donors were stimulated with medium alone, PMA/CD28, PMA/CD28/CsA, PMA/ionomycin, and PMA/ionomycin/CsA for 24 h. IL-2 secreted into the medium was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. CsA was added to the cells 30 min prior to stimulation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONPrevious studies have shown that the immunosuppressive drug CsA drastically inhibits, but does not completely block, IL-2 production following stimulation by αCD3 and αCD28(10.Thompson C.B. Lindsten T. Ledbetter J.A. Kunkel S.L. Young H.A. Emerson S.G. Leiden J.M. June C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1333-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). The drug-resistant activity can most likely be traced to the CD28 signaling pathway, since stimulation of cells with PMA (to mimic the Ca2+-independent aspects of αCD3 signaling) and αCD28 is entirely resistant to CsA(10.Thompson C.B. Lindsten T. Ledbetter J.A. Kunkel S.L. Young H.A. Emerson S.G. Leiden J.M. June C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1333-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). In this case, IL-2 is produced at significant levels in the continued presence of CsA or FK506. Since the transcription factor NFAT is required for expression of the IL-2 gene, these results imply that, in addition to the well-known Ca2+-dependent pathway, NFAT can be activated by a CsA-resistant pathway. Data presented here show that this is the case.The involvement of NFAT in the activation of reporter gene constructs (both NFAT-TK-βgal and pIL2-568) after PMA/αCD28 treatment in the presence of CsA was demonstrated by the facts that (i) overexpressed wild type NFAT augmented reporter activity only after PMA/αCD28 stimulation, and (ii) the inducible reporter activity was essentially eliminated in the presence of a dominant negative mutant of NFAT. The presence of NFAT in the PMA/αCD28-inducible DNA-protein complexes was also demonstrated by the supershift assays. In agreement with the transient transfection assays, the peripheral blood T cells were also shown to produce IL-2 after PMA/αCD28 treatment, and this production was resistant to CsA.The established pathway for NFAT activation involves Ca2+-dependent activation of the serine-threonine phosphatase calcineurin. Subsequent dephosphorylation of NFAT leads to its nuclear translocation and, in conjunction with AP-1, DNA binding. The data presented here suggest an alternate pathway for NFAT activation that is calcineurin independent. Since dephosphorylation of NFAT appears to be necessary for its activity, a different phosphatase must be involved in this pathway. A candidate second messenger (instead of Ca2+) is ceramide, which has been reported to be involved in CD28 signaling(22.Chan G. Ochi A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1999-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 23.Boucher L.-M. Wiegmann K. Fütterer K. Pfeffer K. Machleidt T. Schütze S. Mak T.W. Krönke M. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 2059-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a serine/threonine phosphatase has been reported recently that is involved in the sphingomyelin pathway(24.Wolff R.A. Dobrowsky R.T. Bielawska A. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19605-19609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is an attractive hypothesis that this or another ceramide-induced phosphatase can lead to NFAT activation in a CsA-resistant manner. This idea is currently being tested.The present finding may explain the ineffectiveness of CsA in the treatment of graft versus host disease following allogenic bone marrow transplantation(25.Storb R. Deeg H.J. Whitehead J. Farewell V. Appelbaum F.R. Beatty P.G. Besinger W. Buckner C.D. Clift R. Hansen J. Hill R. Longton G. Lum L. Martin P. McGuffin R. Sanders J. Singer J. Stewart P. Sullivan K.

Upon stimulation of T cells, an NFAT-containing protein complex appears in the nucleus and recognizes two or more sites in the IL-2 promoter(2.Shaw J.P. Utz P.J. Durand D.B. Toole J.J. Emmel E.A.

The complex is composed of a pre-existing cytoplasmic component, which translocates to the nucleus, and an inducible nuclear component composed of members of the AP1 family(4.Flanagan W.M.

Translocation of the cytoplasmic component involves Ca2+-induced activation of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin(5.McCaffrey P.G. Perrino B.A. Soderling T.R.

Bluestone J.A. Nadler L.M. Thompson C.B. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 321-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). One of the major effects of CD28 stimulation is increased production of cytokines, such as IL-2, interferon γ, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor, and others, through transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms(10.Thompson C.B. Lindsten T. Ledbetter J.A. Kunkel S.L. Young H.A. Emerson S.G. Leiden J.M. June C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1333-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 11.Lindsten T.

One of the hallmarks of the CD28 costimulation is its insensitivity to the immunosuppressive drugs CsA and FK506(10.Thompson C.B. Lindsten T. Ledbetter J.A. Kunkel S.L. Young H.A. Emerson S.G.

We reasoned that if CD28 costimulation results in IL-2 production, and if NFAT is required for the expression of IL-2, there must be a CsA-resistant pathway for activation of NFAT. In this report, we demonstrate that NFAT can be activated in a CsA-resistant manner."

Partial amino acid sequences of p33/41 are highly homologous to those of a calcium/phospholipid-binding annexin protein, annexin IV (endonexin). p33/41 exhibited similar calcium-dependent phospholipid binding activity (Kojima, K., Ogawa, H., Seno, N., Yamamoto, K., Irimura, T., Osawa, T., and Matsumoto, I. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 20536-20539). To further characterize p33/41, we cloned the p33/41 cDNA and characterized the recombinant protein encoded by this cDNA. Oligonucleotide probes were synthesized based on partial amino acid sequences of p33/41 and used for screening. A p33/41 cDNA clone was isolated encoding a protein of 319 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 35,769 Da. The deduced amino acid sequence was identical to that of bovine annexin IV except for one amino acid substitution. The recombinant protein gave two 33-kDa (p33) and 41-kDa (p41) bands on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under non-reducing conditions, and only one 33-kDa band under reducing conditions, as did the native protein. Mass spectrometric analysis combined with site-directed mutagenesis of each of the four cysteine residues of the recombinant protein revealed that p41 is a dimer of p33 cross-linked at Cys-198 via a disulfide bond. The recombinant protein bound to columns of heparin and fetuin glycopeptides in a calcium dependent manner and to phospholipid vesicles composed of phosphatidylserine (PS)/phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)/PC or phosphatidylinositol (PI)/PC. Furthermore, concurrent binding assays showed that the binding of the recombinant protein to phospholipid vesicles was not affected by heparin, whereas that to heparin was influenced by the phospholipid composition of the vesicles; the highest binding was observed with vesicles composed of PE/PC. These results suggest that p33/41 binds two types of ligands via different sites and that phospholipids modulate the carbohydrate binding activity of p33/41.

Pretreatment of CHOrH2 cells with cholera toxin or forskolin also led to H2 receptor down-regulation. Forskolin time-dependently (t1/2 ≈ 7 h) and dose-dependently (EC50 = 0.3 μM) induced H2 receptor down-regulation. Both histamine and forskolin induced rapid down-regulation of H2 receptor mRNA levels, probably caused by mRNA destabilization.Recently, Moro et al. (Moro, O., Lameh, J., Hogger, P., and Sadée, W.(1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 22273-22276) showed that hydrophobic amino acids in a conserved G-protein-coupled receptor motif in the second intracellular loop are implicated in G-protein coupling. To uncouple the H2 receptor from the Gs-protein, we introduced the Leu124→ Ala mutation in the second intracellular loop of the H2 receptor. The H2 Leu124→ Ala mutant showed altered agonist-binding parameters, attenuated histamine-induced cAMP production, and was down-regulated by concentrations of histamine that did not give rise to cAMP production. Taken together, in CHOrH2 cells, H2 receptor down-regulation appears to be induced by two distinct pathways, a cAMP-dependent and cAMP-independent pathway.

INTRODUCTIONThe introduction of molecular biology in the field of histamine receptor research has greatly improved the possibilities to study molecular aspects of histamine receptor proteins. In 1991, Gantz et al.(1.Gantz I. Schaffer M. DelValle J. Logdson G. Campbell V. Uhler M. Yamada T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 429-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) cloned the cDNA encoding the canine histamine H2 receptor, which was followed by the cloning of both the rat and human homologues(2.Ruat M. Traiffort E. Arrang J.M. Leurs R. Schwartz J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 1470-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 3.Gantz I. Munzert G. Tashiro T. Schaffer M. Wang L. DelValle J. Yamada T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 1386-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequence of the H2 receptor proteins reveals the existence of seven putative transmembrane domains, indicating that this receptor is a member of the large family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). ( 1The abbreviations used are: GPCRG-protein-coupled receptorCHOChinese hamster ovaryDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's medium[125I]APT[125I]iodoaminopotentidineIBMXisobutylmethylxanthineCTXcholera toxinPCRpolymerase chain reactionGTPγSguanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate).) This family of receptors is known to be readily subjected to regulatory processes in order to control receptor signaling and thus cellular communication(4.Lohse M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Short-term exposure of receptors to high concentrations of agonists is often followed by a decrease in cellular responsiveness, called desensitization(5.Hausdorff W.P. Campbell P.T. Ostrowoski J. Yu S.S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2979-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Long-term exposure, on the other hand, results in the reduction of receptor number (6.Collins S. Caron M. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 497-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and is referred to as receptor down-regulation. Since the histamine H2 receptor is a member of this family of GPCRs, it is not surprising that this receptor is also susceptible to such regulatory mechanisms.Recently, we have shown that in human U937 cells the endogenously expressed histamine H2 receptors are indeed rapidly desensitized when exposed to histamine(7.Smit M.J. Leurs R. Shukrula S.R. Bast A. Timmerman H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 288: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Similar observations have been reported in other cellular systems(8.Fukushima Y. Oka Y. Katagiri H. Saitoh T. Asano T. Ishihara H. Matsuhashi N. Kodama T. Yazaki Y. Sugano K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 190: 1149-1155Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 9.Arima N. Kinoshita Y. Nakamura A. Yamashita Y. Chiba T. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: G987-G992PubMed Google Scholar). Yet, so far, no detailed information is available on long-term desensitization of the histamine H2 receptor such as receptor down-regulation. Such processes may become apparent under several pathophysiological conditions (e.g. asthmatic attack or allergic reactions in general), during which histamine is released in large quantities, but might also occur under normal physiological conditions. Recently, Diaz et al.(10.Diaz J. Vizuete M.-L. Traiffort E. Arrang J.-M. Ruat M. Schwartz J.-C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 1195-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) suggested for example that in vivo receptor down-regulation might explain the inverse relationship between H2 receptor expression and the localization of histamine-synthesizing cells in the rodent gastric wall. The regulation of H2 receptor expression has gained further interest due to the potential therapeutic application of H2 receptor agonists in patients suffering from congestive heart failure(11.Felix S.B. Buschauer A. Baumann G. Timmerman H. Van der Goot H. New Perspectives in Histamine Research. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel1991: 257-271Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar).Investigation of the regulation of H2 receptor expression has so far been hampered by the availability of suitable model systems. Cellular systems (7.Smit M.J. Leurs R. Shukrula S.R. Bast A. Timmerman H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 288: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 8.Fukushima Y. Oka Y. Katagiri H. Saitoh T.

Agents Actions. 1987; 22: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) have been used to investigate second messenger responses coupled to the histamine H2 receptor stimulation, but the used systems such as U937 cells for example do not express a sufficiently high density of H2 receptors to permit radioligand binding studies, which are essential for the investigation of long-term regulatory mechanisms(7.Smit M.J. Leurs R. Shukrula S.R. Bast A. Timmerman H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 288: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Following the recent cloning of cDNAs or genes encoding histamine H2 receptors, cell lines expressing considerable amounts of histamine H2 receptors can be obtained(13.Traiffort E. Ruat M.

Additionally, the availability of the H2 receptor gene allows the construction of receptor mutants, which can provide mechanistic insights in phenomena like receptor down-regulation.In the present study we have examined the effects of long-term exposure of the rat histamine H2 receptor stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (referred to as CHOrH2 cells) (13.Traiffort E.

In order to get more insight into the mechanisms underlying H2 receptor regulation, we constructed a H2 receptor mutant, in which leucine 124 in the second intracellular loop was substituted by an alanine. This H2 Leu124→ Ala receptor mutant was partially uncoupled from its G-protein and proved to be a suitable tool for investigating the existence of possible cAMP-dependent and independent pathways in the process of agonist-induced H2 receptor down-regulation.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell CultureCHO cells expressing the rat histamine H2 receptor (CHOrH2) (13.Traiffort E.

Using 100 ng of pSVrH2(13.Traiffort E. Ruat M. Arrang J.M. Leurs R. Piomelli D. Schwartz J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2649-2653Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) as a template, 0.4 μM S1, 0.4 μM AS2, 40 μM dNTPs, and 2.5 units of Amplitaq according to the manufacturer's protocol (Perkin Elmer), a 392-base pair DNA fragment of the H2 Leu124→ Ala receptor mutant was amplified in 100 μl using 30 cycles at 94°C for 1 min, 56°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 1.5 min and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. The obtained PCR product was gel-purified and restricted with HindIII/KpnI (Boehringer). This fragment was cloned into the plasmid pSP73 (Promega) containing the wild-type rH2 receptor, which was restricted with KpnI and HindIII. Thereafter, the PCR-amplified sequence was verified using the dideoxy chain termination method with the Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Subsequently, the coding sequence of the mutated H2 Leu124→ Ala receptor was subcloned into the eukaryotic pSV expression vector. CHO cells, deficient in dihydrofolate reductase, were stably transfected with 15 μg of pSVrH2Leu124Ala using Transfectam (Promega).Membrane PreparationCHOrH2 and CHOrH2Leu124Ala cells were washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10.1 mM Na2HPO4, 1.8 mM KH2PO4) and harvested with a cell scraper and recovered by a 10-min centrifugation at 500 × g. Cells were homogenized in ice-cold 50 mM Na2/potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) with a Polytron homogenizer (5 s, maximal speed) and used for radioligand binding studies. Protein concentrations were determined according to Bradford using bovine serum albumin as a standard(15.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213462) Google Scholar).Histamine H2 Receptor BindingThe radiolabeled H2 receptor antagonist [125I]iodoaminopotentidine ([125I]APT) was synthesized as described previously(14.Leurs R. Smit M.J. Menge W.M.B.P. Timmerman H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 112: 847-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Triplicate assays were performed in polyethylene tubes in 50 mM Na2/potassium phosphate buffer containing gelatin (0.1%) to prevent adsorption of the radioligand. In saturation studies, increasing concentrations of [125I]APT were incubated with 5-10 μg of membrane proteins in the absence or presence of 1 μM tiotidine in a total volume of 400 μl. After 90 min at 30°C, the incubations were stopped by rapid dilution with 3 ml of ice-cold 20 mM Na2/potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The bound radioactivity was subsequently separated by filtration with a Brandel cell harvester (Semat) through Whatman GF/B glass fiber filters that had been treated with 0.3% polyethyleneimine. Filters were washed twice with 3 ml of buffer, and radioactivity retained on the filters was counted with a LKB-γ-counter at an efficiency of 63%. The binding data were evaluated by use of LIGAND, a nonlinear, weighted, least squares curve-fitting procedure(16.Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7760) Google Scholar). Changes in H2 receptor density were denoted as a percentage down-regulation compared to nontreated control cells. During the 24-h incubation of cells with various histamine ligands or other compounds, cells were maintained in medium without fetal calf serum.Cyclic AMP ProductionCHOrH2 and CHOrH2Leu124Ala cells were seeded in 24-well plates and cultured overnight in culture medium. Cells were washed twice with DMEM, supplemented with 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4 at 37°C), and preincubated for 30 min at 37°C. Thereafter, the medium was aspirated, appropriate drugs in DMEM/HEPES supplemented with 300 μM phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) were added, and the cells were incubated for 10 min at 37°C. The reaction was stopped by the rapid aspiration of the culture medium and the addition of 200 μl of 0.1 N cold HCl. The cells were kept on ice and disrupted by sonification (5 s, 50 watts, Labsonic 1510, Braun-Melsungen). The resulting homogenate was frozen at −20°C or directly neutralized with 1 N NaOH and assayed for the presence of cAMP. In order to determine the long-term effects of histamine treatment on H2 receptor signaling, CHOrH2 cells were preincubated with 100 μM histamine for 24 h in DMEM without fetal calf serum. Thereafter, these cells were thoroughly washed and preincubated for 1 h in DMEM/HEPES at 37°C before actual incubation with the indicated drugs.Cyclic AMP AssayThe amount of cAMP in the CHOrH2 and CHOrH2Leu124Ala cells was determined according to Nordstedt and Fredholm(17.Nordstedt C. Fredholm B.B. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 189: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), with some minor modifications. Briefly, a protein kinase A-containing fraction was isolated from bovine adrenal glands. Adrenal cortex was homogenized in 10 volumes of 100 mM Tris-HCl, 250 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 0.25 M sucrose, and 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol (pH 7.4 at 4°C, buffer A) using an Omni-Sorval mixer (30 s, maximal speed) and a Polytron homogenizer (10 s, maximal speed). The homogenate was centrifuged for 60 min at 30,000 × g at 4°C. The supernatant, containing protein kinase A, was carefully recovered and frozen in 1 ml aliquots at −80°C. Before use, the binding protein was diluted 5-fold in ice-cold buffer A without sucrose and 2-mercaptoethanol and kept on ice. Subsequently, 200 μl of the binding protein was mixed with 50-100 μl of the CHO homogenate or cAMP standards and 30,000 dpm of [3H]cAMP. After incubation for 150 min at 4°C, the mixture was rapidly diluted with 3 ml of ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4 at 4°C) and filtered through Whatman GF/B filters using a Brandel cell-harvester (Semat). The radioactivity retained on the filters was measured by liquid scintillation counting.RNA Slot Blot AnalysisRNA was analyzed by means of mRNA slot blot assay as described by Zhang et al.(18.Zhang L.-J. Lachowicz J.E. Sibley D.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 878-889PubMed Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, RNA was isolated according to the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi(19.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62986) Google Scholar), using Trizol reagent® (Life Technologies, Inc.), and RNA was slot-blotted on a nitrocellulose filter (GeneScreen Plus, DuPont NEN) and prehybridized for 2 h at 65°C in 7% SDS, 0.5 M Na2HPO4, 1 mM EDTA (pH 7.2). Thereafter, filters were hybridized overnight with a radioactive labeled 48-mer antisense rat H2 receptor oligonucleotide (5′-GATGGTGGCTGCCTTCCAGGAGCTGATGTGGTTGATCCGTTTGGCCTG-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 631 to 678) or antisense rat β-actin oligonucleotide (5′-CTCCTGCTTGCTGATCCACATCTGCTGGAAGGTGGACAGTGAGGCCAG-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 3040 to 3087) at 65°C in 7% SDS, 0.5 M Na2PO4, and 1 mM EDTA (pH 7.2). The rat H2 receptor oligonucleotide (1.5 pmol) was 32P-labeled by 3′-end tailing using 16 pmol of [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham) and 1 unit of terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (Boehringer) for 20 min at 37°C. The β-actin oligonucleotide (5 pmol) was labeled using 10 pmol of [γ-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham) and 4 units of polynucleotide kinase (Boehringer) for 30 min at 37°C. The blots were washed twice for 5 min at room temperature in 2 × SSC (0.3 M NaCl, 0.03 M Na3C6H5O7•2H2O) supplemented with 0.1% SDS, which was followed by two 45-min washes at 65°C with 2 × SSC supplemented with 0.1% SDS. The blots were exposed to a PhosphorScreen (Molecular Dynamics) and signals were quantified with a PhosphorImager 425 (Molecular Dynamics) using the computer program ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics). H2 receptor mRNA levels were expressed as the ratio of the values of the H2 receptor mRNA signals and the corresponding β-actin signals.Analysis of H2 Receptor mRNA StabilityH2 receptor mRNA levels were determined after incubation of the CHOrH2 cells with actinomycin D to block transcription as described previously(20.Rodgers J.R. Johnson M.L. Rosen J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 109: 572-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Cells were preincubated with or without 100 μM histamine or with 10 μM forskolin for 1 h in DMEM. Thereafter, actinomycin D (10 μg/ml) was added. Cells were harvested from 0 to 90 min after addition of actinomycin D. Total RNA was extracted at each time point, and H2 receptor mRNA was quantified by means of the mRNA slot blot assay as described above.ChemicalsHistamine dihydrochloride, isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX), cyclic AMP (cAMP), forskolin, 1,9-dideoxyforskolin, cholera toxin, and GTPγS were obtained from Sigma. Actinomycin D was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. [2,8-3H]cAMP (40 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Amersham. H-89 dihydrochloride and KT5720 were purchased from Calbiochem. Dimaprit dihydrobromide, homo- and nordimaprit dihydrochloride, amthamine dihydrobromide, amselamine dihydrobromide, and aminopotentidine were taken from laboratory stock. Gifts of cimetidine (SmithKline Beecham), ranitidine dihydrochloride (Glaxo), tiotidine (Imperial Chemical Industries), CHO cells expressing the rat H2 receptor, and pSVrH2 vector (Dr. J.-C. Schwartz) are gratefully acknowledged.Statistical AnalysisAll data shown are expressed as mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. Statistical analysis was carried out by Student's t-test. p values < 0.05 were considered to indicate a significant difference.RESULTSHistamine-induced H2 Receptor Down-regulationExposure of CHOrH2 cells (13.Traiffort E. Ruat M. Arrang J.M. Leurs R. Piomelli D. Schwartz J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2649-2653Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) to 100 μM histamine for prolonged periods of time resulted in a time-dependent decrease of [125I]APT binding (Fig. 1A). Maximum reduction of [125I]APT binding was observed after a 16-h incubation of cells with 100 μM histamine. Under this condition, histamine induced 44 ± 10% (p < 0.05) reduction of [125I]APT binding. Half-maximum reduction of the [125I]APT binding was recorded at an incubation period of approximately 7 h. A 24-h incubation of CHOrH2 cells with increasing concentrations of histamine led to a dose-dependent reduction of [125I]APT binding (EC50 value = 18 ± 6 nM, mean ± S.E., n = 7) (Fig. 1B). The observed reduction of [125I]APT binding was not reflected by a change in affinity of [125I]APT for the H2 receptor, as its dissociation constant (Kd), determined by means of saturation studies, remained unaffected in CHOrH2 cells incubated with 100 μM histamine for 24 h (Table 1). Exposure of CHOrH2 cells to histamine resulted only in a marked decrease of the total number of [125I]APT binding sites (Bmax) (Table 1).Figure 1:Time- and dose-dependent decrease of [125I]APT binding in CHOrH2 cells by histamine. A, CHOrH2 cells were incubated with 100 μM histamine for the indicated times, and [125I]APT binding in membranes was measured. The [125I]APT binding is expressed as a percentage of [125I]APT binding measured in nontreated cells. The data shown represent the mean ± S.E. of 4 independent experiments.

Chem. 1992; 35: 3239-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) induced cAMP production in CHOrH2 cells, with EC50 values lower and maximum responses comparable to histamine (Table 2). Long-term exposure (24 h) of CHOrH2 cells to amselamine or amthamine resulted in a dose-dependent decrease of [125I]APT binding with EC50 values, which were correlated with their respective EC50 values for the cAMP response. Amselamine and amthamine induced a maximal decrease of [125I]APT binding sites of 50 ± 3% and 43 ± 4% respectively. As shown in Table 2, 24-h incubation of CHOrH2 cells with 100 μM dimaprit, which exhibits a lower potency as compared to histamine, induced a 40 ± 3% decrease of [125I]APT binding sites. Dimaprit's structural analogues, homodimaprit and nordimaprit, showed strongly reduced capacities to generate cAMP with EC50 values of 1.4 ± 0.9 μM and higher than 10 μM, respectively (Table 2). The reduced ability of these dimaprit analogues to induce a cAMP response was paralleled by a lack of H2 receptor down-regulation after 24 h of incubation of CHOrH2 cells with 100 μM concentrations of the analogues (Table 2).Tabled 1Effect of Long-term Histamine Treatment on Histamine- and Forskolin-induced Signaling in CHOrH2 CellsLong-term exposure (24 h) of CHOrH2 cells with 100 μM histamine resulted in a rightward shift of the dose-response curve of the histamine-induced cAMP production (EC50 of histamine-induced cAMP response in nontreated cells: 36 ± 3 nM, mean ± S.E., n = 7, and histamine-treated cells: 1.2 ± 0.05 μM, mean ± S.E., n = 4) (Fig. 2A). The forskolin-induced rise in cAMP was not found to be affected as no change in dose dependence or impairment of the maximal forskolin-induced cAMP response was observed after a 24-h pretreatment of cells with 100 μM histamine (Fig. 2B).Figure 2:Effect of long-term histamine treatment on histamine- and forskolin-induced signaling in CHOrH2 cells. CHOrH2 cells were treated with (open circles) or without (filled circles) 100 μM histamine for 24 h in DMEM without fetal calf serum. Thereafter, cells were washed several times and incubated for 1 h with DMEM supplemented with 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. CHOrH2 cells were subsequently incubated with increasing concentrations of histamine (A) or forskolin (B) for 10 min at 37°C in DMEM in the presence of 300 μM IBMX and 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. The data represent the mean ± S.E. of 4 independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Role of cAMP in the Process of H2 Receptor Down-regulationForskolin, which directly activates adenylyl cyclase, dose dependently induced the formation of cAMP in CHOrH2 cells (Fig. 3A). Prolonged exposure (incubation periods ranging from 4 to 32 h) of CHOrH2 cells with 10 μM forskolin led to a marked reduction of 58 ± 2% [125I]APT binding (Fig. 3B). Again, no major change in affinity of [125I]APT for the H2 receptor was apparent, only a decrease in Bmax was observed when CHOrH2 cells were incubated for 24 h with 10 μM forskolin (Table 1). Maximum and half-maximum down-regulation was recorded after 16 h and approximately 7 h of incubation of CHOrH2 cells with 10 μM forskolin, respectively (Fig. 3B). The H2 receptor binding sites appeared to be dose dependently down-regulated by increasing concentrations of forskolin, with an EC50 value of 0.3 ± 0.06 μM (mean ± S.E., n = 4) (Fig. 3C). Concentrations up to 10 μM of the inactive analogue 1,9-dideoxyforskolin, which does not generate cAMP in CHOrH2 cells (Fig. 3A), did not attenuate the H2 receptor density after 24 h of pretreatment (Fig. 3D).Figure 3:Forskolin- and 1,9-dideoxyforskolin-induced cAMP production and decrease of [125I]APT binding in CHOrH2 cells. A, dose-dependent increase of the cAMP production by forskolin (filled circles) and 1,9-dideoxyforskolin (open circles). CHOrH2 cells were incubated with the indicated drugs with increasing concentrations for 10 min at 37°C in DMEM in the presence of 300 μM IBMX and 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. Data represent the mean ± S.E. of 6 independent experiments. B, forskolin-induced decrease of [125I]APT binding in CHOrH2 cells. CHOrH2 cells were incubated with 10 μM forskolin for the indicated times, and [125I]APT binding was measured. The [125I]APT binding is expressed as a percentage of [125I]APT binding measured in nontreated cells. C, dose-dependent decrease of [125I]APT binding in CHOrH2 cell membranes induced by forskolin. CHOrH2 cells were exposed to various concentrations of forskolin for 24 h. The H2 receptor density was determined as described. D, effect of 1,9 dideoxyforskolin (ddF) and forskolin (FORS) on [125I]APT binding. CHOrH2 cells were exposed to 1 and 10 μM 1,9-dideoxyforskolin (filled bars) and forskolin (open bars), respectively, for 24 h and examined for [125I]APT binding. The asterisks indicate a significant difference (p < 0.05) from control, represented by the [125I]APT binding measured in untreated cells. Data from B, C, and D were calculated as mean ± S.E. from 4 independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Cholera toxin (CTX), which irreversibly activates the Gs-protein, thereby generating cAMP, also induced a dose-dependent decrease of [125I]APT binding sites when incubated for 24 h (EC50 = 32 ± 1 ng/ml, mean ± S.E., n = 4, Fig. 4). CTX pretreatment of CHOrH2 cells resulted in a maximum down-regulation of H2 receptors of 46 ± 3%. Finally, exposure of CHOrH2 cells for 24 h to 300 μM IBMX, a cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor, also resulted in an attenuation of [125I]APT binding (26 ± 7% H2 receptor down-regulation, n = 4, mean ± S.E., p < 0.05).Figure 4:Effect of long-term treatment with CTX on [125I]APT binding in CHOrH2 cells.

Our findings prompt the hypothesis that homoconjugate-induced integrin clustering may effect the approximation and, by intermolecular cross-phosphorylation, activation of the CD19-associated PTK and subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of the CD19 receptor.

Recent studies indicated that the CD19 receptor may be a common response element involved with PTK signaling stimulated through diverse B-cell surface molecules, such as the B-cell antigen receptor, CD40 receptor, and CD72 receptor(29.Uckun F.M.

Here, we present experimental evidence that 1) the CD19 receptor is physically associated with the β1 family integrin receptors on human BCP as well as mature B-lymphocytes, and 2) engagement of the β1 family integrin receptors leads to rapid activation of the CD19-associated PTK and results in hyperphosphorylation of CD19 on tyrosine residues. The physical association between CD19 and β1 family integrins suggests that homoconjugate-induced integrin clustering may effect the approximation, activation of the CD19-associated PTK by intermolecular cross-phosphorylation, and subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of the CD19 receptor.

The DNA was sheared by several passages through a 28-gauge needle and equivalent amounts of protein in 40 μl of SDS reducing sample buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 100 μM Na3VO4, and 25 mM dithiothreitol) were loaded onto 10.5% polyacrylamide gels and electrophoresed overnight at 4 mA. The proteins were transferred to a 0.45-μm Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) for 1 h at 130 mA using a semidry transfer apparatus (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco, CA). The polyvinylidene difluoride blots were incubated with 0.5 μg/ml purified rabbit anti-phosphotyrosine antibody in blocking solution (0.9% NaCl, 10 mM Tris, 0.01% NaN3, pH 7.2, 5% bovine serum albumin, 1% ovalbumin) for 2 h at room temperature, followed by two 10-min washes in rinsing buffer. Blots were incubated with 1 μCi/ml 125I-labeled protein A (specific activity = 30 μCi/μg; ICN Biomedicals) in blocking solution. After a 30-min incubation in 125I-protein A, blots were washed three times in rinsing buffer (0.9% NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 0.01% NaN3, pH 7.2), dried, and autoradiographed using a XAR-5 film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Prestained molecular weight markers (Amersham Corp.) were included on each gel as standards. To study tyrosine phosphorylation of CD19 receptor, CD19 receptor was immunoprecipitated using the anti-CD19 mAb B43 from whole cell lysates of B-lineage lymphoid cells following the engagement of various B-cell surface receptors. In brief, following various stimulation regimens, cells (5 × 106 cells/sample) were solubilized in 0.5 ml of 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, plus 1 mM EDTA) containing 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate and 0.1 mM sodium molybdate as phosphatase inhibitors, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride as protease inhibitors on ice for 30 min. Lysates were spun twice at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C prior to immunoprecipitation. 100 μg of cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with 3 μg of B43 antibody for 90 min at 4°C. The immune complexes were collected with 50 μl of a 1:1 (v/v) slurry of protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) in Nonidet P-40 buffer. The immunoprecipitates were washed four times with Nonidet P-40 buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM sodium molybdate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin), resuspended in 50 μl of 2 × SDS reducing sample buffer, and boiled.

The CD19 receptor-linked signal transduction pathway in human B-cell precursors and mature B-cells is coupled via tyrosine phosphorylation to multiple functionally important receptors, as shown previously(29.Uckun F.M. Burkhardt A.L. Jarvis L. Jun X. Stealey B. Dibirdik I. Myers D.E. Tuel-Ahlgren L. Bolen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21172-21184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Virtually, 100% of the B-lineage lymphoid cells expressing VLA-4 or VLA-5 receptors also express the CD19 receptor on their surface (Fig. 1). We therefore hypothesized that the CD19-mediated and VLA-4- or VLA-5-mediated PTK signals may share common substrates. To test this hypothesis, we compared the profiles of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in whole cell lysates prepared at various time points after cross-linking of either the CD19 receptor or the β1 integrin family adhesion receptors VLA-4 and VLA-5 by Western blot analysis using a polyclonal antibody specific for phosphotyrosine (APT). Fig. 2A illustrates that cross-linking of the VLA-4 or VLA-5 on NALM-6 pre-B-cells with a monoclonal antibody homoconjugate results in a rapid increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple electrophoretically distinct phosphoprotein substrates with apparent molecular masses of 55, 72, 76, 95, and 120 kDa. By comparison, no increase in tyrosine phosphorylation was noted in these sIgM negative pre-B-cells after stimulation with an anti-IgM antibody homoconjugate (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained with an Epstein-Barr virus-transformed mature B-cell line (Fig. 2B). In both NALM-6 pre-B-cells and AK mature B-cells, the profile of APT reactive protein substrates after cross-linking of the VLA-4 or VLA-5 molecules with appropriate monoclonal antibody homoconjugates was essentially identical to that generated by the engagement of the CD19 receptor with an anti-CD19 × CD19 homoconjugate, suggesting that these receptors are linked to the same PTK regulatory pathway. In accordance with our previous report, the engagement of the antigen receptor on AK mature B-cells with an anti-IgM antibody triggered tyrosine phosphorylation of the same substrates as the CD19 engagement.Figure 2:Engagement of the VLA-4 or VLA-5 adhesion receptors induces tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple electrophoretically distinct substrates in human pre-B and mature B-cells. NALM-6 pre-B (shown in A) and AK mature B (shown in B) cells (5 × 106 cells/sample at a density of 5 × 106 cells/ml) were stimulated with homoconjugates (1 μg/ml) of anti-VLA-4, anti-VLA-5, or anti-CD19 monoclonal antibodies for the indicated periods to engage and dimerize the respective target receptors. Controls included unstimulated cells (C, CON), cells treated with PBS, as well as cells stimulated with Fab′2 goat anti-human IgM (1 μg/ml). After the indicated incubation periods, cells were lysed with SDS lysis buffer and boiled. Equivalent amounts of protein were fractionated on 10.5% polyacrylamide gels, transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and immunoblotted with APT antibodies followed by incubation with 125I-protein A (1 μCi/ml) and autoradiography for detection of phosphotyrosyl protein substrates.

The engagement of the CD19 receptor with a high affinity anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody or its homoconjugate rapidly activates the associated PTK and results in tyrosine phosphorylation of CD19(29.Uckun F.M.

In whole cell lysates of pre-B-cells as well as mature B-cells, a 95-kDa phosphoprotein substrate showed rapid and strong tyrosine phosphorylation after engagement of the β1 integrin family adhesion receptors VLA-4 or VLA-5 (Fig. 2). Based on its molecular mass, we hypothesized that the 95-kDa tyrosine phosphorylated protein could be the CD19 receptor, which has been shown to become tyrosine-phosphorylated following engagement of various B-cell surface receptors(29.Uckun F.M. Burkhardt A.L. Jarvis L. Jun X. Stealey B. Dibirdik I. Myers D.E. Tuel-Ahlgren L. Bolen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21172-21184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Tedder T.F.

To test this hypothesis, we subjected CD19 immune complexes from the lysates of NALM-6 pre-B-cells, which were stimulated with an anti-VLA-5 × VLA-5 homoconjugate, to APT Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3A, left panel, CD19 showed increased tyrosine phosphorylation within 1 min after VLA-5 cross-linking. The abundance of the CD19 receptor protein, as estimated by immunoblotting, did not change during the course of the experiment (Fig. 3A, right panel), suggesting increased enzymatic activity of CD19-associated PTK. Cross-linking of the VLA-4 receptor on NALM-6 cells with an anti-VLA-4xVLA-4 homoconjugate also resulted in rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of the CD19 receptor (data not shown). Similarly, CD19 receptor of AK mature B-cells showed increased tyrosine phosphorylation within 5 min after VLA-5 cross-linking (Fig. 3B, left panel) or VLA-4 cross-linking (data not shown). Lyn is the predominant PTK associated with the CD19 receptor in B-lineage lymphoid cells(29.Uckun F.M. Burkhardt A.L. Jarvis L. Jun X. Stealey B. Dibirdik I. Myers D.E. Tuel-Ahlgren L. Bolen J.B. J.

To obtain preliminary information about the possibility that the increased tyrosine phosphorylation of CD19 after VLA-5 cross-linking could be due to increased PTK activity of the CD19-associated Lyn kinase, Lyn immune complexes from Nonidet P-40 lysates of AK cells were subjected to APT Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3B, right panel, engagement of the VLA-5 receptor resulted in increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Lyn protein within 5 min. Concomitant with enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of Lyn between 5 and 20 min after VLA-5 cross-linking, CD19 became detectable in the Lyn immune complexes as a tyrosine phosphorylated protein substrate (Fig. 3B, right panel). These results indicated that activation of CD19-associated PTK, such as Lyn, may be an integral component of the signal transduction cascade triggered by β1 integrin family adhesion receptors. CD19 has been shown to be capable of forming functionally important protein complexes on the surface of human B-lineage lymphoid cells(29.Uckun F.M. Burkhardt A.L. Jarvis L. Jun X. Stealey B.

Cross-linking of the CD19-associated surface receptors may effect the approximation and, by intermolecular cross-phosphorylation, activation of the CD19-associated PTK and subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of the CD19 receptor. The ability of the β1 family integrin receptors to transmit a biochemical signal leading to hyperphosphorylation of the CD19 receptor on tyrosine residues prompted the hypothesis that a physical association may exist between CD19 and β1 family integrins. To test this hypothesis, VLA-4 and VLA-5 immune complexes from NALM-6 pre-B-cells were subjected to Western blot analysis with an anti-CD19 antibody. As shown in Fig. 4A, CD19 was detected in both the VLA-4 and VLA-5 immune complexes. CD19 is associated with Src family PTK, including Lyn, in resting pre-B and mature B-cells. To explore the possibility that homoconjugate-induced integrin clustering might activate the CD19-associated PTK, we first examined whether the PTK activity in CD19 immunoprecipitates is increased after cross-linking VLA-4 or VLA-5. For these experiments, mature B-cells were stimulated with anti-VLA-4 × VLA-4 or anti-VLA-5 × VLA-5 homoconjugates, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-CD19 mAb B43, and immune complex kinase assays were performed. As shown in Fig. 4B, the kinase activity of the CD19 immune complexes was enhanced in a time-dependent manner following stimulation with anti-VLA-4 × VLA-4 or anti-VLA-5 × VLA-5. The immunoprecipitated CD19 molecule was also phosphorylated during the kinase reactions (Fig. 4B). As reported previously, the major phosphoprotein species associated with CD19 migrated in the 50-60-kDa region. Notably, a closely spaced 53/56-kDa doublet, most likely corresponding to the autophosphorylated products of the two alternatively spliced LYN transcripts, was induced by engagement of the VLA-5 receptor but not the VLA-4 receptor. After engagement of the CD19 receptor Src family PTK, of which Lyn is the predominant member in pre-B as well as mature B-cells, are activated and phosphorylated on tyrosine residues(29.Uckun F.M. Burkhardt A.L. Jarvis L. Jun X. Stealey B. Dibirdik I. Myers D.E. Tuel-Ahlgren L. Bolen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21172-21184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Syk kinase is also activated after CD19 ligation and associates with the tyrosine-phosphorylated CD19 receptor. ( 2F. M. Uckun, unpublished observations.) Previous studies have implicated Src family PTK in integrin-linked signaling events(4.Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2815) Google Scholar). Activated Src kinase has been shown to associate with integrin-dependent cytoskeletal complexes in platelets and fibroblasts(4.Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2815) Google Scholar). Syk kinase has also been shown to associate with integrin-dependent cytoskeletal structures and to become activated in platelets after engagement of integrins(4.Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2815) Google Scholar). To examine the activation of the Lyn and Syk kinases, both of which are intimately linked to the CD19-linked signal transduction pathway, by signaling through β1 family integrin receptors, VLA-4 and VLA-5, were cross-linked on the surface of NALM-6 pre-B-cells and AK mature B-cells by addition of the appropriate homoconjugates, and the PTK activities of Lyn and Syk were estimated by immune complex kinase assays. As shown in Fig. 5, homoconjugate-induced dimerization of the VLA-5 receptor caused rapid activation of Lyn and Syk kinases in both NALM-6 and AK cells. By comparison, VLA-4 cross-linking did not significantly stimulate the Lyn kinase in either cell line (Fig. 6). Unlike Lyn, Syk kinase was activated following engagement of not only the VLA-5 receptor, but the VLA-4 receptor as well (Fig. 6).Figure 6:Engagement of the VLA-4 adhesion receptor stimulates Syk kinase in human pre-B and mature B-cells. AK mature B (depicted in A and B) and NALM-6 pre-B (depicted in C and D) cells were stimulated with an anti-VLA-4 × VLA-4 mAb homoconjugate (1 μg/ml) for the times indicated, pelleted, and lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer. Lyn (depicted in A and C) or Syk (depicted in B and D) tyrosine kinases were immunoprecipitated from these lysates, and immune complex protein kinase assays were performed, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In A-D, No 1°Ab indicates mock-immunoprecipitated lysates to which no primary antibody was added.

Other studies have indicated that the membrane-associated CD19 receptor-Lyn enzyme complex serves as a regulator of apoptosis in human B-cell precursors (37.Uckun F.M. Evans W.E. Forsyth C.J.

VLA-4 mediates cell-cell interactions in the contexts of homing(3.Ruoslahti E.

Similarly, Dittel et al.(9.Dittel B.N. McCarthy J.B. Wayner E.A. LeBien T.W. Blood. 1993; 81: 2272-2282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) found that IL-7 responsive human BCP adhere to bone marrow stroma via the VLA-4/VCAM-1 interactions, reminiscent of the observations by Miyake et al.(43.Miyake K. Weissman I.L. Greenberger J.S. Kincade P. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 599-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar) that VLA-4 on mouse pre-B-cells mediates their adhesion to bone marrow stroma. Leukemic BCP have been shown to bind to purified fibronectin via VLA-4 and VLA-5(12.Makrynikola V. Bradstock K.F. Leukemia. 1993; 7: 86-92PubMed Google Scholar). According to the findings of Bradstock et al.(11.Bradstock K. Makrynikola V. Bianchi A. Byth K. Blood. 1993; 82: 3437-3444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) the adhesion of leukemic BCP to bone marrow fibroblasts occurs predominantly through interaction of VLA-4 with VCAM-1. Furthermore, the ability of leukemic BCP to migrate into stroma depends on β1 integrin expression(10.Tang J. Scott G. Ryan D.H. Blood. 1993; 82: 3415-3423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Bradstock K.F. Gottlieb D.J. Leuk. Lymphoma. 1995; 18: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Previous studies demonstrated that treatment of leukemic BCP with antibodies to β1 common subunit or a mixture of anti-VLA-4 and anti-VLA-5 antibodies abrogates their ability to migrate into bone marrow stroma(13.Bradstock K.F.

Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 653-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Notably, infusion of a blocking antibody to the α4 subunit of the VLA-4 receptor in primates has been shown to cause a 200-fold increase in circulating hematopoietic progenitor cells, implicating the VLA-4 integrin in the regulation of the in vivo migration and trafficking of hematopoietic progenitor cells(45.Papayannopoulou T. Nakamoto B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9374Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Here, we presented experimental evidence that CD19 receptor is physically associated with the β1 family integrin receptors on human BCP as well as mature B-lymphocytes and engagement of the β1 family integrin receptors leads to rapid activation of the CD19-associated PTK and results in hyperphosphorylation of CD19 on tyrosine residues. The physical association between CD19 and β1 family integrins prompts the hypothesis that homoconjugate-induced integrin clustering may effect the approximation and, by intermolecular cross-phosphorylation, activation of the CD19-associated PTK and subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of the CD19 receptor.

Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 147-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The reaction of bovine Hb with NFPLP leads to a cross-linkage between the β subunits, which greatly stabilizes the low affinity T state of the molecule and simultaneously abolishes the tendency of the tetramer to dissociate into αβ dimers. The functional properties, examined from both the equilibrium and kinetic points of view, indicate that the chemical modification affects the O2 affinity, abolishes cooperativity, and induces a slight decrease of the Bohr effect. From modeling studies we are confronted with two different structural alternatives; the cross-link of β chains may be formed between lysine 82 of β2 and the N terminus of methionine 2 of β1 or between the two lysine 82 residues of both β2 chains. Digestion of modified β globin chains and isolation of the cross-linked peptide have showed that NFPLP cross-links Met-β2 and Lys-β82. This allowed discussion in some detail of the molecular basis of the Bohr effect of the modified bovine hemoglobin. On the whole, NFPLP-modified bovine Hb could be considered as a first step toward the synthesis of a potential blood substitute. 2-Nor-2-formylpyridoxal (NFPLP) has been synthesized and coupled to bovine Hb according to the procedure developed by Benesch and Benesch(1.Benesch R.

On the whole, NFPLP-modified bovine Hb could be considered as a first step toward the synthesis of a potential blood substitute. Over the last few decades, studies on structure-function relationships in hemoglobin have been greatly helped by naturally occurring mutants, artificially induced point mutations and specific chemical modifications at the level of some key amino acid residues. As far as the latter are concerned, the reaction of human hemoglobin with NFPLP ( 1The abbreviations used are: NFPLP2-nor-2-formylpyridoxalHb-NFPLPhemoglobin modified with NFPLP2,3-DPG2,3-diphosphoglycerateHPLChigh performance liquid chomatography.) (1.Benesch R. Benesch R.E. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 147-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) led to a covalent modification of great interest, as it yielded a hemoglobin with lowered oxygen affinity and almost unchanged cooperativity, thereby offering a unique opportunity to study the effect of organic phosphates without the complexity arising from dissociation of the effector. Moreover, hemoglobin modified by NFPLP offers additional biotechnological advantages since it shows some promise as an oxygen-carrying resuscitation fluid. In fact, this chemical modification overcomes two main disadvantages, which critically restrict the usefulness of free human Hb as an oxygen-carrying substitute for red blood cells. The first of these is inherent to the oxygen dissociation curve of free Hb whose P50 (partial pressure of oxygen at which 50% saturation is achieved) indicates a far greater affinity for O2 than normal human blood and therefore a significantly lower oxygen tension at the level of tissues; the second is related to the split of free Hb tetramers into αβ dimers, which are rapidly eliminated through the renal glomeruli and characterized by the absence of cooperativity and a very high oxygen affinity(2.Sloviter H.A. Triner L. Benesch R. Benesch R.E. Kwong S. Fed. Proc. 1982; 41: 652Google Scholar, 3.Benesch R. Triner L. Benesch R.E. Kwong S. Verosky M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2941-2947Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). As previously reported by Benesch and Benesch(1.Benesch R. Benesch R.E. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 147-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), NFPLP, by reacting with valine β1 and lysine β82 of human Hb and forming a covalent bridge located in the 2,3-DPG crevice in between the two β chains, eliminates at a single blow both the problems reported above. In this perspective, since bovine Hb does not appear to cause rapid antibody formation when injected into non-bovine species(4.Feola M. Gonzalez H. Canizaro P.C. Surg. Gynecol. Obstet. 1983; 157: 399-408PubMed Google Scholar), many authors have investigated the possibility of using bovine Hb as a substitute for human blood(5.Fronticelli C. Sato T. Orth C. Bucci E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 874: 76-81Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 25.Fronticelli C. Bucci E. Razynska A. Sznajder J. Urbaitis B. Gryczynski Z. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Along the same lines we used NFPLP to modify bovine Hb, with the aim of obtaining further information on the structure-function relationships of this hemoglobin, known to display peculiar functional characteristics. In fact, bovine Hb belongs to a group of mammalian hemoglobins that, in the presence of physiological concentrations of chloride, have an oxygen affinity lower than that of human HbA being also insensitive to the presence of 2,3-DPG. The failure of bovine Hb to respond to 2,3-DPG was explained by the peculiar N termini of β subunits, i.e. the deletion of the residue at position β1 and the presence of a hydrophobic residue, usually Met, at position β2. According to Perutz and Imai(6.Perutz M.F. Imai K. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 136: 726-739Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar), these structural differences are at the basis of the decreased influence of organic phosphates. On this basis, bovine Hb appears to be modulated in vivo essentially by chloride ions, which may thus be considered its physiologically relevant effector. We were interested in investigating the possibility of improving the functional characteristics that render this protein a potential blood substitute through a specific chemical modification at the level of the anion binding site between the two β chains. To this end we were helped by a recent elegant work on the structural features of bovine hemoglobin(7.Perutz M.F. Fermi G. Poyart C. Pagnier J. Kister J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 536-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), which allowed us to go further into the structure-function relationships of the NFPLP-modified bovine hemoglobin. 2-nor-2-formylpyridoxal hemoglobin modified with NFPLP 2,3-diphosphoglycerate high performance liquid chomatography. Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals employed were obtained in the highest grade commercially available from Aldrich. Bovine blood was provided from the local slaughterhouse. The product was obtained according to the procedure described by Benesch and Benesch (1.Benesch R. Benesch R.E.

Tranfusion. 1987; 27: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Hb was prepared and purified as described previously for human hemoglobin(10.Bellelli A. Brunori M. Condó S. Giardina B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2624-2629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the amount of methemoglobin was checked by measuring the absorption at 630 nm and always found to be less than 1%. Red cells, washed three times with isotonic NaCl solution, were lysed with two volumes of 1 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0); stromas were eliminated by centrifugation. Removal of any organic phosphates from bovine Hb was obtained by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-25 column (2 cm × 30 cm), equilibrated with 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), containing 0.1 M NaCl. All columns were kept at 2-4°C. Cellulose acetate electrophoresis on the hemeolysate and purified Hb was performed as described by D'Avino et al.(11.D'Avino R. Di Prisco G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The modified protein was prepared by reducing the imine formed, under anaerobic conditions, by NFPLP and stroma-free bovine Hb with sodium borohydride according to the method of Benesch and Benesch(1.Benesch R. Benesch R.E. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 147-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A 15 mg/ml solution of bovine Hb was extensively dialyzed against 0.1 M Tris acetate buffer, pH 7.5. Chemical modification of the Hb was done on 12 ml (≈3 μmol) of the dialyzed solution in 0.1 M Tris acetate buffer, pH 7.5, in the presence of 20 μl of anti-floating (caprylic alcohol) and after 60 min of flushing with nitrogen. The molar Hb tetramer to NFPLP ratio was 1:2.5. Addition of NFPLP (1.9 mg/0.5 ml of Tris acetate buffer) was performed in a water bath at 10°C; after 40 min, 7.5 μmol of NaBH4 in 0.6 ml of 1.0 mM NaOH were added and the reaction was allowed to progress for 30 min with moderate stirring under nitrogen. The reaction mixture was finally dialyzed to remove any excess of free NFPLP. The dialyzed mixture was purified by chromatography on diethylaminoethyl (DEAE 52, Whatman) cellulose, column (2 cm × 25 cm), equilibrated with 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), and fractions were collected after monitoring by isoelectric focusing. Extraction was done basically following the method of Rossi-Fanelli et al.(12.Rossi-Fanelli A. Antonini E. Caputo A. Adv. Protein Chem. 1964; 19: 73-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Hb in 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, was added slowly by stirring with 10 volumes of cold acetone, 0.2% in HCl cooled at −20°C according to the method of Ascoli et al.(13). The globin precipitated, and the heme remained in the acid/acetone phase. The sample was allowed to stand at 0°C for 10 min, and the precipitated globin was isolated by centrifugation of the sample solution at 2500 × g at 4°C. The precipitated chains were monitored by electrophoresis on cellulose acetate. The α and β subunits of bovine Hb-NFPLP were resolved on a Brownlee C8 column (10 μm) using the gradients developed by Shelton et al.(14.Shelton J.B. Shelton J.R. Schroeder W.A. J. Liq. Chromatogr. 1981; 4: 1381-1392Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The molecular weight distribution of the separated α and β chains of untreated bovine Hb and NFPLP-reacted hemoglobin was estimated by electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide according to Laemmli(15.Laemmli U.K. Nature (London). 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (204800) Google Scholar). An LMW electrophoresis calibration kit (94,000, 67,000, 43,000, 30,000, 20,100, and 14,4000 daltons) was purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Spectrophotometrically (Cary 2300) determinations were done by the tonometric method (16.Giardina B. Amiconi G. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) in the presence and in the absence of the physiological cofactor chloride, at 20°C. Oxygen dissociation kinetics were followed using a HI-TECH stopped-flow SHU apparatus by mixing oxygenated hemoglobin with a solution of sodium dithionite. The kinetics of the dissociation of oxygen from NFPLP-Hb was followed by mixing the oxygenated derivative of both the native and the cross-linked protein with sodium dithionite using a stopped-flow apparatus(17.Gibson Q.H. Prog. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1959; 9: 1-53Crossref Google Scholar). The spectra were obtained on a Varian Gemini spectrometer operating at 300 MHz for 1H and at 121.48 MHz for 31P. The 1H chemical shifts are expressed in relation to the protons resonance of residual water in D2O solvent. The 31P spectrum was the result of averaging 140,000 (cross-linked Hb) and 800 (NFPLP) transients at a repetition rate of 0.7 s-1; the 31P chemical shifts are expressed in relation to the 31P resonance of 85% phosphoric acid. The molecular models described were constructed by modifying the crystallographic structure of the bovine hemoglobin (code 1HDA; Protein Data Bank, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY)(7.Perutz M.F. Fermi G. Poyart C. Pagnier J. Kister J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 536-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Computational results were obtained using software programs from Biosym Technologies, San Diego, CA. The models were constructed with the aid of the INSIGHTII modeling system, using, where possible, units from within the fragment library. Minimizations were done with the DISCOVER program, using the CVFF force field, and graphical displays were printed out from the InsightII molecular modeling system running on a Silicon graphics workstation. Both modified and unmodified β globins (1 mg each) were digested with L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin in 0.1 M ammonium bicarbonate at pH 8.0 and 37°C for 24 h. Tryptic peptide mixtures were purified on a reversed-phase column (Aquapore RP 300) developed in 60 min with a linear gradient to 0-60% acetonitrile in 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate 1.0 ml/min. The elution of the peptides was monitored at 220 nm. Amino acid analysis was carried out on the purified peptide hydrolyzed in the vapor phase with 6 M HCl at 110°C for 24 h. The amino acid composition of the hydrolyzed peptide was determined using a Pharmacia 4151 Alpha Plus instrument. Fig. 1 shows the 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of the NFPLP dialdehyde. From the reaction between this latter compound and bovine Hb, a Schiff's base was obtained. The reduction with sodium borohydride of this formed base, yielded the bovine Hb-NFPLP adduct that was purified by DEAE-cellulose column as reported under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 2 shows a typical chromatogram obtained from the Hb-NFPLP reaction mixture. The elution profile indicates that the α chains had the same mobility in the two proteins, while the β chains of the Hb-NFPLP were slightly more mobile than the β chains of bovine Hb. These assignations were made by using a mixture of the two hemoglobins. To obtain further confirmation regarding the synthesis of the Hb adduct, 31P nuclear magnetic resonance of purified chromatographic fractions was also performed (Fig. 3), confirming the presence of the phosphorous atom in the molecule of the cross-linked Hb. The chemical shifts are defined as positive if they are downfield from the reference signal. Under the conditions of our experiments, this phosphate group was able to exist in the complex state with Hb-NFPLP. SDS-polyacrylamide gels of bovine hemoglobin modified with NFPLP showed two bands of equal concentration under deoxygenated conditions, with molecular masses corresponding to 16,000 daltons and 32,000 daltons as established by comparison with marker proteins. Since the latter value is twice the molecular weight of isolated hemoglobin chains, this new band has been taken to represent a dimeric species which, through electrophoresis on cellulose acetate performed after denaturation in acidic acetone, has been demonstrated to be the result of a chemical linkage established between the β chains. The nanometer values of the absorption maxima for deoxy- (554 and 430), oxy- (576, 541, 413), nitrosyl- (572, 540 and 416), and carbonyl-cross-linked Hb (571, 539 and 419), in the range of pH 6.7-8.8, were practically indistinguishable from those of the corresponding maxima of bovine Hb. The oxygen affinity of the purified Hb-NFPLP was determined in the presence of 0.1 M chloride at pH values between 6.5-8.0 and 20°C; under these conditions the Bohr effects of Hb-NFPLP and of normal bovine Hb were superimposable at acidic pH, while above neutrality the curves differentiated and bovine Hb-NFPLP showed a decreased affinity (Fig. 4). Moreover, since the physiological effector of this hemoglobin is chloride, a number of experiments were performed in the complete absence of this ion in order to see whether the introduction of the NFPLP in the β cleft led to the inhibition of the chloride effect. Further experiments have shown that the oxygen affinity of the purified Hb-NFPLP is virtually insensitive to the presence of chloride whose effect, clearly present in the normal protein, has completely vanished. Moreover, the Bohr effect is largely maintained in Hb-NFPLP, although somewhat reduced with respect to the unmodified protein due to the decrease of oxygen affinity observed at pH values higher than 7.2. However, cooperativity is almost completely abolished, as indicated by the Hill coefficient (n50), which is very close to unity (1.1 ± 0.1) (Fig. 5). In order to define some kinetic parameters of the reaction with oxygen of the bovine Hb-NFPLP, a number of rapid mixing experiments were performed by mixing the oxygenated derivative of bovine Hb-NFPLP with Na2S2O4. Parallel experiments were made with unmodified bovine Hb. In both cases the kinetics of the reaction is strongly biphasic (fast phase: 75%) as the relative proportions of the two processes are essentially pH-independent; the rate of deoxygenation measured for the two kinetic phases appears strongly dependent on pH, although this dependence is more evident in normal bovine Hb. The value of the velocity constant of both phases is independent of hemoglobin and dithionite concentrations, and therefore the reaction may be described in terms of two independent first order processes. For both the fast and slow phase, the plot of the value of the rate constant versus pH is a symmetrical curve corresponding to a simple titration. However, the cross-linked Hb presented, with or without chloride, a deoxygenation rate constant kfast slightly slower than the corresponding constant of bovine Hb; in contrast, kslow was always higher. The titration of Hb-NFPLP showed that both the pKa values shifted to more acidic pH in relation to bovine Hb (Table 1). Determination of the crystal structure of Bovine Hb has shown that the most important structural difference with respect to human hemoglobin is a shift, at the level of that crevice which in human hemoglobin constitutes the organic phosphate binding site, of both the N terminus and A-helix closer to the dyad axis(7.Perutz M.F. Fermi G. Poyart C. Pagnier J. Kister J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 536-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In consideration of these features, we explored the residues that could be involved in the cross-linking of the two β chains of bovine Hb by NFPLP. In principle, and similarly to human Hb, the cross-link could be established between lysine 82 of β2 and the N-terminal methionine 2 of β1 or between the two lysine 82 residues of both β chains(1.Benesch R. Benesch R.E. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 147-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). As reported in Fig. 6, a cross-link between methionine 2 and lysine 82 can be established by moving the amino group of methionine β1 and the ε amino group of β2 lysine 82 closer to the central cavity by approximately 3.5 and 1.5 Å, respectively. Only a slight movement was necessary for β2 histidine 143 and the side chain of β1 lysine 82 to form electrostatic interactions with the phenolate anion and the phosphate group, respectively. Cross-linking lysine 82 of β1 and lysine 82 of β2 did not necessitate a significant movement of the β lysines; however, both the amino groups of methionine 2 and histidine 143 were moved by approximately 3-4 Å in order to form electrostatic interactions with the phosphate of NFPLP. Fig. 7 shows the comparison between the chromatographic patterns of the NFPLP-reacted and unreacted β chains of bovine Hb. The two chromatograms are completely superimposable with the exception of the peak eluting at a retention time of 61.5 min, present in the chromatogram of the cross-linked hemoglobin and absent in the other. The amino acid analysis of the purified peak gave an amino acid composition corresponding to the sum of the tryptic fragments 1-7 and 77-95 (Table 2) derived from the bovine β chain, thus confirming that NFPLP cross-links Met-β2 and Lys-β82. According to our modeling studies, it was not possible to discriminate between two different structural alternatives (Met-2-Lys-82 or Lys-82-Lys-82) for the cross-link; this problem has been solved by digestion of β globin chains and following isolation of the cross-linked peptide. Sequence analysis of this peptide has shown that the reaction with NFPLP occurs between the Met-2 of one β chain and Lys-82 of the other β subunit of the bovine Hb molecule. This suggested that the tetrameric structure was no more able to dissociate into αβ dimers. This is clearly shown by electrophoresis on cellulose acetate of the globins, which shows, in addition to the band relative to the α chains, the presence of a band relative to the cross-linked β chains. Regarding the functional properties of bovine Hb-NFPLP, these indicate that the chemical modification affects its affinity for oxygen and abolishes homotropic interactions and the effect of chloride, inducing a decrease (≈35%) of the Bohr effect. The decrease in oxygen affinity observed in the case of bovine Hb-NFPLP in the absence of chloride, when compared to normal bovine Hb, is of peculiar significance since it indicates that the negative charges of NFPLP may substitute chloride ions in regulating the oxygen affinity acting in much the some way as 2,3-DPG does in human HbA. Given the situation, the oxygen affinity of Hb-NFPLP is no longer affected by Cl- and it is very similar to and even lower than (depending on the pH) the corresponding affinity of the native bovine Hb in the presence of these ions. The loss of cooperativity and the low oxygen affinity suggest that the reaction with NFPLP, performed under anaerobic conditions, preferentially stabilize the T conformational state of the new molecule. This is also indicated by the oxygen binding curve which corresponds, at all the pH values examined, to the lower asymptote of the untreated bovine Hb (Fig. 4). In this respect, it may be worthwhile recalling that the same chemical modification performed on human HbA results in a considerable drop in the oxygen affinity but has only a small effect on the degree of homotropic interactions, being the Hill coefficient n50 ≈ 1.9, versus 2.7 for the native molecule(18.Benesch R. Benesch R.E. Yung S. Edalji R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 63: 1123-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In the case of human HbA, therefore, NFPLP is not able to freeze the Hb molecule in the low affinity conformational state. The difference seen between human HbA and bovine Hb in their reaction with NFPLP must be ascribed to specific structural characteristics belonging to the bovine molecule. This may well be related to the shift of the A-helix toward the dyad axis of the tetrameric structure observed in the crystal structure of bovine Hb, which has been recently interpreted as the main characteristic responsible for the low intrinsic oxygen affinity of this Hb(7.Perutz M.F. Fermi G. Poyart C. Pagnier J. Kister J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 536-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In this perspective, spectroscopic observations on the nitric oxide derivative may be relevant, as these have clearly demonstrated that the Hb of ruminants populates its T conformational state much more than other mammalian hemoglobins, even in the liganded derivatives(6.Perutz M.F. Imai K. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 136: 726-739Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 19.Bunn H.F. Science. 1971; 172: 1049-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). As a matter of fact, a similar shift, although less pronounced, has been observed in human HbA upon binding of organic phosphate(20.Arnone A. Nature (London). 1972; 237: 146-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Moreover, previous studies on the structure of human HbA modified by NFPLP have shown that the cross-linking reaction induces the amino group of Val-β1 to move about 3 Å into the central cavity. As a result the N-terminal peptide and the beginning of the A-helix are pulled closer to the EF corner and the E-helix. All these findings, relative to human HbA, support the hypothesis that the relative position of A-helix does play a significant role in the modulation of the oxygen affinity. In addition, it would be important to outline that on the basis of stereochemical characteristics of the cavity between the two β chains Arnone et al.(21.Arnone A. Benesch R.E. Benesch R. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 115: 627-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) would have expected the reaction with NFPLP to “freeze” the tetramer in the T state, thereby producing a low affinity non-cooperative tetramer. As already mentioned, contrary to this expectation HbA-NFPLP modified appeared to be still cooperative (n50 ≈ 1.9). The forecast of Arnone et al. is completely fulfilled by bovine Hb, whose NFPLP derivative appears first to be frozen in the T conformational state and second to have fully abolished the cooperative effect. This differences in behavior may find an explanation on the basis of the following considerations. (a) In bovine Hb the A-helix is closer to the dyad axis with respect to HbA even in the absence of any organic phosphate effector (7.Perutz M.F. Fermi G. Poyart C. Pagnier J. Kister J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 536-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In some way this intrinsic difference of the molecule may facilitate the molecule to fully populate the T conformational state. (b) Our modeling studies show that the cross-link between Met-β2 and Lys-β82 can be established by moving the amino group of methionine β1 and the β2 ε-amino group of lysine closer to the central cavity by approximately 3.5 and 1.5 Å, respectively. Upon NFPLP reaction, therefore, the A-helix should be further shifted toward the interior of the molecule thereby strongly stabilizing the T state. Other interesting observations are related to the Bohr effect of both the native and the NFPLP-reacted protein. The cross-linked Hb displays identical Bohr effects both in the presence and in the absence of Cl-. Moreover, this Bohr effect is decreased by 35% with respect to that of the untreated molecule. It is therefore very likely that this 35% of the Bohr effect, which in the native protein appears to be Cl--linked, has to be ascribed to one (or both) of the residues that are involved in the cross-linking of the β chains or to some other residues that, to come into operation, need the switch from the T to the R state of the molecule. As far as the enhancement of the alkaline Bohr effect by chloride ions is concerned, point mutations and chemical modification experiments (22.Nigen A.M. Manning J.M. Alben J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5525-5529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Perutz M.F. Kilmartin J.V. Nishikura K. Fogg J.H. Butler P.J.G. Rollema H.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 138: 649-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) have indicated that, within the central cavity, the replacement of either two pairs of cationic groups by neutral ones, or of a single cationic group by an anionic one, is sufficient to inhibit the Cl- effect no matter which residues are altered. On the basis of these findings and of structural results, it has been suggested (7.Perutz M.F. Fermi G. Poyart C. Pagnier J. Kister J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 536-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) the absence of any specific chloride binding sites. Hence, it has been proposed that the effect of Cl- could be due to the widening of the central cavity on transition from the R to the T structure. This would allow Cl- to diffuse in and neutralize the excess of positive charges, lining the central cavity, without being bound to any one of them. Consequently, the enhancement of the Bohr effect by Cl- is due to a rise in pK values (i.e. increased binding of protons) of the cationic groups within the central cavity. Our results are in agreement with this view, since the cross-linkage abolishes the positive charge of Lys-β82 and introduces in the cavity between the β chains the three potential negative charges of the NFPLP molecule. According to the above reported considerations, the Cl- effect on the O2 affinity and the chloride-induced Bohr effect are vanished. In addition, it is necessary to consider that the strong impairment of T → R conformation transition also goes in the same direction. Thus the O2-linked widening of the central cavity and the following diffusion of Cl- can no more occur in the NFPLP-modified bovine Hb; therefore, the differential “binding” of these ions cannot show up. However, it should not be forgotten that a significant part of the Bohr effect (i.e. the chloride-independent part) appears to be displayed by a molecule that is frozen in the low affinity T state. This may be taken as an indication that, at least in NFPLP-modified bovine Hb, a significant part of the pH dependence of the O2 affinity finds its molecular basis at the level of the tertiary structure. The details of this effect remain to be seen. In any case, concerning a potential blood substitute, the functional properties of the NFPLP-modified bovine Hb are not completely satisfactory. The main disadvantage is the absence of cooperativity, which may not be fully compensated by the very low oxygen affinity of the protein. However, an additional step could be the synthesis of an intertetramer supermolecule in which several modified bovine Hb tetramers are linked together by means of bifunctional reagents such as dialdehydes. Since most of these modifications are known to result in a strong destabilization of the T structure in favor of the high affinity R state, we may have the chance of partially restoring heme-heme interactions through the formation of intermolecular cross-links and supermolecular structures. Finally, since NFPLP-bovine Hb has lost all its cooperative interactions, according to allosteric models(24.Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6001) Google Scholar), the kinetic parameters obtained may be thought to belong to the low affinity T state of the molecule. The kinetics of the dissociation of oxygen from NFPLP-Hb was followed by mixing the oxygenated derivative of both the native and the cross-linked protein with sodium dithionite using a stopped-flow apparatus. When the reaction of dithionite with free oxygen is not rate-limiting, the time course of the observed process obeys first order kinetics, and the measured rate constant represents an overall dissociation of the ligand from saturated Hb. The deoxygenation process is characterized by two phases, one being faster with a relative amplitude corresponding to nearly 75% of the total change; Table 1 reports the koff constants for oxygen measured by the dithionite method. Moreover, the rate of dissociation is significantly affected by pH (Fig. 8). The titration curve is symmetrical and corresponds to simple process whose pK values are, for kfast, 7.30 ± 0.20 and 6.91 ± 0.52, and for kslow, 7.40 ± 0.31 and 5.93 ± 0.45, respectively, for the native and the modified protein. From these values it appears that in the cross-linked Hb the Bohr effect does not receive any significant contribution from the dissociation velocity constant; in fact, the pK of the transition is only in a region of pH in which the Bohr effect is completely over. In contrast, in the case of native protein it appears very clearly that the pH dependence of the oxygen affinity may find part of its kinetic expression in the rate constant of oxygen dissociation on the basis of the pK values of both the Bohr effect and the transition of the velocity constant. Hence, this difference in behavior seems to be related to the inhibition of the ligand-linked allosteric transition brought about by the chemical modification."

Here we report that TGF-β1 signals inhibition of IL-3-dependent 32D-123 murine myeloid cell growth by modulating the activities of cyclin E and cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (cdk2) proteins and their complex formation in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Whereas the cyclin E protein was hyperphosphorylated in TGF-β1-treated cells, TGF-β1 decreased both the phosphorylation of cdk2 and the kinase activity of the cyclin E-cdk2 complex.

Similar to RB, p107 is a potent inhibitor of E2F-mediated transactivation, and overexpression of p107 can inhibit the proliferation of certain cell types by arresting the cells in G1(17.Lees E. Faha B. Dulic V. Reed S.I. Harlow E. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 1874-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 25.Zhu L. van den Heuvel S. Helin K. Fattaey A. Ewen M. Livingston D. Dyson N. Harlow E. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1111-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). More recent studies have provided evidence for p107 binding to the c-Myc protein, suggesting for the first time a possible role for p107 in the regulation of c-Myc function(26.Gu W. Bhatia K. Magrath I.T. Dang C.V. Dalla-Favera R. Science. 1994; 264: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). p107 is usually underphosphorylated during G1 and is phosphorylated in the S, G2, and M phases(27.Ewen M.E. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1994; 13: 45-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). However, the regulation of p107 function during growth suppression remains to be elucidated. TGF-β1 is a multifunctional regulator of cell growth and differentiation in many cell types, including epithelial, endothelial, and hematopoietic cells(28.Massague J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 597-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (2990) Google Scholar, 29.Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. The Transforming Growth Factor-betas. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Federal Republic of Germany1990Google Scholar). In epithelial cells, it has been shown that the TGF-β1-induced proliferative block occurs in late G1 and thus prevents DNA synthesis(30.Koff A. Ohtsuki M. Polyak K. Roberts J.M. Massague J. Science. 1993; 260: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 31.Eblen S.T. Fautsch M.P. Burnette R.J. Joshi P. Leof E.B.

TGF-β1 inhibition of keratinocyte proliferation involves the suppression of c-myc transcription via hypophosphorylation of RB. It has been shown that one of the steps by which TGF-β1 exerts its inhibitory effects on cell cycle progression is by preventing the hyperphosphorylation of RB(34.Furukawa Y. Uenoyama S. Ohta M.

Cell. 1990; 62: 175-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). This TGF-β1-mediated block in RB hyperphosphorylation also prevents the transactivation of the c-myc gene, which causes c-Myc protein levels to decline rapidly(36.Pietenpol J.A. Stein R.W. Moran E. Yaciuk P. Schlegel R. Lyons R.M. Pittelkow M.R. Munger K. Howley P.M. Moses H.L. Cell. 1990; 61: 777-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). In addition, in Mv1Lu cells TGF-β1 also has been shown to disturb the assembly of cyclin E-cdk2 complexes and cyclin E-associated kinase activity(32.Geng Y. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10315-10319Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The growth of interleukin 3 (IL-3)-dependent myeloid leukemic cell lines is inhibited by TGF-β1(37.Ohta J. Greenberger J. Anklesaria P. Bassols A. Massague J. Nature. 1987; 329: 539-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 38.Keller J.R. Mantel C. Sing G. Ellingsworth L.R. Ruscetti S.K. Ruscetti F.W. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 168: 737-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms involved in TGF-β1-induced growth inhibition and cell cycle progression in myeloid cells remain largely unknown and may be different from those found in keratinocytes and other epithelial cells. Because TGF-β1 plays a critical role in hematopoiesis, the molecular mechanisms by which TGF-β1 inhibits myeloid cell proliferation, specifically at the G1/S transition, were studied. These results indicate that in myeloid cells, TGF-β1 modestly inhibits the association of the cyclin E-cdk2 complexes and markedly inhibits the activity of the complex, as well as markedly stimulating phosphorylation of cyclin E and dephosphorylation of cdk2. However, phosphorylation of RB was unchanged in synchronized IL-3-dependent 32D-123 myeloid cells treated with TGF-β1. In contrast, we found that in response to TGF-β1 treatment of the 32D-123 myeloid cells, p107 was hypophosphorylated, and p107 binding to E2F and to c-Myc was increased. This modulation of p107 by TGF-β1 together with the ability of antisense to p107 to block TGF-β1 inhibition of growth suggests a novel mechanism by which TGF-β1 blocks cell cycle progression in myeloid cells. 32D-123 is a diploid, nonleukemic, nontumorigenic, and IL-3-dependent murine myeloid cell line (39.Greenberger J.S. Sakakeeny M.A. Humphries R.K. Eaves C.J. Eckner R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2931-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured at 2-5 × 105 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 10% (v/v) conditioned medium from the WEHI-3 cell line (WEHI-CM) or recombinant murine IL-3 as a source of IL-3 for these experiments. Cell proliferation was determined by pulsing with 0.2 μCi/well [3H]thymidine (6.7 Ci/mmol; DuPont) 6 h before the end of incubation, and [3H]thymidine incorporation was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Cells were synchronized at the G1/S boundary of the cell cycle by aphidicolin treatment (40.Ayusawa D. Shumizu K. Koyama H. Takeishi K. Seno T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12448-12454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or at the G0 by IL-3 and serum deprivation. Aphidicolin treatment was used to define the different phases of the cell cycle, whereas IL-3 deprivation allowed synchronization of the cells at the G0 phase. Logarithmically growing cells were incubated for 12 h at 37°C in the presence of 2 μg/ml aphidicolin. After synchronization, cells were washed twice with fresh serum-free medium, resuspended at 5× 105 cells/ml in complete medium without aphidicolin, and then reincubated at 37°C in Corning culture flasks. For IL-3 deprivation, logarithmically growing cells were washed twice with serum-free medium followed by incubation in serum-free medium at 37°C for 18 h. After G0 arrest, cells were treated with IL-3 (1,000 units/ml) and 10% fetal calf serum. Synchrony was monitored by serial cell counts, measurement of [3H]thymidine incorporation, and cell cycle analysis. For [3H]thymidine incorporation, the cells were pulsed with 0.2 μCi of [3H]thymidine/well for 6 h, and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Cell cycle analysis was performed by staining DNA with 0.05 mg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) for 1 h and then analyzing DNA by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS IV flow cytometer; Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). For detection of propidium iodide, cells were excited at 488 nm, and their emissions were collected between 515 and 545 nm. Cells were lysed in SDS-RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.2% SDS) including protease inhibitors (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin (Sigma)), and cell lysates were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) and immunoblotted using a 1:100-1:1,000 dilution of primary antibodies (mouse anti-human cyclin E, rabbit anti-human cyclins A, B, or D, or rabbit anti-human cdc2, cdk2, or cdk4 known to react with murine proteins; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Immunoblots were then washed, reacted with biotin-labeled secondary antibodies (1:5,000; Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD), washed, reacted with peroxidase-streptavidin-labeled tertiary antibodies (1:5,000), washed, and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.). Cells were cultured and synchronized by aphidicolin treatment or IL-3 deprivation as described earlier, except that 4 h before each time point, aliquots of 1 × 107 cells were gently pelleted and resuspended in labeling medium (phosphate-free RPMI 1640 containing 10% (v/v) dialyzed fetal calf serum). After incubation at 37°C for 30 min to deplete the intracellular pool of phosphate, cells were pelleted, resuspended, and incubated in 1 ml of labeling medium containing 0.4 mCi of 32P (8,500-9,120 Ci/mmol; DuPont) for 3.5 h at 37°C. Cells were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with RIPA buffer containing phosphatase inhibitors (10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mM sodium fluoride, and 2 mM sodium orthovanadate). The cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min to remove cellular debris and precleared with protein A/G-agarose. Proteins were then immunoprecipitated by incubation with antibodies (anti-cyclin E, cdk2, RB, or p107, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and protein A/G-agarose at 4°C for 4 h with rotation. Immunoprecipitates were washed once with RIPA buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin (RIPA/BSA), twice with RIPA, boiled for 5 min at 100°C in SDS-sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. For the phosphatase treatments, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-p107 antibody, washed once with RIPA/BSA, twice with RIPA, and twice with phosphatase buffer (10 mM MOPS, pH 7.5, 60 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 M NaCl, 1 mg/ml BSA). Washed immunoprecipitates were incubated for 15 min at 37°C in 100 μl of phosphatase buffer with protein phosphatase 1A (0.5 unit; Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Following incubation, the supernatant was aspirated, SDS-sample buffer was added to stop the reaction, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (4-15%) and Western blotting with an anti-p107 antibody. Lysates from aphidicolin-treated or IL-3-deprived synchronized cells were immunoprecipitated with antibodies (anti-cyclin E, A, B, cdk2, E2F, RB, or p107) and protein A/G-agarose at 4°C for 4 h with rotation. Immunoprecipitates were washed once with RIPA/BSA, twice with RIPA, and twice with kinase buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM MnCl2, and 1 μM cold ATP). The kinase activity of the immunoprecipitates was determined by incubation with reaction buffer (5 μCi [γ-32P]ATP (5,000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Corp.) and histone H1 (0.3 mg/ml) in kinase buffer) for 30 min at 37°C. Phosphorylated histone H1 was resolved by SDS-PAGE (12%); washed three times with 5% trichloroacetic acid, 1% sodium pyrophosphate; and visualized by autoradiography. The mouse RB expression vector (pmRB) was kindly provided by Dr. Paul D. Robbins (University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine). pmRB contains an EcoRI (position −100) to OxaNI (position +2,766) mouse cDNA fragment cloned into the EcoRI and ClaI sites of pJ3Ω(41.Robbins P.D. Horowitz J.M. Mulligan F.R.C. Nature. 1990; 346: 668-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The mouse p107 expression vector (mp107) is a 4.8-kilobase full-length cDNA that was cloned from a pre-B cell line (22D6) cDNA λgt10 library and then subcloned into the NotI site of pBluescript SK. ( 2M.-H. Lee and E. Harlow, unpublished data.) After amplification in RB404 (dam-) bacteria, the clone was cut with NotI and BclI enzymes. (The BclI site is located 12 base pairs after the stop codon.) The 3.25-kilobase fragment was subcloned into the NotI and BamHI sites of the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat-driven expression vector, pREP 9 (Invitrogen, San Diego). A 500-base pair NotI-EcoRV fragment of mouse p107 cDNA comprising the 5′-noncoding region, the ATG translation initiation codon, and a 440-base pair coding sequence was inserted at the NheI of the pMAM-Neo-CAT vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) by standard linker ligation. Antisense and sense clones (pMAM-107 AS and pMAM-107 S) with reference to the murine mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat were identified by HindIII restriction analysis. GAL4-E2F was constructed by inserting a polymerase chain reaction-generated fragment that contains murine E2F sequences into the SaII and XbaI sites in the polylinker of pBluescript SK+(42.Kaelin Jr., W.G. Krek W. Sellers W.R. DeCaprio J.A. Ajchenbaum F. Fuchs C.S. Chittenden T. Li Y. Farnham P.J. Blanar M.A. Livingston D.M. Flemington E.K. Cell. 1992; 70: 351-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). The GAL4-E2F construction used in these experiments contains the complete 440 amino acids of the E2F protein fused to the DNA binding domain of GAL4 (amino acids 1-147). The reporter construction, G1B, contains one GAL4 binding site upstream of the adenovirus E1b box driving CAT(41.Robbins P.D. Horowitz J.M. Mulligan F.R.C. Nature. 1990; 346: 668-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The 32D-123 cells (1 × 107/200 μl) were transfected by electroporation as described previously(43.Birchenall-Roberts M.C. Ruscetti F.W. Kasper J. Lee H.D. Friedman R. Geiser A. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Kim S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4978-4983Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Briefly, after the addition of DNA (50 μg of mp107, 50 μg of pmRB, or control pUC-18 (50 μg)), the cells were chilled on ice for 10 min. Cells were then electroporated in a Bio-Rad gene pulser system (0.3 kilovolts, 960 microfarads) and incubated on ice for 10 min. The cells were cultured at a concentration of 1 × 106/ml for 24 h. At this time point, cells were counted, and cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion. To determine cell proliferation, 5 × 103 viable cells/well were incubated for 16 h in a 96-well plate, and cell proliferation was measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation as described above or using the MTT assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI). The murine myeloid 32D-123 cells were transfected using the electroporation method as described previously (43.Birchenall-Roberts M.C. Ruscetti F.W. Kasper J. Lee H.D. Friedman R. Geiser A. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Kim S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4978-4983Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of DNA were transfected in each case by the addition of pBR322 when necessary. After 24 h at 37°C the cells were harvested, and the protein concentration of the cell lysates was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. CAT enzyme activity was normalized for transfection efficiency by cotransfection of secreted growth hormone expression plasmid, pSV6H, and determination of secreted growth hormone in the medium, prior to harvesting for CAT activity (Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano, CA). Equal amounts of protein were used to assay for the CAT enzyme, and each assay was repeated at least three times. Previous studies by our laboratory, using exponentially growing nonsynchronized cells, have demonstrated the ability of TGF-β1 to inhibit 32D-123 cell proliferation(44.Luscher B. Eisenman R.N. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 2025-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 45.Birchenall-Roberts M.C. Falk L.A. Kasper J. Keller J. Faltynek C.R. Ruscetti F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9617-9621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To define more specifically the phase of the cell cycle where TGF-β1 exerts its inhibitory effects, we synchronized the 32D-123 cells using two methods: 1) aphidicolin treatment, which reversibly inhibits DNA polymerase-α activity and DNA synthesis and synchronizes the cells at the G1/S phase, and 2) IL-3 deprivation, which causes the cells to arrest at the G0 phase(34.Furukawa Y. Uenoyama S. Ohta M. Tsunoda A. Griffin J.D. Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17121-17127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46.Smith P.J. Paterson M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 739: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Synchronized cells were analyzed by FACS at different time points. Aphidicolin-synchronized 32D-123 cells were arrested at the G1/S boundary (61.7%) and showed continuous cell cycle progression upon release from the block (Fig. 1A). IL-3-deprived cells were arrested at the G0 cell cycle phase (73.3%, Fig. 1B). The aphidicolin- treated cells were better at defining the phases of the cell cycle, as indicated in Fig. 1A. However, IL-3-deprived cells were found to have a longer G1 phase (0-16 h, Fig. 1B), which allowed a more accurate determination of the optimal time for TGF-β1 regulation of cell growth. To determine the optimal time point for TGF-β1 treatment (maximal growth inhibition) and because 32D-123 cells require 12 h to complete the cell cycle following aphidicolin treatment (Fig. 1A), at 2-h intervals (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 h) after aphidicolin treatment cells were treated with TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml), and proliferation was analyzed by [3H]thymidine incorporation. As shown in Fig. 1C using aphidicolin-treated cells maximal inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporation (45%) was observed by 8 h. Table 1 shows the FACS analysis of cells treated in the presence and absence of TGF-β1 at 8 h after aphidicolin treatment. By 24 h after TGF-β1 treatment 64% of the cells arrested in the G1 phase (control 39.6%, Table 1). Longer incubation times in the presence of TGF-β1 increased the number of cells arrested in G1 (data not shown). In Fig. 1C time zero refers to the addition of aphidicolin. There was no significant inhibition of 32D-123 cell proliferation when TGF-β1 was added after 12 h of aphidicolin treatment because the cells are at the G1/S restriction point (as indicated in Fig. 1A). 32D-123 cell growth inhibition was seen at 8 h, when a significant number of cells are found in the G1 phase (a point of the cell cycle when they are most sensitive to TGF-β1) moving toward the restriction point(34.Furukawa Y. Uenoyama S. Ohta M. Tsunoda A. Griffin J.D. Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17121-17127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At earlier time points low levels of inhibition are seen because of the lack of synchronization of the cells. Therefore, the following TGF-β1 studies were done with cells treated with aphidicolin for 12 h. TGF-β1 was added to the cells 8 h after the initial treatment with aphidicolin, for a total of 24 h. Aphidicolin and TGF-β1 treatment overlapped only for a period of 4 h.Tabled 1 IL-3-deprived cells were treated with IL-3 and serum followed by TGF-β1 treatment (for a total of 24 h) at 2-h intervals (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 h). Maximal inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporation (76%) was observed when 32D-123 cells were treated with TGF-β1 at 6 h after IL-3 addition (Fig. 1D). Lower levels of 32D-123 growth inhibition by TGF-β1 treatment at 2 and 4 h following IL-3 addition were not unexpected. Most, if not all growth factors up-regulate TGF-β cell surface receptors(45.Birchenall-Roberts M.C. Falk L.A. Kasper J. Keller J. Faltynek C.R. Ruscetti F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9617-9621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47.Sporn M. Roberts A.B. Wakefield L. de Crombrugghe B. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1039-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar), and previous studies by our laboratory have indicated the expression of a low number of TGF-β receptors in the 32D-123 cells(45.Birchenall-Roberts M.C. Falk L.A. Kasper J. Keller J. Faltynek C.R. Ruscetti F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9617-9621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specifically, TGF-β ligand binding studies previously indicated the absence of TGF-β1 receptors in IL-3-deprived cells (data not shown). However, whether low or high number of receptors are bound by TGF-β1 ligand followed by internalization, the reappearance of the TGF-β receptors in the outer cell membrane only occurs 72 h later(45.Birchenall-Roberts M.C. Falk L.A. Kasper J. Keller J. Faltynek C.R. Ruscetti F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9617-9621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, since inhibition of proliferation by TGF-β1 occurs only after threshold levels of the intracellular regulators are reached, 6 h after IL-3 addition is when maximal expression/internalization of receptor-ligand complexes of TGF-β takes place. The TGF-β1-induced maximum growth inhibition of IL-3-deprived cells at 6 h indicated optimal expression of cell surface TGF-β receptors. FACS analysis of these cells identified that by 14 h, 64.3% of the cells were growth arrested at the G1 phase (Table 2). This FACS analysis confirms our earlier observation"

https://openalex.org/W1977476220,"Using hemimethylated, fully methylated, and unmethylated oligonucleotide probes corresponding to part of the origin of Escherichia coli DNA replication, oriC (+81-136), we have characterized a novel hemimethylated DNA-specific protein binding activity. This activity appears to be located in the cytoplasm rather than in membrane fractions. It has been partially purified and, in DNase footprinting analysis, found to preferentially protect only a subset of the hemimethylated GATC sites present in the minimal oriC. These sites are found adjacent to the DnaA binding box, R1, and overlap the integration host factor binding site. The activity does not correspond to known hemimethylated binding proteins, although in the seqA deletion mutant, there is a 3-fold reduction of the activity. The stage of the cell cycle in synchronized PC2 cultures does not seem to significantly affect the relative levels of this binding activity.

A possible role in sequestration of the newly replicated hemimethylated origin is discussed. The Escherichia coli Dam methyltransferase methylates the adenine residue in its recognition sequence 5′-GATC. When replicated, fully methylated DNA becomes temporarily hemimethylated, providing the cell with a molecular monitor for newly synthesized DNA. As such, the Dam system is potentially a means of ensuring that all replication origins in an individual cell initiate once before any origin can be reinitiated a second time(1.Messer W. Bellekes U. Lother H. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1327-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 2.Messer W. Noyer-Weidner M. Cell. 1988; 54: 735-737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Dam methylation also plays a major role in cellular repair processes (mismatch-repair) (3.Modrich P. Science. 1994; 266: 1959-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) and is involved in the regulation of various promoters. The clustering of Dam sites and their positional conservation among enterobacterial replication origins suggests that Dam methylation has a role in replication control. The minimal DNA segment that promotes autonomous replication in E. coli has been found to be contained in a segment of 245 base pairs (the minimal oriC from +11 to +256), a sequence containing 11 GATC sites(4.Oka A. Sugimoto K. Takanami M. Hirota Y. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1980; 178: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 5.Zyskind J.W. Smith D.W. Cell. 1986; 46: 489-490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Protein factors have been found in membrane-rich extracts that are capable of recognizing the oriC DNA in the hemimethylated rather than the fully methylated or unmethylated state(6.Chakraborti A.

It has been proposed that such hemimethylated DNA binding activity serves to prevent the Dam methyltransferase from remethylating newly synthesized hemimethylated DNA and that such a “sequestration” of the origin of replication in its hemimethylated form delays the reinitiation of chromosome and minichromosome DNA replication, thus playing a temporal regulatory role in the bacterial cell cycle(10.Boye E. Lobner-Olesen A. Cell. 1990; 62: 981-989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 11.Campbell J.L. Kleckner N.

Two genes whose proteins appear to be involved in such a hemimethylated DNA sequestration process are seqA(15.Lu M. Campbell J.L. Boye E. Kleckner N. Cell. 1994; 77: 413-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) and hobH(16.Herrick J. Kern R. Guha S. Landoulsi A. Fayet O. Malki A. Kohiyama M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4695-4703Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). While it has been proposed that SeqA is involved in a sequestration step that precedes sequestration into the membrane, HobH apparently binds preferentially to the methylated, parental strand at specific sites in the hemimethylated oriC sequence. Footprinting studies of the oriC region (from −46 to +244) in the hemimethylated state have indicated that there is differential protection by membrane-rich protein extracts of the 11 GATC methylation sites present in this segment, with the strongest binding detected in the two regions covering bases +90-110 and +120-130, sites to which the HobH fusion protein also appears to have higher affinity(16.Herrick J. Kern R. Guha S. Landoulsi A. Fayet O. Malki A. Kohiyama M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4695-4703Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In this study we present a more detailed investigation of the hemimethylated DNA-specific protein interactions with this region, employing an oligonucleotide probe and a gel retardation assay.

Marinus; himA::Tn10 (RY826) and hip (himD)::Tn5 (RY827) were a gift from J. Rouvière-Yaniv. Membrane-rich and cytoplasmic fractions were obtained from synchronized cultures of PC2 as described previously (9.Ogden G.B. Pratt M.J. Schaechter M. Cell. 1988; 54: 127-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Briefly, chilled cells were resuspended in 10 mM HEPES, pH7.4, 10 mM EDTA and broken by passage through a French pressure cell (25,000 p.s.i.). Any remaining intact cells were removed by low speed centrifugation before layering the lysate over a 60% sucrose shelf onto which total membrane material banded following ultracentrifugation at 45,000 rpm (110,000 × g) for 1 h at 4°C. Further fractionation of this band was accomplished by centrifugation (35,000 rpm (81,000 × g) for 2.5 h at 4°C) through a 30-50% (w/w) linear sucrose gradient with a 60% sucrose shelf in HKE buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA). Freeze-thaw lysis entailed resuspending the cells in HE buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA) with egg white lysozyme (100 μg/ml or 1 mg/g of cells) and incubating on ice for 1 h before freezing the mixture at −80°C and lysing the cells by thawing at 37°C for 5 min. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (48.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (207714) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides were synthesized using an Applied Biosystems synthesizer model 392 with incorporation of N6-methyl deoxyadenosine phosphoramidite (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) at the GATC sites to give the methylated strands. Double-stranded oligonucleotides were generated by hybridizing equal amounts of the complementary single strands in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA (heating at 100°C for 2 min and then leaving the solution to cool to room temperature). These were then radioactively labeled by phosphorylation of the 5′-unphosphorylated ends with T4 polynucleotide kinase, [γ-32P]ATP in 70 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM dithiothreitol, incubating at 37°C for 30 min. Unincorporated radioactivity was removed by passing the oligonucleotide through a Sephadex-50 column (Pharmacia). Protein extract was mixed with double-stranded radioactive oligonucleotide (1 × 10-10M) in binding buffer (6% glycerol, 25 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA) with boiled, sonicated calf thymus DNA as nonspecific competitor (typically 20 μg/ml or 5000-fold molar excess relative to the probe). The final reaction volume was 20 μl. For specific competition experiments, an excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide was added prior to the addition of the protein extract. Binding reactions were assembled and incubated at room temperature (25°C) for 20 min before loading onto native 5% 0.5 × TBE polyacrylamide gels (29:1 acrylamide:bis-acrylamide). Gels were migrated at room temperature at 100 V constant. Gels were dried and autoradiographed with x-ray film (Fuji RX) preflashed with the Amersham Sensitizer Flash unit according to the manufacturer's instructions, such that the film's exposure could be quantified as a linear function of the amount of radioactivity. The autoradiographs were scanned using an Apple One Scanner (Apple) and the Ofoto program (Light Source Computer Images Inc.). The densitometric analysis of the scans was accomplished using the program NIH Image (Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health). The total bound hemimethylated oligonucleotide in complexes 1 and 2 was measured under binding conditions in which only these complexes were formed with the probe (i.e. 1 × 10-10M probe in the presence of 5000-fold nonspecific competitor DNA). Preliminary experiments indicated that variations in the levels of total bound oligonucleotide were directly proportional to the amount of extract added. Fractions were measured at equivalent subsaturating protein concentrations (25 μg/ml), and results between experiments were standardized by measurement of the corresponding areas on control lanes without extract and with 25 μg/ml of membrane extract. Bacteria were lysed by freeze-thaw lysis in HE buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA), and the debris was removed by low speed centrifugation. NaCl was added to a final concentration of 350 mM, and the lysate was loaded onto a BioRex A-70 (Bio-Rad) column pre-equilibrated in HE/350 mM NaCl. After the column was washed with 10 column volumes, it was then stepped with HE/800 mM NaCl. The resulting eluate was diluted to 200 mM NaCl with HE and then loaded onto and eluted from a column of SP-Sepharose (Pharmacia) with a 200-600 mM NaCl gradient (10 column volumes), using a Waters 650 Advanced Protein Purification System (fast protein liquid chromatography). The protein composition was analyzed by electrophoresis in a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, staining with Coomassie Blue. The DNase footprinting reaction and the preparation of the hemimethylated and methylated oriC probes were performed as described previously(16.Herrick J. Kern R. Guha S. Landoulsi A. Fayet O. Malki A. Kohiyama M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4695-4703Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, peak 1 protein was preincubated with the probe for 10 min at 37°C before a limited digestion of the protein-DNA mixture by DNase. This was then deproteinized, and the digested DNA preparations were separated by electrophoresis through 8% denaturing (7 M urea) polyacrylamide gels. The protection of hemimethylated oriC from DNase digestion was observed from around 150 μg/ml of membrane extract(16.Herrick J. Kern R. Guha S. Landoulsi A. Fayet O. Malki A. Kohiyama M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4695-4703Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Employing a similar concentration of this membrane extract in a gel retardation assay with the hemimethylated oriC probe, we observed a single major complex, which upon reduction of the membrane concentration (to 25 μg/ml) could be resolved into six or seven retarded complexes (see Fig. 2a). In order to simplify our analysis of the protein-DNA interactions with the hemimethylated oriC, we decided to employ probes corresponding to just the most strongly protected region. Hence we synthesized oligonucleotides for the DNA sequence from +81 to +136 of the replication origin that possess either unmethylated or N6-methyl adenine residues at the three GATC positions located at 93, 107, and 125 (Fig. 1). By combining the resulting four single-stranded oligonucleotides in their complementary hybrid forms we could readily obtain double-stranded 56-mers in the unmethylated, fully methylated, and two hemimethylated states. With these probes we conducted a series of gel retardation experiments, seeking to elucidate further the methylation state-sensitive nature of the protein-DNA interactions with this region. In our initial studies with the oligonucleotide probes, employing a concentration of 1 × 10-9M in the binding reaction, with 100 μg/ml of membrane extract and a 600-fold excess of nonspecific DNA, we observed the formation of three complexes with the hemimethylated oligonucleotides but only a single complex with both the unmethylated and fully methylated probes (Fig. 2b). Specific competition with a 100-fold excess of each of the oligonucleotides under these conditions reveals that complexes 1 and 2, which are only formed with the hemimethylated probes, are also only competed by these hemimethylated forms, while complex 3, which co-migrates with that formed with the unmethylated and fully methylated probes is competed by all four oligonucleotides (Fig. 2b), suggesting that complexes 1 and 2 are only specific for the hemimethylated state of this sequence, while complex 3 is formed by a specific interaction with this sequence, which is not dependent upon the methylation status of the three GATC sites that it contains. We further found that the hemimethylated DNA-specific complexes, 1 and 2, were of a much higher affinity than complex 3 since we could effectively prevent the formation of complex 3 by increasing the stringency of the binding conditions. Thus, through lowering the probe concentration (to 1 × 10-10M) and increasing the relative excess of nonspecific DNA (to 5000-fold), only the complexes 1 and 2 were formed. In addition, under these conditions, we found that by varying the extract concentration over a large range, we observed the formation of complex 1 at a lower protein concentration than complex 2, suggesting that the former results from a stronger protein-DNA interaction (Fig. 2c). In order to further characterize the specificity of the protein interactions in these two retardation complexes we tested the effect upon the formation of the complexes of competition with an increasing excess of each of the unlabeled oligonucleotides present in the reaction mixture prior to the addition of the protein extract, finding that whereas both complexes were strongly competed by as little as a 10-fold excess of either of the hemimethylated oligonucleotides, neither of them was significantly competed by even a 1000-fold excess of either the unmethylated or fully methylated probes (Fig. 3). There are a number of possible explanations for the presence of two complexes with a specificity for the hemimethylated probes. They might arise as a result of two completely independent interactions with the oligonucleotide by two different protein species. Alternatively, there may be protein components common to the two complexes, or indeed both complexes may be due to multiple binding interactions by the same species. It is possible that the formation of complex 2 is related to complex 1 since we do not observe its formation independently of the latter despite extensive fractionation of the bacterial lysate (see below). As such it might result from cooperative interactions between proteins bound at different sites on the oligonucleotide. With three GATC sites available in this probe for hemimethylated specific binding, the formation of a third complex might be predicted. However, although DNase footprinting indicates that all three sites are protected at extract concentrations that give both retarded complexes in mobility shift assays, we do not observe a third complex. Perhaps one of the two complexes involves an interaction at more than one GATC site; for example, complex 1 might represent two bound sites, while complex 2 represents additional binding at the remaining GATC. In order to determine if these complexes arose from interactions with more than one protein species, we assayed the activity in different lysate fractions as a preliminary step to its purification. Previous studies have indicated that there is a hemimethylated oriC-specific binding activity associated with the bacterial membrane(6.Chakraborti A. Gunji S. Shakibal N. Cubeddu J. Rothfield L.

Cell. 1990; 63: 1053-1060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and since we have characterized such an activity in a membrane extract with our oligonucleotides, we sought to confirm the relative localization of our activity within the bacterial membrane. Several techniques are available for the fractionation and isolation of the membranous components of the cell envelope of Gram-negative bacteria, almost all based on density gradient centrifugation of disrupted cells (21.Ishidate K.

Acta. 1975; 406: 36-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Many studies of oriC membrane-associated interactions have employed such a preparative procedure, fractionating the lysates obtained after passage through a French pressure cell by ultracentrifugation of sucrose gradients(6.Chakraborti A.

Cell. 1990; 63: 1053-1060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Origin DNA has been found in membrane fractions that were prepared in this manner, but its presence seems to vary according to the initiation potential of the cell as shown by the use of synchronized cultures of initiation mutants(19.Nagai K. Hendrickson W. Balakrishnan R. Yamaki H. Boyd D. Schaechter M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 262-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 23.Gayama S. Kataoka T. Washi M. Tamura G. Nagai K. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3761-3765Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Hence, these studies have also employed synchronized cultures of the thermosensitive dnaC mutant, PC2(17.Carl P.L. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1970; 109: 107-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), in which, at the nonpermissive growth temperature (>37°C), new rounds of initiation of DNA replication are blocked while those that have begun continue until terminated; by bringing a culture of PC2 back to the permissive temperature (<36°C) after 1 h at the nonpermissive temperature there is a synchronized reinitiation of all origins in the culture(24.Marsh R.C. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1978; 166: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). To localize the distribution of the hemimethylated binding activity further, we assayed it in fractions obtained from the initial centrifugation of the lysate over a 60% sucrose bed, which results in the banding of the total membrane material on the bed(21.Ishidate K. Creeger E.S. Zrike J. Deb S. Glauner B. MacAlister T.J. Rothfield L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 428-443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All of the cultures assayed gave roughly the same levels of specific binding for the hemimethylated oligonucleotide probe (Fig. 4a). In addition, we found that, although the distribution of the total hemimethylated binding activity in the first sedimentation gradient was skewed toward the total membrane fraction, its levels were only around twice those found in the cytoplasmic fractions taken from the top and middle of the gradient, representing around a quarter of the total activity in the initial unfractionated lysate (Fig. 4b). Further fractionation of the total membrane into outer, inner, and intermembrane fractions using a 30-60% sucrose gradient did not result in any further enriched peak of activity for either complex (data not shown). To test the possibility that lysing the bacteria under high pressure with the French press had dissociated the activity from the membrane structure, we compared this lysis procedure with the less physically disruptive “freeze-thaw” technique. However, lysate fractions obtained by these methods from identical cultures exhibited a similar level and distribution of the hemimethylated binding activity (data not shown). This apparent absence of any large, or majority, peak of specific binding for the hemimethylated probe in the total, crude membrane fraction relative to the other lysate fractions would seem to contrast with the result expected for an activity that is directly associated with the membrane components. There are a number of known proteins that might be responsible for the hemimethylated binding activity we observe. These include the Dam methylase, which recognizes and subsequently methylates the hemimethylated GATC sequences(2.Messer W. Noyer-Weidner M. Cell. 1988; 54: 735-737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), or MutH, one of the proteins involved in methyl-directed mismatch repair(25.Au K.G. Welsh K. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12142-12148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which also recognizes the hemimethylated GATC sequence. Yet lysates prepared from deletion mutants for these genes retained the same activity as the wild-type or PC2 lysates (data not shown). We also tested integration host factor (IHF) ( 1The abbreviation used is: IHFintegration host factor.) mutants (both himA- and himD-(hip)) since this protein has a characterized binding site in the midst of the oligonucleotide sequence (+98-123)(26.Polaczek P. New Biol. 1990; 2: 265-271PubMed Google Scholar), which contains the middle of the three GATC sequences, but once more we found wild-type activity levels (data not shown). integration host factor. There are also eight of nine residues of the DnaA box, R1, present in the probe's sequence (+80-88)(27.Fuller R.S. Funnell B.E. Kornberg A. Cell. 1984; 38: 889-900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 28.Schaeffer C. Messer W. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1991; 226: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 29.Yoshikawa H. Ogasawara N. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2589-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, since this well defined consensus sequence is at an extremity of the oligonucleotide and incomplete we would not expect it to be involved in this binding interaction, which, besides, is apparently associated with modification of the GATC sequences, the closest lying at +93-96. In addition, the binding of DnaA protein to oriC in vitro has already been shown to occur irrespective of the methylation state of the origin (20.Landoulsi A. Malki A. Kern R. Kohiyama M. Hughes P. Cell. 1990; 63: 1053-1060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and both in vivo(30.Samitt C.E. Hansen F.G. Miller J.F. Schaechter M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 989-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and in vitro DNase footprinting studies with DnaA protein (27.Fuller R.S. Funnell B.E. Kornberg A. Cell. 1984; 38: 889-900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 31.Hupp T.R. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol.

Biol. 1993; 233: 16-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) clearly show strong protection at the R1 box and not in the immediately flanking sequence. This is the opposite of the pattern observed with the hemimethylated oriC in which the R1 box is not protected despite strong footprinting of adjacent regions ((16.Herrick J. Kern R. Guha S. Landoulsi A. Fayet O. Malki A. Kohiyama M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4695-4703Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), Fig. 7). Nevertheless we tried to “supershift” our hemimethylated specific complexes by using an anti-DnaA polyclonal antiserum (33.Landoulsi A. Hughes P. Kern R. Kohiyama M. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1989; 216: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 34.Hansen F.G. Atlung T. Braun R.E. Wright A. Hughes P. Kohiyama M. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5194-5199Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) in our binding reaction, which at 1:100 dilution has already been shown to completely inhibit DnaA protein-dependent in vitro oriC plasmid replication(33.Landoulsi A. Hughes P. Kern R. Kohiyama M. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1989; 216: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, although we added large amounts of the antiserum (up to 1:20 dilution) to the reaction mixture prior to addition of the probe, we did not observe either a diminution or a shifting of the hemimethylated complexes, nor did the use of this antiserum inhibit the DNase footprinting pattern observed with the hemimethylated minimal oriC (data not shown). Thus, it seems unlikely that the DnaA protein is present in these complexes. More likely candidates are the proteins HobH (16.Herrick J. Kern R. Guha S. Landoulsi A. Fayet O. Malki A. Kohiyama M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4695-4703Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and SeqA(15.Lu M. Campbell J.L. Boye E. Kleckner N. Cell. 1994; 77: 413-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), both of which have been reported as being associated with hemimethylated oriC binding activity. We have prepared lysates from deletion mutants for both of these genes individually and in combination. Surprisingly, the absence of the hobH gene does not seem to have any discernible effect upon the hemimethylated binding activity, whether in the cytoplasmic or membrane-enriched fractions (data not shown). However, in the ΔseqA mutant the specific activity for both of the hemimethylated complexes is significantly lower than that observed with PC2 alone (Fig. 5a), neither complex being formed until higher extract concentrations, although the relative migration of the two retarded complexes is the same as in the wild type and complex 2 is still formed after complex 1. In addition, although the levels of the two complexes are only around a third of that found in the wild-type fractions, their relative distribution in both synchronized and nonsynchronized cultures is similar to that observed in the wild type (Fig. 5b). A further comparison of the lysates from ΔseqA and the double mutant, ΔseqAΔhobH, did not reveal any further differences in the levels of hemimethylated binding; hence, it would seem that the HobH protein is not responsible for the hemimethylated binding activity observed under these conditions for this particular oligonucleotide sequence, nor does its absence seem to have any indirect effect upon the levels of this activity. In the absence of a major enrichment of the binding activity in membrane fractions, we continued with a chromatographic separation of the total lysate, testing a range of chromatographic re"
