https://openalex.org/W2085029391,"After myelination, oligodendrocytes are able to survive without mitochondrial respiration, suggesting that they can switch to aerobic glycolysis and release lactate. In the central nervous system, the myelin sheath that insulates and protects the axon is produced by glial cells known as oligodendrocytes. A study of conditional mutant mice in which myelin-producing cells fail to assemble mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase complex IV shows, surprisingly, that the oligodendrocytes continued to support myelination in the absence of mitochondrial respiration. They seem to be able to switch to lactate-producing aerobic glycolysis. And because myelinated axons can utilize lactate when energy-deprived, this may be an extra means by which the oligodendrocytes support functioning axons. Oligodendrocytes, the myelin-forming glial cells of the central nervous system, maintain long-term axonal integrity1,2,3. However, the underlying support mechanisms are not understood4. Here we identify a metabolic component of axon–glia interactions by generating conditional Cox10 (protoheme IX farnesyltransferase) mutant mice, in which oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells fail to assemble stable mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (COX, also known as mitochondrial complex IV). In the peripheral nervous system, Cox10 conditional mutants exhibit severe neuropathy with dysmyelination, abnormal Remak bundles, muscle atrophy and paralysis. Notably, perturbing mitochondrial respiration did not cause glial cell death. In the adult central nervous system, we found no signs of demyelination, axonal degeneration or secondary inflammation. Unlike cultured oligodendrocytes, which are sensitive to COX inhibitors5, post-myelination oligodendrocytes survive well in the absence of COX activity. More importantly, by in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy, brain lactate concentrations in mutants were increased compared with controls, but were detectable only in mice exposed to volatile anaesthetics. This indicates that aerobic glycolysis products derived from oligodendrocytes are rapidly metabolized within white matter tracts. Because myelinated axons can use lactate when energy-deprived6, our findings suggest a model in which axon–glia metabolic coupling serves a physiological function."
https://openalex.org/W2031762899,"Human apolipoprotein E has three isoforms: APOE2, APOE3 and APOE4. APOE4 is a major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease and is associated with Down's syndrome dementia and poor neurological outcome after traumatic brain injury and haemorrhage. Neurovascular dysfunction is present in normal APOE4 carriers and individuals with APOE4-associated disorders. In mice, lack of Apoe leads to blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown, whereas APOE4 increases BBB susceptibility to injury. How APOE genotype affects brain microcirculation remains elusive. Using different APOE transgenic mice, including mice with ablation and/or inhibition of cyclophilin A (CypA), here we show that expression of APOE4 and lack of murine Apoe, but not APOE2 and APOE3, leads to BBB breakdown by activating a proinflammatory CypA-nuclear factor-κB-matrix-metalloproteinase-9 pathway in pericytes. This, in turn, leads to neuronal uptake of multiple blood-derived neurotoxic proteins, and microvascular and cerebral blood flow reductions. We show that the vascular defects in Apoe-deficient and APOE4-expressing mice precede neuronal dysfunction and can initiate neurodegenerative changes. Astrocyte-secreted APOE3, but not APOE4, suppressed the CypA-nuclear factor-κB-matrix-metalloproteinase-9 pathway in pericytes through a lipoprotein receptor. Our data suggest that CypA is a key target for treating APOE4-mediated neurovascular injury and the resulting neuronal dysfunction and degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2167636534,"Cellular life emerged ∼3.7 billion years ago. With scant exception, terrestrial organisms have evolved under predictable daily cycles owing to the Earth’s rotation. The advantage conferred on organisms that anticipate such environmental cycles has driven the evolution of endogenous circadian rhythms that tune internal physiology to external conditions. The molecular phylogeny of mechanisms driving these rhythms has been difficult to dissect because identified clock genes and proteins are not conserved across the domains of life: Bacteria, Archaea and Eukaryota. Here we show that oxidation–reduction cycles of peroxiredoxin proteins constitute a universal marker for circadian rhythms in all domains of life, by characterizing their oscillations in a variety of model organisms. Furthermore, we explore the interconnectivity between these metabolic cycles and transcription–translation feedback loops of the clockwork in each system. Our results suggest an intimate co-evolution of cellular timekeeping with redox homeostatic mechanisms after the Great Oxidation Event ∼2.5 billion years ago. Daily oxidation–reduction cycles of peroxiredoxin proteins are shown to be conserved in all domains of life, including Bacteria, Archaea and Eukaryota. Most living organisms possess an endogenous circadian clock that ties their metabolism to a 24-hour day–night cycle. 'Clock genes' have been studied in many organisms and their variety has encouraged the view that each clock evolved independently. But there is a unifying factor: a non-transcriptionally based form of circadian oscillation, involving the oxidation–reduction cycles of peroxiredoxin proteins, has been identified in human red blood cells and algae. This study demonstrates that these redox cycles are conserved in all domains of life, including Bacteria, Archaea and Eukaryota, pointing to the possibility that this type of cellular timekeeping has co-evolved with redox homeostatic mechanisms across organisms for billions of years. The link may go back 2.5 billion years, to the Great Oxidation Event that consigned anaerobic metabolism to the margins of evolutionary history."
https://openalex.org/W2149793889,"Melanoma is notable for its metastatic propensity, lethality in the advanced setting and association with ultraviolet exposure early in life. To obtain a comprehensive genomic view of melanoma in humans, we sequenced the genomes of 25 metastatic melanomas and matched germline DNA. A wide range of point mutation rates was observed: lowest in melanomas whose primaries arose on non-ultraviolet-exposed hairless skin of the extremities (3 and 14 per megabase (Mb) of genome), intermediate in those originating from hair-bearing skin of the trunk (5-55 per Mb), and highest in a patient with a documented history of chronic sun exposure (111 per Mb). Analysis of whole-genome sequence data identified PREX2 (phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent Rac exchange factor 2)--a PTEN-interacting protein and negative regulator of PTEN in breast cancer--as a significantly mutated gene with a mutation frequency of approximately 14% in an independent extension cohort of 107 human melanomas. PREX2 mutations are biologically relevant, as ectopic expression of mutant PREX2 accelerated tumour formation of immortalized human melanocytes in vivo. Thus, whole-genome sequencing of human melanoma tumours revealed genomic evidence of ultraviolet pathogenesis and discovered a new recurrently mutated gene in melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W2084771878,"A fundamental question in neuroscience is how entire neural circuits generate behaviour and adapt it to changes in sensory feedback. Here we use two-photon calcium imaging to record the activity of large populations of neurons at the cellular level, throughout the brain of larval zebrafish expressing a genetically encoded calcium sensor, while the paralysed animals interact fictively with a virtual environment and rapidly adapt their motor output to changes in visual feedback. We decompose the network dynamics involved in adaptive locomotion into four types of neuronal response properties, and provide anatomical maps of the corresponding sites. A subset of these signals occurred during behavioural adjustments and are candidates for the functional elements that drive motor learning. Lesions to the inferior olive indicate a specific functional role for olivocerebellar circuitry in adaptive locomotion. This study enables the analysis of brain-wide dynamics at single-cell resolution during behaviour. Neural activity is recorded at the cellular level, throughout the brain of larval zebrafish, while the animals interact with a virtual environment and adapt their motor output to changes in visual feedback; this is used to derive candidates of functional elements driving motor learning. Improvements in technology have allowed neuroscientists to dissect the relationship between behaviour and activity in specific neural circuits. However, in a model system such as the zebrafish, it is potentially possible to track neural activity in circuits on a much broader scale. Using a virtual-reality-based imaging system, Florian Engert and colleagues track the dynamics of adaptive locomotion at single-neuron resolution in navigating fish to derive candidates for functional elements that drive motor learning."
https://openalex.org/W1604221682,"Accumulation of prion protein during prion replication causes persistent translational repression of global protein synthesis, which is mediated by eIF2α-P and is associated with synaptic failure and neuronal loss in prion-diseased mice; promoting translational recovery in hippocampi of prion-infected mice is neuroprotective. Despite extensive research, the mechanisms leading to neuronal loss in neurodegenerative disease are still little understood, and no treatments or promising treatment strategies exist. Using prion-diseased mice as a model, this study demonstrates that the accumulation of misfolded prion protein during prion replication causes persistent translational repression of global protein synthesis. This is mediated by eIF2α-P and is associated with synaptic failure and neuronal loss in prion-diseased mice. Promoting translational recovery in the hippocampi of prion-infected mice is neuroprotective, suggesting that a generic approach involving the fine-tuning of protein synthesis may be worth pursuing in prion diseases, and perhaps in other neurodegenerative disorders involving protein misfolding. The mechanisms leading to neuronal death in neurodegenerative disease are poorly understood. Many of these disorders, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and prion diseases, are associated with the accumulation of misfolded disease-specific proteins. The unfolded protein response is a protective cellular mechanism triggered by rising levels of misfolded proteins. One arm of this pathway results in the transient shutdown of protein translation, through phosphorylation of the α-subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor, eIF2. Activation of the unfolded protein response and/or increased eIF2α-P levels are seen in patients with Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and prion diseases1,2,3,4, but how this links to neurodegeneration is unknown. Here we show that accumulation of prion protein during prion replication causes persistent translational repression of global protein synthesis by eIF2α-P, associated with synaptic failure and neuronal loss in prion-diseased mice. Further, we show that promoting translational recovery in hippocampi of prion-infected mice is neuroprotective. Overexpression of GADD34, a specific eIF2α-P phosphatase, as well as reduction of levels of prion protein by lentivirally mediated RNA interference, reduced eIF2α-P levels. As a result, both approaches restored vital translation rates during prion disease, rescuing synaptic deficits and neuronal loss, thereby significantly increasing survival. In contrast, salubrinal, an inhibitor of eIF2α-P dephosphorylation5, increased eIF2α-P levels, exacerbating neurotoxicity and significantly reducing survival in prion-diseased mice. Given the prevalence of protein misfolding and activation of the unfolded protein response in several neurodegenerative diseases, our results suggest that manipulation of common pathways such as translational control, rather than disease-specific approaches, may lead to new therapies preventing synaptic failure and neuronal loss across the spectrum of these disorders."

https://openalex.org/W1973453325,"Development of a human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-based therapy for type 1 diabetes will require the translation of proof-of-principle concepts into a scalable, controlled, and regulated cell manufacturing process. We have previously demonstrated that hESC can be directed to differentiate into pancreatic progenitors that mature into functional glucose-responsive, insulin-secreting cells in vivo. In this study we describe hESC expansion and banking methods and a suspension-based differentiation system, which together underpin an integrated scalable manufacturing process for producing pancreatic progenitors. This system has been optimized for the CyT49 cell line. Accordingly, qualified large-scale single-cell master and working cGMP cell banks of CyT49 have been generated to provide a virtually unlimited starting resource for manufacturing. Upon thaw from these banks, we expanded CyT49 for two weeks in an adherent culture format that achieves 50–100 fold expansion per week. Undifferentiated CyT49 were then aggregated into clusters in dynamic rotational suspension culture, followed by differentiation en masse for two weeks with a four-stage protocol. Numerous scaled differentiation runs generated reproducible and defined population compositions highly enriched for pancreatic cell lineages, as shown by examining mRNA expression at each stage of differentiation and flow cytometry of the final population. Islet-like tissue containing glucose-responsive, insulin-secreting cells was generated upon implantation into mice. By four- to five-months post-engraftment, mature neo-pancreatic tissue was sufficient to protect against streptozotocin (STZ)-induced hyperglycemia. In summary, we have developed a tractable manufacturing process for the generation of functional pancreatic progenitors from hESC on a scale amenable to clinical entry."

https://openalex.org/W1965913526,"The Earth has cooled over the past 4.5 billion years (Gyr) as a result of surface heat loss and declining radiogenic heat production. Igneous geochemistry has been used to understand how changing heat flux influenced Archaean geodynamics, but records of systematic geochemical evolution are complicated by heterogeneity of the rock record and uncertainties regarding selection and preservation bias. Here we apply statistical sampling techniques to a geochemical database of about 70,000 samples from the continental igneous rock record to produce a comprehensive record of secular geochemical evolution throughout Earth history. Consistent with secular mantle cooling, compatible and incompatible elements in basalts record gradually decreasing mantle melt fraction through time. Superimposed on this gradual evolution is a pervasive geochemical discontinuity occurring about 2.5 Gyr ago, involving substantial decreases in mantle melt fraction in basalts, and in indicators of deep crustal melting and fractionation, such as Na/K, Eu/Eu* (europium anomaly) and La/Yb ratios in felsic rocks. Along with an increase in preserved crustal thickness across the Archaean/Proterozoic boundary, these data are consistent with a model in which high-degree Archaean mantle melting produced a thick, mafic lower crust and consequent deep crustal delamination and melting--leading to abundant tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite magmatism and a thin preserved Archaean crust. The coincidence of the observed changes in geochemistry and crustal thickness with stepwise atmospheric oxidation at the end of the Archaean eon provides a significant temporal link between deep Earth geochemical processes and the rise of atmospheric oxygen on the Earth."
https://openalex.org/W2043985004,"The different hypotheses proposed to explain positive species richness-productivity relationships, i.e. selection effect and complementarity effect, imply that plant functional characteristics are at the core of a mechanistic understanding of biodiversity effects.We used two community-wide measures of plant functional composition, (1) community-weighted means of trait values (CWM) and (2) functional trait diversity based on Rao's quadratic diversity (FD(Q)) to predict biomass production and measures of biodiversity effects in experimental grasslands (Jena Experiment) with different species richness (2, 4, 8, 16 and 60) and different functional group number and composition (1 to 4; legumes, grasses, small herbs, tall herbs) four years after establishment. Functional trait composition had a larger predictive power for community biomass and measures of biodiversitity effects (40-82% of explained variation) than species richness per se (<1-13% of explained variation). CWM explained a larger amount of variation in community biomass (80%) and net biodiversity effects (70%) than FD(Q) (36 and 38% of explained variation respectively). FD(Q) explained similar proportions of variation in complementarity effects (24%, positive relationship) and selection effects (28%, negative relationship) as CWM (27% of explained variation for both complementarity and selection effects), but for all response variables the combination of CWM and FD(Q) led to significant model improvement compared to a separate consideration of different components of functional trait composition. Effects of FD(Q) were mainly attributable to diversity in nutrient acquisition and life-history strategies. The large spectrum of traits contributing to positive effects of CWM on biomass production and net biodiversity effects indicated that effects of dominant species were associated with different trait combinations.Our results suggest that the identification of relevant traits and the relative impacts of functional identity of dominant species and functional diversity are essential for a mechanistic understanding of the role of plant diversity for ecosystem processes such as aboveground biomass production."
https://openalex.org/W2027518719,"The microsporidium Nosema ceranae is a newly prevalent parasite of the European honey bee (Apis mellifera). Although this parasite is presently spreading across the world into its novel host, the mechanisms by it which affects the bees and how bees respond are not well understood. We therefore performed an extensive characterization of the parasite effects at the molecular level by using genetic and biochemical tools. The transcriptome modifications at the midgut level were characterized seven days post-infection with tiling microarrays. Then we tested the bee midgut response to infection by measuring activity of antioxidant and detoxification enzymes (superoxide dismutases, glutathione peroxidases, glutathione reductase, and glutathione-S-transferase). At the gene-expression level, the bee midgut responded to N. ceranae infection by an increase in oxidative stress concurrent with the generation of antioxidant enzymes, defense and protective response specifically observed in the gut of mammals and insects. However, at the enzymatic level, the protective response was not confirmed, with only glutathione-S-transferase exhibiting a higher activity in infected bees. The oxidative stress was associated with a higher transcription of sugar transporter in the gut. Finally, a dramatic effect of the microsporidia infection was the inhibition of genes involved in the homeostasis and renewal of intestinal tissues (Wnt signaling pathway), a phenomenon that was confirmed at the histological level. This tissue degeneration and prevention of gut epithelium renewal may explain early bee death. In conclusion, our integrated approach not only gives new insights into the pathological effects of N. ceranae and the bee gut response, but also demonstrate that the honey bee gut is an interesting model system for studying host defense responses."
https://openalex.org/W2069678357,"Laboratory surveillance systems for salmonellosis should ideally be based on the rapid serotyping and subtyping of isolates. However, current typing methods are limited in both speed and precision. Using 783 strains and isolates belonging to 130 serotypes, we show here that a new family of DNA repeats named CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) is highly polymorphic in Salmonella. We found that CRISPR polymorphism was strongly correlated with both serotype and multilocus sequence type. Furthermore, spacer microevolution discriminated between subtypes within prevalent serotypes, making it possible to carry out typing and subtyping in a single step. We developed a high-throughput subtyping assay for the most prevalent serotype, Typhimurium. An open web-accessible database was set up, providing a serotype/spacer dictionary and an international tool for strain tracking based on this innovative, powerful typing and subtyping tool."
https://openalex.org/W2001341063,"Proposed quantum networks require both a quantum interface between light and matter and the coherent control of quantum states. A quantum interface can be realized by entangling the state of a single photon with the state of an atomic or solid-state quantum memory, as demonstrated in recent experiments with trapped ions, neutral atoms, atomic ensembles, and nitrogen-vacancy spins. The entangling interaction couples an initial quantum memory state to two possible light-matter states, and the atomic level structure of the memory determines the available coupling paths. In previous work, these paths' transition parameters determine the phase and amplitude of the final entangled state, unless the memory is initially prepared in a superposition state, a step that requires coherent control. Here we report the fully tunable entanglement of a single 40Ca+ ion and the polarization state of a single photon within an optical resonator. Our method, based on a bichromatic, cavity-mediated Raman transition, allows us to select two coupling paths and adjust their relative phase and amplitude. The cavity setting enables intrinsically deterministic, high-fidelity generation of any two-qubit entangled state. This approach is applicable to a broad range of candidate systems and thus presents itself as a promising method for distributing information within quantum networks."
https://openalex.org/W2131981901,"Specialized metabolic enzymes biosynthesize chemicals of ecological importance, often sharing a pedigree with primary metabolic enzymes. However, the lineage of the enzyme chalcone isomerase (CHI) remained unknown. In vascular plants, CHI-catalysed conversion of chalcones to chiral (S)-flavanones is a committed step in the production of plant flavonoids, compounds that contribute to attraction, defence and development. CHI operates near the diffusion limit with stereospecific control. Although associated primarily with plants, the CHI fold occurs in several other eukaryotic lineages and in some bacteria. Here we report crystal structures, ligand-binding properties and in vivo functional characterization of a non-catalytic CHI-fold family from plants. Arabidopsis thaliana contains five actively transcribed genes encoding CHI-fold proteins, three of which additionally encode amino-terminal chloroplast-transit sequences. These three CHI-fold proteins localize to plastids, the site of de novo fatty-acid biosynthesis in plant cells. Furthermore, their expression profiles correlate with those of core fatty-acid biosynthetic enzymes, with maximal expression occurring in seeds and coinciding with increased fatty-acid storage in the developing embryo. In vitro, these proteins are fatty-acid-binding proteins (FAPs). FAP knockout A. thaliana plants show elevated α-linolenic acid levels and marked reproductive defects, including aberrant seed formation. Notably, the FAP discovery defines the adaptive evolution of a stereospecific and catalytically 'perfected' enzyme from a non-enzymatic ancestor over a defined period of plant evolution."

https://openalex.org/W2010231082,"Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) metastasis portends a poor prognosis and cannot be reliably predicted. Early determination of the metastatic potential of RCC may help guide proper treatment. We analyzed microRNA (miRNA) expression in clear cell RCC (ccRCC) for the purpose of developing a miRNA expression signature to determine the risk of metastasis and prognosis. We used the microarray technology to profile miRNA expression of 78 benign kidney and ccRCC samples. Using 28 localized and metastatic ccRCC specimens as the training cohort and the univariate logistic regression and risk score methods, we developed a miRNA signature model in which the expression levels of miR-10b, miR-139-5p, miR-130b and miR-199b-5p were used to determine the status of ccRCC metastasis. We validated the signature in an independent 40-sample testing cohort of different stages of primary ccRCCs using the microarray data. Within the testing cohort patients who had at least 5 years follow-up if no metastasis developed, the signature showed a high sensitivity and specificity. The risk status was proven to be associated with the cancer-specific survival. Using the most stably expressed miRNA among benign and tumorous kidney tissue as the internal reference for normalization, we successfully converted his signature to be a quantitative PCR (qPCR)-based assay, which showed the same high sensitivity and specificity. The 4-miRNA is associated with ccRCC metastasis and prognosis. The signature is ready for and will benefit from further large clinical cohort validation and has the potential for clinical application."

https://openalex.org/W2040473545,"First, our objective was to estimate socio-economic inequalities in the use of postnatal care (PNC) compared with those in the use of care at birth and antenatal care. Second, we wanted to compare inequalities in the use of PNC between facility births and home births and to determine inequalities in the use of PNC among mothers with high-risk births.Rich-poor ratios and concentration indices for maternity care were estimated using the third round of the District Level Household Survey conducted in India in 2007-08. Binary logistic regression models were used to examine the socio-economic inequalities associated with use of PNC after adjusting for relevant socio-economic and demographic characteristics. PNC for both mothers and newborns was substantially lower than the care received during pregnancy and child birth. Only 44% of mothers in India at the time of survey received any care within 48 hours after birth. Likewise, only 45% of newborns received check-up within 24 hours of birth. Mothers who had home births were significantly less likely to have received PNC than those who had facility births, with significant differences across the socio-economic strata. Moreover, the rich-poor gap in PNC use was significantly wider for mothers with birth complications.PNC use has been unacceptably low in India given the risks of mortality for mothers and babies shortly after birth. However, there is evidence to suggest that effective use of pregnancy and childbirth care in health facilities led to better PNC. There are also significant socio-economic inequalities in access to PNC even for those accessing facility-based care. The coverage of essential PNC is inadequate, especially for mothers from economically disadvantaged households. The findings suggest the need for strengthening PNC services to keep pace with advances in coverage for care at birth and prenatal services in India through targeted policy interventions."

This report used the delayed implantation model to determine the role of miRNAs in blastocysts. Dormant blastocysts in delayed implanting mice were activated by estradiol. Differential expression of 45 out of 238 miRNAs examined was found between the dormant and the activated blastocysts. Five of the nine members of the microRNA lethal-7 (let-7) family were down-regulated after activation. Human blastocysts also had a low expression of let-7 family. Forced-expression of a family member, let-7a in mouse blastocysts decreased the number of implantation sites (let-7a: 1.1±0.4; control: 3.8±0.4) in vivo, and reduced the percentages of blastocyst that attached (let-7a: 42.0±8.3%; control: 79.0±5.1%) and spreaded (let-7a: 33.5±2.9%; control: 67.3±3.8%) on fibronectin in vitro. Integrin-β3, a known implantation-related molecule, was demonstrated to be a target of let-7a by 3′-untranslated region reporter assay in cervical cancer cells HeLa, and Western blotting in mouse blastocysts. The inhibitory effect of forced-expression of let-7a on blastocyst attachment and outgrowth was partially nullified in vitro and in vivo by forced-expression of integrin-β3. This study provides the first direct evidence that let-7a is involved in regulating the implantation process partly via modulation of the expression of integrin-β3. (200 words)."

https://openalex.org/W2019481782,"Pathogenic mycobacteria survive within macrophages by residing in phagosomes, which they prevent from maturing and fusing with lysosomes. Although several bacterial components were seen to modulate phagosome processing, the molecular regulatory mechanisms taking part in this process remain elusive. We investigated whether the phagosome maturation block (PMB) could be modulated by signaling through Ser/Thr phosphorylation. Here, we demonstrated that mycolic acid cyclopropane synthase PcaA, but not MmaA2, was phosphorylated by mycobacterial Ser/Thr kinases at Thr-168 and Thr-183 both in vitro and in mycobacteria. Phosphorylation of PcaA was associated with a significant decrease in the methyltransferase activity, in agreement with the strategic structural localization of these two phosphoacceptors. Using a BCG ΔpcaA mutant, we showed that PcaA was required for intracellular survival and prevention of phagosome maturation in human monocyte-derived macrophages. The physiological relevance of PcaA phosphorylation was further assessed by generating PcaA phosphoablative (T168A/T183A) or phosphomimetic (T168D/T183D) mutants. In contrast to the wild-type and phosphoablative pcaA alleles, introduction of the phosphomimetic pcaA allele in the ΔpcaA mutant failed to restore the parental mycolic acid profile and cording morphotype. Importantly, the PcaA phosphomimetic strain, as the ΔpcaA mutant, exhibited reduced survival in human macrophages and was unable to prevent phagosome maturation. Our results add new insight into the importance of mycolic acid cyclopropane rings in the PMB and provide the first evidence of a Ser/Thr kinase-dependent mechanism for modulating mycolic acid composition and PMB."
https://openalex.org/W2037056852,"Obesity is a complex, multifactorial disorder influenced by the interaction of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors. Obesity increases the risk of contracting many chronic diseases or metabolic syndrome. Researchers have established several mammalian models of obesity to study its underlying mechanism. However, a lower vertebrate model for conveniently performing drug screening against obesity remains elusive. The specific aim of this study was to create a zebrafish obesity model by over expressing the insulin signaling hub of the Akt1 gene.Skin oncogenic transformation screening shows that a stable zebrafish transgenic of Tg(krt4Hsa.myrAkt1)(cy18) displays severely obese phenotypes at the adult stage. In Tg(krt4:Hsa.myrAkt1)(cy18), the expression of exogenous human constitutively active Akt1 (myrAkt1) can activate endogenous downstream targets of mTOR, GSK-3α/β, and 70S6K. During the embryonic to larval transitory phase, the specific over expression of myrAkt1 in skin can promote hypertrophic and hyperplastic growth. From 21 hour post-fertilization (hpf) onwards, myrAkt1 transgene was ectopically expressed in several mesenchymal derived tissues. This may be the result of the integration position effect. Tg(krt4:Hsa.myrAkt1)(cy18) caused a rapid increase of body weight, hyperplastic growth of adipocytes, abnormal accumulation of fat tissues, and blood glucose intolerance at the adult stage. Real-time RT-PCR analysis showed the majority of key genes on regulating adipogenesis, adipocytokine, and inflammation are highly upregulated in Tg(krt4:Hsa.myrAkt1)(cy18). In contrast, the myogenesis- and skeletogenesis-related gene transcripts are significantly downregulated in Tg(krt4:Hsa.myrAkt1)(cy18), suggesting that excess adipocyte differentiation occurs at the expense of other mesenchymal derived tissues.Collectively, the findings of this study provide direct evidence that Akt1 signaling plays an important role in balancing normal levels of fat tissue in vivo. The obese zebrafish examined in this study could be a new powerful model to screen novel drugs for the treatment of human obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2059175414,"Bacterial cell-to-cell communication, termed quorum sensing (QS), controls bacterial behavior by using various signal molecules. Despite the fact that the LuxS/autoinducer-2 (AI-2) QS system is necessary for normal expression of Salmonella pathogenicity island-1 (SPI-1), the mechanism remains unknown. Here, we report that the LsrR protein, a transcriptional regulator known to be involved in LuxS/AI-2-mediated QS, is also associated with the regulation of SPI-1-mediated Salmonella virulence. We determined that LsrR negatively controls SPI-1 and flagella gene expressions. As phosphorylated AI-2 binds to and inactivates LsrR, LsrR remains active and decreases expression of SPI-1 and flagella genes in the luxS mutant. The reduced expression of those genes resulted in impaired invasion of Salmonella into epithelial cells. Expression of SPI-1 and flagella genes was also reduced by overexpression of the LsrR regulator from a plasmid, but was relieved by exogenous AI-2, which binds to and inactivates LsrR. These results imply that LsrR plays an important role in selecting infectious niche of Salmonella in QS dependent mode."
https://openalex.org/W2052132689,"Despite the benefits of estrogen receptor (ER)-targeted endocrine therapies in breast cancer, many tumors develop resistance. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been suggested as promising biomarkers and we here evaluated whether a miRNA profile could be identified, sub-grouping ER+ breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant Tamoxifen with regards to probability of recurrence.Global miRNA analysis was performed on 152 ER+ primary tumors from high-risk breast cancer patients with an initial discovery set of 52 patients, followed by two independent test sets (N = 60 and N = 40). All patients had received adjuvant Tamoxifen as mono-therapy (median clinical follow-up: 4.6 years) and half had developed distant recurrence (median time-to-recurrence: 3.5 years). MiRNA expression was examined by unsupervised hierarchical clustering and supervised analysis, including clinical parameters as co-variables.The discovery set identified 10 highly significant miRNAs that discriminated between the patient samples according to outcome. However, the subsequent two independent test sets did not confirm the predictive potential of these miRNAs. A significant correlation was identified between miR-7 and the tumor grade. Investigation of the microRNAs with the most variable expression between patients in different runs yielded a list of 31 microRNAs, eight of which are associated with stem cell characteristics.Based on the large sample size, our data strongly suggests that there is no single miRNA profile predictive of outcome following adjuvant Tamoxifen treatment in a broad cohort of ER+ breast cancer patients. We identified a sub-group of Tamoxifen-treated breast cancer patients with miRNA-expressing tumors associated with cancer stem cell characteristics."

We assessed the association between 10 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 5 MMR genes and oesophageal cancer risk in South Africans. Prior to genotyping, SNPs were selected from the HapMap database, based on their significantly different genotypic distributions between European ancestry populations and four HapMap populations of African origin. In the Mixed Ancestry group, the MSH3 rs26279 G/G versus A/A or A/G genotype was positively associated with cancer (OR = 2.71; 95% CI: 1.34–5.50). Similar associations were observed for PMS1 rs5742938 (GG versus AA or AG: OR = 1.73; 95% CI: 1.07–2.79) and MLH3 rs28756991 (AA or GA versus GG: OR = 2.07; 95% IC: 1.04–4.12). In Black individuals, however, no association between MMR polymorhisms and cancer risk was observed in individual SNP analysis. The interactions between MMR genes were evaluated using the model-based multifactor-dimensionality reduction approach, which showed a significant genetic interaction between SNPs in MSH2, MSH3 and PMS1 genes in Black and Mixed Ancestry subjects, respectively. The data also implies that pathogenesis of common polymorphisms in MMR genes is influenced by exposure to tobacco smoke. In conclusion, our findings suggest that common polymorphisms in MMR genes and/or their combined effects might be involved in the aetiology of oesophageal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2020725753,"Victims of Buruli ulcer disease (BUD) frequently report to specialized units at a late stage of the disease. This delay has been associated with local beliefs and a preference for traditional healing linked to a reportedly mystical origin of the disease. We assessed the role beliefs play in determining BUD sufferers' choice between traditional and biomedical treatments.Anthropological fieldwork was conducted in community and clinical settings in the region of Ayos and Akonolinga in Central Cameroon. The research design consisted of a mixed methods study, triangulating a qualitative strand based on ethnographic research and quantitative data obtained through a survey presented to all patients at the Ayos and Akonolinga hospitals (N = 79) at the time of study and in four endemic communities (N = 73) belonging to the hospitals' catchment area.The analysis of BUD sufferers' health-seeking behaviour showed extremely complex therapeutic itineraries, including various attempts and failures both in the biomedical and traditional fields. Contrary to expectations, nearly half of all hospital patients attributed their illness to mystical causes, while traditional healers admitted patients they perceived to be infected by natural causes. Moreover, both patients in hospitals and in communities often combined elements of both types of treatments. Ultimately, perceptions regarding the effectiveness of the treatment, the option for local treatment as a cost prevention strategy and the characteristics of the doctor-patient relationship were more determinant for treatment choice than beliefs.The ascription of delay and treatment choice to beliefs constitutes an over-simplification of BUD health-seeking behaviour and places the responsibility directly on the shoulders of BUD sufferers while potentially neglecting other structural elements. While more efficacious treatment in the biomedical sector is likely to reduce perceived mystical involvement in the disease, additional decentralization could constitute a key element to reduce delay and increase adherence to biomedical treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2061547680,"Background Possible single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) interactions in breast cancer are usually not investigated in genome-wide association studies. Previously, we proposed a particle swarm optimization (PSO) method to compute these kinds of SNP interactions. However, this PSO does not guarantee to find the best result in every implement, especially when high-dimensional data is investigated for SNP–SNP interactions. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we propose IPSO algorithm to improve the reliability of PSO for the identification of the best protective SNP barcodes (SNP combinations and genotypes with maximum difference between cases and controls) associated with breast cancer. SNP barcodes containing different numbers of SNPs were computed. The top five SNP barcode results are retained for computing the next SNP barcode with a one-SNP-increase for each processing step. Based on the simulated data for 23 SNPs of six steroid hormone metabolisms and signalling-related genes, the performance of our proposed IPSO algorithm is evaluated. Among 23 SNPs, 13 SNPs displayed significant odds ratio (OR) values (1.268 to 0.848; p<0.05) for breast cancer. Based on IPSO algorithm, the jointed effect in terms of SNP barcodes with two to seven SNPs show significantly decreasing OR values (0.84 to 0.57; p<0.05 to 0.001). Using PSO algorithm, two to four SNPs show significantly decreasing OR values (0.84 to 0.77; p<0.05 to 0.001). Based on the results of 20 simulations, medians of the maximum differences for each SNP barcode generated by IPSO are higher than by PSO. The interquartile ranges of the boxplot, as well as the upper and lower hinges for each n-SNP barcode (n = 3∼10) are more narrow in IPSO than in PSO, suggesting that IPSO is highly reliable for SNP barcode identification. Conclusions/Significance Overall, the proposed IPSO algorithm is robust to provide exact identification of the best protective SNP barcodes for breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2028382100,"Background Cerebellar cortical molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) play essential roles in sensory information processing by the cerebellar cortex. However, recent experimental and modeling results are questioning traditional roles for molecular layer inhibition in the cerebellum. Methods and Main Results Synaptic responses of MLIs and Purkinje cells (PCs), evoked by air-puff stimulation of the ipsilateral whisker pad were recorded from cerebellar cortex Crus II in urethane-anesthetized ICR mice by in vivo whole-cell patch-clamp recording techniques. Under current-clamp (I = 0), air-puff stimuli were found to primarily produce inhibition in PCs. In MLIs, this stimulus evoked spike firing regardless of whether they made basket-type synaptic connections or not. However, MLIs not making basket-type synaptic connections had higher rates of background activity and also generated spontaneous spike-lets. Under voltage-clamp conditions, excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were recorded in MLIs, although the predominant response of recorded PCs was an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP). The latencies of EPSCs were similar for all MLIs, but the time course and amplitude of EPSCs varied with depth in the molecular layer. The highest amplitude, shortest duration EPSCs were recorded from MLIs deep in the molecular layer, which also made basket-type synaptic connections. Comparing MLI to PC responses, time to peak of PC IPSP was significantly slower than MLI recorded EPSCs. Blocking GABAA receptors uncovered larger EPSCs in PCs whose time to peak, half-width and 10–90% rising time were also significantly slower than in MLIs. Biocytin labeling indicated that the MLIs (but not PCs) are dye-coupled. Conclusions These findings indicate that tactile face stimulation evokes rapid excitation in MLIs and inhibition occurring at later latencies in PCs in mouse cerebellar cortex Crus II. These results support previous suggestions that the lack of parallel fiber driven PC activity is due to the effect of MLI inhibition."

We report that isocorydine induces G2/M phase arrest by increasing cyclin B1 and p-CDK1 expression levels, which was caused by decreasing the expression and inhibiting the activation of Cdc25C. The phosphorylation levels of Chk1 and Chk2 were increased after ICD treatment. Furthermore, G2/M arrest induced by ICD can be disrupted by Chk1 siRNA but not by Chk2 siRNA. In addition, isocorydine treatment led to a decrease in the percentage of CD133+ PLC/PRF/5 cells. Interestingly, isocorydine treatment dramatically decreased the tumorigenicity of SMMC-7721 and Huh7 cells. These findings indicate that isocorydine might be a potential therapeutic drug for the chemotherapeutic treatment of HCC."

In Escherichia coli, the CRISPR-associated complex for antiviral defense (Cascade) utilizes these RNAs to target foreign DNA for destruction. CasA, the largest subunit of Cascade, is essential for its function. Here we report the crystal structure of Thermus thermophilus CasA. The structure is composed of two domains that are arranged in a chair-like conformation with a novel fold forming the larger N-terminal domain.

https://openalex.org/W2164789562,"A species' response to climate change depends on the interaction of biotic and abiotic factors that define future habitat suitability and species' ability to migrate or adapt. The interactive effects of processes such as fire, dispersal, and predation have not been thoroughly addressed in the climate change literature. Our objective was to examine how life history traits, short-term global change perturbations, and long-term climate change interact to affect the likely persistence of an oak species--Quercus engelmannii (Engelmann oak). Specifically, we combined dynamic species distribution models, which predict suitable habitat, with stochastic, stage-based metapopulation models, which project population trajectories, to evaluate the effects of three global change factors--climate change, land use change, and altered fire frequency--emphasizing the roles of dispersal and seed predation. Our model predicted dramatic reduction in Q. engelmannii abundance, especially under drier climates and increased fire frequency. When masting lowers seed predation rates, decreased masting frequency leads to large abundance decreases. Current rates of dispersal are not likely to prevent these effects, although increased dispersal could mitigate population declines. The results suggest that habitat suitability predictions by themselves may under-estimate the impact of climate change for other species and locations."
https://openalex.org/W2168823830,"Grb10 is an intracellular adaptor protein that acts as a negative regulator of insulin and insulinlike growth factor 1 (IGF1) receptors. Since global deletion of Grb10 in mice causes hypermuscularity, we have characterized the skeletal muscle physiology underlying this phenotype. Compared to wild-type (WT) controls, adult mice deficient in Grb10 have elevated body mass and muscle mass throughout adulthood, up to 12 mo of age. The muscle enlargement is not due to increased myofiber size, but rather an increase in myofiber number (142% of WT, P<0.01). There is no change in myofiber type proportions between WT and Grb10-deficient muscles, nor are the metabolic properties of the muscles altered on Grb10 deletion. Notably, the weight and cross-sectional area of hindlimbs from neonatal mice are increased in Grb10-deficient animals (198 and 137% of WT, respectively, both P<0.001). Functional gene signatures for myogenic signaling and proliferation are up-regulated in Grb10-deficient neonatal muscle. Our findings indicate that Grb10 plays a previously unrecognized role in regulating the development of fiber number during murine embryonic growth. In addition, Grb10-ablated muscle from adult mice shows coordinate gene changes that oppose those of muscle wasting pathologies, highlighting Grb10 as a potential therapeutic target for these conditions.— Holt, L.

To understand the potentially pathogenetic capacity and the genetic basis of MuH MRSA, it is important to have a detailed knowledge of the molecular traits of this organism. Fifty three MuH MRSA isolates were gathered from Shanghai (28 isolates) and Wenzhou (25 isolates) in China. These isolates, consisting of 27 different PFGE-SCCmec-spa patterns, were examined by PCR for 35 virulence genes and further typed using agr (accessory gene regulator) typing and MLST (multilocus sequence typing). All 53 strains were positive for the genes hlg/hlg variant and icaD, and negative for seb, sed, see, seh, eta, etb, hld, cap-5, and ACME-arcA. Compared with Wenzhou isolates, Shanghai isolates were more likely to carry seg (P = 0.002) and several other genes which were not found in Wenzhou strains such as sec, sei, tst (P<0.001 each), and pvl (P = 0.012), and less likely to contain sea (P<0.001), cna (P = 0.031), and efb (P = 0.045). MLST and agr typing showed that ST239-agr1, ST5-agr1, and ST239-agr2 were the common lineages in MuH MRSA isolates from these two different regions. Our results indicated that MuH MRSA strains from two different geographic regions of China have differences in distribution of some virulence genes, while their major MLST-agr genetic backgrounds were accordant."
https://openalex.org/W2037776522,"Cerebral edema, a well-known feature of acute liver disease, can occur in cirrhotic patients regardless of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and adversely affect prognosis. This study characterized and correlated functional HE abnormalities in the brain to cerebral edema using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Forty-one cirrhotic patients (16 without HE, 14 minimal HE, 11 overt HE) and 32 healthy controls were assessed. The HE grade in cirrhotic patients was evaluated by the West Haven criteria and neuro-psychological examinations. Functional connectivity correlation coefficient (fc-CC) of the default mode network (DMN) was determined by rs-fMRI, while the corresponding mean diffusivity (MD) was obtained from DTI. Correlations among inter-cortical fc-CC, DTI indices, Cognitive Ability Screening Instrument scores, and laboratory tests were also analyzed. Results showed that gradual reductions of HE-related consciousness levels, from “without HE” or “minimal HE” to “overt HE”, correlated with decreased anterior-posterior fc-CC in DMN [F(4.415), p = 0.000)]. The MD values from regions with anterior-posterior fc-CC differences in DMN revealed significant differences between the overt HE group and other groups. Increased MD in this network was inversely associated with decreased fc-CC in DMN and linearly correlated with poor cognitive performance. In conclusion, cerebral edema can be linked to altered cerebral temporal architecture that modifies both within- and between-network connectivity in HE. Reduced fc-CC in DMN is associated with behavior and consciousness deterioration. Through appropriate targets, rs-fMRI technology may provide relevant supplemental information for monitoring HE and serve as a new biomarker for clinical diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W1978667590,"Nidogen-1 and nidogen-2 are homologous proteins found in all basement membranes (BMs). They show comparable binding activities in vitro and partially redundant functions in vivo. Previously, we showed that in skin organotypic cocultures, BM formation was prevented in the absence of nidogens and that either nidogen was able to rescue this failure. We now dissected the two nidogens to identify the domains required for BM deposition. For that purpose, HaCaT cells were grown on collagen matrices containing nidogen-deficient, murine fibroblasts. After addition of nidogen-1 or nidogen-2 protein fragments comprising different binding domains, BM deposition was analyzed by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. We could demonstrate that the rod-G3 domain of nidogen-2 was sufficient to achieve deposition of BM components at the epidermal-collagen interface. In contrast, for nidogen-1, both the G2 and G3 domains were required. Immunoblot analysis confirmed that all BM components were present in comparable amounts under all culture conditions. This finding demonstrates that nidogens, although homologous proteins, exert their effect on BM assembly through different binding domains, which may in turn result in alterations of BM structure and functions, thus providing an explanation for the phenotypical differences observed between nidogen-1 and -2 deficient mice.—Bechtel, M., Keller, M.

Therefore, we hypothesize that the different fatty acid types treatment may affect the glucocorticoid induction of intramuscular lipid accumulation. Methodology/Principal Findings The effect of dexamethasone (DEX) on fatty acid metabolism and storage in skeletal muscle of broiler chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) was investigated with and without fatty acid treatments. Male Arbor Acres chickens (31 d old) were treated with either palmitic acid (PA) or oleic acid (OA) for 7 days, followed by DEX administration for 3 days (35–37 d old). The DEX-induced lipid uptake and oxidation imbalance, which was estimated by increased fatty acid transport protein 1 (FATP1) expression and decreased carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 activity, contributed to skeletal muscle lipid accumulation. More sensitive than glycolytic muscle, the oxidative muscle in DEX-treated chickens showed a decrease in the AMP to ATP ratio, a decrease in AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) alpha phosphorylation and its activity, as well as an increase in the phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and ribosomal p70S6 kinase, without Akt activation. DEX-stimulated lipid deposition was augmented by PA, but alleviated by OA, in response to pathways that were regulated differently, including AMPK, mTOR and FATP1. Conclusions DEX-induced intramuscular lipid accumulation was aggravated by SFA but alleviated by unsaturated fatty acid. The suppressed AMPK and augmented mTOR signaling pathways were involved in glucocortcoid-mediated enhanced intramuscular fat accumulation."

Although other generalizations of the normal distribution exist, we demonstrate a new alternative that apparently fits human longevity data better. We propose an alternative approach of a normal distribution whose scale parameter is conditioned on attained age. This approach is consistent with previous findings that longevity conditioned on survival to the modal age behaves like a normal distribution. We derive such a distribution and demonstrate its accuracy in modeling human longevity data from life tables. The new distribution is characterized by 1. An intuitively straightforward genesis; 2.

https://openalex.org/W2013594083,"Mammalian cell function requires timely and accurate transmission of information from the cell membrane (CM) to the nucleus (N). These pathways have been intensively investigated and many critical components and interactions have been identified. However, the physical forces that control movement of these proteins have received scant attention. Thus, transduction pathways are typically presented schematically with little regard to spatial constraints that might affect the underlying dynamics necessary for protein-protein interactions and molecular movement from the CM to the N. We propose messenger protein localization and movements are highly regulated and governed by Coulomb interactions between: 1. A recently discovered, radially directed E-field from the NM into the CM and 2. Net protein charge determined by its isoelectric point, phosphorylation state, and the cytosolic pH. These interactions, which are widely applied in elecrophoresis, provide a previously unknown mechanism for localization of messenger proteins within the cytoplasm as well as rapid shuttling between the CM and N. Here we show these dynamics optimize the speed, accuracy and efficiency of transduction pathways even allowing measurement of the location and timing of ligand binding at the CM –previously unknown components of intracellular information flow that are, nevertheless, likely necessary for detecting spatial gradients and temporal fluctuations in ligand concentrations within the environment. The model has been applied to the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway and scaffolding protein KSR1 using computer simulations and in-vitro experiments. The computer simulations predicted distinct distributions of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated components of this transduction pathway which were experimentally confirmed in normal breast epithelial cells (HMEC)."
https://openalex.org/W2144684493,"Taspase1 mediates cleavage of the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) protein and leukemia-provoking MLL fusions and promotes solid malignancies. Currently, no effective and specific Taspase1 inhibitors are available, precluding its therapeutic exploitation. As the Taspase1 proenzyme is autoproteolytically cleaved and assumed to assemble into an active αββα heterodimer, we attempted to interfere with its activity by targeting Taspase1′s dimerization. Notably, enforced expression of inactive Taspase1 mutants, aiming to inhibit formation of active protease dimers, was not inhibitory. Immunoprecipitation, gel filtration, and in vivo protein interaction assays revealed that active Taspase1 exists predominantly as an αβ monomer in living cells, providing an explanation why overexpression of inactive mutants was not trans-dominant. To alternatively test the biological consequences of enforced dimerization, we engineered Taspase1 variants containing the Jun/Fos dimerization motif. In absence of the respective interaction partners, the protease fusions were fully active, while enforcing dimerization by coexpression significantly inhibited processing of several target proteins in living cells. Our study provides the first evidence that Taspase1 is already active as an αβ monomer, arguing against heterocomplex formation being required for its pathobiological activity. Thus, it clearly supports strategies aiming to inhibit the cancer-promoting activity of Taspase1 by the identification of chemical decoys enforcing its dimerization.—Bier, C., Knauer, S.

The GTPases encoded by the nuclear MTG1 and MTG2 genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been reported to play a role in assembly of the ribosomal 54 S subunit. In the present study biochemical screens of a collection of respiratory deficient yeast mutants have enabled us to identify a third gene essential for expression of mitochondrial ribosomes. This gene codes for a member of the YqeH family of GTPases, which we have named MTG3 in keeping with the earlier convention. Mutations in MTG3 cause the accumulation of the 15 S rRNA precursor, previously shown to have an 80-nucleotide 5' extension. Sucrose gradient sedimentation of mitochondrial ribosomes from temperature-sensitive mtg3 mutants grown at the permissive and restrictive temperatures, combined with immunobloting with subunit-specific antibodies, indicate that Mtg3p is required for assembly of the 30 S but not 54 S ribosomal subunit. The respiratory deficient growth phenotype of an mtg3 null mutant is partially rescued by overexpression of the Mrpl4p constituent located at the peptide exit site of the 54 S subunit. The rescue is accompanied by an increase in processed 15 S rRNA. This suggests that Mtg3p and Mrpl4p jointly regulate assembly of the small subunit by modulating processing of the 15 S rRNA precursor."

In the present study, we establish a new gene therapy model using a genetically modified adenovirus, referred to as Ad.TERT.Tβ(10), that can overexpress the Tβ(10) gene in cancer cells. This was accomplished by replacing the native Tβ(10) gene promoter with the human TERT promoter in Ad.TERT.Tβ(10). We investigated the cancer suppression activity of Tβ(10) and found that Ad.TERT.Tβ(10) strikingly induced cancer-specific expression of Tβ(10) as well as apoptosis in a co-culture model of human primary ovarian cancer cells and normal fibroblasts. Additionally, Ad.TERT.Tβ(10) decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. These effects were amplified by co-treatment with anticancer drugs, such as paclitaxel and cisplatin. These findings indicate that the rise in ROS production due to actin disruption by Tβ(10) overexpression increases apoptosis of human ovarian cancer cells. Indeed, the cancer-specific overexpression of Tβ(10) by Ad.TERT.Tβ(10) could be a valuable anti-cancer therapeutic for the treatment of ovarian cancer without toxicity to normal cells."
https://openalex.org/W2105107464,"In Bacillus licheniformis 749/I, BlaP β-lactamase is induced by the presence of a β-lactam antibiotic outside the cell. The first step in the induction mechanism is the detection of the antibiotic by the membrane-bound penicillin receptor BlaR1 that is composed of two functional domains: a carboxy-terminal domain exposed outside the cell, which acts as a penicillin sensor, and an amino-terminal domain anchored to the cytoplasmic membrane, which works as a transducer-transmitter. The acylation of BlaR1 sensor domain by the antibiotic generates an intramolecular signal that leads to the activation of the L3 cytoplasmic loop of the transmitter by a single-point cleavage. The exact mechanism of L3 activation and the nature of the secondary cytoplasmic signal launched by the activated transmitter remain unknown. However, these two events seem to be linked to the presence of a HEXXH zinc binding motif of neutral zinc metallopeptidases. By different experimental approaches, we demonstrated that the L3 loop binds zinc ion, belongs to Gluzincin metallopeptidase superfamily and is activated by self-proteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1993237758,"Previously we reported that TGF-β1-induced growth suppression was associated with a decrease in mutant p53 levels in B-cell lymphoma cells. The goal of the present study was to understand the mechanism involved in TGF-β1-mediated down-regulation of mutant p53. In RL and CA46, two B-cell lymphoma cell lines, TGF-β1 treatment caused down-regulation of E2F-1 transcription factor resulting in the down-regulation of both p14ARF and mutant p53, leading to growth arrest. Experimental overexpression of E2F-1 increased p14ARF level and blocked TGF-β1-induced down-regulation of p14ARF. Overexpression of p14ARF blocked the down-regulation of mutant p53 and prevented growth arrest. p14ARF also attenuated TGF-β1-induced p21Cip1/WAF1 induction, which was reversible by p53 siRNA, indicating the involvement of mutant p53 in controlling the TGF-β1-induced expression of p21Cip1/WAF1. The interaction observed between phospho-Smad2 and mutant p53 in the nucleus could be the mechanism responsible for blocking the growth-suppressive effects of TGF-β1. In RL cells, p14ARF is present in a trimer consisting of mutant p53-Mdm2-p14ARF and in a dimer consisting of Mdm2-p14ARF. Because it is known that Mdm2 can degrade p53, it is possible that, in its trimeric form, p14ARF is able to stabilize mutant p53 by inhibiting Mdm2. In its dimeric form, p14ARF may be sequestering Mdm2, limiting its ability to degrade p53. Collectively, these data demonstrate a unique mechanism in which the inhibition of TGF-β1-mediated growth suppression by mutant p53 can be reversed by the down-regulation of its stabilizing protein p14ARF. This work suggests that the high levels of p14ARF often found in tumor cells could be a potential therapeutic target.Background: TGF-β1 suppresses growth of B-cell lymphoma cells.Results: TGF-β1-induced down-regulation of mutant p53 via p14ARF renders B-cell lymphoma cells sensitive to TGF-β1.Conclusion: Overexpression of p14ARF possibly causes TGF-β1 resistance.Significance: p14ARF is a potential therapeutic target for B-cell lymphoma. Previously we reported that TGF-β1-induced growth suppression was associated with a decrease in mutant p53 levels in B-cell lymphoma cells. The goal of the present study was to understand the mechanism involved in TGF-β1-mediated down-regulation of mutant p53. In RL and CA46, two B-cell lymphoma cell lines, TGF-β1 treatment caused down-regulation of E2F-1 transcription factor resulting in the down-regulation of both p14ARF and mutant p53, leading to growth arrest. Experimental overexpression of E2F-1 increased p14ARF level and blocked TGF-β1-induced down-regulation of p14ARF. Overexpression of p14ARF blocked the down-regulation of mutant p53 and prevented growth arrest. p14ARF also attenuated TGF-β1-induced p21Cip1/WAF1 induction, which was reversible by p53 siRNA, indicating the involvement of mutant p53 in controlling the TGF-β1-induced expression of p21Cip1/WAF1. The interaction observed between phospho-Smad2 and mutant p53 in the nucleus could be the mechanism responsible for blocking the growth-suppressive effects of TGF-β1. In RL cells, p14ARF is present in a trimer consisting of mutant p53-Mdm2-p14ARF and in a dimer consisting of Mdm2-p14ARF. Because it is known that Mdm2 can degrade p53, it is possible that, in its trimeric form, p14ARF is able to stabilize mutant p53 by inhibiting Mdm2. In its dimeric form, p14ARF may be sequestering Mdm2, limiting its ability to degrade p53. Collectively, these data demonstrate a unique mechanism in which the inhibition of TGF-β1-mediated growth suppression by mutant p53 can be reversed by the down-regulation of its stabilizing protein p14ARF.

Significance: p14ARF is a potential therapeutic target for B-cell lymphoma. Members of the TGF-β1 family have pleiotropic functions, including proliferation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis, in a broad range of cell lineages (1Feng X.H. Derynck R.

TGF-β1 signals through a heteromeric receptor complex on the cell surface and downstream intracellular signal-transducing Smad complexes activated by phosphorylation. Activated Smad complexes translocate into the nucleus and, in conjunction with other nuclear cofactors, regulate the transcription of target genes (3Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Heldin C. TGF-β signaling by Smad proteins.Adv. Immunol. 2000; 75: 115-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The signaling of TGF-β1 is finely regulated by negative feedback, including inhibitory Smads (4Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Morén A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M. Heldin N.E.

Decision making by p53: life, death and cancer.Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Approximately 50% of human cancers have inactivating mutations of p53, and most of the remaining malignancies deactivate the p53 pathway either by blunting its activity, reducing its activators, or inactivating its downstream targets (8Green D.R. Kroemer G. Cytoplasmic functions of the tumour suppressor p53.Nature. 2009; 458: 1127-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). It has been shown that mutant p53-expressing tumors are aggressive and associated with poor prognosis (9Soussi T. Béroud C. Assessing TP53 status in human tumours to evaluate clinical outcome.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Various p53 mutants confer different gain-of-function phenotypes such as increased cell growth (10Chen Y. Chen P.L. Lee W.H.

In mink Mv1Lu epithelial cells, TGF-β1-mediated G1 growth arrest is heavily dependent on wild type p53 inhibiting the translation of CDK4 2The abbreviations used are: CDKcyclin-dependent kinaseTβRIITGF-β1 receptor IIPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetatehCARhuman coxsackie adenovirus receptorm.o.i.multiplicity of infectionEGFPenhanced GFP.

It is also reported that p53 is required for TGF-β1-mediated growth arrest in certain mammalian cell types (21Cordenonsi M. Dupont S. Maretto S. Insinga A. Imbriano C. Piccolo S. Links between tumor suppressors: p53 is required for TGF-β gene responses by cooperating with Smads.Cell. 2003; 113: 301-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). It appears that p53 functions in this regard by cooperating with Smads to up-regulate the expression of the CDK inhibitor p21Cip1/WAF1. However, it was shown that the expression of mutant p53 caused cells to become resistant to TGF-β1-mediated growth suppression (12Gerwin B.I. Spillare E. Forrester K. Lehman T.A. Kispert J.

Recently, it was shown that a mutant p53-Smad complex contributes to TGF-β1-induced cell migration, invasion, and metastasis (23Adorno M. Cordenonsi M. Montagner M. Dupont S. Wong C. Hann B.

In primary tissues, p53 is expressed at very low levels because of its rapid degradation. For p53 to effectively function in growth arrest, its level must be stabilized. The primary mechanism involved in stabilizing p53 is through inhibition of the interaction between p53 and Mdm2, which targets p53 for degradation (24Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Regulation of p53 stability by Mdm2.Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2839) Google Scholar, 25Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Mdm2 promotes the rapid degradation of p53.Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3705) Google Scholar, 26Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Surfing the p53 network.Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5798) Google Scholar). Among several mechanisms involved in disrupting the Mdm2-p53 interaction, up-regulation of the tumor-suppressor protein p14ARF is an important one (27Lowe S.W. Sherr C.J. Tumor suppression by Ink4a-Arf: progress and puzzles.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Activation of p14ARF disrupts the physical interaction between p53 and Mdm2 resulting in the rapid degradation of Mdm2 and consequently more stable expression of p53. p14ARF tumor suppressor is the product of the alternative reading frame of the Ink4a locus, which also codes for p16Ink4a, an inhibitor for cyclin D-dependent kinases (28Kamijo T.

The INK4 family of cell cycle inhibitors in cancer.Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5311-5317Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In primary tissue, p14ARF (p19ARF in the mouse) is expressed at low levels. However, it can be induced by oncogenes such as Ras (31Palmero I. Pantoja C. Serrano M. p19ARF links the tumour suppressor p53 to Ras.Nature. 1998; 395: 125-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar), Myc (32Zindy F. Eischen C.M. Randle D.H. Kamijo T. Cleveland J.L.

Inhibition of v-Abl transformation by p53 and p19ARF.Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7731-7739Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) to cause p53-dependent growth arrest or apoptosis. In addition, p14ARF is able to inhibit cell growth through p53-independent pathways. For example, it has been shown that p14ARF is able to inhibit DNA synthesis in p53-null cells (34Korgaonkar C. Zhao L. Modestou M. Quelle D.E. ARF function does not require p53 stabilization or Mdm2 relocalization.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 35Yarbrough W.G. Bessho M. Zanation A. Bisi J.E. Xiong Y. Human tumor suppressor ARF impedes S-phase progression independent of p53.Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1171-1177PubMed Google Scholar). NFκB activity has been shown to be inhibited by p14ARF through interacting with RelA and repressing its transcriptional activity (36Rocha S. Campbell K.J. Perkins N.D. p53- and Mdm2-independent repression of NF-κB transactivation by the ARF tumor suppressor.Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 15-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). p14ARF is also involved in inhibiting the function of proproliferative factor B23 through direct interaction with B23 and promoting its polyubiquitinylation and proteosomal degradation (37Itahana K. Bhat K.P. Jin A. Itahana Y. Hawke D. Kobayashi R. Zhang Y. Tumor suppressor ARF degrades B23, a nucleolar protein involved in ribosome biogenesis and cell proliferation.Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1151-1164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that p53-independent functions of p14ARF may include its ability to promote sumoylation of several p14ARF-interacting proteins (38Sherr C.J. Bertwistle D. DEN Besten W. Kuo M.L. Sugimoto M. Tago K. Williams R.T. Zindy F. Roussel M.F. p53-dependent and -independent functions of the Arf tumor suppressor.Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 2005; 70: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We have previously reported the effect of TGF-β1 on a human B-lymphoma cell line, RL, which expresses a mutant form of p53 having a single point mutation, A138P. We found that TGF-β1 causes growth inhibition in these cells that occurs simultaneously with a decrease in the level of mutant p53 (39Beckwith M. Ruscetti F.W. Sing G.K. Urba W.J. Longo D.L. Anti-IgM induces transforming growth factor-β sensitivity in a human B-lymphoma cell line: inhibition of growth is associated with a downregulation of mutant p53.Blood. 1995; 85: 2461-2470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we examine the role and mechanism of the down-regulation of mutant p53 level caused by TGF-β1 treatment. We provide evidence suggesting that the decrease in mutant p53 level upon exposure to TGF-β1 mediates the growth-suppressive effect of this cytokine in B-cell lymphoma cell lines RL and CA46. The decrease in mutant p53 level is likely to be the result of a reduction in p14ARF levels because overexpression of p14ARF blocked TGF-β1-induced down-regulation of mutant p53 and subsequent growth arrest. Moreover, siRNA-mediated knockdown of p14ARF resulted in the down-regulation of mutant p53 and rendered cells more sensitive to TGF-β1-mediated growth suppression. Collectively these data demonstrate a unique mechanism in which the inhibition of TGF-β1-mediated growth suppression by mutant p53 is relieved by a TGF-β1-mediated signaling pathway that results in the down-regulation of the p53-stabilizing protein p14ARF. They also suggest that p14ARF antagonists may have an inhibitory effect on lymphoma proliferation. For Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation, anti-TGF-β1 receptor II (TβRII) (sc-400), Smad2 (sc-6200), p14ARF (sc-8613), and p53 (sc-126) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.

(Beverly, MA); mouse monoclonal anti-p21Cip1/WAF1 antibody was from Upstate (Charlottesville, VA); anti-β-actin was purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, UK); and anti-Nucleoporin p62 was from BD Biosciences. All HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from GE Healthcare. Recombinant TGF-β1 (240-B) was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was from Sigma. Anti-IgM was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Lymphoma cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mm l-glutamine, 1,000 units of penicillin/ml, and 100 μg of streptomycin/ml. No exogenous growth factors were added. Cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Fresh growth medium was added to cells every 3–4 days. For growth inhibition, cells were stimulated with 2 ng/ml recombinant TGF-β1 in RPMI 1640 medium with 5% FBS. Cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared according to the procedure reported earlier (40Uzzo R.G. Rayman P. Kolenko V. Clark P.E. Cathcart M.K. Bloom T. Novick A.C. Bukowski R.M. Hamilton T.

Whole cell lysates were prepared according to the following procedure. Harvested cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 μg/ml E-64, 1 mm PMSF, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, and 1% Triton X-100) and incubated on ice for 30 min. Samples were then homogenized and centrifuged, and the supernatants were collected. Protein concentrations were measured with Bio-Rad Protein Assay Dye reagent. Gel electrophoresis was carried out using 4–12% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. After membrane transfer, bound antibodies were detected using a chemiluminescence detection system (GE Healthcare). The quantification of cell proliferation was evaluated by WST-1 assay (Roche Applied Science), a colorimetric assay based on the cleavage of tetrazolium salt WST-1 by mitochondrial dehydrogenases in viable cells. 1 × 104 cells in 100 μl of culture medium were loaded in each well of a 96-well plate and incubated with 2 ng/ml TGF-β1 for 48 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. 10 μl of WST-1 reagent was added to each well, and cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The absorbance was measured with a microplate reader (Bio-Rad Model 680XR) with a 450-nm wavelength filter and a 655-nm reference wavelength filter. Lysates were precleared with protein A/G Plus-agarose (sc-2003, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) for 30 min at 4 °C, and the precleared lysates were incubated overnight with the primary antibody and A/G Plus-agarose beads. The agarose beads were washed three times with extraction buffer containing 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 15 mm MgCl2, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, 15 mm EGTA, 5 μg/ml E-64, 1 mm Na3OV4, 1 mm NaF, and 0.1% Triton X-100. The immune complexes were dissociated with lithium dodecyl sulfate buffer and boiled for 5 min. Electrophoresis was carried out by 4–12% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Total RNA was extracted from RL cells with an RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and purified according to the manufacturer's specifications. Up to 25 μg of total RNA from each sample was electrophoresed under denaturing conditions on a 1% agarose gel in glyoxal (Ambion, Austin, TX), blotted onto Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and cross-linked by UV irradiation. The membrane was prehybridized overnight at 42 °C in Hybrisol I (Chemicon, Millipore) followed by overnight hybridization with 1 × 106 cpm/ml specific cDNA probe labeled with 32P by random priming of a 450-bp BamHI/EcoRV fragment from the p14ARF/pcDNA3 using High Primer DNA labeling reagent (Roche Diagnostics). Probes were purified by a G-50 column (Amersham Biosciences) before use. The membranes were then washed and exposed to x-ray film at −70 °C. Values were obtained from three independent experiments and were expressed as means ± S.D. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test and analyzed by two-tailed test of paired samples. Values were considered significant (*) if p values were <0.05. pSuper/p14ARFsi is from Dr. Sonia Lain, Ninewells Hospital, University of Dundee, Scotland, UK; pCMV-Bam-Neo/p53 was obtained from Dr. Bert Vogelstein, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD; and pCMV-Bam-Neo/p53 A138P was reported earlier (41O'Farrell T.J.

The E2F-1 expression vector was kindly provided by Dr. Asish Lal, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. Exponentially growing RL cells were resuspended in 100 μl of Kit V solution (Lonza, Gaithersburg, MD) containing 3 μg of plasmid. Cells were then exposed to electroporation (program S-18) using a Nucleofector device (Lonza). After 12 h, cells were transferred to fresh medium and were cultured for 24 h. To generate adenovirus constructs, sequences corresponding to the wild type TβRII and p14ARF were amplified from DNA constructs (generous gifts from Drs. Joan Massague from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York and Kevin Ryan from the National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD, respectively) and subcloned into pENTRY/SD/D-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Recombination between p14ARF from pENTRY/SD/D and pAD/CMV/V5-DEST vector was carried out by LR Clonase II Enzyme Mix (Invitrogen), and preparation of adenoviruses bearing p14ARF was done according to the manufacturer's instructions. To introduce the human coxsackie adenovirus receptor (hCAR) to the B-cell lymphoma cell line, pHRCMV/hCAR-EGFP (generously provide by Dr. Mikko Mättö, University of Kuopio, Finland) was used. RL/hCAR-EGFP cells were infected with adenovirus harboring p14ARF with a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) equal to 200. To reduce mutant p53 expression in RL cells, a lentiviral construct, pWPXL-p53si (kindly provided by Dr. Radek C. Skoda, Basel University Hospital, Switzerland), was used. Lentiviral production with pWPXL-p53si and pHRCMV/hCAR-EGFP using the envelope vector pMD.G and the packaging vector pCMVR8.91 (kindly provided by Dr. Didier Trono, Global Health Institute, Switzerland) was carried out as described before (42Salmon P.

High-level transgene expression in human hematopoietic progenitors and differentiated blood lineages after transduction with improved lentiviral vectors.Blood. 2000; 96: 3392-3398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RL cells were seeded in a 12-well plate at 1×106 cells/well, and virus was added at an m.o.i. equal to 10. EGFP-positive cells were isolated by limiting dilution and checked by FACScan (BD Biosciences). RL/hCAR-EGFP cells were infected with TβRII/pAD and p14ARF/pAD for 24 h. Then the cells were transfected with p53 expression construct (a gift from Dr. Bert Vogelstein, The Johns Hopkins University), p21Cip1/WAF1 promoter-luciferase construct pWWP-Luc (p21Cip1/WAF1) (a gift from Dr. Weiguo Zhu, Peking University Health Science Center, China), and β-galactosidase expression construct by electroporation as described previously (43Chen G.

For mutant p53 knockdown experiments, RL cells were infected with pWPXL-p53si for 24 h before adenovirus infection. Transfected cells were further cultured for 24 h before activation with TGF-β1 for 16 h. β-Galactosidase and luciferase activity was measured with the Beta-Glo and Bright-Glo (Promega, Madison, WI) assays according to the instructions of the manufacturer. p21Cip1/WAF1 promoter-luciferase activity was normalized with the β-galactosidase assay. This assay was carried out according to the protocol described previously with minor modification (44Sasaki C.Y. Slemenda C.F. Ghosh P. Barberi T.J. Longo D.L.

After cross-linking with formaldehyde, soluble chromatin from the samples was obtained by sonication (Bronson sonicator 350). The chromatin was incubated overnight with 2 μg of either normal IgG or anti-Smad2/3 or anti-E2F-1 antibody. After washing and elution, the immunocomplexed DNA was isolated with Chelex beads (Bio-Rad) and analyzed by PCR. Primers used to amplify DNA fragments corresponding to a Smad binding region (SBR1) on human p21Cip1/WAF1 promoter were 5′-GAGGAAAAGCATCTTGGAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-AATAGACGGGAGCAACG-3′ (reverse) (45Koinuma D.

We have shown previously that RL cells are unresponsive to TGF-β1-mediated growth suppression, whereas in the presence of a low dose of PMA, RL cells can be rendered responsive to TGF-β1 (43Chen G. Ghosh P. Osawa H. Sasaki C.Y. Rezanka L. Yang J. O'Farrell T.J. Longo D.L. Resistance to TGF-β1 correlates with aberrant expression of TGF-β receptor II in human B-cell lymphoma cell lines.Blood. 2007; 109: 5301-5307Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). We have also reported that treatment of RL cells with PMA/TGF-β1 results in the down-regulation of mutant p53 (Ala-138 to Pro), the only form of p53 present in RL cells (i.e. wild type p53 is absent) (39Beckwit"

Hence, the prediction of outcome of virus competition in plants is not easy. In this study, we applied evolutionary game theory to model the interactions between Hibiscus latent Singapore virus (HLSV) and Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) in Nicotiana benthamiana under co-infection in a plant host. The accumulation of viral RNA was quantified using qPCR at 1, 2 and 8 days post infection (dpi), and two different methods were employed to predict the dominating virus. TMV was predicted to dominate the game in the long run and this prediction was confirmed by both qRT-PCR at 8 dpi and the death of co-infected plants after 15 dpi. In addition, we validated our model by using data reported in the literature. Ten out of fourteen reported co-infection outcomes agreed with our predictions. Explanations were given for the four interactions that did not agree with our model. Hence, it serves as a valuable tool in making long term predictions using short term data obtained in virus co-infections."
