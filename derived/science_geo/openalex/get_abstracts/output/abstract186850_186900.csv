Here we demonstrate negative refraction of electromagnetic waves in a two-dimensional dielectric photonic crystal that has a periodically modulated positive permittivity and a permeability of unity4,5,6. This experimental verification of negative refraction is a step towards the realization of a 'superlens' that will be able to focus features smaller than the wavelength of light."

https://openalex.org/W2316580498,"NF-κB is a principal transcriptional regulator of diverse cytokine-mediated processes and is tightly controlled by the IκB kinase complex (IKK-α/β/γ). IKK-β and IKK-γ are critical for cytokine-induced NF-κB function, whereas IKK-α is thought to be involved in other regulatory pathways1,2,3,4. However, recent data suggest a role for IKK-α in NF-κB-dependent gene expression in response to cytokine treatment1,5,6,7. Here we demonstrate nuclear accumulation of IKK-α after cytokine exposure, suggesting a nuclear function for this protein. Consistent with this, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays reveal that IKK-α was recruited to the promoter regions of NF-κB-regulated genes on stimulation with tumour-necrosis factor-α. Notably, NF-κB-regulated gene expression is suppressed by the loss of IKK-α and this correlates with a complete loss of gene-specific phosphorylation of histone H3 on serine 10, a modification previously associated with positive gene expression. Furthermore, we show that IKK-α can directly phosphorylate histone H3 in vitro, suggesting a new substrate for this kinase. We propose that IKK-α is an essential regulator of NF-κB-dependent gene expression through control of promoter-associated histone phosphorylation after cytokine exposure. These findings provide additional insight into the role of the IKK complex in NF-κB-regulated gene expression."

https://openalex.org/W2079647856,"Understanding energy and material fluxes through ecosystems is central to many questions in global change biology and ecology. Ecosystem respiration is a critical component of the carbon cycle and might be important in regulating biosphere response to global climate change. Here we derive a general model of ecosystem respiration based on the kinetics of metabolic reactions and the scaling of resource use by individual organisms. The model predicts that fluxes of CO2 and energy are invariant of ecosystem biomass, but are strongly influenced by temperature, variation in cellular metabolism and rates of supply of limiting resources (water and/or nutrients). Variation in ecosystem respiration within sites, as calculated from a network of CO2 flux towers, provides robust support for the model's predictions. However, data indicate that variation in annual flux between sites is not strongly dependent on average site temperature or latitude. This presents an interesting paradox with regard to the expected temperature dependence. Nevertheless, our model provides a basis for quantitatively understanding energy and material flux between the atmosphere and biosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2066606488,"In animals, the sphingolipid metabolite sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) functions as both an intracellular messenger and an extracellular ligand for G-protein-coupled receptors of the S1P receptor family, regulating diverse biological processes ranging from cell proliferation to apoptosis. Recently, it was discovered in plants that S1P is a signalling molecule involved in abscisic acid (ABA) regulation of guard cell turgor. Here we report that the enzyme responsible for S1P production, sphingosine kinase (SphK), is activated by ABA in Arabidopsis thaliana, and is involved in both ABA inhibition of stomatal opening and promotion of stomatal closure. Consistent with this observation, inhibition of SphK attenuates ABA regulation of guard cell inward K(+) channels and slow anion channels, which are involved in the regulation of stomatal pore size. Surprisingly, S1P regulates stomatal apertures and guard cell ion channel activities in wild-type plants, but not in knockout lines of the sole prototypical heterotrimeric G-protein alpha-subunit gene, GPA1 (refs 5, 6, 7-8). Our results implicate heterotrimeric G proteins as downstream elements in the S1P signalling pathway that mediates ABA regulation of stomatal function, and suggest that the interplay between S1P and heterotrimeric G proteins represents an evolutionarily conserved signalling mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W2073266176,"Various properties of semiconductor nanoparticles, including photoluminescence and catalytic activity, make these materials attractive for a range of applications. As nanoparticles readily coagulate and so lose their size-dependent properties, shape-persistent three-dimensional stabilizers that enfold nanoparticles have been exploited. However, such wrapping approaches also make the nanoparticles insensitive to external stimuli, and so may limit their application. The chaperonin proteins GroEL (from Escherichia coli) and T.th ('T.th cpn', from Thermus thermophilus HB8) encapsulate denatured proteins inside a cylindrical cavity; after refolding, the encapsulated proteins are released by the action of ATP inducing a conformational change of the cavity. Here we report that GroEL and T.th cpn can also enfold CdS semiconductor nanoparticles, giving them high thermal and chemical stability in aqueous media. Analogous to the biological function of the chaperonins, the nanoparticles can be readily released from the protein cavities by the action of ATP. We expect that integration of such biological mechanisms into materials science will open a door to conceptually new bioresponsive devices."

https://openalex.org/W2079133863,"ADAMTS13 consists of a reprolysin-type metalloprotease domain followed by a disintegrin domain, a thrombospondin type 1 motif (TSP1), Cys-rich and spacer domains, seven more TSP1 motifs, and two CUB domains. ADAMTS13 limits platelet accumulation in microvascular thrombi by cleaving the Tyr<sup>1605</sup>-Met<sup>1606</sup> bond in von Willebrand factor, and ADAMTS13 deficiency causes a lethal syndrome, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. ADAMTS13 domains required for substrate recognition were localized by the characterization of recombinant deletion mutants. Constructs with C-terminal His<sub>6</sub> and V5 epitopes were expressed by transient transfection of COS-7 cells or in a baculovirus system. No association with extracellular matrix or cell surface was detected for any ADAMTS13 variant by immunofluorescence microscopy or chemical modification. Both plasma and recombinant full-length ADAMTS13 cleaved von Willebrand factor subunits into two fragments of 176 kDa and 140 kDa. Recombinant ADAMTS13 was divalent metal ion-dependent and was inhibited by IgG from a patient with idiopathic thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. ADAMTS13 that was truncated after the metalloprotease domain, the disintegrin domain, the first TSP1 repeat, or the Cys-rich domain was not able to cleave von Willebrand factor, whereas addition of the spacer region restored protease activity. Therefore, the spacer region is necessary for normal ADAMTS13 activity toward von Willebrand factor, and the more C-terminal TSP1 and CUB domains are dispensable <i>in vitro</i>."
https://openalex.org/W2058822610,"Two hypotheses to explain potentially high forest biodiversity have different implications for the number and kinds of species that can coexist and the potential loss of biodiversity in the absence of speciation. The first hypothesis involves stabilizing mechanisms, which include tradeoffs between species in terms of their capacities to disperse to sites where competition is weak, to exploit abundant resources effectively and to compete for scarce resources. Stabilization results because competitors thrive at different times and places. An alternative, 'neutral model' suggests that stabilizing mechanisms may be superfluous. This explanation emphasizes 'equalizing' mechanisms, because competitive exclusion of similar species is slow. Lack of ecologically relevant differences means that abundances experience random 'neutral drift', with slow extinction. The relative importance of these two mechanisms is unknown, because assumptions and predictions involve broad temporal and spatial scales. Here we demonstrate that predictions of neutral drift are testable using palaeodata. The results demonstrate strong stabilizing forces. By contrast with the neutral prediction of increasing variance among sites over time, we show that variances in post-Glacial tree abundances among sites stabilize rapidly, and abundances remain coherent over broad geographical scales."
https://openalex.org/W2060275129,"The temporal gene expression profile during the entire process of apoptosis and cell cycle progression in response to p53 in human ovarian cancer cells was explored with cDNA microarrays representing 33 615 individual human genes. A total of 1501 genes (4.4%) were found to respond to p53 (approximately 80% of these were repressed by p53) using 2.5-fold change as a cutoff. It was anticipated that most of p53 responsive genes resulted from the secondary effect of p53 expression at late stage of apoptosis. To delineate potential p53 direct and indirect target genes during the process of apoptosis and cell cycle progression, microarray data were combined with global p53 DNA-binding site analysis. Here we showed that 361 out of 1501 p53 responsive genes contained p53 consensus DNA-binding sequence(s) in their regulatory region, approximately 80% of which were repressed by p53. This is the first time that a large number of p53-repressed genes have been identified to contain p53 consensus DNA-binding sequence(s) in their regulatory region. Hierarchical cluster analysis of these genes revealed distinct temporal expression patterns of transcriptional activation and repression by p53. More genes were activated at early time points, while more repressed genes were found after the onset of apoptosis. A small-scale quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that in vivo p53-DNA interaction was detected in eight out of 10 genes, most of which were repressed by p53 at the early onset of apoptosis, suggesting that a portion of p53 target genes in the human genome could be negatively regulated by p53 via sequence-specific DNA binding. The approaches and genes described here should aid the understanding of global gene regulatory network of p53."
https://openalex.org/W2122838518,"Atovaquone is a substituted 2-hydroxynaphthoquinone that is used therapeutically to treat Plasmodium falciparum malaria, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, and Toxoplasma gondii toxoplasmosis. It is thought to act on these organisms by inhibiting the cytochrome bc 1 complex. We have examined the interaction of atovaquone with the bc 1 complex isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a surrogate, nonpathogenic fungus. Atovaquone inhibits the bc 1 complex competitively with apparent K i = 9 nm, raises the midpoint potential of the Rieske iron-sulfur protein from 285 to 385 mV, and shifts the g values in the EPR spectrum of the Rieske center. These results indicate that atovaquone binds to the ubiquinol oxidation pocket of the bc 1 complex, where it interacts with the Rieske iron-sulfur protein. A computed energy-minimized structure for atovaquone liganded to the yeast bc 1 complex suggests that a phenylalanine at position 275 of cytochrome b in the bovine bc 1 complex, as opposed to leucine at the equivalent position in the yeast enzyme, is responsible for the decreased sensitivity of the bovine bc 1 complex (K i = 80 nm) to atovaquone. When a L275F mutation was introduced into the yeast cytochrome b, the sensitivity of the yeast enzyme to atovaquone decreased (K i = 100 nm) with no loss in activity, confirming that the L275F exchange contributes to the differential sensitivity of these two species to atovaquone. These results provide the first molecular description of how atovaquone binds to the bc 1 complex and explain the differential inhibition of the fungal versus mammalian enzymes.

The cytochrome bc 1 complex (EC 1.10.2.2) is an essential respiratory enzyme complex present in the inner mitochondrial membrane of eukaryotic organisms. The bc 1 complex catalyzes electron transfer from ubiquinol to cytochrome c and concomitantly translocates protons across membranes (1Trumpower B.L. Gennis R.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 675-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). The enzyme is a functional dimer, with variable subunit composition among species. The essential subunits for electron transfer and energy transduction are those that contain prosthetic groups, cytochrome b, cytochrome c 1, and the Rieske iron-sulfur protein.Atovaquone (2-[trans-4-(4′-chlorophenyl)cyclohexyl]-3-hydroxy-1,4-hydroxynaphthoquinone) (2Wendel W.B.

The effects of the drug on cell respiration and the structural similarities of atovaquone and ubiquinol suggested that the bc 1 complex was the target (4Fry M. Pudney M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 1545-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). This has been supported by the emergence of mutations in the cytochrome b gene coincident with resistance to the drug (9Walker D. Wakefield A. Dohn M. Miller R. Baughman R. Hossler P. Bartlett M.

Because of the appearance of atovaquone resistance in these protozoan parasites, the mechanism of binding of the drug to the bc 1 complex must be fully understood in order to improve its effectiveness. However, to date there has been no characterization of the interaction of atovaquone with the isolated enzyme.We have been developing Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a surrogate organism in which to model the mechanism of atovaquone action in the above named pathogens. This yeast was chosen for these studies because of the high sequence identity between its cytochrome b and those of Plasmodium and P. carinii (15Hill, P., Kessl, J., Fisher, N., Meshnick, S., Trumpower, B. L., and Meunier, B. (2003) Antimicrobiol. Agents Chemother., in pressGoogle Scholar). In addition, the yeast enzyme can easily be purified, and its crystal structure is available (16Hunte C. Koepke J. Lange C. Rossmanith T. Mitchel H. Structure. 2000; 8: 669-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar).In the current study, we have characterized the interaction of atovaquone with the yeast cytochrome bc 1 complex. Based on these results, we have developed a model that describes the molecular basis for atovaquone binding at the ubiquinol oxidation pocket of the bc 1 complex. This model also explains the basis for the differential efficacy of inhibition of the yeast and bovine bc 1 complexes by atovaquone.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Yeast extract and peptone were from Difco. Nitrogen base without amino acids but with ammonium sulfate was from U.S. Biological. Dodecylmaltoside was obtained from Roche Applied Science. DEAE-Biogel A was obtained from Bio-Rad. Diisopropylfluorophosphate, decyl ubiquinone, and dithionite were purchased from Sigma. Stigmatellin was purchased from Fluka Biochemica. Atovaquone was a gift from Glaxo-Wellcome.Purification of Cytochrome bc 1 Complexes—Wild type yeast and the L275F mutant were grown in yeast extract/peptone/dextrose medium and harvested by centrifugation. The L275F mutation was introduced into the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene by biolistic transformation as described elsewhere (15Hill, P., Kessl, J., Fisher, N., Meshnick, S., Trumpower, B. L., and Meunier, B. (2003) Antimicrobiol. Agents Chemother., in pressGoogle Scholar). Cytochrome bc 1 complexes were isolated from yeast and bovine heart mitochondria as described previously (17Snyder C.H. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31209-31216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 18Ljungdahl P.O. Pennoyer J.D. Robertson D. Trumower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 891: 227-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and concentrated by centrifugal filtration, using Amicon® Centriprep YM-30 filtration tubes.Ubiquinol-Cytochrome c Reductase Activity Measurements—Cytochrome c reductase activity was assayed in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 250 mm sucrose, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaN3, 2.5 mm KCN, 0.01% Tween 20, and 40 μm cytochrome c at 23 °C. The cytochrome bc 1 complex was diluted to 2.5 nm in the assay buffer, and the reaction was started by adding 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-decyl-1,4-benzoquinol, an analogue of ubiquinol. To determine activities in the presence of various concentrations of atovaquone, inhibitor and substrate were mixed simultaneously into the assay buffer, and the reaction was started by adding enzyme. Reduction of cytochrome c was monitored in an Aminco DW-2a spectrophotometer at 550 versus 539 nm in dual wavelength mode. Data were collected and analyzed using an Online Instrument Systems Inc. computer interface and software. Assuming rapid equilibrium between enzyme, substrate, and inhibitor, the K i values for a competitive inhibitor were calculated from the measured IC50 values and the following formula (19Cheng Y.C. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-30108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12187) Google Scholar).

Spectroscopy—EPR spectra were recorded at a temperature of 20 K, microwave frequency of 9.47 GHz, microwave power of 1 milliwatt, and a modulation amplitude of 0.64 millitesla using a Bruker ESP 300E spectrometer equipped with a liquid helium continuous flow cryostat, ESR 900, from Oxford Instruments. The bc 1 complex was diluted to 24 μm in a buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 50 mm potassium phosphate, 1 mm sodium azide, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 0.01% Tween 20, pH 7.0. The samples were reduced with 5 mm ascorbate. After reduction, 3 eq of atovaquone (72 μm) or stigmatellin were added when indicated, and the samples were incubated for 20 min on ice. For base-line correction, a sample of bc 1 complex without any addition, representing the oxidized state, was subtracted from the spectra of ascorbate-reduced samples. We estimate that the deviations in gz and gy are ±0.001, and those in gx are ±0.005 in the spectra shown.Potentiometric Titrations—The titrations were performed by CD spectroscopy in an OTTLE cell with a path length of 100 μm (20Denke E. Merbitz-Zahradnik T. Hatzfeld O.M. Snyder C.H. Link T.A. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9085-9093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The concentration of bc 1 complex was at least 300 μm. A mixture of redox mediators including benzyl viologen (–358 mV), anthraquinone-2-sulfonate (–225 mV), 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (–152 mV), menadione (–13 mV), duroquinone (5 mV), phenazine ethosulfate (55 mV), phenazine methosulfate (80 mV), trimethyl-1,4-benzoquinone (99 mV), 1,2-naphthoquinone (144 mV), tetramethyl-p-phenyldiamine (276 mV), potassium hexacyanoferrate (408 mV), and ferrocene-1,1′-dicarboxylic acid (530 and 644 mV) was added to facilitate equilibration with the electrode potentials (numbers in brackets are E m7 of the mediators in mV). The mediators, which spanned the potential range from –358 to +644 mV, were all present at a final concentration of 20–25 μm. Equilibration of the protein with the applied potential was confirmed by repetitive scan monitoring of the redox state of the entire bc 1 complex. Only spectra of the completely equilibrated protein were used for data analysis. The inhibitors NHDBT and atovaquone were added in 3-fold molar excess. Four scans of the spectrum at each potential value were accumulated with a scan speed of 200 nm/min, 2-nm bandwidth, and an integration time of 4 s. From the resulting spectrum, the amplitudes of the CD signal at five wavelengths (494, 498, 500, 502, and 505 nm) centering around 500 nm were extracted from each spectrum, and the amplitude values were averaged. This wavelength was chosen to monitor the potentiometric titration, since the reduced iron-sulfur protein has a CD signal centering around 500 nm that disappears when the cluster is oxidized (for an example of the reduced protein spectrum, see Ref. 20Denke E. Merbitz-Zahradnik T. Hatzfeld O.M. Snyder C.H. Link T.A. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9085-9093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). From the total amplitude change, the degree of reduction of the Rieske protein was calculated. Complete reduction refers to the negative CD signal intensity of the Rieske protein. The amplitudes of the CD signals at 500 nm are indicated in the legend to Fig. 4. The potential curves were fitted by Nernstian functions assuming an n = 1 electron transition.Molecular Modeling—Atovaquone was built in silico and an energy-minimized conformation was calculated using MacSpartan Pro® (Wavefunction, Inc., Irvine, CA). The initial structure was submitted to a conformational energy profile determination by molecular mechanics using the MMFF function in the program. The lowest energy conformer was then submitted to a more refined energy minimization in the same program using the Hartree-Fock molecular orbital method and a 3–21 G basis set for the calculation. The theoretical basis of the molecular mechanics calculations using the MMFF force field and the Hartree-Fock quantum mechanical calculations, including a description of the 3–21 G split valence basis set, is described elsewhere (21Hehre W.J. Yu J. Klunzinger P.E. Lou L. A Brief Guide to Molecular Mechanics and Quantum Chemical Calculations. Wavefunction, Inc., Irvine, CA1998: 7-35Google Scholar). The energy-minimized conformation of atovaquone thus obtained was used as a starting point for modeling the ligand into the yeast cytochrome bc 1 complex.Molecular modeling was carried out on a Silicon Graphics O2 work station using the Discover 3® module within the Insight II® software package (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA). The starting structure was the stigmatellin-liganded yeast cytochrome bc 1 complex (Protein Data Bank code 1EZV) at a resolution of 2.30 Å (16Hunte C. Koepke J. Lange C. Rossmanith T. Mitchel H. Structure. 2000; 8: 669-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Atovaquone and cytochrome b residues within 4.0 Å of either atovaquone or Glu272 were allowed to be flexible. A surrounding 9.5-Å shell of residues in both cytochrome b and the iron-sulfur protein was fixed, and the most distant residues were excluded from the calculation in order to obtain a manageable simulation speed. A 9.5-Å atom-based cut-off for nonbonding interactions was used during the calculations, with the dielectric constant set at 2.0. Eight simulated annealing runs were performed, each from 800 to 298 K, with five temperature steps and a simulation time of 5000 fs/step. The Nosé temperature control method (22Nose S. J. Chem. Phys. 1984; 81: 511-519Crossref Scopus (12165) Google Scholar) was used with a 0.5 fs/iteration time step.A custom macro was written to select the lowest energy structure from each dynamics run for continued modeling. Between each dynamics run, a minimization of 250 iterations was performed. After the final round of molecular dynamics, the lowest energy structure was minimized to a final convergence criterion of 0.001, using Cauchy's steepest descent method as implemented in the Discover 3® module within the Insight II® software, followed by conjugate gradient (23Jacobs D.A.H. The State of the Art in Numerical Analysis. Academic Press, London1977: 256-258Google Scholar), and Newton (Broyden, Fletcher, Goldfarb, and Shand) methods (24Fletcher R. Practical Methods of Optimization. Academic Press, Inc., New York1987: 54-57Google Scholar) in succession. Of the eight minimized results obtained, the three lowest energy structures were chosen, and each was modeled again twice, using the same set of parameters. Overlaying the final atovaquone-bound structure on the original stigmatellin structure showed a minimal amount of backbone shifting and, with the exception of the rotated Glu272 side chain, just enough side-chain movement to accommodate the chloro-benzyl tail of atovaquone.The cytochrome b mutation L275F was built into the modeled atovaquone-bound center P site using the Biopolymer® module. The flexible subset was defined by a 2.0-Å radius from the mutated residue L275F. A 9.5-Å surrounding radius, including atovaquone, was kept fixed. This minimal flexibility allowed evaluation of the energy cost that the L275F mutation has on atovaquone binding. Using the same procedure as for the modeling of atovaquone into the wild-type structure, four simulated annealing runs were carried out on the L275F mutant structure. The final energy of each of the four L275F mutant runs was evaluated using the CFF91 force field and the same residues as for the wild-type runs.RESULTSStructural Similarities between Atovaquone and Stigmatellin—Stigmatellin (25Kunze B. Kemmer T. Höfle G. Reichenbach H. J. Antibiot. 1984; 37: 454Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) is a competitive inhibitor (26Covian R Pardon J.P. Moreno Sanchez R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48449-48455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) that binds in the ubiquinol oxidation pocket at center P of the bc 1 complex. Its benzopyranone ring system binds to the yeast bc 1 complex via its hydroxyl group to Glu272 of cytochrome b and via its carbonyl group to His181 of the Rieske iron-sulfur protein (16Hunte C. Koepke J. Lange C. Rossmanith T. Mitchel H. Structure. 2000; 8: 669-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Atovaquone also inhibits the bc 1 complex and, by analogy to other hydroxyquinone inhibitors (27Bowyer J.R. Edwards C.A. Ohnishi T. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8321-8330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is presumed to bind to the ubiquinol oxidation pocket. Below, we show that this presumption is correct and that, like stigmatellin, atovaquone is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme. The structural basis for stigmatellin binding to the yeast bc 1 complex is thus a useful starting point to elucidate the structural basis of atovaquone binding.In Fig. 1, we have compared the energy-minimized structure of atovaquone with the structure of stigmatellin extracted from the yeast bc 1 complex with stigmatellin bound (Protein Data Bank code 1EZV). The energy-minimized structure of atovaquone is one in which the hydroxynaphthoquinone and chlorophenyl rings are rotated 90° relative to the cyclohexyl ring that links them, and the latter is in a chair conformation. When the calculated atovaquone structure is superposed on the stigmatellin structure, the two inhibitors display structural similarities in the alignment of their ring systems (Fig. 1). This is one indication that the two molecules probably share the same binding mode on the bc 1 complex. Although there is some structural similarity between the hydroxyquinone ring of atovaquone and the benzopyranone of stigmatellin, the side chains extending from the rings differ significantly, both in structure and in spatial conformation.Fig. 1Structures of atovaquone and stigmatellin. The structures of the two inhibitors are shown at the top. Below, in color, are shown the energy-minimized conformation of atovaquone (in yellow) and the structure of stigmatellin (in green) as it appears in the yeast crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code 1EZV). At the bottom, the two inhibitors are superimposed and shown in two views, rotated ∼90° with respect to each other.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Atovaquone Is a Competitive Inhibitor of the bc 1 Complex— Inhibition by atovaquone was measured, and the type of inhibition was determined using cytochrome bc 1 complex purified from the yeast. The results from this characterization are shown in Fig. 2. Under the usual conditions of a cytochrome c reductase assay, with enzyme and substrate concentrations of 2.5 nm and 50 μm, respectively, titration of the inhibitor results in an IC50 = 50 nm. From the reciprocal plots of initial velocity versus substrate concentration at different atovaquone concentrations, it is evident that the compound is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme. Using a value of 11 μm determined for the K m in the absence of inhibitor, one can calculate an apparent K i = 9 nm for the competitive inhibitor.Fig. 2Inhibition of yeast cytochrome bc 1 complex by atovaquone. In the left panel cytochrome c reductase activity of purified yeast bc 1 complex was measured in the presence of varying amounts of atovaquone. In the absence of inhibitor, K cat = 130 s–1. The right panel shows reciprocal plots of cytochrome c reductase activity initial velocity (1/s–1) versus substrate concentration (1/μm) measured in the absence of atovaquone (diamonds), with 20 nm (squares) and with 40 nm (circles) atovaquone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Interaction of Atovaquone with the Rieske Iron-Sulfur Protein—Stigmatellin and UHDBT, an alkyl-hydroxybenzoxythiazole, interact with the Rieske iron-sulfur protein at the center P ubiquinol oxidation pocket in the bc 1 complex (26Covian R Pardon J.P.

We thus examined this possible interaction with atovaquone. EPR spectra of the Rieske iron-sulfur center in the purified bc 1 complex from S. cerevisiae with and without bound atovaquone are shown in Fig. 3. The ascorbate-reduced Rieske center revealed signals at gz = 2.028, gy = 1.899, and gx = 1.75. The addition of atovaquone shifted the gz and gx signals to higher field, gz = 2.034 and gx = 1.76, whereas the gy component showed a lower value, gy = 1.888. A shift of the g value of 0.01, as in the case for the gy signal, is ∼21 Gauss. This corresponds to one times the complete line width of the signal. Atovaquone had almost the same effects on the Rieske EPR spectrum as stigmatellin, although the effects of stigmatellin were more pronounced in the gx region. In the bovine bc 1 complex, UHDBT resulted in almost the same g values as observed for atovaquone in the yeast enzyme (27Bowyer J.R. Edwards C.A. Ohnishi T. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8321-8330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the data are similar to those published for a hydroxynaphthoquinone bound to the Rieske protein in the bc 1 complex from a photosynthetic bacteria (28Bowyer J.R.

The top spectrum is of the Rieske iron-sulfur center in the bc 1 complex without inhibitor, the middle spectrum is in the presence of atovaquone, and the bottom spectrum is in the presence of stigmatellin. The dashed lines are drawn through the indicated resonance peaks in the control spectrum to emphasize the shifts of the gx, gy, and gz signals as a result of inhibitor binding.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We also tested the effect of atovaquone on the midpoint potential of the Rieske iron-sulfur cluster. The reduction status of the iron-sulfur cluster of the yeast bc 1 complex was monitored by CD spectroscopy as the applied redox potential was varied (Fig. 4). In the absence of inhibitors, the midpoint potential determined from these titrations was 285 mV. This value is identical to that previously obtained for the yeast Rieske protein (20Denke E. Merbitz-Zahradnik T. Hatzfeld O.M. Snyder C.H. Link T.A. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9085-9093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and also identical to that for the bovine heart Rieske protein (27Bowyer J.R. Edwards C.A. Ohnishi T. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8321-8330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of atovaquone, the midpoint potential of the Rieske iron-sulfur cluster increased from 285 to 385 mV. Due to scatter in the data at low potentials, this value may be as low as 370 mV. This indicates that atovaquone binds ∼50-fold more tightly when the Rieske center is reduced. By way of comparison, with nonyl-HDBT, an analog of UHDBT, the midpoint potential increased from 285 to 350 ± 12 mV, similar to the effect of UHDBT on the midpoint potential of the bovine bc 1 complex (27Bowyer J.R. Edwards C.A. Ohnishi T. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8321-8330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Docking of Atovaquone in the Yeast bc 1 Complex—An energy-minimized structure of atovaquone was docked in the ubiquinol oxidation pocket at center P using the coordinates of the yeast bc 1 complex and is shown in Fig. 5. In this structure, the naphthoquinone ring of the atovaquone was positioned 2.6 Å deeper than the stigmatellin ring system in order to obtain maximum interaction between the minimized ligand and the pocket. As viewed from the naphthoquinone ring and compared with the lowest energy conformation in the unbound form, the cyclohexyl ring rotates 47° clockwise around the bond to the naphthoquinone ring, and the chlorophenyl ring rotates 32° clockwise around the bond to the cyclohexyl ring. These rotational changes involve very little change in conformational energy, which is reasonable, since any such change would have to be compensated for by an increased cost in binding energy.Fig. 5Energy-minimized structure of atovaquone binding in the ubiquinol oxidation pocket at center P of the yeast bc 1 complex. Cytochrome b is shown in cyan, and a portion of the Rieske iron-sulfur protein is shown in gold. The iron-sulfur cluster is at the lower left, with iron and sulfur atoms colored purple and yellow, respectively. The C helix of cytochrome b is shown extending vertically on the right, and the cd1 helix is shown across the bottom of the binding pocket. Leu275 and Glu272 in the ef loop of cytochrome b are also shown. Atovaquone is hydrogen-bonded to His181 of the Rieske protein and to a bound water that forms a bridge to Glu272 through a second hydrogen bond. The hydroxynaphthoquinone ring is toward the front, and the chlorophenyl ring extends to the rear. The carbon atoms in atovaquone, His181, and Glu272 are green, oxygen atoms are red, nitrogen atoms are blue, and hydrogen atoms are white. Leu275 is purple.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Notably, the hydroxyl group of the hydroxynaphthoquinone binds via a hydrogen bond to the nitrogen of His181 of the Rieske protein. On the opposite side of the ring system, atovaquone interacts with Glu272 of cytochrome b with the carbonyl group at position 4 on the quinone ring. A survey of ∼60 protein crystal structures at 2.0 Å or better resolution in the Atlas of Side-chain and Main-chain Hydrogen Bonds (available on the World Wide Web at www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/~mcdonald/atlas/glu.html) indicates that the side chains of glutamic acid residues are usually not proton donors, due to the low pK a of the carboxyl group (see also Ref. 31McDonald E.K.

https://openalex.org/W2076844113,"Specialized membrane microdomains known as lipid rafts are thought to contribute to G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling by organizing receptors and their cognate signaling molecules into discrete membrane domains. To determine if the GnRHR, an unusual member of the GPCR superfamily, partitions into lipid rafts, homogenates of αT3-1 cells expressing endogenous GnRHR or Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing an epitope-tagged GnRHR were fractionated through a sucrose gradient. We found the GnRHR and c-raf kinase constitutively localized to low density fractions independent of hormone treatment. Partitioning of c-raf kinase into lipid rafts was also observed in whole mouse pituitary glands. Consistent with GnRH induced phosphorylation and activation of c-raf kinase, GnRH treatment led to a decrease in the apparent electrophoretic mobility of c-raf kinase that partitioned into lipid rafts compared with unstimulated cells. Cholesterol depletion of αT3-1 cells using methyl-β-cyclodextrin disrupted GnRHR but not c-raf kinase association with rafts and shifted the receptor into higher density fractions. Cholesterol depletion also significantly attenuated GnRH but not phorbol ester-mediated activation of extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) and c-fos gene induction. Raft localization and GnRHR signaling to ERK and c-Fos were rescued upon repletion of membrane cholesterol. Thus, the organization of the GnRHR into low density membrane microdomains appears critical in mediating GnRH induced intracellular signaling.

Raft localization and GnRHR signaling to ERK and c-Fos were rescued upon repletion of membrane cholesterol. Thus, the organization of the GnRHR into low density membrane microdomains appears critical in mediating GnRH induced intracellular signaling. Over the past several years it has become evident that the specificity and fidelity of intracellular signaling is partially achieved through compartmentalization of interacting proteins into discrete subcellular domains. In this regard, the plasma membrane is no exception. Of particular interest are discrete microdomains consisting of tightly packed sphingolipids and cholesterol in the exoplasmic leaflet (1Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (7941) Google Scholar). Due to this unique lipid character, these membrane microdomains are characterized by resistance to solubilization in low ionic strength detergents and a low buoyant density in sucrose gradients as compared with the “bulk” plasma membrane (2Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2588) Google Scholar). Although related in regard to lipid composition, two distinct subsets of membrane microdomains have been described based on different morphological and biochemical characteristics. The first of these, caveolae, are flask-shaped invaginations of the plasma membrane that are defined by the presence of the marker protein caveolin (3Anderson R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar, 4Razani B. Lisanti M.P. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 271: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In contrast, lipid rafts lack caveolin and are not topologically distinct from the plasma membrane (1Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (7941) Google Scholar, 5Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar). Although the molecular determinants that dictate inclusion or exclusion of proteins from lipid rafts or caveolae are not fully understood, it is evident that many of these raft-associated or caveolar proteins represent components of established intracellular signaling cascades such as G-proteins, Ras, and Src family kinases (4Razani B. Lisanti M.P. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 271: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 6Shaul P.W. Anderson R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L843-L851PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, membrane microdomains may represent a form of signaling platform that organizes efficient and specific signal transduction by facilitating interactions among co-segregated proteins such as membrane receptors and their cognate signaling proteins. Within these domains, further specificity of signaling is likely mediated by scaffolding proteins, such as caveolins and 14-3-3 proteins, which bring sequential members of a signaling cascade into direct proximity (7Okamoto T.

Often, the translocation of GPCR into membrane microdomains appears to require ligand activation; however, β-adrenergic receptor subtypes have been found distributed between both caveolin containing and bulk plasma membrane fractions (10Rybin V.O.

J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 75: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Herein we have sought to determine the membrane localization of the mammalian type I gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor (GnRHR). An atypical member of the rhodopsin-like family of GPCR, the GnRHR is located on the cell surface of pituitary gonadotropes (14Schwencke C. Okumura S. Yamamoto M. Geng Y.J. Ishikawa Y. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 75: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 15Gharib S.D. Wierman M.E. Shupnik M.A. Chin W.W. Endocr.

The binding of the hypothalamic decapeptide GnRH to the pituitary GnRHR not only stimulates but is obligatory for the synthesis and secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) (15Gharib S.D. Wierman M.E. Shupnik M.A. Chin W.W. Endocr. Rev. 1990; 11: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 16Hamernik D.L. Crowder M.E. Nilson J.H. Nett T.M. Endocrinol. 1986; 119: 2704-2710Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the absence of GnRH input to the pituitary gland, LH production and, consequently, gonadal function in mammals ceases (17Mason A.J. Pitts S.L. Nikolics K. Szonyi E. Wilcox J.N. Seeburg P.H. Stewart T.A. Science. 1986; 234: 1372-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 18Mason A.J. Hayflick J.S. Zoeller R.T. Young W.S. Phillips H.S. Nikolics K. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1986; 234: 1366-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Thus, the GnRHR represents the site that mediates the primary stimulatory input to gonadotrope cells. Upon ligand activation, it is well established that agonist-occupied GnRHR couples to Gαq/11 leading to stimulation of phospholipase C, formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), elevation of intracellular free calcium and activation of one or more isoforms of protein kinase C (PKC) (19Stanislaus D. Janovick J.A. Brothers S. Conn P.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 738-746PubMed Google Scholar, 20Kaiser U.B. Conn P.M. Chin W.W. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 46-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). These early events underlie GnRH activation of multiple mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades including p38 MAPK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) (21Naor Z. Benard O. Seger R. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 11: 91-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). ERK activation by GnRH is dependent on both PKC and calcium influx via L-type voltage-gated calcium channels and proceeds through a c-raf kinase-dependent mechanism (21Naor Z. Benard O. Seger R. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 11: 91-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 22Mulvaney J.M. Roberson M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14182-14189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Although classified as a member of the rhodopsin class of GPCR, the GnRHR displays several unique structural characteristics of which perhaps the most striking is an extremely short C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of only 1–2 amino acids (23Sealfon S.C. Weinstein H. Millar R.P. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 180-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 24Stojilkovic S.S. Reinhart J. Catt K.J. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 462-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). In more prototypical GPCRs, this domain is quite extensive and contains phosphorylation sites for G-protein-coupled receptor kinases, second messenger-regulated kinases (such as protein kinase A) and casein kinases. In some GPCRs, these phosphorylation events allow for interaction with β-arrestins and subsequent receptor deactivation and internalization (25Zhang J. Ferguson S.S. Barak L.S. Aber M.J. Giros B. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Receptors. Channels. 1997; 5: 193-199PubMed Google Scholar, 26Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with the lack of an extensive C-terminal tail, the GnRHR does not appear to undergo arrestin-dependent internalization or desensitization (27Willars G.B. Heding A. Vrecl M. Sellar R.

Endocrinol. 2000; 141: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In fact, the GnRHR has been considered as a naturally occurring internalization resistant mutant (28McArdle C.A. Davidson J.S. Willars G.B. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thus, the GnRHR is both structurally and functionally unusual. Given its unique structural and functional attributes we sought to assess the membrane distribution of the mammalian GnRHR. Herein, we find that unlike other GPCRs, such as the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor and B2 bradykinin receptor that are uniformly distributed throughout the plasma membrane and localize to caveolae only in the presence of ligand (11Feron O. Smith T.W. Michel T. Kelly R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17744-17748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 13de Weerd W.F. Leeb-Lundberg L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17858-17866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), the GnRHR constitutively resides in a low density membrane microdomain in both the gonadotrope-derived αT3-1 cell line that expresses the endogenous GnRHR gene (32Windle J.J. Weiner R.I. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. We also find that c-raf kinase, a target of GnRHR signaling, is constitutively, but not exclusively, localized to low density membrane fractions. Furthermore, disruption of raft organization by cholesterol depletion attenuates GnRHR activation of ERK and induction of c-fos gene expression suggesting that the sublocalization of GnRHR and c-raf kinase to membrane microdomains is functionally significant.

Cell Culture—αT3-1 cells were maintained in high glucose DMEM from Mediatech (Herndon, VA) containing 2 mm glutamine, 100 units of penicillin/ml, 100 μg streptomycin/ml, 5% fetal bovine serum, and 5% horse serum. CHO cells were maintained in high glucose DMEM containing 2 mm glutamine, 100 units of penicillin/ml, 100 μg of streptomycin/ml, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 1× nonessential amino acids from Invitrogen. All cells were grown in 5% CO2 at 37 °C in a humidified environment. Construction of Hemagglutinin-tagged GnRH Receptor Attached to Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)—The construction of the GnRHR-GFP fusion cDNA has been described (33Nelson S. Horvat R.D. Malvey J. Roess D.A. Barisas B.G. Clay C.M. Endocrinol. 1999; 140: 950-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). A 2-step PCR procedure was used to attach the HA sequence (YDYDVPDYA) immediately adjacent to the initiation codon of the GnRHR-GFP fusion protein. Appropriate placement of the HA tag was confirmed by sequencing. Preparation of Cholesterol-loaded CD (CLCD)—Cholesterol (200 mg) was dissolved in 1 ml of chloroform. In a separate beaker, 1 g of CD was dissolved in 2 ml of methanol. A 0.45-ml aliquot of the cholesterol solution was added to the CD solution, stirred, and then placed under a stream of nitrogen gas until the chloroform and methanol evaporated. The resulting crystals were allowed to dry for 24 h and stored in glass at room temperature. A CLCD working solution was prepared by adding 50 mg of the CLCD crystals to 1 ml of serum-free DMEM, warming to 37 °C, and vortexing briefly. Detergent-free Preparation of Lipid Rafts—αT3-1 cells, a generous gift from Dr. Pam Mellon, or CHO cells were grown to confluence in 150-mm tissue culture plates.

Cells were resuspended in PBS to a final volume of 1 ml and administered either vehicle or 100 nm GnRH for 15 min at 37 °C followed by centrifugation for 3 min at 300 × g. Detergent-free lipid raft preparations were conducted according to Song et al. (34Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). The cell pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of 500 mm sodium carbonate buffer (pH 11). Cells were then homogenized using a Wheaton loose fitting glass dounce homogenizer (10 strokes) followed by sonication (three 20-s bursts) on ice using a Branson 250 sonicator. Two ml of 90% sucrose prepared in MES buffer (20% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 25 mm MES, pH 6.5) was added to the homogenized samples yielding a final concentration of 45% sucrose in a total volume of 4 ml. A discontinuous sucrose gradient was then layered on the surface of the 45% fraction (4 ml of 35% sucrose, 4 ml of 5% sucrose in MES containing 250 mm sodium carbonate). Isopycnic ultracentrifugation was then carried out at 38,000 rpm using a SW 41 rotor for 16–20 h at 4 °C. Following ultracentrifugation, 645-μl samples were collected representing a total of 18 fractions. Proteins that migrated to the interface of the 5 and 35% gradients (approximately fractions 6 and 7) were considered to be raft-associated (34Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M.

CD treated samples were prepared as above with the exception that αT3-1 cells in monolayer were incubated in 12 ml of serum-free medium containing 2% CD for1hat37 °C followed by2hof serum-free medium alone. Control cells were incubated in serum-free medium without CD over the same time period. For the cholesterol repletion studies, αT3-1 cells were treated with CD as described above. Following CD treatment, cells were washed with PBS and incubated in 12 ml of serum-free medium containing 1 mg/ml of CLCD for 2 h. Raft samples were then prepared as described above. Triton X-100 Preparation of Lipid Rafts—αT3-1 or CHO cells were grown to confluence in monolayer cultures. Cells were harvested and treated with hormone as in the detergent-free raft method. Following centrifugation, the cell pellet was resuspended to a final volume of 500 μl in PBS. 500 μl of 2× Triton X-100 lysis buffer (0.2% Triton X-100 prepared in MES buffer) was then added to yield a final 1× lysis buffer concentration (Triton X-100 concentration = 0.1%). Cells were then homogenized either by 3 passes through a 30-gauge needle or douncing. PBS was added to adjust the final volume to 1 ml. 1 ml of 80% sucrose (in MES buffer) was added to the samples to yield a 40% sucrose fraction in a final volume of 2 ml. A discontinuous sucrose gradient was then prepared by layering 2 ml of each sucrose fraction (80, 60, 40%-containing sample, 30, 20, and 10%) in a 12-ml ultracentrifuge tube (35Field K.A. Holowka D.

Samples were subjected to isopycnic ultracentrifugation in an SW 41 rotor for 20 h at 37,000 rpm. Following ultracentrifugation, 645-μl samples were collected representing a total of 18 fractions and Western analyses were conducted. In Fig. 7, whole mouse pituitaries were obtained following euthanasia, minced, rinsed free of blood in PBS, and lysed in a 0.1% Triton lysis buffer (in MES) by douncing. Whole pituitary lysates were adjusted to 45% sucrose and layered within a sucrose gradient (45 (sample), 35, and 5% sucrose) in a total volume of ∼3.5 ml to reduce a potential dilution effect of the larger gradients described for αT3-1 and CHO cells. These samples were centrifuged as described above in an SW50.1 rotor. Following centrifugation, gradients were harvested in 10 equal fractions.Fig. 2Stably transfected GnRHR localizes to low density membrane microdomains in CHO cells.

The resolved proteins within the gel were visualized by silver staining using methods as described by Blum et al. (36Blum H. Beier H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3721) Google Scholar). Identical results were obtained using gradient fractions from αT3-1 lysates generated from 0.1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer (data not shown). Western Blots—Samples representing individual fractions were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (acrylamide:bis-acrylamide ratio of 29:1) and electroblotted to nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). In Fig. 5B, SDS-PAGE was carried out using a 37.5:1 acrylamide:bis-acrylamide ratio to favor the separation of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated c-raf kinase. Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dried milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) or TBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST). Anti-GnRHR antibody (1:500 dilution in 5% milk) was incubated for 8 h at 4 °C on an orbital shaker. Blots were washed for 30 min (3 washes × 10 min) with TBS and then incubated with anti-goat HRP (1:5,000) for 2 h. Anti-Gαq/11 antibody was used at a 1:500 dilution for 2 h at room temperature followed by washing with TBS and incubation with anti-rabbit HRP (1:5,000) for 2 h. Anti-HA and anti-flotillin antibodies were used at a 1:1,000 dilution with an incubation time of 1 h. Blots were washed and then incubated with a 1:10,000 dilution of anti-mouse HRP for 1 h at room temperature. Anti-c-raf, b-raf, and H+-ATPase antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:1,000 and incubations were overnight at 4 °C. Blots were washed in TBST and then incubated with a 1:5,000 dilution of anti-rabbit HRP for 2 h at room temperature. Anti-caveolin-1, anti-tubulin, and anti-pan caveolin were used at a 1:2,000 dilution with a 1:10,000 dilution of the appropriate secondary antibody for 1 h. All blots were washed for 60 min (6 × 10 min) with TBS or TBST after secondary antibody and then visualized by chemiluminescence using either Pierce SuperSignal or PerkinElmer Western Lightening reagents. ERK and c-Fos Activation Assays—Monolayers of αT3-1 cells in 6-well tissue culture plates were subjected to 1 of 3 treatments. First, control cells were washed with PBS and then incubated with 1 ml of serum-free medium for 3 h. Second, for cholesterol depletion, cells were washed with PBS and incubated with 1 ml of serum-free medium containing 2% CD for 1 h. Cells were then washed with PBS and incubated for2hin serum-free medium. Third, for cholesterol repletion, cells were washed with PBS and administered 1 ml of 2% CD in serum-free medium for 1 h. Cells were then washed with PBS and incubated for 2 h in serum-free medium containing 1 mg/ml CLCD. Following the 3-h treatment protocols, cells were washed with PBS and serum-free medium was replaced containing either 0 or 100 nm GnRH. After a 30- or 60-min incubation, cells were washed in ice cold PBS and lysed in RIPA buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. 6× sample buffer (300 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 60% glycerol, 30 mm dithiothreitol, 6% SDS) was added to yield a final concentration of 1×. Aliquots (15 μl) of each lysate were heated to 95 °C for 5 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western analysis. Nitrocellulose membranes were incubated for 2 h with either a phospho-ERK or c-Fos antibody (both at 1:1,000 dilutions) followed by a 2-h incubation with a 1:2,000 dilution of HRP conjugated secondary antibody. Phospho-ERK blots were then stripped at room temperature with 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.7) heated to 50 °C for 30 min. After stripping, membranes were washed twice for 15 min with TBS and blocked with 5% milk for 1 h. Blots were then re-probed with a 1:10,000 dilution of an anti-ERK antibody that recognizes ERK-1 and ERK-2 independent of phosphorylation state. Following washing in TBS, blots were incubated with a 1:2,000 dilution of anti-rabbit HRP, and immunoreactive bands were visualized by chemiluminescence. Cholesterol Assays—αT3-1 cells were either incubated in serum-free medium alone for 3 h, cholesterol-depleted or cholesterol-depleted followed by incubation with CLCD as described under “ERK and c-Fos Activation Assays” above. At the end of the 3-h treatment period, all cells were washed and harvested in PBS. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended to a final volume of 500 μl in PBS. An equal volume of 2× lysis buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100 in MES buffer cooled to 4 °C was then added to solubilize the plasma membrane. Cholesterol content was determined using Infinity cholesterol reagent (Sigma). Briefly, lysates were diluted 1:5 with cholesterol reagent and samples were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C followed by spectrophotometric analysis (absorption at 500 nm). Cholesterol concentration was determined using a 6-point standard curve generated with known concentrations of cholesterol. To standardize cholesterol content, protein concentrations were determined using a BCA protein assay (Pierce). Data are expressed as mg of cholesterol per mg of protein. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)—CHO and αT3-1 cells were cultured to ∼60–70% confluence then scraped from dishes in ice-cold Hepes-buffered saline (HBS; pH 7.4) and washed once in HBS.

https://openalex.org/W2018578533,"deltaNp63 is overexpressed in squamous carcinomas where it is associated with proliferation and is believed to enhance cell growth by blocking p53-mediated transactivation. In normal epithelium, deltaNp63alpha protein expression is abundant in basal cells and decreases with differentiation. To explore the biological consequences of deltaNp63alpha overexpression in relation to squamous carcinogenesis, we evaluated its effect on normal squamous differentiation and p53 transactivation function in keratinocytes. Forced overexpression of deltaNp63alpha in primary murine keratinocytes in vitro inhibits morphological differentiation induced by elevated extracellular [Ca(2+)], abrogates Ca(2)(+)-induced growth arrest, and blocks expression of maturation-specific proteins keratin 10 and filaggrin. This suggests that deltaNp63 overexpression in squamous carcinomas may serve to maintain the basal cell phenotype and promote cell survival. deltaNp63alpha blocks transactivation of p53 responsive reporter constructs mediated by endogenous or exogenous p53 at 17 h postinfection, as expected. However, at 41 h, when p53-mediated transactivation is diminished, deltaNp63alpha enhances transactivation of these reporter constructs by 2.2-12-fold over control. Maximal deltaNp63alpha-induced transactivation requires intact p53 responsive elements, but is independent of cellular p53 status. This positive transcriptional function of deltaNp63alpha appears to be cell-type specific, as it is not observed in primary dermal fibroblasts or Saos-2 cells. These findings support deltaNp63alpha as a master regulator of keratinocyte differentiation, and suggest a novel function of this protein in the maintenance of epithelial homeostasis."

Here we use stereo cameras to reconstruct the movements in three dimensions of dragonflies (Hemianax papuensis), and show that these insects actively use motion camouflage to disguise themselves as stationary during territorial aerial manoeuvres. Deployment of this sophisticated technique by the oldest airborne predator tricks the victim's retina into perceiving the stalker as stationary even while it darts about in pursuit."
https://openalex.org/W2075725579,"Microtubules have a central role in eukaryotic cell polarity1, in part through interactions between microtubule end-binding proteins and the cell cortex2,3. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, microtubules and the polarity modulator tea1p maintain cylindrical cell shape and strictly antipodal cell growth4,5,6,7. The tea1p protein is transported to cell tips by association with growing microtubule plus ends8; once at cell tips, tea1p releases from microtubule ends and associates with the cell cortex, where it coordinates polarized growth4,6. Here we describe a cortical protein, mod5p, that regulates the dynamic behaviour of tea1p. In mod5Δ cells, tea1p is efficiently transported on microtubules to cell tips but fails to anchor properly at the cortex and thus fails to accumulate to normal levels. mod5p contains a signal for carboxy-terminal prenylation and in wild-type cells is associated with the plasma membrane at cell tips. However, in tea1Δ cells, although mod5p remains localized to the plasma membrane, mod5p is no longer restricted to the cell tips. We propose that tea1p and mod5p act in a positive-feedback loop in the microtubule-mediated regulation of cell polarity."
https://openalex.org/W2152745012,"The occurrence of pathologically stable mRNAs of proto-oncogenes, growth factors and cyclins has been proposed to contribute to experimental and human oncogenesis. In normal resting cells, mRNAs containing an AU-rich element (ARE) in their 3' untranslated region are subjected to rapid degradation. Tristetraprolin (TTP) is an RNA-binding zinc-finger protein that promotes decay of ARE-containing mRNAs. Here we report that TTP acts as a potent tumor suppressor in a v-H-ras-dependent mast cell tumor model, where tumors express abnormally stable interleukin-3 (IL-3) mRNA as part of an oncogenic autocrine loop. Premalignant v-H-ras cells were transfected with TTP and injected into syngeneic mice. TTP expression delayed tumor progression by 4 weeks, and late appearing tumors escaped suppression by loss of TTP. When transfected into a fully established tumor line, TTP reduced cloning efficiency in vitro and growth of the inoculated cells in vivo. Transgenic TTP interfered with the autocrine loop by enhancing the degradation of IL-3 mRNA with concomitant reduction of IL-3 secretion. Our data establish the ARE as an antioncogenic target in a model situation, underline the importance of mRNA stabilization in oncogenesis and show for the first time that tumor suppression can be achieved by interfering with mRNA turnover."
https://openalex.org/W2017066977,"Tiny plant fossils indicate how this frozen region once sustained huge herds of mammals. The landmass known as Beringia is an extensive region that existed during the Pleistocene epoch and included the land bridge between present-day Siberia and Alaska, now submerged beneath the Bering Strait. It must have been covered with vegetation even during the coldest part of the most recent ice age (some 24,000 years ago) because it supported large populations of woolly mammoth, horses, bison and other mammals during a time of extensive Northern Hemisphere glaciation, although the nature of this vegetation has not been determined1,2,3. Here we report the discovery of macrofossils of prairie sage (Artemisia frigida), bunch-grasses and forbs that are representative of ice-age steppe vegetation associated with Pleistocene mammals in eastern Beringia. This vegetation was unlike that found in modern Arctic tundra, which can sustain relatively few mammals, but was instead a productive ecosystem of dry grassland that resembled extant subarctic steppe communities4,5."

Additional regulation is achieved via kinase-mediated modulation of the NHE1 regulatory domain. To determine if intracellular acidosis stimulates NHE1 activity solely by the allosteric mechanism, we subjected cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVM) with native NHE1 expression to intracellular acidosis (pHi ∼ 6.6) for up to 6 min by transient exposure to NH4Cl and its washout in the presence of NHE inhibition (by zero [Na+]o or the NHE1 inhibitor cariporide) in HCO3- -free medium. After the desired duration of acidosis, NHE was reactivated (by reintroduction of [Na+]o or removal of cariporide), and the rate of recovery of pHi (dpHi/dt) was measured as the index of NHE activity. Regardless of the method used when intracellular acidosis was sustained for ≥3 min, subsequent NHE activity was significantly increased (>4-fold). Similar NHE stimulatory effects of sustained acidosis were observed in adult rat ventricular myocytes and COS-7 cells. Sustained (3 min) intracellular acidosis activated several NHE1 kinases in NRVM, in an in-gel kinase assay using as substrate a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein of the NHE1 regulatory domain. Detailed investigation of ERK and its downstream effector p90RSK, two putative NHE1 kinases, revealed time-dependent activation of both by intracellular acidosis in NRVM. Furthermore, inhibition of MEK1/2 by pretreatment of NRVM with two structurally distinct inhibitors, PD98059 (30 μm) or UO126 (3 μm), inhibited the activation of ERK and p90RSK and abolished the stimulation of NHE activity by sustained (3 min) intracellular acidosis.

NHE1 activity is regulated primarily by pHi and increases markedly in response to intracellular acidosis (3Leem C.H. Lagadic-Gossman D. Vaughan-Jones R.D. J. Physiol. 1999; 517: 159-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), and such regulation has been proposed to occur through the interaction of H+ with an allosteric modifier site (“pHi sensor”) within the transport domain (4Wakabayashi S. Bertrand B. Shigekawa M. Fafournoux P. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5583-5588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Wakabayashi S. Ikeda T. Iwamoto T. Pouysségur J. Shigekawa M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12854-12861Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests critical roles for Gly and Arg residues within transmembrane segment 11 and the adjacent intracellular loop in pHi-mediated regulation of NHE1 activity (6Wakabayashi S. Hisamitsu T. Pang T. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11828-11835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), although the precise molecular mechanism remains unclear. Additional regulation of NHE1 activity in response to various extracellular stimuli, stretch, and altered cell volume is achieved by modification of the regulatory domain, such as phosphorylation and altered interaction with accessory proteins, leading to conformational changes in the NHE1 molecule that are thought to alter the affinity for H+ of the pHi sensor (4Wakabayashi S. Bertrand B. Shigekawa M. Fafournoux P. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5583-5588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies in different cell types indicate a key role for the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade in the stimulation of NHE1 activity by extracellular stimuli, particularly by growth factors and G protein-coupled receptor agonists (7Bianchini L. L'Allemain G. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 271-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 8Gunasegaram S. Haworth R.S. Hearse D.J. Avkiran M. Circ.

ERK-mediated stimulation of NHE1 activity may occur by direct phosphorylation of the exchanger regulatory domain (10Moor A.N. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22985-22992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and/or indirectly through one or more downstream effector(s) (7Bianchini L. L'Allemain G. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 271-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). One potential such effector is the 90-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (p90RSK), which is activated by ERK-mediated phosphorylation (11Smith J.A. Poteet-Smith C.E. Malarkey K. Sturgill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2893-2898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) and has been shown to phosphorylate Ser-703 within the regulatory domain of NHE1 and thereby increase exchanger activity (12Takahashi E.

As in many other cells, NHE1 is the molecular homolog of the plasma membrane (sarcolemmal) NHE in cardiac myocytes (13Fliegel L. Dyck J.R.B. Wang H. Fong C. Haworth R.S. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 125: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), a cell type in which the relationship between pHi and sarcolemmal NHE activity is particularly steep (14Wallert M.A. Fröhlich O. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C207-C213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in adult rat ventricular myocytes, a reduction in pHi from 6.90 to 6.50 (representing a 2.5-fold increase in [H+]i) has been shown to produce an ∼7-fold increase in sarcolemmal NHE activity (14Wallert M.A. Fröhlich O. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C207-C213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although an allosteric mechanism mediated by the pHi sensor is widely accepted to underlie this stimulation of sarcolemmal NHE activity by an acute pHi reduction, the effect of the duration (cf. the extent) of intracellular acidosis on sarcolemmal NHE activity and the molecular mechanism(s) underlying any such regulation are unknown. In the present study, we present evidence that a moderate extension of the duration of intracellular acidosis (to ≥3 min) produces a marked increase in sarcolemmal NHE activity in both neonatal and adult rat ventricular myocytes. This effect appears to occur through a novel mechanism that is mediated by acidosis-induced activation of the ERK pathway, the inhibition of which also inhibits the stimulation of sarcolemmal NHE activity. Furthermore, our data suggest that this mechanism may have relevance to the regulation of plasma membrane NHE activity in non-myocyte cells also, since similar observations were made in COS-7 cells (African Green monkey kidney cells), which exhibit native NHE1 expression (15Haworth R.S.

Cardiol. 2000; 32: 1013-1023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (15Haworth R.S. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. Avkiran M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C1202-C1209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were split 1–2 days before pHi measurements were made and subsequently cultured on glass coverslips. All cultured cells were serum-starved for 24 h before use for either pHi measurement or assessment of kinase activity. Induction of Intracellular Acidosis—In all cases, intracellular acidosis was induced in cells bathed in bicarbonate-free Tyrode solution (137 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 10mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm glucose) by transient (1–4 min) exposure to 30 mm NH4Cl, as in our previous work in various cell types (8Gunasegaram S. Haworth R.S. Hearse D.J. Avkiran M. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 919-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 15Haworth R.S. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. Avkiran M. Am. J.

Yasutake M. Brooks G. Avkiran M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 321-332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). When required, the duration of intracellular acidosis was extended for 1, 3, or 6 min by washout of NH4Cl with either Na+-free Tyrode solution (Na+ replaced isosmotically with choline) or Tyrode solution containing 3 μm cariporide (a selective NHE1 inhibitor) for the desired period. Where used, the MEK1/2 inhibitors PD98059 and U0126 were added to cells 5 min before NH4Cl exposure and were present throughout the rest of the protocol. Because the MEK inhibitors were dissolved in Me2SO, the final concentration of this solvent (0.1%) was included in the appropriate solutions in the untreated groups. Measurement of pH i and NHE Activity—pHi was determined in single cells superfused with bicarbonate-free Tyrode solution by microepifluorescence using the fluorescent pH indicator carboxy-seminaphthorhodafluor-1, as we have described previously for neonatal (8Gunasegaram S. Haworth R.S. Hearse D.J. Avkiran M. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 919-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and adult (16Yasutake M. Haworth R.S. King A. Avkiran M. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 705-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) rat ventricular myocytes and COS-7 cells (15Haworth R.S. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. Avkiran M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C1202-C1209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were subjected to two consecutive acid pulses, the first of which was transient and the second either transient (in controls) or sustained for 1, 3, or 6 min. As the index of NHE activity, the rate of pHi recovery (dpHi/dt) was calculated at a fixed pHi of 7.0, during recovery from intracellular acidosis. In-gel Kinase Assay—Serum-starved cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes were incubated in Tyrode solution at 37 °C for 90 min before experiments. Cells were subjected to intracellular acidosis by exposure to NH4Cl (30 mm) for 4 min and its subsequent replacement with sodium-free solution for 0 or 3 min. Cells were then lysed in Laemmli buffer and heated, and protein samples were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.15 mg/ml GST or GST-NHE178 (prepared from Escherichia coli BL21 as described earlier (15Haworth R.S. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. Avkiran M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C1202-C1209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). After electrophoresis, the gel was washed 3 times with wash buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) containing 20% 2-propanol. After three 20-min incubations in wash buffer and two 30-min incubations with wash buffer containing 6 m guanidine-HCl, proteins were renatured overnight in wash buffer containing 0.04% Tween 20. In-gel phosphorylation was performed in assay buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) containing 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (1.85 MBq). After 60 min, the assay was terminated by transferring the gel to 5% trichloroacetic acid and 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate followed by extensive washing with the same solution to remove unincorporated 32P. The gel was then dried and subjected to autoradiography. Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in Laemmli buffer, and protein samples separated by SDS-PAGE. After transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, Western analysis was performed using a rabbit polyclonal dual phospho-specific ERK1/2 antibody or a rabbit polyclonal phospho-specific p90RSK antibody. To confirm equal protein loading, a mouse monoclonal ERK2 antibody or a mouse monoclonal p90RSK antibody was used. Statistics—Data are expressed as the means ± S.E. Intra-group comparisons were by Student's paired t test, whereas inter-group comparisons were by analysis of variance followed by the Bonferoni t test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. NHE1 Activity Is Increased by Sustained Intracellular Acidosis—To investigate the effect of the duration of intracellular acidosis on sarcolemmal NHE activity, neonatal rat ventricular myocytes were subjected to two consecutive intracellular acid pulses by transient exposure to NH4Cl, as illustrated in Fig. 1. In the control group, Na+ was present in the superfusion solution throughout NH4Cl washout (Fig. 1A). In the sustained acidosis groups, the duration of intracellular acidosis during the second acid pulse was extended to 1, 3, or 6 min by initial washout of NH4Cl with Na+-free solution (to inhibit the sarcolemmal NHE), and normal extracellular [Na+]o was subsequently reintroduced (Fig. 1, B–D, respectively). In all groups, sarcolemmal NHE activity was estimated from the rate of change in pHi (dpHi/dt) in the presence of normal [Na+]o and at an identical pHi of 7.00 (see Fig. 1), the latter to preclude any confounding effects of allosteric regulation of sarcolemmal NHE activity by pHi. As shown in Table I, there was no significant difference between the four experimental groups in basal pHi, measured before the first acid pulse (point 1 in Fig. 1A), or the extent of intracellular acidosis attained, as reflected by the minimum pHi measured upon NH4Cl washout during either the first acid pulse (point 2 in Fig. 1A) or the second acid pulse (point 3 in Fig. 1A). Comparable dpHi/dt values were obtained in all groups during recovery from the first acid pulse (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, in the control group there was no significant difference between the dpHi/dt values measured during recovery from the consecutive acid pulses, indicating the absence of a temporal increase in NHE activity (Fig. 2A). With increasing duration of intracellular acidosis during the second acid pulse, however, the dpHi/dt value was progressively increased such that this was significantly greater than that obtained during the first acid pulse in the cells subjected to 3 or 6 min of sustained acidosis (Fig. 2A). This apparent NHE stimulatory effect of sustained acidosis is more clearly illustrated in Fig. 2B, which shows the change in dpHi/dt (ΔdpHi/dt) during recovery from the second acid pulse relative to that during recovery from the first; ΔdpHi/dt was close to zero in the control group, again reflecting the absence of a temporal increase in NHE activity, but increased significantly in myocytes exposed to 3 or 6 min of acidosis during the second acid pulse. These data indicate that sarcolemmal NHE activity increases with increasing duration of intracellular acidosis.Table IBasal and minimum pHi values obtained in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes before and during consecutive acid pulsesExperimental groupBasal pHiMinimum pHi1st acid pulse2nd acid pulseControl7.35 ± 0.046.70 ± 0.046.64 ± 0.02Sustained acidosis (1 min)7.26 ± 0.026.72 ± 0.046.59 ± 0.05Sustained acidosis (3 min)7.32 ± 0.036.68 ± 0.026.55 ± 0.05Sustained acidosis (6 min)7.24 ± 0.066.71 ± 0.066.63 ± 0.04 Open table in a new tab Fig. 2Sustained intracellular acidosis stimulates sarcolemmal NHE activity in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes.

As in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes, sustained intracellular acidosis significantly increased sarcolemmal NHE activity in adult rat ventricular myocytes (Fig. 3A) and plasma membrane NHE activity in COS-7 cells (Fig. 3B). These findings indicate that the NHE stimulatory effect of sustained intracellular acidosis occurs not only in neonatal ventricular myocytes but also in adult ventricular myocytes and in non-myocyte cells with native NHE1 expression. In the experiments described above, the duration of intracellular acidosis was extended by initial washout of NH4Cl with Na+-free solution; therefore, [Na+]i depletion during this period may underlie the increased NHE activity observed on reintroduction of [Na+]o independently of the extended duration of intracellular acidosis. To address this possibility, we carried out additional experiments in which the duration of intracellular acidosis was extended by initial washout of NH4Cl in the presence of normal [Na+]o but with the addition of the NHE1-selective inhibitor HOE-642 (cariporide), whose inhibitory effect is readily reversible upon its removal from the bathing medium (19Yokoyama H. Gunasegaram S. Harding S.E. Avkiran M. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2000; 36: 534-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, extending the duration of intracellular acidosis to 3 min by this alternative method also produced a marked increase in sarcolemmal NHE activity in neonatal and adult rat ventricular myocytes and plasma membrane NHE activity in COS-7 cells. These findings indicate that, in a variety of cell types, NHE1 activity is increased markedly by extending the duration of intracellular acidosis and that altered [Na+]i is unlikely to be significant contributor to this effect. Sustained Intracellular Acidosis Activates Cellular ERK and p90RSK—To explore whether the NHE stimulatory effect of sustained intracellular acidosis might be mediated by activation of NHE1 kinase(s), we carried out an in-gel kinase assay using a GST fusion protein of the NHE1 regulatory domain (GST-NHE1) as the substrate polymerized within the polyacrylamide gel. Analysis of extracts from neonatal rat ventricular myocytes revealed increased activity of several kinases after sustained (3 min) intracellular acidosis, with prominent bands at 44 and 90 kDa (Fig. 5, left panel). These bands reflected the activity of kinases that specifically phosphorylated the NHE1 regulatory domain, since they were absent when GST alone (rather than the GST-NHE1 fusion protein) was used as the in-gel substrate (Fig. 5, right panel). Because previous work by Moor and Fliegel (10Moor A.N. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22985-22992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) suggests that the 44- and 90-kDa NHE1 kinase activities in rat myocardium represent ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase and its downstream effector p90RSK, we then focused specifically on the potential activation and NHE regulatory role of the ERK pathway in response to sustained intracellular acidosis. Fig. 6 illustrates the effects of sustained intracellular acidosis on the activity of the ERK pathway, as reflected by the phosphorylation status of ERK1/2 (Fig. 6A) and p90RSK (Fig. 6B) in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. Regardless of the method used to regulate the duration of intracellular acidosis (i.e. the washout of NH4Cl with either Na+-free or cariporide-containing solution), increasing this duration produced a progressive increase in the activity of the ERK pathway, with peak activation achieved after ≥3 min of intracellular acidosis (Fig. 6). These findings illustrate that sustained intracellular acidosis activates the ERK pathway, with a time course that is consistent with a potential causal role for the activation of this pathway in the observed stimulation of sarcolemmal NHE activity. PD98059 and UO126 Abolish the Effects of Sustained Intracellular Acidosis on ERK and NHE Activity—To probe the potential functional significance of the activation of the ERK pathway by intracellular acidosis, we investigated the consequences of pharmacological inhibition of MEK1/2, the upstream activators of ERK1/2, using the structurally distinct inhibitors PD98059 (20Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3249) Google Scholar, 21English J.M. Cobb M.H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 40-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) and UO126 (22Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A. Magolda R.L. Scherle P.A. Trzaskos J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18623-18632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2739) Google Scholar). Once again, exposure of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes to sustained (3 min) acidosis by washout of NH4Cl with Na+-free solution produced significant activation of the ERK pathway, as reflected by increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (Fig. 7A) and p90RSK (Fig. 7B). Pretreatment of the myocytes with PD98059 or UO126 produced a dose-dependent inhibition of the increase in ERK activity produced by sustained intracellular acidosis (Fig. 7), with complete abolition of such activation by either 30 μm PD98059 or 3 μm UO126 (Fig. 7). In the light of the above findings, we then used 30 μm PD98059 and 3 μm UO126 as pharmacological tools to explore the contribution of the ERK pathway to the stimulation of sarcolemmal NHE activity by sustained intracellular acidosis in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. As shown in Fig. 8, after pretreatment with vehicle (Me2SO), sustained (3 min) intracellular acidosis once again significantly stimulated sarcolemmal NHE activity. Pretreatment with the selected concentrations of PD98059 and UO126 did not alter sarcolemmal NHE activity in control cells subjected to transient intracellular acidosis (indicating the absence of an effect of these agents per se on allosteric regulation by pHi) but markedly inhibited the stimulation of sarcolemmal NHE activity by sustained intracellular acidosis (Fig. 8). These data indicate that, in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes, the stimulation of sarcolemmal NHE activity by sustained intracellular acidosis is mediated by activation of the ERK pathway. The principal findings of the work described here are as follows: (1Sardet C. Franchi A. Pouysségur J. Cell. 1989; 56: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). In myocyte and non-myocyte cell types with native expression of NHE1, sustained intracellular acidosis stimulates plasma membrane NHE activity (2Wakabayashi S. Pang T. Su X. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7942-7949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In neonatal ventricular myocytes, intracellular acidosis activates the ERK pathway, with a time course that is consistent with a mechanistic role for this activation in the stimulation of sarcolemmal NHE activity by sustained intracellular acidosis (3Leem C.H. Lagadic-Gossman D. Vaughan-Jones R.D. J. Physiol. 1999; 517: 159-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In neonatal ventricular myocytes, pharmacological inhibition of ERK activation during sustained intracellular acidosis also prevents the stimulatory effect of such acidosis on sarcolemmal NHE activity, indicating a causal link between these phenomena. In considering the effects of sustained intracellular acidosis on NHE1 activity, it is important to emphasize that in the work reported here we manipulated the duration, but not the extent, of intracellular acidosis (e.g. see Table I). Furthermore, NHE1 activity (as reflected by dpHi/dt) was determined at an identical pHi in each cell. Thus, we can be confident that the observed differences in NHE1 activity arose from the altered duration of intracellular acidosis rather than from allosteric regulation by pHi. Indeed, the stimulation of NHE1 activity by sustained intracellular acidosis appears to have arisen from an increased affinity for H+, in much the same way that a variety of extracellular stimuli increase NHE1 activity (4Wakabayashi S. Bertrand B. Shigekawa M. Fafournoux P. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5583-5588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, in the experiments in which the duration of intracellular acidosis was extended by washout of NH4Cl with Na+-free solution, an important contribution from reduced [Na+]i cannot be excluded. In sheep Purkinje fibers, Wu and Vaughan-Jones (23Wu M. Vaughan-Jones R.D. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 1131-1140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) show that pretreatment with Na+-free solution reduces [Na+]i and leads to increased sarcolemmal NHE activity after the induction of intracellular acidosis and the reintroduction of extracellular Na+. Such a reduction in [Na+]i may stimulate NHE1 activity through an increased thermodynamic driving force (via an increased transmembrane Na+ gradient) (23Wu M. Vaughan-Jones R.D. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 1131-1140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) or potentially through a Na+-sensitive G protein (24Ishibashi H. Dinudom A. Harvey K.F. Kumar S. Young J.A. Cook D.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9949-9953Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To explore the relative importance of extended exposure to intracellular acidosis versus that to Na+-free solution (which likely produces a reduction in [Na+]i), we performed additional experiments in which the duration of intracellular acidosis was extended by washout of NH4Cl with solution containing physiological [Na+] (∼140 mm) and the reversible NHE1 inhibitor cariporide. This alternative approach yielded identical results in that NHE1 activity was once again significantly increased by sustained intracellular acidosis in a variety of cell types. In this context, Bountra and Vaughan-Jones (25Bountra C. Vaughan-Jones R.D. J. Physiol. 1989; 418: 163-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) show, also in the sheep Purkinje fiber preparation, that prolonged intracellular acidosis by NH4Cl washout in the presence of a pharmacological NHE1 inhibitor has no effect on [Na+]i. The identical responses that we have obtained with two different experimental approaches strongly suggest that the responses were initiated through the common effect of these approaches on pHi (i.e. the prolonged duration of intracellular acidosis) rather than their disparate effects on [Na+]i. How does sustained intracellular acidosis lead to increased NHE1 activity? As noted above, the mode of stimulation of NHE1 activity by sustained intracellular acidosis resembles that achieved by a variety of extracellular stimuli, many of which work through the activation of protein kinases (26Avkiran M. Haworth R.S. Cardiovasc. Res. 2003; 57: 942-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Indeed, we found increased activity of several NHE1 kinases in neonatal ventricular myocytes subjected to sustained intracellular acidosis (Fig. 5). On the basis of previous work by Fliegel and colleagues (10Moor A.N. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22985-22992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 27Wang H.

Res. 2000; 86: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) on the NHE1 regulatory role of the ERK pathway in response to a variety of stimuli in multiple cell types, we focused on the potential activation and NHE1 regulatory role of this pathway in response to sustained intracellular acidosis. Two observations lead us to conclude that activation of the ERK pathway is necessary for the stimulation of NHE1 activity by sustained intracellular acidosis, at least in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. First, intracellular acidosis activated the ERK pathway in these cells (Fig. 6), with a time course that is consistent with a mechanistic role for this pathway in the stimulation of sarcolemmal NHE activity by sustained (≥3 min) intracellular acidosis. Second, pretreatment with the structurally distinct MEK inhibitors PD98059 (30 μm) and UO126 (3 μm) abolished both the activation of the ERK pathway (Fig. 7) and the stimulation of sarcolemmal NHE activity (Fig. 8) by sustained intracellular acidosis. PD98059 and UO126 inhibit the ERK pathway by inhibiting the activation and/or activity of MEK1/2, the upstream regulators of ERK1/2 (20Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3249) Google Scholar, 21English J.M. Cobb M.H. Trends Pharmacol.

Recent work by Davies et al. (30Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3926) Google Scholar) has called into question the specificity of action of several commercially available protein kinase inhibitors. Nevertheless, the same study has reconfirmed the status of PD98059 and UO126 as highly specific inhibitors of MEK1/2 that remain valuable pharmacological tools in examining the roles of the ERK pathway in cellular processes. Indeed, at a concentration of 50 μm, PD98059 was found not to inhibit a large panel of other protein kinases, including several known regulators of NHE1 activity (such as protein kinase C (31Kandasamy R.A.

Narumiya S. Barber D.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4712-4722Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (34Khaled A.R. Moor A.N. Li A. Kim K. Ferris D.K. Muegge K. Fisher R.J. Fliegel L. Durum S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7545-7557Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar)) (30Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3926) Google Scholar). These NHE1 regulatory kinases were also unaffected by UO126 at a concentration of 10 μm (30Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3926) Google Scholar). On this basis, the common inhibitory effects of both PD98059 and UO126 (each used at the minimum concentration required to abolish ERK activation by the relevant stimulus) on the stimulation of sarcolemmal NHE activity by sustained intracellular acidosis strongly suggests that in neonatal ventricular myocytes this response is mediated by the ERK pathway. The present study is the first report that illustrates the stimulatory effect of sustained intracellular acidosis on NHE1 activity in multiple cell types with native expression of this ubiquitous NHE isoform. Nevertheless, pertinent data have been reported recently with regard to the regulation of NHE3 that is expressed predominantly in epithelial cells of the kidney and the gastrointestinal tract (35Tse C.-M. Brant S.R. Walker S. Pouysségur J. Donowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9340-9346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in opossum (36Tsuganezawa H. Sato S. Yamaji Y. Preisig P.A. Moe O.W.

Yamaji Y. Preisig P.A. Moe O.W. Alpern R.J. Kidney Int. 2002; 62: 41-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) show that extended (24 h) incubation of opossum OKP cells in acidic medium increases NHE3 activity after a subsequent acute intracellular acid load, partly through increased NHE3 mRNA and protein abundance. A comparable mechanism is unlikely to be involved in our observations of increased NHE1 activity after intracellular acidosis sustained for a much shorter duration (3 min), although it may contribute to the increased NHE1 activity observed after extended (18 h) incubation of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes in acidic medium (38Dyck J.R.B. Maddaford T.G. Pierce G.N. Fliegel L. Cardiovasc. Res. 1995; 29: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Of more direct relevance to the present work is the recent report by Hayashi et al. (37Hayashi H. Szaszi K. Coady-Osberg N. Orlowski J. Kinsella J.L. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11090-11096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) that exposure of porcine LLC-PK1 cells with native NHE3 expression to sustained (3–5 min) intracellular acidosis by initial washout of NH4Cl with Na+-free solution leads to increased activity of this isoform. Depletion of [Na+]i and changes in the surface distribution or phosphorylation of NHE3 or in its interaction with the actin cytoskeleton were discounted as mechanisms underlying this stimulatory effect (37Hayashi H. Szaszi K. Coady-Osberg N. Orlowski J. Kinsella J.L. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11090-11096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), although potential indirect regulation by kinase(s) activated by sustained intracellular acidosis was not addressed. Notably, NHE3 (and to a lesser extent the partially homologous NHE5 isoform) was similarly stimulated by sustained intracellular acidosis when expressed heterologously in AP-1 cells (NHE-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells). To the contrary, there was no difference in plasma membrane NHE activity between AP-1 cells transfected with the NHE1 isoform and subjected to 1 or 3 min of intracellular acidosis (37Hayashi H. Szaszi K. Coady-Osberg N. Orlowski J. Kinsella J.L. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11090-11096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This was interpreted to reflect differential regulation of NHE3/5 versus NHE1 isoforms by the duration of intracellular acidosis (37Hayashi H. Szaszi K. Coady-Osberg N. Orlowski J. Kinsella J.L. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11090-11096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), although a possible alternative explanation is that in this cell type (unlike in neonatal ventricular myocytes; see Fig. 2) maximal stimulation of NHE1 activity was already achieved after 1 min of intracellular acidosis. It would also be of interest to determine whether intracellular acidosis induces time-dependent activation of the ERK pathway in AP-1 cells with heterologous expression of the relevant NHE isoforms, as it does in the distinct cell types with native NHE1 expression that were studied in the present investigation. Notably, in OKP cells, incubation in acidic medium has been shown to activate the ERK pathway, and this has been implicated mechanistically in the subsequent up-regulation of NHE3 activity (36Tsuganezawa H. Sato S. Yamaji Y. Preisig P.A. Moe O.W. Alpern R.J. Kidney Int. 2002; 62: 41-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The identity of the “sensor” that activates the ERK pathway and thereby leads to the stimulation of NHE1 activity after sustained intracellular acidosis is not known. It is interesting to note that in MCT cells, a mouse kidney proximal tubular cell line, the tyrosine kinase c-Src is activated rapidly (within 1.5 min) by acid incubation as well as by exposure to intracellular acidosis, with the latter induced by several means, including transient exposure to NH4Cl (39Yamaji Y. Tsuganezawa H. Moe O.W. Alpern R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C886-C893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because Src family tyrosine kinases are known to regulate ERK activity in response to a variety of stimuli in multiple cell types (40Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2149) Google Scholar), including cardiac myocytes (41Snabaitis A.K. Hearse D.J. Avkiran M. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 53: 470-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), they represent viable candidates as upstream regulators of ERK activity in response to intracellular acidosis. Contrary to this, however, ERK activation by incubation of OKP cells in acidic medium has been shown to occur through a mechanism that is independent of c-Src activation (36Tsuganezawa H. Sato S. Yamaji Y. Preisig P.A. Moe O.W. Alpern R.J. Kidney Int. 2002; 62: 41-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Future work will focus on identification of the upstream mechanisms that are responsible for ERK activation by intracellular acidosis as well as the determination of the molecular mechanism(s) downstream of ERK activation that is responsible for increased NHE1 activity in response to sustained intracellular acidosis."
https://openalex.org/W2090134577,"Expression of the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75(NTR)) in primary melanomas is associated with deeply invasive lesions. In turn, there is expression of high levels of neurotrophins at the invasion front of normal tissue adjacent to brain metastases, thus implicating this growth factor-receptor system in melanoma tumorigenesis. The neurotrophins nerve growth factor (NGF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) are potent chemotactic agents for human melanoma cells which express p75(NTR)in vitro. Here we show that the actin-bundling protein fascin specifically interacts with p75(NTR) in an NGF-dependent manner by co-immunoprecipitation and colocalization in melanoma cells that express the two proteins endogenously. In addition, expression of a fascin point mutant at the serine phosphorylation site (serine 39) regulating actin binding abrogates neurotrophin-induced migration. These results suggest a causal role for NGF-mediated dephosphorylation of serine 39 on fascin in mediating actin binding and subsequent melanoma cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W2129983577,"Lithium is highly toxic to yeast when grown in galactose medium mainly because phosphoglucomutase, a key enzyme of galactose metabolism, is inhibited. We studied the global protein and gene expression profiles of Saccharomyces cerevisiae grown in galactose in different time intervals after addition of lithium. These results were related to physiological studies where both secreted and intracellular metabolites were determined. Microarray analysis showed that 664 open reading frames were down-regulated and 725 up-regulated in response to addition of lithium. Genes involved in transcription, translation, and nucleotide metabolism were down-regulated at the transcriptional level, whereas genes responsive to different stresses as well as genes from energy reserve metabolism and monosaccharide metabolism were up-regulated. Compared with the proteomic data, 26% of the down-regulated and 48% of the up-regulated proteins were also identified as being changed on the mRNA level. Functional clusters obtained from proteome data were coincident with transcriptional clusters. Physiological studies showed that acetate, glycerol, and glycogen accumulate in response to lithium, as reflected in expression data, whereas a change from respiro-fermentative to respiratory growth could not be predicted from the expression analyses.

Physiological studies showed that acetate, glycerol, and glycogen accumulate in response to lithium, as reflected in expression data, whereas a change from respiro-fermentative to respiratory growth could not be predicted from the expression analyses. Yeast cells respond rapidly to several types of stress. Of particular interest is the response to the nutritional status of the cell. Several strategies have been used in yeast, such as glucose deprivation, glucose limitation, and the use of non-metabolizable glucose analogues (1Johnston M. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 29-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 2Rolland F. Winderickx J. Thevelein J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 310-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae lithium toxicity is dependent on the carbohydrate source used for growth (3Masuda C.A. Ramirez J. Peña A. Montero-Lomeli M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30957-30961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 4Masuda C.A. Xavier M.A. Mattos K.A. Galina A. Montero-Lomeli M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37794-37801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During growth on glucose the IC50 is 100 mm, whereas it is only 6 mm during growth on galactose. The much lower toxicity level during growth on galactose is not a consequence of osmotic stress. Galactose is metabolized in yeast, as in humans, by the Leloir pathway, and the main reason for lithium toxicity during growth on galactose is due to inhibition of phosphoglucomutase (3Masuda C.A. Ramirez J. Peña A. Montero-Lomeli M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30957-30961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), an enzyme in the Leloir pathway that reversibly converts glucose 1-phosphate (Glu-1-P) to glucose 6-phosphate (Glu-6-P). Because phosphoglucomutase is an essential protein for the galactose metabolism (5Boles E. Liebetrau W. Hofmann M. Zimmermann F.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 83-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), its inhibition impairs fermentation (3Masuda C.A. Ramirez J. Peña A. Montero-Lomeli M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30957-30961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In glucose-grown cells inhibition of phosphoglucomutase by lithium reduces the level of UDP-glucose, and consequently, the biosynthetic pathways, which use this key metabolite, are impaired (3Masuda C.A. Ramirez J. Peña A. Montero-Lomeli M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30957-30961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In response to inhibition of fermentation, protein synthesis is inhibited at the translation initiation step (6Montero-Lomeli M. Morais B.L. Figueiredo D.L. Neto D.C. Martins J.R. Masuda C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21542-21548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). During the course of our studies involving the response of cells to lithium in galactose medium we have cloned SIT4, a putative Ser-Thr phosphatase, that when overexpressed confers lithium tolerance in galactose medium (4Masuda C.A. Xavier M.A. Mattos K.A. Galina A. Montero-Lomeli M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37794-37801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SIT4 overexpression also protects translation initiation from inhibition by lithium, however, it does not alter the fermentation rate (6Montero-Lomeli M. Morais B.L. Figueiredo D.L. Neto D.C. Martins J.R. Masuda C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21542-21548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We have previously observed that SIT4 acts in a pathway not involving induction of transcription of the Na+ transporter ENA1. It does not involve extrusion of lithium from the cells, but alters the monovalent cation homeostasis and internal pH (4Masuda C.A. Xavier M.A. Mattos K.A. Galina A. Montero-Lomeli M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37794-37801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae different signals have been reported to inhibit protein synthesis such as amino acid deprivation, depletion of purine (7Hinnebusch A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 8: 6442-6446Crossref Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 8Rolfes R.J. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5099-5111Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and depletion of glucose (9Ashe M.P. De Long S.K. Sachs A.B. Mol. Biol.

Both inhibition of glycolysis by lithium and glucose deprivation lead to inhibition of protein synthesis (6Montero-Lomeli M. Morais B.L. Figueiredo D.L. Neto D.C. Martins J.R. Masuda C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21542-21548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 9Ashe M.P. De Long S.K. Sachs A.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 1: 833-848Crossref Scopus (314) Google Scholar), but only the first seems to be mediated by Sit4 as overexpression leads to recovery of protein synthesis when cells are grown in galactose in the presence of lithium but not when cells are deprived of glucose (6Montero-Lomeli M. Morais B.L. Figueiredo D.L. Neto D.C. Martins J.R. Masuda C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21542-21548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These results suggest that each phenomenon could induce a different mechanism. Glucose sensing and repression are complex phenomena that involve different pathways, including several transcriptional regulators that lead to control of utilization of alternative carbon sources, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and respiration (1Johnston M. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 29-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 11Özcan S. Johnston M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 554-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

In this work we have studied both the transcriptional and proteomic response of galactose grown cells to lithium, which is used to treat bipolar disorder (16Schou M. Arch. Gen. Psychiatry. 1997; 54: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and therefore, therapeutically relevant concentrations of lithium (17Vaden D.L. Ding D. Peterson B. Greenberg M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15466-15471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) were used. The dynamic response of the intracellular metabolites to addition of lithium was used to correlate the response to the overall carbon metabolism. Yeast Strains—The CEN.PK113–7D (MAT a, SUC2, MAL2–8) wild type strain (18van Dijken J.P. Bauer J. Brambilla L. Duboc P. Francois J.M. Gancedo C. Giuseppin M.L. Heijnen J.J. Hoare M. Lange H.C. Madden E.A. Niederberger P. Nielsen J. Parrou J.L. Petit T. Porro D. Reuss M. van Riel N. Rizzi M. Steensma H.Y. Verrips C.T. Vindelov J. Pronk J.T. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 2000; 26: 706-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar) was used for all cultivations involving transcription analysis and analyses of extra- and intracellular metabolites, whereas the strain FY833 (MAT a, his3Δ200, ura3–52, leu2Δ1, lys2Δ202, trp1Δ63, GAL2+), obtained from Michel Ghislain, was used for measuring protein levels and glycogen content. Batch Cultivation for Measurement of Metabolites and Transcription—A preculture for the batch cultivation was inoculated with a fresh colony of CEN.PK113–7D grown from a frozen stock on solid YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% bacto-peptone, 2% glucose) (19Rose M. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). The preculture was grown at 30 °C and 150 rpm in a cotton-stopped, 500-ml Erlenmeyer flask with baffles containing 100 ml of a defined minimal media of pH 6.5 similar to that described previously (20Verduyn C. Postma E. Scheffers W.A. van Dijken J.P. Yeast. 1992; 8: 501-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar) but containing different concentrations of galactose (20 g/liter), (NH4)2SO4 (7.5 g/liter), and KH2PO4 (14 g/liter). The aerobic batch cultivation was subsequently inoculated with the exponential growing preculture to an initial concentration of 1 mg of DW/liter in a 4-liter laboratory bioreactor at 30 °C with a stirrer speed of 800 rpm and an air flow rate of 4 liter/min. pH was kept at 5.0 by automatic addition of 4 m KOH. A defined medium was used with double concentrations of all components compared with that described previously (20Verduyn C. Postma E. Scheffers W.A. van Dijken J.P. Yeast. 1992; 8: 501-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar) and contained (per liter): 30 g of galactose; 10.0 g of (NH4)2SO4; 6.0 g of KH2PO4; 1.0 g of MgSO4·7H2O; and trace metals and vitamins. 100 μl/liter antifoam (Sigma A-8436) was added to avoid foaming. Galactose was autoclaved separately and afterward added to the bioreactor together with a sterile filtrated solution containing the vitamins. The bioreactor was fitted with a cooled condenser to minimize evaporation of ethanol, and the off-gas was led to an acoustic gas analyzer (1311, Bruël & Kjær, Nærum, Denmark) to measure the concentrations of CO2 and O2. Production rates of CO2 and consumption rates of O2 were calculated as previously described (21Van Urk H. Mak P.R. Scheffers W.A. van Dijken J.P. Yeast. 1988; 4: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The culture was pulsed with 10 mm LiCl at a residual galactose concentration of 15 g/liter by addition of 1.5 m LiCl stock solution (pH 5.0). Measurement of Biomass Concentration—The concentration of biomass in the aerobic batch cultivation was determined during the cultivation on a dry weight basis by filtering a known volume of culture through a pre-weighed 0.45-μm nitrocellulose filter (Gelman Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI). The filter was washed with distilled water, dried in a microwave oven at 150 watts for 15 min, and, finally, weighed to determine its increase in dry weight. Analysis of Extracellular Metabolites—Culture samples for determination of glucose, ethanol, glycerol, and acetate concentrations were filtered through a 0.45-μm cellulose acetate filter (Osmonics, Minnetonka, MN) immediately after sampling, and the filtrate was frozen at –20 °C until further analysis. The concentrations of the metabolites were determined by high pressure liquid chromatography on an Aminex HPX-87Hm column (Bio-Rad) kept at 65 °C and eluted at 0.6 ml/min with 5 mm H2SO4. Acetate was detected spectrophotometrically by a Waters 486 turnable absorbance detector at 210 nm. Glucose, ethanol, and glycerol were detected refractometrically by a Waters 410 differential refractometer. Sampling and RNA Isolation—Samples for RNA isolation were taken from the aerobic batch cultivation by rapidly sampling 20 ml of culture into a tube with 35–40 ml of crushed ice. Hereby the temperature decreased to below 2 °C in less than 10 s. Cells were quickly pelleted (4500 rpm at 0 °C for 2 min), instantly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and thereafter stored at –80 °C. Total RNA was extracted by using the FastRNA kit, Red (BIO 101, Inc., Vista, CA) after thawing the samples on ice. Probe Preparation and Hybridization to Arrays—mRNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, cRNA synthesis and labeling, as well as array hybridization to Affymetrix yeast S98 arrays were performed as described in the Affymetrix users' manual (Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual (2000), Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Briefly, poly(A) RNA was enriched from total RNA using the Qiagen Oligotex kit and applied for double-stranded cDNA synthesis employing the SuperScript Choice transcriptase II (Invitrogen) and a poly-T primer with a T7 RNA-polymerase promoter sequence. This cDNA was then used as template for in vitro transcription (ENZO BioArray High Yield IVT kit), which amplifies the RNA pool and incorporates biotinylated ribonucleotides required for the staining procedures after hybridization. 15 μg of fragmented, biotinylated cRNA was hybridized to Affymetrix Yeast Genome S98 arrays at 45 °C for 16 h as described in the Affymetrix users' manual. Washing and staining of arrays were performed using the GeneChip Fluidics Station 400 and scanning with the Affymetrix GeneArray Scanner. Data Acquisition and Analysis of Array Images—Acquisition and quantification of array images as well as primary data analysis were performed by using the Affymetrix software package Microarray Suite version 5.0. All arrays were globally scaled to a target value of 500 using the average signal from all gene features using Microarray Suite 5.0. The Affymetrix S98 yeast microarrays contain probe sets representing 9335 distinct transcription features. By excluding all probe sets not assigned yeast open reading frame (ORF) abbreviations identified in the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) (available at genome-www.stanford.edu/Saccharomyces/) and all probe sets representing groups of genes that were already represented as singletons, 6072 probe sets remained for analysis. Data were used for all probe sets representing transcripts, called “present” by Microarray Suite 5.0, in at least one array. Genome-wide transcription analysis was performed on cells harvested immediately before (denoted 0 min in the text) and 20, 40, 60, and 140 min after addition of LiCl. From the cells harvested at 0 min the transcription analysis was performed in triplicate allowing an estimation of the standard deviation on the intensity for each gene. Genes were considered as having a changed expression if, when compared at 0 min, they had an mRNA concentration that changed 3-fold or more in at least one time point or 2-fold or more in a minimum of two time points. In addition, -fold changes were only considered if the difference in the intensity between the time point and 0 min was more than three times higher than the standard deviation calculated for each gene at 0 min. The -fold changes were calculated by using the average of the triplicate at 0 min. Gene functions were annotated in March of 2003 according to SGD (genome-www.stanford.edu/Saccharomyces/), and over-represented gene groups with common biological processes were found by using the SGD Gene Ontology Term Finder (genome-www4.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/SGD/GO/goTermFinder) and applying a cut-off of p < 0.01. Promoter analysis was performed on upstream sequences (from –800 to –1) of co-regulated genes using the web-based software Regulatory Sequence Analysis Tools (rsat.ulb.ac.be/rsat/) (22Van Helden J. Andre B. Collado-Vides J. Yeast. 2000; 16: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide analysis and dyad analysis were used to search for over-represented penta- and hexanucleotides and patterns of two 3-bp sequences spaced by 0–20 nucleotides. The relative abundance of each over-represented promoter element was determined from a new enquiry of the analyzed gene promoters and the entire set of the 6451 yeast promoters in the genome. Hierarchical clustering of transcription data was performed with log-transformed -fold changes using Gene Cluster (rana.lbl.gov/Eisen-Software.htm). The algorithm employed by Gene Cluster for hierarchical clustering is called Average Linkage as described previously (23Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13268) Google Scholar). A centered Pearson correlation was used as the distance (in metric), and the resultant dendrogram was visualized with TreeView (rana.lbl.gov/EisenSoftware.htm). Measurement of Intracellular Metabolites—The cell extracts from aerobic batch cultivations and cleanup of sugar phosphates (Gal-1-P, Glu-1-P, Glu-6-P, Man-6-P, and Fru-6-P), were obtained by applying a method described previously (24Smits H.P. Cohen A. Buttler T. Nielsen J. Olsson L. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 261: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Cell extracts were obtained using cold methanol as quenching agent and chloroform as extraction solvent. Furthermore, cleanup of sugar phosphates was done using solid-phase extraction (24Smits H.P. Cohen A. Buttler T. Nielsen J. Olsson L. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 261: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Determination of sugar phosphates was done by anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection as described previously (24Smits H.P. Cohen A. Buttler T. Nielsen J. Olsson L. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 261: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Analysis of Galactitol—The quenching and extraction were done as previously described (25Gonzalez B. Francois J. Renaud M. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1347-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) using a quenching method similar to the one described above for measurement of intracellular metabolites, except that the cell pellet was not washed before extraction of galactitol in buffered boiling ethanol. Furthermore, we used 70 mm Tricine as buffer instead of 70 mm Hepes, and the cell pellets were stored at –80 °Cin2.5 ml, 100% methanol with 70 mm Tricine. Determination of galactitol was done by anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection using 612 mm NaOH for elution and a Carbopac MA1 column (Dionex). The presence of galactitol was determined through retention time measurements and sample spiking with a galactitol standard. 35S Labeling—Yeast cells strain FY833 was grown to mid-logarithmic phase (A 600 = 1.0) on YNB-galactose medium (6.3 g/100 ml yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% galactose) supplemented with uracil, leucine, histidine, lysine, tryptophan, and adenine and incubated with 15 mm LiCl for 40 or 120 min. An aliquot of 2 ml was withdrawn, 200 μCi of [35S]methionine (200 Ci/mmol) was added, and the cells were lysed for protein expression. Analysis of Protein Expression—Protein extraction and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis were performed as previously described (26Maillet I. Lagniel G. Perrot M. Boucherie H. Labarre J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10263-10270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) using the Millipore Investigator apparatus. The radioactive gels were recorded by using a PhosphorImager and were analyzed with two-dimensional gel analysis software (Melanie II, Bio-Rad). The spot intensities were obtained in pixel units and normalized to the total radioactivity of the gel or using actin as standard. Both methods gave similar profiles. The lithium stimulation index was calculated as the ratio of spot intensity between lithium and standard conditions. The proteins reported have a stimulation index higher than 1.5 or inhibition index lower than 0.6. Proteins were identified by matching two-dimensional gels with a reference gel containing more than 450 previously identified proteins (27Vido K. Spector D. Lagniel G. Lopez S. Toledano M.B. Labarre J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8469-8474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Data presented are the mean of two independent experiments. Extraction and Analysis of Glycogen and ATP—Yeast cells (FY833) were grown to mid-logarithmic phase in YP-galactose medium to mid-logarithmic phase, and none or 15 mm lithium was added during 2 h. For analysis of glycogen, aliquots of the culture were collected by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min. Cells were immediately transferred to 80% ethanol and washed twice. They were further resuspended in 1 ml of 0.25 m Na2CO3 and incubated for 90 min at 95 °C. 0.05 ml of 3 m acetic acid and 0.7 ml of 0.2 m sodium acetate, pH 4.8, were added to a 0.2-ml aliquot of this extract. 2 units of amyloglucosidase (Sigma) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 22 h at 37 °C. Afterward, samples were boiled during 5 min, and glucose was assayed with a commercial glucose oxidase-peroxidase-coupled assay (Doles reagents, Brazil). For analysis of intracellular ATP, cells were collected by vacuum filtration in a 0.45-μm Millipore filter and rapidly transferred to 1 ml of 6% perchloric acid. The solution was neutralized with KOH, and ATP was determined by the development of NADH using an enzymatic assay based on coupling of hexokinase and glucose-6-phoshate dehydrogenase (Sigma). Genome-wide Transcription Analysis of LiCl-pulsed Galactose-grown S. cerevisiae—The prototrophic wild type strain CEN.PK113–7D was grown on a minimal media. This growth condition was chosen to avoid addition of various amino acids that could affect transcription of genes involved in the amino acid metabolism. At a residual galactose concentration of 15 g/liter the exponential growing culture was pulsed with LiCl to a concentration of 10 mm, because lithium in this concentration range has been shown to strongly affect galactose grown cells (4Masuda C.A. Xavier M.A. Mattos K.A. Galina A. Montero-Lomeli M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37794-37801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We harvested cells for genome-wide transcription analysis immediately before (denoted 0 min in the text) and 20, 40, 60, and 140 min after addition of LiCl. Three-cell samples were harvested at 0 min to get a precise estimation of the gene expression at this time point and assess the variance of each gene. We then defined genes that had changed expression from a set of arbitrary selected criteria described under “Experimental Procedures.” The addition of lithium had an immediate and drastic effect on the specific growth rate, substrate uptake, metabolite production, and gene expression. Of the 5723 ORFs measured as being expressed in at least one of the time points, 1390 ORFs were identified as having a changed mRNA level after addition of LiCl to the culture. A cluster analysis identified two main clusters (see supplementary material available at www.cpb.dtu.dk/data/licl.html for the full data set) one with 664 down-regulated genes and one consisting of 725 up-regulated genes during one or several of the four sampled time points according to the definitions used. LiCl-pulse Changed the Metabolism from Respiro-fermentative to Respiratory—Addition of LiCl led to a halt in the formation of ethanol (Fig. 1), which could be explained by a lower glycolytic flux. However, the presence of lithium did not have any detectable repressing effect on genes encoding enzymes in the central carbon metabolism, but it led to increased expression of several genes in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and the pentose phosphate pathway (Fig. 2). Concomitantly, a dramatic drop in the specific production rate of CO2 (see Fig. 3) was observed, but the consumption of O2 and transcription of genes in oxidative phosphorylation were not negatively affected by lithium. The CO2 yield on galactose during the first 6 h of the lithium pulse was unchanged, which is explained by a decrease in the specific galactose uptake rate (see Table I). The ratio between the production rate of CO2 and consumption rate of O2 was 4.09 before the pulse, and it diminished to 1.2 after lithium addition showing that cells changed from respiro-fermentative growth to respiratory growth (Table I).Fig. 2Modifications in gene expression after addition of 10 mm LiCl.

We observed that the glycerol synthesis genes (GPD1, GPD2, and HOR2) are up-regulated 2- to 5-fold in response to lithium, which is reflected in an increased yield of glycerol on galactose (Table I). This indication of a lithium-induced stress response was further supported by the observed up-regulation of the genes, which encode two of the cytosolic acetate-synthesizing enzymes Ald2 and Ald3 (see Fig. 2). ALD2 and ALD3 have active stress response elements (STREs) in their promoters and are both induced in response to osmotic stress and diauxic shift"

Direct transfer of isoprenylated RhoA to YopT and RhoA modification could be reconstituted in vitro by guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate loading of a recombinant RhoA·GDI-1 complex. Finally, in macrophages infected with a Yersinia strain selectively translocating YopT podosomal adhesion structures required for chemotaxis as well as phagocytic cups mediating uptake of yersiniae were disrupted. These findings indicate that bacterially translocated YopT acts on membrane-bound and GDI-complexed RhoA but not Rac or CDC42, and this is sufficient for disruption of macrophage immune functions.

Pathogenic Yersinia species, which comprise Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and Yersinia pestis, carry a virulence plasmid (pYV) harboring genes for (i) a protein type III secretion system (TTSS), 1The abbreviations used are: TTSS, type III secretion system; Yops, Yersinia outer proteins; GDI, guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate; ERM family, ezrin-radixin-moesin family; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; GDPβS, guanyl-5′-yl thiophosphate; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cells; GST, glutathione S-transferase.1The abbreviations used are: TTSS, type III secretion system; Yops, Yersinia outer proteins; GDI, guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate; ERM family, ezrin-radixin-moesin family; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; GDPβS, guanyl-5′-yl thiophosphate; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cells; GST, glutathione S-transferase. (ii) a set of up to six effector proteins ( Yersinia outer proteins (Yops)) and (iii) regulators for gene expression and Yop secretion (1Cornelis G.R. Boland A. Boid A.P. Geuijen C. Iriarte M. Neyt C. Sory M.P. Stainier I. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1315-1352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon contact with target cells, yersiniae employ their TTSS to translocate six effector Yops (YopH, YopO/YpkA, YopP/YopJ, YopE, YopM, and YopT) into the cytoplasm. These Yops interfere with a variety of cell functions including adhesion, phagocytosis, superoxide anion release, and cytokine secretion and impair the balance of survival versus apoptosis (1Cornelis G.R. Boland A. Boid A.P. Geuijen C. Iriarte M. Neyt C. Sory M.P. Stainier I. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1315-1352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Cornelis G.R. Wolf-Watz H. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Remarkably, at least three of these Yops, namely YopE, YopT, and YopO/YpkA, affect cell function by modulating the activity of Rho family GTP-binding proteins (3Aepfelbacher M. Heesemann J. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2001; 291: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 4Juris S.J. Dixon J. Cell. Microbiol. 2002; 4: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Rho GTP-binding proteins constitute ideal targets for pathogens because they are crucial regulators of the actin cytoskeleton as well as control cell cycle, intracellular vesicle transport, and gene transcription (5Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 2: 241-255Crossref Scopus (1672) Google Scholar, 6Symons M. Settleman J. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 415-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 7Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2094) Google Scholar). Most Rho family proteins are molecular switches that are “on” when bound to GTP and “off” when bound to GDP. In the GTP-bound state Rho proteins associate with and stimulate a variety of effector proteins, which include protein kinases, lipid kinases, and multidomain scaffolds (5Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 2: 241-255Crossref Scopus (1672) Google Scholar). The GDP/GTP cycling of Rho GTPases is regulated by (i) their intrinsic GTPase activity, (ii) GTPase-activating proteins, which greatly increase the intrinsic GTPase activity, and (iii) guanine nucleotide exchange factors, which promote the exchange of GTP for bound GDP. Furthermore, binding to the guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI) shields the hydrophobic isoprenoid moiety at the C terminus of Rho GTPases and thereby allows their cytosol/membrane cycling. GDI also “freezes” Rho GTPases in their actual guanine nucleotide bound state (GDP or GTP) and blocks their interaction with other regulators and effectors (8Olofsson B. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 9Sasaki T. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Currently available data suggest that release of Rho GTPases from GDI is promoted by diverse molecules, including phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2), proteins of the ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) family, and unsaturated fatty acids as well as by GDI phosphorylation (10Chuang T.H. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26206-26211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Mehta D. Rahman A. Malik A.B. J. Biol.

Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It has been intriguing to learn that many bacterial toxins and modulins exploit the regulatory mechanisms of Rho GTPases for their own purposes (13Aktories K. Schmidt G. Just I. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 2000; 381: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). For instance, YopE of Yersinia inactivates Rho, Rac, and CDC42 in vitro by acting as a GTPase-activating protein (14von Pawel-Rammingen U. Telepnev M.V. Schmidt G. Aktories K. Wolf-Watz H. Rosqvist R. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 737-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 15Andor A. Trülzsch K. Essler M. Wiedemann A. Roggenkamp A. Heesemann J. Aepfelbacher M. Cell. Microbiol. 2001; 3: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Interestingly, when YopE is injected into cells by yersiniae, it is remarkably specific, inactivating selectively Rac-mediated signal pathways (15Andor A. Trülzsch K. Essler M. Wiedemann A. Roggenkamp A. Heesemann J. Aepfelbacher M. Cell. Microbiol. 2001; 3: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that YopT of Yersinia induces covalent modification and inactivation of RhoA, as demonstrated by a more acidic isoelectric point of RhoA and its release from membranes (16Zumbihl R. Aepfelbacher M. Andor A. Jacobi C.A. Ruckdeschel K. Rouot B. Heesemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29289-29293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Subsequently, Shao et al. (17Shao F. Merritt P.M. Bao Z. Innes R.W. Dixon J.E. Cell. 2002; 109: 575-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) provide conclusive evidence that YopT is a cysteine protease removing the C-terminal isoprenoid group of Rho, Rac, and CDC42. It was demonstrated biochemically that YopT cleaves just before the C-terminal cysteine, to which the isoprenoid moiety is linked (18Shao F. Vacratsis P.O. Bao Z. Bowers K.E. Fierke C.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 904-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of YopT in a cell infection model. We show that bacterially injected YopT localizes to cellular membranes, from which it releases RhoA but not Rac or CDC42. YopT also specifically releases RhoA from GDI and thereby traps it in the cytosol. These YopT effects lead to disruption of actin structures required for phagocytosis and chemotaxis of macrophages. Materials and Proteins—The expression plasmids for GST-YopT and GST-YopTC139S were generous gifts of Dr. J. Dixon and F. Shao (University of Michigan). GST-YopT and GST-YopTC139S were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads as described (17Shao F. Merritt P.M. Bao Z. Innes R.W. Dixon J.E. Cell. 2002; 109: 575-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Purity of GST proteins was checked by SDS/PAGE, and protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin as the standard. For production of recombinant RhoA·GDI complex the cDNAs of human RhoA and bovine RhoGDI (GenBank™ accession numbers X05026 and X52689) were ligated into the baculovirus transfer vector pVL1393. Recombinant baculoviruses were produced as described (19Illenberger D. Stephan I. Gierschik P. Schwald F. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 167-177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant RhoA/RhoGDI heterodimers were produced by coinfection of Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells with recombinant baculoviruses encoding human RhoA and bovine RhoGDI, respectively. The soluble complex was purified by sequential chromatography on Superdex 75 prep grade and Mono Q (Amersham Biosciences) (19Illenberger D. Stephan I. Gierschik P. Schwald F. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 167-177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fractions were assayed for their reactivity with polyclonal antibodies reactive against RhoA (sc-179, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany) and RhoGDI (sc-359, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) on immunoblots. The purity of the heterodimer was at least 90%, as judged by analysis on silver-stained SDS-PAGE gels. Yersinia Strains—Yersinia strains used in this study are listed in Table I. WAC(pYVO8)/WA-314, WAC(pYVO8)ΔT, WAC(pYVO8)ΔT+T, and WAC(pYLCR) were described in detail elsewhere (15Andor A. Trülzsch K. Essler M. Wiedemann A. Roggenkamp A. Heesemann J. Aepfelbacher M. Cell.

To generate WAC(pYLCR+T), the sycT/yopT gene fragment of pYVO8 from Y. enterocolitica was amplified by PCR using primers 5′-CGCGGATCCACGCTCCGACGCTATCAACAT-3′ and 5′-CGCGGATCCCCCGACCGCATTTACCCATTT-3′. The PCR fragment was subcloned into the BamHI site of pACYC184, resulting in pACYC YopT/SycT, and this construct was transferred into WAC(pYLCR) by conjugation as described previously (20Heesemann J. Gross U. Schmidt N. Laufs R. Infect. Immun. 1986; 54: 561-567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yersiniae were grown under the appropriate antibiotic selection, 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 50 μg/ml spectinomycin for WAC(pYVO8)ΔT+T and WAC(pYLCR+T) and 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol for WAC(pYLCR) and WAC(pYVO8)ΔT.

Cells harvested from human umbilical cords were seeded onto gelatin-coated plastic culture flasks and cultured in endothelial cell growth medium containing endothelial cell growth supplement and 2% fetal bovine serum (PromoCell, Heidelberg, Germany). For actin staining, HUVEC were plated at a density of 2 × 104 cells/cm2 onto gelatin-coated glass coverslips and grown for 2–3 days. Primary human macrophages were isolated and cultivated as described previously (23Wiedemann A. Linder S. Grassl G. Albert M. Autenrieth I. Aepfelbacher M. Cell. Microbiol. 2001; 3: 693-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium, 10% fetal bovine serum in plastic culture flasks at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. For cell infection yersiniae were grown overnight in Luria Bertani (LB) medium at 27 °C under appropriate antibiotic selection. Shortly before infection, HeLa cell growth medium was aspirated and replaced by prewarmed LB medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum without antibiotics. Yersiniae in LB medium were added to HeLa cells for 2–3 h at a multiplicity of infection of 50–100. HUVEC and human macrophages on glass coverslips were infected for 2 h by the addition of yersiniae to the respective cell growth medium followed by centrifugation (115 × g, 37 °C, 3 min) to obtain a multiplicity of infection of 50–100. Invasin-coated latex beads were prepared and attached to the human macrophages as described previously (23Wiedemann A. Linder S. Grassl G. Albert M. Autenrieth I. Aepfelbacher M. Cell. Microbiol. 2001; 3: 693-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Microinjection, Actin, and Bacterial Staining—Microinjection was performed using transjector 5246 (Eppendorf, Germany) and a Compic Inject micromanipulator (Cell Biology Trading, Hamburg, Germany). GST-YopT was injected at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. Cells were incubated for 1 h post-injection. Control injections were performed with GST alone, and injected cells were identified by detection of coinjected rat IgG (5 mg/ml) with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rat IgG antibody (both from Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). To double-stain actin and bacteria, infected HUVEC on glass coverslips were stimulated with thrombin (1 unit/ml for 2 min), fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, permeabilized for 5 min in ice-cold acetone, and airdried. Unspecific binding sites were blocked for 10 min with PBS/pH 7.4, 1% bovine serum albumin, and cells were reacted with rabbit polyclonal anti-Myf antibody (1:500) for 45 min and incubated for 30 min with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (1:100; Molecular Probes) and rhodamine phalloidin (1:20; Molecular Probes) as described (15Andor A. Trülzsch K. Essler M. Wiedemann A. Roggenkamp A. Heesemann J. Aepfelbacher M. Cell. Microbiol. 2001; 3: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Microinjected or infected human macrophages on glass coverslips were stained for actin using rhodamine phalloidin as described (23Wiedemann A. Linder S. Grassl G. Albert M. Autenrieth I. Aepfelbacher M. Cell. Microbiol. 2001; 3: 693-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Coverslips were mounted in Mowiol (Calbiochem) containing 1,4-diazobicyclo [2,2,2]-octane (DABCO) as an antifading agent. All steps were performed with 3 washes in PBS, pH 7.4, 1% bovine serum albumin between antibody incubations and before mounting in Mowiol. Samples were examined with a Leitz DM fluorescence microscope and recorded as digital images using a spot camera (Visitron Systems, Puchheim, Germany). Cell Fractionation and in Vitro Assay for Membrane Release of Rho GTPases—Control or infected HeLa cells or HUVEC were recovered by scraping, washed once with ice-cold PBS, pH 7.4 and once with ice-cold buffer A containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, Complete protease inhibitors (1 tablet for 50 ml; Roche Applied Science), and disrupted using a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 400 × g to remove cellular debris. The remaining homogenate was centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 × g in a TLA-100 bench-top centrifuge (Beckman Instruments). All procedures were performed at 4 °C. The supernatant, containing the cytosolic fraction, and the pellet, containing the crude membrane fraction, were snap-frozen and stored at –80 °C. Protein contents of cytosolic and membrane fractions were measured by Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin as standard. To determine the membrane/cytosol distribution of translocated YopT, cells were infected with WAC(pYLCR+T) for 2 h followed by washing and further incubation with 100 μg/ml gentamicin for 1 h. Thereafter, cells were treated with 100 μg/ml of proteinase K (Sigma) in RPMI 1640 medium for 15 min at 37 °C following an established protocol (24Collazo C.M. Galan J.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 747-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Cells detached during the proteinase K treatment were collected by centrifugation, and cell fractionation was performed as described above. For testing membrane release of Rho GTPases in vitro, HeLa cell membranes (200-μg aliquots) were washed once in buffer A, resuspended in the same buffer, and incubated with 2 μg of GST-YopT or GST-YopTC139S for 30 min at 37 °C. The membrane suspension was centrifuged at 100,000 g for 30 min, and the resulting pellet and supernatant were subjected to anti-RhoA Western blot. Non-denaturing Gel Electrophoresis—Samples of HeLa cytosol (10 μl, 20–100 μg of protein) in buffer A were added to 2 μl of loading buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50% glycerol, bromphenol blue). Gels (6% of a 37.5:1 solution of acrylamide:bisacrylamide, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mm NaCl) were prerun for 30 min at a constant voltage of 80 V using 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mm NaCl as running buffer. Samples were applied to gels and run for 150 min at 80 V. SDS/PAGE and Western Blot—Protein samples were separated by 12% SDS/PAGE and transferred by semidry blotting onto polyvinylidene fluoride membrane for 1 h at 1.2 mA/cm2. Proteins separated by non-denaturing gels were transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes for 1.5 h at 5 mA/cm2 using a tank blot apparatus. The polyvinylidene fluoride membrane was blocked overnight in PBS, pH 7.4, 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween 20 at 4 °C. Membranes were developed for 1 h with one of the following primary antibodies: mouse anti-RhoA (1:1000; 26C4, Santa Cruz, Heidelberg, Germany); mouse anti-Rac1 (1:1000; BD Biosciences); rabbit anti-RhoGDI-1 (1: 1000; Santa Cruz); mouse anti-CDC42Hs (1:1000; BD Biosciences); rabbit anti-YopE (1:1000 (15Andor A.

Secondary antibodies were anti-mouse- or anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (1:5000; Amersham Biosciences) and were applied for 1 h. Detection was carried out using the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). Gel Filtration Chromatography—Cytosol of HeLa cells containing 4–17 mg of protein in 200 μl of buffer A (see above) was loaded onto a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with PBS, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl. Calibration of the column was performed with gel filtration molecular weight markers (Sigma) containing bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), bovine erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), horse heart cytochrome c (12.4 kDa), and bovine lung aprotinin (6.5 kDa). The flow rate was 300 μl/min, and the fraction size was 200 μl. Approximately 10 μl of each fraction was analyzed by Western blotting. In Vitro Modification and GST Pull-down Assay Using RhoA·GDI Complex—For in vitro modification of RhoA, aliquots (3 μg/μl) of RhoA·GDI complex in buffer B containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 6 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm MgCl2, 250 mm NaCl were incubated or not with 200 μm GTPγS or GDPβS for 30 min at 25 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 mm MgCl2. Designated samples were treated with 100 μm PIP2 and 2 μg of YopT for 30 min at 37 °C. For GST pull-down RhoA·GDI complex (28 μg of protein/10 μl) was loaded or not with 200 μm GTPγS and treated or not with 100 μm PIP2 as described above. Thirty μg of GST or 100 μg of GST-YopTC139S were bound to 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 3 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol for 2 h at 4 °C and added to the samples of RhoA·GDI complex for 45 min at 37 °C. Beads were washed 5 times with PBS containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and boiled in Laemmli sample buffer, and proteins were run on polyacrylamide gels. GST pull down from cytosol was performed identically except that 1 mg of HeLa cell cytosol was used as a source for RhoA·GDI complex. A Yersinia Strain That Translocates Selectively YopT—We have previously shown that infection of cells with YopT-expressing but not with YopT-knockout Y. enterocolitica causes modification and membrane release of the GTP-binding protein RhoA (16Zumbihl R. Aepfelbacher M. Andor A. Jacobi C.A. Ruckdeschel K. Rouot B. Heesemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29289-29293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To investigate YopT in the absence of other Yops known to affect Rho GTPases, yet under conditions whereby “life-like” amounts of YopT protein are injected by the Yersinia TTSS, we constructed a Yersinia strain named WAC (pYLCR+T) that translocates YopT as sole effector (Table I). To this end, Yersinia strain WAC that had been cured of the virulence plasmid pYVO8 was recomplemented with two plasmids, one containing genes encoding the complete type III secretion and translocation machinery (lcr region) and the other carrying the genes encoding YopT and its chaperone SycT of pYVO8. To test WAC(pYLCR+T), HUVEC were infected with this strain, stimulated with thrombin, and then analyzed for formation of actin stress fibers. As control, HUVEC were infected with strain WAC(pYLCR), which expresses the complete Yersinia secretion system (TTSS) but no YopT (Table I). In HUVEC infected with WAC(pYLCR+T) stress fiber formation was completely blocked, whereas HUVEC infected with WAC(pYLCR) formed abundant stress fibers (Fig. 1). Because stress fibers are controlled by RhoA in HUVEC, we conclude that WAC(pYLCR+T) translocates functional YopT. Bacterially Translocated YopT Localizes to Cell Membranes and Extracts RhoA but Not Rac or CDC42 from the Membranes—Within most cells 5–20% of the total cellular RhoA, Rac, or CDC42 proteins are found on membranes, whereas the remaining 80–95% are cytosolic. It is well accepted that all of the cytosolic RhoA, Rac, and CDC42 molecules form tight 1:1 heterodimers with Rho GDIs. In mammals three different GDIs have been characterized and named GDI-1, -2, and -3. Of these GDI-1 is expressed ubiquitously and interacts with Rho, Rac, and CDC42 (9Sasaki T. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Although YopT has been reported to modify and release Rho, Rac, and CDC42Hs from membranes upon overexpressing of these proteins in cells, the specificity of YopT toward endogenous Rho GTPases in infected cells has not been determined (17Shao F. Merritt P.M. Bao Z. Innes R.W. Dixon J.E. Cell. 2002; 109: 575-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Furthermore it remained unclear whether YopT can also act on cytosolic, GDI-complexed Rho proteins. As a first step to answer these questions we determined the subcellular distribution of bacterially translocated YopT. HeLa cells were infected with Yersinia strain WAC(pYVO8)ΔT+T, which expresses full-length YopT fused to the N-terminal 138 amino acids of YopE in addition to wild type YopH, -O, -P, -E, and -M (16Zumbihl R. Aepfelbacher M. Andor A. Jacobi C.A. Ruckdeschel K. Rouot B. Heesemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29289-29293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In contrast to strain WAC(pYLCR+T), which is partly internalized by cells, WAC(pYVO8)ΔT+T is completely extracellular due to the concerted action of the Yops. Moreover, the tagged YopT expressed by this strain can be detected by anti-YopE antibody. WAC(pYVO8)ΔT+T-infected cells were subjected to Dounce homogenization, and the resulting membrane and cytosolic fractions were investigated by anti-YopE immunoblot. To exclude that whole bacteria or free YopT proteins adhered to the outside of the cell membrane, extracellular proteins were digested with proteinase K just before homogenization (24Collazo C.M. Galan J.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 747-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, bacterially translocated YopT could be detected in the membranes but not in the cytosolic fractions of HeLa cells and HUVEC. Next, we tested the membranes of the WAC(pYLCR+T)-infected cells for the presence of endogenous RhoA, Rac, or CDC42Hs. As described before, RhoA was absent from the membranes of infected cells. Interestingly, however, Rac and CDC42Hs remained membrane-associated (Fig. 2B). Release of endogenous Rho GTPases was also tested by adding GST-YopT to freshly prepared cellular membranes. GST-YopT fully extracted endogenous RhoA, only a minute amount of endogenous CDC42, and no Rac under the conditions used here. The catalytically inactive GST-YopTC139S did not extract RhoA (Fig. 2C). These data suggest that bacterially translocated YopT associates mostly with cell membranes from which it extracts RhoA but not Rac or CDC42. YopT Releases RhoA but Not Rac or CDC42Hs from GDI-1— To assay whether YopT releases Rho GTPases from GDI, we established an assay involving non-denaturing gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting. In this assay RhoA of the control cytosol and of the cytosol of cells infected with the YopT-deleted strain WAC(pYVO8)ΔT was detected in one band. In comparison, an upper band of RhoA representing the YopT-modified form appeared in the cytosol of cells infected with Yersinia strains translocating YopT, namely WAC(pYVO8), WAC(pYVO8)ΔT+T, or WAC(pYLCR+T) (Fig. 3A). It can be seen from the relative proportion between the lower and upper RhoA bands that WAC(pYLCR+T) and WAC(pYVO8) induced a partial (about 70%) RhoA modification, whereas WAC(pYVO8)ΔT+T modified all of the RhoA. This phenomenon is likely due to the modest overproduction of YopT by WAC(pYVO8)ΔT+T. Non-denaturing gel electrophoresis should not dissociate the tight complex between Rho GTPases and GDI. To test for comigration of RhoA with GDI-1, the anti-RhoA immunoblot of the non-denaturing gel was reprobed with anti-GDI-1 antibody. GDI-1 was detected in a lower and an upper band. The lower GDI-1 band comigrated with the lower band of unmodified RhoA, representing the cytosolic RhoA-GDI complex. However, the upper GDI-1 band did not comigrate with YopT-modified RhoA (Fig. 3A). The upper GDI-1 band did comigrate with the upper Rac band and disappeared together with Rac1 from this position upon PIP2 treatment of cytosol, suggesting that it represents a Rac1·GDi com"
https://openalex.org/W2015949150,"The atmospheres of the giant planets Jupiter and Saturn have a puzzling system of zonal (east-west) winds alternating in latitude, with the broad and intense equatorial jets on Saturn having been observed previously to reach a velocity of about 470 m x s(-1) at cloud level. Globally, the location and intensity of Jupiter's jets are stable in time to within about ten per cent, but little is known about the stability of Saturn's jet system. The long-term behaviour of these winds is an important discriminator between models for giant-planet circulations. Here we report that Saturn's winds show a large drop in the velocity of the equatorial jet of about 200 m x s(-1) from 1996 to 2002. By contrast, the other measured jets (primarily in the southern hemisphere) appear stable when compared to the Voyager wind profile of 1980-81."
https://openalex.org/W1983909864,"We recently observed that the LDL receptor-related protein 1 (LRP-1) is tyrosine phosphorylated in v-Src-transformed cells. Using a GST-fusion protein containing the cytoplasmic domain of LRP-1, we show that LRP-1 is a direct substrate for v-Src in vitro. To study LRP-1 phosphorylation in vivo, we constructed an LRP-1 minireceptor composed of the beta chain linked at the amino-terminus to a Myc epitope (Myc-LRPbeta). When expressed together with v-Src, Myc-LRPbeta becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine. Of the four tyrosine residues present in the cytoplasmic domain of LRP-1, only Tyr 63 is phosphorylated by v-Src in vivo or in vitro. Using fibroblasts deficient in Src, Yes and Fyn, we were able to show that there are multiple kinases present in the cell that can phosphorylate LRP-1. Tyrosine-phosphorylated LRP-1 associates with Shc, a PTB and SH2 domain containing signaling protein that is involved in the activation of Ras. Binding of the purified Shc PTB domain to Tyr 63 containing peptides shows that the interaction between LRP-1 and Shc is direct. We found that DAB, a PTB domain containing signaling protein that is involved in signaling by LDL receptor-related proteins in the nervous system, did not bind to full-length LRP-1. Our observations suggest that LRP-1 may be involved in normal and malignant signal transduction through a direct interaction with Shc adaptor proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2067495493,The signal transducing protein Stat3 activates gene transcription in cells in response to multiple cytokines. Constitutive activation of Stat3 has been observed in solid tumors including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Stat3 activation in cancer has been associated with autocrine stimulatory loops and is believed to convey a growth advantage to cells. We now demonstrate ligand-independent activation of Stat3 by high cell density in multiple cancer cell lines. Activation of Stat3 is associated with antiproliferative rather than proliferative conditions. Interference with cdk2 activity upregulates Stat3 phosphorylation and Stat3-directed DNA-binding activity. Our data supports a model in which Stat3 activity is partially suppressed by cdk2 in growing cells and derepressed upon cell confluence.
https://openalex.org/W2011308033,"Little is known about the origins of the giant star clusters known as globular clusters. How can hundreds of thousands of stars form simultaneously in a volume only a few light years across the distance of the sun to its nearest neighbor? Radiation pressure and winds from luminous young stars should disperse the star-forming gas and disrupt the formation of the cluster. Globular clusters in our Galaxy cannot provide answers; they are billions of years old. Here we report the measurement of infrared hydrogen recombination lines from a young, forming super star cluster in the dwarf galaxy, NGC 5253. The lines arise in gas heated by a cluster of an estimated million stars, so young that it is still enshrouded in gas and dust, hidden from optical view. We verify that the cluster contains 4000-6000 massive, hot ""O"" stars. Our discovery that the gases within the cluster are bound by gravity may explain why these windy and luminous O stars have not yet blown away the gases to allow the cluster to emerge from its birth cocoon. Young clusters in ""starbursting"" galaxies in the local and distant universe may be similarly gravitationally confined and cloaked from view."
https://openalex.org/W2051939566,"A limited number of mammalian proteins are modified by polysialic acid, with the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) being the most abundant of these. We hypothesize that polysialylation is a protein-specific glycosylation event and that an initial protein-protein interaction between polysialyltransferases and glycoprotein substrates mediates this specificity. To evaluate the regions of NCAM required for recognition and polysialylation by PST/ST8Sia IV and STX/ST8Sia II, a series of domain deletion proteins were generated, co-expressed with each enzyme, and their polysialylation analyzed. A protein consisting of the fifth immunoglobulin-like domain (Ig5), which contains the reported sites of polysialylation, and the first fibronectin type III repeat (FN1) was polysialylated by both enzymes, whereas a protein consisting of Ig5 alone was not polysialylated by either enzyme. This demonstrates that the Ig5 domain of NCAM and FN1 are sufficient for polysialylation, and suggests that the FN1 may constitute an enzyme recognition and docking site. Two other NCAM mutants, NCAM-6 (Ig1–5) and NCAM-7 (FN1–FN2), were weakly polysialylated by PST/ST8Sia IV, suggesting that a weaker enzyme recognition site may exist within the Ig domains, and that glycans in the FN region are polysialylated. Further analysis indicated that O-linked oligosaccharides in NCAM-7, and O-linked and N-linked glycans in full-length NCAM, are polysialylated when these proteins are co-expressed with the polysialyltransferases in COS-1 cells.

However, the enzymes have also been shown to differ in their preferences for oligosaccharide acceptors in the Ig5 domain of NCAM and the length of chains synthesized (36Kitazume-Kawaguchi S.

Chem. 2002; 277: 36808-36817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) suggests that the two polysialyltransferases work cooperatively to polysialylate NCAM and that they show differences in their abilities to polysialylate substrates of varying chain lengths. Early work by Kojima et al. (30Kojima N. Tachida Y. Yoshida Y. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19457-19463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) showed that while STX could polysialylate a variety of glycoprotein substrates in vitro, NCAM served as a 1500-fold better acceptor for polysialic acid than another glycoprotein, fetuin. More recent work by Angata et al. (39Angata K. Suzuki M. McAuliffe J. Ding Y. Hindsgaul O. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18594-18601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) compared the substrate specificity of PST and STX. They showed that while these enzymes could add sialic acid to free oligosaccharide acceptors, the polysialylation of oligosaccharides attached to NCAM was much more efficient. Taken together, these in vitro data suggest that the polypeptide chain of NCAM contributes to the specificity of polysialylation.The limited number of polysialylated proteins identified to date suggests that polysialylation is a protein-specific event. Only four other proteins besides NCAM have been found to be polysialylated in mammalian cells. These include the α subunit of the voltage-dependent sodium channel (40Zuber C. Lackie P. Catterall W. Roth J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9965-9971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a form of the CD36 scavenger receptor found in milk (41Yabe U. Sato C. Matsuda T. Kitajima K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13875-13880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and the polysialyltransferases themselves, which appear to autopolysialylate their own oligosaccharides (42Close B.E.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6943-6950Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Other data from our laboratory also support the idea that polysialylation is protein-specific (44Close B.E. Wilkinson J.M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 4484-4491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Using mutagenesis, we identified the oligosaccharides on each polysialyltransferase that are polysialylated, and generated catalytically active, non-autopolysialylated forms of the enzymes, PST Mut 2.3 and STX Mut 2.4.5 (44Close B.E.

Following expression of PST Mut 2.3 and STX Mut 2.4.5 alone in COS-1 cells we detected no polysialic acid using the anti-polysialic acid antibody OL.28 (44Close B.E. Wilkinson J.M. Bohrer T.J.

These results indicate that the endogenous glycoproteins expressed by COS-1 cells are not substrates for the polysialyltransferases PST and STX, and further support the notion that polysialylation is a protein-specific event.A few other carbohydrate addition/modification processes have been shown to be protein-specific including the biosynthesis of the mannose 6-phosphate recognition marker on lysosomal enzymes, which is required for enzyme trafficking to the lysosomes (46Dahms N.M. Lobel P. Breitmeyer J. Chirgwin J.M. Kornfeld S. Cell. 1987; 50: 181-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 47Kornfeld S. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), the biosynthesis of the terminal GalNAc-4-SO4 structure on the N-linked oligosaccharides of pituitary glycoprotein hormones, which is required for their clearance from the circulation (48Manzella S.M. Hooper L.V. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12117-12120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), the biosynthesis of Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharides on misfolded/unfolded glycoproteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, which mediates their interactions with the chaperones calnexin and calreticulin (49Caramelo J.J. Castro O.A. Alonso L.G. De Prat-Gay G. Parodi A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 86-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 50Parodi A.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), and the addition of O-linked fucose to epidermal growth factor repeats in proteins such as Notch, which modulates Notch signaling (51Haltiwanger R.S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In each case, the initial step in the biosynthetic pathway is believed to involve protein-protein contact between enzyme and substrate. This has been directly shown for two of these modification processes. During mannose 6-phosphate biosynthesis, the first enzyme in the two-step pathway, the N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase, recognizes a signal patch containing a specific Lys residue on the lysosomal enzyme to be modified (52Baranski T.J. Faust P. Kornfeld S. Cell. 1990; 63: 281-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 53Baranski T.J. Koelsch G. Hartsuck J.A. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23365-23372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas during the biosynthesis of GalNAc-4-SO4, the N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase recognizes an α-helical stretch of basic amino acids 6–9 amino acids NH2-terminal to the N-linked oligosaccharide to be modified (54Mengeling B.J. Manzella S.M. Baenziger J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 502-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 55Smith P.L. Baenziger J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In both cases, disruption of the site of interaction leads to an abrogation of the modification.Based on these observations, we hypothesize that α2,8-polysialylation is a protein-specific event, and that the basis for this specificity is an initial protein-protein contact between the polysialyltransferase and the glycoprotein substrate. To test this hypothesis we have chosen to evaluate the sequence requirements for NCAM polysialylation by both PST and STX. In this study, we have constructed a series of NCAM domain deletion mutants and evaluated their polysialylation by each polysialyltransferase. We found that a minimal NCAM protein consisting of the fifth immunoglobulin-like domain (Ig5), which possesses the N-linked oligosaccharides that are polysialylated in the wild type protein, and the adjacent fibronectin type III repeat (FN) are sufficient for polysialylation by each enzyme. Surprisingly, we also found that a NCAM protein consisting of only the two FN regions was polysialylated and that the polysialic acid is modifying O-linked rather than N-linked glycans. These data suggest that the first fibronectin type III repeat (FN1) of NCAM may act as an initial recognition and docking site for the polysialyltransferases, and allow us to formulate a model of protein-specific polysialylation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsTissue culture media and reagents, including Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), Opti-MEM I, Lipofectin, and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were purchased from Invitrogen Corporation (Carlsbad, CA).

Listed are the oligonucleotide primers specific for each cDNA: sNCAM, 5′-GATATCCTGCAGGTGGATATTGTTCCCAGC-3′ and 5′-TCTAGACCGGTGCTCAGGCCTGAGGTGG-3′; sNCAM-1, 5′-GATATCGAGCAGGATGCCTCCATCCACCTC-3′ and 5′-TCTAGACCGGTGCTCAGGCCTGAGGTGG-3′; sNCAM-2, 5′-GATATCGAGCAGGATGCCTCCATCCACCTC-3′ and 5′-TCTAGACCCTGCTTGATCAGGTTCACTTTAATAG-3′; sNCAM-3, 5′-GATATCCAGGACTCCCAGTCCATGTACC-3′ and 5′-TCTAGACCGGTGCTCAGGCCTGAGGTGG-3′; sNCAM-4, 5′-GATATCCAGGACTCCCAGTCCATGTACC-3′ and 5′-TCTAGACCCTGCTTGATCAGGTTCACTTTAATAG-3′; sNCAM-5, 5′-GATATCCAGGACTCCCAGTCCATGTACC-3′ and 5′-TCTAGAGCCACCTGGGCTGTGCTGGAGTATG-3′; sNCAM-6, 5′-GATATCCTGCAGGTGGATATTGTTCCCAGC and 5′-TCTAGAGCCACCTGGGCTGTGCTGGAGTATG-3′; and sNCAM-7, 5′-GATATCCAGGAGTCCTTCGAATTCATCCTTG-3′ and 5′-TCTAGACCGGTGCTCAGGCCTGAGGTGG-3′. These primers specifically introduced an EcoRV restriction site at the 5′ end and an XbaI site at the 3′ end of each cDNA. Following restriction enzyme digestion, sNCAM cDNAs were ligated into previously digested pcDNA3.1/V5-His B vector DNA. The canine pancreatic prepro-insulin signal peptide (56Kwok S.C. Chan S.J. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2357-2363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was PCR amplified (5′-GGTACCGCTAGCTTGCTTGTTC-3′ and 5′-GATATCGGATCCTCTAGAGTCAACG-3′) and subcloned into the KpnI and EcoRV sites of previously digested pcDNA3.1/V5-His B vector DNA. Membrane-associated NCAM (mNCAM) constructs were generated by the addition of the human NCAM 140 transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail to the sNCAM constructs. The tail/transmembrane domain portion of NCAM 140 was PCR amplified (5′-TCTAGAAGGGGCCATCGTGGGCATCCTC-3′ and 5′-TCTAGACCTGCTTTGCTCTCGTTCTCCTTTGTC-3′) and subcloned into the XbaI site 3′ to the sNCAM constructs. NCAM 140 was PCR amplified (5′-GATATCCTGCAGGTGGATATTGTTCCCAGC-3′ and 5′-TCTAGACCTGCTTTGCTCTCGTTCTCCTTTGTC-3′) and subcloned into the EcoRV and XbaI sites of previously digested pcDNA3.1/V5-His B vector DNA. To construct mNCAM-8, NCAM 140 was used as a template to amplify sequences encoding the carboxyl terminus consisting of the FN2, transmembrane region, and cytoplasmic tail using the following primers: 5′-GATATCCAGGATGACGGCGGCTCCCCCATC-3′ and 5′-TCTAGACCTGCTTTGCTCTCGTTCTCCTTTGTC-3′. The amplified fragment was subcloned into the EcoRV and XbaI sites of previously digested NCAM pcDNA3.1/V5-His B vector DNA (this modified vector retained the canine pancreatic proinsulin signal peptide sequences). All inserts were confirmed using the Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit.Construction of mNCAM-7 N702Q Glycosylation Mutant—The consensus glycosylation site at Asn-702 in mNCAM-7-pcDNA 3.1/V5-His B was mutated to Gln using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis system per the manufacturer's protocol (Stratagene). The primers used for the mutagenesis were 5′-CCATCCCAGCCCAAGGCAGCCCC-3′ and 5′-GGGGCTGCCTTGGGCTGGGATGG-3′. The mutation was confirmed by sequencing as described above.Transfection of COS-1 Cells with NCAM cDNAs—COS-1 cells maintained in DMEM, 10% FBS were plated on 100-mm tissue culture plates or 12-mm glass coverslips and grown in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator until 50–70% confluent. Lipofectin transfections were performed according to the protocols provided by Invitrogen Corp. Thirty microliters of Lipofectin and 20 μg of NCAM plasmid DNA in 3 ml of Opti-MEM I were used for transfection of each 100-mm tissue culture plate. Three microliters of Lipofectin and 0.5 μg of NCAM plasmid DNA in 300 μl of Opti-MEM I were used for transfection of each coverslip.Metabolic Labeling of Cells and Immunoprecipitation of NCAM Proteins—Following transfection of COS-1 cells with soluble or membrane-bound NCAM cDNAs and expression of these proteins in the cells for 18 h, 100-mm tissue culture dishes of transfected cells were incubated with cysteine/methionine-free DMEM for 1 h. After incubation, this medium was replaced with 3.5 ml of fresh cysteine/methionine-free DMEM containing 100 μCi/ml 35S-Express protein labeling mixture (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cells were incubated with the radiolabel for 1 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. After labeling, medium was removed and cells were washed, the labeled proteins were chased for either 0 (mNCAMs only) or 3 h (sNCAMs only) with 4 ml of unlabeled DMEM, 10% FBS. For the mNCAM proteins, cells were washed with 10 ml of PBS and lysed in 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer 2 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS). For the sNCAM proteins, following 3 h of chase, the cell medium was collected, debris removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant frozen overnight at –20 °C.The NCAM proteins were immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates and 3-h chase media using 2 μg of anti-V5 epitope tag antibody and protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), as previously described (57Colley K.J. Lee E.U. Adler B. Browne J.K. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17619-17622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitation beads were resuspended in 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol, heated for 10 min at 65 °C, and directly loaded into the gel wells. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on 7.5% separating, 3% stacking SDS-polyacrylamide gels (58Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled proteins were visualized by fluorography using 10% 2,5-diphenyloxalzole in dimethyl sulfoxide (59Bonner W.M. Lasky R.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 46: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (5614) Google Scholar), and gels were exposed to Kodak Bio-Max MR film at –80 °C.Precipitation and Immunoblot Analysis of NCAM Proteins from COS-1 Cells Co-expressing PST and STX Proteins—COS-1 cells plated on 100-mm tissue culture plates were co-transfected with untagged PST or STX and sNCAM or mNCAM plasmid DNAs at a ratio of 4:1, respectively (20:5 μg). Following transfection, 3 ml of transfection mixture was removed and 4 ml of DMEM, 10% FBS was added to the cells. After incubation for 18 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator, cell lysates (mNCAMs only) and cell media (sNCAMs only) were collected. Cells were washed with 10 ml"

This molecule has been shown to be responsible for the removal of the sperm-specific proteins and deposition of somatic histones onto the male pronuclear chromatin. To better understand the latter process, we have used sedimentation velocity, sedimentation equilibrium, and sucrose gradient fractionation analysis to show that the pentameric form of nucleoplasmin binds to a histone octamer equivalent consisting of equal amounts of the four core histones, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, without any noticeable preference for any of these proteins. Removal of the histone N-terminal “tail” domains or the major C-terminal polyglutamic tracts of nucleoplasmin did not alter these binding properties. These results indicate that interactions other than those electrostatic in nature (likely hydrophobic) also play a critical role in the formation of the complex between the negatively charged nucleoplasmin and positively charged histones. Although the association of histones with nucleoplasmin may involve some ionic interactions, the interaction process is not electrostatically driven.

Although the association of histones with nucleoplasmin may involve some ionic interactions, the interaction process is not electrostatically driven. Under physiological conditions core histones interact with each other to form a heterotypic histone octamer consisting of a histone H3-H4 tetramer and two histone H2A-H2B dimers (1van Holde K.E.

Nucleoplasmin can bind and remove the protamine complement of the male pronucleus and can also bind to maternal histones mediating the replacement of the former by the latter. The way in which all this occurs at the molecular level has proven to be more complicated than originally envisaged. For instance, the early hypothetical model in which the highly positively charged protamines electrostatically interact with the negatively charged nucleoplasmin (10Laskey R.A. Mills A.D. Philpott A.

Thus the precise molecular mechanisms by which early developmental chromatin remodeling takes place are still poorly understood. Recombinant Proteins and Histones—Recombinant nucleoplasmin was obtained by expression of plasmid pET20b containing the Xenopus laevis nucleoplasmin cDNA corresponding to the cDNA sequenced by Bürglin (15Prieto C.

Titration of Nucleoplasmin with Histone Octamers—Native or trypsinized histone octamers at a concentration of ∼3–4 mg/ml in 2 m NaCl, 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.8) buffer were rapidly mixed with a nucleoplasmin solution prepared in 2 mm MgCl2, 10mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer. The mixture was carried out in such a way that the final concentration of nucleoplasmin in all the samples (∼0.1–0.12 mg/ml) and the final buffer composition (0.24 m NaCl, 12 mm potassium phosphate, 8.8 mm Tris-HCl, 1.8 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.5)) were kept the same in all the samples. Analytical Ultracentrifuge Analysis—Sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium analyses were carried out with a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman-Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA) using An-55 AL 9 aluminum and An-60 Ti (titanium) rotors, respectively. The samples were loaded on Kel-F 12-mm double sector cells. Experiments were carried out at 20 °C at different speeds as indicated in the figure legends. Sedimentation velocity scans were analyzed using XL-A Ultra Scan version 4.1 sedimentation data analysis software (Borries Demeler, Missoula, MT), which employs a published method of boundary analysis (21van Holde K.E. Weischet W.O. Biopolymers. 1978; 17: 1387-1403Crossref Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Sedimentation equilibrium scans were analyzed using the XL-A data software analysis. The molecular weight average was calculated from the best fitting slope of ln of absorbance at 230 nm versus the square of the radial distance. The partial specific volume of nucleoplasmin was calculated from its amino acid composition following the method of Cohn and Edsall (22Cohn E.J. Edsall J.T. Proteins, Amino Acids and Peptides as Ions and Dipolar Ions. Reinhold Publishing Corporation, New York1943Crossref Google Scholar) using the amino acid partial specific volumes from Perkins (23Perkins S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). The value calculated in this way was v̄ = 0.734 cm3/g. A value of v̄ = 0.753 cm3/g was used for the histone octamer (3Eickbush T.H. Moudrianakis E.N. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4955-4964Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Sucrose Gradients—Sucrose gradients (5–20% sucrose) were prepared in 240 mm NaCl, 12 mm potassium phosphate, 1.8 mm MgCl2, 8.8 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer. Native or trypsinized histones at ∼2.5 mg/ml in 2 m NaCl, 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) were rapidly mixed with a 0.25 mg/ml nucleoplasmin solution in 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer at different stoichiometric ratios and were immediately loaded on the sucrose gradients. The gradients were run for 21.5 h at 103,800 × g at 4 °C. Electrophoretic analysis of the proteins was carried out by SDS-PAGE (15% polyacrylamide) (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206514) Google Scholar). The Pentameric Form of Nucleoplasmin Binds Core Histones in an Amount Equivalent to One Histone Octamer—Native core histones (see Fig. 1a , lane 1) at elevated ionic strength (≥2 m NaCl) and at high concentrations of protein exist as a globular histone octamer (25Arents G. Burlingame R.W. Wang B.C. Love W.E. Moudrianakis E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10148-10152Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar) held together by specific interactions between the “histone fold” (2Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J.

A. 1995; 92: 11170-11174Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) domains of these proteins. Under these high ionic strength conditions the histone octamer (M r = 108,000) sediments with an s 20,w = 3.9 ± 0.1 S (27Weintraub H. Palter K. Van Lente F. Cell. 1975; 6: 85-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 28Thomas J.O. Butler P.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 116: 769-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 29Chung S.Y.

A. 1979; 76: 5178-5182Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). At lower ionic strengths, near physiological conditions the octamer is fully dissociated into a histone H3-H4 tetramer (M r = 53,200) and two histone H2A-H2B dimers (M r = 27,700 × 2). This heterogeneous mixture exhibits a sedimentation coefficient of 1.6–2.0 S for native histones and 2.0–2.4 S in the case of the trypsinized histones (see Fig. 1, a and b). The slight increase in s 20,w despite the decrease in mass observed in the latter case emphasizes the extended conformation of the histone domains (tails) removed by trypsin. It is not possible with the current technology to accurately define the individual sedimentation coefficients of the H3-H4 tetramer and the H2AH2B dimer from a mixture of both complexes. In contrast, nucleoplasmin forms under physiological conditions a stable pentamer (M r = 110,000), which has a sedimentation coefficient of 6.5 ± 0.1 S (see Fig. 1c) (15Prieto C. Saperas N. Arnan C. Hills M.H. Wang X. Chiva M. Aligue R. Subirana J.A. Ausió J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7802-7810Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although the preparation of recombinant nucleoplasmin used by us is very pure as judged by SDS-PAGE (see Fig. 1a , lane 3), it contains ∼15% slightly faster (6.5–8.4 S) sedimenting material (see Fig. 1c). This is most likely the result of some nonspecific association between pentamers and some improperly folded monomers. When a nucleoplasmin solution was mixed with 0.5 mol of histone octamer/mol of nucleoplasmin pentamer, this resulted in a broader sedimentation coefficient distribution spanning from 6.5 to 12.5 S (see Fig. 1d). Further addition of histone octamer to a ratio of 1 mol of octamer/mol of nucleoplasmin pentamer produced a bimodal distribution of the sedimentation coefficients in which about 85% (after correction for the difference in extinction coefficients of nucleoplasmin and the histone octamer) of the sample sedimented with a narrow sedimentation coefficient distribution centered at around 9.5 S, whereas the remainder sedimented as histones (see Fig. 1d). Sedimentation equilibrium analysis of the sample consisting of 1:1 molar complex gave an average molecular weight of 201,700, which is in very good agreement with that expected (219,000). Addition of histones to a 3:1 molar ratio to nucleoplasmin resulted again in a bimodal distribution in which the fraction of material sedimenting as free histones comprised 50% (see Fig. 1d) (after correction for the difference in extinction coefficients of free nucleoplasmin and histone-nucleoplasmin complex). This value is in very good agreement with the theoretically expected value (47%) calculated in the assumption that 1 mol of nucleoplasmin binds to 1 mol of histone octamer. In these titration experiments, the apparent average sedimentation coefficient of the fastest sedimenting fraction corresponding to the histone-nucleoplasmin complex exhibits a trend to decrease as the histone/nucleoplasmin ratio increases from 0.5 to 3.0 (mol of equivalent histone octamer/mol of nucleoplasmin pentamer) (see Fig. 1d). This is most likely due to the presence of free sedimenting histones. Regardless of this, the results of the histone/nucleoplasmin titration shown in Fig. 1d clearly indicate that each nucleoplasmin pentamer is able to bind approximately one histone octamer equivalent. Binding of Core Histones to Nucleoplasmin Does Not Exhibit Any Specific Core Histone Preference—The results above do not allow us to determine whether the different histone domains (H2A-H2B dimer and H3-H4 tetramer) bind to the nucleoplasmin pentamer with the same efficiency or whether there is any preference for either one of them when the nucleoplasmin pentamer is exposed to an excess of histone octamers. To analyze this and to corroborate the previous analytical ultracentrifuge data, we carried out a histone to nucleoplasmin titration using sucrose gradients (Fig. 2a) and analyzed the protein composition of the peaks corresponding to the resulting complexes using SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2b). As can be seen, titration of nucleoplasmin pentamers with a stoichiometric amount (1:1, mol/mol) of histone octamers resulted in a single symmetrical peak (Fig. 2a , dark blue diamonds) that sediments slightly slower than nucleosome core particles (s 20,w = 11.0 ± 0.2 S, M r = 204,800) (16Ausió J. Dong F. van Holde K.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) run under the same conditions (Fig. 2a , yellow triangles) and faster than the nucleoplasmin pentamer (Fig. 2a , light blue x symbols). When the same experiment was carried out using a larger ratio of histone octamers (2 mol of histone octamer/mol of nucleoplasmin pentamer), two symmetrical peaks were obtained (Fig. 2a , pink squares). The faster moving one overlaps with the peak corresponding to the stoichiometric complex. After correction for the difference in extinction coefficient of the histone octamer and nucleoplasmin, the area of the slow moving peak was determined to be 29.7% of that of the faster moving peak (31% expected on the basis of 1 mol of nucleoplasmin binding 1 mol of histone octamer). More importantly, the relative stoichiometry of the core histones was the same in both peaks (results not shown). Neither the histone tails nor the main polyglutamic tract of nucleoplasmin affects the binding of histones to nucleoplasmin. It is possible to remove the highly positively charged N-terminal domains of histones by treatment of nucleosome particles with immobilized trypsin (16Ausió J. Dong F. van Holde K.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) followed by hydroxylapatite chromatography to remove the DNA. The treatment does not affect the histone fold, which is responsible for the maintenance of the octameric histone complex, and hence it does not have much influence on the stability of the histone octamer. When a nucleoplasmin solution was titrated with increasing amounts of trypsinized histone octamers, the sedimentation behavior of the complexes (see Fig. 3a) was very similar to that observed for native histone octamers (see Fig. 1d). A boundary corresponding to ∼34–36% (after correction for difference in extinction coefficient) of free histones is observed when a starting ratio of 1 mol of nucleoplasmin was titrated with 2 mol of trypsinized histone octamers (see Fig. 3a), which is only slightly higher than the 29% expected. Similarly, when this complex was analyzed in a sucrose gradient (see Fig. 3c), ∼27.5% of the mixture sedimented as a slowly moving peak. The rest sedimented as a symmetrical peak for which the mobility overlapped with that of a complex consisting of 1:1 mol of nucleoplasmin/mol of trypsinized histones and exhibited an apparent molecular weight by sedimentation equilibrium of 149,800. The trypsinized histone nature of the slowly sedimenting peak and the histone composition of both peaks was visualized by SDS-PAGE analysis (see Fig. 3d). This analysis revealed that as with the native histones, the faster sedimenting peak (corresponding to the 1:1 nucleoplasmin/trypsinized histones) has no apparent histone preference. We next decided to analyze the role of the C-terminal polyglutamic tract of nucleoplasmin in the formation of the nucleoplasmin-histone complex. As this region of nucleoplasmin is highly negatively charged under physiological conditions, it would be expected to play a major role in the formation of the complex with the positively charged histones. As shown in Fig. 3b, removal of the polyglutamic tract had little if any effect on histone binding. Truncation of nucleoplasmin does not affect the formation of a pentameric complex, which sediments with an average sedimentation coefficient of 4.8 ± 0.1 S (15Prieto C. Saperas N. Arnan C. Hills M.H. Wang X. Chiva M. Aligue R. Subirana J.A. Ausió J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7802-7810Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Upon addition of histone octamers, the complexes thus formed behave in a way that is also very similar to that of the native complexes. Approximately 40% of the histones sediment as free histones when 2 mol of histones are mixed with 1 mol of truncated nucleoplasmin (see Fig. 3b), a value that is in good agreement with that expected (36%). The complex sediments with an average sedimentation coefficient of 10 ± 0.1 S, which is almost indistinguishable from that of the native complex, a fact that in this instance most likely reflects the decrease in the frictional properties (asymmetry) of the nucleoplasmin pentamer upon removal of the C-terminal domains of the monomer (15Prieto C. Saperas N. Arnan C. Hills M.H. Wang X. Chiva M. Aligue R. Subirana J.A. Ausió J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7802-7810Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the pioneering nucleoplasmin work of Laskey and coworkers (31Dilworth S.M. Black S.J. Laskey R.A. Cell. 1987; 51: 1009-1018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), it was shown that this molecule formed a histone storage complex with histones H2A and H2B. The dual functional involvement of this protein in removal of the sperm-specific proteins and assembly of the male pronuclear chromatin was later established (for review, see Refs. 9Philpott A. Leno G.H. Cell. 1992; 69: 759-767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar and 10Laskey R.A. Mills A.D. Philpott A. Leno G.H. Dilworth S.M. Dingwall C. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond.-Biol. Sci. 1993; 339: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A model was proposed in which histone H2A-H2B dimers were added to the histone H2A-H2B-deficient sperm chromatin of X. laevis (32Kasinsky H.E. Hnilica L. Stein G.S. Stein J.L. Histones and Other Basic Nuclear Proteins. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1989: 74-163Google Scholar) upon removal of the sperm-specific (SP1–6) proteins. However, SP1–6 proteins represent an important sperm chromatin component that needs to be replaced by complete nucleosomes (consisting of a whole set of storage histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4). Also, nucleoplasmin has been shown to be the major protein of the egg of other amphibians, such as the toad Bufo japonicus, whose sperm protein composition consists only of protamines (12Ohsumi K. Katagiri C. Dev. Biol. 1991; 148: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Furthermore, amphibian nucleoplasmin alone in the presence of added histones has been shown to be able to produce chromatin remodeling of protamine containing sperm chromatin (33Itoh T. Osumi K. Katagiri C.H. Dev. Growth Differ. 1993; 35: 59-66Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar) or protamine-reconstituted DNA complexes (34Ruiz-Lara S.A. Cornudella L. Rodriguez-Campos A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that in addition to providing a chaperone role for histones H2A and H2B, nucleoplasmin may also be able to bind to a full core histone complement and participate in this way in the process of nucleosome assembly during early development. A crystallographic structure of nucleoplasmin from X. laevis and a nucleoplasmin-like protein from Drosophila has been recently published, and a model has been proposed based on this structural information for the possible interactions with the histone octamer (6Dutta S. Akey I.V. Dingwall C. Hartman K.L. Laue T. Nolte R.T. Head J.F. Akey C.W. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 841-853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 7Akey C.W. Luger K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 6-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 8Namboodiri V.M.H. Dutta S. Akey I.V. Head J.F. Structure. 2003; 11: 175-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). According to this model, five histone octamers bind to a nucleoplasmin decamer (two pentamers). However, a nucleoplasmin decamer has never been observed in solution (15Prieto C. Saperas N. Arnan C. Hills M.H. Wang X. Chiva M. Aligue R. Subirana J.A. Ausió J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7802-7810Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Furthermore, neither under the ionic strength conditions chosen in those works to prepare their histonenucleoplasmin complexes (1 m NaCl) nor under those used to purify them (100 mm NaCl) (6Dutta S.

Akey I.V. Head J.F. Structure. 2003; 11: 175-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) do core histones exist as an octamer. Therefore, for that model to be true it would also need to be argued that nucleoplasmin stabilizes the structure of the histone octamer under those ionic conditions, a fact that remains yet to be experimentally determined. The results presented in this paper, under ionic physiological conditions where the histone octamer is in equilibrium with the histone H3-H4 tetramer and the histone H2A-H2B dimer (3Eickbush T.H. Moudrianakis E.N. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4955-4964Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 4a), indicate that one complete histone octamer equivalent binds a nucleoplasmin pentamer. The lack of a bimodal distribution at ratios of histone/nucleoplasmin ≤0.5 (mol/mol) in all of the complexes studied argues that the histone octamers do not bind like intact octamers but rather as H2A-H2B dimers and H3-H4 tetramers (see Fig. 4, b–d). The persistence of the stoichiometry of interaction observed both in the absence of the histone tails and in the absence of the polyglutamic rich C-terminal domain of nucleoplasmin shows that these highly charged domains play a minor role in the interaction and that the recognition must take place between the folded structure of the nucleoplasmin pentamer (6Dutta S. Akey I.V. Dingwall C. Hartman K.L. Laue T. Nolte R.T. Head J.F. Akey C.W. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 841-853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and the histone fold (2Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389 (226): 251Crossref PubMed Scopus (6830) Google Scholar, 26Arents G. Moudrianakis E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11170-11174Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) as indicated in Fig. 4, b–d. As can be seen in Fig. 3a, the complex formed between the nucleoplasmin pentamer and the truncated histones exhibits a slightly higher sedimentation coefficient value (11.2 ± 0.2 S) (despite the decrease in molecular weight) than that of the complex formed with intact histones, a fact that reflects the higher symmetry of the complex resulting from the removal of the histone tails (see Fig. 4c). Therefore, the in vitro analysis of the interaction between nucleoplasmin and core histones does not show any preference of nucleoplasmin by any particular set of core histones, which are all present in stoichiometric amount in the resulting complexes. Xenopus oocytes as many other vertebrate and invertebrate oocytes store large amounts of histones in their nuclei. These histones presumably are involved in the chromatin remodeling that takes place immediately after fertilization in those organisms in which nuclear sperm chromatin consists of protamines and non-histone sperm-specific proteins. In Xenopus, two soluble complexes have been isolated from oocytes consisting of H2A-H2B and nucleoplasmin and histone H3-H4 in association of a pair of distinctive polypeptides (N1 and N2) (35Kleinschmidt J.A. Franke W.W. Cell. 1982; 29: 799-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, nucleoplasmin is by far the most abundant protein in Xenopus oocytes (10Laskey R.A. Mills A.D. Philpott A. Leno G.H. Dilworth S.M. Dingwall C. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond.-Biol. Sci. 1993; 339: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and a fraction of H3-H4-like histones has also been found to be associated to it in 7 S complexes purified from these oocytes by sucrose gradients (36Kleinschmidt J.A. Fortkamp E. Krohne G. Zentgraf H. Franke W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1166-1176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the relation, if any, of the 10–11 S histone-nucleoplasmin complexes studied in this work to the 7 S complexes identified by Kleinschmidt et al. (36Kleinschmidt J.A. Fortkamp E. Krohne G. Zentgraf H. Franke W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1166-1176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is not clear, the presence of four distinctive nucleosomal core histones in this fraction provides additional support to the notion that nucleoplasmin can participate in the full assembly of complete nucleosomes in vitro (33Itoh T. Osumi K. Katagiri C.H. Dev. Growth Differ. 1993; 35: 59-66Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 37Ito T. Tyler J.K. Bulger M. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25041-25048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The results described in this paper using mixtures of H2A-H2B and histone H3-H4 tetramers and the stoichiometry with which they bind to nucleoplasmin have implications for the way nucleoplasmin functions at the level of nucleosome/chromatin assembly in vivo. They raise the possibility that nucleoplasmin alone may, in certain instances, participate in the full nucleosome assembly after removal of the sperm-specific proteins from the male pronuclear chromatin fibers.

IκB proteins are widely expressed in different cells and tissues and bind to similar combinations of NF-κB proteins. The degradation of IκB proteins allows nuclear translocation of NF-κB and hence plays a critical role in NF-κB activation. Previous studies have demonstrated that, although both IκB proteins are phosphorylated by the same IκB kinase (IKK) complex, and their ubiquitination and degradation following phosphorylation are carried out by the same ubiquitination/degradation machinery, their kinetics of degradation are quite different. To better understand the underlying mechanism of the differences in degradation kinetics, we have carried out a systematic, comparative analysis of the ability of the IKK catalytic subunits to phosphorylate IκBα and IκBβ. We found that, whereas IKKα is a weak kinase for the N-terminal serines of both IκB isoforms, IKKβ is an efficient kinase for those residues in IκBα. However, IKKβ phosphorylates the N-terminal serines of IκBβ far less efficiently, thereby providing an explanation for the slower rate of degradation observed for IκBβ. Mutational analysis indicated that the regions around the two N-terminal serines collectively influence the relative phosphorylation efficiency, and no individual residue is critical. These findings provide the first systematic analysis of the ability of IκBα and IκBβ to serve as substrates for IKKs and help provide a possible explanation for the differential degradation kinetics of IκBα and IκBβ.

In most resting cells, the transcription factor NF-κB is kept dormant in the cytoplasm through its interaction with IκB proteins. There are several IκB isoforms, among which IκBα and IκBβ are the most abundant and well studied (for reviews, see Refs. 1Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev.

IκBα and IκBβ share a common overall domain structure: an N-terminal signal-responsive domain, a central ankyrin repeat domain, and a C-terminal PEST domain. The two IκB proteins also have similar three-dimensional structure as revealed in crystallographic studies on NF-κB·IκB complexes (3Jacobs M.D. Harrison S.C.

In addition, both IκB proteins bind predominantly to NF-κB p65/p50 heterodimers in vivo (6Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S.

However, the kinetics of IκBβ degradation varies in different cell types and depends on the nature of the inducer. Thus, whereas the level of IκBβ protein is unaltered in 70Z/3, Jurkat, or EL-4 cells treated with TNF-α (6Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S.

In certain cell lines such as 70Z/3, inducers such as lipopolysaccharide and interleukin-1 trigger complete IκBβ degradation, although the kinetics of degradation is still significantly slower than that of IκBα (6Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 8Weil R. Laurent-Winter C. Israel A. J. Biol.

Although it has been suggested that the rapid activation of NF-κB is due to the rapid degradation of IκBα, whereas a prolonged activation of NF-κB occurs through the less efficient degradation of IκBβ (6Thompson J.E.

A critical step in the activation of NF-κB is the phosphorylation of IκB proteins by the IκB kinase (IKK) complex. Characterization of the 700–900-kDa IKK complex has led to the identification of two catalytic subunits, IKKα and IKKβ, and a regulatory subunit, IKKγ/NEMO (13Regnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X.

The IKK complex may also include other components such as a kinase-specific chaperone (Cdc37/HSP90) that appears to play a role in shuttling the complex from the cytoplasm to the membrane during TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation (22Chen G. Cao P. Goeddel D.V. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 401-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Both in vitro and in vivo studies have proven that IKKα and IKKβ can phosphorylate IκB proteins at specific serine residues, including Ser32 and Ser36 of IκBα and Ser19 and Ser23 of IκBβ (13Regnier C.H.

Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1911) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at these conserved serine residues leads to ubiquitination and degradation of the IκB proteins. Although it is generally accepted that IKK phosphorylates both IκBα and IκBβ, the efficiency of the two IκB isoforms as substrates has never been carefully examined. Because IKK activity is likely rate-limiting for IκB degradation and NF-κB activation, since a 2-fold reduction in IKKβ causes nearly 80% decrease in NF-κB activation (23Li Z.W. Chu W. Hu Y. Delhase M. Deerinck T. Ellisman M. Johnson R. Karin M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1839-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar), we compared the phosphorylation of IκBα and IκBβ by IKKα and IKKβ in an attempt to better understand the mechanism of differential regulation of IκB degradation. Plasmids, Cells, and Antibodies—Vector pGEX6P1 (Amersham Biosciences) was used to generate all GST-tagged wild-type and mutant IκB constructs. IKKβ was cloned into pcDNA3 (Clontech), and pEF-IκBα and pEF-IκBβ (the pEF vector was from Invitrogen) were used in transfection experiments. HEK293, NIH3T3, IκBα–/–3T3, and IκBβ–/–3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. IκBα–/–3T3 and IκBβ–/–3T3 cells were developed from IκBα–/– and IκBβ–/– mouse embryo fibroblasts, respectively, using standard protocols. Anti-FLAG antibody M2-conjugated agarose beads and glutathione-conjugated agarose beads were purchased from Sigma. All antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The pGEX-IκBαN deletion mutant was generated by PCR using specific primers for the 5′- and 3′-terminal sequences. pGEX-IκBβN point mutations were generated by PCR according to point mutagenesis protocol from Clontech. Escherichia coli DH5α bacterial cells were used for cloning, and the mutants were verified by sequencing. Preparation of GST-tagged Proteins—Plasmids were transformed into BL21 bacterial cells and grown in ampicillin-containing LB medium to A = 0.6. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm to induce production of GST-tagged proteins. The cultures were grown overnight at room temperature. Cells were collected and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline plus protease inhibitors and then sonicated using a Virsonic sonicator (Virtis). The supernatant was clarified by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 30 min and incubated with glutathione-conjugated agarose beads for 30 min. GST-tagged proteins were eluted by 10 mm glutathione in 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.0) and dialyzed in 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.0). Transfection—Cells were grown in 10-cm plates to 40% confluence and transfected with the indicated DNAs using FuGENE™ 6 (Roche Applied Science). For transient transfections, cells were harvested after 36–48 h. For stable transfections, puromycin (1 μg/ml final concentration) was added to the medium. Resistant colonies formed after ∼1 week and were moved to 24-well plates to expand to single clones. Positive stable transfectants were verified for expression of the cloned proteins using specific antibodies. Kinase Assay—293 cells were treated with TNF-α for 10 min or transfected with the indicated IKK constructs for 48 h before harvesting. Cells were lysed in buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), and phosphatase inhibitors. Supernatants were collected and incubated with anti-IKKγ polyclonal antibody with protein G-Sepharose beads or anti-FLAG antibody M2-agarose beads for 3 h. The beads were washed with TNT buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100) and phosphate-buffered saline, before incubation with kinase reaction buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP and the indicated GST-substrate IκB proteins for the indicated times. The reaction was stopped by dilution in TNT buffer, followed by pull-down of the GST-tagged proteins using glutathione-conjugated agarose beads. The pelleted beads were washed three times with TNT buffer, and the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The gels were fixed and vacuum-dried before exposure to BioMax films (Eastman Kodak Co.). After exposure, the gels were rehydrated and stained with Coomassie Blue. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed in TNT buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors. In immunoprecipitation experiments, cell lysates were incubated with 30 μl of anti-FLAG antibody M2 affinity gel for 3 h at 4 °C. Immobilized immunocomplexes were washed with TNT buffer three times, boiled in SDS loading buffer, and resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon transfer membrane (Millipore Corp.) and blotted with the indicated primary antibodies for 3 h at room temperature, followed by the appropriate secondary antibody for 1 h. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by ECL. Differential Degradation Kinetics of IκBα and IκBβ—When cells such as the mouse pre-B cell line 70Z/3 are treated with TNF-α, the cytosolic protein levels of IκBα and IκBβ change with distinct patterns (6Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 8Weil R. Laurent-Winter C. Israel A. J. Biol.

Biol. 1996; 16: 5444-5449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas IκBα disappears and reappears over a period of 3 h, IκBβ levels remain unaltered. Activated NFκB induces the resynthesis of IκBα via the three κB sites in the IκBα promoter (24Brown K. Park S. Kanno T. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2532-2536Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 25Chiao P.J. Miyamoto S. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3787-3792Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Although the IκBβ promoter region harbors a single κB site, it is minimally responsive to NF-κB binding (29Budde L.M. Wu C. Tilman C. Douglas I. Ghosh S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4179-4194Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the presence of cycloheximide, IκBα did not reappear after 30 min, whereas IκBβ levels were unaffected (Fig. 1A, left panel), thus excluding the possibility that IκBβ protein levels were maintained through a balance of degradation/turnover and resynthesis. The non-responsiveness of IκBβ to TNF-α treatment was, however, cell type specific. In NIH3T3 cells, IκBβ did respond to TNF-α, although the rate and extent of degradation were noticeably less than those of IκBα (Fig. 1B, left panel). When both cell types were treated with lipopolysaccharide, the level of IκBβ degradation was greater, but the overall pattern remained the same (Fig. 1, A and B, right panels). The IKK Complex Differentially Phosphorylates IκBα and IκBβ—Because phosphorylation is the first step that marks IκB proteins for degradation, we examined whether IκBα and IκBβ can be phosphorylated equally well by the IKK complex. We therefore performed in vitro kinase assays using recombinant GST-IκBα and GST-IκBβ proteins as substrates and immunoprecipitated the IKK complex from TNF-α-stimulated HEK293 cells as the kinase. It has been previously shown that, upon stimulation by TNF-α, IKK activity peaks within 5–15 min before declining to ∼25% of its peak value by 30 min (15Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M. Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar, 16DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1911) Google Scholar, 30Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar) (data not shown). We therefore used 293 cells stimulated with TNF-α for 10 min as a source of active IKK in our assays. Since IKKγ/NEMO exists as a complex with both IKKα and IKKβ in vivo (17Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Natoli G. Karin M. Nature. 1998; 395: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar), we immunoprecipitated the IKK complex using anti-NEMO polyclonal antibody. Surprisingly, we observed a significant difference in the level of phosphorylation of IκBα and IκBβ (Fig. 2A, upper panel), even though the amount of GST-IκB proteins was similar (lower panel). The IKK complex immunoprecipitated from unstimulated cells also phosphorylated the IκB proteins weakly (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 3), indicating that some constitutive activation of IKK occurred in these cells. Although both IKKα and IKKβ can phosphorylate the N-terminal serine residues in IκB proteins, we wanted to test whether they exhibit any preference for IκBα or IκBβ. Both IKKα and IKKβ contain an activation loop, and phosphorylation of specific serine residues in the activation loop leads to activation of the kinases (14Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W.

A. 1998; 95: 3792-3797Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). It has been shown that substitution of the serine residues (Ser176 and Ser180 in IKKα and Ser177 and Ser181 in IKKβ) with glutamic acid (which mimic phosphoserine) results in constitutively active IKKα and IKKβ (14Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A. Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1852) Google Scholar). We therefore transfected constitutively active FLAG-tagged IKKα and IKKβ into 293 cells and immunoprecipitated them using anti-FLAG antibody-conjugated agarose beads. The cloning vector was used as a negative control (labeled as – in the figures). The majority of the overexpressed IKKα or IKKβ formed homodimers, with very small amounts of heterodimers being formed between transfected and endogenous IKK subunits (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2 (B and C), both constitutively active IKKα and IKKβ homodimers phosphorylated IκBα more efficiently than IκBβ, as seen previously for the endogenous TNF-α-stimulated IKK complex (Fig. 2A). IKKβ Differentially Phosphorylates IκBα and IκBβ N Termini—Some prior reports have indicated that, besides Ser32 and Ser36 in IκBα and Ser19 and Ser23 in IκBβ, the IKK complex can also phosphorylate the C terminus of IκBα (16DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1911) Google Scholar, 33Burke J.R. Wood M.K. Ryseck R.P. Walther S. Meyers C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36146-36152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To check whether the differential phosphorylation between full-length IκBα and IκBβ is due to additional C-terminal sites of phosphorylation in IκBα, we compared the efficiency of phosphorylation of full-length IκBα and IκBβ versus truncated IκB proteins containing only the N-terminal serine residues (IκBαN containing the N-terminal 54 residues and IκBβN containing the N-terminal 44 residues). Using TNF-α-activated IKK immunoprecipitated with anti-NEMO antibody, we found no significant difference in the efficiency of phosphorylation between the full-length and N-terminal IκBα and IκBβ substrates (Fig. 3A). We then tested whether there is any difference in the ability of IKKα and IKKβ to phosphorylate full-length IκB proteins and their N-terminal portions. As shown in Fig. 3B, whereas IKKβ(constitutively active) homodimers strongly phosphorylated both full-length IκBα and IκBαN, the equivalent IκBβ constructs were phosphorylated poorly. In contrast, whereas IKKα(constitutively active) homodimers were able to efficiently phosphorylate both full-length IκB constructs, it was unable to phosphorylate IκBαN and IκBβN. To determine whether the inability of IKKα to phosphorylate the IκB N terminus might be influenced by IKKγ/NEMO, the regulatory subunit of the IKK complex, we transfected wild-type IKKα with or without cotransfection of NEMO to generate the kinase used to phosphorylate IκBα and IκBβ N termini. However, in both cases, overexpressed wild-type IKKα efficiently phosphorylated full-length IκBα and, to a lesser extent, full-length IκBβ, but was unable to phosphorylate the N-terminal IκB substrates (Fig. 3C). Comparison of the Phosphorylation and Degradation Kinetics of IκB Proteins—To explore the possibility that inefficient IκBβ phosphorylation by IKKβ may be responsible for the slower and incomplete degradation of IκBβ, we compared the kinetics of IκBαN and IκBβN phosphorylation by IKKβ. As mentioned above, the activity of IKKβ in most cell lines treated with TNF-α peaks between 5 and 15 min and then decreases significantly, most likely due to extensive autophosphorylation of its C-terminal region (30Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). As described above, we used immunoprecipitated IKKβ(CA) and incubated it with IκBα or IκBβ N termini for different time points. Interestingly, the autophosphorylation of IKKβ(CA) increased in a linear manner over time (Fig. 4A). Whereas the phosphorylation of both IκBαN and IκBβN also increased over time, the dramatic difference between IκBα and IκBβ remained even after 1 h of incubation with IKKβ (Fig. 4A). Quantitation of the degree of phosphorylation by a PhosphorImager indicated a roughly linear correlation between time and degree of phosphorylation for both IκBαN and IκBβN. We also noticed that the phosphorylation of IκBβ at 1 h was less than that of IκBα at 5 min. Interestingly, the level of IκBβ phosphorylation increased only slightly even after 3 h of incubation (data not shown). These results suggest that the inefficiency of IκBβ phosphorylation by IKKβ cannot be explained as a simple kinetic difference and probably reflects a more fundamental difference in the ability of the two proteins to serve as substrates for IKKβ. Differential Phosphorylation of IκB N Termini Is Linked to Protein Stability of IκB Proteins—To further establish the link between phosphorylation efficiency of IκB proteins and their degradation pattern, we transiently transfected HeLa cells with IκBα and IKKβ. Cotransfection of IKKβ(CA) dramatically decreased the protein level of wild-type IκBα, but did not affect the level of the non-phosphorylatable IκBαAA mutant, in which the two conserved serine residues at positions 32 and 36 had been mutated to alanines. Therefore, this experiment establishes that the instability of IκBα protein caused by IKKβ cotransfection was dependent on phosphorylation of Ser32 and Ser36. However, cotransfection of IKKβ did not affect the protein stability of IκBβ, which likely correlates with the inability of IKKβ to efficiently phosphorylate IκBβ (Fig. 5B, lower panel, third and fourth lanes). To further establish the connection between phosphorylation efficiency and stability of transfected IκB proteins, we generated two chimeric proteins, IκBαβ and IκBβα, by swapping the N-terminal signal peptide region between IκBα and IκBβ (Fig. 5B, upper panel). Because the N termini of IκB proteins determine the efficiency of phosphorylation by IKKβ, GST-IκBαβ was efficiently phosphorylated in in vitro kinase assays, whereas GST-IκBβα was not (data not shown). Consistent with this difference in phosphorylation efficiency, the level of transfected IκBαβ protein was significantly reduced by IKKβ cotransfection, whereas the level of IκBβα was affected only marginally. Thus, the N termini of IκB proteins determine their ability to be phosphorylated by IKKβ, which in turn is reflected in their rate of degradation. Residues 28–42 in IκBα and Residues 15–31 in IκBβ Influence Substrate Phosphorylation Efficiency—To determine which specific features of the IκBα N terminus sequence make it a better substrate for IKKβ, we carried out a comprehensive mutational analysis of the N-terminal regions of IκBα and IκBβ. We initially focused on the first 12 amino acids in IκBα, which is a sequence unique to IκBα (Fig. 6A). We generated an IκBαN–12 mutant by deleting these 12 amino acids and compared the phosphorylation efficiency of this mutant and the wild-type IκB proteins. In vitro kinase assays revealed no significant difference between this mutant and wild-type IκBα, indicating that these 12 unique residues of IκBα do not determine the phosphorylation efficiency of IκB proteins (Fig. 6B). We then divided the remaining homologous region in the N termini of IκB proteins (residues 13–54 in IκBα and residues 1–42 in IκBβ) into three parts and swapped the different parts between IκBα and IκBβ to produce a set of chimeric GST-tagged N-terminal IκB proteins, IκBNαβα, IκBNβαβ, IκBNβαα, IκBNββα, IκBNαββ, and IκBNααβ (Fig. 6C). Only one of the GST-IκBN chimeric proteins, GST-IκBNβαα, was phosphorylated to the same level as GST-IκBαN in in vitro kinase assays (Fig. 6D). Because both IκBNβαβ and IκBNββα were poorly phosphorylated by IKKβ, we believe that sequence elements present in residues 28–54 of IκBα are responsible for the high phosphorylation efficiency of IκBα. To further narrow down the sequences responsible for determining the efficiency of IκBα as a substrate for IKKβ, we made additional chimeras by fusing different lengths of the sequence from residues 39 to 54 of IκBα with the central core of amino acids 29–38 from IκBα (data not shown). Analysis of these chimeras indicated that attaching residues 29–43 to the central core in the IκBNβαβ′ chimera (where residues 29–43 are derived from IκBα, with the flanking sequences from IκBβ) allowed it to be phosphorylated as efficiently as IκBαN (Fig. 6, E and F, third lane). Since residues 29–43 of IκBα appear to be the critical sequence responsible for efficient phosphorylation of IκBα, we generated a set of IκBβN mutants by replacing smaller clusters of residues in this region with their counterparts in IκBα to see if the phosphorylation efficiency of this IκBβN substrate could be enhanced (Fig. 6E) (individual point mutations were also made (data not shown)). It is important to note that aspartic acid at position 35 in IκBα and glycine at position 22 in IκBβ are the only residues that differ between IκBα and IκBβ within the conserved core sequence recognized by IKK, viz. DSGL(D/G)S. However, the substitution of aspartic acid for glycine in IκBβ (mutant IκBβNd) did not significantly improve its substrate efficiency, and other mutations in this region did not individually reconstitute the high phosphorylation efficiency of IκBαN. Therefore, it is likely that the overall structure of the region from amino acids 29 to 43 in IκBα (and the corresponding region in IκBβ, amino acids 15–31) determines its efficiency as a substrate for IKKβ phosphorylation. In a continuing effort to understand the basis for the differential kinetics of IκBα and IκBβ degradation, we have been searching for cis- and trans-acting factors that might influence the behavior of the two IκB isoforms (6Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 34Fenwick C. Na S.Y. Voll R.E. Zhong H. Im S.Y. Lee J.W. Ghosh S. Science. 2000; 287: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The findings reported in this study suggest that the amino acid sequence of the N-terminal region that includes the actual sites of phosphorylation determines the efficiency with which the two IκB proteins can be phosphorylated by IKKβ. This intrinsic difference in phosphorylation efficiency would therefore likely contribute to the differential kinetics of degradation of the two isoforms observed in response to some inducers in some cells (6Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 8Weil R. Laurent-Winter C. Israel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9942-9949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). It is important to note that this difference is unlikely to fully explain all observations regarding differential regulation of these isoforms. In particular, it has been reported that, whereas IκBβ is degraded in response to TNF signaling in some cells, it is unaffected in many other cells (6Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H.

Chem. 1997; 272: 9942-9949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Such variability in the behavior of IκBβ in different cells is difficult to explain on the basis of intrinsic differences in the ability of IKKβ to phosphorylate IκBα and IκBβ. It is also not completely clear how the differences between IκBα and IκBβ seen in this analysis can be reconciled with the results of IκBβ knock-in mice (35Cheng J.D. Ryseck R.P. Attar R.M. Dambach D. Bravo R. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1055-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In that study, a tagged IκBβ was knocked into the IκBα locus, and the finding that IκBβ in these cells rescued the lethality seen in IκBα knockout mice suggested that IκBα and IκBβ are interchangeable and that their differential responses to NF-κB inducers are not due to intrinsic differences in the proteins (35Cheng J.D. Ryseck R.P. Attar R.M. Dambach D. Bravo R. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1055-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It is likely that trans-acting factors such as κB-Ras proteins also contribute to the observed differences in the degradation kinetics of the two IκB isoforms since κB-Ras binds preferentially to IκBβ in cells (34Fenwick C. Na S.Y. Voll R.E. Zhong H. Im S.Y. Lee J.W. Ghosh S. Science. 2000; 287: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 36Chen Y. Wu J. Ghosh G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23101-23106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). 2C. Wu and S. Ghosh, unpublished data. We observed a surprising and unexpected difference in the ability of IKKα to phosphorylate full-length IκB proteins versus the N-terminal fragments of IκB proteins. Whereas IKKβ was able to phosphorylate both the full-length and truncated IκB substrates equally well, IKKα displayed a strong preference for the full-length proteins and was almost inactive on the N-terminal fragments. The inability of IKKα to efficiently phosphorylate the N-terminal IκB substrates also raises the possibilities that, in vivo, IKKα might not phosphorylate IκB proteins and that the lower level of phosphorylation observed with the full-length IκB proteins as substrates may be an in vitro phenomenon since it is known that many kinases lose their selectivity when tested in vitro at high concentrations. Such an explanation would also predict that IKKβ, rather than IKKα, is responsible for phosphorylating the two conserved serines in IκB proteins and transducing inflammatory signals, such as from TNF-α. This observation corroborates previous genetic studies that have disputed the apparent commonality of the two subunits of IKK (37Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3290) Google Scholar). IKKα–/– mice died perinatally due to limb and skin abnormalities; however, no impairment in IκB degradation in response to signaling by cytokines such as TNF-α and interleukin-1 was observed (38Takeda K. Takeuchi O. Tsujimura T. Itami S. Adachi O. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Yoshikawa K. Terada N. Akira S. Science. 1999; 284: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 39Hu Y. Baud V. Delhase M. Zhang P. Deerinck T. Ellisman M. Johnson R. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). More recently, further analysis of mice in which a catalytically inactive form of IKKα was knocked in led to the discovery that IKKα functions in different biological processes, including breast development, keratinocyte differentiation, and lymph node development, not all of which are NF-κB-dependent (40Hu Y. Baud V. Oga T. Kim K.I. Yoshida K. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 41Senftleben U. Cao Y. Xiao G. Greten F.R. Krahn G. Bonizzi G. Chen Y. Hu Y. Fong A. Sun S.C. Karin M. Science. 2001; 293: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar, 42Cao Y. Bonizzi G. Seagroves T.N. Greten F.R. Johnson R. Schmidt E.V. Karin M. Cell. 2001; 107: 763-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). In instances where IKKα has been shown to influence NF-κB, the effect appears to be due to an alternate pathway that leads to the activation of p52·RelB complexes following the processing of the p100 subunit (41Senftleben U. Cao Y. Xiao G. Greten F.R. Krahn G. Bonizzi G. Chen Y. Hu Y. Fong A. Sun S.C. Karin M. Science. 2001; 293: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that the inability of IKKα to phosphorylate the N-terminal IκB substrates hints at the pleiotropic nature of IKKα, whose more important targets for phosphorylation might be NF-κB2 p100, histone H3, and NF-κB p65. The major finding of this study is, however, the clear demonstration of the difference in the ability of the two IκB isoforms to serve as phosphorylation substrates for IKKβ. Comparison of the sequence around the target serine residues in the N-terminal signal-responsive domains of IκBα and IκBβ indicates the absence of an aspartic acid immediately upstream of the second serine residue in IκBβ (Asp35 in IκBα versus Gly22 in IκBβ). However, as shown in Fig. 6, changing the glycine in IκBβ to aspartic acid did not enhance the ability of IKKβ to phosphorylate the IκBβ protein. Instead, it appears that a larger segment from amino acids 29 to 43 is responsible for allowing efficient phosphorylation of IκBα. Unfortunately, the existing crystal structures of IκB proteins do not include this segment; and therefore, it is difficult to propose a model to explain the role played by this region of IκBα. Ultimately, a co-crystal of the IκB N-terminal domain with IKKβ will be necessary to understand the selectivity displayed by IKKβ for IκBα.

https://openalex.org/W2075196569,"Modulation of neurotransmitter-gated membrane ion channels by protein kinase C (PKC) has been the subject of a number of studies. However, less is known about PKC modulation of the serotonin type 3 (5-HT3) receptor, a ligand-gated membrane ion channel that can mediate fast synaptic transmission in the central and peripheral nervous system. Here, we show that PKC potentiated 5-HT3 receptor-mediated current in Xenopus oocytes expressing 5-HT3A receptors and mouse N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells. In addition, using a specific antibody directed to the extracellular N-terminal domain of the 5-HT3A receptor, treatment with the PKC activator, 4β-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), significantly increased surface immunofluorescence. PKC also increased the amount of 5-HT3A receptor protein in the cell membrane without affecting the amount receptor protein in the total cell extract. The magnitude of PMA potentiation of 5-HT3A receptor-mediated responses is correlated with the magnitude of PMA enhancement of the receptor abundance in the cell surface membrane. PMA potentiation is unlikely to occur via direct phosphorylation of the 5-HT3A receptor protein since the potentiation was not affected by point mutation of each of the putative sites for PKC phosphorylation. However, preapplication of phalloidin, which stabilizes the actin polymerization, significantly inhibited PMA potentiation of 5-HT-activated responses in both N1E-115 cells and oocytes expressing 5-HT3A receptors. On the other hand, latrunculin-A, which destabilizes actin cytoskeleton, enhanced the PMA potentiation of 5-HT3A receptors. The observations suggest that PKC can modulate 5-HT3A receptor function and trafficking through an F-actin-dependent mechanism.

Although molecular studies have identified two 5-HT3 receptor subunits, 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B (1Maricq A.V. Peterson A.S. Brake A.J. Myers R.M. Julius D.

J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6732-6741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 5-HT3A receptors are differentially distributed in a number of important brain areas including the hippocampus, nucleus of the solitary tract, nucleus accumbens, substantia nigra, and ventral tegmental area (4Tecott L.H.

In some of these brain regions, 5-HT3 receptors have been found to modulate the release of neurotransmitters such as dopamine and GABA (7Van Hooft J.A. Vijverberg H.P. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 605-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In addition, 5-HT3 receptors are thought to be involved in reward mechanisms of some drugs of abuse and have been proposed to be involved in central nervous system phenomena such as anxiety, psychosis, nociception (8Zeitz K.P. Guy N. Malmberg A.B. Dirajlal S. Martin W.J. Sun L. Bonhaus D.W. Stucky C.L. Julius D. Basbaum A.I. J.

Modulation of ligand-gated ion channel function by protein kinases has been the focus of a number of previous studies. For example, such studies have shown that activation of PKC can modulate glycine, GABAA, and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in various types of neurons and in cell lines expressing these receptors (10Swope S.L.

Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 382-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Regulation of some of these receptors by PKC is thought to be important for synaptic modulation and neuronal plasticity. PKC has been found to induce internalization of GABAA receptors (14Chapell R. Bueno O.F. Alvarez-Hernandez X. Robinson L.C. Leidenheimer N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32595-32601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 16Filippova N. Dudley R. Weiss D.S. J. Physiol. 1999; 518: 385-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and, on the other hand, to promote trafficking of NMDA receptors to the cell surface (15Lan J.Y. Skeberdis V.A. Jover T. Grooms S.Y. Lin Y. Araneda R.C. Zheng X. Bennett M.V. Zukin R.S. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 382-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The regulation of receptor trafficking by activation of PKC is thought, at least in part, to contribute to PKC-induced alteration in the function of these receptors. Although PKC has been shown to regulate the phosphorylation of GABAA and NMDA receptor proteins (10Swope S.L. Moss S.J. Blackstone C.D. Huganir R.L. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2514-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 17Swope S.L. Moss S.I. Raymond L.A. Huganir R.L. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1999; 33: 49-78Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it appears unlikely that the functional modulation of these receptors by PKC results from direct phosphorylation of the receptor proteins (14Chapell R.

Rather, PKC is thought to phosphorylate receptor-associated proteins, which modulate receptor trafficking through intracellular signaling pathways (15Lan J.Y. Skeberdis V.A. Jover T. Grooms S.Y.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15262-15267Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that the actin cytoskeleton may play an important role in synaptic modulation and plasticity by anchoring, clustering, and targeting several LGICs (19Wyszynski M. Lin J. Rao A. Nigh E. Beggs A.H. Craig A.M. Sheng M. Nature. 1997; 385: 439-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 20Allison D.W. Gelfand V.I. Spector I. Craig A.M. J.

Activation of PKC by phorbol esters is proposed to disorder the dynamics of the actin filament network by removing a barrier to vesicle trafficking and docking, thereby promoting exocytosis (24Trifaro J.M. Rodriguez Del Castillo A. Vitale M.L. Mol. Neurobiol. 1992; 6: 339-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 25Vaughan P.F. Walker J.H. Peers C. Mol.

Consistent with this hypothesis, potentiation of NMDA receptor-mediated responses by activation of PKC is dependent on dynamic cycling of actin polymerization/depolymerization (27Wagner D.A. Leonard J.P. Neurosci. Lett. 1999; 272: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 28Skeberdis V.A. Lan J. Opitz T. Zheng X. Bennett M.V. Zukin R.S. Neuropharmacology. 2001; 40: 856-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Of all the LGICs, modulation of 5-HT3 receptor function by PKC has received relatively little attention. Previous studies reported the application of phorbol esters, activators of PKC, can potentiate 5-HT-activated current in Xenopus oocytes expressing 5-HT3A receptors (29Zhang L. Oz M. Weight F.F. Neuroreport. 1995; 6: 1464-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), modulate the desensitization of 5-HT-activated current in HEK-293 cells expressing 5-HT3A receptors (30Hubbard P.C. Thompson A.J. Lummis S.C. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 81: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and regulate the probability of occurrence of certain conductance levels of 5-HT-activated single channel currents in mouse neuroblastoma, N1E-115 cells (31Van Hooft J.A. Vijverberg H.P. Receptors Channels. 1995; 3: 7-12PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, a recent study suggests that a tyrosine kinase may be involved in PMA potentiation of 5-HT3A receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes (32Coultrap S.J. Machu T.K. Receptors Channels. 2002; 8: 63-70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another recent study indicates that 5-HT3A receptors are colocalized and coclustered with F-actin in NG108–15 cells, hippocampal neurons and in cells transiently transfected with cloned 5-HT3A receptors (33Emerit M.B. Doucet E. Darmon M. Hamon M. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 20: 110-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), suggesting that F-actin might be involved in the regulation of 5-HT3A receptor targeting and clustering. Nevertheless, the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which PKC modulates 5-HT3 receptor function have not been determined. To address this question, we have used various approaches in this study and found that PKC can modulate 5-HT3 receptor function and receptor trafficking in N1E-115 cells and in Xenopus oocytes expressing 5-HT3A receptors. We have also found that PKC modulation of 5-HT3A receptor function is likely to occur via an F-actin-dependent mechanism. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Point mutations of a cloned mouse 5-HT3A receptor were introduced using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The authenticity of the DNA fragments that flank the mutation site was confirmed by double-strand DNA sequencing using an ABI Prism 377 automatic DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Preparation of Complementary RNAs and Expression of Receptors— Complementary RNAs were synthesized in vitro from linearized template cDNAs with a mMACHINE RNA transcription kit from Ambion Inc. The quality and the sizes of synthesized complementary RNAs were confirmed by denatured RNA agarose gels. Mature female Xenopus laevis frogs were anesthetized by submersion in 0.2% 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester (Sigma), and a group of oocytes was surgically excised. The oocytes were separated, and the follicular cell layer was removed by treatment with type I collagenase (Roche Applied Science) for 2 h at room temperature. Each oocyte was injected with a total of 20 ng of RNA in 20 nl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water and was incubated at 19 °C in modified Barth's solution (MBS: 88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 2.0 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Recording from Xenopus Oocytes—After incubation for 2–5 days, the oocytes were studied at room temperature (20–22 °C) in a 90-μl chamber. The oocytes were superfused with MBS at a rate of ∼6 ml/min. Agonists and chemical agents were diluted in the bathing solution and applied to the oocytes for a specified time using a solenoid valve-controlled superfusion system. The agonist and chemical agents were diluted either directly in bathing solution or dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) before the dilution. The final Me2SO concentration was less than 0.1%, which did not produce detectable effects on the 5-HT-activated current under our experimental condition. Membrane currents were recorded by two-electrode voltage-clamp at a holding potential of –70 mV using a Gene Clamp 500 amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc.). The recording microelectrodes were filled with 3 m KCl and had electrical resistances of 0.5–3.0 megaohms. Data were routinely recorded on a chart recorder (Gould 2300S). Average values are expressed as mean ± S.E. Recording from Neuroblastoma Cells—N1E-115 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were prepared according to a method described previously (31Van Hooft J.A. Vijverberg H.P. Receptors Channels. 1995; 3: 7-12PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were continuously superfused with a solution containing 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH, ∼340 mosmol with sucrose). Membrane currents were recorded in the whole-cell patch clamp configuration using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon) at room temperature. Cells were held at –60 mV. Data were acquired using pCLAMP 8 software (Axon). Western Blot of Membrane Surface Proteins—Immediately after pretreatment with PMA, Xenopus oocytes expressing 5-HT3A receptors were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 20 min. The oocytes were then washed in PBS and incubated with N-hydroxysuccinimide-SS-biotin (NHS-SS-biotin; Pierce) at a concentration of 1.5 mg/ml in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C under a nonpermeabilized condition, as described previously (15Lan J.Y. Skeberdis V.A. Jover T. Grooms S.Y. Lin Y. Araneda R.C. Zheng X. Bennett M.V. Zukin R.S. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 382-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 34Hollmann M. Maron C. Heinemann S. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1331-1343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The oocytes were then washed extensively and homogenized, and the homogenate was centrifuged repeatedly at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C until all yolk granules and melanosomes were pelleted. The final supernatant was incubated with 100 μl of neutravidin-linked beads (Pierce) by end-over-end rotation for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were centrifuged and washed extensively to isolate bead-bound proteins. Labeled proteins were eluted from the beads by dithiothreitol-containing SDS-PAGE loading buffer and loaded onto 10% SDS/PAGE. After transfer onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Invitrogen), the surface and total proteins were blocked with PBS, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma) and 5% nonfat powdered milk and then incubated for 1 h with a polyclonal antibody (pAb120, 1:1000) directed to the extracellular N-terminal domain of the 5-HT3A receptor (5Spier A.D. Wotherspoon G. Nayak S.V. Nichols R.A. Priestley J.V. Lummis S.C. Brain Res. Mol. in Res. 1999; 67: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The proteins were washed, blotted with a 1:600 dilution of fluorescein-linked anti-rabbit Ig in PBS, and incubated with anti-fluorescein AP conjugate at a 1:2500 dilution in PBS for 1 h. The proteins detected by a Western blotting kit (Amersham Biosciences) were scanned using a Molecular Dynamics Storm Gel and Blot Imaging System with ImageQuant Image Analysis Software (Amersham Biosciences). Cell Surface Immunolabeling of Oocytes and N1E-115 Cells—Xenopus oocytes expressing 5-HT3A receptors were labeled with pAb120. In a pre-screening, oocytes exhibiting electrophysiological responses to 100 μm 5-HT of 3000–5000 nA were selected for this experiment. These oocytes were then incubated in 3 ml of MBS in the absence or presence of 300 nm PMA for 20 min. After PMA treatment, the oocytes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in calcium and magnesium-free PBS for 10 min, rinsed twice in PBS, and placed in blocking buffer (5% donkey serum, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, PBS, 0.04% Triton X-100) for 30 min. After an incubation with pAb120 at 1:1000 dilution for 1 h, the cells were washed 3 times in PBS for 5 min and labeled with donkey-anti-rabbit conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) as described previously (15Lan J.Y.

In a holding chamber, each oocyte was placed in a position with the equator perpendicular to the plane of imaging since most foreign receptors have been found to express within the animal pole of oocytes (14Chapell R.

Cross-sectional and tangential images of oocytes were viewed and photographed using a laser scanning microscope (LSM 5 Pascal, Zeiss), and the intensity was quantified by image analyzing software (Scion Image, Scion Co). N1E-115 cells were incubated in external recording solution in the absence and presence of PMA (300 nm) and immunolabeled using a method described previously (15Lan J.Y. Skeberdis V.A. Jover T. Grooms S.Y. Lin Y. Araneda R.C. Zheng X. Bennett M.V. Zukin R.S. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 382-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Data Analysis—Statistical analysis of concentration-response data was performed with the use of the nonlinear curve-fitting program ALLFIT (50Delean A. Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Am. J. Physiol. 1978; 235: E97-E102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Data were fitted to the equation using KaleidaGraph 3.5 (Synergy Software), Y={(Emax-Emin)/[1+(X/EC50)n]}+Emin(Eq. 1) where X and Y are concentration and response, respectively, E max and E min are the maximal and minimal responses, respectively, EC50 is the half-maximal concentration, and n is the slope factor (apparent Hill coefficient). Data were statistically compared by the paired t test or analysis of variance, as noted. Average values are expressed as the mean ± S.E. PKC Potentiates 5-HT-activated Current in Oocytes and N1E-115 Cells—Xenopus oocytes have been widely used as an expression system to study functional regulation of recombinant receptors by protein kinases and the underlying molecular mechanisms (11Leidenheimer N.J.

Although pretreatment with 100 nm 4α-PMA, an inactive form of PMA, for 10 min did not significantly alter the amplitude of currents activated by 5-HT (Fig. 1A) in an oocyte expressing 5-HT3A receptors, in the same cell, treatment with 10 nm PMA for 10 min increased the amplitude of inward current activated by 5-HT (Fig. 1B). The potentiation reached a maximum 10–20 min after the beginning of PMA application, lasted for 30–50 min, and was inhibited by the intracellular injection of a PKC inhibitory peptide 19–31 (PKCI) (Fig. 1C). The graph in Fig. 1D plots average current potentiation after treatment of the oocytes with PMA (solid circles), 4α-PMA (open circles), or PMA after the intracellular injection of PKCI (solid triangles). These observations are in accord with previous results from this (29Zhang L. Oz M. Weight F.F. Neuroreport. 1995; 6: 1464-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and other (32Coultrap S.J. Machu T.K. Receptors Channels. 2002; 8: 63-70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) laboratories showing that activation of PKC can potentiate 5-HT3A receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes. To determine whether PKC can modulate 5-HT3 receptor-mediated responses in N1E-115 cells, we performed whole cell recording on these cells. The amplitudes of currents evoked by 2 μm 5-HT at 2-min intervals were nearly identical under our experimental conditions (data not shown). Loading cells with 1 μm PKM (the constitutively active fragment of PKC) through a micropipette for 4 and 6 min increased the amplitude of 5-HT-activated currents (Fig. 2A). In a separate experiment, loading cells with 300 nm PMA (Fig. 2B) for 4 and 6 min increased the amplitude of the 5-HT current, whereas this did not occur using 4α-PMA (Fig. 2C). These findings suggest that enhancement of 5-HT current by PMA in N1E-115 cells is mediated by the activation of PKC. The potentiation appeared to reach the maximal magnitude within 4–6 min after PKM or PMA application. The bar graphs in Fig. 2D plot the average effect of 4-α PMA, PMA, and PKM without or with inclusion of 1 μm PKCI in the pipette. Whereas 4α-PMA was ineffective, PMA or PKM significantly increased the amplitude of 5-HT-activated current. Moreover, inclusion of PKCI significantly reduced the magnitude of potentiation by PMA or PKM from 209 ± 46 and 219 ± 40% of control to 104 ± 1 and 105 ± 5% of control, respectively (p < 0.001, unpaired t test, n = 5). The application of PKCI alone did not significantly alter the amplitude of 5-HT-activated current (data not shown).Fig. 2Effect of PKM, PMA, and 4α-PMA on 5-HT-activated currents in N1E-115 cells.

First, we used confocal microscopy to examine the effect of PMA on receptor surface expression by immunostaining nonpermeabilized oocytes. The uninjected oocytes and oocytes expressing 5-HT3A receptors with or without PMA pretreatment were incubated with pAb120 antibody followed by a fluorescein-tagged secondary antibody. The fluorescent surface labeling was viewed by confocal microscopy. The uninjected oocytes exhibited little or no immunofluorescence with this antibody directed against to the extracellular N-terminal domain of the receptor (data not shown). However, PMA increased membrane surface immunolabeling of oocytes expressing 5-HT3A receptors (Fig. 3B) as compared with controls (Fig. 3A). We did not observe intracellular fluorescence under any conditions, suggesting that the enhanced fluorescence is confined to the external surface of the cell membrane. A similar result was observed in our experiments using N1E-115 cells; as shown in Fig. 3, C and D, treatment with PMA for 5 min increased immunolabeling of N1E-115 cells (Fig. 3D) as compared with the controls (Fig. 3C). Quantitation of these images shows that the immunofluorescence in the oocytes expressing 5-HT3A receptors significantly increased to 282 ± 40% of control (p < 0.01, n = 8) after PMA treatment for 20 min (Fig. 3E). The immunofluorescence in the N1E-115 cells increased to 154 ± 24% that of control (p < 0.05, n = 8) after PMA treatment for 5 min (Fig. 3E). Next, we directly measured changes in surface expression of 5-HT3A receptors in oocytes using Western blots by labeling cell-surface proteins with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (39Chen N. Luo T. Raymond L.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6844-6854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The biotinylated surface proteins were separated from intracellular cell proteins by binding the biotinylated surface proteins to Neutravidin beads; these proteins were then eluted by treatment with dithiothreitol-containing buffer. Fig. 4A illustrates a representative Western blot of the surface expression of 5-HT3A receptors after treatment of the oocytes with 300 nm PMA for 20 min. PMA significantly increased the surface protein (Fig. 4A) with no change in the total protein (Fig. 4B) in oocytes expressing 5-HT3A receptors. Analysis of band densities (Fig. 4C) revealed an increase in surface expression of 5-HT3A receptors to 1.92 ± 0.14 times control (p < 0.01, n = 5), with no change in 5-HT3A receptor protein from the total cell (p > 0.05, n = 3). It should be noted that there is more immunoreactivity for the surface receptor than for the total receptor. This discrepancy might be due to the following. First, the starting material of the surface receptor protein produced by biotinylation experiments could be more concentrated than total receptor protein obtained from total cell lysate. Second, there might be a difference in the sample loading between the Western blot of the surface and the total receptor proteins.Fig. 4Increase in surface expression of 5-HT3A receptors in oocytes by PKC activation.

https://openalex.org/W1995133400,"Based on cDNA cloning and sequencing, human epiplakin has been classified as a member of the plakin protein family of cytolinkers. We report here the characterization of the mouse epiplakin gene locus and the isolation of full-length mouse epiplakin cDNA using BAC vectors. We found that the protein is encoded by a single remarkably large exon (>20 kb) that consists of a series of 0.8–1.5-kb-long DNA repeats, eight of which are virtually identical. Consequently, mouse epiplakin contains 16 plakin repeat domains, three more than reported for the human protein and eight more than predicted for the mouse protein based on the contig characterized by the Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium. Using antibodies raised to a highly conserved repeating epiplakin sequence domain, we show that the protein in cells is expressed in its full length (725 kDa), and we provide evidence that the size of human epiplakin previously may have been underestimated. In addition we show on transcript and protein levels that epiplakin is restricted to epithelial tissues and that its gene maps to mouse chromosome 15 (human chromosome 8). This study lays the groundwork for future genetic approaches aimed at defining the biological role of this unique protein.

This study lays the groundwork for future genetic approaches aimed at defining the biological role of this unique protein. Epiplakin was originally identified as a 450-kDa epidermal autoantigen showing immunoreactivity with the serum of a patient suffering from a subepidermal blistering disease (1Fujiwara S. Kohno K.

This family comprises large multidomain proteins that serve as bridging elements between cytoskeletal filaments and as filament anchoring structures of membrane-associated adhesive junctions. Concurrent with their role as cytoskeletal linker proteins, the functional impairment of these proteins leads to diseases accompanied by skin blistering and other types of tissue fragility (6Pulkkinen L.

Green K.J. Liem R.K. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 37-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 5Röper K. Gregory S.L. Brown N.H. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4215-4225Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Variably these proteins share several structural features, such as an amino-terminal actin-binding domain consisting of a pair of calponin homology domains, a plakin domain, a coiled coil, or spectrin repeat-containing rod domain, a microtubule-binding domain, and plakin repeat domains (PRDs) (4Leung C.L. Green K.J. Liem R.K. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 37-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The number of PRDs found in their structure is a hallmark of each plakin. For example, plectin contains six such domains, desmoplakin has three, BPAG1e has two, envoplakin has one, and periplakin has zero. Epiplakin consisting entirely of PRDs, 13 according to Ref. 3Fujiwara S. Takeo N. Otani Y. Parry D.A. Kunimatsu M. Lu R. Sasaki M. Matsuo N. Khaleduzzaman M. Yoshioka H. J. Biol.

However, the redundance of its PRDs makes it a very attractive model for studying the specific function(s) of this domain and of plakin cytolinker proteins in general. PRDs comprise a highly conserved ∼20-kDa core region, called a module (8Sonnhammer E.L. Eddy S.R. Durbin R. Proteins. 1997; 28: 405-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar, 9Janda L. Damborsky J. Rezniczek G.A. Wiche G. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 1064-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and a less conserved linker region of variable length. Modules are composed of four complete and one incomplete tandem copies of a 38-residue-long sequence motif, referred to in data bases as the plectin (PLEC) repeat (9Janda L. Damborsky J. Rezniczek G.A. Wiche G. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 1064-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). As predicted on the basis of computer modeling (9Janda L. Damborsky J. Rezniczek G.A. Wiche G. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 1064-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), x-ray crystallography showed each of the first four PLEC repeats to consist of a β-hairpin followed by two anti-parallel α-helices, whereas the last PLEC repeat forms a hairpin-helix-loop-hairpin-type motif (10Choi H.J. Park-Snyder S. Pascoe L.T. Green K.J. Weis W.I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 612-620PubMed Google Scholar). Although little is known about the function of these modules, the linkers connecting them are thought to serve as binding sites for interacting proteins. For example in plectin, the best studied plakin to date, the binding site for intermediate filaments (IFs) of various types (vimentin, cytokeratins, and desmin) has been mapped to a stretch of about 50 amino acid residues in the linker region between PRD modules 5 and 6 (11Nikolic B. Mac Nulty E. Mir B. Wiche G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1455-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). For desmoplakin, too, it could be shown that residues downstream of its third PRD module were important for keratin binding, whereas the linker between the second and third module as well as the second PRD module itself have been reported to be required for vimentin interaction (12Stappenbeck T.S. Green K.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1197-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 13Stappenbeck T.S. Bornslaeger E.A. Corcoran C.M. Luu H.H. Virata M.L. Green K.J. J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 21495-21503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) (note that the PRD modules of desmoplakin are also known as A, B, and C domains). Binding to keratins and neuronal IFs has also been demonstrated for the PRDs of BPAG1e and BPAG1n (16Yang Y. Dowling J. Yu Q.C. Kouklis P. Cleveland D.W. Fuchs E. Cell. 1996; 86: 655-665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). To lay a basis for future genetic studies, here we characterized the mouse epiplakin gene locus and determined the nucleotide sequence of the mouse epiplakin cDNA in full. We found that the entire coding sequence of mouse epiplakin is contained within a very large (∼20 kb) single exon encoding a series of virtually identical DNA repeats. Only by using BAC technology, but not standard DNA cloning methods, were we able to clone the gene and establish its nucleotide sequence. Our analysis shows that mouse epiplakin contains 16 PRDs, and its size is therefore considerably larger than that reported for the human ortholog. Because we could confirm a similar large size of mouse and human epiplakin by immunoblotting, it is possible that the size of human epiplakin in former studies has been underestimated. In addition, we show the immunolocalization of epiplakin on frozen sections of mouse tissues using a newly generated, remarkably potent antiserum, and we document the tissue distribution of epiplakin transcripts using RNase protection assays. The predicted structure of epiplakin is discussed in comparison with that of other plakin family members. Isolation of cDNA and DNA Sequencing—cDNA clones were isolated from a mouse skin cDNA library (strain C57BL/6; Stratagene) using a 830-bp-long rat epiplakin cDNA fragment as probe. 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends as well as PCR analyses of MarathonReady™ cDNA derived from mouse kidney and 11-day-old mouse embryo (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) were performed using Advantage cDNA polymerase (Clontech) in a Perkin-Elmer GeneAmp 9700 thermal cycler, following the protocols supplied by the manufacturers. Nested epiplakin-specific primers were designed with a melting temperature higher than 60 °C using the Oligo 4.0 program. Optimized PCR conditions for the first PCR consisted of five cycles of 94 °C for 5 s and 72 °C for 3 min, 5 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, and 70 °C for 3 min and 30 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s and 68 °C for 3 min. 2 μl of a 1:50 dilution of the initial PCR was used in a second round of PCR with nested primers (40 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, 64 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 3 min). PCR products were cloned into plasmid pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) for further analyses and sequencing. The nucleotide sequences were determined by the chain termination method using the DyeDeoxy terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Isolation of Genomic Clones and Analysis of Exon-Intron Organization—To isolate genomic clones, a mouse genomic library (strain 129; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was screened using mouse epiplakin cDNA clone pDS 104 and a 900-bp SalI/XbaI fragment of lambda clone EP1 as probes. Exon-intron boundaries were identified by comparison of genomic DNA and cDNA sequences. The intron was sequenced in its entirety. Data Base Search and Sequence Alignments—Data base searches were performed using the BLAST program (17Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69694) Google Scholar). All of the sequence alignments were generated with the LALIGN program (www.ch.embnet.org/software/LALIGN_form.html) using the algorithm of Huang and Miller (18Huang X. Miller W. Adv. Appl. Math. 1991; 12: 337-357Crossref Scopus (833) Google Scholar). Secondary structure predictions were made using the programs GOR IV (19Garnier J. Gibrat J.F. Robson B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 540-553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), HNN (20Guermeur Y. Combinaison de Classifieurs Statistiques, Application a la Prediction de la Structure Secondaire des Proteines.

Siddiqui A.S. Finlay M. Barton G.J. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 892-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). Chromosomal Gene Mapping—Genetic mapping was conducted using the interspecific backcross panel BSS ((C57BL/6JEi × SPRET/Ei)F1 × SPRET/Ei) from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, MN) (23Rowe L.B. Nadeau J.H. Turner R. Frankel W.N. Letts V.A. Eppig J.T. Ko M.S. Thurston S.J. Birkenmeier E.H. Mamm. Genome. 1994; 5: 253-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). DNA (25 ng) of each panel was amplified by PCR (40 cycles of 94 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min and a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min) using a high fidelity polymerase mix (24Barnes W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2216-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar) and primers located in the intron of epiplakin (forward primer: CTCCACTCCCAACCCAGAGCAGGCCCG) and at the 5′ end of exon 2 (reverse primer: GCCCCCACTGAAACCAGCATCAAGAAG). Backcross progeny mice were typed by NruI polymorphism, a restriction site present in C56BL/6J but not Mus spretus. 10 μl of each PCR were digested with NruI in a total volume of 20 μl and analyzed by 1.8% agarose gel electrophoresis. The results were submitted to the Jackson Laboratory to be analyzed using the Map Manager program (25Manly K.F. Mamm. Genome. 1993; 4: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). RNase Protection Assays—cDNA sequences used as probes were subcloned into pSP64 (Promega, Madison, WI) by PCR cloning using primers flanked with suitable restriction sites. RNA probes were transcribed from linearized plasmids in the presence of [α-32P]GTP (800 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using SP6 RNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science) and subsequently purified on 8% polyacrylamide gels. All antisense RNAs used included a piece of vector sequence to ensure that the obtained bands corresponded exclusively to protected RNA and not to remnants of undigested probes. Total RNA was extracted from tissues according to Chomczynski and Sacchi (26Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63087) Google Scholar) and quantified by absorbance at 260 nm; the 260/280 nm absorbance ratios were about 1.6. To perform the assay, 10 μg of total RNA were coprecipitated with an excess of probe (50,000 cpm) and hybridized at 60 °C for 16 h in 10 μl of 80% formamide, 0.4 m NaCl, 40 mm PIPES, and 1 mm EDTA. To digest RNA, 350 μl of 100 units/ml RNase T1 and 5 μg/ml RNase A (both from Roche Diagnostics) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA were added, and the mixtures were incubated for1hat37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 μl of 20% SDS and 5 μl of proteinase K (20 mg/ml; Merck) followed by incubation for 15 min at 37 °C. Samples were extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, denatured at 90 °C for 3 min, and subsequently analyzed on 8% polyacrylamide gels containing 7.7 m urea. Protected fragments were visualized by autoradiography at –78 °C for 20 h up to 4 days. A probe specific for murine ribosomal protein S16 mRNA yielding a protected band of 90 nucleotides, served as an internal control, and was used in all samples. The signals were quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA), and the obtained relative intensities were normalized for the size and guanosine content of the fragments and the amount of RNA loaded as determined by the S16 signal. Expression of Fusion Proteins in Bacteria—A mouse epiplakin EcoRI cDNA fragment coding for amino acids 6041–6364 was cloned into the bacterial fusion vectors pGEX 4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) and pMal-c2 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). GST and maltose binding protein fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). GST fusion proteins were solubilized by sonication in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 and purified over a glutathione-Sepharose affinity column. Maltose binding protein fusion proteins were brought into solution by sonication in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA and purified using amylose affinity chromatography. Preparation of Antibodies—GST epiplakin fusion protein (100 μg) in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline was mixed with 350 μl of either Freund's complete (for initial subcutaneous injections) or incomplete (for six booster injections at intervals of 4 weeks) adjuvant (Sigma). To prepare serum, blood was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and subsequently centrifuged for 20 min at 4000 rpm. The antibodies were affinity-purified by column chromatography on maltose binding protein fusion proteins immobilized on Sepharose beads and stored frozen in 0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at a concentration equivalent to that in the serum. Southern and Northern Blotting—Genomic and BAC DNA were isolated using standard procedures (27Laird P.W. Zijderveld A. Linders K. Rudnicki M.A. Jaenisch R. Berns A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar) and the large construct kit (Qiagen), respectively. Digested DNA was separated on 0.8% agarose gels with 25 V for 72 h at 4 °C. DNA was transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond N+; Amersham Biosciences), the blots were hybridized with a α-32P-labeled epiplakin fragment corresponding to one of its repeats, and signals were visualized by autoradiography (28Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7264) Google Scholar). RNA was prepared from tissues using the RNeasy Protect Midi kit (Qiagen). Northern blots were prepared according to Qiagen News (48Cartwright, E., Dawson, C., Frances, S., McGarvey, D., Phillips, J., and Williams, J. (2000) Qiagen News, Issue 3, pp. 18–21Google Scholar, 49Cartwright, E., Dawson, C., Frances, S., McGarvey, D., Phillips, J., and Williams, J. (2000) Qiagen News, Issue 4, pp. 22–25Google Scholar) and probed similarly to Southern blots. Immunoblotting and Immunohistochemistry—For immunoblotting, the tissue homogenates were prepared from newborn mice by mechanical disruption as described (29Eger A. Stockinger A. Wiche G. Foisner R. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1307-1316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immortalized, p53-deficient mouse keratinocytes (30Andrä K. Kornacker I. Jörgl A. Zörer M. Spazierer D. Fuchs P. Fischer I.

Hornung J. Markham A. Fusenig N.E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (3440) Google Scholar) were lysed in 50 mm Hepes-HCl, pH 7.0, 5 mm MgCl2,1mm EGTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar) and transferred to nitrocellulose sheets (Schleicher & Schuell). The blots were developed using antibodies to epiplakin (diluted 1:75,000), and a rabbit antiserum was raised against a recombinant amino-terminal protein fragment corresponding to exons 9–12 (Glu419–Val451) of rat plectin (diluted 1:6000), followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories; dilution, 1:12,500) and visualization of proteins with SuperSignal substrate (Pierce). For immunofluorescence microscopy, selected tissues were shock-frozen in isopentane, cooled with liquid N2, sectioned on a cryomicrotome, and fixed with acetone at –20 °C. All of the sections (2 μm) were incubated with antibodies to epiplakin at a dilution of 1:10000, followed by incubation with Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories). The Mouse Epiplakin Gene: Eight of Sixteen Sequence Repeats Are Nearly Identical—When we screened a rat genomic library with a rat plectin cDNA probe, covering the rod domain and one and a half plectin modules, two overlapping lambda clones were isolated that carried sequences differing from plectin. 2S. Oehler, unpublished data. Analysis of these clones showed that parts of them were highly homologous to published partial sequences of a human epidermal 450-kDa autoantigen (2Fujiwara S. Kohno K. Iwamatsu A. Naito I. Shinkai H. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 106: 1125-1130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), later identified as epiplakin (3Fujiwara S. Takeo N. Otani Y. Parry D.A. Kunimatsu M. Lu R. Sasaki M. Matsuo N. Khaleduzzaman M. Yoshioka H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13340-13347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To isolate the gene and entire cDNA, a mouse skin cDNA library was screened using a PCR-amplified part of the isolated rat sequence as a probe. The screening yielded a 2420-bp cDNA clone (pDS 104), which contained a stop codon and a poly(A+) signal (Fig. 1). By screening a genomic mouse lambda library with this cDNA, two clones (EP1 and EP10) were obtained, and by gene walking an additional clone (EP4) was obtained, together spanning a total of 22 kb (Fig. 1). Subcloning and sequence analysis of clone EP1 revealed a (∼10 kb) large ORF, which was transcribed in its entirety, as shown using a series of overlapping PCRs on mouse cDNA libraries from kidney and 17-day-old embryos (data not shown). 5′-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends using marathon 17-day-old embryo mouse cDNA yielded 1087 bp of cDNA upstream of the 10-kb ORF. Southern blot and sequence analyses showed that this sequence corresponded to a noncoding novel exon (exon 1), separated from exon 2 by an intron of 6384 bp (Fig. 1). A putative start ATG at the 5′ end of exon 2 fulfilled the Kozak consensus criteria (33Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4160) Google Scholar) for start codons at positions –3 and +4. Clone EP10, which was partially overlapping with EP1 (Fig. 1), turned out to be unstably replicating in E. coli hosts, because recombination events generated lambda inserts differing in size by about 1.5 kb (data not shown). This rendered clone EP10 unfit for any further analysis. To isolate and characterize the genomic region 3′ of clone EP1, we used a BAC clone shown by BLAST search to harbor epiplakin genomic sequences (RPCI23, clone 208H22). The characterization of this clone by restriction enzyme digestion and Southern blotting enabled us to identify a large genomic region (>12 kb), starting near the 3′ end of clone EP1 and consisting of an unknown number of ∼1.5 kb repeats (Fig. 1). The length of the repeats was determined by digestion of the clone with either BamHI or BglII and Southern blotting of the fragments using a carboxyl-terminal epiplakin fragment as a probe (data not shown). Because no suitable singular restriction sites could be found in this region, the entire gene segment containing the repeats was subcloned into a bacterial artificial (BAC) vector (pBeloBac 11) via two flanking HindIII restriction enzyme sites to yield clone pDS 166 (Fig. 1). KpnI digestion of clone pDS 166 and gel electrophoresis of the fragments showed that the region containing the repeats comprised ∼13.8 kb (Fig. 2A). Knowing the exact length of the sequences flanking the repeat region (5′ KpnI-BglII fragment, 1140 bp; 3′ BglII-KpnI fragment, 345 bp), the number of 1.5 kb repeats could be defined as eight (1140 + 8 × 1545 + 345 = 13,845 bp). Because these repeats may be subject to recombination events in meiosis because of their sequence identity, we examined the genomic stability of the epiplakin locus in three different mouse strains. Southern blot analysis of KpnI-digested DNA from strains B6, CBA, and 129 revealed no differences in the length of fragments (Fig. 2B), confirming genomic integrity of all repeats in different genetic backgrounds. In the absence of singular restriction sites in clone pDS 166 and because of its sequence redundancy, the analysis of its exact nucleotide sequence posed a major challenge. Following a shotgun cloning strategy, clone pDS 166 was digested with either BglII or BamHI, and the 1.5-kb fragments generated were subcloned (Fig. 3A). Because of the lack of potentially recombining similar sequences, single 1.5-kb clones were stably replicating and therefore could be subjected to sequence analysis. In total 21 BamHI and 30 BglII clones were analyzed. Additional sequence information about the 5′ and 3′ ends of this highly homologous repeat region was obtained from clones pDS 167 and pDS 170 that were isolated using singular up-stream or downstream restriction sites. Based on this analysis we could identify four different classes of BamHI and five different classes of BglII subclones (Fig. 3B). Sequence alignment of a 5′ SpeI-BamHI fragment (pDS 167) with BglII fragments enabled the extension of the exact sequence until the 3′ end of the first BglII fragment, because only one class of BglII fragments (class I) revealed the same nucleotides (T, T, and G) at variable positions 1–3 (Fig. 3, B and C). However, gene walking in the 3′ direction of clone pDS 167 by searching for a unique class of overlapping BamHI clones was not possible, because more than one class (classes I and III) matched nucleotides A and C at the variable positions 4 and 5 of the BglII class I clone. Performing BglII partial digestion, we were also able to clone the very 3′ 1.5-kb BglII fragment as part of a BglII-KpnI subclone (pDS 170) of pDS 166 (Fig. 3A). Sequence analysis of this clone revealed the nucleotides C, C, A, T, C, and T at variable positions 1–5, and 1, respectively (Fig. 3B). Again, however, it was impossible to extend the sequence of pDS 170 in the 5′ direction, because no unique classes were found, but two BamHI subclone classes (classes I and IV) were identified with nucleotides C, C, and A at variable positions 1–3 of the overlapping region. Consequently, the sequences of only two (the first and last) of the eight 1.5-kb BglII fragments identified could unambiguously be determined, and the order of the other six repeats remained undefined. Because all of the isolated BamHI fragments carried a cytosine at the variable positions 1 and 2, these positions could be specified in all repeats, leaving just three positions (positions 3–5) in repeats 2–7 undetermined (Fig. 3C). Consequently, a sequence could be deduced that lacked exact nucleotide specifications only at three positions within each of the six interior BglII 1.5-kb fragments. The two alternative nucleotides found at each of these positions gave rise to different amino acid residues only at positions 3 (Gly or Glu) and 4 (Glu or Val) (Fig. 3C). At position 5 the alternative nucleotides were at the wobble position of lysine codons. In summary, our analysis revealed that the mouse epiplakin gene comprises two exons, a noncoding exon 1 and a large (∼20 kb) coding exon 2 (Fig. 1). Overall, the isolated lambda clones and BAC subclones resulted in a continuous span of 42 kb of genomic sequence. Exceptionally Large Size of Epiplakin Confirmed on Transcript and Protein Levels—A Northern blot analysis of RNA isolated from mouse salivary gland using a 802-bp carboxyl-terminal cDNA fragment of epiplakin as a probe for hybridization revealed the presence of a very large transcript (Fig. 4A). Based on the size of plectin transcripts (34Liu C.G. Maercker C. Castañón M.J. Hauptmann R. Wiche G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4278-4283Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), the size of epiplakin transcripts was estimated as ∼22 kb. This correlated very well with the transcript size predicted: 1.5-kb 5′-untranslated region, 20-kb ORF, and 1-kb 3′-untranslated region (Fig. 1). In the absence of other detectable signals, the expression of other major isoforms caused by splice events within exon 2 of epiplakin could be ruled out. The 19,644-bp ORF of epiplakin potentially encodes a protein of 725 kDa. To confirm this size we raised antibodies to a GST fusion protein containing a fragment of epiplakin (residues 6041–6364) without any significant sequence homologies to plectin, desmoplakin, or other proteins. The antibodies obtained were affinity-purified and used for Western blotting. Analyzing proteins extracted from a newborn mouse, we could detect a single band of molecular weight considerably higher than that of plectin (>500,000), fitting very well the expected molecular mass of 725 kDa (Fig. 4B). An immunoreactive protein band of similar size was observed when protein extracts of human HaCaT cells were analyzed, indicating that human epiplakin had the same apparent molecular weight as the mouse protein (Fig. 4C). This deviated from an earlier report where the molecular mass of human epiplakin was predicted to be 552 kDa (3Fujiwara S. Takeo N. Otani Y. Parry D.A. Kunimatsu M. Lu R. Sasaki M. Matsuo N.

Because these collective results have been obtained using different TBPs, full-length and truncated proteins, and diverse experimental conditions, key issues relating to the behavior and structure of TBP-promoter complexes remain unresolved. The 180-residue C-terminal DNA binding domains (CTD) of the TBPs from yeast (yTBP), human (hTBP), and Arabidopsis thaliana (aTBP) are highly conserved, with greater than 80% homology and with generally conservative substitutions in the remainder. The pseudo-symmetric TBPCTD contacts the duplex along the distorted minor groove via interactions that are largely non-polar and hydrophobic. The amino acid residues involved in these DNA contacts are nearly 100% conserved, with only a single variation in which Arg-204 in hTBP changes to Lys-110 in yTBP and Lys-68 in aTBP (2Juo Z.S. Chiu T.K. Leiberman P.M. Baikalov I. Berk A.J. Dickerson R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain is, in contrast, heterogenous between the yeast (60 amino acids (14Horikoshi M. Wang C.K. Fujii H. Cromlish J.A. Weil P.A. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1989; 341: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar)) and human (159 amino acids (15Peterson M.G. Tanese N. Pugh B.F. Tijan R. Science. 1990; 248: 1625-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar)) proteins and severely truncated in the A. thaliana protein (18 amino acids (16Nikolov D.B. Hu S.H. Lin J. Gasch A. Hoffmann A. Horikoshi M. Chua N.H. Roeder R.G. Burley S.K. Nature. 1992; 360: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar)). How these similarities and differences among TBP molecules from different species affect the TBP-DNATATA interaction and structure remains an open question. A limited answer has emerged from crystallographic studies on the C-terminal domains of yTBP and hTBP and the (analogous) full-length aTBP, bound to DNATATA: the structures of these three TBP-DNA complexes are essentially identical in the crystalline form (2Juo Z.S.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3217-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Beyond these results, however, comparisons of the behavior of yTBP, hTBP, and aTBP with DNATATA and the structures of the resulting binary complexes must be inferred from unrelated experiments conducted in different laboratories using any one of these three proteins, either as the full-length or truncated C-terminal form. In addition, although a clear understanding of the behavior of the human protein is of obvious interest, most of the work done to date has utilized Saccharomyces cerevisiae, or yeast, TBP. The extent to which these latter results also hold true for hTBP is currently largely a matter of speculation. The recognition mechanisms of TBP for promoter DNA and the solution structures of TBP-DNA complexes have been primary research interests in our laboratory for several years (4Parkhurst K.M.

Our focus has been 2-fold: 1) identifying and comparing detailed kinetic models for TBP binding to consensus (TATAa/tAa/tN) and variant promoter TATA sequences, and 2) evaluating the solution structure of the TBP-DNATATA complex. These studies utilize DNA duplexes that are labeled with fluorescent dyes that serve as a donor-acceptor pair for Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). The methodologies employed in these biophysical studies allow the collection of kinetic data in real time as well as precise measurements of inter-dye distances that correspond to the extent of helical bending in the TBP-DNATATA complexes. Our prior work has been conducted using full-length S. cerevisiae TBP. Function studies conducted using three TATA sequences have shown multistep interaction mechanisms overall with concurrent binding and DNA bending (7Parkhurst K.M. Richards R.M. Brenowitz M.

The associated structure studies have revealed TATA sequence-dependent DNA bend angles for yTBP-DNA complexes in solution, with bends varying from ∼30 to ∼80° for the seven sequences examined. These bend angles are strongly correlated with relative transcription activity (8Wu J. Parkhurst K.M. Powell R.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14614-14622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The sequence dependence of the yTBP-induced DNATATA bend angles in solution complexes is in direct contrast to the invariance of 11 crystalline yTBPCTD-DNATATA complexes: all of these complexes, in which the TATA sequence substitutions were identical or similar to those in the solution studies, had essentially identical crystal structures with ∼80° DNA bend angles (6Patikoglou G.A. Kim J.L. Sun L. Yang S.H. Kodadek T. Burley S.K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3217-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In solution, only consensus TATA sequences are bent by yTBP as severely as in the crystal structures in the absence of high osmolyte concentrations (9Wu J. Parkhurst K.M. Powell R.M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14623-14627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These functional and structural differences highlight the fact that generalizations cannot safely be made about the behavior and architecture of TBP-promoter complexes between full-length and truncated proteins, between complexes in solution and in crystals, or among TBPs from diverse species and emphasize the need for clear comparative studies. To directly address this issue, we have expanded our biophysical studies to include the interaction of full-length wild-type human TBP with promoter DNA. The work reported herein includes the binding affinity and kinetics of hTBP with DNA bearing the adenovirus major late promoter (AdMLP) and is, to our knowledge, the first published kinetic data obtained in real time for this interaction. In addition, we estimate the bend angle induced in this consensus sequence by hTBP in solution. Our results show that hTBP rapidly and simultaneously binds and bends promoter DNA and induces a bend angle even larger than that induced by yTBP. This reaction is broadly comparable with those with the yeast protein, although the mechanistic details clearly differ, and the distortion in the helical trajectory appears to be significantly larger in the human protein-DNA complex. Our results differ sharply with the inferences drawn from the electrophoretic mobility shift assay studies of Zhao and Herr (19Zhao X. Herr W. Cell. 2002; 108: 615-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). They recently proposed a model in which full-length wild-type hTBP binds initially to consensus DNAAdMLP to yield an unstable complex having unbent DNA, with introduction of the helical bend occurring only after ∼30 min. The significant differences between their results and ours are discussed. Materials—The 14-nucleotide DNA oligomer bearing the AdMLP TATA box sequence was labeled on the coding strand at the 5′ and 3′ ends with TAMRA and fluorescein, respectively (TAMRA*CGCTATAAAAGGGC*fluorescein, ‘T*ML*F‘), attached via 6-carbon linkers. This probe and the corresponding probes having only the fluorescein label were synthesized and highly purified by TriLink Biotechnologies, Inc. (San Diego, CA). The unlabeled complementary strand was also obtained from TriLink. These same probes have been fully characterized and used extensively in previous studies of yeast TBP-DNA binding (4Parkhurst K.M.

Recombinant human TBP, containing only the native amino acid sequence, was expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) and purified, with slight modifications, as described (20Pugh B.F. Methods Mol. Biol. 1995; 37: 359-367PubMed Google Scholar). In the purification, non-ionic detergents were omitted, thus avoiding any potential complications from abnormal association/aggregation, such as those seen previously with yeast TBP (21Daugherty M.A. Brenowitz M.

Protein purity was analyzed using SDS-PAGE with Coomassie stain, and the mass of the protein was determined using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight mass spectrometry. The protein activity was determined as described (8Wu J. Parkhurst K.M. Powell R.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Biol.

Briefly, equimolar concentrations of duplex DNA and protein were mixed at concentrations ≫K d and the fractional saturation determined from the steady-state spectra. The ratio of the observed to predicted binding gave the fraction of active protein. The concentrations reported are for active protein. All experiments were conducted using ≤800 nm protein, concentrations at which protein dimerization is negligible. 2M. Daugherty, manuscript in preparation. All reactions were conducted at 20 ± 0.05 °C in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μm leupeptin, and 10% glycerol. Theory of FRET—Förster developed the basic theory for the phenomenon of the resonant transfer of energy between a suitable donor fluorophore and acceptor chromophore (22Förster V.T. Ann.

S.

Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 419-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). An extensive body of literature established since that time has further addressed FRET theory and its application in myriad biomolecular systems. Very briefly, quantum mechanical coupling of the electronic transitions in two fluorophores (reflected in the overlap of the donor emission and acceptor absorption spectra) permits excited state energy in the donor molecule to be transferred directly to the excited state of the acceptor molecule without emission and re-absorption of a photon. The probability of such transfer depends on the extent to which the transition moments of these two molecules assume the appropriate relative orientations. The rate of the energy transfer process depends on the inverse sixth power of the distance separating the two dyes, conferring an exquisite dependence of the transfer rate on the inter-dye distance. The extent to which energy is transferred is readily observable in the fluorescence emission spectra of donor and acceptor dyes attached to biomolecules; efficient energy transfer decreases the emission intensity of the donor and increases that of the acceptor. We have published detailed discussions of FRET as it is used in the present work, utilizing DNA labeled with 3′-fluorescein (donor) and 5′-TAMRA (acceptor), in a number of related studies (4Parkhurst K.M.

(Lawrenceville, NJ), model A-1010 steady-state fluorimeter together with a Coherent (Santa Clara, CA) model INNOVA 70–4 argon ion laser tuned to 488 nm with the power set at 15–20 milliwatts. DNA duplex was formed using 8 nm T*ML*F with 5× complement, shown in separate experiments to yield full hybridization of the labeled strand. The titration was conducted using seven concentrations of hTBP ranging from 0 to 175 nm. Each successive titration point was obtained using a new duplex preparation in order to minimize stirring with protein present. Spectra were collected from 500 to 600 nm and base line corrected at each hTBP concentration. Determinations of the corresponding fractional DNA saturation, the equilibrium association constant (K a), and the titration end point have been described (7Parkhurst K.M. Richards R.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1327-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Fluorescence stopped-flow data were collected and analyzed exactly as described (7Parkhurst K.M.

Briefly, a customized stopped-flow device having a 1.8-ms dead time was used to collect a total of 2000 points/curve over ≤400 s with the time constant = 12.24 ms and the fluorescein emission isolated using a 520-nm interference filter. Replicate curves were corrected for background and very well fit to a tri-exponential decay model. The slowest phase, which has been shown to correspond to fluorescein photobleaching (4Parkhurst K.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7459-7465Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 7Parkhurst K.M. Richards R.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1327-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), was extracted, and the resulting decay parameters were averaged. Previous mechanistic studies using yTBP were conducted in buffer identical to that in the present study but without 10% glycerol. To ensure an unambiguous comparison between the hTBP results and those obtained previously using yTBP, the binding isotherm and stopped-flow kinetics were re-collected for the yTBP-T*MLdpx*F interaction in the presence and absence of 10% glycerol using 200 nm yTBP. The functional and structural characteristics of the interaction of hTBP with the AdMLP consensus TATA sequence (TATAAAAG) have been investigated in solution using full-length, wild-type protein and fluorescently labeled DNA. The protein was expressed and purified without tagging or exposure to non-ionic detergents. SDS-gel electrophoresis showed purity >99% and an estimated mass from the relative mobility of ∼38 kDa (Fig. 1), consistent with that of the native protein. The mass obtained from matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight spectral analysis confirmed that the purified protein was full length. The fluorescence assay showed the DNA binding activity to be ≥70%, slightly lower than the activity of the yTBP determined previously using the same assay and independently confirmed by DNase footprinting. A full characterization of the protein will be reported elsewhere.2 The 14-bp duplex DNA (“T*MLdpx*F,” top strand TAMRA-5′-CGCTATAAAAGGGC-3′-fluorescein) and similar probes have been used extensively in our studies with yTBP (4Parkhurst K.M.

The fluorescence emission from the two dyes directly signals changes in the distance separating the TAMRA and fluorescein dyes, due to the corresponding changes in FRET (Fig. 2), and has been shown in our previously published studies to be highly sensitive to changes in the 5′–3′ distance as the duplex is bound and bent by TBP (details in the legend for Fig. 2). Steady-state spectra are shown in Fig. 2 for T*MLdpx*F alone in solution (A) and hTBP-bound (B). The latter was obtained within 1 min following addition of the hTBP to the DNA. The dramatic difference in the signal between the unbound and bound DNA derives from a large decrease in the distance between the 5′-TAMRA and the 3′-fluorescein and has been shown to directly reflect the extent of helical bending induced by the protein (8Wu J. Parkhurst K.M. Powell R.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14614-14622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 9Wu J. Parkhurst K.M. Powell R.M.

Both spectra were monitored for an additional 60 min and yielded superimposable spectra over this period (Fig. 2, A and B). This observation is particularly important for the TBP-DNA complex (Fig. 2B) because it demonstrates the invariance of the conformation of the hTBP-bound duplex throughout a 1-h period. These spectra are sufficiently sensitive to changes in the DNA structure that changes of even a few degrees in the helical bend of the protein-bound DNA can be precisely distinguished (28Hardwidge P.R. Wu J. Williams S.L. Parkhurst K.M. Parkhurst L.J. Maher III, L.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7732-7742Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 29Parkhurst L.J. Parkhurst K.M. Powell R. Wu J. Williams S. Biopolymers. 2002; 61: 180-200Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In addition, such superimposable spectra reflect the stability of the DNA and protein preparations. Titrations of T*MLdpx*F with hTBP were conducted using steady-state emission spectra. The fractional DNA saturation determined from the spectral changes observed at each point was used to construct the equilibrium binding isotherm (Fig. 3). These data reveal the high affinity of the human protein for this duplex, with a dissociation equilibrium constant = 5 nm at 20 °C. By comparison, yeast TBP binds the AdMLP sequence with K d = 21 nm (10Powell R.M. Parkhurst K.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29782-29791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), a value confirmed in the present study to be independent of the presence or absence of 10% glycerol. The percent decrease in the ratio of the peak emission intensities at full DNA saturation was calculated to be ∼60%. This spectral change upon hTBP binding is significantly larger than the 44 ± 1.5% decrease obtained with yTBP binding to the same labeled DNA duplex. The corresponding control experiments show that the emission of the donor-only labeled duplex, MLdpx*F, is invariant for the unbound and TBP-bound duplex for both the human and yeast proteins. The implications of these observations for helical bending are discussed below. The kinetic trace of hTBP binding to the AdMLP duplex was monitored using fluorescence stopped-flow (Fig. 4, closed cir-cles). In these measurements, the change in the emission intensity of the fluorescein peak is monitored as a function of time following rapid addition and mixing of hTBP and T*MLdpx*F (dead time <2 ms). This association curve shows the real time course of the process in which the DNA population shifts from being completely unbound and free in solution to being nearly"

However, the normal function of MLL is less understood. Homozygous knockouts of murine Mll were embryonal lethal, while heterozygous disruption led to aberrant hox gene expression associated with skeletal malformations, growth retardation, and impaired hematopoiesis. To understand MLL functions on the molecular level, gene expression profiling experiments were performed with a pair of murine cell lines (MLL(+/+) and MLL(-/-)). Microarray hybridization experiments revealed 197 potential target genes that are differentially expressed, providing new and important clues about MLL functions."

Previous work from this laboratory defined two different p53 response elements, termed P1 and P2, located at nucleotide positions –70 and –707, respectively, in the rat bradykinin B2 receptor promoter. In this study, through manipulation of the DNA sequence and context, we demonstrate opposing roles for P1 and P2 as transcriptional activator and repressor, respectively. Deletion of P1 abrogates p53-mediated activation. P1 maintains its role as an activator upon relocation to the P2 site and activates transcription from a heterologous promoter construct. Thus, P1 is a bona fide positive p53-response element. In contrast, deletion of P2 enhances P1-induced activation. P2 represses transcription when substituted for P1 or when relocated midway between P1 and P2. P2-mediated repression is sequence-dependent, because it is reversed to activation when P2 is substituted by the P1 or p53 consensus sequences. Moreover, site-directed mutagenesis that converts P2 to a higher affinity p53-binding site results in transcriptional activation rather than repression. Surprisingly, P2 strongly activates a heterologous promoter. Thus, P2-mediated transcriptional repression is both sequence- and context-dependent. Investigations into the mechanisms of P2-mediated repression indicate that it is trichostatin-insensitive and unaffected by CBP or mutation of the minimal repression C-terminal domain of p53. However, gel shift assays suggest that p53 competes with other transcriptional activators for binding to overlapping binding sequences within the P2 element. In conclusion, this study provides a rare example of a transcription factor having two divergent functional effects that are sequence- and context-dependent. The interplay of P1 and P2 may be important in the regulation of bradykinin B2 receptor gene expression in response to inflammatory stress and during development.

The consensus p53-binding motif consists of two half-sites separated by 0–13 nucleotides (18Wang L. Wu Q. Qiu P. Mirza A. McGuirk M. Kirschmeier P. Greene J.R. Wang Y. Pickett C.B. Liu S. J. Biol.

Each half-site consists of the sequence RRRC(A/T)(T/A)GYYY. p53 binds the response element as a tetramer, each half-site bound to a p53 dimer (24McLure K.G. Lee P.W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3342-3350Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). p53 also represses transcription of a number of genes. The mechanisms of p53-mediated repression are not well understood, because the majority of p53-repressed genes do not contain a consensus response element. Although initial studies suggested that p53 selectively represses TATA box-containing promoters, more recent studies indicated that p53 is capable of repressing TATA-less promoters as well (25Gopalkrishnan R.V.

Protein-protein interactions with the basal transcription machinery have been proposed as the underlying mechanism for p53-mediated repression of these promoters. Binding to and interference with the binding or function of upstream transcriptional activators such as SP1 and AP-1 has also been shown to mediate p53-induced repression (26Sun Y. Wenger L.

In addition, recruitment of chromatin-modifying enzymes or modification of the acetylation status of p53 by interaction with and recruitment of histone deacetylase plays an important role in p53-mediated repression, for some (e.g. MAP-4 and α-fetoprotein (AFP) 1The abbreviations used are: AFP, α-fetoprotein; BdkrB2 and B2R, bradykinin type 2 receptor gene and protein, respectively; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyl transferase; EMSA, electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay; TSA, trichostatin A; CBP, cAMP response element binding protein (CREB)-binding protein; MRD, minimal repression domain of p53; CRE, cAMP-response element; CMV, cytomegalovirus; nt, nucleotide(s); HDAC, histone deacetylase.) but not all genes (e.g. p202) (30Barlev N.A.

In several instances, p53 mediates promoter repression via direct DNA binding to a canonical p53-binding motif, as has been demonstrated in the AFP, p202, and survivin genes (31Ogden S.K. Lee K.C.

At least in one case, the AFP gene, p53-mediated repression was dependent on displacement of an adjacent overlapping transcriptional activator, HNF-3. In cells lacking HNF-3, p53 mediates activation rather than repression of the AFP promoter (35Lee K.C. Crowe A.J. Barton M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1279-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In another case, the MDR1 gene, p53-mediated repression was dependent on binding to a novel p53-binding motif in which the two copies of the p53-binding site are arranged in head-to-tail orientation. Replacement of the head-to-tail site with a head-to-head site converted the activity of p53 from repression to activation (37Johnson R.A. Ince T.A. Scotto K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27716-27720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This finding provided the initial demonstration that inherent features in the p53-response element can confer differential functional responses. More recently, a novel 21-bp DNA element, called the p53 transcriptional repressor element (p53TRE), was identified in the promoter of the placental transforming growth factor β gene (38Tan M. Wang Y. Guan K. Sun Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). This sequence (GYYDCCCAGGCTGGARTGSWR, where R is purine, Y is pyrimidine, W is adenine or thymine, S is guanine or cytosine, and D is guanine, adenine, or thymine) diverges from the consensus p53 sequence and represses p53 transactivation in a position- and promoter-independent fashion. We recently identified the BdkrB2 gene, which encodes the bradykinin B2 receptor (B2R), as a direct transcriptional target for p53 (39Saifudeen Z. Du H. Dipp S. El-Dahr S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15557-15562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). B2R is a G protein-coupled receptor that is involved in the regulation of cardiovascular and renal functions as well as inflammation. The rat BdkrB2 promoter contains two functional p53-binding sites: a P1 site located at nucleotide positions –70; and P2, located at –707 bp, relative to the transcription start site. The P1 and P2 sequences bear 80% or greater homology to the p53 consensus sequence and bind to recombinant p53 with high affinity (22Saifudeen Z. Dipp S. El-Dahr S.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1021-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 39Saifudeen Z. Du H. Dipp S. El-Dahr S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15557-15562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Initial promoter function analysis suggested that p53 activates the BdkrB2 promoter via the P1 site and that P2 down-modulates P1 function (39Saifudeen Z. Du H. Dipp S. El-Dahr S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15557-15562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, the potential mechanisms of such effects were not addressed. By manipulating the sequence and context (location and spacing) of the P1 and P2 sites, we investigated in this study whether p53-mediated promoter activation and repression are dictated by the sequence of the p53-response element and/or its context. In addition, we have examined some of the potential mechanisms of P2-mediated repression within the context of the BdkrB2 promoter. The results indicate that the functions of P1 and P2 elements as activator and repressor, respectively, are dependent on their intrinsic DNA sequence. Moreover, the function of P2 as a repressor is dependent on its presence within its native promoter context. p53-mediated repression of BdkrB2 via P2 is unaffected by histone acetyltransferases, histone deacetylases, and mutation of the minimal repression C-terminal domain of p53 but may involve competitive displacement of transcriptional activators. Cell Culture and Transfections—HeLa cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Cells were plated in duplicates in 6-well plates at 4 × 105 cells/well in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum 1 day prior to transfection. Cells were co-transfected with 1.5 μg of reporter DNA with or without the p53-expression vector, pCMV-p53. A control β-galactosidase vector pSVZ (Promega, 0.5 μg of DNA/well) was cotransfected to correct for transfection efficiency. Transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE Plus Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Four hours after transfection, fresh medium was replaced and cell extracts were prepared 48 h later using a reporter lysis reagent (Promega). CAT activity was measured by thin layer chromatography as described after normalization for protein concentrations or β-galactosidase activity (39Saifudeen Z. Du H. Dipp S. El-Dahr S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15557-15562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Promoter Constructs—The original promoter-reporter construct pB-dkrB2 –1184/+55-CAT and its derivative lacking the P2 site, –1184/CAT-Δ P2, were described (39Saifudeen Z. Du H. Dipp S. El-Dahr S.S.

Utilizing the above two plasmids as templates, a series of point mutations, deletion, substitution, swap, and insertion constructs were engineered using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The promoter constructs and mutagenesis primers are depicted in Table I. The mutant clone p53(M340P,F341D) was obtained by the same method. The –358P2/P1 construct was generated by inserting P2 at nt position –358 in the ΔP2/P1 construct. All clones were subjected to DNA sequencing. Transfections were performed in duplicate and performed at least three times. In experiments utilizing Trichostatin A (TSA, Sigma Chemicals), TSA was added concentrations of 100 μm for 18 h or 100 ng/ml for 2 h.Table IBdkrB2 promoter reporter constructs and sequence of mutagenesis primers Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Bacterially produced recombinant p53 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or tissue nuclear extracts were used as described (22Saifudeen Z. Dipp S. El-Dahr S.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1021-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotides (Operon Biotechnologies) were 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]dATP with T4 kinase for use as probes in EMSA. The labeled probe was incubated for 20 min at room temperature with nuclear extracts and the binding buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm spermidine, 1.0 μg of poly(dI-dC). Specific competitor oligonucleotides were added in 50- to 200-fold molar excess 15 min before addition of the radioactive probe. For supershift experiments, antibodies to p53 (phospho-ser20p53 and phospho-ser15p53, Cell Signaling; lys382 acetyl p53, Upstate Biotechnologies) were added 30 min before addition of radioactive probe.

The BdkrB2-P1 Site Is a Positive p53 Response Element—In a previous study, we established that the rat BdkrB2 promoter has two p53-binding sequences located at nucleotide positions –70 (P1) and –707 (P2), respectively, relative to the transcription start site (39Saifudeen Z. Du H. Dipp S. El-Dahr S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15557-15562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Transient transfection assays performed in HeLa cells revealed that expression of wild-type p53 dose dependently stimulates BdkrB2 promoter-driven transcription of the CAT reporter (Fig. 1B). Deletion analysis has previously localized a positive p53-response element in the DNA fragment extending from –38 to –94 bp, which encompasses the P1 site at position –70 (39Saifudeen Z. Du H. Dipp S. El-Dahr S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15557-15562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To demonstrate conclusively that the P1 site mediates p53-induced transactivation of the BdkrB2 gene, we compared the effect of exogenous p53 on the wild type BdkrB2-CAT reporter plasmid (–1184 to +55 bp, designated P2/P1) with that of a –1184/+55 BdkrB2-CAT plasmid lacking the P1 site (designated P2/ΔP1). The results showed that elimination of P1 completely abrogates p53-mediated activation (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, elimination of P1 abolishes p53-mediated activation of the –635/+55-CAT promoter construct, which lacks the repressor P2 element (Fig. 1C). We have previously shown that a DNA-binding mutant p53 cannot activate BdkrB2 transcription (39Saifudeen Z. Du H. Dipp S. El-Dahr S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15557-15562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Based on these results, we conclude that p53 mediates direct activation of the BdkrB2 promoter via the P1 p53-binding site. To further define the role of P1, we inserted one copy of the P1 sequence upstream of the TATA box in the TATA-Luciferase reporter construct (P1/TATA-Luc). As shown in Fig. 1D, p53 causes a powerful dose-dependent activation of the heterologous promoter construct. This activation is not observed in cells transfected with pCMV-empty vector alone. In addition, as shown below, P1 is capable of transactivation when substituted for P2, although the magnitude of P1-mediated activation is higher when P1 is located closer to the basal promoter region (compare P2/P1 with P1/ΔP1 in Fig. 2B). These results confirm and extend the notion that P1 is a bona fide positive p53-response element. The P2 Element Mediates Sequence- and Context-dependent Repression—To determine the role of P2, we generated several mutant versions of the original P2/P1 construct, which include single or double deletions (ΔP2/P1, P2/ΔP1, and ΔP2/ΔP1), a swap (P1/P2), a swap with deletion (ΔP2/P2 and P1/ΔP1), and insertion with substitution (P2/P2). Deletion of the P2 site (ΔP2/P1) doubles P1-mediated activation (Fig. 2, A and B). Although the P1/ΔP1 construct is responsive to p53, the P1/P2 construct is not, confirming that P2 strongly represses P1-mediated activation. However, because P2/P1 is more responsive to p53 than P1/P2, we conclude that the location of the two elements is an important determinant of P1 and P2 function. Relocation of P2 from its natural position at nt –707 to nt –358 did not affect p53-mediated responses (compare P2/P1 and –358P2/P1, Fig. 2B), suggesting that P2-mediated repression is independent of the distance (spacing) between the P1 and P2 sites. Also, the constructs in which P1 was substituted by P2 (ΔP2/P2 and P2/P2) are highly repressed by p53 as compared with ΔP2/P1 and P2/P1 (Fig. 2, A and B). Based on these findings, we conclude that the presence of P2 dictates transcriptional repression in response to p53 in the BdkrB2 promoter. Interestingly, the double deletion construct (ΔP2/ΔP1) is responsive to p53-mediated activation (about 40% of P2/P1 activity) (Fig. 2B). Because 5′-end truncation of ΔP2/ΔP1 from –1184 to –827 (by NcoI digestion) eliminates p53-mediated activation (Fig. 2B), we conclude that an additional positive p53-responsive element resides in the region between nt –1184 and –827. The function of this upstream element becomes apparent in the absence of P2 repressor activity. To determine if p53-mediated repression via P2 is an intrinsic property of the P2 DNA sequence, we first replaced the P2 sequence in the P2/P1 and P2/ΔP1 plasmids with a consensus p53 sequence (p53-CS) (AGGCATGTCTAGGCATGTCT) to yield the plasmids CS/P1 and CS/ΔP1. Fig. 3A shows that replacement of P2 with p53-CS converts p53-induced repression to activation. The transcriptional activation by CS and P1 tended to be additive, because deletion of P1 reduces the magnitude of p53-mediated activation (p = 0.06). In addition to P2 deletion or replacement, we evaluated the effects of P2 mutagenesis (double or triple mutations) on p53-mediated repression. Unexpectedly, a mutant P2 oligoduplex probe exhibited a higher binding activity to recombinant p53 than the wild-type P2 (Fig. 3B). To determine whether P2 interactions with p53 can be demonstrated in a more physiological setting, we incubated wild-type and triple-mutant P2 with nuclear extracts derived from newborn rat kidneys (Fig. 3C). As demonstrated here and previously (39Saifudeen Z. Du H. Dipp S. El-Dahr S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15557-15562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 40Saifudeen Z. Marks J. Du H. El-Dahr S.S. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2002; 283: F727-F733Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), the newborn rat kidney contains higher amounts of p53 than the adult kidney (Fig. 3D). Similar to the EMSA results using recombinant p53, the binding of the mutant P2 probe to nuclear extracts was higher than that of the wild-type probe (Fig. 3C). The presence of p53 in the nuclear extracts is demonstrated by the supershift induced by the p53 antibodies (Fig. 3C). Transient transfection assays showed that the double and triple mutant P2 constructs are much more responsive to p53 than the wild-type P2/P1 construct (Fig. 3E). Collectively, P2 deletion, replacement, and mutagenesis provide firm evidence that P2-mediated repression is sequence-specific. To examine whether P2 function as a repressor can be maintained outside the context of the BdkrB2 promoter, we inserted three tandem P2 sites upstream of the 13 p53-binding sites in the PG13-Luc construct. Transient transfection in HeLa cells revealed that the P2(x3)-PG13-Luc construct had a higher basal activity than PG13-Luc, and p53 activated both constructs equally well (data not shown). Moreover, insertion of a single P2 site upstream of a TATA-Luc minimal promoter resulted in a strong dose-dependent p53-mediated activation rather than repression (Fig. 4). Therefore, the role of P2 as a repressor is promoter-dependent. A summary of the results of P2 and P1 mutagenesis is presented in Table II.Table IISummary of p53-mediated transcriptional activity of various BdkrB2 promoter-reporter constructs (relative to –1184/+55-CAT construct lacking both P2 and P1)Table IISummary of p53-mediated transcriptional activity of various BdkrB2 promoter-reporter constructs (relative to –1184/+55-CAT construct lacking both P2 and P1) Mutagenesis of the Minimal Repression Domain (p53MRD) of p53 Does Not Affect P2-mediated Repression—The C-terminal segment of p53 contains an 8-amino acid region termed p53MRD (amino acids 339–346). Deletion of the p53MRD or mutagenesis of amino acids 340 and 341 abolishes p53-mediated repression of the thymidine kinase-CAT promoter (41Hong T.M. Chen J.J. Peck K. Yang P.C. Wu C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1510-1515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We therefore wished to determine what role, if any, the p53MRD plays in P2-mediated repression. To this end, we compared the effects of pCMV-p53 (wild-type) or pCMV-p53 (M340P/F341D) on the transcriptional activity of P2/P1, ΔP2/P1, P2/P2, and P2/ΔP1. Because wild-type p53 is known to repress viral promoters (5Shivakumar C.V. Brown D.R. Deb S. Deb S.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6785-6793Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), we first tested the effect of p53MRD mutagenesis on pSV-lacZ promoter activity. As expected, wild-type p53 inhibited the expression of β-galactosidase in a dose-dependent manner; in contrast, p53 mutant MRD had no significant effect (Fig. 5A). In addition, mutations of the p53 MRD did not affect p53-mediated repression of the P2/P1, ΔP2/P1, or P2/P2 constructs (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, the mutant p53M340/F341D retained its ability to activate transcription albeit at a lower efficiency than the wild-type p53 (Fig. 5B). Role of Histone Acetylase and Deacetylase—Recruitment of HDACs to the promoter by p53 has been shown to mediate p53 repression of certain promoters and could account for P2-mediated repression (33Murphy M. Ahn J. Walker K.K. Hoffman W.H. Evans R.M. Levine A.J. George D.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2490-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Also, HDACs may theoretically deacetylate p53. To test these possibilities, we first treated HeLa cells with trichostatin A (TSA), a selective HDAC inhibitor, at doses shown previously to reverse p53-mediated transcriptional repression. We then performed transient transfection assays with the p53 and the promoter-reporter constructs. As shown in Fig. 6A, treatment with TSA has no appreciable effect on P2-mediate"
https://openalex.org/W2088564934,"Kinase of embryonic stem cells (Kos1), a nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinase (NRPTK), was identified and cloned from differentiating murine embryonic stem cells. Kos1 is localized on mouse chromosome 11 that corresponds to human chromosome 17p13.1 and is homologous to Tnk1, Ack1 and Ack2, making it a new member of the Ack family of NRPTKs. Kos1 is a ubiquitously expressed 47-kDa protein with autotyrosine kinase activity that is developmentally regulated during embryogenesis. Kos1 is also upregulated following IL3 withdrawal from factor-dependent murine NSF/N1.H7 cells that undergo apoptosis, suggesting a role in growth inhibition. Stable overexpression of Kos1 inhibits growth of NIH 3T3 cells, while the kinase-dead Kos1(CN) promotes cell growth in both liquid culture and soft agar. In addition, forced expression of Kos1 inhibits Ras activity in an indirect mechanism that results in the downregulation of the Ras–Raf1–MAPK growth pathway. Furthermore, overexpression of Kos1 in NCI-H82 lung cancer cells that express oncogenic Ha-Ras(G12V) inhibits cell growth under reduced serum (0.5%) conditions in close association with the upregulation of the Ras inhibitor, Rap1A. Collectively, these data support a negative regulatory role for Kos1 in regulating the Ras–Raf1–MAPK growth pathway by a mechanism that requires its autotyrosine kinase activity."

Initiation of translation from viral mRNA is unaffected, because it is not cap-dependent but initiates internally from an internal ribosomal entry site (8Belsham G.J. Sonenberg N. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 499-511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Ehrenfeld E. Teterina N.L. Semler B.L. Wimmer E. Molecular Biology of Picornaviruses. ASM Press, Washington D. C.2002: 159-169Google Scholar). In enteroviruses and HRVs, a cysteine proteinase termed 2Apro is responsible for the cleavage of eIF4G isoforms. Viruses possessing certain specific mutations in 2Apro have a small plaque phenotype, as exemplified by PV (10Bernstein H.D. Sonenberg N. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 11: 2913-2923Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar) or SVDV (11Kanno T. Mackay D. Wilsden G. Kitching P. Virus Res. 2001; 80: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 12Sakoda Y. Ross-Smith N. Inoue T. Belsham G.J. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 10643-10650Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In addition, such SVDV mutations show an attenuated phenotype (11Kanno T. Mackay D. Wilsden G. Kitching P. Virus Res. 2001; 80: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 12Sakoda Y. Ross-Smith N. Inoue T. Belsham G.J. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 10643-10650Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A similar attenuated phenotype is also observed in FMDV when the proteinase responsible for eIF4G cleavage, the Leader proteinase, is deleted (13Brown C.C. Piccone M.E. Mason P.W. McKenna T.S. Grubman M.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5638-5641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the eIF4G cleavage reaction is an important determination of virulence in many picornaviruses. The mechanism of cleavage of eIF4G isoforms by the picornaviral proteinases has not been completely resolved. Evidence for direct cleavage by both the 2Apro and the Lpro has been presented (14Liebig H.-D. Ziegler E. Yan R. Hartmuth K. Klump H. Kowalski H. Blaas D. Sommergruber W. Frasel L. Lamphear B.

Hohenadl C. Blaas D. Rhoads R.E. Skern T. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5677-5684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, activities in the PV-infected cell, distinct from the 2Apro, have been described that are able to perform cleavage of eIF4G isoforms (3Zamora M. Marissen W.W. Lloyd R.E. Semler B.L. Wimmer E. Molecular Biology of Picornaviruses. ASM Press, Washington D. C.2002: 313-320Google Scholar). A further unresolved observation is that the cleavage of eIF4GI and eIF4GII occurs concomitantly in HeLa cells infected either with HRV serotypes 2 or 16 (16Seipelt J. Liebig H.D. Sommergruber W. Gerner C. Kuechler E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20084-20089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 17Gradi A. Svitkin Y.V. Sommergruber W. Imataka H. Morino S. Skern T. Sonenberg N. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 5026-5029Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In contrast, in cells infected with PV or HRV14, cleavage of eIF4GI temporally precedes that of eIF4GII (6Svitkin Y.V. Gradi A. Imataka H. Morino S. Sonenberg N. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3467-3472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Gradi A. Svitkin Y.V. Imataka H. Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11089-11094Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Interestingly, HRV2 and HRV16 are members of the genetic A group of HRVs, whereas HRV14 belongs to the B group (19King A.M.Q. Brown F. Christian P. Hovi T. Hyypiä T. Knowles N.J. Lemon S.M. Minor P.D. Palmenberg A.C. Skern T. Stanway G. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Fauquet C.M. Bishop D.H.L. Calisher C.H. Carsten E.B. Estes M.K.

Academic Press, New York1999: 657-683Google Scholar). Further experiments will be required to show whether this difference in cleavage of the eIF4G isoforms extends to other representatives of the two genetic groups. Recently, we have shown that the Leader proteinase of FMDV, a cysteine proteinase with a papain-like fold, can bind directly to the isoforms of eIF4G (20Foeger N. Glaser W. Skern T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44300-44309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar); the region recognized on eIF4GI was mapped to amino acids 640–669 (numbering according to Byrd et al. (21Byrd M.P. Zamora M. Lloyd R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4499-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar)) but did not include the amino acids at which cleavage occurs (Gly674 ↓ Arg). The eIF4G binding domain of the Lpro was shown to comprise the 18 amino acids of the C-terminal extension as well as the residue Cys133, which is adjacent to the CTE in the tertiary structure (22Guarné A. Tormo J. Kirchweger K. Pfistermueller D. Fita I. Skern T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7469-7479Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). A similar interaction between the 2Apro of HRV2 and eIF4G isoforms was also observed (20Foeger N. Glaser W. Skern T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44300-44309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, the binding domain on the HRV2 2Apro, which is a cysteine proteinase with a chymotrypsin-like fold (23Bazan J.F. Fletterick R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7872-7876Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 24Petersen J.F. Cherney M.M. Liebig H.D. Skern T. Kuechler E. James M.N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5463-5475Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), was not identified. Furthermore, although the site of interaction on eIF4GI was shown to lie N-terminal to the HRV2 2Apro cleavage site (Arg681 ↓ Gly), it was not defined further (20Foeger N. Glaser W. Skern T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44300-44309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Here, we use site-directed mutagenesis to identify certain residues between amino acids 17 and 35 of HRV2 2Apro as being responsible for the binding of eIF4GI. The site recognized on eIF4GI was defined as being within amino acids 600–674. Reagents—pHRV2 VP1–2Apro contains the HRV2 nucleotides 2318–3586, encoding all of VP1 except the first two amino acids, followed by all of 2Apro and two stop codons (25Glaser W. Triendl A. Skern T. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 5021-5025Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Mutations in 2Apro were generated by standard PCR mutagenesis and introduced as EcoRI/XhoI fragments into the plasmid pGEX5X (Amersham Biosciences) as required (20Foeger N. Glaser W. Skern T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44300-44309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Fragments of eIF4GI for in vitro translation were amplified from plasmid pSKHC1 (26Yan R.Q. Rychlik W. Etchison D. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23226-23231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which contains the entire eIF4GI cDNA, and cloned as EcoRI/HincII fragments into pBluescriptKS (Stratagene). Rabbit polyclonal antiserum #7, raised against the N terminus (kindly provided by R. Rhoads) of eIF4GI, was diluted 1:8000. Secondary goat alkaline phosphatase-conjugated and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were diluted 1:5000 (Sigma) and 1:10000 (Bio-Rad), respectively. Purification of GST Fusion Proteins—Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)LysS (Novagen) cells were transformed with plasmids encoding the GST-2Apro fusion proteins or GST alone. For expression, overnight cultures were diluted 1:10 in 250 ml of medium, and the cells were incubated at 37 °Ctoan A 600 of 0.8 and induced for 3 h at 18 °C by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.3 mm (20Foeger N. Glaser W. Skern T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44300-44309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The fusion protein was purified on glutathione-agarose resin (Amersham Biosciences) using standard techniques. GST Pull-down Assays—Glutathione-Sepharose beads coated with GST fusion proteins were incubated in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl) with either an aliquot (8 μl) of RRL (Promega) or with radiolabeled in vitro translated proteins for 2 h at 4 °C. After three washes with binding buffer, bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by Western blotting (using enhanced chemiluminescence system of Pierce for detection) or fluorography (20Foeger N. Glaser W. Skern T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44300-44309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In Vitro Translation—In vitro translations in RRLs to examine 2Apro self-processing and eIF4GI cleavage were performed using in vitro transcribed RNAs as described (25Glaser W. Triendl A. Skern T. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 5021-5025Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 27Glaser W. Skern T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 480: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In vitro expression of radiolabeled proteins for GST pull-down assays was performed in RRLs (Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation system; Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine (20 μCi per reaction, Hartmann Analytic) (20Foeger N. Glaser W. Skern T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44300-44309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Labeled proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and gels were dried and exposed to x-ray films. Mutations in HRV2 2Apro Specifically Affecting eIF4GI Cleavage but Not Self-processing—A literature search revealed three mutations in picornaviral 2Apro reported to delay or inhibit eIF4GI cleavage without affecting self-processing (Table I). The poliovirus mutants were identified in an analysis of PV 2Apro by site-directed mutagenesis, whereas the SVDV mutant was determined by the study of virulent and attenuated SVDV strains.Table IMutations affecting elF4GI processing by plcornaviral 2AproVirus (Ref.)MutationSelf-processingelF4GI cleavageEquivalent residue in HRV2PV (28Yu S.F.

Virol. 2001; 75: 10643-10650Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar)R20I++++/-L17 Open table in a new tab In PV 2Apro, Asp38 is the third member of the catalytic triad, orienting the catalytic histidine (23Bazan J.F. Fletterick R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7872-7876Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 28Yu S.F. Lloyd R.E. Virology. 1991; 182: 615-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The phenotype of the PV 2Apro D38E mutant (normal self-processing but an inability to process eIF4GI; Table I) implied, however, that this residue had a role in recognizing eIF4GI in addition to its function in the catalytic triad. To investigate whether a similar phenotype could be observed in HRV2 2Apro, we examined self-processing and eIF4GI cleavage activities of a mutant protein bearing the equivalent mutation D35E. For this, we used our previously described assay for measuring HRV2 2Apro self-processing and eIF4GI cleavage in RRLs (25Glaser W. Triendl A. Skern T. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 5021-5025Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 27Glaser W. Skern T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 480: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In this system, an in vitro transcribed mRNA encoding the HRV2 capsid protein VP1 and the subsequent 2Apro was used to program protein synthesis. As can be seen in Fig. 1A, self-processing can be monitored by examining the status of the newly synthesized radiolabeled protein. The cleavage of eIF4GI, which is abundant in RRLs and migrates as a series of bands with a relative molecular mass of about 220kDa, is investigated by immunoblotting aliquots of the same samples with an antiserum against the N terminus of eIF4GI (Fig. 1B). When an mRNA encoding the wild-type 2Apro enzyme is translated, 50% of self-processing is observed 20 min after initiation of protein synthesis (Fig. 1A, left panel). Similarly, 50% eIF4GI cleavage is also seen after 20 min (Fig. 1B, left panel). To investigate the behavior of the D35E HRV2 2Apro mutant protein, mRNA was transcribed from an appropriately mutated plasmid and used to program RRLs. As can be seen in Fig. 1A (middle panel), self-processing occurred at wild-type rates. However, processing of eIF4GI was severely delayed in this mutant; a significant degree of cleavage was first observed after 180 min of incubation (Fig. 1B, middle panel). Thus, the replacement of Asp35 by glutamate in the HRV2 2Apro produces a similar phenotype as the equivalent residue in PV 2Apro. Using a bacterial expression system, Sommergruber et al. (29Sommergruber W. Seipelt J. Fessl F. Skern T. Liebig H.D. Casari G. Virology. 1997; 234: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) also investigated the behavior of the HRV2 2AproD35E mutant but found only 16% self-processing activity. Because these experiments required induction at 42 °C for 2 h in bacteria, we believe that our assay system in the RRL gives a more authentic picture of the behavior of the D35E mutant. Yu and Lloyd (28Yu S.F. Lloyd R.E. Virology. 1991; 182: 615-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) identified a second mutation in PV 2Apro, Y89L (Table I), which severely affected eIF4GI cleavage without affecting self-processing. The introduction of the equivalent Y86L mutation into HRV2 2Apro did not essentially affect self-processing (Fig. 1A, right panel). The onset of eIF4GI cleavage was, however, delayed (Fig. 1B, right panel), but cleavage was essentially complete after 90 min. Thus, information derived from one picornaviral proteinase cannot always be directly applied to the corresponding proteinase in another picornavirus. This notion was further strengthened when a residue in HRV2 2Apro was replaced with one identified as being important in SVDV 2Apro for cleavage of eIF4GI. In this enzyme, the presence of isoleucine at residue 20 is severely detrimental to eIF4GI cleavage (Table I). Replacement of the equivalent residue in HRV2 2Apro, Leu17, with isoleucine did not affect either self-processing or eIF4GI cleavage in any detectable way in HRV2 2Apro (Fig. 2, left panel). However, the presence of Arg at this position (the virulent wild-type residue in SVDV 2Apro) dramatically inhibited eIF4GI cleavage without affecting self-processing (Fig. 2, right panel). This result is completely the opposite of that observed in SVDV; here the 2Apro from the virulent strain had arginine at the equivalent position, whereas the avirulent strain, in which eIF4GI processing was hampered, possessed Ile (Table I) (11Kanno T. Mackay D. Wilsden G. Kitching P. Virus Res. 2001; 80: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 12Sakoda Y. Ross-Smith N. Inoue T. Belsham G.J. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 10643-10650Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the recognition of eIF4GI by 2Apro may be different between HRV2 and SVDV. HRV2 2Apro Mutant Proteins D35E and L17R Fail to Bind eIF4GI—The ability of the above mutants to perform self-processing at similar levels to the wild-type indicated that the catalytic property of the enzyme had not been reduced by the various mutations. We therefore investigated whether the mutants were defective in their ability to bind eIF4GI, because we have recently shown that a GST-HRV2 2AproC106A fusion protein can bind to the eIF4G isoforms (20Foeger N. Glaser W. Skern T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44300-44309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The mutation C106A inactivates the enzyme by replacing the active site cysteine by alanine, preventing any possible cleavage of eIF4GI during the experiment. We constructed GST-HRV2 2AproC106A fusion proteins bearing the respective mutations and expressed them in E. coli (Fig. 3A). The mutant proteins were bound to glutathione-coupled Sepharose and incubated with RRLs as a source of eIF4GI. After washing, proteins bound to the respective HRV2 2AproC106A fusion proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblotting. eIF4GI is retained by HRV2 2AproC106A and HRV2 2AproC106A-Y86L (Fig. 3B, lanes 2 and 4). In contrast, no binding was observed with the mutant proteins HRV2 2AproC106A-D35E and -L17R (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 5), suggesting that the reduction in their cleavage of eIF4GI was due to an impairment of binding. The Activity of the HRV2 2AproL17R Mutant Protein Can Be Partially Rescued by a Second Site Mutation—To identify further residues involved in the HRV2 2Apro·eIF4GI interaction, we concentrated on residues interacting with Leu17, which were identified using the three-dimensional structure of HRV2 2Apro. Although the mutation D35E was detrimental to eIF4GI cleavage, we were concerned that substitution of its neighbors, with which it forms an extensive hydrogen-bond network, would be detrimental to catalysis in general (see Fig. 5 in Ref. 24Petersen J.F. Cherney M.M. Liebig H.D. Skern T. Kuechler E. James M.N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5463-5475Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These residues were therefore not investigated further. The structure of HRV2 2Apro is shown in Fig. 4. HRV2 2Apro has a chymotrypsin-related fold comprising a unique four-stranded β sheet as the N-terminal domain and a six-stranded β barrel as the C-terminal domain (24Petersen J.F. Cherney M.M. Liebig H.D. Skern T. Kuechler E. James M.N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5463-5475Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The asymmetric unit contained two HRV2 2Apro molecules (designated A and B). Detailed analysis of the structure revealed that Leu17 (positioned in the N-terminal domain) interacts closely with Val30 and Tyr32 in both molecules in the crystal structure (Fig. 4 and Table II; the equivalent residues in SVDV 2Apro are indicated). In contrast, two other residues, Asn21 and Met24, are positioned about 4 Å from Leu17 in molecule A, but are much more distant in molecule B (Table II). It is worth noting that the loop containing residues 17–30 shows the greatest conformational difference between the two molecules (24Petersen J.F. Cherney M.M. Liebig H.D. Skern T. Kuechler E. James M.N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5463-5475Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We selected Val30 and Tyr32 for further investigation because of their consistent proximity. Of the two, Val30 appeared of greater importance because it was closer and also faces Leu17 in both molecules. In addition, in the SVDV 2Apro of the virulent strains, the equivalent residues to Leu17 and Val30 are Arg20 and Glu33; thus, in this SVDV strain, Arg20 and Glu33 could form a salt bridge, providing that they are oriented in a similar fashion. This positive salt bridge would be lost in the avirulent strain when isoleucine replaces Arg20. Interestingly, the equivalent residues at these positions in several coxsackieviruses (24Petersen J.F. Cherney M.M. Liebig H.D. Skern T. Kuechler E. James M.N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5463-5475Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) are also arginine and glutamate, strengthening the idea of an important ionic interaction.Table IIDistance (Å) of residues neighbouring Leu17 in HRV2 2AproHRV2 2AproEquivalent residue in SVDV 2Apro, Arg20Leu17 (CδI)Molecule AMolecule BÅÅMet24 (Sδ)4, 118, 31Trp27Val30 (Cγl)4, 063, 63Glu33Tyr32 (CϵI)4, 894, 93Tyr35Asn21 (Cβ)4, 0310, 06Thr24 Open table in a new tab To test this hypothesis, we attempted to generate this salt bridge in HRV2 2Apro. We introduced the mutation V30E into HRV2 2AproL17R and measured the ability of this double mutant to cleave eIF4GI compared with HRV2 2AproL17R. As a further control, we also investigated the activity of the single mutant HRV2 2Apro V30E. Fig. 5 (left panel) shows that self-processing by the mutant protein HRV2 2AproL17R-V30E occurred at wild-type rates; furthermore, the processing of eIF4GI by this double mutant was significantly more efficient than that of the original HRV2 2AproL17R mutant protein. With HRV2 2AproL17R-V30E, 50% cleavage of eIF4GI was observed after 90 min (Fig. 5B, left panel) compared with more than 180 min with the single L17R mutant protein (Fig. 2B, right panel) and 20 min with the wild-type HRV2 2Apro (Fig. 1B, left panel). This suggests that the interaction of Leu17 and Val30 is important in eIF4GI cleavage by HRV2 2Apro. The positive effect of the presence of glutamate at the residue 30 in the HRV2 2Apro L17R supported the idea of an interaction between residues 17 and 30. This would imply that the single mutant HRV2 2AproV30E would also be handicapped in eIF4GI cleavage. However, examination of the mutant HRV2 2Apro V30E revealed only a minimal effect on self-processing and eIF4GI cleavage (Fig. 5, right panel). This result argues against the importance of interaction between Leu17 and Val30 and stresses, rather, that the occupancy at residue 17 is more critical. To investigate whether the introduction of the mutation V30E had also restored the ability of the L17R mutant protein to bind to eIF4GI, we expressed the fusion protein GST-HRV2 2AproC106A-L17R-V30E. Fig. 5D (lane 3) shows that the binding of the HRV2 2AproC106A-L17R-V30E to eIF4GI is improved compared with that of the L17R single mutant (Fig. 3B, lane 5). Nevertheless, wild type binding was not restored. We also investigated the role of a third residue interacting with Leu17, methionine 24 (Table II). The equivalent residue in SVDV 2Apro is Trp27 and may be in a position to cover and thus stabilize the putative salt-bridge between Arg20 and Glu33. Accordingly, the triple mutant HRV2 2AproL17R-V30E-M24W was constructed; however, it showed no increase in activity on eIF4GI when compared with the double mutant (data not shown). Alanine Scanning Reveals the Involvement of Residues Tyr32, Ser33, and Ser34 in eIF4GI Recognition—To investigate the importance of other residues bordering on strand eI2 (Fig. 4) in eIF4GI binding, we carried out alanine scanning analysis of amino acids lying close to Leu17. This method allows the removal of side-chain interactions without inducing extreme perturbations into the overall fold of the molecule. Two sets of three amino acids, Phe20-Asn21-Ser22 and Tyr32-Ser33-Ser34 were chosen for replacement with alanine. These groups of amino acids were selected as they are conserved in 2Apro of other group A human rhinoviruses (24Petersen J.F. Cherney M.M. Liebig H.D. Skern T. Kuechler E. James M.N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5463-5475Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Tyr32 was of interest because of its proximity to Leu17 (Fig. 4 and Table II). Following construction of the respective plasmids, RNAs were prepared in vitro and used to program RRLs. Self-processing of HRV2 2Apro was essentially unaffected by the substitution of alanine residues at either of the two positions (Fig. 6A). In contrast, an effect on eIF4GI cleavage was observed with both mutant proteins (Fig. 6B). With the Phe20-Asn21-Ser22 alanine-scanning mutant, 50% cleavage of eIF4GI was obtained at 90 min; cleavage was complete at 180 min (Fig. 6B, left panel). The Tyr32-Ser33-Ser34 alanine-scanning mutant was, however, more seriously handicapped in eIF4GI cleavage, with 50% cleavage not occurring during the time frame observed (Fig. 6B, right panel). Examination of the eIF4GI binding by the corresponding GST fusion proteins (Fig. 6D) once again revealed that the significant delay in eIF4GI cleavage correlated with the binding of eIF4GI. Thus, the Phe20-Asn21-Ser22 HRV2 2Apro alanine-scanning mutant was still able to bind eIF4GI (Fig. 6D, lane 3), whereas almost no binding was observed with the Tyr32-Ser33-Ser34 (Fig. 6D, lane 4) alanine-scanning mutant. Thus, this experiment further defines the loop region Tyr32-Ser33-Ser34 as part of the HRV2 2Apro binding domain, while pointing to only a minor role for Phe20-Asn21-Ser22. Definition of the Amino Acids Recognized on eIF4GI by HRV2 2Apro—We showed previously (20Foeger N. Glaser W. Skern T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44300-44309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) that HRV2 2Apro binds to the N-terminal cleavage fragment of eIF4GI generated by the Lpro (residues 1–674). Furthermore, HRV2 2Apro also bound a fragment of eIF4GI comprising amino acids 220–674 but did not bind one comprising amino acids 220–669. The N-terminal boundary was, however, not defined. We therefore prepared suitable eIF4GI fragments (Fig. 7A), expressed the encoded proteins in RRLs using a coupled transcription/translation system, and investigated whether the GST-HRV2 2AproC106A fusion protein could recognize them in a binding assay. Bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the gels were subjected to fluorography. As a control, Fig. 7B shows the binding of the GST-2AproC106A fusion protein to the in vitro translated eIF4GI fragment spanning amino acids 260–674. In addition, the eIF4GI fragment 600–739 was also recognized (Fig. 7C); the fragment was extended relative to the 260–674 fragment to make it more easily detectable on PAGE. Extension of the deletion analysis was complicated by the presence of the binding site for eIF4E (eIF4GI amino acids 609–623 (30Marcotrigiano J. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Burley S.K. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 707-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar)). The presence of eIF4E greatly accelerates the cleavage of eIF4G isomers by HRV2 2Apro (31Haghighat A. Svitkin Y. Novoa I. Kuechler E. Skern T. Sonenberg N. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8444-8450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that its presence may also be required for HRV2 2Apro binding. Thus, the fragment comprising eIF4GI amino acids 640–820 was only poorly bound, if at all (Fig. 7D). Although the interpretation of this last experiment is complicated by some binding to the GST protein alone (Fig. 7D, lane 2), it suggests that the presence of eIF4E bound to eIF4G significantly increases the binding by HRV2 2Apro and that the eIF4E binding site defines the N-terminal boundary of the HRV2 2Apro binding domain. The interaction of human entero- and rhinoviral 2Apro with the eIF4G isoforms has, despite a great deal of research, remained controversial. Mutations that affect this reaction result in a reduction of virulence in these viruses; thus, a thorough understanding of the mechanism of this interaction is of fundamental importance. The above experiments define the regions of the HRV2 2Apro and eIF4GI required for their interaction. In HRV2 2Apro, this domain involves some of the residues 17–35, which form a loop-strand-loop structure at the edge of the N-terminal domain (Fig. 4 (24Petersen J.F. Cherney M.M. Liebig H.D. Skern T. Kuechler E. James M.N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5463-5475Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar)). Of these residues, Leu17, Asp35, and together Tyr32, Ser33, and Ser34 were shown to be crucial for binding eIF4GI. The role of Asp35 is especially noteworthy, because this residue forms part of the active site. Because none of the mutations examined here, not even the D35E mutation, had a significant effect on self-processing, this indicates that the interaction with eIF4GI is much more sensitive to perturbation. Comparison of the eIF4GI binding site on HRV2 2Apro with that on the FMDV Lpro, which we determined earlier (20Foeger N. Glaser W. Skern T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44300-44309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), reveals no similarity in the binding sites. In the FMDV Lpro, the eIF4GI binding domain does not involve the residues from the catalytic triad. Instead, it is located more than 25 Å away from the active site and comprises part of the flexible CTE. Thus, the enzymes have evolved different structural domains to recognize the same cellular target. Given the different structure of the binding domains, it is not surprising that the two enzymes bind to somewhat different fragments of eIF4GI (600–674 for HRV2 2Apro and 640–669 for FMDV Lpro). Nevertheless, two similarities can be found. First, binding by both enzymes is enhanced by the presence of the eIF4E binding site on eIF4GI, with the HRV2 2Apro enzyme being more sensitive to the presence of eIF4E. It seems likely that the enzymes bind to the conformation generated when eIF4E binds to eIF4GI (32Hershey P.E. McWhirter S.M. Gross J.D. Wagner G. Alber T. Sachs A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21297-21304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Second, the C-terminal boundaries of the binding sites are separated by at least five amino acids, a similar number to the seven found between the cleavage sites of the two proteinases on eIF4GI. Is the HRV2 2Apro binding domain for eIF4GI likely to be present in 2Apro encoded by other human rhino- or enteroviruses? Analysis of amino acid sequences shows that the equivalent residues to HRV2 2Apro 17–35 are highly conserved in A group human rhinoviruses. As mentioned in the results, the residues 20–22 and 32–34 were chosen for alanine scanning analysis partly for this reason (24Petersen J.F. Cherney M.M. Liebig H.D. Skern T. Kuechler E. James M.N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5463-5475Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, little conservation between residues 17–35 of the HRV2 2Apro and HRV14 2Apro (the only representative of the B group human rhinoviruses sequenced to date) and between the HRV2 2Apro and those of enteroviruses is evident. Furthermore, little identity between the 2Apro of enteroviruses themselves is found in this region. Indeed, it was not possible to replace residues Leu17 and Val30 of HRV2 2Apro with those (arginine and glutamate) found in SVDV and most coxsackieviruses (Fig. 5, HRV2 2AproL17R-V30E). This illustrates the complexity of this part of the picornaviral 2Apro and indicates that the binding abilities of other rhino- and enterovirus 2Apro will have to be determined experimentally. Possibly, differences in binding behavior may explain why the eIF4G isoforms are cleaved simultaneously in cells infected by HRV2 and HRV16 and at different times during infection by HRV14 and poliovirus (6Svitkin Y.V. Gradi A. Imataka H. Morino S. Sonenberg N. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3467-3472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Seipelt J. Liebig H.D. Sommergruber W. Gerner C. Kuechler E. J. Biol.

A. 1998; 95: 11089-11094Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Residues 19–29 of HRV2 2Apro forming the loop between the catalytic His18 and strand eI2 (Fig. 4), previously attracted attention during the structure determination (24Petersen J.F. Cherney M.M. Liebig H.D. Skern T. Kuechler E. James M.N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5463-5475Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Indeed, this loop is found in two almost unrelated conformations in the two molecules in the asymmetric unit of the HRV2 2Apro crystal. A further indication of the singularity of the loop region 19–29 can be seen on comparison with the Streptomyces griseus B proteinase and the 3Cpro of PV (24Petersen J.F. Cherney M.M. Liebig H.D. Skern T. Kuechler E. James M.N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5463-5475Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 33Skern T. Hampoelz B. Bergmann E. Guarné A. Petersen J. Fita I. James M.N.G. Semler B.L. Wimmer E. Molecular Biology of Picornaviruses. ASM Press, Washington D. C.2002: 199-212Google Scholar). These proteinases both possess a minimal chymotrypsin-like fold and are structurally the closest relatives of 2Apro. Despite their minimal fold, however, they both possess two β-strands (dI and eI1) between the catalytic histidine and β-strand eI2. Strands dI and eI1 are lacking in HRV2 2Apro. Furthermore, the comparisons show that the β-strand eI2 of HRV2 2Apro is substantially truncated compared with that in S. griseus B proteinase and PV 3Cpro. Thus, in these two enzymes, an equivalent structure to that adopted by residues 19–29 of HRV2 2Apro is not possible. Furthermore, the superimposition of the residues 31–34, which in HRV2 2Apro comprise strand eI2, with the equivalent residues of the S. griseus and PV enzymes is very poor. The ability of the HRV2 2Apro to recognize a substrate using a domain outside the active site is, however, not unique among chymotrypsin-like enzymes. At least two members of this family, thrombin and factor VII, can interact with substrates or inhibitors at sites away from the classic substrate binding site (34Banner D.W. Nature. 2000; 404: 449-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Indeed, thrombin has two exosites, which mediate intermolecular interactions. Both are positively charged; exosite I recognizes fibrinogen, exosite II recognizes heparin (35Bode W. Mayr I. Baumann U. Huber R. Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3467-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 36Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Interestingly, small two-domain protein inhibitors of thrombin have been shown to occupy both the active site and exosite I (e.g. hirudin (37Rydel T.J. Ravichandran K.G. Tulinsky A. Bode W. Huber R. Roitsch C. Fenton 2nd, J.W. Science. 1990; 249: 277-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar)) or the active site and exosite II (e.g. hemadin (38Richardson J.L. Kroger B. Hoeffken W. Sadler J.E. Pereira P. Huber R. Bode W. Fuentes-Prior P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5650-5660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). These examples suggest that potent specific inhibitors of HRV2 2Apro might be designed that bind both to the active site and the eIF4GI binding exosite. In summary, the N-terminal domain of HRV2 2Apro lacks 4 β-strands found in almost all other proteinases bearing a chymotrypsin fold. Nevertheless, we show here that the N-terminal domain has evolved to perform a vital interaction in the function of the enzyme and to make a significant contribution to determining virulence."
https://openalex.org/W2083629160,"Neoplastic transformation sensitizes many cells to apoptosis. This phenomenon may underlie the therapeutic benefit of many anticancer drugs, but its molecular basis is poorly understood. We have used a selective and potent farnesyltransferase inhibitor (FTI) to probe a mechanism of apoptosis that is peculiarly linked to neoplastic transformation. While nontoxic to untransformed mouse cells, FTI triggers a massive RhoB-dependent, p53-independent apoptosis in mouse cells that are neoplastically transformed. Here we offer evidence that the BAR adapter-encoding tumor suppressor gene Bin1 is required for this transformation-selective death program. Targeted deletion of Bin1 in primary mouse embyro fibroblasts (MEFs) transformed by E1A+Ras did not affect FTI-induced reversion, actin fiber formation, or growth inhibition, but it abolished FTI-induced apoptosis. The previously defined requirement for RhoB in these effects suggests that Bin1 adapter proteins act downstream or in parallel to RhoB in cell death signaling. The death defect in Bin1 null cells was significant insofar as it abolished FTI efficacy in tumor xenograft assays. p53 deletion did not phenocopy the effects of Bin1 deletion. However, MEFs transformed by SV40 large T antigen+Ras were also resistant to apoptosis by FTI, consistent with other evidence that large T inhibits Bin1-dependent cell death by a p53-independent mechanism. Taken together, the results define a function for Bin1 in apoptosis that is conditional on transformation stress. This study advances understanding of the functions of BAR adapter proteins, which are poorly understood, by revealing genetic interactions with an Rho small GTPase that functions in stress signaling. The frequent losses of Bin1 expression that occur in human breast and prostate cancers may promote tumor progression and limit susceptibility to FTI or other therapeutic agents that exploit the heightened sensitivity of neoplastic cells to apoptosis."

The coupling reactions occur within the protein by long distance conformational changes. In intact transhydrogenase and in complexes formed from the isolated, nucleotide-binding components, thio-NADP(H) is a good analogue for NADP(H), but thio-NAD(H) is a poor analogue for NAD(H). Crystal structures of the nucleotide-binding components show that the twists of the 3-carbothiamide groups of thio-NADP+ and of thio-NAD+ (relative to the planes of the pyridine rings), which are defined by the dihedral, X am, are altered relative to the twists of the 3-carboxamide groups of the physiological nucleotides. The finding that thio-NADP+ is a good substrate despite an increased X am value shows that approach of the NADH prior to hydride transfer is not obstructed by the S atom in the analogue. That thio-NAD(H) is a poor substrate appears to be the result of failure in the conformational change that establishes the ground state for hydride transfer.

Transhydrogenase is found in the inner membrane of animal mitochondria and in the cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria. The enzyme provides NADPH for biosynthesis and for reduction of glutathione, and in some mammalian tissues, it probably participates in the regulation of flux through the tricarboxylic acid cycle (1Rydstrom J. Hoek J.B. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 2Sazanov L.A. Jackson J.B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Under most physiological conditions transhydrogenase is driven in the “forward” direction by the proton electrochemical gradient (Δp) generated by respiratory (or photosynthetic) electron transport. NADH+NADP++Hout↔NAD++NADPH+Hin+(Eq. 1) There is general agreement that coupling between the redox reaction and proton translocation is mediated by changes in protein conformation, although the character of these conformational changes is not known (reviewed in Refs. 3Jackson J.B.

Coupling mechanisms that involve large conformational changes operating over considerable distances are emerging as a common feature in proteins that translocate solutes/ions across membranes, and the amenable properties of transhydrogenase make it an attractive model in the search for fundamental principles. The enzyme has three components. The dI component, which binds NAD+ and NADH, and the dIII component, which binds NADP+ and NADPH, are extrinsic proteins protruding from the membrane (on the matrix side in mitochondria and on the cytoplasmic side in bacteria), and dII spans the membrane. The enzyme is essentially a “dimer” of two dI-dII-dIII “monomers,” although the polypeptide composition is variable among species. Crystal structures of Rhodospirillum rubrum dI (6Buckley P.A.

Studies on the transient state kinetics of transhydrogenation reveal that the redox reaction between the two nucleotides is direct (14Venning J.D. Grimley R.L. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P.J. Jackson J.B.

Thus, the nicotinamide and dihydronicotinamide groups are brought into apposition to allow transfer of a hydride ion equivalent between the C-4 positions of the rings. The reaction is stereo-specific for the pro-R (A-side) of NAD(H) and the pro-S (B-side) of NADP(H) (16Lee C.P. Simard-Duquesne N. Ernster L. Hoberman H.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 105: 397-409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Fisher R.R. Guillory R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4687-4693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent interpretations of kinetic and structural work on transhydrogenase have focused on the importance of conformational changes in the nucleotides as well as in the protein (3Jackson J.B. White S.A. Quirk P.G. Venning J.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4173-4185Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It may be possible to test these interpretations through experiments using nucleotide analogues. Thio-NAD(H) and thio-NADP(H), which have a 3-carbothiamide substituent in place of the 3-carboxamide of the pyridine/dihydropyridine ring, have been used extensively in the study of soluble “dehydrogenases” (18Woenchhaus C. Jeck R. Dolphin D. Poulson R. Avramovic O. in Pyridine Nucleotide Coenzymes. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987: 449-568Google Scholar). The binding properties of the analogues can be different relative to those of the physiological nucleotides and the catalytic rate can be affected; both increases and decreases have been observed in different enzymes (19Cook P.F. Bertagnolli B.L. Dolphin D. Poulson R. Avramovic O. Pyridine Nucleotide Coenzymes. John Wiley & Sons, New York1987: 405-448Google Scholar). An x-ray structure of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) 1The abbreviations used are: DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; thio-NADP+, 3-carbothiamide derivative of NADP+; AcPdAD+, 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; thio-NADP+, 3-carbothiamide derivative of NADP+; AcPdAD+, 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. with bound thio-NADP+ showed how small distortions of the nucleotide conformation can lead to pronounced effects on catalysis (20McTigue M.A. Davies J.F. Kaufman B.T. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6855-6862Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Because the absorbance band of its reduced form is redshifted relative to that of the physiological substrate (and therefore has minimal spectral overlap with NADH), thio-NADP+ has often been used to monitor the activity of proton-translocating transhydrogenase (21Rydstrom J. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 261-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), but few experiments have been carried out using thio-nicotinamide analogues with a view to elucidating mechanistic details of the enzyme. In this report we compare hydride transfer rates to thio-NAD+ and to thio-NADP+ with those to NAD+ and NADP+, respectively, in both the intact R. rubrum transhydrogenase and in dI2dIII1 complexes. It emerges that thio-NAD+ is a poor substrate in the dI site, but thio-NADP+ is a good substrate in the dIII site. To attempt to explain these differences, we have solved the crystal structures of human dIII in its thio-NADP+ form (for comparison with dIII.NADP+; Protein Data Base 1DJL) and of the R. rubrum dI2dIII1 complex loaded with thio-NAD+ and NADP+ (for comparison with complex loaded with NAD+ and NADP+; Protein Data Base 1HZZ). The increased van der Waals' radius of the S atom in the carbothiamide group (1.9 Å compared with 1.4 Å of the O atom) and the increased length of the C = S bond (1.65 Å compared with 1.25 for C = O) have only quite subtle effects on the conformation of the bound nucleotides and the arrangement of the side chains of invariant amino acids at the binding site. We explain the results in terms of the structural changes at the catalytic center that are required to bring together the nicotinamide and dihydronicotinamide rings during hydride transfer, and we discuss the conclusions in the context of the suggestion that these structural changes are associated with proton translocation. Recombinant dI and dIII (wild type and the E155W mutant) from R. rubrum transhydrogenase and human heart dIII were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by column chromatography as described in Refs. 22Diggle C.

After supplementing with 25% glycerol, they were stored at –20 °C. Thawed proteins were either used directly in experiments or were first concentrated in Vivaspin centrifugal filters (5-kDa cut-off for dIII and 10-kDa cut-off for dI). Protein concentrations (given with respect to subunits) were determined by the microtannin procedure (26Mejbaum-Katzenellenb S. Drobryszycka W.J. Clin. Chem.

The dihedral angle X am describes the twist of the carboxamide (or carbothiamide) group relative to the plane of the pyridine ring of a nicotinamide nucleotide. It is defined by viewing atoms C-2–C-3–C-7–O-7 (or S7) along C-3 → C-7; it is 0° when O-7 (or S7) is perfectly cis to C-2, positive for a clockwise rotation of the carboxamide (carbothiamide) from this value and negative for an anticlockwise rotation. Xn is the dihedral that describes the twist of the nicotinamide ring relative to the ribose ring across the glycosidic bond; it is defined by the atoms O-4–C-1–N-1–C-2 and is 0° when O-4 is cis to C-2. When Xn is between 0 and 180°, the rings are said to be in a syn conformation, and when Xn is between 0 and –180° they are anti. The dihedral angles were calculated using TURBO-FRODO. All of the nucleotides and nucleotide analogues were obtained from Sigma. Thio-NAD + Is a Poor Substrate in the Reverse and Cyclic Reactions Catalyzed by R. rubrum Transhydrogenase—The steady state rates of NADPH oxidation by NAD+, by thio-NAD+, and by AcPdAD+ (all “reverse” transhydrogenation reactions) in R. rubrum strain RTB2 membranes at saturating nucleotide concentrations, using the assay buffer described in the legend of Fig. 1, were 8.5, 4.5, and 16.0 mol mol–1 bacteriochlorophyll min–1, respectively. However, the rates of these reactions do not closely reflect events at the hydride transfer step because reverse transhydrogenation is at least partly limited by slow NADP+ release (40Bizouarn T. Stilwell S.N. Venning J.M. Cotton N.P.J. Jackson J.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1322: 19-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). “Cyclic” transhydrogenation (Scheme 1) more reliably indicates the rate of hydride transfer because it can proceed without NADP+ (or NADPH) leaving the enzyme (41Hutton M.N. Day J.M. Bizouarn T. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 1041-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows that the maximum rate of cyclic reduction of thio-NAD+ by NADH plus NADPH (Scheme 1A) was only 5.5 mol mol–1 bacteriochlorophyll min–1, whereas the maximum rate of cyclic AcPdAD+ reduction by NADH plus NADPH (Scheme 1B) under equivalent conditions was 130 mol mol–1 bacteriochlorophyll min–1. The left-hand arms of these two cyclic reactions (that is, the reduction of bound NADP+ by NADH in Scheme 1, A and B) are identical. Therefore, the oxidation of bound NADPH by AcPdAD+ in intact transhydrogenase is much faster than that by thio-NAD+ (the right-hand arms). Despite the large difference in rate, the Km for thio-NAD+ is only about 2.5 times greater than that for AcPdAD+ in the respective reactions. We were unable to detect any oxidation of thio-NADH by NADP+ (a forward transhydrogenation) in R. rubrum membranes under either darkened or illuminated conditions.Scheme 1The cyclic reaction of transhydrogenase. E represents an enzyme catalytic site at the interface between dI and dIII. The dIII nucleotide-binding site is shown to be permanently occupied by either NADP+/NADPH (A and B) or thio-NADP+/thio-NADPH (C). The two double-headed arrows in each panel show consecutive events at the catalytic site. For example, in A, at the left arrows, NADH binds (to dI) and reduces the (dIII-bound) NADP+, and NAD+ then dissociates; at the right arrows, thio-NAD+ binds (to dI) and oxidizes the (dIII-bound) NADPH, and thio-NADH then dissociates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Mixtures of isolated, purified dI and dIII of R. rubrum transhydrogenase spontaneously form stable dI2dIII1 complexes (11Cotton N.P.J.

The steady state rates of oxidation of NADPH by NAD+, by thio-NAD+, and by AcPdAD+ catalyzed by dI2dIII1 complexes were all very similar (∼2 mol mol–1 dIII min–1) but, even more than in the intact enzyme, these reverse transhydrogenations are limited by the very low rate of product NADP+ release (23Diggle C. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P.J. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Cyclic reduction of thio-NAD+ by NADH plus NADPH catalyzed by dI2dIII1 complexes (140 mol mol–1 dIII min–1; Scheme 1A) was considerably slower than cyclic reduction of AcPdAD+ by NADH plus NADPH (typically 2000–3000 mol mol–1 dIII min–1 (12van Boxel G.I. Quirk P. Cotton N.J.P. White S.A. Jackson J.B. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1217-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 23Diggle C. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P.J. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar); Scheme 1B). Following the same arguments as above, this indicates that, as in the intact enzyme, thio-NAD+ is a very poor acceptor of hydride equivalents from NADPH. Experiments in the stopped flow spectrophotometer provide complementary information. It was previously shown that mixing NADPH-loaded dI2dIII1 complexes with AcPdAD+ leads to a rapid burst of hydride transfer preceding the steady state reaction (15Venning J.D. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P.J. Quirk P.G. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 202-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar); the burst arises because the binding of AcPdAD+, hydride transfer, and release of AcPdADH are all very fast relative to the rate of NADP+ release. Subsequently, measurements of changes in Trp fluorescence revealed an equivalent rapid burst of reaction between NADPH-loaded dI2dIII1 complexes and NAD+ (42Pinheiro T.J.T. Venning J.D. Jackson J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44757-44761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 43Venning J.D. Peake S.J. Quirk P.G. Jackson J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19490-19497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In the experiment shown in Fig. 2, NADPH-loaded dI2dIII1 complexes were mixed in the stopped flow spectrophotometer with thio-NAD+. A burst of reaction was observed but with a much slower rate than that observed with either NAD+ or AcPdAD+ as hydride acceptors. Approximately similar concentrations of AcPdAD+, NAD+, and thio-NAD+ were required to give the maximum rate constants for the respective reactions (k app was ∼550 s–1 for NADPH → AcPdAD+, ∼600 s–1 for NADPH → NAD+, and ∼8 s–1 for NADPH → thio-NAD+). In a subsequent experiment, dIII loaded with NADPH from one syringe was mixed with dI plus thio-NAD+ (1.0 mm after mixing) from the other. Again the burst kinetics were observed and with a k app = ∼6s–1 (data not shown), proving that the slow rate of reaction is not a result of slow binding of thio-NAD+ to dI. The analysis of the k app values in terms of their microscopic rate constants, for AcPdAD+ and NAD+ as hydride acceptors, was discussed previously (15Venning J.D. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P.J. Quirk P.G. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 202-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The transient state kinetics of forward transhydrogenation on dI2dIII1 complexes with AcPdADH/NADP+ and with NADH/NADP+ were described in earlier works (31Venning J.D. Jackson J.B. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 42Pinheiro T.J.T. Venning J.D. Jackson J.B. J. Biol.

These reactions also take place as a rapid single-turnover burst, here the slow steady state rate resulting from limiting NADPH release. For AcPdADH/NADP+, measured from the 375 nm absorbance change at saturating AcPdADH, k app = ∼90 s–1, and for NADH/NADP+, measured from a Trp fluorescence change under continuous flow conditions at saturating NADH, k app = ∼21000 s–1. When the dI2dIII1 complex loaded with NADP+ was mixed with thio-NADH in the stopped flow spectrophotometer, a single-turnover burst of reaction was observed, but it was considerably slower than with either AcPdADH or NADH as hydride donor (k"

Mu B is an ATP-dependent DNA-binding protein that is required for target capture and target immunity and is an allosteric activator of transpososome function. The recent NMR structure of the C-terminal domain of Mu B (Mu B223–312) revealed that there is a patch of positively charged residues on the solvent-exposed surface. This patch may be responsible for the nonspecific DNA binding activity displayed by the purified Mu B223–312 peptide. We show that mutations of three lysine residues within this patch completely abolish nonspecific DNA binding of the C-terminal peptide (Mu B223–312). To determine how this DNA binding activity affects transposition we mutated these lysine residues in the full-length protein. The full-length protein carrying all three mutations was deficient in both strand transfer and allosteric activation of transpososome function but retained ATPase activity. Peptide binding studies also revealed that this patch of basic residues within the C-terminal domain of Mu B is within a region of the protein that interacts directly with Mu A. Thus, we conclude that this protein segment contributes to both DNA binding and protein-protein contacts with the Mu transposase.

Thus, we conclude that this protein segment contributes to both DNA binding and protein-protein contacts with the Mu transposase. Bacteriophage Mu is a temperate phage that undergoes two forms of transposition during its life cycle. The first form of transposition occurs when Mu DNA integrates into its host genome through a nonreplicative transposition event called conservative integration (1Liebart J.C. Ghelardini P. Paolozzi L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4362-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 2Chaconas G. Kennedy D.L. Evans D.

The second form occurs after integration, when the Mu DNA amplifies itself through a process known as replicative transposition (4Chaconas G. Harshey R.M. Sarvetnick N. Bukhari A.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 150: 341-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The conservative integration reaction has never been reproduced in vitro, but the replicative transposition pathway has been characterized extensively using purified substrate and both host-encoded and phage-encoded proteins (5Chaconas G. Harshey R.M. Craig N.L. Lambowitz A. Gellert M. Craigie R. Mobile DNA II. ASM Press, Washington D. C.2002: 384-402Crossref Google Scholar).Mu replicative transposition can be performed in vitro using a supercoiled mini-Mu substrate, which contains the left end binding region (attL), the right end binding region (attR), and the enhancer element within a donor DNA molecule. The reaction occurs through a series of higher order nucleoprotein complexes called transpososomes. Transpososome formation up to and including strand transfer occurs in the presence of two phage-encoded proteins, Mu A and Mu B, and two host encoded proteins, HU and IHF (Fig. 1). In the presence of the mini-Mu substrate, Mu A, HU, IHF, and an appropriate divalent metal ion, the initial LER complex is formed. The LER complex is a transitory three-site complex that through numerous protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions brings together the left end, the right end, and the enhancer elements (6Watson M.A. Chaconas G. Cell. 1996; 85: 435-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The first stable complex formed is the Type 0 (stable synaptic complex) (7Mizuuchi M. Baker T.A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 9619-9626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The Type 0 complex is characterized by the engagement of the Mu ends by the active site and accumulates in the presence of calcium, which does not support strand cleavage. In the presence of magnesium, the 3′-ends of the Mu DNA are nicked, and the Type 0 complex is quickly converted to Type 1 complex (cleaved donor complex) (9Craigie R. Mizuuchi K.

Cell. 1987; 49: 253-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The addition of Mu B, ATP, and target DNA results in the formation of the Type 2 complex (strand transfer complex) in which the 3′-ends of the Mu DNA are transferred to a target DNA molecule (9Craigie R.

Cell. 1987; 49: 253-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The Type 2 complex is the most stable transpososome and must be destabilized by the host-encoded ClpX ATPase before replication can occur (11Nakai H. Kruklitis R. J. Biol.

In the absence of target DNA, Mu B and ATP stimulate intramolecular strand transfer, whereby the 3′-ends of the Mu DNA are transferred into a new DNA site within the donor molecule (16Maxwell A.

Mu A can be divided into three distinct globular domains (19Nakayama C. Teplow D.B. Harshey R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1809-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5227-5234Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Mu B is also an allosteric activator of the transposase and can stimulate transpososome formation on both mutant donor DNA substrates and with partially functional mutant forms of Mu A (17Baker T.A.

Along with target capture and transpososome formation, Mu B is also responsible for preventing Mu from transposing into itself, a process known as target immunity. During target immunity, Mu A stimulates the release of Mu B bound to DNA through the hydrolysis of ATP (33Adzuma K. Mizuuchi K. Cell. 1988; 53: 257-266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 34Adzuma K. Mizuuchi K. Cell. 1989; 57: 41-47Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 35Adzuma K. Mizuuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6159-6167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The Mu B protein has two globular domains (36Teplow D.B. Nakayama C. Leung P.C. Harshey R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10851-10857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 25-kDa N-terminal domain contains nonspecific DNA binding activity and has an ATPase motif (29Chaconas G. Gloor G. Miller J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2662-2669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Teplow D.B. Nakayama C. Leung P.C. Harshey R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10851-10857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 11-kDa C-terminal domain is also able to bind nonspecifically to DNA (40Hung L.H. Chaconas G. Shaw G.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5625-5634Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of the N-terminal bipartite nucleotide binding motif (Walker A and Walker B boxes) results in the loss of ATPase activity (37Yamauchi M. Baker T.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5509-5518Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, the isolated N-terminal domain by itself is unable to hydrolyze ATP (36Teplow D.B. Nakayama C. Leung P.C. Harshey R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10851-10857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in the N-terminal domain of Mu B have been shown to affect target capture, but these mutants retain their ability to interact with the transpososome complex (37Yamauchi M. Baker T.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5509-5518Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 38Millner A. Chaconas G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). A small truncation of the C-terminal domain of Mu B blocks replicative transposition but not integration, whereas longer truncations affect both replicative and integrative transposition in vivo (39Chaconas G. Giddens E.B. Miller J.L. Gloor G. Cell. 1985; 41: 857-865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).The C-terminal domain of Mu B (Mu B223–312)is a four-helix bundle (Fig. 2) and has a similar fold to that of the N-terminal region of DnaB (see Ref. 40Hung L.H. Chaconas G. Shaw G.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5625-5634Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Examination of the charged residues within the peptide revealed that there is a positively charged patch of amino acids on the surface of the structure. It was proposed that this patch may be involved in the DNA binding activity that has been associated with the C-terminal domain. In this study, we first confirmed that these residues are responsible for binding DNA, and then we investigated how these positively charged residues contribute to the in vitro transposition reaction. We found that by changing three lysine residues in the C-terminal domain of Mu B to alanine residues, we generated a mutant protein that could no longer capture target or interact with the Mu transpososome. Peptide binding experiments further reveal that this region of Mu B can participate directly in Mu A-Mu B protein-protein contacts.Fig. 2Ribbon diagram of the ensemble average structure of Mu B 223–312. The ribbon diagram, generated with the Swiss Pdb Viewer, represents the average of the 20 defined solution structures previously determined from NMR data with the initial 8 residues removed (40Hung L.H. Chaconas G. Shaw G.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5625-5634Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The four helixes have been colored in green, blue, yellow, and purple and labeled as helix 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively. Also shown in red are the three lysine side chains that that were changed to alanine residues.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDNA, Reagents, and Enzymes—The 6.5-kb mini-Mu plasmid pBL08 has been previously described (6Watson M.A. Chaconas G. Cell. 1996; 85: 435-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The 7.2-kb mutant mini-Mu plasmid pMS9A1 has an A to G transition at the Mu left end terminal base pair (32Surette M.G. Chaconas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17306-17313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The target DNA used was the 5.2-kb plasmid pSD7 (32Surette M.G. Chaconas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17306-17313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All plasmids were purified using a cesium chloride gradient and dialyzed extensively.Mutagenesis and Protein Purification—The HU (41Lavoie B.D. Chaconas G. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2510-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and IHF (42Surette M.G. Chaconas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3028-3034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proteins were purified as previously described. Mu A proteins were purified as described previously (43Baker T.A. Mizuuchi M. Savilahti H. Mizuuchi K. Cell. 1993; 74: 723-733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) through the P-11 step. No dithiothreitol was added to the wash step or the elution step of the P-11 column, and the protein was induced in the presence of 1% (w/v) glucose, which improved the induction and purity after the P-11 column.To introduce mutations into Mu B223–312 and the full-length Mu B genes, site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit purchased from Stratagene, with a modified protocol. Two complementary oligonucleotides containing the desired mutation sequence were purchased (Sigma). Two separate 25-μl PCRs were set up (as per standard QuikChange protocol) containing 250 pmol of each mutant primer in separate reactions with 50 ng of wild-type Mu B expression plasmid DNA. Each separate PCR was amplified for three cycles of 95 °C for 50 s, 55 °C for 60 s, and 68 °C for 12 min with 0.5 units of Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase. The two amplification reactions were then combined to create a 50-μl PCR containing both primers and their amplification products from the first three cycles. This new reaction was supplemented with an additional 0.5 units of Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase, and the reaction was run for 18 cycles of 95 °C for 50 s, 55 °C for 50 s, and 68 °C for 12 min, followed by an additional extension for 7 min at 68 °C. The amplification product was digested with DpnI for 90 min at 37 °C and then transformed into electrocompetent DH5α cells. The mutant plasmids were then purified and sequenced.Mutagenesis and purification of the Mu B223–312 gene was performed using the Mu B223–312 gene expression construct, pHH05 from the strain GC1876, described previously (40Hung L.H. Chaconas G. Shaw G.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5625-5634Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). One liter of cells was grown in LB in a 4-liter Fernbach flask in the presence of 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 1% (w/v) glucose at 37 °C, with a rotation of 225 rpm, to an A 595 of 0.65. The flask was then transferred to 18 °C, with a rotation of 225 rpm and incubated for 45 min, and the cells were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 18 h. The cells were harvested by spinning at 8500 × g for 10 min, washed, and resuspended in 10 ml of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, plus 5 mm EDTA. Cells were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with lysozyme (0.3 mg/ml), followed by the addition of 1% Triton X-100 and five 30-s bursts using a Fisher model 300 sonifier at 50-watt power. The lysed cells were then pelleted at 27,200 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was batch-absorbed at 4 °C for 45 min to 500 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B matrix (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, plus 5 mm EDTA. The matrix was then washed three times with 25 ml of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, plus 5 mm EDTA and three times with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, plus 5 mm EDTA and 1 m NaCl. The matrix was transferred into a 1 × 2.5-cm column, washed three times more with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, plus 5 mm EDTA, and eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, plus 5 mm EDTA and 20 mm glutathione. The eluate was digested with 1 unit of thrombin/mg of protein for 45 min at room temperature. The digested protein was then filtered (0.22-μm filter) and loaded (1 ml/min) onto a 1-ml Resource prepacked Mono 15S column (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, using a high pressure liquid chromatograph (Waters). The Mu B223–312 peptide was eluted from the Mono 15S column using a 0–700 mm NaCl (Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) gradient for 40 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Peak fractions were collected and dialyzed against 20 mm phosphate, pH 6.8, plus 1.5 m NaCl.Mutagenesis and purification was performed on the full-length construct using the Mu B gene expression plasmid pML02 (38Millner A. Chaconas G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Mu B was purified as described previously (38Millner A. Chaconas G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), with the following changes: the ethanol pellet was resuspended in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, plus 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MSH, and 7.0 m urea; and the DEAE-Sepharose column was equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, plus 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MSH, and 6.2 m urea and eluted with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, plus 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MSH, and 6.2 m urea. The CM-Sepharose column was equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, plus 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MSH, 6.8 m urea, and 25 mm NaCl, and the protein was loaded and washed with 4 ml of equilibrium buffer before being eluted with 7 ml of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, plus 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MSH, 6.8 m urea, and 100 mm NaCl. The 3K protein was purified as above using SP-Sepharose instead of CM-Sepharose. All of the proteins were greater than 95% pure with the exception of the 3K protein, which was greater than 90% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE.DNA Binding Assays—The Mu B223–312 DNA binding assays were performed using various concentrations of peptide (described in the legends of Figs. 3 and 5) in the presence of 25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, and 15 μg/ml DNA (pSD7). The reactions were incubated at 25 °C for 10 min.Fig. 3Assay of DNA binding activity of Mu B 223–312 mutant peptides. A, schematic of Mu B domain structure. The Mu B protein can be divided into two structural domains by partial proteolysis (36Teplow D.B. Nakayama C. Leung P.C. Harshey R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10851-10857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain contains an AAA+ ATPase motif (54Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and nonspecific DNA binding activity (36Teplow D.B. Nakayama C. Leung P.C. Harshey R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10851-10857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain has a nonspecific DNA binding activity and shares structural similarity to the N-terminal domain of DnaB (40Hung L.H. Chaconas G. Shaw G.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5625-5634Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). B, DNA binding was assayed using gel mobility shifts by incubating 225 ng of supercoiled non-Mu plasmid (pSD7) with various amounts of purified Mu B carrying mutations in the C-terminal domain (Bc). Wild-type and mutant Mu B223–312 peptides were incubated with DNA and run on a 1% agarose gel at 80 V cm–1 for 4 h and stained with ethidium bromide. The position of the supercoiled and relaxed DNA in the absence of protein is labeled at the side of the gel. The mutant peptides assayed are noted above the gel. The 3K mutant protein is a triple alanine substitution at positions Lys233, Lys235, and Lys236. “Bc” indicates that the mutations are carried in the purified C-terminal peptide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 5Assay of DNA binding activity of full-length mutant Mu B proteins. A, the DNA binding affinities for the wild-type and mutant full-length Mu B proteins were determined using affinity co-electrophoresis assays, essentially as described previously (44Lim W.A. Sauer R.T. Lander A.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 196-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, various concentrations of wild-type and mutant proteins were embedded into the lanes of a horizontal slab gel. Then 32P-labeled 70-bp double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide was loaded into a single well spanning the width of the gel and electrophoretically run through the gel in the presence of 0.5 mm ATP. As protein-DNA complexes form during electrophoresis, migration of the radiolabeled DNA is retarded in the gel. B, quantification of affinity co-electrophoresis assay gels for wild-type, K233A, K235A, K236A, and 3K full-length Mu B proteins. DNA binding was determined as the percentage of the DNA retained at the top half of the gel (see “Experimental Procedures”). Data were fitted to the following equations, as described previously (37Yamauchi M. Baker T.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5509-5518Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 44Lim W.A. Sauer R.T. Lander A.D.

Protein was embedded into 1% LMP agarose and 32P-end-labeled 70-bp double-stranded DNA was run through the gel. The final protein concentration in the gel varied between 22.5 nm and 1.44 μm as described throughout. The gels and electrophoresis buffer contained 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 50 mm potassium acetate, and 0.5 mm ATP. Gels were run at 4 °C with circulating buffer at 4.2 V cm–1 for 5 h. The gels were dried and scanned using a PhosphorImager S and quantified using ImageQuant software from Amersham Biosciences. The fraction of DNA bound was taken as the percentage of radioactivity in the top half of each lane.In Vitro Reactions—The Type 2 reactions were performed under standard reaction conditions (1×): 15 μg/ml supercoiled mini-Mu plasmid, 3 μg/ml (44 nm) Mu A protein, 3.5 μg/ml (315 nm) HU, 0.2 μg/ml (18 nm) IHF, 5 μg/ml (140 nm) Mu B, 2 mm ATP, 20 μg/ml target DNA, 25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.6, plus 140 mm NaCl and 10 mm MgCl2. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for various amounts of time as described in the legends of Figs. 4 and 6. The intramolecular strand transfer reactions were performed at 2.5× reaction conditions in the absence of target DNA at Mu B concentrations of 140 and 280 nm as indicated.Fig. 4Kinetics of Type 2 formation using purified full-length mutant Mu B proteins. Strand transfer was assayed at 30 °C under standard reaction conditions. The reactions were run on a 1% agarose gel at 2.75 V cm–1 for 12 h. The supercoiled target (ST), the supercoiled donor (SD), the relaxed target (RT), and the relaxed donor (RD) are indicated to the left of the gel. The positions of the Type 2, the Type 1, and the intramolecular products are shown to the right of the gel. The faint band observed with wild type Mu B, running between the Type 2 complex and the relaxed donor DNA, is an unstable form of the Type 2 complex where the target DNA is still supercoiled.
