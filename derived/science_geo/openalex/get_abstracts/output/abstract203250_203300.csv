https://openalex.org/W2023559475,A FACTOR of likely importance in the genesis of the long-lasting action potentials of vertebrate heart muscle is the influence of membrane potential on the potassium permeability of the fibres. That a difference here exists between cardiac muscle and nerve is evident from Weidmann's1 demonstration of a low slope conductance during the plateau of the action potential. But little information is so far available on the voltage dependence of the membrane conductance under conditions designed to avoid the generation of action potentials.

https://openalex.org/W1646732663,"It is hoped that the general picture presented will provide a convenient framework within which to order many of the phenomena treated in radiobiology. The picture incorporates many of the concepts found useful in earlier theories, and also is simple, concrete, and easily visualized. From the theory, a reasonable estimate may be made of the effect of a given dose of radiatlon on a specific kind of molecule in a cell. Conversely, from the immediate effects produced by a certain dose, some estimate may be made of the mass of intracellular material which must be involved in the processes which are assayed for. It is felt that these advantages will suffice to carry the theory over its many difficulties and deficiencies until another and more encompassing viewpoint can be reached. (P.C.H.)"

https://openalex.org/W1984809006,"When irradiated with gamma rays, Artemia eggs show the typical sigmoidal survival curve of a multicellular organism, with little change at low doses and an abrupt decrease in survival above a threshold dose. On irradiation with 160-Mev oxygen ions, the threshold disappears and viability can be destroyed by passage of a single energetic ion."

https://openalex.org/W2053317024,Operant behavior of rats was maintained at moderate frequencies by a temporally defined shock avoidance schedules. Progressive reductions in one of the temporal parameters of this schedule—the portion during which behavior may have consequences—yield an orderly response rate function which first rises to a maximum and then declines gradually to extinction.

The contribution of Pb(210) to the radioactive dose from natural sources is about one-fifth that from internally deposited Ra(226) and its daughters."
https://openalex.org/W2092205323,"The rate of rise and the amplitude of a mechanically elicited generator potential in a receptor membrane (Pacinian corpuscle) increases markedly with temperature. By contrast, the amplitude of the action potential of the Ranvier node adjacent to the receptor membrane remains practically unchanged over a wide range of temperature. The activation energy of the rate-limiting process in excitation of the receptor membrane is high; it indicates the existence of a high potential energy barrier for charge transfer."

https://openalex.org/W2083257715,"THERE is abundant evidence to support the theory that at least one way in which penicillin exerts its antibacterial effect is to prevent the synthesis, during cell division, of a rigid component of the cell wall. If this action takes place in normal culture medium, the result is lysis ; if in a hypertonic environment, the cell changes into a spherical body or spheroplast1. We have found that the parent amine, 6-aminopenicillanic acid2, from which the natural penicillins may be considered to be derived by acylation, induces morphological changes similar to those produced by benzylpenicillin, 6-(α-phenoxypropionamido)penicillanic acid (‘Broxil’), and phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin V)."

We wish to support this generalization by reporting the presence of fructose in the fœtal blood and fœtal fluids of several further species within the order Ungulata, and the essential absence in a member of the Edentata."

In 1960, 35 percent was due to root absorption, 50 percent to floral absorption from soil, and 15 percent to current fallout."
