https://openalex.org/W2014257811,"In five male subjects, and a total of 15 man-nights, oxygen consumption rate (V(02)) was related to stage of sleep, as defined by electroencephalograms. Gross periodic variations which paralleled change in stage of sleep were discernible in analogue metabolic records. Computations revealed significant differences (P <.01) between all stages with V(02) highest in stage I REM (dreaming sleep), least in stages III and IV (deep sleep), and intermediate in stage II (light sleep)."

https://openalex.org/W2136535154,Infrared spectroscopy and optical rotatory dispersion have been used to test theories of structure of membrane protein. No evidence has been found to support the view that adjacent to the lipid there is a monolayer of protein in the beta-conformation. The extracted protein appears to be a fairly typical globular protein with a low a-helical content.

https://openalex.org/W2060098504,"When asked to judge whether two stimuli (tones) were the ""same"" or ""different,"" subjects took longer to decide that two identical stimuli were the same than to decide that two dissimilar stimuli were different. Thus these judgments are not equivalent obverse aspects of a unitary judgmental process. While decision theory can be extended to deal with the obtained data, a model based on an analogy with a statistical computer is more directly applicable."

https://openalex.org/W1974219413,"Myelin was isolated from cerebral white matter from a patient who had died of metachromatic leukodystrophy, and its lipid composition was analyzed. Although the lipid content was nearly normal, the myelin contained a three- to fourfold excess of cerebroside sulfate and a threefold deficiency of cerebroside compared to normal myelin. The deficiency of cerebroside and the excess of cerebroside sulfate may account for defective myelination in this disease."

https://openalex.org/W1975152647,"IN perfused rat heart and isolated rat diaphragm the rate of release and oxidation of fatty acids from muscle glycerides is increased by alloxan-diabetes1. These changes in diabetes involve actions of growth hormone and corticosteroids in insulin-deficient rats because they are not seen in muscles of hypophysectomized diabetic rats unless the animals are treated with growth hormone and cortisol1. As part of an investigation of the mechanisms of these changes we have investigated the effects of diabetes, hypophysectomy and treatment with growth hormone and cortisol on the concentrations of glycerides and phospholipids in rat heart and gastrocnemius (the latter as a representative skeletal muscle). The methods and procedure were as follows."

https://openalex.org/W2019279324,"IN 1960 some interesting effects of fluorene-9-carboxylic acids on plants were observed at the biological research laboratories of E. Merck AG, Darmstadt, Germany. An intensified research programme on these compounds and on a great many derivatives was initiated by this company, which, during the following years, led to the discovery of a large-numbered group of compounds of substantial interest, some of which show an extremely strong action on the growth and development of plants1. This particular action has novel and somewhat unique features, and was reported first in 1964 by Schneider2."

At intervals of 10 to 30 milliseconds, and again at 80 to 200 milliseconds, the threshold was lowered as compared to that for a single target, while at a separation of 50 to 60 milliseconds, the threshold was raised."

After hemoglobin E, J(Korat) is the second most frequent of the anomalous hemoglobins among Thais."

https://openalex.org/W2043916700,"ONE of the most significant advances in cellular radiobiology was the development by Puck and Marcus1 of a technique by means of which the survival from irradiation of animal cells in culture was placed on a quantitative basis. Survival has usually been expressed arbitrarily as the ability of an irradiated cell to produce, over a 10–20-day period, a macroscopic clone of descendants comprising at least 50 ‘normal’ (that is, non-giant) cells."
