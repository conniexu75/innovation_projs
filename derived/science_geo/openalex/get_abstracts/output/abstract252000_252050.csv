We used functional neuroimaging to examine how perceivers make mental state inferences when such self-other overlap can be assumed (when the other is similar to oneself) and when it cannot (when the other is dissimilar from oneself). We observed a double dissociation such that mentalizing about a similar other engaged a region of ventral mPFC linked to self-referential thought, whereas mentalizing about a dissimilar other engaged a more dorsal subregion of mPFC. The overlap between judgments of self and similar others suggests the plausibility of “simulation” accounts of social cognition, which posit that perceivers can use knowledge about themselves to infer the mental states of others. Human social interaction requires the recognition that other people are governed by the same types of mental states—beliefs, desires, intentions—that guide one's own behavior. We used functional neuroimaging to examine how perceivers make mental state inferences when such self-other overlap can be assumed (when the other is similar to oneself) and when it cannot (when the other is dissimilar from oneself). We observed a double dissociation such that mentalizing about a similar other engaged a region of ventral mPFC linked to self-referential thought, whereas mentalizing about a dissimilar other engaged a more dorsal subregion of mPFC. The overlap between judgments of self and similar others suggests the plausibility of “simulation” accounts of social cognition, which posit that perceivers can use knowledge about themselves to infer the mental states of others. Any attempt at understanding the behavior of another person requires a consideration of the rich set of internal mental states that govern what others do and say. Adopting this kind of “intentional stance” requires the recognition that others are mental agents that act primarily on the basis of what they believe, feel, and desire (Dennett, 1987Dennett D.C. The Intentional Stance. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1987Google Scholar). Moreover, human social cognition includes the added appreciation that others not only experience beliefs, feelings, and desires, but that their mental states are generally comparable to those experienced by oneself, a cognitive ability that appears to distinguish humans from other primates (Tomasello, 1999Tomasello M. The Cultural Origins of Human Cognition. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA1999Google Scholar). This unique awareness that the inner workings of others' minds overlap meaningfully with one's own allows humans to use their own thoughts and feelings as a guide to those of others. Indeed, “simulation” (or “projection”) theories of social cognition have posited that perceivers may infer mental states, in part, by assuming that others experience what they themselves would think or feel in a comparable situation (Adolphs, 2002Adolphs R.

Critically, this strategy of basing inferences about others on knowledge about oneself will be useful only to the extent that one can assume that the other is likely to experience the same mental states as oneself. If a target of mentalizing is substantially different from oneself (e.g., somebody from another culture or ethnic group), using self knowledge to inform such inferences may be relatively less useful. As such, simulationist accounts of social cognition suggest that perceivers will mentalize in a different way when the other is perceived to be similar to versus dissimilar from oneself.

Nevertheless, extant data on the neural basis of social cognition provide some preliminary support for the possibility that mPFC contributions to mentalizing may differ according to the perceived overlap between self and other.

Neurosci. 2005; 17: 1306-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). As yet, little is understood about the specific contributions made by each of these mPFC subregions to social cognition. However, an important clue regarding the functional distinction between these two regions has recently come from studies of self-referential processing, which have consistently observed selective engagement of ventral mPFC during tasks that require reporting one's own internal states. This ventral mPFC region (typically, within a few millimeters of the axial plane of the genu of the corpus callosum) has been linked to a variety of self-referential tasks (Northoff et al., 2006Northoff G.

Akbudak E. Shulman G.L. Raichle M.E. Medial prefrontal cortex and self-referential mental activity: Relation to a default mode of brain function.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 4259-4264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2182) Google Scholar), or adopting a first-person perspective (Vogeley et al., 2004Vogeley K. May M. Ritzl A. Falkai P. Zilles K. Fink G.R. Neural correlates of first-person perspective as one constituent of human self-consciousness.J. Cogn. Neurosci. 2004; 16: 817-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Typically, dorsal mPFC activation has not been modulated during self-referencing tasks. Taken together, the dual observations that ventral mPFC is engaged occasionally during mentalizing and consistently during self-referential processing support the notion that this region may subserve inferences about others' mental states through simulation, that is, when mental state inferences are informed by perceivers' knowledge about their own feelings and thoughts. If so, simulation theories of social cognition suggest that this region should be specifically engaged for mental state inferences about others perceived to be similar to oneself, since mentalizing on the basis of self knowledge can only take place if another person's internal experience is assumed to be comparable to one's own. As such, this hypothesis suggests an important “division of labor” in the contributions made by different subregions of mPFC to mentalizing. Whereas ventral mPFC may be expected to contribute to mental state inferences about similar others, the dorsal aspects of mPFC—more traditionally associated with mentalizing tasks—should be specifically engaged by mentalizing about dissimilar others, that is, individuals for whom overlap between self and other cannot be assumed. To test these predictions, we first had participants read descriptions of two unfamiliar individuals who were described as having opposing liberal or conservative sociopolitical views (see Experimental Procedures section). This manipulation was intended to create one target whose social and political views would be similar to those of the participant and another target whose views would be dissimilar. During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning, participants mentalized about the opinions, likes, and dislikes of each of these two targets and also indicated their own responses on the same set of opinion questions. After scanning, participants completed a version of the Implicit Association Test (IAT) (Greenwald et al., 1998Greenwald A.G. McGhee D.E. Schwartz J.L.K. Measuring individual differences in implicit cognition: The implicit association test.J. Pers. Soc. Psychol. 1998; 74: 1464-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (6489) Google Scholar), designed to index how strongly they automatically associated “self” with the liberal target versus the conservative target. Participants also completed a version of the IAT that measured their automatic evaluation of each target (positive versus negative) and, finally, reported their explicit social and political attitudes on a seven-point scale (1 = extremely liberal; 4 = neither liberal nor conservative; 7 = extremely conservative). Participants were significantly faster to make judgments of self (M = 1863 ms) than judgments of others (M = 1927 ms), t(14) = 2.89, p < 0.02. In addition, participants judged liberal targets more quickly on average than conservative targets (Ms = 1907 and 1947 ms, respectively) t(14) = 2.21, p < 0.05. On the two postscanning self-report measures, participants explicitly reported having relatively liberal social (M = 2.93, SD = 1.71) and political (M = 2.80, SD = 1.42) attitudes. As expected, responses on these two explicit questions were highly correlated, r(14) = 0.93. Consistent with this liberal outlook, results from the postscanning IAT session indicated that participants were, as a group, significantly faster to categorize trials in self-with-liberal blocks (M = 610 ms) than trials in self-with-conservative blocks (M = 669 ms), t(14) = 2.67, p < 0.02, demonstrating that, on average, participants more strongly associated self with the liberal than the conservative target. However, sizeable variability across participants was observed in the response latency difference between the two blocks of the IAT, with some participants showing a stronger association between self and the conservative target (SD = 85.9, range = −65.8 to 244.2 ms). We used this variability to segregate participants into two groups (Figure 1). Specifically, based on a median split of their IAT difference score, participants were assigned either to the “similar to liberal” (n = 8, mean IAT difference = 120.2 ms, SD = 63.8) or “dissimilar from liberal” (n = 7, mean IAT difference = −12.8 ms, SD = 38.6) group. Importantly, this participant group factor did not interact with the reaction time advantage for liberal targets. Participants were equally fast to judge similar targets (i.e., the liberal target for participants in the “similar to liberal” group and the conservative target for participants in the “dissimilar from liberal” group) than to judge dissimilar targets (Ms 1924 and 1929 ms, respectively), t(14) = 0.49, p = 0.63. fMRI data were subjected to a random-effects analysis that included participant group factor (similar to liberal, dissimilar from liberal) in order to identify brain regions that demonstrated a significant interaction of participant group × target (liberal, conservative). This analysis revealed two discrete regions in mPFC. First, a ventral mPFC region (MNI coordinates of peak voxel: 18, 57, 9) was more engaged during judgments of the target with whom participants more strongly associated themselves as measured by the IAT (Figure 2A). That is, participants in the “similar to liberal” group demonstrated greater engagement of ventral mPFC while making mentalizing judgments of the liberal target, whereas participants in the “dissimilar from liberal” group demonstrated greater ventral mPFC engagement while judging the conservative target. Several additional regions—right inferior frontal gyrus, cingulate cortex, and bilateral occipital cortex—were also obtained from this analysis and demonstrated greater activation for similar than dissimilar targets (see Table 1).Table 1Coordinates of Peak Activations and Percent Signal Change for Regions Demonstrating a Significantly Different BOLD Response for Similar and Dissimilar TargetsAnatomical LabelxyzSimilarDissimilarSimilar > dissimilarVentral mPFC185790.18−0.11R inferior frontal gyrus513240.850.39Cingulate cortex−33360.950.45R occipital cortex12−66−60.890.439−90240.770.24L occipital cortex−24−66240.18−0.08Dissimilar > similarDorsal mPFC−945420.570.82Peak activations are reported for each region in the Montreal Neurological Institute stereotaxic space.

For the purposes of reporting percent signal change in each of these regions, the liberal target was considered “similar” and the conservative target was considered “dissimilar” for participants in the “similar-to-liberal” group (and vice versa for participants in the “dissimilar-from-liberal” group). mPFC = medial prefrontal cortex; R = right; L = left. Open table in a new tab Peak activations are reported for each region in the Montreal Neurological Institute stereotaxic space. The two rightmost columns present percent signal change as a function of the perceived similarity of targets. For the purposes of reporting percent signal change in each of these regions, the liberal target was considered “similar” and the conservative target was considered “dissimilar” for participants in the “similar-to-liberal” group (and vice versa for participants in the “dissimilar-from-liberal” group). mPFC = medial prefrontal cortex; R = right; L = left. In contrast, activation in dorsal mPFC (peak voxel: −9, 45, 42) was greater during judgments of the target with whom participants less strongly associated themselves (Figure 2B). That is, participants in the “similar to liberal” group demonstrated greater engagement of dorsal mPFC while making judgments of the conservative target, whereas participants in the “dissimilar from liberal” group demonstrated greater dorsal mPFC engagement while judging the liberal target. This region of dorsal mPFC was the only area that showed greater activation for dissimilar than similar targets. Confirming that these two mPFC regions responded differently as a function of target similarity, we observed a highly significant three-way interaction for region (ventral mPFC, dorsal mPFC) × target (liberal, conservative) × participant group (similar to liberal, dissimilar from liberal), F(1,13) = 26.06, p < 0.0002. These findings were further supported by correlational analyses that capitalized on the full range of variability in participants' IAT results. As displayed in Figure 3A, the activation in ventral mPFC during judgments of the liberal target (relative to the conservative target) was significantly correlated with the extent to which a participant associated self with the liberal target on the postscanning IAT, r(14) = 0.54, p < 0.04. That is, the more a participant associated self with the liberal target (as measured by the IAT), the greater the difference in ventral mPFC activation during judgments of the liberal target relative to judgments of the conservative target. The inverse pattern was observed in dorsal mPFC (Figure 3B), such that the relative activity during judgments of the liberal target was negatively correlated with the extent to which a participant associated self with the liberal other on the IAT, r(14) = −0.72, p < 0.003. That is, the less a participant associated self with the liberal target, the greater the difference in dorsal mPFC activation during judgments of the liberal target (relative to judgments of the conservative target). In other words, whereas the response in ventral mPFC tracked how similar the participants considered themselves to a target, the response in dorsal mPFC tracked with how dissimilar participants considered themselves from a target. Finally, we examined the overlap between self and other through a separate analysis in which judgments of others were reconditionalized on the basis of the distance between response to other and response for self. We reasoned that participants were relatively likely to have used knowledge about their own opinions and predilections when making the same response for a target as for themselves (e.g., judging that a target looked forward to returning home for Thanksgiving as much as they themselves did). Accordingly, judgments of the two targets were segregated into (1) those for which the participant made the same judgment of the other as for self (other-same trials) and (2) those for which the participant made a different judgment for the other than for self (other-different trials). As displayed in Figure 4, activation of ventral mPFC was nearly identical during judgments of self and other-same judgments, [t(14) = 0.29, ns], but both of these trial types engaged ventral mPFC significantly more than other-different judgments (both t values > 3.12, both p values < 0.01). This additional analysis provides further support for the notion that the ventral mPFC may be engaged when using knowledge about oneself to mentalize about others. Although a numerical trend in the opposite direction was observed in dorsal mPFC, the comparable analysis in this region did not yield significant results. These results begin the process of identifying functionally discrete subregions of mPFC, suggesting that distinct dorsal and ventral sections of the medial wall of prefrontal cortex subserve social-cognitive processing as a function of how similar another person is perceived to be to oneself. A ventral region of mPFC—overlapping with earlier studies that have implicated this region in self-referential processing (Gusnard et al., 2001Gusnard D.A. Akbudak E. Shulman G.L. Raichle M.E.

The anterior frontomedian cortex and evaluative judgment: an fMRI study.Neuroimage. 2002; 15: 983-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar)—was more strongly engaged during judgments about the potential mental states of others perceived to be similar to versus dissimilar from oneself. In contrast, a more dorsal region of mPFC—more consistent with the bulk of studies that have identified regions activated by mentalizing tasks—demonstrated the opposite effect of being more strongly engaged during judgments about the potential mental states of others perceived to be dissimilar from oneself. This double dissociation was obtained despite measuring target similarity through an unrelated behavioral measure that was administered postscanning and which simply assessed the relative speed with which participants associated first-person pronouns with photographs of the two target individuals. Moreover, secondary analyses demonstrated that ventral mPFC was similarly engaged for judgments about oneself and judgments of others who were thought to share the same opinion as the participant on a particular question. This functional division has not been evident in the sizeable number of studies that have linked mPFC activity to social cognition, which have generally linked mentalizing to relatively dorsal aspects of mPFC. By and large, however, these studies have asked participants to mentalize about targets that they were unlikely to perceive as similar to self, such as historical figures (Goel et al., 1995Goel V. Grafman J. Sadato N. Hallett M. Modeling other minds.Neuroreport. 1995; 6: 1741-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), cartoon and story characters (Fletcher et al., 1995Fletcher P.C.

As such, these earlier studies may have inadvertently isolated a subregion of mPFC that contributes specifically to mentalizing about relatively dissimilar others. Interestingly, the small number of studies that have reported ventral mPFC engagement during mentalizing tasks have typically included targets that were known to be similar to participants (Kumaran and Maguire, 2005Kumaran D.

We show that inactivation of the vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter (Viaat, VGAT) leads to embryonic lethality, an abdominal defect known as omphalocele, and a cleft palate. Loss of Viaat causes a drastic reduction of neurotransmitter release in both GABAergic and glycinergic neurons, indicating that glycinergic neurons do not express a separate vesicular glycine transporter. This loss of GABAergic and glycinergic synaptic transmission does not impair the development of inhibitory synapses or the expression of KCC2, the K+-Cl− cotransporter known to be essential for the establishment of inhibitory neurotransmission. In the absence of Viaat, GABA-synthesizing enzymes are partially lost from presynaptic terminals. Since GABA and glycine compete for vesicular uptake, these data point to a close association of Viaat with GABA-synthesizing enzymes as a key factor in specifying GABAergic neuronal phenotypes.

Inhibitory neurotransmission in the adult nervous system is chiefly mediated by release of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glycine from synaptic vesicles. GABAergic inhibition predominates in the brain, whereas both glycine and GABA act as the primary inhibitory neurotransmitters in spinal cord and brainstem. To date, only a single transporter for the filling of vesicles at both GABAergic and glycinergic synapses has been identified. It is referred to as either vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) (McIntire et al., 1997McIntire S.L. Reimer R.J. Schuske K. Edwards R.H. Jorgensen E.M. Identification and characterization of the vesicular GABA transporter.Nature. 1997; 389: 870-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar) or vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter (Viaat) (Sagne et al., 1997Sagne C. El Mestikawy S. Isambert M.F. Hamon M. Henry J.P. Giros B. Gasnier B. Cloning of a functional vesicular GABA and glycine transporter by screening of genome databases.FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 177-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In contrast, the glutamatergic, excitatory transmitter system employs three separate vesicular glutamate transporters with distinct expression patterns (Fremeau et al., 2004bFremeau Jr., R.T. Voglmaier S. Seal R.P. Edwards R.H. VGLUTs define subsets of excitatory neurons and suggest novel roles for glutamate.Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 98-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). The designation of Viaat as a GABA/glycine transporter is based on evidence from morphological studies showing the presence of Viaat in both GABAergic and glycinergic synaptic terminals (Chaudhry et al., 1998Chaudhry F.A. Reimer R.J. Bellocchio E.E. Danbolt N.C. Osen K.K. Edwards R.H. Storm-Mathisen J.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9733-9750Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), from biochemical studies on neurotransmitter uptake characteristics of synaptic vesicle preparations (Burger et al., 1991Burger P.M.

Fonnum F. Uptake of glycine, GABA and glutamate by synaptic vesicles isolated from different regions of rat CNS.Neurosci.

Bischofberger J. Sandkuhler J. Corelease of two fast neurotransmitters at a central synapse.Science. 1998; 281: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). However, despite the fact that multiple lines of evidence indicate that Viaat is a vesicular carrier for both GABA and glycine, direct evidence is lacking, and the question as to whether Viaat is the sole vesicular carrier responsible for all GABAergic and glycinergic neurotransmission or whether glycinergic neurons possess an additional glycine transporter has remained unresolved. In fact, the affinity of heterologously expressed Viaat for glycine was shown to be considerably lower than its affinity for GABA (McIntire et al., 1997McIntire S.L. Reimer R.J. Schuske K. Edwards R.H. Jorgensen E.M. Identification and characterization of the vesicular GABA transporter.Nature. 1997; 389: 870-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, Sagne et al., 1997Sagne C.

Cloning of a functional vesicular GABA and glycine transporter by screening of genome databases.FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 177-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). This finding is in line with some studies on the endogenous GABA/glycine uptake system (Bedet et al., 2000Bedet C. Isambert M.F. Henry J.P. Gasnier B. Constitutive phosphorylation of the vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter in rat central nervous system.J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1654-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) but is contradicted by other studies reporting lower but comparable uptake of glycine versus GABA by the endogenous system (Burger et al., 1991Burger P.M. Hell J. Mehl E. Krasel C. Lottspeich F. Jahn R. GABA and glycine in synaptic vesicles: storage and transport characteristics.Neuron. 1991; 7: 287-293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) or effective inhibition of GABA uptake at low concentrations of glycine (Christensen et al., 1991Christensen H. Fykse E.M. Fonnum F. Inhibition of gamma-aminobutyrate and glycine uptake into synaptic vesicles.Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 207: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). GABA and glycine exert their well established roles as inhibitory neurotransmitters in the mature nervous system, where intraneuronal Cl− concentrations are low, and the opening of GABAA receptor (GABAAR) and glycine receptor (GlyR) channels causes Cl− influx and membrane hyperpolarization. In immature neurons, GABA and glycine act instead as depolarizing and even excitatory neurotransmitters (Ben-Ari, 2002Ben-Ari Y. Excitatory actions of GABA during development: the nature of the nurture.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 728-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar), because intraneuronal Cl− concentrations are high and receptor Cl− channel opening is followed by Cl− efflux and membrane depolarization. This depolarization caused by GABAAR and GlyR activation is sufficient to activate voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and even elicit action potentials (Chen et al., 1996Chen G.

Control of postsynaptic Ca2+ influx in developing neocortex by excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters.Neuron. 1991; 6: 333-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). The relatively high intracellular Cl− concentration of immature neurons is due to the developmentally early appearance of inwardly directed Cl− transporters, in particular the Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporter NKCC1 (Clayton et al., 1998Clayton G.H. Owens G.C. Wolff J.S. Smith R.L. Ontogeny of cation-Cl- cotransporter expression in rat neocortex.Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1998; 109: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The shift from the depolarizing to the hyperpolarizing and thereby inhibitory action of GABA and glycine depends on the expression of KCC2, a K+-Cl− cotransporter that is responsible for the Cl− extrusion capacity of mature neurons (Rivera et al., 1999Rivera C. Voipio J. Payne J.A. Ruusuvuori E. Lahtinen H. Lamsa K. Pirvola U. Saarma M. Kaila K. The K+/Cl- co-transporter KCC2 renders GABA hyperpolarizing during neuronal maturation.Nature. 1999; 397: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar). KCC2 transcript levels increase throughout development in parallel with neuronal maturation (Stein et al., 2004Stein V. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Jentsch T.J. Hubner C.A. Expression of the KCl cotransporter KCC2 parallels neuronal maturation and the emergence of low intracellular chloride.J. Comp. Neurol. 2004; 468: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Although significant KCC2 upregulation occurs postnatally, its critical function in the transition to the adult pattern of GABA/glycine hyperpolarizing action is already apparent at birth, when KCC2 deletion mutant mice fail to establish normal breathing patterns and die (Hubner et al., 2001Hubner C.A. Stein V. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Meyer T. Ballanyi K. Jentsch T.J. Disruption of KCC2 reveals an essential role of K-Cl cotransport already in early synaptic inhibition.Neuron. 2001; 30: 515-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). The developmental upregulation of KCC2 expression has been suggested to be an activity-dependent event, produced by the depolarizing action of GABA and glycine in immature neurons (Ganguly et al., 2001Ganguly K. Schinder A.F. Wong S.T. Poo M. GABA itself promotes the developmental switch of neuronal GABAergic responses from excitation to inhibition.Cell. 2001; 105: 521-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar), a finding that was contradicted by later studies (Ludwig et al., 2003Ludwig A. Li H. Saarma M. Kaila K. Rivera C. Developmental up-regulation of KCC2 in the absence of GABAergic and glutamatergic transmission.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 18: 3199-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, Titz et al., 2003Titz S. Hans M. Kelsch W. Lewen A. Swandulla D. Misgeld U. Hyperpolarizing inhibition develops without trophic support by GABA in cultured rat midbrain neurons.J. Physiol. 2003; 550: 719-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Moreover, the maturation of postsynaptic receptor clusters at glycinergic contacts is also thought to be an activity-dependent process controlled by the early depolarizing function of glycine, because postsynaptic GlyR clustering is prevented by pharmacologically blocking either GlyRs themselves or voltage-activated Ca2+ channels (Kirsch and Betz, 1998Kirsch J. Betz H. Glycine-receptor activation is required for receptor clustering in spinal neurons.Nature. 1998; 392: 717-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Based on these and numerous other studies, the role of GABA and glycine release in the establishment of neuronal circuits during development is generally considered a trophic action (Ben-Ari, 2002Ben-Ari Y. Excitatory actions of GABA during development: the nature of the nurture.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 728-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar, Owens and Kriegstein, 2002Owens D.F. Kriegstein A.R. Is there more to GABA than synaptic inhibition?.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). However, in this context it is important to point out that GABA is also thought to act as a trophic substance early in development before synaptic communication is established (Represa and Ben-Ari, 2005Represa A. Ben-Ari Y. Trophic actions of GABA on neuronal development.Trends Neurosci. 2005; 28: 278-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Consequently, the earliest effects of GABA on neuronal development may be due to a diffuse mode of action mediated by nonsynaptic and nonvesicular release (Demarque et al., 2002Demarque M. Represa A. Becq H. Khalilov I. Ben-Ari Y. Aniksztejn L. Paracrine intercellular communication by a Ca2+- and SNARE-independent release of GABA and glutamate prior to synapse formation.Neuron. 2002; 36: 1051-1061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The generation of GABAergic synapses during development precedes the establishment of functional glutamatergic inputs (Chen et al., 1995Chen G. Trombley P.Q. van den Pol A.N. GABA receptors precede glutamate receptors in hypothalamic development; differential regulation by astrocytes.J. Neurophysiol. 1995; 74: 1473-1484PubMed Google Scholar, Walton et al., 1993Walton M.K. Schaffner A.E. Barker J.L. Sodium channels, GABAA receptors, and glutamate receptors develop sequentially on embryonic rat spinal cord cells.J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 2068-2084PubMed Google Scholar), and the initially excitatory action of GABA and glycine during development may therefore be a self-limiting process that establishes early network activity and serves as a mechanism to avoid excitotoxicity (Ben-Ari, 2002Ben-Ari Y. Excitatory actions of GABA during development: the nature of the nurture.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 728-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar). However, the roles of GABA and glycine in neuronal network development may not always be equivalent, because in the brainstem and spinal cord, where both neurotransmitters are used, a developmental transition from GABAAR to GlyR-mediated responses occurs postnatally (Gao et al., 2001Gao B.X. Stricker C. Ziskind-Conhaim L. Transition from GABAergic to glycinergic synaptic transmission in newly formed spinal networks.J. Neurophysiol. 2001; 86: 492-502PubMed Google Scholar). This shift from GABAergic to glycinergic neurotransmission, whose molecular basis still remains to be resolved, does not appear to be caused solely by postsynaptic changes in receptor composition, since in synapses of the auditory brainstem presynaptic changes were shown to occur (Nabekura et al., 2004Nabekura J. Katsurabayashi S. Kakazu Y. Shibata S. Matsubara A. Jinno S. Mizoguchi Y. Sasaki A. Ishibashi H. Developmental switch from GABA to glycine release in single central synaptic terminals.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). To characterize the vesicular transporter systems of inhibitory synapses and their role in central nervous system development, we generated mice deficient for Viaat and characterized their phenotype with respect to the generation and function of GABAergic and glycinergic synapses and the functional maturation of GABAergic and glycinergic synaptic transmission. We generated Viaat knockout mice (KOs) through homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells (Figures 1A–1C). Viaat KO mice die between embryonic day (E)18.5 and birth, exhibit a hunched posture, and at E17.5 (Figure 1D), the age chosen for experimental analysis, and are completely immobile and stiff. Stiffness is most likely a symptom of overexcitation; however, a lack of mobility was also noted at earlier embryonic stages (E15.5–E16.5) and is also consistent with an absence of excitatory drive, which in the developing nervous system is initially provided at least partially by GABA (Ben-Ari, 2002Ben-Ari Y. Excitatory actions of GABA during development: the nature of the nurture.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 728-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar). Homozygous KO animals have a cleft palate (Figure 1E), which was also described for KOs of the 67 kDa isoform, but not the 65 kDa isoform, of the main GABA-synthesizing enzymes glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)67 and GAD65 (Asada et al., 1997Asada H. Kawamura Y. Maruyama K. Kume H. Ding R.G. Kanbara N. Kuzume H. Sanbo M. Yagi T. Obata K. Cleft palate and decreased brain gamma-aminobutyric acid in mice lacking the 67-kDa isoform of glutamic acid decarboxylase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 6496-6499Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, Condie et al., 1997Condie B.G. Bain G. Gottlieb D.I. Capecchi M.R. Cleft palate in mice with a targeted mutation in the gamma-aminobutyric acid-producing enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase 67.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 11451-11455Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Apparently, closure of the palate roof requires vesicular GABA release, which indicates that the cleft palate in Viaat and GAD67 KOs is due to immobility of the tongue, rather than to elimination of a trophic effect of GABA in the palate. In addition, Viaat KOs display an omphalocele, an abdominal defect where the intestine is not withdrawn into the abdominal cavity during embryonic development (Figures 1D and 1E). Interestingly, this defect is also seen in embryos deficient for KCC2 (Hubner et al., 2001Hubner C.A. Stein V. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Meyer T. Ballanyi K. Jentsch T.J. Disruption of KCC2 reveals an essential role of K-Cl cotransport already in early synaptic inhibition.Neuron. 2001; 30: 515-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), the K+-Cl− cotransporter responsible for extrusion of Cl− during neuronal maturation, whose expression determines the developmental shift of GABAergic and glycinergic synaptic input from excitatory to inhibitory (Balakrishnan et al., 2003Balakrishnan V. Becker M. Lohrke S. Nothwang H.G. Guresir E. Friauf E. Expression and function of chloride transporters during development of inhibitory neurotransmission in the auditory brainstem.J.

The K+/Cl- co-transporter KCC2 renders GABA hyperpolarizing during neuronal maturation.Nature. 1999; 397: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar). Because GABA is thought to have trophic effects during neuronal development (Represa and Ben-Ari, 2005Represa A. Ben-Ari Y. Trophic actions of GABA on neuronal development.Trends Neurosci. 2005; 28: 278-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), we examined Nissl-stained serial brain sections and spinal cord sections of E17.5 Viaat KO and wild-type (wt). We found that neither the brain nor the spinal cord of Viaat KOs showed any morphological abnormalities (Figures 1F–1I). These observations are in line with studies on GAD65 and GAD67 double KOs (Ji et al., 1999Ji F. Kanbara N. Obata K. GABA and histogenesis in fetal and neonatal mouse brain lacking both the isoforms of glutamic acid decarboxylase.Neurosci. Res. 1999; 33: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), where no evidence of abnormal brain histogenesis was detectable. While Viaat KO spinal cord sections showed no histological defects, with immunofluorescence staining, a decreased synaptic and increased somatic labeling for GAD67 (Figures 2A and 2B) was readily apparent in the spinal cord of Viaat KO animals. In contrast to this, we found no significant difference in the GAD65 staining between wt and KO spinal cord (Figures 2C and 2D). We next looked for changes in the protein expression levels of general synaptic markers as well as markers that are specific for GABAergic/glycinergic synapses (Figure 3). The only alteration detected in KO animals was a reduction of GAD65 and GAD67 levels in spinal cord, but not whole brain (Figures 2E and 3). To confirm and quantify the reduction of GAD65 and GAD67 levels in spinal cord, total GAD65 and GAD67 protein levels in E17.5 whole brain and spinal cord were measured using detection of fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies with normalization to β-tubulin levels. Total GAD65 and GAD67 protein levels in spinal cord were significantly reduced to 65% and 64% of wt levels, respectively (Figure 2E). However, there was no significant change of GAD protein levels in KO brain.Figure 3Immunoblot Analysis of E17.5 Whole Brain and Spinal CordShow full captionGAD65 and GAD67 levels were reduced in spinal cord, but not in whole-brain extracts of Viaat KO mice.

Note that several commercial Viaat antibodies tested on E17.5 protein extracts gave extremely high background staining. To demonstrate the absence of Viaat protein in Viaat KOs, we therefore performed immunoblots on lysate prepared form cultured neurons allowed to mature in vitro. The most likely interpretation of these findings is that GAD65 and GAD67 are associated with Viaat, either directly or as part of a protein complex, as has been suggested for GAD65 (Jin et al., 2003Jin H. Wu H. Osterhaus G. Wei J. Davis K. Sha D. Floor E. Hsu C.C. Kopke R.D. Wu J.Y. Demonstration of functional coupling between gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) synthesis and vesicular GABA transport into synaptic vesicles.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 4293-4298Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Absence of the transporter leads to a reduction of protein levels of both GAD isoforms and to mislocalization of the remaining cellular GAD67 pool. GAD65, which unlike GAD67 is palmitoylated (Kanaani et al., 2002Kanaani J. el Husseini A. Aguilera-Moreno A. Diacovo J.M. Bredt D.S. Baekkeskov S. A combination of three distinct trafficking signals mediates axonal targeting and presynaptic clustering of GAD65.J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1229-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), appears to be less dependent on Viaat for synaptic targeting. Although GAD67 generally has a more cytosolic distribution than GAD65 (Solimena et al., 1993Solimena M. Aggujaro D. Muntzel C. Dirkx R. Butler M. De Camilli P. Hayday A. Association of GAD-65, but not of GAD-67, with the Golgi complex of transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells mediated by the N-terminal region.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1993; 90: 3073-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), our data imply that the synaptic GAD67 pool is directly associated with Viaat containing synaptic vesicles. The absence of significant differences in GAD65/67 protein levels and GAD67 localization (data not shown) in whole brain may be attributable to the relative developmental lag in synaptogenesis in the E17.5 brain compared to spinal cord. There was no evidence of an impairment of synapse formation in Viaat KO neurons cultured from brain and spinal cord as judged by staining with pre- and postsynaptic markers (GAD65, synapsin, GlyR, gephyrin, GABAARβ, and neuroligin 2; Figure 6 and data not shown). To examine the functional role of Viaat in inhibitory synaptic transmission, we used single-neuron autaptic cultures (Pyott and Rosenmund, 2002Pyott S.J. Rosenmund C. The effects of temperature on vesicular supply and release in autaptic cultures of rat and mouse hippocampal neurons.J. Physiol. 2002; 539: 523-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) from E17.5 Viaat KO embryos and wt or heterozygous littermate controls. We detected no significant differences between cultures from wt and heterozygous animals in these and all subsequent experiments, and therefore pooled the data from both genotypes, designating them as wt in all electrophysiological experiments. All electrophysiological data are from recordings of autaptic cells. We first focused on cultures from striatum, which predominantly contain neurons that release GABA. In general, only nonglutamatergic neurons, identified by the insensitivity of their evoked synaptic responses to the AMPA receptor antagonist NBQX (10 μM), were analyzed in detail. While all NBQX-insensitive wt neurons (n = 97) showed robust inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) that were blocked by the GABAAR antagonist bicuculline (10 μM), the majority (122/210; 58%) of nonglutamatergic Viaat KO neurons showed no detectable evoked response (Figure 4A). The remaining 88 cells showed a drastically reduced response amplitude (0.25 ± 0.04 nA, compared to 7.50 ± 0.47 nA in wt neurons; Figure 4A). To confirm that the residual transmission observed in KO cells was GABAAR mediated, we examined the effects of the GABAAR and glycine receptor (GlyR) antagonists bicuculline and strychnine, respectively (Figure 4B). The complete inhibition of the residual current by bicuculline, almost no inhibition at 1 μM strychnine, and approximately 50% inhibition at 3 μM strychnine are consistent with a purely GABA-mediated IPSC (Jonas et al., 1998Jonas P. Bischofberger J. Sandkuhler J. Corelease of two fast neurotransmitters at a central synapse.Science. 1998; 281: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). In addition, we measured responses to exogenously applied GABA and the glutamate receptor agonist kainate to determine whether postsynaptic receptor sensitivity was affected. No significant differences between wt and Viaat KO neurons were detected (Figure 4C), indicating normal postsynaptic sensitivity to GABA and glutamate. In addition to the experiments in striatal cultures, we also examined excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) and IPSC amplitudes in hippocampal cultures. While evoked EPSC amplitudes as well as spontaneous miniature EPSC (mEPSC) amplitudes, which correspond to the spontaneous release of single vesicles, were indistinguishable in wt and Viaat KO neurons (data not shown), nonglutamatergic neurons derived from Viaat KO mice showed again either no synaptic response (n = 9) or very small and bicuculline-sensitive IPSC responses (n = 4). In contrast, all nonglutamatergic neurons in the wt group displayed robust IPSC amplitudes. These observations are fully consistent with the findings in the striatal cells. To determine whether the residual GABA release in Viaat KO neurons is vesicular, we recorded miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs) from wt and KO cells (Figure 4D). KO cells that were not completely silent showed a drastic reduction in the mIPSC frequency (wt: 4.18 ± 0.29 Hz; KO: 0.12 ± 0.032 Hz), and the amplitude of detectable mIPSCs was reduced to 40% of wt levels (wt: 54.20 ± 2.59 pA; KO: 21.81 ± 1.35 pA). As for all other electrophysiological experiments, the mean mIPSC wt values represent pooled data from wt and heterozygous cultures. Although in 2-week-old heterozygous animals the amount of total brain Viaat protein was reduced to 45% ± 5% of wt levels, comparison of mIPSC amplitudes from cultured heterozygous and wt neurons revealed only a slightly reduced mIPSC amplitude in the heterozygous neurons, and the difference was statistically not significant (data not shown). The percentage of KO cells from which mIPSCs could be recorded was slightly lower than those with detectable evoked responses (31% versus 42%); however, this can be explained by the fact that the smaller KO mIPSCs are more likely to escape detection than a small evoked response. Plotting the median mIPSC amplitude of individual wt and KO cells (Figure 4E) showed a clear separation between the size of KO and wt mIPSCs, indicating that vesicles in KO cells are not filled to wt levels. As the majority of KO neurons were silent, and the mIPSC frequency dramatically reduced in the remainder, the Viaat KO neurons most likely release not only partially filled but mostly empty vesicles, as has been shown to be the case for deletion mutants of other vesicular transporters (Croft et al., 2005Croft B.G.

https://openalex.org/W2041882228,"Post-translational modification by the lipid palmitate is crucial for the correct targeting and function of many proteins. Here we show that huntingtin (htt) is normally palmitoylated at cysteine 214, which is essential for its trafficking and function. The palmitoylation and distribution of htt are regulated by the palmitoyl transferase huntingtin interacting protein 14 (HIP14). Expansion of the polyglutamine tract of htt, which causes Huntington disease, results in reduced interaction between mutant htt and HIP14 and consequently in a marked reduction in palmitoylation. Mutation of the palmitoylation site of htt, making it palmitoylation resistant, accelerates inclusion formation and increases neuronal toxicity. Downregulation of HIP14 in mouse neurons expressing wild-type and mutant htt increases inclusion formation, whereas overexpression of HIP14 substantially reduces inclusions. These results suggest that the expansion of the polyglutamine tract in htt results in decreased palmitoylation, which contributes to the formation of inclusion bodies and enhanced neuronal toxicity."

Molecular diversity in the GABAB system arises from the GABAB1a and GABAB1b subunit isoforms that solely differ in their ectodomains by a pair of sushi repeats that is unique to GABAB1a. Using a combined genetic, physiological, and morphological approach, we now demonstrate that GABAB1 isoforms localize to distinct synaptic sites and convey separate functions in vivo. At hippocampal CA3-to-CA1 synapses, GABAB1a assembles heteroreceptors inhibiting glutamate release, while predominantly GABAB1b mediates postsynaptic inhibition. Electron microscopy reveals a synaptic distribution of GABAB1 isoforms that agrees with the observed functional differences. Transfected CA3 neurons selectively express GABAB1a in distal axons, suggesting that the sushi repeats, a conserved protein interaction motif, specify heteroreceptor localization.

Presynaptic GABAB receptors are subdivided into auto- and heteroreceptors that control the release of GABA and other neurotransmitters, respectively. They restrict neurotransmitter release either by inhibiting voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels or through a direct modulation of synaptic vesicle priming (Mintz and Bean, 1993Mintz I.M. Bean B.P.

Accordingly, mice lacking GABAB1 (referred to as 1−/− mice) or GABAB2 subunits show a complete absence of typical GABAB responses (Gassmann et al., 2004Gassmann M. Shaban H. Vigot R. Sansig G.

The only firmly established molecular diversity in the GABAB system arises from the GABAB1a and GABAB1b subunit isoforms (Kaupmann et al., 1997Kaupmann K. Huggel K. Heid J. Flor P.J. Bischoff S. Mickel S.J. McMaster G. Angst C. Bittiger H. Froestl W. Bettler B.

However, no unique pharmacological or functional properties could be assigned to GABAB1a or GABAB1b. Most, if not all neurons coexpress GABAB1a and GABAB1b, which are generated by differential promoter usage from the GABAB1 gene (Bischoff et al., 1999Bischoff S. Leonhard S. Reymann N. Schuler V.

Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6115-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). GABAB1a and GABAB1b expression levels vary during development and across individual cells, suggestive of a functional specialization. Structurally, the isoforms differ in their N-terminal ectodomain by a pair of sushi repeats that is present in GABAB1a but not in GABAB1b (Blein et al., 2004Blein S. Ginham R. Uhrin D. Smith B.O. Soares D.C. Veltel S. McIlhinney R.A. White J.H. Barlow P.N.

Chem. 2004; 279: 48292-48306Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Sushi repeats, also known as complement control protein modules, or short consensus repeats, are found in other G protein-coupled receptors as well (Grace et al., 2004Grace C.R. Perrin M.H. DiGruccio M.R. Miller C.L. Rivier J.E. Vale W.W. Riek R. NMR structure and peptide hormone binding site of the first extracellular domain of a type B1 G protein-coupled receptor.Proc. Natl. Acad.

Jokiranta T.S. Interdomain contact regions and angles between adjacent short consensus repeat domains.J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 1385-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The presence of sushi repeats in GABAB1a, together with the absence of functional or pharmacological differences in vitro, suggested the existence of auxiliary proteins that modify receptor activity, pharmacology, and localization (Marshall et al., 1999Marshall F.H. Jones K.A. Kaupmann K. Bettler B. GABAB receptors—the first 7TM heterodimers.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 396-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, Mohler and Fritschy, 1999Mohler H. Fritschy J.M. GABAB receptors make it to the top—as dimers.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 87-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), precedence for which is found with other G protein-coupled receptors (McLatchie et al., 1998McLatchie L.M. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Wise A. Brown J. Thompson N. Solari R. Lee M.G. Foord S.M. RAMPs regulate the transport and ligand specificity of the calcitonin-receptor-like receptor.Nature. 1998; 393: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1759) Google Scholar). So far, the lack of selective reagents has not allowed addressing the individual contributions of GABAB1a and GABAB1b to native GABAB functions. In the light of the proposed heterogeneity of native GABAB receptors, it therefore remains a key question whether GABAB1 isoforms exhibit pharmacological and/or functional differences in vivo. Here, we have taken a genetic approach to dissociate the native functions of GABAB1a and GABAB1b. To selectively prevent translation of the GABAB1a and GABAB1b proteins, we converted their initiation codons in the GABAB1 gene into stop codons (Figure 1). Balb/c gene targeting constructs with mutated initiation codons (Figure 1A) were electroporated into Balb/c embryonic stem cells (Dinkel et al., 1999Dinkel A. Aicher W.K. Warnatz K. Burki K. Eibel H. Ledermann B. Efficient generation of transgenic BALB/c mice using BALB/c embryonic stem cells.J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 223: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and homologous recombination events diagnosed with short-arm PCR and Southern blots (data not shown). Targeted embryonic stem cells were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts. Founder mice were crossed with Balb/c mice expressing Cre-recombinase under control of the cytomegalus virus promoter to excise the neomycin cassette. Pups born from these matings were scored for Cre-mediated loss of the neomycin cassette and bred to homozygosity. Consequently, all mutant mice were on a pure inbred Balb/c genetic background, which was maintained throughout the experiments. Homozygous mice with mutations in the GABAB1a (referred to as 1a−/− mice) or GABAB1b (1b−/− mice) initiation codon were viable, reproduced normally, and exhibited no overt phenotypic abnormalities. Mutant mice showed normal levels of GABAB1a and GABAB1b mRNA, indicating that the genetic manipulations do not influence mRNA expression or stability (Figure 1B). Immunoblot analysis revealed the total absence of GABAB1a and GABAB1b protein in 1a−/− and 1b−/− mice, respectively, confirming that mutation of the initiation codons prevents translation of the individual subunits (Figure 1C). GABAB1a and GABAB1b proteins appeared upregulated in total brain extracts of knockout mice (Figure 1C), possibly because of increased availability of complementary GABAB2 protein, which is required for cross-stabilization (Gassmann et al., 2004Gassmann M. Shaban H. Vigot R. Sansig G. Haller C. Barbieri S. Humeau Y. Schuler V. Muller M. Kinzel B. et al.Redistribution of GABAB(1) protein and atypical GABAB responses in GABAB(2)-deficient mice.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6086-6097Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We analyzed whether GABAB protein is also upregulated in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, where the electrophysiological and morphological studies described below were carried out. Similar to those seen in total brain extracts, GABAB1a and GABAB1b protein levels in CA1 extracts were increased in the 1b−/− (129% of wild-type) and 1a−/− mice (115% of wild-type), respectively (Figure S1). Immunohistochemistry in the CA1 and CA3 region of the hippocampus revealed completely overlapping expression patterns for the GABAB1a and GABAB1b proteins (Figure 2), consistent with an ubiquitous expression of the two proteins in brain neurons (Bischoff et al., 1999Bischoff S. Leonhard S. Reymann N. Schuler V. Shigemoto R. Kaupmann K. Bettler B. Spatial distribution of GABABR1 receptor mRNA and binding sites in the rat brain.J. Comp. Neurol. 1999; 412: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The regional immunostaining in 1a−/− and wild-type mice was similar, while the staining in 1b−/− mice was more diffuse and lacked distinct laminar boundaries. Immunohistochemistry therefore suggests differences in the relative abundance of the two isoform proteins at different subcellular sites. For example, intense immunoreactivity is evident in CA3 stratum lucidum of 1b−/− mice, which may hint at a preferential expression of GABAB1a protein at presynaptic sites (arrowhead in Figure 2). The immunostainings obtained with antibodies directed at the GABAB1 and GABAB2 proteins are similar in the different strains of mice, suggesting that most of the GABAB2 and GABAB1 protein assembles into heterodimeric receptors. To compare the pharmacology of GABAB1a and GABAB1b in native tissue, we analyzed the inhibition of [125I]CGP64213 antagonist binding (Kaupmann et al., 1997Kaupmann K. Huggel K. Heid J. Flor P.J. Bischoff S. Mickel S.J. McMaster G. Angst C. Bittiger H. Froestl W. Bettler B. Expression cloning of GABAB receptors uncovers similarity to metabotropic glutamate receptors.Nature. 1997; 386: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar) by GABA and L-baclofen in cortical membranes (Figure 3A). In agreement with recombinant data (Kaupmann et al., 1998Kaupmann K. Malitschek B. Schuler V. Heid J. Froestl W. Beck P. Mosbacher J. Bischoff S. Kulik A. Shigemoto R. et al.GABAB-receptor subtypes assemble into functional heteromeric complexes.Nature. 1998; 396: 683-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar), the inhibition curves for wild-type, 1a−/−, and 1b−/− mice were almost identical (IC50 values for wild-type, 1a−/−, and 1b−/− mice in μM are as follows: GABA: 0.7 ± 0.2, 0.4 ± 0.2, 0.6 ± 0.2; baclofen: 1.2 ± 0.3, 0.8 ± 0.3, 0.9 ± 0.3; n = 3 per genotype). [3H]baclofen binding in 1a−/− and 1b−/− cortical membranes was similarly reduced compared to wild-type membranes (Figure 3B), in agreement with the relative abundance of the two isoform proteins in the cortex (Kaupmann et al., 1997Kaupmann K. Huggel K. Heid J. Flor P.J. Bischoff S. Mickel S.J. McMaster G. Angst C. Bittiger H. Froestl W. Bettler B. Expression cloning of GABAB receptors uncovers similarity to metabotropic glutamate receptors.Nature. 1997; 386: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). To determine functional GABAB receptor levels, we measured GTPγ[35S] binding, which assesses the activation of Gαi/o-type G proteins, the main effectors of GABAB receptors (Figure 3C). Cortical membranes of 1a−/− and 1b−/− mice showed 52% ± 4% and 28% ± 8% of the maximal GTPγ[35S] binding seen with wild-type mice. The sum of the maximal GTPγ[35S] responses in knockout membranes is therefore 20% lower than expected. This suggests the absence of a compensatory upregulation of functional receptor levels, despite the upregulation of GABAB1 isoforms seen at the protein level (Figure 1C and Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). Presumably, most of the extra GABAB1 isoform protein is retained intracellularly and does not participate in functional responses.Figure 3Pharmacological and Biochemical Analysis of Brain Membranes from Wild-Type, 1a−/−, and 1b−/− MiceShow full caption(A) Inhibition of [125I]CGP64213 GABAB antagonist binding to cortical membranes by the agonists GABA and L-baclofen (L-Bac).

Using whole-cell patch-clamp recording in slice preparations, we examined whether wild-type and knockout mice differ in their hippocampal GABAB responses. We first checked for the presence of heteroreceptors on excitatory terminals. Stimulation of the Schaffer collateral-commissural fibers induces excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in CA1 pyramidal neurons, which are reduced by blocking glutamate release through activation of GABAB heteroreceptors (Schuler et al., 2001Schuler V. Lüscher C. Blanchet C. Klix N. Sansig G. Klebs K. Schmutz M. Heid J. Gentry C. Urban L. et al.Epilepsy, hyperalgesia, impaired memory, and loss of pre- and postsynaptic GABAB responses in mice lacking GABAB(1).Neuron. 2001; 31: 47-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Baclofen, a GABAB agonist, was effective in reducing the EPSC amplitude in wild-type and 1b−/− mice but not in 1a−/− mice (Figures 4A and 4B). As a control, adenosine inhibited glutamate release in all three genotypes. This indicates that 1a−/− mice, in contrast to 1b−/− mice, lack GABAB heteroreceptors on Schaffer collateral terminals. Small residual heteroreceptor activity in 1a−/− mice suggests that minute amounts of GABAB receptors assembled with GABAB1b are localized at glutamatergic terminals. We next looked for the presence of autoreceptors on GABAergic terminals and recorded inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in the presence of the ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonist kynurenate. Baclofen reduced the amplitude of IPSCs in CA1 pyramidal neurons of all genotypes, suggesting that both GABAB1a and GABAB1b can efficiently participate in autoreceptor function (Figures 4C and 4D). Postsynaptic GABAB receptors induce a late IPSC by activating Kir3-type K+ channels (Lüscher et al., 1997Lüscher C. Jan L.Y. Stoffel M. Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A. G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying K+ channels (GIRKs) mediate postsynaptic but not presynaptic transmitter actions in hippocampal neurons.Neuron. 1997; 19: 687-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). At a holding potential of −50 mV and in physiological extracellular [K+], baclofen elicited similar outward currents in CA1 pyramidal cells of 1a−/− and wild-type mice (Figures 4E and 4F). However, in CA1 pyramidal cells of 1b−/− mice, the baclofen-induced outward current was reduced by ∼60% compared to wild-type or 1a−/− mice. This indicates that predominantly GABAB1b mediates postsynaptic inhibition. As a control, adenosine receptors, which converge on the same Kir3 channels (Lüscher et al., 1997Lüscher C. Jan L.Y. Stoffel M. Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A. G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying K+ channels (GIRKs) mediate postsynaptic but not presynaptic transmitter actions in hippocampal neurons.Neuron. 1997; 19: 687-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar), induced similar outward currents in all genotypes. It is formally possible that the upregulation of GABAB1a protein observed in the 1b−/− mice (Figure 1C and Figure S1) compensates to some extent for the missing GABAB1b protein. We consider this unlikely because functional receptor levels in the 1b−/− mice are lower than expected (Figure 3C). Moreover, GFP-tagged GABAB1a protein clearly distributes to the dendritic compartment of CA1 neurons when expressed in organotypic slice culture (Figure 6A). Likely, therefore, both GABAB1a- and GABAB1b-containing receptors address Kir3 channels under normal conditions. The lack of suitable antibodies thus far prevented studying the distribution of GABAB1 isoforms using electron microscopy. We now used the 1a−/− and 1b−/− mice to determine the subcellular localization of GABAB1b and GABAB1a protein, respectively. Preembedding immunogold labeling experiments in the CA1 stratum radiatum of wild-type mice confirmed that GABAB1 protein is present in pre- and postsynaptic elements (Figure 5A), as reported for rat brain (Kulik et al., 2003Kulik A. Vida I. Lujan R. Haas C.A. Lopez-Bendito G. Shigemoto R. Frotscher M. Subcellular localization of metabotropic GABAB receptor subunits GABAB(1a/b) and GABAB(2) in the rat hippocampus.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 11026-11035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In 1a−/− mice, GABAB1b was mostly found in spines opposite glutamate release sites (Figures 5B and 5C). In 1b−/− mice, GABAB1a predominantly localized to glutamatergic terminals (Figures 5D and 5E). Quantitative analysis of GABAB1 labeling showed that the ratio of pre- to postsynaptic immunoparticles in wild-type, 1a−/−, and 1b−/− mice was 0.31, 0.17, and 1.61, respectively (Figure 5F). Thus, the electron microscopy data support the electrophysiological data (Figure 4) and confirm that GABAB1a preferentially localizes to glutamatergic terminals. Consistent with residual heteroreceptor activity (Figures 4A and 4B), some presynaptic immunogold labeling persisted at glutamatergic 1a−/− synapses. We analyzed whether GFP-tagged GABAB1a and GABAB1b proteins exhibit a distinct subcellular distribution when expressed in hippocampal neurons. For these experiments, we transfected organotypic hippocampal slice cultures, which preserve the basic CA3-CA1 connectivity, with expression vectors coding for GABAB1a-GFP or GABAB1b-GFP. We coexpressed a freely diffusible red fluorescent protein (RFP), tdimer2, to normalize the green fluorescence to the red fluorescence. Both GABAB1a-GFP and GABAB1b-GFP proteins were robustly expressed in the dendrites of transfected CA1 pyramidal neurons (Figures 6A, 6B, and 6D). GABAB1b-GFP was expressed in the majority of dendritic spines, while GABAB1a-GFP was largely excluded from this location. This agrees with the electron microscopy data showing a preferential association of the GABAB1b protein with spines opposite to glutamate release sites (Figures 5B and 5C), a location where Kir3 channels are highly coclustered with GABAB receptors (Kulik et al., 2006Kulik A. Vida I. Fukuzawa Y. Guetg N. Kasugai Y. Marker C.L. Rigato F. Bettler B. Wickman K. Frotscher M. Shigemoto R.

This may explain why predominantly GABAB1b mediates the activation of Kir3 currents (Figures 4E and 4F). The data further indicate an almost exclusive association of the GABAB1a-GFP protein with distal axons (Figure 6), again in agreement with the electrophysiological (Figures 4A and 4B) and morphological data (Figures 5D and 5E). Activation of postsynaptic GABAB receptors was shown to restrict long-term potentiation (LTP), whereas activation of autoreceptors promotes LTP (Davies and Collingridge, 1996Davies C.H. Collingridge G.L. Regulation of EPSPs by the synaptic activation of GABAB autoreceptors in rat hippocampus.J. Physiol. 1996; 496: 451-470PubMed Google Scholar, Davies et al., 1991Davies C.H. Starkey S.J. Pozza M.F. Collingridge G.L. GABA autoreceptors regulate the induction of LTP.Nature. 1991; 349: 609-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). A role for GABAB heteroreceptors in synaptic plasticity is not known. We therefore addressed whether the genetic loss of heteroreceptors in 1a−/− mice affects LTP at CA3-to-CA1 synapses. In wild-type CA1 neurons, the pairing protocol induced a marked potentiation of the EPSC amplitude (268.9% ± 58.3%; n = 7) (Figures 7A and 7B). No LTP developed when NMDA receptors were antagonized (CPP + 7-Cl-kynurenic acid) or when the cell under recording was kept at −70 mV (Figure 7B). 1−/− mice, which completely lack functional GABAB receptors (Schuler et al., 2001Schuler V. Lüscher C. Blanchet C. Klix N. Sansig G. Klebs K. Schmutz M. Heid J. Gentry C. Urban L. et al.Epilepsy, hyperalgesia, impaired memory, and loss of pre- and postsynaptic GABAB responses in mice lacking GABAB(1).Neuron. 2001; 31: 47-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), did not exhibit notable LTP (9.4% ± 20.3%; n = 5), nor did 1a−/− mice (−8.9% ± 9.3%; n = 9) (Figures 7A and 7B). In contrast, 1b−/− mice exhibited normal LTP (228.7% ± 43.3%; n = 5). Wild-type neurons developed LTP even after acute pharmacological blockade of GABAB receptors with the antagonist CGP54626 (182.8% ± 54%; n = 6), showing that acute blockade of GABAB receptors does not prevent the induction of LTP. Adaptive changes (see below) due to the constitutive absence of heteroreceptors are therefore expected to underlie the lack of LTP in 1a−/− neurons (Figure 7B). The amplitude ratio of evoked EPSCs in response to paired-pulse stimulation was similar in wild-type, 1a−/−, and 1b−/− CA1 pyramidal neurons (Figure 7C). A change in the paired-pulse ratio is generally believed to reflect an underlying change in the presynaptic probability of release. The absence of differences in the paired-pulse ratio between the three genotypes therefore provides no evidence for a change in the release probability in 1a−/− mice. Moreover, these results indicate that the paired-pulse protocol does not result in the activation of GABAB heteroreceptors in wild-type neurons, nor do heteroreceptors appear to be tonically activated by ambient GABA, in agreement with earlier studies (Morrisett et al., 1991Morrisett R.A.

https://openalex.org/W2166454523,"The apical tuft of layer 5 pyramidal neurons is innervated by a large number of inhibitory inputs with unknown functions. Here, we studied the functional consequences and underlying molecular mechanisms of apical inhibition on dendritic spike activity. Extracellular stimulation of layer 1, during blockade of glutamatergic transmission, inhibited the dendritic Ca2+ spike for up to 400 ms. Activation of metabotropic GABAB receptors was responsible for a gradual and long-lasting inhibitory effect, whereas GABAA receptors mediated a short-lasting (∼150 ms) inhibition. Our results suggest that the mechanism underlying the GABAB inhibition of Ca2+ spikes involves direct blockade of dendritic Ca2+ channels. By using knockout mice for the two predominant GABAB1 isoforms, GABAB1a and GABAB1b, we showed that postsynaptic inhibition of Ca2+ spikes is mediated by GABAB1b, whereas presynaptic inhibition of GABA release is mediated by GABAB1a. We conclude that the molecular subtypes of GABAB receptors play strategically different physiological roles in neocortical neurons."

Attentional impairments, broadly defined, feature prominently in the symptomatology of a variety of psychiatric conditions and are often accompanied by structural and functional abnormalities in a network of structures, including anterior cingulate and lateral prefrontal cortices (Cohen and Servan-Schreiber, 1992Cohen J.D.

A more concrete understanding of the contribution of subcomponents of this circuitry to cognitive control is crucial for understanding the relationship between clinical symptomatology and neuropathology in these conditions. Converging evidence from rodent, primate, and human imaging studies implicates a network of structures, including lateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and posterior parietal cortex (PPC), in dissociable aspects of cognitive and behavioral regulation (Dias et al., 1996Dias R.

There is a growing consensus that lateral prefrontal cortex acts to support task-relevant representations of stimulus information and stimulus-response mappings, thus favoring them in competitions with task-inappropriate representations in posterior cortex (Desimone and Duncan, 1995Desimone R.

Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 8728-8733Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Posterior parietal cortex has been implicated in the generation of motor plans via transformations of sensory inputs from multiple modalities (Anderson and Buneo, 2002Anderson R.A. Buneo C.A.

Neurosci. 2002; 25: 189-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar) and may integrate representations of reward information in the service of perceptual decision-making (Platt and Glimcher, 1999Platt M.L.

Neural computations that underlie decisions about sensory stimuli.Trends. Cogn. Sci. 2001; 5: 10-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). One influential theory, known as the conflict-monitoring hypothesis, posits that ACC monitors conflicts in information processing and recruits lateral prefrontal cortex to resolve competition as needed (Botvinick et al., 2001Botvinick M.M. Braver T.S. Barch D.M. Carter C.S. Cohen J.D. Conflict monitoring and cognitive control.Psychol. Rev. 2001; 108: 624-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (4682) Google Scholar). The conflict-monitoring hypothesis makes a variety of testable predictions, several of which have been confirmed in a series of recent experiments. These studies demonstrated that ACC activity is higher on trials associated with multiple competing responses; that dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) activity is increased across blocks of trials expected to require greater control; and that increased ACC activity on a given trial predicts increased DLPFC activity and more effective behavioral regulation on the subsequent trial (Carter et al., 1998Carter C.S. Braver T.S. Barch D.M. Botvinick M.M. Noll D. Cohen J.D.

Anterior cingulate conflict monitoring and adjustments in control.Science. 2004; 303: 1023-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar). The conflict-monitoring hypothesis provides a plausible account of how anterior cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices act in concert to detect conflict and implement control to resolve it, while producing testable, mechanistically specific predictions, many of which have been verified. However, recent findings complicate this model. Using variations of the Stroop task, Milham and colleagues showed that with practice, DLPFC is engaged independently of ACC, a finding at odds with the assertion that ACC acts to recruit DLPFC in this paradigm (Milham et al., 2003Milham M.P. Banich M.T. Claus E.D. Cohen N.J. Practice-related effects demonstrate complementary roles of anterior cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices in attentional control.Neuroimage. 2003; 18: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). They also showed that while DLPFC, PPC, and ACC respond to manipulations of conflict, the role of ACC is limited to conflict at the level of the response and not at the level of the stimulus representation (Milham and Banich, 2005Milham M.P. Banich M.T. Anterior cingulate cortex: an fMRI analysis of conflict specificity and functional differentiation.Hum. Brain. Mapp. 2005; 25: 328-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), leading some to speculate that ACC may act with DLPFC to resolve conflicts, not detect them (Paus, 2001Paus T. Primate anterior cingulate cortex: where motor control, drive, and cognition interface.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 417-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). We reasoned that conflict should be particularly robust, and therefore more amenable to measurement, in a task-switching paradigm in which subjects responded to either the color or the motion of a visual stimulus. A growing body of neuroimaging research has investigated the role of DLPFC, ACC, and PPC in reconfiguring task sets (e.g., Sohn et al., 2000Sohn M.H. Ursu S. Anderson J.R. Stenger V.A. Carter C.S.

Though our findings are discussed below in the context of this work, it should be emphasized that the principal aims of the present study were (1) to examine the role of these structures in the detection and resolution of conflicts in information processing; and (2) to dissociate the contributions of response conflict and stimulus conflict to cognitive control demands, using task switching as a tool to probe and accentuate these effects. Other studies have implicated ACC in responding to conflict by comparing trials associated with multiple incongruent stimulus-response mappings to congruent trials. Conflict in these studies is defined in cognitive rather than physiologic terms (MacDonald et al., 2000MacDonald A.W. Cohen J.D. Stenger V.A. Carter C.S. Dissociating the role of the dorsolateral prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex in cognitive control.Science. 2000; 288: 1835-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (2718) Google Scholar, Kerns et al., 2004Kerns J.G.

Anterior cingulate conflict monitoring and adjustments in control.Science. 2004; 303: 1023-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar). Here, we adopt a complementary approach: in accord with computational formulations (Botvinick et al., 2001Botvinick M.M. Braver T.S. Barch D.M. Carter C.S. Cohen J.D. Conflict monitoring and cognitive control.Psychol. Rev. 2001; 108: 624-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (4682) Google Scholar), we define conflict in terms of the product of activities in areas specialized for color or motion processing and examine how the BOLD signal in lateral prefrontal, anterior cingulate, and posterior parietal cortices varies with this measure on a trial-by-trial basis. Event-related fMRI scans were acquired from 19 healthy young adults (ten males) while they made discriminations concerning either the color or the motion of a series of visual stimuli. On each trial, subjects viewed a pair of circular square-wave gratings, one red and one green. Each grating moved either up or down. The gratings flanked a simultaneously presented, centrally located task cue (“M” or “C”). If the cue was an “M,” the subject responded by choosing the side with the upward moving grating, regardless of color. If the cue was a “C,” the subject responded by choosing the side with the red grating, regardless of motion (Figure 1). Repeat trials were defined as those preceded by two to five trials of the same dimension (e.g., MMMM). Shift trials were those preceded by two to five trials of the opposite dimension (e.g., CCCM). Trials also varied with manipulations of conflict at the level of the response and the stimulus representation. In a low response conflict trial, the red grating was also the upward moving grating so the correct response was the same in both dimensions. In a high response conflict trial, the red grating was downward moving, and the green grating was upward moving so the correct response depended on the cue (see Figure 2B). Stimulus conflict was parametrically manipulated by adjusting the color saturation on motion trials and the square-wave contrast on color trials, yielding three levels of conflict (low, medium, and high; see Figure 2C) that varied with the salience of the irrelevant dimension (Campbell and Maffei, 1980Campbell F.W. Maffei L. The influence of spatial frequency and contrast on the perception of moving patterns.Vision Res. 1980; 21: 713-721Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar). For each trial of a given dimension, the salience of the relevant dimension was held constant; only the salience of the irrelevant dimension was varied. Thus, the difficulty of the relevant visual discrimination did not vary from trial to trial independently of competing stimulus information from the irrelevant dimension. Color and motion trials were presented in a pseudorandomized order such that the task cue could not be predicted, and each contrast described below was counterbalanced for dimension, side of target presentation, response conflict, and stimulus conflict. Importantly, this counterbalancing ensured that the stimulus conflict manipulation was not confounded by conflict at the level of the response (and vice versa) or by other attentional demands, independent of those associated with interference from the irrelevant dimension. (See the Supplemental Data available with this article online for further discussion.) Analysis of behavioral data confirmed the validity of these manipulations (Figure 2). All behavioral effects were observed for both color and motion trials, so these results are collapsed across dimension. Shift trials were slower [F(1,18) = 388.03, p < 0.001] and less accurate [F(1,18) = 6.50, p = 0.02] than dimension-matched repeat trials. As predicted, both conflict manipulations were also associated with significant behavioral impairments. Response conflict was associated with impairments in reaction time [F(1,18) = 50.1, p < 0.001] and accuracy [F(1,18) = 4.37, p = 0.05]. Post hoc contrasts indicated that these effects were driven by shift trials: whereas high conflict shifts were slower (t = 3.81, p < 0.001) and less accurate (t = 1.95, p = 0.05) than low conflict shifts, the effects of response conflict on repeat trial RT (t = 1.81, p = 0.07) and accuracy (t = 1.27, p = 0.21) did not reach significance. This was reflected in an interaction between response conflict and task switching for reaction time [F(1,18) = 14.79, p < 0.001]. The effects of stimulus conflict were confined primarily to reaction time [F(2,36) = 36.14, p < 0.001]: for both shift [F(2,36) = 10.60, p < 0.001] and repeat trials [F(2,36) = 7.74, p = 0.001], a main effect of stimulus conflict was observed such that increasing interference from the irrelevant dimension was associated with slower reaction times. There was also an effect of stimulus conflict on accuracy [F(2,36) = 4.77, p = 0.01] that was specific to shifts [F(2,36) = 7.27, p = 0.001] but not repeats [F(2,36) = 0.47, p = 0.63], as reflected in an interaction between stimulus conflict and task switching [F(2,36) = 9.35, p < 0.001]. However, this effect was confounded by an interaction between stimulus conflict and response conflict [F(2,36) = 17.66, p < 0.001]. That is, the main effect of stimulus conflict on accuracy was limited to high response conflict shift trials [F(2,36) = 27.05, p < 0.001] and not low response conflict shifts [F(2,36) = 1.47, p = 0.24]. No other main effects or interactions were observed. Thus, stimulus conflict was associated with impairment in reaction time but not accuracy per se, but this effect persisted even for repeat trials. Response conflict was associated with impairments in accuracy as well as reaction time that were compounded when response conflict and stimulus conflict were both high, but these effects diminished rapidly over the course of two to five repetitions. This behavioral paradigm was designed to address three questions in the imaging data. First, we identified the principal regions involved in shifting attentional set and reconfiguring task rules by contrasting shift trials with dimension-matched repeat trials. Next, we sought to dissociate the contributions of conflict at the level of the stimulus representation and at the level of the response to these patterns of activity. Finally, we examined how these regions responded to a physiologic index of conflict. Shift trials relative to dimension-matched repeat trials engaged a network of prefrontal and parietal structures (Figure 3), including bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 8/9), bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (BA 24/32), and bilateral posterior parietal cortex (BA 40/7). These regions were also engaged when color trials and motion trials were examined separately, so the results depicted in Figure 3 are collapsed across dimension. The precise locations of these regions, as well as the locations of regions engaged for color trials but not motion trials or vice versa, are detailed in Table S1 in the Supplemental Data. Next, we examined the effects of response and stimulus conflict on activity in DLPFC, ACC, and PPC. This served both to dissociate the contributions of each type of conflict and to identify regions of interest that were particularly sensitive to conflict within the relatively large areas of DLPFC, ACC, and PPC activated in the task-switching contrast. High response conflict shifts relative to low response conflict shifts (Figure 4A) engaged a network of structures that included rostral anterior cingulate cortex (BA 24/32, p < 0.05) but not the region of dorsal PPC (BA 7, p > 0.62) illustrated in Figure 3, which was reflected in an interaction between region (ACC, PPC) and response conflict [F(1,18) = 5.22, p = 0.035]. Other areas that were sensitive to response conflict included ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (inferior frontal gyrus: BA 44/45), orbitofrontal cortex (BA 11), and inferior aspects of posterior parietal cortex (BA 40; Figure 4C: p < 0.05; see Table S2 for precise locations). These effects were limited to shift trials; no effects of response conflict on repeat trials were observed, which was confirmed by an interaction between task switching (shift, repeat) and response conflict [F(1,18) = 13.46, p = 0.002]. High stimulus conflict shifts relative to low stimulus conflict shifts (Figure 4B) engaged a network of structures located dorsal to the areas sensitive to response conflict (compare red and green regions, respectively, in Figure 4C). This included a region of right dorsal posterior parietal cortex (BA 7, p < 0.05) that converged with the region depicted in Figure 3, but not anterior cingulate cortex (p > 0.85). This dissociation was reflected in an interaction between region (ACC, PPC) and stimulus conflict [F(2,36) = 3.19, p = 0.05]. Other areas that were sensitive to stimulus conflict included right DLPFC (BA 8/9), which converged with the ROI depicted in Figure 3, and right anterior prefrontal cortex (BA 9/10; Figure 5C: p < 0.05; for precise locations, see Table S3). A similar pattern was observed when shifts and repeats were analyzed together and for repeat trials alone, though activations were more robust in this contrast. Although high and low stimulus conflict shifts included equal numbers of high and low response conflict trial types, we further controlled for the confounding effects of response conflict by performing this contrast on low response conflict shift trials exclusively. Activities in all three areas remained significant. Thus, ACC, but not DLPFC or dorsal PPC, were sensitive to conflict at the level of the response, while DLPFC and dorsal PPC but not ACC were sensitive to conflict at the level of the stimulus representation. Finally, we examined how activity in these three structures varied with a physiologic index of conflict. The conflict-monitoring hypothesis states that anterior cingulate cortex acts to detect conflicts in information processing in posterior cortex. According to this view, when activity in two competing neural units is high, activity in anterior cingulate cortex should also be elevated (Botvinick et al., 2001Botvinick M.M. Braver T.S. Barch D.M. Carter C.S. Cohen J.D. Conflict monitoring and cognitive control.Psychol. Rev. 2001; 108: 624-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (4682) Google Scholar). To test this prediction, we identified six occipitotemporal regions that were primarily motion sensitive or primarily color sensitive by contrasting color shift trials with motion shift trials. The three most significant color-sensitive areas were located in the middle and superior temporal gyri (BA 20, 21; Talairach coordinates: −43, 7, −21; −42, 2, −5; 58, −34, 3). Primarily motion-sensitive regions were located in two areas of extrastriate occipital cortex and in the middle temporal gyrus (BA 18, 19, 21; Talairach coord: 36, −65, 1; 26, −79, 18; −44, −52, −9). In accord with Botvinick and colleagues' (Botvinick et al., 2001Botvinick M.M. Braver T.S. Barch D.M. Carter C.S. Cohen J.D. Conflict monitoring and cognitive control.Psychol. Rev. 2001; 108: 624-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (4682) Google Scholar) computational formulation, conflict was indexed as a normalized product of the activities (% change in BOLD signal from the run-average baseline) in these three color-sensitive regions and three motion-sensitive regions, summed across all nine combinations:Conflict=sqrt∑i,jCi×MjorConflict=sqrt[(C1+C2+C3)(M1+M2+M3)]. Importantly, this formulation differs from that adopted in Botvinick and colleagues' (Botvinick et al., 2001Botvinick M.M. Braver T.S. Barch D.M. Carter C.S. Cohen J.D. Conflict monitoring and cognitive control.Psychol. Rev. 2001; 108: 624-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (4682) Google Scholar) computational model in that they ensured that competing units were connected by negative weights, whereas we could not reliably assess the association between the color- and motion-sensitive regions examined in our study. Instead, our index was intended to serve as a measure of conflict not between two competing perceptual areas per se, but rather between two stimulus-response processing streams, which are assumed to compete with each other. This was most easily measured in components of these processing streams that are anatomically distinct, i.e., in perceptual regions. Activities in the color- and motion-sensitive regions were assumed to be proxies for activity in their respective processing streams. Justifications for these assumptions and further discussion of the limitations of this analysis are included as Supplemental Data. To confirm the validity of the construct, we examined how the conflict index varied by trial type. As predicted, conflict was higher for shift trials than for repeat trials (Figure 5A: t = 1.85, p = 0.033, one-tailed). We then examined how this physiologic index of conflict predicted activity in DLPFC, ACC, and dorsal PPC on a trial-by-trial basis, excluding trials when color- and motion-sensitive regions were both below baseline. Within the relatively large areas of DLPFC, ACC, and PPC activated in the task-switching contrast, we selected regions that overlapped with either conflict contrast to maximize conflict sensitivity. These included right DLPFC (36, 32, 36) and right dorsal PPC (24, −60, 45), which were active in both the task-switching and stimulus conflict contrasts, and an area of right rostral ACC (Talairach coordinates: 5, 37, 17), which was active in both the task-switching and response conflict contrasts. (See Supplemental Data for further discussion of region of interest [ROI] selection.) The conflict index was significantly correlated with the BOLD signal (percent change from baseline) in all three regions of interest, but the strength of this correlation varied from region to region. Correlations with anterior cingulate cortex (BA 24/32, r = 0.49, p < 0.001; Figure 5B) and posterior parietal cortex (BA 7, r = 0.48, p < 0.001; Figure 5C) were significantly stronger (ACC: Z = 3.08, p < 0.001; PPC: Z = 2.49, p < 0.007) than the correlation with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 8/9, r = 0.38, p < 0.001). Interestingly, the conflict index predicted activity in ACC independent of PPC (r = 0.31, p < 0.001) and vice versa (r = 0.26, p < 0.001). In contrast, it accounted for only 1% of the variance in DLPFC activity (R2 = 0.012) independent of activity in these two structures. Thus, dorsal PPC as well as ACC were uniquely sensitive to conflict. Moreover, ACC and PPC were sensitive to dissociable forms of conflict at the level of the response or at the level of the stimulus representation, respectively, which suggests that the central tenet of the conflict-monitoring hypothesis may apply to PPC as well as ACC. Previous work has confirmed several additional predictions of the conflict-monitoring hypothesis concerning the role of ACC in regulating DLPFC activity and executing appropriate behavioral adjustments. These investigations have shown that increased ACC activity precedes increased DLPFC activity and is associated with enhanced behavioral performance on subsequent trials (Kerns et al., 2004Kerns J.G. Cohen J.D. MacDonald A.W. Cho R.Y. Stenger V.A. Carter C.S. Anterior cingulate conflict monitoring and adjustments in control.Science. 2004; 303: 1023-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar). We attempted to replicate the findings reported in Kerns et al., 2004Kerns J.G. Cohen J.D. MacDonald A.W. Cho R.Y. Stenger V.A. Carter C.S. Anterior cingulate conflict monitoring and adjustments in control.Science. 2004; 303: 1023-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar and then tested whether these predictions also applied to posterior parietal cortex. First, we tested whether increased activity in ACC and dorsal PPC on high response conflict and high stimulus conflict trials, respectively, preceded increased activity in DLPFC. As predicted, increased ACC activity on the current trial preceded increased DLPFC activity on the subsequent trial (r = 0.45, p < 0.001). This was also observed for dorsal PPC (r = 0.48, p < 0.001), consistent with an analogous role for this structure in recruiting DLPFC (Figure 6A). Importantly, dorsal PPC predicted subsequent DLPFC activity independent of shared variance with ACC (r = 0.19, p < 0.001), and vice versa (r = 0.20, p < 0.001), which is suggestive of independent roles for these structures in DLPFC regulation. Next, we tested whether ACC and dorsal PPC activity predicted subsequent behavioral adjustments. In accord with Kerns et al., 2004Kerns J.G. Cohen J.D. MacDonald A.W. Cho R.Y. Stenger V.A.

Mutations in the genes encoding cationic trypsinogen (PRSS1)1 and the pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (SPINK1)2 are associated with chronic pancreatitis. Because increased proteolytic activity owing to mutated PRSS1 enhances the risk for chronic pancreatitis, mutations in the gene encoding anionic trypsinogen (PRSS2) may also predispose to disease. Here we analyzed PRSS2 in individuals with chronic pancreatitis and controls and found, to our surprise, that a variant of codon 191 (G191R) is overrepresented in control subjects: G191R was present in 220/6,459 (3.4%) controls but in only 32/2,466 (1.3%) affected individuals (odds ratio 0.37; P = 1.1 × 10−8). Upon activation by enterokinase or trypsin, purified recombinant G191R protein showed a complete loss of trypsin activity owing to the introduction of a new tryptic cleavage site that renders the enzyme hypersensitive to autocatalytic proteolysis. In conclusion, the G191R variant of PRSS2 mitigates intrapancreatic trypsin activity and thereby protects against chronic pancreatitis."
https://openalex.org/W2063377436,"The ability of the mature mammalian nervous system to continually produce neuronal precursors is of considerable importance, as manipulation of this process might one day permit the replacement of cells lost as a result of injury or disease. In mammals, the anterior subventricular zone (SVZa) region is one of the primary sites of adult neurogenesis. Here we show that doublecortin (DCX), a widely used marker for newly generated neurons, when deleted in mice results in a severe morphological defect in the rostral migratory stream and delayed neuronal migration that is independent of direction or responsiveness to Slit chemorepulsion. DCX is required for nuclear translocation and maintenance of bipolar morphology during migration of these cells. Our data identifies a critical function for DCX in the movement of newly generated neurons in the adult brain."

To achieve a behavioral goal in daily life, we often need to plan multiple steps of motor behavior that involve selection of a series of actions. The question arises: how are individual neurons within the PFC involved in the planning of multistep behaviors? More specifically, does the activity of PFC neurons during the process of planning reflect the multiple movements required during future actions or the individual future events that occur as a result of the actions? To answer this question, we examined neuronal activity in the dorsolateral PFC of monkeys that performed a path-planning task that required multiple stepwise movements of a cursor within a maze to reach a goal. Figures 1A and 1C show the sequence and timing of events for each trial in our behavioral task. As the monkeys placed their wrists in neutral positions, a start display appeared, followed by a goal display. When the start display changed its color after delay periods, the monkeys initiated the first movement. Thereafter, they performed the second and third movements, each after a delay period, to capture the goal. Our previous behavioral study demonstrated that this task provides a behavioral model in which monkeys were able to plan multiple steps of actions in advance to avoid obstacles and achieve a goal (Mushiake et al., 2001Mushiake H. Saito N. Sakamoto K. Sato Y. Tanji J. Visually based path-planning by Japanese monkeys.Brain Res. Cogn. Brain Res. 2001; 11: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the present study, we dissociated the actions (arm movements) from the events that occur as a result of the actions (motions of a cursor in a visual display) by incorporating several different assignments that defined the relationship between arm movements and cursor movements (Figure 1B). We used two sets of goals in the maze in which pathways were partially blocked in a variable manner (Figure 2A). We analyzed neuronal activity in the dorsolateral PFC (Figure 2B) during a preparatory period that preceded the GO signal for the first movement.Figure 2Goals and Path Blocks Used in a Recording Session and Cortical Surface Maps of Recording SitesShow full caption(A) Two sets of behavioral conditions for the choice of goal positions (Goals 1–4) and path blocks (Blocks 1–4).

Here we report that neuronal activity in the PFC predominantly reflected multiple future events that would ensue as a result of planned actions, rather than the arm movements required to perform these actions, in contrast to activity in the primary motor cortex that primarily reflected movements of the arm. We trained animals to be able to reach final goals at a success rate averaging more than 85%. It took about a year for the animals to perform at this level. During recording sessions, the success rates for the two animals were 93.1% and 89.4% (not significantly different). We found that 470 of 1020 neurons sampled in the PFC exhibited activity during the delay period that differed significantly from activity during the control period (p < 0.01, Wilcoxon's signed-ranks test). For these 470 neurons, we performed linear regression analysis to elucidate the relationships among the four behavioral variables described in the Experimental Procedures. This analysis revealed that the activity of 176 PFC neurons that exhibited preparatory activity was related to the position of the final goal, while the activity of 88 neurons was related to the path block; the activity of 31 neurons was related to both the goal position and path block (Table 1). The properties of these neurons will be described in detail in a separate paper (also see the Supplemental Data available online). The activity of 210 neurons was found to be related to the motion of the cursor. In contrast, the activity of only 27 PFC neurons was related to arm movements.Table 1Classification of the Activity of Preparatory Prefrontal Cortex Neurons and Primary Cortex NeuronsAreaTotalCursor-Movement RelatedArm-Movement RelatedGoal-Location RelatedPath-Block RelatedGoal and Block RelatedPF470210271768831MI72560340 Open table in a new tab Among the remaining neurons that were not significantly modulated during the preparatory period, 267 neurons were active during the movement execution period. We found that 236 out of the 267 neurons were related to the cursor motion, whereas 31 neurons were related to arm movements. We also found that a group of PFC neurons responded to the goal display (n = 61). Others were active after reaching the final goal (n = 81) or after the reward delivery (n = 93). For the 210 PFC neurons for which activity during the preparatory period was related to cursor movement, we used linear regression analysis to further examine the relationship between the activity of these neurons and the first, second, and third cursor movements. We found that 111 PFC neurons were selective for the first of the three cursor movements. A representative example of such activity is presented in Figure 3A. In this example, neuronal activity during the delay period was significantly greater (p < 0.01) when the monkey was preparing to move the cursor to the goal using three steps, including R-R-U, R-U-R, R-R-D, and R-D-R (R, U, and D denote cursor movements directed toward the right, up, and down, respectively), but not with the other steps shown in the figure. The common factor among these steps was that the cursor movement during the first step was directed to the right. Of 111 neurons with first cursor movement-related activity, activity was selective for either rightward (n = 31), leftward (n = 24), upward (n = 26), or downward (n = 30) motion. An alternative explanation for the apparent selectivity of movement direction is that activity was related to the intended location of the cursor after the first cursor movement (to the right, left, top, or bottom of the start position). In this study, no attempts were made to differentiate between these two possibilities. For 87 of the 210 PFC neurons with preparatory activity, we found that there was selectivity for the second of the three steps of the planned cursor movement. An example of such selectivity is presented in Figure 3B. In this example, neuronal activity was observed selectively when the planned three-step cursor movements were U-L-U and D-L-D (L denotes a cursor movement directed to the left). Thus, the neuron in Figure 3B exhibited selectivity for leftward motion of the intended second movement. In 95 of the 210 PFC neurons with preparatory activity, activity was selective for the third of the three steps of the planned cursor movements. An example of such selectivity is presented in Figure 3C, which illustrates that neuronal activity was selective for the steps U-U-L and D-D-L, i.e., this neuron exhibited selectivity for leftward motion of the intended third movement. These findings indicate that each of the three cursor movements (first, second, and third) that were planned before initiation of the first cursor movement were represented amply by the activity of PFC neurons during the delay period that preceded movement. The recording sites at which the aforementioned neurons were located are presented in Figure 2B. The neurons were distributed widely throughout the banks of the principal sulcus and the dorsal and ventral surface of the periprincipal region. There did not appear to be any tendency for PFC neurons with selective activity to be located within specific regions. A majority of the neurons for which activity was related to the preparatory period (described above) did not exhibit activity during the period in which the three movement steps were executed (motor execution period). Nevertheless, activity in 37% of the preparatory period-related neurons was also detectable during the motor execution period. We examined the relationship between the activity of these neurons and the three directions of cursor movement by analyzing neuronal activity during the first, second, and third movements with the same linear regression analysis used to analyze activity during the preparatory period (p < 0.01). Among the 111 neurons that exhibited selectivity for the first cursor movement during the preparatory period, 48 neurons (43%) also exhibited selectivity for the first cursor movement during the first movement. Activity of a representative example of such a neuron is presented as perievent spike density histograms in the left panel of Figure 4A. The four histograms show the time course of activity for each of the trials beginning with the first step of cursor movement directed to the right (R-x-x), left (L-x-x), up (U-x-x), or down (D-x-x). Only the histogram representing activity during the first cursor movement to the right (R-x-x) exhibited prominent peaks during the preparatory period and the first movement. To quantify the amount of information contained in time-varying neuronal activity, we calculated the predictive information (Is) carried by the occurrence of spikes by quantifying the decrease in entropy in the cursor direction as described in the Experimental Procedures. The amount of information that predicted the first movement (blue trace in the right panel in Figure 4A) exceeded statistical significance (p < 0.01) during the preparatory period and also during the first movement. Next, we analyzed the activity of 87 neurons that exhibited selectivity for the second cursor movement during the preparatory period. Among these neurons, 27 (31%) also exhibited selectivity for the second movement. Figure 4B illustrates an example of such second-cursor-movement-selective activity. In Figure 4B, the spike density histogram for trials that included leftward cursor movement during the second step (x-L-x) exhibited two prominent peaks that corresponded to the preparatory period and the second movement. Quantitative analysis of information predicted by time-varying neuronal activity (right panel of Figure 4B) revealed two prominent peaks that predicted the second cursor movement (green trace) during the preparatory period and during the second movement. A similar analysis of 95 neurons that exhibited selectivity for the third cursor movement during the preparatory period revealed that 34 neurons (36%) also exhibited selectivity for the third movement during the execution period. An example of neuronal activity that exhibited such selectivity is presented in Figure 4C. The spike density histogram illustrates that activity for those trials that included leftward cursor movement during the third step (x-x-L in the left panel) exhibited two prominent peaks during the preparatory period and third movement. Activity in this neuron strongly predicted the third movement during the preparatory period and the third movement (right panel in Figure 4C). To quantify the correlation between the magnitudes of information that predicted the first cursor movement during the preparatory period and during the execution of the first movement, a cross-correlation coefficient was calculated for the 111 neurons that exhibited selectivity for the first cursor movement during the preparatory period. As illustrated in the left panel of Figure 5B, in most of these neurons, direction selectivity during the preparatory period was correlated positively (p < 0.01) with selectivity during the first movement. Similarly, in most of the 87 second-movement-selective neurons, direction selectivity during the preparatory period correlated positively (p < 0.01) with selectivity during the second movement (Figure 5B, middle panel). In most of the 95 third-movement-selective neurons, direction selectivity during the preparatory period correlated positively (p < 0.01) with selectivity during the third movement (Figure 5B, right panel). To what extent does the entire population of preparatory period-related PFC neurons reflect cursor movement or arm movement? What is the time course of information that reflects cursor movement? To answer these questions, we used the perievent spike-density data for all of the 470 preparatory period-related neurons to calculate the bin-by-bin average of information (It) that predicted the first, second, and third cursor movements. The results of this analysis are presented in Figure 5, in which the time-varying magnitude of quantified information is plotted. As illustrated in Figure 5A (upper panel), each of the three cursor movements was represented during the delay period, while information that reflected the first, second, and third cursor movements also appeared during and immediately before the first, second, and third movements, in that order. In contrast, information that predicted the first, second, and third arm movement remained at low levels throughout the task and never reached statistical significance (p > 0.01) (Figure 5A, lower panel). We performed an additional analysis by aligning the population data on both the second and third GO signals, and presented the data with six panels in Figure S2A. As a result of this analysis, we confirmed our point that, for PFC neurons, information predicting cursor motion exceeded a statistically significant level (p < 0.01), whereas information predicting arm movement did not. For the purpose of comparison, we also examined neuronal activity in the MI. In the arm area of MI, we obtained 72 neurons that were defined as preparatory related (Table 1) and 55 neurons that were defined as nonpreparatory related. All of the preparatory MI neurons were active during both preparatory and execution periods. Of these, 60 neurons were found to be arm-movement related. A typical example of such MI neurons is presented in Figure 6A. That neuron was active during the preparatory period when the first arm movement was left pronation (panel in the top left). In addition, the same neuron was active during the movement period for left pronation, regardless of whether that movement appeared in the first, second, or third movement step. For this neuron, information predicting the cursor movement was negligible, in sharp contrast to the richness of information predicting arm movement (right panels in Figure 6A). Results of population analysis for the 72 MI neurons are presented in Figure 6B, where it is apparent that neuronal activity in the MI predicted each of the three arm movements, whereas information predicting the cursor movement did not reach a statistically significant level. We confirmed our findings by aligning the data to the second GO (left panels in Figure S2B) and to the third GO (right panels) signals. We examined whether any of the neuronal activity described above might be related to eye positions or eye movements during the preparatory and execution periods. We performed a multiple regression analysis using four sets of regressors, namely the vertical and horizontal eye positions and the vertical and horizontal components of saccades (see Experimental Procedures). Figures 7A–7C illustrate representative results of such an analysis of the activity of the three neurons, for which activity is presented in Figures 4A–4C. In Figure 7, we plotted the regression coefficients for the four regressors sequentially across time in 50 ms bins after normalizing these values to T values that corresponded to a significance level of 0.01. As illustrated in Figures 7A–7C, none of these three neurons exhibited activity that was significantly related to eye position or eye movement during the preparatory period or during the execution of movements. We subsequently extended our analysis to all 470 neurons that exhibited preparatory activity. Figure 7D illustrates sequential plots of time-varying mean values of the regression coefficients normalized to the T value. In Figure 7D, the regression coefficients remained well below statistical significance (1.0) during all of the periods that were analyzed, which indicated that neuronal activity was not significantly related to eye position or eye movements. Examination of data for individual neurons revealed that eight neurons exhibited activity that appeared to be related to eye movements during the goal display period, but no neurons exhibited activity that was related to eye position or eye movements during the preparatory period or during the execution of movements. We found that neurons in the lateral PFC exhibited substantial changes in activity during a preparatory period in which monkeys were required to plan multiple steps of motor behavior. Neuronal activity during the preparatory period predominantly reflected intended (future) movements of a cursor along a particular path within a maze to reach an intended goal. All cursor movements that had to be prepared (the first, second, and third of three movements) to reach the goal were reflected by the activity of the PFC neurons. In contrast, very few PFC neurons (9%) reflected the intended arm movements during the preparatory period. During the preparatory period, the monkeys were required to generate the information needed to move the cursor to a predetermined goal using three stepwise movements of the cursor. Among the numerous possible sources of information the monkeys may have used, the cursor motion appeared to be reflected in the activity of PFC neurons, i.e., the monkeys planned forthcoming behavior (at least in part) in terms of step-by-step movement of the cursor toward the goal. For the neuronal activity that reflected the first cursor movement, it is possible to interpret the activity as specifying either the direction of the first cursor movement or the position at which the cursor was to be located after the first movement. Moreover, for some neurons (n = 87), activity was selective for the direction of the second cursor movement. It is theoretically possible to plan the location of the cursor to be achieved with the second movement. However, not many neurons exhibited activity that reflected the location of the cursor in the second step (see the Supplemental Data). Remarkably, as many as 44% of neurons that exhibited preparatory activity were selective for the third cursor movement during the preparatory period that preceded the presentation of the first GO signal. For these neurons, selectivity was for the direction of the cursor movement that was to occur during the third step. In contrast to the abundance of neuronal activity that reflected cursor movement, activity that reflected arm movements was not apparent among PFC neurons. This implies that the motion of the cursor itself, rather than arm movement, was primarily processed within the PFC for the purpose of planning motor behavior. We also analyzed 127 neurons in the primary motor cortex of the same monkeys. We found that the activity of these neurons primarily reflected arm movements. In sharp contrast to PFC neurons, activity of MI neurons primarily reflected arm movements. Population analysis also revealed that the representation of cursor motions remained nonsignificant. It is of interest that, during the preparatory period, the neuronal responses that encode each cursor movement occurred simultaneously, not in the order of the first, second, and third motion of the cursor. This finding could imply that the animals were engaged in simultaneous planning of cursor movements, while planning the sequence of their occurrences separately. An alternative explanation may be that the monkeys were engaged in planning the sequence in a retrograde order (starting from the last motion to capture the goal, followed by the second and then the first motion) , in conjunction with a sequence planning with an anterograde order. Further works are necessary to reveal the nature of the sequential planning. Although considerable interest has been directed at the behavioral aspects of the acquisition, retention, and modulation of sensory information, which is often referred to as “working memory” (Petrides, 1996Petrides M.

https://openalex.org/W2069952533,"Macrophage cell death plays a role in many physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Previous work has shown that macrophages can undergo caspase-independent cell death, and this process is associated with Nur77 induction, which is involved in inducing chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation. Here we show that autophagy is a cytosolic event that controls caspase-independent macrophage cell death. Autophagy was induced in macrophages treated with lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) and the pan-caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp (Z-VAD), and the inhibition of autophagy by either chemical inhibitors or by the RNA interference knockdown of beclin (a protein required for autophagic body formation) inhibited caspase-independent macrophage cell death. We also found an increase in poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymerase (PARP) activation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in LPS + Z-VAD-treated macrophages, and both are involved in caspase-independent macrophage cell death. We further determined that the formation of autophagic bodies in macrophages occurs downstream of PARP activation, and PARP activation occurs downstream of ROS production. Using macrophages in which receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) was knocked down by small interfering RNA, and macrophages isolated from Toll/interleukin-1 receptor-domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-β (TRIF)-deficient mice, we found that TRIF and RIP1 function upstream of ROS production in LPS + Z-VAD-treated macrophages. We also found that Z-VAD inhibits LPS-induced RIP1 cleavage, which may contribute to ROS over-production in macrophages. This paper reveals that TRIF, RIP1, and ROS production, as well as PARP activation, are involved in inducing autophagy, which contributes to caspase-independent macrophage cell death.

Macrophages are essential for the host defense system. Phagocytosis of infectious microorganisms and the secretion of proinflammatory mediators by activated macrophages are part of the response to infection of the host (1van R.N. Sanders A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 62: 702-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The importance of macrophages in this defense system is evident by the fact that the virulence of some bacteria is due to their ability to overcome the protective responses of the host by triggering the death of activated macrophages (2Duesbery N.S. Webb C.P. Leppla S.H. Gordon V.M. Klimpel K.R. Copeland T.D. Ahn N.G. Oskarsson M.K. Fukasawa K. Paull K.D. Vande Woude G.F.

However, prolonged activation of macrophages is also believed to be dangerous because it can cause extensive local tissue damage if uncontrolled (5Ricevuti G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 832: 426-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 6Sullivan G.W. Sarembock I.J. Linden J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 67: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 7Cohen J. Nature. 2002; 420: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (2179) Google Scholar). The death of activated macrophages could also be beneficial in controlling the level of inflammation. The viability of activated macrophages is controlled by both death and survival pathways. Many virulent strains of bacteria kill macrophages by blocking survival pathways. For example, the suppression of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 2The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; IFN, interferon; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEF2, myocyte-specific enhancer binding factor 2; ROS, reactive oxygen species; PAR, poly(ADP-ribose); PARP, PAR polymerase; AIF, apoptosis-inducing factor; RIP1, receptor-interacting protein 1; siRNA, small interfering RNA; BHA, butylated hydroxyanisole; MNNG, N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine; DPQ, 3,4-dihydro-5-[4-(s1-piperidinyl)-butoxy]-1(2H)-isoquinolinone; DHIQ, 1,5-dihydroxyisoquinoline; PI, propidium iodide; AO, acridine orange; 3-MA, 3-methyladenine; WM, wortmannin; CM-H2DCFDA, 5-(and 6)-chloromethyl-2′, 7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; VAC, volume of acidic compartments; TRIF, Toll/interleukin-1 receptor-domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-β; DQ, diquat; PN, peroxynitrite; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter. and NF-κB pathways occurs by means of the ubiquitin-like protein protease YopJ from Yersinia pseudotuberculossi and by direct cleavage of MAPKK by anthrax toxin from Bacillus anthracis, both of which are implicated as mechanisms used by bacteria to trigger macrophage cell death (2Duesbery N.S.

Science. 2000; 290: 1594-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Macrophage activation by inflammatory stimuli also activates death and survival pathways. Perhaps due to the balance of these pathways, single stimulating agents such as bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) do not cause a significant change in cell viability in macrophages in vitro. The activation of the survival pathway is evident, as the LPS-activated macrophages are more resistant to the death induced by other stimulating agents such as TNF. Cross-talk between LPS and TNF signaling has been found in macrophages (8Takada Y. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23390-23397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Macrophage activation contributes to macrophage death if the cell encounters a second stimulus that impairs the survival pathway. This has been shown by a number of in vitro experiments, which found that co-stimulation with LPS and IFN-γ or stimulation with LPS in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide causes macrophage cell death (9Gotoh T.

Macrophage death can be mediated through multiple pathways. Caspase activity increases in macrophages when activated by LPS or other stimulating agents (14Kim H.S. Lee M.S. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2005; 280: 41827-41834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Caspase activation may play a dual role in macrophage death since the inhibition of caspase by the pan-caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp (Z-VAD) blocks some apoptotic events, such as DNA fragmentation, but enhances cell death overall (14Kim H.S.

It is known that the death of activated macrophages can be executed by both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent mechanisms. The caspase-dependent death pathway in macrophages regulates cytochrome c release from mitochondria and DNA fragmentation (22Green D. Kroemer G. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 267-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Nur77 contributes to caspase-independent macrophage death since LPS + Z-VAD-induced cell death is reduced significantly in Nur77-deficient macrophages (16Kim S.O. Ono K. Tobias P.S. Han J. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 1441-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway (which is activated by LPS) and the activity of myocyte-specific enhancer binding factor 2 (MEF2) (which is up-regulated by Z-VAD) are both required for Nur77 induction in LPS + Z-VAD-treated macrophages (16Kim S.O. Ono K. Tobias P.S. Han J. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 1441-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The generation of superoxide is believed to play a role in the death of activated macrophages (14Kim H.S. Lee M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6821-6833Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A study showed that STAT1 knock-out macrophages exhibit decreased superoxide production and were resistant to LPS + Z-VAD treatment (14Kim H.S. Lee M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6821-6833Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The influence of p38 MAPK was implied in STAT1 activity and so was its participation in caspase-independent macrophage cell death. How STAT1 regulates superoxide production is largely unknown. Although caspase-independent cell death is not well studied in comparison with classic caspase-dependent apoptosis, several mechanisms have been suggested. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is required for caspase-independent cell death in many different cell types (14Kim H.S. Lee M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6821-6833Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 23Vercammen D. Beyaert R. Denecker G. Goossens V. Van L.G. Declercq W. Grooten J. Fiers W. Vandenabeele P. J. Exp.

The poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) hyperactivation-mediated depletion of cellular NAD+ and its precursor ATP is responsible for DNA damage-reagent-induced caspase-independent cell death (26Zong W.X. Ditsworth D. Bauer D.E. Wang Z.Q. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1272-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 27Berger N.A. Radiat.

It has been reported that PARP-1 hyperactivation prompts mitochondria dysfunction, which in turn releases apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from the mitochondria to the nucleus (29Yu S.W. Wang H.

The involvement of c-Jun N-terminal kinase has recently been demonstrated in caspase-independent cell death by several groups of investigators (31Ventura J.J. Cogswell P. Flavell R.A.

Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 5914-5922Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) and TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) are known to play important roles in cellular responses to TNF and TNF family members, and both were shown to be required for TNF-induced caspase-independent cell death (24Lin Y. Choksi S. Shen H.M. Yang Q.F. Hur G.M. Kim Y.S. Tran J.H. Nedospasov S.A. Liu Z.G. J. Biol.

Tschopp J. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1467) Google Scholar). Autophagic cell death, also called type 2 programmed cell death, is characterized by an accumulation of autophagic vacuoles in the cytoplasm (35Schweichel J.U. Merker H.J. Teratology. 1973; 7: 253-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 36Clarke P.G. Anat. Embryol. (Berl.). 1990; 181: 195-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). It is also a cytoprotective mechanism in response to nutrient depletion. Several phylogenetically conserved genes (Atg genes) are required for autophagy (37Tsukada M. Ohsumi Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar, 38Thumm M. Egner R. Koch B. Schlumpberger M. Straub M. Veenhuis M. Wolf D.H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Small interfering RNA (siRNA) specific for Atg genes can inhibit the autophagic cell death of L929 cells induced by Z-VAD (39Yu L. Alva A. Su H. Dutt P. Freundt E. Welsh S. Baehrecke E.H. Lenardo M.J. Science. 2004; 304: 1500-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar) and the autophagic cell death of Bax–/–Bak–/– mouse embryonic fibroblasts treated with etoposide (20Shimizu S. Kanaseki T. Mizushima N. Mizuta T. rakawa-Kobayashi S. Thompson C.B. Tsujimoto Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1221-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). In addition, autophagic cell death seems to be a predominant mechanism for controlling cell viability in the absence of apoptosis. To better understand the mechanisms of caspase-independent cell death in macrophages, here we examined the death pathway of macrophages triggered by co-stimulation with LPS and Z-VAD. We found that autophagy contributes to the execution of cell death in activated macrophages. We show that the following signal pathway participates in the death of activated macrophages: TRIF → RIP1 → ROS → PARP → autophagy. Reagents and Plasmids—Antibodies against PAR, RIP1, and beclin-1 were purchased from Pharmingen. Z-VAD and butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) were purchased from Calbiochem. N-Methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), 3,4-dihydro-5-[4-(s1-piperidinyl)-butoxy]-1(2H)-isoquinolinone (DPQ), 1,5-dihydroxyisoquinoline (DHIQ), propidium iodide (PI), acridine orange (AO), 3-methyladenine (3-MA), and wortmannin (WM) were obtained from Sigma. CM-H2DCFDA was purchased from Molecular Probes (San Diego, CA). The green fluorescent protein (GFP)-LC3 expression vector was kindly provided by Dr. T. Yoshimori (National Institute for Basic Biology, Okazaki, Japan). Cell Culture and Treatments—The murine monocyte/macrophage cell line, RAW264.7, was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Resident peritoneal macrophages were obtained from mice by normal saline lavage. Mice received intraperitoneal injections of 3% thioglycollate 4 days before the preparation of peritoneal macrophages. Peritoneal macrophages were harvested by the lavage of the peritoneal cavity with 5 ml of normal saline. The stock solution of LPS was 100 μg/ml in PBS and the stock solution of Z-VAD was 50 mm in Me2SO. As the control of Z-VAD treatment, the same volume of Me2SO was added into cell cultural medium. The Z-VAD dose curves were done by diluting Z-VAD with Me2SO and added equal volume of Z-VAD solution into cell cultural medium. Cell Viability Assay—The integrity of the plasma membrane was assessed by determining the ability of cells to exclude PI. Cells were trypsinized, collected by centrifugation, washed once with PBS, and resuspended in PBS containing 1 μg/ml PI. The levels of PI incorporation were quantified by flow cytometry on a FACScan flow cytometer. Cell size was evaluated by forward-angle light scattering. PI-negative cells of normal size were considered to be live cells. MTT Assay—MTT assays were performed in a 96-well plate according to manufacturer's instruction (Sigma). Briefly, after treatment, MTT was added to each well at a final concentration of 250 μg/ml. After 1–2 h, the medium was removed, and the cells were dissolved in MTT solubilization solution (Sigma). Absorbance at 590 nm (A590) was determined for each well using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad). After subtracting the background absorbance, the A590 of the cells treated with drugs was divided by that of the untreated cells to obtain the percentage of viable cells. Transmission Electron Microscopy—Cells were grown in 35-mm Petri dishes, fixed for 30 min on ice in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.3) plus 1 mm CaCl2, and were washed in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer. After treatment with 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer for 1 h at room temperature, and further washing in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer, each sample was incubated in 0.5% tannic acid in 0.05 m cacodylate for 30 min, rinsed in 1% Na2SO4 in 0.1 m cacodylate for 10 min, and then rinsed in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer. The cells were dehydrated in 30% ethanol and en bloc stained in 1% uranyl acetate in 50% ethanol for 15 min, followed by further dehydration in 50%, 70%, 90%, and two changes of 100% ethanol. Because the cells were grown in regular plastic Petri dishes, they were then cleared in 2-hydroxypropylmethacrylate two times for 15 min each and were embedded in LX-112 (Ladd, Burlington, VT). After polymerization at 60% for 24 h, the plastic Petri dish was broken away, and the thin resin disk with cells was cut up into small pieces that were attached to blank blocks with Superglue. Thin sections were cut using a diamond knife, mounted on copper slot grids, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined on a Philips CM-100 electron microscope. Specific images were recorded photographically using Kodak SO-163 film. Immunocytochemistry—Immunostaining for PAR was performed on cells grown on glass cover slips and fixed in cold 4% paraformaldehyde and permeablized by 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature. Monoclonal antibodies for PAR were used at a 1:200 dilution. For detecting acidic compartments, treated cells were stained with 1 μg/ml AO for 5 min. Samples were examined under a fluorescence microscope. When GFP-LC3 was used as an autophagosome marker, RAW264.7 cells were transfected with the GFP-LC3 expression vector using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After overnight culture, cells were treated with various chemicals, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and examined under a fluorescence microscope. Detection of ROS Accumulation—Cells in 6-well plates were cultured in a phenol red-free medium and treated with LPS and/or Z-VAD for the indicated time periods. CM-H2DCFDA (20 μm) was added 30 min before collecting cells. The stained cells were analyzed with a flow cytometer, and the data were processed with the CellQuest program. Measurement of the Relative Value of Acidic Compartments— Cells in various stages were harvested and then incubated at 37 °C for 15 min with 1 μg/ml AO. Cells were then washed, pelleted, and resuspended in 1 ml of PBS for the measurement of fluorescence derived from the aggregated AO in acidic compartments. The healthy cells (with intact lysosomes) were gated, and the mean value of the fluorescence intensity was used as the relative value of acidic compartments. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were collected and lysed in a lysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 250 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, and 1 mm sodium vanadate). Fifty micrograms of the cell lysate from each sample were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. ECL was used in the detection process according to the manufacturer's instruction. Autophagy Is Involved in Macrophage Death Triggered by Co-stimulation of LPS and Z-VAD—Because LPS-activated macrophages undergo caspase-independent cell death in the presence of Z-VAD (14Kim H.S. Lee M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6821-6833Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 16Kim S.O. Ono K. Tobias P.S. Han J. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 1441-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we decided to determine whether autophagy plays a role in this death process. We first determined the dose of Z-VAD required for the death of LPS-treated macrophages. The viability of peritoneal macrophages from C57BL/6J mice or RAW264.7 cells was measured after the cells were treated with LPS (100 ng/ml) and different concentration of Z-VAD for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 1A, 10 μm Z-VAD is sufficient to cause maximal death of LPS-treated primary macrophages and 50 μm is required for that in RAW264.7 cells. Since we needed to use plasmid transfection in many of our experiments, and primary macrophages are very difficult to transfect, we used macrophage cell line RAW 264.7, which closely resembles the primary macrophages in regards to caspase-independent cell death (14Kim H.S. Lee M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6821-6833Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 16Kim S.O. Ono K. Tobias P.S. Han J. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 1441-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) except for its higher Z-VAD dose requirement. Fig. 1B shows the time course of LPS + Z-VAD-induced cell death in RAW264.7 cells measured by PI exclusion and MTT assay. To determine whether autophagy was induced in RAW264.7 macrophages, we first examined whether LPS + Z-VAD treatment increases the volume of the acidic compartments, which is one of the characteristics of autophagy. AO is an acidic probe and was used to stain acidic compartments in cells. Treatment with Z-VAD or LPS alone had no significant effect on the volume of the acidic compartments in RAW264.7 cells, while LPS + Z-VAD treatment increased AO staining (Fig. 1C). When AO intensity was used to compare the total volume of acidic compartments (VAC), we found a significant VAC increase in LPS + Z-VAD-treated cells by FACS analysis (Fig. 1D). The increase of VAC suggests that autophagy is induced in LPS + Z-VAD-treated RAW264.7 cells. Autophagy formation can be visualized with an electron microscope, which is by far the most confirmative analysis for autophagy. As shown in Fig. 1E, autophagy vacuoles were readily detected in LPS + Z-VAD-treated RAW264.7 cells. LC3, a mammalian homologue of Apg8p, is recruited to the autophagosome membrane during autophagy (40Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5510) Google Scholar). The GFP-tagged LC3 has been used as a marker for the induction of autophagy (40Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5510) Google Scholar). To evaluate the role of autophagy in LPS + Z-VAD-treated RAW264.7 cells, we transiently expressed GFP-LC3 and analyzed GFP-LC3-expressing cells before and after LPS + Z-VAD stimulation. Similar to previously reports which found that the induction of autophagy can be monitored by an increase of GFP-LC3-containing punctate structures (autophagic vacuoles) (40Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5510) Google Scholar), our treatment of LPS + Z-VAD resulted in increased punctate staining of GFP-LC3 in macrophages (Fig. 1F). The formation of autophagic bodies is supported by the observation that the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA inhibited the formation of these punctate stainings (Fig. 1F). To determine whether the autophagy seen in LPS + Z-VAD-treated macrophages is involved in cell death, we used 3-MA and WM to inhibit autophagy in LPS + Z-VAD-stimulated RAW264.7 cells and primary macrophages. As shown in Fig. 1, G and H, 3-MA and WM significantly reduced the cell death. Beclin-1, the mouse homologue of yeast ATG6, is a key autophagy gene. An siRNA knockdown of beclin-1 has been used to inhibit autophagic cell death (39Yu L. Alva A. Su H. Dutt P. Freundt E. Welsh S. Baehrecke E.H. Lenardo M.J. Science. 2004; 304: 1500-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). To confirm that autophagy indeed contributes to LPS + Z-VAD-induced macrophage death, we used siRNA to knockdown beclin-1 in RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 1I) and determine whether autophagy is required for LPS + Z-VAD-induced cell death. Reduction of beclin-1 (Fig. 1I) resulted in a resistance to LPS + Z-VAD-induced macrophage death in RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 1J). PARP Activation Is Involved in the Induction of Autophagy in LPS + Z-VAD-treated Macrophages—Since PARP activation is implicated to play a role in caspase-independent cell death (26Zong W.X. Ditsworth D. Bauer D.E. Wang Z.Q. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1272-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar– 28Ha H.C. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13978-13982Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar), we decided to investigate whether LPS + Z-VAD treatment could induce PARP activation by detecting PAR formation. We treated RAW264.7 cells with LPS, Z-VAD, or LPS + Z-VAD and then checked PARP activity. LPS or Z-VAD alone did not induce PAR formation, whereas LPS + Z-VAD caused a significant increase in PAR staining (Fig. 2A). The increase in PAR staining was PARP-dependent, since the PARP inhibitor DHIQ significantly inhibited the LPS + Z-VAD-induced formation of PAR (Fig. 2A). Because a small amount of PARP was cleaved by caspase-3 in LPS-treated macrophages (data not shown) (8Takada Y. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23390-23397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), it is possible that the overactivation of PARP in LPS + Z-VAD-treated macrophages is due to the inhibition of caspase-3 by Z-VAD. However, treatment of LPS-activated macrophages with caspase-3 inhibitor cannot cause PARP overactivation and cell death (data not shown) (16Kim S.O. Ono K. Tobias P.S. Han J. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 1441-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Therefore, PARP hyperactivation in LPS + Z-VAD-treated macrophages requires more than preventing PARP cleavage. To determine whether PARP activation is involved in LPS + Z-VAD-induced macrophage death, we used the PARP inhibitors DHIQ and DPQ to inhibit PARP activity in LPS + Z-VAD-stimulated cells. As shown in Fig. 2B, both DHIQ and DPQ reduced cell death in LPS + Z-VAD-treated RAW264.7 cells. Therefore, the activation of PARP contributes to LPS + Z-VAD-induced cell death. One of the consequences of PARP activation is intracellular ATP depletion, which could be related to autophagy induction by LPS + Z-VAD treatment. Therefore, we examined whether the inhibition of PARP had an effect on LPS + Z-VAD-induced autophagy. As shown in Fig. 2C, the inhibition of PARP reduced the translocation of GFP-LC3 to the autophagosome in LPS + Z-VAD-treated cells,"

Regulation of type I procollagen gene (COL1A2) transcription by TGF-β involves the canonical Smad signaling pathway as well as additional protein and lipid kinases, coactivators, and DNA-binding transcription factors that constitute alternate non-Smad pathways. By using Affymetrix microarrays to detect cellular genes whose expression is regulated by Smad3, we identified early growth response factor-1 (EGR-1) as a novel Smad3-inducible gene. Previous studies implicated Egr-1 in cell growth, differentiation, and survival. We found that TGF-β induced rapid and transient accumulation of Egr-1 protein and mRNA in human skin fibroblasts. In transient transfection assays, TGF-β stimulated the activity of the Egr-1 gene promoter, as well as that of a minimal Egr-1-responsive reporter construct. Furthermore, TGF-β enhanced endogenous Egr-1 interaction with a consensus Egr-1-binding site element and with GC-rich DNA sequences of the human COL1A2 promoter in vitro and in vivo. Forced expression of Egr-1 by itself caused dose-dependent up-regulation of COL1A2 promoter activity and further enhanced the stimulation induced by TGF-β. In contrast, the TGF-β response was abrogated when the Egr-1-binding sites of the COL1A2 promoter were mutated or deleted. Furthermore, Egr-1-deficient embryonic mouse fibroblasts showed attenuated TGF-β responses despite intact Smad activation, and forced expression of ectopic EGR-1 in these cells could restore COL1A2 stimulation in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, these findings identify Egr-1 as a novel intracellular TGF-β target that is necessary for maximal stimulation of collagen gene expression in fibroblasts. The results therefore implicate Egr-1 in the profibrotic responses elicited by TGF-β and suggest that Egr-1 may play a new and important role in the pathogenesis of fibrosis.

Tissue fibrosis, the pathological hallmark of scleroderma/systemic sclerosis, pulmonary fibrosis, glomerulosclerosis, and other chronic diseases, is a major determinant of morbidity and mortality (1Varga J. Phan S. Brenner D.A. Methods Mol. Med. 2005; 117: 1-7Google Scholar). Diverse fibrotic conditions are characterized by excessive synthesis and accumulation of collagen and other extracellular matrix (ECM) 2The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; Egr-1, early growth response factor-1; COL1A2, type I collagen α2 gene; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; IPTG, isopropyl β-thiogalactoside; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; EBS, Egr-1-binding site; MEF, murine embryonic fibroblast; BSA, bovine serum albumin; FBS, fetal bovine serum; hTERT, human telomerase reverse transcriptase; RT, reverse transcription; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assays; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; DAPA, DNA affinity precipitation assays; ALK, activin-like kinase; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. proteins in target organs, resulting in progressive disruption of their architecture. Currently, there are no effective therapies to arrest or reverse the process of fibrosis. Furthermore, despite its enormous clinical impact, the pathogenesis of fibrosis remains poorly understood. A major feature of all forms of fibrosis is fibroblast activation exemplified by the induction of genetic programs for ECM synthesis, resistance to apoptosis, up-regulation of cytokine receptor and adhesion molecule expression, and transformation into contractile myofibroblasts. The multifunctional cytokine transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is a key signal for regulation of connective tissue metabolism. TGF-β exerts potent stimulatory effects on collagen synthesis, ECM accumulation, fibroblast proliferation, and myofibroblast differentiation in vivo and in vitro and is implicated in normal wound healing on the one hand and in the pathogenesis of fibrosis on the other hand (2Mauviel A. Methods Mol. Med. 2005; 117: 69-80PubMed Google Scholar). Although the interaction of TGF-β with its cell surface receptors has been extensively investigated, the precise molecular events downstream from the activated receptors that mediate profibrotic responses elicited by TGF-β remain to be fully characterized. Signaling by TGF-β is initiated when a type II TGF-β receptor (TβRII) at the cell surface binds its ligand and phosphorylates the activin-like kinase 5 (ALK5) type I TGF-β receptor (3Shi Y. Massague J. Cell. 2003; 113: 685-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4836) Google Scholar). Activated ALK5 in turn phosphorylates cytoplasmic Smad2/3, promoting their heterodimerization with the common mediator Smad4 and rapid translocation into the nucleus. Within the nucleus, the Smad2/3/4 complex interacts directly with consensus Smad-binding elements (SBE) of target genes to activate their transcription (4ten Dijke P. Hill C.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 265-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). Nuclear coactivators such as p300/CBP interact with DNA-bound Smads to positively modulate TGF-β-induced transcriptional responses (5Roberts A.B. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2002; 13: 3-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Recent studies from our laboratory and others have revealed that Smad3 plays a pivotal role in mediating TGF-β-induced stimulation of collagen gene expression in normal fibroblasts (6Chen S.J. Yuan W. Mori Y. Levenson A. Trojanowska M. Varga J. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 49-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 7Vindevoghel L. Lechleider R.J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 39237-39245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Contrary to initial predictions that envisioned the Smad pathway as a relatively straightforward linear system for propagating TGF-β responses, intracellular TGF-β signaling is turning out to be a remarkably complex, dynamic, and context-dependent biological process. For example, recent studies indicate that in addition to the canonical Smad pathway, TGF-β also induces alternate signal transduction pathways in cell type-specific manner. Non-Smad signaling mediators shown to be activated by TGF-β in various cell types include protein and lipid kinases such as protein kinases A and C, c-Abl, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, the MAPKs, ERK, JNK, and p38, TAK1, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (reviewed in Ref. 10Feng X.H. Derynck R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 659-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar). Each appears to contribute to translating TGF-β signals into distinct biological responses in a cell type- and target gene-specific manner. These alternate signaling pathways may mediate TGF-β responses completely independent of Smads, or they may modulate the amplitude and duration of ligand-dependent Smad activation or engage with the Smad pathway through intracellular cross-talk. In turn, Smads can modulate the expression and activity of other signaling pathways or induce additional transcription factors. In light of these emerging observations indicating a high degree of complexity, a better understanding of the interactions of Smads with other signaling proteins, including those that may be downstream targets of Smads and contribute to TGF-β signaling, is of clear significance. To gain a more complete picture of intracellular signaling networks mediating TGF-β responses, we examined the expression profile of genes whose induction was rapidly up-regulated by Smad3 in human skin fibroblasts. We took advantage of a novel experimental strategy for tightly regulated Smad3 expression in transfected primary cells. The results indicated that the zinc finger transcription factor early response gene-1 (EGR-1), also known as KROX24, NGF1-A,or ZIF268, was rapidly induced by Smad3. Furthermore, TGF-β also induced Egr-1 expression in normal skin fibroblasts. The levels of Egr-1 protein and mRNA were rapidly and transiently up-regulated by TGF-β1 in vitro, and Egr-1 promoter activity was enhanced in transiently transfected fibroblasts. Ectopic Egr-1 expression by itself resulted in transactivation of COL1A2 and stimulation of type I collagen synthesis, whereas mutant Egr-1 blocked the response. Stimulation by TGF-β involved ligand-dependent interaction of cellular Egr-1 with cis-acting GC-rich DNA elements partially overlapping functional Sp1-binding sites within the proximal COL1A2 promoter and was attenuated in cells lacking Egr-1. The in vivo expression of Egr-1 in skin fibroblasts was markedly elevated by TGF-β injection in mice. Together, these results identify Egr-1 as a novel TGF-β/Smad3 target that up-regulates the expression of collagen genes and plays a critical role in mediating TGF-β stimulation. Therefore, Egr-1 appears to be a new and important component of the fibrotic process. Cell Cultures and Metabolic Labeling—Cultures of human dermal fibroblasts were established from neonatal foreskins by explant techniques described previously (11Yufit T. Vining V. Wang L. Brown R.R. Varga J. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1995; 105: 388-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Only early passage (<8) fibroblasts were studied. Egr-1-null murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) provided by J. Milbrandt (Washington University, St. Louis) were established from embryos of mice with targeted deletion of the Egr-1 gene (12Lee S.L. Sadovsky Y. Swirnoff A.H. Polish J.A. Goda P. Gavrilina G. Milbrandt J. Science. 1996; 273: 1219-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts and HepG2 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were routinely maintained in modified Eagle's medium or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% vitamins, antibiotics, and 2 mm l-glutamine and studied at early confluence. To determine the role of Egr-1 in regulation of collagen synthesis, wild-type and Egr-1-deficient MEFs were used in metabolic labeling experiments, as described previously (11Yufit T. Vining V. Wang L. Brown R.R. Varga J. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1995; 105: 388-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent wild-type and Egr-1-null MEFs in parallel were incubated in serum-free media supplemented with ascorbic acid (50 μg/ml) and β-aminoproprionitrile (100 μg/ml). Twenty four h later, TGF-β (12.5 ng/ml) and [14C]proline (2.5 μCi/ml) were added to the cultures, for the final 24 h. The media were removed and extensively dialyzed, and aliquots normalized for cell numbers were examined by SDS-PAGE. Enhanced gels were visualized by autoradiography, and protein levels were quantitated using Molecular Analyst Image densitometry software (Bio-Rad). Inducible Smad3 Expression in hTERT-derived Fibroblasts— To construct a tightly regulated inducible system for Smad3 expression, hTERT-BJ1 cells derived from human foreskin fibroblasts stably expressing the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (Clontech) were used. The cells were first transfected with the murine ecotropic receptor, which renders them susceptible to infection with retrovirus, and the modified bacterial lacI repressor, which allows for isopropyl β-thiogalactoside (IPTG)-inducible expression of promoters coupled with lac operator sequences (13Chang B.D. Roninson I.B. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 183: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The IPTG-inducible LNXCO3 expression construct contains the retroviral long terminal repeat and three lac operators in a β-galactoside regulated promoter. Full-length Smad3 cDNA was generated by PCR (primers 5′-GTAAGATCTCAGCCATGTCGTCCATCCT-3′ and 5′-ATAGCGGCCGCGTCTCTAAGACACACTG-3′), and the coding sequence was digested with NotI and HpaI and cloned into LNXCO3 to yield Smad3-LNXCO3. Upon addition of IPTG, the repressor is removed, and the expression of the insert is induced. Insert-free LNXCO3 vector was used for control infections. Smad3-LNXCO3 and LNXCO3 plasmids were used for retroviral transduction of BOSC23 ecotropic virus packaging cell line. Supernatant were used to infect hTERT-BJ1-LSR1 subline fibroblasts. Smad3-LNXCO3 and LNXCO3-transduced fibroblast populations were then selected with G418 (600 μg/ml). cDNA Array Hybridization and Gene Expression Analysis— At confluence, transduced hTERT-BJ1 fibroblasts were placed in serum-free media with 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 24 h and then exposed to 100 μm IPTG (Invitrogen) for 4 h. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Agarose gel electrophoresis was performed to monitor the quality of mRNA. Carefully examined aliquots in triplicate were used for preparation of probes and hybridization to HG-U133A GeneChip Human Genome Arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA), representing ∼11,000 human genes, according to protocols supplied by Affymetrix. GeneChip arrays were scanned by confocal scanner, and data were processed using software supplied by Affymetrix. A 2-fold difference in hybridization intensity was used as a cutoff threshold for genes up-regulated in IPTG-treated fibroblasts. RT-PCR and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from confluent fibroblasts using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and integrity of RNA was determined by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. For RT-PCR, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed to first strand cDNA using avian myeloblastosis virus-reverse transcriptase system (Promega, Madison, WI) and subjected to PCR amplification with the following primers: human Egr-1 forward, 5′-GACAGCAACCTTTTCTCCCAGG-3′, and reverse, 5′-GTTAGGTCCTCACTTGGGGGAA-3′, yielding a 545-bp fragment; and actin forward, 5′-ATCTGGCACCACACCTTCTACAATGAGCTGCG-3′, and reverse, 5′-CGTCATACTCCTGCTTGCTGATCCACATCTGC-3′, yielding an 833-bp fragment. Egr-1 and actin were amplified together; the PCR products were separated by electrophoresis in 1.5% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide, and bands were visualized using Kodak imaging system. For Northern analysis, RNA was prepared and examined as described (6Chen S.J. Yuan W. Mori Y. Levenson A. Trojanowska M. Varga J. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 49-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), using [α-32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA probes for human Egr-1, COL1A2, 18 S, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and mouse COL1A1. Following extensive washing of the nitrocellulose membranes, cDNA-mRNA hybrids were visualized by autoradiography on Kodak BioMax film. Signal intensities were quantitated by densitometry, and results were normalized with the RNA levels for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase or 18 S in each sample. Western Blot Analysis—Equal amounts of protein (20-50 μg) were subjected to electrophoresis in 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA), and immunoblotted with primary antibodies specific for Egr-1 (C-19), vimentin (V-9), Smad4, or β-actin (C-2) (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), Smad3 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), phospho-Smad2/3 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), phospho-serine/threonine/tyrosine (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), or type I collagen (Southern Biotechnology, Birmingham, AL). Blots were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h, and proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Confocal Microscopy—The expression and subcellular localization of native Smad3 and Egr-1 was studied by immunocytochemistry, as described (14Mori Y. Chen S.J. Varga J. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 258: 374-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, fibroblasts (10,000 cells/well) were seeded into 8-well Lab-Tek II chamber glass slides (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL). Following incubation in serum-free media with IPTG (100 μm) or TGF-β1 (1 ng/ml), the cells were fixed with 100% methanol, washed, and incubated with DAPI for nucleus or 10 μg/ml primary antibodies to Smad3 or Egr-1 or IgG as control, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cells were stained according to the manufacturer's protocol (Tyramide Signal Amplification; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and fluorescence intensity and subcellular localization were examined by laser scanning confocal microscopy using a Zeiss LSM510 microscope. The data were analyzed using Release 3.2 Zeiss LSM software and plotted as two-dimensional scatterplots to determine Pearson's correlation coefficient, with -1.0 representing negative correlation, 0 no correlation, and 1.0 complete correlation. Transient Transfection Assays—Several reporter constructs were used in transient transfection assays. Constructs harboring the truncated COL1A2 promoter with 5′ ends at -772, -353, and -108 bp fused to chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) were described previously (15Ihn H. Ohnishi K. Tamaki T. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26717-26723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and involved substitution mutations to modify the Egr-1-binding site (EBS) sequences of the -772COL1A2 promoter. Sequencing confirmed that each construct was correct. The minimal Egr-1-responsive promoter plasmid pEBS14-luc containing four binding sites for Egr-1 was provided by G. Thiel (University of Saarland, Germany) (16Thiel G. Kaufmann K. Magin A. Lietz M. Bach K. Cramer M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1493: 289-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The pEgr-1-luc construct containing 1.2 kb of the Egr-1 promoter was provided by E. Adamson (Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA). Cells at early confluence were transfected with the reporter constructs along with the Egr-1 expression vector pCMV-Egr-1 or pCMV-Egr-1Δmt (lacking the first and part of the second zinc fingers) provided by M. Goldring (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston) using calcium phosphate or SuperFect Transfection kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as described (6Chen S.J. Yuan W. Mori Y. Levenson A. Trojanowska M. Varga J. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 49-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were incubated in serum-free media containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 24 h, followed by various concentrations of TGF-β1 for another 24 h. At the end of the incubations, cells were harvested, and the cell lysates, normalized for protein concentrations, were assayed for CAT activities, as described (6Chen S.J. Yuan W. Mori Y. Levenson A. Trojanowska M. Varga J. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 49-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Luciferase activities were assayed using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). In some experiments, a construct containing the Renilla luciferase pRL-TK (Promega) was cotransfected along with the reporter constructs and used as control for transfection efficiency. Transient transfection experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated at least twice. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were performed as described previously (6Chen S.J. Yuan W. Mori Y. Levenson A. Trojanowska M. Varga J. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 49-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent cultures of serum-starved fibroblasts were incubated with TGF-β1 (12.5 ng/ml) for the indicated periods, and nuclear extracts were prepared. Double-stranded synthetic DNA oligonucleotides (IDX Technologies, Coralville, IA) were end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP and incubated with nuclear extracts (5 μg) for 30 min. Radiolabeled oligonucleotides corresponding to COL1A2 promoter sequences spanning -147 to -118 bp (EBS1) and -310 to -285 bp (EBS2) were used as probes, along with oligonucleotides containing consensus and mutant Egr-1 and Sp1 sequences (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). To establish the specificity of transcription factor binding to the DNA probes, competition experiments using 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides were performed. For supershift experiments, antibodies specific for Egr-1 or Sp1, Sp3, and preimmune IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added to nuclear extracts in binding reaction mixture at 4 °C for 60 min before addition of radiolabeled oligonucleotide probes and electrophoresis. All experiments were repeated at least three times. DNA Affinity Precipitation Assays (DAPA)—DAPA was performed essentially as described (17Cesi V. Giuffrida M.L. Vitali R. Tanno B. Mancini C. Calabretta B. Raschella G. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 305: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclear extracts isolated from skin fibroblasts exposed to TGF-β for 60 min or 4 h were incubated with custom-synthesized (Sigma Genosys, Woodlands, TX) biotin 5′-end-labeled and double-stranded oligonucleotides (4 μg) corresponding to COL1A2 promoter sequences spanning -310 to -285 bp. Poly(dI/dC) (8 μg) served as negative control. Following incubation in DAPA binding buffer (60 mm KCl, 12 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 4 mm Tris-HCl, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) for 3 h at 4 °C, and then with streptavidin-agarose (Pierce) overnight in the presence of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma), DNA-protein complexes were precipitated with agarose beads, resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE, and detected by Western analysis using indicated antibodies. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed using the ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, skin fibroblasts were incubated in the presence or absence of TGF-β1 (12.5 ng/ml) for 60 min and harvested. Formaldehyde was added to the cultures (final concentration 1%) to cross-link chromatin. Cell lysates were then prepared and sonicated on ice to break chromatin DNA to an average length of ∼500 bp. Aliquots of lysates containing 100-200 μg of protein were used for immunoprecipitation of Egr-1-chromatin complexes with antibodies (5 μg) to Egr-1 (588), Sp1 (C-59), and Sp3 (D-20) (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or normal rabbit IgG. DNA was recovered, and PCR amplification of the captured sequences was performed using primers complementary to the COL1A2 promoter region harboring both putative Egr-1-binding sites. The primer sequences were sense primer, 5′-CTACAGGGCACAGGTGAGG-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-AAAGCCCGGATCTGCCCTA-3′, to generate a 422-bp amplification product. DNA samples were analyzed by electrophoresis in 2% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide. Egr-1 Expression in Vivo—Six-week-old female C3H mice (Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY) weighing 20-25 g received a subcutaneous injection of TGF-β1 (250 ng) or phosphate-buffered saline into the shaved back. Twenty four h later, mice (three per group) were euthanized, and the injected skin was removed and processed for histological examination (18Takagawa S. Lakos G. Mori Y. Yamamoto T. Nishioka K. Varga J. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2003; 121: 41-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) or immunohistochemical analysis (19Lakos G. Takagawa S. Chen S.J. Ferreira A.M.

Sections were incubated with antibodies to Egr-1 (C-19) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a final dilution of 1:50. Substitution of the primary antibody with irrelevant IgG and preincubation of primary antibody with blocking peptide served as negative controls. Staining was repeated for each sample at least three times. Fibroblasts were identified based upon their characteristic spindle-shaped morphology. A minimum of 30 cells in several microscopic fields in each slide at ×400 magnification was scored as positive or negative for Egr-1 by three independent examiners blinded to the treatment. The ratio of positive cells/total number of cells was calculated. Mice were cared for in compliance with the principles of the National Institutes of Health/Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care, and with the approval of the animal care review committee of the University of Illinois. Statistical Analysis—Experiments were repeated at least three times with consistent results. Statistical significance was determined using the unpaired Student's t test. Values of p ≤ 0.05 were considered to be significant. Identification and Validation of EGR-1 as a Novel SMAD3 Target Gene in Fibroblasts—To identify cellular genes whose expression is directly induced by Smad3 in normal fibroblasts, we established a novel system for tightly regulated Smad3 expression. For this purpose, an IPTG-inducible retroviral vector containing SMAD3 or insertless vector was used in parallel to stably transfect human fibroblasts immortalized with telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT). Under routine culture conditions, hTERT fibroblasts maintained normal skin fibroblast characteristics, including spindle-shaped morphology, TGF-β induction of α-smooth muscle actin expression, and synthesis of type I collagen, for up to 80 serial passages in vitro (data not shown), and have an infinite life span (20Bodnar A.G. Ouellette M. Frolkis M. Holt S.E. Chiu C.P. Morin G.B. Harley C.B. Shay J.W. Lichtsteiner S. Wright W.E. Science. 1998; 279: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (4116) Google Scholar). The hTERT-BJ1-LNXCO-Smad3 subline is a derivative of hTERT fibroblasts where Smad3 expression can be turned on using the physiologically neutral agent IPTG. Nontransfected hTERT fibroblasts, as well as hTERT fibroblasts transfected with Smad3 or empty vector, displayed detectable levels of native Smad3 (Fig. 1A). However, exposure of hTERT-BJ1-LNXCO3-Smad3 fibroblasts to IPTG resulted in substantial and specific induction of Smad3, detectable as early as 4 h (data not shown) and showing time-dependent accumulation with maximal 5-fold increase in Smad3 levels at 24 h (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, increased Smad3 accumulation in IPTG-induced fibroblasts was associated with its phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation, whereas no Smad3 activation could be demonstrated in hTERT fibroblasts transfected with empty vector (Fig. 1, A and B). In contrast to Smad3, the levels of endogenous Smad4 in Smad3-transfected fibroblasts were not modulated by IPTG, thus serving as a useful additional control. Next, total RNA was isolated from Smad3- or insertless vector-transfected hTERT fibroblasts incubated with IPTG for 4 h, a time point chosen because preliminary experiments established it as the earliest point when Smad3 protein accumulation became evident, and subjected to analysis using Affymetrix U133A GeneChip Arrays. Global gene expression patterns are shown in Fig. 1C. The results identified several genes whose expression was induced ≥2-fold in Smad3-expressing hTERT fibroblasts at this early time point. Genes showing early up-regulation by Smad3 included EGR-1, calreticulin, RAB14, MIF, and S"

During this process, epithelium-derived tumor cells undergo fibroblast-like transformation, referred to as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which contributes to aggressive behavior of tumors. We identify periostin, a mesenchyme-specific gene product, as a contributor to EMT and metastatic potential. Stable expression of a periostin transgene in tumorigenic but non-metastatic 293T cells caused cells to undergo fibroblast-like transformation accompanied by increased expressions of vimentin, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and matrix metalloproteinase-9. The cells expressing ectopic periostin increased cell migration, invasion, and adhesion by 2-9-fold. Invasive characteristics required signaling through integrin αvβ5 and EGFR. In addition, periostin-engineered 293T cells formed metastases in immunodeficient mice following either cardiac inoculation or injection into mammary fat pad. These data demonstrate an active role for periostin in EMT and metastasis that requires cross-talk between integrin and EGFR signaling pathways.

These data demonstrate an active role for periostin in EMT and metastasis that requires cross-talk between integrin and EGFR signaling pathways. Progression of a solid tumor to an invasive tumor is a major prerequisite for metastasis and involves changes in both cell morphology and motility (1Friedl P. Wolf K. Nat. Rev.

Although genetic alterations in cancerous cells may vary in different types of metastatic cancers, they share the outcome that cancerous cells are disseminated to multiple distant organs (3Chambers A.F.

Typically, these aggressive cells detach from the site of origin, move across tissue boundaries to penetrate into lymphatic and blood vessels, and eventually extravasate from these vessels and colonize new sites. Phenotypic conversion of tumor cells from epithelial to mesenchymal phenotype, termed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), 2The abbreviations used are: EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal transition; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; siRNA, short interference RNA; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, EGF receptor. 2The abbreviations used are: EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal transition; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; siRNA, short interference RNA; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, EGF receptor. is commonly associated with acquisition of metastatic potential (5Boyer B.

Birchmeier W. Brand-Saberi B. Acta Anat. 1996; 156: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). During this transition, tumor cells usually lose epithelial features, including apical-basal polarity, expression on cytokeratin filaments, and membrane-associated adherens or desmosomes junctions. Concurrently, they gain mesenchymal properties, including expression of vimentin filaments, spindle-like morphology, and increased motility allowing cells to invade new sites (8Putz E. Witter K.

The molecular basis underlying the EMT process involves multiple changes in expression, distribution, and/or function of proteins that include vimentin, integrins, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), and cadherins (6Savagner P.

Acquired expression of vimentin by carcinoma cells, which replaces the cytoskeleton network, often symbolizes mesenchyme-like cell transformation (6Savagner P.

Loss of E-cadherin or gain of N-cadherin on tumor cell surface is frequently observed in malignant carcinomas and also correlated with enhanced aggressiveness and dedifferentiation (14Hazan R.B. Phillips G.R. Qiao R.F. Norton L. Aaronson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 779-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Elevated MMP-9 expression and activity allow tumor cells to degrade and penetrate extracellular matrix (15Lakka S.S. Gondi C.S. Yanamandra N. Olivero W.C. Dinh D.H. Gujrati M. Rao J.S. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 4681-4689Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 16Kupferman M.E. Fini M.E. Muller W.J. Weber R. Cheng Y. Muschel R.J. Am. J.

Integrins, heterodimeric transmembrane receptor complexes, interact with specific regions of extracellular matrix protein and transmit “outside-in” signals to the cells, leading to an array of intracellular signaling events participating in cell proliferation, adhesion, and motility. For example, increased expression of integrin αvβ3 in solid tumor and melanomas was correlated with tumor malignancy, and its function was found to enhance tumor cell growth and invasion (17Hood J.D. Bednarski M. Frausto R. Guccione S. Reisfeld R.A. Xiang R. Cheresh D.A. Science. 2002; 296: 2404-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar, 18Brooks P.C. Montgomery A.M. Rosenfeld M. Reisfeld R.A. Hu T. Klier G. Cheresh D.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 1157-1164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar). Likewise, the increased activity of integrin αvβ5 enhanced motility of ovarian cancer cells (19Hood J.D. Cheresh D.A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1476) Google Scholar, 20Mizejewski G.J. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1999; 222: 124-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Because integrins perform important functions in tumor progression, intensive research efforts have focused on the cross-talk between integrins and membrane tyrosine kinase receptors (21Eliceiri B.P. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 1104-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 22Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 23Bill H.M. Knudsen B.

Growth factors that activate receptor tyrosine kinases can alter integrin-mediated activities such as cell adhesion, spreading, and migration via alterations in integrin activation and localization. For instance, breast cancer cells expressing integrin αvβ5 depend on insulin-like growth factor stimulation for integrin αvβ5-mediated cell migration (24Doerr M.E. Jones J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2443-2447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Conversely, signals from integrins regulate full activation of growth factor signaling. EGFR is activated and required to cooperate with integrin αvβ5 for vitronectin-induced carcinoma cell migration (25Klemke R.L. Yebra M. Bayna E.M. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The selective coordination of inputs from different growth factor receptors and integrins largely depends on the cell types that inherently express distinct membrane receptors. Integrins also play important roles in the activation of endothelial cells as well as tumor cells (26Senger D.R. Ledbetter S.R. Claffey K.P. Papadopoulos-Sergiou A. Peruzzi C.A. Detmar M. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 149: 293-305PubMed Google Scholar, 27Soldi R. Mitola S. Strasly M. Defilippi P. Tarone G. Bussolino F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 882-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Engagement of activated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 2 (Flk-1/KDR) with integrin αvβ3 in endothelial cells is required for cell migration and adhesion in response to VEGF, whereas integrin αvβ5 is required for cancer cell adhesion and motility (20Mizejewski G.J. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1999; 222: 124-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 28Varner J.A. Cheresh D.A. Curr. Opin.

Cancer. 1997; 71: 320-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Therefore, the convergence and cascades of signaling from integrins and tyrosine kinase receptors appear to be essential in both endothelial cells and tumor cells for the induction of tumor angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis. The secretory protein periostin, a mesenchyme-specific gene, is normally expressed in osteoblasts. Gillan et al. (30Gillan L. Matei D. Fishman D.A. Gerbin C.S. Karlan B.Y. Chang D.D. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5358-5364PubMed Google Scholar) have found that periostin promotes adhesion and potentiates cancer cell motility through binding to integrins αvβ3 and αvβ5. More importantly, clinical studies of periostin expression in human cancers have demonstrated that increased expression of periostin is correlated with tumor angiogenesis and metastasis (31Shao R. Bao S. Bai X. Blanchette C. Anderson R.M. Dang T. Gishizky M.L. Marks J.R. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3992-4003Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 32Sasaki H. Dai M. Auclair D.

Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2003; 77: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that periostin acquired by tumorigenic cells may facilitate EMT and induce metastatic behavior. In our studies the epithelium-derived, tumorigenic 293T cells were used to determine the effects of periostin both in vitro and in vivo. We found that 293T cells overproducing periostin induced EMT and metastasis and that EMT required the coordination of integrin αvβ5 and EGFR signals. Generation of Periostin-producing Cells—Full-length human periostin cDNA (MluI-XhoI) was subcloned into a retroviral pCMV-neo-vector. 293T retroviral packaging cells were transfected with the periostin construct or vector control in the presence of pCL 10A1 vector using FuGENE 6 as the delivery vehicle. 48 h after transfection, the supernatant was harvested and filtered through a 0.45-μm pore size filter, and the virus-containing medium was used to infect parental 293T cells. Selection with 800 μg/ml of G418 was started 48 h after infection, and the drug-resistant cell populations were used for subsequent studies. Periostin siRNA Gene Knock Down—Specific oligos (21 bp) targeting the periostin gene were selected, and an oligo template (64 oligo nucleotides) containing the 21-bp oligos was subcloned into a retroviral pSUPER-puro-vector. Retroviral medium was generated as described above, and consequently the medium infected 293T cells expressing periostin to establish a stable line containing periostin siRNA. Gelatin Zymography—Cell-conditioned serum-free medium was collected for zymographic analysis. Gelatinolytic activities were assessed under non-reducing conditions using a 6% SDSpolyacrylamide gel with 1 mg/ml of gelatin. After being washed with 2.5% Triton X-100 twice for 30 min, the gel was incubated in zymography buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2,50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, for overnight at 37 °C. The gel was then stained with 0.2% Coomassie Brilliant Blue for 4 h and destained with ethanol/acetic acid/water for 2 h. Recombinant Periostin—Periostin was isolated and purified from baculoviral system as described previously (31Shao R. Bao S. Bai X. Blanchette C. Anderson R.M. Dang T. Gishizky M.L. Marks J.R. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3992-4003Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Migration Assay—Cells (2 × 105) were preincubated with serum-free medium for 24 h and transferred onto transwells (24-well plates) precoated with fibronectin (50 μg/ml). The lower chamber of transwells included EGF, periostin, tyrphostin 25, or anti-integrin αvβ3, αvβ5 antibody. After 4 h of incubation, top cells on the transwell membrane were removed using Q-tips. The cells trapped by membrane were fixed and stained with hematoxylin. Average cell numbers from five different areas in each example were counted. Invasion Assay—Cells (2 × 105) were preincubated with serum-free medium for 24 h and transferred onto transwells (24-well plates) preloaded with 50 μl of matrigel (1 μg/ml). After 18 h of incubation, the gel including non-migrated cells was removed and cells invading into the membrane were fixed and stained. Adhesion Assay—Cells (5 × 0104) were preincubated with serum-free medium for 24 h and transferred to 48-well plates precoated with periostin or vitronectin (10 μg/ml). After 1 h of incubation, cells were gently washed and attached cells were fixed, stained, and counted. Immunocytochemistry—Cells were transferred onto glass slides to culture for 2 days. After being fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, cells were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% goat serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40 followed by incubation with anti-vimentin antibody for 1 h. Fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody was then added for 1 h, and fluorescence was examined under a microscope. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot—Cells were lysed with lysis buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.25 mm HEPES, 14.9 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 2mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μm pepstatin A, and 20 μm leupeptin. The lysates were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min, and the resulting supernatant was collected for immunoblotting. For immunoprecipitation, cells from 60-mm plates were lysed with 0.5 ml of cell lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaF, 0.2 mm Na3VO4,1mm EDTA, 1mm EGTA, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The samples were incubated with anti-integrin β3 or β5 antibody at 4 °C for overnight followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 2 h. The immunocomplex was extensively washed, and the samples (30 μg) were subjected to immunoblotting. The primary antibodies against vimentin, actin, cytokeratin (Sigma), PY-20 (ICN, Aurora, OH), EGFR, Tyr1068 EGFR (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), MMP-2, MMP-9 (Oncogene, Boston, MA), and integrins αv, β3, β5, αvβ3, and αvβ5 (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) were used to examine protein expression. Specific signals were detected using an ECL kit (Pierce). Induction of Tumor Xenografts and Metastasis in Mice—4-week-old female SCID-Beige/NOD mice (Charles River, Wilmington, MA) were injected at mammary fat pad tissue with control or periostin-producing 293T cells (1 × 107) in 0.2 ml of Hanks' balanced buffer without calcium and magnesium. The growth of solid tumors from the injected cells was monitored daily for up to 50 days when animals became moribund. The tumors were measured and calculated as follows: volume = length × width2 × 0.52. The removed lung and liver were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Tissue sections were cut to 6-10-μm thickness and stained with hematoxylin and eosin by a standard method. For cardiac inoculation, cell suspension (2 × 106 cells/0.15 ml) in phosphate-buffered saline was injected into the left ventricle of pentobarbiturate-anesthetized mice. Mice were monitored daily for up to 90 days. Necropsies were performed to examine tumor formation throughout the body. We employed tumorigenic 293T cells, a typical non-metastatic, epithelium-derived tumor line, to investigate the effects of periostin on metastasis. First, we tested whether periostin is capable of promoting EMT, a process tightly associated with cell malignant behavior. We used a retroviral infection system to introduce the periostin cDNA into 293T cells and to stably produce secreted periostin. Transduction of periostin gene resulted in extensive cell spreading and elongation, displaying a spindle-like morphology, whereas this alteration was not observed in control cells (Fig. 1A, top panel). 293T cells ectopically expressing periostin dramatically increased vimentin expression, a hallmark for mesenchymal cells, by 7-8-fold (Fig. 1, A and B). The level of vimentin in vector control cells and parental 293T cells was barely detectable. The elevation of vimentin expression was validated by immunocytochemistry staining. Fibronectin expression was also induced by the periostin transgene in the cells. Expression of the epithelial marker cytokeratin was not significantly altered in periostin-producing 293T cells. The active form of MMP-9 was strikingly increased in periostin-producing cells and accumulated in the medium ∼5-8-fold higher than the level produced from control cells, accompanied by high proteolytic activity in the cells engineered with periostin (Fig. 1C). In contrast, neither the active form of MMP-2 (Fig. 1B) nor MMP-3 (not shown) was changed in the conditioned medium. Expression of E- or N-cadherin was also unaltered (data not shown). In aggregate, the data demonstrate that periostin expressed by 293T cells drives the cells to undergo EMT. To explore membrane receptors that may mediate periostininduced cell EMT, we characterized its interaction with integrins on the cell surface. As periostin was shown to be a ligand of integrins αvβ3 and αvβ5 on ovarian cancer cells (30Gillan L. Matei D. Fishman D.A. Gerbin C.S. Karlan B.Y. Chang D.D. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5358-5364PubMed Google Scholar), its interactions with integrins on 293T cells were examined (Fig. 2). Periostin-coated plates enhanced cell adhesion by 3.5-fold compared with controls. This interaction was abolished by incubation with anti-integrin αvβ5 antibody. This effect was specific for integrin αvβ5, as anti-integrin αvβ3 antibody failed to block periostin-induced cell adhesion. 293T cells predominantly expressed subunits integrin αv and β5, but not β3, implicating that a heterodimer is mainly composed of the integrin αvβ5 form in the cells (Fig. 3A). A similar expression pattern was observed in both control cells and periostin-expressing cells. To determine whether the cross-talk between integrins and growth factor receptors is required for periostin activity, we first examined EGFR expression in 293T cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, EGFR expression was augmented in the cells expressing periostin ∼2-fold higher than that in control. We examined the physical interaction between integrins and EGFR by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting after the cells were exposed to EGF. Following stimulation of the cells with EGF, integrin β5-associated proteins were co-immunoprecipitated. EGFR was associated with integrin β5 in the periostin-expressing cells but not the cells with vector alone (Fig. 3B). Activated EGFR was examined by immunoblotting with an antibody against tyrosine-phosphorylated molecules. Once cells were exposed to EGF, tyrosine-phosphorylated EGFR was detected in integrin β5-associated complex from periostin-engineered 293T cells but not control cells (Fig. 3C). No tyrosine-phosphorylated EGFR was observed in integrin β3-associated complex from either control or periostin-engineered cells. This specific association between integrin β5 and activated EGFR was inhibited by the preincubation of periostinproducing cells with anti-integrin αvβ5 antibody or tyrphostin 25, an EGFR kinase inhibitor (Fig. 3C). The specific interaction was also confirmed by the reciprocal immunoprecipitation and immunoblot. There was no detectable interaction between EGFR and integrin β3, whereas phosphorylated EGFR showed the association with integrin β5 (Fig. 3D). The data suggest that integrin αvβ5 and EGFR form a complex but require both periostin and EGF as ligands. Next, to test whether periostin expression can induce aggressive activities in the absence of exogenous EGF, we monitored functional alterations in cell migration and invasion. 293T cells expressing periostin exhibited a significant increase in cell motility (Fig. 4A). More than two times as many periostin-producing cells migrated into the membrane relative to control cells. When either anti-integrin αvβ5 antibody or tyrphostin 25 was added, the increased motility in periostin-producing cells was blocked, whereas treatment with anti-integrin αvβ3 antibody failed to inhibit the cell migration. We also monitored cell invasive behavior using a modified migration assay in which a layer of matrigel was preloaded on transwells. As shown in Fig. 4A, ectopic expression of periostin in the cells resulted in a 9-fold increase in cell invasive activity relative to the control cells. Treatment of these aggressive cells with either anti-integrin αvβ5 antibody or tyrphostin 25 substantially impaired cell invasion as the activity was reduced to the basal level. As expected, inclusion of anti-integrin αvβ3 antibody did not block invasion. Likewise, periostin enhanced cell adhesive activity, but it was abrogated by anti-integrin αvβ5 antibody or tyrphostin 25 (data not shown). To determine the regulation of intracellular molecules that may play an important role in cell aggressive behavior, we examined MMP-9 gene expression. Consistent with the previous result, periostin-expressing cells contained a higher level of MMP-9 than in control cells. However, the increased MMP-9 level in periostin-producing 293T cells was fully inhibited to the control level by an addition of either anti-integrin αvβ5 antibody or tyrphostin 25, whereas blockage of integrin αvβ3 failed to attenuate MMP-9 production (Fig. 4B). The data suggest that co-activation of integrin αvβ5 and EGFR is required for periostin-induced MMP-9 production and cell invasive function. The effectiveness of inhibition by anti-integrin αvβ5 antibody on periostin-induced cell functions demonstrates that periostin produced from the cells acts through its secreted protein that interacts with integrin αvβ5 but not via intracellular pro-periostin. The in vitro data that periostin induces EMT and invasive activity encouraged us to test whether periostin promotes tumor invasion and metastasis in vivo. For this, we injected control and periostin-producing 293T cells into mouse mammary fat pad tissue and monitored growth of tumors at the injection site as well as in distant organs. The mice receiving periostin-producing 293T cells grew local tumors significantly faster than did the mice receiving control cells during the 35-day observation (Fig. 5A). During the next 2 weeks, the mice injected with periostin-producing cells began to die, resulting in a rapid decrease in survival rate. But no death occurred in the control group within the same time period of observation (Fig. 5B). Strikingly, we found that the tumors bearing periostinproducing cells metastasized to the lung and liver (Fig. 5C and Table 1), in which the rate of tumor formation was 83 and 17%, respectively. No tumor metastasis was identified in either organ in mice injected with control cells. New blood vessels adjacent to the tumors developed in some lung metastatic cases, indicating that periostin promotes tumor angiogenesis in the secondary solid tumor formation during metastasis. To confirm that periostin has ability to promote tumor cell invasion and metastasis, we utilized the siRNA gene knockdown approach in periostin-expressing 293T cells. As shown in Fig. 5D, the periostin gene in siRNA cells was suppressed to ∼30% of the level in periostin-producing cells. This decreased expression of periostin was sufficient to abrogate cell invasion in vitro and metastasis in vivo (Fig. 5D and Table 1), although the local tumor growth was similar between the siRNA vector control and periostin siRNA tumor (data not shown).TABLE 1Administration of periostin-producing 293T cells in the mammary fat pad tissue results in lung and liver tumor formation, but periostin gene knock down inhibits metastasisnMetastatic organsLungRateLiverRateControl600/6 (0%)00/6 (0%)Periostin655/6 (83%)11/6 (17%)siRNA control544/5 (80%)00/5 (0%)siRNA500/5 (0%)00 (0%) Open table in a new tab To further evaluate the metastatic activity, we injected control or periostin-producing 293T cells directly into the blood system via left ventricle inoculation. In agreement with the above results, the survival rate in the mice bearing periostin-producing cells was significantly lower than that of the mice carrying control cells (Fig. 6A). A variety of visible large secondary tumors in the liver, lung, and abdomen were identified in two of six mice receiving periostin-producing cells (Fig. 6B). Moreover, an extensive arbor of ramified blood vessels was also found in those tumors, consistent with enhanced tumor angiogenesis. No tumors were detected in organs from the control mice. The data strengthen our hypothesis that expression of periostin by tumor cells prompts tumor invasion and metastasis. A wealth of evidence has demonstrated that tumors of epithelial origin usually undergo phenotypic transformation during tumor metastasis (34Thiery J.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 442-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (5469) Google Scholar, 35Thompson E.W. Newgreen D.F. Tarin D. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 5991-5995Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). A variety of classic molecules involved in cell motility, cell-cell contacts, and cell-extracellular matrix interaction have been well characterized in metastasis such as vimentin, E/N-cadherin expression, and MMP production. In addition, a number of growth factors including TGF-β, FGF1, EGF, and SF/HGF can induce tumor cell EMT process under culture conditions (36Thiery J.P. Chopin D. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1999; 18: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have observed the direct effects of periostin on aggressive cell behavior by expressing periostin in 293T cells. We found that exogenous expression of periostin in 293T cells promoted the cells to undergo EMT. They gained vimentin expression, a hallmark of EMT, and transformed to fibroblast-like phenotype including spreading of cells accompanied with increased MMP-9 production. Consequently, these cells increased cell adhesion, migration, and invasion in vitro and metastatic potential in vivo. Cadherins, the cell-cell adhesion molecules, have been shown to exert important functions in the regulation of cell-cell communication. E-cadherin usually maintains epithelial properties, whereas N-cadherin mainly contributes to the mesenchymal transformation. In addition, recent evidence has demonstrated that N-cadherin up-regulates MMP-9 expression in tumor progression (37Hazan R.B. Qiao R. Keren R. Badano I. Suyama K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1014: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 38Suyama K. Shapiro I. Guttman M. Hazan R.B.

Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1436-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Thus, either gain of N-cadherin or loss of E-cadherin expression is frequently associated with tumor metastasis (14Hazan R.B. Phillips G.R. Qiao R.F. Norton L. Aaronson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 779-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 40Christofori G. Semb H. Trends Biochem.

In the present study, no alteration was detected in either E-cadherin or N-cadherin expression after introduction of periostin into the cells. Although it is possible that N- and E-cadherin may participate in the actions of periostin, they were not rate-limiting for the responses in gene expression, migration, or invasion. Given that periostin directly interacts with integrin αvβ5 and the activation of basal EGFR level is necessary for aggressiveness in response to periostin, we have revealed a model of the cross-talk for periostin that requires coordination of integrin αvβ5 and EGFR pathways. Periostin induced features of metastasis including cell adhesion, migration, and invasion. Tyrosine-phosphorylated EGFR was found to physically associate with integrin αvβ5 exclusively in the cells when they were exposed to both receptor stimuli, suggesting that signal transduction is enhanced once both receptor ligands are present. The cytoplasmic tail of integrin β subunit participates in the physical association with the cytoplasmic domain of growth factor receptors favoring the coordination of both membrane receptor-mediated signaling pathways (42Sundberg C. Rubin K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 741-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 43Blystone S.D. Lindberg F.P. Williams M.P. McHugh K.P. Brown E.J. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 279-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). A similar active role of the specific interaction between integrins and tyrosine kinase receptors has been established in a variety of cell types (45Schneller M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5600-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). For example, in endothelial cells, the interaction between integrin αvβ3 and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 is essential for vascular endothelial growth factorinduced angiogenesis (46Brooks P.C. Clark R.A. Cheresh D.A. Science. 1994; 264: 569-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (2732) Google Scholar, 47Byzova T.V. Goldman C.K. Pampori N. Thomas K.A. Bett A. Shattil S.J. Plow E.F. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 851-860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, activation of EGFR is required for integrin αvβ5-directed motility in FG human pancreatic carcinoma cells, whereas the interaction between integrin αvβ3 and EGFR mediates cell survival and proliferation in smooth muscle cells (25Klemke R.L. Yebra M. Bayna E.M. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 44Jones P.L. Crack J. Rabinovitch M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 279-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Our results, in context with other reports, have underscored the paradigm that the coordination of inputs from integrins and growth factor receptors is essential for periostin-induced cell invasive activity. Clinical studies found higher serum levels of periostin in cancer patients with malignant diseases compared with patients with local cancers (32Sasaki H. Dai M. Auclair D. Fukai I. Kiriyama M. Yamakawa Y. Fujii Y. Chen L.B. Cancer. 2001; 92: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 33Sasaki H. Yu C.Y. Dai M. Tam C. Loda M. Auclair D. Chen L.B. Elias A. Breast Cancer Res.

Head Neck Surg. 2003; 129: 754-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The high concentration of periostin in the blood was directly correlated with poor prognosis and short survival in multiple cancers, including breast, lung, head, and neck cancers. Therefore, periostin may be a valuable biomarker for tumor metastasis. The elevated production of periostin in metastatic diseases may directly cause cancerous cells to induce malignant transformation of mesenchymal phenotype. To this end, our data have identified important functional and molecular mechanisms for periostin in tumor metastasis. Periostin triggers the co-activation of integrin αvβ5 and EGFR signaling and induces expression of multiple genes such as MMP-9, vimentin, and fibronectin, leading to EMT and metastasis (Fig. 7). Elevated serum levels of periostin in cancer patients provide a promising tool for early detection of cancer and for monitoring cancer patients. More importantly, the results underscore possible applications of EGFR kinase inhibitors for control of metastasis in multiple human cancers in which both EGFR and periostin are overproduced (33Sasaki H.

https://openalex.org/W2050983302,"CD44-hyaluronan (HA) interaction is involved in diverse physiological and pathological processes. Regulation of interacting avidity is well studied on CD44 but rarely on HA. We discovered a unique covalent modification of HA with a protein, SHAP, that corresponds to the heavy chains of inter-α-trypsin inhibitor family molecules circulating in blood. Formation of the SHAP·HA complex is often associated with inflammation, a well known process involving the CD44-HA interaction. We therefore examined the effect of SHAP on the CD44-HA interaction-mediated lymphocyte adhesion. Under both static and flowing conditions, Hut78 cells (CD44-positive) and CD44-transfected Jurkat cells (originally CD44-negative) adhered preferentially to the immobilized SHAP·HA complex than to HA. The enhanced adhesion is exclusively mediated by the CD44-HA interaction, because it was inhibited by HA, but not IαI, and was completely abolished by pretreating the cells with anti-CD44 antibodies. SHAP appears to potentiate the interaction by increasing the avidity of HA to CD44 and altering their distribution on cell surfaces. Large amounts of the SHAP·HA complex accumulate in the hyperplastic synovium of rheumatoid arthritis patients. Leukocytes infiltrated to the synovium were strongly positive for HA, SHAP, and CD44 on their surfaces, suggesting a role for the adhesion-enhancing effect of SHAP in pathogenesis.

Leukocytes infiltrated to the synovium were strongly positive for HA, SHAP, and CD44 on their surfaces, suggesting a role for the adhesion-enhancing effect of SHAP in pathogenesis. Leukocyte cell-surface adhesion molecules play important roles in hematopoiesis, trafficking, recruitment, and the activation of leukocytes. Efforts toward identifying the adhesion molecules mediating the leukocyte-endothelial interaction have led to two families of adhesion molecules: the glycan-recognizing selectin family, which participates in the primary adhesion and rolling of leukocytes on the endothelium, and the integrin family members, which recognize the immunoglobulin superfamily molecules that are involved in the subsequent firm adhesion. The participation of these adhesion molecules has been well documented in leukocyte extravasation and function in diverse systems. Nevertheless, it is certain that there are more adhesion molecules involved in the regulation of these processes. A promising candidate is the CD44-hyaluronan (HA) 2The abbreviations used are: HA, hyaluronan; HC, heavy chain; SHAP, serum-derived hyaluronan-associated protein; HABP, the aggrecan-link protein complex-derived HA-binding protein; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; TSG6, tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene 6; RA, rheumatoid arthritis; IαI, inter-α-trypsin inhibitor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CMV, cytomegalovirus.2The abbreviations used are: HA, hyaluronan; HC, heavy chain; SHAP, serum-derived hyaluronan-associated protein; HABP, the aggrecan-link protein complex-derived HA-binding protein; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; TSG6, tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene 6; RA, rheumatoid arthritis; IαI, inter-α-trypsin inhibitor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CMV, cytomegalovirus. interaction that has attracted much attention since the late 1980s. CD44, first cloned as a lymphocyte surface antigen recognized by lymphocyte homing-interfering monoclonal antibodies (1.Stamenkovic I. Amiot M. Pesando J.M. Seed B. Cell. 1989; 56: 1057-1062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar), is a single polypeptide type I transmembrane protein encoded by a single gene. The standard form of CD44 consists of an N-terminal HA-binding domain, a stem region, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain. There are many CD44 variant forms with insertions at the stem region resulting from the alternative splicing of the exon 6-15 (or exon V1-V10) (2.Gunthert U. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1993; 184: 47-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 3.Lesley J. Hyman R. Kincade P.W. Adv. Immunol. 1993; 54: 271-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). CD44 shares a highly conserved HA-binding domain, the link module, with HA-binding large proteoglycans (aggrecan, PG-M/versican, brevican, and neurocan), the link protein, and tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene 6 product (TSG6) (1.Stamenkovic I.

Chem. 2002; 277: 4585-4588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). CD44 is also expressed in many kinds of cells other than leukocytes. Although CD44 interacts with a number of cell-surface or extracellular molecules, such as fibronectin, collagen, selectin, osteopontin, and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, its principal ligand is believed to be HA (3.Lesley J. Hyman R. Kincade P.W. Adv. Immunol. 1993; 54: 271-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). The roles of CD44-HA interaction in lymphocyte extravasation (5.DeGrendele H.C. Estess P.

Depending on the diseases, the consequences of the interaction may either be inflammatory, for example in the autoimmune diseases, where its role in the recruitment and activation of circulating leukocytes is predominant, or anti-inflammatory, e.g. in hepatitis and lung inflammation, where its principal role seems to be the induction of apoptosis of leukocytes. Given the diversity of the targeting tissue and effects of CD44-HA interaction, it is not surprising that the interaction is under the control of extremely complex mechanisms. It is well known that most CD44-bearing leukocytes are actually not adhesive to HA until they are activated. Extensive studies on the activation-associated molecular modification of CD44 have revealed that it is multifactorial, involving transcriptional up-regulation (21.Weiss J.M. Renkl A.C. Ahrens T.

The regulation is strongly event- and cell type-dependent. Even the same kind of modification may lead to opposite outcomes under different circumstances; for example, the blockage of N-glycosylation with tunicamycin or by amino acid residue substitution enhances the CD44-HA interaction in pre-B cells, fibroblasts, Chinese hamster ovary cells, and melanoma cells (31.Lesley J.

Metastasis. 1999; 17: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In sharp contrast to CD44, little information is available about the regulation of CD44-HA interaction on HA side. The major reason is due to the structural simplicity of HA: the linearly repeating N-acetylglucosamine-glucuronic acid disaccharide units. In the absence of a core protein modification, sulfation, and epimerization, the chain length appears to be the sole molecular variation of HA. In recent years, there are accumulating data indicating that the degradation of HA macromolecules occurs during some inflammatory disorders and that the resulting low molecular weight HA fragments exhibit different biological activities from their precursors (36.McKee C.M. Penno M.B. Cowman M. Burdick M.D. Strieter R.M. Bao C. Noble P.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2403-2413Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 37.Wolf D. Schumann J. Koerber K. Kiemer A.K.

The size-dependent avidity of HA to cell-surface CD44 has been examined using HA oligomers. Monovalent binding was observed in 6- to 18-sugar-oligomers, and divalent binding with greatly and progressively increased avidity in 20- to 38-sugar-oligomers (38.Lesley J. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. Hyman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26967-26975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The relationship of such a mechanism to the pathological role of naturally occurring HA fragments, which are usually longer than the oligomers examined, remains to be further examined. Additionally, TSG6 has been recently shown to modulate the CD44-HA interaction, thus providing a new insight into the functional regulation of CD44-HA interaction on HA side (39.Lesley J. Gal I.

We have found that HA, ever thought to be a free molecule, could also be covalently modified by a protein. The protein, designated SHAP (serum-derived HA-associated protein), is bound to HA via a unique ester bond between the carboxyl of its C-terminal aspartate and the C-6 hydroxyl group of an internal N-acetylglucosamine of HA (40.Yoneda M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 26657-26663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). SHAP is identical to the heavy chains of inter-α (trypsin) inhibitor (IαI) family molecules (42.Huang L. Yoneda M. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26725-26730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which link via the same type of ester bond to the chondroitin sulfate chain of the IαI light chain, the bikunin proteoglycan (43.Enghild J.J. Salvesen G. Hefta S.A. Thogersen I.B. Rutherfurd S. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 747-751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The formation of the SHAP·HA complex is believed to be a transesterification reaction, where HA substitutes for chondroitin sulfate to form an ester bond with HC/SHAP. IαI family molecules, principally synthesized and secreted by the liver, occur constitutively at high concentrations in the circulation. The SHAP·HA complex is most likely formed between the extravasated IαI and the local HA, as best exemplified by rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ovulation process (44.Kida D. Yoneda M. Miyaura S.

The reaction is indispensable for the construction of HA-rich extracellular matrix of the expanding cumulus oophorus, oocyte transportation, and successful oocyte-sperm interaction (fertilization) (45.Zhuo L.

In addition, the complex is present in large amounts in the synovial fluid of RA patients. Patients with various inflammatory disorders often have an elevated plasma level with the complex (44.Kida D. Yoneda M. Miyaura S. Ishimaru T. Yoshida Y. Ito T. Ishiguro N. Iwata H. Kimata K. J.

Purification of the SHAP·HA Complex from RA Synovial Fluid—The purification and characterization of the synovial SHAP·HA complex has been described in detail elsewhere (47.Yingsung W. Zhuo L. Morgelin M. Yoneda M. Kida D. Watanabe H. Ishiguro N. Iwata H. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32710-32718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Briefly, the synovial fluid was subjected to sequential cesium chloride isopycnic centrifugation in the presence of 4 m guanidine hydrochloride to separate hyaluronan from the non-covalently associated proteins. The final highly purified preparation contains HA molecules with an average molecular weight of 1.8 million, about half of which bears SHAP at an average ratio of three to five SHAPs per HA chain. To cleave the ester linkage between SHAP and HA, the SHAP·HA complex solution was supplemented with NaOH to reach a final concentration of 0.1 m and incubated at room temperature for 30 min, followed by neutralization with HCl solution. In control tubes, NaOH solution and HCl solution were mixed before adding to the SHAP·HA complex solution. Purification of the SHAP·HA Complex from RA Hyperplastic Synovium—The hyperplastic synovium was obtained from RA patients receiving synovectomy. Synovium (6 g of wet weight) was homogenized with a glass grinder in 20 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer containing 5 mm deferoxamine mesylate, 10 mm EDTA, and 6% protease inhibitor cocktail. The homogenates was mixed with an equal volume of 8 m guanidine hydrochloride and then stirred overnight at 4 °C. After removing the insoluble materials by centrifuging at 10,000 rpm for 30 min, the density of the solution was adjust to 1.38 g/ml with solid cesium chloride. The solution was then subjected to isopycnic centrifugation as described above. The resulting density gradient was partitioned into 20 fractions, which were then precipitated twice with 3 volume of 95% ethanol containing 1.3% potassium acetate and finally dissolved in 0.4 ml of MilliQ water. The protein and uronate contents in each fraction were measured by using MicroBCA kit and carbazole reaction, respectively. Purification of IαI—Mouse IαI was purified from pooled serum from C57BL/6 mice as described before (45.Zhuo L. Yoneda M. Zhao M. Yingsung W. Yoshida N. Kitagawa Y. Kawamura K. Suzuki T. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7693-7696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The highly purified human IαI was a gift from the Chemo-Sero-Therapeutic Research Institute, Kumamoto, Japan. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—The SHAP·HA complex and HA were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as previously described (44.Kida D. Yoneda M. Miyaura S. Ishimaru T. Yoshida Y. Ito T. Ishiguro N. Iwata H. Kimata K. J. Rheumatol. 1999; 26: 1230-1238PubMed Google Scholar, 47.Yingsung W. Zhuo L. Morgelin M. Yoneda M. Kida D. Watanabe H. Ishiguro N. Iwata H. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32710-32718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Briefly, the SHAP·HA complex or HA in the sample solutions were captured on HABP (2 μg/ml in 0.1 m NaHCO3, pH ∼9.5)-coated wells of MaxiSorp plates, and then detected with rabbit anti-IαI antibody and then HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody, or biotinylated HABP and then HRP-conjugated streptavidin, respectively. The color reaction was developed with 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine substrate and stopped with 1 n HCl. The absorbance value was read at 450 nm. Cell Adhesion Assay—The cells were propagated in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, and 6.25 μg/ml penicillin G. The floating cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with PBS for three times, counted, and then resuspended at proper densities. For the adhesion assay under static conditions, plastic dishes (Falcon, #1008) or cover glasses were coated with HABP by incubating with 10-μl drops of HABP solution (4 μg/ml in 0.1 m NaHCO3, pH 9.5) overnight at 4 °C. After removing the HABP solutions followed by washing with PBS, 10 μl of the SHAP·HA or HA solution at indicated concentrations were added to the HABP-coated spots and incubated at room temperature for 1 h to immobilize the SHAP·HA complex or HA. After removing the drops with pipettes, the spots were washed extensively with PBS, overlaid with cell suspensions (1 × 106 cells/ml), and then incubated at room temperature for 30 min. For inhibition experiments, the cells were resuspended in PBS containing HA or IαI at indicated concentrations instead of PBS only. For antibody blocking experiment, the cells were preincubated with 5 μg/ml antibodies on ice for 30 min followed by washing with PBS. After washing with PBS to remove the unadhered cells, the central areas of the spots were photographed with an Olympus charge-coupled device digital camera mounted on an Olympus inverted microscope (100× magnification) to count the number of adhered cells. The strength of cell adhesion was represented by the density of adhered cells (number of cells per unit area). For the adhesion assay under flow shearing conditions, microscope slides were coated with HABP and then SHAP·HA complex (20 or 100 μg/ml) or HA (250 or 1000 μg/ml) as mentioned above and assembled in the parallel flow chamber designed by Lawrence et al. (48.Lawrence M.B. McIntire L.V. Eskin S.G. Blood. 1987; 70: 1284-1290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The SHAP·HA or HA-coated microscope slides were attached onto a transparent plastic plate with a silicon rubber gasket in parallel so that between the two surfaces a chamber with a thickness of 320 μm was formed, to which the inlet and outlet are connected. Rolling assays with the chamber were performed as described previously (49.Kanamori A. Kojima N. Uchimura K. Muramatsu T. Tamatani T. Berndt M.C. Kansas G.S. Kannagi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32578-32586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly the chamber was mounted on the stage of an inverted phase-contrast microscope (Model IX70, Olympus Products, Tokyo). Hut78 cells were introduced into the chamber at a concentration of 5 × 105/ml at decreasing levels of fluid shear (1.13, 0.85, 0.57, 0.42, and 0.28 dyne/cm2). The shear stress in the chamber was controlled using a syringe pump (Model 944, Harvard Apparatus, South Natick, MA). The numbers of rolling or attached cells were determined from digital images recorded with a Model CS-220 video camera system (Olympus). The flow chambers were maintained at 37 °C with an air-curtain incubator (Olympus Products, Model IX-IBM) throughout the experiments. The wall shear stress (T) was calculated from the equation, T = 3μQ/2a2b, where μ = coefficient of viscosity (1.0 centipoise), Q = volumetric flow rate (cm3/s), 2a = channel height (3.2 × 10−2 cm), and b = channel width (1.3 cm). Immunolabeling and Fluorescence Microscopy—Hut78 cell suspension was laid on the SHAP·HA or HA-coated cover glass (prepared as mentioned above), followed by incubating at room temperature for 20 min or 1 h. After washing, the adhered cells were fixed with 4% buffered neutral formaldehyde. The cover glass was blocked with 10% goat serum (Nichirei, Tokyo, Japan), incubated with PBS-T (0.1% Tween 20 in PBS) containing Ab4 antibody (1 μg/ml) and biotinylated HABP (0.5 μg/ml), and then with PBS-T containing Alexa 594-rabbit anti-mouse IgG (1:1,000 dilution) and Alexa 488-streptavidin (1:1,000 dilution) at room temperature for 1 h each. Finally, the cover glass was washed with PBS-T for 5 times, and then mounted on a glass slide with Gelmount (CosmoBio, Tokyo, Japan). The cells were examined and photographed with a Zeiss LSM5 PASCAL confocal laser microscope. RNA Extraction and Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was prepared from cells using TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen) and quantified by measuring the UV absorbance. The first strand cDNAs were synthesized from 4 μg of total RNA using Superscript II RNase H− reverse transcriptase and oligodT12-18 primer. The CD44 transcripts were amplified with AmpliTaq DNA polymerase and the primer set CTGGCGCAGATCGATTTGAA (forward, corresponding to the boundary of exon 1 and 2) and GGCGTACGTATAGGACCAGAGGTTGT (reverse, corresponding to exon 17, with a SplI site). The cycling conditions were: 95 °C for 3 min, 30 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 90 s, and finally 72 °C for 5 min. Cloning of CD44 Variants and Cell Transfection—The fulllength cDNA of human standard form CD44 (sCD44 or CD44H), including ∼50 bp of the 5′-untranslated region as well as 15 bp of the 3′-untranslated region, was cloned into the EcoRI site of pCDNA3.1/Myc-His(-) B vector (Invitrogen). The stop codon TAA was mutated to GAA, which, together with the 15-bp 3′-untranslated region, generates an extra peptide sequence EHLHHY between the CD44 polypeptides and the vector-derived C-terminal tags. The above sCD44 construct was used to generate the CD44 variant form (CD44v) constructs by inserting proper variable exons (exon 6 to exon 15, or exon V1 to V10) between exons 5 and 16. The HpaI site (GTTAAC) present in exon 5 and a SplI site generated by silent nucleotide mutation (from AGGACA to CGTACG) in exon 17 were selected for cloning, to which PCR-amplified CD44v transcripts were inserted. All CD44 constructs were verified by sequencing with ABI 310 sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For transfection of Jurkat cells with Bio-Rad Gene PulserII, 11 μg of PvuI-linearized CD44 constructs were mixed with 0.75 ml of cell suspension in PBS (1 × 107 cells) in a 0.4-cm cuvette and incubate"
https://openalex.org/W2040064405,"G9a is a SET-domain mammalian histone methyltransferase responsible for mono- and dimethylation of lysine 9 in histone H3 (H3K9) at euchromatic regions. Recently we reported that G9a forms a stoichiometric heteromeric complex with another SET-domain-containing molecule, GLP/Eu-HMTase1. Although G9a and GLP can independently methylate H3K9 in vitro, G9a/GLP heteromeric formation seems to be essential for their function as a euchromatic H3K9 methyltransferase in vivo. To further elucidate how G9a/GLP-mediated histone methylation and transcriptional regulation are controlled, we purified and characterized G9a complexes from mouse embryonic stem cells. We identified a novel G9a/GLP-associating zinc finger molecule named Wiz that can interact with G9a and GLP independently but is more stable in the G9a/GLP heteromeric complexes. Interestingly, Wiz small inhibitory RNA knocks down not only Wiz but also G9a. GLP deficiency also decreases G9a levels, suggesting that the Wiz/G9a/GLP tri-complex may protect G9a from degradation and that Wiz plays a major role in G9a/GLP heterodimer formation. Furthermore, amino acid sequence analysis of Wiz predicted two potential CtBP binding sites, and indeed CtBP binding to Wiz and association of CtBP with the Wiz/G9a/GLP complex was observed. These data indicate that Wiz not only contributes to the stability of G9a but also links the G9a/GLP heteromeric complex to the CtBP co-repressor machinery.

In eukaryotes, DNA is wrapped around core histones to form nucleosome particles and condensed chromatin structures with various nuclear molecules. Therefore, regulation of chromatin structure and dynamics is a very critical step for genomic functions. Covalent histone modifications play critical roles in regulating these processes (1.Lachner M. O'Sullivan R.J. Jenuwein T. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2117-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Among these modifications, histone lysine methylation has an enormous impact on various chromatin-associating functions including transcriptional regulation, heterochromatin formation, DNA repair, and recombination (1.Lachner M. O'Sullivan R.J. Jenuwein T. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2117-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 2.Martin C. Zhang Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Science. 2003; 300: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar), histone lysine methylation also controls protein (histone)-protein interaction. It has been shown that each methylated lysine residue of H3 and H4 is utilized differentially and recruits different functional molecules involved in different chromatin-associating processes (2.Martin C.

These HMTases are members of SET-domain-containing molecules and specifically methylate H3K9, which plays a crucial role in heterochromatin formation and heterochromatic gene silencing (19.Nakayama J.

Biol. 2003; 13: R895-R898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). H3K9 methylation has also been shown to control DNA methylation, typically in fungus Neurospora crassa and plant Arabidopsis thaliana (21.Tamaru H. Selker E.U.

Methylated H3K9 allows the binding of the chromodomain of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), a step that is crucial for most of the chromatin functions regulated by H3K9 methylation (4.Bannister A.J.

Science. 2001; 292: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). In transcriptional regulation within euchromatin, H3K9 methylation is generally associated with transcriptional silencing (1.Lachner M. O'Sullivan R.J. Jenuwein T. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2117-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar); however, recent reports suggest that H3K9 methylation is also associated with transcriptional activation (elongation) (23.Vakoc C.R.

G9a is also a SET-domain-containing molecule and a major mammalian histone methyltransferase responsible for mono- and dimethylation of H3K9 at euchromatic regions (25.Tachibana M. Sugimoto K.

Recently, we described that G9a forms a stoichiometric heteromeric complex with another SET-domain-containing molecule, GLP/Eu-HMTase1. Although G9a and GLP can independently methylate H3K9 in vitro, G9a/GLP heteromeric formation seems to be essential for exerting their function as a euchromatic H3K9 methyltransferase (27.Tachibana M.

It has been reported that both G9a and GLP are components of several transcriptional repression complexes, such as those involving E2F6, CtBP1, and CDP/cut (28.Ogawa H. Ishiguro K. Gaubatz S. Livingston D.M. Nakatani Y. Science. 2002; 296: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 29.Shi Y. Sawada J. Sui G. Affar el B. Whetstine J.R. Lan F. Ogawa H. Luke M.P. Nakatani Y.

A. 2004; 101: 11257-11262Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We have also revealed that G9a exists as ∼1-megadalton complexes in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. To elucidate how G9a/GLP HMTases regulate H3K9 methylation, how this transcriptional regulation is controlled, and the significance of the G9a/GLP heteromeric complex, we isolated the G9a complex from mouse ES cells and identified and characterized one of the novel G9a-associating molecules, Wiz. Cell Culture—Mouse ES cells were maintained in 10% fetal calf serum and LIF (500 units/ml)-containing medium. Generation of Stable Cell Lines—G9a–/– ES cells (clone #22-10, (25.Tachibana M. Sugimoto K. Nozaki M. Ueda J. Ohta T. Ohki M. Fukuda M. Takeda N. Niida H. Kato H. Shinkai Y. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1779-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar)) were co-transfected with a cDNA encoding human G9a (GenBank™ accession number NM_006709) tagged with His-FLAG epitopes at the carboxyl terminus in the pCAGGS expression plasmid and a vector conferring Hygromycin B resistancy (pGK-hygroB) by the use of Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Resistant cells were selected in ES cell medium containing 150 μg/ml hygromycin B and checked for the expression of human G9a by anti-G9a or anti-FLAG antibody by Western blotting. One of the positive clones (termed as HF7) was used for G9a complex purification. G9a Complex Purification—The G9a complexes were purified from a nuclear extract prepared from HF7 cells. As a control, mock purification was performed from a nuclear extract prepared from the G9a–/– ES cells expressing mouse G9a-L without tags (clone #15-3). After removing the cytoplasmic fraction with buffer A (10 mm HEPES-KOH at pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), nuclear pellets were suspended and lysed with buffer D (20 mm HEPES-KOH at pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 420 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 20% glycerol) for 30 min on ice. The insoluble nuclear fraction was removed by centrifugation. The nuclear extract was first applied to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen) and bound materials were eluted with buffer D containing 0.2 m immidazole. The eluates were further incubated with anti-FLAG mouse monoclonal antibody (M2)-conjugated agarose beads (Sigma) and then eluted with FLAG peptide (Sigma). The purified proteins were resolved by 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE and silver-stained. The polypeptides specific to HF7 cells were excised and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Aliquots of the purified G9a complexes were also loaded onto a 10-ml 10–30% glycerol gradient in buffer D, centrifuged at 32,000 rpm for 12 h, and fractionated. Each fraction was concentrated with trichloroacetic acid, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by silver staining or Western blotting. Immunofluorescence Analysis—By the use of TransIT-LT1 (Mirus), pEGFP-C2-Wiz was transfected to NIH3T3 cells. After 2 days in culture, cells were collected, cytospun, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. Then the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min and incubated with anti-G9a (#8620) at 37 °C for 40 min. Anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Zenon Alexa Fluor 568 (Molecular Probes) was used for detection. The nuclei were counterstained with DAPI, observed under fluorescence microscopy, and analyzed with AxioVision software (Zeiss). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—For immunoprecipitation of endogenous G9a, GLP, and Wiz, ES cells were harvested with phosphate-buffered saline containing trypsin (0.05%) and EDTA (0.2 mm). Nuclear extracts were prepared as described under “G9a Complex Purification.” Nuclear extracts from 107 ES cells were incubated with 2 μg of antibodies overnight and immune complexes were collected with 20 μl of protein G slurry (1:1 ratio) for 1 h. The immune complexes were washed twice with 300 μl of buffer D. For the stringent immunoprecipitation experiments, RIPA buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitor; Nakalai) was used for nuclear extraction and following immunoprecipitation steps. For transient G9a, GLP, Wiz, and CtBP interaction analyses, HEK 293T cells were transfected using TransIT-LT1, with combinations of FLAG-tagged cDNAs driven by the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) or the pM vector (Clontech) and the corresponding cDNAs subcloned into the pEGFP-C vectors (Clontech). After 2 days in culture, whole cell extracts were prepared with buffer D and used for immunoprecipitation as described above. For Western blot analysis, immunoprecipitated molecules or total cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blocked with 5% milk, and probed with the specific antibodies described below. Antibodies—For detection of mouse and human G9a, mouse monoclonal antibody #8620 (Perseus Proteomics Inc.) and hamster monoclonal antibody #14-1 (Medical & Biological Laboratories Co., Ltd.) were used, respectively. For detection of mouse and human GLP, mouse monoclonal antibody #422 (Perseus Proteomics Inc.) and hamster monoclonal antibody C7–5 (Medical & Biological Laboratories Co., Ltd.) were used, respectively. For detection of epitope-tagged protein, rabbit anti-GFP (Code No.598, MBL), anti-FLAG M2 (code number F3165, Sigma) and anti-GAL4-DNA-binding domain (RK5C1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used. For specificity control in two sequential immunodepletions analyses, anti-TRF1 was used (31.Iwano T. Tachibana M. Reth M. Shinkai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1442-1448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). For the negative control of immunoprecipitation experiments, anti-Myc (9E10) antibody was used. To control for protein loading, anti-tubulin (CP06, Oncogene) was used. For CtBP detection, mouse monoclonal antibodies against CtBP1 and CtBP2 (BD Biosciences) were used. Plasmid Constructions—For the construction of FLAG-mWiz expression vector, mWiz cDNA (GenBank™ accession number AB255388) was inserted into XhoI site of the pcDNA3 vector, which has FLAG-tag sequence between HindIII/BamHI sites. For the construction of EGFP-mWiz expression vector, mWiz cDNA was inserted into BamHI/XbaI sites of pEGFP-C2 vector. For the construction of GAL4-mWiz expression vector, mWiz cDNA was inserted into BamHI/SalI sites of pm vector (Clontech). ΔZF6 version of Wiz was made by removal of cDNA coding amino acid positions from 853 to 956 (downstream of PstI site). The ZF6 version of Wiz (amino acid positions from 851 to 956) was made by inserting mWiz cDNA corresponding to this region to PstI/BamHI sites of pEGFP-C1 vector. For the construction of EGFP-tagged mCtBP1 and mCtBP2 expression vectors, mCtBP1 cDNA was inserted into EcoRI site of pEGFP-C2 vector and mCtBP2 cDNA was inserted into KpnI/XbaI sites of pEGFP-C3 vector. FLAG-mCtBP2 was constructed by inserting FLAG-tag sequence into KpnI site of pcDNA3.1-His-CtBP2 vector (kind gift from Dr. Shimotohno). All the mG9a, mGLP, and mSuv39h1 expression vectors used were described previously (25.Tachibana M. Sugimoto K. Nozaki M. Ueda J. Ohta T. Ohki M. Fukuda M. Takeda N. Niida H. Kato H. Shinkai Y.

Shinkai Y. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 815-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Anti-Wiz Antibody Production—mWiz cDNA was subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-4T-3 (Amersham Biosciences). Recombinant fusion molecules (amino acid positions from 300 to 956 of the Wiz polypeptide) were used to immunize rabbits. Anti-Wiz antibody was affinity-purified using glutathione S-transferase-fused Wiz (amino acid positions from 300 to 514 of mWiz). siRNA—Double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides (21 nucleotides) homologous to G9a, GLP, and Wiz were designed as follows: G9a, 5′-CCAUG CUGUC AACUA CCAUG G (forward) and 5′-AUGGU AGUUG ACAGC AUGGA G (reverse); GLP, 5′-GCGUG GUCAA GUAUG AGCUG A (forward) and 5′-AGCUC AUACU UGACC ACGCU G (reverse); Wiz #1, 5′-GAGCA AGCCA AAACC UCAAA C (forward) and 5′-UUGAG GUUUU GGCUU GCUCC U (reverse); Wiz #2, 5′-GAAUA AGGAA CGUGG AUCUU U (forward) and 5′-AGAUC CACGU UCCUU AUUCU C (reverse); Wiz #3, 5′-GCAGA ACAUC AACAA AUUUG A (forward) and 5′-AAAUU UGUUG AUGUU CUGCC G (reverse); Control siRNA, 5′-GGAAG GCUCU UGAUG AAAUG G (forward); 5′-AUUUC AUCAA GAGCC UUCCA U (reverse). Cells were treated with annealed siRNAs at a final concentration of 25 nm by the use of Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). As a control, unrelated nuclear protein siRNA was used. Northern Blot Analysis—Eight micrograms of total RNAs were separated by 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel electrophoresis, transferred to a nylon membrane, and hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA probes. Purification of the G9a Complex—The G9a complex was purified from G9a–/– ES cells stably expressing human G9a tagged with carboxyl-terminal His-FLAG epitopes (clone HF7). Nuclear extracts from HF7 cells were first incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose, and the bound polypeptides were eluted with buffer containing 0.2 m immidazole. The G9a complexes were further purified with agarose beads conjugated with anti-FLAG antibody. Control mock purification was performed in parallel using G9a–/– ES cells stably expressing mouse G9a-L without tags (clone 15-3). The second affinity purification step with anti-FLAG antibody resulted in the identification of several polypeptides that associated with G9a in the HF7 but not the 15-3 extracts (Fig. 1A). It is of note that G9a–/– ES cell phenotypes such as Mage-a genes expression were rescued in HF7 cells (data not shown). The components of the G9a complex were identified by mass spectrometry. As reported in previous studies (27.Tachibana M. Ueda J. Fukuda M. Takeda N. Ohta T. Iwanari H. Sakihama T. Kodama T. Hamakubo T. Shinkai Y. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 815-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 28.Ogawa H. Ishiguro K. Gaubatz S. Livingston D.M. Nakatani Y.

A. 2004; 101: 11257-11262Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), GLP was present in the complex. In addition to GLP, we identified a protein named Wiz (widely interspaced zinc finger motifs), previously reported as a factor containing five Kruppel (C2H2)-type zinc finger motifs in a widely interspaced manner (32.Matsumoto K. Ishii N. Yoshida S. Shiosaka S. Wanaka A. Tohyama M. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 61: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Although brain specificity has been attributed to Wiz, our Northern blot analysis showed that Wiz is ubiquitously expressed in various mouse tissues (Fig. 1C), suggesting a more general function of Wiz. To confirm the interaction between G9a and Wiz, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. HEK 293T cells were transfected with vectors expressing EGFP-Wiz and/or FLAG-tagged G9a molecules (FLAG-G9a). Lysates prepared from the transfected cells were incubated with anti-FLAG antibody and the immunoprecipitates subjected to Western blots analyses. Use of anti-FLAG antibodies clearly showed that EGFP-Wiz co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-tagged G9a (Fig. 1D, lane 4). Similarly, when we immunoprecipitated EGFP-Wiz with anti-GFP, FLAG-tagged G9a was co-precipitated (lane 8). Since in previous studies we have shown that nuclear-targeted EGFP alone does not bind to FLAG-tagged G9a (27.Tachibana M. Ueda J. Fukuda M. Takeda N. Ohta T. Iwanari H. Sakihama T. Kodama T. Hamakubo T. Shinkai Y. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 815-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar), we conclude that G9a can stably associate with Wiz in cells. Wiz Is a Nuclear Protein That Co-localizes with G9a—Next, to examine the sub-cellular localization of Wiz, NIH3T3 cells were transiently transfected with a EGFP-Wiz expression vector and stained with anti-G9a antibody. As shown in Fig. 1E, Wiz (EGFP-Wiz) was detected only in the nucleus but largely excluded from nucleoli (arrowhead) and, importantly, co-localized with G9a. These data further support the association of Wiz with G9a. Endogenous Wiz Is in the G9a/GLP Complex—To confirm that this association exists between endogenously expressed G9a/GLP and Wiz, we generated specific antibody against Wiz. Western blot analysis revealed that our anti-Wiz antibody specifically detected two distinct bands in TT2 mouse ES cells (about 120 and 130 kDa, arrows) and human cell lines (about 125 kDa and 135 kDa in HeLa and HEK 293), as well as the 120-kDa protein (arrowhead) expressed from mWiz cDNA (Fig. 1F, left panel). Furthermore, addition of Wiz siRNA decreased the intensity of signals detected by this antibody in human cells (Fig. 4 and not shown). Therefore, we concluded that our antibody recognizes both mouse and human Wiz proteins. We then performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments using anti-G9a, anti-GLP, and anti-Wiz antibodies. We clearly showed that anti-G9a or anti-GLP antibodies co-immunoprecipitated not only GLP and G9a but also Wiz in TT2 mouse ES cells; in turn, anti-Wiz antibody co-immunoprecipitated G9a and GLP molecules (Fig. 1F, right panel). Furthermore, this G9a-GLP/Wiz interaction was observed in several mouse and human cell lines (Fig. 5C and supplemental Fig. S1). These results indicate that association of endogenous Wiz and the G9a/GLP complex exists widely.FIGURE 5Association of CtBPs with Wiz and the G9a/GLP/Wiz/CtBPs complex formation. A, EGFP-CtBP1 or CtBP2 were co-expressed in HEK 293T cells, either with FLAG-G9a, GLP, or Wiz, specified at the top of the figure. Immunoprecipitates were collected with control anti-Myc antibody or anti-FLAG antibody. FLAG-Wiz, but not FLAG-G9a nor FLAG-GLP, significantly precipitated both CtBP1 and CtBP2. B, Wiz contains two CtBP interaction domains (termed CID) that are located close to ZF3 and ZF4, respectively. For the CID mutation analysis, CID1, CID2, or both were mutated to the ASASA sequence (left panel). FLAG-CtBP2 was co-expressed with Wiz CID mutants, specified at the top of the figure. Immunoprecipitates were collected with control anti-Myc antibody or anti-FLAG antibody. This experiment indicated that Wiz contains two CID domains, and most of the association is carried through CID2 (right panel). C, nuclear extracts from HeLa cells were prepared for precipitation of endogenous Wiz, CtBP1, and CtBP2. Antibodies used for immunoprecipitation are specified at the top of the figure. All of the antibodies used precipitated partner proteins. D, nuclear extracts from mouse ES cells (TT2) were prepared for precipitation of endogenous G9a, GLP, Wiz, CtBP1, and CtBP2. Antibodies used for immunoprecipitation are specified at the top of the figure. Only CtBP2 was detected in the α-G9a/GLP/Wiz triple complexes. IP, immunoprecipitation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In addition, we determined the homogeneity of the G9a complex described in the legend to Fig. 1A. The purified materials were separated on a 10–30% glycerol gradient by ultracentrifugation and each fraction was analyzed by silver staining (data not shown) and Western blot (Fig. 1G). G9a appears in at least three different forms (fractions 2–4, 5–9, and 12), and both GLP and Wiz co-precipitate with all forms. We next performed sequential immunodepletion analysis of Wiz with anti-GLP antibody (Fig. 1H). Two consecutive immunoprecipitations with anti-GLP resulted in an efficient depletion of not only G9a but also Wiz. From these observations, we conclude that Wiz is a major component of the G9a complex, at least in mouse ES cells. Both G9a and GLP Can Interact with Wiz—To determine the domain that is responsible for the interaction between G9a and Wiz, we constructed several deletion mutants of G9a and performed co-immunoprecipitation assays with Wiz (Fig. 2A and data not shown). Interestingly, Wiz was unable to interact with the G9a mutant missing a SET-domain (G9aΔSET) (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 6). Since the SET-domains of G9a and GLP are highly homologous, this suggested that Wiz might also interact with GLP. Co-expression analysis of FLAG-Wiz with EGFP-GLP or EGFP-GLPΔSET in HEK 293T cells revealed that EGFP-GLP, but not EGFP-GLPΔSET, clearly co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-Wiz (Fig. 2A, lanes 9 and 12). However, another SET-domain-containing molecule, Suv39h1, failed to bind Wiz (lane 15). Therefore, this SET-domain-dependent Wiz interaction appears specific to G9a and GLP. ZF6 of Wiz Is Essential for the Interaction with Both G9a and GLP—We also analyzed which domain of Wiz is important for G9a and GLP association. As shown in Fig. 2B, the last zinc finger motif, ZF6, which has a larger interval between C2 and H2 (Fig. 1B, bottom) and not recognized as the zinc finger motif in the original report (32.Matsumoto K. Ishii N. Yoshida S. Shiosaka S. Wanaka A. Tohyama M. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 61: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), was required for the interaction between both G9a and GLP (Fig. 2B, lanes 3, 6, 9, and 12). To further evaluate whether the SET-domain of G9a or GLP and the ZF6 of Wiz are directly involved in their interactions, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assays using such domain-only molecules. As shown in Fig. 2C, EGFP-tagged Wiz ZF6 specifically interacted with the FLAG-tagged SET-domains of G9a or GLP, whereas EGFP alone did not associate with either of them (Fig. 2C, lanes 3, 6, 9, and 12). Finally, we introduced two types of point mutations into ZF6 that should impair zinc ion binding (33.Simpson R.J. Cram E.D. Czolij R. Matthews J.M. Crossley M. Mackay J.P. J. Biol.

We found that the dangerous Cn2 β-scorpion peptide induces both the left shift voltage-dependent activation and a transient resurgent current only in human Nav1.6 channels (among 1.1-1.7), whereas CssIV did not induce the resurgent current. Cn2 also produced both actions in mouse Purkinje cells. These findings suggest that only distinct β-toxins produce resurgent currents. We suggest that the novel and unique selectivity of Cn2 could make it a model drug to replace deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus in patients with Parkinson disease.

The structural similarity of the seven known tetrodotoxin (TTX) 4The abbreviations used are: TTX, tetrodotoxin; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; VC, voltage clamp.-sensitive α-subunits (Nav1.1-Nav1.7) is relatively high, and biophysical studies of the effects of specific toxins have been crucial for extending our understanding of the structure and function of ion channels (1.Catterall W.A.

By binding to the extracellular end of the IIS4 voltage sensor segment, the toxin stabilizes and traps it in the outward (activated) position, enhancing the probability of channel opening and, thus, producing the negative shift in the voltage dependence of activation (the voltage sensor-trapping model; see Ref. 4.Cestèle S.

To some extent, these studies explained previous observations of scorpion venom actions (7.Cahalan M.D. J. Physiol. 1975; 244: 511-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and the effects of β-scorpion toxins on frog and toad Ranvier nodes (8.Meves H. Rubly N. Watt D.D. Pfluegers.

In contrast, sea anemone toxins and α-scorpion toxins disrupt the inactivation process by interacting with the extracellular IVS3-S4 loop (3.Rogers J.C. Qu Y. Tanada T.N. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15950-15962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The resurgent current has been defined as an unexpected behavior exhibited by an inactivated channel that “conventionally” should not be able to reopen immediately upon repolarization at potentials where it normally opens (10.Raman I.M. Bean B.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4517-4526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Discovered in dissociated cerebellar Purkinje neurons, a working model assumes, at the channel cytoplasmic face, the existence of an intrinsic blocking particle (not conventional) functioning in parallel with the inactivation particle (conventional) in a mutually exclusive way. During strong, brief depolarizations, the blocking particle obstructs open Na+ channels, producing the “unconventional” inactivated state. Repolarization expels the blocking particle from the inner mouth of the open channel, initiating a phase of resurgent current that terminates with classical inactivation (10.Raman I.M. Bean B.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4517-4526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Raman I.M. Sprunger L.K. Meisler M.H. Bean B.P.

Biol. 1999; 287: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) purified from the venom of the Mexican scorpion Centruroides noxius on various human Na+ channel isoforms (Nav1.1-Nav1.7). We discovered that Cn2 is only capable of inducing the voltage sensor-trapping mechanism in the hNav1.6 channel current recorded in stably transfected HEK cells and in wild-type cerebellar Purkinje cells. Moreover, we found that Cn2 generates a novel transient resurgent current in both cell types (11.Raman I.M. Sprunger L.K. Meisler M.H. Bean B.P. Neuron. 1997; 19: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Cn2 was purified from the venom of the scorpion C. noxius using a previously described technique (14.Zamudio F. Saavedra R. Martin B.M. Gurrola-Briones G. Herion P. Possani L.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). CssIV (15.Rochat H. Darbon H. Jover E. Martin M.F. Bablito J. Couraud F. J. Physiol.

We collected the scorpions in the field and then extracted and separated the venom using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Briefly, the soluble venom was fractionated by HPLC using a C18 reverse-phase column in the presence of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and then eluted using a linear gradient of 0-60% acetonitrile. The component with the expected molecular mass determined by means of mass spectrometry (Finigan LCQDUO electrospray) was further purified by two additional steps. 5G. Corzo, E. Wanke, and L. D. Possani, manuscript in preparation. CssIV elutes at 27.1 min in a gradient of 20-60% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The theoretical molecular mass (7602.6 atomic mass units) and that measured experimentally (7602.0 atomic mass units) were as expected from the previously established primary structure (Swiss Protein accession number P60266). Additionally, the first 17 amino acid residues in the N-terminal region of CssIV were directly determined on the basis of automatic Edman degradation (LF 3000 Protein Sequencer; Beckman) in order to confirm the sequence. The CssIV sequence underwent homology modeling using the SWISS-MODEL server (17.Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4531) Google Scholar) and the lowest energy conformer in the Protein Data Bank entry 1Cn2 as template (13.Pintar A. Possani L.D. Delepierre M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). After a second round of refinement, the quality of the final model is equivalent to that of the template (assessed by the WHAT_CHECK program (18.Hooft R.W.W. Vriend G. Sander C. Abola E.E. Nature. 1996; 381 (272): 272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1816) Google Scholar)), so no further (on-bench) refinement was used. The three-dimensional structure of Cn2 and the model of CssIV were visualized using the MOLMOL program (19.Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6497) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—HEK293 cell lines stably expressing human Nav1.1, -1.2, -1.3, -1.5, and -1.6 (generously donated by Dr. J. J. Clare of GlaxoSmithKline, Stevenage, UK) were cultured in modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum as described by Olivera et al. (20.Oliveira J.S. Redaelli E. Zaharenko A.J. Restano Cassulini R. Konno K. Pimenta D.C. Freitas J.C. Clare J.J. Wanke E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33323-33335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Nav1.4-expressing cells were obtained by stably transfecting a plasmid containing the hNav1.4 construct (a kind gift from Prof. Diana Conti-Camerino, University of Bari, Italy). In order to test the Nav1.7 channels, we used primary cultures of rat chromaffin cells (see Ref. 21.Gullo F. Ales E. Rosati B. Lecchi M. Masi A. Guasti L. Cano-Abad M.F. Arcangeli A. Lopez M.G. Wanke E. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 330-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar for details), since the selective presence of this channel alone is well documented (22.Klugbauer N. Lacinova L. Flokerzi V. Hofmann F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1084-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) (see Ref. 23.Goldin A.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 871-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar for a review). Solutions and Drugs—The standard extracellular solution contained 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, 5 mm d-glucose, pH 7.40. The standard pipette solution contained 130 mm K+-aspartate, 10 mm NaCl, 2mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA-KOH, 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.30. About 6-8% of the cells in the clone expressing Nav1.6 channels had a persistent Na+ current, as reported by Burbidge et al. (24.Burbidge S.A. Dale T.J. Powell A.J. Whitaker W.R.J. Xie X.M. Romanos M.A. Clare J.J. Mol. Brain Res. 2002; 103: 80-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We systematically tested these cells and discarded those showing incomplete inactivation (a residual current after 250 ms of <0.1% of the peak Na+ current). Known quantities of the toxins were dissolved in the extracellular solution immediately before the experiments. TTX (Sigma) was used at 100 nm on the Nav1.1, -1.2, -1.3, -1.4, -1.6, and -1.7 currents, and the resulting traces were subtracted from the control traces to obtain the TTX-sensitive currents; the Nav1.5 clone (which has a much higher TTX ID50 than 100 nm) never showed any significant potassium currents at the test potentials (25.Hille B. Ionic channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA2001: 635-640Google Scholar). The extracellular solutions were delivered through a remote-controlled 9-hole (0.6 mm) linear positioner placed near the cell under study, and the average response time was 2-3 s. Patch Clamp Recordings and Data Analysis—The currents were recorded at room temperature using the MultiClamp 700A (Axon Instruments) as previously described (21.Gullo F. Ales E. Rosati B. Lecchi M. Masi A. Guasti L. Cano-Abad M.F. Arcangeli A. Lopez M.G. Wanke E. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 330-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar); pipette resistance was about 1.3-2.1 megaohms; cell capacitance and series resistance errors were carefully (85-90%) compensated for before each run of the voltage clamp protocol in order to reduce voltage errors to less than 5% of the protocol pulse. The P/N leak procedure was routinely used. pClamp 8.2 (Axon Instruments) and Origin 7 (Microcal Inc.) software were routinely used during data acquisition and analysis. All of the data regarding inactivation (see Figs. 1D and 2, C and D) were obtained using the following protocols. 1) For development, from a holding potential of -120 mV, the cells were prepulsed to the conditioning voltage (-70, -60, -50 mV) and then stepped to -10 mV to determine the fraction of current inactivated during the prepulse at 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000 ms. 2) For recovery, the cells were pulsed at -10 mV for 40 ms and conditioned at the same potentials as before and then stepped again to -10 mV to determine the fraction of current recovered during the prepulse at 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 250 ms.FIGURE 2Properties of Cn2-induced currents decay and of the Cn2-induced resurgent currents. A, family of currents (lines) induced by Cn2 at -50 mV according to the protocol shown below.

Inset, currents from a cell, in the presence of ATX-II, in which the same protocols were used but the test pulse was from -90 to -40 mV.

Mice of the CD1 strain were used to characterize the effects of Cn2 on sodium currents and action potential discharge of Purkinje cells. Parasagittal cerebellar slices (300-μm thickness) were obtained following a previously described technique (26.Llinas R. Sugimori M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1980; 305: 171-195Crossref Scopus (819) Google Scholar, 27.Sacco T. Tempia F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 543: 505-520Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar), kept for 1 h at 35°C and then at room temperature in the extracellular saline solution containing 125 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.25 mm NaH2PO4, 26 mm NaHCO3, 20 mm glucose, bubbled with 95% O2, 5% CO2 (pH 7.4). The recording chamber was continuously perfused at room temperature (about 22 °C) with the bubbled saline solution at a rate of 2.5 ml/min. The Purkinje neuron upper surface was cleaned by a sodalime glass pipette filled with the extracellular saline solution. Membrane currents or voltage were recorded by an EPC-9C patch clamp amplifier (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany), filtered at 8.6 kHz, and digitized at 20 kHz. Digitized data were stored on a Macintosh computer (G3, Apple Computer, Cupertino, CA) using the Pulse software (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany) and analyzed by the Igor Pro software (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). For VC recordings, patch pipettes (2.5-3.0 megaohms) were filled with the following solution: 112 mm CsCl, 9 mm HEPES, 9 mm EGTA, 4 mm MgCl2, 14 mm phosphocreatine di(tris) salt, 4 mm Na2ATP, 0.4 mm Na3GTP. The external saline solution contained 40 mm NaCl, 113 mm TEA-Cl, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm BaCl2, 0.3 mm CdCl2, pH 7.4. In VC, the uncompensated value of series resistance was 4-8 megaohms, and series resistance compensation was set at 90%. For the young Purkinje neurons used for VC recordings, in these conditions, space clamp problems are minimal or absent even for the most distal cellular compartments (27.Sacco T. Tempia F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 543: 505-520Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The cell was kept at a holding potential of -70 mV. In current clamp recordings, the internal solution contained 140 mm potassium gluconate, 10 mm HEPES, 0.5 mm EGTA, 4 mm MgCl2, 4 mm Na2ATP, 0.4 mm Na3GTP. The external solution was the extracellular saline used for slice preparation and maintenance. Both in VC and current clamp experiments, GABAA and ionotropic glutamate receptors were kept blocked by bicuculline methochloride (20 μm) and kynurenic acid (1 mm). All solutions and drugs were applied by changing the perfusion line, except the Cn2 toxin, which was directly added to the recording chamber at 140 nm. The concentration of Cn2 in the chamber was calculated from the amount added and the final volume of solution. The final concentration of Cn2 applied to CD1 mice was always between 35 and 40 nm. The effect of the Cn2 toxin began immediately but increased for a few minutes, during which it diffused inside the tissue. In order to follow the wash-in of Cn2 action, the stimulation protocol was applied every minute. The effect of Cn2 saturated within 5 min. At the end of each VC recording session, the Na+ channel blocker TTX (0.5 μm) was applied. The traces in TTX were used to subtract capacitive and leak currents. Salts were purchased from Sigma, and TTX and receptor blockers were from Tocris Cookson (Langford, UK). Cn2 Is a β-Scorpion Toxin Only for Nav1.6 Channels—Since Cn2 doses of up to 0.3 μm had no effect on the cells expressing Nav1.1, Nav1.2, Nav1.3, Nav1.4, Nav1.5, and Nav1.7 α-subunits (see below; Fig. 4), we present here data obtained using HEK cells stably expressing the human α-subunit of Nav1.6 channels (20.Oliveira J.S. Redaelli E. Zaharenko A.J. Restano Cassulini R. Konno K. Pimenta D.C. Freitas J.C. Clare J.J. Wanke E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33323-33335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Previous experiments using Xenopus oocytes transiently expressing Nav1.6 channels with or without β-subunits (28.Smith M.R. Smith R.D. Plummer N.W. Meisler M.H. Goldin A.L. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6093-6102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown the presence of small persistent currents. The effect of Cn2 toxin on Nav1.6-expressing cells is dose-dependent and looks like that of CssIV described in rNav1.2 (4.Cestèle S. Qu Y. Rogers J.C. Rochat H. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1998; 21: 919-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 6.Cestèle S. Scheuer T. Mantegazza M. Rochat H. Catterall W.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 291-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The classical prepulse conditioned protocol (7.Cahalan M.D. J. Physiol. 1975; 244: 511-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) (see insets to Fig. 1, A and B) used to induce the left shift of the activation curve modified the channel biophysics in a manner that can be readily interpreted in the framework of the negative shift of the voltage-dependent activation. In Fig. 1, A-C, are shown the Na+ current recordings with or without a brief prepulse to +40 mV in control and in the presence of 140 nm of toxin. The current has a threshold of about -30 mV under control conditions (with or without prepulse), but toxin perfusion shifted it negatively to -60 mV. The peak inward currents were depressed 10-15%, depending on the toxin concentration and perfusion time. However, without the prepulse, a strong blocking action (see Fig. 1C) reproduced the properties of typical β-scorpion toxins. Both effects were recorded simultaneously, unlike the immediate left shift to -60 mV and delayed blocking at 0 mV caused by CssIV in rNav1.2 (4.Cestèle S. Qu Y. Rogers J.C. Rochat H. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1998; 21: 919-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Fig. 1D shows the effects of different Cn2 concentrations (8-70 nm) on normalized voltage-dependent conductances. Assuming that the channels exist in two forms (6.Cestèle S. Scheuer T. Mantegazza M. Rochat H. Catterall W.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 291-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 7.Cahalan M.D. J. Physiol. 1975; 244: 511-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), with and without toxin, the data were fitted by the sum of two Boltzmann relationships with concentration-dependent amplitudes (see legend of Fig. 1D). The inset of Fig. 1D (experiment in the same cell) shows that the currents elicited at -40 mV during the concentration increase are superimposable (see different symbols superimposed on the 70 nm data). These data demonstrate that the toxin and prepulse are responsible for revealing and facilitating the appearance of currents normally unavailable at more hyperpolarized membrane potentials, through the negative shift of the activation curve. By plotting in Fig. 1E (left axis), the concentration-dependent fractional increase in the amplitude of the left-shifted Boltzmann curve, which represents the proportion of the channels to which Cn2 was attached (n = 4), we could predict the EC50 of this process as being 39.2 ± 3.7 nm with a Hill coefficient of 1.82 ± 0.2, a value that suggests more than one binding site. Prepulse- and Cn2-induced Currents in the Region from-70 to-40 mV Disappear after 300 ms—In the region positive to -35 mV (threshold of activation in control), the time course of the currents in the presence of Cn2 was not significantly different from control (not shown). In contrast, a comparison between control and Cn2 was impossible in the novel region from -75 to -35 mV, because no currents can be elicited in control conditions. Nevertheless, we asked how the Cn2-induced currents at potentials below the control threshold could depend on the delay between the prepulse and the test potential. In other words, following the framework of the voltage sensor-trapping model (4.Cestèle S. Qu Y. Rogers J.C. Rochat H. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1998; 21: 919-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), we tested the possibility that the peptide toxin, after binding the outwardly moved S4 segments during the prepulse (so-called “primed channel”), could eventually unbind from the channel protein. In order to study the properties of the currents elicited by the 10-ms prepulse to +30 mV, we introduced a variable duration (from 2.5 to 200 ms at -100 mV) between the prepulse and the test pulse (see protocol in Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2A (where the test potential was -50 mV), these experiments revealed that 1) all of currents turn on with very fast kinetics (time to peak ∼1 ms), 2) the traces finally overlap on a slowly decaying component, and 3) the first part of each decaying trace has a faster decaying component. Fitting to a double exponential decaying function showed that the very slow decaying component is neither voltage-dependent nor toxin concentration-dependent but characterized by a time constant of about 104.2 ± 5.7 ms (n = 5). On the contrary, the fast inactivation component had voltage-dependent time constants: 9.5 ± 1.1 ms at -50 mV and 13.5 ± 1.4 ms at -60 mV (n = 5). In Fig. 2B, we plotted the fractional amplitudes of the slow (□) and fast (○) components at -50 and -60 mV (averaged) against the duration of the -100 mV level. The slow component resulted in a decaying process with a time constant of 104 ± 6.2 ms (n = 4). The fast component reached its maximum in about ∼10 ms but then matched the slow component decaying process. The ratio between the fast component and total peak was higher at -50 (▵) than at -60 mV (▴) and time-independent, suggesting a common underlying progression. Collectively, these data suggest that the negative shift of the voltage-dependent activation, induced by the combined actions of toxin and prepulse, is not a steady-state process but instead a transient machinery that disappears with a time constant of ∼100 ms. Similar effects and hypotheses have been reported with scorpion venoms (7.Cahalan M.D. J. Physiol. 1975; 244: 511-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Channels inactivated by a strong prepulse to +30 have enough time to quickly transition from an inactivated state to a closed state when stepped to -100 for at least 5-10 ms. From the closed state, channels are able to rapidly reopen at -60 mV, thus following the conventional recovery from inactivation. If this time is reduced to zero, conventional recovery should suggest no available current. Surprisingly, we recorded a new current shown in Fig. 2A at -50 (circles) and -60 mV (triangles) that is characterized by two phases, a moderately fast increase with a peak at about 20 ms and a much slower decay that mimics the 100-ms decay previously observed and characterized. To investigate if Cn2 also affected the voltage-dependent inactivation mechanisms, we compared development and recovery of inactivation. From development of inactivation protocols (see “Experimental Procedures”), we obtained the data shown in Fig. 1D (left axis, ◂, control;◃, Cn2). In Cn2, the best fitted Boltzmann curves negatively shifted by about 4-5 mV; however, the data were not statistically significant (see legend to Fig. 1). Recovery from inactivation was obtained by using the double pulse protocol (see “Experimental Procedures”). In control, at conditioning of -70 mV (see Fig. 2C, top), the envelope of the peaks was monotonic, and a similar exponential time course was observed also at -60 and -50 mV with time constants τrec (Vm), of 17.7 ± 1.4, 26.9 ± 1.5, and 25.7 ± 2.2 ms, respectively (n = 5). All of these control time constants agree with similar data reported for the rNav1.6 channel (29.Herzog R.I. Cummins T.R. Ghassemi F. Dib-Hajj S.D. Waxman S.G. J. Physiol. 2003; 551: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). However, in Cn2 (Fig. 2C, bottom), when potential was suddenly stepped from -10 to -70 mV, a novel current started to increase until the test pulse was stepped again to -10 mV. With long preconditioning durations at -70 mV, the time course of the novel current resembled the time course already seen in Fig. 2A (symbols). With preconditionings at -60 and -50 mV, results were very similar (not shown). The analyses of all of these data are plotted in Fig. 2D for control experiments (left scale, closed symbols) and for Cn2 (right scale, open symbols). The Cn2 data indicate, in the recovery from inactivation, a peak at about 23 ms (n = 6). This value approximately corresponds to the time to peak of the novel current and a decaying time course similar to that seen in Fig. 2B. Properties of Cn2-induced Resurgent Currents in Nav1.6 Channels: Voltage Dependence and the Boosting Effect of ATX-II—The currents observed in the region from -70 to -40 mV, induced by strong depolarizations, previously shown in Fig. 2, A (symbols), C, and D, resemble the so-called venom-induced current (Centruroides sculpturatus) observed by Cahalan (7.Cahalan M.D. J. Physiol. 1975; 244: 511-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) in the frog Ranvier node. Such currents have been interpreted and modeled as recovery from the inactivation process. Indeed, the time constants of the exponentially increasing venom-induced current were not different from the corresponding time constants of the recovery from inactivation. However, subsequent experiments (9.Wang G.K. Strichartz G.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1983; 23: 519-533PubMed Google Scholar) conducted with purified peptides from the same scorpion on Bufo marinus and Rana pipiens nodes did not match the previous results of the Cahalan (7.Cahalan M.D. J. Physiol. 1975; 244: 511-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) paper. Moreover, venom-induced currents also resemble those observed in Purkinje cells, namely resurgent currents (10.Raman I.M. Bean B.P. J. Neurosci. 1997"
https://openalex.org/W2105521696,"Extracytoplasmic solute receptors (ESRs) are important components of solute uptake systems in bacteria, having been studied extensively as parts of ATP binding cassette transporters. Herein we report the first crystal structure of an ESR protein from a functionally characterized electrochemical ion gradient dependent secondary transporter. This protein, SiaP, forms part of a tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic transporter specific for sialic acid in Haemophilus influenzae. Surprisingly, the structure reveals an overall topology similar to ATP binding cassette ESR proteins, which is not apparent from the sequence, demonstrating that primary and secondary transporters can share a common structural component. The structure of SiaP in the presence of the sialic acid analogue 2,3-didehydro-2-deoxy-N-acetylneuraminic acid reveals the ligand bound in a deep cavity with its carboxylate group forming a salt bridge with a highly conserved Arg residue. Sialic acid binding, which obeys simple bimolecular association kinetics as determined by stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy, is accompanied by domain closure about a hinge region and the kinking of an alpha-helix hinge component. The structure provides insight into the evolution, mechanism, and substrate specificity of ESR-dependent secondary transporters that are widespread in prokaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W1965488355,"Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons diverge within the optic chiasm to project to opposite sides of the brain. In mouse, contralateral RGCs are distributed throughout the retina, whereas ipsilateral RGCs are restricted to the ventrotemporal crescent (VTC). While repulsive guidance mechanisms play a major role in the formation of the ipsilateral projection, little is known about the contribution of growth-promoting interactions to the formation of binocular visual projections. Here, we show that the cell adhesion molecule Nr-CAM is expressed by RGCs that project contralaterally and is critical for the guidance of late-born RGCs within the VTC. Blocking Nr-CAM function causes an increase in the size of the ipsilateral projection and reduces neurite outgrowth on chiasm cells in an age- and region-specific manner. Finally, we demonstrate that EphB1/ephrin-B2-mediated repulsion and Nr-CAM-mediated attraction comprise distinct molecular programs that each contributes to the proper formation of binocular visual pathways."

On nondenaturing (native) gels, in vitro translated, 35S-labeled Gγ subunits traveled primarily according to their pI and apparently were not associated with other proteins. In contrast, in vitro translated, 35S-labeled Gβ subunits traveled at a high apparent molecular mass (∼700 kDa) and co-migrated with the chaperonin CCT complex (also called TRiC). Different FLAG-Gβ isoforms coprecipitated CCT/TRiC to a variable extent, and this correlated with the ability of the different Gβ subunits to efficiently form dimers with Gγ. When translated Gγ was added to translated Gβ, a new band of low apparent molecular mass (∼50 kDa) was observed, which was labeled by either 35S-labeled Gβ or Gγ, indicating that it is a dimer. Formation of the Gβγ dimer was ATP-dependent and inhibited by either adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) or aluminum fluoride in the presence of Mg2+. This inhibition led to increased association of Gβ with CCT/TRiC. Although Gγ did not bind CCT/TRiC, addition of Gγ to previously synthesized Gβ caused its release from the CCT/TRiC complex. We conclude that the chaperonin CCT/TRiC complex binds to and folds Gβ subunits and that CCT/TRiC mediates Gβγ dimer formation by an ATP-dependent reaction.

Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 325-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Signaling specificity of heterotrimers is affected both by the biochemistry of their protein-protein interactions and by cellular targeting mechanisms that direct placement of receptors, G proteins, and second messenger targets (7.Hildebrandt J.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 325-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 8.Neubig R.R. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). An important but poorly understood process that affects all aspects of the signaling specificity of the heterotrimeric G proteins is the synthesis and assembly of G protein heterotrimers.Gβγ dimer formation is an early event in G protein assembly (9.Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 10.Jones M.B. Siderovski D.P. Hooks S.B. Mol. Interventions. 2004; 4: 200-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Biochemically, the Gβγ complex is a very stable dimer (11.Hildebrandt J.D. Codina J. Risinger R. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2039-2042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that reversibly interacts with the Gα subunit, dependent on the associated guanine nucleotide (5.Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4682) Google Scholar). Given the apparent stability of the Gβγ dimer, its assembly is thought of as an all-ornone event; however, recent work indicates that the efficiency of dimer assembly in vitro is related to isoform-specific interactions of Gβ (12.Dingus J. Wells C.A. Campbell L. Cleator J.H. Robinson K. Hildebrandt J.D. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11882-11890Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Gβ is a member of a large family of WD repeat proteins (13.Smith T.F. Gaitatzes C. Saxena K. Neer E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 181-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar) that contain 4–16 repeats of a core of ∼40 amino acid. Gβ has seven repeats that form a closed, toroid-shaped, seven-bladed, β-propeller structure (14.Sondek J. Bohm A. Lambright D.G. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B.

Chem. 1991; 266: 4538-4544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the participation of as yet unidentified components of in vitro translation mixtures (17.Mende U. Schmidt C.J. Yi F.

One candidate for mediating Gβ folding and Gβγ dimer formation is the chaperonin CCT/TRiC complex (18.Garcia-Higuera I. Gaitatzes C. Smith T. Neer E.J. J. Biol.

In eukaryotes, at least three systems of molecular chaperones help fold the other 20–35% of cellular proteins: the heat shock proteins Hsp40 and Hsp70, the Hsp90 system, and the chaperonins (19.Valpuesta J.M.

Chaperonin complexes are found in prokaryotes (Group I) and eukaryotes (Group II). Group I is the GroEL·GroES complex, in which GroEL is formed by two rings of seven identical 57-kDa monomers that nonspecifically recognize proteins with exposed hydrophobic surfaces. The eukaryotic Group II chaperonins are called CCT (chaperonin containing TCP-1) or TRiC (TCP-1 Ring complex); TCP-1 is tailless complex polypeptide-1 (22.Frydman J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 603-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic CCT/TRiC is considerably more complex than GroEL, with eight different subunits that share 30% sequence identity, and it recognizes specific but poorly defined sequences in target proteins (19.Valpuesta J.M.

CCT/TRiC was originally characterized in the folding of actin and tubulin, but is now recognized to be involved in the folding of many different proteins (19.Valpuesta J.M. Martin-Benito J. Gomez-Puertas P. Carrascosa J.L. Willison K.R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 21.Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M.

Biochem. 2001; 70: 603-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar), a subset of which includes some WD repeat proteins (19.Valpuesta J.M. Martin-Benito J. Gomez-Puertas P. Carrascosa J.L. Willison K.R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 25.Siegers K. Bolter B. Schwarz J.P. Bottcher U.M.K. Guha S. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5230-5240Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), although it is not involved in the folding of all WD repeat proteins (26.Camasses A. Bogdanova A. Shevchemko A. Wolfgang Z. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 87-100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar).Isolated CCT/TRiC subunits were identified as interacting partners of the yeast Gβ homolog Ste4 in a high throughput screen of yeast genome coding regions (27.Ho Y. Gruhler A. Heilbut A. Bader G.D. Moore L. Adams S.-L. Millar A. Taylor P. Bennett K. Booutilier K. et al.Nature. 2002; 415: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3054) Google Scholar), but this did not extend to functional characterization of these interactions or to association with the CCT/TRiC complex. More recently, small interfering RNA to TCP-1α was shown to decrease Gβγ levels in cells (20.Humrich J. Bermel C. Bunemann M. Harmark L. Frost R. Quitterer U. Lohse M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20042-20050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), indicating the possibility that some cellular component involved in Gβγ dimer formation is dependent on the function of CCT/TRiC, and this was proposed as a site of regulation of Gβγ dimer formation. Despite these observations, there is no direct evidence that CCT/TRiC does or even could participate either in folding of Gβ or in Gβγ dimer formation. There is not even any information about whether eukaryotic Gβ or Gβγ interacts with CCT/TRiC. Here, we have studied the mechanism of Gβγ dimer formation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate and describe the role of CCT/TRiC both in Gβ folding and in Gβγ dimer formation.MATERIALS AND METHODSVectors—All Gβ and FLAG-Gγ constructs were as described previously (12.Dingus J. Wells C.A. Campbell L. Cleator J.H. Robinson K. Hildebrandt J.D. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11882-11890Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). All FLAG-Gβ constructs were obtained from the Guthrie cDNA Resource Center (available at www.cdna.org).In Vitro Translation and Transcription—In vitro translation of subunits was carried out using the TnT® Quick-Coupled Transcription/Translation System (manual no. TM045, Promega Corp.) as described previously (12.Dingus J. Wells C.A. Campbell L. Cleator J.H. Robinson K. Hildebrandt J.D. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11882-11890Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Any additions to the translation mixture were added before DNA and lysate.Gβγ Dimerization Assay by Immunoprecipitation—Quantitation of synthesized protein and the dimerization reaction were done as described previously (12.Dingus J. Wells C.A. Campbell L. Cleator J.H. Robinson K. Hildebrandt J.D. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11882-11890Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitation of Synthesized Subunits—Immunoprecipitation of the FLAG-tagged subunits from translations and/or dimerizations was carried out using agarose-conjugated anti-FLAG antibody (catalog no. A-2220, Sigma) with 5–20 μl of beads/sample. Beads were washed twice with 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl (Tris-buffered saline (TBS) 2The abbreviations used are: TBS, Tris-buffered saline; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; MS, mass spectrometric; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); ADPβS, adenosine 5′-O-2-(thiodiphosphate); PhLP, phosducin-like protein.), 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% C12E10 (polyoxyethylene 10-lauryl ether) (TBSBC). The beads were blocked against non-specific binding by incubation for 1 h at room temperature in 10 volumes of TBSBC with 5% reticulocyte lysate and then washed twice with 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1% C12E10 (TBSC). For immunoprecipitation, the sample was diluted 10–20-fold with TBSC; 5–20 μl of beads were added; and the samples were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The samples were centrifuged, and the beads were resuspended in TBSC and transferred to a new tube to reduce nonspecific binding of Gβ. The samples were washed a second time. Electrophoresis sample buffer was added to the beads to elute the bound proteins.Electrophoresis—Electrophoresis was carried out by the Laemmli procedure using Criterion Tris-HCl precast gels (Bio-Rad). Native (nondenaturing) gel electrophoresis was carried out following a procedure modified from that of Hansen et al. (28.Hansen W.J. Cowan N.J. Welch W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) also using Criterion gels, but SDS and β-mercaptoethanol were omitted from both sample and electrophoresis buffers. The gels were run at 4 °C at 0.4 A with an initial voltage of 140 V for 20–30 min and then 180–200 V for the remainder of the run. For autoradiography, the gel was washed twice for 15 min with 50% methanol and 10% acetic acid and then fixed for 5 min with 7% acetic acid, 7% methanol, and 1% glycerol before drying. Dried gels were exposed to film overnight at –80 °C or to a phosphor storage screen for 3–5 days at room temperature. The screen was imaged and analyzed using a GE Healthcare Storm instrument and ImageQuant software. Molecular mass standards for nondenaturing gels were from Amersham Biosciences (high molecular mass calibration kit) and included thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), lactate dehydrogenase (140 kDa), and bovine serum albumin (67 kDa).Immunoblotting—Immunoblotting of gels was performed by transferring the gels to nitrocellulose using either a Bio-Rad Trans-Blot or Trans-Blot SD semidry transfer apparatus (29.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44708) Google Scholar). The antibodies used were the following: rabbit anti-Gβγ antibody BC1 (30.Mullikin-Kilpatrick D. Mehta N.D. Hildebrandt J.D. Treistman S.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 997-1005PubMed Google Scholar); mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG (Sigma); rat monoclonal anti-TCP-1α (Calbiochem); and goat anti-TCP-1α/β/γ/δ/ϵ/θ/η/ζ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). After transfer, the nitrocellulose was blocked with 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Tween 20 (TBST) with 5% nonfat dry milk and 1% bovine serum albumin, and the primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in TBST with 0.5% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% bovine serum. The primary antibody was incubated for 1–3 h and washed extensively, and then the secondary antibody was incubated for 1 h. Blots were visualized using chemiluminescence (SuperSignal West Femto, Pierce). For simultaneous visualization of two antibodies, transfers were blocked with Odyssey blocking buffer (LI-COR Biosciences) and incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-FLAG and goat anti-TCP-1α antibodies diluted in Odyssey blocking buffer (1:1 with TBST containing 0.2% Tween 20). IRDye 700DX-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit and IRDye 800-conjugated donkey anti-goat secondary antibodies (Rockland Immunochemicals, Inc.) were diluted in Odyssey blocking buffer (1:1 with TBST containing 0.01% SDS). Immunoblots were visualized using an Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences).Proteomics Analysis of Samples Recovered after SDS-PAGE—FLAG-tagged Gβ1 was expressed in vitro as described previously (16.Schmidt C.J. Neer E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4538-4544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG beads. Immunoprecipitated protein was eluted from the beads with SDS sample buffer without β-mercaptoethanol and was run on 4–20% Criterion gels. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and destained with 10% acetic acid. Bands were excised with a scalpel and further processed in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences MultiPROBE II HT EX liquid-handling robot equipped with a Millipore Montage In-Gel DigestZP manifold. Gel slices were sequentially equilibrated with 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate and 5% acetonitrile, then with 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate and 50% acetonitrile, and finally with 100% acetonitrile. Protein was digested by reconstituting dehydrated gel slices with 15 μl of 10 μg/ml trypsin in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate and incubating for 3 h at 37°C. Recovered peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF/TOF on an Applied Biosystems 4700 proteomics analyzer. Mass spectra were generated from 3000–5000 laser shots, and the 10 most intense protein peaks were sequenced by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The lower and upper limits of mass detection were 1000 and 3000 Da, respectively. Data were analyzed with an ABI GPS Explorer 3.5 running Mascot Version 1.9.05 for peak identification (31.Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6711) Google Scholar). The minimum signal-to-noise ratio was 10.0, and assignments were based upon a precursor tolerance of 1.0 Da, although most assigned peaks had a tolerance of <0.2 Da. Two data sets were analyzed: one of 4981 records containing all NCBI non-redundant rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) proteins and the other of 163,861 records containing all NCBI non-redundant rodent proteins. Significant matches were identified based upon a Mascot protein score with >95% confidence interval for identification of the protein contained in the library. For the rabbit data base, this included all identified peaks with protein scores >44, whereas for the rodent data base, this included peaks with protein scores >63.RESULTSGβγ Dimer Formation between Gβ Isoforms and FLAG-Gγ3—Gβ1, Gβ2, Gβ3, Gβ4, Gβ5, and FLAG-Gγ3 were synthesized in the reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine (Fig. 1A), and quantitated as described (12.Dingus J. Wells C.A. Campbell L. Cleator J.H. Robinson K. Hildebrandt J.D. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11882-11890Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Gβ and FLAG-Gγ3 were added together at a 2:1 stoichiometry, allowed to form dimers for 2 h at 37°C, and then immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG beads. As shown in Fig. 1B, Gβ1, Gβ2, and Gβ4 were easily co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-Gγ3, indicating that Gβ1γ3, Gβ2γ3, and Gβ4γ3 dimers readily form. In contrast, no Gβ5 was detectable in immunoprecipitates of FLAG-Gγ3 co-incubated with this Gβ, indicating that Gβ5 forms dimers very poorly with Gγ3. In immunoprecipitates with Gβ3, much less Gβ3 was present (relative to Gγ3) than was seen with Gβ1, Gβ2, or Gβ4, but Gβ3 was clearly present as compared with Gβ5 or the control lanes. These results agree with our recent characterization of Gβγ dimer association (12.Dingus J. Wells C.A. Campbell L. Cleator J.H. Robinson K. Hildebrandt J.D. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11882-11890Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), which showed that Gβ1 and Gβ4 readily form dimers with all Gγ isoforms; that Gβ2 selectively forms dimers at good efficiency with most Gγ isoforms, but not Gγ1, Gγ8c, Gγ11, or Gγ13; that Gβ5 does not form dimers in the assay with any Gγ isoforms; and that Gβ3 selectively binds Gγ isoforms, but at a low level even in the best of cases.Analysis of Gβ and Gγ Subunits on Nondenaturing Gels—The inference from our previous work (12.Dingus J. Wells C.A. Campbell L. Cleator J.H. Robinson K. Hildebrandt J.D. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11882-11890Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and from the data in Fig. 1, as well as from analogous experiments with mutants of conserved Asp residues in Gβ (18.Garcia-Higuera I. Gaitatzes C. Smith T. Neer E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9041-9049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), was that other constituents of the reticulocyte lysate interact with Gβ isoforms and are involved in Gβ subunit dimerization with Gγ. Nondenaturing (native) gel analysis was used to identify constituents of the reticulocyte lysate that interact with either Gβ or Gγ. Interpretation of results with nondenaturing gels is more complex than with SDS-polyacrylamide gels because protein migration is determined by multiple properties, including molecular mass, pI, and shape. However, native gels preserve many interactions that would be disrupted with SDS and/or β-mercaptoethanol, and so migration is also affected by formation of protein complexes. Taking all of these factors into account, globular proteins (or complexes) of similar pI will still travel on nondenaturing gels according to their molecular mass (or log molecular mass). This was (approximately) true, for example, for standards used in the characterizing the mobility of Gβ, Gγ, and Gβγ dimers (Fig. 2), where we used a set of globular proteins with pI values of 5.4–6.8. The Gβγ dimer deviates somewhat, but not drastically, from being a globular protein (14.Sondek J. Bohm A. Lambright D.G. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar), and it has a pI dominated by the Gβ component predicted to be between 5.6 and 6.0 for the different isoforms. Thus, our expectation was that the dimer, and perhaps the folded Gβ protein alone, would travel with an apparent molecular mass on nondenaturing gels only slightly greater than its predicted 45 kDa. On the other hand, Gγ alone is small (8 kDa) and of heterogeneous pI among its isoforms and appears to have defined structure based primarily upon its association with Gβ (14.Sondek J. Bohm A. Lambright D.G. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Thus, the behavior of Gγ on nondenaturing gels was less predictable.FIGURE 2Separation of Gγ and Gβ subunits on native (nondenaturing) gels. A, native (nondenaturing) gel of Gγ subunits. Gγ subunits were expressed in the reticulocyte lysate and labeled with [35S]methionine. Samples were run on a nondenaturing 4–15% gradient gel, and the gel was dried and autoradiographed. Arrowheads indicate positions of Gγ; arrows indicate nonspecific bands present in all samples. B, pI values for Gγ. The pI values for the Gγ subunits were predicted using the Compute pI/Mw tool available on the ExPASy proteomics server (available at us.expasy.org/tools/pi_tool.html). C, native (nondenaturing) gel analysis of Gβ subunits. Gβ subunits or FLAG-Gγ3 was expressed in the reticulocyte lysate and labeled with [35S]methionine. Samples were run on a nondenaturing 4–15% gradient gel, and the gel was dried and autoradiographed. Band a, Gβ of high apparent molecular mass; band b, nonspecific band present in all samples; band c, band seen with Gβ1, Gβ2, Gβ3, and Gβ4; band d, nonspecific band present all samples; band e, band specific to Gβ5L; band f, band specific to Gβ5. The gray arrow indicates the top of the gel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)When in vitro translated, 35S-labeled Gγ isoforms were analyzed on native gels (Fig. 2A), they did not travel with similar mobility, as they would on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. In fact, they appeared to segregate primarily according to their pI, as shown in the accompanying graph (Fig. 2B). Those Gγ subunits with a pI near 7, i.e. Gγ2, Gγ3, Gγ4, Gγ8c, Gγ8olf, and Gγ10, migrated in the middle of the gel. Those with a pI <7, i.e. Gγ1, Gγ11, and Gγ13, migrated more rapidly on the gel. And those with a pI >7, i.e. Gγ5, Gγ7, and Gγ12, either did not enter the gel (i.e. Gγ5) or migrated near the top. There were also two non-specific bands that were present in all of the lanes, including the pcDNA control lane (Fig. 2A, arrows). For some Gγ isoforms, for example, Gγ8c, Gγ8o, and Gγ11, two bands were seen. Gγ subunits have post-translational modifications, including by farnesylation or geranylgeranylation at the C terminus and by N-terminal processing that can include removal of methionine and/or acetylation of the N terminus. Variable post-translational modification at these sites, as we have described recently for brain Gγ subunits (32.Cook K.A. Schey K.L. Wilcox M.D. Dingus J. Ettling R. Nelson T. Knapp D.R. Hildebrandt J.D. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2006; 5: 671-685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), may affect the hydrophobicity and/or shape of the Gγ subunits such that their migration on nondenaturing gels is affected.The behavior of Gβ isoforms on native gels (Fig. 2C) was quite different from that of the Gγ isoforms (Fig. 2A). For all the in vitro transcribed Gβ isoforms, 35S-labeled protein accumulated in two primary locations (Fig. 2C): at the top of the native gel, presumably as denatured, aggregated protein of a size too great to enter the gel, and as a sharp, well delineated band at >669 kDa (band a). This band is specific to translation of Gβ and was not found in the pcDNA control or after translation of Gγ (Fig. 2C). There was also some labeled material near the 67-kDa marker that was diffuse for Gβ1, Gβ2, Gβ3, and Gβ4; sharper for Gβ5 (band f); and prominent but diffuse for Gβ5L (band e). This material migrated at a molecular mass slightly larger than expected for Gβ subunits, perhaps representing incompletely folded protein. There were also two non-specific bands (bands b and d), also seen with Gγ (Fig. 2A), and a band of variable intensity at ∼140 kDa (band c), which might be a dimer of the material at ∼60–70 kDa or Gβ complexed with other specific proteins. Most interesting in these samples are the bands at >669 kDa. Because Gβ was the only significantly labeled protein on this gel (see Fig. 1A, for example), the best explanation for band a is that it is Gβ migrating at a very high molecular mass in association with a multiprotein complex. The fact that this is a sharp band supports this idea because denatured and/or aggregated protein either would not enter the gel (as seen at the top) or would have heterogeneous mobility and produce a protein smear, as would incompletely or randomly folded protein.Characterization of the Interaction of Gβ with the Chaperonin CCT/TRiC Complex—The apparent size of the interacting partner on native gels and previous reports that some WD repeat proteins interact with or are folded by CCT/TRiC (19.Valpuesta J.M. Martin-Benito J. Gomez-Puertas P. Carrascosa J.L. Willison K.R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 25.Siegers K. Bolter B. Schwarz J.P. Bottcher U.M.K. Guha S. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5230-5240Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 27.Ho Y. Gruhler A. Heilbut A. Bader G.D. Moore L. Adams S.-L. Millar A. Taylor P. Bennett K. Booutilier K. et al.Nature. 2002; 415: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3054) Google Scholar) suggested that one candidate for the binding partner affecting the mobility of Gβ subunits on native gels is the chaperonin CCT/TRiC complex. The intact CCT/TRiC protein, with an approximate molecular mass of ∼800 kDa, migrates very slowly on a nondenaturing gel (28.Hansen W.J. Cowan N.J. Welch W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 33.Hansen W.J. Ohh M. Moslehi J. Kondo K. Kaelin W.G. Welch W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1947-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This is shown in Fig. 3A, where samples of the reticulocyte lysate with or without expressed proteins (FLAG-Gβ1 and FLAG-Gγ3) were run on a native gel and immunoblotted with an antibody specific for the α-subunit of CCT/TRiC (TCP-1α). All these samples contained a high molecular mass band recognized by anti-TCP-1α antibody at a high molecular mass similar to that seen in the Gβ subunit lanes (Fig. 2). Thus, Gβ synthesized in the reticulocyte lysate migrates on native gels in a region also containing a high molecular mass complex of the CCT/TRiC subunits. To more definitively evaluate whether Gβ and CCT/TRiC co-migrate on nondenaturing gels, we stained the immunoblot with antibodies tagged with infrared dyes that are amenable to double staining of immunoblots (Fig. 4).

https://openalex.org/W2043094609,"A combinatorial phosphotyrosyl (pY) peptide library was screened to determine the amino acid preferences at the pY+4 to pY+6 positions for the four SH2 domains of protein-tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2. Individual binding sequences selected from the library were resynthesized and their binding affinities and specificities to various SH2 domains were further evaluated by SPR studies, stimulation of SHP-1 and SHP-2 phosphatase activity, and in vitro pulldown assays. These studies reveal that binding of a pY peptide to the N-SH2 domain of SHP-2 is greatly enhanced by a large hydrophobic residue (Trp, Tyr, Met, or Phe) at the pY+4 and/or pY+5 positions, whereas binding to SHP-1 N-SH2 domain is enhanced by either hydrophobic or positively charged residues (Arg, Lys, or His) at these positions. Similar residues at the pY+4 to pY+6 positions are also preferred by SHP-1 and SHP-2 C-SH2 domains, although their influence on the overall binding affinities is much smaller compared with the N-SH2 domains. A structural model was generated to qualitatively interpret the contribution of the pY+4 and pY+5 residues to the overall binding affinity. Examination of pY motifs from known SHP-1 and SHP-2-binding proteins shows that many of the pY motifs contain a hydrophobic or positively charged residue(s) at the pY+4 and pY+5 positions.

These domains mediate protein-protein interactions by recognizing phosphorylated tyrosine (pY) residues in proteins and play many different roles in intracellular signaling pathways (1.Machida K. Mayer B.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1747: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Protein-tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 have two adjacent SH2 domains (termed N-SH2 and C-SH2). The two enzymes share highly similar sequences and three-dimensional structures, and yet they have quite different functions in vivo (2.Frearson J.A. Alexander D.R. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 417-427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Neel B.G. Tonks N.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 4.Neel B.G. Gu H. Pao L.

SHP-1, which is mainly expressed in hematopoietic and less in epithelial cells, predominantly acts as a negative regulator of cellular signaling pathways induced by transmembrane receptors such as EpoR, c-Kit, and FcγRIIb1 (5.Yi T.

In contrast, the ubiquitous SHP-2 is a positive regulator in the signal transduction of receptors like insulin receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor and EpoR (2.Frearson J.A.

The association of the N-SH2 domain of SHP-1 or SHP-2 with an activated receptor results in the stimulation of their phosphatase activity. Indeed, both phosphatases exist in an inactive form in the cytosol, with the N-SH2 domain occluding the substrate-binding pocket of the PTP domain. The occupation of the N-SH2 domain with a phosphotyrosine-containing ligand leads to the dissociation of the inactive N-SH2·PTP complex and subsequently to the activation of the enzymes (10.Pei D. Lorenz U. Klingmuller U. Neel B.G. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15483-15493Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Pluskey S. Wandless T.J. Walsh C.T. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol.

It has been assumed that for most SH2 domains, sequence specificity is dictated by the three residues immediately C-terminal to pY (position +1 to +3 relative to pY, which is defined as position 0). Indeed, most of the previous studies on SH2 domain specificity have focused on this minimal recognition motif (pY to pY+3) (13.Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2343) Google Scholar). The sequence specificity of SHP-1 and SHP-2 SH2 domains has previously been determined by using combinatorial libraries (14.Beebe K.D. Wang P. Arabaci G. Pei D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13251-13260Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 15.Sweeney M.C. Wavreille A.-S. Park J. Butchar J. Tridandapani S. Pei D.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9229-9236Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Unlike the classical SH2 domains, SHP-1 and SHP-2 SH2 domains require amino acid residues both N- and C-terminal to pY (positions pY-2 to pY+3) for high affinity binding. The two C-SH2 domains bind pY peptides of a single consensus sequence (T/V/I/y)XpY(A/s/t/v)X(I/V/L), which is also recognized by the two N-SH2 domains. In addition, the N-SH2 domain of SHP-1 binds to a second consensus LXpY(M/F)X(F/M) (class II), whereas the SHP-2 N-SH2 domain can bind to four other distinct classes of sequences (classes II-V) (14.Beebe K.D. Wang P. Arabaci G. Pei D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13251-13260Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 15.Sweeney M.C. Wavreille A.-S. Park J. Butchar J. Tridandapani S. Pei D. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 14932-14947Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). There is accumulating evidence that residues beyond pY+3 may also significantly affect the binding affinity and specificity of SH2 domains. Case et al. (17.Case R.D. Piccione E. Wolf G. Benett A.M. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10467-10474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that a 9-mer peptide (LNpYIDLDLV) derived from IRS-1 pY1172 bound SHP-2 N-SH2 domain more tightly than hexapeptide NpYIDLD. It is now clear that the shorter peptide is missing an important hydrophobic residue at position pY-2. However, the residues at pY+4 to pY+6 positions also contribute to the tighter binding of the 9-mer peptide. Similarly, a longer peptide corresponding to platelet-derived growth factor receptor pY1009 (DTSSVLpYTAVQPNE) bound to SHP-2 SH2 domain with a 2-fold higher affinity than a shorter peptide (VLpYTAV) (18.Huyer G. Li Z.M. Adam M. Huckle W.R. Ramachandran C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1040-1049Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Huyer G. Ramachandran C.

Structure. 1994; 2: 423-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further evidence for a potential involvement of residue pY+5 in binding to the N-SH2 domain of SHP-2 came from studies on the consensus binding motifs of the SH2 domains of SOCS-3 and SHP-2 (16.De Souza D. Fabri L.J. Nash A. Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A. Baca M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9229-9236Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Screening of a peptide library suggested that the N-SH2 domain of SHP-2 prefers an aromatic residue (Trp and Phe) at pY+5. Previous studies with SHP-1 showed a similar involvement of the C-terminal residues outside the region pY-2 to pY+3 for high affinity binding (10.Pei D. Lorenz U. Klingmuller U. Neel B.G. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15483-15493Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Klingmuller U. Lorenz U. Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1995; 80: 729-738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar).The above data clearly demonstrate the important contributions of residues outside the pY-2 to pY+3 region to the binding affinity of SHP-1 and SHP-2 SH2 domains. However, to the best of our knowledge, a systematic study of the sequence specificity at positions from pY+4 and beyond has not been carried out. Also, a comparison of the specificities of SHP-1 and SHP-2 SH2 domains for these positions has not been described, although this could be crucial for understanding their distinct, yet overlapping, specificities. In this work, a peptide library has been designed and screened against the four SH2 domains of SHP-1 and SHP-2 to systematically assess the sequence specificity at pY+4 to pY+6 positions. The results show that the two N-SH2 domains strongly prefer a large hydrophobic or positively charged residue at these positions, whereas the C-SH2 domains have broader specificity.MATERIALS AND METHODSSynthesis of the pY Library—The library was prepared by manual solid-phase peptide synthesis using Fmoc/tert-butyl chemistry on 2.5 g of 90-μm TentaGel S NH2 resin of a loading capacity of 0.3 mmol/g (Advanced ChemTech, Louisville, KY). A standard procedure with double couplings in the presence of a 4-fold excess of Fmoc-amino acid, O-benzotriazole-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate, and N-hydroxybenzotriazole and an 8-fold excess of diisopropylethylamine in N,N-dimethylformamide was used, as described previously (15.Sweeney M.C. Wavreille A.-S. Park J. Butchar J. Tridandapani S. Pei D. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 14932-14947Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To distinguish isobaric amino acids during peptide sequencing by mass spectrometry, Ac-Gly (5%) was added to the coupling reactions of Leu and Lys, and Ac-Ala (5%) was added to the coupling reaction of norleucine (22.Sweeney M.C. Pei D. J. Comb. Chem. 2003; 5: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Individual peptides were synthesized on 70 mg of Rink resin with a loading capacity of 0.2 mmol/g (Advanced ChemTech, Louisville, KY). A biotin and a linker was added to the N terminus using Fmoc-8-amino-3,6-dioxooctanoic acid and biotin as described elsewhere (23.Imhof D. Nothmann D. Zoda M.S. Hampel K. Wegert J. Böhmer F.D. Reissmann S. J. Pept. Sci. 2005; 11: 390-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The peptides were cleaved from the resin using 1 ml of 95% trifluoroacetic acid and 150 μl of reagent K (0.5 ml of thioanisole, 0.25 ml of ethanedithiol, and 0.75 g of phenol) for 2-3 h at room temperature. The products were precipitated in cold diethyl ether and lyophilized. Finally, all peptides were purified by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography on a Waters™ 600 system (Milford, MA) equipped with a Vydac 218TP column (5-μm particle size, 300-Å pore size, 4.6 × 25 mm). The identity of final products was confirmed by analysis on a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Bruker Reflex III) in an automated manner using α-hydroxycinnamic acid as the matrix.Protein Expression and Purification—All SH2 domains used in the library screening were fusion proteins with the maltosebinding protein (MBP-SH2). The MBP-SH2 proteins were biotinylated prior to use. Binding studies by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) were performed with isolated SH2 domains containing an N- or C-terminal His6 tag. Expression, purification, and biotinylation of all of these SH2 proteins were previously described (15.Sweeney M.C. Wavreille A.-S. Park J. Butchar J. Tridandapani S. Pei D. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 14932-14947Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Full-length SHP-1 and SHP-2 were also expressed and purified as previously described (10.Pei D. Lorenz U. Klingmuller U. Neel B.G. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15483-15493Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Pei D. Wang J. Walsh C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1141-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). pY Library Screening—The screening of the pY library was performed according to Sweeney et al. (15.Sweeney M.C. Wavreille A.-S. Park J. Butchar J. Tridandapani S. Pei D. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 14932-14947Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In four independent experiments, 30-50 mg of the pY library were extensively washed with dichloromethane, methanol, double-distilled H2O, and HBST buffer (30 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.01% Tween 20) and blocked for 1 h using HBST buffer containing 0.1% gelatin. Incubation with different concentrations of a biotinylated MBP-SH2 domain (0.5-2.0 nm final concentration) was performed for 4-16 h at 4 °C. Biotinylated MBP protein was used in the control experiment. After treatment with streptavidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase and staining using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate, the resin was extensively washed with water. Beads with the highest color intensity were selected manually under a dissecting microscope and sequenced by partial Edman degradation/mass spectrometry (15.Sweeney M.C. Wavreille A.-S. Park J. Butchar J. Tridandapani S. Pei D. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 14932-14947Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 22.Sweeney M.C. Pei D. J. Comb. Chem. 2003; 5: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).Stimulation of Phosphatase Activity—Stimulation of SHP-1 and SHP-2 activities was measured using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate (10.Pei D. Lorenz U. Klingmuller U. Neel B.G. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15483-15493Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Pei D. Wang J. Walsh C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1141-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The assay reaction (total volume of 50 μl) contained 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm tris(carboxyethyl)phosphine, 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 0-500 μm pY peptide, and 0.5 μg of SHP-1 or 5 μg of SHP-2. The reaction was initiated by the addition of SHP-1 (or SHP-2) as the last component and allowed to proceed at room temperature for 30 min. The reaction was quenched by adding 950μ l of 1 m NaOH. The absorbance at 405 nm was measured on a PerkinElmer Lambda 20 UV-visible spectrophotometer. The SHP-1 (or SHP-2) reactivity reported was relative to that of SHP-1 (or SHP-2) in the absence of pY peptide. All measurements were carried out in duplicate, and the results are given as the average of two independent experiments.Affinity Measurement by SPR—The binding affinity of pY peptides to the SH2 domains of SHP-1 and SHP-2 was assessed by SPR analysis on a BIAcore 3000 instrument (Amersham Biosciences). Biotinylated pY peptides were immobilized on streptavidin-coated SA5 biosensor chips. Prior to immobilization, the sensor chip was conditioned with a solution containing 1 m NaCl and 50 mm NaOH (aqueous) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The binding assays were conducted at room temperature in Hepes-buffered saline-EP buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% polysorbate 20). Each pY peptide (3-5 μl) was injected at a flow rate of 15 μl/min until a suitable and constant level of response units (400-500 RU) was obtained. Varying concentrations of histidine-tagged SH2 proteins (0.05-5.0 μm) were passed over the immobilized peptides for 2 min. To remove the protein from the peptide, a regeneration buffer (10 mm NaOH, 200 mm NaCl, 0.05% SDS) was applied. The equilibrium response unit (RUeq) at a given SH2 protein concentration was obtained by subtracting the response of the blank flow cell from the flow cells containing the pY peptide. The dissociation constants (KD values) were calculated using the equation, RUeq=RUmax[SH2]/(KD+[SH2]) where RUeq is the measured response unit at a given SH2 domain concentration, and RUmax is the maximum response unit.In Vitro Pulldown Assay—Raw 264.7 murine macrophage cells were lysed in TN1 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 10 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 125 mm NaCl, 10 mm Na3VO4, and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin). Nuclei were removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C. Equal amounts of protein from each sample were incubated overnight with 5 μg of a biotinylated pY peptide at 4 °C. Streptavidin-agarose beads were added to the samples, which were then incubated for 1 hat 4°C. Beads were washed twice with TN1 buffer and boiled in SDS sample buffer (60 mm Tris pH 6.8, 2.3% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol) for 5 min, and the eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Following separation, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and then incubated with anti-SHP-1, anti-SHP-2, or anti-SHIP antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After washing, the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, washed again, and briefly incubated in ECL (Amersham Biosciences) for chemiluminescent detection on x-ray film. The assays were repeated twice. For binding competition, cell lysates were prepared as described above and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 5 μg each of biotinylated wild-type FcγRIIb1 peptide and a nonbiotinylated wild-type or mutant peptide as competitor. Streptavidin-agarose beads were added to the samples and incubated for 1 h at 4°C. Electrophoresis and Western blot analysis were performed as described above. The competition experiments were repeated three times.Molecular Modeling—All structural models were generated based on the crystal structure of SHP-2 N-SH2 domain in complex with peptide SVLpYTAVQP (Protein Data Bank code 1aya) (20.Lee C.H. Kominos D. Jaques S. Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Shoelson S.E. Kuriyan J. Structure. 1994; 2: 423-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two separate modeling strategies were employed. In the first sequential method, the last two residues of the peptide in the Protein Data Bank 1aya structure were replaced by a Trp residue (position pY+4) using the SPDBV program (25.Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9025) Google Scholar). Several different sterically possible starting structures with different side chain conformations of the Trp residue were generated (using SPDBV). These structures served as the starting structures for energy minimization and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (20-40 ps at 310 K) using the Amber8 program package (26.Case D.A. Pearlman D.A. Caldwell J.W. Cheatham III, T.E. Ross W.S. Simmerling C.L. Darden T.A. Merz K.M. Stanton R.V. Cheng A.L. Vincent J.J. Crowley M. Tsui V. Radmer R.J. Duan Y. Pitera J. Massova I. Seibel G.L. Singh U.C. Weiner P.K. Kollman P.A. Amber 8. University of California, San Francisco, CA2003Google Scholar) and employing a generalized Born continuum solvent model (27.Hawkins G.D. Cramer C.J. Truhlar D.G. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1995; 246: 122-129Crossref Scopus (545) Google Scholar). After the MD, the structures were again energy-minimized. During the energy minimization and MD simulations, the Trp residue was completely free to move; however, the rest of the structure was weakly restrained to the coordinates in the experimental structure (force constant: 0.05 kcal mol−1Å−2). This weak restraint in principle allows adjustment of the structure by up to 1-2 Å from the x-ray structure. The lowest energy structure of the search nicely filled a cavity between loops 65-68 and 87-94, respectively. Based on the coordinates of this structure, two more residues were added (Phe and Ala) at the C terminus using SPDBV. The resulting structure was energy-minimized and subjected to an MD simulation and subsequent energy minimization as described above. An independent “direct” modeling strategy was also employed by adding the three residues (WFA) at once at the C terminus of the minimal sequence and performing a replica exchange MD simulation (as implemented in Amber8) (26.Case D.A. Pearlman D.A. Caldwell J.W. Cheatham III, T.E. Ross W.S. Simmerling C.L. Darden T.A. Merz K.M. Stanton R.V. Cheng A.L. Vincent J.J. Crowley M. Tsui V. Radmer R.J. Duan Y. Pitera J. Massova I. Seibel G.L. Singh U.C. Weiner P.K. Kollman P.A. Amber 8. University of California, San Francisco, CA2003Google Scholar) using the same restraints and continuum solvent model as described above and using the following range of simulation temperatures. A very similar final low energy structure was obtained using this alternative modeling strategy.RESULTSDesign, Synthesis, and Screening of pY Library—We constructed a pY peptide library (AAX1NpYX2QX3X4X5X6LNBBRM-resin) that contains partially randomized positions at pY-2(X1 represents Leu, Ile, Val, or Thr), pY+1(X2 represents Ala, Thr, or Val), and pY+3(X3 represents Leu, Ile, or Val), and completely randomized positions at pY+4 to pY+6(X4-X6 represent l-norleucine or 18 proteinogenic l-amino acids except for Met and Cys; B represents β-alanine). An LNBBRM linker was added at the C terminus to facilitate mass spectrometric analysis (positively charged Arg) and cleavage from the resin (after Met with CNBr) (15.Sweeney M.C. Wavreille A.-S. Park J. Butchar J. Tridandapani S. Pei D. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 14932-14947Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The amino acids at the partially randomized positions were chosen according to the type I consensus sequences for the SH2 domains of SHP-1 and SHP-2 (14.Beebe K.D. Wang P. Arabaci G. Pei D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13251-13260Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 15.Sweeney M.C. Wavreille A.-S. Park J. Butchar J. Tridandapani S. Pei D. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 14932-14947Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Asn and Gln were fixed at the pY-1 and pY+2 positions, respectively, because they are tolerated at these positions by all four SH2 domains. The theoretical diversity of the library is 2.47 × 105. Since all of the library members contain the most preferred residues at critical positions (pY-2, pY+1, and pY+3), we anticipated that, given sufficiently high concentration, the SH2 domains would bind to most (if not all) of the beads. In order to identify sequences with the highest affinities to the SH2 domains and thus define the sequence specificity at pY+4 to pY+6 positions, lower concentrations of SH2 proteins (0.5-2.0 nm) were used in the current screening than in previous screenings (10-50 nm) (15.Sweeney M.C. Wavreille A.-S. Park J. Butchar J. Tridandapani S. Pei D. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 14932-14947Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Typically, 150 mg of the library (∼4.3 × 105 beads) were screened against each SH2 domain (usually in several batches), resulting in 100-150 intensely colored beads. These positive beads were isolated from the library and sequenced by partial Edman degradation/mass spectrometry (15.Sweeney M.C. Wavreille A.-S. Park J. Butchar J. Tridandapani S. Pei D.

Chem. 2003; 5: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).Sequence Specificity of SHP-1 and SHP-2 SH2 Domains at pY+4 to pY+6 Positions—A total of 361 peptide sequences were obtained for the four SH2 domains (Table 1). For the vast majority of the peptides, their amino acid sequences were unambiguously determined at all positions. A small fraction of the peptides had some ambiguities at one or more positions from pY-2 to pY+3; these positions are indicated by an X in Table 1. It is clear from these sequences that all four SH2 domains exhibit sequence specificity at positions pY+4 to pY+6, especially at the pY+4 and pY+5 positions. In general, the analysis showed that the SH2 domains share common structural features but also have clear differences.TABLE 1SH2 domain-binding sequences selected from the pY librarySHP-1SHP-2N-SH2C-SH2N-SH2C-SH2TQLWFGAQLIDETQVHFMTQVWYEAQLRNKVQLWYGAQLMFHAQLWYGVQLRFPAQLWFGAQLIFPTQLHLATQLWWYVQLRNRVQLWYGAQLMFP*AQVWYRAQIRHAVQLWYGAQLIKMTQVHWAAQVWHMTQVRRFAQLWYGAQLMFPAQLWFGVQIRHFAQLWYG*AQLIWSAQIHRRTQLWHRTQVRRFVQLWYGAQVMFPAQIWFGAQIRHFAQIWYPVQLLDSAQIHRRAQVWHRTQIRRFVQLWYGAQLMFSAQIWFGAQVRHHAQLWWGAQLLHTTQIHRRAQVWHRVQVRRFAQLWYNAQIMNHAQLWFGAQLRHHAQVWHRAQVLKGAQIHRRTQIWHRTQVRRKAQVWYRAQLMWPAQVWWRAQIRHQAQLWHR*AQLLKLTQLHRHAQIWHRAQIRRNAQLWFAAQVMYPAQIWWYAQIRHRAQLWHRTQVLKSVQVHRHTQLWKQTQLRRQAQLWFAAQLLFPTQLWIGAQIRHVAQLWHRAQLLRMTQLHRHTQVWRHTQVRRQAQLWFGAQVLHNAQIWHATQIRHYAQVWHKXQILYWVQIHKHTQVWRHTQVRRRTQLWFGAQLLRQTQLWHHAQIRHYAQIWHTAQVMKYTQVHKHTQVWRHAQLRRSAQLWFPVQVVGQAQLWHHAQLRNMAQIWHTAQIVHAVQLHKIAQVWRRTQLRRYAQLWFPVQIVHQVQIWHHTQVRRIAQVWHTAQVVKTAQLHKFTQLWRRAQIRRYAQLWFPTQIITAAQLWHNTQIRRRAQLWHTTQIVTGAQVHNFTQLWRRTQLRWHVQLWWHTQITGSAQIWHNTQLRWHAQLWHSAQIHPHAQIYHRTQIRWHXQVWVIVQLAHNVQIWHQTQVRWHAQIWHSTQVRFRAQLHPQAQIYHRTQIRYHAQLWTEAQVAHVAQVWHRTQVRWRTQLWHSVQVRGPVQVHPQTQLYHRTQLRYHTQVWSRAQLAWHTQVWHRAQIRYRAQIWHPAQIRHKTQIHPQTQVYHRTQVRYKVQLWHAVQVAYEAQIWHRTQLRYYAQLWRRXQIRHNAQLHPYTQLYHRTQIRYNTQIWHGVQLSHVAQIWHRAQVHHRAQVWRRTQIRHRAQLHPYTQIYHRTQIRYRVQIWHGVQLSWYAQIWHRTQLHHRAQLWRRVQIRHVTQVHPYTQVYKRTQLRYRVQLWHKAQLDFGTQVWHRAQVHKHAQLWKGVQIRHYTQLYRRAQIRYYTQLWHRVQLDFSAQIWHSTQIHKHTQIWTRAQLRIKAQIDVLAQIYRRAQLKHGAQLWHRAQLDFTAQLWHTAQVHKHAQVYYGAQVRLGVQIGGAAQIYRRTQIKHHVQVWHRXQVENIAQIWHTAQVHRHAQVYFHTQVRNHAQIGYAAQVYRYAQLKHRVQVWHSVQIKHNAQIWHWTQVHRHAQLYWPVQVRPDTQLPRITQLYRYTQLKHRVQLWHTTQLNWHAQIWHYTQLHRHAQIYWPTQIRRFAQVPRMAQVFFRTQVKHYAQLWDTAQIRFPAQVYHHTQVHRHTQLYWGAQVRRF*VQVPWGAQVFHRTQVKRAAQLWNPTQVHFGAQIYHRTQVHRHVQVYHRTQIRRFAQVPYKAQIFRRAQVKRYAQLWRRVQLHFPAQIYHRTQIHRHXQVYHRAQLRRHTQLQKITQVFRYVQLKRYAQLYFPTQLHHRAQIYHRTQVHRHTQVYHRAQVRRHAQLQSQTQVFRYAQLKVHTQLYFPAQIHKHAQVYHRAQVHRRAQVYHAAQIRRKAQLSRRAQLVPFTQLKYATQLYFPAQVHRRAQVYHRTQIHRRVQVYHPAQIRRKAQVTRNAQIMHRTQIKYHXQXYFRAQIHWGAQIYHYTQVHRRAQIYHYTQIRTLAQLTWNAQIAQSTQLKYRVQLYGGTQLHWRTQVYRRIQVDTSTQVYHVAQLRWFTQVAYEAQLKYYTQIYHKAQVYRRAQIEMQVQVYRRTQIRWRTQLRFHAQLHRH*XQVYMAAQVFHRVQLEPRVQVYRRAQIRYLTQLRFPAQIHRHTQVYPFAQIVHRVQLETRTQVYRRAQVKAWTQLRFRAQIHRHVQVYQAAQIVHYAQIQHYTQIYRRXQIKIGAQLRHGAQVHRHTQIYTPTQVTRPAQVQWLXQVFPRAQLKNHTQIRHGAQLHRHVQIYWLAQIMHHAQINKEAQIFHRAQLKRLAQLRHKTQLHRRTQIYWPAQIMHYAQLFHFAQVKRRTQLRHQTQLHRRAQLFKIVQIMIGAQIFHNXQXKVNTQLRHRTQVHRRXQLFWPVQLLELAQLFRRAQLKWGTQLRHRVQVHRRTQLFWPAQIIHYTQIFRGAQLKWWTQIRHRTQIHRRAQVIHYAQIFGKTQVRHYAQLHRRAQVIHYTQIRHYTQIHRRAQIAHYAQIRKYTQVHRY Open table in a new tab The N-SH2 domain of SHP-1 strongly prefers a large hydrophobic (Trp, Tyr, Phe, Leu, or Ile) or positively charged residue (Arg, Lys, or His) at the pY+4 position (Table 1 and Fig. 1). Approximately 80% of the selected peptides contained a hydrophobic aromatic residue (Trp > Tyr >> Phe) or a basic amino acid (His, Arg >> Lys) at this position. A similar set of residues was also selected at pY+5 position, although positively charged residues (Arg, Lys, and His) appear to be more favorable than hydrophobic ones (Trp, Tyr, Phe, and Pro). At the pY+6 position, a wide variety of amino acids were accepted, with some preference for a positively charged residue (Arg, Lys, or His). Note that the combination of residues preferred at pY+4 to pY+6 positions is not random. Whereas certain combinations such as W(Y/F)G, WH(R/K), WH(T/S), YRR, RR(F/H/K), and HR(R/H) appeared many times, other more probable combinations, such as RRR, WWR, HHR, FFG, and FYG, were not observed at all. This underscores the importance of obtaining individual sequences.Like the SHP-1 N-SH2 domain, the N-SH2 domain of SHP-2 strongly prefers hydrophobic aromatic residues (e.g. Trp, Tyr, and Phe) at the pY+4 and pY+5 positions (Table"

Human tRNALys3 is used as the primer for HIV reverse transcription, and HIV Gag and GagPol are required for packaging of the tRNA into virions. Human lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS) is also specifically packaged into HIV, suggesting a role for LysRS in tRNA packaging. Gag alone is sufficient for packaging of LysRS, and these two proteins have been shown to interact in vitro using glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays. In vitro pull-down assays using truncated constructs have also revealed that residues important for homodimerization of Gag and LysRS are critical for the Gag/LysRS interaction. In this work, we report further in vitro characterization of the interaction between HIV Gag and human LysRS using affinity pull-down assays, fluorescence anisotropy measurements and gel chromatography. An equilibrium binding constant of 310 ± 80 nm was measured for the Gag/LysRS interaction. We also show that capsid alone binds to LysRS with a similar affinity as full-length Gag. Point mutations that disrupt the homodimerization of LysRS and Gag in vitro do not affect their interaction. These results suggest that dimerization of each protein per se is not required for the interaction but that residues involved in forming the homodimer interfaces contribute to heterodimer formation.

Coffin J.M. Hughes S.M. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1997: 27-69Google Scholar). Once in the cytoplasm of the host cell, the single-stranded viral RNA is reverse-transcribed into double-stranded DNA. Host-encoded tRNALys3 is the primer used by HIV-1 for initiation of reverse transcription (2Jiang M. Mak J. Ladha A. Cohen E. Klein M. Rovinski B. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3246-3253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Newly synthesized proviral DNA translocates into the nucleus and is integrated into the host chromosomal DNA. Transcription of viral DNA yields spliced and unspliced mRNAs, progeny RNA genomes, and viral proteins. Among these viral proteins are two large precursor proteins, Gag and GagPol, both of which are translated from the same full-length viral RNA (3Swanstrom R. Wills J.W. Coffin J.M. Hughes S.M. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1997: 263-334Google Scholar). During viral maturation, Gag is processed into the mature viral proteins: matrix, capsid (CA), and nucleocapsid. GagPol processing yields the mature HIV-1 enzymes: protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase. In the last step of the viral life cycle, Gag, GagPol, genomic RNA, and specific host cell components assemble at plasma membranes and are eventually released from the cell. Human tRNALys3, one of the three major tRNALys isoacceptors, is used as the primer for reverse transcription in HIV-1, although all three isoacceptors are selectively packaged into the newly forming virion (2Jiang M. Mak J. Ladha A. Cohen E. Klein M. Rovinski B. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3246-3253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Mak J. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8087-8095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous work has shown that packaging of tRNALys requires GagPol (5Mak J. Jiang M. Wainberg M.A. Hammarskjold M.L. Rekosh D. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2065-2072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as well as human lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS), which is also selectively packaged into HIV-1 (6Cen S. Khorchid A. Javanbakht H. Gabor J. Stello T. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 5043-5048Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). LysRS can be packaged into viral-like particles composed only of Gag, suggesting that interactions with Gag are both necessary and sufficient for LysRS incorporation (6Cen S. Khorchid A. Javanbakht H. Gabor J. Stello T. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 5043-5048Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Human LysRS is a class II synthetase, belonging to a closely related subgroup (IIb) with aspartyl- and asparginyl-tRNA synthetases (7Eriani G. Delarue M. Poch O. Gangloff J. Moras D. Nature. 1990; 347: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar, 8Eriani G. Dirheimer G. Gangloff J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 7109-7118Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of Escherichia coli LysRS (9Onesti S. Miller A.D. Brick P. Structure (Lond.). 1995; 3: 163-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and Thermus thermophilus LysRS (10Cusack S. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6321-6334Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) have been solved. LysRS is a homodimer, with each monomer consisting of an N-terminal anti-codon binding domain, a dimerization domain formed by motif 1, and motifs 2 and 3 that together constitute the aminoacylation active site. LysRS is one of the most highly conserved synthetases, and sequence alignments suggest that prokaryotic and eukaryotic LysRSs are structurally very related (11Shiba K. Stello T. Motegi H. Noda T. Musier-Forsyth K. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22809-22816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Using wild-type (WT) and truncated HIV-1 Gag and LysRS variants, the regions critical for the protein-protein interaction have been mapped using in vitro glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays and in vivo LysRS packaging studies (12Javanbakht H. Halwani R. Cen S. Saadatmand J. Musier-Forsyth K. Gottlinger H. Kleiman L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27644-27651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The Gag/LysRS interaction depends on Gag sequences within the C-terminal domain (CTD) of CA and amino acids 208-259 in motif 1 of LysRS. Interestingly, these two regions contain elements involved in the formation of the dimerization interface of each protein. This suggests either that dimerization is critical for the interaction or that monomer units of each protein interact to form a heterodimeric Gag/LysRS complex. In this report, we attempt to distinguish between these alternative models by constructing point mutants to disrupt homodimerization of LysRS and Gag. We characterize the interaction of WT and mutant proteins using in vitro affinity pull-down assays, fluorescence anisotropy, and gel chromatography. We also characterize the binding between LysRS and CA. Taken together, the results of this study lead to a refined model for the HIV-1 tRNALys-packaging complex. Plasmid Construction—Plasmid pM368 was constructed by cloning a 1.8-kbp fragment from pM116 into pKS583, a derivative of pET19b (11Shiba K. Stello T. Motegi H. Noda T. Musier-Forsyth K. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22809-22816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The resultant plasmid produces a fusion protein that contains the N-terminal MRGSHHHHHHHSSGWVD sequence appended to full-length (1-597 amino acids) human LysRS and contains the genes conferring ampicillin and chloram-phenicol resistance. The triple mutant (E265A,R247A,F283A) LysRS (Mut-LysRS) was constructed using the QuikChange™ mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) and the following primers: R247A, 5′-GTGATGATCTTAGACGCGATGATAAATTTCTGCCTCAC-3′;E265A, 5′-CATGGGAGTTTCAATCGCTAGGAATCCCAGCTC-3′; and F283A, 5′-GTTGTGATAAGTGATCGCAGGCTTGGCCACGGC-3′. The LysRS mutants were transformed into BL21(DE3) RIL-competent cells and screened by sequencing the entire gene, which also confirmed that no additional mutations were introduced during PCR. Protein Purification—The following proteins were purified according to previously published procedures: T7 RNA polymerase (13Ellinger T. Ehricht R. BioTechniques. 1998; 24: 718-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), human prolyl-tRNA synthetase (ProRS) (14Forsyth C.J. Heacock D. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Bioorg. Chem. 1996; 24: 273-289Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and human LysRS (11Shiba K. Stello T. Motegi H. Noda T. Musier-Forsyth K. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22809-22816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). HIV-1 Δp6-Gag (Gag) and W317A/M318A mutant HIV-1 Δp6-Gag (WM-Gag) were prepared according to a previously published protocol (15Campbell S. Vogt V.M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4425-4435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Campbell S. Rein A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2270-2279Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except that buffer A consisted of 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 750 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME), 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride, 400 μm ZnCl2, and 10% v/v glycerol. Mut-LysRS was prepared following the protocol for WT human LysRS (11Shiba K. Stello T. Motegi H. Noda T. Musier-Forsyth K. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22809-22816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The plasmid encoding histidine-tagged human TrpRS on a pET20b vector was a gift from Dr. Paul Schimmel (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). BL21(DE3) cells transformed with the TrpRS expression vector were grown in LB containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C. Protein expression was induced at an A600 nm of 0.4-0.6 by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the purification was performed on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) resin (Qiagen) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8. TrpRS was eluted from the column using an imidazole gradient (30-250 mm) with TrpRS eluting at 100 mm imidazole. Purified TrpRS was then dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline, concentrated, and diluted to 50% glycerol for storage at -80 °C. The final storage conditions were 10 mm NaPO4, pH 7.4, 1.5 mm KPO4, 3 mm KCl, 137 mm NaCl, and 50% glycerol. The plasmid encoding HIV-1 CA (WISP98-85) was a gift from Dr. Wesley Sundquist (University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT). The expression and purification of CA was adapted from Sundquist and co-workers (17Yoo S. Myszka D.G. Yeh C. McMurray M. Hill C.P. Sundquist W.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 780-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). BL21(DE3) cells transformed with the CA expression vector were grown in medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C. CA protein expression was induced at an A600 nm of 0.8 by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm for 4 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the remaining steps were performed at 4 °C. Cells were resuspended in buffer B containing 20 mm KMOPS, pH 6.9, 5 mm β-ME, and two Complete mini protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied Science). Following sonication, cells were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. CA was precipitated with 20% ammonium sulfate and exchanged into buffer B by dialysis using a 10,000 molecular weight cut off Slide-A-Lyzer cassette (Pierce). Purification was achieved by cation-exchange chromatography using SP-Sepharose resin (Amersham Biosciences). CA was eluted using a 250-ml linear salt gradient (0-1 m NaCl) in buffer B. The purified protein, which typically eluted at 300 mm NaCl, was exchanged into 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, and 5 mm β-ME. The concentrations of all proteins were determined by the Bradford method using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit and bovine serum albumin as the standard (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar). Fluorophore Labeling of Proteins—A solution of Alexa Fluor® 488 C5 maleimide (AF) from Molecular Probes was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide, and the concentration was determined using the extinction coefficient supplied by the manufacturer (ϵ493 nm = 77,100 m-1 cm-1). Prior to labeling, LysRS, Mut-LysRS, or TrpRS were first incubated at room temperature for 15 min followed by elution through a 1-ml G50 Sephadex spin column to remove dithiothreitol. The proteins (40 μm) were labeled with AF at a 10:1 AF:protein ratio for 5 min on ice in 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 40 mm KCl. The reaction was quenched, and unreacted dye was removed by passing the labeling reaction through two 1-ml G50 Sephadex spin columns. HIV-1 CA was labeled similarly, using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). The concentration of the stock solution of FITC in dimethyl formamide was determined at pH >9 using the extinction coefficient ϵ494 nm = 73,000 m-1 cm-1. The final labeling reaction was incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The final labeling stoichiometries for LysRS:AF, TrpRS:AF, Mut-LysRS:AF, and CA:FITC were estimated to be 2:1, 2:1, 1.5:1, and 1:1.6 fluorophore:protein, respectively. These values were determined by measuring the absorbance at 494 nm and using the extinction coefficients of the free fluorophores. Protein concentrations were estimated using the Bradford method (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar). Samples were also subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Ultraviolet illumination of the gels confirmed that our final labeled products had little or no free fluorophore. tRNALys3 Preparation and Aminoacylation Activity—Un-modified WT tRNALys3 was prepared by in vitro transcription from FokI-digested plasmid pLYSF119 using T7 RNA polymerase as described previously (11Shiba K. Stello T. Motegi H. Noda T. Musier-Forsyth K. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22809-22816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The extinction coefficient of 604,000 m-1 cm-1 was used to determine the concentration of all the tRNAs. Aminoacylation assays to test the activity of unlabeled and labeled LysRS and Mut-LysRS proteins were conducted as described previously (11Shiba K. Stello T. Motegi H. Noda T. Musier-Forsyth K. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22809-22816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). For WT LysRS and LysRS: AF488, assays contained 25 nm LysRS and tRNALys3 concentrations of 0.5 and 1.0 μm, respectively. For Mut-LysRS, protein concentrations ranged from 0.025 to 1 μm, and tRNALys3 concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 2 μm were used. Electrophoretic Band-shift Assay—The interaction between WT LysRS or Mut-LysRS and human tRNALys3 was measured using an electro-phoretic band-shift assay. Dephosphorylation and 5′-32P-end labeling of the tRNALys3 was performed using a modification of the method described earlier (19Isel C. Ehresmann C. Keith G. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 236-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Prior to 5′-end labeling, 20 μg of unmodified tRNALys3 was denatured for 2 min at 90 °C, cooled on ice, and incubated for 1 h at 60 °C with four units of bacterial alkaline phosphatase in 25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8, 0.1% SDS, and 25% formamide. The dephosphorylated tRNA was then phenol/chloroform-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and 5′-32P-end-labeled by incubation with 30 units of phage T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and 100 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at 37 °C in the buffer supplied by the manufacturer. Labeled tRNA was purified by electrophoresis on a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Labeled tRNALys3 (4.5 μm) was incubated with different concentrations of either WT LysRS or Mut-LysRS (0.15, 0.375, 0.75, or 1.5 μm) in 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol for 20 min at room temperature and analyzed by electrophoresis at 4 °C on a 5% Tris-borate-EDTA non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel prepared with 0.25× Tris-borate-EDTA (22.5 mm Tris·borate and 0.25 mm EDTA) and 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA running buffer. The gels were visualized using a Bio-Rad molecular imager FX, and band densities of free and bound tRNALys3 were determined using Quantity One software. Equilibrium binding constants were determined by fitting these data to a standard hyperbolic curve using Kaleidagraph. Gel Chromatography—The oligomeric states of WT LysRS and Mut-LysRS in the absence of Gag were initially monitored by size-exclusion chromatography using a Superose 12 column (Amersham Biosciences) attached to an Amersham Biosciences fast performance liquid chromatography (FPLC) system. The mobile phase was 50 mm NaPO4, pH7, 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm β-ME. The column was calibrated using molecular mass markers ranging from 13.7 to 440 kDa (Amersham Biosciences). A 2.5 μm solution of WT LysRS or Mut-LysRS was loaded onto the column, and protein absorbance at 280 nm was monitored. The monomer-dimer equilibrium of WT LysRS and Mut-LysRS was analyzed by elution through a Bio-Sil 250-5 size-exclusion column (Bio-Rad) attached to a Beckman high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system. The mobile phase was 50 mm NaPO4, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl. The column was calibrated using gel chromatography molecular weight mass ranging from 1.35 to 670 kDa (Bio-Rad). To estimate monomer-dimer equilibrium dissociation constants, solutions of each protein ranging from 0.5 to 20 μm were loaded onto the column, and protein absorbance at 280 nm was monitored. The areas under the monomer and dimer peaks were quantified using Beckman PACE 32 Karat software version 4.0, and the peak ratios were plotted versus Mut-LysRS concentration. The Kd was assumed to be the concentration at which we observed a 1:1 ratio of monomer to dimer peaks. The interaction between LysRS and Gag was analyzed by size-exclusion FPLC carried out at 4 °C using a Superose 12 column (Amersham Biosciences). The mobile phase was 50 mm NaPO4, pH 7, and 150 mm NaCl. Solutions of LysRS alone (15 μm), Gag alone (40 μm), and LysRS/Gag (15 μm/40 μm) were incubated in mobile phase buffer at room temperature for 2 h. Each sample (100 μl) was injected separately on the column, and protein elution was monitored at 280 nm. The traces were digitized using Origin 7 software (Microcal). Fractions (250 μl) were collected every 30 s and analyzed by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and scanned to visualize the bands. Circular Dichroism Analysis—CD spectra were measured at room temperature using a J-710 spectropolarimeter (Jasco) with a 0.1-cm path-length cuvette. Prior to analysis, proteins were dialyzed into 10 mm NaPO4, pH 7.5, and diluted to a concentration of 5 μm. Spectra were accumulated over six scans. In Vitro Pull-down Assays—Purified human LysRS, Mut-LysRS, human TrpRS, human ProRS, HIV-1 Gag, WM-Gag, and CA were dialyzed against binding/dialysis buffer containing 25 mm NaPO4, pH7, 125 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm β-ME at 4 °C. The histidine-tagged LysRS or TrpRS (250 μg) were incubated with 25 μl of Ni2+-NTA resin in a volume of 125 μl for 1 h at room temperature. The resin was washed once with binding/dialysis buffer to remove any unbound LysRS, TrpRS, or ProRS. The dialyzed Gag, WM-Gag, or CA (125 μg in a volume of 150 μl) was added to the LysRS or TrpRS bound to Ni2+-NTA and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. As a control, a similar binding experiment was performed in the absence of bound synthetase. The resin was then washed once with binding/dialysis buffer to remove any unbound protein followed by six washes with binding/dialysis buffer containing 10 mm imidazole to remove any protein non-specifically bound to the resin. To elute the bound protein, the resin was incubated in 150 μl of binding/dialysis buffer containing 200 mm imidazole for 1 h at room temperature, eluted from the resin by centrifugation, and diluted with 2× gel loading buffer containing 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm β-ME, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 10% glycerol. Samples were run on a 10 or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by transfer onto a polyvinylidene fluoride Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). Gag, WM-Gag, and CA were detected using a polyclonal antibody for HIV-1 CA from Pocono Rabbit Farm and Laboratory. A goat anti-rabbit horse-radish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad) was used as the secondary antibody. Detection was performed by enhanced chemiluminescence using Western blotting detection reagents from Amersham Biosciences. Fluorescence Anisotropy Measurements—Equilibrium dissociation constants were determined by measuring the fluorescence anisotropy of 50 nm fluorescently labeled protein (LysRS:AF, TrpRS:AF, Mut-LysRS:AF, or CA:FITC) as a function of increasing concentrations of an unlabeled protein (LysRS, TrpRS, Mut-LysRS, Gag, or WM-Gag). The labeled protein was incubated with varying amounts of the desired unlabeled protein for 30 min at room temperature in 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 50 mm NaCl. Anisotropy measurements were made on a Photon Technology International spectrofluorimeter (Model QM-2000). The excitation and emission wavelengths were 490 and 520 nm, respectively (slit widths = 5 nm). Anisotropy was measured using the time-based function for 30 s (integration time = 1 s; resolution = 8 s), and the data were averaged. All measurements were carried out at least three times. The titration curves were fit to the following equation, which assumes a 1:1 binding stoichiometry (20Reid S.L. Parry D. Liu H.H.

Design and Characterization of Monomeric LysRS and Gag—To investigate whether monomeric forms of human LysRS and Gag could interact, we designed variants containing point mutations in the known dimerization motif of each protein using the three-dimensional structure of E. coli LysRS as a model for the human synthetase (9Onesti S. Miller A.D. Brick P. Structure (Lond.). 1995; 3: 163-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the residues in the motif 1 dimerization domain, Arg-247, Glu-265, Phe-283, that were mutated to alanine to generate Mut-LysRS. These residues are highly conserved in known LysRS sequences and participate in interactions that appear to stabilize the dimer interface. The triple mutant was successfully overexpressed and purified. CD analysis indicated that the secondary structure of Mut-Lys-RS was similar to that of WT LysRS (Fig. 2A). Class II synthetases require homodimerization for aminoacylation function (23Cusack S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 824-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Thus, if the mutations do in fact disrupt dimerization, Mut-LysRS should show little or no aminoacylation activity. Fig. 2B shows that even at high concentrations of Mut-LysRS, the triple mutant lacks aminoacylation activity, consistent with this expectation. Using an electrophoretic band-shift assay, Mut-LysRS was also tested for its ability to bind tRNALys3. Although it lacked aminoacylation activity, the triple mutant still bound tRNA with a similar affinity (∼670 nm) as WT LysRS (∼430 nm) (Fig. 2B, inset).FIGURE 2Characterization of Mut-LysRS. A, CD spectra of WT LysRS (▪) versus Mut-LysRS (♦). B, aminoacylation assay comparing activity of WT LysRS (25 nm, ▪) and Mut-LysRS (1 μm, ♦). tRNALys concentrations were 0.5 μm for WT LysRS and 2 μm for Mut-LysRS. Inset, electrophoretic band-shift assay showing the interaction between tRNALys3 and WT or Mut-LysRS. 32P-labeled tRNALys3 was incubated with different concentrations of either WT or Mut-LysRS: 0 μm (lanes 1 and 6), 0.15 μm (lanes 2 and 7), 0.375 μm (lanes 3 and 8), 0.75 μm (lanes 4 and 9), or 1.5 μm (lanes 5 and 10). C, gel chromatography of WT LysRS (solid line) and Mut-LysRS (dotted line). Peak 1 corresponds to dimeric LysRS, and peak 2 corresponds to monomeric LysRS. D, determination of monomer-dimer equilibrium dissociation constant for Mut-LysRS by gel chromatography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Gel chromatography experiments performed with WT LysRS and Mut-LysRS were also consistent with a shift in the equilibrium distribution toward monomeric species for the triple mutant (Fig. 2C). By carrying out gel chromatography as a function of Mut-LysRS concentration, we estimated the dissociation constant for the monomer-dimer equilibrium to be 24.5 μm (Fig. 2D). Similar experiments performed with WT LysRS showed that it remained primarily dimeric at all concentrations tested (data not shown). Based on these data, the monomer-dimer equilibrium dissociation constant of WT LysRS is <200 nm. Taken together, these data support successful disruption of interactions that are critical for dimerization in the triple mutant. Individual mutations of W184A and M185A in the CTD of CA have been reported to prevent CA dimerization in vitro (24Gamble T.R. Yoo S. Vajdos F.F. von Schwedler U.K. Worthylake D.K. Wang H. McCutcheon J.P. Sundquist W.I. Hill C.P. Science. 1997; 278: 849-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). In addition, the same individual mutations in the context of Gag, W317A and M318A, inhibit Gag-Gag interactions (25Burniston M.T. Cimarelli A. Colgan J. Curtis S.P. Luban J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8527-8540Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we simultaneously mutated both of these residues to alanine to generate WM-Gag. Fig. 1 (inset) shows the location of these residues in the CTD of CA. Using sedimentation equilibrium experiments, the monomer association constants were determined to be 5.5 μm for WT Δp6-Gag and >20 μm for WM-Gag. 4S. A. K. Datta, Z. Zhao, P. K. Clark, S. Tarasov, J. N. Alexandratos, S. J. Campbell, M. Kvaratskhelia, J. Lebowitz, and A. Rein, manuscript in preparation. These results support significant disruption of Gag-Gag interactions in the double mutant. Characterization of the Fluorescently Labeled Proteins—To confirm that the fluorescently labeled synthetases were properly folded and active, we measured the aminoacylation activity of labeled and unlabeled proteins. No detectable difference in the efficiency of aminoacylation relative to unlabeled protein was observed for LysRS:AF or TrpRS:AF (data not shown). Although we were unable to test an enzymatic activity for CA:FITC, CD analysis showed no difference in the secondary structure of CA:FITC relative to unlabeled CA (data not shown). In Vitro Affinity Pull-down Assays—Purified histidine-tagged LysRS, Mut-LysRS, TrpRS, or ProRS were absorbed to Ni2+-NTA resin and incubated with Gag, WM-Gag, or CA. Following extensive washing to remove non-specifically bound protein, the material on the resin was eluted with 200 mm imidazole and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis. LysRS pulls down both Gag and WM-Gag to similar extents (Fig. 3A, lanes 2 and 6). Negative control experiments performed with Gag or WM-Gag in the absence of LysRS did not yield a Gag signal (Fig. 3A, lanes 4 and 8). This demonstrates that Gag and WM-Gag do not bind to the Ni2+-NTA resin in the absence of LysRS. The final wash fractions were also examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis and con"
https://openalex.org/W2074701657,"G protein-activated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels mediate slow synaptic inhibition and control neuronal excitability. It is unknown whether GIRK channels are subject to regulation by guanine dissociation inhibitor (GDI) proteins like LGN, a mammalian homolog of Drosophila Partner of Inscuteable (mPINS). Here we report that LGN increases basal GIRK current but reduces GIRK activation by metabotropic transmitter receptors coupled to Gi or Go, but not Gs. Moreover, expression of its N-terminal, TPR-containing protein interaction domains mimics the effects of LGN in mammalian cells, probably by releasing sequestered endogenous LGN. In hippocampal neurons, expression of LGN, or LGN fragments that mimic or enhance LGN activity, hyperpolarizes the resting potential due to increased basal GIRK activity and reduces excitability. Using Lenti virus for LGN RNAi to reduce endogenous LGN levels in hippocampal neurons, we further show an essential role of LGN for maintaining basal GIRK channel activity and for harnessing neuronal excitability."

Previously, we demonstrated that CS/DS hybrid chains from embryonic pig brain exhibit neuritogenic and growth factor binding activities, which depended on their IdoUA content defining the DS-like structure. To elucidate the distribution of such functional sugar chains during the development of the brain, in situ hybridization was performed to examine expression of three CS/DS GalNAc 4-O-sulfotransferases, D4ST-1, C4ST-1, and C4ST-2, and a single uronyl 2-O-sulfotransferase (UST) involved in the biosynthesis of DS in addition to CS intermediates. C4ST-1 and C4ST-2 were ubiquitously expressed in the postnatal mouse brain, whereas the expression of D4ST-1 and UST was restricted in the developing cerebellum and culminated at postnatal day 14 as shown by reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis. In situ analysis of the disaccharides of CS/DS in brain sections revealed that the concentration of CS/DS increases 2-fold during development (postnatal day 7 to 7 weeks). The proportions of DS-specific, principal disaccharides, IdoUA-Gal-NAc(4-O-sulfate) (iA) and IdoUA(2-O-sulfate)-GalNAc(4-O-sulfate) (iB), produced by the sequential actions of D4ST-1 and UST, were higher in the CS/DS chains from cerebellum than those from whole brain sections.

DS is a stereoisomeric variant of CS composed of repeating disaccharide units containing GlcUA and GalNAc, with varying proportions of IdoUA in place of GlcUA in a tissue-specific manner (18Silbert J.E.

The characteristics of the GAG moieties of a CS-PG called DSD-1 (dermatan sulfate dependent-1)-PG/phosphacan, which was originally isolated from postnatal mouse brain (20Faissner A. Clement A. Lochter A. Streit A. Mandl C. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 783-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), suggests that DS-type GAG chains are expressed in the brain as CS/DS hybrid chains with a larger proportion of GlcUA and a smaller proportion of IdoUA, in contrast to typical skin DS chains with a high content of IdoUA (19Cheng F. Heinegård D. Malmström A. Schmidtchen A. Yoshida K. Fransson L.Å. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 685-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We have shown that diverse oversulfated DS chains derived from various marine organisms promote the outgrowth of neurites in primary hippocampal neurons of the mouse, suggesting the involvement of DS-type structures, in addition to their sulfation profiles, in the neuritogenesis (21Hikino M.

This notion was strongly supported by the demonstration of significant neuritogenic and growth factor binding activities of CS/DS hybrid chains isolated from embryonic pig brain, which contain a higher proportion of IdoUA than those prepared from adult pig brain (24Bao X. Nishimura S. Mikami T. Yamada S. Itoh N. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9765-9776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 25Bao X. Mikami T. Yamada S. Faissner A.

Therefore, characteristic, functional CS/DS hybrid chains may be distributed in the brain parenchyma, where the neural network forms during development. However, the spatiotemporal distribution of such IdoUA-containing CS/DS hybrid structures in the brain remains largely unknown because of analytical difficulties. The structural variability of CS/DS chains is biosynthetically generated under the control of multiple sulfotransferases and glucuronyl C5 epimerase that converts GlcUA to IdoUA at the polymer level (for reviews see Refs. 18Silbert J.E. Sugumaran G. IUBMB Life. 2002; 54: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 26Fransson L.Å. Belting M. Jönsson M. Mani K. Moses J. Oldberg Å.

Previously, we have demonstrated the substrate specificities of three CS/DS 4-O-sulfotransferases, dermatan 4-O-sulfotransferase-1 (D4ST-1) and chondroitin 4-O-sulfotransferases-1 and -2 (C4ST-1 and C4ST-2), toward partially desulfated DS (28Mikami T. Mizumoto S. Kago N. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36115-36127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The results suggest a substantial contribution of D4ST-1 to the formation of IdoUA-rich regions consisting largely of a disaccharide iA unit (IdoUA-GalNAc(4S)) characteristic of DS, and the potential involvement of C4STs in the 4-O-sulfation of GalNAc residues next to IdoUA. In addition, a single uronyl 2-O-sulfotransferase (UST) catalyzes preferentially the 2-O-sulfation of IdoUA of iA units (29Kobayashi M. Sugumaran G. Liu J. Shworak N.W. Silbert J.E. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10474-10480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), forming another DS-specific iB unit IdoUA(2S)-GalNAc(4S), where 2S and 4S represent 2-O- and 4-O-sulfate groups, respectively. In view of their substrate preferences for DS precursor chains, the gene expression patterns of these sulfotransferases would provide clues for investigating the regional distribution pattern of IdoUA-containing CS/DS hybrid chains in tissues. Hence, we examined the gene expression of the four CS/DS sulfotransferases described above during postnatal development of the mouse brain by in situ hybridization to probe the distribution of such hybrid chains in the brain parenchyma. Furthermore, we demonstrated a good correlation between the gene expression profiles and the distribution pattern of IdoUA-containing CS/DS structures produced by the gene products based on an in situ analysis of the disaccharide composition of the CS/DS chains in brain sections.

A cDNA fragment (∼1.4 kbp) of mouse C4ST-2 (UniGene Cluster Mm. 28934) was amplified with a forward primer 5′-CCA GCT GTG CAC AAG GCT GA-3′ and a reverse primer 5′-TGC CTG TCA CAC CAG GAA GC-3′, followed by nested PCR with nested primers as follows: a forward primer 5′-GCA CAA GGC TGA AGT GAA GG-3′ and a reverse primer 5′-AAG GAA GCC AGG AGA GAA CC-3′. In the case of mouse UST (UniGene Cluster Mm. 41163) cDNA, the cDNA fragment (∼1.3 kbp) was amplified with a forward primer 5′-CTC TCC ATG TGC AGA CAG CC-3′ and a reverse primer 5′-GGA TGA GGC CAC AGA AGC CA-3′, followed by nested PCR with nested primers as follows: a forward primer 5′-GAT GGG TGA CCT CTT CCT GG-3′ and a reverse primer 5′-GCC ACA ATC TGG CGC AGG TA-3′. All the reactions were performed using KOD-Plus (Toyobo, Tokyo, Japan) in the presence of 5% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide. Each amplified cDNA fragment was subcloned into a pGEM-T® Easy vector (Promega, Tokyo, Japan) and sequenced in a 377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystem, Tokyo, Japan). In Situ Hybridization—Brains were quickly removed from postnatal day (P) 7, P14, and P21 ddY mice and 7-week-old (W) male ddY mice and frozen in powdered dry ice. Consecutive brain sections were cut at a thickness of 16 μm with a cryostat (Leica Microsystems, Tokyo, Japan), thaw-mounted onto 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane-precoated glass slides, and stored at –80 °C prior to use. 35S-Labeled riboprobes were transcribed using a MAXIscript™ T7 kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) with 5′-α [35S]thiotriphosphate (∼30 TBq/mmol) (Amersham Biosciences). Before being loaded on the slides, the radiolabeled probes were mixed individually into a hybridization buffer (50% (v/v) formamide, 10% (v/v) dextran sulfate, 2.5× Denhardt's solution, 4× saline-sodium citrate (SSC), 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.5 mg/ml tRNA from brewers' yeast (Roche Diagnostics), 0.1 mg/ml DNA from herring sperm (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Tokyo, Japan), and 20 mm dithiothreitol) at a concentration of 107 cpm/ml. In situ hybridization with 35S-labeled riboprobes was performed as described previously (30Simmons D.M. Arriza J.L. Swanson L.W. J. Histotech. 1989; 12: 169-181Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, the tissue sections were fixed in 4% (v/v) formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature for 15 min, followed by digestion with proteinase K (2 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 10 min, acetylation in 0.25% (v/v) acetic anhydride in 0.1 m triethanolamine at room temperature for 10 min, and dehydration through graded concentrations of ethanol. After drying, the tissue sections were pretreated with the hybridization buffer without 10% (w/v) dextran sulfate at 55 °C for 1 h and then with the hybridization buffer containing the respective probes prepared as above, and incubated in a moisture chamber at 55 °C for 18 h. The slides were rinsed twice in 2× SSC containing 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol at room temperature for 5 min, digested with RNase A (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 30 min, rinsed twice in 50% (v/v) formamide, 2× SSC, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol at 55 °C for 30 min and subsequently in 2× SSC, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol at room temperature for 10 min, and dehydrated with a series of concentrations of ethanol. For signal detection, the processed sections were exposed to x-ray films (BioMax MR; Eastman Kodak Co.) for 1 week. At least three independent experiments were carried out for each probe. Quantitative Real Time RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from entire brains or cerebella of P7, P14, and P21 ddY mice and 7W male ddY mice using a QuickPrep total RNA extraction kit (Amersham Biosciences). The cDNA was synthesized from ∼1 μg of the total RNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase (Promega) and an oligo(dT)20-M4 adaptor primer (Takara, Otsu, Japan). Primer sequences used are as follows: D4ST-1 (175 bp), a forward primer (F) 5′-GCG TCC TGA ACA ACG TG-3′ and a reverse primer (R) 5′-TCT CCA AAC TTG TTA CGG TAA GC-3′; C4ST-1 (141 bp), F 5′-ACC TCG TGG GCA AGT ATG AG-3′ and R 5′-TCT GGA AGA ACT CCG TGG TC-3′; UST (151 bp), F 5′-TGA CCA TGG ACC ACC TCC TA-3′ and R 5′-GTG AAT GTC TGA TGT GAC CAA A-3′; chondroitin 6-O-sulfotransferase-1 (C6ST-1) (152 bp), F 5′-CTG GCA TTT GTG GTC ATA GTT T-3′ and R 5′-AAG AGA GAT GCA TTC TCC GAT AAG-3′; chondroitin 4-sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase (GalNAc4S-6ST) (153 bp), F 5′-TAT GAC AAC AGC ACA GAC GG-3′ and R 5′-TGC AGA TTT ATT GGA ACT TGC GAA-3′; and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (205 bp), F 5′-CAT CTG AGG GCC CAC TG-3′ and R 5′-GAG GCC ATG TAG GCC ATG A-3′. Quantitative real time RT-PCR was performed using a FastStart DNA Master plus SYBR Green I (Roche Diagnostics) in a LightCycler ST300 (Roche Diagnostics). The expression level of each sulfotransferase mRNA was normalized to that of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase transcript. Determination of the Disaccharide Composition of CS/DS Chains in the Brain Sections on Glass Slides—The digestion of CS/DS chains in the brain sections on glass slides with CS/DS-degrading enzymes was carried out as described previously (31Koshiishi I. Horikoshi E. Imanari T. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 267: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. The tissue sections prepared as above were fixed with acetone/methanol (1:1, v/v) at room temperature for 3 min and dried. For the analysis of CS/DS chains in the cerebella, unnecessary portions of the brain sections were scratched off with a fine surgical knife under a dark field microscopic view. The photographs of the clipped tissue sections were scanned under a dark field microscope (SZX12; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a digital camera (HC-300Z/OL; Olympus) for calculating the area using morphological analysis software (Mac Scope; Mitani Corp., Tokyo, Japan). The sections were rehydrated in distilled water at room temperature for 10 min. Depending upon the relative size of each section, an appropriate volume (25–150 μl) of an enzyme solution mixture containing chondroitinase ABC (25 mIU/ml) or AC-I (25 mIU/ml) in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.3 (32Yamada S. Sugahara K. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 213: 71-78PubMed Google Scholar), was applied on the sections. It should be noted that the enzymatic digestion with chondroitinase ABC was also carried out in the above-mentioned buffer instead of the conventional buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 60 mm sodium acetate) (32Yamada S. Sugahara K. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 213: 71-78PubMed Google Scholar), based on the prior selection of an optimal buffer for digestion with chondroitinase ABC and subsequent efficient labeling with a fluorophore, 2-aminobenzamide (2AB). 4C. Mitsunaga, T. Mikami, and K. Sugahara, unpublished results. The sections were incubated in a moisture chamber at 37 °C for 2 h. The enzyme solutions were then collected, dried, and subjected to derivatization with 2AB as described previously (33Kinoshita A. Sugahara K. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). After the removal of excess 2AB reagent by paper chromatography, the resultant 2AB derivatives of the unsaturated disaccharides listed below were identified and quantified by anion-exchange HPLC on an amine-bound silica PA03 column (4.6 × 250 mm, YMC Co., Kyoto, Japan) with a linear gradient of NaH2PO4 from 16 to 530 mm over 60 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min (33Kinoshita A.

Several brain sections were directly homogenized with acetone, and the acetone-insoluble materials were collected by centrifugation. After drying, the CS/DS chain-containing precipitates were treated with 1 m NaBH4, 0.05 m NaOH at room temperature for 2 h to liberate O-linked saccharides including GAG chains from the core proteins. After neutralization with 1 m acetic acid and subsequent treatment with 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, a GAG-containing fraction was recovered by ethanol precipitation. An aliquot of the resultant GAG fraction was used for the analysis of the disaccharide composition described above. Brain sections on glass slides were immunostained with the monoclonal anti-CS antibody 473HD, which has been originally reported to recognize the GAG moiety of a brain-derived CS-PG, DSD-1-PG/phosphacan, and has long been postulated to react with unique CS/DS hybrid structures (20Faissner A. Clement A. Lochter A. Streit A. Mandl C. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 783-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), before and after treatment with the enzyme solution containing chondroitinase ABC to confirm the efficient removal of CS/DS chains from the sections. Expression of CS/DS GalNAc 4-O-Sulfotransferases in the Mouse Brain during Postnatal Development—DS-type GAG chains have been postulated to be formed from precursor chondroitin chains by C5-epimerization of GlcUA into IdoUA residues, accompanied by 4-O-sulfation of the neighboring GalNAc residues. In view of the in vitro substrate specificities of human sulfotransferases involved in the 4-O-sulfation of CS/DS (28Mikami T. Mizumoto S. Kago N. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. J. Biol.

Thus, to gain insights into the distribution of such IdoUA-containing CS/DS hybrid chains in the mouse brain during postnatal development, expression of the mouse counterparts of the three human family members of CS/DS GalNAc 4-O-sulfotransferases, D4ST-1, C4ST-1, and C4ST-2, was examined by in situ hybridization with their respective 35S-labeled antisense probes. Fig. 1 shows autoradiograms of the sagittal sections from the brains of P7, P14, P21, and 7W mice. Distinct patterns of labeling were observed for C4ST-1 and C4ST-2 in widespread regions of the developing brain, including the olfactory bulb, caudate putamen, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, midbrain, and cerebellum (Fig. 1, E–L). In the negative control experiments with the respective 35S-labeled sense probes, essentially no label was observed in any region (data not shown), confirming the specific hybridization of the antisense probes. In contrast, the expression level of D4ST-1 was low compared with levels of C4STs. Interestingly, however, the transcript of D4ST-1 was exclusively expressed in the cerebellum throughout the postnatal developmental stages examined (Fig. 1, A–D). Similar results were obtained in the autoradiograms of consecutive coronal sections of the brain, including the cerebellum (Fig. 2). Consistent with these findings, quantitative real time RT-PCR revealed that the expression level of D4ST-1 in the cerebellum was relatively higher than that in the whole brain and culminated at P14 during postnatal development (Fig. 3A), whereas C4ST-1 was expressed at a similar level in both the cerebellum and the whole brain at all stages examined (Fig. 3B), indicating its ubiquitous expression in the postnatal brain. These gene expression patterns suggest that IdoUA-containing CS/DS hybrid chains are relatively abundant in the cerebellum during postnatal brain development.FIGURE 2In situ hybridization for D4ST-1, C4ST-1, and C4ST-2 in the mouse cerebellum during postnatal development. Consecutive coronal brain sections, including the cerebellum at P7 (A, E, and I), P14 (B, F, and J), P21 (C, G, and K), and 7W (D, H, and L), were hybridized with 35S-labeled antisense cRNA probes for D4ST-1 (A–D), C4ST-1 (E–H), and C4ST-2 (I–L) as described in the legend to Fig. 1.

https://openalex.org/W1995358290,"Phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) is a multiply palmitoylated protein which is localized in either the cell membrane or nucleus depending on its palmitoylated state. The increasing evidence showed the biological roles of PLSCR1 in cell signaling, maturation and apoptosis. To investigate the functions of PLSCR1 in leukemic cells, we generated an inducible PLSCR1-expressing cell line using myeloid leukemic U937 cells. In this cell line, PLSCR1 was tightly regulated and induced upon tetracycline withdrawal. Our results showed that inducible PLSCR1 expression arrested the proliferation of U937 cells at G1 phase. Meanwhile, PLSCR1-overexpressing U937 cells also underwent granulocyte-like differentiation with increased sensitivity to etoposide-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, we also found that PLSCR1 induction increased cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p27Kip1 and p21Cip1 proteins, together with downregulation of S phase kinase-associated protein 2 (SKP2), an F-box subunit of the ubiquitin-ligase complex that targets proteins for degradation. Additionally, PLSCR1 induction significantly decreased c-Myc protein and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein. Although the exact mechanism by which PLSCR1 regulates these cellular events and gene expression remains unresolved, our results suggest that PLSCR1 plays the antagonistic role regarding leukemia development. These data will shed new insights into understanding the biochemical and biological functions of PLSCR1 protein."

https://openalex.org/W1995669837,"The inhibitor of apoptosis gene family member Survivin is highly expressed in most tumors, and appears to be a promising target for cancer therapy. Although a variety of Survivin antagonists have been shown to induce apoptosis in malignant cells, the potential utility of these agents is limited by inefficient delivery and cell impermeability. We generated recombinant fusion proteins containing the TAT protein transduction domain and either wild-type Survivin (TAT-Surv-WT) or a dominant-negative mutant (TAT-Surv-T34A). The TAT-Surv proteins were purified by sequential affinity and ion–exchange chromatography, and at 30 nM concentration demonstrated rapid entry into cells at 30 min. Whereas TAT-Surv-WT had minimal effect on YUSAC2 or WM793 melanoma cells, TAT-Surv-T34A induced cell detachment, DNA fragmentation, caspase-3 activation and mitochondrial release of apoptosis-inducing factor at low μ M concentrations. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of mice bearing subcutaneous YUSAC2 xenografts with TAT-Surv-T34A (10 mg/kg) was associated with rapid tumor accumulation at 1 h, and increased tumor cell apoptosis and aberrant nuclei formation in situ. Repeated i.p. injection of TAT-Surv-T34A resulted in a 40–50% reduction in growth and mass of established tumors, compared to those similarly injected with saline buffer or TAT-Surv-WT. These studies demonstrate the feasibility of systemic tumor treatment using a cell-permeable Survivin antagonist."
https://openalex.org/W2003614117,"TSC1, encoding hamartin, and TSC2, encoding tuberin, are tumor suppressor genes responsible for the autosomal dominantly inherited disease tuberous sclerosis (TSC). TSC affects approximately 1 in 6000 individuals and is characterized by the development of tumors, named hamartomas, in different organs. Hamartin and tuberin form a complex, of which tuberin is assumed to be the functional component. The TSC proteins have been implicated in the control of cell cycle and cell size. In addition to enhanced growth, reduced death rates can lead to tumor development. Therefore, defects in the apoptosis-inducing pathways contribute to neoplastic cell expansion. Here, we show that tuberin triggers apoptosis, accompanied by downregulation of p70S6K activity and of phosphorylation of BAD on residue Ser136, and by upregulation of the interaction of BAD/BCL-2 and BAD/BCL-XL. AKT phosphorylation negatively regulates tuberin's potential to trigger apoptosis. Experiments with BAD-/- cells demonstrate BAD to be a mediator of tuberin's effects on the regulation of apoptosis. Tuberin interferes with insulin-like growth factor-1-induced BAD Ser136 phosphorylation and cell survival. Our work proposes a model in which tuberin-mediated inhibition of p70S6K activates BAD to heterodimerize with BCL-2 and BCL-XL to promote apoptosis. A mutation of TSC2--as it occurs in TSC patients--attenuates this proapoptotic potential, underscoring the relevance of our findings for human pathophysiology."
https://openalex.org/W2025591259,"Activation of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase involves the assembly of a membrane-localized cytochrome b559 with the cytosolic components p47phox, p67phox, p40phox, and the GTPase Rac (1 or 2). In resting phagocytes, Rac is found in the cytosol as a prenylated protein in the GDP-bound form, associated with the Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor (RhoGDI). In the process of NADPH oxidase activation, Rac is dissociated from RhoGDI and translocates to the membrane, in concert with the other cytosolic components. The mechanism responsible for dissociation of Rac from RhoGDI is poorly understood. We generated Rac(1 or 2)·RhoGDI complexes in vitro from recombinant Rac(1 or 2), prenylated enzymatically, and recombinant RhoGDI, and purified these by anion exchange chromatography. Exposing Rac(1 or 2)(GDP)·RhoGDI complexes to liposomes containing four different anionic phospholipids caused the dissociation of Rac(1 or 2)(GDP) from RhoGDI and its binding to the anionic liposomes. Rac2(GDP)·RhoGDI complexes were more resistant to dissociation, reflecting the lesser positive charge of Rac2. Liposomes consisting of neutral phospholipid did not cause dissociation of Rac(1 or 2)·RhoGDI complexes. Rac1 exchanged to the hydrolysis-resistant GTP analogue, GMPPNP, associated with RhoGDI with lower affinity than Rac1(GDP) and Rac1(GMPPNP)·RhoGDI complexes were more readily dissociated by anionic liposomes. Rac1(GMPPNP)·RhoGDI complexes elicited NADPH oxidase activation in native phagocyte membrane liposomes in the presence of p67phox, without the need for an anionic amphiphile, as activator. Both Rac1(GDP)·RhoGDI and Rac1(GMPPNP)·RhoGDI complexes elicited amphiphile-independent, p67phox-dependent NADPH oxidase activation in phagocyte membrane liposomes enriched in anionic phospholipids but not in membrane liposomes enriched in neutral phospholipids.

The production of reactive oxygen species represents one of the major microbicidal weapons of professional phagocytes. The primordial oxygen radical is superoxide (O2˙-), and it is produced by the NADPH-derived one-electron reduction of molecular oxygen by an enzyme complex known as the NADPH oxidase (briefly “oxidase”) (reviewed in Refs. 1Nauseef W.M.

This consists of a membrane-bound heterodimeric flavocytochrome (cytochrome b559), consisting of two subunits, gp91phox and p22phox, and four cytosolic proteins, p47phox, p67phox, p40phox, and the small GTPase Rac (1 or 2). In the resting phagocyte, there is no contact between cytochrome b559 and the cytosolic components. In response to a variety of stimuli, acting via membrane receptors, the cytosolic components engage in a complex set of protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions leading to their translocation to the membrane. The “purpose” of this process is to induce a conformational change in gp91phox, which is the catalytic subunit of the oxidase containing all the redox stations and responsible for electron transfer from NADPH to oxygen. It is likely that the pivotal protein-protein interaction is between p67phox and gp91phox and there is good evidence for a key role of an “activation domain” in p67phox, consisting of residues 199-210, in this process (5Han C.H.

Rac is absolutely required for the activation of the phagocyte oxidase. This was demonstrated by the ability of Rac1, purified from macrophages (14Abo A. Pick E. Hall A. Totty N. Teahan C.G. Segal A.W. Nature. 1991; 353: 668-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar), and Rac2, purified from neutrophils (15Knaus U.G. Heyworth P.G. Evans T. Curnutte J.T. Bokoch G.M.

The essential role of Rac in the regulation of phagocyte oxidase in intact cells has been amply demonstrated (19Dorseuil O. Vazquez A. Lang P. Bertoglio J. Gacon G. Leca G. J. Biol.

Thus, a patient with a dominant negative mutation in Rac2 (D57N) suffered from a phagocyte immunodeficiency syndrome and his neutrophils produced markedly reduced amounts of O., in response to some stimuli (22Williams D.A. Tao W. Yang F. Kim C. Gu Y. Mansfield P. Levine J.E. Petryniak B. Derrow C.W. Harris C. Jia B. Zheng Y. Ambruso D.R. Lowe J.B. Atkinson S.J. Dinauer M.C. Boxer L.

Rac1 and Rac2 differ significantly in their C-terminal polybasic region; Rac1 contains six contiguous basic residues (183KKRKRK188) whereas Rac2 contains only three (183RQQKRA188). Rac1 has been reported to be the predominant isoform of Rac in monocytes (23Zhao X. Carnevale K.A. Cathcart M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40788-40792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and macrophages (24Yamauchi A. Kim C. Li S. Marchal C.C. Towe J. Atkinson S.J. Dinauer M.C. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 30749-30752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells, Rac is subject to post-translational modifications, consisting of prenylation (geranylgeranylation), carboxyl methylation on the cysteine in the C-terminal CLLL (Rac1) or CSLL (Rac2) sequences, and cleavage of the last three residues (26Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar, 27Cox A.D. Der C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 1008-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). As a typical member of the Rho GTPase family, Rac acts as molecular switch cycling between inactive (GDP-bound) and active (GTP-bound) conformations. The GDP/GTP switch is controlled by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) 2The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; RhoGDI, Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; GMPPNP, guanylyl-imidodiphosphate; mant-GMPPNP, 2′-(or 3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-guanylyl-imidodiphosphate; mant-GDP, 2′-(or 3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-guanosine 5′-diphosphate; PC, l-α-phosphatidylcholine; PA, l-α-phosphatidic acid; PG, l-α-phosphatidyl-DL-glycerol; PI, l-α-phosphatidylinositol; PS, l-α-phosphatidyl-l-serine; GGTI, geranylgeranyltransferase type I; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; GST, glutathione S-transferase. 2The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; RhoGDI, Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; GMPPNP, guanylyl-imidodiphosphate; mant-GMPPNP, 2′-(or 3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-guanylyl-imidodiphosphate; mant-GDP, 2′-(or 3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-guanosine 5′-diphosphate; PC, l-α-phosphatidylcholine; PA, l-α-phosphatidic acid; PG, l-α-phosphatidyl-DL-glycerol; PI, l-α-phosphatidylinositol; PS, l-α-phosphatidyl-l-serine; GGTI, geranylgeranyltransferase type I; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; GST, glutathione S-transferase. and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) (see Ref. 28Bokoch G.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 163-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, for review with emphasis on the role of Rac in phagocytes). In the resting phagocyte, Rac is found predominantly in the cytosol in the form of a heterodimer with the regulatory protein Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor (RhoGDI) (14Abo A. Pick E. Hall A. Totty N. Teahan C.G. Segal A.W. Nature. 1991; 353: 668-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 17Knaus U.G. Heyworth P.G. Kinsella B.T. Curnutte J.T. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol.

Prenylation is an absolute requirement for all members of the Rho family to form a complex with RhoGDI (for reviews on RhoGDI, see Refs. 30DerMardirossian C. Bokoch G.M.

Thus, it was reported that the GTP-bound forms of Rac, RhoA, and Cdc42Hs bind to RhoGDI with affinities lower (32Chuang T.H. Xu X. Knaus U.G. Hart M.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol.

Three human RhoGDIs have been identified: the ubiquitously expressed RhoGDI-1 (or GDIα) (36Fukumoto Y. Kaibuchi K. Hori Y. Fujioka H. Araki S. Ueda T. Kikuchi A. Takai Y.

RhoGDI-1 consists of a C-terminal domain that adopts an immunoglobulin-like fold and a highly flexible N-terminal regulatory region that becomes ordered into helixes upon complex formation with Rho proteins. The N-terminal regulatory arm of RhoGDI-1 binds to the switch I and II domains of Rac, whereas the prenylated moiety of Rac inserts into a hydrophobic pocket within the immunoglobulin-like domain of RhoGDI-1 (41Gosser Y.Q.

RhoGDI regulates the activity of Rho family GTPases by the inhibition of GDP (and GTP) dissociation, inhibition of intrinsic and GAP-induced GTP hydrolysis, and by controlling the partitioning of Rho GTPases between cytosol and plasma membrane (46Dransart E. Olofsson B. Cherfils J. Traffic. 2005; 6: 957-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 47Zalcman G. Dorseuil O. Garcia-Ranea J.A. Gacon G. Camonis J. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 1999; 22: 85-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Moreover, structural and biochemical studies suggest that GEFs cannot act on Rho GTPases when these are bound to RhoGDI (48Robbe K. Otto-Bruc A. Chardin P. Antonny B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4756-4762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 49Snyder J.T. Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Betts L. Pruitt W.M. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Sondek J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 468-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Dissociation of prenylated Rac from RhoGDI was shown to be an obligatory step in the assembly of the oxidase, preceding translocation of Rac from cytosol to the plasma membrane (29Pick E. Gorzalczany Y. Engel S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 441-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 50Abo A. Webb M.R. Grogan A. Segal A.W. Biochem.

Thus, dissociation from RhoGDI represents an event linked to oxidase assembly for two reasons: enabling repartition of Rac from the cytosol to the membrane and making possible nucleotide exchange from GDP to GTP. In light of the centrality of this issue, it is surprising that the mechanism(s) responsible for the dissociation of Rho GTPases from RhoGDI, in general, and of Rac from RhoGDI, in the context of oxidase assembly, in particular, are poorly understood. The following mechanisms were reported to regulate the balance between RhoGDI-bound and free GTPase: 1) Phosphorylation of Rho GTPases (RhoA and CDC42) by protein kinase A enhanced binding to RhoGDI (52Lang P. Gesbert F. Delespine-Carmagnat M. Stancou R. Pouchelet M. Bertoglio J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 510-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 53Forget M.A. Desrosiers R.R. Gingras D. Beliveau R. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). 2) On the other hand, phosphorylation of RhoGDI by protein kinase C (54Mehta D. Rahman A. Malik A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22614-22620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 55Price L.S. Langeslag M. ten Klooster J.P. Hordijk P.L. Jalink K. Collard J.G. J. Biol.

Cell. 2004; 15: 117-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), facilitated the disruption of Rac·RhoGDI but not of RhoA·RhoGDI complexes. 3) Arachidonic acid and certain phospholipids, such as phosphatidic acid and some phosphoinositides, in the 0.5-50 μm concentration range, disrupted Rac·RhoGDI complexes (51Chuang T.H. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26206-26211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 4) Certain phosphoinositides were shown to cause a “partial opening” of RhoA·RhoGDI complexes, allowing GDP to GTP exchange on RhoA and its translocation to the membrane (57Faure J. Vignais P.V. Dagher M.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 879-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). 5) Several cellular components can act as displacement factors to release Rho GTPases from RhoGDI; thus, direct interaction of RhoGDI with the neurotrophin receptor p75 initiated the activation of RhoA by facilitating the release of prenylated RhoA from RhoGDI (58Yamashita T. Tohyama M. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar); proteins from the ERM (ezrin/radixin/moesin) family appear to act as displacement factors (59Takahashi K. Sasaki T. Mammoto A. Takaishi K. Kameyama T. Tsukita S. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23371-23375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), and a role for integrins in promoting the dissociation of Rac-GTP from RhoGDI and thus enhancing membrane targeting of Rac was also reported (60Del Pozo M. Kiosses W.B. Alderson N.B. Meller N. Hahn K.M. Schwartz M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). It was also proposed that, in the process of oxidase assembly, dissociation of the Rac·RhoGDI complex is correlated with GDP to GTP exchange on Rac, mediated by a membrane-bound GEF (61Bokoch G.M. Bohl B.P. Chuang T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31674-31679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our group purified and characterized a cytosolic component of the oxidase complex, present in macrophage cytosol, which was initially called σ1 or “the third cytosolic component” (62Abo A. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23577-23585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This was found to be a heterodimer of two proteins, 22 kDa and 24 kDa in size, which were later identified as Rac1 and RhoGDI, respectively (14Abo A. Pick E. Hall A. Totty N. Teahan C.G. Segal A.W. Nature. 1991; 353: 668-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 29Pick E. Gorzalczany Y. Engel S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 441-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Rac2 was also isolated from neutrophil cytosol as a complex with RhoGDI (17Knaus U.G. Heyworth P.G. Kinsella B.T. Curnutte J.T. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23575-23582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It soon became apparent that purified Rac1 and Rac2 can support oxidase activation in vitro in the absence of RhoGDI and that non-prenylated recombinant Rac1 and Rac2 are both active in the amphiphile-dependent cell-free system (14Abo A. Pick E. Hall A. Totty N. Teahan C.G. Segal A.W. Nature. 1991; 353: 668-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 18Heyworth P.G. Knaus U.G. Xu X. Uhlinger D.J. Conroy L. Bokoch G.M. Curnutte J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These findings support a model in which RhoGDI is not actively involved in the process of oxidase activation and serves exclusively as a negative regulator, the dissociation of which from Rac is a precondition for activation to proceed. An alternative possibility is that an intact Rac(GDP)·RhoGDI complex, such as isolated from macrophage (62Abo A. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23577-23585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and neutrophil (50Abo A. Webb M.R. Grogan A. Segal A.W. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) cytosol, participates in oxidase activation in the absence of complex dissociation and nucleotide exchange on Rac to GTP. Functional (63Bromberg Y. Shani E. Joseph G. Gorzalczany Y. Sperling O. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7055-7058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and structural (44Grizot S. Faure J. Fieschi F. Vignais P.V. Dagher M.C. Pebay-Peyroula E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10007-10013Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) arguments in favor of such a process have been put forward. In the present study we provide experimental evidence for the proposal that the stability of Rac·RhoGDI complexes is regulated by the phospholipid composition of the phagocyte membrane, with emphasis on the electric charge of the phospholipids. We describe an in vitro system in which negatively charged phospholipid liposomes (a protein-free “membrane model”) are shown to be able to dissociate Rac·RhoGDI complexes. The influences of the isoform of Rac and of the type of guanine nucleotide bound to Rac, on the level of liposome-induced dissociation are also described. Finally, we show that Rac·RhoGDI complexes are capable of amphiphile-independent oxidase activation in a cell-free system centered on phagocyte membrane liposomes enriched in anionic phospholipids. Chemicals and Reagents—The hydrolysis-resistant nucleotide analog guanylyl-imidodiphosphate (GMPPNP, tetralithium salt, 83%, <0.2% GTP) was purchased from Roche Applied Science. The fluorescent hydrolysis-resistant GTP analogues 2′-(or 3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-guanylyl-imidodiphosphate (mant-GMPPNP) and 2′-(or 3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-guanosine 5′-diphosphate (mant-GDP) were obtained from Jena Bioscience. The following phospholipids were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich: l-α-phosphatidylcholine (PC) (from soybean, 99%, product number P 7443); l-α-phosphatidyl-l-serine (PS) (from soybean, 98%, product number P 0474); l-α-phosphatidylinositol (PI) (ammonium salt, from soybean, 98%, product number P5954); l-α-phosphatidyl-dl-glycerol (PG) (ammonium salt synthetic, 99%, product number P 6956), and l-α-phosphatidic acid (PA) (sodium salt, from egg yolk lecithin, 98%, product number P 9511). Common laboratory chemicals were from Sigma or Merck. Preparation of Macrophage Membrane Liposomes—Membranes were isolated from guinea pig peritoneal macrophages, as described previously (8Bromberg Y. Pick E. Cell. Immunol. 1984; 88: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Membranes suspended to a concentration of 500 × 106 cell equivalents/ml were first solubilized by 40 mm octyl glucoside and then reconstituted into liposomes by dialysis against detergent-free buffer, as reported before (65Shpungin S. Dotan I. Abo A. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9195-9203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific cytochrome b559 heme content of membrane liposomes was measured by the difference in spectrum of sodium dithionite-reduced minus oxidized samples (66Pick E. Bromberg Y. Shpungin S. Gadba R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16476-16483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation of Neutral and Anionic Phospholipid Liposomes—These were prepared essentially as described in Ref. 67Sigal N. Gorzalczany Y. Pick E. Inflammation. 2003; 27: 147-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar. Briefly, PC, PS, PI, PG, and PA were dissolved in the buffer also used for membrane solubilization, containing 40 mm octyl glucoside, at a concentration of 5 mm. To facilitate solubilization, the phospholipids were first homogenized by using an ultrasonic processor (Vibra Cell, VCX 400 Watts, Sonics and Materials) at 20% amplitude for three 10 s cycles in ice-cooled tubes. The mixtures were stirred magnetically in ice-cooled glass vials till the appearance of a clear solution. Uncharged phospholipid liposomes were prepared from PC. Negatively charged liposomes were prepared by mixing 2-ml aliquots of a 5 mm solution of PC with 1-ml aliquots of a 5 mm solution of PS, PI, PG, or PA and dialyzing these against a 500-fold excess of detergent-free buffer, using dialysis membranes with a molecular weight cut-off of 25,000 (Spectrum Laboratories), for 18 h at 4 °C. The vesicles elute in the exclusion volume (corresponding to a Mr of ≥ 2 × 106) by gel filtration on a Superose 12 10/300 GL fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) column (Amersham Biosciences). Preliminary experiments, performed on a light scattering-based particle sizing apparatus (ALV-5000/EPP, ALV-GmbH, Langen, Germany) indicated that the vesicles were in the 250-300-nm diameter range. Enrichment of Macrophage Membranes in Neutral or Anionic Phospholipids—The lipid composition of macrophage membranes was modified by mixing 1 volume of phagocyte membranes, solubilized by 40 mm octyl glucoside and brought to a concentration of 1200 pmol cytochrome b559 heme/ml, with 4 volumes of PC, PS, PI, PG, or PA, at a concentration of 5 mm, dissolved in buffer containing 40 mm octyl glucoside. The mixtures were reconstituted into liposomes by dialysis against detergent-free buffer, as described in the preceding section. The concentration of cytochrome b559 was measured after dialysis and was normally found to be close to 240 pmol heme/ml; that of the added anionic phospholipids was 4 mm. The final concentration of cytochrome b559 heme of phospholipid-enriched membranes in cell-free oxidase assays was 5 nm, and the final concentration of anionic phospholipids in the assay was 80-85 μm.

Preparation of Recombinant Proteins—Non-prenylated Rac1 and Rac2, Rac1 mutants G12V and Q61L, and RhoGDI were expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins in Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus™ competent cells (Stratagene) and purified by affinity chromatography on glutathioneagarose (Sigma-Aldrich), followed by cleavage by thrombin in situ, as described in Ref. 70Mizrahi A.

https://openalex.org/W2011392246,"The overexpression or mutation of tyrosine kinases (TKs), such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), can lead to the development of cancer. The most common mutation of the EGFR in glioblastomas is the deletion of exons 2–7 known as the EGFRvIII. This mutant receptor cannot bind EGF but, instead, is constitutively active. The Cbl family of ubiquitin ligases (Cbl, Cbl-b, and Cbl-c) targets the activated EGFR for degradation. As the EGFRvIII is transforming, we investigated whether it could be downregulated by the Cbl proteins. The overexpression of all three Cbl proteins resulted in the ubiquitination and degradation of the EGFRvIII. As with the wild-type EGFR, the TK-binding domain and the RING finger of Cbl-b are sufficient for the downregulation of the EGFRvIII. Also, we found that Cbl-b is recruited to the EGFRvIII and inhibits the transformation of NIH 3T3 cells by the EGFRvIII. Mutation of the Cbl-binding site (Y1045F) in the EGFRvIII inhibits its ubiquitination and downregulation by Cbl-b and enhances its ability to transform. Furthermore, the EGFR TK inhibitor, AG 1478, prevents the downregulation of the EGFRvIII by the Cbl proteins and antagonizes the ability of an immunotoxin directed against the EGFRvIII to kill cells expressing this receptor. In conclusion, the EGFRvIII does not transform by escaping regulation by Cbl proteins and this activation-induced downregulation of the EGFRvIII has an important role in mediating the toxicity of anti-EGFRvIII immunotoxins."
https://openalex.org/W2120654325,"Studies of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) thymidine (dThd) kinase (TK) crystal structures show that purine and pyrimidine bases occupy distinct positions in the active site but approximately the same geometric plane. The presence of a bulky side chain, such as tyrosine at position 167, would not be sterically favorable for pyrimidine or pyrimidine nucleoside analogue binding, whereas purine nucleoside analogues would be less affected because they are located further away from the phenylalanine side chain. Site-directed mutagenesis of the conserved Ala-167 and Ala-168 residues in HSV-1 TK resulted in a wide variety of differential affinities and catalytic activities in the presence of the natural substrate dThd and the purine nucleoside analogue drug ganciclovir (GCV), depending on the nature of the amino acid mutation. A168H- and A167F-mutated HSV-1 TK enzymes turned out to have a virtually complete knock-out of dThd kinase activity (at least ∼4-5 orders of magnitude lower) presumably due to a steric clash between the mutated amino acid and the dThd ring. In contrast, a full preservation of the GCV (and other purine nucleoside analogues) kinase activity was achieved for A168H TK. The enzyme mutants also markedly lost their binding capacity for dThd and showed a substantially diminished feedback inhibition by thymidine 5′-triphosphate. The side chain size at position 168 seems to play a less important role regarding GCV or dThd selectivity than at position 167. Instead, the nitrogen-containing side chains from A168H and A168K seem necessary for efficient ligand discrimination. This explains why A168H-mutated HSV-1 TK fully preserves its GCV kinase activity (Vmax/Km 4-fold higher than wild-type HSV-1 TK), although still showing a severely compromised dThd kinase activity (Vmax/Km 3-4 orders of magnitude lower than wild-type HSV-1 TK).

Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) 2The abbreviations used are: HSV-1, herpes simplex virus type 1; TK, thymidine (dThd) kinase; GCV, ganciclovir; BVDU, bromovinyldeoxyuridine; dUrd, 2′-deoxyuridine; dTMP, 2′-deoxythymidylate; araT, 1-β-d-arabinofuranosylthymine; BVaraU, bromovinylarabinofuranosyluracil; ACV, acyclovir; PCV, penciclovir; dTTP, 2′-deoxythymidine-5′-triphosphate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; W T, wild-type. thymidine kinase (TK) recognizes, besides thymidine and 2′-deoxyuridine, also 2′-deoxycytidine and 2′-deoxythymidylate (dTMP) as natural substrates. In contrast with its cytosolic TK-1 counterpart, HSV-1 TK can also recognize a variety of dUrd analogues with modifications in the base moiety (i.e. 5-substituted dUrd derivatives such as (E)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-2′-deoxyuridine (BVDU, brivudin)) and/or in the sugar part, such as 1-β-d-arabinofuranosylthymine (araT) or BVaraU (sorivudine) (see Fig. 1). Interestingly, HSV-1 TK can also recognize a variety of guanine nucleoside analogues containing an acyclic or cyclic analogue of the 2′-deoxyribose moiety (i.e. ganciclovir (GCV), acyclovir (ACV), penciclovir (PCV), etc.) (Fig. 1). Specific recognition of these purine nucleoside analogues as a substrate for phosphorylation is required to express a potent antiviral activity of the test compounds. Several attempts have been made to increase the catalytic activity of HSV-1 TK for GCV and ACV by mutagenesis of the active site of the enzyme. Random sequence mutagenesis at a segment of the putative nucleoside binding site created new HSV-1 TKs with preferential phosphorylation of GCV and/or ACV. In these studies, six codons (encoding Leu-159, Ile-160, Phe-161, Ala-168, Leu-169, and Leu-170) were targeted (1Black M.E. Newcomb T.G. Wilson H.-M.P. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3525-3529Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 2Kokoris M.S. Sabo P. Adam E.T. Black M.E. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 1415-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 3Kokoris M.S. Sabo P. Black M.E. Anticancer Res. 2000; 20: 959-964PubMed Google Scholar). Thymidine and GCV phosphorylation could not be improved, but ACV phosphorylation could be enhanced for the TK enzymes containing Leu-160 + Leu-161 + Val-168 + Met-169 (4.3-fold) or Leu-161 + Ser-168 + Tyr-169 + Cys-170 (2.0-fold). In a number of cases, the ratios of GCV/dThd or ACV/dThd phosphorylation by the mutant enzymes could be increased by ∼20-30-fold (1Black M.E. Newcomb T.G. Wilson H.-M.P. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3525-3529Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The creation of a second generation semi-randomized mutant TK library further optimized the enzyme for GCV/ACV substrate sensitivity. These HSV-1 TK mutants contained, besides other mutations in the substrate active site, predominantly 168F/Y (4Black M.E. Kokoris M.S. Sabo P. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3022-3026PubMed Google Scholar). The ratio of catalytic capacity of the mutant TKs with GCV or ACV versus dThd increased up to 11-83-fold or 70-567-fold, respectively (4Black M.E. Kokoris M.S. Sabo P. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3022-3026PubMed Google Scholar). One mutant HSV-1 TK (I160F + F161A + A168F) (designated SR-39) was endowed with a 14-fold decrease in Km for GCV compared with wild-type TK. The SR-26 mutant HSV-1 TK (L159I + I160F + F161L + A168F + L169H) showed a 124-fold decrease in Km with ACV as the substrate. However, the kcat values were also markedly decreased by these mutations. The SR-39 TK mutant enzyme had kcat values that were 27-35-fold less than wild-type TK for dThd, GCV, and ACV, and the SR-26 TK mutant kcat values of the enzyme were 32-54-fold less than the wild type (5Kokoris M.S. Black M.E. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2267-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In other studies, mutations at the pyrimidine base-binding amino acid Gln-125 and nearby sites involved in catalysis and substrate binding resulted also in mutant HSV-1 TKs with lower dThd-phosphorylating potential, although retaining pronounced GCV-phosphorylating activity (6Mercer K.E. Ahn C.E. Coke A. Compadre C.M. Drake R.R. Protein Eng. 2002; 15: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). On the basis of the distinct characteristics of dThd versus GCV binding to the HSV-1 TK and computer-assisted modeling studies, we previously introduced a Tyr instead of the conserved Ala at amino acid position 167 of the enzyme (7Degrève B. De Clercq E. Balzarini J. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1543-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). We found that the A167Y mutant TK completely lost its pyrimidine nucleos(t)ide-phosphorylating activity but still showed pronounced GCV/ACV/PCV-phosphorylating potential, although clearly inferior to wild-type HSV-1 TK (7Degrève B. De Clercq E. Balzarini J. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1543-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 8Balzarini J. Liekens S. Esnouf R. De Clercq E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6517-6524Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, further modeling studies led us to hypothesize that introduction of less bulky amino acids than tyrosine at position 167 or more bulky amino acids than wild-type alanine at position 168 in HSV-1 TK would enhance substrate selectivity. Specifically, such changes may still provide sufficient steric hindrance to the methyl group of thymine, although allowing ganciclovir to be kept further away from the functional group of amino acid 167 and, in particular, amino acid 168 to avoid any negative interference with this latter substrate. To validate this proposal, we decided to perform an in-depth site-directed mutagenesis study at amino acid positions 167 and 168 of HSV-1 TK. This study led to better insights into the role of different amino acids in the dThd- and GCV-phosphorylating capacity of the mutated HSV-1 TK enzymes and to the design and construction of mutant HSV-1 TKs with superior GCV/dThd catalytic ratios than the existing mutant HSV-1 TKs. In particular, we aimed to fully preserve the catalytic activity for GCV and related analogues and, at the same time, to abolish as much as possible the dThd catalytic activity. It was found that A167F- and A168H-mutated HSV-1 TKs showed the highest ratio of GCV kinase/dThd kinase activity. In particular, A168H HSV-1 TK proved the most interesting enzyme mutant with fully preserved GCV catalytic substrate activity and heavily compromised dThd kinase activity both at the same time. Such a discriminative activity has never previously been observed by one single amino acid point mutation in HSV-1 TK. The insights obtained have resulted in a new predictive structural modeling approach for generating substrate-specific HSV-1 TKs and are instrumental in optimizing HSV-1 TK enzyme constructs for use in combined gene/chemotherapy of cancer or other diseases. Construction, Expression, and Purification of Wild-Type and Mutant HSV-1 TK—Mutant HSV-1 TK enzymes were derived from the TK sequence cloned in pGEX-5X-1 (Amersham Biosciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden) (7Degrève B. De Clercq E. Balzarini J. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1543-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene; Westburg, Leusden, The Netherlands) as described previously (9Degrève B. Esnouf R. De Clercq E. Balzarini J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1326-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The two complementary oligonucleotide primers (Invitrogen) that were used contained the desired mutation at amino acid position 167 or 168 of HSV-1 TK (Table 1). The mutant DNA was transformed into competent Escherichia coli XL-1 blue. Plasmid preparations from ampicillin-resistant colonies were checked by sequencing of the TK gene on an ABI Prism 3100 sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using the ABI Prism Big Dye Terminator cycle-sequencing ready reaction Kit (Applied Biosystems) and transfected in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS. Transfected bacteria were grown overnight in 2YT (yeast/tryptone) medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (40 μg/ml) and then diluted in fresh medium. After further growth of the bacteria at 27 °C (for 5 h), isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm to induce the production of the GST-TK fusion proteins. After 16 h of further growth at 27 °C, the cells were pelleted and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.15 mg/ml lysosyme). Bacterial suspensions were passed through a SLM Aminco French pressure cell press (Beun de Ronde, La Abcoude, The Netherlands) and ultracentrifuged (11,000 rounds/min, 4 °C, 30 min). GST-TK was purified from the supernatant using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) as described by the supplier. The protein content of the purified fractions was assessed with the Bradford reagent (Sigma) using bovine serum as the concentration standard.TABLE 1Site-directed mutagenesis primers to construct the mutated HSV-1 TKs at amino acid positions 167 and 168MutationSense primer sequenceA167Y5′–CGACCGCCATCCCATCTATGCCCTCCTGTGCTAC–3′A167H5′–CGACCGCCATCCCATCCACGCCCTCCTGTGCTAC–3′A167W5′–CGACCGCCATCCCATCTGGGCCCTCCTGTGCTAC–3′A167I5′–CGACCGCCATCCCATCATCGCCCTCCTGTGCTAC–3′A167E5′–CGACCGCCATCCCATCGAGGCCCTCCTGTGCTAC–3′A167K5′–CGACCGCCATCCCATCAAAGCCCTCCTGTGCTAC–3′A167N5′–CGACCGCCATCCCATCAACGCCCTCCTGTGCTAC–3′A167C5′–CGCCATCCCATCTGCGCCCTCCTGTGCTAC–3′A167T5′–CGCCATCCCATCACCGCCCTCCTGTGCTAC–3′A167S5′–CGCCATCCCATCTCCGCCCTCCTGTGCTAC–3′A167F5′–CGACCGCCATCCCATCTTTGCCCTCCTGTGCTAC–3′A168Y5′–CGCCATCCCATCGCCTATCTCCTGTGCTAC–3′A168H5′–CGCCATCCCATCGCCCACCTCCTGTGCTAC–3′A168W5′–CGCCATCCCATCGCCTGGCTCCTGTGCTAC–3′A168I5′–CGCCATCCCATCGCCATTCTCCTGTGCTAC–3′A168E5′–CGCCATCCCATCGCCGAGCTCCTGTGCTAC–3′A168K5′–CGCCATCCCATCGCCAAGCTCCTGTGCTAC–3′A168N5′–CGCCATCCCATCGCCAATCTCCTGTGCTAC–3′A168C5′–CGCCATCCCATCGCCTGCCTCCTGTGCTAC–3′A168T5′–CGCCATCCCATCGCCACCCTCCTGTGCTAC–3′A168S5′–CGCCATCCCATCGCCTCCCTCCTGTGCTAC–3′A168F5′–CCGCCATCCCATCGCCTTTCTCCTGTGCTACCCG–3′ Open table in a new tab Radiolabeled Compounds—[3H]Ganciclovir (12.4 Ci/mmol), [3H]lobucavir (26 Ci/mmol), and [3H]penciclovir (16 Ci/mmol) were obtained from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). [3H]dThd (50 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Biosciences. dThd and GCV Kinase Assays—The ability of the purified HSV-1 TK WT and mutant HSV-1 A167 and A168 TK preparations to phosphorylate [3H]dThd and [3H]GCV was determined as follows. The standard reaction mixture contained 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2.5 mm ATP, 10 mm NaF, a variety of [3H]dThd and [3H]GCV concentrations, and WT HSV-1 TK and mutant Ala-167 and -168 HSV-1 TK preparation in a total reaction mixture of 50 μlof50mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. At this time point, it was ascertained that the reaction still proceeded linearly for all HSV-1 TK enzyme mutants evaluated in the presence of dThd and GCV concentrations that were approximately equal to the respective Km values and five times the Km values. (i.e. For dThd, 0.15 and 0.75 μm for WT TK; 50 and 250 μm for A168Y TK; 750 and 3750 μm for A168H TK; 200 and 1000 μm for A168W TK; 5 and 25 μm for A168I TK; 50 and 250 μm for A168E TK; 200 and 1000 μm for A168K TK; 10 and 50 μm for A168N TK; 5 and 25 μm for A168C TK; 5 and 25 μm for A168T TK; 0.5 and 2.5μm for A168S TK; 5 and 25μm for A168F TK; 1000 and 5000 μm for A167E TK; 1000 and 5000 μm for A167N TK; 2 and 10 μm for A167C TK, 2 and 10 μm for A167T TK; and 0.5 and 2.5μm for A167S TK.

The reactions were terminated by spotting an aliquot of 45 μl onto DE-81 disks (Whatman; Maidstone, UK) that were instantly immersed and thoroughly washed three times in 1 mm HCOONH4 and one time in ethanol (70%). Finally, the disks were dried and assayed for radioactivity in a scintillant. The influence of different concentrations of dThd, BVDU, and dTTP on the phosphorylation of [8-3H]GCV was determined by incubating 50-μl reaction mixtures at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence of 1.6μm [8-3H]GCV (1μCi), a variety of compound concentrations (i.e. 8, 40, 200 and 1000 μm), and WT HSV-1 TK, mutant A167F, or A168H HSV-1 TK. The phosphorylation of different concentrations of [3H]GCV, [3H]PCV, and [3H]ACV (i.e. 400, 200, 150, 125, 100, 67, 40, 20, 15, 12.5, 10, 6.7, and 4 μm) in the presence of wild-type HSV-1 TK and mutant A168H HSV-1 TK was carried out as described above. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and then subjected to high performance liquid chromatography analysis using a Parti-sphere-SAX column. A linear gradient of 5 mm (NH4)H2PO4, pH 5.0 (buffer A), to 0.3 m (NH4)H2PO4, pH 5.0 (buffer B), was used to separate the metabolites as follows: 5 min of 100% buffer A, 15 min of a linear gradient to 100% buffer B, 20 min of 100% buffer B, 5 min of a linear gradient to 100% buffer A, and 5 min of equilibration with buffer A. The flow rate was 2 ml/min. Modeling Studies—The Protein Data Bank-coded HSV-1 TK structures 1E2J (10Vogt J. Perozzo R. Pautsch A. Prota A. Schelling P. Pilger B. Folkers G. Scapozza L. Schulz G.E.

Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23605) Google Scholar). The same software was used to generate the different enzyme mutants, the carbon-α chain was kept identical to the model structures, and the side chains were fitted by hand in the active site. The pictures were drawn by PYMOL (DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA). Eleven different amino acid mutations have been introduced in the catalytic substrate-active site of HSV-1 TK at positions 167 and 168, and the mutated enzymes were evaluated for their potential to phosphorylate dThd and GCV. The kinetic Km and Vmax constants were determined for each of the mutant enzymes and depicted in Tables 2 and 3. Figs. 2 and 3 depict the phosphorylating capacity (Vmax/Km) of the individual mutant Ala-167 and Ala-168 TK enzymes for dThd and GCV. Among the TKs mutated at codon 167, replacing alanine by other amino acids with relatively small functional groups, such as serine, cysteine, or threonine, did not markedly affect the kinetic properties of the enzyme with respect to dThd and GCV phosphorylation. In contrast, bulky side-chains at position 167, such as the aromatic amino acids Tyr, Phe, His, and Trp dramatically compromised the dThd kinase activity, yet retained pronounced GCV-phosphorylating capacity. The mutant A167F TK had the highest GCV-phosphorylating capacity (∼8-fold higher than the previously reported A167Y TK) (9Degrève B. Esnouf R. De Clercq E. Balzarini J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1326-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and a deleted dThd kinase activity. The higher Vmax/Km value of A167F TK was mainly because of a substantially lower Km for GCV compared with the A167Y TK mutant enzyme (Table 2). Also the charged mutants A167E and A167K TK, and surprisingly also the mutant A167I TK, had neither measurable dThd kinase nor GCV kinase activity. When the ratio of the GCV/dThd-phosphorylating potential of all 167 mutated TK enzymes were compared, A167F-mutated TK proved to be the most successful enzyme (Table 2, Fig. 2).TABLE 2Kinetic values of HSV-1 TK mutated at amino acid position 167 Data are the mean ± S.D. for at least two independent experiments.

The charged amino acid substitutions resulted in a better GCV phosphorylation than the corresponding Ala-167 mutants, but in both (A168E and A168K) TK mutants, dThd kinase was virtually abolished (Table 3). Interestingly, the mutant HSV-1 A168H TK proved to be endowed with the highest discriminating capacity between GCV and dThd phosphorylation. Its Km for GCV was identical to the Km of wild-type HSV-1 TK for GCV, and its Vmax was ∼ 4-fold higher than wild-type TK, whereas its dThd kinase-phosphorylating potential was >3-4 orders of magnitude lower than wild-type TK (Table 3, Fig. 3). Whereas several mutant Ala-167 HSV-1 TKs were completely devoid of dThd kinase activity (below the limit of detection) (Table 1), the mutant Ala-168 HSV-1 TKs usually had detectable dThd kinase activities, although in a number of cases (i.e. A168H, A168E, A168K), this residual TK activity proved at least 3-4 orders of magnitude lower than wild-type HSV-1 TK activity (Table 3). The Km and Vmax values for each mutant enzyme were obtained by measuring the direct conversion of GCV or dThd to their corresponding phosphate derivatives. To reveal whether the mutant TK enzymes that show the highest ratio of GCV versus dThd phosphorylating potential (i.e. A168H TK and A167F TK) still keep the potential of non-functionally binding dThd, we have assessed the competition of dThd and the dThd analogue BVDU at a range of concentrations for the mutant HSV-1 TKs in the presence of radiolabeled GCV. Clearly, dThd (and BVDU) had substantially lost the capacity to bind to the mutant A168H and A167F HSV-1 TK enzymes, because they poorly inhibit mutant TK-catalyzed GCV phosphorylation (Fig. 4). The feedback inhibition of GCV phosphorylation by dTTP was also much less pronounced than with wild-type TK (Fig. 4). Given the differences in GCV and ACV phosphorylation found for previously reported HSV-1 TK mutants by Black et al. (4Black M.E. Kokoris M.S. Sabo P. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3022-3026PubMed Google Scholar), we performed phosphorylation studies with GCV but also with ACV and PCV and found identical kinetic properties for wild type and the mutant A168H enzyme for each individual purine nucleoside analogue (data not shown). These data confirm that introduction of the A168H mutation into HSV-1 TK does not affect phosphorylation of any of the guanine nucleoside analogues but results in heavily compromised dThd kinase activity. The Km value of wild-type HSV-1 TK for GCV, but not for dThd, proved 2.5-3.5-fold lower under our experimental conditions than previously reported by other investigators. Field et al. (13Field A.K. Davies M.E. DeWitt C. Perry H.C. Liou R. Germershausen J. Karkas J.D. Ashton W.T. Johnston D.B. Tolman R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4139-4143Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) report a Km = 66 μm for GCV against native HSV-1 (Patton strain) TK from HSV-1-infected HeLa cell cultures. Kokoris and Black (5Kokoris M.S. Black M.E. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2267-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) found 47.6 μm for recombinant HSV-1 TK (derived from the pET23d; HSV TK-Dummy vector) purified on a 3′-aminothymidine affinity column, and Bohman et al. (14Bohman C. Balzarini J. Wigerinck P. Van Aerschot A. Herdewijn P. De Clercq E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8036-8043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) report a Km = 45 μm for GCV against purified native HSV-1 (F strain) TK derived from HSV-1 TK gene-transfected mammary carcinoma FM3A TK-/HSV-1 TK+ cell cultures. The somewhat lower Km of 18 μm for GCV against purified recombinant HSV-1 (Lyons strain) TK found in our study could not be explained by the presence of GST covalently linked to the HSV-1 TK, because it was ascertained that removal of GST from the wild-type and A168H HSV-1 TK fusion protein did not change the Km value for GCV (a Km of 18 and 13 μm for the wild-type and A168H GST-HSV-1 TK fusion protein versus a Km of 21 and 18 μm for the wild-type and A168H HSV-1 TK). However, differences in Km for GCV may perhaps be explained by the different virus strains from which the TKs were derived. A wide variety of catalytic activities and affinities could be observed for the mutant enzymes in the presence of different amino acids at positions 167 and 168. Most of the increased or decreased catalytic activities for dThd and GCV could be explained in a structural context. Mutations at amino acid residue 167 show an abolishment of the dThd kinase activity in the presence of bulky side chains (Fig. 5). Indeed, the 5-methyl group of dThd or any other substituents at this position would clash with large amino acid side chain residues. It is noticeable that the GCV activity varies among the bulky residues. The A167F mutation in TK presents the highest GCV activity. A167Y TK activity is lower than the latter, despite the side chains being of similar bulk. We suggest that tyrosine at 167 makes a hydrogen bond via its hydroxyl side chain to the purine ring and freezes GCV in a conformation not optimal for the phosphorylation. In conclusion, hydrophobic and bulky side chains at position 167 seem to be the best residues to select for GCV activity, apart from residues such as tryptophan that are probably too bulky to fit in the binding pocket. Adding any charged or polar residues does not improve GCV binding. Mutations at residue 168 have a lower discriminating power, regarding GCV and dThd activities as substrates, compared with mutations at residue 167. Indeed, mutated residue side chains would be oriented in a way that is less disruptive for GCV and dThd binding (Fig. 6). Most of the mutations seem to affect the Km for dThd (from 3- to 4000-fold) but not the Vmax (Table 2); therefore, only the apparent binding affinity of dThd is affected rather than its rate of phosphorylation. Additionally, the same mutations only slightly affect GCV binding, meaning that any putative active site modifications are situated around dThd and not GCV. Mutations Lys, His, and Trp significantly increase the dThd Km, at least 1000-4000-fold. In the case of Lys and His, it is interesting to note that both residues have nitrogen on their side chain, which appears somehow to be involved in interference with dThd binding and not GCV binding presumably because the latter has no oxygen to make a bond with the mutated residue. Profound structural insights in the substrate active site of HSV-1 TK are required to enable rational development of novel enzyme constructs that recognize new nucleoside analogues as a substrate or improve the substrate affinity and/or catalytic activity of existing substrates. Because combined gene/chemotherapy of cancer makes use of the HSV-1 TK gene as a suicide gene to be used in combination with anti-herpetic drugs such as GCV or ACV, our findings may have a direct application in this field. Indeed, mutant HSV-1 TKs with substantially high Km values for the natural substrate dThd can have a distinct advantage in preferentially phosphorylating purine nucleoside analogues such as GCV, ACV, or PCV because of reduced competition with dThd for the active site and a less pronounced feedback inhibition by dTTP, which also binds to the dThd site. Because GCV and ACV have markedly higher Km values for wild-type HSV-1 TK than dThd (∼100- and 1,000-fold, respectively), knocking out of the pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylation site may become crucial to guaranteeing an efficient phosphorylation of the purine nucleosides in the in vivo (tumor) environment. In fact, our preliminary investigations reveal that uncloned human osteosarcoma (OST TK-) tumor cell cultures transduced by the mutant A168H HSV-1 TK gene construct became markedly more sensitive to the cytostatic activity of GCV, PCV, and ACV than the parent cell cultures. Moreover, the addition of 50 μm thymidine or BVDU did not reverse the cytostatic activity of these test compounds against the OST TK-/HSV-1 A168H TK tumor cells under conditions where GCV, PCV, and ACV toxicity could be reversed by dThd in osteosarcoma tumor cell cultures transduced by the wild-type HSV-1 TK gene (data not shown). These preliminary findings validate the beneficial kinetic properties of the mutant A168H HSV-1 TK gene construct. The novel mutant enzyme constructs reported in this study may also prove their value in imaging reporter gene expression in vivo through non-invasive positron emission tomography (PET) scan detection of fluorinated (18F) nucleoside analogues (in particular F-GCV and F-PCV). Our findings that the fluorinated PCV is equally efficiently converted to its monophosphate derivative as the parent unsubstituted PCV against A168H TK 3J. Balzarini and G. Bormans, unpublished data. opens interesting perspectives for the mutated A168H (or A167F) HSV-1 TK construct to be used for such an application. Also, other indications, including the prevention of graft versus host disease using a suicide gene expressed in T-lymphocytes (15Cohen J.L. Boyer O. Salomon B. Onclercq R. Charlotte F. Bruel S.

https://openalex.org/W2096227747,"It is well established that even small changes in amino acid side chains of antigenic peptide bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) protein may completely abrogate recognition of the peptide-MHC (pMHC) complex by the T cell receptor (TCR). Often, however, several nonconservative substitutions in the peptide antigen are accommodated and do not impair its recognition by TCR. For example, a preponderance of natural sequence variants of the human immunodeficiency virus p17 Gag-derived peptide SLYNTVATL (SL9) are recognized by cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which implies that interactions with SL9 variants are degenerate both with respect to the class I MHC molecule and with respect to TCR. Here we study the molecular basis for this degenerate recognition of SL9 variants. We show that several SL9 variants bind comparably well to soluble HLA-A2 and to a particular soluble TCR and that these variants are active in the cognate cytotoxicity assay. Natural SL9 variation is restricted by its context in the HIV p17 matrix protein. High resolution crystal structures of seven selected SL9 variants bound to HLA-A2 all have remarkably similar peptide conformations and side-chain dispositions outside sites of substitution. This preservation of the peptide conformation despite epitope variations suggests a mechanism for the observed degeneracy in pMHC recognition by TCR and may contribute to the persistence of SL9-mediated immune responses in chronically infected individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2064366517,"Understanding the molecular mechanisms of transition state regulator proteins is critical, since they play a pivotal role in the ability of bacteria to cope with changing environments. Although much effort has focused on their genetic characterization, little is known about their structural and functional conservation. Here we present the high resolution NMR solution structure of the N-terminal domain of the <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> transition state regulator Abh (AbhN), only the second such structure to date. We then compare AbhN to the N-terminal DNA-binding domain of <i>B. subtilis</i> AbrB (AbrBN). This is the first such comparison between two AbrB-like transition state regulators. AbhN and AbrBN are very similar, suggesting a common structural basis for their DNA binding.

These data indicate that single amino acid residues located in the switch II region of Rho proteins determine enzyme specificity for diverse bacterial toxins. The family of Rho GTPases comprises ∼20 proteins that act as molecular switches in a network of cellular processes responsible for regulation of the cytoskeleton, cell polarity, secretion, gene transcription, and cell cycle progression (1Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar, 2Ridley A.J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1256-1264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Highly specific functions have been described for individual members of the Rho GTPase family, e.g. RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42 are involved in formation of stress fibers, lamellipodia, and filopodia, respectively (3Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3875) Google Scholar). Within their functional networks, Rho GTPases may act in a concerted action, for example to promote directed cell migration by RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42 (4Raftopoulou M. Hall A. Dev. Biol. 2004; 265: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). Antagonistic functions of Rho GTPases have also been described. For example, RhoD, which reportedly plays a role in endocytic trafficking (5Murphy C. Saffrich R. Grummt W. Gournier H. Rybin V. Rubino M. Auvinen P. Lütcke A. Parton R.G. Zerial M. Nature. 1996; 384: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), may act in an antagonistic manner to RhoA (6Tsubakimoto K. Matsumoto K. Abe H. Ishii J. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Endo T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2431-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Microinjection of constitutively active RhoD leads to the disassembly of actin stress fibers, and cell migration is diminished after expression of constitutively active RhoD in 10T1/2 cells (6Tsubakimoto K. Matsumoto K. Abe H. Ishii J. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Endo T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2431-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). So far, the structural basis for these specific actions of Rho GTPases is not well understood. The activity of Rho proteins is regulated by GTP binding initiated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors, which turn GTPases into an active conformation (7Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A. Science. 2001; 294: 1299-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1395) Google Scholar). Only this conformation allows high affinity binding to effector proteins. In the case of RhoA, downstream effector molecules such as ROCK, mDia, or PKN are activated to elicit multiple cellular functions (8Wennerberg K. Der C.J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1301-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 9Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar). For RhoD it was recently shown that only human Dia2C exhibits a proper binding site and leads in concert with c-Src tyrosine kinase to a reduction in early endosomal motility along actin filaments (10Gasman S. Kalaidzidis Y. Zerial M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Some bacterial protein toxins alter the activity of Rho/Ras GTPases in a highly specific manner. Clostridial glycosylating toxins like toxin B of Clostridium difficile and Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin mono-glucosylate low molecular mass GTPases and inhibit their function (11Aktories K.

Like toxin B, CNF1 and DNT modify RhoA, -B, -C, Rac1, and Cdc42, but not RhoD. As known from NMR studies and co-crystal structures (23Dvorsky R. Ahmadian M.R. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 1130-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), major contact points between Rho proteins and effectors or regulators frequently include the switch I, switch II, and the α2 region. Less is known about the structural basis that defines the specificity of toxin-GTPase interaction. In this study we determined the regions within the Rho proteins RhoA and RhoD that are responsible for the recognition by glucosylating and deamidating/transglutaminating toxins. By constructing chimeras and several point mutations, we were able to narrow down the regions in RhoA and RhoD that define substrate specificity for the glucosylating and deamidating/transglutaminating toxins, respectively. We show that single amino acid residues in or near the switch II region are responsible for substrate properties of the toxins. Materials—UDP-[14C]glucose (287.4 mCi/mmol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and PCR primers were from Biochip Technologies (Freiburg, Germany). All other reagents were of analytical grade and purchased from commercial sources. Construction of GTPase Chimeras—The GTPase chimeras were constructed using the splicing by overlap extension method described previously (24Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2648) Google Scholar). In brief, two polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were performed, each amplifying the sequences that have to be fused. The products of the two first PCRs were pooled and cycled in a third PCR in which the over-hanging sequences act as primers. We used pGEX2T-RhoA (wild type, WT) and pGEX2TGL-RhoD (WT) as templates with the following primers: RhoD103RhoA:RhoD (5′-GAAATGCTTCACCTCTGGGTACC-3′); RhoD103RhoA:RhoA (5′-CCAGAGGTGAAGCATTTCTGTC-3′); RhoD79RhoA:RhoD (5′-CATCAGTATGACATTGGCATCAGG-3′); RhoD79RhoA: RhoA (5′-GCCAATGTCATACTGATGTGTTTTTC-3′); RhoA59RhoD:RhoD (5′-GTGGGACACAGCCGGGCAAG-3′); RhoA59RhoD:RhoA (5′-CCCGGCTGTGTCCCACAAAGCCAAC-3′); and pGEX primers either annealing 5′ or 3′ of the multiple cloning site: pGEX 5′ of multiple cloning sequence (5′-TAGCATGGCCTTTGCAGGG-3′); pGEX 3′ of multiple cloning sequence (5′-TGTGTCAGAGGTTTTCACCG-3′). The product of the second PCR was subjected to BamHI and EcoRI cleavage and subcloned into a pGEX2TGL vector. The sites of splicing are numbered according to RhoA nomenclature. The chimera RhoA59RhoD79RhoA was constructed with splicing by overlap extension by using the primers for RhoA59RhoD with pGEX2TGL RhoD79RhoA serving as template. Site-directed Mutagenesis of Toxin Fragments—The QuikChange™ kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) in combination with Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase was used for the replacement of one to three nucleotides in the pGEX2T-RhoA (WT) or pGEX2TGL-RhoD (WT) plasmids. Primers were constructed as follows: RhoA E64D sense/antisense (5′-GACACAGCTGGGCAGGACGATTATGATCGCC-3′/5′-GGCGATCATAATCGTCCTGCCCAGCTGTGTC-3′); RhoA S73F sense/antisense (5′-CCTGAGGCCCCTCTTCTACCCAGATACC-3′/5′-GGTATCTGGGTAGAAGAGGGGCCTCAGG-3′); RhoD D76E sense/antisense (5′-GCCGGGCAAGAAGACTATGACCGC-3′/5′-GCGGTCATAGTCTTCTTGCCCGGC-3′); RhoD F85S sense/antisense (5′-CGGCCCTTGTCCTATCCTGATGCC-3′/5′-GGCATCAGGATAGGACAAGGGCCG-3′); RhoA Q63E/E64D sense/antisense (5′-GACACAGCTGGGGAGGACGATTATGATCGCC-3′/5′-GGCGATCATAATCGTCCTCCCCAGCTGTGTC-3′); RhoD Q75E/D76E sense/antisense (5′-GGGACACAGCCGGGGAAGAAGACTATGAC-3′/5′-GTCATAGTCTTCTTCCCCGGCTGTGTCCC-3′). Corresponding plasmids were selected in E. coli XL1-Blue (Stratagene) followed by transformation into E. coli BL-21 (DE3) (Invitrogen) for expression. Sequencing—All constructs were checked by sequencing with ABI PRISM™ Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit and ABI 310 Cycle sequencer (PerkinElmer). Protein Expression—Toxin fragments, GTP-binding proteins, and their mutants and chimeras were prepared from their GST fusion proteins from the E. coli expression vector pGEX-2T (GE Healthcare) as described (14Just I. Selzer J. Wilm M. Von Eichel-Streiber C. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1995; 375: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar, 21Schmidt G. Sehr P. Wilm M. Selzer J. Mann M. Aktories K.

Selzer J. Lerm M. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13669-13674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The basis of the assay of transglutamination is the use of the autofluorescent co-substrate monodansylcadaverine that is attached to the Rho GTPase by the transglutaminating toxins. Briefly, GST-GTP-binding proteins or chimeric proteins (3-6 μg) were incubated with or without the GST-CNF1 or the catalytic C-terminal part of DNT (ΔDNT, amino acid residues 1136-1451) in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mm monodansylcadaverine for the indicated times and temperatures. As controls, GST-RhoA, GST-RhoD, and their corresponding mutants were incubated without the toxin but in the presence of co-substrate. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the transglutaminated proteins were detected under UV light (206 nm). Subsequently, the gel was Coomassie stained to check the amount of proteins. Quantification was performed with ImageQuant (GE Healthcare). Glucosylation Reaction—Recombinant GTP-binding proteins (50 μg/ml) were incubated with recombinant toxin fragments (concentrations as indicated) and 10 μm UDP-[14C]glucose in a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, and 100 μg/ml of bovine serum albumin for the indicated times at 30 °C. Total volume was 20 μl. Labeled proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by phosphorimaging (GE Healthcare). Mass Spectrometry—A glycosyltransfer reaction was performed with 127 pmol RhoD F85S as substrate and 1.6 pmol of the enzymatic fragments of toxin B (toxin-B546) and the toxin B mutant (toxin-B546 I383S/Q385A) in the presence of the indicated UDP sugars. The reaction was stopped and the proteins purified from salts and contaminants by precipitation in 80% acetone. After washing and drying by vacuum centrifugation, the pellet was resolved in 5 μl of chymotrypsin cleavage buffer containing 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate and 5 mm CaCl2 at pH 7.8. Chymotrypsin (0.2 μg) (Roche Diagnostics) was added to a final volume of 10 μl, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Afterward the obtained peptide solution was mixed with a saturated matrix solution of 4-hydroxy-α-cyanocinnamic acid according to the dried droplet method for matrix crystallization, resulting in a fine granular matrix layer. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry was performed on a Bruker Biflex mass spectrometer equipped with a nitrogen laser (λ, 337 nm). Mass spectra were recorded in the reflector-positive mode in combination with delayed extraction. For calibration an external two point calibration with 5 pmol of a fragment of human adrenocorticotropic hormone (amino acids 18-39, (M+H)+ 2,465.20 Da; Sigma) and 5 pmol of human angiotensin II ((M+H)+ 1,046.54 Da; Sigma) were used. Glucosylated peptides were identified by an increase in mass by 162 Da. To prove that the increase in mass was caused by glycosylation, we performed the glycosylation assay also with the mutant toxin B (toxin-B546 I383S/Q385A), which was recently shown to catalyze the N-acetylglucosaminylation of Rho proteins in the presence of UDP-GlcNAc (25Jank T. Reinert D.J. Giesemann T. Schulz G.E. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37833-37838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In this case the same peptides increased by 203 Da in mass (not shown). Glucosylation of RhoA and RhoD by C. difficile Toxin B and C. sordellii Lethal Toxin—As shown in Fig. 2A, toxin B glucosylated RhoA, but not RhoD. Vice versa, when lethal toxin was used at a concentration of 50 nm, RhoD was a substrate, but no glucosylation was detectable with RhoA (Fig. 2G). To investigate the structural basis for substrate recognition of RhoA and RhoD by toxin B and lethal toxin, we constructed several RhoA-RhoD chimeras and single amino acid mutant proteins as shown in Fig. 3. The toxins were used as recombinant truncated N-terminal parts (amino acids 1-546) that harbor the fully active enzymatic domain (27Hofmann F. Busch C. Prepens U. Just I. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11074-11078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 28Hofmann F. Busch C. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1076-1081Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of toxin B, this domain is released into the cytosol by proteolytic cleavage (29Pfeifer G. Schirmer J. Leemhuis J. Busch C. Meyer D.K. Aktories K. Barth H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 11074-11078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar).FIGURE 3Illustration of the RhoA-RhoD chimeras used in this study. The constructed chimeras are shown as a scheme in primary sequence and three-dimensional structure of RhoA-GDP (Protein Data Bank code 1FTN). For RhoD a three-dimensional model based on the structure of RhoA is shown. Areas of RhoD are presented in black and RhoA in white. The switch II region is marked by a dashed circle. Images were prepared using Pymol (DeLano Scientific LCC).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) After replacement of the N-terminal part of RhoA (amino acids 1-103) by the corresponding RhoD domain (amino acids 1-115, see Fig. 3), this chimera displayed the typical RhoD enzyme specificity, e.g. no modification occurred with toxin B and minor glucosylation was obtained with lethal toxin (Fig. 2, B and H). The same results were obtained with the construct RhoD79RhoA (Fig. 2, C and I; note, RhoA numbering). This chimera was comprised of the N-terminal part of RhoD (amino acids 1-91), which was fused to the C-terminal part of RhoA. These results localized the substrate recognition sites of toxin B and lethal toxin in the N-terminal parts of the small GTPases RhoA and RhoD. When the small RhoD part, comprising amino acids 71-91 (RhoA numbering amino acids 59-79), was introduced into RhoA, the sandwich chimera was not modified by toxin B (Fig. 2D). On the other hand, the chimera was 14C glucosylated by lethal toxin, demonstrating a switch in the substrate recognition based on these 16 amino acid residues (Fig. 2J). Amino acids 71-91 of RhoD and the equivalent residues 59-79 of RhoA include the switch II region, the α2 helix, and a part of the following loop. A comparison of this region among Rho GTPase family members showed that only 5 amino acid residues differed between RhoD and the other Rho proteins (Fig. 4A). Considering surface-exposed amino acids within the group of variant amino acid residues, we focused our next studies on analysis of the role of glutamine 64 and serine 73 of RhoA and the corresponding residues aspartic acid 76 and phenylalanine 85 of RhoD (Fig. 4B). When serine 73 of RhoA was exchanged to phenylalanine (RhoA S73F), the GTPase was not modified by toxin B (Fig. 2E). However, the mutant GTPase was now glucosylated by lethal toxin (Fig. 2K). Thus, these results demonstrated that the switch in the substrate recognition was based on a single amino acid exchange. Accordingly, RhoD F85S became a substrate for toxin B (Fig. 2F). A weak modification by lethal toxin remained (Fig. 2L). For each of the mutant proteins the time course of glucosylation by toxin B and lethal toxin, respectively, was studied (Fig. 5). These studies showed that the kinetics of glucosylation were linear and that different substrate properties of the mutants were not caused by changes in the stability of the proteins. To obtain further evidence for attachment of glucose to RhoD F85S, we performed MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric analysis. After glucosylation of RhoD F85S by toxin B in the presence and absence of UDP-glucose, we purified the proteins by acetone precipitation and digested the proteins with chymotrypsin. The obtained peptide fragments were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Two peptides (equivalent to amino acids 38-51 and amino acids 38-54) with masses of m/z 1500.72 and 1948.97, respectively, obtained from modified RhoD F85S were shifted to a higher mass of plus 162 Da, indicating a modification of the peptides by a hexose (Fig. 6). Identification of Amino Acids in RhoD and RhoA That Define the Substrate Specificity of E. coli CNF1 and Bordetella DNT—Comparable with toxin B, CNF1 and DNT modify RhoA but not RhoD (Fig. 7). However, CNF1 and DNT possess deamidation and transglutamination activity, and both toxins are unrelated to the glucosylating toxins with respect to enzyme activity and amino acid sequences (21Schmidt G. Sehr P. Wilm M. Selzer J. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1997; 387: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 22Flatau G. Lemichez E. Gauthier M. Chardin P. Paris S. Fiorentini C. Boquet P. Nature. 1997; 387: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Here, we studied the transglutamination reaction for both CNF1 and DNT. The acceptor amino acid for transglutamination and deamidation of RhoA is glutamine 63 (21Schmidt G. Sehr P. Wilm M. Selzer J. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1997; 387: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 22Flatau G. Lemichez E. Gauthier M. Chardin P. Paris S. Fiorentini C. Boquet P. Nature. 1997; 387: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). This amino acid residue is also located within the switch II region. Lerm et al. (31Lerm M. Schmidt G. Goehring U.-M. Schirmer J. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28999-29004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) showed that a peptide covering amino acids 59-78 of RhoA is sufficient to be accepted as a substrate for CNF1. Apparently, DNT needs additional structural requirements to recognize its protein substrates (31Lerm M. Schmidt G. Goehring U.-M. Schirmer J. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28999-29004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The alignment in Fig. 4 shows that within the CNF recognition peptide of amino acids 59-78 of RhoA, the amino acids glutamate 64, serine 73, threonine 77, and aspartate 78 differ in RhoD. Based on the report that even a peptide including amino acids 59-69 of RhoA can be modified by CNF1 (32Flatau G. Landraud L. Boquet P. Bruzzone M. Munro P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 588-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we examined whether change of glutamate 64 of RhoA by aspartate (RhoA E64D) affected transamidation of RhoA by CNF1. As shown in Fig. 7, A and C, RhoA E64D was no longer modified by CNF1. The same was true for DNT (Fig. 7B). As shown in the alignment of Fig. 4, an aspartate residue (aspartate 76) is located at the equivalent position in RhoD. When aspartate 76 of RhoD was changed to glutamate, the mutant RhoD D76E was modified by CNF1 (Fig. 7, A and C) as well as by DNT (Fig. 7B). These results demonstrated that a single amino acid exchange was sufficient to allow recognition of RhoD as a protein substrate for CNF1 and DNT or, in the case of RhoA, prevented the modification by the transglutaminating toxins. However, the amino acids that were identified to be crucial for modification by CNF and DNT were not identical with those residues recognized to be essential for modification of the GTPases by toxin B and lethal toxin (RhoD F85/RhoA S73, see Fig. 7, A and B). In this study we investigated the structural basis for the different substrate properties of RhoA and RhoD for glucosylation by C. difficile toxin B and C. sordellii lethal toxin. Furthermore, we studied why RhoA, but not RhoD, is a substrate for E. coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor CNF1 and Bordetella dermonecrotic toxin DNT. Using chimeras of RhoA and RhoD, we narrowed down the region that determined recognition by toxin B and lethal toxin to amino acids 59-79 in RhoA and amino acids 71-91 in RhoD, respectively. Single amino acid exchanges in RhoA and RhoD within this region showed that serine 73 in RhoA and phenylalanine 85 in RhoD were responsible for the different properties of these GTPases to serve as substrates for toxin B and lethal toxin. Change of serine 73 in RhoA to the aromatic phenylalanine allowed recognition and modification by lethal toxin, whereas modification by toxin B was blocked. Vice versa, when phenylalanine was introduced at the equivalent position of RhoD, the GTPase was modified by toxin B. Mass analysis identified attachment of a hexose in RhoD catalyzed by toxin B, and kinetic data indicated that in fact the rates of glucosylation were changed by the amino acid changes made. The amino acids serine 73 of RhoA and phenylalanine 85 of RhoD are located on the edge of the α2 helix within the switch II region of the GTPases. As shown in the crystal structure of RhoA-GDP, serine 73 is surface located in close vicinity to the acceptor threonine 37 (threonine 49 of RhoD) (see Fig. 4B). Therefore, it is likely that this region is involved in the interaction with the glycosylating toxins. It is reasonable to assume that the polar serine 73 in RhoA supports dipolar interactions with toxin B. Correspondingly, the hydrophobic amino acid phenylalanine 85 of RhoD hinders binding to toxin B but facilitates lethal toxin to bind. Toxin B seems to require a polar environment in this particular region, whereas for lethal toxin a hydrophobic aromatic amino acid does not interfere with interaction of RhoD. A further explanation, besides different surface charges, could be the size of the different amino acids, either enabling a specific interaction or preventing it by sterical hindrance. However, it cannot be excluded that these amino acids are not directly involved in enzyme substrate binding but rather induce allosteric changes in the GTPases that are prerequisites for proper interaction of the GTPases with toxin B and lethal toxin, respectively. Recently, Heo and Meyer (33Heo W.D. Meyer T. Cell. 2003; 113: 315-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) studied the structural basis for changes in the functions of various related members of the Ras superfamily. They analyzed amino acid residues in Rac and Cdc42 that define the typical morphological changes, e.g. lamellipodia and filopodia formation induced by Rac and Cdc42, respectively. They found that changes of several amino acids were needed to induce a switch in typical functions of the GTPases. However, exchange of a single amino acid was not sufficient to cause a change of function of any GTPase studied. Moreover, they reported that many of the relevant residues that define gain or loss of functions of GTPases were located outside the classical switch I and switch II regions or distinct from other known interaction sites, suggesting major impact of allosteric effects. Our results on the structural requirements for the substrate properties of RhoA and RhoD to be glucosylated by toxins are different from those obtained in studies with switch-of-function mutants. Only 1 amino acid residue, which was located in the switch II region, defined loss and gain of the property to serve as a substrate for glucosylation by toxin B and lethal toxin, respectively. However, we were not able to extend our findings with RhoA/RhoD on Ras subfamily proteins. In all Ras proteins (H-Ras, R-Ras, K-Ras, RalA, -B, Rap1, -2) the aromatic residue tyrosine 71 is strictly conserved (see also alignment in Fig. 4A). This residue is located at the same site as phenylalanine 85 of RhoD that was important for modification by lethal toxin. Because lethal toxin predominantly modifies Ras protein family members, we also tested whether this tyrosine residue in Ras is crucial for toxin recognition. However, change of the tyrosine residue of H-Ras into serine did not alter the substrate properties toward the toxins (data not shown), e.g. toxin B was still not able to modify Ras proteins. Thus, for Ras recognition by lethal toxin additional conserved amino acids are necessary. Constructing RhoA-Rac1 chimeras, Müller and coworkers (34Müller S. Von Eichel-Streiber C. Moos M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 1073-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) found that amino acids 22-27 in Rac1 were of major impact for recognition by lethal toxin of C. sordellii strain 1522 and toxin B from C. difficile strains 1470 and 8864. Especially, lysine 27 located on helix α1 of RhoA hindered the modification by lethal toxin (see Fig. 4B). In RhoA K27T, the substrate properties were switched. This mutant protein adapted Rac1 properties. Prior to the construction of the above described chimeras, we exchanged several amino acids in helix α1 of RhoA to those of RhoD (RhoA S26D, S26A, S26E, S26H, S26K, K27D, D28G, Q29A, S26A/D28G, S26A/Q29A and RhoA D28G/Q29A) to elucidate the substrate specificity in RhoD, but none of them allowed modification of RhoA by lethal toxin or reduced the modification by toxin B (data not shown). This suggests that helix α1 of RhoD does not contain any structural feature that is decisive for modification by lethal toxin and toxin B. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude that the toxin isoforms that were used in the reported studies behave differently. For CNF1, it was reported that a peptide covering amino acids 59-69 of the switch II region of RhoA was sufficient to be modified by the toxin. We focused on this region to identify crucial amino acid residues that prevent modification of RhoD by CNF and DNT. By site-directed mutagenesis, we were able to show that glutamate 64 of RhoA and aspartate 76 of RhoD define the specificity for CNF1. For DNT it was shown that beyond the switch II region of RhoA other contact regions are necessary (31Lerm M. Schmidt G. Goehring U.-M. Schirmer J. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28999-29004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was even more surprising that the property to serve as substrate for DNT was defined by the same amino acid residue in RhoD as for CNF1. The change of aspartate 76 to glutamate in RhoD causes only a minor change in the side chain length of one methylene group, but this was crucial for the substrate property of RhoD and allowed modification by DNT. Taken together, a striking finding of this study is the fact that the substitution of a single amino acid can change the substrate properties of the GTPases with simultaneous and selective loss and gain of functions, respectively. Thus, single amino acids play a crucial and determining role for the interaction of specific Rho protein family members with diverse bacterial toxins. From crystal structures of Rho proteins in complexes with effectors and regulators and from biochemical studies, it was shown that glutamate 64 (35Buchwald G. Friebel A. Galan J.E. Hardt W.D.

The detailed oxygenation mechanism of 2R,3S,4S-cis-LCD to flav-2-en-3,4-diols was investigated using the density functional theory method. An initial model for the calculation was constructed from a structure obtained by a 100-ps molecular dynamics simulation of Arabidopsis ANS under physiological conditions. This model consisted of an LCD molecule as the substrate together with an iron atom, two histidine residues, an aspartic acid residue, a succinate, and an oxygen atom as ligands of the iron atom. The results of the calculation indicated that both the C-3 and C-4 positions of LCD can be oxidized, although C-4 oxidation is preferable. The C-3 oxidation required several steps to form flavan-3,3,4-triol: 1) formation of FeIII-OH and a substrate C-3 radical via hydrogen atom abstraction by FeIV=O, 2) formation of a C-3 ketone and a water molecule, 3) addition of OH- into the C-3 position of the ketone, and 4) addition of H+ to form flavan-3,3,4-triol. On the other hand, C-4 oxidation of 2R,3S,4S-cis-LCD resulted in the direct formation of 2R,3R-trans-dihydroquercetin. These results suggest that the oxidation at C-3 of LCD, a key reaction for coloring in anthocyanin biosynthesis, can be regarded as a “side reaction” from the viewpoint of quantum mechanics of enzymatic reactions.

Flavonoids 3For clarity in the figures, the A and B rings are not always drawn. are a large class of plant secondary metabolites on which extensive study has been carried out in the areas of chemistry, biochemistry, and genetics. In particular, anthocyanins are well known to be the main pigments in flowers and also play a role in protection against UV photodamage (1Harborne J.B. Williams C.A. Phytochemistry. 2000; 55: 481-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (3186) Google Scholar). The antioxidant activity of anthocyanins allows a variety of medical usages, such as the prevention of cancer, anti-inflammatory activity, anti-arteriosclerosis activity, etc. (2Rice-Evans C.A. Miller N.J. Paganga G. Trends Plant Sci. 1997; 2: 152-159Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (3378) Google Scholar). Comprehensive molecular biological and biochemical studies have already established the general biosynthesis steps that produce anthocyanin in plants, and most of the genes of the biosynthetic enzymes have been cloned and characterized (3Forkmann G.

Rep. 2003; 20: 288-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). In general, the first colored compound in the biosynthetic pathway of anthocyanin is a flavylium ion form of anthocyanidins (e.g. cyanidin 1), which is derived from colorless leucoanthocyanidins (e.g. 2R,3S,4S-cis-leucocyanidin 2 (LCD) 4The abbreviations used are: LCD, leucocyanidin; ANS, anthocyanidin synthase; DHQ, dihydroquercetin; FLS, flavonol synthase; FGT, flavonoid glycosyltransferase; MD, molecular dynamics; DFT, density functional theory; DFR, dihydroflavonol reductase; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethansulfonic acid. ). Anthocyanidin synthase (ANS) is responsible for this step, i.e. dehydrogenation from C-2 and dehydration from C-3 and C-4 formally (Fig. 1A). The cDNA encoding ANS was first isolated from a Zea mays mutant (a2) by transposon tagging (7Menssen A. Höhmann S. Martin W. Schnable P.S. Peterson P.A. Saedler H. Gierl A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3051-3057Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar); however, no biochemical investigation succeeded until the first study using the recombinant ANS enzyme of Perilla frutescens (8Saito K. Kobayashi M. Gong Z.Z. Tanaka Y. Yamazaki M. Plant J. 1999; 17: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Successful in vitro studies using recombinant ANSs of Petunia hybrida, Antirrhinum majus, Z. mays, and Torenia fournieri have also been carried out, confirming that ANS is a member of the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family, which requires Fe2+, 2-oxoglutarate 3, dioxygen, and ascorbate for its oxygenation activity (Fig. 1B) (9Nakajima J. Tanaka Y. Yamazaki M. Saito K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25797-25803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). An important feature of the reaction catalyzed by ANS is that no additional enzyme such as dehydratase is required, despite the involvement of a formal dehydration step. The direct precursor for the flavylium ion form of anthocyanidin is presumed to be 4S-flav-2-en-3,4-diol 4 (Fig. 1A) (9Nakajima J. Tanaka Y. Yamazaki M. Saito K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25797-25803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). A recent in vitro study on ANS revealed that ANS is capable of catalyzing the oxygenation of 2R,3R-trans-dihydroquercetin (DHQ) 5 toward quercetin 6; this reaction is also catalyzed by flavonol synthase (FLS), another member of the 2-oxoglutaratedependent dioxygenase family (10Turnbull J.J.

Surprisingly, in previous studies, most of the products obtained by Arabidopsis ANS from 2R,3S,4S-cis-LCD 2 were not the expected product cyanidin 1 but rather quercetin 6 and cis-7/trans-5 DHQ (10Turnbull J.J.

Recent in vitro work using 18O stable isotope implied a possible detailed reaction mechanism of ANS, specifically, that the C-3 α-face of 2R,3S,4S-cis-LCD 2 might be hydroxylated to form 2R,4S-flavan-3,3,4-triol 10 (3,3-gem-diol) and is likely to be equilibrated with 2R,4S-flav-3-on-4-ol 11 (3-ketone) during enzyme binding (17Turnbull J.J.

Dehydration from C-2 and C-3 or from C-3 and C-4 of the 3,3-gem-diol 10 or tautomerization of 3-ketone 11 leads to the formation of 4S-flav-2-en-3,4-diol 4 or flav-3-en-3,4-diol 12, respectively (10Turnbull J.J.

In vivo, it has been postulated that 4S-flav-2-en-3,4-diol 4 formed from natural type LCD 2 is glycosylated by flavonoid glycosyltransferase (FGT) then transported into acidic vacuoles where it undergoes spontaneous dehydroxylation to produce a flavylium ion form of cyanidin glycoside (e.g. cyanidin 3-O-glucoside 13) (9Nakajima J.

In a step common to all 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, ANS first binds with ferrous ion as a catalytic center and composes a complex with 2-oxoglutarate 3 and dioxygen. Oxidative decarboxylation of 2-oxoglutarate 3 then occurs, producing succinate 14,CO2, and a ferryl intermediate (FeIV=O ↔FeIII-O·) which is subsequently utilized in the oxygenation of the substrate (Fig. 1B) (18Schofield C.J.

Experimental crystal structures of Arabidopsis ANS have already been obtained with an analogous substrate and a product for ANS, DHQ 5 and quercetin 6 (22Wilmouth R.C. Turnbull J.J. Welford R.W.D. Clifton I.J. Prescott A.G. Schofield C.J. Structure. 2002; 10: 93-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The structures were obtained as complexes not only with a substrate/product but also contain FeII and succinate. Based on this structural analysis, the positions of the critical amino acid residues, a succinate molecule 14 and a substrate involved in the active site, have been proposed (22Wilmouth R.C. Turnbull J.J. Welford R.W.D. Clifton I.J. Prescott A.G. Schofield C.J. Structure. 2002; 10: 93-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar); however, to the best of our knowledge, no insights on reaction dynamics have yet been published. In the present study, we performed a molecular dynamics simulation to obtain the probable structure of Arabidopsis ANS with 2R,3S,4S-LCD 2 as a substrate using the crystal structure and constructing a model of the active site for quantum mechanics calculation. The calculations address the first reaction step, i.e. the step from the oxygenation of LCD 2 to the formation of 3,3-gem-diol 10 (Fig. 1C). The present simulation suggests that oxygenation at both the C-3 and C-4 positions of 2R,3S,4S-LCD 2 is possible, although C-4 oxidation seems to occur more easily to form 2R,3R-trans-DHQ 5 directly, while C-3 oxidation requires several reaction steps to form 2R,4S-3,3-gem-diol 10. The detailed reaction mechanisms are discussed below in the context of an evolutionary consequence of ANS and related proteins. Molecular Dynamics Simulation—A molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was performed to determine the appropriate structure of the ferryl (Fe(IV)=O/Fe(III)—O·) species in the enzyme. The three-dimensional crystal structure of ANS-Fe(II)-succinate-quercetin complex (post-reaction) from Arabidopsis thaliana registered in the Protein Data Bank with Protein Data Bank code “1gp6” (22Wilmouth R.C.

Structure. 2002; 10: 93-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) was used as a template of the initial structure for our investigation. A model with an ANS-ferryl (Fe(IV)=O/Fe(III)-O·)-succinate-LCD complex for MD simulation was constructed as follows. The oxygen atom of the water molecule attached to the iron atom at the proximal position was substituted for the oxygen atom of the ferryl. Next, two LCDs 2 were placed at the positions where the oxygenated product (quercetin 6) and the second substrate (enantiomer of DHQ 5) were located in the original crystal structure. The position occupied by a MES molecule was substituted with an ascorbate using the modeling software INSIGHT II (Accelrys, Inc., San Diego, CA). Finally, a rectangular water box (TIP3P model (23Jorgensen D.A. Chandrasekhar J. Madura J.D. J. Chem. Phys. 1983; 79: 926-935Crossref Scopus (30147) Google Scholar)) was generated with a width of 7 Å from ANS by the LEaP module of the AMBER 7.0 program package (24Case D.A. Pearlman D.A.

As a result, the ANS protein was solvated with 350 crystal water molecules and 7,507 additional water molecules. The MD simulation was carried out using the AMBER 7.0 program package together with the Amber parm99 force field (26Wang J. Cieplak P. Kollman P.A. J. Comput.

Partial charges for the four residues coordinating to the iron atom of ferryl (Fe(IV)=O/Fe(III)-O·) were calculated using the quantum chemical calculation by GAUSSIAN 98 (Gaussian, Inc., Carnegie, PA) (27Frisch M.J.

The system was minimized for 4,000 steps prior to the MD simulation. The MD simulation was performed starting from the energy-minimized structure (shown in Fig. 2A). The temperature was elevated from 0 to 310 K during the first 60 ps of simulation, and then the temperature and pressure were kept at 310 K and 1 atm, respectively. The integration time step of the simulation was chosen to be 1 fs, and a cutoff distance of 10 Å for non-bonded interactions and a dielectric constant of ϵ = 1 were employed. A periodic boundary condition was applied, and the particle mesh Ewald method (31Darden T. York D. Pedersen L. J. Chem. Phys. 1993; 98: 10089-10092Crossref Scopus (21030) Google Scholar) was used for the estimation of long range electrostatic interactions. The system was equilibrated for 100 ps, and the average structure of the last 5 ps of the trajectory was saved as the protein structure in the physical condition (Fig. 2B). This average structure was used as a template for the following ab initio quantum chemical calculations. Analyses of Reaction Mechanisms by Quantum Chemical Calculations—By theoretical approaches using quantum chemical calculation, we can obtain a variety of information such as structures of intermediates, potential energy surfaces, and a distribution of electron density. For example, we can reveal the activation energy and the direction of the reaction by estimating the potential energy surface. Especially, it is difficult to experimentally reveal the unstable transition state structures or the intermediates in a rapid reaction. Quantum chemical calculations can predict these structures and provide additional information about the reaction. This is a fine advantage of this theoretical approach. In this study, the reaction mechanisms of the oxygenation of LCD 2 by ANS have been investigated in detail using this approach. We used the complex structure of LCD 2 and ANS obtained by the MD simulation as a starting structure. Obviously, the oxygenation of LCD 2, which is expected to be initiated with the abstraction of a hydrogen from C-3 or C-4, requires a multistep reaction. Thus, we have analyzed oxygenation at each site separately in a stepwise manner. In each reaction, we calculated the optimized structures both at the initial and the final states and further estimated the potential energy surface along each reaction. We used the density functional theory (DFT) as a method for quantum chemical calculations. DFT is an extremely successful approach for the description of ground state properties of metals, semiconductors, and insulators. The success of DFT not only encompasses standard bulk materials but also complex materials such as proteins and carbon nanotubes, recently. DFT methodology has been proved to be adequate for the calculation of a large variety of molecular properties (32Foresman J.B. Frisch E.

Chem. 2005; 56: 389-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) including oxygenation (36Borowski T. Georgiev V. Siegbahn P.E.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 17303-17314Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 37Hata M. Hirano Y. Hoshino T. Tsuda M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 6410-6416Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It is difficult to treat all atoms of the large protein with the ab initio quantum chemical calculation due to limitations of computational resources and time. For this reason, we constructed a truncated cluster model by extracting LCD 2, Fe(IV)=O, His232, Asp234, His288, and succinate 10, which are considered to participate directly in the oxygenation process, from the average structure obtained by MD simulation. To construct the computational models, we replaced the backbone atoms of His232, Asp234, and His288 with hydrogen atoms, and the C-H bond distances were adjusted to a typical C-H bond length, 1.11 Å. Hence, in the present model, the Asp residue was replaced by CH3-COO-, and His residues were replaced by C3H3N2-CH3. The total number of atoms was 81. The constructed models are shown in Figs. 3,4,5,6. Most of the three-dimensional structures of intermediates in ANS oxygenation process have not been yet determined by crystallographic or NMR experiments. Because the accuracy of reaction paths, potential surfaces, and structures obtained by quantum chemical calculations highly depends on the model system and the calculation method, it is very important to check the validity of the computations from the viewpoint of consistency with available experimental findings.FIGURE 4Structures and potential surface at the ketone formation step.

The DFT B3LYP functional is a hybrid functional constructed by combining Becke's threeparameter exchange functional (38Becke A.D. J. Chem. Phys. 1993; 98: 5648-5652Crossref Scopus (89864) Google Scholar) and Lee-Yang-Parr's correlation functional (39Lee C. Yang W. Parr R.G. Phys. Rev. B. 1988; 37: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (87033) Google Scholar). Geometry optimizations were executed with a 3-21G** basis set. During geometry optimization, atoms were allowed to move freely except for the CH3 groups of three amino acid residues and the C-ring of the substrate, which are labeled with asterisks in Fig. 3A. These atoms were fixed at the position in the structure obtained by MD simulation during the optimization on each stationary point structure. Thus, the rigidity of the protein backbone and the sustainability of the substrate were taken into account in the model. Potential energy profiles were obtained by changing the distances shown on the horizontal axes in Figs. 3,4,5,6 in a stepwise manner. For example, the potential energy profile for the oxygenation initiating reaction, which is the abstraction of the hydrogen atom bound to the C-3 carbon atom by the ferryl oxygen (Fig. 3), was obtained by the following procedure. First, all structures of the reactant (Fig. 3A) and the product (Fig. 3B) were optimized. The distance between the abstracted hydrogen atom and the ferryl oxygen atom was gradually shortened, and the potential energies at the respective distance were calculated by the geometry optimization fixing the distance between the hydrogen atom and the ferryl oxygen atom. We repeated this process until the structure reached the product. Then, we plotted the energy changes as a function of distance. This energy profile will represent the potential energy surface along the hydrogen abstraction reaction. Using this procedure, we obtained a total of seven potential energy profiles for the oxygenation processes at the C-3 and C-4 positions of the substrate, which are shown in Figs. 3,4,5,6 and summarized in Fig. 7. Our calculations showed that the potential energy of the quintet state structure was lower than that of the triplet state structure. Hence, the calculations in the present study were performed in the quintet state. The total atomic charge was-1e. Dynamic Structures of the Ferryl Species—Molecular mechanics simulation afforded the initial structure for the molecular dynamics simulation of ANS with the natural substrate 2R,3S,4S-LCD 2, iron and dioxygen, as shown in Fig. 2A. There are two LCDs binding in the active site, although the second one may not be directly involved in any reaction. The first substrate is linked to Glu306 by a hydrogen bond. The carboxyl oxygen atoms of succinate 14 lie in the anion hole formed by the side chains of four amino acid residues, Asn215, Tyr217, Arg298, and Ser300. The distance between the C-4 carbon (C4) atom of the first LCD 2 and Fe (3.81 Å) was shorter than that between the C-3 carbon (C3) and iron (4.61 Å). The structure of an active site obtained by 100-ps MD simulation at 310 K is shown in Fig. 2B. The distances between iron and C4 or C3 had changed to 3.09 and 3.32 Å, respectively. Initiation of Oxidation by ANS—The model structure for the quantum chemical calculation was constructed from the structure shown in Fig. 2B by the procedure described under “Materials and Methods.” The oxygen atom of ferryl species (Fe(IV)=O/Fe(III)-O·) (O1), a center of oxygenation, interacted with the hydrogen atom at the C-3 position of LCD 2 (H3) with a distance of 3.93 Å and with the hydrogen atom at the C-4 position (H4) with a distance of 3.05 Å (Fig. 3A, structure a). Our results suggested that the O1 is ready for oxygenation at both the C-3 and C-4 positions of LCD 2, although the C-4 reaction is apparently more probable based on the observed distances. The spin density distribution of the optimized structure is shown in Table 1. O1 atom was found to have the character of a free radical. Since it is well known that a free radical abstracts a hydrogen atom from hydrocarbons (40Tomoda Y. Tsuda M. Nature. 1961; 190: 905Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 46Tomoda Y. Tsuda M. J. Polym. Sci. 1961; 54: 321-328Crossref Google Scholar), it is plausible that the mechanism of oxygenation by ferryl species is initiated by hydrogen atom abstraction from the substrate interacting with the O1. As the distance between O1 and H3 or H4 atoms decreased, the potential energy of the reaction model increased (Fig. 3B), and a transition state structure appeared at the distance of 1.2 Å. Passing the transition state, the fifth ligand (O1) became an OH group, and the spin density was localized at the substrate radical in both H3 and H4 abstraction reactions (Fig. 3A, structures b and b′ and Table 1). Although the distance of the O1 atom was closer to the C-4 position than to C-3, the activation energies for the H4 and H3 abstraction reactions were similar, at ∼31 and 32 kcal/mol, respectively (Fig. 3B). The energy of the C-3 radical structure (Fig. 3A, structure b) was ∼11 kcal/mol higher than that of the C-4 radical structure (Fig. 3A, structure b′), indicating that proton abstraction could occur advantageously at the C-4 position of LCD 2.TABLE 1Spin density distributions following hydrogen atom abstraction by ferryl speciesGroup of atomsStructureabb′Iron4.14.24.3O10.250.090.07H3 (H4)(0.01)(0.00)(0.00)Substrate0.02−0.99−0.99Succinate−0.480.450.41Rest0.150.200.22 Open table in a new tab Production of the 3-Ketone and Succinate Conformational Change in the C-3 Reaction—The C3 atom of the substrate forms a covalent bond with the oxygen atom (O1) at the proximal position to produce an oxygenated product from the structure obtained by hydrogen atom abstraction.

Real time PCR and immunoblotting indicated that in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, IBMX-stimulated induction of Pde3b mRNA and protein was markedly inhibited by dominant-negative CREB proteins. By transfecting preadipocytes, differentiating preadipocytes, and HEK293A cells with luciferase reporter vectors containing different fragments of the 5′-flanking region of the Pde3b gene, we identified a distal promoter that contained canonical cis-acting cAMP-response elements (CRE) and a proximal, GC-rich promoter region, which contained atypical CRE. Mutation of the CRE sequences dramatically reduced distal promoter activity; H89 inhibited IBMX-stimulated CREB phosphorylation and proximal and distal promoter activities. Distal promoter activity was stimulated by IBMX and phorbol ester (PMA) in Raw264.7 monocytes, but only by IBMX in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses with specific antibodies against CREB, phospho-CREB, and CBP/p300 (CREB-binding protein) showed that these proteins associated with both distal and proximal promoters and that interaction of phospho-CREB, the active form of CREB, with both Pde3b promoter regions was increased in IBMX-treated preadipocytes.

Multiple PDEs are found in most cells but in different amounts, proportions, and subcellular locations; little is known of the mechanisms that regulate their differential expression. PDE3 isozymes can be distinguished from other PDE families by their high affinities for cAMP and cGMP, and by their sensitivity to specific inhibitors such as milrinone and cilostamide (1Francis S.H.

On the other hand, in mature or differentiated adipocytes, cAMP stimulates lipolysis via PKA-catalyzed phosphorylation of perilipin and phosphorylation/activation of hormone-sensitive triglyceride lipase (16Londos C.

In differentiated adipocytes, insulin-induced phosphorylation and activation of membrane-associated PDE3B, most likely via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and protein kinase B, is an important component of the antilipolytic action of insulin (2Degerman E. Rahn-Landstrom T. Holst L.S. Goransson O. Harndahl L. Ahmad F. Choi Y. Masciarelli S. Liu H. Manganiello V.C. LeRoith D. Taylor S.I. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes Mellitus: A Fundamental and Clinical Text.

Previous studies from our laboratories indicated that RO 20-1724 (a specific inhibitor of PDE4 isozymes), but not cilostamide (a specific PDE3 inhibitor), could replace IBMX (a non-selective PDE inhibitor) during differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes induced by IBMX, dexamethasone, and insulin (20Elks M.L. Manganiello V.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1985; 124: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We and others (21Eriksson H. Ridderstrale M. Degerman E. Ekholm D. Smith C.J. Manganiello V.C.

Taken together, these observations suggest that PDE4 isoforms may regulate cAMP pools involved in initiation of differentiation, whereas PDE3 isoforms may regulate cAMP pools that control lipolysis in differentiated adipocytes. Experiments with PDE3 inhibitors have also indicated an important role for PDE3 in regulation of insulin secretion in pancreatic islets (9Harndahl L. Jing X.J. Ivarsson R. Degerman E. Ahren B.

Because the detailed molecular mechanisms that govern adipocyte Pde3b expression during adipogenesis are not known, and because terminal differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes provides a well characterized model for the study of gene expression and regulation (26Otto T.C. Lane M.D. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 40: 229-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 27Rosen E.D. Hsu C.H. Wang X. Sakai S. Freeman M.W. Gonzalez F.J. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar), we initiated studies of mechanisms underlying transcriptional control of Pde3b expression in these cells. We isolated the 5′-flanking region of the murine Pde3b gene, which included the putative first exon and an ∼5-kb genomic fragment upstream of the translation start site, and which contained distal and proximal promoter regions and transcription initiation sites in the proximal promoter region (∼0.5 kb upstream of the translation start site), close to those described by Niiya et al. (28Niiya T. Osawa H. Onuma H. Suzuki Y. Taira M. Yamada K. Makino H. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In addition, our results suggest that cis-acting CRE (cAMP-response) elements in both promoter regions and activation of CREB (CRE-binding proteins) are important in the regulation of induction of Pde3b by cAMP during differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Tissue culture reagents (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal bovine serum, and penicillin/streptomycin), GeneRacer™ kit, and TOPO TA Cloning® kit were from Invitrogen; [3H]cAMP was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences; rolipram, cilostamide, bisindolylmaleimide I, and anti-CREB antibodies were from Calbiochem; isobutylmethylxanthine, dexamethasone, and insulin were from Sigma; Affi-Gel 601 was from Bio-Rad; the BCA protein assay kit and bovine serum albumin were from Pierce. Enzymes for DNA manipulation were purchased from Roche Applied Science; [α-32P]dATP or [γ-32P]ATP was from Amersham Biosciences. Vectors (basic-pGL3, SV40 promoter-pGL3, and SV40 promoter/enhancer-pGL3 which contained the firefly luciferase gene, and TK-pRL which contained the thymidine kinase (TK) promoter and the Renilla luciferase gene), TRANSFAST™ reagent, the Dual Luciferase™ reporter assay system, and gel shift binding buffer were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). SMART™ RACE cDNA amplification kits, AdvanTAge™ PCR cloning kits, Advantage®-GC cDNA PCR kits, and Adeno-X kits were purchased from Clontech. Poly(A)+ Pure™ mRNA isolation kits were from Ambion (Austin, TX); plasmid DNA purification kits and QuantiTECT CYBR GREEN kits were from Qiagen (Studio City, CA); QuickChange multisite-directed mutagenesis kits were from Stratagene (Cedar Creek, TX); BigDye® Terminator version 3.1 cycle sequencing kit was from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA); mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, HEK293A cells, and RAW264.7 cells were from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and HEK293A cells were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a 95% air, 5% CO2-humidified atmosphere. RAW264.7 cells were cultured under the same conditions but in RPMI1640 medium. Preadipocytes were incubated for 5 days, or as otherwise indicated, in fresh media supplemented with isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX, 300 μm), dexamethasone (Dex, 1 μm), and insulin (5 μg/ml), alone or in combination. Cells were harvested, homogenized on ice with buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 5 mm benzamidine, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin and centrifuged (1,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). Supernatant protein content was determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce), with bovine serum albumin as standard. Portions of the supernatant fractions were assayed (30 min, 30 °C) in 100 μl containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 1 μm [3H]cAMP (50,000 dpm). Assays were terminated with 50 μl of 0.5 m EDTA (pH 7.4). PDE3 activity was determined as that portion of total cAMP hydrolysis inhibited by cilostamide (a PDE3-selective inhibitor, 1 μm). After diluting samples with 0.3 ml of buffer (0.1 m NaCl, 0.1 m HEPES (pH 8.5)), the reaction product, 5′-[3H]AMP, was purified by polyacrylamide-boronate gel chromatography (Affi-Gel 601, 1-ml bed volume) and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Samples were mixed with 2× Laemmli buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 50% glycerol, and 4% SDS), heated (95 °C, 5 min), and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Membranes were incubated (1 h) with blocking buffer (TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20)) containing 5% powdered nonfat milk (NFDM) and then (1-2 h) with appropriate antibodies, washed, and incubated (1 h) with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or mouse IgG. Immunoreactivity was detected by chemiluminescence. Recombinant mouse PDE3B was used to determine the specificity of the antiserum and for comparison of molecular masses. A stock solution of Oil Red O (5 mg/ml in isopropyl alcohol) was diluted to 3 mg/ml with distilled water, incubated (1 h, room temperature), and filtered (0.2-μm filter) prior to use (29Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1975; 5: 19-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed with 10 ml of Accustain formalin solution (Sigma) in PBS (1 h, 4 °C) and stained with 10 ml of Oil Red O solution per dish (15 min, room temperature). Accumulation of neutral lipid (red color) was assessed using an Olympus IX51 microscope with a digital camera. Recombinant adeno-CREB expression vectors, kindly supplied by J. Reusch and D. Klemm (Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Denver, CO), were constructed with replication-deficient adenovirus under control of the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter that regulates the ectopic expression of cDNA encoding β-galactosidase, inactive MCREB or KCREB, or constitutively active VP16-CREB or DCREB. Adenovirus constructs were amplified in HEK293A cells and purified with Adeno-X kits (Clontech). Adenovirus particles were quantitated by measuring absorbance at A260 nm, and infection efficiency was determined by immunostaining with anti-adenovirus hexon protein or anti-β-galactosidase antibody. At ∼80% confluence, preadipocytes were infected for 3 h with adenovirus constructs (500 virus particles per cell) in DMEM containing 1 μg/ml polylysine. Cells were cultured in DMEM containing 2.5% FBS for 2 days, and after that, infected cells were incubated with or without 300 μm IBMX for additional 5 days in DMEM containing 10% FBS. Expression of Pde3b mRNA and protein was assessed by real time RT-PCR, immunoblotting, and PDE3 activity assays. RNA was isolated from 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and differentiated adipocytes using poly(A) Pure™ mRNA isolation kits (Ambion). After centrifugation (12,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C) of cell extracts, supernatants were added to oligo(dT)-cellulose and incubated (1 h, room temperature with shaking). After washing the matrix, mRNA was eluted (100 μl of elution buffer, 10 min, 65-70 °C), pelleted with glycogen (12,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C), and dissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. Real time RT-PCR was performed using Qiagen Quanti-TECT SYBR GREEN kit. Primers for amplification of mouse Pde3b, β-actin, or cyclophilin A in cultured 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were Pde3b-3295 (5′-GGTGATGGTGGTGAAGAA-3′) and Pde3b-3414 (5′-AGTGAGGTGGTGCATTAG-3′), actin-949 (5′-ATTACTGCTCTGGCTCCTA-3′) and actin-1063 (5′-TCTGCTGGAAGGTGGACA-3′), and CypA-275 (5′-ATGTGGTCTTTGGGAAGG-3′) and CypA-370 (5′-TGGTGATCTTCTTGCTGGT-3′), respectively. The relative abundance of the assayed gene (Pde3b) was calculated on the basis of Ct (threshold cycle) value (2-ΔΔCt), ΔΔCt = the normalized signal level in a sample relative to the normalized signal level in the corresponding calibrator sample. Poly(A)-mRNA was isolated from IBMX-treated 3T3-L1 preadipocytes using the Qiagen RNeasy mini kit and Oligotex mRNA mini kit. After first strand synthesis, cDNA was amplified by PCR using a GeneRacer 5′-primer and a gene-specific primer (5′-CAGCGGGCTCACGCAGCTCTTCACGTA-3′, reverse-complement 100-126 bp downstream of ATG start codon). Nested PCR was performed on purified PCR products (Qiagen PCR purification kit), using a GeneRacer 5′-nested primer and a nested, gene-specific primer (5′-AGCTCTTCACGTAGCCGTTGCGCA-3′, reverse-complement 89-112 bp downstream of ATG start codon). After TOPO TA cloning of PCR products, positive clones were identified by PCR and sequenced. Cells were cotransfected with pRL-TK and pGL3 reporter plasmid vectors that expressed Renilla and firefly luciferase activities, respectively. For the different pGL3 reporter plasmids, firefly luciferase expression was driven either by Pde3b 5′-flanking region genomic fragments or constructs (Pde3b-pGL3), by the SV40 promoter (SV40 (pro)-pGL3) or the SV40 enhancer and promoter (SV40 (con)-pGL3) as positive controls, or by promoter-free pGL3 (Basic-pGL3) as a negative control. Transfection was performed using TransFAST™ reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). On the day before transfection, 400 μl of nuclease-free water was added to the TransFAST™ reagent, and the lipid film was dispersed by vigorous vortexing for 10 s. After 24 h, a mixture of plasmid DNA, TransFAST™ reagent (3 μl), and serum-free growth medium (1 ml) was prepared, incubated (10-15 min, room temperature), and used to transfect cells, after removal of growth medium from the cells. Each DNA sample contained the pRL-TK plasmid vector (0.02 μg) and a pGL3 plasmid vector (1.0 μg). 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were cotransfected in 6-well culture dishes at 60-80% confluence, incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, and then overlaid with prewarmed DMEM containing 10% FBS (2 ml) and maintained for 48 h at 37 °C. For transfection of differentiating 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, preadipocytes were grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS to about 80% confluence (day 0), when differentiation was induced by addition of fresh DMEM containing 10% FBS and MDI (where MDI is IBMX, Dex, and insulin in differentiating preadipocytes). Three days later (day 3), differentiating 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were cotransfected by the procedure described above but were then overlaid with 2 ml of prewarmed DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1 μg/ml insulin and maintained for 48 h at 37 °C. After 48 h at 37 °C, the cotransfected cells were then washed three times with PBS, disrupted in 250 μl of Passive Lysis Buffer (PLB, Promega), and centrifuged (1,000 × g, 5 min). Supernatant firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured with the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) using a luminometer (Lumat LB 9501). Luciferase reagent substrate (100 μl) was mixed with cell lysates (20 μl), and firefly luciferase activity was measured (10 s, twice). To terminate this reaction and initiate the Renilla luciferase reaction, Stop & GloR Solution (100 μl) was added to the mixture for 20 s, and Renilla luciferase activity was measured (10 s, twice). The firefly luciferase activity in lysates from cells transfected with Pde3b-pGL3 reporter constructs, and positive and negative controls, was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity values, and the ratio between firefly and Renilla luciferase activities was referred to as relative luciferase activity (RLA). RLA (mean ± S.D., n = 3) was assayed (in duplicate) in lysates from triplicate transfections as described above. Unless otherwise noted, experiments presented in the various figures are from single experiments, which were replicated once or twice. For comparison of transcriptional activities in different cell types, HEK293A, 3T3-L1, and RAW264.7 cells were transfected with pGL3 plasmid DNAs containing various lengths of 5′-flanking regions of the Pde3b gene. After transfection, the cells were treated with IBMX (300 μm) for 3 days or PMA (50 nm) for 24 h and assayed for luciferase activities. In general, Pde3b reporter plasmids were generated by insertion of Pde3b genomic fragments and constructs into pGL3-Basic vectors. Distal Region (-5.1 to -3.4 kb Upstream of ATG)—The ∼1.7-kb distal SalI/XbaI fragment from the 5′-flanking region of the Pde3b gene (-5.1 to -3.4 kb upstream of ATG) (Figs. 3A and 4) was ligated into SalI/XbaI sites of pBluescript, which were located between the KpnI and NheI restriction sites of pBluescript. The SalI/XbaI fragment (∼1.7 kb) was then excised from pBluescript by cleavage with KpnI/NheI and ligated into pGL3-Basic digested with KpnI/NheI, yielding SX-pGL3 (Figs. 4 and 5A). Direct ligation of the SalI/XbaI fragment into pGL3-Basic digested with NheI/XhoI yielded SX*-pGL3, with the genomic fragment in the reverse orientation (Fig. 5A). The SalI/XbaI fragment in pBluescript was cleaved with KpnI/HindIII, KpnI/EcoRI, or KpnI/BamHI, and the fragments were ligated into pGL3-Basic vector at appropriate restriction sites to yield SH-pGL3 (350 bp), SE-pGL3 (∼1.1 kb), and SB-pGL3 (∼1.2 kb), respectively (Figs. 4 and 5A). The size and orientation of all constructs were verified by digestion with KpnI/BglII or KpnI/HindIII.FIGURE 3Analysis of promoter regions in the 5′-flanking region of the murine Pde3b gene.

Cybr protein associates with members of the cytohesin family, which are known ADP-ribosylation factors-GDP/GTP exchange factors, and its functions appear to regulate lymphocyte adhesion and cell-cell contact. Here we show that Cybr mRNA and protein levels are increased upon T cell receptor engagement. Cybr expression then influences T cell receptor-dependent signaling events, such as nuclear factor of activated T cells and AP-1 transcriptional activity. In addition, expression of Cybr results in increased T cell receptor-mediated activation of the Rho/Rac exchange factor Vav and of the JNK-p38 MAPK signaling pathway. The effects of Cybr on nuclear factor of activated T cells and AP-1 are dependent on MAPK activation, and enhanced activation of this cascade results in cooperation between the two transcription factors in the regulation of gene expression. These findings provide the first evidence that the adaptor protein Cybr not only regulates lymphocyte adhesion and cell-cell interaction but also contributes to the regulation of the signaling cascade and of the genetic program downstream of the T cell receptor.

Cohen B. Lancet. 2001; 357: 1777-1789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 2.Huang Y. Wange R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28827-28830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Activation of protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) is an important downstream event after TCR engagement. Upon antigen ligation, Src family kinases, such as Lck and Fyn, initiate the phosphorylation of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs of the CD3 chains, which then serve as the docking sites for the engagement of the PTK Syk family member ZAP-70 (70-kDa ζ-associated protein) (3.Williams B.L. Schreiber K.L. Zhang W. Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. Leibson P.J. Abraham R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1388-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). ZAP-70 in turn phosphorylates the adaptor proteins LAT and SLP-76, which recruit a complex set of proteins, including Grb2, SOS, GADs, PLC-γ1, Vav, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and Itk (4.Koretzky G.A. Myung P.S. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 1: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In particular, phospholipase-Cγ1 (PLC-γ1) is activated by tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequently hydrolyzes inositol phospholipids into inositol trisphosphates and diacylglycerol (4.Koretzky G.A. Myung P.S. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 1: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 5.Winslow M.M. Neilson J.R. Crabtree G.R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This step increases protein kinase C activity (via diacylglycerol) and intracellular calcium concentration (via inositol trisphosphate) (2.Huang Y. Wange R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28827-28830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The LAT·SLP76 complex regulates PLC-γ1 activation through another pivotal PTK, the Tec family tyrosine kinase Itk (6.Dombroski D. Houghtling R.A. Labno C.M. Precht P. Takesono A. Caplen N.J. Billadeau D.D. Wange R.L. Burkhardt J.K. Schwartzberg P.L. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 1385-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). These series of events ultimately lead to the activation of the transcription factor NFAT and the AP-1 complex. NFAT activation seems to also require the tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the small GTPases Rac, Rho, and Cdc42. In fact, T cells lacking Vav show impaired activation of NFAT, antigen-induced cell proliferation, and cytokine production (7.Moores S.L. Selfors L.M. Fredericks J. Breit T. Fujikawa K. Alt F.W. Brugge J.S. Swat W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6364-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 8.Katzav S. Blood. 2004; 103: 2443-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). NFAT-mediated gene expression in T cells has been shown to be dependent not only on the calcium signaling pathway, but also on the cooperative recruitment of Fos and Jun, and the generation of an NFAT·AP-1 complex (9.Rooney J.W. Sun Y.L. Glimcher L.H. Hoey T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6299-6310Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 10.Sun L.J. Peterson B.R. Verdine G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4919-4924Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The activation by TCR of the MAPK cascade can influence these events not only by regulating the synthesis of Fos and Jun, but also controlling their transcriptional potential (11.Kaminska B. Pyrzynska B. Ciechomska I. Wisniewska M. Acta Neurobiol. Exp. (Wars.). 2000; 60: 395-402PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of the MAPK pathway results in phosphorylation of c-Jun and Fos to generate an active AP-1 complex (12.Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5019) Google Scholar, 13.Macian F. Garcia-Rodriguez C. Rao A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4783-4795Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 14.Macian F. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 472-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar). Moreover, Vav-mediated Rac-1 activation has also been suggested to link the TCR-induced activation of JNK and p38 (15.Teixeiro E. Fuentes P. Galocha B. Alarcon B. Bragado R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3993-4002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We originally described Cybr as a cytokine-inducible gene being rapidly induced in NK cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) following IL-2 and IL-12 stimulation (16.Tang P. Cheng T.P. Agnello D. Wu C.-Y. Hissong B.D. Watford W.T. Ahn H.-J. Galon J. Moss J. Vaughan M. O'Shea J.J. Gadina M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It possesses two conserved protein-protein interaction motifs including an N-terminal PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ) domain and a central coiled-coil (CC) motif (16.Tang P. Cheng T.P. Agnello D. Wu C.-Y. Hissong B.D. Watford W.T. Ahn H.-J. Galon J. Moss J. Vaughan M. O'Shea J.J. Gadina M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2625-2629Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), which suggest a participation in signaling complex assembly and intracellular trafficking. In fact, the close relative of Cybr in neuronal cells, termed Tamalin or GRASP, is able to form a complex with metabotropic glutamate receptors and contribute to postsynaptic protein trafficking (18.Kitano J. Kimura K. Yamazaki Y. Soda T. Shigemoto R. Nakajima Y. Nakanishi S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1280-1289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Kitano J. Yamazaki Y. Kimura K. Masukado T. Nakajima Y. Nakanishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14762-14768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Cybr and Tamalin therefore may represent a new family of molecular scaffold proteins. The CC domain of Cybr has been shown to interact with the CC domain in cytohesin-1 (16.Tang P. Cheng T.P. Agnello D. Wu C.-Y. Hissong B.D. Watford W.T. Ahn H.-J. Galon J. Moss J. Vaughan M. O'Shea J.J. Gadina M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Kremmer E. Heufler C. Kolanus W. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1014-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This interaction results in Cybr regulation of cytohesin-1 GEF activity on its substrate, the ADP-ribosylation factor family GTPases (16.Tang P. Cheng T.P. Agnello D. Wu C.-Y. Hissong B.D. Watford W.T. Ahn H.-J. Galon J. Moss J. Vaughan M. O'Shea J.J. Gadina M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2625-2629Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cybr distribution has been shown to be restricted to the cytosolic regions in several cell types (20.Boehm T. Hofer S. Winklehner P. Kellersch B. Geiger C. Troockenbacher A. Neyer S. Figel H. Ebner S. Ivarsson L. Schneider R. Kremmer E. Heufler C. Kolanus W. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1014-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 21.Mansour M. Lee S.Y. Pohajdak B. J. Biol.

Heufler C. Blood. 2005; 107: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in epidermal growth factor-stimulated COS-1 cells overexpressing Cybr and cytohesin, Cybr appears to be recruited from the Golgi compartment to membrane ruffles in a cytohesin-dependent manner (21.Mansour M. Lee S.Y. Pohajdak B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32302-32309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Moreover, in Jurkat T cells, Cybr has been shown to drive cytohesin away from membrane-associated integrins to the cytosol and thus attenuate lymphocyte adhesion (20.Boehm T. Hofer S. Winklehner P. Kellersch B. Geiger C. Troockenbacher A. Neyer S. Figel H. Ebner S. Ivarsson L. Schneider R. Kremmer E. Heufler C. Kolanus W. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1014-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Using small interfering RNA in dendritic cells, Cybr has been shown to be important for controlling dendritic -T cell interaction (22.Hofer S. Pfeil K. Niederegger H. Ebner S. Nguyen V.A. Kremmer E. Auffinger M. Neyer S. Furhapter C. Heufler C. Blood. 2005; 107: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Here, we show that Cybr expression is increased following TCR engagement, and its expression results in augmented NFAT activation. Surprisingly, this is not due to increased Itk-PLC-γ activation or to increased Ca2+ flux. Instead, it appears to result from NFAT·AP-1 cooperation that is in turn regulated via the Vav-JNK/p38 MAPKs signaling pathways. These results demonstrate that Cybr, besides regulating cell-cell interaction, also participates in the signaling cascade downstream of the TCR and plays a functional role in the control of TCR-dependent gene transcription. Cells, Plasmids, Antibodies, and Chemical Reagents—The human leukemic T-cell line Jurkat, subclone E6 was maintained in standard growth medium (RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml of penicillin/streptomycin). Human PBMCs from normal healthy volunteers were purified by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation and incubated in standard RPMI 1640 growth medium overnight before the stimulation. The cDNA encoding X-press-tagged Cybr in the pEF-HisC mammalian expression vector has been previously described (16.Tang P. Cheng T.P. Agnello D. Wu C.-Y. Hissong B.D. Watford W.T. Ahn H.-J. Galon J.

The NFAT luciferase reporter construct pGL3-NFAT3-luciferase (pNFAT-Luc), consisting of three direct copies of the murine IL-4 high affinity NFAT site (region –82 to –64 of the murine IL-4 promoter) (23.Kim L.J. Ferguson H.A. Seto A.G. Goodrich J.A. BMC Immunol. 2000; 1: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 24.Kim L.J. Seto A.G. Nguyen T.N. Goodrich J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3503-3513Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) was a generous gift of Dr. James A. Goodrich (University of Colorado, Boulder, CO). The NFAT-IFN luciferase reporter construct was a generous gift of Dr. A. Altman (La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology, La Jolla, CA) and was described previously (25.Kaminuma O. Deckert M. Elly C. Liu Y.C. Altman A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3126-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). pAP-1-Luc (AP-1, 7×) luciferase reporter gene construct was kindly provided by Dr. M. Chiariello (CNR, Napoli, Italy). Anti-CD3 OKT3 monoclonal antibody was purified from culture supernatants of the corresponding hybridomas by protein G-Sepharose chromatography. Polyclonal anti-CASP Ab was raised in rabbits using the purified C-terminal domain of CASP, amino acids 253–350 fused to a His6 tag, as immunogen. Polyclonal anti-Itk Ab was generously provided by Dr. Joseph Bolen and Dr. Mike Tomlinson (University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK). The following antibodies were purchased: monoclonal anti-X-press (Invitrogen); monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY); goat anti-mouse (GAM) IgG (Sigma); polyclonal anti-Vav and polyclonal anti-phospho-PLC-γ1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); monoclonal anti-phospho-ERK, polyclonal anti-phospho-JNK and p38, polyclonal anti-JNK and p38 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA); monoclonal anti-ERK2 (BD Biosciences) monoclonal anti-Rac1 Ab (Upstate Biotechnology), monoclonal anti-phospho-Akt, and monoclonal anti-Akt (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). The JNK inhibitor II (SP600125) was purchased from Calbiochem. p38 inhibitor (SB202190) was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). The following reagents were purchased from Sigma: ionomycin, phytohemagglutinin (PHA), isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and cyclosporin A (CsA). The transfection reagent METAFECTENE (Biontex, Germany) was utilized for the Jurkat cells experiments according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA Extraction and Reverse Transcriptase-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was prepared by the RNA STAT60 (Biogenesis) isolation system. Reverse transcription-PCR was performed with 1 μg of total RNA using the OneStep reverse transcription-PCR kit (Qiagen) and following the manufacturer's protocol. PCR amplification was performed using primer pairs specific for X-press-Cybr (forward primer, 5′-CTT TAC AAA GGC TCC TGC AAC ACA-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GGC AAT TAG ATG CAT CAC CAT GAA G-3′) and for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (forward primer, 5′-TGA TGA CAT CAA GAA GGT GG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TTA CTC CTT GGA GGC CAT GT-3′). Cell Stimulations and Luciferase Assays—For TCR cross-linking experiments, transfected Jurkat cells were transferred to 6-well plates, which had been precoated with OKT3. The inhibitors, including CsA, JNK inhibitor II, and SB202190 at a final concentration of 100 ng/ml, 30 μm, and 20 μm, respectively, were added to cells 30 min before OKT3 (10 μg/ml) stimulation. The inhibitors were present during the entire period of cross-linking with OKT3. Cells were then washed once in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in the reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured using a Centro LB 960 Microplate Luminometer (Berthold Technologies). The Promega dual luciferase reporter assay system was used to normalize the transfection efficiency. Luciferase activity was assayed in triplicate and expressed as the ratio of firefly luciferase activity normalized to Renilla luciferase. Stimulation, Immunoprecipitation, Immunoblotting, and Rac1 Pull-down Assay—Cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended in 1 ml of serum-free medium containing OKT3 (1 μg/ml) and incubated on ice for 30 min before being placed at 37 °C for an additional 3 min. Cross-linking was achieved by adding GAM (20 μl/ml) at 37 °C for the indicated times. The stimulations were terminated by the addition of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.4 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2.5 μm p-nitrophenyl p-guanidinobenzoate. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay. For immunoprecipitation experiments, the protein A-Sepharose beads were preassociated with antibodies for 2 h. Lysates were immunoprecipitated for 1 h at 4°C. The beads were then washed five times with Triton X-100 wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 0.4 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2.5 μm p-nitrophenyl p-guanidinobenzoate). Immunoprecipitates or whole-cell lysates were boiled in 2× Laemmli buffer and resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE. The Escherichia coli DH5α bacteria expressing the recombinant GST-PBD (GST fused to the Rac binding domain of Pak) were treated with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to induce the expression of GST fusion protein. The bacteria were then resuspended in E. coli lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and lysed by sonication (Vibra Cell™ Sonics & Materials Inc., Danbury, CT). Following resuspension, the GST-PBD fusion proteins were purified by incubation with the glutathione-coupled Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4°C. Cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline and then suspended in cold lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl, supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors. Cell lysates were then precipitated with GST-PBD beads at 4 °C for 1 h. The active, GTP-loaded form of Rac1 was separated using SDS-12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were transferred electrophoretically to Immobilon™-P polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membrane (Millipore). Membranes were blocked and incubated with the relevant antibodies for 2 h, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit secondary Abs (Bio-Rad). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence and the ChemiDoc SRS imaging system (Bio-Rad). Membranes were stripped and then reprobed to confirm equal loading. Determination of Ca2+ Flux—107 transiently transfected Jurkat cells were washed twice with 1× Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 1 mm calcium, 1 mm magnesium, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin and resuspended in 1 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution. Fluo-3™ AM and Fura Red™ AM (Invitrogen) were added to a final concentration of 5 and 10 μl/ml, respectively. Cells were then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. In order to allow complete de-esterification of intracellular AM esters, cells were diluted 1:5 by adding 4 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution plus 1% fetal calf serum and incubated for a further 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed three times with Hanks' balanced salt solution plus 1% fetal calf serum and resuspended in 7 ml of Hepes-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 5 mm glucose, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 g/liter bovine serum albumin, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4). Cells were maintained in darkness until acquisition. Analyses were performed at room temperature on a Cyan™ flow cytometer (DAKO Cytomation). Results were shown as histograms of the fluorescence ratio (Fluo-3/Fura Red) versus time. A complete run of 380 s was recorded. Stimulation with the Ca2+ ionophore, ionomycin (1 μg/ml), was used as measurement of maximal activity. Cybr Is Inducible upon TCR Triggering—We recently identified Cybr as a cytokine-inducible gene preferentially expressed in immune cells. Notably, Cybr expression was elevated in differentiated Th1 cells and low in Th2 cells. In the latter cells, expression was increased upon stimulation with phorbol ester and ionomycin (16.Tang P. Cheng T.P. Agnello D. Wu C.-Y. Hissong B.D. Watford W.T. Ahn H.-J. Galon J. Moss J. Vaughan M. O'Shea J.J. Gadina M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2625-2629Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Since this stimulation mimics the effects of TCR ligation, we therefore sought to determine whether TCR cross-linking could also augment Cybr expression. Levels of Cybr mRNA were analyzed in PBMCs by reverse transcription-PCR upon CD3 cross-linking (Fig. 1A). In freshly isolated unstimulated PBMCs, Cybr was barely detected but was induced after 1 h of stimulation (lane 4). Its level then rapidly decreases after 2 h (lane 5), although it became enhanced again after 24 h (lane 8). We also analyzed Cybr mRNA expression in the T cell line Jurkat (Fig. 1B). As previously reported, Cybr mRNA in Jurkat appeared to be undetectable, but it was observed after 2 h and peaked after 6 ho f treatment. Interestingly, in these cells, Cybr mRNA levels remained elevated for 24 h after OKT3 treatment. To further analyze the regulation of Cybr in T lymphocytes at the protein level, freshly isolated human PBMCs were incubated for 3 days in the presence of PHA to induce T cell proliferation. Cells were then left unstimulated or were stimulated with plate-bound OKT3. The expression of Cybr protein was then detected using a polyclonal Cybr antiserum (Fig. 1C). Cybr protein levels were detected at 8 h upon OKT3 treatment and reached maximum levels at about 16 h. Furthermore, we immunoblotted whole-cell lysates (WCL) from Jurkat cells treated with OKT3 (Fig. 1D). The expression of Cybr protein after incubation for 2 h with OKT3 was augmented as compared with unstimulated Jurkat T cells and was still elevated after 24 h. Together, these experiments revealed that Cybr levels are induced following TCR engagement. Cybr Expression Enhances TCR-induced NFAT Activity—Having observed increased Cybr expression upon CD3 cross-linking, we hypothesized that Cybr might be involved in signaling events downstream of the TCR. The NFAT family of proteins are key transcription factors that regulate early gene transcription and cytokine production following TCR stimulation (26.Woodrow M. Clipstone N.A. Cantrell D. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1517-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We therefore evaluated the effect of Cybr on NFAT transcriptional activation upon mitogen stimulation. We utilized the Jurkat cell line, which does not express any basal level of Cybr and therefore constituted an ideal model. To evaluate the effects of the presence of Cybr, we transiently transfected the pNFAT-Luc vector, which contains three copies of the region –82 to –64 of the murine IL-4 promoter (24.Kim L.J. Seto A.G. Nguyen T.N. Goodrich J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3503-3513Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) along with either Cybr plasmid or a control plasmid. As shown in Fig. 2A (top), stimulation with PHA or OKT3 induced NFAT-dependent transcription in control cells, which was robustly enhanced when Cybr was expressed. Expression of Cybr in the cells was confirmed by analyzing cell lysates by Western blot (Fig. 2A, bottom). We therefore wondered if the presence of Cybr was able to alter the cellular responses to TCR engagement. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of Cybr expression upon TCR activation at different doses of anti-CD3. In Fig. 2B, EV- or Cybr-transfected cells were assayed for the transcriptional activity of NFAT after incubation with increasing concentrations of plate-bound OKT3. Cybr effects were noticeable at doses of OKT3 above 5 μg/ml. Taken together, these data suggest that Cybr can augment TCR-dependent NFAT activation in a dose-dependent manner. TCR-dependent Cybr-enhanced NFAT Activation Is Dependent on Calcineurin Activity but Is Not Mediated by Increased ITK or PLC-γ1 Activity—NFAT activity is controlled by the Ca2+-calmodulin-regulated phosphatase, calcineurin, and therefore regulated by the levels of cytoplasmic calcium (5.Winslow M.M. Neilson J.R. Crabtree G.R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The immuonosuppressive drug CsA binds to immunophilins and inactivates calcineurin, hence impairing NFAT nuclear import and subsequent activation (27.Matsuda S. Shibasaki F. Takehana K. Mori H. Nishida E. Koyasu S. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 428-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In order to verify if Cybr regulation of NFAT occurs via the classical Ca2+-calcineurin pathway, we examined the inhibitory effect of CsA on Cybr-expressing Jurkat cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, OKT3-induced NFAT activation in control cells was totally suppressed by CsA. Notably, the up-regulation induced by Cybr was also inhibited by CsA, suggesting the requirement of a CsA-sensitive signaling pathway for Cybr-mediated NFAT activation. The rapid proximal signaling events following TCR activation require tyrosine kinases of the Src and Syk families, which, in concert, lead to the activation of the Tec family tyrosine kinase Itk. In conjunction with other T cell-specific adaptor proteins, Itk has been implicated in PLC-γ1 activation, a step essential for optimal Ca2+/calcineurin/NFAT activity (2.Huang Y. Wange R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28827-28830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 5.Winslow M.M. Neilson J.R. Crabtree G.R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Since the enhanced TCR-mediated NFAT activation observed with Cybr was CsA-sensitive, we then examined whether the influence of Cybr was the result of an augmented activation of the Itk-PLC-γ pathway. To explore this, control or Cybr-expressing Jurkat cells were stimulated with OKT3, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an Itk Ab, and tyrosine phosphorylation was examined, whereas PLC-γ1 phosphorylation was analyzed using a phospho-specific Ab. As shown in Fig. 3B (i and ii), TCR stimuli induced the phosphorylation of both Itk and PLC-γ1 in Jurkat cells with maximal levels of activation about 3 min after stimulation, which quickly declined within 10 min. Interestingly, in the presence of Cybr, Itk and PLC-γ1 activation followed similar kinetics with no appreciable differences. Therefore, although both Itk and PLC-γ1 are activated by TCR engagement and lie upstream of NFAT, their activation is not affected by the presence of Cybr. Having observed that Cybr-induced NFAT luciferase activity is calcineurin-dependent but not Itk and PLC-γ1-dependent, we then investigated the role of Cybr in TCR-induced Ca2+ mobilization. Jurkat cells were loaded with the Ca2+-sensitive dyes, Fluo-3 and Fura-Red, treated with OKT3 and calcium flux, and then analyzed by flow cytometry. Both control and Cybr-expressing cells showed a Ca2+ elevation with similar kinetics and amplitude, suggesting that Cybr had no effect on TCR-induced Ca2+ mobilization. Ionomycin (Fig. 3C, iii) was used as a positive control.

https://openalex.org/W2059495768,"Retroviral integration mutagenesis and treatment with the frameshift mutagen ICR191 were used to transform v-H-ras expressing PB-3c cells to interleukin-3 (IL-3) independence. Six clones displayed viral integrations into the 3' region of the IL-3 gene thus acting post-transcriptionally by disrupting the AU-rich instability element. Two clones contained reverse orientation integration into the raf-1 gene revealing an enhancer insertion mechanism. Growth by this mechanism was sensitive to the Raf-1 inhibitor BAY 43-9006 and the Mek inhibitor U0126. Following treatment with ICR191, IL-3-independent clones were recovered and studied by cell fusion. With 21/22 clones, IL-3 independence resulted from a recessive mechanism as cellular hybrids with parental cells reverted to IL-3 dependence. Recessive clone D2c displayed increased phospho-Erk1/2 levels and was growth sensitive to U0126, but not to BAY43-9006. The single dominant clone, D5a, showed no signs of mitogen-activated protein kinases pathway activation but displayed constitutive phosphorylation of Stat5. We conclude that PB-3c has several options to acquire IL-3 growth autonomy involving transcriptional or post-transcriptional mechanisms affecting the distal regulators Erk or Stat5. The reported panel of independent dominant and recessive transformants should provide a useful tool for inhibitor profiling."
