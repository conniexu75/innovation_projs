https://openalex.org/W2050573110,"Expression of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) generates adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-regulated chloride channels, indicating that CFTR is either a chloride channel or a chloride channel regulator. To distinguish between these possibilities, basic amino acids in the putative transmembrane domains were mutated. The sequence of anion selectivity of cAMP-regulated channels in cells containing either endogenous or recombinant CFTR was bromide greater than chloride greater than iodide greater than fluoride. Mutation of the lysines at positions 95 or 335 to acidic amino acids converted the selectivity sequence to iodide greater than bromide greater than chloride greater than fluoride. These data indicate that CFTR is a cAMP-regulated chloride channel and that lysines 95 and 335 determine anion selectivity."
https://openalex.org/W2066906496,"The most frequently occurring RNA hairpins in 16S and 23S ribosomal RNA contain a tetranucleotide loop that has a GNRA consensus sequence. The solution structures of the GCAA and GAAA hairpins have been determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Both loops contain an unusual G-A base pair between the first and last residue in the loop, a hydrogen bond between a G base and a phosphate, extensive base stacking, and a hydrogen bond between a sugar 2'-end OH and a base. These interactions explain the high stability of these hairpins and the sequence requirements for the variant and invariant nucleotides in the GNRA tetranucleotide loop family."

https://openalex.org/W1546312651,"The specificity of endothelial cell leukocyte adhesion molecule-1, ELAM-1, for binding to a panel of carbohydrate structures was determined by a sensitive cell binding assay with immobilized synthetic glycoconjugates. ELAM-1 cDNA transfectants were found to bind Sialyl Lea (sialylated lacto-N-fucopentaose II) or sialylated Lewis a antigen (NeuAc alpha 2-3Gal beta 1-3(Fuc alpha 1-4)GlcNAc), as well as or slightly better than Sialyl Lex (sialylated lacto-N-fucopentaose III) or sialylated Lewis X antigen (NeuAc alpha 2-3 Gal beta 1-4(Fuc alpha 1-3)GlcNAc). A monoclonal antibody, HECA-452, which has been identified recently as recognizing ELAM-1 ligands in addition to those containing Sialyl Lex, was also found to bind both Sialyl Lex and Sialyl Lea. Hard sphere exo-anomeric (HSEA) calculations were performed on these two hexasaccharides. The conformations indicate that Sialyl Lea and Sialyl Lex show a high degree of similarity in both the nonreducing and reducing termini. As Lea and Lex show much weaker reactivity, the determinants recognized by ELAM-1 and HECA-452 probably involve neuraminic acid and fucose residues which on one face of both Sialyl Lex and Sialyl Lea can be similarly positioned. The finding that Sialyl Lea is a potent ligand for ELAM-1 is important, as circulating Sialyl Lea and Sialyl Lex containing mucins which are elevated in the serum of many cancer patients may block leukocyte interactions with ELAM-1 and may contribute to the pathological immunodepression observed in these patients."
https://openalex.org/W2005040944,"The gene coxII, normally present in the mitochondrion, was functionally transferred to the nucleus during flowering plant evolution. coxII transfer is estimated to have occurred between 60 and 200 million years ago, whereas loss of coxII from the mitochondrion occurred much more recently, being restricted to a single genus of legumes. Most legumes have coxII in both the nucleus and the mitochondrion; however, no evidence is found for simultaneous coxII expression in both compartments. The nuclear coxII sequence more closely resembles edited mitochondrial coxII transcripts than the genes encoding these RNAs. Hence, gene transfer appears to have involved reverse transcription of an edited RNA intermediate. The nuclear gene contains an intron at the junction of the transit peptide sequence and the mature protein-coding sequence; exon shuffling may have played a role in assembling a functional coxII gene in the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2000101394,"We previously demonstrated that expression of an albumin-urokinase-type plasminogen activator (Alb-uPA) fusion construct in transgenic mice resulted in elevated plasma uPA concentration, hypofibrinogenemia, and neonatal hemorrhaging. Two lines of Alb-uPA mice were established in which only one half of the transgenic pups died at birth; surprisingly, plasma uPA concentrations in survivors gradually returned to normal by 2 months of age. The basis for this phenomenon is DNA rearrangement within hepatocytes that affects the transgene tandem array and abolishes transgene expression. Transgene-deficient cells selectively proliferate relative to surrounding liver, and this process culminates in replacement of the entire liver by clonal hepatic nodules derived from transgene-deficient progenitor cells. In some cases as few as two nodules can reconstitute over 90% of liver mass, highlighting the remarkable regenerative capacity of individual liver cells."
https://openalex.org/W2035177679,"The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which forms adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP)-regulated chloride channels, is defective in patients with cystic fibrosis. This protein contains two putative nucleotide binding domains (NBD1 and NBD2) and an R domain. CFTR in which the R domain was deleted (CFTRΔR) conducted chloride independently of the presence of cAMP. However, sites within CFTR other than those deleted also respond to cAMP, because the chloride current of CFTRΔR increased further in response to cAMP stimulation. In addition, deletion of the R domain suppressed the inactivating effect of a mutation in NBD2 (but not NBD1), a result which suggests that NBD2 interacts with the channel through the R domain."
https://openalex.org/W2070132182,"The 2.05 angstrom (A) resolution crystal structure of a dodecasaccharide-Fab complex revealed an unusual carbohydrate recognition site, defined by aromatic amino acids and a structured water molecule, rather than the carboxylic acid and amide side chains and a structured water molecule, rather than the carboxylic acid and amide side chains that are features of transport and other carbohydrate binding proteins. A trisaccharide epitope of a branched bacterial lipopolysaccharide fills this hydrophobic pocket (8 A deep by 7 A wide) in an entropy-assisted association (association constant = 2.05 x 10(5) liters per mole, enthalpy = -20.5 +/- 1.7 kilojoules per mole, and temperature times entropy = +10.0 +/- 2.9 kilojoules per mole). The requirement for the complementarity of van der Waals surfaces and the requirements of saccharide-saccharide and protein-saccharide hydrogen-bonding networks determine the antigen conformation adopted in the bound state."
https://openalex.org/W1506255962,"The involvement of the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) in chylomicron remnant (CR) catabolism was investigated. Ligand blot analyses demonstrated that beta-very low density lipoproteins (beta-VLDL) incubated with apolipoprotein E (beta-VLDL+E) bound to the LRP and low density lipoprotein receptors, whereas active (receptor-binding) alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) bound only to LRP partially purified from rat liver membranes. Iodinated beta-VLDL+E and active alpha 2M showed high affinity binding to the LRP/alpha 2M receptor of low density lipoprotein receptor-negative fibroblasts. The binding and degradation of radiolabeled alpha 2M by these cells were partially inhibited by beta-VLDL+E. Furthermore, alpha 2M interfered with the internalization of beta-VLDL+E and subsequent induction in the cholesterol esterification by these cells. These studies suggested that remnant lipoproteins and active alpha 2M compete for binding to the LRP/alpha 2M receptor. Next, we examined whether the LRP/alpha 2M receptor plays a role, in the presence of low density lipoprotein receptors, in the in vivo catabolism of CR in mice. In vivo studies demonstrated that the unlabeled active, but not the native, alpha 2M partially inhibited the plasma clearance and hepatic uptake of radiolabeled CR or apoE-enriched radiolabled CR. Likewise, apoE-enriched CR retarded the plasma clearance and hepatic uptake of radiolabeled active alpha 2M. These studies provide physiological evidence that the LRP/alpha 2M receptor may function as a CR receptor that removes CR from the plasma."
https://openalex.org/W1590765841,"The molecular basis for binding of alpha-macroglobulin-proteinase complexes to the human two-chain 500/85-kDa (alpha/beta) alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) receptor (alpha 2MR)/low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein was analyzed. Ligand blotting experiments showed that a 40-kDa protein, present in the affinity-purified alpha 2MR preparation, is bound to the alpha 2MR alpha-chain and released by heparin. Removal of the 40-kDa protein resulted in a 3-5-fold increase in binding of alpha 2M-trypsin. Nitrocellulose-immobilized pure two-chain alpha 2MR was incubated with human alpha 2M-trypsin, containing four identical subunits, and two monovalent ligands: rat alpha 1-inhibitor-3-chymotrypsin and the 18-kDa receptor binding fragment of the alpha 2M subunit. Binding of alpha 2M-trypsin to the alpha-chain of immobilized alpha 2MR was composed of a high (Kd = 40 pM at 4 degrees C) and a low (Kd = 2 nM) affinity component. alpha 1-Inhibitor-3-chymotrypsin bound to the same sites but with one component (Kd = 0.4 nM). Competition-inhibition experiments and dissociation experiments, using ligands with different valences, as well as experiments with alpha 2MR immobilized at different densities, led to the following model. The low (Kd = 2 nM) affinity of alpha 2M-proteinase is prevalent when only one of the four domains binds to alpha 2MR, i.e. when the receptor density is low or when neighboring receptors are occupied. The high (Kd = 40 pM) affinity is achieved by binding of at least two domains to adjacent receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1858317139,"The three-dimensional crystal structure of the complex between the Fab from the monoclonal anti-lysozyme antibody D1.3 and the antigen, hen egg white lysozyme, has been refined by crystallographic techniques using x-ray intensity data to 2.5-A resolution. The antibody contacts the antigen with residues from all its complementarity determining regions. Antigen residues 18-27 and 117-125 form a discontinuous antigenic determinant making hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions with the antibody. Water molecules at or near the antigen-antibody interface mediate some contacts between antigen and antibody. The fine specificity of antibody D1.3, which does not bind (K alpha less than 10(5) M-1) avian lysozymes where Gln121 in the amino acid sequence is occupied by His, can be explained on the basis of the refined model."
https://openalex.org/W1535615780,"Mutants of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. Pasteur Culture Collection (PCC) 6803 that specifically lack the extrinsic 33-kDa manganese-stabilizing polypeptide of the photosystem II oxygen-evolving complex have been constructed by two independent methods. Cartridge mutagenesis was used to insertionally inactivate the psbO gene of one mutant and completely delete the psbO gene of the other mutant. These mutants have no detectable manganese-stabilizing polypeptide, but they do accumulate steady-state levels of the intrinsic photosystem II polypeptides D1, D2, and CP-43 that are comparable to wild-type, as determined by immunoblot analysis. Measurement of the evolution of the relative quantum yields of chlorophyll fluorescence following actinic flash excitation indicates that though the concentration of reaction centers in mutant cells is comparable to that of wild-type cells, approximately 40% of these centers harbor a fluorescence-quenching species other than P680+. The mutants are capable of photoautotrophic growth at a slower rate than that of wild-type. Under conditions of Ca2+ depletion where wild-type growth is unaffected, the mutants are unable to grow at all. The manganese-stabilizing protein, therefore, enhances the binding of Ca2+ or protects the reaction center at low Ca2+ concentrations. The mutant evolve oxygen at approximately 70% of the wild-type rate, but are completely photoinactivated by high light intensities. Our results indicate that the manganese-stabilizing polypeptide is not absolutely required for photosystem II assembly or function in cyanobacteria, but its absence does lead to an enhanced sensitivity to photoinhibition."
https://openalex.org/W1518221901,"The TIS21 gene is a primary response gene that is induced rapidly and transiently in 3T3 cells by the tumor promoter and mitogen tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate. The predicted open reading frame of the TIS21 cDNA encodes a protein of 158 amino acids with no obvious similarity to any known protein. Antiserum prepared to TIS21 recombinant protein produced in Escherichia coli precipitates a 17-kDa protein from Swiss 3T3 cells. The 2040-nucleotide 3'-untranslated region of the cDNA includes an unusual T18 sequence. The TIS21 gene has a single 1.4-kilobase intron which interrupts the open reading frame and is otherwise identical to the cDNA sequence. The 5'-flanking sequence of the TIS21 gene contains TATA and CAAT box-type sequences, three potential Sp1 sites, two putative cyclic AMP response elements, two potential AP1 binding elements, and an AP2 element. A possible Z-DNA structure of 29 AC repeats is present 660 nucleotides from the start of transcription. Expression from a luciferase reporter construct containing a 460-nucleotide fragment of the TIS21 promoter is induced by tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate, forskolin, epidermal growth factor, and serum, despite the absence of a consensus serum response element."
https://openalex.org/W1575463095,"Interleukin-2 (IL-2) stimulates proliferation of T lymphocytes and is involved in the activation of both natural killer and lymphokine-activated killer precursor cells. The intracellular messengers which mediate IL-2-dependent events have not yet been identified. IL-2 receptor is not a protein-tyrosine kinase. Activation of a cellular protein-tyrosine kinase and direct association of a protein-tyrosine kinase activity with the IL-2 receptor occurs within minutes of IL-2 stimulation. We investigated the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) in IL-2-mediated signal transduction using the IL-2-dependent murine T-cell line, CTLL-2, and human phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes (phytohemagglutinin blasts). Within a minute following stimulation of these cells with IL-2, PI 3-kinase activity could be detected in antiphosphotyrosine (anti-P-Tyr) antibody immunoprecipitates. IL-2 triggered a direct association of PI 3-kinase with the IL-2 receptor as detected in immunoprecipitates using anti-IL-2 receptor beta chain antibody. In vivo labeled CTLL-2 cells have a time-dependent increase in D-3-phosphorylated polyphosphoinositides following stimulation with IL-2. This is the first group of second messengers identified in IL-2-mediated signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1518928102,"As resolved by electrophoresis in non-reducing SDS gels, transferrin newly made in Hep G2 cells migrates as a very diffuse set of species. During a subsequent 1-h chase all transferrin polypeptides are converted to a single, rapidly migrating species. These changes in gel mobility are due to alterations in the pattern of disulfide bonding, are not caused by carbohydrate processing, and occur while the protein is in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Cyclosporin A causes an approximately 10-min lag in transferrin folding, after which folding resumes at the normal rate. Cyclosporin A also retards transferrin maturation from the endoplasmic reticulum and its secretion, at concentrations that do not affect secretion of other hepatoma proteins. Neither FK506 nor rapamycin affect transferrin folding. We conclude that an initial stage in transferrin folding is accelerated by an endoplasmic reticulum peptidyl-proline isomerase that is inhibited by cyclosporin A."
https://openalex.org/W1604903306,"The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to examine alternative splicing at each of the three fibronectin exons known to undergo alternative splicing, i.e. extra domain A (ED-A), extra domain B (ED-B), and type III connecting sequence (IIICS). Ratios of fibronectin mRNAs with or without a given exon were determined in several rat tissues and human cell lines during aging in vivo and cellular senescence in vitro. We demonstrate that statistically significant shifts in the alternative splicing of fibronectin occur during aging in vivo and in vitro. Since all three alternatively spliced exons are spliced out at a higher frequency in aging tissues and cells, the fibronectin protein produced by old cells should be slightly smaller than that obtained from young cells. The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction demonstrates tissue-specific patterns of alternative splicing in several tissues. Whereas fibronectin mRNAs from adult rat tissues were found to range from 0 to 25% ED-A+ and from 0 to 10% ED-B+, fibronectin mRNAs from cultured cell lines were found to be approximately 50-60% ED-A+ and 15-25% ED-B+. We observed similarity in splicing of fibronectin RNA by the different cultured cell lines obtained from many tissues and attribute this observation to the effect of growth factors. We demonstrate that serum deprivation; placement of cells into primary culture; and growth factors such as transforming growth factor beta 1, retinoic acid, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 can all change the alternative splicing of fibronectin pre-mRNA in the ED-A, ED-B, and type III connecting sequence exons. Possible mechanisms for the regulation of the alternative splicing of fibronectin RNA by growth factors are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1595932863,"Nevirapine (BI-RG-587) is a potent and specific non-nucleoside inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 reverse transcriptase. The compound is non-competitive with respect to template, primer, and nucleoside triphosphates indicating that BI-RG-587 does not act directly at the catalytic site. The binding site for this inhibitor was investigated by employing an azido photoaffinity analogue, BI-RJ-70, to covalently label the enzyme. The resulting photoadduct was subjected to enzymatic digestion by trypsin and endoproteinase lys-C and a single, highly labeled peptide was identified as residues 174-199. Sequencing of this peptide identified Tyr-181 and Tyr-188 as labeled residues."
https://openalex.org/W1894296128,"The epitope of monoclonal antibody (mAb 4A), which recognizes the alpha subunit of the rod G protein, Gt, has been suggested to be both at the carboxyl terminus (Deretic, D., and Hamm, H.E. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 10839-10847) and the amino terminus (Navon, S.E., and Fung, B.K.-K. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 489-496) of the molecule. To characterize further the mAb 4A binding site on alpha t and to resolve the discrepancy between these results limited proteolytic digestion of Gt or alpha t using four proteases with different substrate specificities has been performed. Endoproteinase Arg-C, which cleaves the peptide bond at the carboxylic side of arginine residues, cleaved the majority of alpha t into two fragments of 34 and 5 kDa. The alpha t 34-kDa fragment in the holoprotein, but not alpha t-guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate), was converted further to a 23-kDa fragment. A small fraction of alpha t-GDP was cleaved into 23- and 15-kDa fragments. Endoproteinase Lys-C, which selectively cleaves at lysine residues, progressively removed 17 and then 8 residues from the amino terminus, forming 38- and 36-kDa fragments. Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease is known to remove 21 amino acid residues from the amino-terminal region of alpha t, with the formation of a 38-kDa fragment. L-1-Tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin cleaved alpha t progressively into fragments of known amino acid sequences (38, then 32 and 5, then 21 and 12 kDa) and a transient 34 kDa fragment. The binding of mAb 4A to proteolytic fragments was analyzed by Western blot and immunoprecipitation. The major fragments recognized by mAb 4A on Western blots were the 34- and 23-kDa fragments obtained by endoproteinase Arg-C and tryptic digestion. Under conditions that allowed sequencing of the 15- and 5-kDa fragments neither the 34- nor the 23-kDa fragments could be sequenced by Edman degradation, indicating that they contained a blocked amino terminus. The smallest fragment that retained mAb 4A binding was the 23-kDa fragment containing Met1 to Arg204. Thus the main portion of the mAb 4A antigenic site was located within this fragment, indicating that the carboxyl-terminal residues from Lys205 to Phe350 were not required for recognition by the antibody. Additionally, the antibody did not bind the 38- and 36-kDa or other fragments containing the carboxyl terminus, showing that the amino-terminal residues from Met1 to Lys17 were essential for antibody binding to alpha t."

https://openalex.org/W1564949238,"The protein predicted by the sequence of the human pim-1 proto-oncogene shares extensive homology with known serine/threonine protein kinases, and yet the human Pim-1 enzyme has previously been reported to exhibit protein tyrosine kinase activity both in vitro and in vivo. Recently a new class of protein kinases has been identified which exhibits both protein-serine/threonine and protein-tyrosine kinase activities. We therefore investigated the possibility that the human Pim-1 kinase likewise possesses such bifunctional enzymatic phosphorylating activities. A full-length human pim-1 cDNA was subcloned into the bacterial vector pGEX-2T and the Pim-1 protein expressed as a fusion product with bacterial glutathione S-transferase (GST). The hybrid GST-Pim-1 fusion protein was affinity purified on a glutathione-Sepharose column prior to treatment with thrombin for cleavage of the Pim-1 protein from the transferase. Pim-1 was purified and the identity of recombinant protein confirmed by amino-terminal sequence analysis. Pim-1 was tested for kinase activity with a variety of proteins and peptides known to be substrates for either mammalian protein-serine/threonine or protein-tyrosine kinases and was found to phosphorylate serine/threonine residues exclusively in vitro. Both the Pim-1-GST fusion protein and the isolated Pim-1 protein exhibited only serine/threonine phosphorylating activity under all in vitro conditions tested. Pim-1 phosphorylated purified mammalian histone H1 with a Km of approximately 51 microM. Additionally, Pim-1 exhibited low levels of serine/threonine autophosphorylating activity. These observations place the human Pim-1 in a small select group of cytoplasmic transforming oncogenic kinases, including the protein kinase C, the Raf/Mil, and the Mos subfamilies, exhibiting serine/threonine phosphorylating activity."
https://openalex.org/W1640512254,"Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is one of the most potent chemotactic agents for neutrophils and has been implicated as a major mediator of inflammation. The IL-8 receptor is expressed exclusively in neutrophils and belongs to the family of G-protein-coupled receptors. In a recent paper we reported the characterization of a cDNA clone, F3R, isolated from a neutrophil cDNA library and showed that it encodes a G-protein-coupled receptor which is exclusively expressed in neutrophils. We also suggested, based on expression studies in Xenopus oocytes, that the F3R protein product is an isoform of the (fMLP) receptor (Thomas, K. M., Pyun, H. Y., and Navarro, J. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 20061-20064). In this work, the F3R receptor cDNA is expressed in monkey kidney cells (COS-7) and is shown to encode the IL-8 receptor. F3R cDNA does not encode for a fMLP receptor isoform. We show conclusively that the F3R-transfected COS-7 cells express the IL-8 receptor at a density equivalent to that observed in neutrophils. The pharmacological profile of the F3R-transfected cells is the same as that of neutrophils. The apparent Kd values for binding of 125I-IL-8 to neutrophils and F3R-transfected COS-7 cell membranes were 1.2 and 1.4 nM, respectively. Antipeptide antibodies against a partial sequence of the F3R protein product specifically immunoprecipitate the IL-8 receptor from transfected cells as well as neutrophils. The molecular characterization of the IL-8 receptor should provide the basis for further studies on the identification of the binding domain of this inflammatory receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1492769088,"Abstract The lutropin (LH), follitropin, and thyrotropin receptors belong to the superfamily of G-protein coupled receptors and have some unique structural features. These glycoprotein hormone receptors comprise a C-terminal half and an N-terminal half of similar size. The C-terminal half is equivalent to the entire structure of other G-protein coupled receptors and has seven transmembrane domains, three cytoplasmic loops, three exoplasmic loops, and a C terminus. In contrast, the hydrophilic N-terminal half is exoplasmic and unique to the glycoprotein hormone receptors. This large N-terminal half of the LH receptor has recently been shown to be capable of binding the hormone. Therefore, these glycoprotein hormone receptors are structurally and functionally different from other G-protein coupled receptors. In an attempt to define the role of the membrane-associated C-terminal half of the LH receptor, we have prepared several mutant receptors in which an Asp or Glu in the seven transmembrane domains has been converted to Asn or Gln, respectively. These include Asp383----Asn in the second transmembrane domain, Glu410----Gln in the third transmembrane domain, and Asp556----Asn in the sixth transmembrane domain. All these mutant receptors were successfully expressed in Cos 7A cells. The Glu410----Gln and Asp556----Asn mutants maintained normal affinities for hormone binding and cAMP production, but the Asp383----Asn mutant showed significantly lower affinities. Although Asp383 of the LH receptor is conserved in all G-protein coupled receptors cloned to date except the substance P receptor, which has Glu in the place of the Asp residue, this is the first observation of the critical role of the Asp in hormone binding and subsequent stimulation of cAMP production."
https://openalex.org/W1546961183,"To identify agents and mechanisms responsible for the thickened basement membranes characteristic of diabetic angiopathy we examined the effects of high glucose (30 mM) on the expression of genes related to extracellular matrix composition and turnover and investigated whether the changes induced by high glucose were mimicked and sustained by activation of protein kinase C or A. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells high glucose increased fibronectin, collagen IV, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and plasminogen activator-inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) mRNA levels 2-fold but did not affect type IV and interstitial collagenase expression. Acute treatment with phorbol esters resulted in increased collagen IV, tPA, PAI-1, and interstitial collagenase mRNAs; the type IV collagenase mRNA levels were instead suppressed to 50% of control. Upon longer exposure to phorbol esters (48 h) suppression of fibronectin and PAI-1 mRNAs also occurred. Intracellular elevation of cAMP led to over-expression of fibronectin and type IV collagenase and potentiated the effects of phorbol esters on collagen IV, tPA, and interstitial collagenase expression. The mRNA changes induced by high glucose occurred in the absence of protein kinase C activation or cAMP elevation. These studies indicate that events other than activation of protein kinase C or A bridge high ambient glucose to changes in endothelial cell gene expression that may contribute to diabetic angiopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2070062447,"The isoprotein-specific intracompartmental sorting of the three essential myosin light chains (LCs), the skeletal muscle LC-1f and LC-3f and the nonmuscle LC-3nm, was investigated. Epitope tagging was used to monitor the intracellular localization to different cytoskeletal structures of the exogenously introduced constructs in adult rat cardiomyocytes (ABCs), which exhibit both stress fibers and regenerating myofibrils. LC-1f and LC-3f bind almost exclusively to the sarcomeric myosin heavy chain (MHC) with high affinity, while the LC-3nm interacts with stress fibers and sarcomeres equally well. Sorting appears to be directed by a hierarchical order of different affinities. Domain mapping by deletion and by construction of a LC-1f/3nm chimera suggests that the LCs are composed of three functionally distinct domains: a basal MHC binding site in the C-terminus; the central part, modulating the preferential interaction with MHC isoforms; and the isoprotein-specific N-terminus of the essential LC, which is probably not involved in the sorting process."
https://openalex.org/W1516994555,"SPARC, a Ca(2+)-binding glycoprotein that is expressed during tissue morphogenesis and functions as an inhibitor of cell spreading in vitro, was found to induce the secretion of an Mr = 45,000 protein in bovine aortic endothelial (BAE) cells. This protein was identified as type 1 plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) on Western blots with anti-PAI-1 antiserum. SPARC stimulated the secretion of PAI-1 protein into the medium of subconfluent BAE cells, but not confluent BAE cells, in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Secretion of PAI-1 into the culture medium was progressive and exhibited an increase of 3- to 7-fold over control values within 24 h after the addition of SPARC. Levels of PAI-1 mRNA were elevated 2-fold within 4 to 24 h after the addition of SPARC and did not increase with higher concentrations of SPARC. Since the induction of PAI-1 mRNA by SPARC was not blocked by cycloheximide, de novo protein synthesis was apparently not required for this stimulation. Control experiments showed that the induction of PAI-1 was not due to contamination of the SPARC preparations with endotoxin. These data demonstrate that SPARC induces the biosynthesis of PAI-1 in BAE cells and suggest a role for SPARC in the regulation of fibrinolysis and in the control of proteolytic events in remodeling tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1525724539,"Horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase occurs as isoenzymes: E is active on ethanol but not steroids; S is active on ethanol and steroids. The cDNAs for these isoenzymes were cloned; both were 1.8-kilobase long and contained complete coding sequences. Both enzymes were expressed in Escherichia coli, and the purified proteins had properties similar to those of the natural enzymes. The amino acid sequence deduced from the open reading frame of the E-type cDNA agreed with the amino acid sequence of the E isoenzyme determined by protein sequencing and x-ray crystallography. When compared with the E-type cDNA, the coding region of the S-type cDNA contains 24 substitutions and 3 deletions, giving rise to an amino acid sequence for the S. isoenzyme that differs from that of the E isoenzyme at 10 positions: nine conservative substitutions and one deletion, of Asp-115. These changes can be accommodated in the three-dimensional structure of the E isoenzyme, and models of the E and S isoenzymes complexed with a 3 beta-hydroxy-5 beta-steroid were built. The modeling shows that Leu-116 apparently sterically hinders binding of steroids in the E isoenzyme, and deletion in the S isoenzyme of Asp-115 moves Leu-116 and relieves the hindrance. The human gamma and rat liver enzymes are also active on steroids, but they have a different constellation of amino acid residues in the substrate pocket. Thus, there are multiple bases for the activity on steroids."

https://openalex.org/W1532546406,"Infection of cells with poliovirus results in a rapid inhibition of host RNA and protein synthesis. Concordant with this shutoff, the p220 subunit of the cap-binding protein complex is cleaved, probably indirectly, by the poliovirus proteinase p2A (2Apro). To elucidate the mechanism of action of 2Apro in inhibiting protein synthesis in vivo, we studied the effect of transient expression of 2Apro in COS-1 monkey kidney cells. In cells transfected with a 2Apro expression plasmid, p220 was cleaved and the 2Apro mRNA was reduced 30-fold compared to an identical plasmid containing a translation termination codon within the 2Apro coding region. The reduced expression from the 2Apro vector results from a 4-fold reduction in DNA replication and 22-fold reduction in transcription by RNA polymerase II from the adenovirus major late promoter/SV40 enhancer utilized in this vector. In contrast, no decrease in transcription of the adenovirus virus-associated I RNA gene by RNA polymerase III was observed. The effect of 2Apro expression on cap-dependent mRNA translation was studied by producing a dicistronic beta-globin mRNA harboring the encephalomyocarditis virus leader and 2Apro coding region within the 3' end of the mRNA to mediate cap-independent translation of 2Apro. Expression of this mRNA was also reduced 25-fold compared to an identical plasmid harboring a termination codon within the 2Apro coding region. Translation of the beta-globin marker gene from this mRNA was reduced 3-fold when corrected for mRNA level. These results suggest that p220 cleavage itself is not sufficient for complete inhibition of host translation and that an important effect of 2Apro expression on host protein synthesis is a reduction in RNA polymerase II transcription and to a lesser extent, DNA replication. This reduction could be a primary effect of 2Apro, or a secondary effect caused by the inhibition of translation."
https://openalex.org/W1634150728,"Macrophages and monocytes have essential roles in normal wound healing, in the immune response, and in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) stimulates the transcription of the early response gene, JE, and its human homolog, macrophage chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) in fibroblasts. JE/MCP-1 encodes a cytokine which is a member of a superfamily of small inducible genes that include platelet factor 4, beta-thromboglobulin, 310-C/NAP-1/IL-8, IP-10, KC/gro/MGSA, and others which may play important roles in the inflammatory and immune response. We now report that glucocorticoids inhibit the transcriptional induction of the JE gene by PDGF and serum in a dose-dependent manner. The glucocorticoid response followed the expected anti-inflammatory rank order of potency and was not due to a shift in the time course of induction. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents were ineffective in reducing JE mRNA levels. Dexamethasone inhibited the accumulation of JE transcripts induced by PDGF, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, and double-stranded synthetic RNA. Nuclear runoff assays demonstrated that the negative regulation occurred by decreasing the transcriptional induction of the JE gene. No effects on JE message stability could be detected in the presence of dexamethasone. The protein synthesis inhibitors cycloheximide and puromycin reversed the glucocorticoid-mediated inhibition and suggested that new protein synthesis was necessary. These results suggest that the transcriptional inhibition of glucocorticoids is mediated by the expression of a labile transcriptional repressor for the JE gene."
https://openalex.org/W1607719530,"The C-terminal catalytic domain (residues 704-1047) of the human ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP) has been engineered so as to incorporate the tripeptide, Glu-Glu-Phe, at its C terminus. This motif is recognized by the commercially available YL1/2 monoclonal antibody to alpha-tubulin and has previously been used for the immunoaffinity purification of HIV enzymes engineered to contain this epitope (Stammers, D. K., Tisdale, M., Court, S., Parmar, V., Bradley, C., and Ross, C. K. (1991) FEBS Lett. 283, 298-302). The engineered GAP catalytic domain (GAP-344) was obtained in high yield and purity from Escherichia coli extracts by means of a single affinity column of immobilized YL1/2, eluted under mild conditions with the dipeptide, Asp-Phe. The protein had similar activity to that previously described for full-length GAP, suggesting that the addition of the epitope did not grossly affect the activity. R903K and L902I mutants of GAP-344 were constructed, and the immunoaffinity purification procedure allowed their rapid characterization. The R903K mutant had less than 3% the activity of the normal protein, whereas the L902I substitution had less than 0.5% of normal activity, suggesting an important role for Leu-902 and Arg-903, residues absolutely conserved among GAP-related proteins. This work exemplifies the general utility of the C-terminal Glu-Glu-Phe motif for the rapid purification of proteins whose function is not altered by C-terminal modification."
https://openalex.org/W1827795204,"In order to assess the effect of increased cAMP degradation on the responsiveness on an endocrine cell, we have obtained stable transfectants of MA-10 Leydig tumor cells that overexpress a mammalian cAMP-phosphodiesterase. Two novel cell lines, designated MA-10(P+8) and MA-10(P+29), that express high levels of the transfected enzyme were characterized. Although the basal levels of cAMP in the mutant cell lines are comparable to those of the wild-type cells, the increase in cAMP accumulation elicited by human choriogonadotropin (hCG) is severely blunted. Further studies with MA-10(P+29) show that the ability of hCG to stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity is normal. The failure of MA-10(P+29) cells to accumulate cAMP in response to hCG can be correlated with a similar reduction in hCG-stimulated steroidogenesis. On the other hand, the maximal steroidogenic response of MA-10(P+29) cells to dibutyryl cAMP, a cAMP analogue that is fairly resistant to phosphodiesterase degradation, is normal. We also show that the ability of these cells to respond to hCG with increased cAMP accumulation and steroid synthesis can be restored with a specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor. These results demonstrate that overexpression of a cAMP-phosphodiesterase in MA-10 cells limits the levels of cAMP attained under hCG stimulation and supresses the steroidogenic response of these cells to hCG. Since gonadotropins increase the cAMP-phosphodiesterase activity in their target cells, these findings also provide evidence that this regulation plays a major role in the modulation of cell responsiveness. Last, these new cell lines should be valuable in the study of the actions of cAMP because they express a conditional and reversible cAMP-resistant phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W1647784204,"Casein kinase II consists of catalytic (alpha) and regulatory (beta) subunits complexed into a heterotetrameric alpha 2 beta 2 structure. Full-length cDNAs encoding the alpha and beta subunits of human casein kinase II were subcloned into an expression vector containing the cytomegalovirus promotor, yielding the expression constructs pCMV-alpha and pCMV-beta. Northern analyses of total cellular RNA prepared from COS-1 fibroblasts 65 h after transfection with pCMV-alpha or pCMV-beta or with both expression constructs showed marked specific increases in corresponding alpha and beta subunit RNAs. Immunoblot analysis utilizing anti-casein kinase II antiserum of cytosolic extracts prepared from COS-1 cells co-transfected with pCMV-alpha and pCMV-beta showed 2- and 4-fold increases in immunoreactive alpha and beta subunit protein, respectively, relative to vector-transfected cells. These same cytosolic fractions exhibited an average 5-fold increase in casein kinase II catalytic activity. COS-1 cells transfected with pCMV-alpha alone exhibited a 3-fold increase in immunoreactive alpha subunit protein and a nearly 2-fold increase in cytosolic casein kinase II catalytic activity. Transfection with the cDNA coding for the noncatalytic beta subunit alone also caused a near doubling of cytosolic casein kinase II catalytic activity. No increase in immunoreactive alpha subunit protein was observed in pCMV-beta-transfected cells, and no increase in immunoreactive beta subunit protein was observed in pCMV-alpha-transfected cells. These results indicate that a portion of the endogenous cellular casein kinase II protein is not fully active and that raising the concentration of the alpha or beta subunit stimulates this latent activity."
https://openalex.org/W1581989954,"A system for the expression of recombinant human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) reverse transcriptase (RT) in Escherichia coli has been developed, which allows purification of the heterodimeric form of the enzyme as well as the separate purification of the two subunits. It is shown that equilibrium formation between monomeric and homodimeric forms of the recombinant 66- and 51-kDa subunits is considerably more rapid than in the case of the corresponding homodimeric forms of HIV-1 RT. In accordance with our previously published studies on HIV-1 RT (Restle, T., Muller, B., and Goody, R.S. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 8986-8988) RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity of the HIV-2 RT preparations can be exactly correlated to their dimer content. No significant heterodimer formation can be observed upon coexpression of the 66-kDa subunit of HIV-2 RT with the 51-kDa subunit of HIV-1 RT in the same cell, indicating differences in the dimerization domains of the two proteins. Recombinant HIV-2 RT is not recognized by a set of 23 monoclonal antibodies raised against HIV-1 RT, although it shows weak cross-reactivity with sera from HIV-1-infected patients."
https://openalex.org/W1492629508,"We examined the kinetic interaction of purified recombinant DNA-derived human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase with R82150, a member of the tetrahydroimidazo[4,5,1-jk]-[1,4]-benzodiazepin-2(1H)-thione family of compounds (Pauwels, R., Andries, K., Desmyter, J., Schols, D., Kukla, M.J., Breslin, H.J., Raeymaeckers, A., Van Gelder, J., Woestenborghs, R., Heykants, J., Schellekens, K., Janssen, M.A.C., De Clercq, E., and Janssen, P.A.J. (1990) Nature 343, 470-474). R82150 inhibited noncompetitively the utilization of homopolymeric and heteropolymeric template-primers (KI range 280-300 nM). Inhibition of dNTP substrate incorporation was also noncompetitive (KI range 100-890 nM). In contrast, 100 microM R82150 did not inhibit human DNA polymerases alpha, beta, or gamma. Gel electrophoresis was used to analyze the effect of inhibitors on extension of heteropolymeric template-primers by HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. ddCTP induced accumulation of partially extended primers which had been terminated at sites requiring incorporation of deoxycytidylate. Competing template-primers reduced accumulation of both fully and partially extended primers. In contrast, R82150 induced accumulation of shortened primers that were terminated at various sites that did not correspond to any one particular deoxynucleotide species. Our results suggest that R82150 does not interact with HIV-1 reverse transcriptase as an analog of either template-primer or deoxynucleoside triphosphate substrate, but may bind allosterically at a site unique to this replicase."
https://openalex.org/W1515535764,"We have developed a system for analysis of discrete steps in vaccinia virus early mRNA synthesis during a single round of transcription in vitro. A synthetic early promoter is used to direct transcription by vaccinia RNA polymerase of a G-less cassette in linear duplex DNA. Omission of GTP from transcription reactions leads to the formation of ternary elongation complexes paused stably at the end of the G-less cassette. These complexes can be induced to elongate by provision of GTP. While initiation of transcription is sensitive to low concentrations of salt and Sarkosyl, elongation is relatively resistant to these agents. Termination can be studied in a single synthetic cycle by forming transcription complexes paused just proximal to the termination signal TTTTTNT that can subsequently elongate and terminate. By selectively incorporating the termination-inhibiting analog BrUMP into proximal and distal portions of the nascent transcript, we localize the termination signal within or near the sequence UUUUUNU in the nascent RNA. We show that access of the vaccinia termination factor (VTF/capping enzyme) to the transcriptional apparatus can occur subsequent to initiation and synthesis of a 390-nucleotide nascent RNA. Termination is more sensitive to inhibition by salt and Sarkosyl than in elongation. This sensitivity is not reversed by preincubation of VTF with the transcription complex. Finally, we confirm the identity of VTF and vaccinia mRNA capping enzyme by demonstration of VTF activity associated with capping enzyme expressed in Escherichia coli."
https://openalex.org/W2108124051,"We have cloned a cDNA (RMK2) coding for a Shaker type delayed rectifier K+ channel from a rat skeletal muscle cDNA library. The clone encodes a putative protein of 602 amino acids, identical with a rat brain K+ channel Kv1 (Swanson, R., Marshall, R., Smith, J. S., Williams, J. B., Boyle, M. B., Folander, K., Luneau, C. J., Antanavage, J., Oliva, C., Burhow, S. A., Bennet, C., Stein, R. B., and Kaczmarek, L. K. (1990) Neuron 4, 929-939). Northern blot analysis showed that RMK2 is expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle. RNase protection analysis showed that the 3'-noncoding regions of the brain, cardiac, and skeletal muscle RMK2 transcripts are identical. Cloning of the gene confirmed that the protein is encoded by a single exon (Swanson et al. (1990) Neuron 4, 929-939). We expressed RMK2 in Xenopus oocytes and showed that it encodes noninactivating delayed rectifier K+ channels, resistant to block by external tetraethylammonium, with a small unitary conductance of 8.0 picosiemens. Coinjection of RMK2 and RCK1 (RMK1) (Baumann, A., Grupe, A., Ackermann, A., and Pongs, O. (1988) EMBO J. 7, 2457-2463; Koren, G., Liman, E. R., Logothetis, D. E., Nadal-Ginard, B., and Hess, P. (1990) Neuron 4, 39-51) into Xenopus oocytes resulted in the expression of currents that have tetraethylammonium inhibition curves that differ from the linear combination of inhibition curves of the two types expressed individually. Thus, RMK2 and RCK1 (RMK1) can form heteromultimers. RNA blot hybridization analysis revealed that the RMK2 transcript is developmentally regulated in a different manner in the rat skeletal muscle, ventricle, and atrium."
https://openalex.org/W1499904641,"Poly(rA).oligo(dT)n binding to human immunodeficiency virus type-1 reverse transcriptase heterodimer (p66-p51) was primer length-dependent. The estimated Kd for (n = 10-14) was 20-30 nM and for (n = 16-20) was 0.11-0.14 nM. Gel electrophoretic analysis of the patterns of primer extension was consistent with an abrupt change in the Kd between a primer length of 14 and 16 nucleotides. Further, the rate constant for dissociation of the reverse transcriptase-template-primer complex was determined from steady state kinetics and enzyme-template-primer trapping experiments to be independent of primer length. Thus, the abrupt change in Kd was most likely due to a change in the rate constant for formation of the reverse transcriptase-template-primer complex. A similar shift in the Kd for template-primer binding was observed with poly(dA).oligo(dT)n. Reverse transcriptase homodimer (p66) catalyzed the incorporation of dTMP into poly(rA).oligo(dT)n with the same primer length dependence observed for the heterodimer. In contrast, binding of the p51 homodimer to poly(rA).oligo(dT)n was independent of primer length. Thus, the RNase H domain may contribute to reverse transcriptase heterodimer or p66 homodimer binding to template-primers in which the primer length is greater than 14 nucleotides."
https://openalex.org/W1515804886,"The contribution of intracellular calcium to ventricular fibrillation (VF) was investigated using chronically instrumented dogs with healed myocardial infarctions. A 2-minute coronary occlusion was initiated during the last minute of exercise. Fourteen animals developed ventricular fibrillation (susceptible) whereas the remaining 12 did not (resistant) during this exercise plus ischemia test. The test was then repeated for the susceptible animals after pretreatment with the intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA-AM (1.0 mg/kg). BAPTA-AM significantly reduced left ventricular dp/dt max and prevented VF in 8 of 12 susceptible animals. Conversely, myocardial cytosolic calcium levels were increased in resistant animals using the calcium channel agonist Bay K 8644 (30 micrograms/kg) or phenylephrine (10 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 3-5 min before occlusion). Bay K 8644 induced VF in all 5 resistant animals tested whereas phenylephrine induced VF in 8 of 12 resistant animals. BAPTA-AM pretreatment attenuated the hemodynamic effects of Bay K 8644 or phenylephrine and prevented VF in five of five Bay K 8644- and four of seven phenylephrine-treated animals. Finally, the endogenous level of calcium/calmodulin (Ca-CaM)-dependent phosphorylation of 170- and 55-kDa substrate proteins was measured (as an index of intracellular free calcium concentration). In the susceptible dog heart, the endogenous level of Ca-CaM-dependent phosphorylation was estimated to be two- to threefold higher than that observed in resistant dog heart. Treatment of resistant dog tissue with the calcium ionophore A23187 increased the level of Ca-CaM-dependent phosphorylation of these two proteins to the level observed in susceptible dog heart. These data suggest that elevated cytosolic calcium facilitates development of malignant arrhythmias and that elevated cytosolic calcium levels may be present in animals particularly susceptible to ventricular fibrillation."
https://openalex.org/W1489377561,"We have examined the properties of reverse transcriptases (RTs) required for strand transfer synthesis on poly(rA). In this process, a primer is elongated on one template and then switches to other templates for additional elongation until it is much longer than the templates on which it was made. Models of retrovirus replication require the RT to catalyze two distinct strand transfers. Additionally, they propose that the RT ribonuclease H (RNase H) activity is involved in both transfers. RTs from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), avian myeloblastosis virus, and murine leukemia virus differ in molecular mass and subunit composition. However, they all catalyzed strand transfer synthesis on (rA)300, generating characteristically long products. An RNase H-deficient enzyme, HIV-RTRD, catalyzed strand transfer synthesis to the same degree as native HIV-RT, indicating that a functional RNase H activity is not required. Additionally, N-ethylmaleimide, which inhibits RNase H but not polymerase activity of HIV-RT, did not diminish strand transfer synthesis. Highly processive DNA synthesis by each RT was found to be required for the strand transfer reaction. RNase H- murine leukemic virus RT has a structural modification that not only eradicates RNase H, but also makes the polymerase much less processive for DNA synthesis. However, conditions that allow this modified enzyme to bind repeatedly to the same primer during synthesis, i.e. conditions that simulate higher processivity, allow strand transfer synthesis. Catalysis of strand transfer synthesis is not a property of all DNA polymerases, since the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I is unable to catalyze this reaction even if high processivity is simulated. These results suggest that strand transfer synthesis relies on an unidentified functional activity present in RTs."
https://openalex.org/W1599142802,"The RNase H domain of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase was released from recombinant DHFR-RNase H fusion protein by the action of HIV-1 protease and crystallized as large trigonal prisms that diffract x-rays to at least 2.4-A resolution. The protease cleavage occurred 18 residues away from the Phe440-Tyr441 site reported to be processed during maturation of the reverse transcriptase heterodimer. Mutagenesis of the protease-sensitive region (residues 430-440), which is part of the crystallized domain, indicates that any alteration of the wild-type sequence results in increased proteolysis of the p66 subunit. A model of asymmetric processing in HIV-1 reserve transcriptase which involves partial unfolding of the RNase H domain is proposed based on these results and the recently reported three-dimensional structure of this domain."
https://openalex.org/W1523393080,"The epidermal growth factor (EGF) binding sites on bovine luteal cell membrane have been characterized in detail, and evidence has been obtained for a direct stimulatory effect of EGF on membrane-associated adenylate cyclase activity. The membrane fraction prepared showed the presence of high affinity (Ka = 1.2 +/- 0.7 x 10(-11) M-1), specific, and saturable EGF receptors of Mr = 170,000. The EGF receptors underwent rapid autophosphorylation and down-regulation following treatment of the cells with EGF. Treatment of the cells with 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate resulted in a diminished binding of 125I-EGF to the receptors. When luteal cells were preincubated with EGF, both basal and forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was increased severalfold. This enhancement of the adenylate cyclase activity was dependent upon the duration of the exposure to EGF and on the concentration of the growth factor. An optimal enhancement was observed when the cells were preincubated with 10 ng/ml EGF for 10-15 min. Furthermore, when the membrane fraction prepared from luteal cells was preincubated in vitro with EGF, a similar dose-related and time-dependent increase in basal, as well as forskolin-stimulated, adenylate cyclase activity was observed. These results demonstrate that luteal cell adenylate cyclase activity is finely regulated by EGF. Such a direct interaction between EGF and membrane-associated adenylate cyclase has not been previously recognized."

Surface AChRs on AM4 cells contain all four subunits, sediment as a single approximately 9 S peak on sucrose gradients, and have the same ratio of alpha- to beta-subunits as surface AChRs from mouse BC3H-1 cells. The surface AChRs exhibit pharmacological properties identical to those obtained for BC3H-1 cells, including the association and dissociation rates of alpha-bungarotoxin, a low affinity and cooperative instantaneous dose-response curve, cooperative steady state agonist binding and desensitization, cooperative enhancement of agonist binding affinity by local anesthetics, and distinct affinities for curariform antagonists. Patch clamp measurements on AM4 cells reveal AChR single channel properties identical to those obtained from BC3H-1 cells, including a single class of channels with a conductance of 56 pS, short and long duration openings at low and high agonist concentrations, brief and intermediate closed duration components at low agonist concentrations, and six distinct closed duration components at high agonist concentrations. The biochemical, pharmacological, and single channel measurements indicate at least 95% of the surface AChRs on AM4 cells are alpha 2 beta gamma delta pentamers."
https://openalex.org/W1726395610,"Activated p21ras alters the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signal transduction pathway in fibroblasts by inhibiting autophosphorylation of the receptor as well as by inhibiting the induction of the growth-related genes c-myc, c-fos, and JE. To elucidate the cause and effect relationships between receptor autophosphorylation and other second messenger events in the PDGF signaling pathway we created revertants of v-ras transformed cells by two methods: 1) the use of cAMP analogues, and 2) the introduction of a gene, Krev-1, which has been reported previously to revert ras transformed cells to normal morphology. Analysis of the revertants shows that the PDGF-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of the 180-kDa PDGF receptor remains inhibited; however, the PDGF-mediated activation of phospholipase C and the induction of the growth-related genes c-myc, c-fos, and JE have been restored. These data suggest the presence of parallel pathways for PDGF signal transduction which are not dependent on autophosphorylation of the PDGF receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1961865294,"Bovine corneal keratan sulfate proteoglycan (KSPG) contains two core proteins, 37 and 25 kDa, if fully deglycosylated, but 47 and 35 kDa, respectively, after endo-beta-galactosidase (Funderburgh, J. L., and Conrad, G. W. (1990) J. Biol Chem. 265, 8297-8303). Chicken corneal KSPG released a single core protein of 47 kDa after endo-beta-galactosidase, and of 35 and 36 kDa, if deglycosylated with N-glycanase or trifluoromethanesulfonic acid. Affinity purified rabbit antibodies against each KSPG recognized only the intact proteoglycan or its core proteins in immunoblots of unfractionated guanidine-HCl extracts of whole cornea after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Affinity purified antibody to a synthetic peptide duplicating the NH2-terminal sequence of the 37-kDa bovine core protein showed little reactivity with untreated corneal extract but reacted with the 47-kDa bovine protein in endo-beta-galactosidase-treated extracts. RNA was isolated from bovine and chick corneal stromas and used for in vitro translation. Antibody against bovine KSPG immunoprecipitated two proteins of 56-53 kDa and a protein of 41 kDa after translation of bovine RNA. Translation of chick RNA produced a double band of 38-39 kDa and a single band of 25 kDa precipitating with antibody against chicken KSPG. Homologous unlabeled KSPG competed for binding of antibodies to these translation products. These data suggest that in vertebrate corneas, the multiple KSPG core protein isoforms may arise as products of separate mRNAs, rather than from proteolytic processing of a large polypeptide precursor."
https://openalex.org/W1534090932,"Abstract An antibody raised against a synthetic cholecystokinin (CCK) analog, (1-27)-(CCK)-33, corresponding to the midregion of CCK-58, detected immunoreactivity in intestinal extracts which eluted between the positions of CCK-33/39 and CCK-58 on high performance liquid chromatography. This peak, lacking carboxyl-terminal cholecystokinin immunoreactivity, was purified by reverse phase and cation-exchange chromatographies. Amino acid, mass spectral, and microsequence analysis established that it was the amino-terminal desnonapeptide fragment of cholecystokinin-58, (1-49)-CCK-58. It was demonstrated further that CCK-58 has less biological activity than CCK-8, suggesting that the amino terminus either sterically hindered the ability of CCK-58 to exert its biological activity or that its amino terminus acted at another site to inhibit release of amylase from rat pancreatic acini. The desnonapeptide of CCK-58 by itself had no biological activity, nor did it affect CCK-8-stimulated amylase release from isolated rat pancreatic acini, suggesting that the amino terminus shields the carboxyl terminus from expressing its biological activity. Its presence in intestine suggests that it is released into the circulation where it could be detected by midregion antibodies. The presence of high proportions of (1-49)-CCK-58 indicates that most CCK-8 is directly derived from CCK-58. Its occurrence in brain and intestine indicates similar processing for procholecystokinin in both tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1495340688,"A panel of mouse monoclonal anti-CD4 antibodies was characterized in terms of idiotypic expression by using specific anti-idiotypic antibody (anti-Id) reagents generated in rabbits immunized with anti-Leu3a, a monoclonal anti-CD4 which inhibits the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) gp120 binding to CD4. Direct binding and competitive inhibition assays demonstrate that the majority of monoclonal anti-CD4 antibodies able to recognize CD4 epitopes overlapping the epitope recognized by anti-Leu3a expressed an antigen-combining site-related cross-reactive idiotype (IdX). Western blot analysis was used to demonstrate that this IdX is associated primarily with the light (L) chain of the monoclonal anti-CD4 antibodies. To further characterize the structural basis of the IdX, the nucleotide sequence of the variable region of the L kappa chain of anti-Leu3a was determined. Peptides corresponding to the first, second, and third complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of the L chain of anti-Leu3a were synthesized and used to immunize rabbits. All anti-peptide antisera recognized the immunizing peptide, the cognate anti-Leu3a molecule, and several other monoclonal anti-CD4 antibodies by direct binding assays. Western blot analysis utilizing the anti-CDR peptide reagents demonstrates that the reactivity to the monoclonal anti-CD4 antibodies was L chain-specific. The anti-Id generated by immunizing with the intact anti-Leu3a molecule failed to recognize the three L chain-derived CDR synthetic peptides, suggesting that the IdX requires the presence of the three-dimensional configuration of the L chain for its expression. The broad range of reactivity exhibited by the antipeptide antisera indicates that the majority of mouse monoclonal anti-CD4 antibodies characterized in this study utilize L chains encoded by a single germ line variable (V) region kappa (V kappa) chain gene or by V kappa genes that belong to the same gene family."

https://openalex.org/W1655296715,"Structural changes upon binding to the membrane of a COOH-terminal channel-forming thermolytic fragment of colicin E1 have been studied by means of a variety of spectroscopic techniques. Circular dichroism measurements show that the thermolytic fragment predominantly takes a helical structure in aqueous and detergent solutions. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic measurements indicate that the content of the beta-structure is significantly increased when the thermolytic fragment is bound to vesicles. On the basis of the result of tryptophan fluorescence measurements, we have concluded that each of the three tryptophan residues of the thermolytic fragment exists in different environments, i.e. one is buried in the lipid bilayer, one exists on the cis side of the vesicles, and one exists near the surface of the lipid bilayer. The Fourier transform infrared and fluorescence data have been used along with the crystal structure of colicin A, which is highly homologous to colicin E1 in structure and function, to propose a model of the thermolytic fragment bound to the lipid vesicles."

https://openalex.org/W1494079597,"Myxobacteria and a variety of strains of Escherichia coli contain an unusual extrachromosomal element, a small single-stranded branched copolymer of DNA and RNA (msDNA). Interest in msDNA stems from the presence of a 2'-5' linkage between its DNA and RNA moieties and the possible involvement of reverse transcriptase in its synthesis. Two groups have proposed a model for the synthesis of msDNA that involves the following sequence of events: 1) synthesis of an RNA precursor; 2) addition of a dNTP in a 2'-5' linkage to the RNA precursor (branch priming); 3) synthesis by reverse transcriptase of complementary DNA on the primed RNA precursor; 4) concomitant processing of the RNA precursor by RNase H; and 5) further processing of the RNA precursor by RNase H; and 5) further processing of the branched polymer. The branch priming hypothesis (step 2) was originally based on pulse-chase experiments using a lengthy pulse of 30-min duration. Our experiments with shorter pulse durations demonstrate a variety of intermediate forms not predicted by this model. Specifically, we find that early in synthesis, intermediate msDNA forms appear that are apparently not branch-linked to corresponding RNA moieties. The concomitant RNase H hypothesis (step 4) was based in part on intermediate trapping experiments using dideoxy NTPs to interrupt msDNA synthesis. These experiments showed an apparent complementary relationship between DNA length and RNA length in the trapped forms. In contrast, our experiments show that DNA elongation and RNA processing follow different kinetics. These results suggest an alternate model for synthesis of msDNA in which a conventionally primed DNA moiety is joined with the RNA moiety in a branch ligation event taking place several minutes after the synthesis of both moieties."
