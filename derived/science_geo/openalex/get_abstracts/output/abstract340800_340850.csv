https://openalex.org/W2025150368,"A rapid replication of mitochondria (20- to 40-fold increase) occurs between the precallose and tetrad stages in the tapetum of N and T corn (Zea mays) anthers, followed by mitochondrial, tapetal, and pollen breakdown in T anthers. It is suggested that the altered DNA in T mitochondria may malfunction under these stress conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2038109074,"The metal americium becomes superconducting at temperatures as high as 0.79 K for the room temperature, double-hexagonal-close-packed phase. We also have evidence of a slightly higher transition temperature for the face-centered-cubic phase. This discovery of superconductivity in the midst of nonsuperconducting manmade elements is somewhat surprising."
https://openalex.org/W2066887099,"Phosphatic dermal fragments of Anatolepis, interpreted as a heterostracan fish (class Agnatha), have been discovered in the Deadwood Formation of Late Cambrian age in northeastern Wyoming. This discovery extends back the age of the earliest known vertebrate fossils by approximately 40 million years. Other occurrences of Anatolepis in North America, Greenland, and Spitzbergen show that these fish had a widespread geographic distribution in Late Cambrian and Early Ordovician marine environments."
https://openalex.org/W2054015857,"Oceanic crustal drilling by R. V. Glomar Challenger at 15 sites in the North Atlantic has led to a complex picture of the upper half kilometer of the crust. Elements of the picture include the absence of the source for linear magnetic anomalies, marked episodicity of volcanic activity, ubiquitous low temperature alteration and evidence for large scale tectonic disturbance. Comparison sections in the Pacific and much deeper crustal drilling are needed to attack problems arising from the North Atlantic results."
https://openalex.org/W1969460461,"The formation of single crystals of highly conducting inorganic complexes, for example, K(2)Pt(CN)(4)X(0.3) . 3H(2)O (X = Cl, Br), K(1.75)Pt(CN)(4) . 1.5 H(2)O, or K(1.64)Pt(O(2)C(2)O(2)) . 2H(2)O, has been effected via electrochemical growth from concentrated aqueous solutions of potassium tetracyanoplatinate(II) and potassium bis(oxalato)platinate(II)."
https://openalex.org/W2007075308,"Analyses of suspended particulate matter from the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean have defined a 400-meter-thick benthic nepheloid layer enriched in aluminum, silicon, iron, and manganese relative to the overlying waters. Chemical mass-balance calculations suggest that the concentration increases in the benthic nepheloid layer are due to resuspension from the fraction of the local bottom sediments in the size range ≤1 micrometer."
https://openalex.org/W1983867633,"A discussion demonstrates several deficiencies in a recent paper by H. Inhaber which was based on an earlier report. According to Inhaber, he considered sulfur dioxide emissions that fall within the New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) in force at the time AECB 1119 was written. but the upper limit of the number of deaths from sulfur dioxide-related disease, which is used in the risk calculations, corresponds not to these emissions but to emissions five times higher, exceeding the NSPS by a factor of 3.3. The net inflation of public man-days lost from the coal fuel cycle is a multiplicative factor of 1.3 compared with what would be obtained by consistent use of the NSPS. According to Inhaber, it requires twice as much materials and labor to build a methanol plant as to build an oil refinery. However, methanol-from-biomass plants require fewer and less complicated operations than oil refineries and would probably require less construction material and labor, not more. Several other examples are discussed. 10 references."
