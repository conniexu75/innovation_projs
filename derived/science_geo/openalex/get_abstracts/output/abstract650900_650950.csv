https://openalex.org/W3015964336,"Global insights into cellular organization and genome function require comprehensive understanding of the interactome networks that mediate genotype–phenotype relationships1,2. Here we present a human ‘all-by-all’ reference interactome map of human binary protein interactions, or ‘HuRI’. With approximately 53,000 protein–protein interactions, HuRI has approximately four times as many such interactions as there are high-quality curated interactions from small-scale studies. The integration of HuRI with genome3, transcriptome4 and proteome5 data enables cellular function to be studied within most physiological or pathological cellular contexts. We demonstrate the utility of HuRI in identifying the specific subcellular roles of protein–protein interactions. Inferred tissue-specific networks reveal general principles for the formation of cellular context-specific functions and elucidate potential molecular mechanisms that might underlie tissue-specific phenotypes of Mendelian diseases. HuRI is a systematic proteome-wide reference that links genomic variation to phenotypic outcomes. A human binary protein interactome map that includes around 53,000 protein–protein interactions involving more than 8,000 proteins provides a reference for the study of human cellular function in health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W3017101807,"The new type of pneumonia caused by the SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) has been declared as a global public health concern by WHO. As of April 3, 2020, more than 1,000,000 human infections have been diagnosed around the world, which exhibited apparent person-to-person transmission characteristics of this virus. The capacity of vertical transmission in SARS-CoV-2 remains controversial recently. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is now confirmed as the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and plays essential roles in human infection and transmission. In present study, we collected the online available single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to evaluate the cell specific expression of ACE2 in maternal-fetal interface as well as in multiple fetal organs. Our results revealed that ACE2 was highly expressed in maternal-fetal interface cells including stromal cells and perivascular cells of decidua, and cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast in placenta. Meanwhile, ACE2 was also expressed in specific cell types of human fetal heart, liver and lung, but not in kidney. And in a study containing series fetal and post-natal mouse lung, we observed ACE2 was dynamically changed over the time, and ACE2 was extremely high in neonatal mice at post-natal day 1~3. In summary, this study revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 receptor was widely spread in specific cell types of maternal-fetal interface and fetal organs. And thus, both the vertical transmission and the placenta dysfunction/abortion caused by SARS-CoV-2 need to be further carefully investigated in clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W3016443946,"Halide perovskite materials have promising performance characteristics for low-cost optoelectronic applications. Photovoltaic devices fabricated from perovskite absorbers have reached power conversion efficiencies above 25 per cent in single-junction devices and 28 per cent in tandem devices1,2. This strong performance (albeit below the practical limits of about 30 per cent and 35 per cent, respectively3) is surprising in thin films processed from solution at low-temperature, a method that generally produces abundant crystalline defects4. Although point defects often induce only shallow electronic states in the perovskite bandgap that do not affect performance5, perovskite devices still have many states deep within the bandgap that trap charge carriers and cause them to recombine non-radiatively. These deep trap states thus induce local variations in photoluminescence and limit the device performance6. The origin and distribution of these trap states are unknown, but they have been associated with light-induced halide segregation in mixed-halide perovskite compositions7 and with local strain8, both of which make devices less stable9. Here we use photoemission electron microscopy to image the trap distribution in state-of-the-art halide perovskite films. Instead of a relatively uniform distribution within regions of poor photoluminescence efficiency, we observe discrete, nanoscale trap clusters. By correlating microscopy measurements with scanning electron analytical techniques, we find that these trap clusters appear at the interfaces between crystallographically and compositionally distinct entities. Finally, by generating time-resolved photoemission sequences of the photo-excited carrier trapping process10,11, we reveal a hole-trapping character with the kinetics limited by diffusion of holes to the local trap clusters. Our approach shows that managing structure and composition on the nanoscale will be essential for optimal performance of halide perovskite devices."
https://openalex.org/W3017278562,"Quantum computers are expected to outperform conventional computers for a range of important problems, from molecular simulation to search algorithms, once they can be scaled up to large numbers of quantum bits (qubits), typically millions. For most solid-state qubit technologies, e.g. those using superconducting circuits or semiconductor spins, scaling poses a significant challenge as every additional qubit increases the heat generated, while the cooling power of dilution refrigerators is severely limited at their operating temperature below 100 mK. Here we demonstrate operation of a scalable silicon quantum processor unit cell, comprising two qubits confined to quantum dots (QDs) at $\sim$1.5 Kelvin. We achieve this by isolating the QDs from the electron reservoir, initialising and reading the qubits solely via tunnelling of electrons between the two QDs. We coherently control the qubits using electrically-driven spin resonance (EDSR) in isotopically enriched silicon $^{28}$Si, attaining single-qubit gate fidelities of 98.6% and coherence time $T_2^*$ = 2$\mu$s during `hot' operation, comparable to those of spin qubits in natural silicon at millikelvin temperatures. Furthermore, we show that the unit cell can be operated at magnetic fields as low as 0.1 T, corresponding to a qubit control frequency of 3.5 GHz, where the qubit energy is well below the thermal energy. The unit cell constitutes the core building block of a full-scale silicon quantum computer, and satisfies layout constraints required by error correction architectures. Our work indicates that a spin-based quantum computer could be operated at elevated temperatures in a simple pumped $^4$He system, offering orders of magnitude higher cooling power than dilution refrigerators, potentially enabling classical control electronics to be integrated with the qubit array."
https://openalex.org/W3017136680,"Quantum computation requires many qubits that can be coherently controlled and coupled to each other. Qubits that are defined using lithographic techniques are often argued to be promising platforms for scalability, since they can be implemented using semiconductor fabrication technology. However, leading solid-state approaches function only at temperatures below 100 mK, where cooling power is extremely limited, and this severely impacts the perspective for practical quantum computation. Recent works on spins in silicon have shown steps towards a platform that can be operated at higher temperatures by demonstrating long spin lifetimes, gate-based spin readout, and coherent single-spin control, but the crucial two-qubit logic gate has been missing. Here we demonstrate that silicon quantum dots can have sufficient thermal robustness to enable the execution of a universal gate set above one Kelvin. We obtain single-qubit control via electron-spin-resonance (ESR) and readout using Pauli spin blockade. We show individual coherent control of two qubits and measure single-qubit fidelities up to 99.3 %. We demonstrate tunability of the exchange interaction between the two spins from 0.5 up to 18 MHz and use this to execute coherent two-qubit controlled rotations (CROT). The demonstration of `hot' and universal quantum logic in a semiconductor platform paves the way for quantum integrated circuits hosting the quantum hardware and their control circuitry all on the same chip, providing a scalable approach towards practical quantum information."
https://openalex.org/W3014737712,"Cancer genomics has revealed many genes and core molecular processes that contribute to human malignancies, but the genetic and molecular bases of many rare cancers remains unclear. Genetic predisposition accounts for 5 to 10% of cancer diagnoses in children1,2, and genetic events that cooperate with known somatic driver events are poorly understood. Pathogenic germline variants in established cancer predisposition genes have been recently identified in 5% of patients with the malignant brain tumour medulloblastoma3. Here, by analysing all protein-coding genes, we identify and replicate rare germline loss-of-function variants across ELP1 in 14% of paediatric patients with the medulloblastoma subgroup Sonic Hedgehog (MBSHH). ELP1 was the most common medulloblastoma predisposition gene and increased the prevalence of genetic predisposition to 40% among paediatric patients with MBSHH. Parent-offspring and pedigree analyses identified two families with a history of paediatric medulloblastoma. ELP1-associated medulloblastomas were restricted to the molecular SHHα subtype4 and characterized by universal biallelic inactivation of ELP1 owing to somatic loss of chromosome arm 9q. Most ELP1-associated medulloblastomas also exhibited somatic alterations in PTCH1, which suggests that germline ELP1 loss-of-function variants predispose individuals to tumour development in combination with constitutive activation of SHH signalling. ELP1 is the largest subunit of the evolutionarily conserved Elongator complex, which catalyses translational elongation through tRNA modifications at the wobble (U34) position5,6. Tumours from patients with ELP1-associated MBSHH were characterized by a destabilized Elongator complex, loss of Elongator-dependent tRNA modifications, codon-dependent translational reprogramming, and induction of the unfolded protein response, consistent with loss of protein homeostasis due to Elongator deficiency in model systems7-9. Thus, genetic predisposition to proteome instability may be a determinant in the pathogenesis of paediatric brain cancers. These results support investigation of the role of protein homeostasis in other cancer types and potential for therapeutic interference."

https://openalex.org/W3016862866,"The current Edisonian approach to discovery requires up to two decades of fundamental and applied research for materials technologies to reach the market. Such a slow and capital-intensive turnaround calls for disruptive strategies to expedite innovation. Self-driving laboratories have the potential to provide the means to revolutionize experimentation by empowering automation with artificial intelligence to enable autonomous discovery. However, the lack of adequate software solutions significantly impedes the development of self-driving laboratories. In this paper, we make progress towards addressing this challenge, and we propose and develop an implementation of ChemOS; a portable, modular and versatile software package which supplies the structured layers necessary for the deployment and operation of self-driving laboratories. ChemOS facilitates the integration of automated equipment, and it enables remote control of automated laboratories. ChemOS can operate at various degrees of autonomy; from fully unsupervised experimentation to actively including inputs and feedbacks from researchers into the experimentation loop. The flexibility of ChemOS provides a broad range of functionality as demonstrated on five applications, which were executed on different automated equipment, highlighting various aspects of the software package."
https://openalex.org/W3016458058,"Cultured meat, in particular beef, is an emerging food technology potentially challenged by issues of consumer acceptance. To understand drivers of consumer acceptance as well as sensory perception of cultured meat, we investigated the effect of information content on participants' acceptance of cultured meat in a tasting context. Hundred ninety-three citizens from the Netherlands participated, divided across three age and sex-matched groups which each received information on either societal benefits, personal benefits or information on the quality and taste of cultured meat. They filled out a questionnaire and tasted two pieces of hamburger, labeled 'conventional' or 'cultured', although both pieces were in fact conventional. Sensory analysis of both hamburgers was performed. We observed that provision of information and the tasting experience increased acceptance of cultured meat and that information on personal benefits of cultured meat increased acceptance more than information on quality and taste but not than societal benefits of cultured meat. Previous awareness of cultured meat was the best predictor of its acceptance. In contrast to previous studies, sex and social economic status were not associated with different acceptance rates. Surprisingly, 58% of the respondents were willing to pay a premium for cultured meat of, on average, 37% above the price of regular meat. All participants tasted the 'cultured' hamburger and evaluated its taste to be better than the conventional one in spite of the absence of an objective difference. This is the first acceptance study of cultured meat where participants were offered to eat and evaluate meat that was labeled 'cultured'. We conclude that having positive information importantly improves acceptance and willingness to taste and that the specific content of the information is of subordinate importance. Awareness of cultured meat is the best predictor of acceptance."
https://openalex.org/W3016552895,"Generating quantum entanglement in large systems on timescales much shorter than the coherence time is key to powerful quantum simulation and computation. Trapped ions are among the most accurately controlled and best isolated quantum systems1 with low-error entanglement gates operated within tens of microseconds using the vibrational motion of few-ion crystals2,3. To exceed the level of complexity tractable by classical computers the main challenge is to realize fast entanglement operations in crystals made up of many ions (large ion crystals)4. The strong dipole–dipole interactions in polar molecule5 and Rydberg atom6,7 systems allow much faster entangling gates, yet stable state-independent confinement comparable with trapped ions needs to be demonstrated in these systems8. Here we combine the benefits of these approaches: we report a two-ion entangling gate with 700-nanosecond gate time that uses the strong dipolar interaction between trapped Rydberg ions, which we use to produce a Bell state with 78 per cent fidelity. The sources of gate error are identified and a total error of less than 0.2 per cent is predicted for experimentally achievable parameters. Furthermore, we predict that residual coupling to motional modes contributes an approximate gate error of 10−4 in a large ion crystal of 100 ions. This provides a way to speed up and scale up trapped-ion quantum computers and simulators substantially. A quantum system combining the accuracy of trapped ions and the speed of Rydberg atoms is reported; the implemented fast gate is a step towards a scalable quantum computer."
https://openalex.org/W3016540808,"Nitrogen is the main constituent of the Earth's atmosphere, but its provenance in the Earth's mantle remains uncertain. The relative contribution of primordial nitrogen inherited during the Earth's accretion versus that subducted from the Earth's surface is unclear1-6. Here we show that the mantle may have retained remnants of such primordial nitrogen. We use the rare 15N15N isotopologue of N2 as a new tracer of air contamination in volcanic gas effusions. By constraining air contamination in gases from Iceland, Eifel (Germany) and Yellowstone (USA), we derive estimates of mantle δ15N (the fractional difference in 15N/14N from air), N2/36Ar and N2/3He. Our results show that negative δ15N values observed in gases, previously regarded as indicating a mantle origin for nitrogen7-10, in fact represent dominantly air-derived N2 that experienced 15N/14N fractionation in hydrothermal systems. Using two-component mixing models to correct for this effect, the 15N15N data allow extrapolations that characterize mantle endmember δ15N, N2/36Ar and N2/3He values. We show that the Eifel region has slightly increased δ15N and N2/36Ar values relative to estimates for the convective mantle provided by mid-ocean-ridge basalts11, consistent with subducted nitrogen being added to the mantle source. In contrast, we find that whereas the Yellowstone plume has δ15N values substantially greater than that of the convective mantle, resembling surface components12-15, its N2/36Ar and N2/3He ratios are indistinguishable from those of the convective mantle. This observation raises the possibility that the plume hosts a primordial component. We provide a test of the subduction hypothesis with a two-box model, describing the evolution of mantle and surface nitrogen through geological time. We show that the effect of subduction on the deep nitrogen cycle may be less important than has been suggested by previous investigations. We propose instead that high mid-ocean-ridge basalt and plume δ15N values may both be dominantly primordial features."
https://openalex.org/W3016486740,"Arterial hypotension during the early phase of anesthesia can lead to adverse outcomes such as a prolonged postoperative stay or even death. Predicting hypotension during anesthesia induction is complicated by its diverse causes. We investigated the feasibility of developing a machine-learning model to predict postinduction hypotension. Naïve Bayes, logistic regression, random forest, and artificial neural network models were trained to predict postinduction hypotension, occurring between tracheal intubation and incision, using data for the period from between the start of anesthesia induction and immediately before tracheal intubation obtained from an anesthesia monitor, a drug administration infusion pump, an anesthesia machine, and from patients’ demographics, together with preexisting disease information from electronic health records. Among 222 patients, 126 developed postinduction hypotension. The random-forest model showed the best performance, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.842 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.736-0.948). This was higher than that for the Naïve Bayes (0.778; 95% CI: 0.65-0.898), logistic regression (0.756; 95% CI: 0.630-0.881), and artificial-neural-network (0.760; 95% CI: 0.640-0.880) models. The most important features affecting the accuracy of machine-learning prediction were a patient’s lowest systolic blood pressure, lowest mean blood pressure, and mean systolic blood pressure before tracheal intubation. We found that machine-learning models using data obtained from various anesthesia machines between the start of anesthesia induction and immediately before tracheal intubation can predict hypotension occurring during the period between tracheal intubation and incision."
https://openalex.org/W3016297745,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal disease of unknown cause that is characterized by progressive fibrotic lung remodeling. An abnormal emergence of airway epithelial-like cells within the alveolar compartments of the lung, herein termed bronchiolization, is often observed in IPF. However, the origin of this dysfunctional distal lung epithelium remains unknown due to a lack of suitable human model systems. In this study, we established a human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived air-liquid interface (ALI) model of alveolar epithelial type II (ATII)-like cell differentiation that allows us to investigate alveolar epithelial progenitor cell differentiation in vitro. We treated this system with an IPF-relevant cocktail (IPF-RC) to mimic the pro-fibrotic cytokine milieu present in IPF lungs. Stimulation with IPF-RC during differentiation increases secretion of IPF biomarkers and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of these cultures reveals significant overlap with human IPF patient data. IPF-RC treatment further impairs ATII differentiation by driving a shift toward an airway epithelial-like expression signature, providing evidence that a pro-fibrotic cytokine environment can influence the proximo-distal differentiation pattern of human lung epithelial cells. In conclusion, we show for the first time, the establishment of a human model system that recapitulates aspects of IPF-associated bronchiolization of the lung epithelium in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W3017259908,"Background Musculoskeletal disorder (MSD) is currently recognized as one of the most common occupational injuries for which nursing personnel in the medical service industry have been identified as a high-risk group. In this study, we explore the prevalence of MSD in various body parts as well as their risk factors among hospital nurses. Methods A cross-sectional descriptive design with stratified cluster sampling was used to collect data from 1,803 nurses. The survey included a demographic questionnaire, and Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire. Results The results showed that the greatest prevalence of MSD symptoms by body regions were in the right shoulder (85.8%), the left shoulder (80.9%), the neck (62.4%), the right wrist (62.2%) and the lower back (60.4%). Risk factors for shoulder discomfort includes department type, exercise habits, and age (p < .05). Risk factors for neck discomfort includes seniority in the current unit, “job title, and “history of MDS (p < .05). Risk factors for upper back discomfort includes age and seniority in the current unit (p < .05). Risk factors for lower back discomfort including seniority in the current unit, department type, and number of days worked per week (p < .05). Conclusions The results of this study can serve as a reference for nursing administration managers and decision-makers for reducing musculoskeletal discomfort among nurses and thereby achieving superior quality in clinical care."
https://openalex.org/W3017105296,"Background Maternal depression is common among low-income women enrolled in home visiting programs, yet there is considerable variability in the extent to which it is identified and addressed. This study examines outcomes related to postpartum depression screening, receipt of evidence-based services, and reductions in depressive symptoms among clients of home visiting programs in the Health Resources and Services Administration’s Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program Home Visiting Collaborative Improvement and Innovation Network (HV CoIIN), the first U.S. national application of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement’s Breakthrough Series (BTS) Model in home visiting programs. Methods and findings Fourteen home visiting programs in eight states, serving a geographically and racially diverse caseload of pregnant women and new mothers, took part in the HV CoIIN. Women in participating home visiting programs received the intervention strategies implemented by their program during participation in the collaborative. HV CoIIN strategies included specific policies and protocols for depression screening and home visitor response to screening results; home visitor training and supervision; delivery of prevention and treatment interventions; and tracking systems for screening, referral, and follow-up. HV CoIIN’s proposed primary outcome was that 85% of women who accessed evidence-based services would experience a 25% reduction in depressive symptoms three months after accessing services. Secondary outcomes included an increased percentage of women who were screened for depression within three months of enrollment or birth, who verbally accepted a referral to evidence-based services, and who received one or more evidence-based service contacts. HV CoIIN resulted in improved symptoms among women who accessed services, from 51.1% to 59.9%. HV CoIIN also improved the percent of women screened for depression, from 83.6% to 96.3%, and those with positive depression screens who accessed evidence-based services, from 41.6% to 65.5%. Home visiting programs in this study were early adopters of quality improvement activities, which may limit the generalizability of these results to other home visiting programs. Conclusions Home visiting programs can play an important role in closing gaps in maternal depression identification, referrals, service access, and symptom alleviation. Continuous quality improvement and BTS collaborative methods can be used to improve home visiting services in ways that advance national public health priorities and improve population health outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3017307011,"The high toxicity of cadmium (Cd) and its ready uptake by plants has become a major agricultural problem. To investigate the genetic architecture and genetic regulation of Cd tolerance in barley, we conducted quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis in the phenotypically polymorphic Oregon Wolfe Barley (OWB) mapping population, derived from a cross between Rec and Dom parental genotypes. Through evaluating the Cd tolerance of 87 available doubled haploid lines of the OWB mapping population at the seedling stage, one minor and one major QTL were detected on chromosomes 2H and 6H, respectively. For chlorosis and necrosis traits, the major QTL explained 47.24% and 38.59% of the phenotypic variance, respectively. RNA-Seq analysis of the parental seedlings under Cd treatment revealed 542 differentially expressed genes between Cd-tolerant Rec and Cd-susceptible Dom genotypes. By analyzing sequence variations in transcribed sequences of the parental genotypes, 155,654 SNPs and 1,525 InDels were identified between the two contrasting genotypes and may contribute to Cd tolerance. Finally, by integrating the data from the identified QTLs and RNA-Seq analysis, 16 Cd tolerance-related candidate genes were detected, nine of which were metal ion transporters. These results provide promising candidate genes for further gene cloning and improving Cd tolerance in barley."
https://openalex.org/W3017054406,"475 patients (including 222 women), mean age 69.7±7.7, with HF, hospitalized at University Hospital between January and December 2018 were included in the study. The patients were selected by a physician specializing in cardiology. A cardiac nurse assessed the non-pharmacological level of compliance using the Revised Heart Failure Compliance Questionnaire (RHFCQ). The socio-clinical data were obtained from medical records. The majority of the study group were patients in NYHA II (62.4%) and NYHA III (28.3%), the mean duration of the disease was 6.2±4.9 years, and the mean ejection fraction of the left ventricle (EF) was 48.6±12.6. The average level of compliance in the study group measured on a scale from 0 to 4 points was: median = 2.7, IQR [2.32; 3.25]. Only 6.9% of the respondents adhere to recommendations totally (all dimensions of RHFCQ). In univariate analysis, predictors negatively affecting compliance were: female gender (rho = -0.325), age below 65 years (rho = -0.014)), loneliness (rho = -0.559), number of hospitalizations (rho = -0.242), higher stage of NYHA (rho = -1.612), co-morbidities (rho = -0.729), re-hospitalizations (rho = -0.729), beta-blockers treatment (rho = -1.612) and diuretics treatment (rho = -0.276). Factors positively affecting compliance were: EF≥45% (rho = 0.020) and treatment with ACEI/ARB (rho = 0.34), whereas compliance was negatively affected by-EF<45% (β = 0.009). Independent predictors influencing the level of compliance were: loneliness (β = -1.816), number of hospitalizations (β = -0.117), NYHA III and IV and number of co-morbidities (β = -0.676).Patients with HF do not adhere to therapeutic recommendations. The lowest compliance levels were found for exercise and daily weighing, and the highest for follow-up appointment-keeping and medication. Loneliness and age are the strongest predictors which influence the level of compliance."
https://openalex.org/W3017219195,"Nearly 6 million Americans suffer from heart failure. Increased fibrosis contributes to functional decline of the heart that leads to heart failure. Previously, we identified a mechanosensitive protein, small proline-rich repeat 3 (SPRR3), in vascular smooth muscle cells of atheromas. In this study, we demonstrate SPRR3 expression in cardiac fibroblasts which is induced in activated fibroblasts following pressure-induced heart failure. Sprr3 deletion in mice showed preserved cardiac function and reduced interstitial fibrosis in vivo and reduced fibroblast proliferation and collagen expression in vitro. SPRR3 loss resulted in reduced activation of Akt, FAK, ERK, and p38 signaling pathways, which are coordinately regulated by integrins and growth factors. SPRR3 deletion did not impede integrin-associated functions including cell adhesion, migration, or contraction. SPRR3 loss resulted in reduced activation of PDGFRβ in fibroblasts. This was not due to the reduced PDGFRβ expression levels or decreased binding of the PDGF ligand to PDGFRβ. SPRR3 facilitated the association of integrin β1 with PDGFRβ and subsequently fibroblast proliferation, suggesting a role in PDGFRβ-Integrin synergy. We postulate that SPRR3 may function as a conduit for the coordinated activation of PDGFRβ by integrin β1, leading to augmentation of fibroblast proliferation and matrix synthesis downstream of biomechanical and growth factor signals."

The aim of this study was to find out the prevalence of silico-tuberculosis, silicosis and other respiratory morbidities in sandstone mine workers in Jodhpur district of Rajasthan. Methods It was a cross-sectional study done in sandstone mines in Jodhpur. A total of 15 mines were selected. The sample size was calculated and fixed to 174 mine workers. Chi-square and t-test were applied to draw inferences. Results The mean age of the mine workers was 39.13 ± 11.09 years. Three fourth (75.3%) of the workers were working for more than ten years in mines. Around 30.0% had a history of tuberculosis. Abnormal spirometry was found in 89.2% of workers. Around 42% of mine workers were found with abnormal chest x-rays. Prevalence of silicosis was 37.3%, silico-tuberculosis was 7.4%, tuberculosis was 10.0%, and other respiratory diseases like emphysema and pleural effusion were diagnosed among 4.3% workers. Conclusion Prevalence of silico-tuberculosis, silicosis and other respiratory morbidities are high among sandstone mine workers."
https://openalex.org/W3016565981,"Oxidative stress is involved in the pathogenesis of a number of diseases including hypertension and renal failure. There is enhanced expression of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADPH oxidase) and therefore production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) during renal disease progression. This study investigated the effect of apocynin, an NADPH oxidase inhibitor and catalase, an H2O2 scavenger on Cyclosporine A (CsA) nephrotoxicity in Wistar-Kyoto rats. Rats received CsA (25mg/kg/day via gavage) and were assigned to vehicle, apocynin (2.5mmol/L p.o.), catalase (10,000U/kg/day i.p.) or apocynin plus catalase for 14 days. Renal functional and hemodynamic parameters were measured every week, and kidneys were harvested at the end of the study for histological and NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) assessment. Oxidative stress markers and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were measured. CsA rats had higher plasma malondialdehyde (by 340%) and BUN (by 125%), but lower superoxide dismutase and total antioxidant capacity (by 40%, all P<0.05) compared to control. CsA increased blood pressure (by 46mmHg) and decreased creatinine clearance (by 49%, all P<0.05). Treatment of CsA rats with apocynin, catalase, and their combination decreased blood pressure to near control values (all P<0.05). NOX4 mRNA activity was higher in the renal tissue of CsA rats by approximately 63% (P<0.05) compared to controls but was reduced in apocynin (by 64%), catalase (by 33%) and combined treatment with apocynin and catalase (by 84%) compared to untreated CsA rats. Treatment of CsA rats with apocynin, catalase, and their combination prevented hypertension and restored renal functional parameters and tissue Nox4 expression in this model. NADPH inhibition and H2O2 scavenging is an important therapeutic strategy during CsA nephrotoxicity and hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W3016949247,"Considering a growing demand for medicinal/cosmetic products with natural actives, this study focuses on the low-energy nanoemulsions (LE-NEs) prepared via the Phase inversion composition (PIC) method at room temperature as potential carriers for natural oil. Four different red raspberry seed oils (ROs) were tested, as follows: cold-pressed vs. CO2-extracted, organic vs. non-organic, refined vs. unrefined. The oil phase was optimized with Tocopheryl acetate and Isostearyl isostearate, while water phase was adjusted with either glycerol or an antioxidant hydro-glycolic extract. This study has used a combined approach to formulation development, employing both conventional methods (pseudo-ternary phase diagram − PTPD, electrical conductivity, particle size measurements, microscopical analysis, and rheological measurements) and the methods novel to this area, such as textural analysis and Raman spectroscopy. Raman spectroscopy has detected fine differences in chemical composition among ROs, and it detected the interactions within nanoemulsions. It was shown that the cold-pressed, unrefined, organic grade oil (RO2) with 6.62% saturated fatty acids and 92.25% unsaturated fatty acids, was optimal for the LE-NEs. Textural analysis confirmed the existence of cubic gel-like phase as a crucial step in the formation of stable RO2-loaded LE-NEs, with droplets in the narrow nano-range (125 to 135 nm; PDI ≤ 0.1). The DPPH test in methanol and ABTS in aqueous medium have revealed a synergistic free radical scavenging effect between lipophilic and hydrophilic antioxidants in LE-NEs. The nanoemulsion carrier has improved the biological effect of raw materials on HeLa cervical adenocarcinoma cells, while exhibiting good safety profile, as confirmed on MRC-5 normal human lung fibroblasts. Overall, this study has shown that low-energy nanoemulsions present very promising carriers for topical delivery of natural bioactives. Raman spectroscopy and textural analysis have proven to be a useful addition to the arsenal of methods used in the formulation and characterization of nanoemulsion systems."
https://openalex.org/W3017354654,"Hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) have been shown to be essential in the development and regeneration of hair follicles (HFs). The Inner Mongolia Cashmere goat (Capra hircus) has two types of HFs, primary and secondary, with cashmere being produced from the secondary hair follicle. To identify the genes associated with cashmere growth, transcriptome profiling of anagen and telogen secondary HFSCs was performed by RNA-Seq. The RNA-Seq analysis generated over 58 million clean reads from each group, with 2717 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) detected between anagen and telogen, including 1500 upregulated and 1217 downregulated DEGs. A large number of DEGs were predominantly associated with cell part, cellular process, binding, biological regulation and organelle. In addition, the PI3K-Akt, MAPK, Ras and Rap1 signaling pathways may be involved in the growth of HFSCs cultured in vitro. The RNA-Seq results showed that the well-defined HFSC signature genes and cell cycle-associated genes showed no significant differences between anagen and telogen HFSCs, indicating a relatively quiescent cellular state of the HFSCs cultured in vitro. These results are useful for future studies of complex molecular mechanisms of hair follicle cycling in cashmere goats."
https://openalex.org/W3016993142,"Fibrosis is a hallmark of several cardiovascular diseases. The relaxin family peptide receptor 1 (RXFP1) agonist, relaxin, has rapidly occurring anti-fibrotic actions which are mediated through RXFP1 and angiotensin II receptor crosstalk on renal and cardiac myofibroblasts. Here, we investigated whether this would allow relaxin to indirectly activate angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2R)-specific signal transduction in primary human cardiac myofibroblasts (HCMFs). The anti-fibrotic effects of recombinant human relaxin (RLX; 16.8 nM) or the AT2R-agonist, Compound 21 (C21; 1 μM), were evaluated in TGF-β1-stimulated HCMFs, in the absence or presence of an RXFP1 antagonist (1 μM) or AT2R antagonist (0.1 μM) to confirm RXFP1-AT2R crosstalk. Competition binding for RXFP1 was determined. Western blotting was performed to determine which AT2R-specific protein phosphatases were expressed by HCMFs; then, the anti-fibrotic effects of RLX and/or C21 were evaluated in the absence or presence of pharmacological inhibition (NSC95397 (1 μM) for MKP-1; okadaic acid (10 nM) for PP2A) or siRNA-knockdown of these phosphatases after 72 hours. The RLX- or C21-induced increase in ERK1/2 and nNOS phosphorylation, and decrease in α-SMA (myofibroblast differentiation) and collagen-I expression by HCMFs was abrogated by pharmacological blockade of RXFP1 or the AT2R, confirming RXFP1-AT2R crosstalk in these cells. HCMFs were found to express AT2R-dependent MKP-1 and PP2A phosphatases, while pharmacological blockade or siRNA-knockdown of either phosphatase also abolished RLX and/or C21 signal transduction in HCMFs (all P < .05 vs RLX or C21 alone). These findings demonstrated that RLX can indirectly activate AT2R-dependent phosphatase activity in HCMFs by signaling through RXFP1-AT2R crosstalk, which have important therapeutic implications for its anti-fibrotic actions."
https://openalex.org/W3017147011,"To describe the prevalence of previously diagnosed diabetes among Mexican adults, to characterize the associated risk factors, and to describe which glycemic control strategies are the most used.We analyzed data from 8,631 adults aged ≥20 years who participated in the ENSANUT-2016 and from whom we gathered data about previously diagnosed diabetes, risk factors, glycemic control strategies, and measures to prevent complications.The prevalence of previously diagnosed diabetes in Mexican adults was 9.4% (10.3% in women and 8.4% in men). The adjusted OR for having diabetes was higher in adults aged ≥60 years (OR = 11.0 in women and OR = 30.7 in men) than in adults aged 20-39 years (OR = 1.0). The adjusted OR for having diabetes was higher in overweight men (OR = 1.7) than in men with normal BMI (OR = 1.0). A total of 30.5% of adults with diabetes did not report any control strategies, 44.9% measured their venous blood glucose, and 15.2% used the HbA1C as an indicator of glycemic control. Only 46.4% of them reported preventive measures.Diabetes is a common disease among Mexican adults. Being older or overweight are risk factors for an adult to be diagnosed with diabetes. Most adults with diabetes evaluate their glycemic control but only half practice preventive measures."
https://openalex.org/W3016963072,"We observed prominent effects of doxorubicin (Dox), an anthracycline widely used in anti-cancer therapy, on the aggregation and intracellular distribution of both partners of the H2A-H2B dimer, with marked differences between the two histones. Histone aggregation, assessed by Laser Scanning Cytometry via the retention of the aggregates in isolated nuclei, was observed in the case of H2A. The dominant effect of the anthracycline on H2B was its massive accumulation in the cytoplasm of the Jurkat leukemia cells concomitant with its disappearance from the nuclei, detected by confocal microscopy and mass spectrometry. A similar effect of the anthracycline was observed in primary human lymphoid cells, and also in monocyte-derived dendritic cells that harbor an unusually high amount of H2B in their cytoplasm even in the absence of Dox treatment. The nucleo-cytoplasmic translocation of H2B was not affected by inhibitors of major biochemical pathways or the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B, but it was completely diminished by PYR-41, an inhibitor with pleiotropic effects on protein degradation pathways. Dox and PYR-41 acted synergistically according to isobologram analyses of cytotoxicity. These large-scale effects were detected already at Dox concentrations that may be reached in the typical clinical settings, therefore they can contribute both to the anti-cancer mechanism and to the side-effects of this anthracycline."
https://openalex.org/W3016804204,"Fibronectin type III domain containing 4 (FNDC4) belongs to the fibronectin type III domain containing protein family. FNDC5, which is highly homologous to FNDC4, can promote the differentiation of cardiac cells. We aimed to investigate the role of FNDC4 in the differentiation of C2C12 mouse skeletal muscle cells. Western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis showed that FNDC4 gradually increased with the differentiation of C2C12. Muscle injury repair experiments indicated that FNDC4 may promote the repair of injured muscles. When FNDC4 was either overexpressed or knocked down, the expression of desmin and myogenin myogenic marker molecules followed that of FNDC4, suggesting that FNDC4 can influence the differentiation of C2C12. In addition, immunoprecipitation results showed that FNDC4 can interact with the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway receptor low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6), and that β-catenin levels in the nucleus decreased after knocking down FNDC4. Exogenous addition of FNDC4 protein could not restore the blocking of differentiation due to inhibition of both Wnt/β-catenin signal transduction and LRP6 activity via the β-catenin inhibitor XAV-939. Overall, our findings indicate that FDNC4 can influence the differentiation of C2C12 by activating Wnt/β-catenin signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W3017118908,"Background To examine whether continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) with remote monitoring by followers (family/friends) changes glucose management, follower interventions, and health outcomes compared to CGM alone in pregnant women with diabetes. Methods We prospectively stratified first trimester pregnant women with Type 1 Diabetes to CGM Share (remote monitoring) or CGM Alone. We enrolled a main follower per woman. We retrospectively acquired data for pregnant women who did not use CGM (no CGM). We compared hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) between groups. We compared sensor glucose, follower interventions, and gestational outcomes between CGM Alone and CGM Share. Longitudinal mixed effects models were used for analyses of changes in outcomes over time. Results HbA1c decreased in all groups throughout pregnancy and was significantly lower over time in women using CGM Share (n = 15) compared to CGM Alone (n = 13) or no CGM (n = 8) (p = 0.0042). CGM Share users had lower median sensor glucose levels (p = 0.0331) and percent time spent >180 mg/dL (p = 0.0228) across pregnancy. There were no significant differences in maternal and fetal outcomes between groups. CGM Share followers had more alerts for hypoglycemia, but did fewer interventions. Conclusions In this small pilot study, use of CGM with remote monitoring improved some glycemic metrics in pregnant women with diabetes."

https://openalex.org/W3016985157,"In recent years, chronic degenerative diseases such as certain types of cancers, are becoming an evident issue. DNA damage has been for long recognized as a causal factor for cancer development because mutations or chromosomal aberrations affect oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes leading cells to malignant transformation and to the subsequent cancerous growth. Medicinal plants are often used for the prevention or treatment of various diseases with great scientific interest. Among the medicinal plants distributed in the Mediterranean region, Fraxinus angustifolia Vahl. has been used in traditional medicine for its remarkable curative properties. However, in spite of this popularity, little works have been performed on the activity so that further studies should be performed to investigate in depth the antimutagenic, antigenotoxic and antiproliferative activities of the plant. Thus, the present study was aimed to the evaluation of the potential antimutagenic, antigenotoxic and antiproliferative properties of leaves and stem bark extracts of this well-known tree. Antimutagenic activity was evaluated by Salmonella mutagenicity assay in Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 strains. The antigenotoxic potential was assessed by umu test in the strain of S. typhimurium TA1535/pSK1002. Antiproliferative activity was studied on human hepatoblastoma (HepG-2) and on breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) cell lines by MTT assay. Furthermore, the antiproliferative activity observed on cancer cells was compared with that on the human normal-like fibroblasts (TelCOFS02MA) and the selectivity index was calculated to understand if extracts were able to exert selective toxicity towards cancer cells. Moreover, phenolic compounds are plant substances with a large spectrum of biochemical activities with antioxidant, antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic effects. Based on the strong evidence of biological activities of phenolic compounds, the study was focused on the determination of total phenolics and flavonoids contents, and the phytochemical composition of the extracts assessed by LC/MS. The ethanol extracts of both leaves and stem barks showed significant from moderate to strong antimutagenic and antigenotoxic effects. In addition, selective cytotoxicity towards cancer cells was shown by ethanolic leaves extract and aqueous/chloroform leaves and stem bark extracts. The latter showed high levels of total phenolic contents among all the other extracts. Identified phenylethanoids (calceolariosides, verbascoside) and secoiridoids (oleuropein and ligstroside) could be responsible for the demonstrated broad spectrum of healthy properties."
https://openalex.org/W3017325162,"Anxiety has been implicated as one of the greatest influences on quality of life in Parkinson’s disease (PD). The etiology of anxiety is unclear, although previous work suggests that anxiety may be linked to sensory deficits that cause uncertainty in movement. Thus, the current study examined whether focusing attention on sensory feedback during goal-based exercise has the potential to provide benefits to anxiety in PD. Thirty-five participants with PD were randomized to either a Sensory Attention Focused Exercise (SAFEx) (i.e. internal focus of attention, n = 18) or Sham Exercise control (i.e. external focus of attention, n = 17) and completed 33 one-hour attention-based exercise sessions over 11-weeks. Before and after the program (pre and post), participants completed the Parkinson Anxiety Scale (PAS) questionnaire. The PAS includes three anxiety sections: persistent, episodic, and avoidance. Changes in the total PAS score and within each section of the PAS were subjected to two-factor mixed repeated measures ANCOVA. Significant group by time interactions demonstrated that from pre to post, total PAS scores (p = 0.007) and episodic anxiety scores (p = 0.010) significantly decreased in the SAFEx group only (ΔTotal PAS = -5.2, F(1,27) = 5.41, p = 0.028, ηp2 = 0.17; ΔEpisodic Score = -1.8, F(1,27) = 6.89, p = 0.014, ηp2 = 0.20). In conclusion, focusing attention on sensory feedback while completing goal-based exercises may provide significant benefits to improving anxiety in PD. As such, sensory attention focused exercise may be a critical adjunct therapy for improving anxiety, and ultimately quality of life in people with PD."
https://openalex.org/W3016583194,"Background The Four Habits Coding Scheme (4-HCS) is a standardized instrument designed to assess physicians’ communication skills from an external rater’s perspective, based on video-recorded consultations. Objective To perform the cross-cultural adaptation of the 4-HCS into French and to assess its psychometric properties. Methods The 4-HCS was cross-culturally adapted by conducting forward and backward translations with independent translators, following international guidelines. Four raters rated 200 video-recorded medical student consultations with standardized patients, using the French version of the 4-HCS. We examined the internal consistency, factor structure, construct validity, and reliability of the 4-HCS. Results The mean overall 4-HCS score was 76.44 (standard deviation, 12.34), with no floor or ceiling effects across subscales. The median rating duration of rating was 8 min (range, 4–19). Cronbach’s alpha was 0.94 for the overall 4-HCS, ranging from 0.72 to 0.88 across subscales. In confirmatory factor analysis, goodness-of-fit statistics did not corroborate the hypothesized 4-habit structure. Exploratory factor analysis resulted in two dimensions, with the merging of three conceptually related habits into a single dimension and substantial cross-loading for 15 out of 23 items. Median average absolute-agreement intra-class correlation coefficient estimates were 0.74 (range, 0.68–0.84) and 0.85 (range, 0.76–0.91) for inter- and intra-rater reliability of habit subscales, respectively. Conclusion The French version of the 4-HCS demonstrates satisfactory internal consistency but requires the use of two independent raters to achieve acceptable reliability. The underlying factor structure of the original US version and cross-cultural adaptations of the 4-HCS deserve further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W3016889218,"Mammalian immune responses are initiated by danger signals--immutable molecular structures known as PAMPs. When detected by fixed, germline encoded receptors, pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMPs) subsequently inform the polarization of downstream adaptive responses depending upon identity and localization of the PAMP. Here, we report the existence of a completely novel that is not a molecular structure but an antigenic pattern. This pattern--the incidence of peptide epitopes with stretches of 100% sequence identity bound to both dendritic cell (DC) major histocompatibility (MHC) class I and MHC class II--strongly induces TH 1 immune polarization and activation of the cellular immune response. Inherent in the existence of this PAMP is the concomitant existence of a molecular sensor complex with the ability to scan and compare amino acid sequence identities of bound class I and II peptides. We provide substantial evidence implicating the multienzyme aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (mARS) complex and its AIMp1 structural component as the key constituents of this complex. The results demonstrate a wholly novel mechanism by which T-helper (TH ) polarization is governed and provide critical information for the design of vaccination strategies intended to provoke cell-mediated immunity."
https://openalex.org/W3017187929,"Diets rich in flavonoids have been related with low obesity rates, which could be related with their potential to inhibit pancreatic lipase, the main enzyme of fat assimilation. Some flavonoids can aggregate in aqueous medium suggesting that the inhibition mechanism could occur on both molecular and colloidal levels. This study investigates the interaction of two flavonoid aggregates, quercetin and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), with pancreatic lipase under simplified intestinal conditions. The stability and the morphology of these flavonoid aggregates were studied in four different solutions: Control (water), salt, low lipase concentration and high lipase concentration. Particles were found by optical microscopy in almost all the solutions tested, except EGCG-control. The results show that the precipitation rate decreases for quercetin and increases for EGCG in salt solution and that lipase stabilize quercetin aggregates. In addition, both flavonoids were shown to precipitate together with pancreatic lipase resulting in a sequestering of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W3017143314,"Speech fluency can be impaired in stressful situations. In this study, it was investigated whether a verbal fluency task by itself, i.e. without the presence of any further stressors, induces responses of the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis and of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). The sample consisted of n = 85 participants (68.2% female; 33.3 ± 15.2 years) who performed two consecutive verbal fluency tasks for two minutes each. The categories were either ‘stress’ or ‘disease’ and ‘animals’ or ‘foods’ which were presented in a randomized order. Three saliva samples were collected, prior to the task (t0), immediately after (t1), and ten minutes after it (t2). Salivary α-amylase and cortisol were assessed. Furthermore, blood pressure, heart rate, and ratings of actual stress perception, level of effort, and tiredness were measured. The verbal fluency task induced a HPA axis response with a maximum cortisol level at t2 which was independent of task performance. Furthermore, perceived stress and effort, as well as tiredness increased after the task. Moreover, tiredness immediately after the task was negatively correlated with task performance. No α-amylase, blood pressure, or heart rate, and therefore SNS, responses were found. Implications for the integrated specificity model are discussed. We conclude that a verbal fluency task acts like an acute stressor that induces a cortisol and a perceived stress response without the need for further (e.g., social-evaluative) stress components. Therefore, it is a less time-consuming alternative to other stress tasks that can be used in field studies with little effort."
https://openalex.org/W3017244323,"DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are one of the most serious types of DNA damage. However, multiple repair pathways are present in cells to ensure rapid and appropriate repair of DSBs. Pathway selection depends on several factors including cell type, cell cycle phase, and damage severity. Ribosomal protein S3 (rpS3), a component of the 40S small ribosomal subunit, is a multi-functional protein primarily involved in protein synthesis. rpS3 is also involved in the mediation of various extra-ribosomal pathways, including DNA damage processing and the stress response. Here, we report that rpS3 is a novel negative regulator of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)-mediated repair of DSBs. We found that rpS3 interacts with the Ku heterodimers of the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) complex and slows down NHEJ ligation reactions, ultimately triggering p53-dependent cell death following treatment with high-dose ionizing radiation. After DSB formation, DNA-PK phosphorylates rpS3, which consequently reduces the binding of rpS3 to the Ku complex. We hypothesized that rpS3 may play a role in DSB repair by repressing NHEJ, while inducing other repair pathways, and by initiating DSB-induced cell death in response to severe DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W3016950095,"Although anxiety disorders are among the most prevalent of psychiatric disorders, childhood trauma-related studies seldom consider anxiety proneness as distinct aetiological contributor. We aimed to distinguish between trauma- and anxiety-associated physiological profiles. South African adolescent volunteers were categorised for trauma exposure (CTQ, mean score 39±11) and anxiety proneness (AP)(CASI, mean score 37±7, STAI-T, mean score 41±8). Circulating hormone and leukocyte glucocorticoid receptor levels, as well as leukocyte functional capacity, were assessed. AP was associated with lower DHEAs (P<0.05) and higher leukocyte GR expression (P<0.05). DHEAs was also negatively correlated with anxiety sensitivity (CASI, P<0.05). In conclusion, AP may have more predictive power than trauma in terms of health profile. Increased glucocorticoid sensitivity previously reported after trauma, may be a unique function of anxiety and not trauma exposure per se. DHEAs concentration was identified as potentially useful marker for monitoring progressive changes in HPA-axis sensitivity and correlated with psychological measures of anxiety."
https://openalex.org/W3016957788,"Objective Whether the use of assisted reproductive technologies (ART) affects the outcome of twin pregnancies is still a matter of debate. Previous studies have evaluated the association between birth weight and ART, without a clear distinction between fetal growth restriction (FGR), a condition at higher risk of adverse outcome, and constitutionally small for gestational age (SGA) fetuses. The aim of this study was to determine whether dichorionic (DC) twin pregnancies obtained by ART have a greater risk of developing FGR, defined by accurate ultrasound criteria, than those spontaneously conceived (SC), and to compare the severity of ultrasound features in the growth restricted fetuses. Methods A retrospective study was conducted on DC twin pregnancies delivered between 2010 to 2018 at a tertiary hospital. Twin pregnancies conceived spontaneously were compared with those obtained via in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), after exclusion of cases with major fetal or uterine malformations. The primary outcome was the incidence of FGR. Secondary outcome was the rate of SGA neonates, defined by a birth weight less than the 10th percentile. The ultrasound characteristics of the growth restricted fetuses in the two groups were also compared. The groups were compared using univariate and multivariate analyses. Results Six hundred and seventy-eight DC twin pregnancies were identified. Of these, 367 (54.1%) conceived via IVF/ICSI and 311 (45.9%) conceived spontaneously. The incidence of FGR was not significantly different between the ART and the SC groups (7.9% vs 8.4% respectively, p = 0.76, adjusted OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.53–1.32). Growth restricted fetuses of the two groups showed similar occurrence of an estimated fetal weight less than the 3rd percentile, similar abnormalities in Doppler studies and similar gestational age at diagnosis. There was no difference in the incidence of delivery of an SGA neonate (p = 0.47) or in the rate of maternal complications and preterm delivery between the groups. Conclusions Twin pregnancies conceived by assisted reproductive technologies do not have a higher risk of ultrasound-diagnosed FGR than spontaneously conceived twin pregnancies, and fetuses diagnosed with growth restriction in the two groups show similar severity of the ultrasound findings."
https://openalex.org/W3017154230,"The existing tamper detection schemes for absolute moment block truncation coding (AMBTC) compressed images are able to detect the tampering. However, the marked image qualities of these schemes can be enhanced, and their authentication methods may fail to detect some special tampering. We propose a secure AMBTC tamper detection scheme that preserves high image fidelity with excellent detectability. In the proposed approach, a bit in bitmaps of AMBTC codes is sequentially toggled to generate a set of authentication codes. The one that causes the least distortion is embedded into the quantization levels with the guidance of a key-generated reference table (RT). Without the correct key, the same reference table cannot be constructed. Therefore, the proposed method is able to detect various kinds of malicious tampering, including those special tampering techniques designed for RT-based authentication schemes. The proposed method not only offers better image quality, but also provides an excellent and satisfactory detectability as compared with previous works."
https://openalex.org/W3017215444,"Electrically conductive composite ultrafiltration membranes composed of carbon nanotubes have exhibited efficient fouling inhibition in wastewater treatment applications. In the current study, poly(vinyl-alcohol)-carbon nanotube membranes were applied to fed batch crossflow electroultrafiltration of dilute (0.1 g/L of each species) single and binary protein solutions of α-lactalbumin and hen egg-white lysozyme at pH 7.4, 4 mM ionic strength, and 1 psi. Electroultrafiltration using the poly(vinyl-alcohol)-carbon nanotube composite membranes yielded temporary enhancements in sieving for single protein filtration and in selectivity for binary protein separation compared to ultrafiltration using the unmodified PS-35 membranes. Assessment of membrane fouling based on permeate flux, zeta potential measurements, and scanning electron microscopy visualization of the conditioned membranes indicated significant resulting protein adsorption and aggregation which limited the duration of improvement during electroultrafiltration with an applied cathodic potential of -4.6 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). These results imply that appropriate optimization of electroultrafiltration using carbon nanotube-deposited polymeric membranes may provide substantial short-term improvements in binary protein separations."
https://openalex.org/W3017306066,"Autologous adipose tissue (AT) transfer has gained widespread acceptance and is used for a broad variety of regenerative clinical indications. It is assumed that the successful outcome of AT transfer essentially depends on the amount of autocrine-generated growth factors (GF). It is supposed that several GF enhance and improve the anatomic and functional integration of the transplanted AT grafts at the site of implantation. In the present study we have investigated for the first time the correlation between the concentration of GF of freshly isolated AT and the proliferation and migration capacity of mesenchymal stroma cells (MSCs) derived from the respective AT sample. We here show that the proliferation and migration capacity of MSCs strongly depends on the GF content of the AT the cells were isolated from but in an inversely proportional manner. The lower the GF content of an AT sample was, the higher was the proliferation and migration capacity of the respective MSC population contained in the AT and vice versa. Furthermore, we found that supplementation with recombinant GFs only in the case of AT samples with low but not with higher growth factor contents led to a significant enhancement of proliferation and migration of the AT-resident MSCs. As we further show, this inefficiency of GFs to enhance MSC proliferation and migration in AT samples with high GF contents indicates a GF-mediated negative feedback mechanism leading to an impaired GF signaling in MSC obtained from those AT samples. Our results might explain why the successful use of AT grafting is frequently limited by low and unpredictable survival rates, and we suggest to use the knowledge of GF content of harvested AT as a predictive clinical parameter for risk assessment of the therapeutic outcome of autologous AT transfer."
https://openalex.org/W3016354157,"Subspecies are often less well-defined than species but have become one of the basic units for legal protection. Evidence for the erection or synonymy of subspecies therefore needs to be founded on the best science available. Here we show that there is clear genetic disjunction in the Sarus Crane Antigone antigone, where previously the variation had appeared to be clinal. Based on a total sample of 76 individuals, analysis of 10 microsatellite loci from 67 samples and 49 sequences from the mitochondrial control region, this research establishes that the Australian Sarus Crane A. a. gillae differs significantly from both A. a. antigone (South Asia) and A. a. sharpii (Myanmar and Indochina). A single sample from the extinct Philippine subspecies A. a luzonica clustered with A. a. gillae, hinting at the potential for a more recent separation between them than from A. a. antigone and A. a. sharpii, even though A. a. sharpii is closer geographically. The results demonstrate that failure to detect subspecies through initial genetic profiling does not mean discontinuities are absent and has significance for other cases where subspecies are dismissed based on partial genetic evidence. It could also be potentially important for sourcing birds for reintroduction to the Philippines."
https://openalex.org/W3016503617,"Background Surgical site infections are one of the commonest types of healthcare-associated infections. Up to 60% of these infections are estimated to be preventable by using evidence-based guidelines. As a front line caregiver, nurses are responsible for the majority of preventive activities. Hence, the enhanced practical skill of nurses is an essential component in preventive actions. Objective The aim of this study was to assess the practice of nurses and identify factors associated with it regarding prevention of surgical site infections in Addis Ababa city public hospitals. Methods An institution-based cross-sectional study was carried out from March 01–30, 2018. An adapted and pretested, self-administered questionnaire was utilized as a data collection tool. A stratified random sampling technique was employed by considering the level of hospitals as a stratum. Data were entered into a computer using Epi-data 3.1 statistical package. Then, it was exported to SPSS Version 23 for further analysis. Descriptive statistics were computed for the study variables. Bivariate regression analysis was also run to assess the association between independent variables and the level of nurse’s practice. To see the relative effect of independent variables on the nurse’s practice, a multivariable regression analysis was carried out. Result A total of 409 nurses returned the questionnaire with a response rate of 98%. Majority (60.4%) of the participants were females and 84.1% were BSc holders. Less than half, (48.9%) of the participants were found to have good practice regarding prevention of surgical site infection. Being male, having more work experience, higher educational level and using available infection prevention guidelines were significantly associated with practice at p <0.05. Conclusion More than half of the participants have inadequate practice regarding prevention of surgical site infection. Training nurses, making surgical site infection prevention guidelines easily accessible and ensuring possessed knowledge by nurses is potent enough and can be translated into desirable actions are recommended."
https://openalex.org/W3016660052,"Acupuncture is one of the therapeutic resources used for the management of chronic pain. Variability in outcome measurements in randomized clinical trials of non-oncologic chronic pain (RCT-NOCP) generates inconsistencies in determining effects of treatments. The objective of this survey was to assess the adherence to the recommendations made by the Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) in the measurement of RCT-NOCP of acupuncture. This methodological research made a systematic search for eligible studies from different sources of information. Eligible studies included those with number of patients ≥100, who randomized and allocated patients with chronic non-oncologic pain to be treated with acupuncture or with ""sham"" acupuncture, or non-acupuncture. This research included the recommendations for IMMPACT in the measurement of RCT-NOCP: presence of outcomes pain, physical function, emotional state and improvement perception of patient, the source of the outcome information pain and the tools used to measure such domains. From a total of 1,386 studies, 24 were included in this survey. Eleven studies presented low risk of bias. Pain outcome was measured in 23 studies, physical function in 22 studies, emotional state in 14 studies and improvement perception of patient in one study. As for the pain outcome, the patient was the information source in 50% of the studies. The measurement tools recommended for IMMPACT were included in eight studies (35%) that evaluated pain, one study that evaluated the emotional state (7%), and one study that evaluated the improvement perception and satisfaction of patient. It was observed that studies which did not adhere to the recommendations had more favorable results for acupuncture in the outcome pain. This study concludes that randomized clinical trials that used acupuncture to manage chronic pain failed to adhere to IMMPACT recommendations. Clinical societies and IMMPACT do not share the same recommendations. This fact reflects in the diversity of outcomes and instruments adopted in the studies, making it difficult to compare the results."
https://openalex.org/W3017040134,"DaHuangWan (DHW) is a traditional herbal medicine used by Mongolian to treat liver cancer for many years. Clinical application of the drug has been shown to help control tumor progression, prolong survival and improve quality of life. However, the underlying mechanisms and side effects of this drug remain unclear, which greatly limits the clinical application and further optimization of DHW. In this study, we found that DHW inhibits the proliferation of hepatoma cells by modulating the epithelial growth factor (EGF) signaling pathway. Berberine and Costunolide are the main active ingredients in DHW. Interestingly, the combination of Berberine and Costunolide has a dramatic synergistic effect on inhibiting the proliferation of hepatoma cells. Neither Berberine nor Costunolide directly block EGFR phosphorylation. Berberine promotes endocytosis of activated EGFR, while as Costunolide increases ubiquitination of EGFR and reduces EGFR recycling to cell membrane distribution, thereby inhibiting EGF signaling. Berberine and Costunolide target two different steps in regulating the EGF signaling, which explains the synergistic anti-cancer effect of DHW. Since Berberine and Costunolide do not directly target EGFR phosphorylation, DHW could be a supplementary medicine to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3016588513,"Temporal attention can be entrained exogenously to rhythms. Indeed, faster and more accurate responses were previously found when the target appeared in-phase with a preceding rhythm in comparison to when it was out of phase. However, the nature of this rhythm-induced attentional effect is not well understood. To better understand the processes underlying rhythm-induced attention, we employed a continuous measure of perceived orientation and a mixture-model analysis. A trial in our study started with a sequence of auditory beeps separated by a fixed inter-beeps interval in the regular (rhythmic) condition or by variable inter-beeps intervals in the irregular condition. A visual target–a line embedded in a circle–followed the sequence. The ‘critical’ interval between the last beep and the target was chosen randomly from several possible Inter-Onset Intervals (IOIs), of which only one was in-phase with the rhythm. The target was followed by a probe line, and the participants were asked to rotate it to reproduce the target’s orientation. The measure of performance for a given trial was the difference in degrees between the orientation of the target and that reproduced by the observer. We found that guessing rate was lower with regular than irregular rhythms. However, there was no effect of rhythm type (regular vs irregular) on the quality of representation (measured as the variability in reproducing the target). Furthermore, the rhythm effect was present only when rhythm type was fixed within a block, and it was found with all IOIs, not just the in-phase IOI. This lack of specificity suggests that these results reflect a general effect of rhythm on alertness."
https://openalex.org/W3017320364,"In this article we present a biologically inspired model of activation of memory items in a sequence. Our model produces two types of sequences, corresponding to two different types of cerebral functions: activation of regular or irregular sequences. The switch between the two types of activation occurs through the modulation of biological parameters, without altering the connectivity matrix. Some of the parameters included in our model are neuronal gain, strength of inhibition, synaptic depression and noise. We investigate how these parameters enable the existence of sequences and influence the type of sequences observed. In particular we show that synaptic depression and noise drive the transitions from one memory item to the next and neuronal gain controls the switching between regular and irregular (random) activation."

https://openalex.org/W3016546111,"Quantifying dose-dependent ultra-early edema and ultrastructural changes in the myocyte after drug delivery is important for the development of new mixed calcium channel blockers (CCBs).Arterial cannulation was used to measure mean arterial pressure in real time; simultaneously, magnetic resonance imaging proton density mapping was used to quantify edema 5-55 min after the delivery of L-type CCBs, T- and L-type CCBs, and solvent to a spontaneously hypertensive rat model. Transmission electron microscopy was used to show ultrastructural changes in the myocyte.Analysis of variance showed significant differences among the three groups in mean arterial pressure reduction (F = 246.36, P = 5.75E-25), ultra-early level of edema (ULE) (F = 175.49, P = 5.62E-22), and dose-dependent level of edema (DLE) (F = 199.48, P = 4.28E-23). Compared with the solvent's mean arterial pressure reduction (2.65±6.56±1.64), ULE (1.16±0.09±0.02), and DLE (0.0010±0.0001±0.0000), post hoc tests showed that T- and L-type CCBs had better mean arterial pressure reduction (90.67±11.58±2.90, P = 1.06E-24 vs. 68.34±15.19±3.80, P = 1.76E-12), lower ULE (1.53±0.14±0.04, P = 4.74E-9 vs. 2.08±0.18±0.04, P = 2.68E-22), and lower DLE (0.0025±0.0004±0.0001, P = 1.14E-11 vs. 0.0047±0.0008±0.0002, P = 2.10E-11) than L- type CCBs. Transmission electron microscopy showed that T- and L-type CCBs caused fewer ultrastructural changes in the myocytes after drug delivery than L-type CCBs.T- and L-type CCBs produced less ultra-early and dose-dependent edema, fewer ultrastructural changes in the myocyte, and a greater antihypertensive effect. Proton density mapping combined with arterial cannulation and transmission electron microscopy allowed for quantification of ultra-early and dose-dependent edema, antihypertensive efficacy, and ultrastructural changes in the myocyte. This is important for the evaluation of induced vasodilatory edema."
