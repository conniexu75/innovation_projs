At the site of its origin in the testis, and in the epididymis, the semen contains very little fructose but acquires it during its passage through the male generative tract, from the accessory glands of reproduction, mainly the seminal vesicles3."

https://openalex.org/W2055804989,"When fructose was established as the normal nutrient material for spermatozoa and its origin traced to the seminal vesicles1, it remained to be explained how certain animals, such as the rabbit, secrete fructose in semen in spite of the absence of seminal vesicles. The rabbit, however, has a large complex organ, sometimes referred to as the ‘prostate’, which has been described hitherto as composed of three glands, ‘gl. seminalis’, ‘gl. vesicularis’ and ‘prostate proper’, each with an independent urethral outlet2. However, our recent investigation of the development of the male reproductive system in the rabbit has established that the gl. seminalis develops in conjunction with the gl. vesicularis from the same diverticulum of the Wolffian duct; further, both glands possess a common urethral outlet, and gl. vesicularis as a whole, rather than the gl. seminalis by itself, should be regarded as homologous to the seminal vesicle in other mammals3. This, incidentally, explains the presence of fructose in the gl. vesiecularis. It should be pointed out, however, that in the rabbit, apart from this gland, fructose also occurs in the ampulla of the vas deferens as well as in the ‘prostate proper’. The distribution of fructose in the various parts of the reproductive system of the male rabbit is shown in the accompanying sketch."

https://openalex.org/W2074411610,"A multiparous woman with seven previous normal pregnancies was first tested serologically eight months after the commencement of the eighth pregnancy. She was typed as group Arr. The first serum sample showed a weak anti-Rh agglutinin (type anti-D) with a titre of 2, associated with an ‘incomplete’ antibody which was first thought to be ‘incomplete’ anti-D. Subsequent samples taken at intervals showed a rising titre of the ‘incomplete’ antibody which reached a peak titre of 1,024 ten days following delivery. During this period the anti-D agglutinin varied between titres of 1 and 2."

This work was developed by Krebs2 with reference to the function of glutamin and glutaminase. Weil-Malherbe3 suggested that l(+)glutamic acid fulfils a specific function in relation to carbohydrate metabolism in cerebral tissue. Latterly, Waelsch and his collaborators4 observed that the oral administration of dl-glutamic acid hydrochloride reduced the number of petit mal attacks in epileptics while it was without effect upon major seizures. Zimmerman et al.,5 confirming these observations, have claimed a favourable influence of the orally administered l(+)glutamic acid upon the intelligence of defective children."
https://openalex.org/W2002938625,"IN a previous communication1 I mentioned the dimensions of a unit cell of native starch in the B-modification as deduced from a fibre pattern obtained from a part of a single starch grain. It has now become evident, from consideration of the reciprocal lattice and reflexion globe, that the unexplained difference, noted in that communication, between the fibre period calculated from the pattern and the supposed true period, is a phenomenon that may be expected and that can be explained from bad parallelism between the micelles, especially from those directions of the micelle long axes which deviate from perpendicularity to the incident beam. Further-more, a critical revision of the d-values derived from a powder pattern of native starch in the B-modification has shown that a fibre period of 10.5–10.6 A. is in somewhat better agreement with these spacings than the period of 10.4 A. previously given."

https://openalex.org/W1966880320,"In a research carried out during the last five years on subjects in the west of Scotland, with an apparatus which efficiently discriminates between major (sex-linked) red-green defectives and ordinary colour-weak individuals, 7.8 per cent of male and 0.65 per cent of female sex-linked defectives were found in 464 males and 460 females. This corresponds well with the results of researches in which the Ishihara Test was used1,2,3. The expected frequency of female defectives would be 0.61 per cent, with 7.8 per cent of males in the population. The observed frequency of 0.65 per cent is not statistically different from this figure, and it suggests that there is little truth in the common belief that there are more colour-blind women in the population than would be expected. The extra ones are heterozygotes, some of whom are doubtful passes on the Ishihara test."

These findings, together with complementary observations on the abilities of various adrenal cortex steroids to restore the depleted tissue arginase levels after adrenalectomy1,2, are of great interest in view of the fact that it is now believed3 that certain cortical hormones promote gluconeo-genesis from protein, a process entailing deamination of amino-acids and the excretion of the nitrogen as urea through the ornithine cycle which, of course, involves the action of arginase."
https://openalex.org/W1990182405,"From the yellow mycorrhiza fungus Corticium croceum, a pigment has been isolated for which the name ‘corticrocin’ is proposed. Corticium croceum is a symbiont on the roots of Pinus silvestris, Picea excelsa, Vaccinium vitis idaea and other plants. The symbiosis is especially common when the plants grow on a poor, acid, sandy soil or on raw humus."

https://openalex.org/W1966164594,"During the last few years a field technique has been developed at Long Ashton for determining the nutrient condition of crops by the use of two complementary methods: (a) ‘Visual diagnosis’1 and (b) ‘tissue-tests’2,3. Technique (a) depends upon the appearance of specific symptoms associated with mineral deficiencies, and (b) depends upon the use in the field of rapid colorimetric and turbidity tests for estimating the mineral status of the growing crop."

While making use of this property in examining various materials for possible traces of known carcinogens, several observations were made which seem worthy of note when grouped together."

These units are somewhat cumbersome to write and even more awkward to say."

Kennedy3 has shown in the laboratory that sub-lethal doses of D.D.T. excite mosquitoes, and that when activated they move preferentially to light. For residual spraying in houses to be successful in reducing the incidence of malaria, it is essential, therefore, that the surface deposit applied shall be lethal to mosquitoes after only a brief contact."

https://openalex.org/W4230518357,"AT the Health Congress of the Royal Sanitary Institute recently held at Torquay, Section E (Food and Nutrition) met jointly on June 6 with the Food Group of the Society of Chemical Industry. Three papers were given at this session, each dealing with an important and topical aspect of food in relation to health. Prof. H. D. Kay (president of the Section) directed the attention of the meeting to the slow decline, that began some years before the War and was acutely accentuated during the winter months of the war years, in the compositional quality, and therefore in the nutritional value to the consumer, of market milk. The only reason for the existence of the milk industry is the fact that cows' milk is a valuable human foodstuff. Anything, therefore, causing a decrease in its nutritional value is of major importance not only to the consumer but also to all engaged in the industry, whether producers or distributors."
