The sheets of carbon atoms, just one atom thick, exhibit a vast array of properties—mechanical, optical, and electrical—that make it an ideal test bed to probe fundamental problems in physics, as well as lending itself to a wide portfolio of applications. Geim (p. 1530 ), the discoverer of this remarkable material, reviews recent advances and discusses what other developments may be in store for this material."

https://openalex.org/W2046093999,"Plethora of Secretory Amyloids Protein aggregation and the formation of amyloids are associated with several dozen pathological conditions in humans, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and type II diabetes. In addition, a few functional amyloid systems are known: the prions of fungi, the bacterial protein curli, the protein of chorion of the eggshell of silkworm, and the amyloid protein Pmel-17 involved in mammalian skin pigmentation. Now Maji et al. (p. 328 , published online 18 June) propose that endocrine hormone peptides and proteins are stored in an amyloid-like state in secretory granules. Thus, the amyloid fold may represent a fundamental, ancient, and evolutionarily conserved protein structural motif that is capable of performing a wide variety of functions contributing to normal cell and tissue physiology."
https://openalex.org/W2067557219,"Reaping Gain from Decay In photovoltaic devices, absorbed light excites electrons into a conduction band and thereby initiates electric current flow. Unfortunately, if the energy of the incident photons exceeds the threshold for this excitation (the bandgap), the excess tends to be wasted. Initially, a photon bearing several multiples of the bandgap energy may correspondingly promote several electrons, but before these can begin to travel through a circuit, most of them drop back down to the immobile state, transferring their packet of energy to a lone remaining carrier in a process termed “Auger decay.” Sukhovatkin et al. (p. 1542 ) show that a photoconductive device design can actually leverage the Auger decay process to improve sensitivity in ultraviolet detection. Their detector, a thin film assembled from lead sulfide quantum dots, improves its response by up to a factor of four when the incident light frequency rises to several multiples of the bandgap."
https://openalex.org/W1968140045,"We report here homologous recombination (HR)-mediated gene targeting of two different genes in human iPS cells (hiPSCs) and human ES cells (hESCs). HR-mediated correction of a chromosomally integrated mutant GFP reporter gene reaches efficiencies of 0.14%–0.24% in both cell types transfected by donor DNA with plasmids expressing zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs). Engineered ZFNs that induce a sequence-specific double-strand break in the GFP gene enhanced HR-mediated correction by > 1400-fold without detectable alterations in stem cell karyotypes or pluripotency. Efficient HR-mediated insertional mutagenesis was also achieved at the endogenous PIG-A locus, with a > 200-fold enhancement by ZFNs targeted to that gene. Clonal PIG-A null hESCs and iPSCs with normal karyotypes were readily obtained. The phenotypic and biological defects were rescued by PIG-A transgene expression. Our study provides the first demonstration of HR-mediated gene targeting in hiPSCs and shows the power of ZFNs for inducing specific genetic modifications in hiPSCs, as well as hESCs."
https://openalex.org/W1987936728,"A Change in the Air? Between around 1.2 million and 500,000 years ago, Earth's glacial cycle changed from one with a period of roughly 40,000 years to one with a period of about 100,000 years. Although there has been much speculation about why this transition may have occurred, no potential explanation seemed more likely than that it was caused by decreasing concentrations of atmospheric CO 2 . Hönisch et al. (p. 1551 ) present a record of atmospheric p CO 2 for the past 2.1 million years, derived from the boron isotopic composition of planktonic foraminifera, and show that the amount of CO 2 in the atmosphere has remained relatively constant over that period. While p CO 2 was approximately 30 ppm higher before the start of the mid-Pleistocene transition than after the transition, atmospheric CO 2 did not decrease gradually as would be expected were it to be the driver of the transition."
https://openalex.org/W2031094958,"Most antianxiety drugs (anxiolytics) work by modulating neurotransmitters in the brain. Benzodiazepines are fast and effective anxiolytic drugs; however, their long-term use is limited by the development of tolerance and withdrawal symptoms. Ligands of the translocator protein [18 kilodaltons (kD)] may promote the synthesis of endogenous neurosteroids, which also exert anxiolytic effects in animal models. Here, we found that the translocator protein (18 kD) ligand XBD173 enhanced gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated neurotransmission and counteracted induced panic attacks in rodents in the absence of sedation and tolerance development. XBD173 also exerted antipanic activity in humans and, in contrast to benzodiazepines, did not cause sedation or withdrawal symptoms. Thus, translocator protein (18 kD) ligands are promising candidates for fast-acting anxiolytic drugs with less severe side effects than benzodiazepines."
https://openalex.org/W2011181634,"Cooling Down Some aerosols, such as sulfates, reflect solar radiation and have a cooling effect on climate, while others, such as black carbon, have a warming effect because they absorb solar radiation. The preponderance of reflective aerosols causes the net effect to be one of cooling, but the amount of cooling is uncertain, owing to a large difference in estimates of the effect of aerosols in global aerosol models compared with estimates based on observations. Myhre (p. 187 , published online 18 June; see the Perspective by Quaas ) uses a combination of observational data and modeling to reconcile the two approaches, drawing particular attention to relative increases in the aerosol fraction of black carbon. Taken together, the results suggest a best estimate of the cooling effect of aerosols that is 60% of previous reports."
https://openalex.org/W1995354490,"Recent studies indicate that regulation of cellular oxidative capacity through enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis may be beneficial for neuronal recovery and survival in human neurodegenerative disorders. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) has been shown to be a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and cellular energy metabolism in muscle and liver. The aim of our study was to establish whether PGC-1alpha and PGC-1beta control mitochondrial density also in neurons and if these coactivators could be up-regulated by deacetylation. The results demonstrate that PGC-1alpha and PGC-1beta control mitochondrial capacity in an additive and independent manner. This effect was observed in all studied subtypes of neurons, in cortical, midbrain, and cerebellar granule neurons. We also observed that endogenous neuronal PGC-1alpha but not PGC-1beta could be activated through its repressor domain by suppressing it. Results demonstrate also that overexpression of SIRT1 deacetylase or suppression of GCN5 acetyltransferase activates transcriptional activity of PGC-1alpha in neurons and increases mitochondrial density. These effects were mediated exclusively via PGC-1alpha, since overexpression of SIRT1 or suppression of GCN5 was ineffective where PGC-1alpha was suppressed by short hairpin RNA. Moreover, the results demonstrate that overexpression of PGC-1beta or PGC-1alpha or activation of the latter by SIRT1 protected neurons from mutant alpha-synuclein- or mutant huntingtin-induced mitochondrial loss. These evidences demonstrate that activation or overexpression of the PGC-1 family of coactivators could be used to compensate for neuronal mitochondrial loss and suggest that therapeutic agents activating PGC-1 would be valuable for treating neurodegenerative diseases in which mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage play an important pathogenic role."
https://openalex.org/W2047757182,"The peripheral nervous system detects different somatosensory stimuli, including pain, temperature, and touch. Merkel cell-neurite complexes are touch receptors composed of sensory afferents and Merkel cells. The role that Merkel cells play in light-touch responses has been the center of controversy for over 100 years. We used Cre-loxP technology to conditionally delete the transcription factor Atoh1 from the body skin and foot pads of mice. Merkel cells are absent from these areas in Atoh1(CKO) animals. Ex vivo skin/nerve preparations from Atoh1(CKO) animals demonstrate complete loss of the characteristic neurophysiologic responses normally mediated by Merkel cell-neurite complexes. Merkel cells are, therefore, required for the proper encoding of Merkel receptor responses, suggesting that these cells form an indispensible part of the somatosensory system."
https://openalex.org/W2011823154,"Bringing Back the Large Blue Flagship endangered species, such as the Large Blue butterfly have driven conservation programs worldwide. However, the Large Blue butterfly ( Maculinea arion ) became extinct in the United Kingdom. The apparent driver of this extinction was a complex set of events documented by Thomas et al. (p. 80 , published online 18 June; see the Perspective by Settele and Kühn ). Life-tables and modeling demonstrate how ecological changes, affecting multiple species, cascaded to negatively impact Large Blue populations. When the changes that cause these extinctions were addressed, reintroduction efforts proved successful. Other insects have experienced similar declines and, hopefully, on sites where their known resources remain abundant, a similar approach may be applied."
https://openalex.org/W1981076667,"Extended Spectrum β-Lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae started to appear in the 1980s, and have since emerged as some of the most significant hospital-acquired infections with Escherichia coli and Klebsiella being main players. More than 100 different ESBL types have been described, the most widespread being the CTX-M β-lactamase enzymes (blaCTX-M genes). This study focuses on the zoonotic dissemination of ESBL bacteria, mainly CTX-M type, in the southern coastal region of France. We found that the level of general antibiotic resistance in single randomly selected E. coli isolates from wild Yellow-legged Gulls in France was high. Nearly half the isolates (47,1%) carried resistance to one or more antibiotics (in a panel of six antibiotics), and resistance to tetracycline, ampicillin and streptomycin was most widespread. In an ESBL selective screen, 9,4% of the gulls carried ESBL producing bacteria and notably, 6% of the gulls carried bacteria harboring CTX-M-1 group of ESBL enzymes, a recently introduced and yet the most common clinical CTX-M group in France. Multi locus sequence type and phylogenetic group designations were established for the ESBL isolates, revealing that birds and humans share E. coli populations. Several ESBL producing E. coli isolated from birds were identical to or clustered with isolates with human origin. Hence, wild birds pick up E. coli of human origin, and with human resistance traits, and may accordingly also act as an environmental reservoir and melting pot of bacterial resistance with a potential to re-infect human populations."
https://openalex.org/W1964585075,"Minimally Acidic Acidity is usually construed in the context of a bulk liquid solvent: billions of trillions of molecules such as HCl, added to hundreds of billions of trillions of water molecules. What happens under sparser conditions, for example, in atmospheric or interstellar environments, when a single HCl molecule might interact with just three or four water molecules? Gutberlet et al. (p. 1545 ; see the Perspective by Zwier ) explored this question using theoretical simulations together with vibrational spectroscopy in ultracold helium droplets that effectively isolated small aqueous HCl clusters. HCl remained intact upon solvation by one, two, or three water molecules. Dissociation into an ion pair, as occurs in bulk water, required the approach of a fourth water molecule and was facilitated by the geometry of the existing (H 2 O) 3 cluster."
https://openalex.org/W2137734744,"Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune disease where controversy on Th1/Th2 balance dominates. We investigated whether the recently discovered Th17 pattern was present in SSc.Patients were subdivided as having limited cutaneous SSc (lcSSc, n = 12) or diffuse cutaneous SSc (dcSSc, n = 24). A further arbitrary subdivision was made between early dcSSc (n = 11) and late dcSSc (n = 13) based upon the duration of disease. As a comparator group 14 healthy controls were studied. CD3+ cells were isolated using FACS and subsequently studied for the expression of CD4, CD8, CD25, CD45Ro, CD45Ra, IL-23, GITR, CD69 and intracellular expression of IL-17, TGFbeta and IFNgamma using flow cytometry. Levels of IL-17, IL-6, IL-1alpha and IL-23 were measured using Bioplex assays. SSc patients had more and more activated CD4+ cells. In addition, CD4, CD45Ro and CD45Ra cells from all SSc patients highly expressed the IL23R, which was associated with a higher IL-17 expression as well. In contrast, IFNgamma and TGFbeta were selectively up regulated in SSc subsets. In line with these observation, circulating levels of IL-17 inducing cytokines IL-6, IL-23 and IL-1alpha were increased in all or subsets of SSc patients.The combination of IL-17, IFNgamma and TGFbeta levels in CD45Ro and CD45Ra cells from SSc patients is useful to distinguish between lSSc, ldSSc or edSSc. Blocking Th17 inducing cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-23 may provide a useful tool to intervene in the progression of SSc."
https://openalex.org/W2024918307,"Sunspots Before Your Eyes Sunspots have a dark central region, the umbra, surrounded by a region of lighter radial filaments, the penumbra, along which there are outward horizontal mass flows that are still not fully understood despite their discovery 100 years ago. Now Rempel et al. (p. 171 , published online 18 June; see the Perspective by Scharmer ) present comprehensive numerical simulations of a pair of sunspots that show the development of an outer penumbra with systematic radial outflows along channels of nearly horizontal magnetic field in regions where the average field inclination is greater than 45 degrees. The outflows result from rising hot plasma that turns over and is guided outward by the strong and inclined magnetic field. The simulations reproduce observed properties throughout the entire penumbra and show that the penumbral structure and outflows in sunspots can be understood in terms of convective flow in a magnetic field with varying inclination."
https://openalex.org/W2034083929,"To compare expert assessment with bibliometric indicators as tools to assess the quality and importance of scientific research papers.Shortly after their publication in 2005, the quality and importance of a cohort of nearly 700 Wellcome Trust (WT) associated research papers were assessed by expert reviewers; each paper was reviewed by two WT expert reviewers. After 3 years, we compared this initial assessment with other measures of paper impact.Shortly after publication, 62 (9%) of the 687 research papers were determined to describe at least a 'major addition to knowledge' -6 were thought to be 'landmark' papers. At an aggregate level, after 3 years, there was a strong positive association between expert assessment and impact as measured by number of citations and F1000 rating. However, there were some important exceptions indicating that bibliometric measures may not be sufficient in isolation as measures of research quality and importance, and especially not for assessing single papers or small groups of research publications.When attempting to assess the quality and importance of research papers, we found that sole reliance on bibliometric indicators would have led us to miss papers containing important results as judged by expert review. In particular, some papers that were highly rated by experts were not highly cited during the first three years after publication. Tools that link expert peer reviews of research paper quality and importance to more quantitative indicators, such as citation analysis would be valuable additions to the field of research assessment and evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W2137113910,"Background Since the pioneering study by Rosch and colleagues in the 70s, it is commonly agreed that basic level perceptual categories (dog, chair…) are accessed faster than superordinate ones (animal, furniture…). Nevertheless, the speed at which objects presented in natural images can be processed in a rapid go/no-go visual superordinate categorization task has challenged this “basic level advantage”. Principal Findings Using the same task, we compared human processing speed when categorizing natural scenes as containing either an animal (superordinate level), or a specific animal (bird or dog, basic level). Human subjects require an additional 40–65 ms to decide whether an animal is a bird or a dog and most errors are induced by non-target animals. Indeed, processing time is tightly linked with the type of non-targets objects. Without any exemplar of the same superordinate category to ignore, the basic level category is accessed as fast as the superordinate category, whereas the presence of animal non-targets induces both an increase in reaction time and a decrease in accuracy. Conclusions and Significance These results support the parallel distributed processing theory (PDP) and might reconciliate controversial studies recently published. The visual system can quickly access a coarse/abstract visual representation that allows fast decision for superordinate categorization of objects but additional time-consuming visual analysis would be necessary for a decision at the basic level based on more detailed representations."
https://openalex.org/W2051601543,"Extinction Distinction The Triassic-Jurassic extinction approximately 200 million years ago is one of the five major extinctions in Earth's history. It has been primarily recognized through the loss of marine species, as well as the subsequent emergence of dinosaurs, but its pace, both on land and in sea, has been unclear. McElwain et al. (p. 1554 ) now provide evidence from the plant fossil record from rocks in East Greenland. The total number of taxa and the number of common taxa decreased across the extinction boundary. The decrease was fairly abrupt and seemed to coincide with a period with increased atmospheric CO 2 levels."
https://openalex.org/W2081858593,"Previous studies have shown that plants often have species-specific effects on soil properties. In high elevation forests in the Southern Rocky Mountains, North America, areas that are dominated by a single tree species are often adjacent to areas dominated by another tree species. Here, we assessed soil properties beneath adjacent stands of trembling aspen, lodgepole pine, and Engelmann spruce, which are dominant tree species in this region and are distributed widely in North America. We hypothesized that soil properties would differ among stands dominated by different tree species and expected that aspen stands would have higher soil temperatures due to their open structure, which, combined with higher quality litter, would result in increased soil respiration rates, nitrogen availability, and microbial biomass, and differences in soil faunal community composition.We assessed soil physical, chemical, and biological properties at four sites where stands of aspen, pine, and spruce occurred in close proximity to one-another in the San Juan Mountains, Colorado. Leaf litter quality differed among the tree species, with the highest nitrogen (N) concentration and lowest lignin:N in aspen litter. Nitrogen concentration was similar in pine and spruce litter, but lignin:N was highest in pine litter. Soil temperature and moisture were highest in aspen stands, which, in combination with higher litter quality, probably contributed to faster soil respiration rates from stands of aspen. Soil carbon and N content, ammonium concentration, and microbial biomass did not differ among tree species, but nitrate concentration was highest in aspen soil and lowest in spruce soil. In addition, soil fungal, bacterial, and nematode community composition and rotifer, collembolan, and mesostigmatid mite abundance differed among the tree species, while the total abundance of nematodes, tardigrades, oribatid mites, and prostigmatid mites did not.Although some soil characteristics were unaffected by tree species identity, our results clearly demonstrate that these dominant tree species are associated with soils that differ in several physical, chemical, and biotic properties. Ongoing environmental changes in this region, e.g. changes in fire regime, frequency of insect outbreaks, changes in precipitation patterns and snowpack, and land-use change, may alter the relative abundance of these tree species over coming decades, which in turn will likely alter the soils."
https://openalex.org/W2170273827,"Glioblastoma are rapidly proliferating brain tumors in which hypoxia is readily recognizable, as indicated by focal or extensive necrosis and vascular proliferation, two independent diagnostic criteria for glioblastoma. Gene expression profiling of glioblastoma revealed a gene expression signature associated with hypoxia-regulated genes. The correlated gene set emerging from unsupervised analysis comprised known hypoxia-inducible genes involved in angiogenesis and inflammation such as VEGF and BIRC3, respectively. The relationship between hypoxia-modulated angiogenic genes and inflammatory genes was associated with outcome in our cohort of glioblastoma patients treated within prospective clinical trials of combined chemoradiotherapy. The hypoxia regulation of several new genes comprised in this cluster including ZNF395, TNFAIP3, and TREM1 was experimentally confirmed in glioma cell lines and primary monocytes exposed to hypoxia in vitro. Interestingly, the cluster seems to characterize differential response of tumor cells, stromal cells and the macrophage/microglia compartment to hypoxic conditions. Most genes classically associated with the inflammatory compartment are part of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway including TNFAIP3 and BIRC3 that have been shown to be involved in resistance to chemotherapy. Our results associate hypoxia-driven tumor response with inflammation in glioblastoma, hence underlining the importance of tumor-host interaction involving the inflammatory compartment."
https://openalex.org/W2042145659,"Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) is a strategy to reduce mortality and morbidity in children under 5 years by improving case management of common and serious illnesses at primary health care level, and was adopted in South Africa in 1997. We report an evaluation of IMCI implementation in two provinces of South Africa.Seventy-seven IMCI trained health workers were randomly selected and observed in 74 health facilities; 1357 consultations were observed between May 2006 and January 2007. Each health worker was observed for up to 20 consultations with sick children presenting consecutively to the facility, each child was then reassessed by an IMCI expert to determine the correct findings. Observed health workers had been trained in IMCI for an average of 32.2 months, and were observed for a mean of 17.7 consultations; 50/77(65%) HW's had received a follow up visit after training. In most cases health workers used IMCI to assess presenting symptoms but did not implement IMCI comprehensively. All but one health worker referred to IMCI guidelines during the period of observation. 9(12%) observed health workers checked general danger signs in every child, and 14(18%) assessed all the main symptoms in every child. 51/109(46.8%) children with severe classifications were correctly identified. Nutritional status was not classified in 567/1357(47.5%) children.Health workers are implementing IMCI, but assessments were frequently incomplete, and children requiring urgent referral were missed. If coverage of key child survival interventions is to be improved, interventions are required to ensure competency in identifying specific signs and to encourage comprehensive assessments of children by IMCI practitioners. The role of supervision in maintaining health worker skills needs further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2066681187,"Mutations that cause a reduction in protein kinase A (PKA) activity have been shown to extend lifespan in yeast. Loss of function of mammalian RIIβ, a regulatory subunit of PKA expressed in brain and adipose tissue, results in mice that are lean and insulin sensitive. It was therefore hypothesized that RIIB null (RIIβ−/−) mice would express anti-aging phenotypes. We conducted lifespan studies using 40 mutant and 40 wild type (WT) littermates of equal gender numbers and found that both the median and maximum lifespans were significantly increased in mutant males compared to WT littermates. The median lifespan was increased from 884 days to 1005 days (p = 0.006 as determined by the log rank test) and the 80% lifespan (defined here as 80% deaths) was increased from 941 days to 1073 days (p = 0.004 as determined by the Wang-Allison test). There was no difference in either median or 80% lifespan in female genotypes. WT mice of both genders became increasingly obese with age, while mutant mice maintained their lean phenotype into old age. Adiposity was found to correlate with lifespan for males only. 50% of male mice between 30 and 35 g, corresponding to about 5% body fat, for either genotype lived over 1000 days. No male mouse outside of this weight range achieved this lifespan. During their last month of life, WT mice began losing weight (a total of 8% and 15% of body weight was lost for males and females, respectively), but RIIβ−/− male mice maintained their lean body mass to end of life. This attenuation of decline was not seen in female mutant mice. Old male mutant mice were insulin sensitive throughout their life. Both genders showed modestly lower blood glucose levels in old mutants compared to WT. Male mutants were also resistant to age-induced fatty liver. Pathological assessment of tissues from end of life male mutant mice showed a decrease in tumor incidence, decreased severity of renal lesions, and a trend towards a decrease in age-related cardiac pathology. These findings help establish the highly conserved nature of PKA and suggest that disruption of PKA affects physiological mechanisms known to be associated with healthy aging."
https://openalex.org/W2079786231,"Dominantly inherited mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 gene (LRRK2) are the most common cause of familial Parkinson's disease (PD) and have also been identified in individuals with sporadic PD. Although the exact cellular function of LRRK2 remains unknown, most PD-linked mutations appear to be toxic to cells in culture via mechanisms that depend on the kinase activity of LRRK2 or on the formation of cytoplasmic inclusions. Here we show that the E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP physically associates with LRRK2 and regulates the cellular abundance of LRRK2. We further show that LRRK2 forms a complex with overexpressed and endogenous CHIP and Hsp90. Our data indicates that the destabilization of LRRK2 by CHIP is due to ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation. Hsp90 can attenuate CHIP-mediated degradation and this can be blocked by the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin. These findings provide important insight into the cellular regulation of LRRK2 stability and may lead to the development of therapeutics to treat PD based on controlling LRRK2 stability."
https://openalex.org/W2122107232,"Organophosphonates such as isopropyl metylphosphonofluoridate (sarin) are extremely toxic as they phosphonylate the catalytic serine residue of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), an enzyme essential to humans and other species. Design of effective AChE reactivators as antidotes to various organophosphonates requires information on how the reactivators interact with the phosphonylated AChEs. However, such information has not been available hitherto because of three main challenges. First, reactivators are generally flexible in order to change from the ground state to the transition state for reactivation; this flexibility discourages determination of crystal structures of AChE in complex with effective reactivators that are intrinsically disordered. Second, reactivation occurs upon binding of a reactivator to the phosphonylated AChE. Third, the phosphorous conjugate can develop resistance to reactivation. We have identified crystallographic conditions that led to the determination of a crystal structure of the sarin(nonaged)-conjugated mouse AChE in complex with [(E)-[1-[(4-carbamoylpyridin-1-ium-1-yl)methoxymethyl]pyridin-2-ylidene]methyl]-oxoazanium dichloride (HI-6) at a resolution of 2.2 A. In this structure, the carboxyamino-pyridinium ring of HI-6 is sandwiched by Tyr124 and Trp286, however, the oxime-pyridinium ring is disordered. By combining crystallography with microsecond molecular dynamics simulation, we determined the oxime-pyridinium ring structure, which shows that the oxime group of HI-6 can form a hydrogen-bond network to the sarin isopropyl ether oxygen, and a water molecule is able to form a hydrogen bond to the catalytic histidine residue and subsequently deprotonates the oxime for reactivation. These results offer insights into the reactivation mechanism of HI-6 and design of better reactivators."
https://openalex.org/W1984732209,"Previous studies have shown that plant mitochondrial movements are myosin-based along actin filaments, which undergo continuous turnover by the exchange of actin subunits from existing filaments. Although earlier studies revealed that actin filament dynamics are essential for many functions of the actin cytoskeleton, there are little data connecting actin dynamics and mitochondrial movements.We addressed the role of actin filament dynamics in the control of mitochondrial movements by treating cells with various pharmaceuticals that affect actin filament assembly and disassembly. Confocal microscopy of Arabidopsis thaliana root hairs expressing GFP-FABD2 as an actin filament reporter showed that mitochondrial distribution was in agreement with the arrangement of actin filaments in root hairs at different developmental stages. Analyses of mitochondrial trajectories and instantaneous velocities immediately following pharmacological perturbation of the cytoskeleton using variable-angle evanescent wave microscopy and/or spinning disk confocal microscopy revealed that mitochondrial velocities were regulated by myosin activity and actin filament dynamics. Furthermore, simultaneous visualization of mitochondria and actin filaments suggested that mitochondrial positioning might involve depolymerization of actin filaments on the surface of mitochondria.Base on these results we propose a mechanism for the regulation of mitochondrial speed of movements, positioning, and direction of movements that combines the coordinated activity of myosin and the rate of actin turnover, together with microtubule dynamics, which directs the positioning of actin polymerization events."
https://openalex.org/W2084733358,"The innate immune response provides a first line of defense against pathogens by targeting generic differential features that are present in foreign organisms but not in the host. These innate responses generate selection forces acting both in pathogens and hosts that further determine their co-evolution. Here we analyze the nucleic acid sequence fingerprints of these selection forces acting in parallel on both host innate immune genes and ssRNA viral genomes. We do this by identifying dinucleotide biases in the coding regions of innate immune response genes in plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and then use this signal to identify other significant host innate immune genes. The persistence of these biases in the orthologous groups of genes in humans and chickens is also examined. We then compare the significant motifs in highly expressed genes of the innate immune system to those in ssRNA viruses and study the evolution of these motifs in the H1N1 influenza genome. We argue that the significant under-represented motif pattern of CpG in an AU context - which is found in both the ssRNA viruses and innate genes, and has decreased throughout the history of H1N1 influenza replication in humans - is immunostimulatory and has been selected against during the co-evolution of viruses and host innate immune genes. This shows how differences in host immune biology can drive the evolution of viruses that jump into species with different immune priorities than the original host."
https://openalex.org/W2126811087,"The aortic heart valve undergoes geometric and mechanical changes over time. The cusps of a normal, healthy valve thicken and become less extensible over time. In the disease calcific aortic stenosis (CAS), calcified nodules progressively stiffen the cusps. The local mechanical changes in the cusps, due to either normal aging or pathological processes, affect overall function of the valve. In this paper, we propose a computational model for the aging aortic valve that connects local changes to overall valve function. We extend a previous model for the healthy valve to describe aging. To model normal/uncomplicated aging, leaflet thickness and extensibility are varied versus age according to experimental data. To model calcification, initial sites are defined and a simple growth law is assumed. The nodules then grow over time, so that the area of calcification increases from one model to the next model representing greater age. Overall valve function is recorded for each individual model to yield a single simulation of valve function over time. This simulation is the first theoretical tool to describe the temporal behavior of aortic valve calcification. The ability to better understand and predict disease progression will aid in design and timing of patient treatments for CAS."
https://openalex.org/W2037997125,"Networks of protein-protein interactions play key roles in numerous important biological processes in living subjects. An effective methodology to assess protein-protein interactions in living cells of interest is protein-fragment complement assay (PCA). Particularly the assays using fluorescent proteins are powerful techniques, but they do not directly track interactions because of its irreversibility or the time for chromophore formation. By contrast, PCAs using bioluminescent proteins can overcome these drawbacks. We herein describe an imaging method for real-time analysis of protein-protein interactions using multicolor luciferases with different spectral characteristics. The sensitivity and signal-to-background ratio were improved considerably by developing a carboxy-terminal fragment engineered from a click beetle luciferase. We demonstrate its utility in spatiotemporal characterization of Smad1-Smad4 and Smad2-Smad4 interactions in early developing stages of a single living Xenopus laevis embryo. We also describe the value of this method by application of specific protein-protein interactions in cell cultures and living mice. This technique supports quantitative analyses and imaging of versatile protein-protein interactions with a selective luminescence wavelength in opaque or strongly auto-fluorescent living subjects."
https://openalex.org/W2158209480,"Apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1/redox effector factor-1 (APE1/Ref-1) is a ubiquitous multifunctional protein that possesses both DNA-repair and redox regulatory activities. Although it was originally identified as a DNA-repair enzyme, accumulating evidence supports a role of APE1/Ref-1 in tumor development. To investigate association between APE1/ Ref-1 polymorphisms and lung cancer risk in Chinese populations, we first genotyped three variants of APE1/ Ref-1 and found a -141 T-to-G variant (rs1760944) in the promoter associated with decreased risk of lung cancer [odds ratio (OR) = 0.62 for GG;P=0.043]. Similar results were obtained in a follow-up replication study. Combined data from the two studies comprising a total of 1072 lung cancer patients and 1064 cancer-free control participants generated a more significant association (P= 0.002). We observed lower APE1/Ref-1 mRNA levels in the presence of the protective G allele in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and normal lung tissues. The - 141G-allele-promoter construct exhibited decreased luciferase reporter gene expression. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and surface plasmon resonance analysis showed that the — 141G allele impaired the binding affinity of some transcription factor, accounting for lower APE1/Ref-1-promoter activity. Supershift assays further revealed that the protein of interest was octamer-binding transcription factor-1 (Oct-1). Chromatin immunoprecipitation reconfirmed binding of Oct-1 to the APE1/Ref-1 — 141-promoter region. We also found that Oct-1 conferred attenuated transactivation capacity toward the — 141G variant by exogenously introducing Oct-1. These data indicate that genetic variations in APE1/Ref-1 may modify susceptibility to lung cancer and provide new insights into an unexpected effect of APE1/Ref-1 on lung carcinogenesis.—Lu, J., Zhang, S., Chen, D., Wang, H., Wu, W., Wang, X., Lei, Y., Wang, J., Qian, J., Fan, W., Hu, Z., Jin, L., Shen, H., Huang, W., Wei, Q., Lu, D.

The attempts to use synthetic antioxidants to block the detrimental effects of ROS have produced mixed or negative results precipitating the interest in natural products. Blueberries are readily available product with the highest antioxidant capacity among fruits and vegetables.Following 3-mo of BD or a regular control diet (CD), the threshold for mitochondrial permeability transition (t(MPT)) was measured in isolated cardiomyocytes obtained from young male Fischer-344 rats. Compared to CD, BD resulted in a 24% increase (p<0.001) of ROS indexed t(MPT). The remaining animals were subjected to a permanent ligation of the left descending coronary artery. 24 hrs later resulting myocardial infarction (MI) in rats on BD was 22% less than in CD rats (p<0.01). Significantly less TUNEL(+) cardiomyocytes (2% vs 9%) and 40% less inflammation cells were observed in the myocardial area at risk of BD compared to CD rats (p<0.01). In the subgroup of rats, after coronary ligation the original diet was either continued or switched to the opposite one, and cardiac remodeling and MI expansion were followed by serial echocardiography for 10 weeks. Measurements suggested that continuation of BD or its withdrawal after MI attenuated or accelerated rates of post MI cardiac remodeling and MI expansion.A blueberry-enriched diet protected the myocardium from induced ischemic damage and demonstrated the potential to attenuate the development of post MI chronic heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W2000144844,"Malignant Pleural Effusions (MPE) may be useful as a model to study hierarchical progression of cancer and/or intratumoral heterogeneity. To strengthen the rationale for developing the MPE-model for these purposes, we set out to find evidence for the presence of cancer stem cells (CSC) in MPE and demonstrate an ability to sustain intratumoral heterogeneity in MPE-primary cultures. Our studies show that candidate lung CSC-expression signatures (PTEN, OCT4, hTERT, Bmi1, EZH2 and SUZ12) are evident in cell pellets isolated from MPE, and MPE-cytopathology also labels candidate-CSC (CD44, cMET, MDR-1, ALDH) subpopulations. Moreover, in primary cultures that use MPE as the source of both tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME), candidate CSC are maintained over time. This allows us to live-sort candidate CSC-fractions from the MPE-tumor mix on the basis of surface markers (CD44, c-MET, uPAR, MDR-1) or differences in xenobiotic metabolism (ALDH). Thus, MPE-primary cultures provide an avenue to extract candidate CSC populations from individual (isogenic) MPE-tumors. This will allow us to test whether these cells can be discriminated in functional bioassays. Tumor heterogeneity in MPE-primary cultures is evidenced by variable immunolabeling, differences in colony-morphology, and differences in proliferation rates of cell subpopulations. Collectively, these data justify the ongoing development of the MPE-model for the investigation of intratumoral heterogeneity, tumor-TME interactions, and phenotypic validation of candidate lung CSC, in addition to providing direction for the pre-clinical development of rational therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2068963175,"Background Eosinophils are effector cells during parasitic infections and allergic responses. However, their contribution to innate immunity has been only recently unravelled. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we show that human eosinophils express CD3 and γδ T Cell Receptor (TCR) but not αβ TCR. Surface expression of γδTCR/CD3 is heterogeneous between eosinophil donors and inducible by mycobacterial ligands. Surface immunoprecipitation revealed expression of the full γδTCR/CD3 complex. Real-time PCR amplification for CD3, γ and δ TCR constant regions transcripts showed a significantly lower expression in eosinophils than in γδT cells. Limited TCR rearrangements occur in eosinophils as shown by spectratyping analysis of CDR3 length profiles and in situ hybridization. Release by eosinophils of Reactive Oxygen Species, granule proteins, Eosinophil Peroxidase and Eosinophil-Derived Neurotoxin and cytokines (IFN-γ and TNF-α) was observed following activation by γδTCR-specific agonists or by mycobacteria. These effects were inhibited by anti-γδTCR blocking antibodies and antagonists. Moreover, γδTCR/CD3 was involved in eosinophil cytotoxicity against tumor cells. Conclusions/Significance Our results provide evidence that human eosinophils express a functional γδTCR/CD3 with similar, but not identical, characteristics to γδTCR from γδT cells. We propose that this receptor contributes to eosinophil innate responses against mycobacteria and tumors and may represent an additional link between lymphoid and myeloid lineages."
https://openalex.org/W2103221071,"Direct molecular imaging of nano-spatial relationship between T cell receptor (TCR)/CD3 and CD4 or CD8 co-receptor before and after activation of a primary T cell has not been reported. We have recently innovated application of near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) and immune-labeling quantum dots (QD) to image Ag-specific TCR response during in vivo clonal expansion, and now up-graded the NSOM/QD-based nanotechnology through dipole-polarization and dual-color imaging. Using this imaging system scanning cell-membrane molecules at a best-optical lateral resolution, we demonstrated that CD3, CD4 or CD8 molecules were distinctly distributed as single QD-bound molecules or nano-clusters equivalent to 2-4 QD fluorescence-intensity/size on cell-membrane of un-stimulated primary T cells, and approximately 6-10% of CD3 were co-clustering with CD4 or CD8 as 70-110 nm nano-clusters without forming nano-domains. The ligation of TCR/CD3 on CD4 or CD8 T cells led to CD3 nanoscale co-clustering or interaction with CD4 or CD8 co-receptors forming 200-500 nm nano-domains or >500 nm micro-domains. Such nano-spatial co-clustering of CD3 and CD4 or CD3 and CD8 appeared to be an intrinsic event of TCR/CD3 ligation, not purely limited to MHC engagement, and be driven by Lck phosphorylation. Importantly, CD28 co-stimulation remarkably enhanced TCR/CD3 nanoscale co-clustering or interaction with CD4 co-receptor within nano- or micro-domains on the membrane. In contrast, CD28 co-stimulation did not enhance CD8 clustering or CD3-CD8 co-clustering in nano-domains although it increased molecular number and density of CD3 clustering in the enlarged nano-domains. These nanoscale findings provide new insights into TCR/CD3 interaction with CD4 or CD8 co-receptor in T-cell activation."
https://openalex.org/W1988301067,"Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) are involved in the regulation of distinct critical cellular processes. Ubiquitin C-terminal Hydrolase L1 (UCH L1) has been linked to several neurological diseases as well as human cancer, but the physiological targets and the regulation of UCH L1 expression in vivo have been largely unexplored. Here we demonstrate that UCH L1 up-regulates β-catenin/TCF signaling: UCH L1 forms endogenous complexes with β-catenin, stabilizes it and up-regulates β-catenin/TCF-dependent transcription. We also show that, reciprocally, β-catenin/TCF signaling up-regulates expression of endogenous UCH L1 mRNA and protein. Moreover, using ChIP assay and direct mutagenesis we identify two TCF4-binding sites on the uch l1 promoter that are involved in this regulation. Since the expression and deubiquitinating activity of UCH L1 are required for its own basic promoter activity, we propose that UCH L1 up-regulates its expression by activation of the oncogenic β-catenin/TCF signaling in transformed cells."

https://openalex.org/W2012212259,"The nucleus of interphase eukaryotic cell is a highly compartmentalized structure containing the three-dimensional network of chromatin and numerous proteinaceous subcompartments. DNA viruses induce profound changes in the intranuclear structures of their host cells. We are applying a combination of confocal imaging including photobleaching microscopy and computational methods to analyze the modifications of nuclear architecture and dynamics in parvovirus infected cells. Upon canine parvovirus infection, expansion of the viral replication compartment is accompanied by chromatin marginalization to the vicinity of the nuclear membrane. Dextran microinjection and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) studies revealed the homogeneity of this compartment. Markedly, in spite of increase in viral DNA content of the nucleus, a significant increase in the protein mobility was observed in infected compared to non-infected cells. Moreover, analyzis of the dynamics of photoactivable capsid protein demonstrated rapid intranuclear dynamics of viral capsids. Finally, quantitative FRAP and cellular modelling were used to determine the duration of viral genome replication. Altogether, our findings indicate that parvoviruses modify the nuclear structure and dynamics extensively. Intranuclear crowding of viral components leads to enlargement of the interchromosomal domain and to chromatin marginalization via depletion attraction. In conclusion, parvoviruses provide a useful model system for understanding the mechanisms of virus-induced intranuclear modifications."
https://openalex.org/W2014770093,"Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is causally related to Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), the most common malignancy in untreated individuals with HIV/AIDS. The adaptive T-cell immune response against KSHV has not been fully characterized. To achieve a better understanding of the antigenic repertoire of the CD8 and CD4 T-cell responses against KSHV, we constructed a library of lentiviral expression vectors each coding for one of 31 individual KSHV open reading frames (ORFs). We used these to transduce monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) isolated from 14 KSHV-seropositive (12 HIV-positive) and 7 KSHV-seronegative (4 HIV-positive) individuals. moDCs were transduced with up to 3 KSHV ORFs simultaneously (ORFs grouped according to their expression during the viral life cycle). Transduced moDCs naturally process the KSHV genes and present the resulting antigens in the context of MHC class I and II. Transduced moDCs were cultured with purified autologous T cells and the CD8 and CD4 T-cell proliferative responses to each KSHV ORF (or group) was assessed using a CFSE dye-based assay. Two pools of early lytic KSHV genes ([ORF8/ORF49/ORF61] and [ORF59/ORF65/K4.1]) were frequently-recognized targets of both CD8 and CD4 T cells from KSHV seropositive individuals. One pool of late lytic KSHV genes ([ORF28/ORF36/ORF37]) was a frequently-recognized CD8 target and another pool of late genes ([ORF33/K1/K8.1]) was a frequently-recognized CD4 target. We report that both the CD8 and CD4 T-cell responses against KSHV are skewed towards genes expressed in the early and late phases of the viral lytic cycle, and identify some previously unknown targets of these responses. This knowledge will be important to future immunological investigations into KSHV and may eventually lead to the development of better immunotherapies for KSHV-related diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2042943807,"To better understand how individual genes and experience influence behavior, the role of a single homeotic unit, hoxb4a, was comprehensively analyzed in vivo by clonal and retrograde fluorescent labeling of caudal hindbrain neurons in a zebrafish enhancer-trap YFP line. A quantitative spatiotemporal neuronal atlas showed hoxb4a activity to be highly variable and mosaic in rhombomere 7-8 reticular, motoneuronal and precerebellar nuclei with expression decreasing differentially in all subgroups through juvenile stages. The extensive Hox mosaicism and widespread pleiotropism demonstrate that the same transcriptional protein plays a role in the development of circuits that drive behaviors from autonomic through motor function including cerebellar regulation. We propose that the continuous presence of hoxb4a positive neurons may provide a developmental plasticity for behavior-specific circuits to accommodate experience- and growth-related changes. Hence, the ubiquitous hoxb4a pleitropism and modularity likely offer an adaptable transcriptional element for circuit modification during both growth and evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2004881296,"Background Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells secrete large amounts of glutamate that can trigger AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs). This commonly results in Na+ and Ca2+-permeability and thereby in excitotoxic cell death of the surrounding neurons. Here we investigated how the GBM cells themselves survive in a glutamate-rich environment. Methods and Findings In silico analysis of published reports shows down-regulation of all ionotropic glutamate receptors in GBM as compared to normal brain. In vitro, in all GBM samples tested, mRNA expression of AMPAR subunit GluR1, 2 and 4 was relatively low compared to adult and fetal total brain mRNA and adult cerebellum mRNA. These findings were in line with primary GBM samples, in which protein expression patterns were down-regulated as compared to the normal tissue. Furthermore, mislocalized expression of these receptors was found. Sequence analysis of GluR2 RNA in primary and established GBM cell lines showed that the GluR2 subunit was found to be partly unedited. Conclusions Together with the lack of functional effect of AMPAR inhibition by NBQX our results suggest that down-regulation and afunctionality of AMPARs, enable GBM cells to survive in a high glutamate environment without going into excitotoxic cell death themselves. It can be speculated that specific AMPA receptor inhibitors may protect normal neurons against the high glutamate microenvironment of GBM tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2080347637,"Insertional mutagenesis has emerged as a major obstacle for gene therapy based on vectors that integrate randomly in the genome. Reducing the genotoxicity of genomic viral integration can, in first approximation, be equated with reducing the risk of oncogene activation, at least in the case of therapeutic payloads that have no known oncogenic potential, such as the globin genes. An attractive solution to the problem of oncogene activation is the inclusion of insulators/enhancer-blockers in the viral vectors. In this study we have used Recombinase-Mediated Cassette Exchange to characterize the effect of integration of globin therapeutic cassettes in the presence or absence of the chicken HS4 and three other putative insulators inserted near Stil, Tal1 and MAP17, three well-known cellular proto-oncogenes in the SCL/Tal1 locus. We show that insertion of a Locus Control Region-driven globin therapeutic globin transgene had a dramatic activating effect on Tal1 and Map17, the two closest genes, a minor effect on Stil, and no effect on Cyp4x1, a non-expressed gene. Of the four element tested, cHS4 was the only one that was able to suppress this transgene-mediated insertional transcriptional activation. cHS4 had a strong suppressive effect on the activation expression of Map17 but has little or no effect on expression of Tal1. The suppressive activity of cHS4 is therefore promoter specific. Importantly, the observed suppressive effect of cHS4 on Map17 activation did not depend on its intercalation between the LCR and the Map 17 promoter. Rather, presence of one or two copies of cHS4 anywhere within the transgene was sufficient to almost completely block the activation of Map17. Therefore, at this complex locus, suppression of transgene-mediated insertional transcriptional activation by cHS4 could not be adequately explained by models that predict that cHS4 can only suppress expression through an enhancer-blocking activity that requires intercalation between an enhancer and a promoter. This has important implications for our theoretical understanding of the possible effects of the insertion of cHS4 on gene therapy vectors. We also show that cHS4 decreased the level of expression of the globin transgene. Therefore, the benefits of partially preventing insertional gene activation are in part negated by the lower expression level of the transgene. A cost/benefit analysis of the utility of incorporation of insulators in gene therapy vectors will require further studies in which the effects of insulators on both the therapeutic gene and the flanking genes are determined at a large number of integration sites. Identification of insulators with minimal promoter specificity would also be of great value."
https://openalex.org/W2157080827,"Background The impact of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-7) on antibiotic resistance among pneumococcal strains causing invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) has varied in different locales in the United States. We assessed trends in IPD including trends for IPD caused by penicillin non-susceptible strains before and after licensure of PCV-7 and the impact of the 2008 susceptibility breakpoints for penicillin on the epidemiology of resistance. Methodology/Principal Findings We performed a retrospective review of IPD cases at Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital of NewYork-Presbyterian, Columbia University Medical Center. Subjects were ≤18 years of age with Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from sterile body sites from January 1995–December 2006. The rate of IPD from 1995–1999 versus 2002–2006 significantly decreased from 4.1 (CI95 3.4, 4.8) to 1.7 (CI95 1.3, 2.2) per 1,000 admissions. Using the breakpoints in place during the study period, the proportion of penicillin non-susceptible strains increased from 27% to 49% in the pre- vs. post-PCV-7 era, respectively (p = 0.001), although the rate of IPD caused by non-susceptible strains did not change from 1995–1999 (1.1 per 1,000 admissions, CI95 0.8, 1.5) when compared with 2002–2006 (0.8 per 1,000 admissions, CI95 0.6, 1.2). In the multivariate logistic regression model controlling for the effects of age, strains causing IPD in the post-PCV-7 era were significantly more likely to be penicillin non-susceptible compared with strains in the pre-PCV-7 era (OR 2.46, CI95 1.37, 4.40). However, using the 2008 breakpoints for penicillin, only 8% of strains were non-susceptible in the post-PCV-7 era. Conclusions/Significance To date, there are few reports that document an increase in the relative proportion of penicillin non-susceptible strains of pneumococci causing IPD following the introduction of PCV-7. Active surveillance of pneumococcal serotypes and antibiotic resistance using the new penicillin breakpoints is imperative to assess potential changes in the epidemiology of IPD."
https://openalex.org/W2112598549,"The highland forests of Madagascar are home to some of the world's most unique and diverse flora and fauna and to some of its poorest people. This juxtaposition of poverty and biodiversity is continually reinforced by rapid population growth, which results in increasing pressure on the remaining forest habitat in the highland region, and the biodiversity therein. Here we derive a mathematical expression for the subsistence of households to assess the role of markets and household demography on deforestation near Ranomafana National Park. In villages closest to urban rice markets, households were likely to clear less land than our model predicted, presumably because they were purchasing food at market. This effect was offset by the large number of migrant households who cleared significantly more land between 1989–2003 than did residents throughout the region. Deforestation by migrant households typically occurred after a mean time lag of 9 years. Analyses suggest that while local conservation efforts in Madagascar have been successful at reducing the footprint of individual households, large-scale conservation must rely on policies that can reduce the establishment of new households in remaining forested areas."

Unlike reversible binding, the catalytic function offers a means to permanently inactivate the antigen by its hydrolysis into smaller fragments. Reversibly binding Abs bind the antigen stoichiometrically (e.g. 2 antigen molecules/IgG molecule). As catalysts are reusable, a single catalytic Ab molecule can hydrolyze multiple antigen molecules. This offers the possibility of increased antigen neutralizing potency. Therefore, there is considerable interest in developing catalytic Abs directed to individual polypeptide antigens. The serine protease-like activity is a heritable trait encoded by germline Ab V genes, and Abs in the preimmune repertoire can hydrolyze peptides with diverse sequence promiscuously (13.Gao Q.S. Sun M. Rees A.R. Paul S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 14.Planque S. Bangale Y. Song X.T. Karle S. Taguchi H. Poindexter B. Bick R. Edmundson A.

Biotechnol. 2007; 36: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, the adaptive immune system has evolved to maximize noncovalent binding affinity of Abs over the course of B cell differentiation. Physiological immune mechanisms do not favor retention and improvement of the catalytic function. B cell clonal proliferation is driven by antigen binding to B cell receptors (Abs associated with signal transducing proteins). Antigen hydrolysis by catalytic B cell receptors is followed by release of the antigen fragments, resulting in reduced B cell receptor occupancy and loss of the proliferative stimulus for the cells. Therefore, unlike the noncovalent antigen binding activity, the catalytic function is poorly selectable. Indeed, other than Abs to autoantigen and B cell superantigen substrates, there are no examples of antigen-specific catalytic Abs generated by physiological adaptive mechanisms (18.Paul S. Nishiyama Y. Planque S. Taguchi H. Immunol. Lett. 2006; 103: 8-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Much effort has been devoted to developing antigen-specific catalytic Abs by immune and protein engineering strategies. Based on the premise that binding to the transition state reduces the activation energy of the catalytic reaction, immunization with transition state analogs has been applied to raise Abs that catalyze ester bonds in small haptens (19.Schultz P.G. Yin J. Lerner R.A. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2002; 41: 4427-4437Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Attempts to improve the esterase activity by random mutagenesis followed by isolation of transition state analog-binding Abs have also been described (20.Takahashi N. Kakinuma H. Liu L. Nishi Y. Fujii I. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 563-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Developing antigen-specific proteolytic Abs, however, has been difficult because peptide bond hydrolysis is an energetically demanding reaction. Moreover, there is no viable engineering strategy available to render catalytic Abs specific for individual polypeptide antigens. We (8.Paul S. Li L. Kalaga R. Wilkins-Stevens P. Stevens F.J.

Commun. 1994; 204: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) have identified Ab light chains that hydrolyze peptide bonds promiscuously without participation from the heavy chain subunit. Disruption of the serine protease-like catalytic triad in an Ab light chain by site-directed mutagenesis was without effect on its ability to bind the polypeptide antigen by noncovalent means (13.Gao Q.S. Sun M. Rees A.R. Paul S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and a discrete peptide epitope remote from the bond hydrolyzed by a proteolytic Ab preparation has been identified (25.Paul S. Volle D.J. Powell M.J. Massey R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11910-11913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This lead to a split-site model of proteolysis, in which distinct subsites present within the Ab combining site are responsible for initial noncovalent antigen binding and the ensuing peptide bond hydrolysis reaction (26.Paul S. Mol. Biotechnol. 1996; 5: 197-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). If this model is correct, it should be possible to develop hybrid proteolytic Abs specific for individual antigens by pairing light chains containing a promiscuous catalytic subsite with heavy chains that contribute the noncovalent subsite responsible for specific antigen binding. We describe proof-of-principle for this engineering approach using previously described catalytic light chains paired with the heavy chain of a monoclonal IgG that binds the hepatitis C virus (HCV) E2 coat protein. This protein is thought to be important in viral entry into hepatocytes and B cells by virtue of its ability to bind receptors expressed on the host cells (27.Helle F. Dubuisson J. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 100-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 28.Poumbourios P. Drummer H.E. Antivir. Chem. Chemother. 2007; 18: 169-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). VH and VL cDNA of the anti-E2-IgG1 CBH-7 were prepared by reverse transcriptase-PCR using as template total RNA from hybridoma cells (29.Chan C.H. Hadlock K.G. Foung S.K. Levy S. Blood. 2001; 97: 1023-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). VL cDNAs of light chains HK13, HK14, and GG63 cloned in Escherichia coli were obtained similarly (respectively, GenBankTM accession numbers L43498, L43499, and AF352557) (21.Tyutyulkova S. Gao Q.S. Thompson A. Rennard S. Paul S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1316: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 22.Paul S. Tramontano A. Gololobov G. Zhou Y.X. Taguchi H. Karle S. Nishiyama Y. Planque S. George S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28314-28320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Anti-gp120 VL and VH domain cDNA was prepared from a single chain Fv clone GL2 isolated from a phage library (30.Karle S. Planque S. Nishiyama Y. Taguchi H. Zhou Y.X. Salas M. Lake D. Thiagarajan P. Arnett F. Hanson C.V. Paul S. Aids. 2004; 18: 329-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). VL domains were cloned into the light chain expression vector on the 5′ side of the κ constant domain vector (pLC-huCκ vector; Ref. 31.McLean G.R. Nakouzi A. Casadevall A. Green N.S. Mol. Immunol. 2000; 37: 837-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar and see supplemental Table S1 for PCR primers and method). VH domains were cloned into the heavy chain expression vector on the 5′ side of the γ1 constant domains (CH1, CH2, and CH3 domains; pHC-huCγ vector). To accommodate the EcoRI restriction site needed for cloning, the two N-terminal VH residues were changed from Gln-Val to Glu-Phe. Dideoxynucleotide sequencing of the VL and VH domains in the 5′ and 3′ directions yielded identical sequences corresponding to the parent VL and VH domains. Coexpression of the heavy and light chain vectors in NS0 cells afforded secretion of the desired Abs into the culture supernatant (31.McLean G.R. Nakouzi A. Casadevall A. Green N.S. Mol. Immunol. 2000; 37: 837-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Stable cell lines expressing full-length IgGs were obtained by electroporation of PvuI-linearized pLC-huCκ vectors containing various VL domains (20 μg) into 107 NS0 cells using a BTX ECM830 square wave electroporator in phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm sodium phosphate, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.4; Genetronics; one 15-ms pulse, 250 V). The cells were cultured in 96-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 4.5 g/liter of glucose, 200 mml-glutamine, and 10% IgG-depleted fetal bovine serum (Complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; 5 × 104 cells/well). After 24 h, puromycin (3 μg/ml) was added. Positive transformants were identified by ELISA using immobilized polyclonal anti-human κ Ab for capture of secreted κ light chains (200 ng/well; Sigma) and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human κ chain Ab for detection of bound κ chains (1:1000; Sigma) (32.Karle S.

Vaccine. 2003; 21: 1213-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). pHC-huCγ plasmids containing VH domains were electroporated into κ chain-expressing clones (>0.1 μg/ml) similarly, followed by selection with geneticin (1.5 mg/ml; Invitrogen). IgG expression was determined as above except that detection was with anti-human IgG1 Ab (Fc specific; 1:1000; Sigma). Culture supernatants were concentrated 10-fold (Centriprep YM10; Millipore) and purified by affinity chromatography on immobilized Protein G using a pH 2.7 buffer for elution (14.Planque S. Bangale Y. Song X.T. Karle S. Taguchi H. Poindexter B. Bick R. Edmundson A. Nishiyama Y. Paul S. J. Biol.

Electrophoresis was on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (4–20%; Bio-Rad), followed by electrotransfer to nitrocellulose membranes, staining with peroxidase-conjugated Abs to human IgG (Fc-specific; 1:1000; Sigma) or to κ chains (1:1000; Sigma), and detection with SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) (22.Paul S.

Total proteins were stained with silver nitrate or Coomassie Blue. Band densities were computed using Quantity One image analysis software (33.Paul S. Karle S. Planque S. Taguchi H. Salas M.

Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method using the Coomassie Plus assay kit (Pierce). A stable cell line coexpressing E1 and FLAG-E2 (residues 406–746 of E2 HCV H77 polyprotein with an N-terminal FLAG peptide tag) was prepared by transfection with the plasmid pCDNA3/E1FLAGE2. This plasmid was constructed from vectors kindly provided by Dr. L. Cocquerel (by transferring the 450-bp BamHI/AscI fragment from pTM1/E1FLAGE2 vector containing the C terminus of E1, FLAG tag, and N terminus of E2 to pcDNA3/E1E2 vector containing the e1 and e2 genes (34.Fournillier Jacob A. Cahour A. Escriou N. Girad M. Wychowski C. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 1055-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). After PvuI linearization, pcDNA3/E1FLAGE2 was electroporated into Chinese hamster ovary cells and transformants were selected with geneticin as above in Complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with non-essential amino acids. Lysates containing FLAG-E2 were prepared by treating the cells with 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 (Tris-buffered saline), containing 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm CaCl2, 20 mm iodoacetamide, and a protease inhibitor mixture (35.Cocquerel L. Kuo C.C. Dubuisson J. Levy S. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 10677-10683Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The lysate (40 ml from ∼2 × 108 cells) was fractionated using anti-FLAG M1 Ab conjugated to agarose (0.5 ml of gel; >0.6 mg of FLAG peptide binding capacity/ml of gel; Sigma). Unbound proteins were removed by washing with Tris-buffered saline, 1 m CaCl2 containing 0.1 mm CHAPS. FLAG-E2 was eluted using 100 μg/ml of FLAG peptide (Sigma). This procedure enriched the FLAG-E2 only partially (estimated FLAG-E2 purity, ∼1%, determined by silver staining of SDS-electrophoresis gels). Repeat anti-FLAG or Galanthus nivalis lectin conjugated to agarose chromatography did not yield pure FLAG-E2, presumably because of its hydrophobic character and tendency to associate with other proteins. GST-E2, corresponding to full-length E2 (residues 384–746 of HCV polyprotein) with an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase tag, produced in a baculovirus insect cell expression system was purchased from Immunodiagnostics Inc. The enriched FLAG-E2 preparation (70 ng of FLAG-E2/ml; 1 nm) was incubated with electrophoretically homogenous IgG in 20 μl of 100 mm glycine-HCl, 50 mm Tris, 0.1 mm CHAPS at 37 °C. Following SDS electrophoresis under reducing conditions, the gels were electroblotted and FLAG-E2 was stained with: (a) goat anti-E2 polyclonal IgG (1:2000; BioDesign) followed by peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG (1:1000; Pierce), (b) mouse anti-E2 monoclonal IgG (1:2000; Sigma) followed by peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:2000; Sigma), or (c) peroxidase-conjugated mouse anti-FLAG monoclonal IgG (1:2000; Sigma). The intensity of the intact FLAG-E2 band (68 kDa) was quantified in arbitrary volume units (AVU, pixel intensity × band area) (36.Planque S. Mitsuda Y. Taguchi H. Salas M. Morris M.K. Nishiyama Y. Kyle R. Okhuysen P. Escobar M. Hunter R. Sheppard H.W. Hanson C. Paul S. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 2007; 23: 1541-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis was computed as ((AVUDiluent − AVUIgG) × 100/(AVUDiluent)). Hydrolysis of GST-E2 (10 μg/ml; 130 nm) was determined similarly except that reactions were conducted in buffer containing skim milk (150 μg/ml) and human IgG denatured by boiling for 10 min (150 μg/ml) to preclude adsorptive protein loss on the reaction vessel surface. The intact 72-kDa GST-E2 band was stained with peroxidase-conjugated anti-GST Ab (1:1000; Sigma). For N-terminal sequencing of product bands, GST-E2 incubated with IgG without protein additives was subjected to SDS electrophoresis and the gels electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane were stained with Coomassie Blue. Protein bands not present in control reactions containing GST-E2 alone or hybrid IgG alone were excised and their N termini sequenced by Edman's degradation using a CLC Capillary 492 Protein Sequencing System (Applied Biosystems) with a phenylthiohydantoin-derivative mixture as standard (2 pmol each; sensitivity of detection of individual amino acids, 0.04–0.10 pmol). To determine substrate specificity, IgG was incubated with GST devoid of the E2 polypeptide (Sigma), biotinylated bovine serum albumin, or biotinylated C2 domain of Factor VIII (biotinylated-C2) prepared as described (33.Paul S. Karle S. Planque S. Taguchi H. Salas M. Nishiyama Y. Handy B. Hunter R. Edmundson A. Hanson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39611-39619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). GST hydrolysis was quantified using anti-GST Ab. Hydrolysis of biotinylated proteins was determined with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin. Syntheses of the serine protease inhibitors diphenyl N-[2-(biotinamido)ethylamido-3,30-dithiodipropionyl]amino(4-amidinophenyl)methanephosphonate (E-hapten 1), N-[2-(biotinamido)ethylamido-3,30-dithiodipropionyl]amino(4-amidinophenyl)methanephosphonate (NE-hapten), and diphenyl N-(benzyloxycarbonyl)amino(4-amidinophenyl)methanephosphonate (E-hapten 2) have been described (37.Nishiyama Y. Taguchi H. Luo J.Q. Zhou Y.X. Burr G. Karle S. Paul S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 402: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of the amide bond linking 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) to the C-terminal amino acid in peptide-AMC substrates was measured in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 m glycine, 0.1 mm CHAPS, pH 7.7, at 37 °C in 96-well plates by fluorimetry (λex 360 nm, λem 470 nm) (17.Mitsuda Y. Planque S. Hara M. Kyle R. Taguchi H. Nishiyama Y. Paul S. Mol. Biotechnol. 2007; 36: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Authentic aminomethylcoumarin was used to construct a standard curve. Kinetic parameters were obtained by fitting the rate data obtained at increasing concentrations of peptide-AMC substrates to the Michaelis-Menten-Henri equation: V = kcat·[Ab] · [S]/(Km + [S]). Human IgG molecules containing catalytic VL domain paired with the VH domain of an anti-HCV E2 Ab were purified from supernatants of NS0 cells. The VL domains were from catalytic light chain clones GG63, HK13, and HK14 isolated from phage display libraries. Light chain GG63 hydrolyzes various tripeptide model substrates (22.Paul S. Tramontano A. Gololobov G. Zhou Y.X. Taguchi H. Karle S. Nishiyama Y. Planque S. George S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28314-28320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Light chains HK14 and HK13 hydrolyze vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (21.Tyutyulkova S. Gao Q.S. Thompson A. Rennard S. Paul S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1316: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and amyloid-β peptide (38.Rangan S.K. Liu R. Brune D. Planque S. Paul S. Sierks M.R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14328-14334Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), substrates unrelated in sequence to the E2 fusion proteins. This catalyst engineering strategy is predicated on the hypothesis that the specificity of hybrid IgGs can be derived from the noncovalent antigen binding activity contributed by the VH domain. The VH domain is from the monoclonal IgG1 CBH-7, an Ab that recognizes HCV E2 with high affinity (Kd ∼ 10 nm) and neutralizes infection by HCV pseudovirions expressing E2 (39.Keck Z.Y. Op De Beeck A.

The precise epitope bound noncovalently by the wild type anti-E2 IgG CBH-7 (VH domain donor) is not known, but studies with E2 deletion mutants suggest that the epitope is a conformational determinant outside the hypervariable 1 region composed of amino acids distant from each other in the linear protein sequence (39.Keck Z.Y.

Hadlock K.G. Foung S.K. Levy S. Blood. 2001; 97: 1023-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and the irrelevant anti-gp120 IgG GL2 were prepared as controls. The recombinant IgGs are intended to recapitulate the structure of natural IgGs containing 2 heavy chains disulfide bonded to 2 light chains. Like natural IgGs purified from blood, each of the hybrid and wild type IgGs purified by chromatography displayed a molecular mass of ∼150 kDa on non-reducing SDS-electrophoresis gels (Fig. 1A, lanes 1–4). Under reducing conditions, silver staining and immunoblotting of the gels revealed the anticipated 50-kDa heavy chain and 28-kDa light chain bands (Fig. 1A, lanes 5–12). The electrophoresis results indicated that the hybrid IgGs have been assembled as full-length, tetrameric IgG molecules. Expression levels for wild type anti-E2 IgG, hybrid GG63 IgG, hybrid HK13 IgG, and hybrid HK14 IgG were, respectively, 0.9, 2, 0.4, and 1.3 mg/liter. E2 is thought to be expressed on the HCV surface in association with E1 as a 66–70-kDa glycosylated transmembrane protein (42.Op De Beeck A. Cocquerel L. Dubuisson J. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 2589-2595Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Noncovalent E2-E1 complexes as well as disulfide-linked oligomers have been identified on the pseudovirion particles, the closest approximation of infectious HCV available for biochemical studies (43.Dubuisson J.

https://openalex.org/W2064432468,"Background Very often, encouraging or discouraging expressions are used in competitive contexts, such as sports practice, aiming at provoking an emotional reaction on the listener and, consequently, an effect on subsequent cognition and/or performance. However, the actual efficiency of these expressions has not been tested scientifically. Methodology/Principal Findings To fill this gap, we studied the effects of encouraging, discouraging, and neutral expressions on event-related brain electrical activity during a visual selective attention task in which targets were determined by location, shape, and color. Although the expressions preceded the attentional task, both encouraging and discouraging messages elicited a similar long-lasting brain emotional response present during the visuospatial task. In addition, encouraging expressions were able to alter the customary working pattern of the visual attention system for shape selection in the attended location, increasing the P1 and the SP modulations while simultaneously fading away the SN. Conclusions/Significance This was interpreted as an enhancement of the attentional processes for shape in the attended location after an encouraging expression. It can be stated, therefore, that encouraging expressions, as those used in sport practice, as well as in many other contexts and situations, do seem to be efficient in exerting emotional reactions and measurable effects on cognition."
https://openalex.org/W1965353685,"Familial component is estimated to account for about 10% of ovarian cancer. However, the mode of inheritance of ovarian cancer remains poorly understood. The goal of this study was to investigate the inheritance model that best fits the observed transmission pattern of ovarian cancer among 7669 members of 1919 pedigrees ascertained through probands from the Gilda Radner Familial Ovarian Cancer Registry at Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York.Using the Statistical Analysis for Genetic Epidemiology program, we carried out complex segregation analyses of ovarian cancer affection status by fitting different genetic hypothesis-based regressive multivariate logistic models. We evaluated the likelihood of sporadic, major gene, environmental, general, and six types of Mendelian models. Under each hypothesized model, we also estimated the susceptibility allele frequency, transmission probabilities for the susceptibility allele, baseline susceptibility and estimates of familial association. Comparisons between models were carried out using either maximum likelihood ratio test in the case of hierarchical models, or Akaike information criterion for non-nested models. When assessed against sporadic model without familial association, the model with both parent-offspring and sib-sib residual association could not be rejected. Likewise, the Mendelian dominant model that included familial residual association provided the best-fitting for the inheritance of ovarian cancer. The estimated disease allele frequency in the dominant model was 0.21.This report provides support for a genetic role in susceptibility to ovarian cancer with a major autosomal dominant component. This model does not preclude the possibility of polygenic inheritance of combined effects of multiple low penetrance susceptibility alleles segregating dominantly."
https://openalex.org/W2056665093,"Background Ecological characteristics (growth, morphology, reproduction) arise from the interaction between environmental factors and genetics. Genetic analysis of individuals' life history traits might be used to improve our understanding of mechanisms that form and maintain a hybrid zone. Methodology/Principal Findings A fish hybrid zone was used to characterize the process of natural selection. Data were collected during two reproductive periods (2001 and 2002) and 1117 individuals (nase, Chondrostama nasus nasus, sofie C. toxostoma toxostoma and hybrids) were sampled. Reproductive dates of the two parental species overlapped at sympatric sites. The nase had an earlier reproductive period than the sofie; males had longer reproductive periods for both species. Hybridisation between female nase and male sofie was the most likely. Hybrids had a reproductive period similar to the inherited parental mitochondrial type. Growth and reproductive information from different environments has been synthesised following a bayesian approach of the von Bertalanffy model. Hybrid life history traits appear to link with maternal heritage. Hybrid size from the age of two and size at first maturity appeared to be closer to the size of the maternal origin species (nase or sofie). Median growth rates for hybrids were similar and intermediate between those of the parental species. We observed variable life history traits for hybrids and pure forms in the different parts of the hybrid zone. Geometrical analysis of the hybrid fish shape gave evidence of two main morphologies with a link to maternal heritage. Conclusions/Significance Selective mating seemed to be the underlying process which, with mitochondrial heritage, could explain the evolution of the studied hybrid zone. More generally, we showed the importance of studies on hybrid zones and specifically the study of individuals' ecological characteristics, to improve our understanding of speciation."
https://openalex.org/W2043280714,"Doppel protein (Dpl) is a paralog of the cellular form of the prion protein (PrPC), together sharing common structural and biochemical properties. Unlike PrPC, which is abundantly expressed throughout the central nervous system (CNS), Dpl protein expression is not detectable in the CNS. Interestingly, its ectopic expression in the brain elicits neurodegeneration in transgenic mice. Here, by combining native isoelectric focusing plus non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry analysis, we identified two Dpl binding partners: rat alpha-1-inhibitor-3 (α1I3) and, by sequence homology, alpha-2-macroglobulin (α2M), two known plasma metalloproteinase inhibitors. Biochemical investigations excluded the direct interaction of PrPC with either α1I3 or α2M. Nevertheless, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and surface plasmon resonance experiments revealed a high affinity binding occurring between PrPC and Dpl. In light of these findings, we suggest a mechanism for Dpl-induced neurodegeneration in mice expressing Dpl ectopically in the brain, linked to a withdrawal of natural inhibitors of metalloproteinase such as α2M. Interestingly, α2M has been proven to be a susceptibility factor in Alzheimer's disease, and as our findings imply, it may also play a relevant role in other neurodegenerative disorders, including prion diseases."
