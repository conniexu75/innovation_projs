https://openalex.org/W1507356284,"The binding sites of rotenone, piericidin A, and Amytal in the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide oxidase chain of heart have been studied with the aid of rotenone-6a-14C. Binding of rotenone continues in a linear manner beyond the point of maximal inhibition of respiration, indicating that rotenone is tightly bound not only at the specific site in the NADH dehydrogenase segment of the respiratory chain but also at other sites in submitochondrial particles. Unspecific binding is reduced by treatment of the particles with rotenone in the presence of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and is further minimized by successive washing with BSA, with only minimal removal of rotenone from the specific site. Rotenone-14C is not removed from the specific site by denaturation or proteolysis but is largely removed by repeated extractions with anhydrous acetone, which results in recovery primarily of rotenone with only small amounts of a less inhibitory oxidation product. Substantial reversal of the inhibition of respiration occurs on repeated washing of the inhibited particles with BSA. Thus, contrary to expectations, under usual assay conditions rotenone is not a specific, stoichiometric, and irreversible inhibitor. Studies involving preincubation of the electron transport particle with various unlabeled inhibitors, of widely varying chemical type and inhibitory potency, prior to addition of rotenone-14C for determination of its subsequent binding, provide strong evidence that it is possible to distinguish between the portion of rotenone-14C that is specifically bound and the portion that is unspecifically bound. Piericidin A, Amytal, and a number of rotenoids appear to react at the same site as rotenone because they compete with rotenone-14C for binding at the specific site, and the competition with rotenone is proportional to the inhibitory power of the compounds tested and not to their concentration or chemical nature. Although the molar ratio of rotenone bound at the specific site to the NADH dehydrogenase content in particles approximates unity, the binding is not on NADH dehydrogenase itself, since extraction of the enzyme from phosphorylating or non-phosphorylating particles labeled with rotenone-14C results in nearly complete separation of rotenone-14C from the enzyme. Qualitative and quantitative differences are evident in the binding of rotenone to soluble NADH-coenzyme Q reductase as compared to submitochondrial particles. Although the soluble reductase, extracted with acid-ethanol from particles inhibited with rotenone-14C, is fully active and contains little or no rotenone-14C, it may be inhibited again on further addition of rotenone."
https://openalex.org/W1524437146,"Abstract On the addition of NADH to submitochondrial particles in which NADH oxidase is blocked by rotenone, piericidin A, or Amytal, the g = 1.94 signal of NADH dehydrogenase appears in essentially the same manner as in untreated preparations. However, the appearance of the NADHinduced iron signal of succinate dehydrogenase and of cytochromes b and c1 is inhibited by these agents. It is concluded that Amytal, rotenone, and piericidin block NADH oxidation on the O2 side of the non-heme iron of NADH dehydrogenase."
https://openalex.org/W1528000695,"Abstract Rubredoxin, a red, nonheme iron protein previously shown to function as an electron carrier in the ω-hydroxylation of fatty acids and hydrocarbons in enzyme preparations from Pseudomonas oleovorans, has been obtained in highly purified form. The apparent molecular weight is 12,800. Two atoms of iron are present per molecule, but no labile sulfide. In the oxidized form this protein exhibits absorption maxima at 495, 377, and 280 mµ, with a molar extinction coefficient at 495 mµ of 1.11 x 104. Oxidized rubredoxin gives electron paramagnetic resonance signals at g = 4.3 and 9.4, which is characteristic of high spin ferric ion in a rhombic field. A quantitative comparison of the loss of absorbance at 495 mµ and of electron paramagnetic resonance at g = 4.3 upon the reduction of rubredoxin by TPNH, in the presence of spinach TPNH-ferredoxin reductase, indicated that 1 electron is accepted per atom of iron. The reduction potential is -0.037 volt. Rubredoxin gives intense and detailed optical rotatory dispersion and circular dichroism spectra which indicate that the iron-ligand chromophores are in a highly asymmetric environment."

Similar implants in nearby regions of the brain or sham implantations in the same region were ineffective. The data suggest that the hypothalamic control of pituitary corticotropin may have a cholinergic component."
https://openalex.org/W1583546580,"[6β-3H]-Δ7-Cholesten-3β-ol and [6β-2H]-Δ7-cholesten-3β-ol have been prepared by chemical synthesis. Reduction of 7-dehydrocholesterol by diimide has been found to yield Δ7-cholesten-3β-ol. With the use of this reaction we have prepared [4-14C]-Δ7-cholesten-3β-ol, [5α,6α-3H]-Δ7-cholesten-3β-ol, and [5α,6α-2H]-Δ7-cholesten-3β-ol. Virtually complete retention of labeled hydrogen of [4-14C], [6β-3H]-Δ7-cholesten-3β-ol was observed upon enzymatic conversion to 7-dehydrocholesterol and cholesterol. The location of the tritium at carbon atom 6 of cholesterol was established by the virtually complete loss of labeled hydrogen upon conversion of the 3H-cholesterol to 6-nitrocholesteryl nitrate. The enzymatic conversion of [4-14C], [5α,6α-3H]-Δ7-cholesten-3β-ol to 7-dehydrocholesterol and cholesterol occurred with complete loss of labeled hydrogen. A simple method is described for the rapid removal of 7-dehydrocholesterol from samples of Δ7-cholesten-3β-ol. A significant chromatographic fractionation of 7-dehydrocholesterol and cholesterol labeled with tritium at carbon atom 6 from the same compounds labeled with 14C at carbon atom 4 or containing no isotopic label was observed on columns of alumina impregnated with silver nitrate."
https://openalex.org/W1568123347,"Abstract An enzyme system that catalyzes the conversion of l-aspartate-14C to asparagine-14C in the presence of glutamine, ATP, and Mg++ has been purified 108-fold from a homogenate of the Novikoff hepatoma. ATP is converted to adenosine 5'-phosphate and inorganic pyrophosphate, and substitution of hydroxylamine for glutamine yields β-aspartyl-hydroxamate. The data suggest that the synthesis of asparagine in mammalian tissues proceeds through the intermediate β-aspartyladenylate."

https://openalex.org/W1600297529,"Abstract The polysaccharide containing 6-O-methylglucose, from Mycobacterium phlei, is an acidic molecule with at least seven 6-O-methyl-d-glucopyranosyl residues linked α-1,4', and with a side chain of at least three α-1,4'-d-glucopyranosyl units. A simplified procedure is described for isolating the polysaccharide (MGP) from acetone-dried M. phlei cells with improved yield. Exhaustive α-amylase digestion of the polysaccharide released glucose, maltose, and a disaccharide. The last yielded d-glucose and 3-O-methyl-d-glucose after acid hydrolysis; while hydrolysis, after reduction with sodium borohydride, gave glucitol and 3-O-methylglucose. Methylation analysis established that the disaccharide was 3-O-methyl-α-d-glucopyranosyl-(1 → 4)-d-glucose. Limited α-amylolysis of MGP yielded a trisaccharide and a tetrasaccharide, each containing 1 mole of 3-O-methylglucose at the nonreducing end. The trisaccharide was digested by α-amylase to the disaccharide 3-O-methylglucosyl-(1 → 4)-glucose and glucose, while α-amylolysis of the tetrasaccharide gave these products plus maltose. A glucoamylase preparation converted the tetrasaccharide to the trisaccharide and glucose. That 3-O-methylglucose was at the nonreducing terminus of each saccharide was shown by partial acid hydrolysis studies and by the products of exhaustive propylation, which yielded 3-O-methyl-2,4,6-tri-O-propylglucose. Propylation of the intact polysaccharide and analysis of the fully alkylated methylglucosides by gas-liquid chromatography established that 3-O-methylglucose and glucose were in the nonreducing terminal positions. After α-amylase digestion, glucose was the only terminal residue. Glucoamylase removed an additional glucosyl residue, which had been linked α-1,4' to a 6-O-methylglucosyl residue. An organic acid having the chromatographic and electrophoretic properties of glyceric acid was isolated from acid hydrolysates of MGP. The glyceric acid was oxidized by 1 mole of sodium periodate, with the release of 1 mole of formaldehyde and 1 of glyoxalate. It was shown to have the d configuration. 3-O-Methylglyceric acid was obtained by hydrolysis of methylated MGP, showing that the linkage to the polysaccharide involved the 2-hydroxyl group. MGP was converted to the hydroxamate, and a Lossen rearrangement was performed in water at neutral pH. The reducing sugar thus formed was reduced with sodium borotritide, and the radioactive polyol obtained by acid hydrolysis was identified as glucitol. Thus, the glyceric acid must be attached glycosidically to a glucose residue. The intact lipopolysaccharide, MGLP, was not associated with purified M. phlei cell wall or particulate preparations. The material was recovered quantitatively from the high speed supernatant, apparently in free form. An attempt to degrade the main chain enzymatically with extracts from M. phlei was unsuccessful, and a search both for low molecular weight oligosaccharides containing 6-O-methylglucose and for large polysaccharides into which MGLP might have been incorporated was unproductive. Thus, our investigations have failed to suggest a structural or metabolic function for the lipopolysaccharide. MGLP, isolated from the cultural filtrate of M. phlei cells in the stationary phase, was indistinguishable from the intracellular molecule. It was released into the medium during all stages of the growth cycle, the kinetics following those for the appearance of low molecular weight carbohydrates and of mannose- and arabinose-containing polysaccharides."

https://openalex.org/W1533187678,"Abstract Ciliapterin, a new unconjugated pteridine, has been isolated from the ciliated protozoan, Tetrahymena pyriformis. It has been determined by alkaline permanganate oxidation to be a 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-substituted pteridine and by acid hydrolytic treatment to possess no labile bonds (such as glycosidic or phosphoester). The substitution at position 6 is dihydroxypropyl, as shown by the identification of acetaldehyde as one of the products of periodate oxidation. Although its absorbance spectrum is identical with that of biopterin, its fluorescence and activation spectra are similar, but not identical, with those of biopterin. Mobilities on paper with a number of solvent systems and its elution patterns from cation and anion exchange columns together with its biological activity in the Crithidia system indicate that it is 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-(threo-dihydroxypropyl)pteridine. Its biological activity suggests that it may be the l-threo compound. The origin of this pteridine has been shown, by the use of both guanine-2-14C and uniformly labeled guanosine monophosphate-14C in the culture medium, to be entirely from guanosine. No hydroxymethylpteridine could be detected, indicating the inability of this organism to produce the pteridine precursor of folic acid."
https://openalex.org/W2061718200,"Dimethyl sulfoxide inhibits horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase. In the direction of aldehyde reduction, this inhibition is competitive with aldehyde, with an inhibition constant of 5 x 10(-3)M. Dimethyl sulfoxide reacts with the binary complex consisting of enzyme and the reduced form of nicotinamide -adenine dinucleotide to form a highly fluorescent ternary complex, with a dissociation constant similar to the inhibition constant. The inhibition of aldehyde reduction can be interpreted as due to competition between aldehyde and dimethyl sulfoxide for the carbonyl binding site of the above-mentioned binary complex."

The glycyl-tRNA synthetase has been purified 200-fold from sonic extracts of S. aureus H, and no evidence of a second enzyme has been found. This enzyme can also charge the tRNAs of certain other bacteria and yeast. Some of its properties are reported."

https://openalex.org/W1511744351,"Abstract Results of rapid reaction experiments indicate that the first observable product formed after the reaction of oxygen with purified reduced cytochrome oxidase is a spectral form which corresponds to that of the oxidized enzyme. latter is then slowly converted to The Compound, or so-called oxygenated form. These observations suggest that Compound is not an intermediate in the cytochrome oxidase-oxygen reaction. Results of spectrophotometric experiments show that what corresponds to Compound can be generated after aeration of the enzyme subsequent to reduction with formamidinesulfinic acid, or after aeration of dithionite-reduced oxidase, even when the reduction has been carried out by anaerobic titration to eliminate excess dithionite. Possible explanations for Compound are (a) a mixture of ferrous and cupric ions, (b) a mixture of ferrous, ferric, and cupric ions, (c) a higher oxidation state of the heme iron, (d) a change in the oxidation-reduction state of groups on the protein other than iron or copper which affect its absorption spectrum, and (e) a configurational change of the oxidase protein that affects the environment of the heme."
https://openalex.org/W1521839090,"Abstract The effects of Bacillus subtilis protease, Type VIII (subtilopeptidase A, EC 3.4.4.16), on the lipolytic action of norepinephrine, corticotropin, caffeine, and theophylline on isolated adipose cells were examined. The results indicate that B. subtilis protease, at concentrations suboptimal and optimal for the enhancement of glucose utilization, inhibited, like insulin, the lipolysis mediated by the above agents. Adipose cells, pretreated with insulin or B. subtilis protease, followed by extensive washing, still exhibited elevated glucose utilization and a reduced response to the lipolytic hormones and compounds. The inhibitory action of B. subtilis protease on the stimulated lipolysis was reduced with increasing concentrations of the lipolytic agents. Other proteolytic enzymes such as trypsin, α-chymotrypsin, and Streptomyces griseus protease (Type VI), also exhibited an antilipolytic action. The antilipolytic action of proteolytic enzymes, which was found to be independent of their ability to stimulate glucose uptake, is considered to result from the proteolytic modification of the plasma membrane of the adipose cells via as yet unknown mechanisms."

The 3'-nucleotidase and cyclic phosphodiesterase activities have been purified 130- and 120-fold, respectively. The enzyme preparation is free of other phosphomonoesterase, ribonuclease, and deoxyribonuclease activity. Attempts to separate the two activities by a variety of physical and chemical means have been unsuccessful. It is suggested that a single enzyme is capable of catalyzing both types of hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2006293131,"In the presence of Sendai virus inactivated with ultraviolet light, nucleated chick erythrocytes can be fused with several types of human cells to form heterokaryons. Although chick erythrocytes alone cannot be stimulated by Sendai virus to produce interferon, fusion with a human cell (AH-1) which itself may produce human interferon results in heterokaryons in which the erythrocyte genome is activated and chick interferon is produced. When nucleated chick erythrocytes are fused with another type of human cell (HeLa clone S-3) which does not produce human interferon when stimulated, no chick interferon is detectable, despite morphologic changes suggestive of activation of the erythrocyte nuclei."
https://openalex.org/W2137774919,"Abstract The kinetics of binding of cyanide to sperm whale metmyoglobin has been studied in the pH range from 4.7 to 10.6 by simple mixing and stopped flow methods with classical and relaxation techniques and the aid of a digital computer. The apparent second order rate constant is strongly dependent on the nature and concentration of the buffer. Extrapolation to zero buffer concentration at constant total ionic strength and pH yields apparent rate constants independent of which buffer is used. The extrapolated rate constants are greatest in the region between pH 7 and pH 8.5, decrease with lower pH values, and decrease more rapidly with higher pH values. The data are interpreted in terms of a mechanism providing for a single ionizable group on the protein with pK = 6.0, the acid dissociation of Fe·H2O in the heme with pK = 8.9, and the HCN dissociation with pK = 9.2."
https://openalex.org/W1989288651,"VIRUS-SPECIFIC non-structural antigens (T antigens) are produced early in the lytic cycle of adenovirus infection and are also found in cells transformed by adenovirus1–3. Synthesis of T antigen, unlike that of the structural antigen, is not dependent on DNA synthesis; for example, fluorodeoxyuridine (FUdR) effectively inhibits the synthesis of viral antigen (V) without markedly suppressing the production of T antigen4,5. Our studies have been designed to produce large quantities of T antigen “free” from viral structural antigen by manipulation of the lytic interaction of adenoviruses in KB cells."

https://openalex.org/W1584907194,"Abstract The reduction of NAD catalyzed by pig heart mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase can be stimulated by low concentrations, approximately 0.05 mm, of Hg++. This activation is dependent on the presence of the substrate malate at the time the enzyme is exposed to Hg++. The stimulation is both pH- and temperature-dependent, with maximum stimulation occurring near pH 8.8 and 30°. The activation is not the result of an alteration in the Ks values of the enzyme for either NAD or malate. The reverse reaction, the oxidation of NADH, is markedly inhibited by Hg++ in potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, but is unaffected in Tris-HCl buffer at the same pH. These observations suggest that the effects of Hg++ on enzymatic activity are the results of various structural changes produced following mercaptide formation with different sulfhydryl groups of the enzyme. Hg++ stimulation of NAD reduction could also be demonstrated with malate dehydrogenase from other animal sources, as well as with the enzymes from Escherichia coli, Aerobacter aerogenes, and Salmonella typhimurium. In contrast, the enzymes from Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus polymyxa could not be stimulated, while those from Bacillus licheniformis and plant sources were inhibited by Hg++."

https://openalex.org/W1981473790,"RECENTLY it has been suggested1–3 that electron spin resonance studies of irradiated amino-acids reveal thermal effects as well as directly induced free radicals. The model proposed is that absorption of radiation energy may lead to a localized heating of small regions; this may allow radical reactions to take place at a rate characteristic of a much higher temperature than the average temperature of the sample. Evidence for this model includes the fact that there are differences in the spectra from irradiated glycine and valine after very high doses and lower doses of radiation energy1; the effects of different linear energy transfer radiations2; and the changes in the glycine spectra as functions of dose and time3. The validity of such a model depends on the assumption that the energy deposited by the radiation cannot diffuse by a conduction process, as only then can a local “hot spot” be created. A theoretical examination of this problem is hampered, however, by a lack of knowledge of the processes involved; in particular, no measuremeDts have been made, as far as is known, on thermal conductivities. As a first step, an investigation was therefore made of the thermal conductivity of a single crystal of glycine."
