Alterations in the redox equilibrium are precipitated by changing either the glutathione/glutathione-disulfide ratio (GSH/GSSG) and/or the reduced/oxidized thioredoxin ratio. Redox-sensitive green fluorescent proteins (GFP) allow real time visualization of the oxidation state of the indicator. Ratios of fluorescence from excitation at 400 and 490 nm indicate the extent of oxidation and thus the redox potential while canceling out the amount of indicator and the absolute optical sensitivity. Because the indicator is genetically encoded, it can be targeted to specific proteins or organelles of interest and expressed in a wide variety of cells and organisms. We evaluated roGFP1 (GFP with mutations C48S, S147C, and Q204C) and roGFP2 (the same plus S65T) with physiologically or toxicologically relevant oxidants both in vitro and in living mammalian cells. Furthermore, we investigated the response of the redox probes under physiological redox changes during superoxide bursts in macrophage cells, hyperoxic and hypoxic conditions, and in responses to H2O2-stimulating agents, e.g. epidermal growth factor and lysophosphatidic acid.

Cells have elaborate homeostatic mechanisms to regulate the thiol-disulfide redox status of their internal compartments. Most thiol groups within the cytoplasm are normally reduced. Very few are present as disulfides. It has been speculated that the cytoplasm is reducing because many metabolic reactions evolved before oxygen became abundant in the atmosphere (1Krauth-Siegel R.L. Jockers-Scherubl M.C. Becker K. Schirmer R.H. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1989; 17: 315-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Modest alterations in the thiol-disulfide equilibrium could have major consequences in the cell, including defective protein folding or enzyme activity (because many enzymes have a cysteine in their active site). When excess oxidation overwhelms the reductive capabilities of the cell, death results. Despite the dangers of excessive oxidation, cells sometimes use redox adjustments as signaling events, such as in the activation of transcription factors (NF-κB and AP-1), caspases, protein tyrosine phosphatases, or GTPases (Ras). Thus, changes in the redox equilibrium influence a host of cell functions, including but not limited to growth, stress responses, differentiation, metabolism, cell cycle, communication, migration, gene transcription, ion channels, and immune responses (for reviews see Refs. 2Forman H.J.

Alterations in the redox equilibrium are reflected in changes of the glutathione/glutathione-disulfide ratio (GSH/GSSG) and the reduced/oxidized thioredoxin ratio. Glutathione is found in high concentrations in cells (5-10 mm) and is considered to be the major player in maintaining intracellular redox equilibrium. Ratios of GSH to GSSG are reported to range from 100 to 300:1 (7Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar, 8Liu S. Ansari N.H. Wang C. Wang L. Srivastava S.K. Curr. Eye Res. 1996; 15: 726-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), but these measurements have been problematic because they require destruction of the tissue, during which great care must be taken not to allow further oxidation. The major source of error is the determination of GSSG concentration, because this species is at low abundance yet is measured only after complete removal of GSH to prevent oxidation. The spatial and temporal resolution of such destructive assays is very poor.

The indicators examined in this work are GFP mutants with two surface-exposed cysteine placed at positions 147 and 204 on adjacent β-strands close to the chromophore. Disulfide formation between the cysteine residues promotes protonation of the chromophore and increases the excitation spectrum peak near 400 nm at the expense of the peak near 490 nm. The ratios of fluorescence from excitation at 400 and 490 nm indicate the extent of oxidation and thus the redox potential while canceling out the amount of indicator and the absolute optical sensitivity. Because the indicator is genetically encoded, it can be targeted to specific proteins or organelles of interest and expressed in a wide variety of cells and organisms. Here we evaluate roGFP1 (GFP with mutations C48S, S147C, and Q204C) and roGFP2 (the same plus S65T) with physiologically or toxicologically relevant oxidants both in vitro and in living mammalian cells. The probes expressed in cell cytoplasm responded as expected to a variety of oxidants. Although lower concentrations of hydrogen peroxide were required to oxidize cytosolic roGFPs than oxidize the same proteins in vitro, attempts to detect growth factor-stimulated production of hydrogen peroxide were not successful. However, the probes could detect superoxide generated during the oxidative burst of HL60 cells. Aldrithiol, diamide, hydrogen peroxide, buthionine sulfoximine, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, apocynin (acetovanillone), and 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride were obtained from Aldrich. Oxidized and reduced lipoate, oxidized and reduced glutathione, menadione, diphenylene iodonium chloride, BCNU (1,3-bis-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea) (carmustine), and apocynin were obtained from Sigma. 2,3-Dimethoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (DMNQ) and DTT were obtained from Calbiochem. Bis(2-mercaptoethyl)sulfone (BMES) was from USB Corp. Its cyclic disulfide was prepared by oxidation with a stoichiometric quantity of iodine (10Goodrow M.H. Musker W.K. Synthesis. 1981; : 457-459Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar) followed by recrystallization from hexane. HL60 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. In Vitro Studies—roGFPs were subcloned into pRSETB (Invitrogen) using BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites. The plasmid encodes a fusion protein of the insert and an N-terminal extension containing a (His)6 tag, enabling purification by nickel affinity chromatography. The construct was expressed in the JM109 strain of Escherichia coli. Isolated protein was reduced daily by mixing concentrated protein (50-200 μm) with 10 mm DTT and diluting to the required concentration. When necessary, DTT was removed from the solution using Centri-spin 20 columns (Princeton Separations Inc.). Reactions were carried out in 125 mm KCl, 75 mm HEPES, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.3, which had been degassed by repetitive evacuation and nitrogen bubbling. Excitation scans (350-500 nm, 2.5-nm bandwidth) were run in 100-μl volumes in 96-well plates (sealed when required) on a Safire spectrofluorometer (Tecan), collecting emission at 530 nm, 7.5-nm bandwidth. Redox Titration Using Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Redox probes were titrated in degassed HEPES buffer containing 1 μm protein and 10 mm lipoate or BMES as redox buffers. Concentrations of oxidized and reduced forms were reciprocally varied from 0:10 to 10:0 mm in 1 mm increments. The eleven solutions comprising each titration series were incubated at 25 or 30 °C for 1 h while sealed under a nitrogen atmosphere before measuring fluorescence excitation spectra. The redox potential of the redox probes using BMES or lipoate as redox buffers were obtained by first applying the following formula to each of the incrementing concentrations in the titration: Y = (Rn - Rmin)/(Rmax - Rn), where Rn = ratio at a particular concentration of redox buffer, Rmin = ratio in 10 mm reduced redox buffer, and Rmax = ratio in 10 mm oxidized redox buffer. From a plot of log Y versus log([oxidized redox buffer]/[reduced redox buffer]), the buffer ratio (A) required to achieve 50% of the ratio change can be determined from the intercept where log Y = 0. Keq was derived from log Keq = log(F490 red)/(F490 ox)) - log A. The redox potential (E′) was then calculated from the Nernst equation shown in Equation 1, E′=E′0−(RT/nF)ln⁡Keq(Eq. 1) where E′0 is the redox potential of the redox buffers (lipoate -290 mV (11Lamoureux G.V. Whitesides G.M. J. Org. Chem. 1993; 58: 633-641Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar); BMES -295 mV (see below)), R is the gas constant (8.313 J/mol/K), T is temperature (K), n = 2 is the number of electrons exchanged, and F is Faraday's constant (96490 J/mol/volt). Redox Potential of BMES Using NMR Spectroscopy—Solution A initially containing 10 mm dihydrolipoate and 10 mm oxidized BMES and solution B initially containing 10 mm oxidized lipoate and 10 mm reduced BMES were separately prepared in deoxygenated sodium phosphate buffer (10 mm, pD 7.4) in D2O. NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian 200-MHz spectrometer at 283 K. The spectra of solutions A and B taken following a 1-h incubation after preparation were essentially identical, showing that equilibrium had been attained. Peaks specific to each of the reagents both oxidized and reduced were found: oxidized lipoate (3.2 ppm); dihydrolipoate (2.65 ppm); oxidized BMES (3.85 ppm); and reduced BMES (3.4 ppm). To determine the equilibrium constant (Keq) between lipoic acid and BMES, Keq = [BMESred] × [lipoateox]/([BMESox] × [lipoatered]), we used the integrals under the peaks, Keq = (integral @ 3.4 ppm) × (integral @ 3.2 ppm)/((integral @ 3.85 ppm) × (integral @ 2.65 ppm)). Inserting the value Keq = 1.46 into the Nernst equation (using a value of -290 mV for lipoate standard (11Lamoureux G.V. Whitesides G.M. J. Org. Chem. 1993; 58: 633-641Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar)), the redox potential of BMES in D2O was determined to be -295 mV. Superoxide Production by Xanthine Oxidase—Reactivity to superoxide was determined by incubating 1 μm roGFP with 25 milliunits of xanthine oxidase (which had been centrifuged to remove ammonium sulfate) and 50 μm xanthine in 150 μl of 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4. Imaging in Cells—roGFPs were expressed in HeLa, P388D1, or HL60 cells using modified pEFGP-N1 as expression vector and Lipofectin as transfection reagent. After 24-72 h of incubation at 37 °C in culture medium, the cells were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution buffer. Cells were imaged on a Zeiss Axiovert microscope with a cooled CCD camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) controlled by Metafluor 2.75 software (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA). Dualexcitation ratio imaging used excitation filters 400DF15 and 480DF30 for roGFP1 and 400DF15 and 495DF10 for roGFP2 altered by a filter changer (Lambda 10-2, Sutter Instruments, San Rafael, CA). A 505DRLP dichroic mirror and an emission filter, 535DF25, were used for both probes. Fluorescence images were background-corrected by manual selection of background regions. Exposure time was 200-1000 ms, and images were taken every minute. Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorter Analysis—Ratios for HL60 cells were obtained on a FACSVantage SE with DIVA option (BD Biosciences). Cells were excited using laser lines at 407 nm (50 milliwatts) and 488 nm (150 milliwatts). Emission filters were 510/21 for both excitation wavelengths. HL60 cells were grown in the presence of 1.3% Me2SO in IMDM plus 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin for 5-7 days. The cell suspension (1 × 107 cells) was washed twice in IMDM without fetal bovine serum and resuspended in 1 ml of IMDM for electroporation. DNA (50-75 μg) was added to the solution and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The cells were electroporated using a Cell-Porator electroporation system I (Invitrogen) using a 310-V pulse and 1180-microfarad capacitance. Cells were grown in IMDM (10% fetal bovine serum) for 2 days before oxidation experiments. Cells were washed and suspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution, and aliquots of cells were incubated in 50 μm PMA or 100 μm aldrithiol. For inhibition studies, cells were preincubated for 30 min in either 500 μm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF) or 200 μm apocynin. Gene Cloning—Five mutations of amino acids neighboring Cys-147 and Cys-204 of roGFP1 and roGFP2 were incorporated using a QuikChange kit (Stratagene). They included N149K, A206K, F223K, N149K with A206K, and F223K with A206K. The mutated constructs in pRSETB (Invitrogen) were expressed using JM109 bacteria and purified as described above. For expression in mammalian cells, the constructs were subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) using BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites. For membrane targeting, a sequence for myristoylation and palmitoylation was appended to the N terminus of roGFP1 and roGFP2. The signal sequence, MGCINSKRKDNLND, was derived from Lyn, a tyrosine kinase protein belonging to the Src family. The forward primer (5′-GCGGATCCTAAGCTTCGAGCCACCATGGGCTGCATCAACAGCAAGCGCAAGGACAACCTGAACG-3′) and reverse primer (5′-GTTTCAGGTTCAGGGGGAGGTGTGGGAGG-3′) were used to subclone the sequence into pEGFP-N1 (Clontech). For nuclear localization, the sequence PKKKRKVEDA was added to the C terminus of the redox probes using PCR to subclone the construct in pEGFP-N1. For mitochondrial localization, the redox probes were transferred to pECFP-mito (Clontech) using BamHI and NotI restriction to swap the cyan fluorescent protein and roGFP sequences. Confirmation of Redox Potential—Preliminary experiments showed that roGFP1 and roGFP2 in the cytosol of mammalian cells were largely reduced, so it was important to characterize the behavior of reduced roGFP1 and roGFP2 in vitro. The proteins were expressed in E. coli, purified, and were freshly reduced each experimental day. Experiments were carried out in deoxygenated buffers unless stated otherwise (see “Materials and Methods”). Hanson et al. (9Hanson G.T. Aggeler R. Oglesbee D. Capaldi R.A. Tsien R.Y. Remington S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13044-13053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar) measured the midpoint redox potentials (E′0) of roGFP1 and roGFP2 to be -288 and -272 mV, respectively, using DTT (E′0 = -330 mV) as the calibrating redox buffer. The large difference between E′0 values for the roGFPs versus DTT means that roGFP is half-reduced with very small ratios of [DTT] to [DTTox]. It would be desirable to confirm the E′0 values for roGFPs using redox buffers with E′0s more closely matched to those of roGFPs. We chose dihydrolipoic acid (thioctic acid) and BMES because they form internal disulfides upon oxidation, similar to DTT and roGFPs. Therefore, roGFPs should react with these buffers with a 1:1 stoichiometry. Furthermore, both of these buffers are small molecules, which should cross cell membranes, possibly allowing in situ calibration of intracellular roGFPs. Titrations of the protein in redox buffers of increasing ratios of reduced to oxidized states were performed (Fig. 1) from which the midpoint potentials of the redox proteins were calculated. Initially, we found distinct redox potentials when using lipoate or BMES as standard solutions; however, the values for roGFP1 and roGFP2 differed by the identical values. Because E′0 for BMES (-313 mV) (12Lees W.J. Singh R. Whitesides G.M. J. Org. Chem. 1991; 56: 7328-7331Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar) had only been determined in 1:1 methanol-water, we used NMR spectroscopy to determine the value for BMES in a purely aqueous solution relative to the dihydrolipoate/lipoate couple. When the resulting value E′0 = -295 ± 1 mV was used to determine E′0 for the roGFPs, we obtained close agreement between the values obtained in the two standard buffers. These values, E′0 = -294 and -287 mV for roGFP1 and roGFP2, respectively, are somewhat more negative than the redox potentials reported by Hanson et al. (9Hanson G.T. Aggeler R. Oglesbee D. Capaldi R.A. Tsien R.Y. Remington S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13044-13053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar) based on DTT as standard, -288 and -272 mV, although the ordering of roGFP1 as more reducing than roGFP2 is preserved. Oxidation of Redox Probes in Vitro—Because roGFPs were largely reduced inside cells until membrane-permeant oxidants were added, we characterized the in vitro dose-response relationships of roGFPs to those same oxidants. roGFPs are easily oxidized upon storage in vitro, so they were freshly reduced prior to most experiments and characterized in degassed buffers and sealed reactions. Fig. 2 shows the extent of roGFP oxidation by varying concentrations of oxidants after 30 min and 24 h of reaction. Aldrithiol (2,2-dipyridyl disulfide) and diamide (1,1-azobis(N,N-dimethylformamide)) were very reactive and completely oxidized roGFPs in <30 min at all of the concentrations tested (0.008-1 mm). Two other disulfides, GSSG and the oxidized form of BMES, required longer reaction times and higher concentrations to oxidize roGFPs, even partially. Hydrogen peroxide was not very effective in vitro until given at nearly millimolar concentrations for >30 min. We also tested two naphthoquinones commonly used to stimulate redox cycling in live cells. Menadione, 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone, caused an initial increase in emission ratio consistent with oxidation, but prolonged incubations gave anomalous ratios and large decreases in fluorescence emission at all of the excitation wavelengths. Mass spectral analysis of the proteins after menadione exposure revealed the addition of 344 Da, consistent with the addition of 2 molecules of menadione to the proteins. Arylation of cysteines by menadione has been reported previously (13Di Monte D. Ross D. Bellomo G. Eklow L. Orrenius S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 235: 334-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 14Mirabelli F. Salis A. Perotti M. Taddei F. Bellomo G. Orrenius S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 3423-3427Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). GSH reacts with menadione to give the thioether as well as hydrogen peroxide and superoxide (15Ross D. Thor H. Orrenius S. Moldeus P. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1985; 55: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). DMNQ (16Gant T.W. Ramakrishna D.N. Mason R.P. Cohen G.M. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1988; 65: 157-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), reported to elicit redox cycling without arylating thiols, did not cause fluorescence quenching but only partially oxidized roGFPs even after 24 h. Surprisingly, a given oxidant concentration and exposure time generally caused more oxidation of roGFP2 than those of roGFP1, even though roGFP1 is thermodynamically a stronger reductant (i.e. has a more negative E′0) than roGFP2. Oxidation of Redox Probes in HeLa Cells—When roGFPs were transiently expressed in HeLa cells, expression was observed throughout the cytosol and nucleus and ratios were comparable for all of the areas of the cell. Oxidants such as aldrithiol increased the excitation ratio (400/480 nm for roGFP1, 400/495 nm for roGFP2) over a few minutes in a spatially uniform manner (Fig. 3). Upon washing out the oxidant, the cells slowly reduced the roGFPs. Administering DTT usually accelerated this reaction. To calibrate these ratios, we attempted to use saturating doses of membrane-permeant reductants and oxidants to establish minimum and maximum ratios in situ. However, we generally could not achieve ratios as extreme as those from fully reduced or oxidized protein in microdroplets of buffer observed with the same imaging system (Fig. 4). Based on the in vitro ratios, roGFP1 in unperturbed HeLa cells was 16% oxidized, implying a basal redox potential of -315 mV. After the addition of 4 mm DTT or 0.5 mm aldrithiol (concentrations determined to cause maximal effects), the extent of roGFP1 oxidation changed to 6.5 and 72%, respectively. Unperturbed cells maintained roGFP2 5% oxidized, after which DTT reduced the ratio to 0% and aldrithiol oxidized the protein to a slightly greater ratio than obtainable in droplets of buffer on the microscope stage. Thus, roGFP2 reports a basal redox potential of -325 mV, reasonably consistent with the value seen by roGFP1.Fig. 4Dynamic range of roGFP ratios in cellsversusprotein microdroplets. roGFP1 and roGFP2 were expressed in HeLa cells. Ratio of fluorescence obtained at 400/480 (roGFP1) or 400/495 (roGFP2) maximum and minimum ratio was observed for protein microdroplets under the same conditions. Gray bars represent protein expressed in HeLa cells. Black bars represent free protein. A, roGFP1. B, roGFP2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Cells transiently expressing roGFPs were treated with 0.1 mm of the oxidants tested in vitro with the exception of GSSG, which does not cross cell membranes. Similar results were observed for both roGFP1 and roGFP2 (Fig. 5). The rank order of oxidant efficacies, aldrithiol, diamide > H2O2, menadione, DMNQ > oxidized BMES, and lipoate was similar to that in vitro, but 0.1 mm hydrogen peroxide or the quinones produced robust increases in ratio in cells within 10 min, whereas even 1 mm concentrations were not capable of full oxidation in vitro. Although oxidized BMES and lipoate were ineffective at 0.1 mm, at 5 mm they did cause considerable oxidation. However, this maximal effect was still somewhat less than that produced by 0.1 mm aldrithiol, so we concluded that redox buffers made from BMES and lipoate would probably not clamp intracellular redox potentials robustly enough to serve as standards for in situ calibration. To determine the roles of glutathione and catalase in maintaining cellular redox status under basal and H2O2-challenged conditions, cells were pretreated with buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), an inhibitor of GSH synthesis, or aminotriazole, a catalase inhibitor (Fig. 6). GSH depletion by BSO resulted in a small but significant (p < 0.05) increase in the resting excitation ratio of the probe and an even greater extent of oxidation due to (100 μm) hydrogen peroxide (p < 0.005). Pretreatment with BSO for 2, 5, or 24 h showed similar results. Pre-incubation with aminotriazole did not significantly change the basal excitation ratio (i.e. had no effect on the basal oxidation state) but was almost as effective as BSO at enhancing the response to 100 μm hydrogen peroxide. Identification of the reductase responsible for reducing the roGFPs in the cell was inconclusive, but reduction is most likely enzyme-dependent because it is observed immediately after removal of oxidant when there is little glutathione available for reduction. Unfortunately, the inhibitors of the NADPH reductases are selective rather than specific. We observed that inhibition of reduction following a 1-h preincubation with 100 μm cisplatin (thioredoxin reductase inhibitor (17Arner E.S. Nakamura H. Sasada T. Yodoi J. Holmgren A. Spyrou G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 1170-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar)) and 200 μm 5-methoxyindole-2-carboxylic acid (dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase inhibitor (18Haramaki N. Han D. Handelman G.J. Tritschler H.J. Packer L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar)) both prevented cells from reducing roGFPs after brief exposure to aldrithiol (Fig. 7). BCNU (carmustine) interacts with the roGFPs directly and could not be used for inhibition studies.Fig. 7Inhibition of cellular reduction of roGFP2. The reduction normally observed following oxidation with 100 μm aldrithiol was inhibited following a 1-h incubation with 200 μm 5-methoxyindole-2-carboxylic acid (MICA) or a 45-min incubation with 100 μm cisplatin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A possible explanation for H2O2 and the quinones being much more potent in cells than in vitro is that in cells they can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide, O2˙−, which might react more rapidly with the roGFPs. The superoxide generated in vitro by reaction of xanthine with xanthine oxidase was able to oxidize roGFPs to a modest extent (Fig. 8) but was greater than air oxidation observed in the control. However, the identical superoxide-generating system placed outside roGFP-expressing cells caused a much larger and faster response, even though superoxide would have to diffuse across the plasma membrane to reach the roGFP. Therefore, the effect of superoxide itself seems to be amplified inside cells. We considered the possibility that hydroxyl radicals generated from H2O2 by Fenton chemistry might be the kinetically reactive oxidants, but the addition of Fe(II) to H2O2 and roGFPs in vitro destroyed the protein fluorescence rather than accelerate the normal change in emission ratio. Another hypothesis might be that glutathione peroxidase or related enzymes either catalyze H2O2 reaction with roGFPs or generate enough GSSG to oxidize the roGFPs by thiol-disulfide exchange. However, commercially available glutathione peroxidase failed to accelerate H2O2 reaction in vitro with roGFPs with or without added GSH. Therefore, the basis for the enhanced H2O2 response in cells remains unclear. Redox Responses during Physiological Stimulation—Can roGFPs detect redox changes under physiological conditions and not just direct nonphysiological oxidants and reductants as tested above? The simplest challenge was to vary the partial pressure of O2 from 0 to 1 atm, corresponding to pO2 values ranging from anoxic to hyperoxic. Media bubbled with pure N2 or O2 were passed over roGFP-expressing HeLa, HEK293, PC12, or P388D1 cells in a closed perfusion chamber, but neither treatment caused any detectable change in the excitation ratios compared with air-saturated medium, even when the cells had been pretreated with BSO (reducing GSH levels) or aminotriazole (inhibiting catalase). Thus, cytosolic roGFPs (and presumably the intracellular redox potential) seem to be very well buffered against simple changes in pO2, in contrast to their sensitivity to H2O2, superoxide, and quinones. One of the most dramatic oxidative events in mammalian cells is the oxidative burst in immune cells, which plays a major role in destroying pathogens (4Droge W. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 47-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (7532) Google Scholar). Therefore, we expressed roGFPs in HL60 cells induced to differentiate into monocytes by incubation in 1.3% Me2SO for 7 days (19Collins S.J. Blood. 1987; 70: 1233-1244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and then stimulated with PMA to activate protein kinase C. Observation of time courses by microscopy was difficult because of poor transfection efficiency by electroporation (30%), incomplete transformation by Me2SO, and nonadherence of the cells. However, we were able to obtain the ratios by flow cytometry (FACSVantage SE, BD Biosciences). Upon application of 20 μm PMA, the roGFPs indicated substantial oxidation within 10-15 min (Fig. 9).

While the topological organization of individual reactions into metabolic networks is increasingly well understood, the principles governing their global functional utilization under different growth conditions pose many open questions. We implement a flux balance analysis of the E. coli MG1655 metabolism, finding that the network utilization is highly uneven: while most metabolic reactions have small fluxes, the metabolism's activity is dominated by several reactions with very high fluxes. E. coli responds to changes in growth conditions by reorganizing the rates of selected fluxes predominantly within this high flux backbone. The identified behavior likely represents a universal feature of metabolic activity in all cells, with potential implications to metabolic engineering."

Here we show that there is a defect in the editing of the messenger RNA encoding the GluR2 subunit of glutamate AMPA receptors in the spinal motor neurons of individuals affected by ALS. This failure to swap an arginine for a glutamine residue at a crucial site in the subunit, which occurs normally in the affected brain areas of patients with other neurodegenerative diseases, will interfere with the correct functioning of the glutamate receptors and may be a contributory cause of neuronal death in ALS patients."

https://openalex.org/W2035225324,"Hepatic glucokinase (GK) catalyzes the phosphorylation of glucose to glucose 6-phosphate (G6P), a step which is essential for glucose metabolism in liver as well as for the induction of glycolytic and lipogenic genes. The sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) has emerged as a major mediator of insulin action on hepatic gene expression, but the extent to which its transcriptional effect is caused by an increased glucose metabolism remains unclear. Through the use of hepatic GK knockout mice (hGK-KO) we have shown that the acute stimulation by glucose of l-pyruvate kinase (l-PK), fatty acid synthase (FAS), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and Spot 14 genes requires GK expression. To determine whether the effect of SREBP-1c requires GK expression and subsequent glucose metabolism, a transcriptionally active form of SREBP-1c was overexpressed both in vivo and in primary cultures of control and hGK-KO hepatocytes. Our results demonstrate that the synergistic action of SREBP-1c and glucose metabolism via GK is necessary for the maximal induction of l-PK, ACC, FAS, and Spot 14 gene expression. Indeed, in hGK-KO hepatocytes overexpressing SREBP-1c, the effect of glucose on glycolytic and lipogenic genes is lost because of the impaired ability of these hepatocytes to efficiently metabolize glucose, despite a marked increase in low Km hexokinase activity. Our studies also reveal that the loss of glucose effect observed in hGK-KO hepatocytes is associated with a decreased in the carbohydrate responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP) gene expression, a transcription factor suggested to mediate glucose signaling in liver. Decreased ChREBP gene expression, achieved using small interfering RNA, results in a loss of glucose effect on endogenous glycolytic (l-PK) and lipogenic (FAS, ACC) gene expression, thereby demonstrating the direct implication of ChREBP in glucose action.

Even small changes in the expression of hepatic GK have a very measurable impact on the blood glucose concentration in transgenic mice (2Hariharan N. Farrelly D. Hagan D. Hillyer D. Arbeeny C.

In cultured hepatocytes, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of GK elevates intracellular G6P concentrations, which trigger an increase in both glycolysis and glycogen synthesis (5Seoane J.

Furthermore, we have previously shown that hepatic GK knockout mice (hGK-KO mice) display mild basal hyperglycemia and exhibit a profound defect in liver glycogen synthesis and in glucose turnover rate during hyperglycemic clamp studies (6Postic C.

The major function of glycolysis in liver is to provide carbons from glucose for de novo lipid synthesis. The synthesis of fatty acids from glucose is nutritionally regulated, and it has been proposed that two signaling pathways elicited in response to dietary carbohydrates play a synergic role in regulating glycolytic (l-pyruvate kinase (l-PK)) and lipogenic gene expression (acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), fatty acid synthase (FAS), and Spot 14) (7Foufelle F. Ferré P. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 377-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Indeed, the transcriptional induction of l-PK (8Decaux J.F. Antoine B. Kahn A. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1995; 230: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) requires both glucose metabolism and insulin, and it is widely thought that the role of insulin is to induce GK gene expression, which is then essential for subsequent glucose phosphorylation (1Girard J. Ferré P. Foufelle F. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 325-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 7Foufelle F. Ferré P. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 377-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). In the past few years, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) has emerged as a major mediator of insulin action on hepatic GK (11Foretz M. Guichard C. Ferré P. Foufelle F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12737-12742Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar) and lipogenic gene expression (7Foufelle F. Ferré P. Biochem.

Indeed, SREBP-1c, which is induced by insulin in primary cultures of hepatocytes (13Foretz M. Pacot C. Dugail I. Lemarchand P. Guichard C. Le Liepvre X. Berthelier-Lubrano C. Spiegelman B. Kim J.B. Ferré P. Foufelle F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3760-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), is able to induce lipogenic genes by its capacity to bind to the sterol regulatory element (SRE) present in their promoters (14Magana M.M.

Since a glucose- or carbohydrate-response element (ChoRE) was also identified in both glycolytic and lipogenic genes through promoter mapping analysis (17Rufo C. Teran-Garcia M. Nakamura M.T.

Chem. 2001; 276: 16033-16039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), it remains to be determined whether glucose metabolism, which could account by itself for the induction of these genes, is necessary for the transcriptional effect of SREBP-1c. In addition, the recent identification of a glucose-responsive transcription factor named ChREBP (carbohydrate responsive element-binding protein) (20Yamashita H. Takenoshita M. Sakurai M. Bruick R.K. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Arnot D. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9116-9121Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) has shed light on the possible mechanism whereby glucose affects gene transcription and further supports the hypothesis that glucose acts through a distinct, but synergic, signaling pathway through insulin to regulate glycolytic and lipogenic gene expression in liver. These studies were undertaken: 1) to elucidate the role of the hepatic GK in the control of the transcriptional regulation of glycolytic and lipogenic gene expression by glucose, 2) to test whether the stimulatory effect of SREBP-1c is linked to glucose metabolism via GK, and 3) to determine the direct implication of ChREBP in mediating glucose signaling in liver. For this purpose, nutritional regulation studies were performed in hepatic-specific GK knockout mice (hGK-KO mice) (6Postic C. Shiota M. Niswender K.D. Jetton T.L. Chen Y. Moates J.M. Shelton K.D. Lindner J. Cherrington A.D. Magnuson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 305-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). An adenovirus expressing a dominant positive form of SREBP-1c was used in vivo and in primary cultured hepatocytes, to determine whether glucose metabolism via GK is necessary for the maximal induction of glycolytic and lipogenic gene expression by SREBP-1c. In addition, ChREBP “knock-down” experiments using small interfering RNA (siRNA) were performed in control hepatocytes to determine the direct implication of this transcription factor in glucose signaling. We found that hepatic GK is necessary for the activation of glycolytic and lipogenic gene expression in liver, and that the synergistic action of SREBP-1c and glucose metabolism via GK is necessary for the maximal induction of l-PK, ACC, FAS, and Spot 14 gene expression. This study also reveals that ChREBP gene expression is decreased in hepatocytes from hGK-KO mice and that ChREBP gene silencing in control hepatocytes abolishes the glucose effect on l-PK, FAS, and ACC, providing the first direct evidence (in a physiological context) that ChREBP mediates glucose signaling on both glycolytic and lipogenic gene expression in liver. Animals—3-5-month-old control (gklox/lox) or hepatic glucokinase-null (gklox/lox + Alb-cre or hGK-KO) male mice (6Postic C. Shiota M. Niswender K.D. Jetton T.L. Chen Y. Moates J.M. Shelton K.D. Lindner J. Cherrington A.D. Magnuson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 305-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar) bred into a C57BL/6J genetic background at least for 9 generations were used for this study. All mice were housed in colony cages with a 12-h light/dark cycle. All procedures were carried out according to the French guidelines for the care and use of experimental animals. Mice had free access to water and food (in terms of energy: 65% carbohydrate, 11% fat, 24% protein, UAR). Nutritional Studies—For the fasting and refeeding studies, mice from each genotype were divided into two groups. One was fasted for 24 h, and the refed group was fasted for 24 h and then refed for 18 h with a high carbohydrate diet (in terms of energy: 72.2% carbohydrate, 1% fat, 26.8% protein). After intraperitoneal pentobarbital anesthesia (70 mg/kg body weight), livers from mice of both genotypes were rapidly sampled, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and kept at -80 °C until RNA extraction or metabolic assays. Analytical Procedures—The concentration of plasma insulin was determined by radioimmunoassay using a rat insulin radioimmunoassay kit (Diasorin). The binding reactions were modified to perform the assay on 10 μl of plasma. Primary Culture of Hepatocytes and Treatment with Recombinant Adenovirus—Hepatocytes were isolated from the livers of fed mice by a modification of the collagenase method (21Berry M.N. Friend D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1969; 43: 506-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (3601) Google Scholar). Briefly, livers from control and hGK-KO mice were perfused with Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS, KCl, 5.4 mm; KH2PO4, 0.45 mm; NaCl, 138 mm; NaHCO3, 4.2 mm; Na2HPO4, 0.34 mm; glucose, 5.5 mm; HEPES, 1 m; EGTA, 50 mm; CaCl2, 50 mm; pH 7.4). Livers were washed at a rate of 5 ml/min using the portal vein before collagenase (0.025%) was added. Cell viability was assessed by the trypan blue exclusion test and was always higher than 60%. Hepatocytes were seeded at a density of 2 × 106 cells (in 60-mm Petri dishes for RNA extraction) or 5 × 106 cells (in 100-mm Petri dishes for metabolite concentration assays) in medium M199 with Earle salts (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10 μg/ml of streptomycin, 100 units/ml of penicillin, 2.4 mm of glutamine, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 2% (v/v) Ultrocer G (Invitrogen), 100 nm dexamethasone (Soludecadron, Merck Sharp), and 100 nm insulin (Actrapid, Novo-Nordisk). After cell attachment (6 h), the medium was replaced by fresh M199 medium for 24 h. Hepatocytes were then incubated for 120 min at 37 °C in 1 ml of M199 medium with 1 plaque-forming unit per cell (pfu/cell) of either adenovirus null (Ad-null) or adenovirus SREBP-1c (Ad-SREBP-1c), in the presence of 5 or 25 mm glucose. Then fresh medium was added, and cells were maintained in culture for 24 h; the efficiency of the adenoviral infection always approximated 90%. The adenovirus vector containing the transcriptionally active N-terminal fragment (amino acids 1-403c) of SREBP-1c (Ad-SREBP-1c) was previously described (13Foretz M. Pacot C. Dugail I. Lemarchand P. Guichard C. Le Liepvre X. Berthelier-Lubrano C. Spiegelman B. Kim J.B. Ferré P. Foufelle F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3760-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The adenovirus vector containing the promoter with no exogenous gene (Ad-null) was used as a negative control (13Foretz M. Pacot C. Dugail I. Lemarchand P. Guichard C. Le Liepvre X. Berthelier-Lubrano C. Spiegelman B. Kim J.B. Ferré P. Foufelle F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3760-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Injection of Recombinant Adenovirus—Twenty-four hours fasted control and hGK-KO mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (Belamont, France) prior to the injection through the penis vein with 109 pfu of either Ad-null or Ad-SREBP-1c in a final volume of 200 μl of sterile phosphate-buffered saline. Mice were studied 18 h after the injection (between 8:00 and 10:00 a.m). Livers were then removed and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. Blood samples were taken by heart puncture for both glucose and insulin measurements. Small Interfering RNA Preparation and Transfection Protocol—21-nucleotide RNA with 3′-dTdT overhangs was synthesized using 2′-OACE-RNA phosphoramidites by Dharmacon Research (Lafayette, CO) in the “ready to use” option, in deprotected and desalted form. The siRNA sequence targeting mouse ChREBP (GenBank™ accession number, AF156604) was from position 747 relative to the start codon. The AA-N19 mRNA targets were 5′-UGUUGGCAAUGCUGACAUG-3′ for ChREBP siRNA and 5′-AUCGAUCGAUCGAUGUGUG-3′ for scrambled siRNA. Primary cultures of control hepatocytes were transiently transfected with siRNA duplexes using the technique described by Boussif et al. (22Boussif O. Lezoualc'h F. Zanta M.A. Mergny M.D. Scherman D. Demeneix B. Behr J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7297-7301Crossref PubMed Scopus (5526) Google Scholar). Briefly, after cell attachment, the medium was replaced by fresh M199 medium for 24 h. Control hepatocytes were then transfected with 200 pmol of either ChREBP or scrambled siRNA and polyethylenimine (PEI) in M199 medium, supplemented with 100 mm dexamethasone and 100 nm insulin, in the presence of 5 mm glucose. Transfection was accomplished by dilution of PEI and siRNA in 50 μl of NaCl (150 mm). In order to increase the efficiency of transfection, 30 pfu/cell of Ad-RSV-nlsLacZ (Rous sarcoma virus promoter driving the nlsLacZ gene) was added simultaneously to the hepatocytes (23Louet J.F. Chatelain F. Decaux J.F. Park E.A. Kohl C. Pineau T. Girard J. Pegorier J.P. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). After transfection (5 h), the medium was changed, and control transfected hepatocytes were cultured for 24 h in M199 medium supplemented with 100 mm dexamethasone and 100 nm insulin. Then, fresh M199 medium was added for 24 h, in the presence of 5 or 25 mm glucose, 100 mm dexamethasone, and 100 nm insulin. Enzyme Activities—GK activities were measured in cell extracts prepared from cultured hepatocytes. Around 8 × 106 cells were lysed in 500 μl of homogenization buffer consisting of 50 mm triethanolamine hydrochloride (pH 7.3), 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin. Homogenates were collected in Eppendorf tubes, incubated for 10 min on ice with PEG 25%, and then centrifuged at 10, 000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Glucose phosphorylating activities were measured by an enzymatic method that measures the production of NADPH from NADP+ in the presence of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) (Roche Applied Science), in the presence of either 100 mm glucose and 0.5 mm glucose, to distinguish HK from GK activity. The assay buffer contained 100 mm triethanolamine hydrochloride (pH 8), 40 mm MgCl2, 200 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 5 mm ATP, 1 mm NADP, and 30 units/ml of G6PDH. The phosphorylating capacity obtained at 0.5 mm glucose is considered the hexokinase activity, whereas the subtraction of activity measured at 100 mm glucose from the activity measured at 0.5 mm glucose is considered the glucokinase activity of the extract. Glucose phosphorylating activity was taken as the increase in NADPH absorbance measured at 340 nm after 3 min at 25 °C, expressed in milliunits per mg of protein. Protein concentration was measured using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad, Laboratory) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Measurement of Glucose 6-Phosphate and Glycogen Concentrations—G6P concentrations were determined in cell extracts prepared from cultured hepatocytes or from liver samples by an enzymatic method (24Davidson A.L. Arion W.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 253: 156-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Briefly, after removing the culture medium, 10 × 106 cells were scraped or 200 mg of livers were homogenized into 1 ml of 4% (v/v) ice-cold perchloric acid. After centrifugation (10 min at 3000 × g), the acid supernatant was neutralized and used for spectrophotometric determination of both G6P and glycogen concentrations. A 500-μl aliquot was used for spectrophotometric determination of G6P in 0.4 m triethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 7.6, 0.5 m Mg2+ containing 24 mm of NADP+. The increased absorbance at 340 nm after addition of 30 units/ml of G6PDH was measured. Results were expressed as nmol of G6P/106 cells or as nmol of G6P/mg of liver weight. In liver samples, glycogen from the neutralized supernatant was digested (1 h at 55 °C) with 40 units/ml of α-(1-4)-(1-6)-amyloglucosidase (Roche Applied Science). Glycogen concentration in liver samples was measured by a colorimetric method using the peridochrom glucose kit reagent (Roche Applied Science), and results were expressed as mg of glycogen/mg of liver weight. Glycogen content in cultured hepatocytes was measured by an enzymatic method. Briefly, after digestion by the α-(1-4)-(1-6)-amyloglucosidase, 100 μl of each sample were incubated with 1 ml of Tris buffer (0.1 m, pH 8.5) for 10 min at 25 °C with 2 mm NADP, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, and 30 units/ml of G6PDH. Glycogen concentration was quantified by measuring the change in absorbance at 340 nm, 10 min after addition of 30 units/ml of hexokinase (Roche Applied Science). A glucose solution (1 g/liter) was used as standard. Results were expressed as nmol of glycogen/106 cells. Measurement of Xylulose 5-Phosphate—Xylulose 5-phosphate (X5P) concentrations were determined in cell extracts prepared from cultured hepatocytes by an enzymatic method (9Mourrieras F. Foufelle F. Foretz M. Morin J. Bouche S. Ferré P. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, X5P, from the neutralized supernatant previously used for G6P and glycogen determination, was assayed spectrophotometrically in a reaction using transketolase (EC 2.2.1.1) (Sigma) in the presence of ribose 5-phosphate, thiamine pyrophosphate, MgCl2, coupled to triosephosphate isomerase and α-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (Sigma) in the presence of NADH. The decreased absorbance at 340 nm after addition of 20 units/ml of transketolase was measured. Results were expressed as nmol of X5P/106 cells. Isolation of Total RNA and Northern Blot Analysis—Total cellular RNAs from whole liver were extracted by using the guanidinium thiocyanate method (25Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar), and RNA from cultured hepatocytes were extracted using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Northern blot analyses were performed as described previously (3Niswender K.D. Shiota M. Postic C. Cherrington A.D. Magnuson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22570-22572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Labeling of each DNA probe with [α-32P]dATP was performed by random priming (Megaprime labeling kit, Amersham Biosciences). Autoradiograms of Northern blots were scanned and quantified using an image processor program (Chemi Genius). The GK probe was a 2000 bp EcoRI-EcoRI insert from pUCGK1 (26Iynedjian P.B. Ucla C.

Ethidium bromide stained 18 S RNA was used as loading control to normalize the signal obtained for a given gene. Analysis of mRNA Expression by Real-time Quantitative PCR—Total RNA (500 ng) was reverse-transcribed for 1 h at 42 °C in a 20-μl final volume reaction containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mm random hexamers (Promega), 250 ng of oligo(dT) (Promega), 2 mm of each dNTPs, and 100 units of superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Real-time quantitative PCR analysis was performed starting with 6.25 ng of reverse-transcribed total RNA, in a final volume of 10-μl PCR reaction, with 0.5 μm of each primer (Invitrogen), 2 mm MgCl2, using 1× light cycler DNA Master SYBR Green I mix in a light cycler instrument (Roche Applied Science). Samples were incubated in the light cycler apparatus for an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles. Each cycle consisted of 95 °C for 15 s, 58 °C for 7 s, and 72 °C for 15 s. The specific primers used are described in Table I. SYBR Green I fluorescence emission was determined after each cycle. The relative amounts of the different mRNAs were quantified by using the second derivative maximum method of the light-cycler software. Cyclophilin was used as an invariant control, and the relative quantification for a given gene was corrected to the cyclophilin mRNA values. Amplification of specific transcripts was confirmed by melting curves profiles generated at the end of each run. PCR specificity and product length were further checked by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining.Table IRT-PCR primersGeneSequenceLengthpbCyclophilinSense5′-ATGGCACTGGCGGCAGGTCC-3′125Antisense5′-TTGCCATTCCTGGACCCAAA-3′Hexokinase IISense5′-AACCGAACAAGCTGGTGTAC-3′202Antisense5′-TGCACACATCTATAGGTGGC-3′Hexokinase ISense5′-TCTCCAGAATCATGGACCA-3′155Antisense5′-GATCCTGCTCTTAGGCGTTC-3′ChREBPSense5′-CTGGGGACCTAAACAGGAGC-3′155Antisense5′-GAAGCCACCCTATAGCTCCC-3′GlucokinaseSense5′-CCCTGAGTGGCTTACAGTTC-3′143Antisense5′-ACGGATGTGAGTGTTGAAGC-3′SREBP-1Sense5′-AACGTCACTTCCAGCTAGAC-3′187Antisense5′-CCACTAAGGTGCCTACAGAGC-3′FASSense5′-TTCCAAGACGAAAATGATGC-3′137Antisense5′-AATTGTGGGATCAGGAGAGC-3′l-PKSense5′-CTTGCTCTACCGTGAGCCTC-3′122Antisense5′-ACCACAATCACCAGATCACC-3′ACCSense5′-AGCAGATCCGCAGCTTG-3′97Antisense5′-ACCTCTGCTCGCTGAGTGC-3′ Open table in a new tab Preparation of Nuclear Extracts and Immunoblot Analysis—Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from livers of control and hGK-KO mice using the NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagent kit (Pierce), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Proteins from nuclear extracts (50 μg) and from the cytoplasmic fraction (50 μg) from livers of control and hGK-KO mice were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis on a 10% gel. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Proteins were electrotransferred onto Hybon C nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). SREBP-1 was detected with a mouse monoclonal antibody (SREBP-1 Ab-1, dilution 1:1000, NeoMarkers, Interchim) raised against amino acids 301-407 of human SREBP-1, for 4 h. Detection of signals was performed using the ECL Western blot detection kit (Pierce) with anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG (dilution 1:10,000, Pierce) as second antibody. Monoclonal mouse β-actin (Sigma, clone AC.74, dilution 1:1000) and polyclonal rabbit Lamin A/C (Cell Signaling Technology, dilution 1:1000) antibody were used as loading controls to normalize the signal obtained respectively for membrane and nuclear SREBP-1 protein.

https://openalex.org/W2063339845,"Food webs are descriptions of who eats whom in an ecosystem. Although extremely complex and variable, their structure possesses basic regularities1,2,3,4,5,6. A fascinating question is to find a simple model capturing the underlying processes behind these repeatable patterns. Until now, two models have been devised for the description of trophic interactions within a natural community7,8. Both are essentially based on the concept of ecological niche, with the consumers organized along a single niche dimension; for example, prey size8,9. Unfortunately, they fail to describe adequately recent and high-quality data. Here, we propose a new model built on the hypothesis that any species' diet is the consequence of phylogenetic constraints and adaptation. Simple rules incorporating both concepts yield food webs whose structure is very close to real data. Consumers are organized in groups forming a nested hierarchy, which better reflects the complexity and multidimensionality of most natural systems."
https://openalex.org/W2133893126,"The structural clues of substrate recognition by calpain are incompletely understood. In this study, 106 cleavage sites in substrate proteins compiled from the literature have been analyzed to dissect the signal for calpain cleavage and also to enable the design of an ideal calpain substrate and interfere with calpain action via site-directed mutagenesis. In general, our data underline the importance of the primary structure of the substrate around the scissile bond in the recognition process. Significant amino acid preferences were found to extend over 11 residues around the scissile bond, from P4 to P7′. In compliance with earlier data, preferred residues in the P2 position are Leu, Thr, and Val, and in P1 Lys, Tyr, and Arg. In position P1 ′, small hydrophilic residues, Ser and to a lesser extent Thr and Ala, occur most often. Pro dominates the region flanking the P2-P1′ segment, i.e. positions P3 and P2′-P4′; most notable is its occurrence 5.59 times above chance in P3′. Intriguingly, the segment C-terminal to the cleavage site resembles the consensus inhibitory region of calpastatin, the specific inhibitor of the enzyme. Further, the position of the scissile bond correlates with certain sequential attributes, such as secondary structure and PEST score, which, along with the amino acid preferences, suggests that calpain cleaves within rather disordered segments of proteins. The amino acid preferences were confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis of the autolysis sites of Drosophila calpain B; when amino acids at key positions were changed to less preferred ones, autolytic cleavage shifted to other, adjacent sites. Based on these preferences, a new fluorogenic calpain substrate, DABCYLTPLKSPPPSPR-EDANS, was designed and synthesized. In the case of μ- and m-calpain, this substrate is kinetically superior to commercially available ones, and it can be used for the in vivo assessment of the activity of these ubiquitous mammalian calpains.

It is generally held that calpains, intracellular cysteine proteases, play crucial roles in basic physiological (1Sorimachi H. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 2Ono Y. Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Med. 2001; 7: 355-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) processes. This view is partially based on the fact that calpains cleave their substrates in a limited manner, modifying, rather than terminating, their action. So far, more than 100 proteins have been identified as calpain substrates; among them, cytoskeletal/structural proteins, membrane receptors, enzymes, and transcription factors abound (5Wang K.K. Villalobo A. Roufogalis B.D. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 693-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 6Wang K.K.W. Yuen P.-w. Wang K.K.W. Yuen P.-w. Calpain: Pharmacology and Toxicology of Calcium-dependent Protease. Taylor and Francis, Philadelphia1999: 77-101Google Scholar). Despite this wealth of data, the sequential/structural determinants of calpain cleavage are little understood. Early studies on small fluorogenic peptides (7Sasaki T. Kikuchi T. Yumoto N. Yoshimura N. Murachi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12489-12494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and peptide hormones (7Sasaki T. Kikuchi T. Yumoto N. Yoshimura N. Murachi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12489-12494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Hirao T. Takahashi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 96: 775-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) have led to the so-called P2-P1 rule, which states that the preferred residues for the ubiquitous forms, μ- and m-calpain, are Leu and Val at position P2, whereas in P1 Arg and Lys (and to a lesser extent Tyr) occur most often (9Takahashi K. Mellgren R.L. Murachi T. Calpain Substrate Specificity. CRC Press, Boca Raton1990Google Scholar). Additional, weaker, preferences have also been noted for positions P3 (Phe, Trp, Leu, Val) and P1′ (Arg, Lys, Leu). An elegant study encompassing all possible point mutations at the P2 position of the principal cleavage site of fodrin has shown good correlation with the P2-P1 rule (10Stabach P.R. Cianci C.D. Glantz S.B. Zhang Z. Morrow J.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar); other studies on protein substrates, however, displayed frequent deviations (11Sakai K. Akanuma H. Imahori K. Kawashima S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 101: 911-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 12Banik N.L. Chou C.H. Deibler G.E. Krutzch H.C. Hogan E.L. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 37: 489-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These observations suggested that calpain cleavage, to a large extent, depends on higher order structural clues. This aspect of substrate recognition was convincingly demonstrated in histone hydrolysis, where cleavage of sites susceptible in the intact protein was restrained in its fragments (11Sakai K. Akanuma H. Imahori K. Kawashima S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 101: 911-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). It was concluded that calpain probably recognizes global structural elements present in the intact protein but absent from its smaller fragments. This recognition has fueled efforts to uncover these putative higher order structural elements. In the above report (11Sakai K. Akanuma H. Imahori K. Kawashima S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 101: 911-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) it was suggested that cleavage, as in histone, may never occur in the middle of either an hydrophobic or hydrophilic cluster but always at the border separating them. In another, comprehensive treatise including most protein substrates known at the time (5Wang K.K. Villalobo A. Roufogalis B.D. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 693-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) it was found that calpain substrates often have a calmodulin-binding motif and targeting of the enzyme may occur by an adjacent PEST 1The abbreviations used are: PEST, Pro, Glu(Asp), and Ser/Thr region; DABCYL, 4-(4-dimethylaminophenylazo)benzoic acid; EDANS, 5-[(2-aminoethyl) amino]naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid; FRET, Förstertype resonance energy transfer; LY-AMC, N-succinyl-Leu-Tyr-7-amido-4-methylcoumarine; DCM, dichloromethane; DIEA, N,N-diisopropylethylamine; RP-HPLC, reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography; BOC, tert-butyloxycarbonyl; Fmoc, 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl; DMF, N,N-dimethylformamide. sequence. This idea was raised in the original proposal of the PEST hypothesis, i.e. that the occurrence of region(s) rich in amino acids Pro, Glu(Asp), and Ser/Thr flanked by Arg/Lys residues correlates with the short lifetime of proteins (13Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1964) Google Scholar, 14Rechsteiner M. Rogers S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 267-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar). Such a negatively charged region was thought to bind Ca2+ and provide both peptide bonds and the necessary co-factor for calpain action. Subsequent experimental testing of these suggestions brought controversial results, though. Purification of μ-calpain by an immobilized peptide containing the calmodulin-binding motif of plasma membrane ATPase supported the involvement of such region(s) (15Molinari M. Maki M. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14576-14581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Attempts with the PEST motif, however, yielded equivocal results. In some instances mutation of the PEST sequence abolished calpain cleavage (16Noguchi M. Sarin A. Aman M.J. Nakajima H. Shores E.W. Henkart P.A. Leonard W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11534-11539Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 17Shumway S.D. Maki M. Miyamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30874-30881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) but was without effect in other cases (18Molinari M. Anagli J. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2032-2035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 19Carillo S. Pariat M. Steff A. Jariel-Encontre I. Poulat F. Berta P. Piechaczyk M. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, whether a PEST region provides a degradation signal for calpain, is still an open issue. In general, higher order clues still lay largely hidden in the structure of calpain substrates, and recent reviews on the subject (2Ono Y. Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 6Wang K.K.W. Yuen P.-w. Wang K.K.W. Yuen P.-w. Calpain: Pharmacology and Toxicology of Calcium-dependent Protease.

Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 20-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar) resort to the P2-P1 rule unveiled a long time ago. In our view, the major drawback of this point of reference is that it is mostly based on studies with peptides, known to be poor calpain substrates (9Takahashi K. Mellgren R.L. Murachi T. Calpain Substrate Specificity. CRC Press, Boca Raton1990Google Scholar). Further, the use of a small number of peptides limits the range of amino acid combinations tested, and thus biases the amino acid preferences observed. An incomparably larger and more complete set of potential substrate sites is represented by the proteome, of which the cleavable ones make their way into the literature as calpain substrates. To advance our understanding of what constitutes a calpain site, we carried out a systematic analysis of these data and constructed a preference matrix. The sequential preferences manifest in this matrix point to some general aspects of the primary structure in substrate recognition by μ- and m-calpain. Furthermore, the versatile applicability of this matrix in engineering substrates of these ubiquitous calpains is also described in this report. Data Collection and Analysis—49 calpain substrates with a total of 106 sequentially identified cleavage sites have been selected from the literature. For homologous substrates cleaved at identical sites, only one species (preferably human) was considered. The protein sequences were downloaded from the Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL databases via the ExPASy molecular biology server (www.expasy.ch). The sequences were truncated to 50 amino acids in both the N- and C-terminal direction from the scissile bond and used for further studies. Amino acid frequency matrices and profile scores were calculated by a program written in the Python programming language. The amino acid composition of the complete Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL data base used for normalizing matrices was taken from Swiss-Prot (us.expasy.org/sprot/). Sequential attributes were calculated or predicted by the appropriate servers: PEST-score with the PESTfind algorithm (www.at.embnet.org/embnet/tools/bio/PESTfind), secondary structure with the nnPredict site (www.cmpharm.ucsf.edu/∼nomi/nnpredict.html), and hydrophobicity with ProtScale (us.expasy.org/cgi-bin/protscale.pl). These servers are available via ExPASy. For strong and weak PEST regions detected by the PESTfind algorithm, we arbitrarily assigned a score of 3 and 1. For scoring the border of a weak PEST region, its flanking hexapeptide was assigned weights of 1, 2, 4, 4, 2, and 1. For a strong PEST region, weights of 1, 3, 9, 9, 3, and 1 were used; in both cases all other residues were set to 0. Synthesis of FRET Substrate—The substrate, designed on the basis of the observed amino acid preferences of calpain cleavage, is an 11-mer peptide with the sequence of Thr-Pro-Leu-Lys-Ser-Pro-Pro-Pro-Ser-Pro-Arg, with a fluorescent donor, EDANS (Sigma) attached to its C terminus and a quenching acceptor, DABCYL attached to the N terminus. Since the measurement of calpain activity is based on the increase of donor fluorescence due to cessation of FRET between the EDANS and DABCYL groups upon cleavage (21Matayoshi E.D. Wang G.T. Krafft G.A. Erickson J. Science. 1990; 247: 954-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar), this substrate is termed as the FRET substrate throughout the article. The peptide was synthesized on 0.2 g of Boc-Arg(Mts)-PAM-resin (0.31 mmol/g) (from NovaBiochem, Laufelfingen, Switzerland) by Boc (tert-butyloxycarbonyl) chemistry. Side chains of threonine and serines were protected with benzyl groups, whereas the ϵ-amino group of lysine was blocked by an Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl) group. (All Boc amino acid derivatives were obtained from Reanal, Budapest, Hungary.) Boc protection was removed with 33% trifluoroacetic acid in DCM (2 + 20 min) followed by washing with DCM (5 × 0.5 min), neutralization with 10% DIEA in DCM (3 × 1 min), and DCM wash (4 × 0.5 min). The amino acid derivatives and coupling reagents (N,N,N′-dicyclohexyl carbodiimide and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole, at 1:1 molar ratio) dissolved in DCM-DMF (N,N-dimethylformamide) 4:1 (v/v) were used in 3 molar excess for the resin capacity. The coupling reaction was continued for 60 min at room temperature, and the resin was washed with DMF (2 × 0.5 min) and DCM (3 × 0.5 min). The efficiency of coupling was checked by ninhydrin or isatin tests. The N-terminal Boc group was removed from the protected peptide prior to cleavage by hydrogen-fluoride. The peptide was removed from the resin with 10 ml of hydrogen fluoride containing 0.5 g of p-cresol. The crude product was purified by RP-HPLC. DABCYL was coupled to the N-terminal amino group of the purified H-TPLK(Fmoc) SPPPSPR-OH peptide in solution. Peptide was dissolved in DMF and reacted with DABCYL succinimide ester (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) in the presence of DIEA (DABCYL succinimide/DIEA/peptide = 2:1:1 mol/mol/mol). The crude product was purified by RP-HPLC. The Nϵ-Fmoc group of the purified DABCYL-TPLK(Fmoc)SPPPSPR-OH peptide was removed with 20% piperidine/DMF. The peptide was purified by RP-HPLC. EDANS was attached to the C terminus of the DABCYL-peptide in DMF, using the following molar ratio: peptide/EDANS/EDC×HCl/1-hydroxybenzotriazole/DIEA = 1:2:4.5:6.8:9 (mol/mol). The target peptide was purified by RP-HPLC. The peptides were characterized by analytical HPLC (see below), amino acid analysis using a Beckman (Fullerton, CA) model 6300 amino acid analyzer and by mass spectra recorded on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences API 2000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Sciex, Toronto, Canada). Analytical RP-HPLC was performed on a Knauer (Bad Homburg, Germany) HPLC system using Phenomenex Synergi MAX-RP C12 column (250 × 4.6 inner diameter) with 5-mm silica (80 Å pore size) as a stationary phase. Linear gradient elution (0 min, 0% B; 5 min, 0% B; 50 min, 90% B) with eluent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water) and eluent B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile/water (80:20, v/v)) was used at a flow rate of 1 ml/min at ambient temperature. Sample was dissolved in eluent B, and peaks were detected at a λ of 220 nm. The crude product was purified on a semipreparative Phenomenex Jupiter C18 column (250 × 10-mm inner diameter) with silica (300 Å pore size). The peptides were checked by amino acid analysis using a Model 6300 amino acid analyzer, and mass spectra were recorded on an API 2000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Calpain B Mutagenesis and Autolysis Experiments—Calpain B autolysis sites (22Farkas A. Tompa P. Schad E. Sinka R. Jekely G. Friedrich P. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 299-305Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were mutated with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's recommendations using the following primers: 5′-CGAGTCATGCCGGTGTTCCGTCGTATGCGGGAC-3′ and 5′-GTCCCGCATACGACGGAACACCGGCATGACTCG-3′ for the first major site; 5′-GAAGGTGCCCGAGGCTGTTAACATGTTTTGG-3′ and 5′-CAAAACATGTTAACAGCCTCGGGCACCTTC-3′ for the second major site (22Farkas A. Tompa P. Schad E. Sinka R. Jekely G. Friedrich P. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 299-305Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Calpain B autolysis reaction was started in calpain buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA) with 10 mm free Ca2+ and run for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer and 5 min of boiling. Samples were run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Enzyme Activity Measurements—Activity measurements were carried out with m-calpain, calpain A, calpain B, papain, trypsin, chymotrypsin, and cathepsin-B. Enzyme activity was measured with a Jasco FP 777 spectrofluorometer at excitation/emission wavelengths of 380/460 nm for LY-AMC (Sigma) and 320/480 nm for the FRET substrate, in a 3 × 3 mm quartz cuvette. The reaction mixture in 50 μl of calpain buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm benzamidine, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5) contained various substrate concentrations and 3 mm free Ca2+ in the case of m-calpain and 19 mm free Ca2+ in the case of calpain A and calpain B. The reaction was started by rapidly mixing the enzyme in the reaction mixture. The enzyme concentrations typically used were as follows: 0.2 μm m-calpain, 4.8 μm calpain A, 1.8 μm calpain B, 1.0 μm papain, 1.0 μm trypsin, 40.0 μm chymotrypsin, and 10.0 μm cathepsin B. Data were analyzed by the MicroCal Origin data analysis software to determine the initial slope of fluorescence change. Calpain Activity Measurements in Vivo—In vivo calpain activity was measured in cultured Drosophila S2 cells. The cell cultures were maintained in Drosophila SFM (Invitrogen) medium supplemented with 20 mm l-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin at 23 °C. Four hours prior to starting the experiments, 200 μl of S2 cells (3 × 106 cell/ml) were lipofected with 200 μl of FRET substrate (giving a final substrate concentration of 280 μm in the medium) either without or with 15 μm calpastatin, using Cellfectin (Invitrogen) reagent. The protocol provided by the manufacturer was followed. Control cells were treated with the same amount of Cellfectin, but without the addition of the FRET substrate. Before measurement, lipofected cells were collected by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 4 min at room temperature and were resuspended in 400 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. This washing procedure was repeated twice to remove all the remaining substrate from the medium. 50 μl of cell suspension was transferred to a 3 × 3 mm quartz cuvette for recording fluorescence. Measurements with lipofected and control cells were started by the addition of 10 μm ionomycin either with or without 500 nm E-64 or calpain inhibitor II (both are cell permeable calpain inhibitors). The fluorescence measurements and data analysis were done similarly to the in vitro experiments. COS-7 Cell Extracts—COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) at 37 °C and 5% CO2 content. Confluent cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and were scraped in 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline.

https://openalex.org/W2037427451,"The volcanism responsible for creating the chain of the Hawaiian islands and seamounts is believed to mark the passage of the oceanic lithosphere over a mantle plume. In this picture hot material rises from great depth within a fixed narrow conduit to the surface, penetrating the moving lithosphere. Although a number of models describe possible plume-lithosphere interactions, seismic imaging techniques have not had sufficient resolution to distinguish between them. Here we apply the S-wave 'receiver function' technique to data of three permanent seismic broadband stations on the Hawaiian islands, to map the thickness of the underlying lithosphere. We find that under Big Island the lithosphere is 100-110 km thick, as expected for an oceanic plate 90-100 million years old that is not modified by a plume. But the lithosphere thins gradually along the island chain to about 50-60 km below Kauai. The width of the thinning is about 300 km. In this zone, well within the larger-scale topographic swell, we infer that the rejuvenation model (where the plume thins the lithosphere) is operative; however, the larger-scale topographic swell is probably supported dynamically."

Such fibrillation has long complicated its manufacture and use in the therapy of diabetes mellitus. Of interest as a model for disease-associated amyloids, insulin fibrillation is proposed to occur via partial unfolding of a monomeric intermediate. Here, we describe the solution structure of human insulin under amyloidogenic conditions (pH 2.4 and 60 °C). Use of an enhanced sensitivity cryogenic probe at high magnetic field avoids onset of fibrillation during spectral acquisition. A novel partial fold is observed in which the N-terminal segments of the A- and B-chains detach from the core. Unfolding of the N-terminal α-helix of the A-chain exposes a hydrophobic surface formed by native-like packing of the remaining α-helices. The C-terminal segment of the B-chain, although not well ordered, remains tethered to this partial helical core. We propose that detachment of N-terminal segments makes possible aberrant protein-protein interactions in an amyloidogenic nucleus. Non-cooperative unfolding of the N-terminal A-chain α-helix resembles that observed in models of proinsulin folding intermediates and foreshadows the extensive α → β transition characteristic of mature fibrils.

Although acidic conditions preclude formation of hexamers (presumably because of protonation of a histidine at the trimer interface), 3Zinc coordination is mediated in insulin hexamers by the imidizole ring of HisB10; three symmetry-related side chains participate in each of two axial zinc-binding sites (21Baker E.N.

Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 479-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The dimer dissociates at high temperature, leading rapidly to non-native aggregation and formation of fibrils (16Bouchard M.

Circular dichroism (CD) and spectral deconvolution analysis demonstrate substantial but incomplete retention of native α-helix content. To define the structure of this partial fold, we have employed cryogenic NMR probe technology at high magnetic field: enhanced sensitivity facilitates data acquisition prior to detectable aggregation. Ultra-rapid three-dimensional (3D) 1H-15N NMR spectroscopy enables complete resonance assignment despite limited chemical shift dispersion. Although the structure in part exhibits a native-like α-helical core, attenuation of secondary chemical shifts and inter-residue nuclear Overhauser enhancements (NOEs) provide evidence for substantial disorder. Non-native long-range NOEs are not observed. Segmental unfolding of the A- and B-chains (dashed lines in central panel of Fig. 1B) demonstrates a breakdown in the cooperativity of protein folding (29Dobson C.M. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 2001; 68: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and suggests possible sites of aggregation in the subsequent pathway of fibrillation (8Brange J. Andersen L. Laursen E.D. Meyn G.

Recombinant insulin containing uniform 15N labeling was likewise prepared at Eli Lilly and Co. by expression of human proinsulin in minimal medium containing 15N-ammonium sulfate as the sole nitrogen source. To circumvent protein aggregation and fibrillation during NMR data acquisition (which ordinarily limits structural studies of monomeric amyloidogenic intermediates), favorable conditions for NMR study were determined as follows. Formation of fibrils (Fig. 2A) was detected by optical scattering at 360 nm. The time course of insulin fibrillation was investigated as a function of protein concentration, ionic strength, stirring or agitation, and presence of seeds; illustrative data are provided in Fig. 2. Consistency between samples under ostensibly identical conditions requires careful washing of the cuvette (by washing with (i) 6 m guanidine HCl at pH 10; (ii) perchoric acid; and (iii) deionized distilled water) and filtering of the protein solution to remove seeds. As expected for a nucleation-aggregation process, variability in the time of onset is nonetheless observed (Fig. 2B). Onset of fibrillation is delayed by reducing the concentration of protein (Fig. 2C) and sodium chloride (Fig. 2D) and by avoiding agitation. Favorable NMR conditions were thus found to be an insulin concentration of 200-800 μm in the absence of buffer; the pH was adjusted using an aliquot of dilute DCl. 1H NMR spectra were acquired without sample spinning. Line widths under these conditions are consistent with a predominance of monomers; chemical shifts and inter-residue NOEs characteristic of the dimer or trimer interfaces (30Chang X. Jorgensen A.M. Bardrum P. Led J.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9409-9422Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 31Jacoby E. Hua Q.X. Stern A.S. Frank B.H. Weiss M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 136-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) are not observed. EM photomicrographs of insulin precipitates were routinely obtained to verify the presence of fibrils; a representative image is shown in Fig. 2A. AspB10-DOI forms fibrils similar to those of intact insulin at pH 2 and 60 °C.Biophysical Methods—Samples were filtered (0.45 μm; Sartorius, Goetlingen, Germany) prior to CD and NMR studies to remove particulate matter and possible protein aggregates. CD spectra at 4 and 60 °C were acquired using an Aviv spectromolarimeter equipped with thermister temperature control. Deconvolution of CD spectra was obtained by the SELCON method (32Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2478) Google Scholar). 1H and 1H-15N NMR spectra were obtained at 600 and 800 MHz using Bruker spectrometers equipped with cryoprobes. Spectra were obtained within 5 h without sample spinning. Although one-dimensional (1D) 1H NMR spectra obtained immediately after such acquisitions were essentially unchanged, fresh samples were employed for each subsequent set of measurements. Mixing times for NOE spectroscopy (NOESY) were 75, 200, 400, and 600 ms; the mixing time for total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) was 55 ms. Use of long NOESY mixing times was suggested by a reviewer to compensate for the slower NOE build-up observed at high temperatures. Water suppression was achieved without presaturation by excitation sculpting as described (33Hua Q.X. Nakagawa S.H. Wilken J. Ramos R.R. Jia W. Bass J. Weiss M.A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 826-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Respective acqusition times in two-dimensional (2D) and 3D NMR experiments are given in the figure captions. Sequential resonance assignment was facilitated by analysis of 3D NMR spectra in which a third dimension was provided by heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC). Such 3D NMR experiments are designated 1H-15N NOESY-HSQC and TOCSY-HSQC (34Fesik S.W. Zuiderweg E.R. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1990; 23: 97-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and were obtained with respective mixing times of 200 and 55 ms by the method of Wüthrich (35Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). Control spectra of the native insulin monomer in 20% deuterioacetic acid (pH 1.9) at 25 °C were acquired and interpreted as described (22Hua Q.X. Weiss M.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5505-5515Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 36Hua Q.X. Weiss M.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10545-10555Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).

The present studies focus on how this structure becomes distorted at elevated temperature. Our results are presented in three parts. We first employ CD and CD deconvolution analysis to probe the partial thermal unfolding of insulin between low (native-like) and high (amloidogenic) temperatures. We next investigate in detail the structure of the amyloidogenic partial fold by heteronuclear 3D NMR spectroscopy. Finally, a key structural feature of this fold, the C-terminal segment of the B-chain, is interrogated by a novel application of CD difference spectroscopy: comparison of the intact protein with a truncated analog lacking this segment (Fig. 3B). Together our results highlight the breakdown of cooperativity in the partial unfolding of a globular protein.Fig. 3CD studies of partially folded intermediate and truncated insulin analogs.

The far ultraviolet CD spectrum of insulin at 4 °C and pH 2 (black circles in Fig. 3C) is similar to that observed at pH 7 (38Shoelson S.E. Lu Z.X. Parlautan L. Lynch C.S. Weiss M.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1757-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) consistent with a native-like structure under these conditions (28Whittingham J.L. Scott D.J. Chance K. Wilson A. Finch J. Brange J. Dodson G.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 479-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Spectral deconvolution (32Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2478) Google Scholar) yields the following secondary structural contents (Table I): α-helix (44%), random coil (30%), β-strand (9%), and turns (19%). A marked change is observed in the CD spectrum of insulin at 60 °C (red circles in Fig. 3C): helix-associated bands at 195, 208, and 222 nm are attenuated. Spectral deconvolution suggests an attenuated α-helix content (29%) and increased random coil (47%); inferred contents of β-strand and turns (9 and 14%, respectively) are similar to their values at low temperature. The decrease in estimated helix content and increased random coil suggests a transition involving 6-9 residues. The difference spectrum (Δ1 in Fig. 3C) reflects this putative helix-disorder transition.Table ICD deconvolution and predicted secondary structuresaTruncated analogs that lack the C-terminal eight residues of the B chain (residues B23-B30) and contains substitution HisB10 → Asp to destabilize this potential site of protein-protein interaction (66) while stabilizing the α-helical fold (67).SampleFractional compositionfαfβftfRC%Native insulin (4 °C)4491930Native insulin (60 °C)2991447Truncated analogaTruncated analogs that lack the C-t"

These functions are mediated by a large number of receptors. Except for the 5-HT3 receptor, which is a ligand-gated channel, all 5-HT receptors belong to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. Among the GPCRs activated by 5-HT, the 5-HT2 receptor family, namely the 5-HT2A, the 5-HT2B, and the 5-HT2C receptors, continues to raise particular interest. Indeed, they are involved in multiple physiological functions such as the control of endocrine secretion, motor behavior, mood, pain, sleep, thermoregulation, and appetite (1Roth B.L. Willins D.L. Kristiansen K. Kroeze W.K. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 79: 231-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Moreover, a large number of psychoactive drugs, including non-classical antipsychotic drugs, hallucinogens, anxiolytics, and anti-depressants, mediate their action at least in part through activation of 5-HT2 receptors (1Roth B.L. Willins D.L. Kristiansen K. Kroeze W.K. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 79: 231-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 2Meltzer H.Y. Matsubara S. Lee J.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Leysen J.E. Life Sci. 2003; 72: 2429-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Among the 5-HT2 receptor family, the 5-HT2A and the 5-HT2C receptor are widely distributed in the central nervous system, whereas the 5-HT2B receptor is sparse. The 5-HT2A and the 5-HT2C receptors share the highest degree of sequence homology (about 50% overall sequence identity). Thus, it is not surprising that these receptors have very similar pharmacological profiles and that only a few selective ligands are available. Initial studies of 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptor signaling showed that both receptors activate phosphatidyl inositol hydrolysis. However, some differences in signal transduction characteristics of these receptors have been reported (5Berg K.A. Clarke W.P. Sailstad C. Saltzman A. Maayani S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 477-484PubMed Google Scholar, 6Berg K.A. Maayani S. Goldfarb J. Scaramellini C. Leff P. Clarke W.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 94-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). In NIH3T3 cells expressing the 5-HT2C receptor, agonist-independent activity was much more elevated than that measured in cells expressing the same density of 5-HT2A receptors (7Grotewiel M.S. Sanders-Bush E. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1999; 359: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This indicates that the 5-HT2A receptor has lower intrinsic ability to adopt an active conformation than does the 5-HT2C receptor. Different mechanisms of desensitization for the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptor systems have also been described. In Chinese hamster ovary cells, agonist-induced desensitization of the 5-HT2A receptor-mediated phospholipase C activation is inhibited by inhibitors of protein kinase C and Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (8Berg K.A. Stout B.D. Maayani S. Clarke W.P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 299: 593-602PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the 5-HT2C receptor-mediated response is insensitive to these inhibitors. Moreover, the desensitization of the 5-HT2C receptor system but not that of the 5-HT2A receptor is dependent on G-protein receptor kinase activity (8Berg K.A. Stout B.D. Maayani S. Clarke W.P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 299: 593-602PubMed Google Scholar). A large set of recent studies demonstrate that many GPCR functions, such as G-protein-independent signaling, desensitization, internalization, and resensitization, implicate proteins that bind to their intracellular domains (9Brady A.E. Limbird L.E. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 297-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 10Kreienkamp H.J. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2002; 2: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 11Bockaert J. Marin P. Dumuis A. Fagni L. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). To date, many proteins identified as binding partners of GPCRs are PSD-95/Disc-large/Zonula occludens-1 (PDZ) domain proteins, which recognize a PDZ recognition motif (PDZ ligand) located at their extreme C-terminal extremity (11Bockaert J. Marin P. Dumuis A. Fagni L. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 12Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev.

Science's STKE. 2003; http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2003/179/re7PubMed Google Scholar). The 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors express a canonical Type 1 PDZ ligand ((S/T)Xϕ, where ϕ is a hydrophobic residue, SCV and SSV, respectively). The similitude of these PDZ ligands, which share residues crucially required for the interaction with a PDZ domain (i.e. valine at the 0 position and serine at the -2 position) but differ in the -1 position and in residues upstream the minimal PDZ ligand, raises the question of whether these receptors can recruit specific or common PDZ domain proteins. The multiple PDZ protein 1 (MUPP1) was the first protein identified as a binding partner of the C-terminal domain of the 5-HT2C receptor by a two-hybrid screen (14Ullmer C. Schmuck K. Figge A.

Further experiments indicated that this protein is capable of interacting with both the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors in vitro (15Becamel C. Figge A. Poliak S. Dumuis A. Peles E. Bockaert J. Lubbert H.

Using a proteomic approach associating glutathione S-transferase pull-down experiments and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, we have recently identified 15 proteins of a complex interacting with the entire C terminus of the 5-HT2C receptor (17Becamel C. Alonso G. Galeotti N. Demey E. Jouin P. Ullmer C. Dumuis A. Bockaert J. Marin P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2332-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). These proteins include scaffolding proteins that contain PDZ domains. A direct interaction of one of them, PSD-95, with the 5-HT2A receptor has also recently been reported (18Xia Z. Gray J.A. Compton-Toth B.A. Roth B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21901-21908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The present study was carried out to provide an exhaustive identification and comparison of the proteins that interact with the PDZ ligand of the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors by means of a proteomic approach based on affinity chromatography using synthetic peptides encompassing the C-terminal PDZ ligand of the receptors as baits. This study showed that both receptors interact with specific sets of PDZ proteins in vitro. Additional experiments were performed to 1) identify the molecular determinants located on the C terminus of the receptors involved in these specific interactions and 2) determine whether the specificity of these interactions takes place in vivo. Expression Plasmids and Antibodies—The constructs encoding Veli-3 (Veli-3/PRK7) and the c-Myc-tagged h5-HT2C receptor (5-HT2C/pRK5) have been previously described. The expression vector coding for CIPP fused to an N-terminal FLAG tag (FLAG-CIPPpCI) was a generous gift from Prof. Michel Lazdunski. QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) was used to engineer a XbaI restriction site upstream the ATG initiation codon of the pBluescript/h5-HT2A construct (provided by Dr. Christoph Ullmer). h5-HT2A was then subcloned into the XbaI site of the PRK5 plasmid. pRK5/h5-HT2A was hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged on the N-terminal domain by polymerase chain reaction amplification with the forward primer 5′-GCTTGATGCGGATCCATGTACCCATACGACGTCCCCGACTATGCTGATATTCTTTGTGAAAATACTTCTTTGA-3′ (the HA sequence is underlined) and the reverse primer 5′-CATGGATCCGCATCAAGCTTCTAGAGGATC-3′. The amplified products were cut BsaB1/AgeI and ligated into the pRK5/h5-HT2A, yielding pRK5/HA-h5-HT2A. The construct was verified by sequencing. The rabbit polyclonal anti-Veli-3 antibody was purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA), the mouse monoclonal anti-CASK, anti-Mint1, and anti-5-HT2A receptor antibodies were from Pharmingen, the mouse monoclonal anti-PSD-95 (clone K28/43) antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), the mouse monoclonal anti-synapse-associated protein (SAP) 97 was from Stress-Gen Biotechnologies Corp. (Victoria, Canada), the rabbit polyclonal anti-SAP102 antibody was from Oncogene Research Products (Cambridge, MA), the rabbit polyclonal anti-FLAG antibody was from Sigma (Saint Quentin Fallavier, France), and the monoclonal mouse anti-HA antibody (clone 12CA5) was from Roche Applied Science. The rabbit polyclonal anti-5-HT2C receptor antibody was provided by Dr. Abramowski and has been described elsewhere (19Abramowski D. Rigo M. Duc D. Hoyer D. Staufenbiel M. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 1635-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The mouse monoclonal anti-c-Myc antibody was a gift from Dr. Bernard Mouillac (INSERM U469 Montpellier, France). Peptide Affinity Chromatography—Synthetic peptides (>95% purity, Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium) encompassing the 14 C-terminal amino acids of the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors were coupled via their N-terminal extremity to activated CH-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis indicated the coupling efficacy was higher than 90% for each peptide. Immobilized peptides were stored at 4 °C in Tris-HCl (50 mm, pH 7.4) and dithiothreitol (DTT, 10 mm) to prevent cysteine oxidation at the -1 position in the 5-HT2A sequence. Brains of Swiss mice (obtained from Janvier, Le Genest-St. Isle, France) were thoroughly washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer, and centrifuged at 200 × g for 3 min. Pellets were resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer containing Tris-HCl (50 mm, pH 7.4), EDTA (1 mm), and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), homogenized 20 times on ice with a glass Teflon homogenizer, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The membrane pellets were resuspended in CHAPS extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.05 mm EDTA, 10 mm CHAPS, and protease inhibitors) for 3 h in rotation at 4 °C. Then samples were centrifuged for 1 h at 10,000 × g. Solubilized proteins (2 mg/condition) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 2 μg of immobilized peptide. Samples were washed twice with 1 ml of extraction buffer and then 4 times with PBS. Proteins were eluted with either 350 μl of isoelectrofocusing medium containing urea (7 m), thiourea (2 m), CHAPS (4%), ampholines (preblended, pI 3.5–9.5, 8 mg/ml, Amersham Biosciences), DTT (100 mm), tergitol NP7 (0.2%, Sigma), and traces of bromphenol blue for two-dimensional electrophoresis analysis or 50 μl of SDS sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 100 mm DTT, and bromphenol blue) for immunoblotting. Two-dimensional Electrophoresis and Two-dimensional Gel Protein Pattern Analysis—Proteins were first separated according to their isoelectric point along linear immobilized pH gradient strips (pH 3–10, 18 cm long, Amersham Biosciences). Sample loading for the first dimension was performed by passive in-gel re-swelling. After the first dimension the immobilized pH gradient strips were equilibrated for 10 min in a buffer containing urea (6 m), Tris-HCl (50 mm, pH 6.8), glycerol (30%), SDS (2%), DTT (10 mg/ml), and bromphenol blue and then for 15 min in the same buffer containing 15 mg/ml iodoacetamide instead of DTT. For the second dimension, the strips were loaded onto vertical 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gels were silver-stained according to the procedure of Shevchenko et al. (20Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar). Gels to be compared were always processed and stained in parallel. Gels were scanned using a computer-assisted densitometer. Spot detection, gel alignment, and spot quantification were performed using the Image Master 2-D Elite software (Amersham Biosciences). Quantification of proteins was expressed as volumes of spots. To correct for variability resulting from silver staining, results were expressed as relative volumes of total spots in each gel. MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry and Protein Identification—Proteins of interest were excised and digested in gel using trypsin (Gold, Promega, Charbonnières, France), and tryptic peptides were extracted from the gels as previously described (20Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar, 21Becamel C. Galeotti N. Poncet J. Jouin P. Dumuis A. Bockaert J. Marin P. Biol. Proced.

Digest products were completely dehydrated in a vacuum centrifuge and resuspended in 10 μl of formic acid (2%), desalted using Zip Tips C18 (Millipore, Bedford, MA), eluted with 10 μl of acetonitrile-trifluoroacetic acid (60–0.1%), and concentrated to a volume of 2 μl. Aliquots (0.5 μl) were loaded onto the target of an Ultraflex MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker-Franzen Analytik, Bremen, Germany) and mixed with the same volume of α-cyano-4-hydroxy-trans-cinnamic acid (Sigma, 10 mg/ml in acetonitrile-trifluoroacetic acid, 50–0.1%). Analysis was performed in reflectron mode with an accelerating voltage of 20 kV and a delayed extraction of 400 ns. Spectra were analyzed using the XTOF software (Bruker-Franzen Analytik), and auto-proteolysis products of trypsin (Mr, 842.51, 1045.56, and 2211.10) were used as internal calibrates. Identification of proteins was performed using both Mascot and PeptIdent software (available on line at www.matrixscience.com and www.expasy.org/tools/peptident.html, respectively), as previously described (21Becamel C. Galeotti N. Poncet J. Jouin P. Dumuis A. Bockaert J. Marin P. Biol. Proced. Online. 2002; 4: 94-104http://www.biologicalprocedures.com/bpo/arts/1/39/m39.htmCrossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting—Proteins, resolved on 12.5% gels, were transferred electrophoretically onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-C, Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were blocked in blocking buffer (Tris-HCl, 50 mm, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, Tween 20, 0.1 and 5% skimmed dried milk) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated overnight with primary antibodies (anti-Veli-3, 1:500; anti-CASK, 1:500; anti-Mint1, 1:250; anti-PSD-95, 1:5000; anti-SAP102, 1:350, anti-SAP97, 1:500; anti-5-HT2A receptor, 1:250) in blocking buffer. Blots were washed three times with blocking buffer and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody (1:2,000 in blocking buffer) for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoreactivity was detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence method (Renaissance Plus, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Co-immunoprecipitation—CHAPS-soluble proteins from brain extracts (500 μg per experiment) were incubated overnight at 4 °C either with the anti-5-HT2A receptor antibody, the anti-PSD-95 antibody, or the anti-Veli-3 antibody (1 μg each). Samples were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). After 5 washes with extraction buffer, immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted in SDS sample buffer, resolved on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels, and detected by immunoblotting. Immunocytochemistry and Confocal Microscopy—Subconfluent COS-7 cells, plated onto poly-l-ornithine (15 μg/ml, Mr = 40,000, Sigma)-coated glass coverslips (12-mm diameter) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum, were transfected with LipofectAMINE™ 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions using 0.5 μg of each cDNA per coverslip. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were washed in PBS and fixed in paraformaldehyde (4% (w/v) in PBS) for 15 min at room temperature. They were washed 3 times with glycine (0.1 m) and permeabilized with 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100 for 5 min. Cells were then washed 3 times with blocking buffer (gelatin 0.2% in PBS) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody (anti-Myc, 1:500; anti-HA, 1:400; anti-FLAG, 1:250; and anti-Veli-3, 1:500) in blocking buffer. Cells were washed 3 times with blocking buffer and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with either an Alexa green-labeled anti-mouse or a Cy3-labeled anti-rabbit antibody (1:1000 dilution in blocking buffer). After three washes, the cells were mounted on glass slides using gel mount (Biomeda Corp., Foster City, CA). Confocal laser-scanning microscopy was performed using a DMIRB Leica confocal inverted microscope. A series of optical sections were collected with a step of 0.30 μm. Images were collected sequentially to avoid cross-contamination between the fluorochromes and scanned at 1024 × 1024-pixel resolution. Immunohistochemistry and Electron Microscopy—Swiss mice were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg). Animals were perfused through the ascending aorta with PBS, pH 7.4, followed by 300 ml of fixative composed of 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Brains were then dissected out and fixed by immersion in the same fixative without glutaraldehyde for 12 h at 4 °C. The forebrain was then sliced frontally with a vibratome (VT 1000S, Leica) into 40–50-μm thick sections. After washing in PBS, sections were successively incubated 1) for 48 h at 4 °C with the primary antibodies against the 5-HT2A receptor, the 5-HT2C receptor, or PSD-95 (1:500 dilution each), 2) for 12 h at 4 °C with a peroxidase-labeled Fab fragment of goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (Biosys, Compiègne, France, 1:1000 dilution), and 3) with 0.1% 3,3′ diaminobenzidine diluted in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, in the presence of 0.2% H2O2. The primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 1% BSA, 1% normal goat serum, and 0.1% saponin. Immunostained sections were either mounted in Permount (Biomeda, Foster City, CA) and observed under a light microscope or further treated for electron microscopy. The sections were carefully rinsed in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.3, and postfixed in 1% OsO4 in the same buffer. The sections were then dehydrated in graded concentrations of ethanol and embedded in araldite. Punches of 1.5-mm diameter were cut through the hippocampus or the frontal cortex and mounted on araldite blocks. After slicing into ultrathin sections, they were observed in an electron microscope (Hitachi H 7110) without counterstaining. Recruitment of Distinct Sets of PDZ Proteins by the PDZ Ligands of the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C Receptors—Proteins interacting with the PDZ ligand of the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors were isolated by affinity chromatography using synthetic peptides encompassing the 14 C-terminal residues of the receptors as bait. Proteins from whole brain extracts were incubated with this bait because both receptors are widely distributed in the mammalian CNS. Two-dimensional gel analysis of proteins retained by the affinity chromatography showed a similar protein pattern recruited by both peptides, with some differences (Fig. 1). To specifically identify the proteins that were recruited through a PDZ-based mechanism, differential analyses of gels obtained with wild type peptides and peptides in which the C-terminal valine was mutated into alanine were conducted. This mutation is known to drastically reduce the binding to PDZ proteins (13Nourry C. Grant S.G. Borg J.P. Science's STKE. 2003; http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2003/179/re7PubMed Google Scholar). Seven spots (or groups of spots) that were apparent in the gels obtained with C-terminal peptide of the 5-HT2C receptor were undetectable in the gels obtained with the mutant peptide (indicated by arrows, Fig. 1B). These proteins were identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. They include activin receptor-interacting protein 1 (spot 1), a membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) with inverted domain structure (this protein is also called MAGI2), several proteins associated to the post-synaptic density, SAP97 (spot 2), SAP102 (spot 3), and PSD-95 (spots 4 and 5), MPP-3 (spot 6), a member of the P55 MAGUK subfamily, and Veli-3, one of the vertebrate homologues of LIN7 (spot 7) (22Fujita A.

These proteins possess one or several PDZ domains (Table I), validating our approach to identify PDZ domain partners of membrane-bound receptors. Only three of the binding partners of the 5-HT2C receptor PDZ ligand (PSD-95, MPP-3, and Veli-3) were identified in our previous proteomic study based on a glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay using the entire C terminus of the 5-HT2C receptor as bait. This indicates that the approach using short synthetic peptides is more sensitive than that using the entire C-terminal domain fused to glutathione S-transferase to detect PDZ-based interactions.Table IProteomic analysis of proteins interacting with the C terminus of the 5-HT2Aand the 5-HT2C receptor SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL accession numbers are listed. Proteins that were recruited by both receptor subtypes were identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry from both the gels obtained with the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptor C-terminal peptides. For these proteins, the results of MALDI-TOF analyses that yielded the larger sequence coverage are indicated.Position in gels in Fig. 1Protein nameAccession numberMALDI-TOF MSPDZ domains5-HT2A5-HT2CPeptidesCoverage%1ARIP-1 (activin receptor-interacting protein 1)Q9WVQ14163.86++++2SAP97 (synapse-associated protein 97)Q624021428.03++++3SAP102 (synapse-associated protein 102)P701751823.43-++4PSD-95 (post-synaptic density protein-95)Q621083444.63+++5PSD-95 (post-synaptic density protein-95)Q621083444.63+++6MPP-3 (MAGUK p55 subfamily member-3)O889102043.01+++7Veli-3 (vertebrate homolog of LIN 7)O88952849.71+/-++8CIPP (channel-interacting PDZ domain protein)O704711652.64+++/-9AOP-2 (antixoxidant protein 2)O087091148.40++- Open table in a new tab Surprisingly, trypsin digestion of the two major forms of PSD-95 (spots 4 and 5, Fig. 1B) detected on silver-stained two-dimensional gels, which showed large differences in isoelectric points (∼0.6) and molecular masses (∼ 15 kDa), generated identical peptide mass fingerprints (34 peptides representing 45% overall sequence coverage). Two alternatively spliced isoforms of PSD-95 have recently been identified in rodents and human, a short isoform containing a pair of N-terminal cysteines that can be palmitoylated and designated PSD-95α and a form containing a longer N terminus, designated PSD-95β (27Chetkovich D.M. Bunn R.C. Kuo S.H. Kawasaki Y. Kohwi M. Bredt D.S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6415-6425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal peptide of PSD-95α (MD-CLCIVTTKK, Mr = 1254.62) was identified in the tryptic digest of all isoforms of PSD-95 detected in the two-dimensional gels, indicating that they do not result from the N-terminal alternative splicing but differ in other regions that were not covered by the peptides identified in our mass spectrometry analyses. We failed to detect any palmitoylation of the cysteines located on the N-terminal peptide because the palmitoylated form of PSD-95 is insoluble in non-ionic detergents such as CHAPS, which was used in our experiments (28El-Husseini Ael D. Schnell E. Dakoji S. Sweeney N. Zhou Q. Prange O. Gauthier-Campbell C. Aguilera-Moreno A. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S.

They include activin receptor-interacting protein 1, SAP97, PSD-95, MPP-3, and CIPP (spot 8), a protein containing four PDZ domains that was recently identified as a binding partner of Kir4.0 potassium channel family members, N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor NR2 subunits, neurexins, neuroligins, and acid-sensing ionic channel 3 (29Kurschner C.

Differential analysis of the proteins recruited by the C-terminal peptides of the 5-HT2A and the 5-HT2C receptors showed a specific recruitment of an additional protein spot by the C terminus of the 5-HT2A receptor through a PDZ-independent mechanism (spot 9, Fig. 1A). Indeed, mutating the C-terminal valine into alanine did not inhibit the binding of this protein (data not shown). This protein was identified as antioxidant protein-2.

The C-terminal zinc finger (ZnF2) binds DNA, whereas the N-terminal finger (ZnF1) stabilizes this DNA binding and interacts with other zinc finger proteins, such as the Friends of GATA (FOG). We have investigated seven HDR probands and their families for GATA3 abnormalities and have identified two nonsense mutations (Glu-228 → Stop and Arg-367 → Stop); two intragenic deletions that result in frameshifts from codons 201 and 355 with premature terminations at codons 205 and 370, respectively; one acceptor splice site mutation that leads to a frameshift from codon 351 and a premature termination at codon 367; and two missense mutations (Cys-318 → Arg and Asn-320 → Lys). The functional effects of these mutations, together with a previously reported GATA3 ZnF1 mutation and seven other engineered ZnF1 mutations, were assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift, dissociation, yeast two-hybrid and glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays. Mutations involving GATA3 ZnF2 or adjacent basic amino acids resulted in a loss of DNA binding, but those of ZnF1 either lead to a loss of interaction with specific FOG2 ZnFs or altered DNA-binding affinity. These findings are consistent with the proposed three-dimensional model of ZnF1, which has separate DNA and protein binding surfaces. Thus, our results, which expand the spectrum of HDR-associated GATA3 mutations and report the first acceptor splice site mutation, help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that alter the function of this zinc finger transcription factor and its role in causing this developmental anomaly.

Furthermore, the importance of these interactions of GATA and FOG family members are underscored by their evolutionary conservation, because it has been shown that the Drosophila GATA factor, Pannier, interacts with a FOG-like protein referred to as U-shaped (8Haenlin M. Cubadda Y. Blondeau F. Heitzler P. Lutz Y. Simpson P. Ramain P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3096-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 9Fossett N. Zhang Q. Gajewski K. Choi C.Y. Kim Y. Schulz R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7348-7353Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The mammalian GATA factors can be subdivided into two families based on their structures and patterns of expression (10Weiss M.J. Orkin S.H. Exp.

Thus, the structurally related proteins GATA4, -5, and -6 are expressed in overlapping patterns in the heart, gut, urogenital system, and smooth muscle cell lineages, whereas GATA1, -2, and -3 are expressed in the hematopoietic cell lineages in which they control development of the erythroid, hematopoietic stem cell and T cell lineages, respectively (10Weiss M.J. Orkin S.H. Exp. Hematol. 1995; 23: 99-107PubMed Google Scholar, 11Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38949-38952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). In addition, GATA3 is also expressed in the developing parathyroids, inner ear, and kidneys (12George K.M. Leonard M.W. Roth M.E. Lieuw K.H. Kioussis D. Grosveld F. Engel J.D.

These expression patterns are consistent with the disease phenotypes that have been reported in the few patients with genetic abnormalities involving three of the GATA members. Thus, GATA1 mutations lead to dyserythropoietic anemia, thrombocytopenia (14Nichols K.E. Crispino J.D. Poncz M. White J.G. Orkin S.H. Maris J.M. Weiss M.J. Nat.

The precise manner in which GATA3 mutations cause these congenital abnormalities of the parathyroids, inner ear, and kidneys remains to be elucidated. To gain further insights into the structure-function relationships of GATA3, we have studied additional HDR patients for GATA3 abnormalities and have investigated the effects of GATA3 mutations on DNA binding and protein interactions. Patients—Ten patients with HDR from seven unrelated families were ascertained (Table I). Four families ((identified by anonymous code designations, in accordance with local ethical research committee guidelines) 19/1992, 8/2000, 2/2001, and 13/2001) were from Northern Europe, two families (19/2000 and 16/2001) were from North America, and one family (16/1998) was from Samoa. All 10 patients had hypoparathyroidism with serum calcium ranging from 1.01 to 2.00 mm, and this was associated with tetany or seizures in four patients, but was asymptomatic in six patients (Table I). Bilateral sensorineural deafness was found in all 10 patients with the age at diagnosis ranging from <1 to <30 years. Renal abnormalities were found in seven patients, of which two patients had developed end-stage renal failure, two had hypoplastic kidneys, and another two had agenesis of the right kidney.Table IClinical and biochemical findings in 10 HDR patientsFamily/patient (sex)HypoparathyroidismDeafness (sensorineural)Renal abnormalitieseRenal abnormalities: C, cysts; H, hypoplasia; A, agenesis; R, vesicoureteric reflux; S, sepsis; ERF, end stage renal failure.

The PCR products were cloned directly into pGEM-T (Promega, Madison, WI) and sequenced to determine orientation and absence of Taq-introduced secondary mutations. Each exon was excised from pGEM-T using appropriate restriction endonucleases and directionally subcloned in a four-way ligation reaction into pcDNA 3.1. COS-1 cells were transfected with the plasmid, as described above, and after 48 h the cells were harvested and RNA prepared (24Lloyd S.E. Pearce S.H. Fisher S.E. Steinmeyer K. Schwappach B.

FOG2 ZnFs were generated by RT-PCR using human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cell RNA as template. Each FOG2 ZnF (ZnF1 amino acids 236-290; ZnF5 amino acids 531-617; ZnF6 amino acids 661-747; and ZnF8 amino acids 1100-1151) was cloned in-frame into the Gal4 activation domain (AD)-encoding plasmid, pGADT7.

The transformants were selected on Leu-Trp- (double drop-out, DDO) minimal media plates by growth at 30 °C for 3 days. Transformants were then patched onto His-Ade-Leu-Trp- (quaternary drop-out, QDO) media plates and monitored for growth for up to 3 days. Expression of GATA3 and FOG2 Gal4 fusion proteins was confirmed by preparing protein extracts from each clone according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences Clontech) and analyzing them by SDS-PAGE in Tris-glycine-SDS buffer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and electro-transference onto PolyScreen polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) in CAPS buffer (10 mm, pH 11; Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO). Western blot analysis was performed with antibodies to either the Gal4-AD (FOG2-pGADT7 constructs) or the Gal4 DNA-BD (GATA3-pGBKT7 constructs), according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences Clontech) except that Gal4 DNA-BD antibody was used at 50 ng/ml and Gal4-AD antibody at 100 ng/ml (29Chien C.T.

Computer Modeling of GATA3 ZnF1 Structure—The three-dimensional structure of the murine GATA1 N-terminal zinc finger has been reported (37Kowalski K. Czolij R. King G.F. Crossley M. Mackay J.P. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and because the N-terminal zinc fingers of GATA1 and GATA3 are over 90% identical, we modeled the position of the GATA3 mutants on this framework. The GATA1 ZnF1 three-dimensional structure is archived in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) with the accession number 1GNF (available at oca.ebi.ac.uk/oca-bin/ccpeek?id=1GNF) and was visualized using the"
https://openalex.org/W2033187549,"Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are environmental compounds that disrupt the endocrine system, and exposure to low doses causes abnormalities, particularly in the developing central nervous system. Because they are structurally similar to thyroid hormone (TH), PCBs might affect systems involving this hormone. We previously found, using reporter assays, that hydroxylated-PCB at doses as low as 10–10m suppress TH-induced transcriptional activation of TH receptor (TR). To understand the molecular mechanisms of this process, we examined whether PCBs alter coactivator or corepressor interaction with TR. Polychlorinated biphenyls suppressed steroid receptor coactivator-1 enhanced TR-mediated transcription, but did not reduce TR/steroid receptor coactivator-1 interaction in mammalian two-hybrid and glutathione S-transferase pull-down studies. Thus, the suppression was probably not caused by coactivator dissociation. Nuclear receptor co-repressor was not recruited to TR by PCBs either in vivo or in vitro, indicating that TR corepressor binding did not induce the suppression. We then examined whether PCB influences TR binding to the thyroid hormone-response element (TRE). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that the TR/retinoid X receptor heterodimer complex was partially dissociated from TRE in the presence of PCB. These results indicate that partial dissociation of TR/retinoid X receptor heterodimer complex from the TRE is involved in the suppression of transcription induced by PCB.

These compounds contain 209 congeners, each of which is chlorinated to various degrees (1Tilson H.A. Kodavanti P.R. Neurotoxicology. 1997; 18: 727-743Google Scholar, 2Safe S.H. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1994; 24: 87-149Google Scholar, 3Tilson H.A. Jacobson J.L. Rogan W.J. Neurotoxicol. Teratol. 1990; 12: 239-248Google Scholar). These compounds are still detectable, even at the edge of the Arctic (5Dewailly E. Ryan J.J. Laliberte C. Bruneau S. Weber J.P. Gingras S. Carrier G. Environ. Health Perspect. 1994; 102: 205-209Google Scholar, 6Ayotte P. Dewailly E. Ryan J.J. Bruneau S. Lebel G. Chemosphere. 1997; 34: 1459-1468Google Scholar) and in the depths of the oceans (7Mormede S. Davies I.M. Chemosphere. 2003; 50: 563-574Google Scholar). After absorption, PCBs undergo little catalysis. They are highly lipophilic, accumulate in the liver and adipose tissue, and easily transfer to the embryo through the placenta and via breast milk (1Tilson H.A. Kodavanti P.R. Neurotoxicology. 1997; 18: 727-743Google Scholar, 2Safe S.H. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1994; 24: 87-149Google Scholar, 8Gladen B.C. Rogan W.J. J. Pediatr. 1991; 119: 58-63Google Scholar). Thus, PCB contamination is inheritable. At low doses, PCB might affect embryonic and neonatal development (9Jacobson J.L. Jacobson S.W. Toxicol. Ind. Health. 1996; 12: 435-445Google Scholar, 11Jacobson J.L. Jacobson S.W. Humphrey H.E. Neurotoxicol. Teratol. 1990; 12: 319-326Google Scholar, 12Jacobson S.W. Fein G.G. Jacobson J.L. Schwartz P.M.

Cognitive development among children exposed to PCBs in utero and during lactation is poor (10Jacobson J.L. Jacobson S.W. Neurotoxicology. 1997; 18: 415-424Google Scholar, 14Giesy J.P. Kannan K. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1998; 28: 511-569Google Scholar), and the results of studies using rodents have supported this finding (9Jacobson J.L. Jacobson S.W. Toxicol. Ind.

JAMA. 1992; 268: 3213-3218Google Scholar). Because perinatal hypothyroidism also induces abnormal brain development similar to that seen in PCB-affected animal models and in humans, PCB might disrupt the thyroid hormone (TH) system (15McKinney J.D. Environ. Health Perspect. 1989; 82: 323-336Google Scholar). Thyroid hormones (thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3)) play important roles in the growth and development of many organs in embryos and neonates (16Lazar M.A. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 184-193Google Scholar, 17Zhang J. Lazar M.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 439-466Google Scholar, 18Smith J.W. Evans A.T. Costall B. Smythe J.W. Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 2002; 26: 45-60Google Scholar). In particular, TH is crucial to the development of the brain in human fetuses and newborns, because maternal hypothyroidism during the perinatal period causes cretinism with severe cognitive and/or mental disorders in offspring (19Koibuchi N. Chin W.W. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 11: 123-128Google Scholar). We and others have generated experimental evidence that TH affects the brain only for a short period during its development (19Koibuchi N. Chin W.W. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 11: 123-128Google Scholar, 20Porterfield S.P. Hendrich C.E. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 94-106Google Scholar, 21Oppenheimer J.H. Schwartz H.L. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 462-475Google Scholar). Hypothyroidism during this critical period causes diminished axonal growth and dendritic arborization in the cerebral cortex, visual and auditory cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum (22Rabie A. Legrand J. Brain Res. 1973; 61: 267-278Google Scholar, 23Rabie A. Favre C. Clavel M.C. Legrand J. Brain Res. 1977; 120: 521-531Google Scholar). Thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) are ligand-regulated transcription factors that are expressed in many organs, including the developing brain (16Lazar M.A. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 184-193Google Scholar, 17Zhang J. Lazar M.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 439-466Google Scholar). In the absence of a ligand, TR binds to a specific nucleotide sequence, known as the thyroid hormone response element (TRE), located at the promoter region of its target gene by forming a complex with a corepressor, such as nuclear receptor corepressor (N-CoR) and its related protein, histone deacetylase, and induces the repression of transcription. Once a ligand binds to TR, the complex dissociates, and other complexes, including coactivators such as steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1), are recruited to induce transcriptional activation (16Lazar M.A. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 184-193Google Scholar, 17Zhang J. Lazar M.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 439-466Google Scholar, 24Yen P.M. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1097-1142Google Scholar). Several postulated mechanisms might account for PCB action on the TR system. Laboratory animals perinatally exposed to PCBs have abnormal thyroid function and neurological impairment. Many investigations have shown that exposure to PCBs results in thyroid enlargement and reduced serum T4 levels with normal T3, which is the active compound of TH (25Porterfield S.P. Hendry L.B. Toxicol. Ind. Health. 1998; 14: 103-120Google Scholar, 26Brouwer A. Morse D.C. Lans M.C. Schuur A.G. Murk A.J. Klasson-Wehler E. Bergman A. Visser T.J. Toxicol. Ind. Health. 1998; 14: 59-84Google Scholar, 27Hauser P. McMillin J.M. Bhatara V.S. Toxicol. Ind. Health. 1998; 14: 85-101Google Scholar). Thus, PCB seems to affect the TH system mainly by inhibiting TH secretion in the thyroid gland, which could cause abnormal brain development. However, the general growth of animals exposed to PCBs was not significantly altered, and the T3 levels in each organ remained within the normal range (28Shimada T. Sugie A. Shindo M. Nakajima T. Azuma E. Hashimoto M. Inoue K. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2003; 187: 1-10Google Scholar). On the other hand, several PCB congeners, particularly hydroxylated forms, can cross the blood-brain barrier and accumulate in the brain (15McKinney J.D. Environ. Health Perspect. 1989; 82: 323-336Google Scholar, 29Darnerud P.O. Morse D. Klasson-Wehler E. Brouwer A. Toxicology. 1996; 106: 105-114Google Scholar, 30Brouwer A. van den Berg K.J. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1986; 85: 301-312Google Scholar, 31Cheek A.O. Kow K. Chen J. McLachlan J.A. Environ. Health Perspect. 1999; 107: 273-278Google Scholar). Thus, abnormal brain development might be induced by the direct action of PCBs. Because the molecular structure of PCBs (especially hydroxylated PCB, an in vivo metabolite of PCB found in the blood) is similar to that of TH, PCB might act through TR (15McKinney J.D. Environ. Health Perspect. 1989; 82: 323-336Google Scholar). However, binding studies have shown that the affinity of TRβ1 for hydroxylated PCB is less than 1/10,000 that of T4 (15McKinney J.D. Environ. Health Perspect. 1989; 82: 323-336Google Scholar). We previously examined whether PCB directly acts on TR, and reported that 10–10m hydroxylated PCB (4(OH)-2′,3,3′,4′,5′-penta CB) suppressed TR-mediated transcription in the presence of T3. The suppression induced by PCB was cell-specific, because clonal TE671 cells, which are derived from cerebellar granule cells, were particularly susceptible. After transfection with SRC-1, PCB suppressed TR-mediated transcription in the presence of T3. We also found that the suppression of TR-mediated transcription by PCBs was probably not caused by competition between PCB and T3 for TR binding (32Iwasaki T. Miyazaki W. Takeshita A. Kuroda Y. Koibuchi N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 299: 384-388Google Scholar). The present study further examines the molecular mechanism of the suppressive action of PCB on TR-mediated transcription. We used the hydroxylated mono-ortho form of PCB because this type is produced from highly toxic parent PCBs, and it could be a key factor in abnormal brain development (33Kuroda Y. Environ. Sci. 2003; 10: 23-33Google Scholar, 34Sandau C.D. Ayotte P. Dewailly E. Duffe J. Norstrom R.J. Environ. Health Perspect. 2000; 108: 611-616Google Scholar, 35Sandau C.D. Ayotte P. Dewailly E. Duffe J.

Polychlorinated Biphenyls—Aroclor 1254 was purchased from Sigma. 4(OH)-2′,3,3′,4′,5′-penta CB, 4(OH)-2′,3,3′,4′,5,5′-hexa CB, and 2,3,3′,4,4′,5′-hexa CB were purchased from AccuStandard Chemicals (New Haven, CT). Their chemical structures are shown in Fig. 1A. Plasmids—Expression vectors of TRβ1, retinoid X receptor (RXR)β (36Takeshita A. Yen P.M. Ikeda M. Cardona G.R. Liu Y. Koibuchi N. Norwitz E.R.

The luciferase (LUC) reporter constructs, the chick lysozyme (F2)-thymidine kinase (TK)-LUC, artificial direct repeat TRE, DR4-TK-LUC, 2× palindrome (pal) TK-LUC (38Koibuchi N. Liu Y. Fukuda H. Takeshita A. Yen P.M. Chin W.W. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1356-1364Google Scholar), and 5× upstream activating sequence (UAS)-TK-LUC (36Takeshita A. Yen P.M. Ikeda M. Cardona G.R. Liu Y. Koibuchi N. Norwitz E.R. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21554-21562Google Scholar) in the PT109 vector were described elsewhere. A 2× glucocorticoid response element-LUC reporter in pTAL-LUC (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) has been described previously (37Iwasaki T. Chin W.W. Ko L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33375-33383Google Scholar). Expression vector of human SRC-1 has been described previously elsewhere (36Takeshita A. Yen P.M. Ikeda M. Cardona G.R. Liu Y. Koibuchi N. Norwitz E.R. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21554-21562Google Scholar). An expression vector of Gal4-DNA-binding domain (DBD)-fused SRC-1-nuclear receptor binding domain (NBD)-1 (aa 595–780) (also described nuclear receptor-interacting domain) was described previously (39Takeshita A. Taguchi M. Koibuchi N. Ozawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32453-32458Google Scholar). VP16-TRβ1-ligand binding domain (LBD) was constructed by inserting PCR-generated fragments inflame down-stream of the VP16 activation domain in AASV-VP16. The Gal4-blank and Gal4-N-CoR (aa 1552–2453) were a kind gift from Dr. T. Tagami (Kyoto National Hospital, Kyoto, Japan) (40Moriyama K. Tagami T. Akamizu T. Usui T. Saijo M. Kanamoto N. Hataya Y. Shimatsu A. Kuzuya H. Nakao K. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 87: 5185-5190Google Scholar). Gal4-TRβ1-LBD was described previously (36Takeshita A. Yen P.M. Ikeda M. Cardona G.R. Liu Y. Koibuchi N. Norwitz E.R. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21554-21562Google Scholar). GST-SRC-1-NBD-1 (aa 595–780) was described previously (36Takeshita A. Yen P.M. Ikeda M. Cardona G.R. Liu Y. Koibuchi N. Norwitz E.R. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21554-21562Google Scholar). GST-N-CoR (aa 2053–2414) was constructed by inserting PCR-generated fragments of N-CoR (a gift from Dr. M. G. Rosenfeld, University of California-San Diego, La Jolla, CA) into the GST plasmid (41Ron D. Dressler H. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 866-869Google Scholar). Cell Culture—CV-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% small lipophilic hormone-deprived fetal bovine serum at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Transient Transfection Assay—Cells were plated in 12- or 24-well plates 2 days before transfection. Each cell was transfected using the calcium-phosphate precipitation method (32Iwasaki T. Miyazaki W. Takeshita A. Kuroda Y. Koibuchi N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 299: 384-388Google Scholar) or LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) followed by manufacturer's instructions. Cytomegalovirus-β-galactosidase plasmid was used as an internal control. Sixteen to twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were refilled with fresh medium containing the indicated concentration of specific ligand and/or PCBs. After 24 h, cells were harvested to measure luciferase activities as described previously (32Iwasaki T. Miyazaki W. Takeshita A. Kuroda Y. Koibuchi N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 299: 384-388Google Scholar). Total amounts of DNA for each well were balanced by adding pcDNA3 plasmids (Invitrogen). The luciferase activities were normalized to β-galactosidase activity and then calculated as relative luciferase activity. All transfection studies were repeated at least twice in triplicate. Data shown represent mean ± S.E. of experiments performed in triplicate. The data were analyzed by ANOVA. Trypan Blue Exclusion—Trypan blue exclusion was described previously (42Jiang D. Sullivan P.G. Sensi S.L. Steward O. Weiss J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47524-47529Google Scholar). Briefly, CV-1 cells were plated in 100-mm diameter plates 2 days before adding PCB. Each cell was incubated in the presence or absence of 10–8-10–5m 4(OH)-2′,3,3′,4′,5′-penta CB. Twenty-four hours after changing medium, cells were incubated for 2–5 min in a solution of 0.2% trypan blue in phosphate-buffered saline. In each experiment, nonviable cells (colorless) and viable cells (stained blue) were counted. The data were analyzed by ANOVA. In Vitro-translated Proteins and GST Pull-down Assay—The GST fusion proteins were produced in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and purified by glutathione-Sepharose resin (Amersham Biosciences). In vitro binding assays were performed by incubating GST resin (20 μl, 2 μg) and [35S]methionine-labeled, in vitro-translated proteins (5 μl) that were produced by rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Similar amounts of loading fusion proteins bound to the beads were used, as determined by Coomassie Blue staining/SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. Proteins were incubated at 4 °C for 16 h in the binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 75 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol) in the presence or absence of T3 (10–6m) and/or 4(OH)-2′,3,3′,4′,5′-penta CB (10–8m). Bound proteins were washed three times with binding buffer in the presence or absence of T3 and subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Methods for EMSA were described previously (43Satoh T. Yamada M. Iwasaki T. Mori M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27919-27926Google Scholar). In brief, double-stranded oligonucleotides containing F2 (sense, 5′-agcttattgaccccagctgaggtcaagt-3′; antisense, 5′-cgtaacttgacctcagctggggtcaata-3′) or DR4 (sense, 5′-agcttcaggtcacaggaggtcaga-3′; antisense, agctctctgacctcctgtgacctga-3′) were labeled using Klenow fragment with [α-32P]dCTP. In vitro-transcribed and -translated TRβ1, RXRβ, and/or GST-fused SRC-1, N-CoR, and 1 × 104 cpm of labeled templates were incubated in binding buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 4 mm EDTA, 110 mm NaCl, 5 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, 1 μg/μl poly(dI-dC), 20% glycerol, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) and in the presence or absence of 10–6m T3 and/or 10–8m 4(OH)-2′,3,3′,4′,5′-penta CB for 30 min on ice. Different amounts of control reticulocyte lysate were added to some samples so that the total volume of the reticulocyte lysate was consistent. After incubation, samples were subjected to electrophoresis and analyzed with the use of autoradiography. The Suppression of TR-mediated Transcription Is Congener-dependent—We initially tested a series of PCB congeners including Aroclor 1254, a mixture of non-hydroxylated and hydroxylated PCBs, because the toxicity of congeners differs (2Safe S.H. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1994; 24: 87-149Google Scholar). All congeners used here suppressed TR-mediated transcription on the F2-TRE at various degrees of magnitude (Fig. 1A). These congeners also suppressed transcription when SRC-1 was co-transfected (Fig. 1B). However, the effect of PCB was not always dose-dependent, suggesting that competitive binding between PCB and T3 probably does not cause the suppression. Trypan blue exclusion confirmed that the suppression by PCBs (10–8-10–5m) did not result from cell death (data not shown). We obtained similar results of PCB action on DR4-TRE and 2× pal-TRE (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, the PCBs did not inhibit RXR-mediated transcription in the presence of 10–7m 9-cis-retinoic acid (Fig. 2A) or GR-mediated transcription in the presence of 10–7m dexamethasone with or without SRC-1 co-transfection (Fig. 2B and Ref. 32Iwasaki T. Miyazaki W. Takeshita A. Kuroda Y. Koibuchi N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 299: 384-388Google Scholar), suggesting that this suppression is likely to be TR-specific. Basal Transcription in CV-1 Cells Was Not Affected by PCB—We examined whether PCB affects basal transcription. In the absence of T3, we cotransfected F2-TRE-LUC containing the TK promoter with TRβ1 or vector alone. Transcription in the presence or absence of TR was not affected by PCB (Fig. 3A). Together with the results shown in Figs. 1 and 2, these findings suggest that PCB did not affect basal transcription under our experimental conditions. PCB Did Not Affect TR-mediated Transcription in the Absence of T3—Because PCB might bind to TR as a result of structural similarity, we further examined whether PCB suppresses TR-mediated transcription in the absence of T3. TR reduced transcription in the absence of T3. Transcription was not affected by 10–10-10–6m PCB in the absence of T3 (Fig. 3A). Cotransfection with N-CoR further repressed transcription in the absence of T3 (Fig. 3B). Adding PCB did not affect transcription, suggesting that PCB did not affect N-CoR-mediated suppression (Fig. 3B). SRC-1 Was Not Dissociated from TR by PCB—We investigated the effect of PCB on binding between TR and SRC-1. Using a mammalian two-hybrid assay in CV-1 cells, we tested interactions between SRC-1-NBD-1 and TRβ1-LBD in the presence of T3 and PCB. The NBD-1 of SRC-1 was fused to the Gal4-DNA binding domain, and the LBD of TRβ1 was fused to the transactivation domain of VP16 (Fig. 4A). Transactivation mediated by Gal4-SRC-1-NBD-1 and VP16-TRβ1-LBD proceeded in the presence of T3, but not in the absence of the VP16 construct and T3 (data not shown). Activated transcription induced by SRC-1-NBD-1 and VP16-TRβ1-LBD binding with T3 was not significantly reduced by 10–8m hydroxylated PCB (p < 0.01) (Fig. 4B). Neither VP16 alone nor PCB significantly increased transcription. These results suggest that PCB did not affect the binding of SRC-1 and TRβ1-LBD in the presence of T3. We further confirmed this observation using GST pull-down studies (Fig. 5). GST-fused SRC-1-NBD-1 did not dissociate from TRβ1 in the presence of 10–6m T3 and 10–8m PCB. These results suggest that the suppressive effect of PCB on TR-mediated transcription is not caused by changes in TR and SRC-1 interaction.Fig. 5PCB did not inhibit SRC-1 binding to TRβ1 in vitro. GST-fused protein of SRC-1-NBD-1 (aa 585–780) was incubated with in vitro translated, [35S]-methionine-labeled full-length TRβ1 with or without 10–6m T3 and/or 10–8m 4(OH)-2′,3,3′,4′,5′-penta CB. Bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. Negative control was GST alone.

We performed mammalian two-hybrid assays to examine whether PCB recruits N-CoR to TR. We co-transfected Gal4-fused N-CoR with VP16-TRβ1 and 5× UAS-TK-LUC into CV-1 cells. Transcription was not activated by increasing the concentration of PCBs (Fig. 6), suggesting that PCB did not recruit N-CoR to TRβ1 in the presence of T3 in vivo. We confirmed interaction between N-CoR and TRβ1 using GST-pull down studies. GST-fused N-CoR bound to TR in the absence of T3, whereas N-CoR dissociated from TR and PCB did not recruit N-CoR to TR in the presence of T3 (Fig. 7). These results indicated that PCB did not recruit the corepressor complex containing N-CoR to TR.Fig. 7PCB did not recruit N-CoR to TR in the presence of T3 in vitro. GST fusion protein of N-CoR (aa 1270–2453) was incubated with in vitro-translated, 35S-methionine-labeled full-length TRβ1 with or without 10–6m T3 and/or 10–8m 4(OH)-2′,3,3′,4′,5′-penta CB.

In contrast to co-transfection with TRE-LUC, increasing amounts of PCB tended to activate transcription in the presence of T3 (Fig. 8), suggesting that the effect of PCB on TRβ1 probably does not occur through LBD. Therefore, we postulated that PCB affects TR-mediated transcription by interfering with the binding of TR to TRE. Finally, we investigated the effect of PCB on the binding of TRβ1 to TRE using EMSAs. In the presence of 10–6m T3, TRβ1/RXRβ complex was partially dissociated (48.5 ± 1.7%, n = 3) from the inverted palindrome TRE, F2-TRE, by 10–8m PCB (Fig. 9A, lane 6), suggesting that TR-mediated suppression of transcription induced by PCB is at least partly caused by dissociation of TR/RXR complexes from the TRE. In the absence of T3, TR/RXR complexes were also partially dissociated (46.6 ± 4.2%, n = 3, Fig. 9A, lane 4). The results were similar using DR4-TRE (data not shown). In case of TRβ1 homodimer, about half of the TRβ1 homodimer was dissociated (47.8 ± 3.2%, n = 3) from the TRE by PCB in the absence of T3 (Fig. 9A, lane 8). In the presence of T3, TRβ1 homodimer was dissociated from TRE (Fig. 9A, lane 9), and the addition of PCB did not affect the binding (Fig. 9A, lane 10). We further examined the TRβ1-TRE dissociation when SRC-1 was added to TRβ1/RXRβ hetero- or TRβ1 homodimer complex using EMSA (Fig. 10, A and B). In the presence of RXR, SRC-1-NBD-1 bound to the TR/RXR complex (Fig. 10A, lane 6) in the presence of 10–6m T3. Addition of 10–7m PCB caused the partial dissociation of the TR/RXR/SRC-1 complex (50.5 ± 2.1%, n = 3) from the TRE (Fig. 10A, lane 7). TRβ1 homodimer bound to TRE in the absence of T3 (Fig. 10B, lane 2). In the presence of 10–6m T3, the TRβ1 homodimer dissociated from TRE (Fig. 10B, lane 5) as described previously. The addition of SRC-1 resulted in TR/TR/SRC-1 complex formation (Fig. 10B, lane 6). The addition of PCB caused partial dissociation of the TR/TR/SRC-1 complex to a lesser extent than in the TR/RXR/SRC-1 complex (20.6 ± 1.0%, n = 3, Fig. 10B, lane 7).Fig. 9Partial dissociation of TR from TRE by PCB. A, in vitro translated TRβ1 (1.5 μl) and/or RXRβ (3 μl) were incubated with 32P-labeled F2-TRE with or without 10–6m T3 and/or 10–8m 4(OH)-2′,3,3′,4′,5′-penta CB and then analyzed by EMSA.

Autoradiographic results show heterodimer (A) and homodimer (B). Three independent sets of the same experiment yielded similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We also examined TR-TRE binding with N-CoR (Fig. 11). In the absence of T3, N-CoR bound to the TR homodimer (Fig. 11, lane 3). Adding PCB did not affect the binding (Fig. 11, lane 4), which was compatible with the functional data. In the presence of T3, N-CoR did not bind to the TR homodimer (Fig. 11, lane 5). The addition of 10–7m PCB did not recruit the N-CoR (Fig. 11, lane 7), which is compatible with the results of the mammalian two-hybrid assay (Fig. 6). When the TR homodimer was replaced with the TR/RXR heterodimer, N-CoR did not bind to the heterodimer even without T3 (data not shown). Cohen et al. (44Cohen R.N. Brzostek S. Kim B. Chorev M. Wondisford F.E. Hollenberg A.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1049-1061Google Scholar) reported similar results with DR4-TRE. In addition, PCB did not recruit N-CoR to TR/RXR complex in the presence of T3. We showed that the suppression of TR-mediated transcription by PCB is probably induced through the partial dissociation of TR from TRE in the presence of T3. This result was compatible with the functional data showing that about 50% of transcription in CV-1 cells is suppressed by PCB. We also showed that the magnitude of suppression varies according to congeners. Polychlorinated biphenyl compounds might bind to TR because of structural similarity to TH. Thus, we previously examined the dose dependence of the effect of mono-ortho hydroxylated PCB (4(OH)-2′,3,3′,4′,5′-penta CB) on TR-mediated transcription. However, the magnitude of transcriptional suppression between 10–10m and 10–5m PCB was not statistically significant (32Iwasaki T. Miyazaki W. Takeshita A. Kuroda Y. Koibuchi N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 299: 384-388Google Scholar). The present study further confirmed, using several different PCB congeners, that PCB suppresses transcription. If the PCB effect is induced by the competitive inhibition of T3 binding TR, then PCB action should not be dose-independent. Furthermore, the affinity of several different PCB congeners is less than 1/10,000 that of T4 (15McKinney J.D. Environ. Health Perspect. 1989; 82: 323-336Google Scholar). Thus, the effect of PCBs on TR-mediated transcription is probably not caused by competition with TH for TR binding. The suppressive effect of PCB was not induced by cell death, because Trypan blue exclusion showed that PCB did not affect cell viability (data not shown). We initially postulated that the effect of PCB could be induced by dissociation of the coactivator complex from TR or by recruitment of a corepressor complex, because bisphenol A, which suppresses TR action, recruits corepressor complexes containing N-CoR (40Moriyama K. Tagami T. Akamizu T. Usui T. Saijo M. Kanamoto N. Hataya Y. Shimatsu A. Kuzuya H. Nakao K. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 87: 5185-5190Google Scholar). However, PCB did not dissociate SRC-1 from TR either in vivo or in vitro. PCB also did not recruit complexes containing N-CoR to TR. Thus, the mechanism of PCB action on TR-mediated transcription differs from that of bisphenol A. On the other hand, PCB did not affect transcription in the absence of T3 in either the presence or the absence of TR, suggesting that PCB does not affect basal transcription of the TK promoter in CV-1 cells. Involvement of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, to which some PCB congeners bind (45Schmidt J.V. Carver L.A. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22203-22209Google Scholar, 46Abnet C.C. Tanguay R.L. Heideman W. Peterson R.E. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1999; 159: 41-51Google Scholar), might also be excluded, because aryl hydrocarbon receptor is not expressed in CV-1 cells (47Chang C-Y. Puga A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 525-535Google Scholar). By using EMSA, we finally found that PCB partially dissociated TR from TRE in the presence of T3. The magnitude of dissociation was ∼50%, which is compatible with the findings of the transcriptional analysis. TR/RXR/SRC-1 complex was also partially dissociated (50%) from TRE by PCB. On the other hand, the effect of PCB on TR/TR/SRC-1 complex was much weaker (20.6%). The cause of such difference is obscure. Because PCB was not effective on RXR-mediated transcription, the site of PCB action is likely to be within TR. The conformational difference of TR in homo- and heterodimer complex may have altered PCB sensitivity. On the other hand, in EMSA, although PCB also partially dissociated TR homo- or heterodimer from TRE without T3, it did not dissociate TR/TR/N-CoR complex from TRE. This result is compatible with transcriptional analysis, because PCB did not alter TR-mediated transcription without T3, when corepressor may bind to TR. These results indicate that conformational change of TR in TR/corepressor complex may alter the PCB sensitivity. In mammalian one-hybrid study using Gal4-DBD-TR-LBD and full-length SRC-1, adding PCB slightly increased transcription (Fig. 8). Because the main cause for TR-mediated transcriptional suppression by PCB in the present study may be partial dissociation of TR-TRE binding, such increase in TR-SRC-1 binding might not alter the effect of PCB on TR-mediated transcription. However, this result indicates that PCB might act upon several regions of TR such as DBD and LBD. Studies in vivo have led to the notion that the site of PCB action on the thyroid hormone system is the thyroid gland. Maternal PCB crosses the placenta and is secreted into milk, which might cause the fetal or newborn thyroid gland to reduce thyroid hormone secretion. Consequently, TH-mediated brain development might be disrupted. However, although the plasma T4 concentration is decreased by perinatal PCB exposure, such animals generally grow normally, which is usually retarded by perinatal hypothyroidism. Furthermore, despite reduced plasma T4, the T3 concentration in peripheral organs is not altered by PCB exposure. Therefore, the peripheral organs might not become severely hypothyroid after PCB exposure. The present study showed that PCB acts directly on the TR to suppress transcription. Thus, we believe that the main site of action of PCB on the TH system is TR and not the thyroid gland. If so, why is the effect of PCB greater in the brain than in other organs? Additional studies are required to address this issue. Many tissue-specific factors might alter PCB action on TR-mediated transcription. A key quandary of PCB is that at low doses, which do not cause maternal problems, PCB compounds and their hydroxylated forms are transferred to the embryo through the placenta and are secreted into milk, and they might disrupt brain development or cause other abnormalities (10Jacobson J.L. Jacobson S.W. Neurotoxicology. 1997; 18: 415-424Google Scholar, 14Giesy J.P. Kannan K. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1998; 28: 511-569Google Scholar). Synaptogenesis mainly proceeds in the developing human brain during the perinatal to the infant period (22Rabie A. Legrand J. Brain Res. 1973; 61: 267-278Google Scholar, 23Rabie A. Favre C. Clavel M.C. Legrand J. Brain Res. 1977; 120: 521-531Google Scholar) when the blood-brain barrier is not yet well developed. Thus, toxic chemicals in the blood can easily enter the fetal brain during the critical period when functional neuronal connections are being established (33Kuroda Y. Environ. Sci. 2003; 10: 23-33Google Scholar). Recently, Kuroda and colleagues (33Kuroda Y. Environ. Sci. 2003; 10: 23-33Google Scholar, 48Kimura-Kuroda J. Nagata I. Negishi-Kato M. Kuroda Y. Develop. Brain Res. 2002; 137: 55-65Google Scholar) established primary cell cultures of the rat cerebellar cortex, in which neurons form vast numbers of synapses in the presence of TH. A similar low dose of hydroxylated PCB also inhibited the TH-dependent extension of dendrites of Purkinje neurons in this system (33Kuroda Y. Environ. Sci. 2003; 10: 23-33Google Scholar). Together with the present study, these two independent studies show a low-dose effect of PCBs on TR-associated biological events. In summary, our results suggest that PCBs suppress TR-mediated transcription directly through partial dissociation of TR from the TRE. The site of PCB action might not be thyroid gland, but rather TR, which is expressed in many organs, including the central nervous system. We hope that this study will significantly contribute to establishing appropriate restrictions on PCB intake to avoid the specter of complications arising in the future generations. We thank M. Ohta for technical support throughout the study and Dr. T. Tagami for preparing the constructs."

DNA damaging anti-neoplastic agents have been shown to induce p53, ceramide levels, and apoptosis; however, the effects of anti-neoplastic agents on SK have not been assessed. In this study, we investigated the effects of a DNA damaging agent, actinomycin D (Act D), on the function of sphingosine kinase (SK1). Act D caused a reduction in the protein levels of SK1, as indicated by Western blot analysis, with a concomitant decrease in SK activity. The down-regulation was post-transcriptional, because the mRNA levels of SK1 remained unchanged. Similar decreases in SK1 protein were observed with other DNA damaging agents such as doxorubicin, etoposide, and γ-irradiation. ZVAD, the pancaspase inhibitor, and Bcl-2 annulled the effect of Act D on SK1, demonstrating a role for cysteine proteases downstream of Bcl-2 in the down-regulation of SK1. Inhibition of caspases 3, 6, 7, and 9 only partially reversed Act D-induced SK1 loss. Inhibition of cathepsin B, a lysosomal protease, produced a significant reversal of SK1 decline by Act D, suggesting that a multitude of ZVAD-sensitive cysteine proteases downstream of Bcl-2 mediated the SK1 decrease. When p53 up-regulation after Act D treatment was inhibited, SK1 down-regulation was rescued, demonstrating p53 dependence of SK1 modulation. Treatment of cells with S1P, the product of SK1, partially inhibited Act D-induced cell death, raising the possibility that a decrease in SK1 may be in part necessary for cell death to occur. Furthermore, the knockdown of SK1 by small interfering RNA in MCF-7 cells resulted in a significant reduction in cell viability. These studies demonstrate that SK1 is down-regulated by genotoxic stress, and that basal SK1 function may be necessary for the maintenance of tumor cell growth.

Sphingolipids have received major attention over the past two decades as important mediators of signal transduction and cell regulation. Key lipids in the sphingolipid pathway are ceramide, sphingosine, and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). 1The abbreviations used are: S1P, sphingosine 1-phosphate; Act D, actinomycin D; SK1, sphingosine kinase 1; RT, reverse transcriptase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; TBS, Tris-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: S1P, sphingosine 1-phosphate; Act D, actinomycin D; SK1, sphingosine kinase 1; RT, reverse transcriptase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; TBS, Tris-buffered saline. Ceramide has been shown to mediate responses to a variety of stressors such as tumor necrosis factor, DNA damage, and FasL (1Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar). The ceramide-mediated responses are growth suppressing, through the processes of differentiation, senescence, cell cycle arrest, or apoptosis (2Hannun Y.A. Bell R.M. Clin. Chim.

Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 73-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Sphingosine is also a growth inhibiting messenger, although its role as a mitogenic lipid has also been proposed (7Merrill Jr., A.H. Schmelz E.M. Dillehay D.L. Spiegel S. Shayman J.A. Schroeder J.J. Riley R.T. Voss K.A. Wang E. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1997; 142: 208-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). S1P, on the other hand, has emerged as a growth promoting lipid (8Spiegel S. Milstien S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1733) Google Scholar). It has been shown to regulate cell proliferation, survival, migration, and angiogenesis. Furthermore, S1P can attenuate ceramide-induced apoptosis (9Cuvillier O. Pirianov G. Kleuser B. Vanek P.G. Coso O.A. Gutkind S. Spiegel S. Nature. 1996; 381: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). The differential roles of these bioactive lipids have made it essential to decipher the mechanisms that regulate their relative levels in cells. From this aspect, it is crucial to understand the regulation of the enzymes that mediate biosynthesis and breakdown of these three bioactive lipids.DNA damage is a major stressor that cells are exposed to in the development of cancer and in chemotherapy-based treatment (10Petak I. Houghton J.A. Pathol. Oncol. Res. 2001; 7: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Cell death following DNA damage has been shown to occur via the mitochondrial (intrinsic) pathway of apoptosis. When cells are committed to die by the intrinsic pathway, mitochondrial function is disrupted, resulting in the release of cytochrome c from the intermembrane space and leading to the activation of downstream effector caspases 3, 6, and 7. The latter execute the program of cell death by cleaving key proteins that maintain cellular integrity and function. The sequence of events from DNA damage to the disruption of the mitochondrion is poorly characterized, but p53 has been suggested to be involved. The classical response of the cell to genotoxic stress is to activate the tumor suppressor protein p53, which is often regarded as the guardian of the genome. The common absence of p53 in tumors allows them to circumvent the apoptotic responses that normal cells launch when they are exposed to DNA damaging stimuli.Ceramide, a key lipid in the sphingolipid pathway, can accumulate following exposure of cells to various DNA damaging chemotherapeutic agents (11Radin N.S. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 243-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Because of its apoptosis-inducing effects in cancer cells, ceramide has been termed the “tumor suppressor lipid” (12Hannun Y.A. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 400: 305-312Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Ceramide accumulation can occur via: (i) activation of de novo synthesis mediated by serine palmitoyltransferase and ceramide synthase; (ii) activation of sphingomyelin hydrolysis; (iii) inhibition of ceramide hydrolysis; and/or (iv) stimulation of glucosylceramide hydrolysis or inhibition of its synthesis (11Radin N.S. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 243-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Some agents activate a multitude of these pathways. The buildup of ceramide following DNA damage has recently been shown to occur in a p53-dependent manner (13Dbaibo G.S. Pushkareva M.Y. Rachid R.A. Alter N. Smyth M.J. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), because cells that did not up-regulate p53 following genotoxic stress also failed to accumulate ceramide; however, the mechanism of p53-mediated ceramide induction was not investigated in that study.Despite the immense literature examining the effects of anticancer agents on ceramide metabolizing enzymes, very few studies have examined the regulation of sphingosine kinase (SK) following challenge of cells by chemotherapeutic agents. SK is a key enzyme in sphingolipid metabolism, because it serves the dual function of modulating ceramide and S1P levels. Enhanced SK activity reduces ceramide by driving ceramide catabolism and enhances the synthesis of sphingoid base phosphates, which have also been shown to engage in negative feedback inhibition on serine palmitoyltransferase (14van Echten-Deckert G. Zschoche A. Bar T. Schmidt R.R. Raths A. Heinemann T. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15825-15833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), the rate-limiting enzyme of ceramide biosynthesis.Given the significance of sphingosine kinase in regulating ceramide and S1P levels, we evaluated the possible regulation of SK following chemotherapeutic agents. Actinomycin D (Act D) is a well known anticancer agent and topoisomerase II modulator utilized for the treatment of carcinomas, sarcomas, and leukemias, and previous work has implicated ceramide as a downstream effector of Act D (13Dbaibo G.S. Pushkareva M.Y. Rachid R.A. Alter N. Smyth M.J. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar).In this study, we demonstrate that DNA damaging agents regulate the down-regulation of the SK1 protein and SK activity in Molt-4 cells. This effect is dependent on ZVAD-sensitive proteases, and is accompanied by a significant increase in sphingosine and several ceramide species. Moreover, the down-regulation of SK1 occurs only in cells expressing functional p53, strongly suggesting that DNA damage-mediated SK1 decline is p53 dependent. Our results also show that endogenous SK1 function is necessary for tumor cell viability.MATERIALS AND METHODSChemicals and Reagents—Actinomycin D was purchased from Sigma. Caspase inhibitors Z-VAD-fmk, Z-DEVD-fmk, Z-VEID-fmk, and Z-LEHD-fmk were purchased from R&D Systems. The cathepsin B inhibitor CA-074-Me and the calpain inhibitor calpeptin were purchased from Calbiochem. S1P was obtained from the Lipidomics Core Facility at the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Medical University of South Carolina.Cell Culture—Human T-cell Molt-4 leukemia cells and MCF-7 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Molt-4 LXSN and Molt-4 E6 cells were generated by retroviral mediated gene delivery as described previously (15Foster S.A. Demers G.W. Etscheid B.G. Galloway D.A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5698-5705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These cells were maintained in the same media as above, supplemented with 250 μg/ml G418. Molt-4 vector-transfected and Bcl-2-transfected cells generated previously (16Zhang J. Alter N. Reed J.C. Borner C. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5325-5328Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 100 μg/ml hygromycin B1 (Calbiochem).Western Blot Analysis—Cells were collected by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 5 min. They were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 28.8 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)) for 30 min on ice. The lysate was homogenized with a 21-gauge needle and centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 30 min. Protein concentration was determined on the supernatant using the method of Bradford. Equal amounts of protein were resuspended in 4× Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and applied to a polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel. Following transfer to nitrocellulose, the membranes were blocked overnight in 5% nonfat milk in TBS + 0.1% Tween 20. The membranes were probed with primary antibodies for 1 h, washed three times with TBST for 5 min each, and probed with secondary antibodies for 1 h. The membranes were then rinsed three times, and the signal was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) or Supersignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Sphingosine Kinase Assay—The assay was performed as described in Ref. 17Olivera A. Barlow K.D. Spiegel S. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 311: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar with slight modifications. Briefly, the cells were collected by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 5 min. They were then resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm deoxypyridoxine, 15 mm NaF, β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, protease mixture inhibitor (Sigma)). The cell lysates were sonicated to achieve complete lysis, and protein concentration was determined. Equal amounts of protein were then incubated with 50 μm sphingosine (delivered in 4 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin) and 1 mm ATP (5-10 μCi, dissolved in 100 mm MgCl2). The reaction was carried out for 30 min at 37 °C. It was stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 1 n HCl and 800 μl of chloroform/methanol/HCl (100:200:1). After letting the samples sit at room temperature for 10 min, 240 μl of chloroform and 240 μl of 2 m potassium chloride were added, and the samples were centrifuged at 3000 × g for 5 min. The aqueous layer was aspirated, and 250 μl of the organic layer were transferred to new glass tubes. The samples were dried down in a SpeedVac and then resuspended in chloroform/methanol/HCl (100:200:1). Lipids were resolved on silica TLC plates (Whatman) using 1-butanol/methanol/acetic acid/water (80:20:10:20) as a solvent system. Labeled S1P was visualized by autoradiography.Reverse Transcription—RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Isolated RNA (1 μg) was added to 4 μl of 2.5 mm dNTP and 1 μl of 0.5 mg/ml oligo(dT) and brought to a volume of 12 μl with ddH2O. The mixture was incubated at 65 °C for 5 min. Then, 4 μl of 5× First Strand buffer, 2 μl of 0.1 m dithiothreitol, and 1 μl of RNase Out (Invitrogen) were added, and the contents were incubated at 42 °C for 2 min. Next, 1 μl of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) was added and the mixture was kept at 42 °C for 50 min. The enzyme was then inactivated at 70 °C for 15 min.Real Time RT-PCR—Primers were designed using the PerkinElmer Primer Express® software. These primers were chosen to be intone-spanning to preclude amplification of genomic DNA. Primer sequences were: SK1 (accession number NM_021972; forward, 5′-CTGGCAGCTTCCTTGAACCAT-3′, reverse, 5′-TGTGCAGAGACAGCAGGTTCA-3′), SK2 (accession number NM_020126; forward, 5′-CCAGTGTTGGAGAGCTGAAGGT-3′, reverse, 5′-GTCCATTCATCTGCTGGTCCTC-3′), ASmase (accession number NM_000543; forward, 5′-TGGCTCTATGAAGCGATGGC-3′, reverse, 5′-TTGAGAGAGATGAGGCGGAGAC-3′), NSmase-2 (accession number NM_018667; forward, 5′-CAACAAGTGTAACGACGATGCC-3′, reverse, 5′-CGATTCTTTGGTCCTGAGGTGT-3′), ACDase (accession number NM_004315; forward, 5′-GGTGGTGGATGAAAAATTGCCT-3′, reverse, 5′-CGGCAATACCCTTCATTTCCTC-3′), MCDase (accession number NM_019893; forward, 5′-ACAATTTATGGACCGCACGC-3′, reverse, 5′-TACCGTGTCCGTAGCAATAGCC-3′), SPPase-1 (accession number NM_030791; forward, 5′-TGAGTACAGCATGCCCTCCA-3′, reverse, 5′-GGCAAACTAGAGAACACCAGCA-3′), SPLyase (accession number NM_003901; forward, 5′-GAGCACCCATTTGATTTCCG-3′, reverse, 5′-CACCAATGATGAGCCTTTTGG-3′), LCB1 (accession number NM_006415; forward, 5′-TTAACTCAGGCGCGCTACTTG-3′, reverse, 5′-TGTTTGTTCCACCGTGACCA-3′), LCB2 (accession number NM_004863; forward, 5′-GCCACCCCAATTATTGAGTCC-3′, reverse, 5′-TGCAATAGGTCCCCAACTTCA-3′), S1P1 (accession number NM_001400; forward, 5′-GGAGCAATAACTTCCGCCTCTT-3′, reverse, 5′-TGCAGTTCCAGCCCATGATAG-3′), S1P2 (accession number NM_004230; forward, 5′-GCAAGTTCCACTCGGCAATGT-3′, reverse, 5′-AGCCAGAGAGCAAGGTATTGGC-3′), S1P3 (accession number NM_005226; forward, 5′-ATCCTGCCCCTCTACTCCAAGA-3′, reverse, 5′-GTGCGTAGAGGATCACGATGGT-3′), β-actin (accession number NM_001101; forward, 5′-ATTGGCAATGAGCGGTTCC-3′, reverse, 5′-GGTAGTTTCGTGGATGCCACA-3′).Real Time PCR—Real-time RT-PCR was performed on a PE Biosystems Gene Amp® 5700 Sequence Detection System (Foster City, CA). QuantiTect™ SYBER® Green PCR kit was purchased from Qiagen, whereas the AmpErase UNG enzyme was purchased from PE Applied Biosystems. The standard reaction volume was 10 μl and contained 4.2 μl of QuantiTect™ SYBER® Green PCR kit, 0.1 μl of AmpErase UNG enzyme, 0.7 μl of cDNA template, 0.8 μl of the forward primer, 0.8 μl of the reverse primer (both the forward and reverse primers at 3.125 μm concentration), and 3.4 μl of water. Initial steps of RT-PCR were 2 min at 50 °C for AmpErase UNG enzyme activation, followed by a 10-min hold at 95 °C for its deactivation. Cycles (n = 40) consisted of a 15-s melt at 95 °C, followed by a 1-min annealing/extension at 60 °C. The final step was a 60 °C incubation for 1 min. All reactions were performed in triplicate. The threshold for cycle of threshold (Ct) analysis of all samples was set at 0.15 relative fluorescence units.Data Analysis—The β-actin gene was used as an internal reference control to normalize relative levels of gene expression. Real time RTPCR results were analyzed using Q-Gene® software (18Muller P.Y. Janovjak H. Miserez A.R. Dobbie Z. BioTechniques. 2002; 32 (1376, 1378-1379): 1372-1374PubMed Google Scholar), which expresses data as mean normalized expression. Mean normalized expression is directly proportional to the amount of RNA of the target gene relative to the amount of RNA of the reference gene. Alternatively, the results are represented as Ct values for each gene. The higher the Ct value for a gene, the lower the level of expression of that gene, given that the expression level of the control housekeeping gene (β-actin in our studies) is unchanged. Relative gene expression levels between treated and untreated samples are obtained from the formula (1 + AE)ΔΔCt (19Mitas M. Mikhitarian K. Walters C. Baron P.L. Elliott B.M. Brothers T.E. Robison J.G. Metcalf J.S. Palesch Y.Y. Zhang Z. Gillanders W.E. Cole D.J. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 93: 162-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), where AE is the amplification efficiency of the gene under analysis (for the genes considered in this study, it is close to one), and ΔΔCt is the difference in ΔCt values between the treated and untreated samples. ΔCt is the difference between the Ct value of the gene under analysis and the Ct value of the control β-actin gene.Mass Spectrometric Analysis of Lipids—These were performed using electrospray ionization MS/MS analysis on a Thermo Finnigan TSQ 7000 triple quadruple mass spectrometer, operating in multiple reaction monitoring positive ionization mode as described previously (20Pettus B.J. Bielawski J. Porcelli A.M. Reames D.L. Johnson K.R. Morrow J. Chalfant C.E. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1411-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar).SiRNA Treatments—MCF-7 cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a concentration of 50,000 cells per well the day before the experiment. Scrambled siRNA 5′-AATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGTdTdT-3′ and 5′-ACGTGACACGTTCGGAGAAdTdT-3′, and SK1-specific siRNA 5′-GAGCUGCAAGGCCUUGCCCdTdT-3′ and 5′-GGGCAAGGCCUUGCAGCUCdTdT-3′ (Xeragon) were transfected into the cells using OligofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen).MTT Assay—Cells were grown for 2 h in 0.5% fetal bovine serum and then treated with different agents. After 24 h, MTT (Sigma) was added to the cells and they were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. Then, MTT solubilization solution (10% Triton X-100 in acidic isopropyl alcohol, 0.1 n HCl) was added to the cells overnight. For the siRNA experiments, cells were grown following the OligofectAMINE reagent protocol and MTT was added to the cells for 2 h prior to analysis. Colorimetric measurements were obtained in a microplate reader (Molecular Devices) at 562 nm and background was subtracted at 650 nm.RESULTSDNA Damage Down-regulates SK1—To determine the effect of DNA damage on the regulation of SK, we used Act D, a widely utilized anti-neoplastic agent that intercalates with DNA and interferes with topoisomerase II function. This agent is indicated in several pediatric tumors, and because leukemias are among the most common tumors in children, we chose Molt-4, a leukemia T-cell line, for our studies. Act D was used at 10 ng/ml, a concentration previously shown to be effective at inducing p53, ceramide accumulation, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage (13Dbaibo G.S. Pushkareva M.Y. Rachid R.A. Alter N. Smyth M.J. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Treatment of Molt-4 cells with Act D for 24 h produced a substantial decrease in SK1 protein levels as demonstrated by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1A). This effect was dose-dependent, such that a concentration as low as 5 ng/ml resulted in a significant drop in the levels of the protein, and 10 ng/ml led nearly to a complete loss of the SK1 protein (Fig. 1B). The decrease in SK1 starts to occur at 14 h, and is most prominent at 24 h (data not shown).Three other DNA damaging agents, etoposide, doxorubicin, and γ-irradiation produced a similar down-regulation of SK1 in Molt-4 cells (Fig. 1C). Etoposide also induced a decrease in SK1 protein in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1D). These results indicate that SK1 is down-regulated by multiple DNA damaging stimuli and in other cells.To demonstrate that the decrease in SK1 protein with Act D was accompanied by a decrease in SK activity, the effects of the DNA damaging agent on enzyme activity were determined. Indeed, SK activity, as measured by the incorporation of 32P from [32P]ATP into the sphingosine substrate, was markedly reduced in Molt-4 cells following Act D treatment as shown in Fig. 1E. This confirmed that the down-regulation of SK1 is mirrored by a significant decrease in activity; however, the decrease seen by Western blots was greater than 75%, whereas the decrease in activity was somewhat less pronounced. This could be in part because of sphingosine kinase activity from SK2.Because Act D is a well known transcriptional inhibitor that blocks elongation by RNA polymerase (21Sobell H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5328-5331Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 22Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar, 23Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar), we evaluated if the Act D-induced decrease in SK1 is because of a general inhibition of gene expression. Thus, cells were treated with Act D, and the mRNA expression of several sphingolipid metabolizing enzymes was analyzed by real time RT-PCR. Table I shows that the different enzymes have variable sensitivities to inhibition by Act D. Sphingosine kinases 1 and 2, sphingosine phosphate phosphatase-1, mitochondrial ceramidase, acid ceramidase, and the sphingomyelinases all showed no transcriptional inhibitory effects at 10 ng/ml Act D. Alkaline ceramidase, sphingosine 1-phosphate lyase, and LCB1, a subunit of serine palmitoyltransferase, showed very subtle decreases (less than one Ct value that corresponds to changes less than 2-fold) in the mRNA levels. Only LCB2, the second subunit of serine palmitoyltransferase, showed a remarkable decrease in mRNA, as illustrated by the greater than two Ct, i.e. 4-fold difference, between the vehicle-treated and the 10 ng/ml Act D-treated samples. At a concentration of 100 ng/ml Act D, however, inhibition of transcription became a significant consideration for all the enzymes tested. In all subsequent studies, 10 ng/ml Act D was used, because this concentration had no effect on SK1 and SK2 gene expression.Table IReal time PCR on Molt-4 cells treated with 10 or 100 ng/ml Act D for 24 hVehicle10 ng/ml Act DVehicle100 ng/ml Act DSK123.54 ± 0.2123.83 ± 0.2223.42 ± 0.1125.54 ± 0.14aRepresents statistically significant increases in the Ct value, decreases in the mRNA, between untreated and treated samples for a particular gene.SK221.68 ± 0.2822.08 ± 0.0521.05 ± 0.1024.07 ± 0.08aRepresents statistically significant increases in the Ct value, decreases in the mRNA, between untreated and treated samples for a particular gene.AlkCDase28.94 ± 0.3129.89 ± 0.18aRepresents statistically significant increases in the Ct value, decreases in the mRNA, between untreated and treated samples for a particular gene.28.42 ± 0.1133.63 ± 0.23aRepresents statistically significant increases in the Ct value, decreases in the mRNA, between untreated and treated samples for a particular gene.ACDase23.00 ± 0.2823.17 ± 0.0922.20 ± 0.1326.50 ± 0.11aRepresents statistically significant increases in the Ct value, decreases in the mRNA, between untreated and treated samples for a particular gene.MCDase24.53 ± 0.3024.23 ± 0.0923.97 ± 0.0826.58 ± 0.18aRepresents statistically significant increases in the Ct value, decreases in the mRNA, between untreated and treated samples for a particular gene.nSmase-224.33 ± 0.2924.00 ± 0.1223.83 ± 0.0730.78 ± 0.13aRepresents statistically significant increases in the Ct value, decreases in the mRNA, between untreated and treated samples for a particular gene.ASMase26.50 ± 0.0626.65 ± 0.1526.66 ± 0.1626.00 ± 0.17aRepresents statistically significant increases in the Ct value, decreases in the mRNA, between untreated and treated samples for a particular gene.LCB120.03 ± 0.1620.74 ± 0.17aRepresents statistically significant increases in the Ct value, decreases in the mRNA, between untreated and treated samples for a particular gene.20.62 ± 0.0726.40 ± 0.13aRepresents statistically significant increases in the Ct value, decreases in the mRNA, between untreated and treated samples for a particular gene.LCB218.92 ± 0.1521.22 ± 0.12aRepresents statistically significant increases in the Ct value, decreases in the mRNA, between untreated and treated samples for a particular gene.19.63 ± 0.1627.54 ± 0.11aRepresents statistically significant increases in the Ct value, decreases in the mRNA, between untreated and treated samples for a particular gene.SPLyase20.47 ± 0.1421.08 ± 0.21aRepresents statistically significant increases in the Ct value, decreases in the mRNA, between untreated and treated samples for a particular gene.21.13 ± 0.1029.11 ± 0.08aRepresents statistically significant increases in the Ct value, decreases in the mRNA, between untreated and treated samples for a particular gene.SPPase-123.82 ± 0.7623.37 ± 0.4521.64 ± 0.1328.41 ± 0.15aRepresents statistically significant increases in the Ct value, decreases in the mRNA, between untreated and treated samples for a particular gene.S1P123.20 ± 0.2623.90 ± 0.2624.15 ± 0.3226.49 ± 0.31aRepresents statistically significant increases in the Ct value, decreases in the mRNA, between untreated and treated samples for a particular gene.S1P226.77 ± 0.3425.16 ± 0.19bRepresents statistically significant decreases in the Ct value, increases in the mRNA, between untreated and treated samples for a particular gene.

https://openalex.org/W2062814362,"The fraction of ionized hydrogen left over from the Big Bang provides evidence for the time of formation of the first stars and quasar black holes in the early Universe; such objects provide the high-energy photons necessary to ionize hydrogen. Spectra of the two most distant known quasars show nearly complete absorption of photons with wavelengths shorter than the Lyman alpha transition of neutral hydrogen, indicating that hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM) had not been completely ionized at a redshift of z approximately 6.3, about one billion years after the Big Bang. Here we show that the IGM surrounding these quasars had a neutral hydrogen fraction of tens of per cent before the quasar activity started, much higher than the previous lower limits of approximately 0.1 per cent. Our results, when combined with the recent inference of a large cumulative optical depth to electron scattering after cosmological recombination therefore suggest the presence of a second peak in the mean ionization history of the Universe."
https://openalex.org/W2039114116,"The diverse function of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is thought to be due, in large part, to post-translational modifications. Here we show by high resolution two-dimensional PAGE analysis that there are three distinct PCNA isoforms that differ in their acetylation status. The moderately acetylated main (M) form was found in all of the subcellular compartments of cycling cells, whereas the highly acetylated acidic form was primarily found in the nucleoplasm, nuclear matrix, and chromatin. Interestingly, the deacetylated basic form was most pronounced in the nucleoplasm of cycling cells. The cells in G0 and the cytoplasm of cycling cells contained primarily the M form only. Because p300 and histone deacetylase (HDAC1) were co-immunoprecipitated with PCNA, they are likely responsible for the acetylation and deacetylation of PCNA, respectively. We also found that deacetylation reduced the ability of PCNA to bind to DNA polymerases β and δ.

Furthermore, we have shown recently by high resolution two-dimensional PAGE and immunoblot analyses that both hamster and human cells contain three different PCNA isoforms, the acidic (A), the main (M), and the basic (B) forms (8Naryzhny S.N. Lee H. Proteomics. 2003; 3: 930-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The different PCNA isoforms could be the result of post-translational modifications, especially phosphorylation status (9Kelman Z.

Cell Res. 1994; 215: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) presented data that support the phosphorylation of PCNA. In contrast, however, Bravo and Celis (14Bravo R. Celis J. FEBS Lett. 1985; 182: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) did not find any evidence of PCNA phosphorylation. We wanted to address this issue by carrying out several different experimental approaches, including in vivo labeling, immunoprecipitation, and immunoblot analysis in combination with high resolution two-dimensional PAGE. Here we show that mammalian PCNA is regulated not by phosphorylation but by acetylation. We have also shown that three distinct PCNA isoforms differ in their acetylation status. Our data further show that acetylation is associated with subcellular localization of PCNA. Moreover, deacetylated PCNA by HDAC1 has lower affinity to DNA polymerases β and δ than that of PCNA treated with trichostatin A (TSA, an HDAC inhibitor). Most important, the PCNA-DNA polymerase complex treated with HDAC1 showed lower polymerization activity than a TSA-treated control. Taken together, our data are consistent with the idea that acetylated PCNA is involved in the DNA replication process, whereas deacetylation of PCNA is associated with the termination of DNA replication.

Cell-cycle Synchronization—The arrests of cell cycle in G0 and at the G1/S boundary were achieved by isoleucine deprivation and by the combination of isoleucine starvation and mimosine treatment, respectively (15Naryzhny S.N.

In Vivo Labeling—For phosphoprotein labeling, CHO cells at 60–70% confluence were maintained for 4 h in phosphate-omitted MEM (Invitrogen, catalog number 21097-035) containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Subsequently, the cells were further incubated in fresh MEM containing [32P]orthophosphate (0.4 mCi/ml) for 9 h at 37 °C. Cells were then rinsed twice with cold PBS, collected using a plastic cell lifter in PBS containing protease inhibitor mixture and phosphatase inhibitors (20 mm NaF and 1 mm Na3VO4), and then harvested by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min. For acetylation experiments, cells were incubated for 6 h in MEM containing [3H]sodium acetate (0.5 mCi/ml).

The cells were then scraped using a plastic cell lifter, and nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was collected as cytosol fraction. All procedures were carried out on ice to minimize protein degradation. All buffers also contained phosphatase inhibitors (20 mm NaF and 1 mm Na3VO4).

Briefly, samples (up to 2 mg of protein) were typically solubilized in lysis buffer (LB) (9 m urea, 4% CHAPS, 1% DTT, 2% IPG buffer, pH 3–10, protease inhibitors mixture, 0.1 mm MG132 proteosome inhibitor, 0.001% bromphenol blue). Protein separation by isoelectrofocusing (IEF) gel electrophoresis was carried out using a DryStrip kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the following protocol suggested by the manufacturer's suggestions. Samples in LB were mixed with rehydration solution (8 m urea, 2% CHAPS, 0.3% DTT, 2% IPG buffer, pH range same as in the strip, 0.001% bromphenol blue) in a total volume of 200 μl (7-cm strip), 300 μl (13-cm strip), or 450 μl (18-cm strip). To prepare strips for separation in first direction, IPG gel strips were rehydrated overnight at 10 °C by placing them “upside down” in rehydration solution in the Immobiline DryStrip Reswelling Tray (Amersham Biosciences). 7-cm (pH 4.0–7.0), 13-cm (pH 4.0–7.0), 13-cm (pH 3.0–10.0), or 18-cm (pH 4.0–5.0) strips were used. IEF was conducted at 20 °C using a Multiphor II unit with the DryStrip kit. The total voltage hours were 18,000 and 38,000 for 13- or 18-cm IPG gel strips, respectively. Protein Staining and Gel Drying—Proteins in the gel were “silverstained” as described previously (19Blum H. Beier H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3736) Google Scholar, 20Rabilloud T. Electrophoresis. 1992; 13: 429-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, a polyacrylamide gel was fixed for 15 min in 25% isopropyl alcohol and 10% acetic acid solution, which was repeated at least once more. The gel was rinsed in water for 10 min and then treated with sodium thiosulfate (0.2 g/liter) for 1 min. After rinsing twice in water (20 s for each time), the gel was incubated in silver nitrate (2.0 g/liter) for 30 min. After washing once with water (20 s) and once for 30 s with Developing Solution (sodium carbonate, 30 g/liter, formaldehyde, 1.4 ml of 37% solution/liter, and sodium thiosulfate, 10 mg/liter), protein bands/spots were visualized by further treating the gel with Developing Solution. The reaction was stopped with 10% acetic acid solution. Finally, the gel was dried in the heat oven after it was placed between two sheets of cellophane (Bio-Rad) fastened in two frames as described previously (15Naryzhny S.N. Lee H. Electrophoresis. 2001; 22: 1764-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Other Procedures—Immunoprecipitation was carried out according to a protocol supplied by Santa Cruz Biotechnology with some modifications. Briefly, cells on the plate were washed with PBS, scraped with a plastic cell lifter in PBS, and pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 1,000 × g. After adding 1–3 ml of ice-cold RIPA buffer (for ∼7 × 107 cells), cells were disrupted by repeated aspiration using a pipette. The cells in RIPA buffer were then incubated on ice for 15 min. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C. To preclear, the cell lysate was mixed with 1.0 μg of control IgG (i.e. corresponding to the host species primary antibody) and then 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose, followed by centrifugation for 5 min at 3,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant (which contains ∼1.0 mg of proteins) was incubated with 1.0–10 μl (0.2–2.0 μg) of primary antibody for 1–2 h at 4 °C, after which 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose was added. After incubation for ≥2 h at 4 °C on a rocker platform, immunoprecipitate was collected by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellet was washed 2–4 times with 1.0 ml of PBS or RIPA buffer (for more stringent wash) under the same centrifugation conditions. All the buffers contained protease inhibitor cocktail and phosphatase inhibitors as described above. Immunoblot analysis was as described previously (8Naryzhny S.N. Lee H. Proteomics. 2003; 3: 930-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 21Mansfield M. Macdonald C.G. Millipore Technical Note TN051. Millipore, Billerica, MA1999Google Scholar). The treatments of HDAC1 and TSA were as recommended by the supplier (Calbiochem). An assay for DNA polymerization activity was carried out according to Podust et al. (22Podust L.M. Podust V.N. Sogo J.M. Hubscher U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3072-3081Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, PCNA (complexes) immunoprecipitated by PC10 was eluted by 0.1 m glycine, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 2.7, after which the pH was adjusted to pH 7.0 using 1.0 m Tris (final concentration, 25 mm). In vitro DNA polymerization assay was carried out in 25 μl of sample containing PCNA immunoprecipitate (50 ng of protein), 0.025 units of the poly(dA) template-oligo(dT) primer mixture, 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm DTT, 6 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm ATP, 0.75 μCi of [32P]TTP (3,000Ci/mmol) at 37 °C. Reaction was terminated, and DNA was precipitated by 1.0 ml of cold 5% trichloroacetic acid containing 1% sodium pyrophosphate. The precipitate was collected on membrane filter Protran 0.45 μm (Schleicher & Schuell) and counted in a Beckman 6000IC scintillation counter. PCNA Is Not Phosphorylated in Vivo—Proteins extracted from asynchronous Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were separated by two-dimensional PAGE, transferred onto a PVDF membrane, and then immunostained using a mixture of anti-phosphoserine, -phosphothreonine, and -phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig. 1A). The same membrane, without stripping off probes, was then immunostained with PC10 anti-PCNA monoclonal antibody (Fig. 1B). PCNA identified by PC10 (arrow in Fig. 1B) was not detected by anti-phosphoprotein antibodies (arrow in A), suggesting that hamster PCNA is not phosphorylated. To further determine the phosphorylation of PCNA, proteins extracted from the cells that had been metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate were analyzed by two-dimensional PAGE (Fig. 2). Comparing the profile of the silver-stained protein in Fig. 1 and our previous data (8Naryzhny S.N. Lee H. Proteomics. 2003; 3: 930-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 15Naryzhny S.N. Lee H. Electrophoresis. 2001; 22: 1764-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the position of PCNA could accurately be identified (arrow in Fig. 2A1). The same membrane was directly exposed to an x-ray film (Fig. 2B). Consistent with the data in Fig. 1, no phosphorylated PCNA could be detected (arrow in Fig. 2B1).Fig. 2Analysis of in vivo labeled proteins suggests that PCNA is not phosphorylated. Proteins extracted from the cells that had been metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate were separated by two-dimensional PAGE (first dimension, pH 3.0–10.0, 13-cm gel strip; second dimension, 11% SDS-PAGE, 14-cm gel strip). The gel was silver-stained and dried (A) and subsequently exposed to an x-ray film (B). A1 and B1, the areas containing PCNA were enlarged. Arrows denote the PCNA positions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further confirm our findings, PCNA (complexes) was immunoprecipitated with PC10 anti-PCNA monoclonal antibody. The immunoprecipitated proteins were then separated by two-dimensional PAGE, followed by silver staining (Fig. 3A1). The same gel was also exposed to an x-ray film (Fig. 3A). It was apparent that the main form of PCNA (arrow in Fig. 3A1) was not phosphorylated (arrow in A). However, there was a phosphoprotein near the PCNA (open arrows in A and A1). Although the relative amount was very small (open arrow in A1), this protein was highly phosphorylated (open arrow in A). To further characterize this phosphoprotein, we separated the PC10 immunoprecipitate by high resolution two-dimensional PAGE (first dimension, pH 4.0–5.0, 18-cm IPG strip; second dimension, 11% SDS-PAGE, 14-cm gel). Proteins of the gel were transferred onto a PVDF membrane, which was directly exposed to an x-ray film (Fig. 3B). The same membrane was then subjected to immunostaining with PC10 (Fig. 3B1), by which all three PCNA isoforms were detected. Again, phosphorylated PCNA was not detected (arrow in Fig. 3B). As observed with low resolution two-dimensional PAGE (open arrow in Fig. 3A), the presence of a 33-kDa phosphoprotein was apparent (open arrow in B). This phosphoprotein (33 kDa, pI 4.47), which was not stained by PC10, was slightly smaller and more acidic than the PCNA A form (34 kDa, pI 4.52) or the M form (34 kDa, pI 4.57). This phosphoprotein was pulled down by PC10 and could easily be mistaken for phosphorylated PCNA following a low resolution gel electrophoresis. Taken together, we have now established that hamster PCNA is not phosphorylated in a cell. Our data are consistent with the report by Bravo and Celis (14Bravo R. Celis J. FEBS Lett. 1985; 182: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) but in disagreement with that of Prosperi et al. (13Prosperi E. Scovassi A.I. Stivala L.A. Bianchi L. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 215: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). PCNA Is Acetylated in Vivo—Because acetylation often plays important roles in the regulation of various cellular functions (23Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 24Eberharter A. Becker P.B. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 224-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 25Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (7580) Google Scholar, 26Milutinovic S. Zhuang Q. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20974-20978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), we examined PCNA acetylation. Proteins isolated from the cells that had been metabolically labeled with [3H]sodium acetate were separated by two-dimensional PAGE and transferred onto a PVDF membrane, which was then either directly exposed to an x-ray film for 4 months (Fig. 4A) or subsequently immunostained with PC10 (Fig. 4A1). Because the same membrane was used to generate Fig. 4, A and A1, we were able to identify PCNA among the 3H-labeled proteins (arrow in A). To further confirm this result, immunoprecipitated proteins by PC10 were analyzed by two-dimensional PAGE/immunoblotting by using either anti-acetyl peptide antibody (Fig. 4B) or PC10 (Fig. 4B1). Consistent with the data from the in vivo labeling experiment (Fig. 4, A and A1), this result clearly shows that PCNA is acetylated. Thus, we have now established that hamster PCNA is acetylated in the cell. The Three PCNA Isoforms Differ in Their Acetylation Status—To determine whether the three PCNA isoforms are because of differences in acetylation status, proteins were incubated with either HDAC1 or acetyl-CoA plus TSA before analyzing by two-dimensional PAGE/immunoblotting. Treatment of the sample with HDAC1 resulted in an increase in the B form (Fig. 5, HDAC1), whereas treatment with acetyl-CoA plus TSA resulted in an increase in the A and M forms with a concomitant decrease in the B form (Fig. 5, bottom panel). These data suggest that the A and M forms are, respectively, highly and moderately acetylated, whereas the B form is deacetylated. However, it was also noted that HDAC1 and acetyl-CoA, respectively, did not completely deacetylate or acetylate PCNA. This may be due to substantial amounts of acetylase and deacetylase in the samples. Alternatively, not all the acetylation sites were accessible under our experimental conditions. Subcellular Localization of PCNA Isoforms in the Context of Cell Cycle Progression—We examined PCNA protein levels in several subcellular fractions at different cell cycle positions as described previously (15Naryzhny S.N. Lee H. Electrophoresis. 2001; 22: 1764-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 17Spector D.L. Goldman R.D. Leinwand L.A. The Nuclear Matrix: Preparation for Microscopy and Biochemical. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998: 44.1-44.4Google Scholar, 18Ramsby M. Makowski G. Link A.J. 2-D Proteome Analysis Protocol. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1999: 53-66Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6B, the levels of PCNA in the nuclear extract (NEF, soluble nuclear fraction), chromatin (CMF) and nuclear matrix fractions (NMF) were cell cycle-regulated, whereas those of the cytosol fraction (CF) were relatively constant throughout the cell cycle (Fig. 6B, CF). The PCNA levels significantly increased in NMF and NEF around mid-G1 and the G1/S boundary, respectively (Fig. 6B, NMF and NEF). However, the most dramatic increase (∼7-fold) was seen in the CMF fraction at the G1/S boundary (Fig. 6B, CMF). These data collectively suggest that PCNA translocates to the nuclear matrix in mid-G1 and (from the nuclear matrix) to chromatin when DNA replication starts. We examined whether the PCNA acetylation status was different in each subcellular fraction. As shown in Fig. 6C, only the M form was found in the cytoplasm, whereas substantial amounts of the A form were in the NEF, CMF, and NMF fractions. Most interesting, the B form was found only in the NEF fraction at a level compatible to that of the M form. Taken together, our data suggest that the A and M forms of PCNA may directly participate in the DNA replication process, whereas the B form does not. Although the difference was small, the relative level of the A form was consistently higher in the CMF than NMF. To determine directly whether PCNA acetylation status is associated with cell cycle progression, we examined the levels of the PCNA isoforms in the different cell cycle compartments. As shown in Fig. 7, cells arrested in G0 by isoleucine starvation showed very little A and B forms (45 h without ileu). (The small amount of the A form is likely from the minor cell population in S phase, top left panel in Fig. 7.) When the cells in G0 were released into the cell cycle by incubating them for 18 h in complete medium, over 60% of the cells were in S phase (Fig. 7, 18 h-MEM). This increase in S phase cells coincided with the increased levels of the A and B forms (Fig. 7, 18-h MEM). In contrast, most cells were arrested in G1, and very little of the A and B forms were found when the cells were incubated in the complete medium containing 0.5 μm TSA (Fig. 7, 18-h MEM + TSA). Although only deacetylation was inhibited, hardly any A form was present in the TSA-treated sample (Fig. 7, bottom panel). The data are also consistent with the fact that cells in G0 phase contained very little highly acetylated PCNA (Fig. 7, top panel). PCNA Acetylation and Deacetylation May be Carried Out by p300 and HDAC, Respectively—To identify the enzymes that are responsible for the acetylation and deacetylation of PCNA, the immunoprecipitated proteins by PC10 were subjected to immunoblot analysis by using anti-HDAC1 and -p300 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 8A, HDAC1 was effectively co-immunoprecipitated with PCNA by PC10 (lane 1), suggesting that deacetylation of PCNA is mediated by HDAC1. p300, a transcription factor with acetylase activity, was also co-immunoprecipitated with PCNA (Fig. 8A, lane 1). Thus, this set of data suggests that PCNA may be acetylated and deacetylated by p300 and HDAC1, respectively. This conclusion is consistent with the in vitro data presented in Figs. 4 and 5. The acetylation of PCNA by p300 may be essential for DNA replication, because p300-/- fibroblasts are not capable of DNA synthesis (27Hasan S. Hassa P.O. Imhof R. Hottiger M.O. Nature. 2001; 410: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Acetylated PCNA Showed Higher Affinity to DNA Polymerases than a Deacetylated Form—To examine whether the acetylation status of PCNA affects its ability to bind to DNA polymerases, the proteins immunoprecipitated by PC10 from cell extracts treated by either HDAC1 or TSA were subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-DNA polymerase antibodies. PCNA treated with HDAC1 showed much lower binding affinity to DNA polymerases β and δ than the sample treated with TSA (Fig. 8B, lanes 4 versus 5). The decrease of affinity was particularly notable between deacetylated PCNA and DNA polymerase δ (Fig. 8B, lanes 4 and 5 of the middle panel). This information has established that PCNA acetylation and deacetylation play an important role for its binding to DNA polymerases and, thus, for DNA replication. We next carried out in vitro DNA replication assay after the PCNA complex immunoprecipitated by PC10 from NEF was treated with acetyl-CoA plus TSA or HDAC1. As shown in Fig. 8C, the sample treated with HDAC1 (i.e. deacetylated) showed significantly lower DNA polymerization activity than that treated with acetyl-CoA plus TSA. These data are consistent with the idea that PCNA acetylation is important for DNA replication. Concluding Remarks—Taken together, our data support that PCNA in the M form takes position proximal to the replication initiation sites that are associated with the nuclear matrix, probably in mid to late G1 (Fig. 6B). It should be noted that the pre-replication complexes would have already formed at the origins of DNA replication by this time (28Takisawa H. Mimura S. Kubota Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 690-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). It should also be noted that the replication origins bound by pre-replication complexes are physically associated and fractionated with the nuclear matrix (29Dijkwel P.A. Hamlin J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5398-5409Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The PCNA isoform loaded onto chromatin upon replication initiation may also be the M form because it is the dominant form both in CMF and NMF fractions (Fig. 6C). The A form may also be involved in DNA replication, possibly in the process of loading PCNA onto chromatin, because only a relatively small amount of this form was found in the CMF, NMF, and NEF but not in the CF fraction (Fig. 6). It is interesting to note that a high level of the B form is found only in the nuclear soluble fraction (i.e. NEF, Fig. 6C). Because the B form did not show high affinity to DNA polymerases β and δ (Fig. 8B), it may not be involved in DNA replication. Rather, our data are consistent with the idea that the PCNA B form is associated with replication termination. However, our data do not distinguish whether deacetylation invokes the dissociation of PCNA from DNA polymerases and chromatin, or PCNA is deacetylated after dissociated from chromatin. The finding of this novel PCNA regulation mechanism by acetylation/deacetylation should open a new dimension of understanding about this biologically and clinically important protein."

Previously, we have shown that the mature form of SREBP-2 is a substrate of Erk-mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK). The aim of the present study was to identify Erk-specific phosphorylation sites. Using a protein chemistry approach, we could identify Ser-432 and Ser-455 as major phosphorylation sites. Further characterization by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and promoter reporter gene analyses revealed that phosphorylation does not influence protein/DNA interaction, but enhances trans-activity. In intact cells, SREBP-2 is phosphorylated by insulin, which seems to be related to their bio-responses on low density lipoprotein receptor activity. These results suggest that activation of Erk-MAPK pathways by hormones such as insulin might be related to a novel regulatory principle of SREBP-2.

To date, three SREBP isoforms have been detected: SREBP-1a, SREBP-1c (shorter splicing variant of SREBP-1a), as well as SREBP-2 (1Briggs M.R. Yokoyama C. Wang X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol.

SREBP-2 is a major regulator of cholesterol homeostasis, whereas SREBP-1c regulates predominantly de novo synthesis of fatty acids. In contrast, SREBP-1a seems to influence both lipogenic and cholesterogenic enzymes (6Amemiya-Kudo M. Shimano H. Hasty A.H. Yahagi N. Yoshikawa T. Matsuzaka T. Okazaki H. Tamura Y. Iizuka Y.

Activation of SREBPs initiated by cellular cholesterol depletion is mediated by sequential cleavage (7Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). As a result, the amino-terminal domain of the protein translocates into the nucleus and activates transcription of target genes. Beside this mechanism, which controls the abundance of activated SREBPs in the cell, we have demonstrated that trans-activity of the N-terminal domain of SREBPs is regulated directly by extra cellular stimuli, e.g. by hormones such as insulin (8Kotzka J.

Moreover, in these studies, we have shown that the N-terminal domains of SREBP-1a, SREBP-1c, and SREBP-2 are substrates of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) subfamily of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK). In this study, we have identified Ser-432 and Ser-455 as the major phosphorylation sites of Erk-MAPK in SREBP-2 using protein chemistry methodology. This phosphorylation has no influence on DNA interaction but affects trans-activity of SREBP-2. Accordingly, in cells, activation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene by insulin is coupled to the identified Erk-specific phosphorylation sites in SREBP-2. Plasmids and Molecular Cloning—Construction of the LDL receptor (LDLR) promoter reporter gene plasmid containing a functional intact sterol regulatory element (sre)-1 flanked by two SP1 elements (phLDL4-luc) was described previously (10Streicher R. Kotzka J. Muller-Wieland D. Siemeister G. Munck M. Avci H. Krone W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7128-7133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain of human SREBP-2 (amino acids 1–468) was inserted in-frame to glutathione S-transferase (GST) into pGEX-3X (Amersham Biosciences) to generate GST-fusion proteins (9Kotzka J. Muller-Wieland D. Roth G. Kremer L. Munck M. Schürmann S. Knebel B. Krone W. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 99-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The construction of mutated forms of the N-terminal domain of SREBP-2 (SREBP-2-NT) (S432A, S455A, and S432A/S455A) was performed as described below. Vector for expressing SREBP-2-NT or mutated SREBP-2-NT in mammalian cells was constructed by ligating the N-terminal domain as a BamHI/EcoRI fragment (1403 base pairs) into the BamHI and EcoRI site of pcDNA3.1HisA (Invitrogen). Subsequently, hemagglutinin (HA) tag was added to the 5′ end of SREBP-2-NT constructs after linearization with BamHI by PCR through the deletion of the His tag and first codon of SREBP-2 using the following primers: sense primer (single-underlined indicates the DNA sequence of HA peptide and double-underlined indicates the DNA sequence of SREBP-2), 5′-GGATCCATGTACCCATACGACGTCCCAGACTACGCTGACGACAGCGGCGAG-3′, and antisense primer (vector sequence of pcDNA3.1/HisA, nt 919–896), 5′-GGTAAGCTTAAGTTTAAACGCTAG-3′. After amplification, PCR reaction was digested with DpnI, followed by religation. To construct Gal4-SREBP-2-NT, Gal4-SREBP-2-NT S432A, Gal4-SREBP-2-NT S455A, and Gal4-SREBP-2-NT S432A/S455A, the corresponding fragments were ligated as a BamHI/EcoRI fragment into the BamHI and EcoRI site of expression vector pFA-CMV (Stratagene) containing the DNA-binding domain of yeast transcription factor Gal4 (amino acids 1–147). Then, for in-frame insertion, the construct was digested with BamHI, refilled with Klenow construct, and religated. The sequences of the constructs were confirmed by using a DNA sequencer model 373A (Applied Biosystem Inc.). Reporter plasmid pG5-Luc containing five Gal4 DNA-binding sites cloned upstream of a minimal promoter element, and the firefly luciferase gene was obtained from Promega. The Renilla expression vector pRL(-mcs) was generated by eliminating the multiple cloning site of pRL-null vector supplied from Promega. Expression vector pUSE/MEK2D for dominant-active MEK2 S222D/S226D under control of cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The Ser → Ala mutants were produced by site-directed mutagenesis of pGEX-3X-SREBP-2-NT using the QuikChange Kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The following primers were used for the amplification reaction (complementary 3′ primer is not listed; mutated nucleotides are in bold): Ser-432 → Ala (nt 1411: Thr → Gly), 5′-GAATGTCCTTCTGATGGCCCCCCCAGCCTCTG-3′; Ser-455 → Ala (nt 1480/1481: AG → GC), 5′-CCATTGACTCTGAGCCAGGAGCCCCTCTATTGGATGATGCAAAGG-3′.

Protein phosphorylation by MAPK Erk1 and Erk2 (Upstate Biotechnology) was performed with 10 μg of GST-SREBP-2-NT fusion protein or 10 μg of mutated GST-SREBP-2-NT (S432A, S455A, S432A/S455A) fusion protein and activated GST-Erk1 (40 ng/μg substrate) or GST-Erk2 fusion protein (10 ng/μg substrate) in kinase buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 6.25 mm β-glycerol-phosphate, 1.25 mm EGTA, 0.25 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.25 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2). The reaction was initiated by the addition of 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP and 0.1 mCi/ml in a final volume of 40 μl of kinase buffer. The reaction was terminated after 15 min at 25 °C by the addition of 5× sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) loading buffer and boiling for 5 min. Phosphorylated proteins were separated by SDS-10% PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography of the Coomassie-stained dried gels. For electro-mobility shift assay (EMSA), 1 μg of pcDNA3.1HisA/SREBP-2-NT was in vitro transcribed and translated as His-tagged protein by TNT T7/T3-coupled reticulocyte lysate system, according to the manufacturer's recommendations, in a final volume of 50 μl (Promega). Thereafter, the His-SREBP-2-NT was purified by using Ni-NTA magnetic agarose beads according to the supplier's instruction manual (Qiagen). For phosphorylation, 200 ng of isolated protein was incubated with recombinant activated MAPK Erk2 (1 ng/0.1 μg substrate) in kinase buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 6.25 mm β-glycerol-phosphate, 1.25 mm EGTA, 0.25 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.25 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2) under conditions specified in the supplier's instruction manual (Upstate Biotechnology). The reaction was started by the addition of ATP to a final concentration of 10 μm and was carried out in a final volume of 50 μl for 15 min at 25 °C. To control phosphorylation efficiency, kinase reaction was performed with an aliquot of His-SREBP-2-NT using an additional 10 μCi [γ-32P]ATP. Identification of Phosphorylation Sites by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and Nanoelectrospray Mass Spectrometry— 500 μg of GST-SREBP-2-NT fusion protein (7 nmol) was phosphorylated by 50 μg of GST-Erk2 as described above with 250 μm ATP (specific activity 100 cpm/pmol, Cerenkov radiation). The proteins were separated by SDS-10% PAGE, and phosphorylated GST-SREBP-2-NT was digested with 50 μg of trypsin (sequencing grade, Roche Applied Science) in the excised gel pieces overnight at 37 °C. The peptides were eluted with 50 mm ammonium carbonate and separated on an anion-exchange column (Nucleogel SAX 1000–8/46, 50 × 4.6 mm, Machery & Nagel) using a Beckman gold solvent delivery system. The HPLC flow rate was set at 0.5 ml/min. After injection of a 1-ml sample, the peptides were eluted, beginning with 100% buffer A (20 mm NH4CH2COOH, pH 7.0) and 0% of buffer B (0.5 m KH2PO4, pH 4.0). Ratios of solution B were increased from 0 to 10% in 40 min and from 10 to 50% in 75 min. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected. Radioactive fractions were subjected to reversed-phase HPLC. These peptides were separated on a C18 reversed-phase column (150 × 0.8 mm, 5-μm particle size, 300-Å pore size, LC Packings, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) using an ABI 140B solvent delivery system (Applied Biosystems). The HPLC flow rate was adjusted to 70 μl/min by means of a titanium t-piece. After application of a 100-μl sample, elution started with 95% of solution A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and 5% of solution B (acetonitrile/water/trifluoroacetic acid (84:16:0.1, v/v/v)). The content of solution B was raised from 5 to 50% in 90 min and from 50 to 100% in 15 min. The collected fractions containing radiolabeled peptides were subjected to mass spectrometry and Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems model 476A pulse-liquid sequenator (11Meyer H.E. Hoffman-Posorske E. Donella-Deana A. Korte H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 206-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—For the protein/DNA-binding reaction, two double-stranded oligonucleotides were used (complementary 3′ primer is not listed): sre-1 fragment (core of cis element is underlined), 5′-GAAAATCACCCCACTGCAAACTCCTCCCCCTGCT-3′ (comprising positions -69 to -39 from the position of transcription start of LDLR promoter; Ref. 1Briggs M.R. Yokoyama C. Wang X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14490-14496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the ADD1/SREBP1c consensus E-box fragment (core of cis element is underlined), 5′-GATCCTGATCACGTGATCGAGGAG-3′ (12Kim J.B. Spotts G.D. Halvorsen Y.D. Shih H.M. Ellenberger T. Towle H.C. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2582-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotides were prepared by combining equal amounts of the complementary single-stranded DNA in a solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA followed by heating to 90 °C for 2 min and then cooling to room temperature. The annealed oligonucleotides were 32P-labeled using a Ready-To-Go T4 polynucleotide kinase kit according to the supplier's instruction manual (Amersham Biosciences). The binding reactions were carried out in a volume of 20 μl containing 15 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 0.5 μg poly[d(I·C)] (Roche Applied Science) and 10 fmol of 32P-labeled DNA with 10 μl of protein mixture. The samples were incubated at 25 °C for 20 min and immediately electrophoresed on a native 5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5× TBE (1× TBE: 89 mm Tris-boric acid, pH 8.3, 1 mm EDTA). Electrophoresis was performed at 150 V for 1.5 h at 4 °C. EMSA was analyzed by autoradiography of the dried gel. Equal loading was confirmed by Western blot analysis of 20 μl of protein mixture. Cell Culture, Transient Transfection, and Dual Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay—HepG2-cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS) (Invitrogen) and antibiotics (Invitrogen) in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Before transfection, cells were released by trypsinization, washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS. For the reporter gene assay, cell suspension (2 × 105 cells/well) was mixed with reporter plasmid phLDL4-luc (0.5 μg/well), with Renilla expression vector pRL(-mcs) (0.1 μg/well) for controlling transfection efficiency, and either with pcDNA3/HA-SREBP-2-NT, pcDNA3/HA-SREBP-2-NT S432A, pcDNA3/HA-SREBP-2-NT S455A, pcDNA3/HA-SREBP-1a-NT S432A/S455A, or pcDNA3.0 vector (25 ng/well) as indicated in the figure legends. For testing trans-activity of SREBP-2 and mutants, cell suspension (2 × 105 cells/well) was mixed with reporter plasmid pG5-luc (0.5 μg/well), with Renilla expression vector pRL(-mcs) (0.1 μg/well) for controlling transfection efficiency, and either with pFA/Gal4-SREBP-2-NT, pFA/Gal4-SREBP-2-NT S432A, pFA/Gal4-SREBP-2-NT S455A, pFA/Gal4-SREBP-2-NT S432A/S455A, pFA-CMV vector (25 ng/well), and with pUSE/MEK2D or pUSE vector (25 ng/well) as indicated in the figure legends. Thereafter, samples were transferred to an electroporation cuvette (inter electrode distance: 0.4 cm, Bio-Rad) and pulsed for 18 msec in GenePulser II (Bio-Rad). Before seeding on six-well plates (Greiner Bio-One), cell suspension was diluted with RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS and antibiotics. On day 1 after transfection, cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.5% lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS) (Sigma) for 16 h. Subsequently, cells were harvested in 100 μl of passive lysis buffer (supplied with the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega)); firefly as well as Renilla luciferase activities of cell extracts (20 μl/probe) were measured according to the supplier's instructions (Promega) with a microplate luminometer LB96V (EG&G Berthold). To verify the relevance of the identified phosphorylation sites in SREBP-2 for insulin-mediated signaling in the cellular context, cell suspension (2 × 106) was mixed with 5 μg of pcDNA3/HA-SREBP-2-NT or mutated SREBP-2-NT constructs and transiently transfected by electroporation (18 msec). Subsequently, cells were diluted with RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS and antibiotics and seeded in 35-mm dishes (1 × 106/dish). For treatment, cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.5% LPDS on day 1 after transfection for 16 h. Then, cells were incubated for 45 min without or with insulin (1 × 107), and whole-cell extracts were analyzed by Western blotting. Preparation of Cell Extracts—Whole-cell extracts were prepared by scraping off the cells in 250 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) on culture dishes. The suspensions were incubated on a thermomixer (Eppendorf) for 30 min at 4 °C. Subsequently, lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min, and aliquots of supernatants were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. Protein concentrations were measured using a Bio-Rad protein assay. Western Blot Analysis—Cell extracts were mixed with 5× SDS loading buffer and resolved on a 5.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (59:1, acrylamide:bisacrylamide). To obtain better separation of the phosphorylated form of SREBP-2-NT from the unphosphorylated SREBP-2-NT, 4 m urea was added to the separation gel. EMSA samples were mixed with 5× SDS loading buffer and separated on an SDS-7.5% PAGE. Subsequently, proteins were electroblotted to nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond™ ECL, Amersham Biosciences). After blocking overnight at 4 °C in 1% (w/v) blocking solution (Roche Applied Science) in 1× Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, membrane with proteins of cell extracts was probed with rat monoclonal antibody against HA peptide (YPYDVP-DYA) conjugated with peroxidase (clone 3F10, 1:5000, Roche Applied Science). Membrane with EMSA samples was probed with antibody directed against His-tag (anti-HisG-HRP, 1:1000, Invitrogen). Visualization was performed with ECL™ plus Western blotting detection reagents according to manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences) and Kodak X-Omat AR film. Previously, we have shown that the N-terminal domain of SREBP-2 (SREBP-2-NT) is a substrate of Erk1- and Erk2-MAPK in vitro (9Kotzka J. Muller-Wieland D. Roth G. Kremer L. Munck M. Schürmann S. Knebel B. Krone W. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 99-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phospho-amino acid analyses revealed that phosphorylation of SREBP-2-NT by MAPK Erk1 and Erk2 occurs on serine residues (data not shown). The aim of this study was the identification of the Erk-MAPK-specific phosphorylation sites. Peptide Map Analysis by HPLC of in Vitro Phosphorylated SREBP-2-NT—Erk1 and Erk2 are closely related MAPK; therefore, we tested whether both target the same phosphorylation sites in SREBP-2-NT. The N-terminal domain of GST-SREBP-2 was incubated with recombinant GST-Erk1 as well as GST-Erk2 in the presence of radioactive [γ-32P] ATP in vitro. The reaction was stopped after 15 min by the addition of loading buffer, proteins were separated by SDS-10% PAGE, and dried gel was exposed to x-ray film. Subsequently, the specific radioactive bands of the proteins were tryptic-digested, and eluted peptides were separated by anion-exchange HPLC. The elution profile of Erk1-phosphorylated SREBP-2-NT revealed two major peaks (fractions 45 and 57) in addition to several minor peaks (Fig. 1A). Peak distribution in the elution profile of SREBP-2-NT-phosphorylated Erk2 was identical (Fig. 1B). Identification of Ser-432 and Ser-455 as Erk-MAPK-specific Phosphorylation Sites in SREBP-2-NT—To separate co-migrating peptides, radioactive fractions of Erk2-phosphorylated SREBP-2-NT corresponding to peak 1 or peak 2 of anion-exchange HPLC (see Fig. 1B) were pooled and analyzed by C18 reversed-phase HPLC. The spectra revealed two phospho peptides for peak 1 (Fig. 1C, see asterisks) and only one phosphorylated peptide for peak 2 (Fig. 1D). Further analyses using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry led to the identification of Ser-432 and Ser-455 as phosphorylated amino acids in the phosphopeptides IEDFNQNVLLMS*PPASDSGSQAGFSPY (amino acids 423–447) (peak 1) and SIDSEPGS*PLLDDAK (amino acids 448–462) (peak 2), respectively. Fraction 19 of peak 1 revealed no analyzable results. Verification of Ser-432 and Ser-455 as Major Phosphorylation Sites in SREBP-2—To verify the identified phosphorylation sites in SREBP-2-NT, Ser-432 and Ser-455 were replaced by alanine using site-directed mutagenesis. Wild type, single- as well as double-mutated SREBP-2-NTs (S432A, S455A, and S432A/S455A) were expressed as GST fusion proteins, purified, and incubated with GST-Erk2 in the presence of radioactive [γ-32P]ATP in vitro. The reaction was stopped after 15 min, the protein mix was separated by SDS-PAGE, and the gel was exposed to x-ray film (Fig. 2A). Autoradiography indicated that mutation of Ser-432 and Ser-455 to alanine reduced phosphate incorporation by 40 and 50%, respectively. Phosphate incorporation of the double-mutant S432A/S455A was even reduced by ∼70%. Phosphorylated fusion protein bands were cut out, gel slices were incubated with trypsin, and derived peptides were analyzed by anion-exchange chromatography. In contrast to the elution profile of SREBP-2-NT (Fig. 2B), peak 1 was missed in the profile of tryptic-digested SREBP-2-NT S432A (Fig. 2C), and peak 2 disappeared when Ser-455 was mutated to alanine (Fig. 2D). Consistently, the elution profile of the double-mutant S432A/S455A lacked both major peaks (Fig. 2E). Functional Relevance of Phosphorylation in SREBP-2-NT for Protein/DNA Binding and Trans-activity—Phosphorylation can influence protein/DNA interaction or trans-activity of transcription factors (13Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar). To analyze protein/DNA interaction, in vitro transcribed and translated His-SREBP-2-NT was incubated without or with Erk2-MAPK and subsequently analyzed by EMSA. Equal loading was verified by Western blot analysis, and phosphorylation efficiency was controlled by using radiolabeled ATP for kinase reaction in separate assays (Fig. 3, A and B). Autoradiography of EMSA showed that SREBP-2-NT interacted with DNA-fragments containing sre-1 (Fig. 3C) as well as E-box motive (Fig. 3D) to a similar degree, and phosphorylation of SREBP-2-NT (lane 8) had no effect upon protein/DNA interaction with either motive (compare lane 7 with lane 8 in Fig. 3). To test the influence of phosphorylation on trans-activity, we performed promoter reporter gene assays recruiting the Path-Detect trans-reporting system (Stratagene). In this assay, SREBP-2-NT, SREBP-2-NT S432A, SREBP-2-NT S455A, and SREBP-2-NT S432A/S455A were expressed as fusion proteins with the DNA-binding domain of yeast Gal4 (amino acids 1–147) (Fig. 4). The DNA-binding domain alone does not have any trans-activity per se. Accordingly, detected activity reflects trans-activity of the fused domain, i.e. SREBP-2-NT or mutants. HepG2 cells were transfected with Gal4-SREBP-2-NT, single and double mutants, and with upstream activator of Erk-MAPK cascade MEK2D for testing the effect of Erk in vivo. The basal trans-activity of Gal4-SREBP-2-NT was 83,967.4 ± 14,595.06 relative light units, after cotransfection with MEK2D SREBP-2-NT trans-activity was elevated ∼3.5-fold. Basal activities of SREBP-2-NT S432A, SREBP-2-NT S455A, as well as SREBP-2-NT S432A/S455A were comparable with SREBP-2-NT. On the contrary, cotransfection with MEK2D increased trans-activity of SREBP-2-NT S432A just 1.6-fold and trans-activity of SREBP-2-NT S455A 1.4-fold. In the case of the double-mutant SREBP-2-NT S432A/S455A, no stimulation occurred. Functional Relevance of Phosphorylation in Vivo—To test the relevance of identified phosphorylation sites in a cellular context, HepG2 cells were transfected with SREBP-2-NT or mutated forms of SREBP-2-NT and incubated with insulin for 45 min (Fig. 5). Western blot analysis of prepared cell extracts revealed that wild type-related phosphorylation was significantly reduced in single-mutated SREBP-2-NT and completely abolished in the double-mutant. Previously, we have shown that the stimulatory effect of insulin on LDL receptor promoter is mediated by SREBPs (9Kotzka J. Muller-Wieland D. Roth G. Kremer L. Munck M. Schürmann S. Knebel B. Krone W. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 99-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Streicher R. Kotzka J. Muller-Wieland D. Siemeister G. Munck M. Avci H. Krone W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7128-7133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). To prove that the insulin-induced activation of LDL receptor promoter is coupled to the identified phosphorylation sites in SREBP-2, we performed promoter reporter gene assays. HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with LDL receptor promoter construct phLDL4-luc, HA-SREBP-2-NT, or mutated SREBP-2-NTs. On day 1 after transfection, cells were incubated with insulin for 3 h, and after cell lysis, reporter gene activity was measured. Fig. 6 shows that basal activity of LDL receptor promoter (310.23 ± 108.78 relative light units) was strongly increased by ectopic expression of wild-type SREBP-2-NT (6527.11 ± 2379.48 relative light units). Incubation with insulin elevated the promoter activity in a synergistic fashion. Basal activities of SREBP-2-NT S432A, SREBP-2-NT S455A, as well as SREBP-2-NT S432A/S455A were comparable with SREBP-2-NT. On the contrary, in cells, ectopically expressed SREBP-2-NT S432A incubation with insulin increased promoter activity just 1.3-fold and 1.4-fold, respectively; ectopically expressed SREBP-2-NT S455A incubation with insulin increased promoter activity just 1.2-fold and 1.3-fold, respectively. In the case of the double-mutant SREBP-2-NT S432A/S455A, basal activity was comparable with wild type, but no stimulation occurred by insulin. These results show that the synergistic activation of SREBP-2 by insulin is dependent upon phosphorylation.Fig. 6Insulin-stimulated activation of LDLR promoter was mediated by Ser-432 and Ser-455 in SREBP-2 in vivo. HepG2 cells (2 × 105 cells/well) were transiently transfected with LDL receptor promoter plasmid phLDL4-luc (0.5 μg/well), pcDNA3/HA-SREBP-2-NT, pcDNA3/HA-SREBP-2-NT S432A, pcDNA3/HA-SREBP-2-NT S455A, pcDNA3/HA-SREBP-1a-NT S432A/S455A, or pcDNA3.0 vector (25 ng/well) and for controlling of transfection efficiency with Renilla expression vector pRL(-mcs) (0.1 μg/well,) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” On day 1 after transfection, cultured medium was changed to culture medium containing 0.5% LPDS for 16 h. Before analysis of dual luciferase activity, cells were treated without or with insulin (1 × 10-7m) for 3 h. The promoter strength is represented by the absolute luciferase activity measured in the cellular extract. Results are given as mean ± S.D. of five independent experiments, each performed in triplicate (p < 0.01).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Cell surface events lead to modification of cell-specific gene expression patterns, e.g. modulating signal transduction pathways (14Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1172-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Recruitment of the MAPK cascades is a general mechanism for a rapid gene regulatory answer of cells to environmental stimuli by setting the activation state of different transcription factors. The core module of all MAPK cascades consists of three kinases, which are activated by sequential phosphorylation. To date, several MAPK cascades have been defined; in mammalian cells, the best characterized are the Erk, the stress-activated cJun N-terminal kinases and the cytokine-suppressive anti-inflammatory drug-binding p38 kinase pathways (15Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2274) Google Scholar). These highly conserved proline-directed serine/threonine kinases are involved in hormone action, apoptosis, cell growth, and differentiation. Previously, we demonstrated that the SREBP transcription factors are targets of intracellular signaling pathways and substrates of Erk1 and Erk2 (8Kotzka J. Muller-Wieland D. Koponen A. Njamen D. Kremer L. Roth G. Munck M. Knebel B. Krone W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 9Kotzka J. Muller-Wieland D. Roth G. Kremer L. Munck M. Schürmann S. Knebel B. Krone W. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 99-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, in SREBP-1a, we identified Ser-117 as a major Erk-MAPK phosphorylation site (16Roth G. Kotzka J. Kremer L. Lehr S. Lohaus C. Meyer H.E. Krone W. Muller-Wieland D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33302-33307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). By using the same protein chemistry approach, we have identified in this study serine residues 432 and 455 as major phosphorylation sites of Erk in SREBP-2-NT. Structural features of the transcription factors SREBPs show that they belong to the basic helix-loop-helix leucine-zipper (bHLH-LZ) super-family (17Sato R. Yang J. Wang X. Evans M.J. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17267-17273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Atchley W.R. Terhalle W. Dress A. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 48: 501-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Most bHLH-LZ proteins bind as either homo- or hetero-dimers to a consensus DNA sequence. DNA binding is mediated by a region of basic amino acids immediately upstream to the bHLH-LZ dimerization domain. In addition to the DNA-binding domain and the protein-binding domain on the C-terminal site, there is an acidic domain in the SREBP N-terminal region, which seems to play a role in trans-activity (19Shimano H. Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 20Oliner J.D. Andresen J.M. Hansen S.K. Zhou S. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2903-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The identified Erk-MAPK phosphorylation site Ser-117 in SREBP-1a is located next to the N-terminal acidic domain of SREBP-1a (amino acids 1–61). Trans-activity of SREBP-1a in response to insulin stimulation of Erk-MAPK seems to be due to phosphorylation-mediated modifications of this region. In contrast, both SREBP-2-NT phosphorylation sites Ser-432 and Ser-455 are near the bHLH-LZ (amino acids 331–401) domain, which may affect dimerization and DNA binding. Thus, phosphorylation of one or both sites in SREBP-2-NT may influence the generation of homo- as well as hetero-dimers, a phenomenon that has been shown for the transcription factor Max. CKII-mediated phosphorylation of Max prevents Max homo-dimerization, whereas formation of Myc-Max hetero-dimers is not affected (21Berberich S.J. Cole M.D. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 166-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 22Bousset K. Henriksson M. Lutscher-Firzlaff J.M. Litchfield D.W. Luscher B. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3211-3220PubMed Google Scholar, 23Koskinen P.J. Vastrik I. Makela T.P. Eisenmann R.N. Alitalo K. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 8: 313-320Google Scholar). Another case is the influence of phosphorylation on protein/DNA-binding interaction of many transcription factors i.e. ER81 or TAL1/SCL. For the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor TAL1/SCL, it has been shown that phosphorylation at Ser-172, which is located in a region proximal to the DNA-binding domain, alters DNA binding without interference with the protein/protein interaction, whereas phosphorylation of Ser-122 elevates trans-activity (24Wadman I.A. Hsu H.L. Cobb M.H. Baer R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3713-3716PubMed Google Scholar, 25Prasad K.S. Brandt S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11457-11462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). On the other hand, DNA-binding ability of the ETS transcription factor ER81 is reduced and trans-activity is enhanced by phosphorylation on Ser-334 (26Wu J. Janknecht R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42669-42679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To test the effect of phosphorylation on DNA binding of SREBP-2-NT, we performed EMSA. Because of the dual binding specificity to two distinct DNA motifs, i.e. both sre-1 and E-box (12Kim J.B. Spotts G.D. Halvorsen Y.D. Shih H.M. Ellenberger T. Towle H.C. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2582-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), we analyzed whether the binding ability to one of them was influenced by phosphorylation. Our investigations show no influence on both binding motifs, implying that DNA-binding ability and at least dimerization of SREBP-2-NT is not affected by phosphorylation. In addition to DNA interaction, phosphorylation could influence trans-activity. Using a heterologous promoter reporter gene system reveals that mutation of the phosphorylation sites in SREBP-2-NT did not affect basal activity, but dramatically reduces inducibility by MEK2D. This result demonstrates that Erk1/2-dependent phosphorylation plays a major role in the regulation of SREBP-2-NT trans-activity, and that this transcription factor is a relevant substrate of the Erk-MAPK cascade. Taken together, we have shown that SREBP-2 is phosphorylated by Erk MAPK at Ser-432 and Ser-455. Moreover, these sites are not only targets for Erk1 or Erk2 in vitro but also in intact cells. Furthermore, direct evidence is provided that SREBP-2 is phosphorylated by stimulating cells with insulin, and that identified phosphorylation sites seem to play a role in mediating the effects of insulin on LDLR promoter activity. In support of this idea, we have previously shown that the effects of both inductors of LDLR promoter activity are abolished by inhibiting the Erk-MAPK pathway in cells lacking SREBP-2 (9Kotzka J.

At the least, these data support our concept that, besides sterol-dependent cleavage, SREBPs are regulated by phosphorylation affecting their trans-activity. Therefore, cells are able to react more individually upon environmental stimuli. We thank H. W.

The receptor-regulated Smad (R-Smad) proteins are regulated by ubiquitin-mediated degradation, yet the precise control of Smad4 protein stability is unclear. We have identified SCFβ-TrCP1, a ubiquitin (E3) ligase, as a critical determinant for the protein degradation of Smad4 protein. F-box protein β-TrCP1 in this E3 ligase interacts with Smad4 both in yeast and in mammalian cells, but has no interaction with Smad2 and has weak interaction with Smad3. The β-TrCP1/Smad3 interaction was abolished by Smad4 gene silencing, indicating the interaction is indirect and is through Smad4. Ectopic expression of SCF complex containing β-TrCP1 is sufficient to induce the ubiquitination and degradation of Smad4. Furthermore, small interfering RNA-triggered endogenous β-TrCP1 suppression increases the expression of Smad4 protein. Consistent with these results, cells that overexpress the SCF complex display an inhibited TGF-β-dependent transcriptional activity and an impaired cell cycle arrest function.

Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) 1The abbreviations used are: TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; R-Smad, receptor-regulated Smad; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; siRNA, small interfering RNA. and related polypeptides constitute the largest cytokine family and regulate many aspects of cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, and apoptosis. Signaling responses to TGF-β-like factors are mediated by two types of transmembrane receptors, TGF-β type I receptor and type II receptor, and their intracellular substrates, the Smad proteins (1Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3999) Google Scholar). Following ligand binding, the activated receptors directly phosphorylate regulatory Smads (R-Smads). Phosphorylated R-Smads form complexes with Smad4 and accumulate in the nucleus to regulate transcription of a variety of genes. Thus, Smad4 is the common signaling molecule shared by the entire TGF-β superfamily, and it is critical for transcriptional activation. Proper TGF-β signaling requires precise control of Smad functions. It is reported that Smads are regulated by ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Specifically, Smurf1, a Hect-domain-containing E3 ligase triggers the degradation of Smad1 and Smad5 and inhibits bone morphogenetic protein signaling (2Zhu H. Kavsak P. Abdollah S. Wrana J.L. Thomsen G.H. Nature. 1999; 400: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Smurf2, a Smurf1-related ligase, can target Smad1 and sometimes Smad2 for degradation in a TGF-β-dependent manner (3Lin X. Liang M. Feng X.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36818-36822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 4Zhang Y. Chang C. Gehling D.J. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Derynck R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 974-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined whether and how the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway regulates Smad4 degradation. Protein degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays a vital role in monitoring the abundance of many regulatory proteins. A polyubiquitin chain is built onto one or multiple lysine residues of a substrate to target it for capture and degradation by the 26 S proteasome. Ubiquitination of proteins requires a multienzyme system. A key component of ubiquitination pathways, the ubiquitin (E3) ligases, controls both the specificity and timing of substrate ubiquitination. A class of ubiquiting ligase is the SCF complexes formed by Skp1, cullin1, Roc1, and a variable F-box protein (5Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar), which serves as the substrate recognition subunit.

Nature. 2003; 426: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar) and mediates their protein degradation. We previously demonstrated that Jun activation domain binding protein 1 (Jab1) interacts with Smad4 and induces its degradation (11Wan M. Cao X. Wu Y. Bai S. Wu L. Shi X. Wang N. Cao X. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Jab1 is one of the eight subunits of the COP9 signalosome (CSN) that also induces the degradation of p53 (12Bech-Otschir D. Kraft R. Huang X. Henklein P. Kapelari B. Pollmann C. Dubiel W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1630-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) and p27 (13Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Kato J. Nature. 1999; 398: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). In this study, we sought to identify a Jab1-correlated E3 ligase that mediates Smad4 degradation. We found an E3 ligase complex SCFβ-TrCP1 that is responsible for Smad4 ubiquitination and degradation. F-box protein β-TrCP1 in this complex associates with Smad4 and SCFβ-TrCP overexpressing cells display increased ubiquitination and degradation of Smad4. Consequently, SCFβ-TrCP reduced the transcriptional activity and cellular function of TGF-β signaling. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting Analysis—Cells were lysed in 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. For immunoprecipitation, lysed cells were incubated with different antibodies as indicated in the figures and protein G plus agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added. Immunocomplexes were washed and were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted to nitrocellulose. All blots were developed by the ECL technique (Amersham Biosciences). Pulse-Chase Assays—To measure the degradation rate of Smad4, cells were incubated at 48 h after transfection with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without methionine and cysteine for 30 min and were pulse-labeled with 100 μCi of [35S]methionine-cysteine protein labeling mix per ml for 40 min. The cells were then washed and incubated in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for various periods of time. The cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, and the protein extract was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity gel (Sigma). The precipitates were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel before autoradiography. In Vivo Ubiquitination Assays—Forty hours after transfection, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using antibody against FLAG, boiled, and then reprecipitated prior to immunoblotting. To detect ubiquitination of precipitated Smad4, Western blot analysis was performed using anti-ubiquitin (Ubi) antibody. We had previously demonstrated that Jab1 interacts with Smad4 and induces its degradation (11Wan M. Cao X. Wu Y. Bai S. Wu L. Shi X. Wang N. Cao X. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Jab1, integrated in COP9 complex, has intense association with SCF E3 ligases (14Lyapina S. Cope G. Shevchenko A. Serino G. Tsuge T. Zhou C. Wolf D.A. Wei N. Shevchenko A. Deshaies R.J. Science. 2001; 292: 1382-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). The SCF E3 ligases consist of four subunits including Cullin, Roc1, Skp1, and a variable F-box protein, which functions as the substrate recognition subunit. To determine whether SCF complex ligase is responsible for Smad4 ubiquitination and degradation, we first tested whether F-box proteins in SCF E3 ligase interact with Smad4. β-TrCP1 and Skp2 are two well characterized F-box proteins in mammalian cells. Both F-box proteins were examined for their possible interaction with Smad4 in a yeast two-hybrid assay. Liquid β-galactosidase assay results indicate that Smad4 interacts with β-TrCP1 but not with Skp2. None of the other Smad proteins interacted with either β-TrCP1 or Skp2 (Fig. 1A), suggesting that Smad4 specifically associates with SCFβ-TrCP1. To confirm the Smad4/β-TrCP1 interaction in mammalian cells, we overexpressed the epitope-tagged versions of these proteins in 293T cells and assessed their ability to coimmunoprecipitate. The results demonstrated that FLAG-Smad4 coimmunocipitated with Myc-β-TrCP1 antiserum (Fig. 1B, lane 4) when both proteins were overexpressed. Potential interactions of β-TrCP1 with Smad2 or Smad3 were also examined. β-TrCP1 has nondetectable interaction with Smad2 and weak interaction with Smad3 (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 3). To further investigate whether the β-TrCP1/Smad3 interaction is via Smad4, immunoprecipitation assays were then performed in endogenous Smad4 silenced cells using small interfering RNA (siRNA) from DNA templates in vivo. The β-TrCP1/Smad3 interaction was abolished by cotransfection with higher dose of BS/U6/Smad4 plasmid but not with an irrelevant control plasmid, BS/U6/GFP (Fig. 1C), indicating that this interaction is via Smad4. Furthermore, endogenous Smad4 also coimmunoprecipited with endogenous β-TrCP1, and Jab1 or TGF-β treatment significantly enhances the interaction (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these results indicate that Smad4 specifically interacts with F-box protein β-TrCP1. We then examined whether the association of SCFβ-TrCP1 with Smad4 regulates endogenous Smad4 steady-state level in cells. FLAG-tagged Smad4 was co-transfected into 293T cells with either a single component of the SCF complex (Roc1, Cul1, or β-TrCP1) or in various combinations of the components. While individual component of the SCF complex did not affect the expression of Smad4 (Fig. 2A, lanes 2–4), Cul1 with Roc1 or β-TrCP1 (lanes 6 and 8) significantly reduces Smad4 expression. Smad4 expression was further decreased in the presence of all three components (lane 9). We attempted to determine whether the suppression of endogenous β-TrCP1 by siRNA would increase Smad4 expression. 293T cells were transfected with either BS/U6/GFP or BS/U6/β-TrCP1 plasmid. BS/U6/β-TrCP1 dose-dependently reduced endogenous β-TrCP1 expression (Fig. 2B, lanes 4 and 5 in the first panel). In contrast to the effect of SCFβ-TrCP1, the expression level of endogenous Smad4 increased in the β-TrCP1 siRNA-transfected cells (second panel). BS/U6/GFP, an irrelevant siRNA control, did not change the expression level of both β-TrCP1 and Smad4 (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 3). The observed low Smad4 expression levels in the presence of SCF complex suggested that the SCF complex might have led to increased protein turnover of Smad4. To investigate this possibility, SCF components were co-transfected with FLAG-tagged Smad4 plasmids into 293T cells, and the protein degradation rate was determined in 293T cells by pulse-chase assays. The 35S-labeled Smad4 protein in the presence of SCF E3 ligase rapidly decreased and disappeared at 16 h (Fig. 2C, lower panel). In contrast, 35S-labeled Smad4 without SCF E3 ligase overexpression was considerably more stable and was still present at 16 h (upper panel). The half-life of Smad4 in the absence of SCF was ∼16 h, whereas the half-life of Smad4 in the presence of SCF was ∼7 h (Fig. 2D). We then examined whether SCFβ-TrCP1 degraded R-Smads. The SCF complex (Roc1, Cul1, and β-TrCP1) was cotransfected with epitope-tagged version of Smad2, Smad3, or Smad4 in 293T cells in the presence of TGF-β. SCF complex down-regulated Smad4 expression (Fig. 2E, lanes 6), modestly decreased Smad3 expression (lane 4), and has no effect on Smad2 expression (lane 2) in the presence of TGF-β stimulation. Potential Smad4 ubiquitination mediated by SCFβ-TrCP1 was examined by in vivo ubiquitination assays. Overexpression of SCF components (Roc-1, Cul1, β-TrCP1) in 293T cells promotes the ubiquitination of ectopically expressed FLAG-tagged Smad4 (Fig. 2F, lanes 2 and 3). The effect of TGF-β on SCFβ-TrCP1-induced Smad4 ubiquitination was examined by adding TGF-β in cell culture medium 24 h after gene transfection. The results demonstrated that TGF-β further enhanced the ubiquitination of Smad4 (Fig. 2G, lane 4). Collectively, these data strongly indicate that SCFβ-TrCP1 is a specific E3 ligase that mediates Smad4 degradation and TGF-β enhances the degradation. Smad4 is the only common partner of all the R-Smads and is also known as an activator in R-Smad-induced gene transcription. Conventional views would predict that, because it targets Smad4 for destruction, SCFβ-TrCP1 should down-regulate Smad4-mediated transcriptional activity. Different TGF-β response reporter plasmids (SBE), 4-luc (four repeats of Smad binding element), and ARE-luc (Activin response element) were cotransfected with SCF components and/or Jab1 plasmids in Mv1Lu cells. Ectopic expression of either SCF or Jab1 inhibits TGF-β-induced transcriptional activity. Transcriptional activity was further inhibited when both SCF and Jab1 were overexpressed (Fig. 3, A and B). To clarify the effect of SCFβ-TrCP1 on TGF-β biological function activity, the distribution of the cell population in the G1 and S phases of the cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry following expression of SCFβ-TrCP1. As shown in Fig. 3C, cell growth was arrested by TGF-β1 treatment, as judged by the increase of cells in the G1 phase. SCF inhibited TGF-β1-induced cell growth arrest. To further confirm that the inhibitory effect of SCF is through Smad4 degradation, Smad4 siRNA plasmid was cotransfected with SCF components to induce Smad4 gene silencing, and flow cytometry was performed. Fig. 3D shows that Smad4 gene silencing abolished the inhibitory effects of SCF on TGF-β-mediated cell cycle arrest. We conclude from these experiments that SCFβ-TrCP1 abrogates TGF-β function in vivo by decreasing Smad4 stability. Oncogene Ras (15Saha D. Datta P.K. Beauchamp R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29531-29537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and Jab1 (11Wan M. Cao X. Wu Y. Bai S. Wu L. Shi X. Wang N. Cao X. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) have been reported to mediate Smad4 degradation, but the precise mechanisms are not clear. Here we show that β-TrCP1, a F-box protein in the SCF E3 ligase complex, interacts with Smad4 and induces the degradation of Smad4. This defines a new role for E3 ligase SCFβ-TrCP1-mediated protein ubiquitination and degradation in the TGF-β signaling pathway. Previously, Roc1 in SCFβ-TrCP1 E3 ligase was found to interact with Smad3 and induce Smad3 protein degradation (16Fukuchi M. Imamura T. Chiba T. Ebisawa T. Kawabata M. Tanaka K. Miyazono K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1431-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Smad3 did not interact with F-box protein β-TrCP1 in our yeast two-hybrid assays and has weak interaction in mammalian cells. Furthermore, β-TrCP1/Smad3 interaction was abolished by Smad4 gene silencing, suggesting that this interaction is Smad4-dependent. F-box protein in SCF E3 ligase is the substrate recognition subunit, and the binding between F-box subunit with its protein substrate is essential for protein ubiquitination and degradation. It is most likely that β-TrCP1/Smad, but not Roc-1/Smad, interaction would mediate Smad degradation. β-TrCP1 recognizes the phosphorylated DSGφXS motif (6Yaron A. Hatzubai A. Davis M. Lavon I.

Nature. 2003; 426: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). There is a similar motif in Smad4 protein “DLSGLTLQS.” It is possible that this motif is a Smad4 phosphorylation site for β-TrCP1 recognition. TGF-β stimulation increases both Smad4/β-TrCP1 association and Smad4 ubiquitination by SCFβ-TrCP1. One possibility is that the activated R-Smads upon TGF-β stimulation may play some role in this event. Upon activation by the TGF-β signaling, R-Smad forms a heteromeric complex with Smad4 and translocates into the nucleus where it regulates transcription of target genes. The R-Smad/Smad4 heteromeric complex formation may also enhance the interaction of Smad4 with SCFβ-TrCP1 and trigger the ubiquitination and degradation of this complex. Our data demonstrated that SCF complex induced modest Smad3 degradation in the presence of TGF-β, providing indirect evidence for this hypothesis. Jab1 also enhances the Smad4/β-TrCP1 association. It is possible that Jab1 regulates the formation of the E3 SCFβ-TrCP1 ligase complex by either serving as an adaptor protein between Smad4 and β-TrCP1 or by phosphorylating Smad4 and promoting substrate recognition by its F-box protein β-TrCP1. Jab1 is one of the eight subunits in the CSN complex whose function is at the interface between signal transduction and ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. Recent work indicates that the CSN copurifies with kinases and possesses kinase activity (12Bech-Otschir D. Kraft R. Huang X. Henklein P. Kapelari B. Pollmann C. Dubiel W.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1302-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Thus, Jab1/CSN might phosphorylate Smad4 and promote its association with F-box protein β-TrCP1. Our data also indicate that SCFβ-TrCP1 efficiently impairs TGF-β-induced biological events in cells, such as cell cycle arrest. While SCFβ-TrCP1 has little effect on the cell cycle progression in those cells with Smad4 gene silencing, indicating the effects of SCFβ-TrCP1 are Smad4-dependent. Loss of Smad4 plays a pivotal role in TGF-β resistance in tumorigenesis and is associated with poor prognosis of cancer. Thus, the mechanism underlying the degradation of Smad4 demonstrated in this study may provide some useful information for further understanding the pathogenesis of cancer disease.

Recent studies have uncovered features of the reductase that are unrelated to its reductase activity; BVR has been characterized as a serine/threonine kinase (17Salim M. Brown B.A. Maines M.D. J.

The presence of a bZip motif, Leu129(×6)-Leu136(×6)-Lys143(×6)-Leu150(×6)-Leu157, which is preceded by a conserved basic domain, together with mutation analyses identified the sequence as a dimerization domain. The DNA-binding ability of the protein was confirmed by demonstrating its binding to the consensus sequence of AP-1 sites in the HO-1 promoter (19Ahmad Z. Salim M. Maines M.D. J. Biol.

Using coordinates for rat enzyme in the predicted three-dimensional structure of human reductase, the dimerization domain was found consistent with its ability to bind DNA. Collectively, these criteria were supportive of BVR being a member of the bZip DNA binding family of transcription factors.

HO-1 is among those genes whose expression can be up-regulated by activation of the MAPK pathway.

HO-1 stress response is mediated by AP-1 binding to multiple copies of consensus sequence TGACTCA (38Alam J. Zhining D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21894-21900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The AP-1 family of proteins forms homo- or heterodimers that include c-Jun/ATF-2 heterodimer, which binds to both AP-1 site and the CRE site (TGACNTCA). In addition to HO-1, AP-1 sites are found in many promoters of genes, including growth factors, chemokines, and cytokines. ATF-2 as a homodimer binds to CRE, whereas heterodimerization of ATF-2 with c-Jun increases its affinity for AP-1 by 4-fold (39Benbrook D.M. Jones N.C. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 295-302PubMed Google Scholar) over that of the c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimer with an increase in its association time with DNA (40Herr I. Van Dam H. Angel P. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 1105-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). HO-1 is also induced by cAMP and CRE activation (41Immenschuh S. Hinke V. Ohlmann A. Gifhorn-Katz S. Katz N. Jungermann K. Kietzmann T. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The structural and activity profiles of the reductase in vitro are consistent with its having a regulatory role in cellular functions, in an effort to further understand whether criteria ascribed to BVR does in fact have biological significance, the present study was undertaken to examine whether increased expression of BVR in the cell effects regulation of gene expression. In this study, we show that in cells infected with Ad-hBVR, induction of hBVR gene expression results in increased levels of ATF-2 and HO-1 mRNA and protein in the cell. The BVR amino acid sequence is highly conserved from humans to cyanobacteria, (4Fakhrai H. Maines M.D. J. Biol.

The evolutionarily conserved functional and structural features include the bZip motif, the kinase activity, and having dual pH/cofactor requirements (7Ennis O. Maytum R. Mantle T.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 44Huang T.J. Trakshel G.M. Maines M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7844-7849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, findings with human enzyme predictably may be also applicable to other mammalian species. The findings of the present study together with previous reports identify BVR as a novel regulator of ATF-2 and HO-1 expression and suggest that increased expression of BVR is potentially a useful approach to change the gene expression profile in the cell. Construction of Adenoviral Vector Expressing hBVR—Adenovirus recombinant DNAs with hBVR were constructed as follows. First, full-length biliverdin reductase cDNA was amplified from the clone obtained earlier in the laboratory (6Maines M.D. Polevoda B.V. Huang T.J. McCoubrey Jr., W.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 372-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) using primers 724BVR (5′-GTC ACG AGA TCT CGA TTA TTA GGA CGA TGA CGA TAA GAT GAA TGC AGA GCC CGA GAG GAA GTT TGG CG) and 725BVR (5′-GTC ACG TCT AGA TTA CTT CCT TGA ACA GCA ATA TTT CTG GAT TTC TGC). Primer 724BVR allows the introduction of FLAG (DYKDDDDK) coding sequence just upstream from ATG codon of hBVR cDNA. The resulting fragment was digested with BglII and XbaI restriction endonucleases and cloned between the appropriate sites of vector plasmid pEGFP-3C. The cDNA sequence of hBVR was verified by sequencing. For transformation, it was used dam- strain GM119 (kindly provided by S. Hattman, Department of Biology, University of Rochester), because the XbaI site in the resulting construct named pGFP-hBVR was protected by Dam methylation when maintained in non-modified bacterial recipient. The NheI-XbaI fragment of pGFP-hBVR containing the fusion EGFP-FLAG-hBVR was subcloned between the sites NheI-XbaI of intermediate vector pTRE-Shuttle2. The fact that NheI and XbaI restriction endonucleases produce identical cohesive ends allowed us to obtained constructs with two alternative orientations of the fragment: one under control of the tetracycline-regulated plasmid promoter PminCMV (pTRE-hBVR), the other in the opposite direction (pTRE-INV-hBVR). After thorough sequence analysis, both constructs were used for subcloning into tetracycline-responsive pAdeno-X vector according to the manufacturer's instructions. Recombinant DNAs named, correspondingly, Ad-hBVR and AD-INV-hBVR were purified from an XL1-Blue Gold-recipient bacterial strain and analyzed with restriction endonucleases and PCR using gene-specific primers and primers provided by Clontech to check orientation of the insert. Finally, Ad-hBVR and AD-INV-hBVR were introduced into HEK 293A cells using the LipofectAMINE 2000 protocol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The viruses were isolated from cell culture by using the AdenoPure (Puresyn, Malvern, PA) purification kit according to the supplier's recommendations. The viral titer was determined by A260 assay in accordance with the protocol of BD Biosciences Clontech. Cell Culture and Transfection of hBVR into 293A Cells—293A cell line (a human embryonal kidney cell line) was obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD). Cells (3 × 106 for RNA analysis and 1 × 106 for protein analysis) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% tetracycline-free fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-G/streptomycin for 18 h. Then, virus was added at a multiplicity of infection of 5 pfu/cell for Adeno-X Tet-On and 10 pfu/cell for two recombinant constructs. This ratio was found to be optimal for overexpression of hBVR. For some analyses, upon the addition of the virus, cells were collected and used as controls. For most experiments, 2 h after the addition of the virus, Dox was added at a concentration of 5 μg/ml. This time point was designated in figures as the 0 point. Samples were collected at time points indicated in figures. Northern Blot Analysis—RNA was extracted with an RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) from 293A line cells infected or non-infected with Ad-hBVR or Ad-INV-hBVR. RNA was separated by electrophoresis on denaturating formaldehyde gel and transferred onto Hybond membrane. The membrane were probed for hBVR (full-length hBVR cDNA (26Hoeffler J.P. Meyer T.E. Yun Y.

Probes were labeled using [α-32P]dCTP with the random primers labeling system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Pre-hybridization, hybridization, and autoradiography were performed as described previously (46Miralem T. Avraham H.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 579-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). cDNA Microarray Analysis—Total RNA (20 μg) extracted from 5 × 106 293A line cells infected with Ad-hBVR (10 pfu/cell) and Adeno-X Tet-On (5 pfu/cell) or Ad-INV-hBVR (10 pfu/cell) and Adeno-X Tet-On (5 pfu/cell) 24 h after induction with 5 μg/μl doxycycline (Dox) was used for cDNA microarray analysis by SuperArray (Frederick, MD). After cDNA synthesis and Biotin d-UTP labeling, the probes were hybridized with GEArray Q Series Human Signal Transduction PathwayFinder Gene Array HS-008 membrane containing cDNA fragments from 96 marker genes associated with 18 signal transduction pathways. Analysis of the arrays was performed with “AlphaEasy” software together with “AlphaImager™ 3400” system (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA) to convert signal intensity to a numeric number. All signal intensities were normalized to housekeeping genes β-actin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, cyclophilin A, and ribosomal protein L13α. Changes in genes expression were calculated as the ratio between intensities of signals after overexpressing wild type (Ad-hBVR) and inverted (Ad-INV-hBVR, control) adenoviral constructs during the microarray analysis giving a -fold increase/decrease: Ad-hBVR/Ad-INV-hBVR. Any value over 2-fold change was taken as a significant and is presented in Table II. Using the same criteria, any significantly suppressed gene was indicated as negative (-) -fold value.Table IIGenes identified by microarray analysis influenced by hBVR overexpression The values indicated in the table represent the ratio between intensities of the signal for genes in RNA isolated from cells transfected with wild type (Ad-hBVR) or with inverted (Ad-INV-hBVR).

Cell lysate was subjected to electrophoresis on 14% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Pall Corp., Ann Arbor, MI). BVR was detected using rabbit antihuman BVR polyclonal antibodies (3/500, v/v) as the primary antibody (5Maines M.D. Trakshel G.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and horse-radish-peroxidase labeled anti-rabbit IgG (1/5000, v/v, Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) as the secondary antibody. The hBVR protein was visualized by either 3,3′-diaminobenzidine staining according to manufacturer's instructions (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) or by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Biosciences). The FLAG tag was detected by monoclonal mouse anti-FLAG antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI) and visualized by 3,3′-diaminobenzidine staining. ATF-2 was detected by anti-ATF-2 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) and anti-phospho-ATF-2 (Thr69/71) polyclonal rabbit antibodies (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). Specific bands were visualized using the ECL system. For hBVR and FLAG tag fusion protein detection, 2 μl of induced cell lysate corresponding to 2.0 × 104 cells was used. In all other cases, 20- to 40-μl aliquots of cell extract were used. ELISA—HO-1 protein was measured by using an ELISA kit developed by Stressgen Bioreagents (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Measurement of BVR Activity—293A cells infected with Ad-hBVR or Ad-INV-hBVR were lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 75 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 1% Nonidet-P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, protease inhibitor mixture (1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm NaF, 1 mm NaVO4). Non-infected 293A cells were used as a negative control. Cell lysates were briefly sonicated and centrifuged. The hBVR activity was measured in the supernatant fraction at pH 6.7 as described previously (3Kutty R.K. Maines M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3956-3962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Benbrook D.M. Jones N.C. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 295-302PubMed Google Scholar, 41Immenschuh S. Hinke V. Ohlmann A. Gifhorn-Katz S.

The rate of reduction of biliverdin to bilirubin was determined as the increase in absorbance at 450 nm at 25 °C. Specific activity is expressed as nanomoles of bilirubin/min/mg of protein. In Vitro BVR Protein Translation, Nuclear Extraction, and Gel Mobility Shift Assay—Both in vitro translated BVR protein and nuclear extract from 293 cells transfected with Ad-hBVR were used in the gel shift assay experiments. In vitro BVR protein translation was performed using a TnT Quick Coupled Translation System from Promega (Madison, WI). Briefly, full-length hBVR cDNA was cloned into a pcDNA3 expression vector downstream from the T7 RNA polymerase promoter. 2.0 μg of recombinant plasmid DNA obtained was used for protein translation with TnT Quick Master Mix in a 50-μl reaction volume for 90 min at 30 °C. Nuclear extract was isolated from 293 cells transfected with Ad-BVR. 107 cells were harvested at time points 0, 6, and 24 h after induction of hBVR expression; cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed with hypotonic buffer. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 800 × g at 4 °C for 10 min and resuspended in 200 μl of buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 0.4 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm KCl, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. The nuclei were extracted on ice for 30 min and followed by 30-min centrifugation at 4 °C. Supernatant was then collected. The in vitro synthesized protein or nuclear extract were then analyzed in gel shift assay for their DNA-binding capability to a cAMP regulatory element (CRE) and an AP-1 consensus oligonucleotide (47Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar). The sequences of oligonucleotides used in the present study are listed in Table I. The oligonucleotides were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 kinase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For DNA binding assay, 3 μl of in vitro translated protein or nuclear extract was preincubated with 2 μl of binding buffer (20% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mm NaCl, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.25 mg/ml poly(dI: dC)) in 8 μl reaction volume for 10 min at room temperature. Then, 2 μl of labeled oligonucleotides were added, and samples were incubated for an additional 20 min at room temperature. The DNA-protein binding complexes were electrophoresed on a 6% non-denature polyacrylamide gel and processed for autoradiography. The unlabeled competitor DNA was used to determine the specificity of the binding. To identify proteins in the DNA-protein complexes, supershift experiments were performed with rabbit polyclonal anti-hBVR antibodies (45Shibahara S. Muller R. Taguchi H. Yoshida T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7865-7869Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). For positive control, ATF-2 protein was in vitro translated using a pcDNA3 plasmid containing a 762-bp ATF-2 cDNA sequence as template (generous gift from Hicham Drissi, University of Rochester). The translated ATF-2 protein was then used in the CRE binding reaction. Each experiment was repeated at least twice to ascertain the reproducibility of results.Table IOligonucleotide sequence used for gel shift assaysName of oligonucleotidesSequence of oligonucleotidesaOnly the upper strands of double-stranded fragments are given1× CRE5′-AGA GAT TGC CTG ACG TCA GAG AGC TAG-3′4× CRE5′-(AGC CTG ACG TCA GAG) x4-3′1× mut CRE5′-AGA GAT TGC CAT GGC ATC GAG AGC TAG-3′AP-1bThe DNA fragment with three potential AP-1 binding sites as predicated by Malinspector software.

However, the mechanism of regulation of the survivin expression remains unclear. In this study we investigated the expression and regulation of survivin in the nitric oxide (NO)-exposed human lung carcinoma cells. The lung carcinoma cell lines CL3, H1299, and A549 but not normal lung fibroblast expressed high levels of survivin proteins. NO donors S-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine (SNAP) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) decreased the survivin expression. SNAP (0.4 mm, 24h)and SNP (1 mm, 24 h) significantly induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in lung carcinoma cells. Furthermore, SNAP inhibited the cell growth and increased the fractions of G2/M phase. The levels of cyclin B1 and phospho-cdc2-(Thr-161) proteins were inhibited in the NO-exposed cells. The cdc25 phosphatase inhibitors (Cpd 5 and NSC 663284) and the cdc2 kinase inhibitors (alsterpaullone and purvalanol A) enhanced SNP-induced cytotoxicity and the decrease in survivin expression. However, overexpression of survivin by a pOTB7-survivin vector reduced SNP-induced cell growth inhibition and cytotoxicity. In addition, SNP activated the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase. The specific p38 MAP kinase inhibitor, SB202190, significantly decreased the cytotoxicity and increased the survivin levels in NO donor-treated and inducible NOS-transfected cells. Conversely, anticancer agents including quercetin, arsenite, and cisplatin but not genistein increased the levels of survivin protein. Our results indicated for the first time that NO inhibited the expression of survivin, which was down-regulated by the p38 MAP kinase pathway.

The survivin activity resulted from the phosphorylation of Thr-34 by the mitotic kinase complex cdc2-cyclin B1 (3Wall N.R. O'Connor D.S. Plescia J. Pommier Y. Altieri D.C.

Nitric oxide (NO) is an important signaling messenger that has been shown to play important roles in many physiological and pathological conditions (14Moncada S. Palmer R.M. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol.

Endogenous NO is generated from l-arginine by three major types of NO synthase (NOS), i.e. endothelial NOS), neural NOS, and inducible NOS (iNOS) (17Ignarro L.J. Buga G.M. Wood K.S. Byrns R.E.

In this study we investigated the expression and regulation of survivin in the NO-induced cell growth inhibition and apoptosis in the human lung cancer cells and its possible mechanisms. We further studied the role of p38 MAP kinase in the survivin expression on cell survival of the NO-exposed cells. Using NO donors or transfection of an iNOS expression vector, we found that the survivin expression in the lung carcinoma cells was down-regulated via the p38 MAP kinase pathway and may involve the inhibition of cdc2-cyclin B1 complex.

Yang of the National Tsing-Hua University. The TSGH8301 cell line was derived from a bladder cancer of a male patient in Taiwan, which was purchased from Food Industry Research and Development Institute (Hsinchu, Taiwan). The PC12 cell line, derived from rat adrenal pheochromocytoma cells (36Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4873) Google Scholar), was a gift of Dr. D. I. Yang of Tzu Chi University. These cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, l-glutamine (0.03%, w/v), sodium bicarbonate (2.2%, w/v), and 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator (310/Thermo, Forma Scientific, Inc., Marietta, OH). Cytotoxicity Assay—The cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well for 16–20 h. Then the cells were treated with 0–0.8 mm SNAP or 0–2 mm SNP for 24 h in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium. After drug treatment, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and were cultured in complete RPMI 1640 medium (containing 10% serum) for 2 days. Subsequently, the medium was replaced, and the cells were treated with 500 μg/ml 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) (Sigma) in complete RPMI 1640 medium for 4 h. The surviving cells converted MTT to formazan that generates a blue-purple color when dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) (37Plumb J.A. Milroy R. Kaye S.B. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4435-4440PubMed Google Scholar). The intensity was measured at 545 nm using a plate reader for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The absorbance of each treatment was from the average of six repeats (wells). The relative percentage of survival was calculated by dividing the absorbance of treatment by that of the control in each experiment. Apoptosis Assay—The adherent cells were cultured on coverslips. After exposure to SNAP (0.4 mm, 24 h), the cells were washed twice with isotonic PBS (pH 7.4). Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) binding assay kit (Strong Biotech, Taipei, Taiwan) was used for the examination of apoptosis. The cells were stained with annexin V-FITC in binding buffer containing propidium iodide for 30 min in the dark. Then the cells were washed three times with isotonic PBS (pH 7.4) and analyzed using fluorescence microscope. During the apoptotic process, the enrichment of mono- and oligonucleosomes in cytoplasm of the apoptotic cell is due to DNA degradation before plasma membrane breakdown (38Duke R.C. Cohen J.J. Lymphokine Res. 1986; 5: 289-299PubMed Google Scholar). The cell death detection ELISAplus kit (Roche Applied Science) was based on the quantitative sandwich enzyme-immunoassay using antibodies directed against DNA and histones. Exponentially growing cells were plated at a density of 1 × 105 cells/p60 dish for 16–20 h. Then the cells were treated with or without 20 μm cPTIO for 1 h before exposure to 0–2 mm SNP for 24 h in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium. After treatment, the cells were washed twice with PBS and cultured in complete RPMI 1640 medium for 2 days. The cells were then analyzed for apoptosis, determined by the amount of mono- and oligonucleosomes in the cytoplasmic fraction of cell lysates. The intensity was measured at 405 nm using a plate reader for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. NO Production Assay—NO production was detected by measuring the stable NO metabolite, nitrite, in cultured medium using a spectrophotometric method based on the Griess reaction (39Green L.C. Wagner D.A. Glogowski J. Skipper P.L. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 126: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (10881) Google Scholar). After exposure to SNAP or SNP, the 100-μl culture supernatant was mixed with 100 μlof Griess reagent (0.1% naphthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride, 1% sulfanilamide, and 1.25% H3PO4). After incubation for 5–10 min at room temperature, nitrite concentrations were measured at 550 nm using a plate reader for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Cell Cycle Analysis—Asynchronized-CL3 and -H1299 cells were plated at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells per 60-mm Petri dish in complete RPMI 1640 medium for 16–20 h. Then the cells were treated with 0–0.8 mm SNAP for 24 h in serum-free medium. To examine the synchronized cells, CL3 cells were grown to 80–90% confluence and re-cultured in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium for 48 h. The cells were trypsinized and plated at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells per 60-mm Petri dish in complete RPMI 1640 medium containing 1 μg/ml aphidicolin. After 24 h of aphidicolin treatment, the cells were washed twice with PBS and replaced with fresh RPMI medium. After incubation for 4 h, the cells were exposed to 0.4 mm SNAP for 2 h in serum-free medium. At the end of treatment, the cells were collected and fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol overnight at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the cell pellets were treated with 4 μg/ml propidium iodide solution containing 100 μg/ml RNase and 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min and placed at 4 °C before flow cytometry analysis. Samples were analyzed in a FACScalibur system (BD Biosciences) using CellQuest software. Cell Growth Assay—CL3 and H1299 cells were separately plated onto a p60 Petri dish at a density of 1 × 106 cells in complete RPMI 1640 medium for 18 h. Then the cells were treated with 0–0.8 mm SNAP for 24 h. At the end of the treatment, the cells were trypsinized, and the total cell number was counted. Mitotic Index Analysis—CL3 cells were plated at a density of 1 × 105 cells/p60 Petri dish for 16–20 h. Subsequently, the cells were treated with 0–0.8 mm SNAP for 24 h. After drug treatment, the cells were trypsinized and treated with hypotonic 0.05% KCl solution for 5–10 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was removed, and the cell pellet was fixed with methanol/acetic acid solution (3:1, v/v). The cell suspension was dropped onto a clean slide and stained with a 10% Giemsa solution (Sigma). A total of 200 cells were examined for the calculation of mitotic index in each treatment. Indirect Immunofluorescence Analysis—The cells were cultured on coverslip, which was kept in a 60-mm Petri dish for 16–20 h before treatment. After exposure to SNAP (0.4 mm, 24 h), the cells were washed twice with isotonic PBS (pH 7.4) and fixed in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde solution in PBS for overnight at 4 °C. The coverslips were washed three times with PBS, and nonspecific binding sites were blocked in PBS containing 10% normal goat serum, 0.25% Triton X-100 for 1 h. The cells were incubated with rabbit anti-survivin antibody (1:250) in PBS containing 0.25% Triton X-100 and 10% normal goat serum overnight at 4 °C and washed three times with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS. Then the cells were incubated with goat anti-rabbit Cy5™ (1:500) (Amersham Biosciences) in PBS containing 0.25% Triton X-100 and 10% normal goat serum for 3 h at 37 °C and washed 3 times with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS. The nuclei were stained with 2.5 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 (Sigma) for 10 min. Finally, the samples were stored in the dark at 4 °C until examined under a fluorescence microscope. The images were digitally processed for presentation by Adobe Photoshop software (Version 6.0), Adobe Systems (San Jose, CA). Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) Analysis—Cells were plated at a density of 1–2 × 106 cells per 60-mm Petri dish in culture medium. After treatment the cells were washed twice with PBS. Total cellular RNA was purified using RNA extraction kit (Geneaid, Taoyuan, Taiwan) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA concentrations were determined by spectrophotometry. cDNAs were synthesized by Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase with oligo(dT)15 primer (Promega, Madison, WI). Each reverse transcript was amplified with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as an internal control. The primer pairs used for amplification of survivin (40Ikeguchi M. Ueta T.

Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 3131-3136PubMed Google Scholar) were 5′-GGCATGGGTGCCCCGACGTTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CAGAGGCCTCAATCCATGGCA-3′ (antisense) and for GAPDH were 5′-CGGAGTCAACGGATTTGGTCGTAT-3′ (sense) and 5′-AGCCTTCTCCATGGTGGTGAAGAC-3′ (antisense). RT-PCR was performed by a DNA thermal cycler, 5331/Mastercycler gradient (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). The initial denaturation was performed at 95 °C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles at 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and finally 72 °C for 1 min. The PCR products were visualized on 2% agarose gels with ethidium bromide staining under UV transillumination, and photographs were taken (Ezcatcher EZC-2002, Medclub Scientific Co., Taipei, Taiwan). The amplification products of survivin and GAPDH were 439 and 306 bp, respectively. Western Blot Analysis—Western analyses of Bcl-2, cdc2, phospho-cdc2, cyclin B1, ERK-2, p38, phospho-p38, survivin, and XIAP were performed using specific antibodies. Cells were lysed in the ice-cold cell extraction buffer (pH 7.6) containing 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 75 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, and 0.1% Triton X-100. The protease inhibitors including 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 μg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride were added to the cell suspension. The cell extracts were gently rotated at 4 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation, the pellets were discarded, and supernatant protein concentrations were determined by the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Equal amounts of proteins (20–60 μg/well) were subjected to electrophoresis by 10–12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoretic transfer of proteins onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, they were sequentially hybridized with primary antibody and followed with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody (Bio-Rad). Finally, the protein bands were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). To verify equal protein loading and transfer, ERK-2 and p38 were used as the protein loading control. Transfection—The pOTB7-survivin expression vector was from IMAGE clone (ID 2961114) and was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, MGC-8592). The piNOSL8-CMV expression vector (41Xie Q.W. Cho H. Kashiwabara Y. Baum M. Weidner J.R. Elliston K. Mumford R. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28500-28505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the pcDNA3.1 control vector were kindly provided by Dr. D. I. Yang (Tzu Chi University). These plasmids were employed for transient transfections in CL3 cells. The vectors of pOTB7-survivin and piNOSL8-CMV expressed human survivin and mouse iNOS, respectively. CL3 cells (1 × 106 cells/p60 dish) were transfected with 3 μg of expression vector or control vector by using LipofectAMINE™ 2000 (Invitrogen) in 1.5 ml of serum-free DMEM medium for 5 h at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Then 1.5 ml of DMEM medium with 20% fetal bovine serum was added without removing the transfection mixture and incubation proceeded for an additional 24 h. After transient transfection, the cells were subjected to cell growth, Western blot analysis, or MTT assay as described above. Quantitative Analysis—The percentage of cell cycle phases was analysis by ModFit LT software (Version 2.0, BD Biosciences). Each experiment was repeated at least 3 times. For comparing the level of Western blot protein between samples, a densitometer (Molecular Dynamics, Personal Densitometer ST) was used for estimating the intensity of each band on the X-film. Each experiment was repeated at least 3 times. A gel digitizing software, Un-Scan-It gel (Version 5.1, Silk Scientific, Inc.), was used to quantify the intensity of each band on the gel from the RT-PCR products of samples. Each experiment was repeated 2–5 times. NO Mediates Cytotoxicity, Apoptosis, and Decreased Survivin Expression in the Lung Cancer Cells—As shown in Fig. 1A, SNAP and SNP significantly generated NO in both CL3 and H1299 human lung cancer cells. Concentrations of SNAP (0.4 and 0.8 mm) and SNP (1 and 2 mm) increased the NO production by 7–16-fold (Fig. 1A). To determine the involvement of NO in the regulation of cell survival, the cells were exposed to increased concentrations of SNAP (0–0.8 mm) or SNP (0–2 mm), and the percentage of cell survival was measured by MTT assay. As shown in Fig. 1B, SNAP induced cell death in a concentration-dependent manner, and ∼40, 55, and 65% of cells survived after exposure to 0.4 mm SNAP for 24 h in CL3, H1299, and A549 cells, respectively. Similarly, SNP concentration dependently induced cytotoxicity in these cell lines (Fig. 1B). We further assessed apoptosis from the cells that had been exposed to NO donors. SNAP-treated H1299 cells were heavily stained with annexin V-FITC (early apoptotic cells), which displayed a green color (Fig. 1C, lower right picture) and induced chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation (Fig. 2B), indicating these that cells were in the apoptotic stage. The late apoptotic or necrotic cells were stained with annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide, which displayed a yellow color (Fig. 1C, lower right picture). In contrast, the untreated cells did not stain with fluorochrome (Fig. 1C, upper right picture). In addition, apoptosis was measured using the cell death detection ELISAplus kit. As shown in Fig. 1D, the extent of apoptosis was concentration-dependently increased after exposure to 1–2 mm SNP for 24 h in CL3 cells. Pretreatment with an NO scavenger, cPTIO (42Akaike T.

https://openalex.org/W2165445607,"We present the first large scale proteomic analysis of a human cellular response to a pathogen. Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is an enteric human pathogen responsible for much childhood morbidity and mortality worldwide. EPEC uses a type III secretion system (TTSS) to inject bacterial proteins into the cytosol of intestinal epithelial cells, resulting in diarrhea. We analyzed the host response to TTSS-delivered EPEC effector proteins by infecting polarized intestinal epithelial monolayers with either wild-type or TTSS-deficient EPEC. Host proteins were isolated and subjected to quantitative profiling using isotope-coded affinity tagging (ICAT) combined with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. We identified over 2000 unique proteins from infected Caco-2 monolayers, of which ∼13% are expressed differentially in the presence of TTSS-delivered EPEC effector proteins. We validated these data in silico and through immunoblotting and immunofluorescence microscopy. The identified changes extend cytoskeletal observations made in less relevant cell types and generate testable hypotheses with regard to host proteins potentially involved in EPEC-induced diarrhea. These data provide a framework for future biochemical analyses of host-pathogen interactions. We present the first large scale proteomic analysis of a human cellular response to a pathogen.

EPEC binds to intestinal epithelial cells, forming a characteristic lesion (attaching/effacing (A/E)) resulting from localized microvilli destruction and the formation of an underlying pedestal-like projection composed of epithelial-derived cytoskeletal components (1Donnenberg M.S. Kaper J.B. Finlay B.B. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 109-114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Bacteria remain adherent on these cup-like projections, rarely penetrating the intestinal barrier. The bacterial factors responsible for the formation of attaching/effacing lesions and diarrheal disease are produced and regulated by a pathogenicity island described as the locus of enterocyte effacement (2Elliott S.J. Wainwright L.A. McDaniel T.K. Jarvis K.G. Deng Y.K. Lai L.-C. McNamara B.P. Donnenberg M.S. Kaper J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). The locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) encodes a Type III secretion system (TTSS), a cellular receptor, numerous secreted/translocated proteins, and over 20 open reading frames of unknown function. The TTSS is a molecular syringe that directs the active transport of proteins from the bacterial cytoplasm across the inner and outer bacterial membranes, directly into the cytoplasm of an associated eukaryotic cell (3Hueck C.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 379-433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TTSSs are widely conserved among a diverse array of animal and plant pathogens and critical for their virulence. Of major interest is the TTSS-specific response of human intestinal epithelial cells to EPEC infection. Previous research has focused primarily on morphological changes to the host as inferred from immunostaining. Particular interest has developed in the elucidation of host components contributing to pedestal formation. Transcriptional profiling of the host has been attempted, although not yet in a relevant cell type (4de Grado M. Rosenberger C.M. Gauthier A. Vallance B.A. Finlay B.B. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 6217-6224Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A fundamental understanding of how the intestinal epithelial proteome is altered by this pathogen and its TTSS effector proteins is needed, as few host pathways have been examined. We therefore undertook a quantitative analysis of the proteome of polarized Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells infected with either wild-type or TTSS-deficient EPEC. Microcapillary liquid chromatography combined with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI μLC-MS/MS) identifies proteins from mixtures without prior electrophoretic separation. Labeling of protein lysates prior to μLC-MS/MS with isotope-coded affinity tags (ICAT) specific to sulfhydryl groups greatly reduces sample complexity, allows detection of low abundance proteins, and aids in quantification of relative protein abundance between samples (5Gygi S.P. Rist B. Gerber S.A. Turecek F. Gelb M.H. Aebersold R. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 994-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (4350) Google Scholar). We employed ICAT technology to both identify and quantify TTSS-dependent alterations to host protein expression, performed in silico validation, and further confirmed our results through immunoblotting and immunofluorescence microscopy. We discuss the predominant functional categories of differentially regulated proteins and their implications to the future study of EPEC-host interactions and present novel testable hypotheses about newly identified host proteins and their potential role in diarrhea. Bacterial Strains—The bacterial strains used in this study were wild-type EPEC E2348/69 (6Levine M.M. Bergquist E.J. Nalin D.R. Waterman D.H. Hornick R.B. Young C.R. Sotman S. Lancet. 1978; 1: 1119-1122Abstract PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar) and EPEC E2348/69ΔescN (7Gauthier A. Puente J.L. Finlay B.B. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 3310-3319Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—Human Caco-2 cells (8Rousset M. Biochimie (Paris). 1986; 68: 1035-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) were grown at 37 °C, 5% CO2, in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% decomplemented fetal calf serum, and 1% non-essential amino acids. Cells were cultured in 24-mm diameter polyester Transwell plates (Costar) for at least 21 days prior to infection. Infections and Protein Preparation—Bacterial cultures grown overnight were subcultured 1:50 into Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and grown for 3 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2, without shaking. Bacteria were applied to Caco-2 cells for 4 h at a multiplicity of infection of 50:1. Following infection, the media was aspirated and cells were washed 8 times with PBS. Cells were lysed in 500 μl of 1% Triton X-100 in PBS and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was transferred to 5 volumes of cold acetone, precipitated, and resuspended in 0.1% SDS, 6 m urea. ICAT Labeling and Analysis—Caco-2 lysates were labeled as described in the Supplementary Materials. SEQUEST™ (Thermo Finnigan) was used to sequence the peptides and XPRESS (9Han D.K. Eng J. Zhou H. Aebersold R. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 946-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar) software was used to perform relative quantitation between light and heavy ICAT-tagged peptides. PeptideProphet™ (10Keller A. Nesvizhskii A.I. Kolker E. Aebersold R. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 5383-5392Crossref PubMed Scopus (3897) Google Scholar) was used to verify correctness of peptide assignments. Western Blot Analysis—Samples for Western blot analysis were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed as described in Ref. 7Gauthier A. Puente J.L. Finlay B.B. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 3310-3319Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar. The following antibodies were utilized at a dilution of 1:1000: calpain-5 (BD Biosciences), caspase-7 (New England Biolabs), dynactin (BD Biosciences), dynamin (BD Biosciences), espin (BD Biosciences), integrin-linked protein kinase (New England Biolabs), Nod2 (Immunologicalsdirect.com), Rac1 (New England Biolabs), and talin (Sigma). Immunofluorescence—HeLa cells were grown on glass coverslips in 24-well tissue culture plates and infected for 4 h with 5.0 μl of bacterial overnight culture. After infection, cells were washed 3 times in PBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+ and fixed in 2.5% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were permeabilized in 0.1% saponin in PBS, blocked in 5% goat serum in PBS + 0.1% saponin, and incubated with the following primary antibodies diluted 1:1000 in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature: integrin-linked protein kinase, talin, and calpain-5. We utilized the mammalian Caco-2 cell culture line as a model for EPEC pathogenesis in the small bowel. Caco-2 cells provide an ideal infection model, as they are derived from the human intestine, able to polarize, develop microvilli, form tight junctions, and are infected by EPEC (11Canil C. Rosenshine I. Ruschkowski S. Donnenberg M.S. Kaper J.B. Finlay B.B. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 2755-2762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To study host responses specific to the EPEC TTSS, we compared the effect of a well characterized wild-type strain (E2348/69; wt) to a strain deficient in the TTSS (E2348/69ΔescN; N-). Caco-2 lysates prepared after 4 h infection were differentially ICAT labeled (Fig. 1 and supporting text), and analyzed by microcapillary high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (μLC-MS/MS) (9Han D.K. Eng J. Zhou H. Aebersold R. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 946-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Relative protein abundance was determined by the ratio of signal intensities of peptide pairs using the XPRESS software tool (9Han D.K. Eng J. Zhou H. Aebersold R. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 946-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). The sequence identity of the proteins in the sample was determined by correlating collision-induced dissociation mass spectra with the NCBI protein data base using the SEQUEST algorithm (12Eng J. McCormack A.L. Yates J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass. Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5443) Google Scholar). 2,090 proteins were identified from 10,921 tandem mass spectra of peptides matched to peptide sequences in a data base using SEQUEST (see Supplementary Materials Fig. S1 for the complete dataset). 264 proteins with an annotated biological function (∼13%) displayed at least 2-fold expression differences between wt- and N--infected cells (Table I). Approximately equal numbers of proteins were up- versus down-regulated. We used the bioinformatics tool GoMiner (13Zeeberg B.R. Feng W. Wang G. Wang M.D. Fojo A.T. Sunshine M. Narasimhan S. Kane D.W. Reinhold W.C. Lababidi S. Bussey K.J. Riss J. Barrett J.C. Weinstein J.N. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: R28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to classify the differentially regulated Caco-2 proteins into functional categories based on the functional annotations assigned to these proteins (14Ashburner M.

Indeed, the major functional categories contributing most to the total of differentially regulated proteins are those involved in the cytoskeleton, cell adhesion, and G-protein signaling (Fig. 2). Proteins involved in ion transport and ion channel function were over-represented in the set of up-regulated proteins, potentially contributing to diarrhea. We validated in silico our results by searching all differentially expressed proteins against all previous publications in bacterial pathogenesis. The subset of the proteins previously implicated in bacterial pathogenesis and likely to be involved in host-EPEC interplay is bolded in Table II and discussed in detail below. The most striking change in the host epithelial cell during EPEC infection is the formation of actin-rich pedestals, upon which EPEC attaches. The primary components of the EPEC pedestal have been characterized with immunofluoresence microscopy (15Goosney D.L. DeVinney R. Finlay B.B. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 3315-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We identified 12 of the 20 proteins catalogued, 11 (92%) of which are up-regulated in a TTSS-dependent manner, detected the differential expression of an integrin-linked kinase (see below), and also confirmed increased expression of the host tyrosine kinase potentially responsible for Tir phosphorylation (16Swimm A. Bommarius B. Reeves P. Bornmann W. Kalman D. 43rd Meeting of The American Society for Cell Biology, December 13–17. San Francisco, CA, 2003Google Scholar) Protein identification, abundance analysis, and validation are performed by searching each MS/MS spectrum against a data base of human protein sequences using SEQUEST. Supplementary Materials Fig. 2A displays MS/MS data derived from the fragmentation of a peptide ion unique to the cysteine protease calpain-5. Calpain-5 is instrumental for brush border effacement during EPEC pathogenesis and recruits ezrin to the brush border (17Potter D.A. Srirangam A. Fiacco K. Brocks D. Hawes J. Herndon C. Maki M. Acheson D. Herman I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30403-30412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Confidence assignments were made in PeptideProphet™ based on how closely the observed mass spectra matched the theoretical fragmentation profile (18Von Haller P.D. Yi E. Donohoe S. Vaughn K. Keller A. Nesvizhskii A.I. Eng J. Li X.J. Goodlett D.R. Aebersold R. Watts J.D. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2003; 2: 428-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). XPRESS software then separates the single-ion current profile of the d0- and d9-labeled peptides and calculates a peptide relative abundance ratio based on integrated peak areas. For calpain-5, the abundance ratio was 4.6 (wt:N-; Supplemental Materials Fig. 2B). To assess the correspondence of these data with independent assays of protein abundance, we performed Western blot analysis of numerous host proteins for which we detected TTSS-dependent differential expression (Fig. 3). Caco-2 monolayers were infected with either wt or N- for 2–6 h and subjected to immunoblotting. Calpain-5 expression increased significantly between 2 and 4 h in cells infected with wt, whereas expression remained low in cells infected with N- (Fig. 3A). The relative difference in expression was estimated to be 6–8-fold, similar to the abundance ratio derived from ICAT analysis. We also examined the expression profile of ADAMTS-1, a metalloproteinase involved in proteoglycan degradation (19Kuno K. Okada Y. Kawashima H. Nakamura H. Miyasaka M. Ohno H. Matsushima K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 4: 241-245Crossref Scopus (235) Google Scholar). ADAMTS-1 expression was not detected in wt cells by immunoblotting, but was strongly expressed in N--infected cells (Fig. 3B). We extended this comparative analysis to a larger subset of TTSS-dependent differentially expressed proteins using cell lysates prepared from independent infections. We analyzed the expression of nine different proteins and plotted ICAT abundance ratios versus expression ratios computed from Western blotting (Fig. 3C). Significant correlation was observed between the two assays (r2 = 0.80). Similar results were observed with immunofluorescence microscopy (discussed below) and in previous ICAT experiments (20Ranish J.A. Yi E.C. Leslie D.M. Purvine S.O. Goodlett D.R. Eng J. Aebersold R. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). We also used immunofluorescence microscopy to visualize the expression of Caco-2 proteins measured by ICAT to be differentially regulated during infection. HeLa cells were infected with either wt or N-, fixed, and stained against calpain-5, integrin-linked kinase (ILK), and talin (Supplementary Materials Fig. 3). After staining, exposure under identical conditions revealed that, as expected, calpain-5 expression was increased in wt-relative to N--infected cells. Surprisingly, we observed co-localization of ILK with actin (middle row), implicating this important signaling molecule as part of the EPEC pedestal. We also observed the expected increased expression and co-localization of talin with actin pedestals (bottom row). We present the first proteomic analysis of the TTSS-specific human response to a pathogen. We used ICAT labeling technology to examine changes in the host proteome in response to wt- and TTSS-deficient EPEC and experimentally verified key findings with more classical analyses. The use of ICAT to compare mammalian proteomes has several advantages over classical two-dimensional gel analyses (5Gygi S.P. Rist B. Gerber S.A. Turecek F. Gelb M.H. Aebersold R. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 994-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (4350) Google Scholar). Biotinylated cysteine-containing peptides are selectively isolated for mass spectrometry, greatly reducing sample complexity. Two-dimensional gels are limited to analysis of high abundance, dye-reactive amounts of protein, whereas ICAT is suitable for lower abundance analysis. ICAT has a larger dynamic range and the two isotope labels serve as mutual internal standards for quantitation. However, the small fraction of proteins lacking cysteine is transparent to analysis and only relative changes in protein abundance are interrogated; aspects of protein regulation such as post-translational modification, trafficking, and protein-protein interactions are assessed through additional experimentation. Several aspects of EPEC-host cell interactions that both validate our findings and implicate new host proteins in induced cytoskeletal rearrangement, ion transport, and innate immunity are discussed. EPEC Pedestal—Tir, a TTSS-translocated protein, initiates pedestal formation by binding the Nck adaptor protein. N-WASP is recruited, which then binds Arp2/3, resulting in de novo actin polymerization (21Gruenheid S. DeVinney R. Bladt F. Goosney D. Gelkop S. Gish G.D. Pawson T. Finlay B.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 856-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). We identified 12 of the 20 known pedestal components (15Goosney D.L. DeVinney R. Finlay B.B. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 3315-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). It is striking that 92% of identified pedestal proteins are expressed more highly in wt- versus N--infected cells, underscoring the importance of TTSS-encoded effector proteins in establishing a cytoskeletal framework for EPEC. The cytoskeletal protein talin couples integrins to F-actin, and also binds vinculin, a protein implicated in the negative regulation of cell motility. The attachment of Shigella flexneri to Chinese hamster ovary cells (22Watarai M. Kamata Y. Kozaki S. Sasakawa C. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) elicits localized accumulation of talin, and the Yersinia enterocolitica invasin protein modulates reorganization of talin (23Young V.B. Falkow S. Schoolnik G.K. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 197-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In our experiments, talin expression was strongly up-regulated in wt-infected cells, and was recruited to EPEC pedestals (Supplemental Materials Fig. 3). Cofilin and gelsolin are actin-severing components of the EPEC pedestal that were overexpressed in wt-infected cells. Cofilin has been implicated in phagocytosis (24Bierne H. Gouin E. Roux P. Caroni P. Yin H.L. Cossart P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and both interact with and enhance the activity of the Na+,K+-ATPase, providing a link between the cytoskeleton and ion transporter activity (25Lee K. Jung J. Kim M. Guidotti G. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The increased abundance of actin depolymerizing agents in the pedestal suggests a complex molecular warfare between the host and a TTSS-effector protein capable of inactivating these potent depolymerizing activities. We detected numerous other actin-binding proteins not previously implicated in EPEC pedestals whose expression was regulated in a TTSS-dependent manner (Table II). Notably, the expression of the integrin-linked kinase 2 (ILK2) was localized to pedestals, but down-regulated in wt-infected cells (Table II and Supplemental Materials Fig. 3). ILK is a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent regulator of integrin-mediated cell adhesion and has recently been implicated in tumor angiogenesis (26Tan C. Cruet-Hennequart S. Troussard A. Fazli L. Costello P. Sutton K. Wheeler J. Gleave M. Sanghera J. Dedhar S. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 79-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The host tyrosine kinase that EPEC recruits in actin pedestal formation has recently been suggested (16Swimm A. Bommarius B. Reeves P. Bornmann W. Kalman D. 43rd Meeting of The American Society for Cell Biology, December 13–17. San Francisco, CA, 2003Google Scholar). It is of note that this kinase, c-Abl, was overexpressed in wt-infected cells. Ion Transport/Diarrhea—The molecular mechanism(s) by which EPEC induces diarrhea are unknown, although several are proposed. Microvilli effacement may reduce nutrient absorption, but cannot explain the rapid kinetics of diarrheal onset (27Donnenberg M.S. Tacket C.O. James S.P. Losonsky G. Nataro J.P. Wasserman S.S. Kaper J.B. Levine M.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 92: 1117-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). We found that calpain-5, a host protease involved in brush border effacement (17Potter D.A. Srirangam A. Fiacco K. Brocks D. Hawes J. Herndon C. Maki M. Acheson D. Herman I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30403-30412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), was strongly up-regulated (Supplemental Materials Figs. 2 and 3), whereas the brush border dipeptidylpeptidase IV (28Peiffer I. Bernet-Camard M.F. Rousset M. Servin A.L. Cell Microbiol. 2001; 3: 341-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) was down-regulated. Sequestration of tight junctional proteins (e.g. ezrin) to the pedestal may contribute to the disruption of tight junction integrity and decrease in transepithelial resistance (29Gruenheid S. Finlay B.B. Nature. 2003; 422: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Host cells infected with EPEC release nucleotide mediators capable of triggering chloride secretion from neighboring cells through interaction with purinergic receptors (30Crane J.K. Oh J.S. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3277-3285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nucleotide release is not because of apoptosis and is TTSS-dependent, probably because of the effector protein EspF (31Hecht G. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G1-G7Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized that host nucleotide biosynthesis and degradation pathways would therefore be differentially expressed in a TTSS-dependent manner during wt infection. but were unable to find significant difference between wt- and N--infected cells. Other studies have proposed a greater dependence of EPEC-induced diarrhea upon HCO3− secretion (32Hecht G. Koutsouris A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G781-GG88PubMed Google Scholar), and have also implicated calcium fluxes (33Baldwin T.J. Ward W. Aitken A. Knutton S. Williams P.H. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 1599-1604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We detected large increases in expression of both the bile salt export pump (34Hojo M. Sano N. Takikawa H. J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2003; 18: 815-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and calcium-activated chloride channels implicated in regulation of mucin (35Bertrand C.A. Danahay H. Poll C.T. Laboisse C. Hopfer U. Bridges R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C247-C255Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The Nedd4 binding protein 1 was up-regulated by a TTSS-dependent factor. Nedd4 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase important to the targeting of the epithelial sodium channels for endocytosis and degradation (36Gormley K. Dong Y. Sagnella G.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The epithelial sodium channel regulates salt and fluid homeostasis and interacts with the WW domains of Nedd4 (37Henry P.C. Kanelis V. O'Brien M.C. Kim B. Gautschi I. Forman-Kay J. Schild L. Rotin D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20019-20028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Grb10, an adaptor protein known to associate with Nedd4 and sodium channels, was also up-regulated at both the transcriptional (38Coombes B.K. Hardwidge P.R. Finlay B.B. Adv. Appl. Microbiol. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) and translational level. Thus, the proteasome-mediated degradation of specific ion transporters potentially contributes to EPEC-induced diarrhea. The plasma membrane calcium-transporting ATPase was down-regulated by a TTSS-encoded factor. Bovine ileal loop experiments with Salmonella typhimurium have suggested that plasma membrane calcium-transporting ATPase down-regulation contributes to inflammation and diarrhea (39Santos R.L. Schoffelmeer J.A. Tsolis R.M. Gutierrez-Pabello J.A. Baumler A.J. Adams L.G. J. Infect. Dis. 2002; 186: 372-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). G-protein Signaling—G-proteins play critical roles in cell signaling and cytoskeletal rearrangement and were over-represented in our dataset of TTSS-regulated host responses. Rho GTPases regulate actin structure, primarily at sites of membrane ruffling. EspH induces Cdc42-dependent filopodia formation (40Tu X. Nisan I. Yona C. Hanski E. Rosenshine I. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 595-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and the mitochondrial targeted effector, Map, has also been implicated in Cdc42-dependent processes (41Jepson M.A. Pellegrin S. Peto L. Banbury D.N. Leard A.D. Mellor H. Kenny B. Cell Microbiol. 2003; 5: 773-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, agents that inhibit Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 do not block pedestal formation (42Ben-Ami G. Ozeri V. Hanski E. Hofmann F. Aktories K. Hahn K.M. Bokoch G.M. Rosenshine I. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1755-1758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, other GTPases that have yet to be identified are likely important to EPEC pathogenesis. We identified numerous G proteins differentially regulated by TTSS-dependent factors that have not previously been implicated in bacterial pathogenesis. Fgd1 was observed only in cells infected with wt, and encodes a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that activates Cdc42, a Rho GTPase that controls the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. Fgd1 also interacts directly with cortactin, a protein essential to pedestal formation. Abnormal Fgd1 localization results in actin cytoskeletal abnormalities and significant changes in cell shape and viability (43Hou P. Estrada L. Kinley A.W. Parsons J.T. Vojtek A.B. Gorski J.L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 1981-1993Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). TC10, a down-regulated Rho GTPase, is involved in regulating the insulin-stimulated translocation of the glucose transporter GLUT4 (44Kanzaki M. Watson R.T. Hou J.C. Stamnes M. Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2334-2346Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). TC10 is also able to disrupt cortical actin and regulates actin polymerization on membrane transport vesicles. Innate Immunity—We discovered that a large number of proteins important to innate immune function are differentially regulated by TTSS-dependent factors. In cultured epithelial cells, EPEC activates NF-κB independent lipopolysaccharide stimulation (45Savkovic S.D. Koutsouris A. Hecht G. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1160-C1167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This factor then stimulates the transcription of interleukin-8, to recruit polymorphonuclear leukocytes to the site of infection. Microarray analysis of EPEC-infected HeLa cells demonstrated induction of the Egr-1 transcription factor, involved in mitogen-activated protein kinase activation (4de Grado M. Rosenberger C.M. Gauthier A. Vallance B.A. Finlay B.B. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 6217-6224Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, few other studies have examined TTSS-dependent stimulation of innate immunity during EPEC infection. Collectin and ficolin expression were strongly up-regulated. Collectins recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (46Holmskov U. Thiel S. Jensenius J.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 547-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar) and assist in bacterial killing through complement activation and phagocytosis. Ficolins have affinity for N-acetylglucosamine, act as opsonins, and activate complement via the lectin pathway (47Matsushita M. Fujita T. Immunol. Rev. 2001; 180: 78-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that EPEC effectors modulate the innate immune response by down-regulating expression of host proteins involved in bacterial recognition. Accordingly, we observed that Nod2 is down-regulated during wt infection. Nod2 regulates inflammatory responses (48Inohara N. Nunez G. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar) through recognition of the muramyl dipeptide of bacterial peptidoglycan (49Girardin S.E. Boneca I.G. Viala J. Chamaillard M. Labigne A. Thomas G. Philpott D.J. Sansonetti P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8869-8872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1915) Google Scholar). Transfection of a Nod2 expression plasmid into Caco-2 cells reduces the number of viable internalized S. typhimurium, suggesting an additional role for Nod2 as an antibacterial factor (50Hisamatsu T. Suzuki M. Reinecker H.C. Nadeau W.J. McCormick B.A. Podolsky D.K. Gastroenterology. 2003; 124: 993-1000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 51Yi E.C. Lee H. Aebersold R. Goodlett D.R. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2003; 17: 2093-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that a TTSS-delivered EPEC effector may modulate the expression of this important innate immunity protein. Our proteomic analysis of the Caco-2 host response to TTSS-encoded EPEC effectors has generated novel testable hypotheses about how this enteric human pathogen causes disease. The use of quantitative mass spectrometry obviates the need for cell fractionation and increases greatly the number of proteins that can be interrogated. Our results correspond closely with more traditional analyses of protein expression, as well as previous studies of the host response to enteric pathogens. It is important to emphasize that our experiments define expression ratios in cells infected with TTSS-competent versus -deficient EPEC strains. Direct quantitative comparison of host protein expression between infection conditions controls for nonspecific epithelial interactions with bacteria (e.g. lipopolysaccharide detection), although differences in adhesion and infection kinetics may contribute to a subset of the identified epithelial responses. Post-translational regulation of protein function must also be evaluated through other means. ICAT will facilitate comparison of the host response among both diverse pathogens and specific bacterial effector molecules. We are currently conducting RNA interference experiments to assess the importance of the differentially regulated Caco-2 proteins to EPEC pathogenesis. We thank J. Guttman, L. James Maher, and Gary Pielak for insightful comments. Download .pdf (.43 MB) Help with pdf files"
https://openalex.org/W2038986538,"The protein kinase Akt mediates several metabolic and mitogenic effects of insulin, whereas activation of protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms has been implicated in the inhibition of insulin action. We have previously shown that both PKCθ and PKCϵ are activated in skeletal muscle of insulin-resistant high fat-fed rats, and to identify potential substrates for these kinases, we incubated recombinant PKC isoforms with rat muscle fractions in vitro. PKCθ specifically phosphorylated a 48-kDa protein that was subsequently identified by mass spectrometry as Ndrg2. Ndrg2 is highly related to N-Myc downstream-regulated protein 1, which has been linked to stress responses, cell proliferation, and differentiation, although Ndrg2 itself is not repressed by N-Myc. Ndrg2 contains several potential phosphorylation sites, including three Akt consensus sequences. Ndrg2 phosphorylation was enhanced in [32P]orthophosphate-labeled C2C12 muscle cells co-overexpressing either PKCθ or Akt. Phosphorylation of Ndrg2 was examined further using a phospho (Ser/Thr) Akt substrate antibody. Insulin increased Ndrg2 phosphorylation in C2C12 cells in a wortmannin- and palmitate-inhibitable manner, whereas rapamycin, PD98059, and bisindoylmaleimide I had no effect, supporting a direct role for Akt. Mutation of Ndrg2 indicated that Thr-348 is the major phosphorylation site detected by the antibody and that Akt stimulates phosphorylation of this site, whereas PKCθ phosphorylates Ser-332. PKCθ overexpression, however, diminished the effect of insulin on Thr-348 phosphorylation without reducing Akt activation, suggesting that this is mediated through phosphorylation of Ndrg2 at Ser-332. Our data identify Ndrg2 as a novel insulin-dependent phosphoprotein and suggest that PKCθ may inhibit insulin action in part by reducing its phosphorylation by Akt.

Three groups of PKC have been established: the cPKCs α, β, and γ, which are activated by calcium and DAG; the nPKCs, e.g. δ, ϵ, and θ, which require DAG; and the aPKCs, ζ and ι/λ, which are independent of both calcium and DAG (1Mellor H. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 281-292Google Scholar). The essential role of specific binding partners such as the RACKS and A-kinase anchoring proteins in the spatial co-ordination of PKC isoforms is also becoming apparent (2Jaken S. Parker P.J. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 245-254Google Scholar). Similarly, a number of substrates, which are directly phosphorylated by PKCs in particular cell types and which mediate PKC effects on cellular regulation, is emerging. Specific PKC isoforms have been implicated in the inhibition of insulin action. Insulin resistance of target tissues such as skeletal muscle is a major contributing factor to the development of type 2 diabetes, and activation of nPKCs, including PKCθ, have been correlated with insulin resistance in a number of studies, especially in association with increased lipid availability (3Schmitz-Peiffer C. Browne C.L. Oakes N.D. Watkinson A. Chisholm D.J. Kraegen E.W. Biden T.J. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 169-178Google Scholar, 4Schmitz-Peiffer C. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 583-594Google Scholar). The mechanisms involved, however, including the targets for PKC-mediated phosphorylation, remain unclear. PKCs could interfere at one or more steps in insulin signal transduction, and the possibility that they may mediate increased Ser/Thr phosphorylation of IRS-1 is currently receiving much attention. IRS-1 is a docking protein that is a substrate for the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase: Tyr phosphorylation of the protein promotes recruitment of PI3K and subsequent activation of downstream components of the insulin signaling cascade, including Akt and aPKC, which in part mediate the metabolic actions of the hormone. Ser/Thr phosphorylation of IRS-1 at specific sites inhibits its subsequent insulin-stimulated Tyr phosphorylation and PI3K recruitment and promotes IRS-1 degradation (5Zick Y. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 437-441Google Scholar, 6Schmitz-Peiffer C. Whitehead J.P. IUBMB Life. 2003; 55: 367-374Google Scholar). It is possible, however, that chronic activation of specific PKC isoforms also leads to phosphorylation of more distal components of insulin signaling to induce insulin resistance. Ndrg1–4 (which comprises the family of proteins homologous to N-Myc downstream-regulated protein 1) have been implicated in stress responses and in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. Ndrg1 (also called Drg1/Cap43/rit42/TDD5/Ndr1), which is the most widely expressed and best characterized member, is mutated in hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy-Lom, a form of Charcot-Marie Tooth disease (7Kalaydjieva L. Gresham D. Gooding R. Heather L. Baas F. de Jonge R. Blechschmidt K. Angelicheva D. Chandler D. Worsley P. Rosenthal A. King R.H. Thomas P.K. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 67: 47-58Google Scholar). The expression of Ndrg1 is inhibited by N-Myc (8Shimono A. Okuda T. Kondoh H. Mech. Dev. 1999; 83: 39-52Google Scholar), and the protein is repressed in transformed cells and up-regulated in growth-arrested differentiating cells (9Kurdistani S.K. Arizti P. Reimer C.L. Sugrue M.M. Aaronson S.A. Lee S.W. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4439-4444Google Scholar). Although Ndrg2 is in fact N-Myc-independent (10Okuda T. Kondoh H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 208-215Google Scholar), it also appears to inhibit cell proliferation (11Deng Y. Yao L. Chau L. Ng S.S. Peng Y. Liu X. Au W.S. Wang J. Li F. Ji S. Han H. Nie X. Li Q. Kung H.F. Leung S.Y. Lin M.C. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 106: 342-347Google Scholar) and promote differentiation (12Choi S.C. Kim K.D. Kim J.T. Kim J.W. Yoon D.Y. Choe Y.K. Chang Y.S. Paik S.G. Lim J.S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 553: 413-418Google Scholar). Ndrg2 is highly expressed in skeletal muscle and brain, Ndrg3 is highly expressed in brain and testes, and Ndrg4 is specifically expressed in brain and heart (13Qu X.H. Zhai Y. Wei H.D. Zhang C.G. Xing G.C. Yu Y.T. He F.C. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 229: 35-44Google Scholar). Ndrg2 cDNAs, corresponding to four different isoforms (Ndrg2a1, Ndrg2a2, Ndrg2b1, and Ndrg2a2), have been isolated from rat renal tissue, differing in their 5′-untranslated and N-terminal coding regions (14Boulkroun S. Fay M. Zennaro M.C. Escoubet B. Jaisser F. Blot-Chabaud M. Farman N. Courtois-Coutry N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31506-31515Google Scholar). The significance of these isoforms of rat Ndrg2 is unknown, and only one form of the gene has been described in mice (10Okuda T. Kondoh H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 208-215Google Scholar) and humans (11Deng Y. Yao L. Chau L. Ng S.S. Peng Y. Liu X. Au W.S. Wang J. Li F. Ji S. Han H. Nie X. Li Q. Kung H.F. Leung S.Y. Lin M.C. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 106: 342-347Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ndrg proteins has been little studied, although protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation of Ndrg1 has been described previously (15Agarwala K.L. Kokame K. Kato H. Miyata T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 641-647Google Scholar). In this study, we initially examined the phosphorylation of skeletal muscle proteins by individual recombinant PKC isoforms in vitro. PKCθ, but not PKCϵ, was found to phosphorylate a 48-kDa protein, which was subsequently identified as Ndrg2. Because Ndrg2 possesses three Akt consensus phosphorylation sites, we examined its phosphorylation by both PKCθ and Akt in intact C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. Ndrg2 was found to be phosphorylated by Akt in response to insulin stimulation, and this was inhibited in the presence of PKCθ activity. Our data therefore indicate that Ndrg2 is a novel target for Akt and may represent a site for PKC-mediated inhibition of insulin signal transduction.

Preparation of Crude Muscle Fractions—Solubilized membrane fractions were prepared from red quadriceps muscle of male Wistar rats. Muscles (5 g) were homogenized in 20 ml of ice-cold buffer A (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 4% (v/v) glycerol, 250 mm mannitol, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm PMSF, 200 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm benzamidine) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min. This and all subsequent purification procedures were carried out at 4 °C. The supernatant was retained as the cytosolic fraction. The pellet was washed by resuspension with buffer A and recentrifuged. The washed pellet was resuspended with 20 ml of buffer B (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 4% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% (w/v) decanoyl-N-methylglucamide, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm PMSF, 200 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm benzamidine).

PKCϵ was excised by XhoI digestion and cloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pAcSG2, which had been linearized using XhoI. These constructs were used to generate high titer recombinant baculoviruses for the expression of these PKC isoforms in insect Sf9 cells using the BD Pharmingen BaculoGold System according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sf9 cells from three 150-cm2 culture flasks, which had been infected 3 days previously with baculoviruses for the overexpression of either PKCθ or PKCϵ, were harvested and washed in PBS prior to sonication (15 pulses, using a Branson 250 Sonifier and microtip at 20% duty cycle, power setting 2) in 5 ml of buffer C (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 4% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Tween 80, 2 mm PMSF, 200 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm benzamidine). Extracts were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 40 min, and supernatants were applied at 0.1 ml/min to a 1-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow equilibrated with buffer C. The column was washed first with 10 ml of buffer C then with 10 ml of buffer C containing 50 mm imidazole. Finally, 6-His-tagged PKCs were eluted in 0.5-ml fractions with buffer C containing 250 mm imidazole. Peak PKC-containing fractions, identified by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining, were diluted with glycerol (final concentration 50% (v/v)) and stored at -20 °C. In Vitro Phosphorylation of Muscle Proteins—Crude membrane and chromatography fractions (10 μl) were incubated at 30 °C in the absence or presence of purified recombinant 6-His-tagged PKCϵ or PKCθ, in a final volume of 50 μl, containing in addition 20 mm MOPS, 0.04% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm EGTA, 120 nm cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor peptide, 120 μg/ml α-phosphatidyl-l-serine, 2.5 μg/ml 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol, and 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (1000–2000 cpm/pmol). Reactions were terminated after 30 min by addition of 10 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, electroblotting to nitrocellulose, and phosphorimaging using an Amersham Biosciences 445 SI PhosphorImager. Large-scale Purification of pp48 —Rat red quadriceps muscle (50 g) was homogenized in 200 ml of buffer A, and a solubilized membrane fraction was prepared as above. This was applied to a 25-ml High Q column equilibrated with buffer B containing 50 mm NaCl, and protein eluted with a non-linear gradient of 50–500 mm NaCl over 40 fractions of 12.5 ml, followed by 500–1000 mm over 10 fractions of 12.5 ml. Fractions were subjected to phosphorylation by PKCθ and those containing pp48 (fractions 13–17) were pooled and applied to a 25-ml ceramic hydroxyapatite column equilibrated in buffer B containing 2 mm KH2PO4, which was further washed with 125 ml of 2 mm KH2PO4. Proteins were eluted with a non-linear gradient of 2–75 mm KH2PO4 in buffer B over 25 fractions of 12.5 ml followed by 75–150 mm over 10 fractions of 12.5 ml. pp48 was found by in vitro phosphorylation by PKCθ to be present mainly in the initial flowthrough of this purification step, and this fraction (60 ml) was concentrated to 1.0 ml under vacuum using a Filtron Omegacell 10-ml stirred cell device with 30-kDa molecular mass cut-off membrane. 2-DE of pp48 —200 μl of concentrated pp48 was phosphorylated by incubation with PKCθ as detailed above, in a final volume of 1 ml. The reaction mixture was dialyzed against two changes of deionized water using a Slide-A-Lyzer cassette with 10-kDa cut-off membrane and freeze-dried. For first dimension isoelectron focusing, the sample was rehydrated with 250 μl of 8 m urea, 0.5% IPG buffer (pH 4–7), 2% (w/v) CHAPS, and 100 mm DTT, and the solution used to rehydrate a 13-cm, pH 4–7 IPG strip for 16 h. Proteins were focused on the IPG strip using an Amersham Biosciences IPGphor isoelectric focusing unit at 500 V for 1 h, followed by 1000 V for 1 h, and finally 8000 V for 2 h. The IPG strip was then equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 6 m urea, 30% (v/v) glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS, and a trace amount of bromphenol blue and subjected to SDS-PAGE in the second dimension, using a 14 × 15 × 0.15 cm 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel. The gel was silver-stained (18Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Google Scholar) and subjected to phosphorimaging. Protein Identification by Mass Spectrometry—The 32P-labeled protein spots were excised from silver-stained gels, vacuum-dried, and subjected to tryptic digestion as adapted from Shevchenko et al. (18Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Google Scholar). Briefly, gels chips were washed with CH3CN, dried, and reswollen with 50 μl of 50 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, containing 10 ng/μl trypsin and digested for 16 h at 37 °C, and peptides were extracted by washing with 20 mm NH4HCO3 and three 20-min changes of 5% (v/v) formic acid in 50% (v/v) CH3CN. Peptides were lyophilized, then twice resuspended in water and lyophilized again to give a final volume of 5 μl. Protein identification was performed by μLC/ESI-MS/MS (19Corthals G.L. Gygi S.P. Aebersold R. Patterson S.D. Rabilloud T. Proteome Research: 2-D Gel Electrophoresis and Detection Methods. Springer-Verlag Inc., New York1999: 197-231Google Scholar). A quaternary Hewlett-Packard 1100 series high-performance liquid chromatograph was directly coupled to a Finnigan MAT TSQ7000 mass spectrometer equipped with an in-house built microspray device for peptide ionization. MS/MS spectra were correlated with data base entries using SEQUEST (Thermo Finnigan, Sydney, Australia), a program that correlates uninterpreted peptide fragmentation patterns with amino acid sequences contained in databases and also capable of identifying phosphorylation sites from uninterpreted MS/MS spectra (20Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Yates I. John R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectr. 1994; 5: 976-989Google Scholar). Ndrg2 Phosphorylation Site Mutants—Ser-332 → Ala, Thr-348 → Ala, and Ser-350 → Ala Ndrg2 mutants were generated by PCR-based mutagenesis of wild type mouse Ndrg2 cDNA in the pCMV/SV-FLAG1 vector using 5′-CGGTCTCGCACAGCAGCTCTGACCAGTGCAGCA-3′, 5′-CGGTCCCGATCCCGCGCCCTGTCGCAGAGTAGC-3′, and 5′-GGGCCCATCGATGGCAGTCGGTCCCGATCCCGCACCCTGGCGCAGAGTAGCG-3′ as primers, respectively. The Ser-332 → Ala/Thr-348 → Ala/Ser-350 → Ala combined mutant was generated by PCR-based mutagenesis of the Ser-332 → Ala Ndrg2 construct using 5′-GGGCCCATCGATGGCAGTCGGTCCCGATCCCGCGCCCTGGCGCAGAGTAGCG-3′ as a primer. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Mouse C2C12 Skeletal Muscle Cell Culture and Transfection—Cells were maintained as myoblasts in minimum essential medium with Earles' salts supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, and where stated induced to differentiate into myotubes by lowering FBS concentration to 1% (v/v), as previously described (21Schmitz-Peiffer C. Craig D.L. Biden T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24202-24210Google Scholar). For transfection with cDNA constructs, myoblasts were seeded at a density of 4 × 105 cells/well in 6-well culture plates. After 24 h, cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions, with a 2:1 ratio of reagent to DNA. Typically, 1 μg/well of a Ndrg2-pCMV/SV-FLAG1 DNA construct was used when Ndrg2 was overexpressed alone, whereas for co-expression experiments 0.3 μg of Ndrg2 was used with 3 μg of DNA constructs encoding protein kinases as indicated. Cells were used in experiments 48 h post-transfection. Palmitate pretreatment of cells was as described previously (21Schmitz-Peiffer C. Craig D.L. Biden T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24202-24210Google Scholar). Adenovirus-mediated Overexpression of Proteins in C2C12 Myotubes—The use of recombinant adenoviruses for the overexpression of constitutively active Akt, wild type PKCθ, or wild type PKCϵ, together with GFP in C2C12 myotubes, generated using the pAdEasy system (22He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Google Scholar), has been previously described (23Cazzolli R. Carpenter L. Biden T.J. Schmitz-Peiffer C. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2210-2218Google Scholar, 24Cazzolli R. Craig D.L. Biden T.J. Schmitz-Peiffer C. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: E1204-E1213Google Scholar). The pAdEasy system was also used to generate adenoviruses for the expression of Ndrg2 constructs, enabling co-expression of GFP and Ndrg2. A pAdEasy-derived virus expressing GFP alone was used in control infections. The amount of virus required to give 90–100% infection efficiency was individually determined for each virus by visualizing GFP expression. All viruses were used to infect C2C12 myotubes in 12-well plates at day 2 of differentiation, i.e. 3 days before experiments. [32P]Orthophosphate Labeling of C2C12 Cells—Myoblasts in 6-well plates were washed twice with a phosphate-free salt solution (25 mm PIPES-NaOH, pH 7.2, 119 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5.6 mm glucose, 0.4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1% (w/v) BSA, and 4 mm glutamine) (25Ludowyke R. Scurr L. McNally C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 157: 5130-5138Google Scholar), labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid in 500 μl of the same solution (500 μCi/well) for 2 h at 37 °C, and stimulated as indicated. Radioactive supernatant was removed, and cells washed three times with PBS before addition of 500 μl of lysis buffer (PBS containing 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm benzamidine, and 20 μm MG132). Cells were incubated in lysis buffer for 30 min on ice, and the resulting extracts were centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 × g. The supernatant was retained as the cell lysate. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Except for [32P]orthophosphate-labeled cells, muscle cells were washed twice with PBS and harvested in lysis buffer (250 μl for cells grown in 12-well plates), sonicated (10 pulses), and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Ndrg2 was immunoprecipitated from all cell lysates by addition of 5 μl of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel and 20 μl of CL-6B-Sepharose. Lysates were rocked gently for 16 h, and beads were washed three times in lysis buffer before addition of 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. Immunoprecipitates and lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE using 4–15% gradient Ready Gels and electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Immunoblotting, densitometry, and statistical analysis were carried out as described previously (3Schmitz-Peiffer C. Browne C.L. Oakes N.D. Watkinson A. Chisholm D.J. Kraegen E.W. Biden T.J. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 169-178Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were diluted 1:1000 except for anti-PKCθ (1:250). Two-dimensional Tryptic Phosphopeptide Mapping—Ndrg2 immunoprecipitated from [32P]orthophosphate-labeled C2C12 cells, or pp48 phosphorylated in vitro, was digested with trypsin as above. Peptides were resolved in two dimensions as described previously (26Campbell D.H. Sutherland R.L. Daly R.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5376-5385Google Scholar), except that the electrophoresis buffer (first dimension) used was 5% (v/v) acetic acid, 1% (v/v) pyridine, and the chromatography buffer (second dimension) used was 30% (v/v) butan-1-ol, 30% (v/v) pyridine, 6% (v/v) glacial acetic acid. Indirect Immunofluorescence—C2C12 cells grown on acid-washed coverslips were transiently transfected with plasmid DNA encoding FLAG-tagged Ndrg2. The cells were treated as stated in the figure legends, fixed in 3.7% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized in 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS, and blocked with 2% (w/v) BSA in PBS. Cells were subsequently stained with both rabbit polyclonal anti-FLAG and FITC-conjugated anti-actin antibodies for 2 h. After three washes in PBS, cells were incubated with Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibodies for 1 h. After washing in PBS and water, cells were mounted in Immuno-fluore and viewed using a Leica DM RBE TCS SP1 confocal microscope with Plan-Apochromat 63×/1.4 oil immersion objective and a helium/neon laser providing excitation wavelengths (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). The fluorochromes FITC and Cy3 were excited with 488- and 568-nm wavelengths, respectively, and individual channels were scanned in series. Images were recorded digitally with a Leica TCS software package and processed using Photoshop 3.05 software (Adobe Inc., San José, CA). Each image represents a single ∼0.8-μm ‘Z’ optical section. Identification of Ndrg2 as a PKCθ-specific Substrate in Skeletal Muscle—The nPKC isoforms PKCθ and PKCϵ have been strongly implicated in the generation of lipid-induced insulin resistance in skeletal muscle, although the precise mechanisms involved are unclear. An indication of potential substrates for nPKCs in skeletal muscle was obtained by employing purified recombinant PKC isoforms to phosphorylate muscle proteins in vitro. PKCθ was able to phosphorylate a 48-kDa protein (pp48) in crude preparations, which was best observed in membrane fractions (Fig. 1A), although it was also apparent to a lesser degree in cytosolic fractions (not shown). When a similar level of PKCϵ activity was used in incubations, normalized by comparison of in vitro PKC phosphorylation of histone IIIS (27Sarcevic B. Lilischkis R. Sutherland R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33327-33337Google Scholar), PKCϵ was found to be less effective in the phosphorylation of pp48 (Fig. 1A). Partial purification of a membrane fraction by Mono Q ion exchange chromatography resulted in protein fractions eluting with 330 mm NaCl in which pp48 was the major phosphorylated species (in addition to autophosphorylated PKCθ) (Fig. 1B). Similarly, we observed that pp48 eluted from Mono S resin at 200 mm NaCl (not shown) and hydroxyapatite resin equilibrated with 20 mm KH2PO4 (Fig. 1C) and was precipitated with NH4SO4 (saturation 25–40% (w/v), not shown). In the absence of muscle-derived fractions, only bands corresponding to the autophosphorylated PKC isoforms were observed in phosphorimaging analyses, demonstrating that pp48 was not co-purified with PKCθ from Sf9 insect cells (Fig. 1D). To identify pp48, the protein was partly purified by sequential Mono Q and hydroxyapatite chromatography and again phosphorylated by incubation with PKCθ, prior to 2-DE, followed by silver staining and phosphorimaging (Fig. 2A). The major spot observed in the phosphorimaging analysis coincided with a major 48-kDa silver-stained protein spot, which was excised from the gel and subjected to tryptic digestion. PKCθ (pI = 8.2) focuses outside the pH range employed and, therefore, is not observed here. Tryptic peptides from pp48 were analyzed by μLC/ESI-MS/MS, and three peptides corresponding to the amino acid sequence of rat Ndrg2 (14Boulkroun S. Fay M. Zennaro M.C. Escoubet B. Jaisser F. Blot-Chabaud M. Farman N. Courtois-Coutry N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31506-31515Google Scholar) were identified (Fig. 2B). The presence of the peptide corresponding to residues 26–32 (Fig. 2, B and C) indicated that the Ndrg2a1/Ndrg2b1 isoform (Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL accession number Q8VBU2) must be present (14Boulkroun S. Fay M. Zennaro M.C. Escoubet B. Jaisser F. Blot-Chabaud M. Farman N. Courtois-Coutry N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31506-31515Google Scholar). This protein has also been termed Anti-depressant-related protein ADRG123 (Q8VI01).

To explore mechanisms of oxidative stress-induced EGFR activation and signaling, primary cultures of human tracheal submucosal gland (SMG) cells were used to assess EGFR ligand release, EGFR phosphorylation, p44/42 MAPK phosphorylation, and mucin 5AC synthesis in response to reactive oxygen species generated by xanthine/xanthine oxidase (X/XO). Exposure to X/XO increased release of epidermal growth factor (EGF) from these cells, thereby activating EGFR, phosphorylating MAPK, and increasing mucin 5AC production. The importance of EGF was confirmed by transfection of small interfering RNA inhibiting pro-EGF production, which resulted in inhibition of EGFR and MAPK phosphorylation despite X/XO exposure. Blocking signaling by using specific protease inhibitors showed that tissue kallikrein (TK) processed pro-EGF in response to X/XO. Airway TK is bound and inactivated by luminal hyaluronan (HA), and treatment of submucosal gland cells with X/XO induced HA depolymerization and TK activation. These events were blocked by reactive oxygen species scavengers and addition of exogenous excess HA and TK inhibitors. Thus, HA plays a crucial role in regulating airway TK activity and thereby TK-mediated release of active EGF from human SMG cells. Sustained HA depolymerization is expected to cause TK activation, EGF release, and EGFR signaling and to lead to SMG cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia as well as mucus hypersecretion with subsequent airflow obstruction.

Mucus hypersecretion and characteristic changes in epithelial cell morphology, including goblet cell hyperplasia in major airways and metaplasia in small airways as well as submucosal gland hypertrophy, are pathophysiological and histological hallmarks of chronic bronchitis (1Trevisani L.

Cigarette smoke, the major cause of chronic bronchitis in humans, has also been shown to induce mucin secretion and mucous cell hyperplasia, at least in part, via EGFR-mediated signaling (6Takeyama K. Jung B. Shim J.J. Burgel P.R. Dao-Pick T. Ueki I.F. Protin U. Kroschel P. Nadel J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: L165-L172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because oxidative stress causes EGFR activation (7Takeyama K. Dabbagh K. Jeong Shim J. Dao-Pick T. Ueki I.F. Nadel J.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1546-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) and cigarette smoke is a major source of direct and indirect oxidative stress (8Chow C.K. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

However, the mechanisms by which oxidative stress stimulates EGFR signaling are not fully understood. The classic EGFR, c-ErbB1, is activated by different ligands including EGF, transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α), heparin binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), amphiregulin, epiregulin, and betacellulin (10Miyazaki Y.

EGFR ligand precursors are synthesized as transmembrane proteins that are cleaved to their active form by extracellular proteases (15Massague J. Pandiella A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 515-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Whereas TGF-α, HB-EGF, amphiregulin, epiregulin, and betacellulin are processed by metalloproteases of a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) family (e.g. Ref. 16Sunnarborg S.W. Hinkle C.L.

This serine protease has been identified to be tissue kallikrein (TK) in salivary and mammary glands, and its activity has been found to be consistent with TK in the kidney (17Jorgensen P.E. Nexo E. Poulsen S.S. Almendingen M. Berg T. Growth Factors. 1994; 11: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 18Jahnke G.D. Chao J. Walker M.P. Diaugustine R.P.

Biol. 1999; 21: 666-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), its potentially crucial role in EGF precursor activation and EGFR-mediated signaling has not been examined. Bronchial TK is in fact uniquely regulated in the airway. Studies from this laboratory have shown that TK is secreted with hyaluronan (HA) from submucosal glands, which inhibits its catalytic activity (21Forteza R. Lauredo I. Abraham W.M. Conner G.E. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 21: 666-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We have also shown that HA immobilizes inactive bronchial TK at the epithelial surface, creating a pool of readily available yet inactive TK on the airway surface (22Forteza R. Lieb T. Aoki T. Savani R.C. Conner G.E. Salathe M. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2179-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and that HA degradation results in a dramatic increase in TK activity (21Forteza R. Lauredo I. Abraham W.M. Conner G.E. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 21: 666-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Such a TK/HA pool also exists within the lumen of submucosal gland ducts as they contain secretions not yet expelled into the airway lumen. Because HA is depolymerized by oxidative stress (e.g. Ref. 23Agren U.M. Tammi R.H. Tammi M.I. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 996-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), increased airway TK activity is expected in diseases associated with increased airway ROS production. In fact, airway TK activity is increased in chronic bronchitis and other diseases associated with mucus hypersecretion compared with normal subjects (24Christiansen S.C. Proud D. Cochrane C.G. J.

Based on these findings, we hypothesized that ROS-induced HA degradation results in TK activation and pro-EGF processing in the airways, providing a direct link between oxidative stress and activation of EGFR signaling. To examine this hypothesis, we used primary cultures of human airway submucosal gland (SMG) cells to study EGFR ligand release and EGFR signaling during oxidative stress. All materials were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise specified. Human tracheas and main bronchi from donor lungs rejected for transplantation were obtained through the University of Miami Life Alliance Organ Recovery Agency with approval from the local Institutional Review Board. The trachea and main bronchi were opened at the membranous portion, and the mucosa was dissected off the cartilage. Mucosal strips were digested with 0.05% protease (type 14) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) and incubated overnight at 4 °C for 24 h to release ciliated epithelial cells (which were used for different experiments after shaking them off the strips). To release gland cells, the remaining tissue was incubated for another 24 h in 0.01% dispase in DMEM supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (0.25 μg/ml), amphotericin B (2.5 μg/ml), and gentamicin (50 μg/ml) (referred to as DMEM-AB). Each strip was scraped after digestion to release the remaining gland cells. Cells were washed once in DMEM-AB, resuspended in DMEM-AB containing 0.25% trypsin-EDTA, and triturated to dissociate the remaining “clumps” of gland acini. Digestion was stopped with soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI, 500 μg/ml), and cells were resuspended in DMEM-AB. After cell counting and viability determination by trypan blue exclusion (viability was always >95%), 5 × 105 cells were plated on placental collagen-coated, 24-mm T-clear membrane filters inserts (Costar, Cambridge, MA). Cultures were maintained in submerged conditions by adding media to both the basolateral and apical sides consisting of 50% DMEM-AB, 50% Ham's F-12 supplemented with hydrocortisone (0.5 μg/ml), insulin (5 μg/ml), transferrin (10 μg/ml), epinephrine (0.5 μg/ml), triiodothyronine (6.5 ng/ml), and EGF (25 ng/ml). Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. After 10 days of growth, 81 ± 14% of the cells (100 cells counted per well; mean ± S.E.) stained positive with Alcian blue-periodic acid-Schiff, a feature consistent with a glandular origin of the cells. Measured over an 18-h period, these SMG cells secreted TK (a specific serous cell product) and HA (3.51 ± 0.20 μg/mg cell lysate protein and 4.05 μg/mg cell lysate protein, respectively). Confluent cell monolayers with resistivities of 926 ± 13.5 ohms·cm were used for all studies. Exogenous EGF was removed from the media 48 h before experimentation. Immediately prior to all experiments, the basal medium was changed to RPMI, and the apical medium was replaced with PBS. After the studies, apical supernatants were collected, and cells were lysed with 20 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm HEPES, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin, pH 7.8 (lysis buffer), for 30 min at 4 °C. To remove insoluble material, cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Supernatants and cell lysates were frozen at -20 °C for later analysis. In experiments designed to test the effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS) on EGFR ligand processing and signaling, SMG cells were exposed to X/XO (0.6 mm xanthine plus 0.05 units of xanthine oxidase) for 30 min in the absence or presence of the following: the ROS scavengers catalase (150 units/ml) or superoxide dismutase (SOD, 150 units/ml); the serine protease inhibitors aprotinin (100 μg/ml) or soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI; 100 μg/ml); HA (40 μg/ml, vitreous humor, average molecular mass ∼200 kDa, Seikagaku America, Falmouth MA); and the metalloprotease inhibitor GM6001 (25 μm; Chemicon International, Temecula, CA). The use of these serine protease inhibitors allows for the distinction of TK from other serine proteases because TK is sensitive to aprotinin (Ki 4.6 nm) but insensitive to SBTI up to 100 μm (29Geiger R. Miska W. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 163: 102-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In additional experiments, the specific TK peptide inhibitor RPGLPVRFESPLRINIIKE-NH2 (30Cagliari C.I. De Caroli F.P. Nakahata A.M. Araujo M.S. Nakaie C.R. Sampaio M.U. Sampaio C.A. Oliva M.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 311: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) was used to confirm that the ROS effect on pro-EGF processing was mediated by TK. This TK-specific peptide inhibitor was custom-synthesized by Biopeptide Co., LLC (San Diego, CA), and used at a concentration of 10 μm. To determine whether ROS effects were mediated by EGFR, functionally blocking anti-EGFR antibodies (1 μg/ml, Calbiochem) were used. In experiments designed to define pro-EGF processing under base-line conditions, SMG cells were incubated for 18 h in the absence (control) or presence of aprotinin (100 μg/ml), SBTI (100 μg/ml = 4.5 μm), or GM6001 (25 μm). Because the inhibitory profile and the use of specific TK inhibitors in the above experiments suggested that TK is the main protease that processes pro-forms of EGFR ligands in these cells, experiments were designed to test the ability of TK to process pro-EGF and induce EGFR activation and signaling. SMG cells were exposed for 18 h to PBS (control) or recombinant TK (rTK, 1 μm in PBS see below) in the absence or presence of aprotinin, SBTI, GM6001, or HA. Paraffin-embedded sections of human trachea or cell cultures were labeled with a monoclonal anti-EGF antibody (5 μg/ml; Calbiochem) by using overnight incubation at 4 °C. After washing with PBS, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-mouse IgG antibody was added for 45 min. Enhanced fluorescence was achieved with the Tyramide Signal Amplification kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) according to the manufacturer's instructions. rTK was produced in Pichia pastoris as described (31Chan H. Springman E.B. Clark J.M. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 12: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, P. pastoris (strain GS115) was transfected with a plasmid encoding rTK (pPIC9pro-TK) generously donated by Dr. Hedy Chan (Axys Pharmaceuticals) using a Pichia Expression kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The plasmid contains the full coding sequence of human salivary pro-TK behind the alcohol dehydrogenase promoter and a signal sequence to allow induction of synthesis and secretion into the media. This pro-form is unstable and is converted to active kallikrein by autocatalysis in the culture media. Cells were removed by centrifugation, and culture medium was dialyzed against 50 mm imidazole, pH 7.0. TK was purified using a benzamidine-Sepharose column (5 ml, Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated in 50 mm imidazole, pH 7.0. Recombinant TK was eluted with a guanidine gradient (50-500 mm in 50 mm imidazole, pH 7.0) by using a Duo Flow high pressure liquid chromatography system (Bio-Rad). Purity of the protein was confirmed by PAGE and by specific activity. Purified fractions were dialyzed against sodium acetate, pH 7.0, and stored at -20 °C. The system yielded about 30 mg of rTK per liter of culture media. TK enzyme activity was determined using dl-Val-Leu-Arg-p-nitroanilide as a substrate as described previously (21Forteza R. Lauredo I. Abraham W.M. Conner G.E. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 21: 666-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the presence of SBTI, this assay is highly specific for TK (29Geiger R. Miska W. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 163: 102-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples (100 μl) were incubated in an ultra low binding 96-well plate with 10 μl of trypsin (5 μg/ml) for 15 min at 37 °C to activate any pro-kallikrein. After adding 40 μl of SBTI (1 mg/ml) and 100 μl of dl-Val-Leu-Arg-p-nitroanilide (2 mm; ICN, Irvine, CA) in 200 mm Tris, pH 8.2, absorbance was monitored at 412 nm using a microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Enzyme concentrations were calculated by interpolating activities from the rTK standard curve. The apical media of cultured SMG cells were analyzed for the following soluble EGFR ligands: EGF, TGF-α, HB-EGF, amphiregulin, and betacellulin. EGF and TGF-α were measured using commercially available ELISA kits according to the manufacturer's guidelines (Quantikine kit, R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN; and Calbiochem, respectively). ELISAs were also used to measure HB-EGF, amphiregulin, and betacellulin. Briefly, 50 μl of sample (supernatant or standard) was incubated overnight with 50 μl of bicarbonate/carbonate buffer, pH 9.2, at 4 °C in a 96-well plate. Then plates were washed three times with 20 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.5 (TTBS), and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in TTBS for 6 h at room temperature. After washing, plates were incubated with 100 μl of mouse monoclonal anti-HB-EGF antibody (R & D Systems, 10 μg/ml diluted into TTBS), goat polyclonal anti-amphiregulin antibody (R & D Systems, 5 μg/ml), or mouse monoclonal anti-betacellulin antibody (4 μg/ml). After 2 h, the wells were washed, and 100 μl of goat anti-mouse IgG (0.2 μg/ml) or mouse anti-goat IgG (0.5 μg/ml), both conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MA), were dispensed into each well and incubated for 2 h. Color was developed with p-nitrophenyl phosphate and stopped with 3 n NaOH. Absorbance was read at 410 nm. EGFR ligand concentrations were determined by interpolation from the standard curves. HA content of the supernatants was estimated using a biotinylated HA-binding protein (b-HABP) assay as described by Bray et al. (32Bray B.A. Hsu W. Turino G.M. Exp. Lung Res. 1994; 20: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, the wells of a microtiter plate were coated overnight with 100 μg/ml of HA isolated from bovine vitreous humor (Worthington). Supernatants or HA standards (100 μl) were pre-incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 16 μl of b-HABP (Seikagaku, 15 ng/ml) and 84 μl of PBS containing 2% BSA and 0.2% Tween 20. The pre-incubated supernatants/standards were added to the wells and incubated for 90 min at 37 °C. After washing with PBS, the wells were incubated with streptavidin coupled to alkaline phosphatase (1 μg/ml, Bio-Rad) for 2 h at room temperature. Color was developed with p-nitrophenyl phosphate and stopped with 3 n NaOH. Absorbance was read at 410 nm. Concentrations were determined by interpolation from a standard curve. HA·TK complexes were generated in vitro by incubating HA (average molecular size 200 kDa, 40 μg/ml) with rTK (10 μg/ml) in 1 ml of PBS for 3 h at 37 °C. Complex formation was confirmed by determining inhibition of TK activity (resulting in 50% of base-line activity under these conditions) and by electrophoresis using an overlay membrane method to visualize enzyme activity and molecular distribution as described (21Forteza R. Lauredo I. Abraham W.M. Conner G.E. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 21: 666-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Exposure to X/XO (0.6 mm xanthine plus 0.05 units of xanthine oxidase) for 30 min was used to disrupt TK·HA complexes. Complex disruption was confirmed by TK activity measurements. To confirm that X/XO induced HA depolymerization under the used experimental conditions, supernatants of SMG cultures treated with X/XO, X/XO plus catalase, or PBS as described above were collected, pooled, and digested with proteinase K (125 μg/ml, 2 h at 60 °C). Digested samples were precipitated with 85% ethanol, and pellets used for agarose electrophoresis and fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (FACE). Agarose Gel Electrophoresis—One set of pellets was resuspended in water and run in 0.7% agarose-Tris borate-EDTA gels as described (33Lee H.G. Cowman M.K. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 219: 278-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, samples were transferred to a Biodyne B nylon membrane (Pall Gelman Laboratory, Ann Arbor MI) and probed with b-HABP (1 μg/ml, Seikagaku), followed by streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (Bio-Rad). Color was developed with bromochloroindolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium. FACE—To determine whether X/XO treatment resulted in the release of HA oligosaccharides from cultured cells, another set of pellets was resuspended in 0.1 m ammonium acetate, pH 7.5, and incubated overnight at 37 °C with 20 milliunits of chondroitinase ABC at pH 7.5 (were hyaluronidase activity is negligible), 5 milliunits of keratanase, and 5 milliunits of endo-β-galactosidase. Hyaluronidase was omitted in order to detect ROS-induced appearance of small hyaluronan fragments. Digested samples were ethanol-precipitated, dried, derivatized with 2-aminoacridone (AMAC, Molecular Probes), and run in MONO™ (Prozyme, San Leandro, CA) composition gels with MONO™ (Prozyme) gel running buffer as described by Calabro et al. (34Calabro A. Hascall V.C. Midura R.J. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). After precipitation, glycosaminoglycan disaccharides (e.g. chondroitin sulfate or keratan sulfate) were expected to remain in the supernatant (34Calabro A. Hascall V.C. Midura R.J. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Thus, only ethanol-precipitated HA fragments should be available for derivatization with AMAC. Gels were photographed under 302 nm UV light using a ChemiDoc XRS imaging system and Quantity One data analysis software (both from Bio-Rad). Duplicate aliquots of cells lysates containing equal amounts of protein were used for estimating total and phosphorylated EGFR (pEGFR) by Western blotting. For pEGFR, samples were immunoprecipitated using a monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody (Ab-3, 1 μg/ml; Calbiochem) and protein A-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Incubation occurred overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times with cold PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. Beads were resuspended in 20 μl of Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad), heated to 95 °C for 5 min, and centrifuged. Supernatants from immunoprecipitation as well as cell lysates were electrophoresed on 4-15% Tris-HCl Ready Gels (Bio-Rad) and then transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The membranes were incubated with 1% gelatin in TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h followed by mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY99, 2 μg/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-EGFR antibody. Secondary antibody was a mouse anti-goat IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (0.5 μg/ml, Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories) that was visualized using bromochloroindolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium as a substrate. Developed blots were scanned, and the pEGFR to EGFR ratio was quantified using Quantity One analysis software (Bio-Rad). Aliquots of cells lysates containing equal amounts of protein were suspended in Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Proteins were separated on 4-15% Tris-HCl Ready gels and transferred to membranes as described above. Samples were examined for p44/42 MAPK (Erk1 and Erk2) using the PhosphoPlus p44/p42 MAP kinase (Thr-202/Thr-204) antibody kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Developed blots were scanned, and the p44/42 MAPK to p44/42 MAPK ratio was quantified using Quantity One analysis software (Bio-Rad). Cell lysates (50 μl) were incubated with bicarbonate-carbonate buffer, pH 9.2 (50 μl), for 1 h at 37 °C in a 96-well plate (Dynex, Chantilly, VA) or until dry. Plates were washed three times with TBS and blocked with 2% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. Plates were again washed three times with TBS and then incubated with 50 μl of a monoclonal anti-MUC 5AC antibody (10 μg/ml, Chemicon International) diluted into PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. After 1 h, wells were washed with TBS, and 100 μl of goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (0.2 μg/ml, Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories) was dispensed into each well. After 1 additional hour, plates were washed with TBS. Color was developed with p-nitrophenyl phosphate and stopped with 3 n NaOH. Absorbance was read at 410 nm. Results were expressed as % changes in A410 above the PBS control. This was necessary as pure MUC 5AC was not available to calibrate the assays. Double-stranded siRNA for the DNA target sequence of human pro-EGF (5′-AATCCTTATGAGGAGTCGAGC-3′) and control, non-silencing RNA (5′-AATTCTCCGAACGTCTCACGT-3′) were bought from Qiagen-Xeragon (Germantown, MD) and transfected into human SMG cells with TransMessenger™ Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two days after transfection, the cells were exposed to X/XO in the absence or presence of catalase or PBS for 30 min. Cell lysates were analyzed for EGFR and p44/42 MAPK activation as described above. To confirm that the siRNA silenced pro-EGF expression, experiments using siRNA and control RNA were repeated on SMG cells grown on coverslips. EGF protein expression was assessed by immunofluorescence as described above. Sample volume was insufficient for determination of EGF by ELISA. Data were expressed as mean ± S.E. Differences between multiple groups were compared using a one-way analysis of variance followed by the Tuckey Kramer honestly significant difference test. Levene test was used to analyze the homogeneity of variances. Significance was accepted at p < 0.05.

https://openalex.org/W2147291773,"Kinesins orchestrate cell division by controlling placement of chromosomes. Kinesins must be precisely regulated or else cell division fails. Calcium, a universal second messenger in eukaryotes, and calmodulin regulate some kinesins by causing the motor to dissociate from its biological track, the microtubule. Our focus was the mechanism of calcium regulation of kinesin at atomic resolution. Here we report the crystal structure of kinesin-like calmodulin-binding protein (KCBP) from potato, which was resolved to 2.3 A. The structure reveals three subdomains of the regulatory machinery located at the C terminus extension of the kinesin motor. Calmodulin that is activated by Ca2+ ions binds to an alpha-helix positioned on the microtubule-binding face of kinesin. A negatively charged segment following this helix competes with microtubules. A mimic of the conventional kinesin neck, connecting the calmodulin-binding helix to the KCBP motor core, links the regulatory machine to the kinesin catalytic cycle. Together with biochemical data, the crystal structure suggests that Ca(2+)-calmodulin inhibits the binding of KCBP to microtubules by blocking the microtubule-binding sites on KCBP."
https://openalex.org/W2023985493,"RasGRPs constitute a new group of diacylglycerol-dependent GDP/GTP exchange factors that activate Ras subfamily GTPases. Despite a common structure, Ras-GRPs diverge in their GTPase specificity, subcellular distribution, and downstream biological effects. The more divergent family member is RasGRP2, a Rap1-specific exchange factor with low affinity toward diacylglycerol. The regulation of RasGRP2 during signal transduction has remained elusive up to now. In this report, we show that the subcellular localization of Ras-GRP2 is highly dependent on actin dynamics. Thus, the induction of F-actin by cytoskeletal regulators such as Vav, Vav2, Dbl, and Rac1 leads to the shift of RasGRP2 from the cytosol to membrane ruffles and its co-localization with F-actin. Treatment of cells with cytoskeletal disrupting drugs abolishes this effect, leading to an abnormal localization of RasGRP2 in cytoplasmic clusters of actin. The use of Rac1 effector mutants indicates that the RasGRP2 translocation is linked exclusively to actin polymerization and is independent of other pathways such as p21-activated kinase JNK, or superoxide production. Biochemical experiments demonstrate that the translocation of RasGRP2 to membrane ruffles is mediated by the direct association of this protein with F-actin, a property contained within its 150 first amino acids. Finally, we show that the RasGRP2/F-actin interaction promotes the regionalized activation of Rap1 in juxtamembrane areas of the cell. These results reveal a novel function of the actin cytoskeleton in mediating the spatial activation of Ras subfamily GTPases through the selective recruitment of GDP/GTP exchange factors.

These results reveal a novel function of the actin cytoskeleton in mediating the spatial activation of Ras subfamily GTPases through the selective recruitment of GDP/GTP exchange factors. One frequent event in the signaling pathways engaged by most extracellular factors is the activation of GTPases of the Ras subfamily (1Pronk G.J. Bos J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 131-147PubMed Google Scholar). This group of GTP-binding proteins is composed of Ras (K-RasA, K-RasB, N-Ras, and H-Ras), R-Ras (R-Ras, TC21/R-Ras2, and M-Ras/R-Ras3), Rap (Rap1A, Rap1B, Rap2A, and Rap2B), and Ral (RalA and RalB) proteins (2Ehrhardt A. Ehrhardt G.R. Guo X. Schrader J.W. Exp. Hematol. 2002; 30: 1089-1106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). These GTPases share a common tridimensional structure and a regulatory cycle strictly dependent on the binding of guanosine nucleotides (1Pronk G.J. Bos J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 131-147PubMed Google Scholar, 3Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 851-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). In nonactivated cells, these GTPases are found in an inactive, GDP-bound state. The stimulation of receptors by their respective ligands leads to the release of GDP and the incorporation of GTP molecules. This exchange of nucleotides induces a conformational change within the switch I and switch II of the GTPases that converts them in optimal docking sites for effector molecules such as c-Raf family proteins, Ral GDP dissociation stimulator (RalGDS), 1The abbreviations used are: RalGDS, Ral GDP dissociation stimulator; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; DAG, diacylglycerol; DH, Dbl homology domain; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; GEF, guanosine nucleotide exchange factor; GRF, guanosine nucleotide-releasing factor; GRP, GDP-releasing protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PAK, p21-activated kinase; PH, pleckstrin homology domain; RBD, Ras binding domain; SH, Src homology; Sos, son-of-sevenless; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; ZF, zinc finger. 1The abbreviations used are: RalGDS, Ral GDP dissociation stimulator; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; DAG, diacylglycerol; DH, Dbl homology domain; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; GEF, guanosine nucleotide exchange factor; GRF, guanosine nucleotide-releasing factor; GRP, GDP-releasing protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PAK, p21-activated kinase; PH, pleckstrin homology domain; RBD, Ras binding domain; SH, Src homology; Sos, son-of-sevenless; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; ZF, zinc finger. and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (1Pronk G.J.

The concomitant activation of these effector proteins by either post-translational modification (i.e. phosphorylation) or changes in their subcellular localization initiate the stimulation of several signaling cascades that determine, among other biological responses, the proliferative, developmental, and/or motility status of the cell that has received the extracellular stimulus (1Pronk G.J. Bos J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 131-147PubMed Google Scholar, 4Marshall M.S. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1311-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The GTPase signal is subsequently shut off at the end of the stimulation period by the hydrolysis of the bound GTP, a step mediated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) (1Pronk G.J. Bos J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 131-147PubMed Google Scholar, 3Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 851-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). The importance of this cycle is underscored by the observation that point mutations affecting either the GTP hydrolysis or the GDP/GTP exchange originate GTPase proteins with high oncogenic potential (3Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 851-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar).Because of this activation/deactivation cycle, the main regulatory step in the modulation of the activity of these GTPases is the stimulus-dependent triggering of GDP/GTP exchange. This exchange is catalyzed by enzymes known indistinctly as guanosine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), guanosine nucleotide-releasing factors (GRFs), GDP-releasing proteins (GRPs), or GDP dissociation stimulators (5Quilliam L.A. Rebhun J.F. Castro A.F. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 71: 391-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GEF families described so far for Ras subfamily proteins include Sos proteins (Sos1 and Sos2), Ras GRFs (RasGRF1 and RasGRF2), cyclic nucleotide Ras GEF (CNRasGEF), and Ras GRPs (RasGRP1, RasGRP3, RasGRP4, and the N-myristoylatable and nonmyristoylatable RasGRP2 versions generated by the differential splicing of the rasgrp2 gene) (5Quilliam L.A. Rebhun J.F. Castro A.F. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 71: 391-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to these families, there are other GEFs specific only for Rap proteins, such as C3G and Epac. Although these GEFs are highly divergent from a structural point of view, they have in common the presence of a Cdc25 domain responsible for stimulating nucleotide exchange on either Rap and/or Ras GTP hydrolases (5Quilliam L.A.

Sos and RasGRF proteins also contain a Dbl homology domain involved in the activation of Rho/Rac GTPases (5Quilliam L.A. Rebhun J.F. Castro A.F. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 71: 391-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). According to this, several reports have indicated that these GEFs can promote the activation of Rac1 (6Nimnual A.S. Yatsula B.A. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1998; 279: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 7Fan W.T. Koch C.A. de Hoog C.L. Fam N.P. Moran M.F. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 935-938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Most GEF families have become specialized in the activation of Ras subfamily proteins in specific signaling contexts. Sos and C3G proteins are involved in connecting protein-tyrosine kinases with the stimulation of Ras subfamily GTPases (5Quilliam L.A. Rebhun J.F. Castro A.F. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 71: 391-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ras-GRF, CNRasGEF, and Epac proteins are coupled to heterotrimeric G-proteins (5Quilliam L.A. Rebhun J.F. Castro A.F. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 71: 391-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to those GEFs, the different members of the RasGRP family are more difficult to assign to a common framework of biological functions and regulatory mechanisms. This is because these exchange factors diverge significantly in a number of biochemical, cellular, and biological properties. At the biochemical level, RasGRPs work catalytically on an overlapping, but not identical, subset of GTPases. Thus, RasGRP1 activates the exchange activity of TC21, M-Ras, and Ras proteins. Instead, it is inactive on Rap GTPases (8Ohba Y. Mochizuki N. Yamashita S. Chan A.M. Schrader J.W. Hattori S. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. J. Biol.

A. 1998; 95: 13278-13283Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the catalytic specificity of RasGRP2 appears to be different in function of the splice variant used (13Clyde-Smith J. Silins G. Gartside M. Grimmond S. Etheridge M. Apolloni A. Hayward N. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32260-32267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). RasGRP4 activates Ras but not Rap proteins (14Reuther G.W.

RasGRP3 is the more promiscuous member, being active on the majority of Ras subfamily GTPases tested so far (8Ohba Y. Mochizuki N. Yamashita S. Chan A.M. Schrader J.W. Hattori S. Nagashima K.

As a probable consequence of this biochemical heterogeneity, RasGRPs exhibit different biological properties, including differences in the activation of extracellular-regulated kinases (inhibited by RasGRP2 and stimulated by the other RasGRPs), the stimulation of JNK (stimulated preferentially by RasGRP1 and -3), the induction of neuronal differentiation (where RasGRP2 is inactive), and the promotion of anchorage-independent growth (induced by Ras-GRP1, -3, and -4) (12Kawasaki H.

Finally, and perhaps more intriguingly from a regulatory point of view, RasGRPs show a different susceptibility toward upstream signals. The activation of RasGRP1, -3, and -4 is mediated via the phospholipase C-γ-dependent generation of diacylglycerol (DAG) (9Ebinu J.O. Bottorff D.A. Chan E.Y. Stang S.L. Dunn R.J. Stone J.C.

This second messenger binds to a C-terminal ZF region present in those GEFs (see Fig. 5), making it possible the translocation of RasGRPs to membranes and their subsequent association with the target GTPases (5Quilliam L.A. Rebhun J.F. Castro A.F. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 71: 391-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Rong S.B. Enyedy I.J. Qiao L. Zhao L. Ma D. Pearce L.L. Lorenzo P.S. Stone J.C. Blumberg P.M. Wang S. Kozikowski A.P. J. Med. Chem. 2002; 45: 853-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In contrast, RasGRP2 shows a very poor response to DAG and, as a consequence, it does not undergo the characteristic rapid translocation of other RasGRPs to the plasma membrane and endomembranes when cells are treated with DAG agonists (13Clyde-Smith J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 33465-33473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The divergence among the RasGRP ZF regions also conditions the subcellular localization of these proteins. Thus, RasGRP1 and -3 localize preferentially in both the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus in exponentially growing cells (24Caloca M.J. Zugaza J.L. Bustelo X.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33465-33473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In contrast, RasGRP2 is found in the cytoplasm or in both the cytosol and the plasma membrane depending on the splice variant analyzed (13Clyde-Smith J. Silins G. Gartside M. Grimmond S. Etheridge M. Apolloni A. Hayward N. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32260-32267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 24Caloca M.J. Zugaza J.L. Bustelo X.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33465-33473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The above observations indicate that RasGRP2 is the most divergent member of the family, in terms of substrate specificity, subcellular localization, and regulation by upstream signals.The different behavior or RasGRP2 led us to look for regulatory signals that could modulate its activity during cell stimulation. During our work with RasGRPs (24Caloca M.J. Zugaza J.L. Bustelo X.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33465-33473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), we observed that the nonmyristoylatable RasGRP2 isoform could be found in exponentially growing cells in membrane areas rich in F-actin. Moreover, and unlike RasGRP1 and -3, the treatment of quiescent cells with either epidermal growth factor or phorbol esters did not induce the effective translocation of this protein toward the plasma membrane or the Golgi apparatus. Instead, a small enrichment of RasGRP2 in peripheral membrane ruffles was observed. These observations led us to investigate whether this idiosyncratic member of the RasGRP family could be regulated by signals promoting actin polymerization and cytoskeletal change. In this report, we show that different cytoskeletal regulators such as Vav, Vav2, Dbl, and Rac1 can promote the effective translocation of RasGRP2 toward juxtamembrane areas and membrane ruffles. Moreover, we demonstrate that this effect is because of the intrinsic property of RasGRP2 of associating with polymerized filaments of actin via its N-terminal domain.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmids—Mammalian expression vectors encoding FLAG-tagged RasGRP2 (pCXN2-RasGRP2), EGFP-tagged RasGRP2 (pMJC39), and EGFP-tagged Rac1 (pNM32) have been described previously (24Caloca M.J. Zugaza J.L. Bustelo X.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33465-33473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The mammalian expression vector encoding the EGFP-Rac1G12V+ΔIns mutant (pMJC8) was generated by ligating into the pEGFP-C1 vector a fragment containing the rac1G12V+ΔIns cDNA obtained by PCR from the pCGT-Rac1G12V+ΔIns plasmid (provided by Dr. D.

Deletion mutants of Ras-GRP2 were generated by PCR using pCXN2-RasGRP2 as template and subcloned into either the pCEFL-FLAG or the pGEX-4T3 vectors for expression in eukaryotes and prokaryotes, respectively. pcDNA3-Vav (Δ1-186) (pMJC10) and pcDNA3-Vav (Δ1-66) were generated by PCR using the pJC11 plasmid as DNA template (26Schuebel K.E. Movilla N. Rosa J.L. Bustelo X.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6608-6621Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar).

The oligonucleotides used for the generation of RasGRP2 and Vav mutants are available upon request. The expression vector for the Vav (Δ1-186+Δ608-845) mutant (pNM103) has been described previously (26Schuebel K.E. Movilla N. Rosa J.L. Bustelo X.R.

Yamashita S. Kurokawa K. Ohba Y. Nagai T. Miyawaki A. Matsuda M. Nature. 2001; 411: 1065-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). pEGFP vectors were purchased from Clontech. A bacterial expression vector encoding the GST fused to the Ras binding domain of RalGDS (amino acid residues 701-851) (pGEX-RalGDS-RBD) was obtained from Dr. P. Crespo (University of Cantabria/Instituto de Investigaciones Biomédicas, Santander, Cantabria, Spain).Tissue Culture and DNA Transfections—COS1 and Jurkat cells were cultured at 37 °C and a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. COS1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum plus 100 units·ml-1 penicillin and streptomycin. Jurkat cells were grown in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum plus 100 units·ml-1 penicillin and streptomycin. All tissue culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. For ectopic protein expression, COS1 cells were transfected with the appropriate plasmids using a liposomal carrier (FuGENE6, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the instructions from the manufacturer. For standard immunofluorescence studies, COS1 cells were transfected with 1 μg of each mammalian expression vector. For Rap1 GTP pull-down experiments, cells were transfected with 0.1 and 1 μg of vectors encoding RasGRP2 and Vav (Δ1-186), respectively. For fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analyses, COS1 cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of pRaichu-Rap1-404X, 0.5 μg of the vector encoding EGFP-Vav (Δ1-186), and 1 μg of the plasmid containing FLAG-tagged RasGRP2 in the appropriate combinations. Jurkat T cells were transfected by electroporation with 10 μg of each indicated plasmid. Electroporations were performed in Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) with a Gene Pulser II apparatus (Bio-Rad) using 0.4-cm gap electroporation cuvettes with settings of 280 V and 1200 microfarads. In all cases, transfections were supplemented with empty vector to normalize the total amount of plasmid DNA used in each transfection.F-actin Co-sedimentation Assays—Actin co-sedimentation assays were performed as reported (33Scita G. Tenca P. Areces L.B. Tocchetti A. Frittoli E. Giardina G. Ponzanelli I. Sini P. Innocenti M. Di Fiore P.P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1031-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Briefly, F-actin was obtained by incubating G-actin (Sigma) in F-buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 1 mm ATP, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl) for 60 min at 37 °C. GST-RasGRP2 (amino acids 1-150) was purified by standard GST fusion protein purification protocols. Purified proteins were incubated with various amounts of F-actin in F-buffer in a total volume of 100 μl at 37 °C for 45 min and then ultracentrifuged for 60 min at 100,000 × g in a TLA-100 rotor (Beckman). After the centrifugation, supernatants (100 μl) were taken off and diluted 1:1 with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Aliquots of the supernatants (30 μl) and pellets (15 μl) were denatured by boiling, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose filters, and immunoblotted with antibodies to GST (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:1,000 dilution) and actin (Sigma, 1:5,000 dilution). Immunoreactive bands were visualized using a chemiluminescence detection system (ECL, Amersham Biosciences).GST Pull-down Assays—For Rap1 activity assays, COS1 cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% IGEPAL (Sigma), 100 μm Na3VO4 (Sigma), 1 mm NaF (Sigma), and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Cømplete, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants were incubated for 60 min at 4 °C with 10 μg of GST protein fused to the Ras/Rap binding domain of RalGDS immobilized onto glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). After incubation, beads were collected and washed three times with lysis buffer. Proteins were then eluted from the beads using Laemmli's sample buffer, separated electrophoretically, and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-Rap1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Pull-down assays conducted with GST proteins containing either the N-terminal domain (residues 1-150) of RasGRP2 or the Rac1 binding domain of PAK1 were performed as described above. When appropriate, the proteins transferred to the nitrocellulose filter were visualized by staining with Ponceau solution (Sigma), followed by three washes with water.Immunofluorescence Analysis—COS1 cells were grown onto glass coverslips and transfected as indicated above. 24-48 h after transfection, cells were washed, fixed with formaldehyde (Sigma), and subjected to immunostaining. Immunological reagents used were anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), anti-HA (Covance), and anti-Dbl (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cy3- and Cy2-labeled secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson Immunolaboratories. Rhodamine-phalloidin and cytochalasin D were obtained from Molecular Probes and Sigma, respectively. For FRET imaging, COS-1 cells were grown on polylysine-coated glasses and transfected. 24 h after transfection, cells were serum-starved for 4 h, washed, fixed, and analyzed by confocal microscopy. Capture of FRET images was performed as described previously (32Mochizuki N. Yamashita S. Kurokawa K. Ohba Y. Nagai T. Miyawaki A. Matsuda M. Nature. 2001; 411: 1065-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescent signals were registered using a laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM510, Zeiss). Imports of confocal images were made using the LSM510 software (Zeiss). Final processing of images was done with the Adobe PhotoShop (Adobe Systems) program.Integrin Activation—30 h after electroporation, Jurkat cells were purified away from cellular debri by centrifugation onto Ficoll-Hypaque medium gradients (Sigma), resuspended in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), and allowed to settle for 30 min onto 12-mm coverslips coated with 50 μg/ml poly-l-Lys (Sigma). Cells were then fixed in ice-cold 4% formaldehyde for 10 min and permeabilized by an incubation of 5 min with 0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline solution. Detection of doubly transfected cells was carried out by microscopic detection of EGFP fusion proteins and staining with biotinylated anti-FLAG (M2 clone) and Alexa350-conjugated streptavidin. To detect activation of β1 integrins, we performed staining experiments with the HUTS-21 monoclonal antibody (34Luque A. Gomez M. Puzon W. Takada Y. Sanchez-Madrid F. Cabanas C. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2045309711,"Molecular targets of inhaled anesthetics must be represented in the group that specifically bind these drugs, but the paucity of direct binding data has limited the number of candidates for further evaluation. To find candidate targets, we used a combination of photolabeling, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and mass spectrometry to identify halothane-binding targets in rat neuronal membranes. Of the 265 spots detected on the two-dimensional gels, 90 were labeled by [<sup>14</sup>C]halothane, and 34 were identified. Mitochondrial proteins, especially respiratory complex and voltage-dependent anion channels, dominated the labeled group, and there were several examples of subunit- and state-dependent binding. A significant correlation was found between internal protein cavities and binding in a group of proteins with high resolution structures. Therefore, in addition to identifying novel neuronal targets, these data suggest a general molecular feature, the buried cavity, as a dominant attribute of volatile anesthetic-binding sites found in a limited number of neuronal membrane proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2043146085,"Previous studies have suggested two possible roles for Rad9 in mammalian cells subjected to replication stress or DNA damage. One model suggests that a Rad9-containing clamp is loaded onto damaged DNA, where it participates in Chk1 activation and subsequent events that contribute to cell survival. The other model suggests that Rad9 translocates to mitochondria, where it triggers apoptosis by binding to and inhibiting Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. To further study the role of Rad9, parental and Rad9-/- murine embryonic stem (ES) cells were treated with camptothecin, etoposide, or cytarabine, all prototypic examples of three classes of widely used anticancer agents. All three agents induced Rad9 chromatin binding. Each of these agents also triggered S-phase checkpoint activation in parental ES cells, as indicated by a caffeine-inhibitable decrease in [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA and Cdc25A down-regulation. Interestingly, the ability of cytarabine to activate the S-phase checkpoint was severely compromised in Rad9-/- cells, whereas activation of this checkpoint by camptothecin and etoposide was unaltered, suggesting that the action of cytarabine is readily distinguished from that of classical topoisomerase poisons. Nonetheless, Rad9 deletion sensitized ES cells to the cytotoxic effects of all three agents, as evidenced by enhanced apoptosis and diminished colony formation. Collectively, these results suggest that the predominant role of Rad9 in ES cells is to promote survival after replicative stress and topoisomerase-mediated DNA damage.

Recent studies have suggested two possible roles for Rad9 after DNA damage. The first involves participation of Rad9 in a heterotrimeric clamp that is assembled on chromatin following replication stress or other types of DNA damage. When replication forks stall, the single-stranded DNA-binding protein replication protein A binds areas of single-stranded DNA (1Walter J. Newport J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 617-627Google Scholar, 2Lupardus P.J. Byun T. Yee M.C. Hekmat-Nejad M. Cimprich K.A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2327-2332Google Scholar, 3You Z. Kong L. Newport J. J. Biol.

Bound protein replication protein A facilitates the binding of the kinase ATR 1The abbreviations used are: ATR, mutated in ataxia telangiectasia (ATM)-Rad-3-related kinase; ES, embryonic stem; CPT, camptothecin; HEPES, N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N′-2-ethanesulfonic acid; UV, ultraviolet. and its binding partner ATR-interacting protein to chromatin (4Zou L. Elledge S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1542-1548Google Scholar). At the same time, a preassembled complex of Rad9, Hus1, and Rad1 (5Volkmer E. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 567-570Google Scholar, 6St. Onge R.P. Udell C.M. Casselman R. Davey S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1985-1995Google Scholar), known as the 9-1-1 complex, is loaded onto the damaged chromatin by a clamp loader consisting of Rad17 and the four replication factor C small subunits (7Zou L.

A. 2003; 100: 1633-1638Google Scholar). In a manner that remains poorly understood, the chromatin-bound 9-1-1 complex facilitates ATR-mediated phosphorylation and activation of Chk1 (reviewed in Ref. 9Melo J. Toczyski D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 237-245Google Scholar). Chk1 then phosphorylates (10Mailand N. Falck J. Lukas C. Syljuasen R.G. Welcker M. Bartek J. Lukas J. Science. 2000; 288: 1425-1429Google Scholar, 11Zhao H. Watkins J.L. Piwnica-Worms H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14795-14800Google Scholar, 12Shimuta K. Nakajo N. Uto K. Hayano Y.

Nature. 2003; 426: 87-91Google Scholar) Cdc25A, thereby abrogating the ability of this phosphatase to activate Cdk2/cyclin E complexes and drive S-phase progression (reviewed in Ref. 15Sagata N. Science. 2002; 298: 1905-1907Google Scholar). Chk1-mediated phosphorylation of Cdc25A and Cdc25C also prevents the activating dephosphorylation of Cdc2/cyclin B complexes and progression through G2 phase (reviewed in Ref. 16Rhind N. Russell P. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3889-3896Google Scholar). Based on these data, along with the observation that disruption of Chk1 function sensitizes cells to a wide range of genotoxic stresses (17Wang Q. Fan S. Eastman A. Worland P.J. Sausville E.A. O'Connor P.M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1996; 88: 956-965Google Scholar, 18Sarkaria J.N. Busby E.C. Tibbetts R.S. Roos P. Taya Y. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 713-723Google Scholar), one would predict that cells lacking Rad9 would be highly sensitive to replication stress and certain types of DNA damage. Additional studies have suggested a potential second function for Rad9. Based on the observation that a nine-amino acid sequence near the N terminus of Rad9 is similar to the BH3 domain of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members, it has been proposed that Rad9, like other BH3-only proteins (23Huang D.C.S. Strasser A. Cell. 2000; 103: 839-842Google Scholar), might traffic to mitochondria, bind to antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members, and facilitate apoptosis (24Komatsu K. Miyashita T. Hang H. Hopkins K.M. Zheng W. Cuddeback S. Yamada M. Lieberman H.B. Wang H.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 1-6Google Scholar). Consistent with this possibility, exogenous epitope-tagged Rad9 has been observed to translocate to mitochondria after DNA damage (24Komatsu K. Miyashita T. Hang H. Hopkins K.M. Zheng W. Cuddeback S. Yamada M. Lieberman H.B. Wang H.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 1-6Google Scholar, 25Yoshida K. Komatsu K. Wang H.G. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3292-3300Google Scholar), interact with Bcl-2 (24Komatsu K. Miyashita T. Hang H. Hopkins K.M. Zheng W. Cuddeback S. Yamada M. Lieberman H.B. Wang H.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 1-6Google Scholar) and Bcl-xL (25Yoshida K. Komatsu K. Wang H.G. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3292-3300Google Scholar), and induce apoptosis (24Komatsu K. Miyashita T. Hang H. Hopkins K.M. Zheng W. Cuddeback S. Yamada M. Lieberman H.B. Wang H.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 1-6Google Scholar, 25Yoshida K. Komatsu K. Wang H.G. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3292-3300Google Scholar). In agreement with this proposed role, Rad9 antisense oligonucleotides also reportedly diminish methyl methanesulfonate-induced apoptosis (24Komatsu K. Miyashita T. Hang H. Hopkins K.M. Zheng W. Cuddeback S. Yamada M. Lieberman H.B. Wang H.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 1-6Google Scholar). Collectively, these results suggest that Rad9 plays a critical role in the induction of apoptosis after replicative stress or genotoxic damage and lead to the prediction that Rad9 deletion might result in resistance to apoptosis. Among the agents that activate Chk1 are drugs that target DNA topoisomerases. Etoposide, a prototypic topoisomerase II poison (26Li T.K. Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 53-77Google Scholar), inhibits the religation steps in the topoisomerase II catalytic cycle, thereby stabilizing covalent DNA-topoisomerase II complexes that interact with helicases to produce frank DNA double-strand breaks (27Froelich-Ammon S.J. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21429-21432Google Scholar). Camptothecin, the founding member of a large class of topoisomerase I poisons (26Li T.K. Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 53-77Google Scholar, 28Slichenmyer W.J. Rowinsky E.K. Donehower R.C. Kaufmann S.H. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1993; 85: 271-291Google Scholar), inhibits the religation step of topoisomerase I (29Hsiang Y.-H. Hertzberg R. Hecht S. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14873-14878Google Scholar) to produce covalent topoisomerase I-DNA complexes (30Mattern M.R. Mong S.-M. Bartus H.F. Mirabelli C.K. Crooke S.T. Johnson R.K. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 1793-1798Google Scholar, 31Covey J.M. Jaxel C. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5016-5022Google Scholar) that likewise yield DNA double-strand breaks (32Avemann K. Knipper R. Koller T. Sogo J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3026-3034Google Scholar, 33Hsiang Y.-H. Lihou M.G. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5077-5082Google Scholar, 34Ryan A.J. Squires S. Strutt H.L. Johnson R.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3295-3300Google Scholar) after interaction with advancing replication forks (33Hsiang Y.-H. Lihou M.G. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5077-5082Google Scholar, 35Holm C. Covey J.M. Kerrigan D. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 6365-6368Google Scholar). More recently, it has been reported that cytarabine, a nucleoside analogue that is widely used to treat acute leukemias and lymphomas (36Chabner B.A. Chabner B.A. Longo D.L. Cancer Chemotherapy and Biotherapy. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1996: 213-233Google Scholar), might also act by trapping topoisomerase I-DNA covalent complexes after incorporation of the analogue into DNA (37Pourquier P. Takebayashi Y. Urasaki Y. Gioffre C. Kohlhagen G. Pommier Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1885-1890Google Scholar, 38Chrencik J.E. Burgin A.B. Pommier Y. Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12461-12466Google Scholar). Direct or indirect evidence has indicated that each of these prototypic anticancer agents also causes activation of Chk1 (19Shi Z. Azuma A. Sampath D. Li Y.X. Huang P. Plunkett W. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1065-1072Google Scholar, 20Sampath D. Shi Z. Plunkett W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 680-688Google Scholar, 21Shao R.G. Cao C.X. Shimizu T.

Chem. 2002; 277: 1599-1606Google Scholar), which ordinarily occurs in an ATR-dependent manner (39Cliby W.A. Lewis K.A. Lilly K.K. Kaufmann S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1599-1606Google Scholar, 40Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D. Tamai K. Luo G. Carattini-Rivera S. DeMayo F. Bradley A. Donehower L.A. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1448-1459Google Scholar). Because the ATR/Chk1 pathway is usually implicated in replicative stress, and whereas topoisomerase poisons induce DNA strand breaks, the exact roles of various DNA damage-activated signal transduction components in response to these agents remain to be more fully defined (41Sampath D. Plunkett W. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 2001; 13: 484-490Google Scholar, 42Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Google Scholar). To further evaluate the role of Rad9 in the response to topoisomerase poisons and replicative stress, we have now examined the effects of camptothecin, etoposide, and cytarabine in Rad9-/- ES cells and their wild-type counterparts. Results of this analysis failed to demonstrate any apoptotic defect in Rad9-deficient cells. To the contrary, deletion of this critical component of the checkpoint machinery sensitized cells to all three of the agents. Materials—Reagents were purchased from the following suppliers: camptothecin, cytarabine, paclitaxel, and 2-mercaptoethanol from Sigma; etoposide from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA); knock-out Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and l-glutamine from Invitrogen; and ES-GRO leukemia inhibitory factor from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). SN-38 was a kind gift from Pharmacia-Upjohn (Kalamazoo, MI). Antisera that recognize various antigens were obtained as follows: rabbit anti-phospho-Ser345-Chk1 and procaspase-3 from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA); and murine anti-Chk1, goat anti-actin, and murine anti-Cdc25A from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Other reagents were obtained as described previously (43Kottke T.J. Blajeski A.L. Meng X. Svingen P.A. Ruchaud S. Mesner Jr., P.W. Boerner S.A. Samejima K. Henriquez N.V. Chilcote T.J. Lord J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 24428-24437Google Scholar). Cell Lines and Tissue Culture—Rad9-/- ES cells, derived by targeted interruption of both murine Rad9 alleles, were generated and characterized by Kevin Hopkins, Wojtek Auerbach, Xiang Yuan Wang, M. Prakash Hande, Haiying Hang, Debra J. Wolgemuth, Alexandra L. Joyner, and Howard B. Lieberman, as described previously (44Roos-Mattjus P. Hopkins K.M. Vroman B.T. Johnson K.L. Naylor S. Lieberman H.B. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24428-24437Google Scholar). Stable Rad9-/- ES cell clones expressing human wild-type Rad9 or a Rad9 mutant in which eight phosphorylation sites were converted to alanine (Rad9-8A) were derived by transfection and selection as described (44Roos-Mattjus P. Hopkins K.M. Vroman B.T. Johnson K.L. Naylor S. Lieberman H.B. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24428-24437Google Scholar). ES cells were propagated on gelatinized tissue culture plates in knockout Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 15% ES cell qualified fetal bovine serum (Cell and Molecular Technologies, Inc, Phillipsburg, NJ), 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 2 mm l-glutamine, 10-4m 2-mercaptoethanol, and 103 units/ml leukemia inhibitory factor. To perform clonogenic assays, aliquots containing 400 ES cells were plated on gelatinized 60-mm dishes in triplicate and allowed to adhere for 4 h. Drugs or diluent were then added at the indicated final concentrations. After a 24-h incubation, drugs were removed, plates were washed, drug-free medium was added, and the cells were cultured for 7 days. Colonies were then stained with Coomassie Blue and counted. Survival was calculated as the percentage of colonies in dishes treated with drug compared with diluent. Chromatin Binding—Retention of 9-1-1 complexes was analyzed as described previously (45Burtelow M.A. Kaufmann S.H. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26343-26348Google Scholar). In brief, cells were treated with the indicated drug for 6 h. Alternatively, cells were irradiated with 15 J/m2 UV irradiation at 254 nm 6 h prior to harvest. After release by trypsinization, cells were sedimented at 1000 × g for 5 min, washed once with ice cold phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated for 10 min at 4 °C in low-salt permeabilization buffer consisting of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 nm microcystin-LR, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate. Nuclei were sedimented at 1000 × g for 5 min, washed with permeabilization buffer, and incubated for 10 min at 4 °C with high-salt nuclear extraction buffer consisting of 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 30 mm Na4P2 O7, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 nm microcystin-LR, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, a buffer that has a conductivity equivalent to a 250 mm NaCl solution. After centrifugation at 21,000 × g for 5 min to remove insoluble material, clarified lysates were either used for immunoprecipitation as indicated or mixed with ⅓ volume 4× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled for 10 min. Aliquots derived from equal amounts of protein as assayed by the method of Bradford (46Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) were separated by SDS-10% PAGE. After polypeptides were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) and subjected to immunoblotting as described (38Chrencik J.E. Burgin A.B. Pommier Y. Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12461-12466Google Scholar), bound antibodies were visualized by chemiluminescence (SuperSignal, Pierce). Checkpoint Assays—To assay the S-phase checkpoint, 1–2 × 104 cells were plated onto gelatinized 96-well plates and allowed to adhere for 16 h. After cells were incubated with the indicated drugs or diluent for 60 min at 37 °C, [methyl-3H]thymidine (TRA120, 5 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) was then added at 2 μCi/well. Cells were labeled for 20 min in the continued presence of drug or diluent, released by trypsinization, and harvested by transferring to glass filters using a Skatron semiautomatic harvester (Skatron Instruments AS, Lier, Norway). The filter-bound cells were lysed with distilled water. Filter-bound radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. [3H]Thymidine incorporation was calculated as the ratio of treated to control samples. Immunoblotting for phospho-Ser345-Chk1, Cdc25A, and total Chk1 and Chk2 was performed as described previously (44Roos-Mattjus P. Hopkins K.M. Vroman B.T. Johnson K.L. Naylor S. Lieberman H.B.

Apoptosis Assays—For morphological analyses, adherent cells were released by trypsinization, pooled with nonadherent cells, sedimented at 200 × g for 10 min, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed for a minimum of 12 h in 3:1 methanol:acetic acid. Samples were then deposited on glass coverslips, air-dried, stained with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33258, and examined by fluorescence microscopy as described previously (49Arnt C.R. Chiorean M.V. Heldebrant M.P. Gores G.J. Kaufmann S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44236-44243Google Scholar). A minimum of 400 cells/sample were scored for apoptotic changes (chromatin condensation or nuclear fragmentation). Samples were photographed using a Zeiss Axioplan microscope equipped with a numerical aperture 1.40 × 63 objective, a 365-nm excitation filter, and a 420-nm emission filter. Alternatively, cleavage of caspase substrates was assessed by immunoblotting. Whole cell lysates were prepared in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride under reducing conditions as described previously (43Kottke T.J. Blajeski A.L. Meng X. Svingen P.A. Ruchaud S. Mesner Jr., P.W. Boerner S.A. Samejima K. Henriquez N.V. Chilcote T.J. Lord J. Salmon M. Earnshaw W.C. Kaufmann S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 804-815Google Scholar). Aliquots containing 50 μg of total cellular protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE on gels with 5–15% (w/v) acrylamide gradients, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed as described previously (43Kottke T.J. Blajeski A.L. Meng X. Svingen P.A. Ruchaud S. Mesner Jr., P.W. Boerner S.A. Samejima K. Henriquez N.V. Chilcote T.J. Lord J. Salmon M. Earnshaw W.C. Kaufmann S.H. J. Biol.

Drug-induced Rad9 Chromatin Binding—In light of previous studies showing that the ATR/Chk1 pathway plays a critical role in survival of cells after many genotoxic stresses, including topoisomerase poisons (reviewed in Refs. 22Zachos G. Rainey M.D. Gillespie D.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 713-723Google Scholar, 39Cliby W.A. Lewis K.A. Lilly K.K. Kaufmann S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1599-1606Google Scholar, 40Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 5600-5605Google Scholar), we assessed the role of the Chk1 regulator Rad9 in the response to camptothecin, etoposide, cytarabine, and, as a control, UV light. To evaluate recruitment of Rad9 to chromatin after treatment with these agents, Rad9 chromatin binding was assessed by differential extraction followed by immunoblotting (44Roos-Mattjus P. Hopkins K.M. Vroman B.T. Johnson K.L. Naylor S. Lieberman H.B. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24428-24437Google Scholar) in K562 human leukemia cells, which were extensively utilized in previous studies of 9-1-1 chromatin binding (45Burtelow M.A. Kaufmann S.H. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26343-26348Google Scholar), and murine ES cells. As shown in Fig. 1, submicromolar concentrations of each agent induced increased binding of Rad9 to chromatin. It is worth noting that Rad9 chromatin binding occurs within 6 h of treatment with drug concentrations that kill less than 1 log of cells (see below). Moreover, these submicromolar drug concentrations are readily achievable in the clinical setting (28Slichenmyer W.J. Rowinsky E.K. Donehower R.C. Kaufmann S.H. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1993; 85: 271-291Google Scholar, 36Chabner B.A. Chabner B.A. Longo D.L. Cancer Chemotherapy and Biotherapy. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1996: 213-233Google Scholar, 53Pommier Y. Fesen M.R. Goldwasser F. Chabner B.A. Longo D.L. Cancer Chemotherapy and Biotherapy. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 435-461Google Scholar). 2Drug concentrations in the following ranges were observed during clinical trials: camptothecin, 3-40 μm 24 h after a single dose (70Gottlieb J.A. Guarino A.M. Call J.B. Oliverio V.T. Block J.B. Cancer Chemother. Rep. 1970; 54: 461-470Google Scholar); cytarabine, up to 5 μm for 3 days during high dose infusions (36Chabner B.A. Chabner B.A. Longo D.L. Cancer Chemotherapy and Biotherapy. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1996: 213-233Google Scholar); etoposide, peak levels averaging 85 μm for 3 consecutive days in the bone marrow transplant setting (71Hande K.R. Wedlund P.J. Noone R.M. Wilkinson G.R. Greco F.A. Wolff S.N. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 379-382Google Scholar). Drug-induced Phosphorylation of Chk1 and Chk2 in Parental and Rad9-/- ES Cells—Rad9 is required for Chk1 activation induced by ionizing radiation, UV light, and the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor hydroxyurea (44Roos-Mattjus P. Hopkins K.M. Vroman B.T. Johnson K.L. Naylor S. Lieberman H.B. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24428-24437Google Scholar). To determine whether Rad9 also participates in Chk1 activation induced by the anticancer drugs used in Fig. 1, we assessed Chk1 phosphorylation on Ser345, a modification that is catalyzed by ATR and is required for Chk1 activation (40Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D. Tamai K. Luo G. Carattini-Rivera S. DeMayo F. Bradley A. Donehower L.A. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1448-1459Google Scholar, 54Zhao H. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4129-4139Google Scholar). These studies examined parental ES cells, which express Rad9, and Rad9-/- ES cells lacking Rad9 (Fig. 2A). Like UV light, all three chemotherapy agents induced robust Chk1 phosphorylation in the parental ES cells (Fig. 2B). In contrast, induction of Chk1 phosphorylation by cytarabine was almost abolished in Rad9-/- cells, and induction of Chk1 phosphorylation by etoposide or camptothecin was markedly diminished (Fig. 2B). To evaluate whether Rad9 is also required for activation of Chk2 by these agents, we examined a Chk2 mobility shift that is due to regulatory phosphorylation and is tightly correlated with Chk2 activation (55Matsuoka S. Huang M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1998; 282: 1893-1897Google Scholar, 56Feijoo C. Hall-Jackson C. Wu R. Jenkins D. Leitch J. Gilbert D.M. Smythe C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 913-923Google Scholar). Fig. 2B shows that Chk2 was weakly phosphorylated after treatment of parental cells by camptothecin, etoposide, or UV light (Fig. 2B, lanes 3–5). This phosphorylation was more prominent after treatment of Rad9-/- cells with the same genotoxins (Fig. 2B, lanes 8–10), perhaps as a consequence of defective Chk1 activation. In contrast, Chk2 phosphorylation was not detectable after cytarabine treatment in either parental or Rad9-/- cells (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 7), indicating a dichotomy in cellular responses triggered by cytarabine and the classical topoisomerase poisons. S-phase Checkpoint Activation in Rad9-/- ES Cells—Previous studies using Chk1-deficient cells and pharmacologic Chk1 inhibitors have shown that Chk1 plays an essential role in the activation of the S-phase checkpoint by ionizing radiation and agents that disrupt DNA replication (20Sampath D. Shi Z. Plunkett W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 680-688Google Scholar, 56Feijoo C. Hall-Jackson C. Wu R. Jenkins D. Leitch J. Gilbert D.M. Smythe C. J.

Correspondingly, Rad9 and Hus1, which are essential for optimal Chk1 activation, are also required for activation of the S-phase checkpoint by agents that disrupt DNA replication (44Roos-Mattjus P. Hopkins K.M. Vroman B.T. Johnson K.L. Naylor S. Lieberman H.B. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24428-24437Google Scholar, 59Weiss R.S. Matsuoka S. Elledge S.J. Leder P. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 73-77Google Scholar). Paradoxically, however, neither Rad9 nor Hus1 is required for activation of the S-phase checkpoint triggered by ionizing radiation (44Roos-Mattjus P. Hopkins K.M. Vroman B.T. Johnson K.L. Naylor S. Lieberman H.B. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24428-24437Google Scholar, 60Weiss R.S. Enoch T. Leder P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1886-1898Google Scholar). To determine whether Rad9 participates in activation of the S-phase checkpoint by topoisomerase poisons, which, like ionizing radiation, also induce double-strand breaks, parental and Rad9-/- cells were treated with drugs for 1 h and pulsed with radiolabeled thymidine in the continued presence of the drugs for 20 min. Treatment of parental ES cells with 50 nm cytarabine, 500 nm camptothecin, or 500 nm etoposide diminished thymidine incorporation into DNA by 35–45% (Fig. 3A, white bars). Pretreatment of parental cells with 3 mm caffeine, a well characterized checkpoint disrupter (18Sarkaria J.N. Busby E.C. Tibbetts R.S. Roos P. Taya Y. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4375-4382Google Scholar, 61Lau C.C. Pardee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2942-2946Google Scholar), prior to addition of the anticancer drugs, restored thymidine incorporation almost to control levels (Fig. 3A, black bars). These results indicate that the decreased thymidine incorporation represented checkpoint activation rather than physical blockage of replication forks. Analysis of thymidine incorporation in Rad9-/- ES cells revealed that the cytarabine-induced S-phase checkpoint was absent in cells lacking Rad9 (Fig. 3B, white bar). In contrast, in Rad9-/- cells treated with camptothecin or etoposide, the S-phase checkpoint response was nearly identical to that observed in parental cells. Consistent with the results of these thymidine incorporation assays, immunoblotting demonstrated that Cdc25A depletion after a 3-h cytarabine treatment or UV irradiation was Rad9-dependent, whereas Cdc25A depletion after a 3-h camptothecin or etoposide treatment was not (Fig. 3C). Collectively, these results demonstrate that Rad9 does not play a role in the S-phase checkpoint activated by the topoisomerase inhibitors, similar to the results seen with ionizing radiation. Moreover, they provide a second difference between the effects of topoisomerase poisons and cytarabine.

https://openalex.org/W2118496918,"Hyaluronan (HA) is a linear glycosaminoglycan of the vertebrate extracellular matrix that is synthesized at the plasma membrane by the HA synthase (HAS) enzymes HAS1, -2 and -3. The regulation of HA synthesis has been implicated in a variety of extracellular matrix-mediated and pathological processes, including renal fibrosis. We have recently described the genomic structures of each of the human HAS genes. In the present study, we analyzed the HAS2 promoter region. In 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends analysis of purified mRNA from human renal epithelial proximal tubular cells, we detected an extended sequence for HAS2 exon 1, relocating the transcription initiation site 130 nucleotides upstream of the reference HAS2 mRNA sequence, GenBank™ accession number NM_005328. A luciferase reporter gene assay of nested fragments spanning the 5′ terminus of NM_005328 demonstrated the constitutive promoter activity of sequences directly upstream of the repositioned transcription initiation site but not of the newly designated exonic nucleotides. Using reverse transcription-PCR, expression of this extended HAS2 mRNA was demonstrated in a variety of human cell types, and orthologous sequences were detected in mouse and rat kidney. Alignment of human, murine, and equine genomic DNA sequences upstream of the repositioned HAS2 exon 1 provided evidence for the evolutionary conservation of specific transcription factor binding sites. The location of the HAS2 promoter will facilitate analysis of the transcriptional regulation of this gene in a variety of pathological contexts as well as in developmental models in which HAS2 null animals have an embryonic lethal phenotype.

Previous reports from this and other laboratories have demonstrated the importance of HA metabolism in clinical nephrology. End stage renal failure is most frequently characterized by progressive interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (10Strutz F. Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2001; 10: 1989-2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and increased expression of HA in the renal corticointerstitium is associated with this progression (11Jones S.G. Ito T.

Scand. 2001; 173: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In high glucose concentrations, which mimic diabetic nephropathy, renal proximal tubular epithelial cells synthesize high levels of HA, which is coincident with specific up-regulation of transcription at the HAS2 locus (13Jones S.G. Jones S. Phillips A.O. Kidney Int. 2001; 59: 1739-1749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The mesothelial cells that line the peritoneal membrane synthesize HA as a normal constituent of human peritoneal effluent, and this synthesis is up-regulated during periods of peritonitis in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (14Yung S. Davies M. Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 1337-1343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In an in vitro model of peritoneal wound healing (15Yung S. Davies M. Kidney Int. 1998; 54: 2160-2169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the mechanical disruption of human peritoneal mesothelial cell monolayers led to increased levels of HAS2 mRNA transcription together with an increase in HA synthesis (16Yung S. Thomas G.J. Davies M. Kidney Int. 2000; 58: 1953-1962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently described the genomic structures of the human HAS genes (17Monslow J. Williams J.D. Norton N. Guy C.A. Price I.K. Coleman S.L. Williams N.M. Buckland P.R. Spicer A.P. Topley N. Davies M. Bowen T. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 1272-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and demonstrated that ∼500 bp upstream of each HAS reference mRNA sequence showed constitutive promoter activity in a high-throughput luciferase analysis system (18Coleman, S.

Buckland P.R. O'Donovan M.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 2249-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The sequence upstream of HAS2 was the least active in this assay but still conformed to our criteria for promoter activity (18Coleman, S. L., Buckland, P. R., Hoogendoorn, B., Guy, C. A., Smith, S. K., and O'Donovan, M. C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 11, 1817–1821Google Scholar). In the present study, we describe further investigation of the transcriptional regulation of the HAS2 gene. Data from 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) analysis revealed that the HAS2 transcription initiation site (TIS) was situated 130 bp upstream of the 5′ terminus of reference mRNA sequence NM_005328, thus extending HAS2 exon 1 (see Ref. 17Monslow J. Williams J.D. Norton N. Guy C.A. Price I.K. Coleman S.L. Williams N.M. Buckland P.R. Spicer A.P. Topley N. Davies M. Bowen T. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 1272-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The results of luciferase reporter gene analysis of a nested set of constructs spanning the region directly upstream of NM_005328 concurred with these findings. Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis confirmed the expression of this extended HAS2 exon 1 in selected renal and other human cell types, including primary human peritoneal mesothelial cells, together with murine kidney RNAs. Alignment of human, murine, and equine genomic DNA (gDNA) sequences upstream of the repositioned HAS2 TIS revealed the presence of putative Sp1, NF-Y/CCAAT, and NF-κB sites common to all HAS2 orthologues, suggesting evolutionary conservation of HAS2 transcriptional regulation. Cell Culture—A variety of human cells was used in the present study. Culture conditions for renal proximal tubular HK-2 (20Phillips A.O. Steadman R. Topley N. Williams J.D. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 362-374PubMed Google Scholar), lung fibroblast AG02222 (21Clayton A. Evans R.A. Pettit E. Hallett M. Williams J.D. Steadman R. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 442-453Google Scholar), medulloblastoma TE-671, and renal embryonic HEK293t cell lines (18Coleman, S. L., Buckland, P. R., Hoogendoorn, B., Guy, C. A., Smith, S.

Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 1337-1343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) have been described previously. 5′-RACE—mRNA was isolated from total RNA extracts using magnetic Oligo(dT)25 Dynabeads (Dynal, Bromborough, Wirral, UK) prior to 5′-RACE analysis using the SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (BD Biosciences) together with HAS2-specific oligonucleotide primers (all oligonucleotides from Invitrogen; see Fig. 1 for primer sequence data) according to the manufacturer's instructions. An aliquot of the reaction products generated with a primer binding at the RACE site was used as the template for a nested reaction primed from the RACE-N site, as recommended by the manufacturer. Reaction products were analyzed by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis, purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen Ltd., Crawley, West Sussex, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions, T-cloned into vector pCR-TOPO2.1 (Invitrogen), and sequenced using Big Dye terminator chemistry (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, Cheshire, UK) and M13 primers. The HAS2 proximal promoter sequence was analyzed using the MatInspector professional transcription factor binding site (TFBS) identification software (22Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2419) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1 for putative TFBSs). Luciferase Analysis—A nested set of HAS2 promoter fragments was created by PCR amplification using the oligonucleotide sequences shown in Fig. 1. In each case, the sense-strand primer was tailed with a KpnI restriction endonuclease recognition sequence, the single antisense-strand primer bearing a corresponding HindIII site. PCR amplification of promoter fragments was carried out from gDNA by standard means (23Bowen T. Norton N. Jacobsen N.J. Guy C.A. Daniels J.K. Sanders R.D. Cardno A.G. Jones L.A. Murphy K.C. McGuffin P. Craddock N. O'Donovan M.C. Owen M.J. Mol. Psychiatry. 1998; 3: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). PCR products were gel-purified as described above, digested (restriction endonucleases were from New England Biolabs, Hitchin, Hertfordshire, UK), cloned into a modified pGL-3 luciferase reporter vector (17Monslow J. Williams J.D. Norton N. Guy C.A. Price I.K. Coleman S.L. Williams N.M. Buckland P.R. Spicer A.P. Topley N. Davies M. Bowen T. Int. J. Biochem.

The ability of each HAS2 promoter fragment to drive transcription of the luciferase gene was tested transiently in human cell lines HEK293t and TE-671 as described in detail previously (17Monslow J.

The growth medium used was a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 nutrient mixture without l-glutamine (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20 mm HEPES and 2 mm l-glutamine (both from Invitrogen) together with 5 ng/ml sodium selenite, 5 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, and 0.4 μg/ml hydrocortisone (all from Sigma). RT-PCR—RT-PCR was carried out from total RNA extracted from a range of human cells using TRI Reagent (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was reverse-transcribed from 1 μg of total RNA using Superscript II RNase H– reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamers (100 μm) (Amersham Biosciences), as recommended by the manufacturer. RT-PCR primers were designed to amplify the extended 5′-UTR identified in the present study. As shown in Fig. 1, the Prom-RT-PCR-F binding site was positioned within 5′-RACE Band 2 and spanned positions 54–75 from the new TIS, amplifying 77 nucleotides of sequence upstream of the transcription start site described previously in NM_005328. Prom-RT-PCR-R primed within HAS2 exon 2. Gene-specific PCR reactions were performed using 2 μl of RT reaction product in a total volume of 50 μl comprising 1× PCR buffer containing 1.5 mm MgCl2 (Applied Biosystems), 0.2 mm dNTPs (Amersham Biosciences), 2.5 units of Amplitaq Gold Taq polymerase (Applied Biosystems), and 1 μm oligonucleotide PCR primers. A denaturation step of 94 °C for 2 min was followed by 38 cycles comprising 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 65 °C, and 90 s at 68 °C, after which cycling was concluded with a final extension step of 15 min at 68 °C. Reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose. The sequences of the HAS2 RT-PCR primers used routinely in our laboratory (and not given above) were sense-strand H2-F primer, 5′-CATAAAGAAAGCTCGCAACACG-3′ (positions 1025–1046 in NM_005328), and antisense-strand oligonucleotide H2-R, 5′-ACTGCTGAGGAATGAGATCCAG-3′ (1287–1308). Extended 5′-UTRs were amplified from total RNA from mouse and rat kidneys (Ambion Europe Ltd., Cambridgeshire, UK) using primers specific to the corresponding region of the mouse (GenBank™ accession number NM_008216) and rat (GenBank™ accession number NM_013153) HAS2 mRNAs. Where appropriate, reaction products were processed for sequencing as described above. DNA Sequence Alignment and Data Base Analysis—Alignments for the genomic sequences upstream of HAS2 from human (clone RP11–3G20, sequence AC104233), mouse (clone RP24–147N23, sequence AC140799), rat (clone CH230–228F12, sequence AC105559), and horse (AF508308) (24Stock A.E. Bouchard N. Brown K. Spicer A.P. Underhill C.B. Dore M. Sirois J. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 4375-4384Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) were carried out using the ClustalW algorithm at the European Bioinformatics Institute (www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/index.html).

Genome Res. 2002; 12: 656-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (5982) Google Scholar) analyses were carried out comparing the above HAS2 sequences against expressed data from a range of organisms in the expressed sequence tag (EST) data base at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/Blast.cgi and the genome browser at genome.ucsc.edu/. Statistical Analysis of Luciferase Assay Data—Data for each luciferase construct were calculated and plotted graphically as either the -fold increase of luciferase activity compared with the promoterless control vector (C) (18Coleman, S. L., Buckland, P. R., Hoogendoorn, B., Guy, C. A., Smith, S. K., and O'Donovan, M. C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 11, 1817–1821Google Scholar) or as a percentage of the luciferase activity of construct F3. Where appropriate, statistical analysis was performed using Friedman's two-way analysis of variance test from SPSS 11.5 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). 5′-RACE Analysis of the HAS2 Gene Using Purified mRNA—Agarose gel electrophoresis resolved the 5′-RACE-nested reaction products into the two principal bands shown in Fig. 2, which were then cloned. Sequence analysis of three randomly selected Band 1 transformants revealed that each insert terminated at a different 5′-terminal nucleotide, as highlighted in Fig. 2. The longest of these inserts extended the HAS2 5′-UTR of NM_005328 by 49 bp. Corresponding analysis of transformants from the discrete Band 2 resulted in a single cloned product, which extended 130 bp upstream of NM_005328 (see Figs. 1 and 2). This has now been submitted to the GenBank™/EBI Data Bank with the accession number AJ604570. These results were replicated in analysis using mRNA from HK-2, TE-671, and HEK293t cells (data not shown). No bands corresponding to the predicted size of the product from sequence NM_005328 were detected (Fig. 2). Analysis of Luciferase Activity of Sequences Upstream of NM_005328 and AJ604570 —Luciferase assay data are shown in Fig. 3. From initial screening of the gDNA upstream of NM_005328, Fig. 3A shows that both cell lines produced a bipartite distribution, the difference between low scoring constructs C, F1, and F2 and the high readings for F3–F10 being highly significant (p < 0.001). The significance of the variation of luciferase activity in promoter fragments F1 and F2 compared with C was equivocal. A marginal increase significant at the p < 0.05 level in TE-671 cells contrasted with a decrease significant at p < 0.01 in HEK293t cells. On the basis of the above findings, the sequence immediately upstream of AJ604570 and spanned by the insert in construct F3 was analyzed in detail. MatInspector analysis (22Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2419) Google Scholar) highlighted one NF-Y/CCAAT motif at –80 and Sp1 sites at –60 (Sp1–5′) and –40 (Sp1–3′) (Fig. 1). Nested constructs spanning this region were cloned, along with a Minimal promoter fragment comprising 28 bp upstream of the revised HAS2 TIS (Fig. 1). The luciferase data from these constructs are plotted in Fig. 3B as a percentage of the activity of the F3 construct. In each cell line, there was an incremental rise in luciferase activity as the insert size increased, demonstrating that this sequence was functionally active as a promoter. RT-PCR—The results of RT-PCR analysis are shown in Fig. 4. Despite differences in intensity, evidence of transcription of an AJ604570-specific extended HAS2 5′-UTR was detected in each of the cell types assayed. Primers Prom-RT-PCR-F and -R (Fig. 1) amplified the larger product spanning 686 bp in Fig. 1, specific to sequence AJ604570 and comprising the 5′-UTR and the N-terminal amino acid codons of HAS2. The smaller band of 282 bp amplified codons from the glycosyltransferase domain of HAS2 using primers H2-F and -R. To obviate the possibility of amplification from contaminating gDNA, both sets of RT-PCR primers amplified across one or more intron/exon boundaries spanning at least 11.5 kbp of intronic sequence (17Monslow J. Williams J.D. Norton N. Guy C.A. Price I.K. Coleman S.L. Williams N.M. Buckland P.R. Spicer A.P. Topley N. Davies M. Bowen T. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 1272-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Orthologous products from the total RNA of mouse and rat kidneys were also amplified. In no case was the message for either 5′-RACE Band 1 mRNA or NM_005328 detected in the absence of AJ604570 (data not shown). DNA Sequence Alignment and Data Base Analysis—Fig. 5 shows a nucleotide sequence alignment from 200 bp upstream of the 5′ terminus of AJ604570 to 150 bp downstream and includes the TISs of the reference mRNA sequences for HAS2 orthologues from human, mouse, rat, and horse. A high level of sequence similarity was evident throughout the majority of the alignment, most clearly between positions –100 and +100. With respect to TFBSs, sequence similarity was seen at the NF-κB site at approximately –150; the NF-Y/CCAAT element at –80 and the Sp1–5′ site at –60. Similarity was also evident at the core motif of the Sp1–3′ site at –40 in both murine sequences, the remainder of this region being absent. In the equine orthologue, positions –8 to –51 surrounding Sp1–3′ were absent. The longest available ESTs from human (CD654109), mouse (BY110777), and bovine HAS2 (AW429456) terminated upstream of their reference mRNA sequences. The importance of HA metabolism in a multiplicity of biological and pathological contexts is becoming increasingly evident and an understanding of the mechanisms controlling its synthesis ever more desirable.

Kidney Int. 2000; 58: 1953-1962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently described the genomic structures of the human HAS genes (17Monslow J. Williams J.D. Norton N. Guy C.A. Price I.K. Coleman S.L. Williams N.M. Buckland P.R. Spicer A.P. Topley N. Davies M. Bowen T. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 1272-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and, in the present study, set out to investigate further the HAS2 promoter region. Previously, we carried out 5′-RACE analysis on HAS2 from total RNA (17Monslow J. Williams J.D. Norton N. Guy C.A. Price I.K. Coleman S.L. Williams N.M. Buckland P.R. Spicer A.P. Topley N. Davies M. Bowen T. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 1272-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the present study, mRNA was purified from HK-2, HEK293t, and TE-671 cells and used as the template for 5′-RACE reactions. Because no products of the predicted size for NM_005328 were recovered, it appears that this data base entry is 5′-truncated. A significant number of similarly truncated sequences are deposited in the public data bases (18Coleman, S. L., Buckland, P. R., Hoogendoorn, B., Guy, C. A., Smith, S. K., and O'Donovan, M. C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 11, 1817–1821Google Scholar), because imperfect methodologies for creating libraries have generated incomplete cDNAs (36Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC) Program TeamProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16899-16903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). Each of the 5′-RACE products from Band 1 terminated at a different nucleotide ∼50 bp upstream of NM_005328 and 80 bp downstream of the single 5′ terminus of Band 2. This suggests that Band 1 products were prematurely terminated, possibly due to a strong secondary structure in the HAS2 5′-UTR, as discussed below. We have shown a high throughput luciferase system to be sensitive, accurate, and reproducible in analyses of a large number of human promoters, including naturally occurring polymorphic promoter variants (18Coleman, S. L., Buckland, P. R., Hoogendoorn, B., Guy, C. A., Smith, S. K., and O'Donovan, M. C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 11, 1817–1821Google Scholar, 19Hoogendoorn B. Coleman S.L. Guy C.A. Smith K. Bowen T. Buckland P.R. O'Donovan M.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 2249-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). This system was used to establish our quantitative definition of promoter activity at 10 times that of the promoterless vector control value (i.e. 10 × C) (18Coleman, S. L., Buckland, P. R., Hoogendoorn, B., Guy, C. A., Smith, S. K., and O'Donovan, M. C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 11, 1817–1821Google Scholar) and demonstrated that 500 bp of gDNA immediately upstream of the reference mRNA sequence of each HAS isoform had basal promoter activity (17Monslow J. Williams J.D. Norton N. Guy C.A. Price I.K. Coleman S.L. Williams N.M. Buckland P.R. Spicer A.P. Topley N. Davies M. Bowen T. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 1272-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have used this system to analyze the ability of a number of HAS2 promoter constructs to drive luciferase transcription in a human renal (HEK293t) and human medulloblastoma (TE-671) cell line (17Monslow J. Williams J.D. Norton N. Guy C.A. Price I.K. Coleman S.L. Williams N.M. Buckland P.R. Spicer A.P. Topley N. Davies M. Bowen T. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 1272-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 18Coleman, S. L., Buckland, P. R., Hoogendoorn, B., Guy, C. A., Smith, S. K., and O'Donovan, M. C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 11, 1817–1821Google Scholar, 19Hoogendoorn B. Coleman S.L. Guy C.A. Smith K. Bowen T. Buckland P.R. O'Donovan M.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 2249-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In addition, we have used Friedman's two-way analysis of variance test to compare the significance of the variation in promoter activity with our previously established criterion of luciferase activity. Luciferase activity data (Fig. 3A) provided highly significant evidence that promoter function was restricted to constructs F3–F10 clustered ∼250 bp upstream of the 5′ terminus of HAS2 reference mRNA sequence NM_005328. In TE-671 cells, these constructs also exceeded our previously stated threshold for promoter activity (18Coleman, S. L., Buckland, P. R., Hoogendoorn, B., Guy, C. A., Smith, S. K., and O'Donovan, M. C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 11, 1817–1821Google Scholar). There was suggestive evidence for a significant increase in luciferase activity of constructs F1 and F2 in TE-671 cells, but this was contradicted by a significant decrease in activity for these constructs in HEK293t cells (Fig. 3A) and fell below our previous threshold in both cell lines. It thus appeared that the sequence directly upstream of NM_005328 was not active in our promoter assay. It was also seen that, in the absence of stimulation, basal promoter activity was approximately consistent for F3–F10. An overall decrease in activity in larger vectors is seen in Fig. 3A, but because this system was optimized for 500-bp inserts, we cannot discount the possibility that insert size might affect luciferase activity and are currently investigating this possibility. The luciferase activity of constructs immediately upstream of AJ604570 showed an incremental increase in luciferase activity, reaching a maximum at construct F3 as predicted from our previous data (see Fig. 3A). Once again, higher relative activities were obtained in TE-671 cells, but in each case the ability of constructs containing larger inserts to drive luciferase transcription was demonstrated. Considering the 5′-RACE results in the light of the luciferase assay data, constructs F1 and F2 contained inserts spanning 74 and 130 nucleotides, respectively, upstream of NM_005328, with F2 also spanning ∼80 bp upstream from 5′-RACE Band 1. If transcription were initiated at either of these positions, the inserts in the respective vectors would contain sufficient proximal upstream sequence to contain core promoter elements and the binding site for RNA polymerase II (37Nikolov D.B. Burley S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). They would thus be expected to drive luciferase transcription in the manner in which we demonstrated for sequences upstream of AJ604570 (Fig. 3B). Comparison of each putative TIS with the consensus sequence YYANWYY (where Y = pyrimidine; W = A or T) described for transcription initiator elements between positions –2 and +5 (38Smale S.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1351: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) showed that only AJ604570 (Fig. 1) concurred fully with this or the key nucleotide consensus –2Y, +1A, and +3 W (38Smale S.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1351: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). The combined data thus suggest very strongly that the 5′ terminus of 5′-RACE Band 2 (sequence AJ604570) represents the TIS of the HAS2 gene, and the promoter lies upstream of this site. Exon 1 of the human HAS2 gene forms a discrete 5′-UTR, with the methionine codon at the 5′ terminus of exon 2 initiating translation (17Monslow J. Williams J.D. Norton N. Guy C.A. Price I.K. Coleman S.L. Williams N.M. Buckland P.R. Spicer A.P. Topley N. Davies M. Bowen T. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 1272-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar); sequence AJ604570 extends this first exon to 669 bp (Fig. 1). Approximately 10% of mRNAs contain such complex 5′-UTRs and frequently encode regulatory proteins that may be subject to post-transcriptional regulation (39Grobe K. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30699-30706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 40van der Velden A.W. Thomas A.A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 87-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this level of control is evident in certain key genes during embryonic development (40van der Velden A.W. Thomas A.A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 87-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), and HAS2 knockout animals have an embryonic lethal phenotype (30Camenisch T.D. McDonald J.A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 23: 431-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Untranslated AUG (uAUG) motifs and/or secondary structure in excess of –50 kcal/mol in a complex 5′-UTR inhibit significantly the process of cap-dependent ribosomal scanning prior to the initiation of translation (39Grobe K. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30699-30706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 40van der Velden A.W. Thomas A.A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 87-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Our extended HAS2 exon 1 contains one uAUG motif at +650, 20 bp upstream of the predicted translation initiation site (Fig. 1) and not within a Kozak consensus signal (41Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4147) Google Scholar); thus its functional effect may be limited (39Grobe K. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30699-30706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Analysis of our extended HAS2 exon 1 sequence using software at the MFOLD web server (www.bioinfo.rpi.edu/applications/mfold) and default parameters (42Zuker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (9956) Google Scholar) gave a range of free energies of folding between –129.4 and –134.9 kcal/mol. We thus found evidence for post-transcriptional control of HAS2 expression and a possible mechanism for premature termination of 5′-RACE products downstream of the HAS2 TIS. RT-PCR showed that the extended HAS2 exon 1 was expressed in two human renal cell lines and total RNAs from murine kidney, as well as outside the kidney in a human lung fibroblast cell line and in primary human peritoneal mesothelial cells. RT-PCR products specific for either AJ604570 (5′-RACE Band 1) or for NM_005328 were detected throughout, and thus no evidence for transcript 5′ length variation was found. There is evidence for a natural antisense mRNA synthesized from the opposite gDNA strand to HAS2, and that includes the complementary sequence to the HAS2 TIS (HASNT). 2H. Chao and A. P. Spicer, unpublished data. Because this is a potential confounder of molecular biological analysis of this locus, we designed primers to amplify trans-intronic HAS2-specific RT-PCR products. Alignment of gDNA sequences surrounding the 5′ terminus of AJ604570 for human, murine, and equine HAS2 loci illustrated the high similarity suggested previously (24Stock A.E. Bouchard N. Brown K. Spicer A.P. Underhill C.B. Dore M. Sirois J. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 4375-4384Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 provides evidence for the evolutionary conservation of the TFBSs Sp1–5′, NF-Y/CCAAT, and NF-κB but not Sp1–3′. However, the above luciferase data did not show a large increase in activity in response to the addition of any one of these motifs, and further analysis will be required to confirm the role of these or other sites within this region. The EST data suggested that 5′-truncated sequences for human, mouse, and bovine HAS2 orthologues were deposited in the NCBI data base. In summary, we have identified the TIS of the human HAS2 gene 130 bp upstream of the 5′ terminus of the reference HAS2 mRNA sequence deposited in the public data bases. Expression of our extended HAS2 5′-UTR sequence in human and murine kidney and in other human cells was detected. We suggest that, because of the high secondary structure of complex 5′-UTRs, the reference sequences for several HAS2 orthologues may also have 5′ truncations and that HAS2 may be subject to post-transcriptional regulation. Furthermore, we provide evidence for the evolutionary conservation of transcriptional regulatory elements upstream of our repositioned HAS2 TIS in human, murine, and equine genomic DNAs."

A part of the stalk penetrates inside this cavity and is displaced toward an A-B-A triplet. To investigate further the topology of the stalk subunits C-F in A1, cross-linking has been carried out by using dithiobis[sulfosuccinimidylpropionate] (DSP) and 1-ethyl-3-(dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC).

The subunit-subunit interaction in the presence of DSP was also studied as a function of nucleotide binding, demonstrating movements of subunits C, D, and F during ATP cleavage.

Methanogenic, halophilic, and thermophilic Archaea synthesize ATP by means of ion gradient-driven phosphorylation. Although it was speculated for some time, due to the lack of indepth information, that the ATP synthases of Archaea may be either F1F0- or V1V0-like enzymes, it is now clear that they evolved as a separate class of ATPases/ATP synthases, the A1A0-ATPase/synthases (1Müller V. Grüber G. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 474-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 2Grüber G. Wieczorek H. Harvey W.R. Müller V. J. Exp.

Qsawa S. Mijata T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9355-9359Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). This class of enzymes is different from F1F0- or V1V0-ATPases by function, subunit composition, regulation, and structure (1Müller V. Grüber G. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 474-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The A1A0-ATPase has at least nine subunits (A3:B3:C:D:E:F:H:I:Kx), but the actual subunit stoichiometry, especially regarding the proteolipid subunits K in AATPases, is different in various organisms (12, 6, 4 or, as suggested by genomic data, only 1 (5Müller V. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2004; 36: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar)). As suggested by its bipartite name, the A1A0-ATPase is composed of a water-soluble A1-ATPase and an integral membrane subcomplex, A0. ATP is synthesized or hydrolyzed on the A1 headpiece, consisting of an A3B3 domain, and the energy provided for or released during that process is transmitted to the membrane-bound A0 domain (1Müller V. Grüber G. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 474-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The energy coupling between the two active domains occurs via the so-called stalk part, an assembly proposed to be composed by the subunits C, D, and F (2Grüber G. Wieczorek H. Harvey W.R. Müller V. J. Exp. Biol. 2001; 204: 2597-2605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The archaeal A1A0-ATPase/synthase is regarded as a chimeric protein in which the membrane domain is closely related to F1F0-ATP synthases but the catalytic subunits closely to V1V0-ATPases (3Hilario E. Gogarten J.P. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 703-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 4Iwabe N. Kuma K.-I. Hasegawa M. Qsawa S. Mijata T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Grüber G. Schmid R. Müller V. FEBS Lett. 2003; 544: 206-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The enzyme, as shown by small angle x-ray scattering data, consists of an ∼10-nm long headpiece and an 8.5-nm high and 6.0-nm diameter stalk (7Grüber G. Svergun D.I. Coskun Ü. Lemker T. Koch M.H.J. Schägger H. Müller V. Biochemistry. 2000; 40: 1890-1896Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A comparison of the central stalk of this A1 complex with bacterial F1- and V1-ATPase indicates different lengths of the stalk domain (7Grüber G. Svergun D.I. Coskun Ü. Lemker T. Koch M.H.J.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17659-17663Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The prevailing view is, however, that ATP synthesis/hydrolysis in the A1 headpiece is coupled to ion flow in A0 through rotational movements of the central stalk subunit(s) as demonstrated for the F1 (reviewed in Refs. 10Yoshida M. Muneyuki E. Hisabori T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar and 11Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys.

(Note, the so-called V1V0-ATPase from T. thermophilus, which also synthesizes ATP, is of archaeal origin (13Ihara K. Abe T. Sugimura K.I. Mukohata Y. J. Exp.

Evol. 2001; 52: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar); therefore, the ATPase headpiece will be considered A1/V1-ATPase throughout this work.)Here we describe a modified isolation procedure of the A1-ATPase from M. mazei Gö1, which facilitates the first three-dimensional reconstruction of this enzyme by using tilt pairs of negatively stained molecules. The structure adds to the emerging picture of A1 in which three copies of A and B subunits are arranged as a hexagonal barrel, enclosing a large cavity in which a shaft is asymmetrically located. This three-dimensional model allows comparison with structural models of related F1- and V1-ATPase determined by crystallography (15Gibbons C. Montgomery M.G. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. Nat. Struct.

Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar) and SDS-PAGE (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar). SDS gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250. Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA assay (Pierce). ATPase activity was measured as described previously (7Grüber G. Svergun D.I. Coskun Ü. Lemker T. Koch M.H.J. Schägger H. Müller V. Biochemistry. 2000; 40: 1890-1896Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Electron Microscopy and Two-dimensional Image Analysis—For electron microscopy the protein was diluted in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl to 20-40 μg/ml. The sample was applied to 400 mesh carbon-coated copper grids and stained with uranyl acetate. Micrographs were recorded at a calibrated magnification of ×58,300 on a Philips CM 120 electron microscope under low electron dose conditions (10 e-/Å2). The three-dimensional reconstruction followed the random conical reconstruction technique of Radermacher (21Radermacher M. J. Electron Microsc. Technol. 1988; 9: 359-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) implemented in the SPIDER software package (22Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 11: 190-199Crossref Scopus (1799) Google Scholar). Ten pairs of micrographs, the first image in each pair recorded at 53° and the second at 0° tilt angle, were scanned on a flat-bed SCAI (Zeiss) microdensitometer with 7 μm pixel size, which was subsequently reduced by binning to a pixel size of 21 μm, corresponding to 3.6 Å on the scale of the specimen. A total of 7851 pairs of images of single A1-ATPase molecules were selected. The criteria used for this selection were that the A1 molecules should be clearly visible and separated from neighboring particles in both the tilted and untilted versions. The alignment procedures, correction of the contrast transfer function, determination of the resolution, and the final three-dimensional reconstruction have been made by the use of the same procedures as described by Radermacher et al. (17Radermacher M. Ruiz T. Wieczorek H. Grüber G. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 135: 26-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Pattern recognition was carried out using a neural network algorithm (23Marabini R. Carazo J.M. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1804-1814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) as implemented in XMIPP (24Marabini R. Masegosa I.M. San Martin M.C. Marco S. Fernández J.J. de la Fraga L.G. Vaquerizo C. Carazo J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). A network of 13 × 13 nodes was used, and 25 nodes evenly spaced were selected as references (Fig. 3A) for alignment of the images by multireference alignment. Reconstructions were calculated from the images belonging to each node. The average class resulting from the first node, which also represented the largest number of particles (Fig. 3A), was chosen for final three-dimensional reconstruction of the enzyme. For representation the reconstruction was low pass filtered to 3.2 nm.Cross-link Formation in the A1Complex—The A1 complex (1 mg/ml), diluted in HEPES buffer (20 mm HEPES and 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.0), was incubated with 4 mm nucleotide and MgCl2, respectively, for 5 min. Cross-linking was induced by addition of 50 μm dithiobis[sulfosuccinimidylpropionate] (DSP, Pierce) resolved in Me2SO, on a sample rotator (Neolab) at 7 °C for 2 h. The cross-linking reaction was stopped by quenching the DSP cross-linking reaction with the addition of 130 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, and incubation for 10 min at 4 °C. Samples were dissolved in DTT-free dissociation buffer and applied to an SDS-PAGE as described above. For the use of 1-ethyl-3-(dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC) as a cross-linker, A1-ATPase was incubated with 5 mm EDC for 30 min on a sample rotator at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by addition of Laemmli buffer (63 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6, 10% glycerin, 2% SDS, and 0.01% bromphenol blue). The subunits involved in cross-linking were identified by Western blotting, using antisera against subunit A-D and F.RESULTSIsolation and Characterization of the A1-ATPase—The A1-ATPase has been purified by modification of an earlier method (6Lemker T. Grüber G. Schmid R. Müller V. FEBS Lett. 2003; 544: 206-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The main differences from the earlier procedure are that the gel filtration column BioPrepSE1000/17 and the anion-exchange column were replaced. In the modified procedure a 6-ml Resource™ Q column has been used to remove contaminating proteins (Fig. 1A). In the final step the enzyme eluted from a size-exclusion column (Sephacryl™ S-300 HR column) in a single peak. The enzyme contains the five subunits A-D and F as identified by use of antisera against these polypeptides (Fig. 1, B and C). The molar ratio of the five subunits is A3:B3:C:D:F (Fig. 1B), based on a quantitation of the staining intensity of the five bands of these subunits, indicating the improvement of this new isolation protocol, when compared with a previous preparation in which subunit C is present in substoichiometric amounts (6Lemker T. Grüber G. Schmid R. Müller V. FEBS Lett. 2003; 544: 206-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The contaminating bands running above subunit A are identified as E. coli DnaK and Grp E chaperons (data not shown). Small angle x-ray scattering patterns from solutions of the purified A1-ATPase were recorded and processed. Comparison with the scattering from the reference solutions of bovine serum albumin yields a molecular mass of 445 ± 10 kDa, in agreement with a molar ratio of A3:B3:C:D:F and apparent molecular masses of 65, 54, 41, 28, and 9 kDa. 2G. Grüber, Ü. Coskun, and M. H. J. Koch, unpublished data. This indicates that the two proteins above subunit A do not form a complex with the A1-ATPase. ATPase activity of the A1 complex in the presence of MgCl2 was determined to be 6 ± 0.5 μmol/(min·mg).Fig. 1Chromatographic purification of A1-ATPase from M. mazei Gö1.A, ion-exchange chromatography on Resource™ Q in Tris-HCl buffer. After sample injection, an isocratic elution of 5 column volumes with Buffer A (Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT) and a flow rate of 6.0 ml/min was employed, followed by a gradient program 0-10% Buffer B (Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl, and 1 mm DTT (—)). 5 μl of the collected and concentrated samples of peaks I, II, and III were applied on an SDS gel (see inset). B, after ion-exchange chromatography, the sample of peak III was applied onto a Sephacryl™ S-300 HR column, and the isolated A1 complex was subjected to SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue R-250.

A total of 7851 pairs of particles from 10 tilted/untilted micrographs were selected, and a self-organizing map of these particles (25Kohonen T. Proc. IEEE. 1990; 78: 1464-1480Crossref Scopus (5864) Google Scholar) was calculated by using a neural network approach to obtain the variations present in the data (Fig. 3A). In the upper left corner (number 1) a pseudohexagonal view of the particle can be seen with a seventh mass to the left of a hole. This feature strongly resembles the overall average (Fig. 3B1). The projection in the middle (Fig. 3A, number 5) shows this seventh mass in the center of the hexameric densities. Most of the variations seen may be caused by a rocking behavior of the molecule around its preferred orientation or by small tilts of the enzyme perpendicular to its hexagonal axis, sufficient to displace the central mass without apparent distortion of the outer hexagon.Fig. 2Electron micrographs of negatively stained A1-ATPase from M. mazei Gö1 at tilt angles of 0 (A) and 53° (B). The line (B) indicates the tilt angle. Bar represents 50 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The two-dimensional average at a resolution of 2.8 nm and calculated from 486 particles 0° micrographs shows a pseudohexagonal arrangement of six protein densities with an overall diameter of ∼11.0 nm (Fig. 3B1). The center of the particle shows a seventh mass, which would be consistent with the presence of a stalk. The final three-dimensional reconstruction (Fig. 4A) has been calculated from the tilt images that correspond to the 0° images used for this two-dimensional average. The resolution was determined to be 3.2 nm by the Fourier shell correlation criterion (21Radermacher M. J. Electron Microsc. Technol. 1988; 9: 359-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 26Saxton W.O. Baumeister W. J. Microsc. (Oxf.). 1982; 127: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar) with a threshold of five times the noise correlation value (Fig. 4B). The surface representation of the A1-ATPase displays some well known features of six elongated lobes, ∼3.2 and 2.8 nm in diameter and 7.5 and 5.0 nm in length, respectively, which are parallel to the 3-fold axis (Fig. 4, A1 and A3). These lobes presumably represent the alternating three copies each of the major subunits A and B of the A1 headpiece. The A3B3 hexagon encloses a core of ∼2.3 nm in the middle of the shaft, which narrows to 0.6 nm at the top of the A1 headpiece (Fig. 4A2). Inside this cavity a seventh mass penetrates offset to the central axis of the cavity as shown by cross-sections in Fig. 4C. At the bottom of the A1 complex a “stalk” with a length of about 3.0 nm and a maximum diameter of 4.0 nm can be seen, which runs slightly offset to the hexamer (Fig. 4A3). On the opposite site of the hexagonal barrel extensions can be observed (Fig. 4, A1 and A3). These extensions are consistent with the three-dimensional reconstruction of the closely related V1-ATPase, where elongated features in a crown-like fashion can be seen at the very top of the V1 domain (16Grüber G. Radermacher M. Ruiz T. Godovac-Zimmermann J. Canas B. Kleine-Kohlbrecher D. Huss M. Harvey W.R. Wieczorek H.

Chicas-Cruz K. Cai S.-X. Keana J.F.W. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2956-2961Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The first cross-linking reagent employed was the homobifunctional N-hydroxysuccinimide-ester DSP containing a 1.2-nm linker arm. Treatment of A1 with DSP gave rise to defined new bands (I-IV) and several A-B oligomers at higher molecular mass as observed in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5A). Product I was recognized by the antibodies against subunit B and F (Fig. 5B). The migration of this product agrees well with the predicted molecular mass of a complex containing one copy each of subunits B and F (63 kDa). Although the intensity of subunit D and subunit C disappears (Fig. 5A, lane 2), the cross-link products II and III were obtained. The products II and III are assembled by an A-B-D and Ax-D formation, respectively, as determined by Western blotting with antibodies against A, B, and D (Fig. 5B). The cross-link product IV is formed by an Ax-Bx-D complex, confirmed by the anti-A, -B, and -D subunit antibody.Fig. 5Cross-linking of the A1-ATPase from M. mazei Gö1 by using DSP or EDC.A, A1-ATPase was incubated with 5 mm MgAMP-PNP, MgATP, MgADP, MgADP + Pi, or without nucleotide for 5 min at 7 °C, followed by addition of 50 μm DSP for 2 h at 7 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 130 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, and the samples were electrophoresed on a 17.5% total acrylamide and 0.4% cross-linked acrylamide gel. B, transfer of the DSP-treated A1-ATPase to nitrocellulose and Western blotting using polyclonal rabbit antisera directed against the subunits A, B, D, and F of the A1-ATPase. C, the A3B3CDF complex was incubated with 5 mm EDC for 30 min at room temperature and stopped by addition of 63 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6, 10% glycerin, 2% SDS, and 0,01% bromphenol blue. The samples were applied to an SDS gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. Western blotting using the indicated polyclonal rabbit antisera directed against the A1 subunits A-D and F was carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The DSP cross-link approach was also used to study possible nucleotide-dependent topology changes in the archaeal A1-ATPase. Fig. 5A illustrates the results of cross-linking of the A1-ATPase with DSP under different nucleotide conditions. When A1 was suspended in Magma-PNP, cross-link products resembled the formation in the absence of nucleotides. The presence of MgATP leads to lower cross-link formation, which goes along with a low depletion of subunits C and D. Notably, the cross-link products I and II are formed in marginal amounts. Addition of MgADP + Pi results in cross-link products that resembled the formation in the presence of MgAMPPNP. Differences are in the higher depletion of subunits C and D and additional strong bands at higher molecular mass. The cross-linking pattern after addition of MgADP is comparable with that of the MgADP + Pi-bound enzyme, with slightly differences in the intensities at higher molecular mass. These results rule out that MgATP was completely converted into MgADP or MgADP + Pi before cross-link formation under the conditions used.The second cross-linking reagent employed was EDC, which results in cross-linking of carboxyl and amino groups. Treatment of A1 with EDC resulted in the formation of four cross-linking products (I-IV). The first cross-linking formation, with an apparent molecular mass of 63 kDa, was recognized by the antibodies against subunits B and F (Fig. 5C). The yield of this product is close to 90%, based on the disappearance of the F subunit. The second and third products were recognized by the antibodies against A and D and A, B, D, respectively. The fourth formation has been identified as a complex consisting of the subunits A, B, C and D.DISCUSSIONThe A1-ATPase from M. mazei Gö1 originally purified gives an ATPase active A3:B3:C:D:F complex, with subunit C being sub-stoichiometric (6Lemker T. Grüber G. Schmid R. Müller V. FEBS Lett. 2003; 544: 206-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The modified method of A1-ATPase purification described here results in a monodisperse preparation, with an enzyme consisting of all five subunits in stoichiometric amounts, which makes it suitable for structural examinations like three-dimensional electron microscopy of single particles. The most striking organizational feature of such isolated A1-ATPase is the hexagonal arrangement of densities seen in projection images of single particles, deduced to be made up by the subunits A and B (Fig. 3). In three dimensions these subunits are elongated structures, interdigitated for most of the height of the hexagon. Three of these masses appear to be slightly larger than the remaining ones, confirming the stoichiometry of A3:B3 and the alternating arrangement for the nucleotide-binding subunits in the enzyme. The hexagonal barrel has dimensions of 10.2 nm in diameter and 10.8 nm in height, in agreement of dimensions of 10 × 9.4 nm determined by solution x-ray scattering data of the same enzyme (7Grüber G. Svergun D.I. Coskun Ü. Lemker T. Koch M.H.J. Schägger H. Müller V. Biochemistry. 2000; 40: 1890-1896Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Extensions, visible on the top of the hexagon, are asymmetric, similar to the top domain of the three-dimensional reconstruction of the V1-ATPase from M. sexta determined at 3.2 (16Grüber G.

Biol. 2001; 135: 26-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), which possess the so-called “non-homologous region” in the A subunits, an insert of an 80-90-amino acid long loop, which is similar to the catalytic A subunits in A1 (14Marin I. Ali Fares M. González-Candelas F. Barrio E. Genes P. J. Mol. Evol. 2001; 52: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). By comparison, this region is not present in the related β subunits of F-ATPases, whose top domain consist of six globular masses, made by a β-barrel domain, containing the N termini of the nucleotide-binding subunits α and β (15Gibbons C.

This effect is believed to be one of earliest morphological changes of heart and renal failure.

This octapeptide hormone plays an important role in the regulation of cardiovascular and renal functions via diverse mechanisms (1Peach M.J. Physiol.

Although its vasoactive effects were initially considered to be a unique feature for maintaining blood pressure, recent studies have demonstrated that Ang II exerts many other important actions on the cardiovascular and renal systems. For example, Ang II stimulates the growth of diverse cell types, such as vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), cardiac myocytes, and proximal tubular cells (3Phillips M.I. Annu. Rev.

These observations suggest that Ang II may play an important role in various cardiovascular and renal diseases associated with abnormal cell growth (cellular hypertrophy or cell proliferation) and inflammation, such as hypertension, congestive heart failure, atherosclerosis, postangioplastic restenosis, and renal failure.

Most known actions of Ang II are believed to be mediated through AT1 receptors, whereas the function of AT2 receptors may be the opposite of AT1 receptors (23Hughes A.D. J. Hum.

Like most G-protein-coupled receptors, the AT1 receptor exerts its function through its carboxyl-terminal domain in addition to its intracellular cytoplasmic loops. The carboxyl-terminal domain of the AT1 receptor has been reported to directly interact with several downstream effectors (10Wang D.H. Prewitt R.L.

As for many G-protein-coupled receptors, the carboxyl-terminal domain of the AT1 receptor presumably interacts with G-protein-coupled receptor kinases and arrestins, causing the functional desensitization of the receptor (31Tang H. Guo D.F. Porter J.P. Wanaka Y. Inagami T. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 32Thomas W.G. Thekkumkara T.J. Motel T.J. Baker K.M. J. Biol.

Two novel proteins, ATRAP and ARAP1, have recently been isolated by us and another using the yeast two-hybrid system (35Daviet L. Lehtonen J.Y.A. Tamura K. Griese D.P. Masatsugu H. Dzau V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17058-17062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 36Cui T. Nakagami H. Iwai M. Takeda Y. Shiuchi T. Tamura K. Daviet L. Horiuchi M. J. Biol.

ATRAP is a small protein that interacts specifically with the carboxyl-terminal domain of the AT1 receptor (35Daviet L. Lehtonen J.Y.A. Tamura K. Griese D.P. Masatsugu H. Dzau V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17058-17062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Overexpression of ATRAP causes a marked inhibition of the AT1 receptor-mediated activation of phospholipase C. Further studies also demonstrate that ATRAP overexpression enhances AT1 receptor internalization and inhibits cell growth in VSMCs (36Cui T. Nakagami H. Iwai M. Takeda Y. Shiuchi T. Tamura K. Daviet L. Horiuchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 279: 938-941Google Scholar). On the other hand, ARAP1 is another protein that was found to interact with the carboxyl-terminal domain of the AT1 receptor (37Guo D.F. Chenier I. Tardif V. Orlov S.N. Inagami T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 310: 1254-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Characterization of ARAP1 in HEK-293 cells has revealed that ARAP1 binds and promotes the AT1 receptor to the plasma membrane, indicating its role in the receptor recycling pathway. The Ang II-induced hypertrophic effect is associated with increased expression of the proto-oncogenes c-fos, c-myc, and c-jun and autocrine growth factors PDGF-AA and bFGF and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinases in cultured VSMCs (38Naftilan A.J. Pratt R.E. Dzau V.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 39Naftilan A.J. Gilliland G.K. Eldridge C.S. Kraft A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5536-5540Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Despite the activation of these proto-oncogenes and mitogenes, Ang II does not induce hyperplasia but instead causes hypertrophy in confluent quiescent VSMCs in serum-free medium. Recent studies on the molecular mechanism(s) of Ang II-induced VSMC and mesangial cell hypertrophy showed they are mediated at least partially at the level of the molecular machinery regulating cell-cycle progression (40Braun-Dullaeus R.C. Mann M.J. Ziegler A. von der Leyen H.E. Dzau V.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 815-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), protein kinase B (PKB) (41Gorin Y. Kim N.H. Feliers D. Bhandari B.

Harrison D.G. Taylor W.R. Griendling K.K. Hypertension. 1998; 32: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). However, the precise molecular mechanisms of cellular hypertrophy remain poorly understood. In the present study we describe the identification of a novel GDP/GTP exchange factor (GEF)-like protein, GLP, and the characterization of the GLP gene on cell growth in cultured VSMCs and immortalized renal proximal tubular cells (IRPTCs). We report here that GLP induces cellular hypertrophy in both VSMC- and IRPTC-overexpressing GLP genes. Materials—Phospho-specific (Ser-473) antibody against Akt2 and antibody against Akt2 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Beverly, MA. p27kip1 antibody was from Transduction Laboratories Inc., Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. Antibody against β-actin, Na3VO4, aprotinin, leupeptin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin, and diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) were purchased from Sigma. 9E10 monoclonal antibody against Myc epitope tag and fetal bovine serum were from Invitrogen. LY294002 was obtained from Calbiochem. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—The yeast two-hybrid system was carried out essentially as described previously (44Xu Y.R. Guo D.F. Mavidson M. Inagami T. Garpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13463-13466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, the bait plasmid was pBTM116, expressing the carboxyl-terminal 64-amino acid residues (295–359) of rat AT1A receptor in-frame with the lex A DNA binding domain (pBTM116-AT1A). The L40 yeast strain was transformed with pBTM116-AT1A and subsequently with a pVP16 10.5-day mouse embryo cDNA library. Plasmids—To overexpress the GLP gene in VSMCs and IRPTCs, human GLP cDNA was subcloned into a retroviral vector, pLNCX (45Miller A.D. Rosman G.J. Biotechniques. 1989; 7: 980-990PubMed Google Scholar, 46Danos O. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 98: 6460-6464Crossref Scopus (799) Google Scholar), and pcDNA3, respectively. To facilitate detection by Western blot analysis, GLP was tagged with an Myc epitope tag (MGREFEQKLISEEDLL) followed by the GLP sequence (pcDNA3-Myc-GLP). A dominant negative mutant of GLP, lacking the last 101 amino acids, was created with an addition of a stop codon at position of 429 (pcDNA3-Myc-GLP-M1). GLP in antisense orientation was also produced (pcDNA3-GLP-AS) to reverse the effects observed in GLP overexpression in IRPTCs. For cellular localization experiments, GLP was expressed as an enhanced green fluorescence protein (GFP) fusion protein in pcDNA3 vector (pcDNA3-GFP-GLP). To produce polyclonal antibodies against GLP, a DNA fragment of human GLP gene, which consists of the carboxyl-terminal tail from 430 to 531 amino acids, was infused into pGEX-5X-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) as glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. The epitope tags were integrated into the cDNAs encoding human GLP by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis with polymerase chain reaction methods, and sequences of the recombinant DNAs were confirmed by automatic sequencer. Cells—VSMCs were prepared from 6-week male Brown Norway rats. IRPTCs (cell line #93-p2-1), produced in the laboratory of Dr. Julie R. Ingelfinger as passage 11–18, were used in the present studies. These cells express the mRNA of renin angiotensin system components including angiotensinogen, renin, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and AT1 and AT2 receptors (47Ingelfinger J.R. Zuo W.M. Fon E.A. Ellison K.E. Dzau V.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 417-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 48Tang S.S. Jung F.F. Diamant D. Brown D. Bachinsky D. Hellman P. Ingelfinger J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F435-F436PubMed Google Scholar). HEK-293 cells were obtained from ATCC. VSMCs, HEK-293, and IRPTCs were grown in low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 5% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C under 5% CO2. To establish a VSMC line permanently overexpressing GLP gene, a retrovirus-based system was used. Briefly, the pLNCX-GLP plasmid DNA was transfected into ΨCRIP-packaging cells with G418 (400 μg/ml) selection. Recombinant viruses obtained from the packaging cells were then used to infect VSMCs. After G418 (400 μg/ml) selection, positive VSMC lines were determined by Northern blot analysis. To establish the IRPTC stably overexpressing GLP gene in the sense and antisense orientation, pcDNA3-Myc-GLP and pcDNA3-GLP-AS and its mutant M1 (pcDNA3-Myc-GLLP-M1) were transfected into the cells with the electroporation method (Bio-Rad). Briefly, 4 μg of DNA was added into 400 μl of 107 cells/ml in PBS buffer at 400 V and 500 microfarads for transfection. Positive cell lines after 2 weeks of G418 (600 μg/ml) selection were determined with either Western blot analysis (for GLP and GLP-M1) or a specific reverse transcription (RT)-PCR (for GLP-AS) as described below. To determine the cellular localization of GLP gene, an HEK-293 cell line stably expressing pcDNA3-GFP-GLP was used. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from different human tissues and cell lines by a modified version of the guanidinium thiocyanate procedure. Poly(A)+ mRNAs were then extracted with an Oligotex mRNA kit (Qiagen). Two μg of poly(A)+ mRNA were resolved by electrophoresis on a 1.2% agarose gel containing 1.8% formaldehyde, transferred to a Hybond-N membrane, fixed, and hybridized with a 32P-labeled probe. Full-length human GLP cDNA was used as a probe. After exposition, the membrane was stripped and rehybridized with a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe. Microscopy Analysis—HEK-293 cells expressing pcDNA3-GFP-GLP were grown on glass coverslips and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. The cells were visualized and photographed under a Zeiss microscope with Eastman Kodak Co. film. [3H]Thymidine Incorporation—To determine cell proliferation, DNA synthesis was measured as described previously (49Solban N. Jia H.P. Richard S. Tremblay S. Devlin A. Peng J. Gossard F. Guo D.F. Morel G. Hamet P. Lewanczuk R. Tremblay J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32234-32243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50–80% confluent cells were washed with PBS and incubated in serum-free medium for 48 h for VSMCs and 24 h for IRPTCs, respectively. Four hours before harvesting the cells, 0.25 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine was added into the medium. Cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed with ethanol/acetic acid (3:1, v/v), and the acid-insoluble material was precipitated with ice-cold perchloric acid. Then the DNA was extracted in 1 ml of 0.5 n perchloric acid at 80 °C. Supernatants were transferred to plastic tubes and counted in a scintillation counter. The experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times. [3H]Leucine Incorporation—To determine cellular hypertrophy, [3H]leucine incorporation was measured. Cells were grown in 24-well plates made quiescent in serum-free medium for 48 h for VSMCs or 24 h for IRPTCs. Cells were pulsed with 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]leucine for 24 h, then washed 3 times with PBS. Cellular proteins were precipitated for 30 min at 4 °C with trichloroacetic acid, and lipid fractions were solubilized by washing twice with ice-cold ethanol. Precipitated proteins were resuspended in 0.25 n NaOH, transferred to plastic tubes, and counted in a scintillation counter. The experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times. Flow Cytometry Analysis—For measurement of forward-angle light scatter, cells were harvested by trypsinization, fixed with 75% methanol, washed, and incubated with 100 μg/ml RNase and 10 μg/ml propidium iodide in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. Samples were analyzed using standard methods on a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data were computer analyzed with Cell Quest Pro software (BD Biosciences). Western Blotting Analysis—Cells were rinsed with PBS and lysed in ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin and leupeptin). Lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min in a microcentrifuge at maximum speed, and the supernatant was used for Western blot analysis. Thirty micrograms of protein were separated on denaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-C; Amersham Biosciences). Phosphorylation of Akt2/PKB was detected by Western blotting with a phospho-specific antibody, and protein was normalized with total Akt2. p27kip1 was detected with a specific antibody, and protein was normalized with β-actin expression. To determine positive IRPTC lines expressing pcDNA-Myc-GLP and its mutant M1 (pcDNA3-Myc-GLP-M1), 9E10 monoclonal antibody, which recognizes Myc epitope tag, was used for Western blot detection. To detect endogenous GLP protein expression, rabbit polyclonal antibodies against glutathione S-transferase-GLP fusion protein, which consists of 101 amino acid residues in the carboxyl-terminal tail of GLP, were produced. Proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences). The relative densities of Akt2/PKB, p27kip1, and β-actin bands were determined with a computerized laser densitometer. We analyzed the data quantitatively by applying a commercially available system (Kodak 1D image analysis software). Cellular Protein Content—To assess the cellular protein content, the cells were rendered quiescent for 48 h and then harvested with 0.05% EDTA. The number of cells per well was counted and lysed in 100 μl of 2 m NaOH, and cellular protein content was determined by protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Bovine serum albumin was used as a standard. Cellular protein content is an indicator of cellular hypertrophy, as shown by Mackovic-Basic et al. (50Mackovic-Basic M. Fine L.G. Normal J.T. Cargoe E.J. Kurtz I. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1992; 3: 1124-1130PubMed Google Scholar). GLP mRNA Expression—To determine GLP mRNA expression, a specific RT-PCR was performed using the primer sets 5′-AGTCATGGTGGATGTCGGAAA-3′ (sense) and 5′-ATGTGAGCCACAAGCTACTTC-3′ (antisense), corresponding to the nucleotide sequences of -4 to +17 and +393 to +414 of human GLP cDNA, respectively. Total RNAs were extracted with TRIzol reagent, (Invitrogen) according to the protocol of the supplier and quantified by absorbance at 260 nm, and were used in RT-PCR to quantify the amount of GLP mRNA expressed in IRPTCs. PCR reactions were performed for 5 min at 95 °C initial denaturing followed by 32 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 54 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 5 min in the thermal cycler (MJ Research Inc.). The GLP mRNA expression was normalized with β-actin mRNA expression with the primer sets of 5′-ATGCCATCCTGCGTCTGGACCTGGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-AGCATTTGCGGTGCACGATGGAGGG-3′ (antisense), corresponding to the nucleotide sequences of +155 to 139 of exon 3 and nucleotide sequences of +155 to +139 of exon 5 of the rat β-actin gene, respectively (51Nudel U. Zakut R. Shani M. Neuman S. Levy Z. Yaffe D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1759-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Three to thirteen separate experiments were performed, and each treatment group was assayed in triplicate unless indicated. The data were analyzed with the Student's t test or analysis variance. A probability level of p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Identification of GLP Gene—To identify proteins that interact with the carboxyl-terminal domain of the AT1A receptor, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed in a system that included the AT1A (residues 295–359) fused to the lex A DNA binding domain and a mouse embryo cDNA library (37Guo D.F. Chenier I. Tardif V. Orlov S.N. Inagami T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 310: 1254-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) fused to the VP16 transactivation domain. One positive clone, A8, which contained 162-amino acid residues of mouse GLP (residues 371–533), was isolated. Clone A8 was subsequently retested in the yeast two-hybrid assay with the truncated AT1A receptor (residues 295–318). Although the entire AT1A carboxyl terminus domain (residues 295–359) interacted with mouse clone A8, the truncated fragment AT1A-T318, consisting of residues 295–318, failed to do so. The result indicates that the region between residues 319 and 359 of AT1A is required for interaction with the GLP gene in the yeast two-hybrid system. A total of 23 clones were subsequently isolated from a λgt11 human VSMC primary cDNA library employing mouse clone A8 as a probe. A 2.6-kb clone has a putative ATG start codon at position 228 and contains an open reading frame of 1593 bp encoding a hydrophilic protein of 531 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 58,564 daltons (Fig. 1A). The mobility of the in vitro translation product was in agreement with the molecular mass predicted for the 2.6-kb clone (data not shown). An amino acid sequence data base search found a similar human cDNA from GenBank™ (accession numbers AF334406, AJ319660, AK096654, AL833821, and NM_018191). There are three amino acid differences between the 2.6-kb clone and the published amino acid sequence from GenBank™; valine 239 is changed to phenylalanine, tyrosine 242 to asparagine, and threonine 245 to asparagine. Analysis of the 2.6-kb clone amino acid sequence revealed that it contains a motif of seven tandem repeats similar to that of RCC1 protein. RCC1 has been identified as a GEF for Ran small G-protein (52Ohtsubo M. Kai R. Furuno N. Sekiguchi T. Sekiguchi M. Hayashida H. Kuma K. Miyata T. Fukushige S. Murotsu T. Matsubara K. Nishimoto T.

Kinetic studies indicate that interactions with extended macromolecular recognition sites (exosites) rather than the active site of prothrombinase are the principal determinants of binding affinity for substrate or product. We now provide a model-independent evaluation of such ideas by physical studies of the interaction of substrate derivatives and product with prothrombinase. The enzyme complex was assembled using Xa modified with a fluorescent peptidyl chloromethyl ketone to irreversibly occlude the active site. Binding was inferred by prethrombin 2-dependent perturbations in the fluorescence of Oregon Green488 at the active site of prothrombinase. Active site-independent binding was also unequivocally established by fluorescence resonance energy transfer between 2,6-dansyl tethered to the active site of Xa and eosin tethered to the active sites of either thrombin or meizothrombin des fragment 1. Comparable interprobe distances obtained from these measurements suggest that substrate and product interact equivalently with the enzyme. Competition established the ability of a range of substrate or product derivatives to bind in a mutually exclusive fashion to prothrombinase. Equilibrium dissociation constants obtained for the active site-independent binding of prothrombin, prethrombin 2, meizothrombin des fragment 1 and thrombin to prothrombinase were comparable with their affinities inferred from kinetic studies using active enzyme. Our findings directly establish that binding affinity is principally determined by the exosite-mediated interaction of either the substrate, both possible intermediates, or product with prothrombinase. A single type of exosite binding interaction evidently drives affinity and binding specificity through the stepwise reactions necessary for the two cleavage reactions of prothrombin activation and product release.

Several of the highly specific proteolytic activation steps of the blood coagulation cascade are catalyzed by enzyme complexes assembled through protein-protein and protein-membrane interactions between a trypsin-like serine proteinase and a cofactor protein (1Mann K.G.

This architecture is typified by the prothrombinase complex that catalyzes the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. Specific recognition and proteolysis of two peptide bonds in prothrombin is achieved by prothrombinase, which is composed of the serine protease, Factor Xa, assembled with the cofactor protein, Factor Va, in the presence of a suitable membrane surface and calcium ions (1Mann K.G.

The serine proteinases of coagulation belong to the chymotrypsin family and possess catalytic domains that are structurally homologous to each other (4Neurath H. Science. 1984; 224: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 5Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Despite this homology, the coagulation enzymes display distinctive specificities in cleaving their protein substrates (1Mann K.G. Jenny R.J. Krishnaswamy S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 915-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Substrate affinity and enzymic specificity in this enzyme family has been considered to be dictated by the engagement of unique peptidyl sequences preceding the scissile bond in the substrate with complementary structures surrounding the active site of the proteinase (6Perona J.J. Craik C.S. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 337-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar, 7Rose T. Di Cera E. J. Biol.

In contrast, a series of contributions now support a major role for extended macromolecular interactions at sites (exosites) removed from the active site in determining the action of prothrombinase on its protein substrate (8Krishnaswamy S.

Betz A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12080-12086Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 10Boskovic D.S. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38561-38570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For each of these substrate analogs, the data are consistent with a kinetic model in which protein substrate recognition by prothrombinase is achieved through stepwise interactions at an exosite, followed by active site docking and catalysis (8Krishnaswamy S. Betz A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12080-12086Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 10Boskovic D.S. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38561-38570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Substrate affinity is determined in a predominant way by the initial exosite binding interaction (8Krishnaswamy S. Betz A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12080-12086Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Active site docking, which occurs in a subsequent unimolecular binding step, contributes in an undetectable or minor way to substrate affinity and instead affects maximum catalytic rate (8Krishnaswamy S. Betz A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12080-12086Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 11Orcutt S.J. Pietropaolo C. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46191-46196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A distinctive feature of this kinetic pathway is that small ligands that bind reversibly to the active site of Xa within prothrombinase do not affect protein substrate affinity and therefore act as noncompetitive inhibitors (8Krishnaswamy S. Betz A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12080-12086Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 10Boskovic D.S. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38561-38570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In contrast, thrombin, the product of the reaction, acts as a competitive inhibitor of protein substrate cleavage without engaging the active site of Xa within prothrombinase (8Krishnaswamy S. Betz A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12080-12086Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 9Betz A. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10709-10718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The data suggest that equivalent exosite tethering interactions drive affinity in the productive pathway for the cleavage of both half-reaction substrate analogs for prothrombin activation as well as product release (10Boskovic D.S. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38561-38570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, it follows that substrate derivatives and product should bind to prothrombinase, with affinities comparable with those inferred from steady state kinetic studies, even following modification of the enzyme by peptidyl chloromethyl ketones that are known to occlude structures necessary for substrate docking at the active site (12Padmanabhan K. Padmanabhan K.P. Tulinsky A. Park C.H. Bode W. Huber R. Blankenship D.T. Cardin A.D. Kisiel W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 947-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 13Brandstetter H. Kuhne A.

We have directly tested this prediction by the use of fluorescent strategies to investigate the binding of substrates and product to prothrombinase assembled using Xa covalently inactivated with a peptidyl chloromethyl ketone. Materials—l-α-phosphatidylcholine (hen egg) and l-α-phosphatidylserine (porcine brain) were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). d-Phenylalanyl-l-prolyl-l-arginyl chloromethyl ketone (FPR-CH2Cl), 2-dimethylaminonaphthalene-6-sulfonyl-l-glutamyl-glycyl-l-arginyl chloromethyl ketone (2,6-Dns-EGR-CH2Cl), and l-glutamyl-glycyl-l-arginyl chloromethyl ketone (EGR-CH2Cl) were obtained from Calbiochem. Crude lyophilized venom from Echis carinatus pyramidum was obtained from Latoxan (Valence, France). Oregon Green488 maleimide, 5-(iodoacetamido)eosin, and succinimidyl (acetylthio)acetate were from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Small unilamellar phospholipid vesicles (PCPS) composed of 75% (w/w) phosphatidylcholine and 25% (w/w) phosphatidylserine were prepared and characterized as described previously (14Walker R.K. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27441-27450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Acetothioacetyl adducts of FPR-CH2Cl (ATA-FPR-CH2Cl) and EGR-CH2Cl (ATA-EGR-CH2Cl) were prepared and quality-controlled by minor modifications to procedures developed by Bock (15Bock P.E.

Ecarin was purified from crude E. carinatus pyramidum venom as described previously (10Boskovic D.S. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38561-38570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The nonfluorescent, inactivated derivative of thrombin (IIai) was prepared by inhibition with FPR-CH2Cl, as described previously (10Boskovic D.S. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38561-38570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Eosin-labeled thrombin (IIaE) was obtained by inhibition with ATA-FPR-CH2Cl followed by thioester hydrolysis and modification with 5-(iodoacetamido)eosin. Typically, thrombin (20 μm, 7 mg) in 20 mm Hepes, 0.04 m NaCl, pH 7.5, was inactivated by two sequential additions of 40 μm ATA-FPR-CH2Cl. Following each addition, inactivation was allowed to proceed for 60 min at 25 °C. Excess ATA-FPR-CH2Cl was removed by gel filtration using a column (1.5 × 49 cm) of Sephadex G-25 equilibrated in the same buffer. Protein eluting in the void volume was pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration (YM-30, Amicon, Danvers, MA), and brought up to 5 ml with 0.2 m Hepes, pH 7.0. The resulting solution was treated with 0.2 mm 5-(iodoacetamido)eosin (1.2 mm stock solution prepared in 0.2 m Hepes, pH 7.0) and 0.1 m NH2OH (1 m stock solution prepared in 0.1 m Hepes, 0.3 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0), followed by incubation at 25 °C for 3.5 h. The resulting IIaE was then separated from excess reagents by chromatography using Sephadex G-25 as above. The protein fractions were pooled, precipitated with (NH4)2SO4 (80% saturation), collected by centrifugation (100,000 × g, 45 min), dissolved in 50% glycerol, and stored at –20 °C. Inactivated mIIaΔF1 was prepared by preparative cleavage of prethrombin 1 by ecarin in the presence of an appropriate peptidyl chloromethyl ketone (10Boskovic D.S. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38561-38570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).

Chem. 2000; 275: 38561-38570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The eosin derivative, mIIaΔF1E, was prepared by cleavage in the presence of ATA-FPR-CH2Cl followed by thioester hydrolysis and modification with 5-(iodoacetamido)eosin with minor modifications to procedures previously employed for the preparation of the fluorescein derivative of mIIaΔF1 (10Boskovic D.S. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38561-38570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Factor Xa was inactivated with ATA-EGR-CH2Cl and labeled with Oregon Green488 maleimide following thioester hydrolysis to yield XaOG as described (9Betz A. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10709-10718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).

Methods Enzymol. 1976; 45: 156-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The molecular weight and extinction coefficient for mIIaΔF1 derivatives were assumed to correspond to the values determined for prethrombin 1. All measurements were conducted in 20 mm Hepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 2.0 mm CaCl2, 0.1% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, pH 7.5 (assay buffer), and protein solutions were exchanged into this buffer either by dialysis or centrifugal gel filtration before use. Binding of Prethrombin 2 to Prothrombinase—Reaction mixtures (2.0 ml) in 1 × 1-cm stirred quartz cuvettes containing 20 nm XaOG, 50 nm Va, and 50 μm PCPS in assay buffer were titrated with increasing concentrations of Pre-2. Steady state fluorescence intensity was measured following each addition at 25 °C using an SLM 8000 instrument with modifications by On-Line Instrument Systems (OLIS, Bogart, GA) as described (14Walker R.K. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27441-27450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with λex = 490 nm, λem = 515 nm with a long pass filter (KV-500, Schott, Duryea, PA) in the emission beam. Spectral Measurements—Absorbance spectra were collected at room temperature using an HP 8453 diode array spectrophotometer (Hewlett Packard, Waldbronn, Germany) using 0.82 μm XaD, 0.64 μm mIIaΔF1E or 1.33 μm IIaE in assay buffer. Ratiometric fluorescence emission spectra were obtained at 25 °C using a PTI QuantaMaster (Photon Technology International, Oakville, Canada). For measurements with XaD, the reaction mixture contained 156 nm XaD in assay buffer, and spectra were recorded using λEX = 330 nm. Spectra for the eosin derivatives were recorded using λEX = 496 nm and reaction mixtures containing either 140 nm mIIaΔF1E or 160 nm IIaE in assay buffer. Technical spectra were corrected for background and the minor contribution due to the inner filter effect (29Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 25-61Crossref Google Scholar) before corrected spectra were obtained using tabulated values provided with the instrument. The quantum yield of XaD was determined using the equations described (29Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 25-61Crossref Google Scholar) by comparison with spectra obtained using a solution of quinine sulfate in 0.1 m H2SO4 with known absorbance at 330 nm. Quantum yields for the eosin derivatives were determined by comparison with spectra obtained using a solution of fluorescein in 0.1 m NaOH with known absorbance at 496 nm. Quantum yields were taken as 0.71 for quinine sulfate (30Scott T.G. Spencer R.D. Leonard N.J. Weber G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1970; 92: 687-695Crossref Scopus (359) Google Scholar) and 0.95 for fluorescein (31Brannon J.H. Magde D. J. Phys. Chem. 1978; 82: 705-709Crossref Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Binding of IIaE or mIIaΔF1E to Prothrombinase Measured by Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)—Spectral measurements were performed in assay buffer using a scanning fluorescence plate reader (SpectraMax Gemini; Molecular Devices, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) maintained at 25 °C. Emission spectra were acquired using λex = 330 nm and scanning the emission monochromator between 420 and 600 nm. Reaction mixtures (200 μl) containing a fixed concentration of prothrombinase and increasing concentrations of IIa or mIIaΔF1 were prepared in wells of nonbinding, black, 96-well plates (catalog no. 3650; Corning Glass). Four different reaction mixtures were used for each concentration of titrant to permit satisfactory interpretation of the FRET signal (32Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry Part II: Techniques for the Study of Biological Structure and Function. W.H. Freeman & Co., San Francisco1980: 433-465Google Scholar). Wells in row C contained 0.2 μm Xai, 0.4 μm Va, 50 μm PCPS, and increasing concentrations of either IIai or mIIaΔF1i (unlabeled donor + unlabeled acceptor, D* + A*). Wells in row D contained 0.2 μm Xai, 0.4 μm Va, 50 μm PCPS, and increasing concentrations of either IIaE or mIIaΔF1E (unlabeled donor + labeled acceptor, D* + A). Wells in row E contained 0.2 μm XaD, 0.4 μm Va, 50 μm PCPS, and increasing concentrations of either IIai or mIIaΔF1i (labeled donor + unlabeled acceptor, D + A*). Wells in row F contained 0.2 μm XaD, 0.4 μm Va, 50 μm PCPS, and increasing concentrations of either IIaE or mIIaΔF1E (labeled donor + labeled acceptor, D + A). Fluorescence intensity was integrated between 420 and 450 nm to focus on the informative region of donor fluorescence in each of the four reaction mixtures to yield FD*+A*, FD*+A, FD+A*, and FD+A. Substrates and products interact with greatly decreased affinity for factor Xa in the absence of factor Va (22Krishnaswamy S. Walker R.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3319-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, the trivial and nonspecific component of the FRET signal was extracted by repeating the same experiment in the absence of factor Va followed by integration of spectra to yield F′D*+A*, F′D*+A, F′D+A* and F′D+A. The fractional change in donor fluorescence as a function of acceptor concentration, corrected for trivial effects, was calculated from the integrated areas as follows. FFo=(FD+A−FD∗+A∗FD∗+A+FD+A∗−2⋅FD∗+A∗)−(FD+A′−FD∗+A∗′FD∗+A′+FD+A∗′−2⋅FD∗+A∗′)(Eq. 1) Competitive Binding Measurements—Exactly the same experimental strategy described above was used to assess the ability of various nonfluorescent derivatives to displace IIaE or mIIaΔF1E from prothrombinase. For measurements with IIa, FRET was measured with the same concentrations of prothrombinase constituents described above, IIaE (and unlabeled controls) fixed at 1.0 μm and increasing concentrations of IIai, or prothrombin. Competition measurements with mIIaΔF1 were similarly performed using mIIaΔF1E (and unlabeled controls) fixed at 6.0 μm and increasing concentrations of IIai, Pre-2, or F2. Dynamic Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence excited state lifetimes were measured by time-correlated, single photon counting using instrumentation described previously (33Holtom G.R. Proc. SPIE. 1990; 1204: 2-12Crossref Google Scholar). The laser system consisted of a mode-locked Nd:YAG laser (Coherent Antares, Santa Paula, CA) used to synchronously pump a home-built single-jet cavity dumped dye laser (4-dicyanomethylene-2-methyl-6-(p-dimethylaminostyryl)-4H-pyran in methanol/ethylene glycol). Frequency doubling with a β-barium borate crystal yielded 330-nm excitation light. Emission decays were collected at 440 nm and at the magic angle through a double monochromator in subtractive dispersive mode. Samples (2.0 ml) in assay buffer at 25 °C, contained 0.2 μm XaD; 0.4 μm Va; 50 μm PCPS; and 0, 0.75, 2, 5, or 8 μm IIaE (or IIai). Transients were accumulated for 3–5 h and analyzed by fitting to a two-exponential decay to extract the intensity-weighted average of the observed donor lifetimes in the presence of increasing concentrations of IIaE (τ) or in the presence of increasing concentrations of IIai (τo). Data Analysis—Based on established equilibrium constants and stoichiometries of the individual component interactions for prothrombinase assembly (34Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3708-3718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), concentrations of Va and PCPS were chosen to be saturating relative to factor Xa. The concentration of prothrombinase (E) was therefore considered equal to the limiting concentration of the Xa derivative present in the reaction mixture. When Va was absent, all of the factor Xa was considered to be present as the Xa-PCPS binary complex (34Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3708-3718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Immediately after spawning, an increase of intracellular pH (pHi) from ∼7.0 to ∼7.3 is induced by Na+/H+ antiporter in oocytes, and meiosis reinitiation occurs. Here we show that an endogenous substrate of the proteasome, polyubiquitinated cyclin B, was stable at pH 7.0, whereas it was degraded at pH 7.3. When the MAPK pathway was blocked by MEK inhibitor U0126, degradation of polyubiquitinated cyclin B occurred even at pH 7.0 without an increase of the peptidase activity of the proteasome. These results indicate that the proteasome activity at pH 7.0 is sufficient for degradation of polyubiquitinated cyclin B and that the MAPK pathway blocks the degradation of polyubiquitinated cyclin B in the maturing oocytes in the ovary. Immediately after spawning, the increase in pHi mediated by Na+/H+ antiporter cancels the inhibitory effects of the MAPK pathway, resulting in the degradation of polyubiquitinated cyclin B and the release of the arrest. Thus, the key step of metaphase I arrest in starfish oocytes occurs after the polyubiqutination of cyclin B but before cyclin B proteolysis by the proteasome."

BTAF1 has been proposed to play a key role in the dynamic regulation of TBP function in RNA polymerase II transcription. We have determined the structure of native B-TFIID purified from human cells by electron microscopy and by image analysis of single particles at a resolution of 28 Å. B-TFIID is 15 × 9 nm in size and is organized into a large domain of about 170 kDa, which can be subdivided into two domains. Extending from this domain is a long thumb, which in turn is divided into subdomains of about 25, 15, and 35 kDa, the largest of which is located at the end of the thumb. Immunolabeling experiments localize the extreme carboxyl terminus of BTAF1 within the 170-kDa domain, whereas the amino terminus and TBP co-localize to the end of the protruding thumb. The central portion of BTAF1 localizes to the base of the thumb. Comparison of the native B-TFIID with its recombinant form shows that both share a similar domain organization. Collectively, these data provide the first structural model of the B-TFIID complex and map its key functional domains."

Pannekoek H. Fibrinolysis. 1995; 9: 261-276Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The protein contains no cysteines. PAI-1 is a member of the superfamily of the serpins (serine proteinase inhibitors), glycoproteins with a reactive center loop (RCL) comprising the active site (P1-P1′ residues) that interacts with the proteinase (see Fig. 1). Active, inhibitory serpins can inhibit serine proteinases (e.g. t-PA) by a remarkably conformational change-based mechanism in which the proteinase, having initiated cleavage of the scissile bond between P1 and P1′of the serpin and being covalently linked to the P1 residue, is translocated 70 Å from one pole of the serpin to the other resulting, in a full insertion of the RCL into the body of the serpin (3Stratikos E.

In the absence of a fast distortion of the catalytic triad of the proteinase, the latter remains active and cleaves the bond between its active site and the P1 residue, resulting in a cleaved, inactivated serpin (Scheme 1, I*) and active proteinase. Typically, these two possible pathways are designated inhibitory (ki) and substrate (ks) reaction, respectively (Scheme 1). The increase in the fraction of the substrate reaction can be expressed quantitatively by the stoichiometry of inhibition (SI = 1 + ks/ki), i.e. the number of moles of PAI-1 required for inactivation of one mole of proteinase (9Lawrence D.A.

Among these, MA-8H9D4 has been shown to interfere with the final locking step in the serpin/proteinase interaction, and the epitope was found to be composed of the amino acids at position 300, 303, and 305 in PAI-1 (see Fig. 1) (16Naessens D. Gils A. Compernolle G. Declerck P.J. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2003; 1: 1028-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, long term in vivo use of monoclonal antibodies is excluded because of their unfavorable pharmacological and immunological properties. Although their putative contribution to rational drug design is well recognized, it is virtually impossible to predict whether a small molecule designed on the paratope/epitope interaction will exert the same inhibiting effect as the corresponding antibody. The current study describes an innovative approach to evaluate at an early stage whether targeting the functional epitope is to be considered. Our strategy, based upon the introduction of a cysteine at the putative target site and a subsequent evaluation of the functional effects of covalently linked Cys labeling reagents, indeed shows that small molecules can exert an effect comparable with that of the corresponding monoclonal antibody.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDNA Preparation—Mutagenesis was carried out by standard procedures, basically as described before (21Bijnens A.P. Gils A. Knockaert I. Stassen J.M. Declerck P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6375-6380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The presence of the mutation together with the absence of any unwanted mutation was verified by nucleotide sequencing.Protein Preparation and Purification—Expression and purification of wild-type PAI-1 and PAI-1 variants was performed as described previously, with minor modifications (22Gils A. Knockaert I. Declerck P.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7474-7481Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 23Sancho E. Tonge D.W. Hockney R.C. Booth N.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Purified proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE for evaluation of their purity, pooled, and stored in aliquots at -20 °C until use. The amount of PAI-1 protein in purified preparations was determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm (absorbance coefficient A1 cm1%=10).Preparation of Labeled PAI-1 Cysteine Mutants—A PAI-1 cysteine mutant diluted to 0.8-1.0 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.2) was first incubated with 100 mm dithiothreitol at room temperature for 30 min to activate the thiol group. Then dithiothreitol was removed by gel filtration on a NAP-25 column equilibrated and eluted with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 m Arg/HCl and 5 mm EDTA. Subsequently, the label, either N-(4,4-difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4adiaza-s-indacene-3-yl)methyl)iodoacetamide (BODIPY® FL C1-IA, BDYFLIA (see Fig. 1C)) or N-(4,4-difluoro-5,7-diphenyl-4-bora-3a, 4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-propionyl)-N′-iodoacetylethylenediamine (BODIPY® 530/550 IA, BDYIA (see Fig. 1D)) (Molecular Probes) (stock solution of 5 mg/3.5 ml 100% Me2SO), was added immediately to the PAI-1 variant at a 10-fold molar excess. The labeling reaction was performed in the dark for 1 h at room temperature and continued at 4 °C for 16 h. After the labeling reaction, the reaction mixture was centrifuged for 15 min at 3500 rpm to remove any precipitated protein. The excess of BODIPY® was then removed using a NAP-25 column equilibrated and eluted with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2. PAI-1 samples collected before and after labeling were either analyzed directly or stored at -20 °C until use. Wild-type PAI-1 and PAI-1-stab were subjected to a similar treatment and served as a control.Quantitation and Characterization of the Labeled Protein—The concentration of PAI-1 and the extent of the incorporation of BODIPY® fluorophore were calculated from the absorbances of the fluorophore (λmax = 534 and 502 nm for BODIPY® 530/550 IA and BODIPY® FL C1-IA, respectively) and PAI-1 (λmax = 280 nm) by using the molar absorptivities of 75,400 cm-1 m-1, 77,300 cm-1 m-1, and 43,000 cm-1 m-1 for BODIPY® 530/550 IA, BODIPY® FL C1-IA, and PAI-1, respectively.Determination of the Functional Distribution of (Labeled) PAI-1 Variants—PAI-1 samples were diluted with phosphate-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.2) to a concentration of 150 μg/ml and incubated for 25 min at 37 °C with t-PA at a 2-fold molar excess. The reaction was terminated by adding SDS (final concentration of 1%) and heating for 30 s at 100 °C. Reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 10-15% gradient gels with the Phastsystem™ (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and quantified by densitometric scanning with the Imagemaster™ (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (22Gils A. Knockaert I. Declerck P.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7474-7481Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONBased upon the mechanism of inactivation and the position of the epitope of the monoclonal antibody MA-8H9D4, we hypothesized that residues 300, 303, and 305 may represent excellent targetable positions to evaluate the proof of the concept of the newly proposed approach. Therefore, the following mutants were generated in which the respective residue was mutated to a cysteine: PAI-1-R300C, PAI-1-Q303C, and PAI-1-D305C (Fig. 1).It should be noted that PAI-1 is distinguished from other serpins by the facile insertion of its RCL, resulting in the spontaneous transformation of the unstable, active form to a stable, inactive latent conformation. This conformational transition is characterized with a half-life of 2.5 h at 37 °C (24Hekman C.M. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11581-11587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the corresponding mutations were also introduced in a functionally stable variant of PAI-1, termed PAI-1-stab, which has a functional half-life of about 150 h (25Nar H. Bauer M. Stassen J.M. Lang D. Gils A. Declerck P.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 683-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This will allow us to exclude that the observations obtained with wild-type PAI-1 and its respective variants are linked to their ability to convert to the latent form.After expression and purification, the proteins, including wild-type PAI-1 and PAI-1-stab serving as a control, were treated with either BODIPY® FL C1-IA (BDYFLIA, Fig. 1C) or BODIPY® 530/550 IA (BDYIA, Fig. 1D). After removal of the unbound label, the degree of labeling was determined, revealing 65-100% efficiency for the Cys mutants in wild-type PAI-1 and 100% efficiency for the Cys mutants in PAI-1-stab. Wild-type PAI-1 and PAI-1-stab, not containing any cysteines, showed less then 10% of labeling as expected, confirming a sulfhydryl-specific labeling reaction. The functional distribution (i.e. percentage of active, latent and cleavable PAI-1) and the corresponding SI value were then determined toward its natural target t-PA.Replacement of the amino acids involved in the epitope of MA-8H9D4 (Arg-300, Gln-303, and Asp-305) by a cysteine may have a small but significant effect on the SI value as compared with that of wild-type PAI-1 (WT PAI-1, SI = 1.3 ± 0.0) (Table I). Introduction of a Cys residue at position 305 in wild-type PAI-1 increases the SI value to 2.0 ± 0.1 (p < 0.05 versus WT PAI-1), whereas introduction of Cys at position 300 or 303 does not lead to a significant increase in SI value (SI = 1.3 ± 0.1 and 1.6 ± 0.2, respectively; p > 0.05 versus WT PAI-1). Introduction of a Cys residue at position 300, 303, or 305 in PAI-1-stab (SI = 1.6 ± 0.1) changes the SI values to 1.4 ± 0.0, 1.4 ± 0.1, and 1.7 ± 0.1, respectively (p < 0.05 versus PAI-1-stab). The observation that mere substitution by a Cys residue affects the functional distribution of PAI-1 is in line with the hypothesis that this region plays an important role in the final step of the serpin/proteinase complex (Fig. 1) (5Huntington J.A.

Open table in a new tab Cys-specific labeling of the constructed variants resulted in an increase in cleaved material concomitant with a decrease in stable complex formation (Fig. 2). Whereas for wild-type PAI-1 (subjected to the labeling procedure), the SI value remains virtually unchanged (p > 0.05 for both labels), a significant increase can be seen for the labeled mutants (Table 1A). Labeling at position 300 leads to a 1.7-fold increase in SI value for BDYIA and a 2.2-fold increase for BDYFLIA (p < 0.001 versus WT PAI-1). Labeling at position 303 increases the ratio 3.3-1.9-fold (p < 0.05 versus WT PAI-1). Labeling at position 305 increases the ratio 3.1-fold for both labels (p < 0.05 versus WT PAI-1). Strikingly, the effect of Cys introduction and subsequent labeling on the SI values is comparable with the effect induced by the monoclonal antibody or its scFv derivative under comparable experimental conditions (Table I) (14Debrock S.

Overall, the results obtained with this stable variant reinforce the observations obtained with the variants in wild-type PAI-1 (Fig. 2 and Table I). Whereas for PAI-1-stab, the SI value remains unchanged (SI = 1.6-1.7, p > 0.05), labeling at position 300 leads to a 1.6-fold increase in SI value for BDYIA (p < 0.0001 versus PAI-1-stab) and a 1.1-fold increase for BDYFLIA (p < 0.01 versus PAI-1-stab). Labeling at position 303 increases the ratio 2.2-1.3-fold (p < 0.001 versus PAI-1-stab). Labeling at position 305 increases the ratio 4.9-fold for BDYIA (p < 0.0001 versus PAI-1-stab) and 2.0-fold for BDYFLIA (p < 0.00001 versus PAI-1-stab). From these results, it is clear that the larger label (BDYIA) exerts a more dramatic effect on the SI value, indicating that the efficiency of an inhibitor targeted to this region is clearly size-dependent (Table I and Fig. 2). The highest SI value is seen for PAI-1-stab-D305C labeled with BDYIA, corresponding to an 84% reduction in activity in comparison with PAI-1-stab. As observed in wild-type PAI-1, these effects are comparable with those induced by the monoclonal antibody.Taken together, our data clearly demonstrate that the method described here can be used to test whether development of small compounds, targeted to the epitope of an inhibitory monoclonal antibody, may eventually result in a successful inhibition of the functional properties of the antigen. If the Cys labeling-based screening reveals that the labels used exert an effect comparable with that observed for the corresponding antibody, it is meaningful to look for peptides or peptidomimetics, e.g. based on the paratope of the antibody, with a similar size as the labels. The labels used in this study have a molecular mass of 626 and 417 Da, corresponding to the size of a pentapeptide and tri- or tetrapeptide, respectively. The design and optimization of such peptides/peptidomimetics may ultimately lead to low molecular weight compounds that possess the selectivity of the antibody but have superior pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) 1The abbreviations used are: PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; t-PA, tissue-type plasminogen activator; RCL, reactive center loop; WT, wild type; stab, stable. 1The abbreviations used are: PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; t-PA, tissue-type plasminogen activator; RCL, reactive center loop; WT, wild type; stab, stable. is the most important physiological inhibitor of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) (1Kruithof E.K. Tran Thang C. Ransijn A. Bachmann F. Blood. 1984; 64: 907-913Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It plays an important role in the regulation of the fibrinolytic activity in human blood (2van Meijer M. Pannekoek H. Fibrinolysis. 1995; 9: 261-276Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The protein contains no cysteines. PAI-1 is a member of the superfamily of the serpins (serine proteinase inhibitors), glycoproteins with a reactive center loop (RCL) comprising the active site (P1-P1′ residues) that interacts with the proteinase (see Fig. 1). Active, inhibitory serpins can inhibit serine proteinases (e.g. t-PA) by a remarkably conformational change-based mechanism in which the proteinase, having initiated cleavage of the scissile bond between P1 and P1′of the serpin and being covalently linked to the P1 residue, is translocated 70 Å from one pole of the serpin to the other resulting, in a full insertion of the RCL into the body of the serpin (3Stratikos E.

The kinetics of insertion as well as the length of the RCL play a critical role in this process, as it may affect the required rearrangements within the active site of the proteinase (Scheme 1, P), resulting in an impairment of the enzymatic activity and stabilization of the formed complex (5Huntington J.A. Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar) (Scheme 1, IPcpx) (7Plotnick M.I. Mayne L. Schechter N.M. Rubin H.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5455-5464Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In the absence of a fast distortion of the catalytic triad of the proteinase, the latter remains active and cleaves the bond between its active site and the P1 residue, resulting in a cleaved, inactivated serpin (Scheme 1, I*) and active proteinase. Typically, these two possible pathways are designated inhibitory (ki) and substrate (ks) reaction, respectively (Scheme 1). The increase in the fraction of the substrate reaction can be expressed quantitatively by the stoichiometry of inhibition (SI = 1 + ks/ki), i.e. the number of moles of PAI-1 required for inactivation of one mole of proteinase (9Lawrence D.A.
