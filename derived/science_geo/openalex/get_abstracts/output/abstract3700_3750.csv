https://openalex.org/W2062201957,"We have investigated by electron microscopy the mechanism of DNA compaction and have found that the double helix has the intrinsic potential to direct its own packaging into two distinctly different and mutally exclusive modes. The mode of DNA packaging is determined by the electrostatic charge density and water activity of the immediate microenvironment of the helix. The two basic structures formed by both linear and covalently closed-circular DNA are: a left-handed supercoil characteristic of minimally charge-shielded DNA, and a smooth rod characteristic of fully charge-shielded DNA. We propose that in the supercoil, the double helix is overwound (increased turn-angle), while in the rod, the helix is folded back and forth on itself. Variation of these two basic structures are the beaded fiber of DNA obtained with partially charge-shielded DNA and the toroid formed by the bending of the DNA rod and fusion of its ends in the presence of certain cations. We compare the DNA packaging inside these in vitro generated structures to DNA packaging in chromatin and viral capsids, and conclude that the packaging of DNA brought about by the use of salts and alcohol closely mimics the packaging behavior of the DNA in vivo, where it is usually complexed with histones or polyamines."

https://openalex.org/W2054475897,Female Aedes albopictus and Aedes togoi mosquitoes infected with Japanese encephalitis virus either by intrathoracic inoculation or by ingestion of a virus-sucrose-erythrocyte mixture transmitted the virus to a small percentage of their F1 progeny. Adult F1 female Aedes albopictus thus infected transmitted the virus in turn to newly hatched chickens by feeding on them.

https://openalex.org/W1530288812,"Thymidine kinase derived from LMTK+ does not exhibit thymidylate kinase activity. However, protein isolated by affinity column chromatography from thymidine kinase-deficient mouse cells (LMTK-) infected by herpes simplex virus type 1 shows thymidylate kinase activity in addition to thymidine kinase and deoxycytidine kinase activities. The virus-induced multifunctional enzyme has a molecular weight of 85,000, whereas the molecular weight of thymidylate kinase from uninfected LMTK- mouse cells is 71,000. The virus-induced enzyme has a Km for thymidine of 0.8 micromolar, and for thymidylate of 25 micromolar, and for thymidylate of 25 micromolar; the ratio of Vmax for thymidylate kinase to thymidine kinase is 1.7. When subjected to isoelectric focusing, thymidylate kinase activity is not separated from thymidine kinase activity, and even though four peaks of activity are observed they have a constant ratio of thymidylate kinase to thymidine kinase activity. The isoelectric points (pI) of these four peaks are 4.8, 5.8, 6.2, and 6.6, respectively. Thymidylate kinase, derived from uninfected cells when subjected to isoelectric focusing, separates into a major component with an isoelectric point at pH 8.2 and a minor component at pH 7.7. Although thymidine and thymidylate kinase activities derived from the virus-infected cells cannot be separated either by affinity column chromatography, glycerol density gradient centrifugation, or isoelectric focusing, there is a differential rate of inactivation when the enzyme is subjected to incubation at 37 degrees, with thymidylate kinase activity being more labile than thymidine kinase activity."

https://openalex.org/W1968069828,"A single gene (src) is responsible for neoplastic transformation induced by infection of fibroblasts with avian sarcoma viruses. We have reported previously that the DNAs of uninfected avian cells contain nucleotide sequences related to src, and that these sequences (denoted sarc) have been highly conserved during the evolution of birds ( Stehelin et al., 1976b Stehelin D. Varmus H.E. Bishop J.M. Vogt P.K. DNA related to the transforming gene(s) of avian sarcoma virus is present in normal avian DNA. Nature. 1976; 260: 170-173 Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar ). We now demonstrate that sarc is transcribed into RNA in a variety of normal and neoplastic avian cells and tissues, including cultured embryonic fibroblasts, normal embryos, normal adult tissues, fibrosarcomas induced by chemical carcinogens and cells explanted from these tumors into continuous culture. Since we detect no transcription from the genes for globin and ovalbumin in embryonic avian fibroblasts, we conclude that the presence of sarc RNA in normal cells cannot be attributed to a low constitutive level of transcription from all cellular genes. The amounts of sarc RNA are similar in normal and neoplastic cells, in embryos at all periods of development, and in both logarithmically growing and fully quiescent fibroblasts. Synthesis of sarc RNA in chicken cells is not coordinated with the expression of endogenous retrovirus genes; this finding conforms to other evidence that sarc is not linked to an endogenous viral genome. In the accompanying manuscript, we describe the characteristics of sarc RNA in normal and neoplastic avian cells, and we conclude that sarc is part of a large messenger RNA in both types of cells. Our data fail to implicate the expression of sarc in normal cellular growth, embryogenesis or chemical carcinogenesis, and the function of sarc remains unknown."

https://openalex.org/W2001042641,"While an attempt was being made to identify the source of the growth hormone releasing factor present in cerebral spinal fluid of man, it was discovered that cells of the rat amygdaloid nucleus, grown in tissue culture, produce a material that is immunologically and chromatographically identical to growth hormone found in the pituitary. Immunoperoxidase staining revealed dense accumulation of the peroxidase-antibody to growth hormone complex in amygdala cells. Significant amounts of growth hormone and adrenocorticotropin could be extracted from this limbic structure. Extracts containing immunoequivalent amounts of growth hormone were measured by bioassay in hypophysectomized rats. Stimulation of the growth of epiphyseal cartilage by extracts of the amygdala was comparable to the stimulation by extracts of anterior pituitary glands. The stimulatory effect of amygdala extracts on adrenal and gonadal size and weight and on growth of thyroid follicular epithelium was also comparable to that of pituitary extracts."

This factor also inhibits the enzyme collagenase derived from cultured human skin and collagenase extracted from human granulocytes. The addition of heparin to the PF4-collagenase assay system has no effect on the observed inhibition of collagenase. Thus PF4 inhibits collagenase, in addition to neutralizing heparin."

https://openalex.org/W1498647590,"A DNA-unwinding protein has been purified from regenerating rat liver cytosol to apparent homogeneity. The protein is present in about 10(6) copies per cell. It is a tetramer, composed of 25,000-dalton subunits which does not exhibit enzymatic activity for ATPase, DNA polymerase, or DNase. The protein is able to unwind the double helix of poly[d(A-T)], depressing the melting point of this synthetic polymer by about 40 degrees. It also binds to supercoiled SV40 DNA, probably by melting A-T-rich regions in the genome. The fully saturated complex of protein and SV40 DNA sediments at 30 S. Homologous DNA polymerases-alpha and -beta are stimulated by the protein at a different level depending on the templates used. This result argues in favor of the intervention of the unwinding protein in replication processes."

https://openalex.org/W1503904460,"In sarcoplasmic reticulum fragments, chemical reactivity of calcium ATPase -SH groups toward N-(1-oxyl-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidinyl)-iodoacetamide (ISL) was estimated by measuring the steady reduction in free label spectrum intensity during the labeling reaction. A few -SH groups reacted easily with ISL and activity was not inhibited. The reaction rate was highly sensitive to pH and temperature. Calcium chelation in the presence of magnesium accelerated the reaction slightly, and nucleotides accelerated if severalfold in the presence of calcium. The resulting spectra were also studied for the bound labels, after extensive washing of the nonreacted label. Compared to the spectrum obtained after labeling in the control calcium medium, the weakly immobilized signal of the spectrum of vesicles labeled in a chelated calcium medium was enhanced. On the other hand, the strongly immobilized signal was enhanced when vesicles were labeled in a medium containing calcium and nucleotides. This was taken as evidence that different -SH groups are selectively alkylated, according to the labeling medium. The present study confirms the calcium-induced modifications in the -SH environment reported previously and suggests new ways of searching for possible conformational events during the transport cycle in the membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1548490500,"Application of the pulse-chase procedure to study of the binding and utilization of ATP by glutamine-dependent carbamyl phosphate synthetase from Escherichia coli showed that the enzyme binds the two molecules of ATP used in this reaction at the same time, and that the two ATP-binding sites are functionally different. Thus, ATP bound to the first ATP site is used for carboxy phosphate formation, and ATP bound to the second ATP site is used for phosphorylation of carbamate. The present and previous findings support a mechanism that involves intermediate formation of two highly unstable intermediates: carboxy phosphate and carbamate. It is proposed that the presence of all of the reactants on the enzyme at the start of the catalytic cycle allows immediate utilization of these labile compounds in the carbamyl phosphate synthesis reaction."

https://openalex.org/W2011498918,"The pattern of integration for the infectious DNA of two avian reticuloendotheliosis viruses whose DNA is not inactivated by digestion with the restriction endonuclease, Eco RI was determined. High molecular weight DNA from infected chicken, turkey and pheasant cells was digested with Eco RI, electrophoresed through agarose gels and assayed for infectivity. The same patterns of integration of infectious viral DNA were found for these species of avian cells infected at high or low multiplicities with two reticuloendotheliosis viruses. There were multiple sites of integration in acutely infected cells with concomitant cell death. There was a single site of integration in chronically infected cells with no cell death. There were more integrated infectious viral DNA molecules per cell in acutely infected cells than in chronically infected cells. These results are consistent with the hypotheses that the cell death in the acute phase of infection is a result of the integration of the infectious viral DNA at multiple sites, and that only those cells survive that have the infectious viral DNA integrated exclusively at the single site."
https://openalex.org/W1537255582,"The DNA untwisting enzyme has been partially purified from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The enzyme exhibits a pH optimum of 7.3 to 7.6 in phosphate buffer, appears to require 0.15 M KCl for activity as determined by a DNA filter-binding assay, and is inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide. Like the untwisting enzymes from other eucaryotic cells, it can remove both positive and negative superhelical turns. A DNA molecule containing a single strand break was shown to be an intermediate in the untwisting reaction. Thermal stabilities of the enzyme from selected conditional lethal mutants defective in DNA synthesis have been examined and were found to be indistinguishable from the wild type enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1597855673,"A copper.protein complex present in the serum of a hypercupremic myeloma patient has been purified to homogeneity using gel filtration, DEAE-cellulose chromatography, and concanavalin A/Sepharose affinity chromatography. Immunoelectrophoresis and hemagglutination inhibition tests showed the copper-bound protein to be an IgG1-type immunoglobulin with lambda light chains. The immunoglobulin is of normal molecular weight (150,000) with normal size light and heavy chains (28,000 and 56,000, respectively). The carbohydrate portion of the molecule appears to be abnormal in that it interacts with concanavalin A, whereas most immunoglobulins of the gammaG-type do not. The copper in the native copper.IgG complex is in an EPR-indeterminable valence state. Copper was efficiently removed from the copper.IgG complex by dialysis against 0.1 M potassium cyanide. The apo-IgG was separated from the copper.cyanide complex by gel filtration. The copper complex was reconstituted by equilibrating the apo-IgG with 7.7 muM cupric ions."

https://openalex.org/W1498954646,"Rat thymic lymphocytes exposed to the cyclic AMP-elevating agent, adenosine, become refractory to a subsequent adenosine stimulation. This refractoriness appears distinct from types of refractoriness observed in other tissues. Here induction of refractoriness is not dependent on a prior adenosine stimulus per se but rather on the utilization of the ribose moiety as an energy source. Early addition of other energy-providing substrates, glucose or pyruvate, instead of adenosine also induces refractoriness to adenosine. These circumstances suggest that in this instance, the metabolic state of the cell rather than the presence of a prior stimulus may be the most important determinant. A refractoriness to the cyclic AMP-elevating action of prostaglandin E/sub 1/ also develops without a prior exposure to the stimulus. However, in this case, refractoriness develops rapidly even when no energy source is provided. The data indicate that for both adenosine and PGE/sub 1/, refractoriness is not the result of an accumulation of feedback inhibitors nor, at least for PGE/sub 1/ of a desensitization of adenylate cyclase. In both cases, the development of refractoriness is arrested by inhibiting protein synthesis with either cycloheximide or emetine. While under appropriate conditions, the onset of refractoriness may be fairly rapid, it does notmore » reverse as quickly; the addition of cycloheximide to partially refractory cells leads to only a slight restoration of responsiveness within 2 h. Although some other observations suggest that protein synthesis-dependent refractoriness may be a widespread phenomenon, at least in lymphoid tissues, its physiological meaning is at present poorly understood.« less"
https://openalex.org/W2011092555,"Cells dissociated from 1-day-old chick embryos produce a pulse of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP) when stimulated with cyclic AMP. There is a stimulus threshold concentration of about 10(-8) molar cyclic AMP and an upper limit, above which the response is suppressed, of about 6 X 10(-6) molar. The response occurs within 5 seconds of stimulation and corresponds to an average pulse size in the range of 10(7) molecules per cell."
https://openalex.org/W1555553627,"Human astrocytoma cells (EH118MG) respond to catecholamines and prostaglandins with a marked increase in the rate of formation of cyclic AMP. Treatment of EH118MG cells with cholera toxin (10 to 100 ng/ml) for 45 to 60 min caused an increase in cellular cyclic AMP content (5- to 10-fold over basal). Cholera toxin also decreased the K0.5 for isoproterenol 10- to 50-fold and decreased the K0.5 for prostaglandin E1 (PGE1)30- to 100-fold, while increasing the maximal response to PGE1 by 1.5- to 3-fold. Treatment with cholera toxin did not change the K1 values for beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists such as propranolol, alprenolol, and sotalol. Direct binding studies using [125I]iodohydroxybenzylpindolol indicated no significant changes in the number of beta-receptors or in the kinetics of the interaction of the radioligand with receptors after treatment of cells with the toxin. Competition binding studies with propranolol and sotalol revealed no toxin-induced change in Kd values for these antagonists. Treatment with cholera toxin caused only small decreases (2- to 3-fold) in the Kd values for binding of isoproterenol and norepinephrine. It is concluded that cholera toxin has little direct effect on the binding of agonists or antagonists to beta-receptors, but instead increases the efficiency of coupling of receptor and catalytic moieties of adenylate cyclase."
https://openalex.org/W1509089921,"Abstract Nuclear RNAs prepared from rat liver and rat hepatoma cell line H4AZC2 have been fractionated and examined for albumin mRNA sequences by annealing to specific albumin [3H]cDNA. In both instances, sucrose gradient analysis revealed nuclear RNA molecules containing albumin RNA sequences which sedimented at 26 S (26 S albumin RNA). In contrast, cytoplasmic albumin messenger RNA sediments exclusively at 17 S. 26 S albumin RNA is resistant to both heat denaturation (65 degrees C X 5 min) and denaturation in 85% formamide (v/v), and 75% of these molecules are polyadenylated.

https://openalex.org/W1592508082,"Crude receptor preparations of rabbit mammary gland were made by differential centrifugation and reacted with lactoperoxidase-iodinated ovine prolactin (oPRL) in order to determine their binding characteristics. Receptors prepared from the mammary glands of animals less than 4 days postpartum bound oPRL with high affinity (Ka = 3.50 X 10(9) M-1), in good agreement with previous results of other investigators. The binding capacity of these preparations was 107 +/- 16.3 fmol/mg of protein. In contrast, receptors prepared from the mammary glands of late lactating rabbits (Days 25 to 30 of lactation) showed a 2.5-fold increase in binding affinity (Ka = 8.63 X 10(9) M-1, p less than 0.001) without a significant increase in binding capacity (135 +/- 21.4 fmol/mg, p greater than 0.2). Kinetic experiments revealed that the rates of association of hormone and receptor were identical in early and late receptor preparations, and that the 2.5-fold decrease the dissociation rate observed in the late preparations was fully explanatory of the differences in equilibrium binding. The mechanism of this affinity increase is not known. Such a change in binding characteristics, which would tend to enhance tissue responsiveness, may underlie the well characterized maintenance of full lactation in women despite falling concentrations of prolactin."

https://openalex.org/W1512988004,"The nucleotide sequence for two-thirds of restriction endonuclease fragment EcoRII-F and part of RII-H of SV40 DNA is presented. This segment of SV40 DNA is complementary to the sequence near the 3' end of early mRNA. This sequence could be translated in one reading frame to form a large protein. However, in a second translational frame there are four AUG codons followed by 91 sense triplets, followed by a termination codon. These results provide the sequence for the entire 3' untranslated ends of SV40 early and late mRNAs and for the DNA beyond the 3' ends of the mRNAs. The ends of early and late mRNA are transcribed from the opposite strands of the same segment of DNA. At or beyond the 3' ends of both early and late mRNA are sequences whose transcripts would include uridylic acid-rich products."

However, the ability of isoproterenol to decrease the time to peak tension development during an individual contraction cycle is still present in sodium-free solutions. Removal of sodium diminished but did not eliminate the tissues' ability to elevate adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate in response to isoproterenol. The striking absence of an inotropic action by isoproterenol on atria in sodium-free media suggests that sodium (and possibly a sodium-calcium exchange across the sarcolemma) plays an important role in the inotropic action of catecholamines."

https://openalex.org/W1556824837,"Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase from Pseudomonas MA grown on methylamine as a sole carbon source is an allosteric enzyme activated by NADH. Activation is accompanied by a change in the sedimentation value of the enzyme from 12 S to 9 S. In this paper ADP is shown to be an inhibitor of the enzyme. ADP has its most potent effect on the NADH-activated enzyme. Kinetics of ADP inhibition in the presence of NADH and of NADH activation in the presence of ADP are allosteric. The presence of ADP prevents the decrease in sedimentation value in the presence of NADH. Cross-linking studies indicate that the 12 S form of the enzyme is a tetramer of identically sized subunits and that the 9 S form corresponds to a dimer. The cross-linked enzyme is active and is activated by NADH and inhibited by ADP. It is proposed that NADH and ADP are a regulatory pair for this enzyme and reflect the energy status of the organism, allowing the carboxylase to control the flow of carbon into anabolic or catabolic pathways."
