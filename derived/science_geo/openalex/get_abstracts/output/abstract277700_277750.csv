https://openalex.org/W2001600242,"Changes in the invertebrate fauna of a California rocky intertidal community between the period 1931 to 1933 and the period 1993 to 1994 indicate that species' ranges shifted northward, consistent with predictions of change associated with climate warming. Of 45 invertebrate species, the abundances of eight of nine southern species increased and the abundances of five of eight northern species decreased. No trend was evident for cosmopolitan species. Annual mean shoreline ocean temperatures at the site increased by 0.75 degrees C during the past 60 years, and mean summer maximum temperatures from 1983 to 1993 were 2.2 degrees C warmer than for the period 1921 to 1931."
https://openalex.org/W2069514727,"Described here is a method, based on Glover's taboo search for discrete functions, of solving the multiple minima problem for continuous functions. As demonstrated by model calculations, the algorithm avoids entrapment in local minima and continues the search to give a near-optimal final solution. Unlike other methods of global optimization, this procedure is generally applicable, easy to implement, derivative-free, and conceptually simple."

https://openalex.org/W2071087366,"High-resolution and in situ electron microscopy of vanadyl pyrophosphate catalysts reacted in alkane (n-butane) and other reducing environments have shown evidence for surface structure modifications accompanied by two sets of symmetry-related extended defects. Defect analysis reveals that the defects are formed by pure (glide) shear mechanism. The defect mechanism suggests the presence of basal (coplanar) anion vacancies, associated with Lewis acid centers, at oxygen sites linking corner-sharing phosphorus tetrahedra and vanadyl octahedra in the active plane. These in-plane defect sites may be key to the activation of the alkane, especially in the dehydrogenation."

This study shows that the most recent portion of the global temperature record (1970 to 1992) can be closely reproduced by atmospheric models forced only with observed ocean surface temperatures. In agreement with a diverse suite of controversial observational evidence from the past 40 years, the upward trend in simulated tropospheric temperatures is caused by an enhancement of the tropical hydrologic cycle driven by increasing tropical ocean temperatures. Although it is possible that the observed behavior is due to natural climate variability, there is disquieting similarity between these model results, observed climate trends in recent decades, and the early expressions of the climatic response to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide in numerical simulations."
https://openalex.org/W2025748740,"Comparisons of TOPEX/POSEIDON tidal solutions derived from the data of the first year of this altimetric mission with the best previous models and with in situ data show very substantial improvements. Typically, the gain in accuracy for the major lunar tidal component M(2) is 30 percent in root-mean-square differences with reference to a standard ground truth data set from 78 stations distributed over the world ocean. This is a major step, obtained because of the high quality of these altimetric data. The combination of these data with recent numerical models through assimilation methods is pointing toward solutions at the ultimate limits of practical accuracy."

https://openalex.org/W2001437521,"Dynamic surface force measurements of the response of a smectic A to layer normal stress exhibited time dependence for topological events in which single smectic layers were added or removed. Single layer-sized jumps in sample thickness had a rapid component of duration of approximately 1 second that produced most of the change in separation, but that was heralded by a slow precursor acceleration in separation, which began up to a few hundred seconds before. This avalanche-like dynamic signature is consistent with a relaxation mechanism based on the Glaberson-Clem-Bourdon instability of vortex lines (screw dislocations) in the smectic order parameter."

https://openalex.org/W2045293819,A bill introduced by Representative Rober Walker (R-Pa) steps up government spending on research into hydrogen and demonstrate its potential as an alternative transportation fuel. This article describes both Walker`s long term interest in hydrogen as a clean and infinitely renewable source of energy and the provisions of the bill.
https://openalex.org/W2087567121,"Articles in the popular press indicate controversy surrounding the reality of global warming. However greenhouse models predict more warming that is presently apparent. For climate change to live up to predictions, the minimal warming of the 1980`s will have to accelerate into the next millenium."

The magnification of the instrument is produced in three stages. The instrument has improved air locks, hydraulically operated stage movement, and a stage tilting device up to ±15½°. It is also provided with means for bright and dark field illumination and for conversion into a diffraction camera. Improved electrical circuits provide the necessary stability of the power supplies."
