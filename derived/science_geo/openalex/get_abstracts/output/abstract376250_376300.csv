https://openalex.org/W1972359743,"A variety of human activities have led to the recent global decline of reef-building corals. The ecological, social, and economic value of coral reefs has made them an international conservation priority. The success of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in restoring fish populations has led to optimism that they could also benefit corals by indirectly reducing threats like overfishing, which cause coral degradation and mortality. However, the general efficacy of MPAs in increasing coral reef resilience has never been tested.We compiled a global database of 8534 live coral cover surveys from 1969-2006 to compare annual changes in coral cover inside 310 MPAs to unprotected areas. We found that on average, coral cover within MPAs remained constant, while coral cover on unprotected reefs declined. Although the short-term differences between unprotected and protected reefs are modest, they could be significant over the long-term if the effects are temporally consistent. Our results also suggest that older MPAs were generally more effective in preventing coral loss. Initially, coral cover continued to decrease after MPA establishment. Several years later, however, rates of coral cover decline slowed and then stabilized so that further losses stopped.These findings suggest that MPAs can be a useful tool not only for fisheries management, but also for maintaining coral cover. Furthermore, the benefits of MPAs appear to increase with the number of years since MPA establishment. Given the time needed to maximize MPA benefits, there should be increased emphasis on implementing new MPAs and strengthening the enforcement of existing MPAs."

The ankle then acts to restore energy during push-off, which may be the reason that ankle impairment nearly always leads to poorer walking economy. The replacement of lost energy is necessary for steady gait, in which mechanical energy is constant on average, external dissipation is negligible, and no net work is performed over a stride. However, dissipation and replacement by muscles might not be necessary if energy were instead captured and reused by an assistive device.We developed a microprocessor-controlled artificial foot that captures some of the energy that is normally dissipated by the leg and ""recycles"" it as positive ankle work. In tests on subjects walking with an artificially-impaired ankle, a conventional prosthesis reduced ankle push-off work and increased net metabolic energy expenditure by 23% compared to normal walking. Energy recycling restored ankle push-off to normal and reduced the net metabolic energy penalty to 14%.These results suggest that reduced ankle push-off contributes to the increased metabolic energy expenditure accompanying ankle impairments, and demonstrate that energy recycling can be used to reduce such cost."
https://openalex.org/W2016704574,"Background The Notch pathway is essential for proper epidermal differentiation during embryonic skin development. Moreover, skin specific loss of Notch signaling in the embryo results in skin barrier defects accompanied by a B-lymphoproliferative disease. However, much less is known about the consequences of loss of Notch signaling after birth. Methodology and Principal Findings To study the function of Notch signaling in the skin of adult mice, we made use of a series of conditional gene targeted mice that allow inactivation of several components of the Notch signaling pathway specifically in the skin. We demonstrate that skin-specific inactivation of Notch1 and Notch2 simultaneously, or RBP-J, induces the development of a severe form of atopic dermatitis (AD), characterized by acanthosis, spongiosis and hyperkeratosis, as well as a massive dermal infiltration of eosinophils and mast cells. Likewise, patients suffering from AD, but not psoriasis or lichen planus, have a marked reduction of Notch receptor expression in the skin. Loss of Notch in keratinocytes induces the production of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), a cytokine deeply implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. The AD-like associated inflammation is accompanied by a myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) characterized by an increase in immature myeloid populations in the bone marrow and spleen. Transplantation studies revealed that the MPD is cell non-autonomous and caused by dramatic microenvironmental alterations. Genetic studies demontrated that G-CSF mediates the MPD as well as changes in the bone marrow microenvironment leading to osteopenia. Significance Our data demonstrate a critical role for Notch in repressing TSLP production in keratinocytes, thereby maintaining integrity of the skin and the hematopoietic system."
https://openalex.org/W2135783216,"Myocardial hypertrophy is frequently associated with poor clinical outcomes including the development of cardiac systolic and diastolic dysfunction and ultimately heart failure. To prevent cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure, it is necessary to identify and characterize molecules that may regulate the hypertrophic program. Our present study reveals that nuclear factor of activated T cells c3 (NFATc3) and myocardin constitute a hypertrophic pathway that can be targeted by miR-9. Our results show that myocardin expression is elevated in response to hypertrophic stimulation with isoproterenol and aldosterone. In exploring the molecular mechanism by which myocardin expression is elevated, we identified that NFATc3 can bind to the promoter region of myocardin and transcriptionally activate its expression. Knockdown of myocardin can attenuate hypertrophic responses triggered by NFATc3, suggesting that myocardin can be a downstream mediator of NFATc3 in the hypertrophic cascades. MicroRNAs are a class of small noncoding RNAs that mediate post-transcriptional gene silencing. Our data reveal that miR-9 can suppress myocardin expression. However, the hypertrophic stimulation with isoproterenol and aldosterone leads to a decrease in the expression levels of miR-9. Administration of miR-9 could attenuate cardiac hypertrophy and ameliorate cardiac function. Taken together, our data demonstrate that NFATc3 can promote myocardin expression, whereas miR-9 is able to suppress myocardin expression, thereby regulating cardiac hypertrophy.

https://openalex.org/W2050733201,"Recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) activates the innate immune response. Although PRR-mediated signaling events are critical to the survival of plants and animals, secretion and localization of PRRs have not yet been clearly elucidated. Here we report the in vivo interaction of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone BiP3 with the rice XA21 PRR, which confers resistance to the Gram negative bacterium, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). We show that XA21 is glycosylated and is primarily localized to the ER and also to the plasma membrane (PM). In BiP3-overexpressing rice plants, XA21-mediated immunity is compromised, XA21 stability is significantly decreased, and XA21 proteolytic cleavage is inhibited. BiP3 overexpression does not affect the general rice defense response, cell death or brassinolide-induced responses. These results indicate that BiP3 regulates XA21 protein stability and processing and that this regulation is critical for resistance to Xoo."
https://openalex.org/W2107709500,"Disturbances in the circadian pacemaker system are commonly found in individuals with depression and sleep-related problems. We hypothesized that some of the canonical circadian clock genes would be associated with depression accompanied by signs of disturbed sleep, early morning awakening, or daytime fatigue. We tested this hypothesis in a population-based sample of the Health 2000 dataset from Finland, including 384 depressed individuals and 1270 controls, all with detailed information on sleep and daytime vigilance, and analyzed this set of individuals with regard to 113 single-nucleotide polymorphisms of 18 genes of the circadian system. We found significant association between TIMELESS variants and depression with fatigue (D+FAT+) (rs7486220: pointwise P = 0.000099, OR = 1.66; corrected empirical P for the model of D+FAT+ = 0.0056; haplotype ‘C-A-A-C’ of rs2291739-rs2291738-rs7486220-rs1082214: P = 0.0000075, OR = 1.72) in females, and association to depression with early morning awakening (D+EMA+) (rs1082214: pointwise P = 0.0009, OR = 2.70; corrected empirical P = 0.0374 for the model D+EMA+; haplotype ‘G-T’ of rs7486220 and rs1082214: P = 0.0001, OR = 3.01) in males. There was significant interaction of gender and TIMELESS (for example with rs1082214, P = 0.000023 to D+EMA+ and P = 0.005 to D+FAT+). We obtained supported evidence for involvement of TIMELESS in sleeping problems in an independent set of control individuals with seasonal changes in mood, sleep duration, energy level and social activity in females (P = 0.036, ® = 0.123 for rs1082214) and with early morning awakening or fatigue in males (P = 0.038 and P = 0.0016, respectively, for rs1082214). There was also some evidence of interaction between TIMELESS and PER1 in females to D+FAT+ as well as between TIMELESS and ARNTL, RORA or NR1D1 in males to D+EMA+. These findings support a connection between circadian genes and gender-dependent depression and defective sleep regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2002364726,"Background Inflammation is a highly complex biological response evoked by many stimuli. A persistent challenge in modeling this dynamic process has been the (nonlinear) nature of the response that precludes the single-variable assumption. Systems-based approaches offer a promising possibility for understanding inflammation in its homeostatic context. In order to study the underlying complexity of the acute inflammatory response, an agent-based framework is developed that models the emerging host response as the outcome of orchestrated interactions associated with intricate signaling cascades and intercellular immune system interactions. Methodology/Principal Findings An agent-based modeling (ABM) framework is proposed to study the nonlinear dynamics of acute human inflammation. The model is implemented using NetLogo software. Interacting agents involve either inflammation-specific molecules or cells essential for the propagation of the inflammatory reaction across the system. Spatial orientation of molecule interactions involved in signaling cascades coupled with the cellular heterogeneity are further taken into account. The proposed in silico model is evaluated through its ability to successfully reproduce a self-limited inflammatory response as well as a series of scenarios indicative of the nonlinear dynamics of the response. Such scenarios involve either a persistent (non)infectious response or innate immune tolerance and potentiation effects followed by perturbations in intracellular signaling molecules and cascades. Conclusions/Significance The ABM framework developed in this study provides insight on the stochastic interactions of the mediators involved in the propagation of endotoxin signaling at the cellular response level. The simulation results are in accordance with our prior research effort associated with the development of deterministic human inflammation models that include transcriptional dynamics, signaling, and physiological components. The hypothetical scenarios explored in this study would potentially improve our understanding of how manipulating the behavior of the molecular species could manifest into emergent behavior of the overall system."
https://openalex.org/W2047134903,"Diseases often display complex and distinct associations with their environment due to differences in etiology, modes of transmission between hosts, and the shifting balance between pathogen virulence and host resistance. Statistical modeling has been underutilized in coral disease research to explore the spatial patterns that result from this triad of interactions. We tested the hypotheses that: 1) coral diseases show distinct associations with multiple environmental factors, 2) incorporating interactions (synergistic collinearities) among environmental variables is important when predicting coral disease spatial patterns, and 3) modeling overall coral disease prevalence (the prevalence of multiple diseases as a single proportion value) will increase predictive error relative to modeling the same diseases independently. Four coral diseases: Porites growth anomalies (PorGA), Porites tissue loss (PorTL), Porites trematodiasis (PorTrem), and Montipora white syndrome (MWS), and their interactions with 17 predictor variables were modeled using boosted regression trees (BRT) within a reef system in Hawaii. Each disease showed distinct associations with the predictors. Environmental predictors showing the strongest overall associations with the coral diseases were both biotic and abiotic. PorGA was optimally predicted by a negative association with turbidity, PorTL and MWS by declines in butterflyfish and juvenile parrotfish abundance respectively, and PorTrem by a modal relationship with Porites host cover. Incorporating interactions among predictor variables contributed to the predictive power of our models, particularly for PorTrem. Combining diseases (using overall disease prevalence as the model response), led to an average six-fold increase in cross-validation predictive deviance over modeling the diseases individually. We therefore recommend coral diseases to be modeled separately, unless known to have etiologies that respond in a similar manner to particular environmental conditions. Predictive statistical modeling can help to increase our understanding of coral disease ecology worldwide."
https://openalex.org/W2069910044,"To date, most studies comparing prospective and retrospective timing have failed to use long durations and tasks with a certain degree of ecological validity. The present study assessed the effect of the timing paradigm on playing video games in a ""naturalistic environment"" (gaming centers). In addition, as it involved gamers, it provided an opportunity to examine the effect of gaming profile on time estimation. A total of 116 participants were asked to estimate prospectively or retrospectively a video game session lasting 12, 35 or 58 minutes. The results indicate that time is perceived as longer in the prospective paradigm than in the retrospective one, although the variability of estimates is the same. Moreover, the 12-minute session was perceived as longer, proportionally, than the 35- and 58-minute sessions. The study also revealed that the number of hours participants spent playing video games per week was a significant predictor of time estimates. To account for the main findings, the differences between prospective and retrospective timing are discussed in quantitative terms using a proposed theoretical framework, which states that both paradigms use the same cognitive processes, but in different proportions. Finally, the hypothesis that gamers play more because they underestimate time is also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2151026822,"Background Albeit several studies pointed out the pivotal role that CD4+T cells have in Multiple Sclerosis, the CD8+ T cells involvement in the pathology is still in its early phases of investigation. Proteasome degradation is the key step in the production of MHC class I-restricted epitopes and therefore its activity could be an important element in the activation and regulation of autoreactive CD8+ T cells in Multiple Sclerosis. Methodology/Principal Findings Immunoproteasomes and PA28-αβ regulator are present in MS affected brain area and accumulated in plaques. They are expressed in cell types supposed to be involved in MS development such as neurons, endothelial cells, oligodendrocytes, macrophages/macroglia and lymphocytes. Furthermore, in a genetic study on 1262 Italian MS cases and 845 controls we observed that HLA-A*02+ female subjects carrying the immunoproteasome LMP2 codon 60HH variant have a reduced risk to develop MS. Accordingly, immunoproteasomes carrying the LMP2 60H allele produce in vitro a lower amount of the HLA-A*0201 restricted immunodominant epitope MBP111–119. Conclusion/Significance The immunoproteasome LMP2 60HH variant reduces the risk to develop MS amongst Italian HLA-A*02+ females. We propose that such an effect is mediated by the altered proteasome-dependent production of a specific MBP epitope presented on the MHC class I. Our observations thereby support the hypothesis of an involvement of immunoproteasome in the MS pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2056317328,"Treatments by HEWs in the health posts and general health workers at health facility were compared along a community-randomized trial. Costs were analysed from societal perspective in 2007 in US $ using standard methods. We prospectively enrolled smear positive patients, and calculated cost-effectiveness as the cost per patient successfully treated. The total cost for each successfully treated smear-positive patient was higher in health facility ($158.9) compared with community ($61.7). Community-based treatment reduced the total, patient and caregiver cost by 61.2%, 68.1% and 79.8%, respectively. Involving HEWs added a total cost of $8.80 (14.3% of total cost) on health service per patient treated in the community.Community-based treatment by HEWs costs only 39% of what treatment by general health workers costs for similar outcomes. Involving HEWs in TB treatment is a cost effective treatment alternative to the health service, to the patients and the family. There is an economic and public health reason to consider involving HEWs in TB treatment in Ethiopia. However, community-based treatment requires initial investment to start its implementation, training and supervision.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00803322."
https://openalex.org/W2034444563,"Non-motor symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety, and cognitive deficits) in patients with Parkinson disease (PD) precede the onset of the motor symptoms. Although these symptoms do not respond to pharmacological dopamine replacement therapy, their precise pathological mechanisms are currently unclear. The present study was undertaken to examine whether the unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion to the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), which represents a model of long-term dopaminergic neurotoxicity, could affect cell proliferation in the adult rat brain. Furthermore, we examined the effects of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine and the selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor maprotiline on the reduction in cell proliferation in the subgranular zone (SGZ) by the unilateral 6-OHDA lesion.A single unilateral injection of 6-OHDA into the rat SNc resulted in an almost complete loss of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity in the striatum and SNc, as well as in reductions of TH-positive cells and fibers in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). On the other hand, an injection of vehicle alone showed no overt change in TH immunoreactivity. A unilateral 6-OHDA lesion to SNc significantly decreased cell proliferation in the SGZ ipsilateral to the 6-OHDA lesion, but not in the contralateral SGZ or the subventricular zone (SVZ), of rats. Furthermore, subchronic (14 days) administration of fluoxetine (5 mg/kg/day), but not maprotiline significantly attenuated the reduction in cell proliferation in the SGZ by unilateral 6-OHDA lesion.The present study suggests that cell proliferation in the SGZ of the dentate gyrus might be, in part, under dopaminergic control by SNc and VTA, and that subchronic administration of fluoxetine reversed the reduction in cell proliferation in the SGZ by 6-OHDA. Therefore, SSRIs such as fluoxetine might be potential therapeutic drugs for non-motor symptoms as well as motor symptoms in patients with PD, which might be associated with the reduction in cell proliferation in the SGZ."
https://openalex.org/W2066069844,"Background Postnatal glucocorticoid therapy in premature infants diminishes chronic lung disease, but it also increases the risk of hypertension in adulthood. Since glucocorticoid excess leads to overproduction of free radicals and endothelial dysfunction, this study tested the hypothesis that adverse effects on cardiovascular function of postnatal glucocorticoids are secondary to oxidative stress. Therefore, combined postnatal treatment of glucocorticoids with antioxidants may diminish unwanted effects. Methodology/Principal Findings Male rat pups received a course of dexamethasone (Dex), or Dex with vitamins C and E (DexCE), on postnatal days 1–6 (P1–6). Controls received vehicle (Ctrl) or vehicle with vitamins (CtrlCE). At P21, femoral vascular reactivity was determined via wire myography. Dex, but not DexCE or CtrlCE, increased mortality relative to Ctrl (81.3 versus 96.9 versus 90.6 versus 100% survival, respectively; P<0.05). Constrictor responses to phenylephrine (PE) and thromboxane were enhanced in Dex relative to Ctrl (84.7±4.8 versus 67.5±5.7 and 132.7±4.9 versus 107.0±4.9% Kmax, respectively; P<0.05); effects that were diminished in DexCE (58.3±7.5 and 121.1±4.3% Kmax, respectively; P<0.05). Endothelium-dependent dilatation was depressed in Dex relative to Ctrl (115.3±11.9 versus 216.9±18.9, AUC; P<0.05); however, this effect was not restored in DexCE (68.3±8.3, AUC). Relative to Ctrl, CtrlCE alone diminished PE-induced constriction (43.4±3.7% Kmax) and the endothelium-dependent dilatation (74.7±8.7 AUC; P<0.05). Conclusions/Significance Treatment of newborn rats with dexamethasone has detrimental effects on survival and peripheral vasoconstrictor function. Coadministration of dexamethasone with antioxidant vitamins improves survival and partially restores vascular dysfunction. Antioxidant vitamins alone affect peripheral vascular function."
https://openalex.org/W2095498182,"Background The human innate immune system relies on the coordinated activity of macrophages and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (neutrophils or PMNs) for defense against bacterial pathogens. Yersinia spp. subvert the innate immune response to cause disease in humans. In particular, the Yersinia outer protein YopJ (Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis) and YopP (Y. enterocolitica) rapidly induce apoptosis in murine macrophages and dendritic cells. However, the effects of Yersinia Yop J/P on neutrophil fate are not clearly defined. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we utilized wild-type and mutant strains of Yersinia to test the contribution of YopJ and YopP on induction of apoptosis in human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDM) and neutrophils. Whereas YopJ and YopP similarly induced apoptosis in HMDMs, interaction of human neutrophils with virulence plasmid-containing Yersinia did not result in PMN caspase activation, release of LDH, or loss of membrane integrity greater than PMN controls. In contrast, interaction of human PMNs with the virulence plasmid-deficient Y. pestis strain KIM6 resulted in increased surface exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) and cell death. PMN reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was inhibited in a virulence plasmid-dependent but YopJ/YopP-independent manner. Following phagocytic interaction with Y. pestis strain KIM6, inhibition of PMN ROS production with diphenyleneiodonium chloride resulted in a reduction of PMN cell death similar to that induced by the virulence plasmid-containing strain Y. pestis KIM5. Conclusions Our findings showed that Yersinia YopJ and/or YopP did not induce pronounced apoptosis in human neutrophils. Furthermore, robust PMN ROS production in response to virulence plasmid-deficient Yersinia was associated with increased PMN cell death, suggesting that Yersinia inhibition of PMN ROS production plays a role in evasion of the human innate immune response in part by limiting PMN apoptosis."

ICP can be complicated by preterm labor and intrauterine death. The impact of P4-S on bile acid uptake was studied using two experimental models of hepatic uptake of bile acids, namely cultured primary human hepatocytes (PHH) and Na+-taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP)-expressing Xenopus laevis oocytes. Two P4-S compounds, allopregnanolone-sulfate (PM4-S) and epiallopregnanolone-sulfate (PM5-S), reduced [3H]taurocholate (TC) uptake in a dose-dependent manner in PHH, with both Na+-dependent and -independent bile acid uptake systems significantly inhibited. PM5-S-mediated inhibition of TC uptake could be reversed by increasing the TC concentration against a fixed PM5-S dose indicating competitive inhibition. Experiments using NTCP-expressing Xenopus oocytes confirmed that PM4-S/PM5-S are capable of competitively inhibiting NTCP-mediated uptake of [3H]TC. Total serum PM4-S + PM5-S levels were measured in non-pregnant and third trimester pregnant women using liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry and were increased in pregnant women, at levels capable of inhibiting TC uptake.

https://openalex.org/W2093635491,"Background Evidence from animal studies indicates the importance of an interaction between the sympathetic nervous system and the endothelium for cardiovascular regulation. However the interaction between these two systems remains largely unexplored in humans. The aim of this study was to investigate whether directly recorded sympathetic vasoconstrictor outflow is related to a surrogate marker of endothelial function in healthy individuals. Methods and Results In 10 healthy normotensive subjects (3 f/7 m), (age 37±11 yrs), (BMI 24±3 kg/m2) direct recordings of sympathetic action potentials to the muscle vascular bed (MSNA) were performed and endothelial function estimated with the Reactive Hyperaemia- Peripheral Arterial Tonometry (RH-PAT) technique. Blood samples were taken and time spent on leisure-time physical activities was estimated. In all subjects the rate between resting flow and the maximum flow, the Reactive Hyperemic index (RH-PAT index), was within the normal range (1,9–3,3) and MSNA was as expected for age and gender (13–44 burst/minute). RH-PAT index was inversely related to MSNA (r = −0.8, p = 0.005). RH-PAT index and MSNA were reciprocally related to time (h/week) spent on physical activity (p = 0.005 and p = 0.006 respectively) and platelet concentration (PLT) (p = 0.02 and p = 0.004 respectively). Conclusions Our results show that sympathetic nerve activity is related to a surrogate marker of endothelial function in healthy normotensive individuals, indicating that sympathetic outflow may be modulated by changes in endothelial function. In this study time spent on physical activity is identified as a predictor of sympathetic nerve activity and endothelial function in a group of healthy individuals. The results are of importance in understanding mechanisms underlying sympathetic activation in conditions associated with endothelial dysfunction and emphasise the importance of a daily exercise routine for maintenance of cardiovascular health."
https://openalex.org/W1963516132,"Successful predictions of peptide MHC binding typically require a large set of binding data for the specific MHC molecule that is examined. Structure based prediction methods promise to circumvent this requirement by evaluating the physical contacts a peptide can make with an MHC molecule based on the highly conserved 3D structure of peptide:MHC complexes. While several such methods have been described before, most are not publicly available and have not been independently tested for their performance. We here implemented and evaluated three prediction methods for MHC class II molecules: statistical potentials derived from the analysis of known protein structures; energetic evaluation of different peptide snapshots in a molecular dynamics simulation; and direct analysis of contacts made in known 3D structures of peptide:MHC complexes. These methods are ab initio in that they require structural data of the MHC molecule examined, but no specific peptide:MHC binding data. Moreover, these methods retain the ability to make predictions in a sufficiently short time scale to be useful in a real world application, such as screening a whole proteome for candidate binding peptides. A rigorous evaluation of each methods prediction performance showed that these are significantly better than random, but still substantially lower than the best performing sequence based class II prediction methods available. While the approaches presented here were developed independently, we have chosen to present our results together in order to support the notion that generating structure based predictions of peptide:MHC binding without using binding data is unlikely to give satisfactory results."
https://openalex.org/W2041421683,"Grp170 and Hsp110 proteins constitute two evolutionary distinct branches of the Hsp70 family that share the ability to function as nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs) for canonical Hsp70s. Although the NEF mechanism of the cytoplasmic Hsp110s is well understood, little is known regarding the mechanism used by Grp170s in the endoplasmic reticulum. In this study, we compare the yeast Grp170 Lhs1 with the yeast Hsp110 Sse1. We find that residues important for Sse1 NEF activity are conserved in Lhs1 and that mutations in these residues in Lhs1 compromise NEF activity. As previously reported for Sse1, Lhs1 requires ATP to trigger nucleotide exchange in its cognate Hsp70 partner Kar2. Using site-specific cross-linking, we show that the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) of Lhs1 interacts with the NBD of Kar2 face to face, and that Lhs1 contacts the side of the Kar2 NBD via its protruding C-terminal alpha-helical domain. To directly address the mechanism of nucleotide exchange, we have compared the hydrogen-exchange characteristics of a yeast Hsp70 NBD (Ssa1) in complex with either Sse1 or Lhs1. We find that Lhs1 and Sse1 induce very similar changes in the conformational dynamics in the Hsp70. Thus, our findings demonstrate that despite some differences between Hsp110 and Grp170 proteins, they use a similar mechanism to trigger nucleotide exchange."

https://openalex.org/W1975866986,"Background Avian paramyxoviruses (APMV) consist of nine known serotypes. The genomes of representatives of all APMV serotypes except APMV type 5 have recently been fully sequenced. Here, we report the complete genome sequence of the APMV-5 prototype strain budgerigar/Kunitachi/74. Methodology/Principal Findings APMV-5 Kunitachi virus is unusual in that it lacks a virion hemagglutinin and does not grow in the allantoic cavity of embryonated chicken eggs. However, the virus grew in the amniotic cavity of embryonated chicken eggs and in twelve different established cell lines and two primary cell cultures. The genome is 17,262 nucleotides (nt) long, which is the longest among members of genus Avulavirus, and encodes six non-overlapping genes in the order of 3′N-P/V/W-M-F-HN-L-5′ with intergenic regions of 4–57 nt. The genome length follows the ‘rule of six’ and contains a 55-nt leader sequence at the 3′end and a 552 nt trailer sequence at the 5′ end. The phosphoprotein (P) gene contains a conserved RNA editing site and is predicted to encode P, V, and W proteins. The cleavage site of the F protein (G-K-R-K-K-R↓F) conforms to the cleavage site motif of the ubiquitous cellular protease furin. Consistent with this, exogenous protease was not required for virus replication in vitro. However, the intracerebral pathogenicity index of APMV-5 strain Kunitachi in one-day-old chicks was found to be zero, indicating that the virus is avirulent for chickens despite the presence of a polybasic F cleavage site. Conclusions/Significance Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences of the APVM-5 genome and proteins versus those of the other APMV serotypes showed that APMV-5 is more closely related to APMV-6 than to the other APMVs. Furthermore, these comparisons provided evidence of extensive genome-wide divergence that supports the classification of the APMVs into nine separate serotypes. The structure of the F cleavage site does not appear to be a reliable indicator of virulence among APMV serotypes 2–9. The availability of sequence information for all known APMV serotypes will facilitate studies in epidemiology and vaccinology."

We show here that the targeting of different sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPases (SERCA) and RyR subtypes to discrete SR regions explains this paradox. Western blots identified protein bands for SERCA2a and SERCA2b, whereas immunofluorescence labeling of isolated pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells revealed striking differences in the spatial distribution of SERCA2a and SERCA2b and RyR1, RyR2, and RyR3, respectively. Almost all SERCA2a and RyR3 labeling was restricted to a region within 1.5 μm of the nucleus.

IntroductionPrevious studies on smooth muscle have provided evidence in support of the view that the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) 2The abbreviations used are: SRsarcoplasmic reticulumSERCAsarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase(s)RyRryanodine receptorBKCalarge conductance Ca2+-activated potassium channelRTreverse transcriptionDAPI4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindolePASMCpulmonary arterial smooth muscle cellET-1endothelin-1. may be functionally segregated (1Nazer M.A. van Breemen C. Cell Calcium. 1998; 24: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 2van Breemen C. Chen Q. Laher I. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 98-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Evidence suggests that such segregation may confer functionally segregated Ca2+ stores that may be mobilized differentially and in a stimulus-specific manner. Briefly, it has been shown that: 1) preincubation of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle with ryanodine, both with and without caffeine, may block Ca2+ signals via ryanodine receptor (RyR) activation without affecting Ca2+signals generated in response to IP3 (3Iino M. Kobayashi T. Endo M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 152: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 4Janiak R. Wilson S.M. Montague S. Hume J.R. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 280: C22-C33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); 2) both caffeine-sensitive and caffeine-insensitive SR stores exist in cultured mesenteric arterial smooth muscle and airway smooth muscle cells, with only the latter sensitive to depletion by the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) antagonist cyclopiazonic acid (5Golovina V.A. Blaustein M.P. Science. 1997; 275: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 6Tribe R.M. Borin M.L. Blaustein M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 5908-5912Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 7Ethier M.F. Yamaguchi H. Madison J.M. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol Physiol. 2001; 281: L126-L133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); and 3) activation of β-adrenoceptors on airway smooth muscle cells may increase the Ca2+ concentration in the subplasmalemmal region while decreasing the Ca2+ concentration in the central cytoplasmic region (8Yamaguchi H. Kajita J. Madison J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C771-C779Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Our investigations on pulmonary arterial smooth muscle have provided further support for the view that functionally segregated SR stores may exist. We demonstrated that β-adrenoreceptor activation mobilizes Ca2+, via RyRs, from a cyclopiazonic acid-sensitive SR store proximal to the plasma membrane and thereby recruits large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (BKCa) channels, leading to smooth muscle cell hyperpolarization and pulmonary artery dilation (9Boittin F.X. Dipp M. Kinnear N.P. Galione A. Evans A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9602-9608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In itself this may not seem surprising, except for the fact that in these studies cyclopiazonic acid was without effect on artery constriction by prostaglandin F2α, which induces constriction in part by mobilizing ryanodine-sensitive SR stores (10Dipp M. Nye P.C. Evans A.M. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2001; 281: L318-L325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Dipp M. Evans A.M. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Therefore, both preconstriction and subsequent vasodilation in response to β-adrenoreceptor activation were, at least in part, mediated by Ca2+ release from what is considered to be a continuous (i.e. the same) SR store (12McCarron J.G. Olson M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7206-7218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This paradox and the findings of others (see above) could be explained by the presence of two functionally and spatially segregated SR compartments, each equipped with a specific SERCA-type Ca2+ pump and a specific RyR-type Ca2+ release channel (for review see Ref. 13Evans A.M. Wyatt C.N. Kinnear N.P. Clark J.H. Blanco E.A. Pharmacol. Ther. 2005; 107: 286-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This is quite possible given that all three RyR subtypes (14Fleischer S.

We therefore sought to determine whether or not multiple SERCA isoforms were expressed in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells and, if so, whether or not different SERCA and RyR subtypes were differentially distributed in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells in a manner consistent with the presence of two functionally segregated SR compartments.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAll of the experiments were performed under the United Kingdom Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act of 1986. Adult male Wistar rats (150–300 g) were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Skeletal muscle, brain, heart, and lungs were removed and placed on ice in physiological salt solution of the following composition: 130 mmol/liter NaCl, 5.2 mmol/liter KCl, 1 mmol/liter MgCl2, 1.7 mmol/liter CaCl2, 10 mmol/liter glucose, and 10 mmol/liter Hepes, pH 7.45.RT-PCRTotal RNA was extracted from second and third order branches of the pulmonary arterial tree, heart, brain, and skeletal muscle using TRIzol® reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription was carried out using 6 μg of RNA and 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus (Promega), and PCR was performed on 1 μl of cDNA with 1 unit/μl Taq DNA polymerase (Biogene) as previously described (31Mahmmoud Y.A.

The primers used for each receptor are shown in Table 1. All of the primer sequences were checked against the GenBankTM, and no cross-reactivity was found. The RT-PCR products over 40 cycles of amplification were resolved by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels and visualized under UV illumination using an image capture system (Genesnap image analysis system; Syngene).TABLE 1Primers for RT-PCR experiments GenBankTM accession numbers NM_058213 (SERCA1), J04023 (SERCA2a), J04022 (SERCA2b), and J05086 (SERCA3)GenePrimerSequenceNucleotide positionsPredicted product sizebpSERCA1SenseCTC ACT TCC AGT CAT CGG GCT AG3084–3106340AntisenseGTC AGC TAG TTG CCT TGT CCC TG3423–3401SERCA2aSenseCCT GTC CAG TTA CTC TGG GTC2569–2589694AntisenseGCT AAC AAC GCA CAT GCA CGC3262–3242SERCA2bSenseGCC AAC ATT GCC TAT TCA GTG GCA C4382–4406501AntisenseGGA TGT TGG AAG GCA TTG GAG G4882–4861SERCA3SenseCTC WGA GAA CCA GTC ACT GCT GCaW indicates A or T.2879–2901264AntisenseGCT CYC AGG ATT TAC TTC AGG TCCbY indicates C or T.3142–3119a W indicates A or T.b Y indicates C or T. Open table in a new tab Western BlottingSecond order branches of the pulmonary arterial tree, heart, brain, and skeletal muscle were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Small segments of tissue were ground to a powder under liquid nitrogen and homogenized in an appropriate volume of ice-cold buffer (50 mmol/liter Tris, 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 50 mmol/liter NaF, 5 mmol/liter sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmol/liter EDTA, 1 mmol/liter EGTA, 1 mmol/liter dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmol/liter benzamidine, 0.1 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mmol/liter mannitol, 0.1% (v/v) Triton, pH 7.4) using a motor-driven pestle. The homogenate was kept on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged (7500 rpm, 5 min, 4 °C). The supernatants were removed, and their protein concentrations were determined.Equal amounts of homogenates (free of nuclear and whole cell debris) were separated on 10% bisacrylamide gels (NuPAGETM electrophoresis system; Invitrogen) and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were probed with sequence-specific antibodies for SERCA1 (1:2500, mouse monoclonal, raised against residues 199–505 of rabbit SERCA1; Abcam), SERCA2a (1:10000, rabbit polyclonal, raised against residues 989–997 of pig SERCA2a; F.

Verbist J. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 649-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar)), and SERCA3 (1:500, rabbit polyclonal, raised against residues 29–39 of mouse SERCA3; Abcam). Every blot was also probed with a polyclonal antibody for actin to ensure equal protein loading (Sigma) alongside the SERCA antibodies. Detection was performed with horseradish peroxide-conjugated secondary antibodies using the ECL system (GE Healthcare).Smooth Muscle Cell IsolationSingle arterial smooth muscle cells were isolated from second order branches of the pulmonary artery. Briefly, the arteries were dissected out and placed in low Ca2+ solution of the following composition: 124 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm NaH2PO4, 0.5 mm KH2PO, 15 mm NaHCO3, 0.16 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm taurine, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. After 10 min the arteries were placed in the same solution containing 0.5 mg/ml papain and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and kept at 4 °C overnight. The following day 0.2 mmol/liter 1,4-dithio-dl-threitol was added to the solution to activate the protease, and the preparation was incubated for 1 h at room temperature (22 °C). The tissue was then washed three times in fresh low Ca2+ solution without enzymes, and single smooth muscle cells were isolated by gentle trituration with a fire-polished Pasteur pipette. The cells were stored in suspension at 4 °C until required.ImmunocytochemistryThe cells were placed onto poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips, fixed using ice-cold methanol for 15 min, permeabilized by three 5-min washes with 0.6% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) followed by three 5-min washes with blocking solution (1% bovine serum albumin, 4% goat serum, and 0.3% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4). The cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the sequence-specific antibodies for SERCA2a (1:500) and SERCA2b (1:500). In addition, paired samples of cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with affinity-purified rabbit anti-RyR1 (1:500; raised against the peptide residues 4476–4486 (33Jeyakumar L.H. Gleaves L.A.

Grassucci R. Wagenknecht T. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16011-16020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar)). The coverslips were washed four times with blocking solution and incubated with goat anti-rabbit Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibody (1:200; excitation, 596 nm; emission, 620 nm). Then the coverslips were washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline and attached to slides by anti-fade mountant (2.4 g of Mowiol 4–88, 6 g of glycerol, 2 ml of 0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 2.5% 1,4-diazabicyclo(2.2.2.)octane) with 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 1 μg/ml; excitation, 358 nm; emission, 461 nm). For controls, the primary antibody was omitted. The images were acquired using a Deltavision imaging system (Applied Precision) consisting of an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope with an Olympus PlanApo 60×, 1.40 n.a. oil immersion objective and a Photometric CH300 charge-coupled device camera. Z section (0.2 μm) stacks were taken through cells. The images were deconvolved using Softworx acquisition and analysis software (Applied Precision) as described previously (18Kinnear N.P. Wyatt C.N. Clark J.H. Calcraft P.J. Fleischer S. Jeyakumar L.H. Nixon G.F. Evans A.M. Cell Calcium. 2008; 44: 190-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).Analysis of Fluorescent LabelingThree-dimensionally rendered images of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells were obtained using Volocity software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and subdivided into three defined volumes that excluded the DAPI-labeled nucleus, namely the perinuclear (the area of the cell located within 1.5 μm of the DAPI-labeled nucleus), the subplasmalemmal (the area of the cell located within 1.5 μm of the plasma membrane), and the extraperinuclear regions (the remaining volume of the cell). The volumes occupied by these three defined regions were measured, and then the density of fluorescent labeling in that region was determined by dividing the volume of protein labeling (e.g. for SERCA2a) within a given region by the volume of that region as described in detail previously (18Kinnear N.P. Wyatt C.N. Clark J.H. Calcraft P.J. Fleischer S. Jeyakumar L.H. Nixon G.F. Evans A.M. Cell Calcium. 2008; 44: 190-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Thus, data are presented as the means ± S.E. of the volume of labeling per μm3 of a given region (μm3/μm3).Ca2+ ImagingPulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) were incubated for 30 min with 5 μm Fura-2-AM in Ca2+-free physiological salt solution in an experimental chamber on a Leica DMIRBE inverted microscope and then superfused with Fura-2-free physiological salt solution for at least 30 min prior to experimentation. Cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration was reported by Fura-2 fluorescence ratio (F340/F380 excitation; emission, 510 nm). Emitted fluorescence was recorded at 22 °C with a sampling frequency of 0.5 Hz using a Hamamatsu 4880 CCD camera via a Zeiss Fluar 40×, 1.3 n.a. oil immersion lens, and Leica DMIRBE microscope. Background subtraction was performed on-line. Analysis was via Openlab imaging software (Improvision).Data Presentation and Statistical AnalysisThe data are presented as the means ± S.E. Comparisons between the groups were carried out in MINITAB 14 using analysis of variance followed by a Tukey post-hoc test. Probability values less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.Drugs and ChemicalsAll of the compounds were from Sigma-Aldrich except horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories) and fluorescently tagged secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch).DISCUSSIONIn agreement with previous studies on vascular smooth muscle (32Eggermont J.A. Wuytack F. Verbist J. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 649-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), our findings suggest that SERCA2a and SERCA2b are functionally expressed in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle. Strikingly, the vast majority of SERCA2b labeling (∼72%) lay within the subplasmalemmal region (within 1.5 μm of the plasma membrane). In marked contrast, SERCA2a labeling was almost entirely (∼90%) restricted to the perinuclear region of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (within 1.5 μm of the perimeter of the nucleus). Consistent with the distribution of SERCA2a, RyR3 was almost entirely restricted to the perinuclear region (∼70%). By contrast, RyR1 labeling was maximal in the subplasmalemmal region. These findings suggest that SERCA2a and RyR3 comprise a functionally segregated region of the SR proximal to the nucleus, whereas SERCA2b and RyR1 comprise a second, functionally segregated SR compartment proximal to the plasma membrane. Between these two regions, i.e. within the extraperinuclear volume, labeling for RyR2 was predominant, but with no clearly designated SERCA. The SR within this region may therefore receive Ca2+ from SERCA2a and/or SERCA2b because of the continuous nature of the SR Ca2+ store (12McCarron J.G. Olson M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7206-7218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This would be consistent with the view that RyR2 serves to carry, by Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release, a propagating Ca2+ wave away from lysosome-SR junctions that sit within the perinuclear region, which cannot be achieved by RyR3 because it is restricted to the perinuclear region of the cell (18Kinnear N.P.

Cell Calcium. 2008; 44: 190-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).That there may be discrete SR compartments is supported by previous studies on arterial smooth muscle, the pulmonary vasculature included, and airway smooth muscle (4Janiak R.

In this respect, for each type of smooth muscle studied, the one key piece of evidence was that the SERCA pump antagonist cyclopiazonic acid exhibits the capacity to selectively deplete one of at least two functionally segregated SR compartments. Consistent with this view, we have previously shown that cyclopiazonic acid inhibits vasodilation of pulmonary arteries in response to β-adrenoreceptor activation by isoprenaline, which is mediated, in part, by Ca2+ release proximal to the plasma membrane via RyRs, consequent recruitment of plasmalemmal BKCa channels, smooth muscle cell hyperpolarization, and ultimately pulmonary artery dilation (9Boittin F.X.

Chem. 2003; 278: 9602-9608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), we showed here that global Ca2+ signals induced by ET-1, which are also carried by RyRs in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells, remained unaffected following preincubation with cyclopiazonic acid, but were abolished by preincubation of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells with thapsigargin, even though both drugs are SERCA antagonists. Thus, it seems likely that a cyclopiazonic acid-sensitive SERCA pump (SERCA2b) serves the SR compartment proximal to the plasma membrane, from which Ca2+ release via RyRs recruits plasmalemmal BKCa channels to elicit smooth muscle cell hyperpolarization and pulmonary artery dilation (9Boittin F.X. Dipp M. Kinnear N.P. Galione A. Evans A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9602-9608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), whereas a SERCA pump that is relatively insensitive to cyclopiazonic acid (SERCA2a) serves a discrete SR compartment that underpins pulmonary artery constriction. Therefore, it is surprising to note that cell-free assays on recombinant SERCA2a and SERCA2b have shown that both cyclopiazonic acid and thapsigargin are effective inhibitors of both isoforms (39Campbell A.M.

J. 1992; 286: 591-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Thus, the preferential depletion of the peripheral SR store by cyclopiazonic acid is most likely due to its pharmacokinetics providing for “selective access” to SERCA2b over SERCA2a in a manner that may be determined by the local cytoplasmic environment (e.g. pH and ATP concentration) (41Inesi G.

Trieber C.A. Young H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9748-9757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, in recombinant systems, it has been shown that SERCA2b can be selectively inhibited by monovalent cations such as Cs+ (45Kargacin G.J. Aschar-Sobbi R. Kargacin M.E. Pflugers Arch. 2005; 449: 356-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cyclopiazonic acid and thapsigargin occupy different nonoverlapping binding sites in the ATPase (43Jensen A.M. Sørensen T.L. Olesen C. Møller J.V. Nissen P. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2305-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and site-directed mutagenesis of SERCA can selectively reduce the affinity of cyclopiazonic acid relative to thapsigargin (46Ma H. Zhong L. Inesi G. Fortea I. Soler F. Fernandez-Belda F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15522-15527Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus, we cannot rule out the possibility that post-translational modifications could confer a pharmacology distinct from that exhibited by recombinant SERCA.Given our findings, it may be important to note that SERCA2a and SERCA2b exhibit distinct kinetics. SERCA2b, which our data suggest serves a peripheral SR store that underpins Ca2+-dependent vasodilation, has a higher affinity for Ca2+ but a lower Vmax than SERCA2a (47Odermatt A. Kurzydlowski K. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14206-14213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 48Dode L. Andersen J.P. Leslie N. Dhitavat J. Vilsen B. Hovnanian A. J. Biol.

SERCA2b may therefore be dominant at rest and function to maintain resting levels of Ca2+ in the vicinity of the contractile apparatus. However, its low Vmax may lead to saturation of this SERCA with Ca2+ upon release of Ca2+ from the central SR compartment in response to stimuli that elicit vasoconstriction. Thereby, SERCA2b would allow the Ca2+ concentration to rise in the vicinity of the contractile apparatus, until such time as vasodilation is promoted by adenylyl cyclase-coupled receptors that may: 1) increase the activity of SERCA2b by phosphorylation via cAMP-dependent protein kinase (50Lindemann J.P.

https://openalex.org/W2042513407,"Electrophilic xenobiotics and endogenous products from oxidative stresses induce the glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), which form a large family within the phase II enzymes over both animal and plant kingdoms. The GSTs thus induced in turn detoxify these external as well as internal stresses. Because these stresses are often linked to ageing and damage to health, the induction of phase II enzymes without causing adverse effects would be beneficial in slowing down ageing and keeping healthy conditions.We have tested this hypothesis by choosing allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), a functional ingredient in wasabi, as a candidate food ingredient that induces GSTs without causing adverse effects on animals' lives. To monitor the GST induction, we constructed a gst::gfp fusion gene and used it to transform Caenorhabditis elegans for use as a nematode biosensor. With the nematode biosensor, we found that AITC induced GST expression and conferred tolerance on the nematode against various oxidative stresses. We also present evidence that the transcription factor SKN-1 is involved in regulating the GST expression induced by AITC.We show the applicability of the nematode biosensor for discovering and evaluating functional food substances and chemicals that would provide anti-ageing or healthful benefits."
https://openalex.org/W2015294909,"Background The majority of antiretroviral treatment programmes in sub-Saharan Africa are scaling up antiretroviral treatment using a fixed dose first-line antiretroviral regimen containing stavudine, lamivudine, and nevirapine. One of the primary concerns with the use of this regimen is nevirapine-associated hepatotoxicity. Methodology/Principal Findings Study participants were 1809 HIV-infected, antiretroviral naïve adults initiating nevirapine-based antiretroviral therapy between November 2002 and December 2006. The primary outcome was early hepatotoxicity. Secondary outcomes were associations with hepatotoxicity and mortality at six months. The cumulative proportion of early hepatotoxicity ranged from 1.0–2.0% giving an incidence-rate at 102 days of 3.6–7.6 per 100 person-years. Median time to hepatotoxicity was 32 (IQR 28–58) days. At 12 weeks, only 8% of patients had alanine aminotransferase monitoring at all the time-points recommended by national guidelines. No association was found between age, gender, baseline CD4 count, concurrent tuberculosis infection, prior participation in a prevention of mother-to-child-transmission program, or baseline weight and early hepatotoxicity. There was no association between early hepatotoxicity and mortality. Conclusions The cumulative proportion of early hepatotoxicity in nevirapine based antiretroviral therapy was low in this resource-constrained setting. Hepatotoxicity was not associated with mortality. Frequent routine monitoring of alanine aminotransferase proved difficult to implement in this public sector primary care programme. Focused monitoring in the first month may be a more cost-effective and pragmatic option in settings with limited resources. Correlation with clinical signs and symptoms may allow future alanine aminotransferase testing to be dictated by clinical criteria."
https://openalex.org/W2091354846,"In metazoan oocytes the assembly of a microtubule-based spindle depends on the activity of a large number of accessory non-tubulin proteins, many of which remain unknown. In this work we isolated the microtubule-bound proteins from Xenopus eggs. Using mass spectrometry we identified 318 proteins, only 43 of which are known to bind microtubules. To integrate our results, we compiled for the first time a network of the meiotic microtubule-related interactome. The map reveals numerous interactions between spindle microtubules and the newly identified non-tubulin spindle components and highlights proteins absent from the mitotic spindle proteome. To validate newly identified spindle components, we expressed as GFP-fusions nine proteins identified by us and for first time demonstrated that Mgc68500, Loc398535, Nif3l1bp1/THOC7, LSM14A/RAP55A, TSGA14/CEP41, Mgc80361 and Mgc81475 are associated with spindles in egg extracts or in somatic cells. Furthermore, we showed that transfection of HeLa cells with siRNAs, corresponding to the human orthologue of Mgc81475 dramatically perturbs spindle formation in HeLa cells. These results show that our approach to the identification of the Xenopus microtubule-associated proteome yielded bona fide factors with a role in spindle assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2170830827,"Mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1 remains a significant problem in the resource-constrained settings where anti-retroviral therapy is still not widely available. Understanding the earliest events during HIV-1 transmission and characterizing the newly transmitted or founder virus is central to intervention efforts. In this study, we analyzed the viral env quasispecies of six mother-infant transmission pairs (MIPs) and characterized the genetic features of envelope glycoprotein that could influence HIV-1 subtype C perinatal transmission.The V1-V5 region of env was amplified from 6 MIPs baseline samples and 334 DNA sequences in total were analyzed. A comparison of the viral population derived from the mother and infant revealed a severe genetic bottleneck occurring during perinatal transmission, which was characterized by low sequence diversity in the infant. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that most likely in all our infant subjects a single founder virus was responsible for establishing infection. Furthermore, the newly transmitted viruses from the infant had significantly fewer potential N-linked glycosylation sites in Env V1-V5 region and showed a propensity to encode shorter variable loops compared to the nontransmitted viruses. In addition, a similar intensity of selection was seen between mothers and infants with a higher rate of synonymous (dS) compared to nonsynonymous (dN) substitutions evident (dN/dS<1).Our results indicate that a strong genetic bottleneck occurs during perinatal transmission of HIV-1 subtype C. This is evident through population diversity and phylogenetic patterns where a single viral variant appears to be responsible for infection in the infants. As a result the newly transmitted viruses are less diverse and harbored significantly less glycosylated envelope. This suggests that viruses with the restricted glycosylation in envelope glycoprotein appeared to be preferentially transmitted during HIV-1 subtype C perinatal transmission. In addition, our findings also indicated that purifying selection appears to predominate in shaping the early intrahost evolution of HIV-1 subtype C envelope sequences."

Here, we provide evidence that PARP-1-independent AIF release and cell death are induced by a trienoic fatty acid, α-eleostearic acid (α-ESA). α-ESA induced the caspase-independent and AIF-initiated apoptotic death of neuronal cell lines, independently of PARP-1 activation. The cell death was inhibited by the MEK inhibitor U0126 and by knockdown of MEK using small interfering RNA. However, inhibitors for JNK, p38 inhibitors, calpain, phospholipase A2, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, did not block cell death. AIF was translocated to the nucleus after the induction of apoptosis by α-ESA in differentiated PC12 cells without activating caspase-3 and PARP-1.

Recently, engineered heart tissue (EHT) has been demonstrated to be a useful tool in experimental transplantation. Here, we demonstrate a novel function for the spontaneously contracting EHT as an experimental model in studying the acute ischemia-induced changes in vitro.EHT was constructed by mixing cardiomyocytes isolated from the neonatal rats and cultured in a ring-shaped scaffold for five days. This was followed by mechanical stretching of the EHT for another one week under incubation. Fully developed EHT was subjected to hypoxia with 1% O(2) for 6 hours after treating them with cell protective agents such as cyclosporine A (CsA) and acetylcholine (ACh). During culture, EHT started to show spontaneous contractions that became more synchronous following mechanical stretching. This was confirmed by the increased expression of gap junctional protein connexin 43 and improved action potential recordings using an optical mapping system after mechanical stretching. When subjected to hypoxia, EHT demonstrated conduction defects, dephosphorylation of connexin-43, and down-regulation of cell survival proteins identical to the adult heart. These effects were inhibited by treating the EHT with cell protective agents.Under hypoxic conditions, the EHT responds similarly to the adult myocardium, thus making EHT a promising material for the study of cardiac functions in vitro."

Understanding cellular proteins involved in the multistep process of HIV-1 infection may result in the discovery of more adapted and effective therapeutic targets. Kinases and phosphatases are a druggable class of proteins critically involved in regulation of signal pathways of eukaryotic cells. Here, we focused on the discovery of kinases and phosphatases that are essential for HIV-1 replication but dispensable for cell viability. We performed an iterative screen in Jurkat T-cells with a short-hairpin-RNA (shRNA) library highly enriched for human kinases and phosphatases. We identified 14 new proteins essential for HIV-1 replication that do not affect cell viability. These proteins are described to be involved in MAPK, JNK and ERK pathways, vesicular traffic and DNA repair. Moreover, we show that the proteins under study are important in an early step of HIV-1 infection before viral integration, whereas some of them affect viral transcription/translation. This study brings new insights for the complex interplay of HIV-1/host cell and opens new possibilities for antiviral strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2086729134,"Surveillance for HIV transmitted drug resistance (TDR) is performed using HIV genotype results from individual specimens. Pyrosequencing, through its massive parallel sequencing ability, can analyze large numbers of specimens simultaneously. Instead of using pyrosequencing conventionally, to sequence a population of viruses within an individual, we interrogated a single combined pool of surveillance specimens to demonstrate that it is possible to determine TDR rates in HIV protease from a population of individuals.The protease region from 96 treatment naïve, HIV+ serum specimens was genotyped using standard Sanger sequencing method. The 462 bp protease amplicons from these specimens were pooled in equimolar concentrations and re-sequenced using the GS FLX Titanium system. The nucleotide (NT) and amino acid (AA) differences from the reference sequence, along with TDR mutations, detected by each method were compared. In the protease sequence, there were 212 nucleotide and 81 AA differences found using conventional sequencing and 345 nucleotide and 168 AA differences using pyrosequencing. All nucleotide and amino acid polymorphisms found at frequencies >/=5% in pyrosequencing were detected using both methods with the rates of variation highly correlated. Using Sanger sequencing, two TDR mutations, M46L and I84V, were each detected as mixtures at a frequency of 1.04% (1/96). These same TDR mutations were detected by pyrosequencing with a prevalence of 0.29% and 0.34% respectively. Phylogenetic analysis established that the detected low frequency mutations arose from the same single specimens that were found to contain TDR mutations by Sanger sequencing. Multiple clinical protease DR mutations present at higher frequencies were concordantly identified using both methods.We show that pyrosequencing pooled surveillance specimens can cost-competitively detect protease TDR mutations when compared with conventional methods. With few modifications, the method described here can be used to determine population rates of TDR in both protease and reverse transcriptase. Furthermore, this pooled pyrosequencing technique may be generalizable to other infectious agents where a survey of DR rates is required."

In the present study we tested if smelling of Androstenol, a steroid produced by the human body and reported to affect human behavior, may elicit cerebral activation. A further issue was to evaluate whether the pattern of activation resembles the pattern of common odors. Methodology PET measurements of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were conducted in 16 healthy heterosexual women during passive smelling of Androstenol, four ordinary odors (OO), and odorless air (the base line condition). Principal findings Smelling Androstenol caused activation of a portion of the hypothalamus, which according to animal data mediates the pheromone triggered mating behavior. Smelling of OO, on the other hand, engaged only the classical olfactory regions (the piriform cortex, lateral amygdala, anterior insular and anterior cingulate cortex). Conclusions The observed pattern of activation is very similar to the pattern previously detected with 4,16-androstadien-3-one in heterosexual females. It suggests that several compounds released by human body may activate cerebral networks involved in human reproduction."

Deficiency of SSADH in humans results in elevated levels of GABA and γ-Hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), which leads to psychomotor retardation, muscular hypotonia, non-progressive ataxia and seizures. In Escherichia coli, two genetically distinct forms of SSADHs had been described that are essential for preventing accumulation of toxic levels of succinic semialdehyde (SSA) in cells. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we structurally characterise SSADH encoded by the E coli gabD gene by X-ray crystallographic studies and compare these data with the structure of human SSADH. In the E. coli SSADH structure, electron density for the complete NADP+ cofactor in the binding sites is clearly evident; these data in particular revealing how the nicotinamide ring of the cofactor is positioned in each active site. Conclusions/Significance Our structural data suggest that a deletion of three amino acids in E. coli SSADH permits this enzyme to use NADP+, whereas in contrast the human enzyme utilises NAD+. Furthermore, the structure of E. coli SSADH gives additional insight into human mutations that result in disease."
https://openalex.org/W2002151735,"There is a large sex difference in the prevalence of attention deficit disorder; yet, relatively little is known about sex differences in the development of prefrontal attention circuitry. In male rats, nicotinic acetylcholine receptors excite corticothalamic neurons in layer VI, which are thought to play an important role in attention by gating the sensitivity of thalamic neurons to incoming stimuli. These nicotinic currents in male rats are significantly larger during the first postnatal month when prefrontal circuitry is maturing. The present study was undertaken to investigate whether there are sex differences in the nicotinic currents in prefrontal layer VI neurons during development.Using whole cell recording in prefrontal brain slice, we examined the inward currents elicited by nicotinic stimulation in male and female rats and two strains of mice. We found a prominent sex difference in the currents during the first postnatal month when males had significantly greater nicotinic currents in layer VI neurons compared to females. These differences were apparent with three agonists: acetylcholine, carbachol, and nicotine. Furthermore, the developmental sex difference in nicotinic currents occurred despite male and female rodents displaying a similar pattern and proportion of layer VI neurons possessing a key nicotinic receptor subunit.This is the first illustration at a cellular level that prefrontal attention circuitry is differently affected by nicotinic receptor stimulation in males and females during development. This transient sex difference may help to define the cellular and circuit mechanisms that underlie vulnerability to attention deficit disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2060831044,"Background Within months of the emergence of the novel A/H1N1 pandemic influenza virus (nA/H1N1v), systematic screening for the surveillance of the pandemic was abandoned in France and in some other countries. At the end of June 2009, we implemented, for the public hospitals of Marseille, a Point Of Care (POC) strategy for rapid diagnosis of the novel A/H1N1 influenza virus, in order to maintain local surveillance and to evaluate locally the kinetics of the pandemic. Methodology/Principal Findings Two POC laboratories, located in strategic places, were organized to receive and test samples 24 h/24. POC strategy consisted of receiving and processing naso-pharyngeal specimens in preparation for the rapid influenza diagnostic test (RIDT) and real-time RT-PCR assay (rtRT-PCR). This strategy had the theoretical capacity of processing up to 36 samples per 24 h. When the flow of samples was too high, the rtRT-PCR test was abandoned in the POC laboratories and transferred to the core virology laboratory. Confirmatory diagnosis was performed in the core virology laboratory twice a day using two distinct rtRT-PCR techniques that detect either influenza A virus or nA/N1N1v. Over a period of three months, 1974 samples were received in the POC laboratories, of which 111 were positive for nA/H1N1v. Specificity and sensitivity of RIDT were 100%, and 57.7% respectively. Positive results obtained using RIDT were transmitted to clinical practitioners in less than 2 hours. POC processed rtRT-PCR results were available within 7 hours, and rtRT-PCR confirmation within 24 hours. Conclusions/Significance The POC strategy is of benefit, in all cases (with or without rtRT-PCR assay), because it provides continuous reception/processing of samples and reduction of the time to provide consolidated results to the clinical practitioners. We believe that implementation of the POC strategy for the largest number of suspect cases may improve the quality of patient care and our knowledge of the epidemiology of the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W2088662624,"Background In HIV infection, uncontrolled immune activation and disease progression is attributed to declining CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T-cell (Treg) numbers. However, qualitative aspects of Treg function in HIV infection, specifically the balance between Treg cell suppressive potency versus suppressibility of effector cells, remain poorly understood. This report addresses this issue. Methodology/Principal Findings A classic suppression assay to measure CD4+CD45RO+CD25hi Treg cells to suppress the proliferation of CD4+CD45RO+CD25− effectors cells (E) following CD3/CD28 polyclonal stimulation was employed to compare the suppressive ability of healthy volunteers (N = 27) and chronic, asymptomatic, treatment naïve, HIV-infected subjects (N = 14). HIV-infected subjects displayed significantly elevated Treg-mediated suppression compared to healthy volunteers (p = 0.0047). Cross-over studies comparing Treg cell potency from HIV-infected versus control subjects to suppress the proliferation of a given population of allogeneic effector cells demonstrated increased sensitivity of CD4+CD25− effector cells from HIV-infected subjects to be suppressed, associated with reduced production of the Treg counter-regulatory cytokine, IL-17, rather than an increase in the suppressive potential of their CD4+CD25+ Treg cells. However, compared to controls, HIV+ subjects had significantly fewer absolute numbers of circulating CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Treg cells. In vitro studies highlighted that one mechanism for this loss could be the preferential infection of Treg cells by HIV. Conclusions/Significance Together, novel data is provided to support the contention that elevated Treg-mediated suppression may be a natural host response to HIV infection"
https://openalex.org/W2146298955,"Myotonic dystrophy types 1 and 2 (DM1 and DM2) are forms of muscular dystrophy that share similar clinical and molecular manifestations, such as myotonia, muscle weakness, cardiac anomalies, cataracts, and the presence of defined RNA-containing foci in muscle nuclei. DM2 is caused by an expansion of the tetranucleotide CCTG repeat within the first intron of ZNF9, although the mechanism by which the expanded nucleotide repeat causes the debilitating symptoms of DM2 is unclear. Conflicting studies have led to two models for the mechanisms leading to the problems associated with DM2. First, a gain-of-function disease model hypothesizes that the repeat expansions in the transcribed RNA do not directly affect ZNF9 function. Instead repeat-containing RNAs are thought to sequester proteins in the nucleus, causing misregulation of normal cellular processes. In the alternative model, the repeat expansions impair ZNF9 function and lead to a decrease in the level of translation. Here we examine the normal in vivo function of ZNF9. We report that ZNF9 associates with actively translating ribosomes and functions as an activator of cap-independent translation of the human ODC mRNA. This activity is mediated by direct binding of ZNF9 to the internal ribosome entry site sequence (IRES) within the 5′UTR of ODC mRNA. ZNF9 can activate IRES-mediated translation of ODC within primary human myoblasts, and this activity is reduced in myoblasts derived from a DM2 patient. These data identify ZNF9 as a regulator of cap-independent translation and indicate that ZNF9 activity may contribute mechanistically to the myotonic dystrophy type 2 phenotype."

(ii) 600 sera received before April 2009 and randomly selected from in-patients were tested by a standard hemagglutination inhibition assay for antibody to the novel H1N1sw virus. (iii) One early (May 2009) and one late (July 2009) viral isolates were characterized by sequencing the complete hemagglutinine and neuraminidase genes. (iiii) Epidemiological characteristics of a cluster of cases that occurred in July 2009 in a summer camp were analyzed.This study presents new virological and epidemiological data regarding infection by the pandemic A/H1N1 virus in Europe. Distribution in age groups was found to be similar to that previously reported for seasonal H1N1. The first seroprevalence data made available for a European population suggest a previous exposure of individuals over 40 years old to influenza viruses antigenically related to the pandemic (H1N1)-2009 virus. Genomic analysis indicates that strains harbouring a new amino-acid pattern in the neuraminidase gene appeared secondarily and tended to supplant the first strains. Finally, in contrast with previous reports, our data support the use of RIDT for the detection of infection in children, especially in the context of the investigation of grouped cases."
https://openalex.org/W2036786455,"The absence of a suitable cellular model is a major obstacle for the study of peripheral neuropathies. Human embryonic stem cells hold the potential to be differentiated into peripheral neurons which makes them a suitable candidate for this purpose. However, so far the potential of hESC to differentiate into derivatives of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) was not investigated enough and in particular, the few trials conducted resulted in low yields of PNS neurons. Here we describe a novel hESC differentiation method to produce enriched populations of PNS mature neurons. By plating 8 weeks hESC derived neural progenitors (hESC-NPs) on laminin for two weeks in a defined medium, we demonstrate that over 70% of the resulting neurons express PNS markers and 30% of these cells are sensory neurons.Our method shows that the hNPs express neuronal crest lineage markers in a temporal manner, and by plating 8 weeks hESC-NPs into laminin coated dishes these hNPs were promoted to differentiate and give rise to homogeneous PNS neuronal populations, expressing several PNS lineage-specific markers. Importantly, these cultures produced functional neurons with electrophysiological activities typical of mature neurons. Moreover, supporting this physiological capacity implantation of 8 weeks old hESC-NPs into the neural tube of chick embryos also produced human neurons expressing specific PNS markers in vivo in just a few days. Having the enriched PNS differentiation system in hand, we show for the first time in human PNS neurons the expression of IKAP/hELP1 protein, where a splicing mutation on the gene encoding this protein causes the peripheral neuropathy Familial Dysautonomia.We conclude that this differentiation system to produce high numbers of human PNS neurons will be useful for studying PNS related neuropathies and for developing future drug screening applications for these diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2102224244,"Background Policymakers advocate universal electronic medical records (EMRs) and propose incentives for “meaningful use” of EMRs. Though emergency departments (EDs) are particularly sensitive to the benefits and unintended consequences of EMR adoption, surveillance has been limited. We analyze data from a nationally representative sample of US EDs to ascertain the adoption of various EMR functionalities. Methodology/Principal Findings We analyzed data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, after pooling data from 2005 and 2006, reporting proportions with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). In addition to reporting adoption of various EMR functionalities, we used logistic regression to ascertain patient and hospital characteristics predicting “meaningful use,” defined as a “basic” system (managing demographic information, computerized provider order entry, and lab and imaging results). We found that 46% (95% CI 39–53%) of US EDs reported having adopted EMRs. Computerized provider order entry was present in 21% (95% CI 16–27%), and only 15% (95% CI 10–20%) had warnings for drug interactions or contraindications. The “basic” definition of “meaningful use” was met by 17% (95% CI 13–21%) of EDs. Rural EDs were substantially less likely to have a “basic” EMR system than urban EDs (odds ratio 0.19, 95% CI 0.06–0.57, p = 0.003), and Midwestern (odds ratio 0.37, 95% CI 0.16–0.84, p = 0.018) and Southern (odds ratio 0.47, 95% CI 0.26–0.84, p = 0.011) EDs were substantially less likely than Northeastern EDs to have a “basic” system. Conclusions/Significance EMRs are becoming more prevalent in US EDs, though only a minority use EMRs in a “meaningful” way, no matter how “meaningful” is defined. Rural EDs are less likely to have an EMR than metropolitan EDs, and Midwestern and Southern EDs are less likely to have an EMR than Northeastern EDs. We discuss the nuances of how to define “meaningful use,” and the importance of considering not only adoption, but also full implementation and consequences."
https://openalex.org/W1980325007,"Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy offers a variety of experiments to study protein-ligand interactions at atomic resolution. Among these experiments, 15N Heteronuclear Single Quantum Correlation (HSQC)experiment is simple, less time consuming and highly informative in mapping the binding site of the ligand. The interpretation of 15N HSQC becomes ambiguous when the chemical shift perturbations are caused by non-specific interactions like allosteric changes and local structural rearrangement. Under such cases, detailed chemical exchange analysis based on chemical shift perturbation will assist in locating the binding site accurately.We have automated the mapping of binding sites for fast chemical exchange systems using information obtained from 15N HSQC spectra of protein serially titrated with ligand of increasing concentrations. The automated program Auto-FACE (Auto-FAst Chemical Exchange analyzer) determines the parameters, e.g. rate of change of perturbation, binding equilibrium constant and magnitude of chemical shift perturbation to map the binding site residues.Interestingly, the rate of change of perturbation at lower ligand concentration is highly sensitive in differentiating the binding site residues from the non-binding site residues. To validate this program, the interaction between the protein hBcl(XL) and the ligand BH3I-1 was studied. Residues in the hydrophobic BH3 binding groove of hBcl(XL) were easily identified to be crucial for interaction with BH3I-1 from other residues that also exhibited perturbation. The geometrically averaged equilibrium constant (3.0 x 10(4)) calculated for the residues present at the identified binding site is consistent with the values obtained by other techniques like isothermal calorimetry and fluorescence polarization assays (12.8 x 10(4)). Adjacent to the primary site, an additional binding site was identified which had an affinity of 3.8 times weaker than the former one. Further NMR based model fitting for individual residues suggest single site model for residues present at these binding sites and two site model for residues present between these sites. This implies that chemical shift perturbation can represent the local binding event much more accurately than the global binding event.Detail NMR chemical shift perturbation analysis enabled binding site residues to be distinguished from non-binding site residues for accurate mapping of interaction site in complex fast exchange system between small molecule and protein. The methodology is automated and implemented in a program called ""Auto-FACE"", which also allowed quantitative information of each interaction site and elucidation of binding mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2003215632,"Hypoxic states of the cardiovacular system are undoubtedly associated with the most frequent diseases of modern time. Therefore, understanding hypoxic resistance encountered after physiological adaptation such as chronic hypoxia, is crucial to better deal with hypoxic insult. In this study, we examine the role of energetic modifications induced by chronic hypoxia (CH) in the higher tolerance to oxygen deprivation.Swiss mice were exposed to a simulated altitude of 5500 m in a barochamber for 21 days. Isolated perfused hearts were used to study the effects of a decreased oxygen concentration in the perfusate on contractile performance (RPP) and phosphocreatine (PCr) concentration (assessed by (31)P-NMR), and to describe the integrated changes in cardiac energetics regulation by using Modular Control Analysis (MoCA). Oxygen reduction induced a concomitant decrease in RPP (-46%) and in [PCr] (-23%) in Control hearts while CH hearts energetics was unchanged. MoCA demonstrated that this adaptation to hypoxia is the direct consequence of the higher responsiveness (elasticity) of ATP production of CH hearts compared with Controls (-1.88+/-0.38 vs -0.89+/-0.41, p<0.01) measured under low oxygen perfusion. This higher elasticity induces an improved response of energy supply to cellular energy demand. The result is the conservation of a healthy control pattern of contraction in CH hearts, whereas Control hearts are severely controlled by energy supply.As suggested by the present study, the mechanisms responsible for this increase in elasticity and the consequent improved ability of CH heart metabolism to respond to oxygen deprivation could participate to limit the damages induced by hypoxia."
https://openalex.org/W2013052421,"Calcium signals are involved in a large variety of physiological processes. Their versatility relies on the diversity of spatio-temporal behaviors that the calcium concentration can display. Calcium entry through inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP) receptors (IPR's) is a key component that participates in both local signals such as “puffs” and in global waves. IPR's are usually organized in clusters on the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum and their spatial distribution has important effects on the resulting signal. Recent high resolution observations [1] of Ca puffs offer a window to study intra-cluster organization. The experiments give the distribution of the number of IPR's that open during each puff without much processing. Here we present a simple model with which we interpret the experimental distribution in terms of two stochastic processes: IP binding and unbinding and Ca-mediated inter-channel coupling. Depending on the parameters of the system, the distribution may be dominated by one or the other process. The transition between both extreme cases is similar to a percolation process. We show how, from an analysis of the experimental distribution, information can be obtained on the relative weight of the two processes. The largest distance over which Ca-mediated coupling acts and the density of IP-bound IPR's of the cluster can also be estimated. The approach allows us to infer properties of the interactions among the channels of the cluster from statistical information on their emergent collective behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2053098560,"Background Influenza A viral surface protein, hemagglutinin, is the major target of neutralizing antibody response and hence a main constituent of all vaccine formulations. But due to its marked evolutionary variability, vaccines have to be reformulated so as to include the hemagglutinin protein from the emerging new viral strain. With the constant fear of a pandemic, there is critical need for the development of anti-viral strategies that can provide wider protection against any Influenza A pathogen. An anti-viral approach that is directed against the conserved regions of the hemaggutinin protein has a potential to protect against any current and new Influenza A virus and provide a solution to this ever-present threat to public health. Methodology/Principal Findings Influenza A human hemagglutinin protein sequences available in the NCBI database, corresponding to H1, H2, H3 and H5 subtypes, were used to identify highly invariable regions of the protein. Nine such regions were identified and analyzed for structural properties like surface exposure, hydrophilicity and residue type to evaluate their suitability for targeting an anti-peptide antibody/anti-viral response. Conclusion/Significance This study has identified nine conserved regions in the hemagglutinin protein, five of which have the structural characteristics suitable for an anti-viral/anti-peptide response. This is a critical step in the design of efficient anti-peptide antibodies as novel anti-viral agents against any Influenza A pathogen. In addition, these anti-peptide antibodies will provide broadly cross-reactive immunological reagents and aid the rapid development of vaccines against new and emerging Influenza A strains."
https://openalex.org/W2055318948,"Background Tuberculosis is a mycobacterial infection causing worldwide public health problems but the available vaccine is far from ideal. Type-1 T cell immunity has been shown to be critical for host defence against tuberculosis infection, but the role of dendritic cell (DC) subsets in pathogenesis of mycobacterial infection remains unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings We examined the effectiveness of dendritic cell (DC) subsets in BCG-infected mice in generating immune responses beneficial for pathogen clearance and reduction of pathological reactions in the tissues following challenge infection. Our data showed that only the adoptive transfer of the subset of CD8α+ DC isolated from infected mice (iCD8+ DC) generated significant protection, demonstrated by less mycobacterial growth and pathological changes in the lung and liver tissues in iCD8+ DC recipients than sham-treated control mice. The adoptive transfer of the CD8α−DC from the infected mice (iCD8− DC) not only failed to reduce bacterial growth, but enhanced inflammation characterized by diffuse heavy cellular infiltration. Notably, iCD8− DC produced significantly higher levels of IL-10 than iCD8+ DC and promoted more Th2 cytokine responses in in vitro DC-T cell co-culture and in vivo adoptive transfer experiments. Conclusions/Significance The data indicate that in vivo BCG-primed CD8+ DC is the dominant DC subset in inducing protective immunity especially for reducing pathological reactions in infected tissues. The finding has implications for the rational improvement of the prophylactic and therapeutic approaches for controlling tuberculosis infection and related diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1999467178,"PDC109 is a modular multi-domain protein with two fibronectin type II (Fn2) repeats joined by a linker. It plays a major role in bull sperm binding to the oviductal epithelium through its interactions with phosphorylcholines (PhCs), a head group of sperm cell membrane lipids. The crystal structure of the PDC109-PhC complex shows that each PhC binds to the corresponding Fn2 domain, while the two domains are on the same face of the protein. Long timescale explicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of PDC109, in the presence and absence of PhC, suggest that PhC binding strongly correlates with the relative orientation of choline-phospholipid binding sites of the two Fn2 domains; unless the two domains tightly bind PhCs, they tend to change their relative orientation by deforming the flexible linker. The effective PDC109-PhC association constant of 28 M(-1), estimated from their potential of mean force is consistent with the experimental result. Principal component analysis of the long timescale MD simulations was compared to the significantly less expensive normal mode analysis of minimized structures. The comparison indicates that difference between relative domain motions of PDC109 with bound and unbound PhC is captured by the first principal component in the principal component analysis as well as the three lowest normal modes in the normal mode analysis. The present study illustrates the use of detailed MD simulations to clarify the energetics of specific ligand-domain interactions revealed by a static crystallographic model, as well as their influence on relative domain motions in a multi-domain protein."
https://openalex.org/W2001220949,"Previous studies have shown that the opinion of confederates in a group influences recognition memory, but inconsistent results have been obtained concerning the question of whether recognition of items as old and new are affected similarly, possibly because only one or two confederates are present during the recognition phase. Here, we present data from a study where recognition of novel faces was tested in the presence of four confederates. In a long version of this experiment, recognition of items as old and new was similarly affected by group responses. However, in the short version, recognition of old items depended proportionally on the number of correct group responses, while rejection of new items only decreased significantly when all confederates gave an incorrect response. These findings indicate that differential effects of social conformity on recognition of items as old and new occur in situations with an intermediate level of group pressure."
https://openalex.org/W2085672451,"Cryptochromes (CRYs) are flavoproteins sharing high homology with photolyases. Some of them have function(s) including transcription regulation in the circadian clock oscillation, blue-light photoreception for resetting the clock phase, and light-dependent magnetoreception. Vertebrates retain multiple sets of CRY or CRY-related genes, but their functions are yet unclear especially in the lower vertebrates. Although CRYs and the other circadian clock components have been extensively studied in the higher vertebrates such as mice, only a few model species have been studied in the lower vertebrates. In this study, we identified two CRYs, XtCRY1 and XtCRY2 in Xenopus tropicalis, an excellent experimental model species. Examination of tissue specificity of their mRNA expression by real-time PCR analysis revealed that both the XtCRYs showed extremely high mRNA expression levels in the ovary. The mRNA levels in the ovary were about 28-fold (XtCry1) and 48-fold (XtCry2) higher than levels in the next abundant tissues, the retina and kidney, respectively. For the functional analysis of the XtCRYs, we cloned circadian positive regulator XtCLOCK and XtBMAL1, and found circadian enhancer E-box in the upstream of XtPer1 gene. XtCLOCK and XtBMAL1 exhibited strong transactivation from the XtPer1 E-box element, and both the XtCRYs inhibited the XtCLOCK:XtBMAL1-mediated transactivation, thereby suggesting this element to drive the circadian transcription. These results revealed a conserved main feedback loop in the X. tropicalis circadian clockwork and imply a possible physiological importance of CRYs in the ovarian functions such as synthesis of steroid hormones and/or control of estrus cycles via the transcription regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1967009210,"Severe Combined Immune Deficient (SCID)/Urokinase-type Plasminogen Activator (uPA) mice undergo liver failure and are useful hosts for the propagation of transplanted human hepatocytes (HH) which must compete with recipient-derived hepatocytes for replacement of the diseased liver parenchyma. While partial replacement by HH has proven useful for studies with Hepatitis C virus, complete replacement of SCID/uPA mouse liver by HH has never been achieved and limits the broader application of these mice for other areas of biomedical research. The herpes simplex virus type-1 thymidine kinase (HSVtk)/ganciclovir (GCV) system is a powerful tool for cell-specific ablation in transgenic animals. The aim of this study was to selectively eliminate murine-derived parenchymal liver cells from humanized SCID/uPA mouse liver in order to achieve mice with completely humanized liver parenchyma. Thus, we reproduced the HSVtk (vTK)/GCV system of hepatic failure in SCID/uPA mice.In vitro experiments demonstrated efficient killing of vTK expressing hepatoma cells after GCV treatment. For in vivo experiments, expression of vTK was targeted to the livers of FVB/N and SCID/uPA mice. Hepatic sensitivity to GCV was first established in FVB/N mice since these mice do not undergo liver failure inherent to SCID/uPA mice. Hepatic vTK expression was found to be an integral component of GCV-induced pathologic and biochemical alterations and caused death due to liver dysfunction in vTK transgenic FVB/N and non-transplanted SCID/uPA mice. In SCID/uPA mice with humanized liver, vTK/GCV caused death despite extensive replacement of the mouse liver parenchyma with HH (ranging from 32-87%). Surprisingly, vTK/GCV-dependent apoptosis and mitochondrial aberrations were also localized to bystander vTK-negative HH.Extensive replacement of mouse liver parenchyma by HH does not provide a secure therapeutic advantage against vTK/GCV-induced cytotoxicity targeted to residual mouse hepatocytes. Functional support by engrafted HH may be secured by strategies aimed at limiting this bystander effect."
https://openalex.org/W2062104943,"Microarray-based expression profiling of living systems is a quick and inexpensive method to obtain insights into the nature of various diseases and phenotypes. A typical microarray profile can yield hundreds or even thousands of differentially expressed genes and finding biologically plausible themes or regulatory mechanisms underlying these changes is a non-trivial and daunting task. We describe a novel approach for systems-level interpretation of microarray expression data using a manually constructed “overview” pathway depicting the main cellular signaling channels (Atlas of Signaling). Currently, the developed pathway focuses on signal transduction from surface receptors to transcription factors and further transcriptional regulation of cellular “workhorse” proteins. We show how the constructed Atlas of Signaling in combination with an enrichment analysis algorithm allows quick identification and visualization of the main signaling cascades and cellular processes affected in a gene expression profiling experiment. We validate our approach using several publicly available gene expression datasets."
https://openalex.org/W2148423749,"Small G-proteins of the superfamily Ras function as molecular switches, interacting with different cellular partners according to their activation state. G-protein activation involves the dissociation of bound GDP and its replacement by GTP, in an exchange reaction that is accelerated and regulated in the cell by guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). Large conformational changes accompany the exchange reaction, and our understanding of the mechanism is correspondingly incomplete. However, much knowledge has been derived from structural studies of blocked or inactive mutant GEFs, which presumably closely represent intermediates in the exchange reaction and yet which are by design incompetent for carrying out the nucleotide exchange reaction. In this study we have used comparative modelling to recreate an exchange-competent form of a late, pre-GDP-ejection intermediate species in Arf1, a well-characterized small G-protein. We extensively characterized three distinct models of this intermediate using molecular dynamics simulations, allowing us to address ambiguities related to the mutant structural studies. We observed in particular the unfavorable nature of Mg associated forms of the complex and the establishment of closer Arf1-GEF contacts in its absence. The results of this study shed light on GEF-mediated activation of this small G protein and on predicting the fate of the Mg ion at a critical point in the exchange reaction. The structural models themselves furnish additional targets for interfacial inhibitor design, a promising direction for exploring potentially druggable targets with high biological specificity."
