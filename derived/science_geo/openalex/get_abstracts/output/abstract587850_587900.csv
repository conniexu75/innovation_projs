https://openalex.org/W2617594926,"Expansions of short nucleotide repeats produce several neurological and neuromuscular disorders including Huntington disease, muscular dystrophy, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. A common pathological feature of these diseases is the accumulation of the repeat-containing transcripts into aberrant foci in the nucleus. RNA foci, as well as the disease symptoms, only manifest above a critical number of nucleotide repeats, but the molecular mechanism governing foci formation above this characteristic threshold remains unresolved. Here we show that repeat expansions create templates for multivalent base-pairing, which causes purified RNA to undergo a sol-gel transition in vitro at a similar critical repeat number as observed in the diseases. In human cells, RNA foci form by phase separation of the repeat-containing RNA and can be dissolved by agents that disrupt RNA gelation in vitro. Analogous to protein aggregation disorders, our results suggest that the sequence-specific gelation of RNAs could be a contributing factor to neurological disease."

Three-dimensional cell culture models have either relied on the self-organizing properties of mammalian cells1,2,3,4,5,6 or used bioengineered constructs to arrange cells in an organ-like configuration7,8. While self-organizing organoids excel at recapitulating early developmental events, bioengineered constructs reproducibly generate desired tissue architectures. Here, we combine these two approaches to reproducibly generate human forebrain tissue while maintaining its self-organizing capacity. We use poly(lactide-co-glycolide) copolymer (PLGA) fiber microfilaments as a floating scaffold to generate elongated embryoid bodies. Microfilament-engineered cerebral organoids (enCORs) display enhanced neuroectoderm formation and improved cortical development. Furthermore, reconstitution of the basement membrane leads to characteristic cortical tissue architecture, including formation of a polarized cortical plate and radial units. Thus, enCORs model the distinctive radial organization of the cerebral cortex and allow for the study of neuronal migration. Our data demonstrate that combining 3D cell culture with bioengineering can increase reproducibility and improve tissue architecture."
https://openalex.org/W2619419337,"Metabolic production of acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) is linked to histone acetylation and gene regulation, but the precise mechanisms of this process are largely unknown. Here we show that the metabolic enzyme acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2) directly regulates histone acetylation in neurons and spatial memory in mammals. In a neuronal cell culture model, ACSS2 increases in the nuclei of differentiating neurons and localizes to upregulated neuronal genes near sites of elevated histone acetylation. A decrease in ACSS2 lowers nuclear acetyl-CoA levels, histone acetylation, and responsive expression of the cohort of neuronal genes. In adult mice, attenuation of hippocampal ACSS2 expression impairs long-term spatial memory, a cognitive process that relies on histone acetylation. A decrease in ACSS2 in the hippocampus also leads to defective upregulation of memory-related neuronal genes that are pre-bound by ACSS2. These results reveal a connection between cellular metabolism, gene regulation, and neural plasticity and establish a link between acetyl-CoA generation 'on-site' at chromatin for histone acetylation and the transcription of key neuronal genes."
https://openalex.org/W2620475836,"The structure of Cpf1, a CRISPR–Cas/RNA-guided nuclease, is presented with a three-stranded RNA–DNA loop after cleavage, providing insight into its working mechanism. The CRISPR–Cas9 system for genome editing has evolved to utilize variants of Cas9-type enzymes that possess different properties. One of these homologues is the Cpf1 enzyme, the therapeutic potential of which is starting to be explored. Guillermo Montoya and colleagues have solved the structure of Cpf1 endonuclease from Francisella novicida bound to an CRISPR RNA (crRNA)–DNA mimic of the post-cleavage complex. The new understanding of Cpf1 mechanism could be used to widen the repertoire of CRIPSR–Cas editing enzymes and their applications. Cpf1 is an RNA-guided endonuclease that is emerging as a powerful genome-editing tool1,2. Here we provide insight into its DNA-targeting mechanism by determining the structure of Francisella novicida Cpf1 with the triple-stranded R-loop generated after DNA cleavage. The structure reveals the machinery involved in DNA unwinding to form a CRISPR RNA (crRNA)–DNA hybrid and a displaced DNA strand. The protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) is recognized by the PAM-interacting domain. The loop-lysine helix–loop motif in this domain contains three conserved lysine residues that are inserted in a dentate manner into the double-stranded DNA. Unzipping of the double-stranded DNA occurs in a cleft arranged by acidic and hydrophobic residues facilitating the crRNA–DNA hybrid formation. The PAM single-stranded DNA is funnelled towards the nuclease site through a mixed hydrophobic and basic cavity. In this catalytic conformation, the PAM-interacting domain and the helix–loop–helix motif in the REC1 domain adopt a ‘rail’ shape and ‘flap-on’ conformations, respectively, channelling the PAM strand into the cavity. A steric barrier between the RuvC-II and REC1 domains forms the ‘septum’, separating the displaced PAM strand and the crRNA–DNA hybrid, avoiding DNA re-annealing. Mutations in key residues reveal a mechanism linking the PAM and DNA nuclease sites. Analysis of the Cpf1 structures3,4 proposes a singular working model of RNA-guided DNA cleavage, suggesting new avenues for redesign of Cpf1."
https://openalex.org/W2620271723,"Diarrhoeal disease is responsible for 8.6% of global child mortality. Recent epidemiological studies found the protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium to be a leading cause of paediatric diarrhoea, with particularly grave impact on infants and immunocompromised individuals. There is neither a vaccine nor an effective treatment. Here we establish a drug discovery process built on scalable phenotypic assays and mouse models that take advantage of transgenic parasites. Screening a library of compounds with anti-parasitic activity, we identify pyrazolopyridines as inhibitors of Cryptosporidium parvum and Cryptosporidium hominis. Oral treatment with the pyrazolopyridine KDU731 results in a potent reduction in intestinal infection of immunocompromised mice. Treatment also leads to rapid resolution of diarrhoea and dehydration in neonatal calves, a clinical model of cryptosporidiosis that closely resembles human infection. Our results suggest that the Cryptosporidium lipid kinase PI(4)K (phosphatidylinositol-4-OH kinase) is a target for pyrazolopyridines and that KDU731 warrants further preclinical evaluation as a drug candidate for the treatment of cryptosporidiosis."
https://openalex.org/W2618969857,"Random mutagenesis in haploid human cells coupled to quantitative protein measurements with different antibodies is used as a readout for individual cellular phenotypes. Genetic perturbation approaches have been used to study the regulatory networks of human cells, but many cellular events don't affect traditional assay readouts such as cell fitness or gene expression. Here, Thijn Brummelkamp and colleagues use random mutagenesis in haploid human cells coupled to quantitative protein measurements with different antibodies as a readout for cellular phenotypes. They identify genetic regulators of a variety of protein states, with some affecting a narrow phenotype and others having a broader effect. They find genes that regulate the phosphorylation state of the kinase AKT, including a link to GPCR signalling. The approach could potentially be applied to generate a comprehensive genetic wiring map based on protein-related phenotypes. As key executers of biological functions, the activity and abundance of proteins are subjected to extensive regulation. Deciphering the genetic architecture underlying this regulation is critical for understanding cellular signalling events and responses to environmental cues. Using random mutagenesis in haploid human cells, we apply a sensitive approach to directly couple genomic mutations to protein measurements in individual cells. Here we use this to examine a suite of cellular processes, such as transcriptional induction, regulation of protein abundance and splicing, signalling cascades (mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), protein kinase B (AKT), interferon, and Wingless and Int-related protein (WNT) pathways) and epigenetic modifications (histone crotonylation and methylation). This scalable, sequencing-based procedure elucidates the genetic landscapes that control protein states, identifying genes that cause very narrow phenotypic effects and genes that lead to broad phenotypic consequences. The resulting genetic wiring map identifies the E3-ligase substrate adaptor KCTD5 (ref. 1) as a negative regulator of the AKT pathway, a key signalling cascade frequently deregulated in cancer. KCTD5-deficient cells show elevated levels of phospho-AKT at S473 that could not be attributed to effects on canonical pathway components. To reveal the genetic requirements for this phenotype, we iteratively analysed the regulatory network linked to AKT activity in the knockout background. This genetic modifier screen exposes suppressors of the KCTD5 phenotype and mechanistically demonstrates that KCTD5 acts as an off-switch for GPCR signalling by triggering proteolysis of Gβγ heterodimers dissociated from the Gα subunit. Although biological networks have previously been constructed on the basis of gene expression2,3, protein–protein associations4,5,6, or genetic interaction profiles7,8, we foresee that the approach described here will enable the generation of a comprehensive genetic wiring map for human cells on the basis of quantitative protein states."
https://openalex.org/W2618249749,"Adult pair bonding involves dramatic changes in the perception and valuation of another individual. One key change is that partners come to reliably activate the brain's reward system, although the precise neural mechanisms by which partners become rewarding during sociosexual interactions leading to a bond remain unclear. Here we show, using a prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster) model of social bonding, how a functional circuit from the medial prefrontal cortex to nucleus accumbens is dynamically modulated to enhance females' affiliative behaviour towards a partner. Individual variation in the strength of this functional connectivity, particularly after the first mating encounter, predicts how quickly animals begin affiliative huddling with their partner. Rhythmically activating this circuit in a social context without mating biases later preference towards a partner, indicating that this circuit's activity is not just correlated with how quickly animals become affiliative but causally accelerates it. These results provide the first dynamic view of corticostriatal activity during bond formation, revealing how social interactions can recruit brain reward systems to drive changes in affiliative behaviour."

We reviewed patient data at three PrEP clinics (Jackson, Mississippi; St. Louis, Missouri; Providence, Rhode Island) from 2014-2015. The outcome, PrEP utilization, was defined as patient PrEP use at three months. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to determine the association between insurance coverage and PrEP utilization. Of 201 patients (Jackson: 34%; St. Louis: 28%; Providence: 28%), 91% were male, 51% were White, median age was 29 years, and 21% were uninsured; 82% of patients reported taking PrEP at three months. Insurance coverage was significantly associated with PrEP utilization. After adjusting for Medicaid-expansion and individual socio-demographics, insured patients were four times as likely to use PrEP services compared to the uninsured (OR: 4.49, 95% CI: 1.68-12.01; p = 0.003). Disparities in insurance coverage are important considerations in implementation programs and may impede PrEP utilization."

https://openalex.org/W2617157486,"UBE3A is a HECT domain E3 ubiquitin ligase whose dysfunction is linked to autism, Angelman syndrome, and cancer. Recently, we characterized a de novo autism-linked UBE3A mutant (UBE3AT485A) that disrupts phosphorylation control of UBE3A activity. Through quantitative proteomics and reporter assays, we found that the UBE3AT485A protein ubiquitinates multiple proteasome subunits, reduces proteasome subunit abundance and activity, stabilizes nuclear β-catenin, and stimulates canonical Wnt signaling more effectively than wild-type UBE3A. We also found that UBE3AT485A activates Wnt signaling to a greater extent in cells with low levels of ongoing Wnt signaling, suggesting that cells with low basal Wnt activity are particularly vulnerable to UBE3AT485A mutation. Ligase-dead UBE3A did not stimulate Wnt pathway activation. Overexpression of several proteasome subunits reversed the effect of UBE3AT485A on Wnt signaling. We also observed that subunits that interact with UBE3A and affect Wnt signaling are located along one side of the 19S regulatory particle, indicating a previously unrecognized spatial organization to the proteasome. Altogether, our findings indicate that UBE3A regulates Wnt signaling in a cell context-dependent manner and that an autism-linked mutation exacerbates these signaling effects. Our study has broad implications for human disorders associated with UBE3A gain or loss of function and suggests that dysfunctional UBE3A might affect additional proteins and pathways that are sensitive to proteasome activity."

Several features have been suggested to be necessary for ePK activity (Fig. 1), including proximal positioning and proper folding of the αC helix, formation of a salt bridge between the conserved glutamate on the αC helix and the conserved lysine on the β4 sheet (Lys–Glu salt bridge), formation of the regulatory and catalytic hydrophobic spines, outward positioning of the conserved phenylalanine in the DFG motif away from the active site, and unfolding of the activation loop (1Taylor S.S.

Careful positioning of these regulatory components is necessary for an ePK to perform catalysis, meaning that any conformation with a regulatory structure out of place is inactive. Despite the resultantly enormous multiplicity of possible inactive states, several distinct conformations recur throughout the ePKs. For example, the human cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase Src takes on an inactive conformation where the unphosphorylated activation loop folds and obscures the active site and the αC helix swings away from the active site in concert with breakage of the Lys–Glu salt bridge (9Jura N.

Because the focus of research on ePKs has been on clades directly relevant to medicine (i.e. the vertebrates), it remains unclear how similar the activation processes of non-animal ePKs are to those in animals. Given the highly conserved nature of ePK structures across the eukaryotes (1Taylor S.S. Kornev A.P. Protein kinases: evolution of dynamic regulatory proteins.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2011; 36: 65-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar), some insight into non-animal ePK activation can be gleaned from the expansive structural information available from animal systems; however, the possibility of unique activation mechanisms not found in animal ePKs remains. Brassinosteroid-insensitive 1 (BRI1) and BRI1-associated kinase 1 (BAK1) are members of the leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs), a group of structurally similar membrane receptors within the monophyletic RLK clade, which is homologous to and shares functional characteristics with the animal Pelle kinases (11Shiu S.-H.

Although LRR-RLKs are intrinsic membrane proteins, each with an extracellular domain, a single transmembrane helix, a juxtamembrane domain, and an intracellular dual-specificity kinase domain, we have performed simulations of each kinase domain in isolation. These two proteins play a critical role in control of plant growth and development along with other processes (12Zhu J.-Y. Sae-Seaw J. Wang Z.-Y.

Here, we studied the conformational dynamics of the Arabidopsis thaliana BRI1 and BAK1 through atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Biomolecular MD simulation uses the initial coordinates of all atoms from a crystal structure as an input, assigns an initial velocity to each atom, and numerically integrates the classical equations of motion to yield a trajectory through time. Interactions between atoms are represented in approximate form with parameters chosen according to experiments and quantum mechanical calculations. Although structural biology techniques are constantly improving in their ability to resolve protein structures, MD simulation provides unparalleled detail into the conformational dynamics of biomolecules (22Lee E.H.

Biomolecular simulation: a computational microscope for molecular biology.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2012; 41: 429-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). With the power of this technique, we sought to characterize the conformational dynamics governing the activity of BRI1 and BAK1, specifically in terms of known ePK activation features. To identify the structural features important for BRI1 and BAK1 activation, we performed extensive molecular dynamics simulations of their isolated kinase domains. Despite the fact that the simulated BRI1 kinase domain was fully phosphorylated, a necessary condition for complete BRI1 activation, we observed a high degree of αC helix disorder and breaking of the conserved Lys–Glu salt bridge (Fig. 2a). Still, the active-like state is the most stable region (Fig. 2a, region I), although there does not appear to be a free energy barrier to unfolding of the αC helix with the Lys–Glu salt bridge formed (Fig. 2a, region II) until there is already a significant degree of disorder. It is unclear how this unfolding behavior concurrent with a formed Lys–Glu salt bridge affects catalytic activity. Disorder in the BRI1 αC helix is supported by CD spectroscopy experiments of the isolated BRI1 αC helix peptide, showing an intermediate degree of helicity as compared with the disordered human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and helical hSrc αC helix peptides (supplemental Fig. S1 and Tables S1 and S2). The Lys–Glu salt bridge can be broken, whereas the αC helix remains ordered (Fig. 2a, unlabeled region above region I) likely due to interaction between Lys911 and ATP, whereas further distance between Lys911 and Glu927 coincides with greater fluctuation in the same distance. The region characterized by a large distance between Lys911 and Glu927 (Fig. 2a, regions III and IV) covers a range of αC helix disorder similar to the region with a formed Lys–Glu salt bridge (Fig. 2a, regions I and II). The distance between Lys911 and Glu927 is measured between the terminal nitrogen atom in lysine and the δ-carbon in glutamate, meaning that changes in this distance while the αC helix remains ordered could be caused by conformational changes in the side chains, swinging of the αC helix outward, or some combination of the two. Region III in Fig. 2a represents breaking of the Lys–Glu salt bridge coupled with distal movement of the αC helix (supplemental Fig. S2). This suggests the presence of a Src-like inactive state in BRI1 where the αC helix remains folded but swings outward from its active-like position, breaking the Lys–Glu salt bridge while preventing rapid reformation by conformational changes in the side chains alone. The Src-like inactive state represents the second most stable region of the free energy landscape, possibly meaning that transitions to this state are the main mechanism of BRI1 deactivation when only considering its internal conformational dynamics. Glu927 interacts extensively with Arg1032 on the activation loop when the Glu927–Lys911 interaction is broken (supplemental Fig. S3) in a manner similar to human Src kinase (24Ozkirimli E. Yadav S.S. Miller W.T. Post C.B. An electrostatic network and long-range regulation of Src kinases.Protein Sci. 2008; 17: 1871-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Similarly to BRI1, BAK1 has an active-like state (Fig. 3a, region I), a region with αC helix disorder but retaining the Lys–Glu salt bridge (Fig. 3a, region II), and a state with a folded and active-like positioned αC helix and a broken Lys–Glu salt bridge due to interaction between Lys317 and ATP (Fig. 3a, region III). However, BAK1 does not take on a Src-like inactive conformation as there is no distal swinging of the folded αC helix (supplemental Fig. S4) and minimal interaction between Glu334 and Lys439, the lysine residue in the position on the activation loop analogous to BRI1 Arg1032 (supplemental Fig. S5). Furthermore, conformations with a marginally broken Lys–Glu salt bridge are far less stable in BAK1 as compared with BRI1 (Fig. 3, a and b, region III). The most striking feature of the BAK1 free energy landscape is the large, well populated area where the αC helix is highly disordered (Fig. 3a, region IV), allowing for a large range of distances between Lys317 and Glu334. Breaking of the Lys–Glu salt bridge allows for a greater extent of αC helix disorder in BAK1 than in BRI1. It is unclear whether the disorder in the BAK1 and BRI1 αC helices is primarily due to interaction with neighboring residues or intrinsic disorder of the αC helix itself. In the former case, a stable αC helix sequence of another kinase substituted for the native sequence would likely also display disorder. Because of issues with solubility for the BAK1 αC helix peptide, instead of performing CD spectroscopy we substituted the otherwise stable hSrc αC helix for the native BAK1 αC helix sequence in silico. We found that the hSrc αC helix remains stable relative to the native BAK1 helix, eliminating a large portion of the unfolded region (Fig. 4a, region IV) although still allowing for notable deviation from a purely helical form (Fig. 4a, regions II and IV). All together, the data suggest the presence of intrinsic disorder, although we cannot rule out a role for structural context from these results alone. In addition to the stabilized αC helix, the conserved Lys–Glu salt bridge is also stabilized where the αC helix remains folded in the main region of breakage (Fig. 4a, region III). As with native BAK1, there does not appear to be a Src-like inactive state (supplemental Fig. S6). Although the extent of unfolding of the Src αC helix is lesser than that of the native BAK1 αC helix, there is little barrier to partial unfolding when the Lys–Glu salt bridge is formed. Regions I and II of Fig. 4a appear to constitute a kinetically indistinct state where the BAK1-Src αC helix can partially unfold and refold while constrained by the Lys–Glu salt bridge, whereas breaking of the Lys–Glu salt bridge occurs primarily by way of region I into region III over a free energy barrier of ∼2–3 kcal·mol−1. This transition is likely due to a rotation of the lysine side chain toward the negatively charged ATP phosphate groups as is seen in native BRI1 and BAK1. Interestingly, there is a small, low free energy region near 5-Å αC helix r.m.s.d. and 20-Å Lys–Glu salt bridge distance (Fig. 4a, above region IV). However, the low free energy of this region is likely due to sampling error (see supplemental material for further discussion). Additionally, we calculated the mean solvent-accessible surface area of each residue in the αC helix of BRI1, BAK1, and BAK1-Src for comparison with future potential hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments (supplemental Fig. S7). To investigate the universality of αC helix disorder in the A. thaliana kinome, we obtained a previously identified set of 930 A. thaliana ePK sequences (25Zulawski M. Schulze G. Braginets R. Hartmann S. Schulze W.X. The Arabidopsis kinome: Phylogeny and evolutionary insights into functional diversification.BMC Genomics. 2014; 15: 548Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and used the PONDR-FIT web server (26Xue B. Dunbrack R.L. Williams R.W. Dunker A.K. Uversky V.N. PONDR-FIT: A meta-predictor of intrinsically disordered amino acids.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1804: 996-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar) to predict disorder propensities of residues in putative αC helix regions and mapped the predicted disorder propensities onto a previously published A. thaliana kinome phylogenetic tree (Fig. 5a) (25Zulawski M. Schulze G. Braginets R. Hartmann S. Schulze W.X. The Arabidopsis kinome: Phylogeny and evolutionary insights into functional diversification.BMC Genomics. 2014; 15: 548Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It is evident from this tree that αC helix disorder is predicted to be widespread across the A. thaliana kinome, suggesting that transitions between ordered and disordered states in this region could be a common regulatory mechanism. We repeated the same analysis for the Oryza sativa (supplemental Figs. S8 and S9) and human kinomes (supplemental Figs. S10 and S11), finding similar levels of disorder in putative αC helix regions. As a check for consistency with our simulations, we found that the hSrc sequence is predicted to have low disorder across the αC helix region, whereas hEGFR and BRI1 are predicted to display disorder qualitatively similar to the average A. thaliana ePK (Fig. 5b). In contrast, BAK1 displays disorder near the upper boundary of the interquartile range for all examined residues (Fig. 5b) and is clearly on the upper tail of the distribution of average αC helix residue disorder (Fig. 5c). Several ePK families are predicted to have a majority of members with high αC helix disorder, including the CRR, NEK, and SnRK1 families (supplemental Fig. S12). It is no surprise that BRI1 and BAK1 would be heavily regulated given their great importance in plant growth and development (14Wang W. Bai M.-Y. Wang Z.-Y.

Given that fully phosphorylated, ATP-bound BRI1 and BAK1 were able to spontaneously transition from active-like to inactive conformations characterized by broken Lys–Glu salt bridges and varying degrees of αC helix unfolding (Fig. 6), the presence of intrinsic αC disorder could provide insight into how BRI1–BAK1 association leads to their activation. It is possible that αC helix stabilization due to physical interaction between BRI1 and BAK1 is necessary for activation in addition to phosphorylation in a fashion similar to the metazoan EGFR, a receptor tyrosine kinase implicated in multiple cancers (9Jura N.

In human EGFR, disorder in the αC helix is believed to be suppressed by ligand-induced homodimerization and formation of an asymmetric dimer in the kinase domains with one kinase acting as an activator for the other (9Jura N.

By comparison with hEGFR, our discovery of highly populated states in large-timescale MD simulations of the BRI1 and BAK1 kinase domains characterized by disorder in the αC helices suggests that dimerization of BRI1 and BAK1 might promote catalytically competent conformations of both proteins via stabilization of their respective αC helices as has been suggested previously based on the similarity of inhibitor-binding interfaces in hEGFR and BRI1 (32Belkhadir Y. Jaillais Y. The molecular circuitry of brassinosteroid signaling.New Phytol. 2015; 206: 522-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, as we have simulated BRI1 and BAK1 isolated from all potentially interacting proteins and relieved of their juxtamembrane and C-terminal tail domains, there are other mechanisms through which BRI1 and BAK1 could suppress αC helix disorder, and pointed experiments are needed to provide more definitive evidence for this hypothesis. To the best of our knowledge, EGFR is the only other ePK that displays αC helix disorder in previous MD studies (33Shan Y. Eastwood M.P. Zhang X. Kim E.T. Arkhipov A. Dror R.O. Jumper J. Kuriyan J. Shaw D.E. Oncogenic mutations counteract intrinsic disorder in the EGFR kinase and promote receptor dimerization.Cell. 2012; 149: 860-870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). This could be more due to the small fraction of ePKs that have been simulated than general stability of the αC helix given the high levels of disorder we have predicted in three different kinomes. However, there is αC helix disorder in a crystal structure of human AKT1 caused by inhibitor binding (35Wu W.-I. Voegtli W.C. Sturgis H.L. Dizon F.P. Vigers G.P. Brandhuber B.J. Crystal structure of human akt1 with an allosteric inhibitor reveals a new mode of kinase inhibition.PLoS One. 2010; 5: e12913Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Additionally, distal swinging of the αC helix away from the active site is a well established mechanism of deactivation in numerous animal ePKs where interactions with regulatory domains or other kinases causes proximal relocation of the αC helix and subsequent activation (1Taylor S.S.

Uterine contraction is a central feature of PTB, so gaining new insights into the mechanisms of this contraction and consequently identifying novel targets for tocolytics are essential for more successful management of PTB. Here we report that myometrial cells from human and mouse express bitter taste receptors (TAS2Rs) and their canonical signaling components (i.e., G-protein gustducin and phospholipase C β2). Bitter tastants can completely relax myometrium precontracted by different uterotonics. In isolated single mouse myometrial cells, a phenotypical bitter tastant (chloroquine, ChQ) reverses the rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and cell shortening induced by uterotonics, and this reversal effect is inhibited by pertussis toxin and by genetic deletion of a-gustducin. In human myometrial cells, knockdown of TAS2R14 but not TAS2R10 inhibits ChQ’s reversal effect on an oxytocin-induced rise in [Ca2+]i. Finally, ChQ prevents mouse PTBs induced by bacterial endotoxin LPS or progesterone receptor antagonist mifepristone more often than current commonly used tocolytics, and this prevention is largely lost in α-gustducin-knockout mice. Collectively, our results reveal that activation of the canonical TAS2R signaling system in myometrial cells produces profound relaxation of myometrium precontracted by a broad spectrum of contractile agonists, and that targeting TAS2Rs is an attractive approach to developing effective tocolytics for PTB management.—Zheng, K., Lu, P., Delpapa, E., Bellve, K., Deng, R., Condon, J.

https://openalex.org/W2617859425,"Late blight (caused by Phytophthora infestans) is a devastating potato disease that has been found to occur earlier in the season over the last decades in Fennoscandia. Up until now the reasons for this change have not been investigated. Possible explanations for this change are climate alterations, changes in potato production or changes in pathogen biology, such as increased fitness or changes in gene flow within P. infestans populations. The first incidence of late blight is of high economic importance since fungicidal applications should be typically applied two weeks before the first signs of late blight and are repeated on average once a week.We use field observations of first incidence of late blight in experimental potato fields from five sites in Sweden and Finland covering a total of 30 years and investigate whether the earlier incidence of late blight can be related to the climate.We linked the field data to meteorological data and found that the previous assumption, used in common late blight models, that the disease only develops at relative humidity levels above 90% had to be rejected. Rather than the typically assumed threshold relationship between late blight disease development and relative humidity we found a linear relationship. Our model furthermore showed two distinct responses of late blight to climate. At the beginning of the observation time (in Sweden until the early 90s and in Finland until the 2000s) the link between climate and first incidence was very weak. However, for the remainder of the time period the link was highly significant, indicating a change in the biological properties of the pathogen which could for example be a change in the dominating reproduction mode or a physiological change in the response of the pathogen to climate.The study shows that models used in decision support systems need to be checked and re-parametrized regularly to be able to capture changes in pathogen biology. While this study was performed with data from Fennoscandia this new pathogen biology and late blight might spread to (or already be present at) other parts of the world as well. The strong link between climate and first incidence together with the presented model offers a tool to assess late blight incidence in future climates."

However, information on the molecular mechanisms conferring tolerance of harvested leaves to pre- and postharvest stresses during processing and shelf-life have never been investigated. Here, we provide the first transcriptomic resource of rocket by de novo RNA sequencing assembly, functional annotation and stress-induced expression analysis of 33874 transcripts. Transcriptomic changes in leaves subjected to commercially-relevant pre-harvest (salinity, heat and nitrogen starvation) and postharvest stresses (cold, dehydration, dark, wounding) known to affect quality and shelf-life were analysed 24h after stress treatment, a timing relevant to subsequent processing of salad leaves. Transcription factors and genes involved in plant growth regulator signaling, autophagy, senescence and glucosinolate metabolism were the most affected by the stresses. Hundreds of genes with unknown function but uniquely expressed under stress were identified, providing candidates to investigate stress responses in rocket. Dehydration and wounding had the greatest effect on the transcriptome and different stresses elicited changes in the expression of genes related to overlapping groups of hormones. These data will allow development of approaches targeted at improving stress tolerance, quality and shelf-life of rocket with direct applications in the fresh-cut industries."
https://openalex.org/W2616887559,"Background Although high dose of antimony is the mainstay for treatment of American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL), ongoing major concerns remain over its toxicity. Whether or not low dose antimony regimens provide non-inferior effectiveness and lower toxicity has long been a question of dispute. Methods A single-blind, non-inferiority, randomized controlled trial was conducted comparing high dose with low dose of antimony in subjects with ACL treated at a referral center in Rio de Janeiro, an endemic area of Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis transmission. The primary outcome was clinical cure at 360 days of follow-up in the modified-intention-to-treat (mITT) and per-protocol (PP) populations. Non-inferiority margin was 15%. Secondary objectives included occurrence of epithelialization, adverse events and drug discontinuations. This study was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01301924. Results Overall, 72 patients were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment arms during October 2008 to July 2014. In mITT, clinical cure was observed in 77.8% of subjects in the low dose antimony group and 94.4% in the high dose antimony group after one series of treatment (risk difference 16.7%; 90% CI, 3.7–29.7). The results were confirmed in PP analysis, with 77.8% of subjects with clinical cure in the low dose antimony group and 97.1% in the high dose antimony group (risk difference 19.4%; 90% CI, 7.1–31.7). The upper limit of the confidence interval exceeded the 15% threshold and was also above zero supporting the hypothesis that low dose is inferior to high dose of antimony after one series of treatment. Nevertheless, more major adverse events, a greater number of adverse events and major adverse events per subject, and more drug discontinuations were observed in the high dose antimony group (all p<0.05). Interestingly, of all the subjects who were originally allocated to the low dose antimony group and were followed up after clinical failure, 85.7% achieved cure after a further treatment with local therapy or low dose of antimony. Conclusions Compared with high dose, low dose of antimony was inferior at the pre-specified margin after one series of treatment of ACL, but was associated with a significantly lower toxicity. While high dose of antimony should remain the standard treatment for ACL, low dose antimony treatment might be preferred when toxicity is a primary concern."

A representative sample of 635 adults (144 males and 491 females) aged 50 years and over completed a test battery MLS (Motor Performance Series) to assess a broad range of hand functions. Functional asymmetry was observed in all four motor tests (postural tremor, aiming, tapping, and inserting long pins). Significant differences between the dominant and non-dominant hand were obtained in both sexes across all age groups, except in the oldest female group (age >70) for the aiming (number of hits and errors) and postural tremor (number of errors) tasks. These differences in age-related changes may be attributed to hemispheric asymmetry, environmental factors, or use-dependent plasticity. Conflicting evidence in the literature warrants additional research to better explain age-related alterations of hand dominance and manual performance in old age."

The pursuit of novel cytotoxic payloads beyond the mictotubule inhibitors and DNA damaging agents has led us to the recent discovery of an mRNA splicing inhibitor, thailanstatin, as a potent ADC payload. In our previous work, we observed that the potency of this payload was uniquely tied to the method of conjugation, with lysine conjugates showing much superior potency as compared to cysteine conjugates. However, the ADC field is rapidly shifting towards site-specific ADCs due to their advantages in manufacturability, characterization and safety. In this work we report the identification of a highly efficacious site-specific thailanstatin ADC. The site of conjugation played a critical role on both the in vitro and in vivo potency of these ADCs. During the course of this study, we developed a novel methodology of loading a single site with multiple payloads using an in situ generated multi-drug carrying peptidic linker that allowed us to rapidly screen for optimal conjugation sites. Using this methodology, we were able to identify a double-cysteine mutant ADC delivering four-loaded thailanstatin that was very efficacious in a gastric cancer xenograft model at 3mg/kg and was also shown to be efficacious against T-DM1 resistant and MDR1 overexpressing tumor cell lines."

Activities implemented included secondary data analyses to determine land use and land cover (LULC) changes as well as human, livestock and wildlife population trends; entomological surveys to characterize mosquitoes population densities and species distribution by habitat and season; and serological surveys in people to determine the risk of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), West Nile fever virus (WNV), dengue fever virus (DFV), Leptospira spp. and Brucella spp. Results demonstrate a drastic decline in vegetation cover over ≈25 years particularly in the irrigated areas where cropland increased by about 1,400% and non-farm land (under closed trees, open to closed herbaceous vegetation, bushlands and open trees) reduced by 30–100%. The irrigated areas had high densities of Aedes mcintoshi, Culex spp. and Mansonia spp. (important vectors for multiple arboviruses) during the wet and dry season while pastoral areas had high densities of Ae. tricholabis specifically in the wet season. The seroprevalences of RVFV, WNV and DFV were higher in the irrigated compared to the pastoral areas while those for Leptospira spp and Brucella spp. were higher in the pastoral compared to the irrigated areas. It is likely that people in the pastoral areas get exposed to Leptospira spp by using water fetched from reservoirs that are shared with livestock and wildlife, and to Brucella spp. by consuming raw or partially cooked animal-source foods such as milk and meat. This study suggests that irrigation increases the risk of mosquito-borne infections while at the same time providing a protective effect against zoonotic pathogens that thrive in areas with high livestock population densities."

We also found that Glut-2 membrane expression was reduced in FL-N/35 mice and that hepatocyte glucose uptake was perturbed, partly accounting for the HCV-induced glucose intolerance in these mice. Early steps of the hepatic insulin signaling pathway, from IRS2 to PDK1 phosphorylation, were constitutively impaired in FL-N/35 primary hepatocytes via deregulation of TNFα/SOCS3. Higher hepatic glucose production was observed in the HCV mice, despite higher fasting insulinemia, concomitant with decreased expression of hepatic gluconeogenic genes. Akt kinase activity was higher in HCV mice than in WT mice, but Akt-dependent phosphorylation of the forkhead transcription factor FoxO1 at serine 256, which triggers its nuclear exclusion, was lower in HCV mouse livers. These findings indicate an uncoupling of the canonical Akt/FoxO1 pathway in HCV protein-expressing hepatocytes. Thus, the expression of HCV proteins in the liver is sufficient to induce insulin resistance by impairing insulin signaling and glucose uptake.

The aim of this study was to estimate the disease burden of CT in Denmark, a developed country with free public healthcare and nationwide data available.Using data primarily from two public health surveillance programmes conducted between 1992 and 2007, we estimated the incidence, occurrence of sequelae, mortality and the burden of disease in terms of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of CT in Denmark in 2014.We estimated that 14 children were born with CT in 2014, of which six will have developed sequelae by the age of 12. CT resulted in a total disease burden of 123 DALYs (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 100-148), of which 78 (95% UI, 64-94) were due to foetal loss and 2 (95% UI, 1-3) were due to neonatal death; the remaining burden was due to moderate to severe life-long sequelae. A comparison of the estimated incidence of CT with the number of reported CT cases in 2008-2014 indicated that for each reported CT case, at least five other CT cases could be expected to have occurred and gone unreported.Early onset, severity, and life-long duration of sequelae have a major effect on the disease burden of CT. Our data suggest that CT is under-diagnosed or under-reported in Denmark. The estimated disease burden and public health impact in Denmark is lower than in other European countries, highlighting the need for country-specific studies."
https://openalex.org/W2619952150,"A new species of the family Alphaflexiviridae provisionally named alfalfa virus S (AVS) was discovered in alfalfa samples originating from Sudan. A complete nucleotide sequence of the viral genome consisting of 8,349 nucleotides excluding the 3' poly(A) tail was determined by high throughput sequencing (HTS) on an Illumina platform. NCBI BLAST searches revealed that the virus shares the greatest degree of sequence identity with members of the family Alphaflexiviridae, genus Allexivirus. The AVS genome contains six computationally-predicted open reading frames (ORF) encoding viral replication protein, triple gene block protein 1 (TGB1), TGB2, TGB3-like protein, unknown 38.4 kDa protein resembling serine-rich 40 kDa protein characteristic for allexiviruses, and coat protein (CP). AVS lacks a clear 3' proximal ORF that encodes a nucleic acid-binding protein typical for allexiviruses. The identity of the virus was confirmed by RT-PCR with primers derived from the HTS-generated sequence, dot blot hybridization with DIG-labeled virus-specific RNA probes, and Western blot analysis with antibodies produced against a peptide derived from the CP sequence. Transmission electron microscopic observations of the infected tissues showed the presence of filamentous particles similar to allexiviruses in their length and appearance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the identification of a putative allexivirus in alfalfa (Medicago sativa).

Recently, ubiquitin–protein ligase E3 component N-recognin 5 (UBR5) has been identified as a component of miRISC.

However, the regulation of miRISC-associated UBR5 remains largely elusive. In the present study, we showed that UBR5 down-regulates the levels of TNF receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3), a key component of Toll-like receptor signaling, via the miRNA pathway. We further demonstrated that p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (p90RSK) is an upstream regulator of UBR5. p90RSK phosphorylates UBR5 at Thr637, Ser1227, and Ser2483, and this phosphorylation is required for the translational repression of TRAF3 mRNA. Phosphorylated UBR5 co-localized with GW182 and Ago2 in cytoplasmic speckles, which implies that miRISC is affected by phospho-UBR5.

To examine the role of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell cytokines in latent tuberculosis (LTB) with coincident PDM, we studied the baseline, mycobacterial, control antigen and mitogen–stimulated T cell cytokine responses in LTB individuals with (LTB-PDM; n = 20) or without (LTB-NDM; n = 20) concomitant prediabetes. LTB-PDM is characterized by diminished frequencies of mono–and dual–functional CD4+ Th1 and Th17 cells and mono-functional Th2 cells at baseline and/or following mycobacterial—antigen stimulation in comparison to LTB-NDM. LTB-PDM is also characterized by diminished frequencies of mono–functional CD8+ Tc1, Tc2 and Tc17 cells at baseline and/or following mycobacterial–antigen stimulation in comparison to LTB-NDM. LTB-PDM is therefore characterized by diminished frequencies of antigen–specific Th1/Tc1 and Th17/Tc17 cells, indicating that PDM is associated with alterations of the immune response in latent TB associated with compromised CD4+ and CD8+ T cell function."

Because a required quinolinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRTase) is not encoded in its genome, Caenorhabditis elegans are reported to lack a de novo NAD+ biosynthetic pathway. However, all the genes of the kynurenine pathway required for quinolinic acid (QA) production from tryptophan are present. Thus, we investigated the presence of de novo NAD+ biosynthesis in this organism. By combining isotope-tracing and genetic experiments, we have demonstrated the presence of an intact de novo biosynthesis pathway for NAD+ from tryptophan via QA, highlighting the functional conservation of this important biosynthetic activity. Supplementation with kynurenine pathway intermediates also boosted NAD+ levels and partially reversed NAD+-dependent phenotypes caused by mutation of pnc-1, which encodes a nicotinamidase required for NAD+ salvage biosynthesis, demonstrating contribution of de novo synthesis to NAD+ homeostasis. By investigating candidate phosphoribosyltransferase genes in the genome, we determined that the conserved uridine monophosphate phosphoribosyltransferase (UMPS), which acts in pyrimidine biosynthesis, is required for NAD+ biosynthesis in place of the missing QPRTase. We suggest that similar underground metabolic activity of UMPS may function in other organisms.

https://openalex.org/W2618322383,"Multispectral palmprint recognition has shown broad prospects for personal identification due to its high accuracy and great stability. In this paper, we develop a novel illumination-invariant multispectral palmprint recognition method. To combine the information from multiple spectral bands, an image-level fusion framework is completed based on a fast and adaptive bidimensional empirical mode decomposition (FABEMD) and a weighted Fisher criterion. The FABEMD technique decomposes the multispectral images into their bidimensional intrinsic mode functions (BIMFs), on which an illumination compensation operation is performed. The weighted Fisher criterion is to construct the fusion coefficients at the decomposition level, making the images be separated correctly in the fusion space. The image fusion framework has shown strong robustness against illumination variation. In addition, a tensor-based extreme learning machine (TELM) mechanism is presented for feature extraction and classification of two-dimensional (2D) images. In general, this method has fast learning speed and satisfying recognition accuracy. Comprehensive experiments conducted on the PolyU multispectral palmprint database illustrate that the proposed method can achieve favorable results. For the testing under ideal illumination, the recognition accuracy is as high as 99.93%, and the result is 99.50% when the lighting condition is unsatisfied."
https://openalex.org/W2619743494,"The distributions of many Northern Hemisphere organisms have been influenced by fluctuations in sea level and climatic conditions during Pleistocene interglacial periods. These cycles are associated with range contraction and refugia for northern-distributed organisms as a response to glaciers. However, lower sea levels in the tropics and sub-tropics created available habitat for expansion of the ranges of freshwater organisms. The goal of this study was to use ecological niche modeling to test the hypothesis of north to south range expansion of Vieja maculicauda associated with Pleistocene glacial cycles. Understanding the biogeography of this widespread species may help us better understand the geology and interconnectivity of Central American freshwaters. Occurrence data for V. maculicauda was based on georeferencing of all museum records of specimens recovered from FishNet2. General patterns of phylogeographic structure were assessed with mtDNA. Present day niche models were generated and subsequently projected onto paleoclimatic maps of the region during the Last Interglacial, Last Glacial Maximum, and mid-Holocene. Phylogenetic analysis of mtDNA sequence data showed no phylogeographic structure throughout the range of this widespread species. Present day niche models were congruent with the observed distribution of V. maculicauda in Central America. Results showed a lack of suitable freshwater habitat in northern Central America and Mexico during the Last Interglacial, with greatest range expansion during the Last Glacial Maximum and mid-Holocene. Results support the hypothesis of a north to south range expansion of V. maculicauda associated with glacial cycles. The wide distribution of this species compared to other closely related cichlids indicates the latter did not respond to the degree of V. maculicauda in expansion of their distributions. Future work aimed at comparisons with other species and modeling of future climatic scenarios will be a fruitful area of investigation."

However, a global infestation of Dubas bug (Ommatissus lybicus Bergevin) has impacted the Middle East region, and infestations of date palms have been widespread. In this study, spatial analysis and geostatistical techniques were used to model the spatial distribution of Dubas bug infestations to (a) identify correlations between Dubas bug densities and different environmental variables, and (b) predict the locations of future Dubas bug infestations in Oman. Firstly, we considered individual environmental variables and their correlations with infestation locations. Then, we applied more complex predictive models and regression analysis techniques to investigate the combinations of environmental factors most conducive to the survival and spread of the Dubas bug. Environmental variables including elevation, geology, and distance to drainage pathways were found to significantly affect Dubas bug infestations. In contrast, aspect and hillshade did not significantly impact on Dubas bug infestations. Understanding their distribution and therefore applying targeted controls on their spread is important for effective mapping, control and management (e.g., resource allocation) of Dubas bug infestations."

We identified a novel truncated adipocyte-specific isoform of APMAP in mice that is produced by alternative transcription. Mice lacking the full-length APMAP protein, the only isoform that is expressed in humans, have an improved metabolic phenotype upon diet-induced obesity, indicated by enhanced insulin sensitivity, preserved glucose tolerance, increased respiratory exchange ratio, decreased inflammatory marker gene expression, and reduced adipocyte size. At the molecular level, APMAP interacts with the extracellular collagen cross-linking matrix proteins lysyl oxidase-like 1 and 3. On a high-fat diet, the expression of lysyl oxidase-like 1 and 3 is strongly decreased in Apmap-knockout mice, paralleled by reduced expression of profibrotic collagens and total collagen content in epididymal white adipose tissue, indicating decreased fibrotic potential. Together, our data suggest that APMAP is a novel regulator of extracellular matrix components, and establish that APMAP is a potential target to mitigate obesity-associated insulin resistance.-Pessentheiner, A.

https://openalex.org/W2617704679,"Citizen science opens new pathways that can complement traditional scientific practice. Intuition and reasoning often make humans more effective than computer algorithms in various realms of problem solving. In particular, a simple visual comparison of spatial patterns is a task where humans are often considered to be more reliable than computer algorithms. However, in practice, science still largely depends on computer based solutions, which inevitably gives benefits such as speed and the possibility to automatize processes. However, the human vision can be harnessed to evaluate the reliability of algorithms which are tailored to quantify similarity in spatial patterns. We established a citizen science project to employ the human perception to rate similarity and dissimilarity between simulated spatial patterns of several scenarios of a hydrological catchment model. In total, the turnout counts more than 2500 volunteers that provided over 43000 classifications of 1095 individual subjects. We investigate the capability of a set of advanced statistical performance metrics to mimic the human perception to distinguish between similarity and dissimilarity. Results suggest that more complex metrics are not necessarily better at emulating the human perception, but clearly provide auxiliary information that is valuable for model diagnostics. The metrics clearly differ in their ability to unambiguously distinguish between similar and dissimilar patterns which is regarded a key feature of a reliable metric. The obtained dataset can provide an insightful benchmark to the community to test novel spatial metrics."

We aimed to investigate whether HRV infection induces a specific gene expression pattern in airway epithelial cells. Alveolar epithelial cell monolayers were infected with HRV species B (HRV-B). RNA was extracted from both supernatants and infected monolayer cells at 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours post infection (hpi) and transcriptional profile was analyzed using Affymetrix GeneChip and the results were subsequently validated using quantitative Real-time PCR method. HRV-B infects alveolar epithelial cells which supports implication of the virus with LRTIs. In total 991 genes were found differentially expressed during the course of infection. Of these, 459 genes were up-regulated whereas 532 genes were down-regulated. Differential gene expression at 6 hpi (187 genes up-regulated vs. 156 down-regulated) were significantly represented by gene ontologies related to the chemokines and inflammatory molecules indicating characteristic of viral infection. The 75 up-regulated genes surpassed the down-regulated genes (35) at 12 hpi and their enriched ontologies fell into discrete functional entities such as regulation of apoptosis, anti-apoptosis, and wound healing. At later time points of 24 and 48 hpi, predominated down-regulated genes were enriched for extracellular matrix proteins and airway remodeling events. Our data provides a comprehensive image of host response to HRV infection. The study suggests the underlying molecular regulatory networks genes which might be involved in pathogenicity of the HRV-B and potential targets for further validations and development of effective treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2617653523,"Introduction Many studies have demonstrated elevated circulating levels of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and decreased circulating levels of soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products (sRAGE) in patients with autoimmune diseases. In the present study, we investigated plasma levels of both HMGB1 and sRAGE in primary antiphospholipid syndrome (pAPS) patients. Methods We prospectively recruited 11 pAPS patients, 17 antiphospholipid antibody (APA)-positive SLE patients without APS manifestations (APA+SLE) and 12 SLE patients with secondary APS (APS+SLE). We also recruited 10 healthy controls (HCs). Plasma levels of HMGB1 and sRAGE were determined using sandwich ELISA kits. In addition, plasma levels of HMGB1 were also determined using Western blot in 6 pAPS patients and 6 HCs. Results There was no significant difference in plasma levels of HMGB1 measured by ELISA among subgroups of the enrolled subjects. In addition, there was no significant difference in plasma levels of HMGB1 measured by Western blot between pAPS patients and HCs. On the other hand, we observed a trend toward lower plasma levels of sRAGE in APA+SLE or APS+SLE patients when compared with HCs. However, there was no significant difference in plasma levels of sRAGE between pAPS patients and HCs, or between APA+SLE patients and APS+SLE patients. Conclusion There was no significant difference in plasma levels of sRAGE or HMGB1 between pAPS patients and HCs. Plasma levels of sRAGE/HMGB1 could not be utilized to differentiate between APA+SLE and APS+SLE patients."

Among these patients, gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR was performed in 167 patients with HCC (n = 379; 257 > 1 cm, 122 ≤ 1 cm). HCC was confirmed by MR, CT, or follow-up images. Two radiologists graded likelihood of HCC and assessed MR features. Jackknife alternative free-response receiver operating characteristic (JAFROC) analysis was performed. All HCCs were evaluated concordance rate of LI-RADS.Mean JAFROC figure of merit for large (>1-cm) HCC was 0.948, while that for small HCC was 0.787 with fair agreement (κ = 0.409). Mean sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) were 91% and 90% for large HCC versus 63.0% and 79% for small HCC, respectively. Seventeen of 122 small HCCs (13.9%) were not visible on MR. Among 379 HCCs, 99 met LR-5, and 259 met LR-4. Common features for small HCC included arterial enhancement (81.9%), hepatobiliary phase hypointensity (80.3%), and delayed washout (72.9%).Diagnostic accuracy of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging for small, hypervascular HCCs (Mean figure of merit = 0.787) was still low compared with large HCC (Mean figure of merit = 0.948).

https://openalex.org/W2618217657,"Overexpression of DEK oncogene is associated with increased proliferation of carcinoma cells and it is observed in several solid tumors due to the amplification of the 6p22.3 chromosomal region where DEK locates. Although the same chromosomal amplification occurs in multiple myeloma (MM), a plasma cell neoplasm, whether the expression and the copy number of the DEK gene are affected in MM remains elusive. We show that despite the increased copy number in CD138positive MM cells (4 out of 41 MM samples), DEK mRNA expression was down-regulated compared with that in CD138negative bone marrow (BM) cells of the same patients (P<0.0001). DEK protein was not detectable by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in CD138positive normal plasma cells or in malignant plasma cells of MM patients (n = 56) whereas it was widely expressed in normal and neoplastic B-cells. Stable knockdown or overexpression of DEK in CD138positive MM cell lines did not affect the proliferation and viability of the cells profoundly in the presence or absence of chemotherapeutic agent melphalan whereas knockdown of DEK moderately but significantly increased the expression level of CD138 (p<0.01). Decreased DEK expression in plasma cells suggests a potential role of this gene in plasma cell development and lack of detectable DEK protein by IHC could be used as a biomarker for normal and malignant plasma cells."
https://openalex.org/W2618654504,"Nyos maar is located in the Cameroon Volcanic Line and generates a multitude of primary and secondary hazards to the local population. For risk assessment and hazard mitigation, the age of the Nyos maar eruption provides some vital information. Since previous dating efforts using a range of techniques resulted in vastly varying eruption ages, we applied thermoluminescence (TL) methods to obtain independent and direct chronological constraints for the time of maar formation. Target minerals were granitic quartz clasts contained in pyroclastic surge deposits. Thermoluminescence plateau results prove that heat and/or pressure during the phreatomagmatic eruption was sufficient to reset the inherited luminescence signal of granitic bedrock quartz. Parallel application of three TL measurement protocols to one of the two samples gave consistent equivalent doses for the quartz ultra-violet emission. Despite the robustness of our dose estimates, the assessment of the dose rate was accompanied by methodological challenges, such as estimation of the original size distribution of quartz grains in the pyroclastic deposits. Considering results from additional laboratory analyses to constrain these uncertainties, we calculate an average maximum TL age of 12.3 ± 1.5 ka for the Nyos maar eruption. Based on these new data, a more solid risk assessment can be envisaged."
https://openalex.org/W2620279746,"This study developed a technique system for the measurement, reconstruction, and trait extraction of rice canopy architectures, which have challenged functional–structural plant modeling for decades and have become the foundation of the design of ideo-plant architectures. The system uses the location-separation-measurement method (LSMM) for the collection of data on the canopy architecture and the analytic geometry method for the reconstruction and visualization of the three-dimensional (3D) digital architecture of the rice plant. It also uses the virtual clipping method for extracting the key traits of the canopy architecture such as the leaf area, inclination, and azimuth distribution in spatial coordinates. To establish the technique system, we developed (i) simple tools to measure the spatial position of the stem axis and azimuth of the leaf midrib and to capture images of tillers and leaves; (ii) computer software programs for extracting data on stem diameter, leaf nodes, and leaf midrib curves from the tiller images and data on leaf length, width, and shape from the leaf images; (iii) a database of digital architectures that stores the measured data and facilitates the reconstruction of the 3D visual architecture and the extraction of architectural traits; and (iv) computation algorithms for virtual clipping to stratify the rice canopy, to extend the stratified surface from the horizontal plane to a general curved surface (including a cylindrical surface), and to implement in silico. Each component of the technique system was quantitatively validated and visually compared to images, and the sensitivity of the virtual clipping algorithms was analyzed. This technique is inexpensive and accurate and provides high throughput for the measurement, reconstruction, and trait extraction of rice canopy architectures. The technique provides a more practical method of data collection to serve functional–structural plant models of rice and for the optimization of rice canopy types. Moreover, the technique can be easily adapted for other cereal crops such as wheat, which has numerous stems and leaves sheltering each other."

Researchers identified E2F-2 genes from yeasts to humans, but few reports investigated E2F-2 gene from black tiger shrimp. In the present study, we cloned E2F-2 gene from black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon). Full-length PmE2F-2 complementary DNA sequence measures 3,189 bp with an open reading frame of 1,371 bp. Complete PmE2F-2 genomic sequence (17,305 bp) of P. monodon contains nine exons, which are separated by eight introns. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis indicated that PmE2F-2 is highly expressed in hepatopancreas and ovaries of P. monodon. Highest PmE2F-2 expression levels were observed in stage III ovarian development of P. monodon. PmE2F-2 expression levels were significantly augmented in ovaries of P. monodon after 5-hydroxytryptamine injection and eyestalk ablation. RNA interference experiments were conducted to examine PmE2F-2, PmCDK2, and PmCyclin E expression profiles. PmE2F-2 was successfully knocked down in ovaries and hepatopancreas via double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-E2F-2 injection. In the same organs, PmE2F-2 expression localization and level were investigated through in situ hybridization, which revealed consistent results with those of qRT-PCR. After dsRNA-E2F-2 injection, gonadosomatic index of shrimp was significantly lower than those following dsRNA-GFP and phosphate-buffered solution injections. Therefore, PmE2F-2 may be involved in ovarian maturation in P. monodon."

A well-established in vitro cell model is required to determine the therapeutic mechanism of BPH inflammation. In this study, we attempted to establish an immortalized human prostate stromal cell line by transfecting with HPV-16 E6/E7 and designated as ihPSC. No significant difference was found in fibroblast-like morphology between primary hPSC and ihPSC. The ihPSC possessed a significantly higher cell proliferation rate than primary hPSC. The prostate-specific markers and proteins including cytoskeleton (α-SMA and vimentin) and smooth muscle (calponin), especially the androgen receptor (AR) were also examined in ihPSC, almost identical to the primary hPSC. To create an in vitro model featuring chronic prostatic inflammation, ihPSC was stimulated with IFN-γ+IL-17 and then treated with the high molecular weight hyaluronic acid hylan G-F 20 as an alternative strategy for inhibiting BPH inflammation. Hylan G-F 20 could dose-dependently diminish the inflammation-induced proliferation in ihPSC. The enhanced expressions of inflammatory molecules including IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), inducible nitrogen oxide synthase (iNOS), and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) were all abolished by hylan G-F 20. For inflammatory signaling, hylan G-F 20 can also diminish the IFN-γ+IL-17-increased expression of iNOS and p65 in ihPSC. These findings suggest that ihPSC could provide a mechanism-based platform for investigating prostate inflammation. The hylan G-F 20 showed strong anti-inflammatory effects by decreasing inflammatory cytokines and signalings in the ihPSC, indicating its therapeutic potentials in BPH treatment in the future."

Here we report a significant difference in PI3K/Akt-dependent apoptosis between B virus infected human and macaque dermal fibroblasts. Our data show that B virus infection in either human or macaque fibroblasts results in activation of Akt via PI3K and this activation does not require viral de novo protein synthesis. Inhibition of PI3K with LY294002 results in a significant reduction of viral titers in B virus infected macaque and human fibroblasts with only a modest difference in the reduction of virus titers between the two cell types. We, therefore, tested the hypothesis that B virus results in the phosphorylation of Akt (S473), which prevents apoptosis, enhancing virus replication in B virus infected macaque dermal fibroblasts. We observed markers of intrinsic apoptosis when PI3K activation of Akt was inhibited in B virus infected macaque cells, while, these apoptotic markers were absent in B virus infected human fibroblasts under the same conditions. From these data we suggest that PI3K activates Akt in B virus infected macaque and human fibroblasts, but this enhances virus replication in macaque fibroblast cells by blocking apoptosis."

Patients were randomized into two groups: group 1 included patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and ABMMC transplantation (n = 28); group 2 comprised patients treated only with PCI (n = 34). Follow-up study was performed 7.96 ± 0.96 years after STEMI and involved physical examination, six-minute walk test, echocardiography, and determination of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels. The total and cardiovascular mortality rates were higher in group 1 compared with group 2: 36% (n = 10) vs. 12% (n = 4) (p = 0.02) and 29% (n = 8) vs. 6% (n = 2) (p = 0.03), respectively. Lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines were observed in group 1 after PCI and ABMMC transplantation. Serum levels of FGF, VEGF, and IL-10, determined before PCI and ABMMC transplantation were prognostically significant long-term indicators of unfavorable course of CAD after STEMI."
https://openalex.org/W2620119533,"We investigated the use of vocalizations called ""grunts,"" ""girneys,"" and ""coos"" accompanied by post-conflict affiliative interaction between former opponents (reconciliation) in Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata). Although reconciliation functions to repair bonds, such interactions sometimes entail risks of receiving further aggression. Vocalizations can be used at a distance from the former opponent; thus, we predict that vocalizations are used particularly by victims of a conflict, and are frequently used in situations of uncertainty when it is difficult for them to estimate whether the former opponent will resume aggression. In addition, we predict that vocalizations are effective in preventing further aggression. To test these hypotheses, we conducted observations of post-conflict and matched-control situations in female Japanese macaques living in a free-ranging group. We found that former opponents tended to be attracted to each other within the first minute following a conflict, thus demonstrating reconciliation behavior. Vocalizations were more frequently used by the victims in post-conflict interactions than under control situations; however, this tendency was not found in aggressors. When affiliation with the former opponent occurred, victims were more likely to use vocalizations towards less familiar opponents. These findings suggest that Japanese macaques used vocalizations more often when interacting with less predictable former opponents. Victims were more likely to receive aggression from former aggressors when engaged in affiliations with them than under no such affiliations. No significant differences were found in the probability of the victims receiving aggression, regardless of whether they used vocalizations; thus, whether the victim benefits from using vocalizations in these contexts remains unclear. Japanese macaques form despotic societies and therefore, further aggression was inevitable, to some degree, after a conflict. The use of vocalizations by a victim was found to depend on the nature of their relationship with the aggressor; however, the effectiveness of this behavior requires further investigation."
