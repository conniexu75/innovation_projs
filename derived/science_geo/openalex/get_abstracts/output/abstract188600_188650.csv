https://openalex.org/W2098115340,"Over 225,000 independent Agrobacterium transferred DNA (T-DNA) insertion events in the genome of the reference plant Arabidopsis thaliana have been created that represent near saturation of the gene space. The precise locations were determined for more than 88,000 T-DNA insertions, which resulted in the identification of mutations in more than 21,700 of the approximately 29,454 predicted Arabidopsis genes. Genome-wide analysis of the distribution of integration events revealed the existence of a large integration site bias at both the chromosome and gene levels. Insertion mutations were identified in genes that are regulated in response to the plant hormone ethylene."
https://openalex.org/W2057606871,"Plant microRNAs (miRNAs) show a high degree of sequence complementarity to, and are believed to guide the cleavage of, their target messenger RNAs. Here, Ishow that miRNA172, which can base-pair with the messenger RNA of a floral homeotic gene, APETALA2 , regulates APETALA2 expression primarily through translational inhibition. Elevated miRNA172 accumulation results in floral organ identity defects similar to those in loss-of-function apetala2 mutants. Elevated levels of mutant APETALA2 RNA with disrupted miRNA172 base pairing, but not wild-type APETALA2 RNA, result in elevated levels of APETALA2 protein and severe floral patterning defects. Therefore, miRNA172 likely acts in cell-fate specification as a translational repressor of APETALA2 in Arabidopsis flower development."
https://openalex.org/W2099384461,"Membrane transport proteins that transduce free energy stored in electrochemical ion gradients into a concentration gradient are a major class of membrane proteins. We report the crystal structure at 3.5 angstroms of the Escherichia coli lactose permease, an intensively studied member of the major facilitator superfamily of transporters. The molecule is composed of N- and C-terminal domains, each with six transmembrane helices, symmetrically positioned within the permease. A large internal hydrophilic cavity open to the cytoplasmic side represents the inward-facing conformation of the transporter. The structure with a bound lactose homolog, beta-D-galactopyranosyl-1-thio-beta-D-galactopyranoside, reveals the sugar-binding site in the cavity, and residues that play major roles in substrate recognition and proton translocation are identified. We propose a possible mechanism for lactose/proton symport (co-transport) consistent with both the structure and a large body of experimental data."
https://openalex.org/W2164365774,"The completion of the genome sequence for Plasmodium falciparum , the species responsible for most malaria human deaths, has the potential to reveal hundreds of new drug targets and proteins involved in pathogenesis. However, only ∼35% of the genes code for proteins with an identifiable function. The absence of routine genetic tools for studying Plasmodium parasites suggests that this number is unlikely to change quickly if conventional serial methods are used to characterize encoded proteins. Here, we use a high-density oligonucleotide array to generate expression profiles of human and mosquito stages of the malaria parasite's life cycle. Genes with highly correlated levels and temporal patterns of expression were often involved in similar functions or cellular processes."
https://openalex.org/W2147241123,"The major facilitator superfamily represents the largest group of secondary membrane transporters in the cell. Here we report the 3.3 angstrom resolution structure of a member of this superfamily, GlpT, which transports glycerol-3-phosphate into the cytoplasm and inorganic phosphate into the periplasm. The amino- and carboxyl-terminal halves of the protein exhibit a pseudo two-fold symmetry. Closed off to the periplasm, a centrally located substrate-translocation pore contains two arginines at its closed end, which comprise the substrate-binding site. Upon substrate binding, the protein adopts a more compact conformation. We propose that GlpT operates by a single-binding site, alternating-access mechanism through a rocker-switch type of movement."
https://openalex.org/W2091750259,"We removed ∼100% of clathrated oxygen ions from the crystallographic cages in a single crystal of 12CaO·7Al 2 O 3 , leading to the formation of high-density (∼2 × 10 21 cm – 3 ) electrons highly localized in the cages. The resulting electron forms a structure that we interpret as an F + center and migrates throughout the crystal by hopping to a neighboring cage with conductivity ∼100 siemens per centimeter, demonstrating that the encaged electron behaves as an anion. The electron anions couple antiferromagnetically with each other, forming a diamagnetic pair or singlet bipolaron. The resulting [Ca 24 Al 28 O 64 ] 4 + (4 e – ) may be regarded as a thermally and chemically stable single crystalline “electride.”"

Here, we explain this method for modeling fluid turbulence and show its effectiveness with the use of a computationally efficient implementation in terms of a discrete or ""lattice"" Boltzmann equation."
https://openalex.org/W1981047946,"We use an empirical statistical model to demonstrate significant skill in making extended-range forecasts of the monthly-mean Arctic Oscillation (AO). Forecast skill derives from persistent circulation anomalies in the lowermost stratosphere and is greatest during boreal winter. A comparison to the Southern Hemisphere provides evidence that both the time scale and predictability of the AO depend on the presence of persistent circulation anomalies just above the tropopause. These circulation anomalies most likely affect the troposphere through changes to waves in the upper troposphere, which induce surface pressure changes that correspond to the AO."
https://openalex.org/W2125497089,"The multilineage differentiation potential of adult tissue-derived mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs), such as those from bone marrow and trabecular bone, makes them a useful model to investigate mechanisms regulating tissue development and regeneration, such as cartilage. Treatment with transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily members is a key requirement for the in vitro chondrogenic differentiation of MPCs. Intracellular signaling cascades, particularly those involving the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, p38, ERK-1, and JNK, have been shown to be activated by TGF-βs in promoting cartilage-specific gene expression. MPC chondrogenesis in vitro also requires high cell seeding density, reminiscent of the cellular condensation requirements for embryonic mesenchymal chondrogenesis, suggesting common chondro-regulatory mechanisms. Prompted by recent findings of the crucial role of the cell adhesion protein, N-cadherin, and Wnt signaling in condensation and chondrogenesis, we have examined here their involvement, as well as MAP kinase signaling, in TGF-β1-induced chondrogenesis of trabecular bone-derived MPCs. Our results showed that TGF-β1 treatment initiates and maintains chondrogenesis of MPCs through the differential chondro-stimulatory activities of p38, ERK-1, and to a lesser extent, JNK. This regulation of MPC chondrogenic differentiation by the MAP kinases involves the modulation of N-cadherin expression levels, thereby likely controlling condensation-like cell-cell interaction and progression to chondrogenic differentiation, by the sequential up-regulation and progressive down-regulation of N-cadherin. TGF-β1-mediated MAP kinase activation also controls WNT-7A gene expression and Wnt-mediated signaling through the intracellular β-catenin-TCF pathway, which likely regulates N-cadherin expression and subsequent N-cadherin-mediated cell-adhesion complexes during the early steps of MPC chondrogenesis.

We have also developed improved techniques for the isolation and culture of MPCs from trabecular bone to yield clinically significant numbers of such cells (15Tuli R. Seghatoleslami M.R. Tuli S.

That these cells retain their multilineage differentiation potential through long term culture expansion suggests they are a suitable cell source for potential therapeutic and clinical treatment at least in osteogenic, adipogenic, and chondrogenic applications. The in vitro chondrogenic differentiation of MPCs requires the complex involvement of growth factors and cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, similar to developmental chondrogenesis in vivo (16DeLise A.M. Fischer L. Tuan R.S. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2000; 8: 309-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Expression of members of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily of growth factors has been localized to sites of bone repair as well as sites of embryonic bone and cartilage formation in vivo (17Horner A.

Recent reports have demonstrated the critical roles of intracellular signaling cascades activated by TGF-β family members in promoting cartilage-specific gene expression (25Watanabe H. de Caestecker M.P. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14466-14473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 26Tuli R. Seghatoleslami M.R. Tuli S. Howard M.S. Danielson K.G. Tuan R.S. Ann. N.

Cell Res. 1999; 250: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), including the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, whose major subtypes include p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1 (ERK-1), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK or stress-activated protein kinase). These major subtypes are activated by a variety of stimuli, and often are differentially regulated by a single stimulus. The roles of the specific MAP kinase subtypes, p38 and ERK-1, in regulating chondrogenesis were elucidated to some degree by Oh et al. (28Oh C.D. Chang S.H. Yoon Y.M. Lee S.J. Lee Y.S. Kang S.S. Chun J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5613-5619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) who found that p38 and ERK-1 have opposing roles during the chondrogenic induction of chick limb bud cells. Specifically, p38 was an enhancer of chondrogenesis, whereas ERK-1 was a repressor of chondrogenesis, and control was exerted, at least in part, through the regulation of cell adhesion molecules, including N-cadherin, fibronectin, and its receptor α5β1 integrin, during cellular condensation. Precartilage mesenchymal condensation, a requisite for the initiation of chondrogenesis in vivo, has been shown to be equally important in in vitro cultures (29DeLise A.M. Tuan R.S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 87: 342-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 30Delise A.M. Tuan R.S. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 225: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 31Haas A.R. Tuan R.S. Differentiation. 1999; 64: 77-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The spatiotemporal expression pattern of the Ca2+-dependent, homotypic cell adhesion molecule N-cadherin parallels its functional requirement for the initiation and subsequent progression of developmental chondrogenesis (32Oberlender S.A. Tuan R.S. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1994; 2: 521-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 33Oberlender S.A. Tuan R.S. Development. 1994; 120: 177-187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a transmembrane glycoprotein, N-cadherin is composed of extracellular domains that mediate homophilic interactions between neighboring cells, predominantly via a peptide domain containing the His-Ala-Val (HAV) amino acid sequence, located near the N terminus of the protein within the interface of two molecules and shown to be critical for N-cadherin-mediated cell adhesion (34Blaschuk O.W. Sullivan R. David S. Pouliot Y. Dev. Biol. 1990; 139: 227-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Additionally, the cytoplasmic domain of N-cadherin is anchored to the intracellular actin cytoskeleton through interactions with the α-, β-, and γ-catenin complex. Besides its functional role, cytoplasmic β-catenin has also been found to interact with other proteins such as glycogen synthase kinase-3β, adenomatous polyposis coli, the scaffolding components, axin and conductin, as well as the transcriptional regulators, lymphoid enhancing factor-1 (LEF-1)/T-cell factor (TCF), all of which play critical roles in the canonical Wnt signal transduction pathway (35Behrens J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 911-919Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), recently implicated in regulating chondrocyte differentiation. Wnts are a family of secreted glycoproteins that act in a paracrine fashion, thereby mediating cellular interactions during development (35Behrens J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 911-919Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2228) Google Scholar). Briefly, Wnt signaling proteins act by binding to Frizzled receptors, the activation of which leads to the stabilization of cytosolic β-catenin. Interaction of β-catenin with the high mobility group box transcription factors of the LEF-1/TCF family allows translocation of the complex into the nucleus to subsequently regulate the transcription of Wnt target genes (37Behrens J. von Kries J.P. Kuhl M. Bruhn L. Wedlich D. Grosschedl R. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 382: 638-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (2595) Google Scholar). A number of WNT genes are expressed during development, including WNT3A (38Kengaku M. Capdevila J. Rodriguez-Esteban C. De La Pena J. Johnson R.L. Belmonte J.C. Tabin C.J. Science. 1998; 280: 1274-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) localized in mouse apical ectodermal ridge, WNT4 localized in developing joints (39Kawakami Y. Wada N. Nishimatsu S.I. Ishikawa T. Noji S. Nohno T. Dev. Growth Differ. 1999; 41: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), WNT5A localized in distal mesenchyme (40Parr B.A. Shea M.J. Vassileva G. McMahon A.P. Development. 1993; 119: 247-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and WNT7A in dorsal ectoderm (41Parr B.A. McMahon A.P. Nature. 1995; 374: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Wnt-7a has been shown to be chondro-inhibitory in vitro (42Rudnicki J.A. Brown A.M. Dev. Biol. 1997; 185: 104-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), and recently the misexpression of WNT7A in limb mesenchymal chondrogenic cultures directly led to the prolonged expression of N-cadherin, the stabilization of N-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion, and the eventual inhibition of chondrogenesis (43Tufan A.C. Tuan R.S. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1436-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 44Tufan A.C. Daumer K.M. DeLise A.M. Tuan R.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 273: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The involvement of Wnt signaling has also been shown in the BMP-2 mediated chondrogenic effect on the mouse C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal cell line (45Fischer L. Boland G. Tuan R.S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 84: 816-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 46Fischer L. Boland G. Tuan R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30870-30878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Recent evidence has increasingly suggested that signaling cascades and pathways act in an interconnected manner within the cell. Here we attempt to define the early cellular processes and cross-regulatory signaling events that take place during mesenchymal chondrogenesis, specifically in adult tissue-derived, multipotential MPCs. A recent report (47Ishitani T. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Nagai S. Nishita M. Meneghini M. Barker N. Waterman M. Bowerman B. Clevers H. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 399: 798-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) described the cross-regulation and subsequent inhibition of the Wnt signaling pathway by MAPKKK and the downstream MAP kinase, NLK. Here we report that TGF-β1-stimulated chondrogenesis of trabecular bone-derived MPCs initiates intracellular signaling via activation of the chondro-stimulatory MAP kinases, p38, ERK-1, and JNK, which differentially regulate cartilage-specific gene and protein expression in a lineage-specific manner. Additionally, our results suggest that mesenchymal cell condensation initiated by TGF-β1 within the pellet culture is mediated via N-cadherin and is critical for the progression of chondrogenesis, similar to developmental chondrogenesis in vivo. Moreover, N-cadherin expression appeared to be regulated at the cellular condensation phase by the tight control of WNT7A gene expression individually by the p38, ERK-1, and JNK MAP kinases. Reagents—All reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Isolation and Culture of Human Trabecular Bone-derived Cells— Normal human trabecular bone was obtained from the femoral heads of patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty and processed using a high efficiency and high yield protocol established previously in our laboratory (15Tuli R. Seghatoleslami M.R. Tuli S. Wang M.L. Hozack W.J. Manner P.A. Danielson K.G. Tuan R.S. Mol. Biotechnol. 2003; 23: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Thomas Jefferson University and George Washington University. Processed trabecular bone fragments were subsequently cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose and l-glutamine; Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Premium Select, Atlanta Biologicals, Atlanta, GA), from selected lots (48Caterson E.J. Nesti L.J. Danielson K.G. Tuan R.S. Mol. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), and 50 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Subconfluent cell monolayers were dissociated and removed using 0.25% trypsin containing 1 mm EDTA (Invitrogen) and either passaged at a ratio of 1:3 or utilized for study. In Vitro Chondrogenic Differentiation of MPCs—The chondrogenic induction of trabecular bone-derived MPCs was initiated using high density pellet cultures (2 × 105 cells/pellet, 500 × g for 5 min) in a chemically defined medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml ascorbate, 0.1 μm dexamethasone, 40 μg/ml l-proline, 100 μg/ml sodium pyruvate, and ITS-plus (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Cambridge, MA) (4Pittenger M.F.

Recombinant human transforming growth factor-β1 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was added to the pellet cultures at a final concentration of 10 ng/ml. For MAP kinase inhibition studies, specific chemical inhibitors of p38 (SB20350), ERK-1-specific MAP kinase kinase (MEK1) inhibitor (PD98059), and JNK (SP600125, Calbiochem-Novabiochem) were used at final concentrations of 5, 10, and 100 nm, respectively, representing concentrations well within the range of IC50 values determined for similar cell types. Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR Analysis—Total cellular RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Chondrogenic pellet cultures were first briefly homogenized in Trizol reagent to increase yield efficiency. Equal amounts of RNA samples were reverse-transcribed by using random hexamers and the SuperScript First Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). PCR amplification of cDNA was carried out using AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and the gene-specific primer sets listed in Table I.

Open table in a new tab Reporter Gene Assays—Human trabecular bone-derived MPCs were harvested at 60–80% confluence for electroporation using the Human Mesenchymal Stem Cell Nucleofector kit (Amaxa Biosystems, Cologne, Germany) according to a modified protocol established in our laboratory for the efficient transfection of human MPCs. 2H. Haleem-Smith, A. Derfoul, C. Okafor, R. Tuli, D. Olsen, D. J. Hall, and R. S. Tuan, manuscript in preparation. Promoter reporter constructs include the following: 1) TOPFLASH, containing multimeric TCF-binding sites (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions, Waltham, MA); 2) FOPFLASH, containing multimeric mutated TCF-binding sites (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions, Waltham, MA); 3) a pGL3 basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI) containing 4.0 kb of the 5′-flanking sequences of the human collagen type II α1 procollagen (COL2A1, –577/+3428) gene, which encompasses the promoter, exon 1, and the putative enhancer sequence in the first intron, linked to a luciferase reporter (a kind gift from Dr. M. Goldring); and 4) a plasmid pAGC1(–2368)/5′-UTR containing 2368 bp of the human aggrecan promoter region along with the entire exon 1 and 5′-UTR, linked to a luciferase reporter (a kind gift from Dr. W. B. Valhmu). Luciferase activity was determined using the Luciferase Assay System kit (Promega, Madison, WI). A green fluorescent protein expression vector under the control of the SV40 promoter (pCMS-EGFP; Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was used to normalize transfection efficiencies. Results were analyzed using Student's t test, p ≤ 0.05. Protein Isolation and Western Analysis—Cell pellets were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), lysed with immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) and protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixture, incubated on ice for 30 min, homogenized, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was collected, and protein concentrations were determined by using the BCA assay (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein extracts were fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE, electroblotted onto Hybond-P membrane (Amersham Biosciences), probed with antibodies to p38, P-p38, ERK1, P-ERK1/2, JNK1, P-JNK, N-cadherin, β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and β-catenin (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), immunoblotted using the ECF Western blotting kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences), and visualized using the Typhoon 9410 Imager (Amersham Biosciences). Metabolic Sulfate Incorporation—Chondrogenic pellet cultures received 1.0 μCi/ml sodium [35S]sulfate and 1.0 μCi/ml [3H]leucine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) 24 h prior to the time point chosen for measurement of newly synthesized proteoglycans and protein, respectively. Incorporation of radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting (51San Antonio J.D. Tuan R.S. Dev. Biol. 1986; 115: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and statistically analyzed by using Student's t test (p ≤ 0.05). Histological and Immunohistochemical Analysis—Cell pellet cultures, rinsed twice with PBS, were fixed for 2 h in 2% PBS-buffered paraformaldehyde, dehydrated through a graded ethanol series, infiltrated with isoamyl alcohol, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 8 μm thickness for analysis. Histological staining with Alcian blue (pH 1.0) or hematoxylin and eosin was performed as described previously (20Denker A.E. Haas A.R. Nicoll S.B. Tuan R.S. Differentiation. 1999; 64: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 31Haas A.R. Tuan R.S. Differentiation. 1999; 64: 77-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical localization of collagen type II (II-II6B3, 15 μg/ml) and aggrecan (1-C-6, 10 μg/ml, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA) was performed by pre-digesting sections with 300 units/ml hyaluronidase or 1.5 units/ml chondroitinase for 15 min at 37 °C, respectively. Colorimetric detection of staining was performed using Histostain-SP kit for DAB (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA). Cell pellets treated with the N-cadherin antibody, A-CAM (see below), were fixed in 2% PBS-buffered paraformaldehyde and stained directly using Alcian blue, pH 1.0. Inhibition of N-cadherin-mediated Cell Adhesion—A monoclonal antibody to N-cadherin, anti-A cell adhesion molecule (A-CAM, Sigma), was used to functionally inhibit homotypic interactions between N-cadherin molecules during precartilage condensation. Trabecular bone-derived MPCs were prepared for pellet culture as described above, and A-CAM was added as a single dose at the beginning of culture at concentrations varying from 0 to 240 μg/ml. A nonspecific mouse antibody was used as a negative control. Chondrogenesis was assayed at day 3 using the pAGC1(–2368)/5′-UTR promoter reporter construct, and at day 21 by Alcian blue staining, as described above. Activation of MAP Kinase Subtypes, p38, ERK-1, and JNK, upon TGF-β1 Stimulation—Trabecular bone-derived cell pellets treated with and without TGF-β1 were assayed for MAP kinase activities and kinetics of activation. The addition of TGF-β1 led to the rapid transient phosphorylation of p38, ERK-1, and JNK, as determined by Western analysis (Fig. 1). Phosphorylated p38 (P-p38) levels increased dramatically at 0.5 h, peaked at 1 h, and returned to basal levels by 2 h, remaining constant through day 5 of chondrogenic culture. This transient increase in protein levels upon TGF-β1 treatment was kinetically mimicked by phosphorylated ERK-1 (P-ERK-1), the major ERK isoform, as well as phosphorylated JNK (P-JNK), which similarly increased at 0.5 h relative to time 0 h, peaked at 1 h, and returned to basal levels by 2 h. Unlike P-p38, however, P-ERK protein levels peaked again at day 3, and P-JNK levels peaked again at day 1 as chondrogenesis proceeded. Reprobing the same blots with antibodies against the unphosphorylated forms of p38, ERK-1, and JNK MAP kinases revealed no change in total p38, ERK-1, or JNK levels, respectively, during the chondrogenic culture period. Activations of p38, ERK-1, and JNK were absent in untreated control pellet cultures (data not shown). p38, ERK-1, and JNK MAP Kinases Differentially Regulate Chondrogenesis-associated Activities Stimulated by TGF-β1— RT-PCR analysis of MPC pellets maintained in TGF-β1-supplemented chondrogenic medium for 21 days showed significant up-regulation of cartilage-specific gene expression (Fig. 2C), as compared with the untreated control (Fig. 2A). The addition of 5 μm p38 specific inhibitor (SB203580), 10 μm MEK-1 inhibitor (PD98059), or 100 nm JNK-specific chemical inhibitor (SP600125), to TGF-β1-treated pellet cultures led to the lineage-specific down-regulation or complete abrogation of chondrogenic gene expression levels (Fig. 2D). Inhibition of p38 with SB203580 completely abrogated TGF-β1-induced collagen type II (COL2A1) and SOX9 gene expression, with significant down-regulation of aggrecan expression, and reduction of collagen type X (COL10), dermatopontin, and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF I) expression. Relative to the housekeeping gene, GAPDH, collagen type IX (COL9) and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) expression levels were unaffected by addition of the p38 inhibitor. ERK inhibition with PD98059 also completely inhibited the TGF-β1-induced gene expression of aggrecan, as well as collagen types II and IX and SOX9. Down-regulated expression of collagen type X, dermatopontin, and IGF I was also seen, whereas similar to the p38 inhibited cultures, mRNA levels of GAPDH and COMP remained unaltered. Finally, JNK inhibition with SP600125 abolished TGF-β1-induced collagen typ"
https://openalex.org/W2036809593,"We have recently shown that oral consumption of green tea polyphenols inhibits prostate carcinogenesis in transgenic mouse model of prostate cancer and suggested that induction of apoptosis in prostate cancer cells is responsible for these effects. Much of the chemopreventive effects of green tea are attributed to its major polyphenolic constituent (-) epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG). In the present study, we report that EGCG-induced apoptosis in human prostate carcinoma LNCaP cells is mediated via modulation of two related pathways: (a) stabilization of p53 by phosphorylation on critical serine residues and p14ARF-mediated downregulation of murine double minute 2(MDM2) protein, and (b) negative regulation of NF-kappaB activity, thereby decreasing the expression of the proapoptotic protein Bcl-2. EGCG-induced stabilization of p53 caused an upregulation in its transcriptional activity, thereby resulting in activation of its downstream targets p21/WAF1 and Bax. Thus, EGCG had a concurrent effect on two important transcription factors p53 and NF-kappaB, causing a change in the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 in a manner that favors apoptosis. This altered expression of Bcl-2 family members triggered the activation of initiator capsases 9 and 8 followed by activation of effector caspase 3. Activation of the caspases was followed by poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and induction of apoptosis. Taken together, the data indicate that EGCG induces apoptosis in human prostate carcinoma cells by shifting the balance between pro- and antiapoptotic proteins in favor of apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2073966710,"Observed mutation rates in humans appear higher in male than female gametes and often increase with paternal age. This bias, usually attributed to the accumulation of replication errors or inefficient repair processes, has been difficult to study directly. Here, we describe a sensitive method to quantify substitutions at nucleotide 755 of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) gene in sperm. Although substitution levels increase with age, we show that even high levels originate from infrequent mutational events. We propose that these FGFR2 mutations, although harmful to embryonic development, are paradoxically enriched because they confer a selective advantage to the spermatogonial cells in which they arise."

These observations suggest that, over time scales up to at least 1 million years, spatial variations of seismogenic behavior within a given subduction zone are stationary and linked to the geological structure of the fore-arc. The correlations we observe are consistent with a model in which spatial variations in frictional properties on the plate interface control trench-parellel variations in fore-arc topography, gravity, and seismogenic behavior."

https://openalex.org/W2045449473,"In many animals, establishment of the germ line depends on segregation of a specialized cytoplasm, or ‘germ plasm’, to a small number of germline precursor cells during early embryogenesis1. Germ plasm asymmetry involves targeting of RNAs and proteins to a specific region of the oocyte and/or embryo2. Here we demonstrate that germ plasm asymmetry also depends on degradation of germline proteins in non-germline (somatic) cells. We show that five CCCH finger proteins, components of the Caenorhabditis elegans germ plasm, are targeted for degradation by the novel CCCH-finger-binding protein ZIF-1. ZIF-1 is a SOCS-box protein that interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase subunit elongin C. Elongin C, the cullin CUL-2, the ring finger protein RBX-1 and the E2 ubiquitin conjugation enzyme UBC5 (also known as LET-70) are all required in vivo for CCCH finger protein degradation. Degradation is activated in somatic cells by the redundant CCCH finger proteins MEX-5 and MEX-6, which are counteracted in the germ line by the PAR-1 kinase. We propose that segregation of the germ plasm involves both stabilization of germline proteins in the germ line and cullin-dependent degradation in the soma."
https://openalex.org/W2115747531,"Auxin is a plant hormone that regulates many aspects of plant growth and development. We used a chemical genetics approach to identify SIR1 , a regulator of many auxin-inducible genes. The sir1 mutant was resistant to sirtinol, a small molecule that activates many auxin-inducible genes and promotes auxin-related developmental phenotypes. SIR1 is predicted to encode a protein composed of a ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1–like domain and a Rhodanese-like domain homologous to that of prolyl isomerase. We suggest a molecular context for how the auxin signal is propagated to exert its biological effects."
https://openalex.org/W1664511950,"Axonal voltage-gated potassium (Kv1) channels regulate action-potential invasion and hence transmitter release. Although evolutionarily conserved, what mediates their axonal targeting is not known. We found that Kv1 axonal targeting required its T1 tetramerization domain. When fused to unpolarized CD4 or dendritic transferrin receptor, T1 promoted their axonal surface expression. Moreover, T1 mutations eliminating Kvbeta association compromised axonal targeting, but not surface expression, of CD4-T1 fusion proteins. Thus, proper association of Kvbeta with the Kv1 T1 domain is essential for axonal targeting."

https://openalex.org/W2056028911,"Electrochemical control of the oxidation state of ferrocene-decorated electrodes leads to surface-driven changes in the orientations of thermotropic liquid crystals. When the electrodes possess nanometer-scale topography, voltages of 0.0 to 0.3 volts (versus a counter electrode in a two-electrode cell) can drive changes in the orientation of the liquid crystals in the plane and/or out of the plane of the electrodes. Electrodes not supporting ferrocene do not lead to surface-driven orientational transitions. The in-plane transitions are driven by the reorganization of the monolayer of ferrocene upon oxidation of ferrocene to ferrocenium. The out-of-plane transition reflects a dielectric coupling between the liquid crystal and the diffuse part of an electrical double layer that evolves upon oxidation of ferrocene to ferrocenium. These results suggest new ways to couple the orientations of liquid crystals to chemical and electrical stimuli in electro-optical devices and chemical sensors."

Kinase Assays—Purified GPx1(Sec-47 → Cys) or GPx1(Sec-47 → Cys/Tyr-96 → Phe) expressed in E. coli (2 μg) was incubated with immunoprecipitated FLAG-c-Abl or FLAG-Arg in kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 75 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2,10mm MnCl2) containing 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Measurement of GPx Activity—Cell lysates were assayed with the GPx cellular assay kit (Sigma) at 25 °C and pH 8.0 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Apoptosis Assays—DNA content was assessed by staining ethanol-fixed and citrate buffer-permeabilized cells with propidium iodide and monitoring by FACScan (BD Biosciences). The numbers of cells with sub-G1 DNA content were determined with a MODFIT LT program (5Cao C. Ren X. Kharbanda S. Koleske A.J. Prasad K. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11465-11468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). c-Abl and Arg Associate with Glutathione Peroxidase—Studies using the yeast two-hybrid system demonstrated that c-Abl associates with a 3′-terminal fragment of GPx1 containing amino acids 70–201 (data not shown). In this Matchmaker Gal4 cDNA library (Clontech), the full-length cDNA or a 3′-terminal fragment is fused to the activation domain of the Gal4 gene (Gal4AD). To determine whether c-Abl interacts with GPx1 in cells, lysates from 293 cells expressing Myc-c-Abl and FLAG-GPx1(Sec-47 → Cys) were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc. Immunoblot analysis of the precipitates with anti-FLAG demonstrated that c-Abl associates with GPx1 (Fig. 1A, lane 1). By contrast, GPx1 was undetectable in immunoprecipitates prepared with control IgG (Fig. 1A, lane 2). In the reciprocal experiment, anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates from cells expressing Exp-c-Abl and FLAG-GPx1(Sec-47 → Cys) were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Exp. The results confirmed an association between c-Abl and GPx1 (Fig. 1B, lane 1). Whereas c-Abl and GPx1 are effectors in the response to oxidative stress, similar experiments were performed after treatment with increasing concentrations of H2O2. Exposure to 0.16 mm H2O2 was associated with a decrease in c-Abl-GPx1 complexes (Fig. 1B, lane 2). Moreover, further decreases in the association between c-Abl and GPx1 were observed when cells were treated with 0.64 and 2.5 mm H2O2 (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4). As a control, there was no detectable c-Abl in the IgG immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1B, lanes 5–7). To determine whether Arg, like c-Abl, associates with GPx1, anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates from cells expressing Exp-Arg and FLAG-GPx1(Sec-47 → Cys) were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Exp. As found for c-Abl, Arg associates with GPx1 (Fig. 1C, lane 1). Treatment with increasing concentrations of H2O2 also resulted in decreases in Arg-GPx1 complexes (Fig. 1C, lanes 2–4). In addition, there was no detectable Arg in the control IgG immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1C, lanes 5–7). These findings demonstrate that c-Abl and Arg associate with GPx1 in cells. c-Abl and Arg SH3 Domains Confer Binding to GPx1—To further define the interaction between c-Abl and GPx1, lysates from 293 cells were incubated with GST or a GST-GPx1(Sec-47 → Cys) fusion protein. Immunoblot analysis of the adsorbates with anti-c-Abl demonstrated binding of c-Abl to GST-GPx1(Sec-47 → Cys) and not GST (Fig. 2A). To assess whether the interaction is direct, GST and GST-GPx1(Sec-47 → Cys) were incubated with 35S-labeled FLAG-c-Abl. Analysis of the adsorbates by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography showed binding of c-Abl to GST-GPx1(Sec-47 → Cys) and not to GST (Fig. 2B). c-Abl and Arg bind to other proteins through their SH3 and SH2 domains. To determine whether these domains are involved in the interaction between c-Abl/Arg and GPx1, 35S-labeled GPx1(Sec-47 → Cys) was incubated with GST fusion proteins containing the c-Abl/Arg SH3 or SH2 domains. Analysis of the adsorbates demonstrated that GPx1 binds to the c-Abl SH3 but not to the c-Abl SH2 domain (Fig. 2C). Binding of GPx1 was also detectable with the Arg SH3 but not the Arg SH2 domain (Fig. 2C). SH3 domains bind to proline-rich sites with a consensus PXXP motif. Whereas several prolines but not a consensus motif are present in GPx1 at amino acids 132–145 (PAPSDDATALMTDP), we generated GPx1(Sec-47 → Cys/Pro-132 → Ala) and GPx1(Sec-47 → Cys/Pro-145 → Ala) mutants. Another Pro → Ala mutation at position 99 was prepared as a control. Immunoblot analysis of lysates from cells expressing the GPx1 mutants demonstrated equal levels of protein (Fig. 2D, lanes 6–9). Incubation of the lysates with GST-c-Abl SH3 demonstrated binding of GPx1(Sec-47 → Cys) and the GPx1(Sec-47 → Cys/Pro-99 → Ala) mutant (Fig. 2D, lanes 1 and 2). By contrast, there was no detectable binding of GST-c-Abl SH3 to the GPx1(Sec-47 → Cys/Pro-132 → Ala) or GPx1-(Sec-47 → Cys/Pro-145 → Ala) mutants (Fig. 2D, lanes 3 and 4). Similar findings were obtained for binding of the Arg SH3 domain to GPx1(Sec-47 → Cys) (data not shown). These findings demonstrate that c-Abl and Arg bind to GPx1 through interactions between their SH3 domains and a proline-rich region in GPx1 that extends from amino acids 132 to 145. GPx1 Is Phosphorylated on Tyr-96 by c-Abl and Arg—To determine if GPx1 is a potential substrate for c-Abl in vivo, anti-GPx1 immunoprecipitates from SH-SY5Y cells were first subjected to immunoblotting with anti-c-Abl and anti-Tyr(P). As found previously (16Miller S. Walker S.W. Arthur J.R. Lewin M.H. Pickard K. Nicol F. Howie A.F. Beckett G.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1588: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 18Kim-Han J.S. Sun A.Y. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 512-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 19Weiss N. Zhang Y.Y. Heydrick S. Bierl C. Loscalzo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12503-12508Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), GPx1 was expressed at detectable levels in the absence of selenium supplementation (Fig. 3A). The results also demonstrate that endogenous c-Abl binds to GPx1 and that GPx1 is phosphorylated on tyrosine (Fig. 3A). To further assess tyrosine phosphorylation of GPx1, FLAG-GPx1(Sec-47 → Cys) was expressed with kinase-active c-Abl or the kinase-inactive c-Abl(K-R) mutant (Fig. 3B, left). Immunoblot analysis of anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates with anti-Tyr(P) demonstrated tyrosine phosphorylation of GPx1 by c-Abl and not c-Abl(K-R) (Fig. 3B, left). Tyrosine phosphorylation of GPx1 was also mediated by Arg, but not Arg(K-R) (Fig. 3B, left). In concert with these results, treatment with STI571 inhibited c-Abl- and Arg-mediated phosphorylation of GPx1 (Fig. 3B, right and data not shown). GPx1 contains a potential c-Abl/Arg phosphorylation site at amino acids 96–99 (YVRP). To determine whether that site is involved in c-Abl phosphorylation, GPx1(Sec-47 → Cys) and a GPx1(Sec-47 → Cys/Tyr-96 → Phe) mutant were incubated with FLAG-c-Abl in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Analysis of the reaction products demonstrated that c-Abl phosphorylation of GPx1 is abrogated by the Tyr-96 → Phe mutation (Fig. 3C). To determine whether the GPx1 Tyr-96 site is phosphorylated by c-Abl in vivo, anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates from cells expressing FLAG-GPx1(Sec-47 → Cys) or GPx1(Sec-47 → Cys/Tyr-96 → Phe) were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Tyr(P) (Fig. 3D). The results demonstrate that c-Abl-mediated phosphorylation of GPx1 in cells is abrogated by the Tyr-96 → Phe mutation (Fig. 3D). Arg-mediated phosphorylation of GPx1 was also undetectable with the GPx1(Sec-47 → Cys/Tyr-96 → Phe) mutant (Fig. 3D). These findings demonstrate that c-Abl and Arg phosphorylate GPx1 on Tyr-96 in vitro and in vivo. GPx Activity Is Regulated by c-Abl and Arg—To assess the effects of c-Abl on GPx activity, lysates from control and STI571-treated SH-SY5Y cells were assayed for the oxidation of GSH to GSSG. The finding that STI571 partially inhibits GPx activity indicated that c-Abl and Arg contribute to GPx activation (Fig. 4A). In concert with this observation, lysates from cells expressing c-Abl exhibited a substantial increase in GPx activity compared with control cells expressing the empty vector (Fig. 4B). By contrast, expression of c-Abl(K-R) was associated with a decrease in GPx activity (Fig. 4B). A decrease in GPx activity was also observed in cells deficient in c-Abl and Arg compared with that in wild-type cells (Fig. 4C). Catalase and GPx are major effectors in the cellular response to H2O2. To assess in part the contribution of GPx activity, cells were treated with 3AT, an irreversible inhibitor of catalase, and then exposed to H2O2. 3AT treatment alone had no apparent effect on apoptosis of wild-type or c-abl –/– arg –/– cells (Fig. 4D). Treatment with 3AT and H2O2, however, was associated with a low level of apoptosis in wild-type cells and a pronounced apoptotic response in the c-abl –/– arg –/– cells (Fig. 4D). These findings demonstrate that c-Abl and Arg stimulate GPx activity and that c-Abl/Arg contribute to GPx-mediated protection of cells against oxidative stress. Dual Roles for c-Abl and Arg in the Response to Oxidative Stress—The available evidence indicates that c-Abl and Arg are functionally important in the cellular response to oxidative stress. c-Abl and Arg are activated in cells treated with H2O2, and both are required for apoptosis in response to increased oxidant levels (4Sun X. Majumder P. Shioya H. Wu F. Kumar S. Weichselbaum R. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17237-17240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 5Cao C. Ren X. Kharbanda S. Koleske A.J. Prasad K. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11465-11468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). More recent work has demonstrated that treatment of cells with non-lethal concentrations of H2O2 induces the formation of c-Abl-Arg heterodimers (7Cao C. Leng Y. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12961-12967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Notably, higher concentrations of H2O2 that induce apoptosis are not effective in inducing the heterodimerization of c-Abl and Arg (7Cao C. Leng Y. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12961-12967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These findings have suggested that c-Abl and Arg may confer different functions that are dependent on the level of oxidative stress. Specifically, activation of c-Abl and Arg at non-lethal concentrations of H2O2 appears to play an antiapoptotic function in protecting cells against increased oxidant levels. Conversely, at lethal concentrations of H2O2, c-Abl and Arg function as pro-apoptotic effectors based on the demonstration that cells deficient in either kinase exhibit an attenuated apoptotic response (4Sun X.

Kharbanda S. Koleske A.J. Prasad K. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11465-11468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In concert with c-Abl and Arg playing dual roles in the oxidative stress response is the observation that cells deficient in both c-Abl and Arg exhibit substantial increases in intracellular oxidant levels compared with wild-type cells or those lacking only one of these kinases (20Cao C. Leng Y. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29667-29675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Regulation of GPx1 by c-Abl and Arg—The results of the present work demonstrate that c-Abl and Arg interact with GPx1, an important effector in regulating intracellular H2O2 levels. The findings show that c-Abl and Arg associate constitutively with GPx1 and that exposure of cells to lethal concentrations (>0.5 mm) of H2O2 disrupts these complexes. GPx1 also functions as a substrate for c-Abl and Arg. Other studies have demonstrated that bovine erythrocyte GPx is activated by incubation with the catalytic subunit of c-AMP-dependent protein kinase (21Kolesnichenko L.S. Lankin V.Z. Dokl. Akad. Nauk SSSR. 1986; 287: 735-737PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, epidermal growth factor receptor signaling is associated with activation of both c-Abl (22Plattner R. Kadlec L. DeMali K. Kazlauskas A. Pendergast A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2400-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) and GPx (23Duval C. Auge N. Frisach M.F. Casteilla L. Salvayre R. Negre-Salvayre A. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 889-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, c-Abl may function in transducing signals from activated growth factor receptors to GPx1. The functional significance of the interaction with c-Abl and Arg is supported by the demonstration that inhibition of these kinases with STI571 decreases GPx activity. Expression of kinase-active c-Abl increases GPx activity, whereas the dominant-negative c-Abl(K-R) has an inhibitory effect. Moreover, GPx activity is decreased in c-abl –/– arg –/– cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that c-Abl- or Arg-mediated phosphorylation of GPx1 increases its activity. The demonstration that complexes of GPx1 with c-Abl or Arg decrease upon exposure to lethal concentrations of H2O2 further indicates that regulation of GPx1 activity may be down-regulated once the cells have committed to undergo apoptosis. GPx1 Functions in the Apoptotic Response to Oxidative Stress—A role for GPx1 in protecting cells against oxidant-induced apoptosis is supported by the increased sensitivity of GPx1-deficient mice to H2O2 exposure (11de Haan J.B. Bladier C. Griffiths P. Kelner M. O'Shea R.D. Cheung N.S. Bronson R.T. Silvestro M.J. Wild S. Zheng S.S. Beart P.M. Hertzog P.J. Kola I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22528-22536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 12Ho Y.S. Magnenat J.L. Bronson R.T. Cao J. Gargano M. Sugawara M. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16644-16651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). The present results also support the regulation of GPx1 by c-Abl and Arg as being of potential importance to oxidant-induced apoptosis. In wild-type cells treated with 3AT to inhibit catalase, exposure to H2O2 was associated with the induction of a low level of apoptosis. By contrast, treatment of c-abl –/– arg –/– cells with 3AT and H2O2 was associated with a substantial increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells. These findings indicate that, in the absence of catalase, loss of GPx1 regulation by a deficiency of both c-Abl and Arg results in increased oxidant-induced apoptosis. High intracellular oxidant levels have been shown to directly disrupt mitochondrial function and thereby contribute to further increases in reactive oxygen species. Under these circumstances, the pro-apoptotic functions of c-Abl and Arg in response to oxidative stress would be dispensable as high oxidant levels can activate release of pro-apoptotic factors from mitochondria or induce necrosis.

https://openalex.org/W1973011134,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is known as a key regulator of angiogenesis during endochondral bone formation. Recently, we demonstrated that TNF-related activation-induced cytokine (TRANCE or RANKL), which is essential for bone remodeling, also had an angiogenic activity. Here we report that VEGF up-regulates expression of receptor activator of NF-κ B (RANK) and increases angiogenic responses of endothelial cells to TRANCE. Treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with VEGF increased both RANK mRNA and surface protein expression. Although placenta growth factor specific to VEGF receptor-1 had no significant effect on RANK expression, inhibition of downstream signaling molecules of the VEGF receptor-2 (Flk-1/KDR) such as Src, phospholipase C, protein kinase C, and phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase suppressed VEGF-stimulated RANK expression in HUVECs. Moreover, the MEK inhibitor PD98059 or expression of dominant negative MEK1 inhibited induction of RANK by VEGF but not the Ca2+ chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid-acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA-AM). VEGF potentiated TRANCE-induced ERK activation and tube formation via RANK up-regulation in HUVECs. Together, these results show that VEGF enhances RANK expression in endothelial cells through Flk-1/KDR-protein kinase C-ERK signaling pathway, suggesting that VEGF plays an important role in modulating the angiogenic action of TRANCE under physiological or pathological conditions.

Together, these results show that VEGF enhances RANK expression in endothelial cells through Flk-1/KDR-protein kinase C-ERK signaling pathway, suggesting that VEGF plays an important role in modulating the angiogenic action of TRANCE under physiological or pathological conditions. Angiogenesis, the development of new blood vessels from pre-existing endothelium, is a critical process in many physiological and pathological conditions including embryonic development, organ regeneration, chronic inflammation, and solid tumor growth (1Folkman J.

FASEB J. 1997; 11: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). In particular, angiogenesis is a crucial first step in endochondral ossification, the process whereby cartilage is replaced by bone, which is essential for the development of the long bones (3Harper J. Klagsbrun M. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 617-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These angiogenic processes are controlled by a wide variety of positive or negative regulators, which are composed of growth factors, cytokines, lipid metabolites, and cryptic fragments of hemostatic proteins (4Bussolino F. Mantovani A. Persico G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 251-256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Many studies have shown that various angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors are secreted by chondrocytes presented in the growth plate region (5Gerber H.P. Ferrara N. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar).

VEGF is highly expressed in chondrocytes in the lower hypertrophic and mineralized regions of the cartilage in developing embryonic bones (6Carlevaro M.F. Albini A. Cancedda R. Descalzi Cancedda F. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 59-69PubMed Google Scholar, 7Honer A. Bishop N.J. Bord S. Beeton C. Kesall N. Compston J.E. J. Anat. 1999; 194: 519-524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The functional significance of VEGF for bone formation was determined in animal studies. Administration of a soluble VEGF receptor chimeric protein in juvenile mice almost completely suppressed blood vessel invasion at the growth plate and inhibited endochondral bone formation (8Gerber H.P. Vu T.H. Ryan A.M. Kowalski J. Werb Z. Ferrara N. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1723) Google Scholar). Recently, studies using mice expressing exclusively the VEGF120 isoform (VEGF120/120 mice) have shown that loss of the VEGF164 and VEGF188 isoforms completely disturbed bone vascularization, and concomitantly resulted in a decreased trabecular bone volume and an abnormal growth plate morphology (9Maes C. Carmeliet P. Moermans K. Stocksmans I. Smets N. Collen D. Bouillon R. Carmeliet P. Mech. Dev. 2002; 111: 61-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in VEGF120/120 bones differentiation of osteoblasts and hypertrophic chondrocytes was significantly decreased and the initial invasion of osteoblasts and endothelial cells into the bones was retarded (9Maes C. Carmeliet P. Moermans K. Stocksmans I. Smets N. Collen D. Bouillon R. Carmeliet P. Mech. Dev. 2002; 111: 61-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). It is also reported that VEGF acts as a potent chemoattractant for cultured osteoblasts and stimulates the formation, survival, and resorption activity of osteoclasts in vitro (10Midy V. Plouet J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 380-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 11Nakagawa M. Kaneda T. Arakawa T. Morita S. Sato T. Yomada T. Hanada K. Kumegawa M. Hakeda Y.

Med. 1999; 190: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). New blood vessel formation is crucial for establishing the conduit that allows a variety of cells essential for bone morphogenesis such as chondroclasts, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts to migrate into the growth plate. To develop and maintain normal bone tissues, osteoblastic matrix deposition and osteoclastic resorption must be closely coordinated. A perturbation of this balance can result in skeletal abnormalities characterized by decreased (osteoporosis) or increased (osteopetrosis) bone mass. Osteoblasts/stromal cells have been suggested for their role in the regulation of osteoclast maturation and activation (13Roden G.A. Martin T.J. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1981; 33: 349-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). Recently, it was found that TNF-related activation-induced cytokine (TRANCE, also known as OPGL and RANKL) expressed on osteoblasts plays a key role in osteoclast differentiation from hematopoietic precursors and calcium metabolism (14Li J.

In a T cell-dependent model of rat adjuvant arthritis, TRANCE was also shown to be responsible for bone loss and cartilage destruction (16Kong Y.Y. Feige U. Sarosi I. Bolon B. Tafuri A. Morony S.

In a recent study, we have demonstrated that TRANCE has a novel action of promoting angiogenesis in vivo, and the binding of TRANCE to RANK expressed on endothelial cells directly stimulates proliferation, migration, and tube formation of endothelial cells in vitro (22Kim Y.M. Kim Y.M. Lee Y.M. Kim H.S. Kim J.D Choi Y. Kim K.W. Lee S.Y. Kwon Y.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6799-6805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Thus, these observations suggest that the TRANCE-RANK system may be important for the processes of osteoclastogenesis and vascularization of the growth plate during bone formation and remodeling. Because VEGF is the angiogenic factor most closely associated with induction of the neovasculature in bone and also involved in osteoclastogenesis, it is suggested that VEGF may be functionally related with the biological action of TRANCE. In this study, we investigate the potential role of VEGF in the regulation of the TRANCE receptor RANK expression. We here show that VEGF increases RANK expression in human endothelial cells, and such endothelial RANK up-regulation results in enhancing angiogenic activities of TRANCE in endothelial cells. Reagents and Chemicals—Soluble TRANCE (hCD8-conjugated form) was purified from insect cells as described previously (19Wong B.R. Rho J. Arron J. Robinson E. Orlinick J. Chao M. Kalachikov S.

Cell Culture—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were isolated from human umbilical cord veins by collagenase treatment as described previously (23Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. Becker C.G. Minick C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (6019) Google Scholar) and used in passages 2–7. The cells were grown in M199 medium supplemented with 20% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 3 ng/ml bFGF, and 5 units/ml heparin. The immortalized human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) (24Ades E.W. Candal F.J. Swerlick R.A. George V.G. Summers S. Bosse D.C. Lawley T.J. J. Invest.

Retroviral Vectors and Generation of Stable Transfectants—Dominant-negative MEK1 (DN-MEK1) and p85 (Δp85) have been characterized (25Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S.

The cDNA sequences encoding of hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged DN-MEK1 and Myc-tagged Δp85 were subcloned into pMSCVpuro vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The vectors were introduced into HEK293T cells (packaging cell line) with 1 μg of pVSV-G vector (Clontech) using the LipofectAMINE Plus reagents according to the instructions from the manufacturer. The next day, virus supernatant from these cells added with 5 μg/ml Polybrene to HUVECs. After 24 h of incubation, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 3 μg/ml puromycin. The selection of clones was carried out for 1 week in the presence of 3 μg/ml puromycin. Protein expression was confirmed by Western blot. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was obtained from HUVECs using the TRIzol reagent kit. The different amounts of total RNA (0.5–5 μg) isolated from HUVECs were subjected to reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, and the correlation between the amounts of RNA used and those of PCR products from both target (RANK) and internal standard (β-actin) mRNAs was examined. Briefly, target RNA was converted to cDNA by treatment with 200 units of reverse transcriptase and 500 ng of oligo(dT) primer in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm dNTPs at 42 °C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by heating at 70 °C for 15 min. Three μl of the cDNA mixture was used for enzymatic amplification. Polymerase chain reaction was performed in 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase, and 0.1 μm each of primers for RANK. The amplification was performed in a DNA thermal cycler (model PTC-200; MJ Research) under the following condition: denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min for the first cycle and for 30 s starting from the second cycle, annealing at 65 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s for 20 repetitive cycles. Final extension was at 72 °C for 10 min. The primers used were 5′-TTAAGCCAGTGCTTCACGGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-ACGTAGACCACGATGATGTCGC-3′ (antisense) for the RANK. The PCR products were electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. The amounts of PCR products were quantitated by densitometry. The 497-bp RANK amplicons generated by RT-PCR from HUVECs were directly sequenced using an ABI Prism cycle sequencing kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and DNA sequences were compared with published sequences to confirm their identity using computation performed at the NCBI and the BLAST network service. FACScan Analysis—Cells from subconfluent cultures were detached gently from the plate by treating with PBS containing 2 mm EDTA. The cells were washed two or three times with PBS and resuspended in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin. Subsequently, the cell suspensions were incubated with FITC-conjugated TRANCE (3 μg/ml) for 30 min on ice. The cells were washed two times with PBS and fixed with PBS containing 1% formalin for 30 min on ice. The fluorescence intensity was determined by FACScan analysis. Tube Formation Assay—Tube formation assay was performed as previously described (27Lee O.H. Kim Y.M. Lee Y.M. Moon E.J. Lee D.J. Kim J.H. Kim K.W. Kwon Y.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 743-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Briefly, 250 μl of growth factor-reduced Matrigel (10 mg of protein/ml) was pipetted into a 16-mm diameter tissue culture well and polymerized for 30 min at 37 °C. HUVECs incubated in M199 containing 1% FBS for 6 h were harvested after trypsin treatment, resuspended in M199, plated onto the layer of Matrigel at a density of 1 × 105 or 4 × 105 cells/well, and followed by the addition of 5 μg/ml TRANCE. After 20 h, the cultures were photographed (magnification, ×40). The area covered by the tube network was determined using an optical imaging technique in which pictures of the tubes were scanned in Adobe Photoshop and quantitated using Image-Pro Plus (Media Cybernetics). Western Blotting—Cell lysates from HUVECs were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The blocked membranes were then incubated with the indicated antibody, and the immunoreactive bands were visualized using chemiluminescent reagent as recommended by Amersham Biosciences. Data Analysis and Statistics—The data are presented as means ± S.E. from three different experiments. Statistical comparisons between groups were performed using Student's t test or analysis of variance in combination with Duncan's multiple range test. VEGF Increases Expression of RANK mRNA and Protein in Endothelial Cells—VEGF has been shown to control expression of many genes closely associated with induction and maintenance of the neovasculature in human (28Ferrara N. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1358-C1366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine whether VEGF regulates RANK expression in endothelial cells, subconfluent HUVECs were stimulated with 20 ng/ml VEGF for various time periods. Total RNA was then extracted from the culture, and semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed for the detection of RANK mRNA expression using specific primers for human RANK with an endogenous standard (β-actin) for internal normalization. The identity of the amplified fragment (0.497 kb) was verified by sequencing analysis. As shown in Fig. 1A, VEGF markedly increased the RANK transcript in HUVECs; maximal activation was observed 4 h after VEGF stimulation and declined thereafter. We also observed that VEGF enhances RANK mRNA expression in human microvascular endothelial cell line, HMEC-1 (Fig. 1B). To further confirm the effect of VEGF on RANK expression, the surface expression of RANK protein in endothelial cells was assessed by FACS analysis using FITC-conjugated TRANCE. VEGF increased RANK protein level on the surface of HUVECs in a time-dependent manner, reaching a near-maximal level within 8 h (Fig. 1D). The change at8hinthe expression level of RANK relative to control ranged between 2- and 5-fold; the average -fold increase was about 3. These results indicate that VEGF enhanced RANK mRNA and protein expression in endothelial cells. VEGF Increases RANK Expression through Its Receptor Flk-1/KDR but Not Flt-1—VEGF exerts its effects through binding to its two receptor tyrosine kinases, Flk-1/KDR and Flt-1, which are expressed on endothelial cells (29De Vries C. Escobedo J.A. Ueno H. Houck K Ferrara N. Williams L.T. Science. 1992; 255: 989-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (1896) Google Scholar, 30Quinn T.P. Peters K.G. De Vries C. Ferrara N. Williams L.T. Proc.

Cell. 1993; 72: 835-846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar). To determine which VEGF receptor is involved in RANK expression, we tested the effects of PlGF. PlGF is a member of the VEGF family of proteins that binds Flt-1 with high affinity but fails to bind Flk-1/KDR (32Park J.E. Chen H.H. Winer J. Houck K.A. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25646-25654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results showed that PIGF had no significant effect on RANK mRNA and protein expression, suggesting that activation of the Flk-1/KDR receptor may be responsible for VEGF-induced RANK expression, whereas Flt-1 is not involved (Fig. 2, A and B). The involvement of KDR receptor in RANK up-regulation was further examined by using SU1498, a specific inhibitor of Flk-1/KDR. Pretreatment of HUVECs with SU1498 to inactivate KDR completely blocked the effect of VEGF on RANK mRNA expression (Fig. 2, A and B). Thus, these results show that Flk-1/KDR is the dominant receptor involved in VEGF-induced increase in RANK expression. Src, PLC, PKC, and Phosphatidylinositol 3′-Kinase (PI3K) Were Involved in VEGF-stimulated RANK Expression in HUVECs—Many studies have shown the importance of Src protein-tyrosine kinases, PLC, and PI3K in Flk-1/KDR signaling and VEGF-induced endothelial gene expression (33Blum S. Issbruker K. Willuweit A. Hehlgans S. Lucerna D.M. Walsh K. Ahe D. Hofer E. Clauss M. J. Biol.

Venema V.J. Gu X. Venema R.C. Marrero M.B. Caldwell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25130-25135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). To address the role of these signaling molecules in VEGF-induced RANK up-regulation, HUVECs were treated in medium containing VEGF, as well as inhibitors to Src tyrosine kinases, PLC, or PI3K. Fig. 3A shows that PP1, a potent Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor, significantly blocked VEGF-induced expression of RANK mRNA. Inhibition of PLC with its specific inhibitor U73122 also blocked VEGF-induced RANK mRNA up-regulation, whereas U73343, a structurally similar derivative of U73122 but inactive for PLC, had no significant effect (Fig. 3A). In addition, the PI3K inhibitors LY 294002 and wortmannin markedly inhibited VEGF-induced increase in RANK mRNA expression (Fig. 3B). FACS analysis further showed that VEGF-induced cell surface expression of RANK protein was also significantly inhibited by these signaling blockers (Fig. 3D). To further evaluate the relevance of PI3K in VEGF-induced RANK expression, HUVECs were either mock-infected or infected with retrovirus encoding Δp85, a dominant negative mutant of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K that lacks the binding site for the p110 catalytic subunit (26Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Khwaja A. Marte B.M. Pappin D. Das P. Waterfield M.D. Ridley A. Downward J. Cell. 1997; 89: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). The expression level of Δp85 was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4A). RANK expression was induced by VEGF in mock-infected cells. However, overexpression of Δp85 significantly ablated both RANK mRNA and surface protein expression in response to VEGF (Fig. 4, B and C). These results suggest that activation of PLC and PI3K was involved in VEGF-induced RANK expression.Fig. 4The effect of dominant negative form of PI3K on VEGF-induced RANK expression. A, HUVECs were stably transfected with Myc-tagged dominant negative form of PI3K (Δp85) as described under “Materials and Methods” and expression level of Myc-Δp85 was determined by Western blot with anti-Myc antibody. B, the cells were stimulated with VEGF (20 ng/ml) for 4 h. Total mRNAs were isolated and semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” Actin (500 bp) was used as an internal control. In graph, the inset shows results from a representative RT-PCR trial for RANK (top bands) and actin (lower bands in each set) corresponding to the conditions represented by the bars. All data were expressed as the mean ± S.E. percentage of the RANK/Actin mRNA expression determined in control untreated HUVECs (set at 100%). Data shown in the bar graph were compiled from at least three independent experiments. C, the cells were stimulated with VEGF (20 ng/ml) for 8 h. The cell surface expression of RANK was analyzed by FACScan analysis as described in Fig. 1C. Data are mean ± S.E. of the relative RANK protein level determined in control untreated cells (set at 100%) from three different experiments. *, p < 0.05 versus control; #, p < 0.05 versus VEGF only.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) PLC is known to generate inositol triphosphate and diacylglycerol, which activate intracellular Ca2+ mobilization and PKC, respectively. To further characterize the role of the down-stream signaling pathway following PLC activation in RANK up-regulation, we assessed the abilities of the intracellular Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM and the broad PKC inhibitor chelerythrine chloride to block RANK expression by VEGF. Inhibition of PKC with chelerythrine chloride blocked VEGF-induced RANK expression to the basal level. However, BAPTA-AM only had no significant effect (Fig. 3, C and D). These data demonstrate that the VEGF-induced increase in RANK expression is dependent on PKC activity rather than the role of intracellular Ca2+. Inhibition of MAPK Blocks VEGF-induced RANK Up-regulation—Activation of MAPK is known to be importantly involved in the VEGF signaling pathway in endothelial cells. The MAPK pathway can be activated via several upstream signaling routes. VEGF-induced MAPK activation is previously reported to occur via a PKC-dependent pathway (37Takahashi T. Ueno H. Shibuya M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2221-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Because VEGF-induced RANK up-regulation was blocked by inhibitors of Src, PLC, and PKC, which are linked to the ERK cascade, we first confirmed the involvement of Src, PLC, and PKC in ERK activation in our system and then evaluated whether activation of ERK was required for VEGF-induced RANK expression. Subconfluent HUVECs were exposed to VEGF with or without inhibitors of Src, PLC, and PKC, and the activation of ERK1/2 (p44 ERK1 and p42 ERK2) was analyzed by Western blot analysis using antibody directed against the phosphorylated form of ERK1/2. As shown in Fig. 5A, inhibitors of Src, PLC, and PKC significantly blocked VEGF-induced ERK activation, indicating that activation of ERKs by VEGF occurs through the Src-PLC-PKC pathway. Therefore, we assessed the role of ERK1/2 in VEGF-induced RANK up-regulation. The effects of VEGF on RANK expression in mRNA and protein levels were completely blocked by the specific MAPK inhibitor PD98059 (Fig. 5, B and C). To further evaluate the relevance of ERKs in VEGF-induced RANK expression, HUVECs were either mock-infected or infected with retrovirus encoding dominant negative MEK1 (DN-MEK1). The expression level of DN-MEK1 was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5D). Expression of DN-MEK1 resulted in substantial inhibition of both RANK mRNA and surface protein expression in response to VEGF (Fig. 5, E and F). These results suggest"
https://openalex.org/W2034291831,"Recent studies have implicated interferon signaling in the regulation of cellular senescence. However, the role of specific interferon-inducible proteins in cellular senescence remains to be defined. Here we report that IFI 16, an interferon-inducible transcriptional modulator from the p200-protein family, contributes to cellular senescence of prostate epithelial cells. Normal human prostate epithelial cells (PrEC) in culture expressed detectable levels of IFI 16, and the levels increased more than fourfold when cells approached cellular senescence. Consistent with a role of IFI 16 in cellular senescence, human prostate cancer cell lines either did not express IFI 16 or expressed a variant form, which was primarily detected in the cytoplasm of prostate cancer cells and not in the nucleus. Moreover, overexpression of functional IFI 16 in human prostate cancer cell lines inhibited colony formation. Additionally, ectopic expression of IFI 16 in clonal prostate cancer cell lines was associated with a senescence-like phenotype, production of senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (a biochemical marker for cellular senescence), and reduction of S-phase cells in culture. Importantly, upregulation of p21WAF1 and inhibition of E2F-stimulated transcription accompanied inhibition of cell growth by IFI 16 in prostate cancer cell lines. Collectively, our observations support the idea that increased levels of IFI 16 in PrECs contribute to senescence-associated irreversible cell growth arrest."

Mitochondrial carriers are a family of integral membrane proteins that transport metabolites and co-factors across the inner membrane of the mitochondria. Yeast mitochondria contain 35 members of the mitochondrial carrier family (1Nelson D.R. Felix C.M. Swanson J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 285-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), whereas human mitochondria have close to 60 different carriers. The transported substrates are required for metabolic energy-generating pathways, such as the citric acid cycle and fatty acid β-oxidation, which take place in the mitochondrial matrix. The carriers also perform crucial transport steps in amino acid synthesis and degradation and mitochondrial DNA replication. Uncoupling proteins, which generate heat by dissipation of the proton gradient, are also members of the mitochondrial carrier family (2Aquila H. Link T.A. Klingenberg M. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2369-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial carriers have a tripartite structure consisting of three homologous repeats of about 100 amino acid residues (3Walker J.E. Runswick M.J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 4Saraste M. Walker J.E. FEBS Lett. 1982; 144: 250-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Each repetitive domain consists of two membrane-spanning α-helices connected by a large hydrophilic loop in the matrix, whereas the repeats are linked by shorter loops. Both the amino and carboxyl terminus are located in the space between the inner and outer mitochondrial membrane (5Miroux B. Frossard V. Raimbault S. Ricquier D. Bouillard F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3739-3745Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 6Hatanaka T. Hashimoto M. Majima E. Shinohara Y. Terada H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Each repeat also has a signature motif, P-X-[DE]-X-[LIVAT]-[RK]-X-[LRH]-[LIVMFY]-[QGAIVM], which is characteristic for mitochondrial carriers (PROSITE PS00215). Biochemical and biophysical studies have suggested that the functional form of the carriers may be a homodimer, but direct structural evidence for this notion has not been obtained (6Hatanaka T.

The ADP/ATP carrier is an archetypal member of this family and exchanges cytosolic ADP for ATP produced in the matrix by the ATP synthase. The substrate specificity is restricted to adenine nucleotides and the equimolar exchange of ADP and ATP is electrogenic (15Pfaff E. Klingenberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1968; 6: 66-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Inhibitor studies have revealed that the ADP/ATP carrier exists in two conformational states in the mitochondrial membrane. The carrier binds carboxyatractyloside or atractyloside in the cytoplasmic or c-state and bongkrekic acid in the matrix or m-state (16Brandolin G. Le Saux A. Trézéguet V. Lauquin G.J.M. Vignais P.V. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 459-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Consistent with its central function in energy metabolism, the nuclear genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains three genes coding for isoforms of the ADP/ATP carrier. The isoforms AAC1 and AAC2 are expressed under aerobic conditions, whereas AAC3 is expressed under anaerobic conditions, but all three carriers have similar enzymatic properties (17Drgoň T. Šabova L. Gavurnikova G. Kolarov J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 304: 277-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). No structural information has been obtained for any mitochondrial carrier. Here we report the projection structure of yeast AAC3 determined by electron crystallography. The projection map shows that the molecule has pseudo 3-fold symmetry compatible with the tripartite structure predicted from the amino acid sequence (4Saraste M. Walker J.E. FEBS Lett. 1982; 144: 250-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar).

An NH2-terminal nine histidine tag and a factor Xa cleavage site were introduced at the NcoI site by kinase treatment and annealing of synthesized primers, leading to the vector pYES-Paac2-N9His-Xa-aac3. All cloned vectors were isolated by miniprep (Qiagen) and confirmed by PCR, restriction analysis, and sequencing (Cambridge Bioscience).

Majima E. Shinohara Y. Terada H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The AAC3 expression vector PYES-Paac2-N9His-Xa-aac3 was transformed into the strain WB-12 using standard techniques, and transformants were selected on SC medium minus Trp plates (Invitrogen). Cell Culture and Preparation of Mitochondria—A preculture of 500 ml was used to inoculate 30 liters of YP medium containing 3% glycerol and 2% ethanol in a 40 liter Bioreactor (FT Applikon). The cells grown at 30 °C were harvested at A 600 of 16.0 by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 20 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 0.65 m sorbitol, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0, 0.005 m EDTA, 0.2% bovine serum albumin at a volume ratio of 1:1. Phenylmethanesulphonyl fluoride was added at a final concentration of 1 mm immediately prior to cell disruption at 30,000 p.s.i. in a Z Plus 2.2-kilowatt cell disruptor (Constant Systems). The suspension was centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C (Sorvall) to remove cellular debris and unbroken cells, and the mitochondrial fraction was collected by ultracentrifugation at 140,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h. The mitochondrial pellet was washed in 0.65 m sorbitol, 0.02 m Tris, pH 7.4, collected by ultracentrifugation at 140,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h, and resuspended in the same buffer at a final concentration of 35 mg/ml. Liganding and Purification of Yeast AAC3—The mitochondrial fraction (500 mg of protein) was incubated for 20 min at 4 °C with atractyloside (ATR) 1The abbreviations used are: ATR, atractyloside; DDM, dodecyl β-d-maltoside; MES, 2-[N-morpholino]ethanesulfonic acid. (Calbiochem) at a concentration of 20 nmol of ATR per mg of protein (99% occupancy). Solubilization was carried out in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1% dodecyl β-d-maltoside (DDM) (Anatrace), 1 tablet of Complete protease inhibitors minus EDTA (Roche Diagnostics Ltd.) for 1 h at 4 °C while mixing. The non-solubilized material was pelleted by centrifugation at 140,000 × g at 4 °C for 45 min. Solubilized protein was bound to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow (Qiagen) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, followed by extensive washing in buffers, consisting of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% DDM and 5 μm ATR and 40 or 60 mm imidazole, consecutively. The carrier was eluted in the same buffer with 200 mm imidazole. The eluate was concentrated to 2 mg/ml using a Centricon centrifugal filter device YM-30 (Millipore) and purified on Superdex 200 XK16/60 (Amersham Biosciences) in buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% DDM, and 5 μm ATR. Two-dimensional Crystallization—Crystallization was performed by dialysis of a micellar mixture containing 1.5 mg/ml protein and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine solubilized in DDM at lipid to protein ratios of 0.2–0.45 w/w. The detergent removal of 100-μl samples was performed in Slide-a-Lyzers (Pierce) against 25 mm MES, pH 6.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 2 g Biobeads, 5 μm ATR, 0.02% NaN3. Crystals were obtained after 7 days at 8 °C. Electron Microscopy and Image Processing—Electron microscopy was performed on a 200 keV Tecnai F20 microscope with field emission gun and Gatan 626 cryo-stage cooled by liquid nitrogen. Images were collected at a magnification of 62,000 under standard low dose conditions. Images containing crystalline areas were selected by optical diffraction and processed using the MRC image processing programs (19Crowther R.A. Henderson R. Smith J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). The distortion of the lattice was corrected in two rounds of unbending using the best-ordered part of the crystal as reference (19Crowther R.A. Henderson R. Smith J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). After origin and defocus refinement, the data were merged and the image amplitudes were scaled to the diffraction data of bacteriorhodopsin. To obtain sufficient material for purification and crystallization, it was necessary to overproduce the yeast ADP/ATP carrier 3 (AAC3) in a functional form by homologous expression. The activity of the expressed carrier was checked by complementation of yeast strain WB-12, which lacks functional AAC1 and AAC2 and consequently cannot grow on glycerol as sole source of carbon and energy (6Hatanaka T. Hashimoto M. Majima E. Shinohara Y. Terada H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To allow purification by nickel affinity chromatography, AAC3 was overproduced with an NH2-terminal 9-histidine tag and a factor Xa cleavage site. The carrier was expressed under control of the aac2 promoter in the WB-12 genetic background and was able to restore growth on glycerol. The N9His-Xa-AAC3 expression strain grew on glycerol with a doubling time of 3.9 h, which was comparable with that of the wild-type strain (3.6 h). Therefore, the tag did not interfere significantly with targeting, insertion and activity of the carrier. The N9His-Xa-AAC3 was purified by a three-step procedure in the presence of the inhibitor ATR. The carriers were solubilized from yeast mitochondrial membranes in dodecyl maltoside and purified by nickel affinity chromatography to 85% purity. The eluate was concentrated and purified further by size exclusion chromatography to 97% purity. The major impurity, 2% of total, was a degradation product of the carrier as confirmed by Western blot analysis. The total yield of purified AAC3 was ∼150 μg/liter of yeast culture. Detergent removal from micelles containing purified ATR-inhibited AAC3, dioleoylphosphatidylcholine and dodecyl maltoside resulted in the formation of two-dimensional crystals in the form of tubes (Fig. 1). The tubes were variable in length, but always had a defined width of 0.25 μm (Fig. 1). The majority of these tubes seemed to grow from large vesicles, which might indicate that densely packed vesicles changed into tubes. Most flattened tubes had two crystalline layers, but the average crystalline area was relatively small, i.e. 0.2 by 0.3 μm. For collection of high resolution data, images of frozen hydrated crystals were recorded by electron microscopy at liquid nitrogen temperatures. Fig. 2 shows the calculated image diffraction pattern of one crystalline area of good quality. Good spots extended to 8 Å with weaker more sporadic reflections to 5-Å resolution. The systematic absence of (h, 0) and (0, k) reflections, when h and k were odd numbers, indicated the existence of 2-fold screw axes in both directions (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Calculated image Fourier transform of a two-dimensional crystal of AAC3 exhibiting a 42.5 by 172.1-Å lattice. The size and number of each square on the reciprocal lattice describes the signal to noise ratio of the amplitude data (32Henderson R. Baldwin J.M. Downing K.H. Lepault J. Zemlin F. Ultramicroscopy. 1986; 19: 147-178Crossref Scopus (634) Google Scholar).

The total molecular footprint area covered by the protein density is 1,006 Å2. The average projected area per helix in archeal rhodopsins, rhodopsin, and bacterial transporters calculated in the same way is 129 Å2 (20Grigorieff N. Ceska T.A. Downing K.H. Baldwin J.M.

Therefore, the protein density could contain around 8 α-helices, but not many more because of helix-helix packing constraints (26Bowie J.U. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 780-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The projected structure thus represents a single AAC3 molecule. The unit cell contains four AAC3 molecules, and their density features are consistent with tilted α-helices seen in projection. The relative position and orientation of the molecules in the crystal are described by p22121 symmetry and hence half of the molecules are oriented up and half down.Table IElectron crystallographic dataPlane groupaDetermined by ALLSPACE (33).

The AAC3 molecule consists of a continuous density in the form of a rounded triangle with two, possibly three, additional density peaks in the center (Fig. 4A). The density peaks on the ring are related to each other with pseudo 3-fold symmetry, which could be a reflection of the characteristic tripartite structure of mitochondrial carriers (4Saraste M. Walker J.E. FEBS Lett. 1982; 144: 250-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The most consistent interpretation is that main structural scaffold of AAC3 consists of a bundle of six tilted transmembrane α-helices. The density peaks on the bundle most likely derive from tilted α-helices that partially overlap on the vertical as in bacteriorhodopsin (20Grigorieff N. Ceska T.A. Downing K.H. Baldwin J.M. Henderson R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 393-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). The proposed model agrees well with the total surface area of the molecule and would imply that both the amino and carboxyl terminus would be on the same side of the inner mitochondrial membrane (5Miroux B. Frossard V. Raimbault S. Ricquier D. Bouillard F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3739-3745Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 6Hatanaka T. Hashimoto M. Majima E. Shinohara Y. Terada H. Biochem. Biophys.

Acta. 2000; 1457: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The projected length for each tilted α-helix in the bundle would be 13 Å, which compares well with an average value of 12.5 Å per tilted helix in bacteriorhodopsin (20Grigorieff N. Ceska T.A. Downing K.H. Baldwin J.M. Henderson R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 393-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). Alternative α-helical arrangements are extremely unlikely, because they are inconsistent with the pseudo 3-fold symmetry and tripartite repeats, the localization of both termini, average α-helical distances, and the surface area of the projected density. The cross-sectional area in the center of the α-helical bundle is ∼280 Å2, if one takes the side chains of the helices into account. Two, maybe three, additional density peaks are visible in the center of the bundle (Fig. 4A). The interpretation of these densities is less straightforward, but it is unlikely that the densities represent atractyloside or adenine nucleotides, because the density of these molecules is similar to that of amino acid side chains, which do not show in the density cut-off. Experiments with proteolytic enzymes, cross-linking, and labeling agents have shown that regions in matrix loops 1 and 2 are important in substrate recognition and in conformational changes induced by atractyloside binding (11Majima E.

Terada H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 424-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These regions have a propensity to form short amphipathic α-helices as can be inferred from secondary structure predictions (31McGuffin L.J. Bryson K. Jones D.T. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 404-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2741) Google Scholar). These putative α-helices would basically be extensions of the even-numbered transmembrane α-helices on the matrix side linked with a short loop. It is not likely that these short α-helices enter the transmembrane region of the AAC3 molecule, because of α-helical distance constraints (26Bowie J.U. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 780-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The signature motif that is typical for mitochondrial carriers also has a propensity to adopt an amphipathic α-helical structure (31McGuffin L.J. Bryson K. Jones D.T. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 404-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2741) Google Scholar) and could be part of the odd-numbered transmembrane α-helices. Many biochemical and biophysical studies support the idea that mitochondrial carriers are functional as homodimers. These studies include ultracentrifugation (8Lin C.S. Hackenberg H. Klingenberg E.M. FEBS Lett. 1980; 113: 304-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), cross-linking experiments (9Hackenberg H. Klingenberg M.

The p22121 crystal consists of symmetrical dimers organized in rows that are alternating in orientation (Fig. 3). A p2 crystal form was obtained under very similar crystallization conditions using ATR-inhibited AAC3 purified in Triton X-100 (data not shown). The structure was solved to 15-Å resolution from images of negatively stained two-dimensional crystals. The p2 crystal form also consisted of rows of symmetrical dimers like the p22121 crystal form, but the rows always had the same orientation. The symmetrical dimer thus seems to be the crystallizing unit in both crystal forms, but this could simply be the preferred way in which AAC3 molecules crystallize. However, the dimer could also be the representation of the oligomeric state of the carrier in the membrane as observed in the aforementioned biochemical and biophysical studies. We cannot discriminate between these two possibilities, but the projection structure does prove that AAC3 molecules do not form an integrated 12 α-helical bundle as has been proposed (12Kotaria R. Mayor J.A. Walters D.E. Kaplan R.S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Nor do two molecules form at the interface a channel, through which a charged molecule like ATP or ADP could pass (14Huang S.-G Odoy S. Klingenberg M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 394: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The projection structure shows that nucleotides are most likely to pass through the membrane in the core of the monomer. If ADP/ATP transport requires cooperative interaction of two carriers (14Huang S.-G Odoy S. Klingenberg M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 394: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), then this must occur by association of two separate monomers. Nucleotide exchange would in that case be a process in which two monomers each bind an adenine nucleotide, associate, change conformational state, release substrates, and dissociate for another round of transport. However, the central cavity in the molecule could in principle be large enough to bind two adenine nucleotides depending on the orientation of the substrates (Fig. 4, A and B). This opens the possibility that ADP/ATP exchange is carried out by a single carrier molecule.

https://openalex.org/W2008198398,"TSC1 and TSC2 are responsible for the tumor suppressor gene syndrome tuberous sclerosis (TSC). Mammalian TSC genes have been shown to be involved in cell cycle regulation. Recently, in Drosophila, these data have been confirmed and TSC genes have further been demonstrated to affect cell size control. Here we provide supporting data for the fact that the latter function is conserved in mammals. Human TSC1 and TSC2 trigger mammalian cell size reduction and a dominant-negative TSC2 mutant induces increased size. These effects occur in all cell cycle phases, are dependent on the activity of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase and are abolished by co-overexpression of a dominant-negative Akt mutant. Two independent naturally occurring and disease-causing mutations within the TSC2 gene eliminate tuberin's capacity to affect cell size control, emphasizing the relevance of this function for the development of the disease. The same mutations have earlier been shown not to affect tuberin's antiproliferative capacity. That the consequences of modulated TSC gene expression on cell proliferation and on cell size can be assigned to separable functions is further supported by two findings: A mutation within the TSC1 gene, earlier shown to still harbor anti-proliferative effects, was found to eliminate the cell size regulating functions. An important mammalian cell size regulator, c-Myc, was found to inhibit tuberin's antiproliferative capacity, but to have no effects on tuberin-dependent cell size control. To obtain further mechanistical insights, microarray screens for genes involved in TSC1- or TSC2-mediated cell size effects were performed. Antisense experiments revealed that the so observed regulation of the FK506-binding protein, FKBP38, plays a role in TSC gene-dependent cell size regulation. These data provide new insights into mammalian cell size regulation and allow a better understanding of the function of human TSC genes."

We also show that JIP1 does not bridge the AβPP gene family member AβPP-like protein 2, APLP2, to Klc1. These results support a model where JIP1 mediates the interaction of AβPP to the motor protein kinesin-I and that this JIP1 function is unique for AβPP relative to its family member APLP2.

The JIP protein family, members of which were initially isolated as scaffolds for kinases of the JNK cascade, consists of three proteins: JIP1 (7Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J.

JIP1b (referred to as JIP1 in this manuscript) and JIP2, which are conserved between human and mouse, contain a C-terminal Src homology region 3 and a PTB domain. JIP1a, which has not been found in humans, lacks a complete PTB domain. JIP3 is structurally unrelated (11Kelkar N. Gupta S. Dickens M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell.

The PTB domain of JIP1 binds to the YENPTY motif found in the AβPP intracellular domain (AICD/AID) (12Matsuda S. Yasukawa T. Homma Y. Ito Y. Niikura T. Hiraki T. Hirai S. Ohno S. Kita Y. Kawasumi M.

The biological relevance of the JIP1-AβPP interaction is underlined by the evidence that these two proteins interact in mouse brain (13Scheinfeld M.H. Roncarati R. Vito P. Lopez P.A. Abdallah M.

On the contrary, Klc1 was one of the predominant proteins isolated in yeast two-hybrid screening using the C terminus of JIP1 as bait (data not shown). This apparent paradox can be resolved by postulating that the interaction between Klc and AβPP is indirect and that JIP proteins are required to form a Klc·JIP·AβPP tripartite complex. Contrary to the published results (4Kamal A. Stokin G.B. Yang Z. Xia C.H. Goldstein L.S. Neuron. 2000; 28: 449-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), here we demonstrate that JIP1 is necessary for Klc1-AβPP association. Furthermore, JIP1 does not bridge APLP2 to Klc1. These findings provide a novel insight into the function of JIP proteins in the transport of AβPP.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies—The following antibodies were used: αFLAG (mouse monoclonal M2, Sigma), α green fluorescent protein (αGFP) (rabbit polyclonal, Clontech), αMyc (mouse monoclonal 6E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), αAPLP2 (rabbit polyclonal 171616, Calbiochem), αAβPP (mouse monoclonal 22C11, Chemicon), αT7 (mouse monoclonal, Novagen), and rabbit polyclonals αJIPN and αJIPC and their pre-immune sera (12Matsuda S.

Klc1 constructs were directly cloned by yeast two-hybrid screening using a mouse brain library (Clontech) and JIP1 (540–707) as bait. The sequences of the Klc1 clones were identical to Klc1 (GenBank™ accession numbers XM_192743 and AK031309) except for the region coded by the last 10 amino acids, which were identical to mouse expressed sequence tags (GenBank™ accession numbers AA270658, AW108197, BF449177, BE859872, BM945454, BU706278, and CB248535) and rat Klc1b (GenBank™ accession number M75147), indicating that the clones are mouse Klc1b. Other control vectors, pGBKT7–53 (BD fusion of p53), pGBKT7-Lam (BD fusion of nuclear lamin), pGADT7-T (AD fusion of large T antigen), and pCL1 (Gal4), are from Clontech. No yeast construct displayed auto-activation, unless otherwise noted. The yeast constructs were transformed in AH109 yeast strain (Clontech) on plates lacking tryptophan and leucine. Patches of yeast transformants were replica-plated on plates lacking tryptophan, leucine, adenine, and histidine to monitor the interaction. Four independent patches of transformed yeast showed identical results, unless otherwise noted. LacZ activity of yeast transformants were assayed using O-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) as substrate. Bacterial expression vectors of glutathione S-transferase (GST), GST-AID, GST-ΔNPTY, and His/T7-JIP1 are described (12Matsuda S. Yasukawa T. Homma Y. Ito Y. Niikura T. Hiraki T. Hirai S. Ohno S.

His/T7-Klc1 was created by cloning the yeast Klc1 insert into pET28(c) (Novagen). For bacterial expression of GST-11aa, the C-terminal 11 amino acids of JIP1 were cloned in pGEX-2Tm (12Matsuda S.

Chem. 2002; 277: 3767-3775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar).Cell Culture, Transfection, Immunoprecipitation and GST Pull-down Experiments—HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum and were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) or Metafectene (Biontex). Transfected cells were lysed in Buffer A (Hepes/NaOH, pH7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm NaCl) containing 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysates were precipitated with anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity gel (Sigma), αJIPN, αJIPC, or pre-immune serum and protein A/G beads (Pierce), or with glutathione beads (Amersham Biosciences). After the precipitants were washed three times with Buffer A containing 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100, the beads were boiled in 2× SDS sampling buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with the indicated antibodies.Purified Protein Interaction—GST fusion proteins and His/T7-tagged proteins were produced and purified as described (12Matsuda S. Yasukawa T. Homma Y. Ito Y. Niikura T. Hiraki T. Hirai S. Ohno S. Kita Y. Kawasumi M. Kouyama K. Yamamoto T. Kyriakis J.M. Nishimoto I. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6597-6607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For binding experiments, ∼6 μg (200 pmol) of GST, GST-AID, GST-ΔNPTY, and GST-11aa were immobilized on 30 μl of glutathione beads in 500 μl of Buffer B (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) by incubating for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed once with Buffer C (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100). The washed beads were incubated with purified His/T7-Klc1 at various concentrations in the presence or absence of His/T7-JIP1 in a total volume of 200 μl of Buffer C for 2 h at 4 °C. After the incubation, the beads were washed three times with Buffer C and boiled in 40 μl of 2× SDS sampling buffer. Ten μl were used to detect the bound GST fusion proteins by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining and to detect the bound Klc1 and JIP1 by Western blotting with αT7 antibody.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONIn Yeast, Klc1 Does Not Interact with AID although AID-JIP1/2 and Klc1-JIP1/2 Interactions Are Readily Detectable—To characterize the interaction among AβPP, JIP, and Klc1, we initially used the yeast two-hybrid system. Various domains of each gene (Fig. 1A) were fused to BD and AD and tested for their interaction. Two independent Klc1 constructs, identified in a yeast two-hybrid screening using JIP1PTB+K as bait (data not shown), did not interact with AID (Fig. 1B, upper panel). This is significant, because both Klc1 constructs contain all of the six TPRs (Fig. 1A) that have been reported to be sufficient for the interaction between Klc1 and AβPP (4Kamal A. Stokin G.B. Yang Z. Xia C.H. Goldstein L.S. Neuron. 2000; 28: 449-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). At the same time, JIP1 (1PTB+K) interacted with AID but not with ΔNPTY, an AID mutant lacking the PTB-binding motif YENPTY, confirming the YENPTY motif-dependent interaction between JIP1 and AβPP (12Matsuda S. Yasukawa T. Homma Y. Ito Y. Niikura T. Hiraki T. Hirai S. Ohno S. Kita Y. Kawasumi M. Kouyama K. Yamamoto T. Kyriakis J.M. Nishimoto I. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6597-6607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Scheinfeld M.H. Roncarati R. Vito P. Lopez P.A. Abdallah M. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3767-3775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Next, we analyzed whether JIP1 proteins interact with Klc1. The JIP1 (1PTB+K) interacted with both Klc1 constructs. Interestingly, 1PTB, lacking the C-terminal 11 amino acids of JIP1, lost any interaction with Klc1 but retained the YENPTY motif-dependent interaction with AID, indicating that Klc1-JIP1 interaction is independent of JIP1-AβPP interaction (Fig. 1B, lower panel). Lastly, we studied the JIP2-AβPP and JIP2-Klc1 interactions. As summarized in Fig. 1C, JIP2 interacted with AID and Klc1 in the same manner as did JIP1. We could not test the two-hybrid interaction between the C-terminal 11 amino acids of JIP1 and Klc1 or AID, because the BD fusion of the 11 amino acids was auto-activating. In conclusion, in the yeast two-hybrid system, Klc1 does not interact with AID, whereas JIP1/2 interacts with both Klc1 and AID.The C-terminal 11 to 9 Amino Acids of JIP1 Are Necessary and Sufficient for JIP1-Klc1 Interaction—The data obtained in the yeast two-hybrid suggest that the C-terminal 11 amino acids of JIP1 are necessary for JIP1-Klc1 binding but are not required for AβPP interaction. To test whether this JIP1 C-terminal region is sufficient for Klc1 binding, we transfected HEK293 cells with either Klc1 or AβPP together with the constructs expressing GST fused to 11, 9, 7, or 0 C-terminal amino acids of JIP1 (GST-11aa, -9aa, -7aa, and -0aa). Although none of these GST fusion JIP1 proteins interacted with AβPP (Fig. 2B), the C-terminal 11, 9, and 7 amino acids of JIP1 did bind Klc1, with the 11-amino acid fusion being the strongest (Fig. 2C). It is noteworthy that the last nine amino acids of JIP1 and JIP2 are identical.Fig. 2JIP1 bridges Klc1 to AβPP. A, illustrations of mammalian expression vectors used. FLAG, Myc, and GST tags are indicated. Other designations are the same as in Fig. 1A. B, HEK293 cells were transfected with AβPP together with the indicated GST proteins. The cell lysates were precipitated with glutathione beads. AβPP in total lysates (TL) and GST precipitants (ppt) were detected by Western blotting with αAβPP antibody. Similar amounts of GST fusions were detected in the precipitants (data not shown). C, HEK293 cells were transfected with the same GST fusions together with FLAG-Klc1. Klc1 in total lysates and precipitants were detected by Western blotting with αFLAG antibody. Similar amounts of GST fusions were detected in the precipitants (data not shown). D, HEK293 cells were transfected with the indicated combinations of AβPP, FLAG-Klc1, and GST-JIP1 fusion proteins, and analyzed as in C. E, HEK293 cells were transfected with various combinations of plasmids indicated above each lane: without (–) or with (+) FLAG-Klc1; without (–) or with (+) Myc-JIP1a (1a), Myc-JIP1 (1); without (–) or with (+)AβPP (FL), or AβPP lacking C-terminal 15 amino acids (AβPPΔ: Δ). The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated by FLAG M2 beads, and Klc1, JIP1a/JIP1, and AβPP/AβPPΔ in the total lysates, and the precipitants (IP αFLAG) were analyzed by Western blotting by αFLAG, αMyc, and αAβPP antibodies, respectively. F, HEK293 cells were transfected with the indicated combinations of FLAG-Klc1, Myc-JIP1/2/3, and AβPP. The cell lysates were precipitated with FLAG M2 beads, and Klc1, JIP1/2/3 and AβPP in the total lysates and the precipitants were detected by Western blotting as in D. G, HEK293 cells were transfected with the indicated combinations of Myc-JIP1/2 and AβPP. The lysates were immunoprecipitated by αJIPC serum (C) or its pre-immune serum (P). JIP1/2 and AβPP in total lysates and the precipitants were detected with αMyc and αAβPP antibodies, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further clarify the role of the PTB domain and the C-terminal 11 amino acids of JIP1, GST pull-down experiments were performed using HEK293 cells transfected with AβPP and Klc1 together with GST fusion of JIP1 portions (Fig. 2D). As expected, GST-JIP1-C, which contains both the PTB domain and 11 amino acids interacted with AβPP and Klc1, whereas GST-1PTB, which does not have C-terminal 11 amino acids, binds to AβPP but not to Klc1.The above data confirm that the domains mediating JIP1-AβPP and Klc1-JIP1 interactions are distinct and not overlapping. Specifically, the PTB domain of JIP1 interacts with the PTB-binding motif (YENPTY) present in AID, whereas the C-terminal 11–9 amino acids of JIP bind to Klc1. Thus, JIP1/2 could potentially bridge Klc1 to AβPP.JIP1 Bridges AβPP, but Not the Family Member APLP2, to Klc1 in Transfected Cells—It is possible that AβPP and Klc1 interact in mammalian cells, although a direct binding cannot be observed in yeast. To test this possibility, HEK293 cells (in which endogenous JIP1 expression is below detection (data not shown)) were transfected with Klc1/JIP1/AβPP coding plasmids, and the Klc1·AβPP complex was analyzed by immunoprecipitating Klc1. As shown in Fig. 2E, Klc1 did not precipitate AβPP, a finding that is in agreement with the yeast two-hybrid results. However, Klc1 did precipitate AβPP in the presence of JIP1. Notably, JIP1a, which lacks a complete PTB domain and does not bind to AβPP (12Matsuda S. Yasukawa T. Homma Y. Ito Y. Niikura T. Hiraki T. Hirai S. Ohno S. Kita Y. Kawasumi M. Kouyama K. Yamamoto T.

Chem. 2002; 277: 3767-3775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), still interacts with Klc1 but failed to promote AβPP-Klc1 interaction. Moreover, AβPPΔ, which lacks the YENPTY motif and does not bind to JIP1, also did not form Klc1·JIP·AβPP complexes. All of the evidence confirms that the JIP1-AβPP binding is necessary for the association between Klc1 and AβPP. In a paper published during the preparation of this manuscript, Inomata et al. (14Inomata H. Nakamura Y. Hayakawa A. Takata H. Suzuki T. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22946-22955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) have observed that some interaction between AβPP and Klc1 was significantly enhanced by transfecting JIP1. The minimal Klc1-AβPP interaction that they observed in the absence of JIP1 transfection could be mediated by endogenous JIP1, assuming that the cells they used express higher level of JIP1 than ours. Alternatively, it might be attributable to the difference of expression of a distinct linker protein that functions similarly to JIP1.We further tested JIP2 and JIP3 for this bridging effect. JIP2 was much less efficient than JIP1 in bridging Klc1 to AβPP, and sometimes this effect was undetectable (Fig. 2F). This correlates with the weaker JIP2-AβPP binding as compared with JIP1-AβPP interaction (Fig. 2G). As expected, JIP3, which does not contain a PTB domain, did not bridge AβPP to Klc1 (Fig. 2F).Finally, we determined whether JIP1 could link another AβPP family member APLP2 to Klc1. To this end, we transfected HEK293 cells with AβPP or APLP2 together with Klc1. These transfections were performed with or without JIP1. After Klc1 precipitation, we found that AβPP associates with Klc1 when JIP1 is expressed, whereas APLP2 did not interact with Klc1 even in the presence of JIP1 (Fig. 3). These data are consistent with our previous finding that JIP1 preferentially interacts with AβPP (12Matsuda S. Yasukawa T. Homma Y. Ito Y. Niikura T. Hiraki T. Hirai S. Ohno S. Kita Y. Kawasumi M.

HEK293 cells were transfected with the indicated combinations of FLAG-Klc1, Myc-JIP1, AβPP and APLP2. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated by FLAG M2 beads. Klc1, JIP1, AβPP, and APLP2 in the total lysates (TL) and the precipitants (IP αFLAG) were detected by Western blotting with αFLAG, αMyc, αAβPP, αAPLP2 antibodies, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Altogether, our data indicate that JIP1-AβPP and Klc1-JIP1 interactions are independent and that JIP1, and at a much lower degree JIP2, bridges Klc1 to AβPP in HEK293 cells. Moreover, this bridging effect is specific for AβPP and is not shared by the other family member, APLP2.Purified Klc1 Interacts with Purified AID Only in the Presence of Purified JIP1—Our data apparently conflict with those published by Kamal et al. (4Kamal A. Stokin G.B. Yang Z. Xia C.H. Goldstein L.S. Neuron. 2000; 28: 449-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), who have observed the direct interaction between AID and the TPR domain of Klc using purified recombinant proteins. To directly solve the discrepancy between our results and theirs, we used purified recombinant proteins. Kamal and colleagues used His-tagged GFP-AID fusion and GST-TPR fusion proteins (4Kamal A. Stokin G.B. Yang Z. Xia C.H. Goldstein L.S. Neuron. 2000; 28: 449-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). We noticed that some GFP vectors express GFP proteins that bind to Klc1 in transfected cells (Fig. 4A). HEK293 cells were transfected with different GFP vectors together with Klc1. When Klc1 was precipitated, the GFP protein expressed from pEGFP-C2 was precipitated. The GFP protein expressed from pEGFP-C3 was also precipitated, although the efficiency was much lower. On the contrary, those GFP proteins expressed by pEGFP-N1 and pEGFP-C1 were not. All of pEGFP-C1, -C2, and -C3 distinctly express (fused to the C-terminal of GFP) 26 amino acids coded by the polylinker regions (Fig. 4B). pEGF-N1 codes only for the GFP protein. Therefore, some amino acid sequences fused to GFP may cause artifactual interactions between GFP fusion proteins and Klc1. Thus, we performed our in vitro experiments using GST-AID, His/T7-Klc1, and His/T7-JIP1 recombinant purified proteins (Fig. 5A).Fig. 4Some GFP proteins expressed by pEGFP vectors bind to Klc1. A, HEK293 cells were transfected with pEGFP-N1, -C1, -C2 and -C3 (N1, C1, C2, and C3) together with FLAG-Klc1.

Again, Klc1 did not show any binding to GST-AID, but it associated with GST-AID in the presence of recombinant JIP1 (Fig. 5B). That the Klc1-AβPP interaction is JIP1-dependent is again confirmed by the finding that Klc1 did not bind to GST-ΔNPTY even in the presence of JIP1 (Fig. 5B). We further confirmed that the Klc1-JIP1 interaction is direct using GST fused to the C-terminal 11 amino acids of JIP1 (GST-11aa). As shown in Fig. 5C, Klc1 binds to GST-11aa with a half-maximum binding approximately at 0.2 μm, which is similar to the JIP1-AβPP interaction (12Matsuda S. Yasukawa T. Homma Y. Ito Y. Niikura T.

In the presence of 1 μm JIP1, Klc1 binding to AID was detectable at 0.5 μm or above (Fig. 5D). Even 2 μm Klc1 (which is more than the concentration used to show saturated binding of Klc to AID by Kamal et al. (4Kamal A. Stokin G.B. Yang Z. Xia C.H. Goldstein L.S.

Thus, purified recombinant Klc1 does not bind to AβPP, whereas the Klc1·JIP1 or Klc1·JIP1·AβPP complexes are readily detectable.Here we show that AβPP does not directly bind Klc1 in three different systems: the yeast two-hybrid, transfected cell"
https://openalex.org/W2024513455,"Nutrient metals such as zinc are both essential to life and potentially toxic if overaccumulated by cells. Non-essential toxic metals like cadmium can enter cells through the uptake transporters responsible for nutrient metal acquisition. Therefore, in the face of ever changing extracellular metal levels, organisms tightly control their intracellular levels of nutrient metals and prevent accumulation of toxic metals. We show here that post-translational inactivation of the yeast Zrt1 zinc uptake transporter is important for zinc homeostasis. During the transition from zinc-limiting to zinc-replete growth conditions (i.e. zinc shock), the Zrt1 transporter is ubiquitinated, endocytosed, and subsequently degraded in the vacuole. To further understand this process at a molecular level, we mapped a region of Zrt1 required for ubiquitination and endocytosis in response to zinc to a domain located on the intracellular surface of the plasma membrane. This domain is a critical cisacting component of the metal signaling pathway that controls Zrt1 protein trafficking. Using mutant alleles defective for metal-responsive inactivation, we also show that Zrt1 inactivation may be an important mechanism for preventing cadmium uptake and toxicity in zinc-limited cells.

Using mutant alleles defective for metal-responsive inactivation, we also show that Zrt1 inactivation may be an important mechanism for preventing cadmium uptake and toxicity in zinc-limited cells. Outside of the laboratory, microorganisms generally live in environments that are nutrient limiting due to low initial nutrient availability or depletion caused by their own growth and/or by the growth of competing microbes (1Colwell R.R. J. Infect. Chemother. 2000; 6: 121-125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Nutrient availability can change abruptly as new food sources enter a cell's microenvironment. Thus, microbes in the wild are thought to experience a largely “feast or famine” existence of nutrient deficiency punctuated by pulses of increased nutrient levels. To deal with nutrient deficiency, many microbes have evolved with efficient nutrient uptake mechanisms that are induced by starvation conditions. Because these systems can be so highly expressed, cells must also have the ability to rapidly down-regulate uptake systems to prevent overaccumulation of potentially toxic nutrients (e.g. metal ions) during transitions in nutrient availability.The transition from limiting to replete conditions is very stressful to microbial cells because of the insult this transition imposes on cellular homeostasis. In fact, this may be one reason that vast numbers of microbes in environmental samples are present in a “viable but nonculturable” state, i.e. nutrient-limited cells isolated from the environment are unable to survive the stress of transfer to the nutrient-rich media routinely used in microbial research (1Colwell R.R. J. Infect. Chemother. 2000; 6: 121-125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 2Koch A.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 305-318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These issues are the subject of our ongoing studies of zinc homeostasis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In S. cerevisiae, zinc uptake is mediated primarily by the Zrt1 and Zrt2 zinc uptake transporters (3Zhao H. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23203-23210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 4Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). These proteins are members of the ZIP family of transporters that are involved in metal uptake in bacteria, fungi, plants, and mammals (5Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. Biometals. 2001; 14: 251-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Transcription of the ZRT1 and ZRT2 genes is highly induced under low zinc conditions so zinc-limited cells have high levels of latent zinc uptake activity (3Zhao H. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23203-23210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 4Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Therefore, when zinc-limited cells are resupplied with even low concentrations of zinc (e.g. 1 μm), large quantities of the metal are taken up by the cell, a condition that we refer to as “zinc shock” (6MacDiarmid C.W. Milanick M.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15065-15072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This laboratory condition likely mimics the rapid fluctuations in nutrient levels experienced by yeast cells when growing in the wild.The Zrc1 vacuolar zinc transporter plays an important role in tolerating zinc shock by sequestering excess zinc in the vacuole (6MacDiarmid C.W. Milanick M.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15065-15072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). A second possible mechanism for maintaining zinc homeostasis under zinc shock conditions is the post-translational inactivation of Zrt1 transport activity. Previous studies showed that following zinc treatment, Zrt1 is ubiquitinated on a lysine residue exposed on the cytosolic face of the plasma membrane, recruited into the endocytic pathway, and removed from the cell surface (7Gitan R.S. Luo H. Rodgers J. Broderius M. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28617-28624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 8Gitan R.S. Eide D.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This removal leads directly to a loss of Zrt1 uptake activity thereby preventing additional zinc uptake. Without this inactivation, we calculate that total cellular zinc levels could rise from less than 100 μm to nearly 100 mm within 1 h of treating a zinc-limited cell with zinc.The regulated endocytosis of plasma membrane proteins is a critical component of cellular responses to changing environmental conditions in eukaryotic microbes. In S. cerevisiae, for example, the Ste2 and Ste3 mating pheromone receptors are endocytosed in response to binding of their ligand (9Hicke L. Riezman H. Cell. 1996; 84: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 10Roth A.F. Davis N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 661-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Nutrient transporters such as the Fur4 uracil permease (11Volland C. Urban-Grimal D. Geraud G. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9833-9841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the Mal61 maltose permease (12Medintz I. Jiang H. Han E. Cui W. Michels C.A J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2245-2254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the Gap1 amino acid permease (13Stanbrough M. Magasanik B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 94-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) undergo endocytosis in response to changing growth conditions, nutrient content, or substrate availability. As with Zrt1, endocytosis of many of these proteins is triggered by the covalent attachment of the 76-residue ubiquitin protein to one or more lysine residues in their cytosolic domains (14Hicke L. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 107-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin contains a signal for endocytic internalization (15Shih S.C. Sloper-Mould K.E. Hicke L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) and thus mediates the recruitment of the modified target proteins into the endocytosis pathway.Ubiquitination of plasma membrane proteins occurs through a series of events starting with the conjugation of ubiquitin to the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme. Ubiquitin is then transferred to active site cysteines of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and then often to a cysteine residue of an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase. In the last step of the process, ubiquitin is conjugated to a lysine residue of the target protein by the E3 ligase directly or by an E2 enzyme assisted by an E3 protein. Analysis of these processes in yeast have implicated Ubc4 and Ubc5, two plasma membrane-localized E2 proteins, as playing important roles in regulated endocytosis of Zrt1, Ste2, Mal61, and others (8Gitan R.S. Eide D.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 9Hicke L. Riezman H. Cell. 1996; 84: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 16Medintz I. Jiang H. Michels C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34454-34462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 17Rotin D. Staub O. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Membrane Biol. 2000; 176: 1-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the Rsp5 E3 ubiquitin protein ligase has been found to be involved in the ubiquitination of these and many other plasma membrane proteins (17Rotin D. Staub O. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Membrane Biol. 2000; 176: 1-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given that many different target proteins are modified by apparently the same ubiquitination machinery, a key question is how specific proteins are targeted for modification while other potential targets are unaffected. Furthermore, very little is known about the signal transduction pathways by which environmental signals that trigger ubiquitination are sensed and how this signaling leads to altered ubiquitination. In this report, we build on our previous studies characterizing the mechanism of metal-induced Zrt1 inactivation. We have mapped a region of Zrt1 that is required for ubiquitination and endocytosis to occur. Furthermore, we address the physiological role of Zrt1 inactivation in zinc shock tolerance and cadmium resistance.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strains and Growth Conditions—Strains used were DY1457 (α ade6 can1 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3), ZHY3 (DY1457 zrt1::LEU2 zrt2::HIS3), DEY1531 (DY1457 end4::LEU2), MSYS1 (α ade6 can1 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3), MSYS2 (MSYS1 ZRT1K195R), MSYS3 (MSYS1 zrc1Δ), MSYS4 (MSYS1 ZRT1K195R zrc1Δ), and MKY1 (MSYS1 ZRT1 Δ 205 – 211). Yeast were grown in SD 1The abbreviations used are: SD, synthetic defined medium; HA, hemagglutinin. medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids) (18Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar) supplemented with auxotrophic requirements and 2% galactose to induce expression of ZRT1 from the GAL1 promoter or 2% glucose to repress this expression. This medium was made zinc limiting by adding 1 mm EDTA. Low zinc medium (LZM) (7Gitan R.S. Luo H. Rodgers J. Broderius M. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28617-28624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) was also used in some experiments. LZM is similar in composition to SD medium and contains 1 mm EDTA and 20 mm citrate as metal chelate buffers. CSD medium (19Lyons T.J. Gasch A.P. Gaither L.A. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Eide D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7957-7962Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), SD medium made zinc limiting by removal of the metal with Chelex-100 chelating resin, was also used. CSD does not contain strong chelators so the availability of added zinc in this medium is higher than in LZM. The basal concentration of zinc in CSD is 50–100 nm as determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Cell number in liquid cultures was determined by measuring the absorbance of the cell suspension at 600 nm (OD600) and converting to cell number with a standard curve.Plasmid and DNA Manipulations—Escherichia coli and yeast transformations were performed using standard methods. pOE1–3ET is an episomal plasmid that expresses a fully functional epitope-tagged (hemagglutinin antigen) wild-type allele of ZRT1 from the GAL1 promoter (4Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). All mutations were constructed in pOE1–3ET by overlap extension polymerase chain reaction (20Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6797) Google Scholar) and verified by DNA sequencing.Zrt1 Inactivation Assays—Mutant zrt1 zrt2 cells have essentially no detectable zinc uptake in the assay conditions used. Unless noted otherwise, ZRT1 was expressed from the GAL1 promoter. Cells grown to exponential phase (OD600 = 0.5–1) in SD galactose medium were harvested by centrifugation (5 min at 1000 × g) and resuspended in SD glucose medium to shut off expression of the GAL1 promoter. Cycloheximide (100 μg/ml) was also added to block new protein synthesis. Previous studies demonstrated that these treatments do not interfere with Zrt1 inactivation and eliminate the added complexity of zinc-responsive transcriptional control (7Gitan R.S. Luo H. Rodgers J. Broderius M. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28617-28624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Zrt1 inactivation was routinely induced by the addition of 2 mm ZnCl2. Although much lower concentrations (e.g. 1 μm) can trigger detectable inactivation, the higher concentration causes a greater response without loss of cell viability over the course of the assay (7Gitan R.S. Luo H. Rodgers J. Broderius M. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28617-28624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). At various times, cells were harvested and assayed for 65Zn uptake rates to assess plasma membrane Zrt1 activity. These assays were performed as described previously for iron uptake (21Eide D. Davis-Kaplan S. Jordan I. Sipe D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20774-20781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that 65ZnCl2 (Amersham Biosciences) and LZM prepared without EDTA (LZM-EDTA) were substituted for 59FeCl3 and LIMEDTA, respectively. Briefly, cells were harvested, washed three times in LZM-EDTA and resuspended in LZM-EDTA. Cells were then incubated for 5 min in LZM-EDTA plus 1 μm65Zn at 30 °C, collected on glass fiber filters (Schleicher and Schuell), and washed with 10 ml of ice-cold SSW (1 mm EDTA, 20 mm sodium citrate, pH 4.2). Cell-associated radioactivity was measured with a Packard Auto-Gamma 5650 γ-counter. For most alleles, uptake rates of cells at T o differed by ∼2-fold from experiment to experiment, perhaps due to stochastic differences in plasmid retention in each culture. Therefore, all data are normalized as % of T o.Immunoblot and Immunofluorescence Methods—Cells were grown to exponential phase (50-ml cultures, OD600 = 0.5–1), harvested by centrifuging 5 min at 1000 × g, and washed with an equal volume of distilled water. The cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml MIB (0.6 m mannitol, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4) plus protease inhibitors (1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm pepstatin A). Glass beads were added to a volume of 0.5 ml and the cells were disrupted by vortexing 5 × 1 min with incubation on ice for 1 min between vortexing. The homogenates were then centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and the pellet of unbroken cells was discarded. Zrt1 immunoblots were performed as described (22Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 471-510Google Scholar) using a monoclonal antibody specific to the HA epitope tag (12CA5, Roche Applied Science). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse (Pierce) was used as the secondary antibody and complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described previously (7Gitan R.S. Luo H. Rodgers J. Broderius M. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28617-28624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar).RESULTSThe Conserved Histidine-rich Motif Is Not Required for Zrt1 Inactivation—Like most ZIP family proteins, Zrt1 has eight predicted transmembrane domains (Fig. 1A). The region between transmembrane domains 3 and 4 (amino acids 153–218) contains the site of ubiquitination, Lys-195, in Zrt1 indicating that this loop is located on the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane. To identify additional cis-acting domains in Zrt1 required for inactivation by zinc, we examined other regions of the TM3–4 loop. Our initial focus on this region was because (a) at 66 amino acids, it is the largest predicted cytosolic loop in the protein, (b) Lys-195 is present in this domain, and (c) it contains numerous acidic and serine residues that have been implicated in controlling ubiquitination in other plasma membrane proteins (17Rotin D. Staub O. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Membrane Biol. 2000; 176: 1-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A series of four deletion mutations were generated spanning the TM3–4 loop, i.e. ZRT1 alleles Δ153–167, Δ168–182, Δ183–197, and Δ198–218 (deletion endpoints are indicated in Fig. 1B). When expressed from the GAL1 promoter in a zrt1 zrt2 mutant, deletions Δ153–167 (Δ1) and Δ168–182 (Δ2) had no uptake activity. Indirect immunofluorescence studies indicated that these proteins failed to localize to the cell surface and accumulated in an intracellular organelle, perhaps the endoplasmic reticulum (data not shown).Many ZIP members have a histidine-rich motif located in the TM3–4 loop (5Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. Biometals. 2001; 14: 251-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). In Zrt1, this sequence is... HDHTHDE... located within the endpoints of Δ153–167 (Fig. 1B). Given the high degree of conservation and the potential of this motif to bind zinc and serve as an intracellular zinc sensor, we assessed the function of the histidine-rich domain in zinc uptake and inactivation by zinc. The three histidines (His-159, His-161, and His-163) were substituted with glutamines, a relatively conservative change that would impair zinc binding, to generate allele ZRT13HQ. Michaelis-Menten constants derived from zinc uptake assays showed no significant effect of these mutations on the apparent Km of these proteins. In contrast, the maximum velocity of transport (V max) was reduced to about 30% of the wild type activity (Fig. 1C). This difference in V max could be explained by effects on protein localization; Zrt13HQ accumulated to similar levels as wild type but showed reduced plasma membrane localization and increased accumulation within intracellular organelles (data not shown).To test the effects of these mutations on Zrt1 inactivation by zinc, zrt1 zrt2 cells expressing wild type Zrt1 or the Zrt13HQ mutant from the GAL1 promoter were grown to exponential phase in SD galactose. Cells were then harvested and resuspended in fresh medium with 1 mm EDTA (–Zn), 10 μm ZnCl2, or 2 mm ZnCl2. At various times over a 2-h period, cells were harvested, washed, and assayed for initial 65Zn uptake rates to assess the level of Zrt1 protein remaining at the cell surface. When normalized for uptake activity at T o, both wild type and Zrt13HQ proteins showed identical profiles of inactivation by zinc at either 10 μm or 2 mm zinc (Fig. 1D). These data demonstrate that the histidine-rich motif of Zrt1 is important for Zrt1 function but does not play a major role in zinc sensing for inactivation.Mapping a Domain in Zrt1 Required for Zinc-responsive Inactivation—Both Δ183–197 (Δ3) and Δ198–218 (Δ4) retained full uptake activity but were not inactivated in response to zinc treatment (Fig. 2). The slight loss of uptake activity observed after zinc treatment in these mutants is similar to that seen in mutants that block endocytosis (e.g. end4) and therefore may reflect direct inhibition of uptake activity by the high intracellular zinc levels that accumulate in these cells (23Stein W.D. Channels, Carriers, and Pumps. An Introduction to Membrane Transport. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1990: 127-172Google Scholar). The Δ183–197 mutation deleted Lys-195. When a lysine residue (in the tripeptide KNG) was reintroduced into Δ183–197 (Δ3 + K), full zinc-responsive inactivation was restored suggesting that the ubiquitinated lysine is the only important residue in the deleted interval. The importance of amino acids 196 and 197 (.NG.) was not directly examined by additional deletion mutations. However, an N196D mutation isolated serendipitously during these studies had no effect on inactivation (data not shown).Fig. 2Deletion mapping of a potential metal response domain in Zrt1. ZHY3 (zrt1 zrt2) cells expressing wild-type or mutant Zrt1 from the GAL1 promoter were grown in SD galactose medium, harvested and resuspended in SD glucose medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide and 2 mm ZnCl2. At the indicated times, cells were harvested and assayed for 65Zn uptake rate. Results obtained with wild-type cells expressing wild-type Zrt1 treated with 1 mm EDTA (-Zn, □) and end4 mutants expressing wild-type Zrt1 treated with 2 mm ZnCl2 (end4, +Zn) are shown for comparison. Mutants shown are Δ183–197 (Δ3), Δ198–218 (Δ4), and Δ183–197 in which the tripeptide KNG was inserted into the deletion site (Δ3 + K). No statistically significant differences were observed in the T o uptake rates of these mutants relative to wild type and the standard deviations were less than 10% of the corresponding means.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)These results demonstrate that amino acids 198–218 are required for inactivation to occur. To more precisely map the required residues within this region, a series of smaller deletions were generated (Fig. 3A). This region was divided into three 7-amino acid subregions. Adding back single subregions into the Δ198–212 deletion interval indicated that no single subregion was capable of conferring Zrt1 inactivation (see Δ205–218, Δ198–204/212–218, Δ198–211, Fig. 3B). Adding back combinations of two of the three subdomains indicated that amino acids 205–218 were necessary for inactivation to occur (Fig. 3C), i.e. Δ212–218 and 205–211 were not zinc-responsive. The Δ198–204 mutant was inactivated normally indicating the deleted region is not involved.Fig. 3Fine mapping of the potential metal response domain. A, smaller deletions generated in the 198–218 interval are shown. ZHY3 (zrt1 zrt2) cells expressing wild-type or mutant Zrt1 from the GAL1 promoter were grown in S.D. galactose medium, harvested and resuspended in S.D. glucose medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide and 2 mm ZnCl2. At the indicated times, cells were harvested and assayed for 65Zn uptake rate. Results obtained with wild type Zrt1 treated with 1 mm EDTA (–Zn, □) are shown for comparison. B, samples are zinc-treated wild type (▪), Δ205–218 (a, •), Δ198–204/212–218 (b, ▴), Δ198–211(c, ▾). C, samples are zinc-treated wild-type (▪), Δ212–218 (d, ▾), Δ205–211 (e, •), and Δ198–204 (f, ▴). No statistically significant differences were observed in the T o uptake rates of these mutants relative to wild type and the standard deviations were less than 10% of the corresponding means.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To assess the importance of specific amino acids in the 205– 218 region in inactivation, polar or charged residues in the interval were substituted with alanine. Polar/charged residues were chosen because these are most likely to be surface exposed where they may participate in zinc sensing. Alanine substitutions were used because they are least likely to disrupt the overall structure of the domain (24Wertman K.F. Drubin D.G. Botstein D. Genetics. 1992; 132: 337-350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alanine substitutions in the 212–218 region (i.e. Q213A, S214A, Q216A, and Q218A) had no effect on zinc responsiveness (data not shown). Similarly, T207A also had no effect on inactivation (Fig. 4A). However, mutations D205A, S208A, M209A, and D210A caused defective inactivation. S208A was particularly severe in its effects being indistinguishable from the end4 mutant (Fig. 2) and the K195R mutation (8Gitan R.S. Eide D.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar).Fig. 4Alanine-scanning mutations in the metal response domain. A, ZHY3 (zrt1 zrt2) cells expressing wild-type or mutant Zrt1 from the GAL1 promoter were grown in SD galactose medium, harvested and resuspended in SD glucose medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide and 2 mm ZnCl2. At the indicated times, cells were harvested and assayed for 65Zn uptake rate. Results obtained with wild-type Zrt1 treated with 1 mm EDTA (–Zn, □) are shown for comparison. No statistically significant differences were observed in the T o uptake rates of these mutants relative to wild type and the standard deviations were less than 10% of the corresponding means. B, immunoblot of epitope-tagged wild type and mutant Zrt1. end4 mutant cells (DEY1531) expressing the indicated HA-tagged ZRT1 allele on pOE1–3ET were grown to exponential phase (OD600 = 0.5) in SD galactose medium. The cells were harvested and resuspended in SD glucose medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide and either 1 mm EDTA (–Zn) or 2 mm ZnCl2 (+Zn). After 40 min, the cells were harvested, protein prepared and analyzed by immunoblotting using an anti-HA antibody. The arrow indicates the modified form shown previously to be ubiquitinated Zrt1 (8Gitan R.S. Eide D.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The end4 strain was used to facilitate visualization of the Zrt1-ubiquitin complex that is normally degraded in wild type cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Mutations that block inactivation of Zrt1 may potentially block zinc-induced ubiquitination or prevent endocytosis of the transporter after ubiquitination has occurred. Immunoblot analysis of wild type and mutant Zrt1 proteins indicated that these mutations block ubiquitination of the protein in response to zinc (Fig. 4B). Ubiquitination of wild-type Zrt1 in cells treated with zinc for 40 min was observed while no ubiquitination was detected for the control K195R mutant as well as Zrt1 Δ205–211, and S208A. Moreover, the mutations predicted to block endocytosis were shown by indirect immunofluorescence to have this effect. Wild-type Zrt1 was retained on the plasma membrane in –Zn conditions, as indicated by the bright staining at the cell periphery, but was lost in zinc-treated cells (Fig. 5). Our previous studies indicated that this loss was due to zinc-induced endocytosis (7Gitan R.S. Luo H. Rodgers J. Broderius M. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28617-28624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In contrast, K195R, Δ205–211, and S208A alleles were retained on the cell surface even in zinc-treated cells. Taken together, the experiments in Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5 map a domain required for Zrt1 metal-responsive ubiquitination and subsequent endoctyosis.Fig. 5Immunofluorescence analysis of wild-type and mutant Zrt1 proteins. ZHY3 (zrt1 zrt2) cells expressing wild-type or mutant Zrt1 from the GAL1 promoter were grown in SD galactose medium, harvested and resuspended in SD glucose medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide and 1 mm EDTA (–), 2 mm ZnCl2 (+Zn), or 100 μm CdCl2 (+Cd). At time = 0 (To) or after 4 h treatment, cells were harvested and analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence using an anti-HA antibody. Cells not expressing the HA-tagged Zrt1 protein have very low levels of autofluorescence (Vector).

First, the entire loop between TM3 and TM4 (amino acids 153–218) was fused to the carboxyl-terminus of Pma1, the plasma membrane H+-ATPase. Pma1 is normally a stable plasma membrane protein and this fusion approach was successful in showing the sufficiency of domains from Ste6 and Ste3 in mediating the ubiquitination and endocytosis of these proteins (25Kolling R.

https://openalex.org/W2091112800,"Transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) regulates cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation in a variety of cells. Smad proteins are receptor-activated transcription factors that translocate to the nucleus in response to TGFbeta. We demonstrate here that TGFbeta increases cell adhesion in metastatic PC3-M prostate cancer cells. TGFbeta treatment of PC3-M cells leads to nuclear translocation of R-Smad proteins. We show that Smad proteins are necessary, but not sufficient, for TGFbeta-mediated cell adhesion. After showing that TGFbeta upregulated p38 MAP kinase activity in PC3-M cells, we show that inhibition of p38 MAP kinase partially blocked TGFbeta-mediated increase in cell adhesion, as well as nuclear translocation of Smad3. Finally, we show that Smad3 is phosphorylated by p38 MAP kinase in vitro. These findings implicate crosstalk between the MAP kinase and Smad signaling pathways in TGFbeta's regulation of cell adhesion in human prostate cells. This represents a mechanism by which the pleiotropic effects of TGFbeta may be channeled to modulate cell adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W2047449232,"Increased histone acetylation has been associated with activated gene transcription and decreased acetylation with repression. However, there is a growing number of genes known, which are downregulated by histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors through unknown mechanisms. This study examines the mechanism by which the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter is repressed by the HDAC inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA). We find that this repression is transcriptional in nature and that it occurs in the presence and absence of glucocorticoids. TSA decreases MMTV transcription at a rapid rate, reaching maximum in 30–60 min. In contrast with previous reports, the repression does not correlate with an inhibition of glucocorticoid-induced nuclease hypersensitivity or NF1-binding at the MMTV promoter. Surprisingly, TSA does not induce sizable increases in histone acetylation at the MMTV promoter nor does it inhibit histone deacetylation, which accompanies deactivation of the glucocorticoid-activated MMTV promoter. Repression of MMTV transcription by TSA does not depend on the chromatin organization of the promoter because a transiently transfected MMTV promoter construct with a disorganized nucleoprotein structure was also repressed by TSA treatment. Mutational analysis of the MMTV promoter indicates that repression by TSA is mediated through the TATA box region. These results suggest a novel mechanism that involves acetylation of nonhistone proteins necessary for basal transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2084248702,"A common signature of many cancers is a high glucose catabolic rate frequently dependent on the overexpression of Type II hexokinase (HKII), a mitochondrial bound enzyme that also suppresses cell death. As the tumor HKII promoter plays a significant role in HKII overexpression, studies reported here were undertaken to identify both the major regions and transcription factors involved under tumor-like conditions. Reporter gene assays following transfection of hepatoma cells with decreasing segments of the HKII promoter traced its known strength to the proximal region (–281 to –35). Mutational analyses showed that in this short region GC boxes 1, 2, 5, and 6, a CCAAT box, an inverted CCAAT box, and CRE are involved in promoter activation. Other studies demonstrated binding of transcription factors Sp1, Sp2, and Sp3 to GC boxes 1 and 6, Sp1 and Sp2 to GC boxes 2 and 5, NF-Y to CCAAT boxes, and CREB, ATF1, and CREM to CRE. In addition, transfection studies involving Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, CREB, and NFY (dominant negative form) provided evidence that these proteins are promoter activators. Finally, alignment of available HK proximal promoters showed strong conservation only among HKII sequences.

Thus, HKII has multifunctional roles in cancer, i.e. to enhance glycolytic ATP production, particularly under hypoxic conditions, to enhance biosynthesis, and to help immortalize the cell population. For these reasons, and the fact that the most common technique (positron emission tomography) used for cancer detection (15Patronas N.J. Di Chiro G. Kufta C. Bairamian D. Kornblith P.L. Simon R.

Among these events, gene amplification (21Rempel A. Mathupala S.P. Griffin C.A. Hawkins A.L. Pedersen P.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2468-2471PubMed Google Scholar) and promoter activation (11Mathupala S.P. Rempel A. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol.

In the model highly glycolytic hepatoma cell line studied, i.e. the AS-30D (6Bustamante E. Pedersen P.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3735-3739Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 25Smith D.F. Walborg Jr., E.F. Chang J.P. Cancer Res. 1970; 30: 2306-2309PubMed Google Scholar), the HKII gene is amplified at least 5-fold relative to control hepatocytes in which HKII is barely detectable (21Rempel A. Mathupala S.P. Griffin C.A. Hawkins A.L. Pedersen P.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2468-2471PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, transfection of the hepatoma cells with the HKII promoter (4.3 kilobase pairs), isolated from the same cells, shows that various metabolites activate the promoter 1.3–3.6-fold relative to a pyruvate or lactate background in a medium deficient in glucose and lacking serum (11Mathupala S.P.

Activators include glucose, insulin, glucagon, dibutyryl cAMP, p53, the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, and hypoxic conditions. Notably, it is glucose rather than a downstream glycolytic intermediate that is the promoter activator (20Rempel A. Mathupala S.P. Pedersen P.L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and synergy results when either dibutyryl cAMP or hypoxic conditions are used together with glucose (20Rempel A.

Chem. 2001; 276: 43407-43412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). In our most recent study, we have found also that in hexokinase-deficient hepatocytes the promoter for HKII is methylated within a CpG island that includes the transcription start site but is hypomethylated in hexokinase-abundant hepatoma cells (24Goel A. Mathupala S.P. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15333-15340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). As transfected hepatocytes, in contrast to transfected hepatoma cells, fail to result in HKII promoter activation in those cases tested (11Mathupala S.P. Rempel A. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16918-16925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), this suggests that demethylation events within the region of the proximal promoter may be a prerequisite for its activation by some transcription factors. Studies reported here were undertaken to gain greater insight into activation of the HKII promoter under more tumor-like conditions (i.e. availability of serum and glucose) than those used in previous studies (11Mathupala S.P. Rempel A. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16918-16925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 20Rempel A. Mathupala S.P. Pedersen P.L.

Specifically, we wanted to identify under such conditions which region of the promoter that makes the major contribution to its activation and identify also the major transcription factors involved. This contrasts with our previous work on the promoter described above that used media deficient in glucose and lacking serum to assess the contributions of individual metabolic agents to promoter activation (11Mathupala S.P. Rempel A. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16918-16925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 20Rempel A. Mathupala S.P. Pedersen P.L.

In the study reported here, the post-transfection incubation medium contained both a serum supplement and glucose to provide an environment that more closely resembles that of a hepatoma cell located in a well vacularized tumor or within the peritoneal cavity. Significantly, serum is rich in hormones and other growth factors that initiate signal transduction pathways, the end products of which may modulate HKII promoter activity. Results of studies presented below show that under these tumor-like conditions the remarkable strength of the Type II hexokinase promoter resides within a short segment (–281 to –35) of the proximal region where a number of transcription factors known to be linked to signal transduction pathways are involved. Animals, Cell Lines, and Cell Media—Female Sprague-Dawley rats (100–150 g) were purchased from Charles River Breeding Laboratories. Their care and use were approved by the Johns Hopkins University Animal Care and Use Committee. AS-30D hepatoma cells (25Smith D.F. Walborg Jr., E.F. Chang J.P. Cancer Res. 1970; 30: 2306-2309PubMed Google Scholar) exhibiting a high glycolytic rate (6Bustamante E. Pedersen P.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For reporter gene assays, cells were first purified and transfected in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen), and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium also containing 10% FBS, 15 mm glucose, and an antibiotic-antimycotic mixture (Invitrogen). Schneider Drosophilia S2 (SL2) cells were grown at 25 °C in Schneider's medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Invitrogen) Promoter Constructs and Expression Plasmids—Preparation of the HKII promoter-luciferase construct containing the rat hepatoma 4.3-kilobase pair promoter (–4369 construct) has been described (11Mathupala S.P. Rempel A. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16918-16925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Some 5′ deletion constructs (–3036, –2072, –1072, +75) were generated as described (23Mathupala S.P. Rempel A. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43407-43412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) while other 5′ deletion constructs (–482, –329, and –157) were generated using restriction enzymes (PstI, BclI, and SacII, respectively), T4 DNA polymerase, and T4 DNA ligase (all from New England Biolabs). Additional 5′ deletion constructs (–281, –179, –89, and –35) were generated by PCR using oligonucleotides derived from the HKII promoter sequence (Table I) and the same reverse primer (TCGGGGTCGAGTAGAGAAA). PCR was performed using the Expand™ high fidelity PCR system (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR cycles consisted of an initial 3-min denaturation step at 94 °C, followed by 30 cycles with 30 s denaturation at 94 °C, 30 s annealing at 55 °C, and 60 s extension at 72 °C, except for the last cycle involving a 10-min extension step. Using the KpnI/XhoI restriction sites, PCR products were inserted into the pGL2-Basic vector (Promega) that contains the gene for luciferase. The expression plasmids pPacO and pPacSp1 were provided by Dr. R. Tjian, University of California, Berkeley, and pPac-HA-Sp1-(1–293), pPac-HA-Sp2, and pPac-HA-Sp3 were from Dr. H.

The anti-CREB antibody (C-8977) was from Sigma, and the polyclonal antibody against NF-YB from Dr. R. Mantovani. Site-directed Mutagenesis of the HKII Promoter—To generate the site-specific mutants mE2F, mGC1, mGC2, mGC3, mInvCCAAT, and mGC4 that contain mutations in potential regulatory elements within the proximal sequence of the HKII promoter, the –329 deletion construct was utilized as a template. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Clontech Transformer™ site-directed mutagenesis kit. A sequence (CCCGGGAGGTACCTAGCTCTTACGCGG) containing a mutated SacI site (in bold) was used as a primer to select mutant plasmids. Mutagenic primers for these site-specific mutants are listed in Table I. Template plasmids were denatured and annealed with primers, followed by synthesis, ligation, and transformation into the Escherichia coli BMH71-18 mutS strain. Plasmids were isolated, digested with SacI (New England Biolabs), and then transformed and isolated for sequencing. To generate other site-specific mutants (mCCAAT, mGC5, mCRE, and mGC6), PCR was performed using forward primers (Table I) and the same reverse primer (TCGGGGTCGAGTAGAGAAA) as described above. PCR fragments were inserted into the pGL2-basic vector using the KpnI/XhoI restriction sites. All site-specific mutants were confirmed by sequencing. Transient Transfections and Reporter Gene Assays—Transient transfections of AS-30D hepatoma cells with either the deletion or site-specific mutants, and the pSV-β-Gal plasmid, a β-galactosidase vector (Promega), were carried out by electroporation using a modified version of an earlier procedure (11Mathupala S.P. Rempel A. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16918-16925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA for transfection was purified using the Qiagen plasmid maxi kit (Qiagen, Inc). Molar amounts equal to 10 μg of the full-length promoter-luciferase reporter gene construct (–4369 construct) were used for all deletion constructs including the site-specific mutants, pGL2-basic vector (no promoter), and pSV-Luci vector containing the luciferase gene under control of the SV40 promoter/enhancer (pGL2 control from Promega). The β-galactosidase vector (15 μg) was used for normalization of transfection efficiency. AS-30D hepatoma cells (10 × 106), mutants, and the β-galactosidase vector in 0.5 ml per transfection were incubated in RPMI 1640 medium at 25 °C for 5–10 min and subjected to electroporation at 220 V and 1180 microfarads in a Cell Porator electroporator (Invitrogen). After an additional 10-min incubation, the transfected AS-30D hepatoma cells were plated into 5 ml of pre-warmed Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (37 °C, 5% CO2) containing also 10% FBS, 15 mm glucose, and an antibioticantimycotic mixture. Cells were incubated for 20–24 h, harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and extracted with 100 μl of 1× Reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were assayed as described below, and the luciferase activity of each sample normalized with respect to β-galactosidase activity. For transient co-expression in AS-30D hepatoma cells of the plasmids NF-YA, a dominant negative NF-YA (DN-NF-YA), A-CREB, or CREB, cells were transiently co-transfected with 6.2 μg of the –329 deletion construct of the HKII promoter, variable amounts (0–20 μg) of the expression plasmids noted above, and 15 μg of the β-galactosidase vector. Empty vectors were added to equalize the total amount of DNA in each case. The transient transfection procedure was the same as described above and enzyme assays were the same as described below. For transfection of Drosophila SL2 cells, the cells were plated onto 60-mm2 dishes at a density of 5 × 106 cells/3 ml of media. Cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method (27DiNocera P.P. Dawid I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7095-7098Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) with 0.2 μg of the –281 construct, and variable amounts (0–10 μg) of the expression plasmids pPacSp1, pPac-HA-Sp1-(1–293), pPac-HA-Sp2, or pPac-HA-Sp3. Their empty vector pPacO was added to equalize the total amount of DNA in each case. The cells were harvested after incubation for 3 days. Luciferase was measured and normalized by total protein concentration determined by the Coomassie binding assay (Bio-Rad). Assays for Luciferase and β-Galactosidase—Assays were performed essentially as described by the suppliers (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured in a TD-20e luminometer (Turner Designs Inc.) at 25 °C by adding 10 μl of cell lysate to 100 μl of assay reagent (470 μm luciferin, 530 μm ATP, 270 μm CoA, 2.67 mm MgSO4, 1.07 mm (MgCO3)4Mg(OH)2·5H2O, 33 mm DTT, and 0.1 m EDTA, pH 7.8) and recording arbitrary light units. For measurement of β-galactosidase activity, cell lysates (15–30 μl) were mixed with 150 μl of 2× β-galactosidase assay reagent (1.33 mg/ml o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, 120 mm Na2HPO4, 80 mm NaH2PO4, 2 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.4) in a total volume of 300 μl. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 3–8 h and quenched by adding 700 μl of 1 m Na2CO3. The activity of β-galactosidase was measured at 420 nm using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences λ3B spectrophotometer. The luciferase activity was normalized for each sample by dividing by the β-galactosidase activity. The normalized activity of the –4369 construct or indicated construct was represented as 100%, whereas that of other constructs was compared with the –4369 or indicated construct. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—Nuclear extracts were prepared from nuclei isolated from AS-30D hepatoma cells as described (28Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar) and stored at –80 °C. Cells were washed first with RPMI 1640 medium followed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline, after which they were suspended in buffer A (10 mm HEPES, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.9), incubated on ice for 10 min, and sedimented at 1,000 × g for 10 min. The packed cells were then suspended in buffer A, lysed, and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded and the nuclear pellets were centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 30 min, suspended in buffer C (20 mm HEPES, 400 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 25% glycerol, pH 7.9), and extracted for 30 min at 4 °C by constant gentle mixing followed by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 30 min. Then, the supernatant was dialyzed for4hat4 °C against buffer D (20 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20% glycerol, pH 7.9). The dialysate was cleared by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, resulting in the final nuclear extract. Protein was determined by the Coomassie binding assay (Bio-Rad). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—The EMSA was performed using oligonucleotides summarized in Table II. First, 5 pmol were end-labeled in a final volume of 20 μl containing 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and 5 μl of [γ-32P]dATP (6000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Then, ∼5 fmol of 32P-labeled oligonucleotides (∼100,000 cpm) was incubated for 30 min at 25 °C with 10 μg of nuclear extract in 10 μl of binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, 50 mm KCl, 6.25 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20% glycerol, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), pH 7.9). For competitions, unlabeled DNA was incubated with the nuclear extracts at 4 °C for 30 min, followed by incubation for 30 min at 25 °C after adding labeled oligonucleotides. For supershift analysis, antibody (0.5–2 μg) was incubated with the nuclear extracts at 4 °C for 30 min in binding buffer, followed by an additional incubation for 30 min at 25 °C with adding labeled oligonucleotides. For supershift analysis in the presence of a mutant competitor, antibody and competitor were added simultaneously. Bound and free DNA were resolved by electrophoresis at 100 V in a 4% polyacrylamide gel in a buffer containing 6.7 mm Tris-HCl, 3.3 mm sodium acetate, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.9. After drying, gels were subjected to autoradiography at –70 °C with intensifying screens on Hyperfilm™ ECL™ film (Amersham Biosciences).Table IIOligonucleotides used in electrophoretic mobility shift assaysOligonucleotideSequenceGC1-F5′ CGCCCGGCTCCGCCCCTAGCCT 3′GC1-R3′ GCGGGCCGAGGCGGGGATCGGA 5′mGC1-F5′ CGCCCGGa T t C a CCCCTAGCCT 3′mGC1-R3′ GCGGGCCt A a G t GGGGATCGGA 5′GC2-F5′ GCGTCTCTCCCGCCGCCTGCTT 3′GC2-R3′ CGCAGAGAGGGCGGCGGACGAA 5′mGC2-F5′ GCGTCTCTCC tcga GCCTGCTT 3′mGC2-R3′ CGCAGAGAGG agct CGGACGAA 5′GC5-F5′ AATGAGCGCGCCCACGTCAC 3′GC5-R3′ TTACTCGCGCGGGTGCAGTG 5′mGC5-F5′ AATGAGC a C t CCCACGTCAC 3′mGC5-R3′ TTACTCG t G a GGGTGCAGTG 5′GC6-F5′ CTGTCTTGGGCGGCCCAAAGAG 3′GC6-R3′ GACAGAACCCGCCGGGTTTCTC 5′mGC6-F5′ CTGTCTa G at C ga CCCAAAGAG 3′mGC6-R3′ GACAGAt C ta G ct GGGTTTCTC 5′CCAAT-F5′ TCCCGCAGCCAATGAGCGCGC 3′CCAAT-R3′ AGGGCGTCGGTTACTCGCGCG 5′mCCAAT-F5′ TCCCGCA tagt ATGAGCGCGC 3′mCCAAT-R3′ AGGGCGT atca TACTCGCGCG 5′InvCCAAT-F5′ CTGGGCGCTGATTGGCTGTGGA 3′InvCCAAT-F3′ GACCCGCGACTAACCGACACCT 5′mInvCCAAT-F5′ CTGGGCGCT cgag GGCTGTGGA 3′mInvCCAAT-R3′ GACCCGCGA gctc CCGACACCT 5′CRE-F5′ GAGCGCGCCCACGTCACTGTCTTG 3′CRE-R3′ CTCGCGCGGGTGCAGTGACAGAAC 5′mCRE-F5′ GAGCGCGCCCt C t TCACTGTCTTG 3′mCRE-R3′ CTCGCGCGGG a G a AGTGACAGAAC 5′ Open table in a new tab Western Blot Analysis—AS-30D hepatoma cell extracts were prepared in lysis buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, and 10% glycerol, pH 6.8), subjected to electrophoresis on 12% polyacrylamide gels in the presence of SDS, and blotted electrically onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) in CAPS buffer (10 mm CAPS and 10% (v/v) methanol, pH 11).

https://openalex.org/W2053560526,"We have reported a novel functional co-operation among MyoD, myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2), and the thyroid hormone receptor in a muscle-specific enhancer of the rat GLUT4 gene in muscle cells. Here, we demonstrate that the muscle-specific enhancer of the GLUT4 gene operates in skeletal muscle and is muscle fiber-dependent and innervation-independent. Under normal conditions, both in soleus and in extensor digitorum longus muscles, the activity of the enhancer required the integrity of the MEF2-binding site. Cancellation of the binding site of thyroid hormone receptor enhanced its activity, suggesting an inhibitory role. Muscle regeneration of the soleus and extensor digitorum longus muscles caused a marked induction of GLUT4 and stimulation of the enhancer activity, which was independent of innervation. During muscle regeneration, the enhancer activity was markedly inhibited by cancellation of the binding sites of MEF2, MyoD, or thyroid hormone receptors. Different MEF2 isoforms expressed in skeletal muscle (MEF2A, MEF2C, and MEF2D) and all members of the MyoD family had the capacity to participate in the activity of the GLUT4 enhancer as assessed by transient transfection in cultured cells. Our data indicate that the GLUT4 enhancer operates in muscle fibers and its activity contributes to the differences in GLUT4 gene expression between oxidative and glycolytic muscle fibers and to the GLUT4 up-regulation that occurs during muscle regeneration. The activity of the enhancer is maintained in adult muscle by MEF2, whereas during regeneration the operation of the enhancer depends on MEF2, myogenic transcription factors of the MyoD family, and thyroid hormone receptors.

The GLUT4 glucose transporter gene is expressed mainly in muscle and adipose cells. GLUT4 expression is exquisitely regulated in skeletal muscle so that its level determines the whole-body glucose disposal in response to insulin. GLUT4 is differentially expressed in oxidative and glycolytic muscle fibers in the rat (1Kern M. Wells J.A. Stephens J.M. Elton C.W. Friedman J.E. Tapscott E.B. Pekala P.H. Dohm G.L. Biochem.

In addition, agonists of AMP-activated protein kinase enhance GLUT4 transcription in a muscle fiber-dependent manner (13Buhl E.S. Jessen N. Schmitz O. Pedersen S.B. Pedersen O. Holman G.D. Lund S. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 12-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 14Zheng D. MacLean P.S. Pohnert S.C. Knight J.B. Olson A.L. Winder W.W. Dohm G.L. J. Appl.

As to the regulation of GLUT4 gene transcription, different studies performed in transgenic mice have shown that a 5′-flanking region of 1154 bp in the GLUT4 gene is sufficient to drive muscle-, heart-, and adipose tissue-specific GLUT4 expression (15Liu M.L.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23491-23495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition, several regulatory elements have been identified within this region. Initial studies performed in cultured muscle cells identified the region -522/-402 as necessary for muscle-specific expression and a myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) 1The abbreviations used are: MEF2, myocyte enhancer factor-2; EDL, extensor digitorum longus; TRα1, thyroid hormone receptor; TRE, thyroid hormone receptor element; MRF, myogenic regulatory factor; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; TK, thymidine kinase; T3, triiodothyronine.-binding site that was critical for its transcriptional activity (17Liu M.L.

Disruption of this MEF2-binding site ablated tissue-specific GLUT4 expression in transgenic mice (18Thai M.V. Guruswamy S. Cao K.T. Pessin J.E. Olson A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14285-14292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been suggested that the transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator activator protein-γ co-activator-1 participates in GLUT4 gene transcription by interacting with MEF2 transcription factors (19Michael L.F. Wu Z. Cheatham R.B. Puigserver P. Adelmant G. Lehman J.J. Kelly D.P. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3820-3825Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). The Krüppel-like factor, KLF15, binds to a site near the MEF2-binding element and induces GLUT4 gene expression in 3T3-L1 cells (20Banerjee S.S. Feinberg M.W. Watanabe M. Gray S. Haspel R.L.

Another relevant region is located at -742/-712 relative to the transcription initiation site. Different factors such as NF1 (nuclear factor I) (21Cooke D.W. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12917-12924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and a partially characterized protein (22Oshel K.M. Knight J.B. Cao K.T. Thai M.V. Olson A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23666-23673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) bind to this region. NF1 seems to participate in the effects of insulin on GLUT4 gene expression in adipose cells (21Cooke D.W. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12917-12924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and the uncharacterized protein binding activity seems to interact with the MEF2-binding site mentioned previously (22Oshel K.M. Knight J.B. Cao K.T. Thai M.V. Olson A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23666-23673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In addition, a region located between -125 and -112 of the mouse promoter has been reported to bind a 96-kDa protein, which seems to act as a repressor selectively in pre-adipocytes but not in adipocytes (23Yokomori N. Tawata M. Onaya T. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2471-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We have reported tripartite co-operation between MyoD, MEF2, and the thyroid hormone receptor (TRα1) that takes place in the context of an 82-bp muscle-specific enhancer in the rat GLUT4 gene (at -502/-420), which is active in both cardiac and skeletal muscle (24Santalucia T. Moreno H. Palacin M. Yacoub M.H. Brand N.J. Zorzano A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In the L6E9 skeletal muscle cell line and in 10T1/2 fibroblasts, a powerful synergistic activation of the GLUT4 enhancer relied on the over-expression of MyoD, MEF2, and TRα1 and the integrity of their respective binding sites. This is in keeping with the capacity of the E-box and the thyroid response element (TRE) present in the enhancer to bind MyoD and thyroid hormone receptors (24Santalucia T. Moreno H. Palacin M. Yacoub M.H. Brand N.J. Zorzano A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 25Torrance C.J. Usala S.J. Pessin J.E. Dohm G.L. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1215-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have shown that in 10T1/2 fibroblasts, the forced over-expression of MyoD, MEF2, and TRα1 induces the expression of the endogenous, otherwise silent, GLUT4 gene (24Santalucia T. Moreno H. Palacin M. Yacoub M.H. Brand N.J. Zorzano A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In this study, we provide evidence that the -502/-420 enhancer acts in skeletal muscle under in vivo conditions and that its activity depends on the muscle fiber context, is upregulated during muscle regeneration, and is independent of innervation. Reporter and Expression Vectors—The -502/-420 TKCAT and the -502/-420-pGL3-luciferase reporter constructs were obtained by the annealing of three overlapping pairs of synthetic oligonucleotides that encompassed the DNA sequence, comprising positions -502 to -420 in the rat GLUT4 5′-flanking region. The oligonucleotides flanking the enhancer were designed so that upon annealing, cohesive BamHI ends would be incorporated into both ends of the reconstituted enhancer to allow the cloning into the BamHI-digested TKCAT or luciferase reporter vectors. All oligonucleotides were purchased from MWG Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany). TKCAT, a gift from Dr. Nadal-Ginard (Cardiovascular Research Institute, New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY), is a reporter vector that allows the analysis of putative transcriptionally regulatory regions because of their effect on the basal transcription of the CAT gene driven by the -109/+51 region of the herpesvirus thymidine kinase gene (26Thompson W.R. Nadal-Ginard B. Mahdavi V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22678-22688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutant versions of the -502/-420 enhancer, which contained nucleotide substitutions in the sequence of putative binding sites for known transcription factors, were made by substituting, in the annealing reaction, a new pair of oligonucleotides containing the desired mutation for the wild type pair. The mutant forms of the enhancer were subsequently cloned into the same BamHI site of the TKCAT vector by the same method used for the wild type enhancer. The sequence and orientation of the insert in all constructs was confirmed by sequencing. The expression vectors for mouse MyoD, mouse myogenin, and rat muscle regulatory factor-4 (MRF4) were obtained from Dr. H. Weintraub (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle,WA), Dr. E. N. Olson (M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX), and Dr. S. F. Konieczny (Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN), respectively. The cDNA of human Myf5 obtained from ATCC was cloned into an eukaryotic expression vector. The expression vectors for TRα1 (pMT2-TRα1), MEF2A, MEF2C, and MEF2D were obtained from Dr. B. Nadal-Ginard (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA), Dr. P. Ruiz-Lozano (University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA), Dr. J. McDermott (York University, Toronto, Canada), and Dr. E.N. Olson (M. D. Anderson Cancer Center), respectively. Muscle Regeneration and Denervation—Muscle regeneration was induced in 200–250-g male Wistar rats by intramuscular injection of bupivacaine as described (27Vitadello M. Schiaffino M.V. Picard A. Scarpa M. Schiaffino S. Hum. Gene Ther. 1994; 5: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Denervation was produced by cutting the sciatic nerve high in the thigh. Transfection of Regenerating and Adult Muscles—Regenerating innervated or denervated soleus or extensor digitorum longus muscles were injected with plasmid DNA (50 μg) at day 3 after bupivacaine treatment as described (27Vitadello M. Schiaffino M.V. Picard A. Scarpa M. Schiaffino S. Hum. Gene Ther. 1994; 5: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that gene transfer efficiency is high after DNA injection at day 3, when the regenerating muscle is composed mostly of small myotubes, but is very poor after DNA injection at day 1, when only mononucleated myoblasts are present (27Vitadello M. Schiaffino M.V. Picard A. Scarpa M. Schiaffino S. Hum. Gene Ther. 1994; 5: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Muscles were removed at day 10 after injury (day 7 after transfection) and frozen in isopentane cooled in liquid nitrogen. Adult muscles were transfected by intramuscular injection of plasmid DNA (20 μg) followed by electroporation to increase gene transfer efficiency. The electroporation procedure was similar to that described by Mir et al. (28Mir L.M. Bureau M.F. Gehl J. Rangara R. Rouy D. Caillaud J.M. Delaere P. Branellec D. Schwartz B. Scherman D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4262-4267Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). Co-transfection of RSV-CAT or RSV-luciferase expression plasmids was used to normalize for transfection efficiency. Muscles were removed at day 7 after transfection and frozen in isopentane cooled in liquid nitrogen. Muscle extracts were obtained, and reporter gene activity (luciferase and CAT) was measured by standard procedures. All data were normalized for protein concentration on muscle extracts. Cell Culture and Transfections—The C3H10T1/2 cell line (10T1/2) was purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and cultured as described (29Viñals F. Fandos C. Santalucia T. Ferre J. Testar X. Palacin M.

Transfections with the CAT reporter vector included an Escherichia coli β-galactosidase expression vector (pON249) under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter (24Santalucia T. Moreno H.

Biol. 2001; 314: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity was measured in cytoplasmic extracts to determine the efficiency of transfection. Protein concentration was measured with the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). When T3 was administered to cells, medium containing T3-depleted serum was used. T3-depleted serum was prepared by anion-exchange chromatography as described (30Gosteli P.M. Harder B.A. Eppenberger H.M. Zapf J. Schaub M.C. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 1737-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Western Blotting—Western blotting was performed essentially as described (9Castelló A. Rodriguez-Manzaneque J.C. Camps M.

Twenty-five μg of membrane protein obtained from regenerating or control muscles was loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels to detect GLUT4 and the α1 subunit of the Na+-K+-ATPase. Proteins were detected by using specific antibodies. RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted using the acid guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method as described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (31Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63287) Google Scholar). All samples had an A 260/A 280 ratio above 1.8. After quantification, total RNA (30 μg) was denatured at 65 °C in the presence of formamide, formaldehyde, and ethidium bromide to allow the visualization of RNA. RNA was separated on a 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel and blotted on Hybond N filters. The RNA in gels and in filters was visualized with ethidium bromide by UV transillumination to ensure the integrity of RNA, to check the loading of equivalent amounts of total RNA, and to confirm proper transfer. Northern blot was performed as reported (4Castello A. Cadefau J. Cusso R. Testar X. Hesketh J.E. Palacin M. Zorzano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14998-15003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rat cDNA probe for GLUT4, a 2470-bp EcoRI fragment obtained from Dr. M. Birnbaum (University of Pennsylvania), was labeled with [32P]dCTP by random oligonucleotide priming. The Muscle-specific Enhancer of the GLUT4 Gene Operates in Skeletal Muscle under in Vivo Conditions and Is Muscle Fiber-dependent—We have previously reported that the -502/-420 enhancer regulates the transcriptional activity of the GLUT4 gene in muscle cells in culture (24Santalucia T. Moreno H. Palacin M. Yacoub M.H. Brand N.J. Zorzano A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Here, we studied the relevance of this enhancer under in vivo conditions in rat skeletal muscle. In initial studies, the -502/-420-TKCAT plasmid or the parental promoter vector (as a control) were transfected by electroporation into adult rat soleus (mainly composed of slow-twitch oxidative muscle fibers) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) (mainly composed of fast-twitch glycolytic muscle fibers) muscles. Our data indicate that the -502/-420 enhancer is operative under in vivo conditions both in soleus and in EDL muscles and the activity of the enhancer was about 7–11-fold that of the control vector (Fig. 1). The data also indicate that the enhancer activity was significantly higher in soleus muscle than in EDL (Fig. 1). Similar observations were obtained after transfection with a plasmid -502/-420-luciferase, i.e. the enhancer is operative in skeletal muscles, and soleus showed a greater activity than EDL muscles (data not shown). This is consistent with greater GLUT4 gene expression in soleus compared with EDL muscles (1Kern M. Wells J.A. Stephens J.M. Elton C.W. Friedman J.E. Tapscott E.B. Pekala P.H. Dohm G.L. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 397-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 2Camps M. Castello A. Munoz P. Monfar M. Testar X. Palacin M. Zorzano A. Biochem.

Muscle Regeneration Stimulates the Activity of the GLUT4 Enhancer—Damaged skeletal muscle is able to regenerate by activation of satellite cells. These cells are quiescent under basal conditions; however, their activation induced by trauma causes proliferation and further differentiation into myotubes and muscle fibers. The myogenic factors MyoD and Myf5 are induced early during muscle regeneration, whereas MRF4 and myogenin show a later induction (32Cornelison D. Wold B.J. Dev. Biol. 1997; 191: 270-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that during muscle regeneration, the activity of MEF2 is enhanced (33Akkila W.M. Chambers R.L. Ornatsky O.I. McDermott J.C. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). On this basis, we explored the impact of muscle regeneration on GLUT4 enhancer activity. To this end, we tested the enhancer activity in intact or regenerating soleus or EDL muscles at day 7 after bupivacaine injection. Transfection of the enhancer linked to the CAT reporter indicated a marked stimulation (5-fold stimulation) of transcriptional activity during regeneration (Fig. 2). Similar data were obtained when the GLUT4 enhancer was linked to a luciferase reporter, i.e. activity was enhanced 5-fold after muscle regeneration (data not shown). Muscle regeneration also promoted marked stimulation of the GLUT4 enhancer activity in EDL muscles (Fig. 2). The GLUT4 Enhancer Activity Is Independent of Muscle Innervation—Muscle denervation causes a marked repression of GLUT4 in skeletal muscles (7Block N.E. Menick D.R. Robinson K.A. Buse M.G. J. Clin. Investig. 1991; 88: 1546-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 8Coderre L. Monfar M.M. Chen K.S. Heydrick S.J. Kurowski T.G. Ruderman N.B. Pilch P.F. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 1821-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 9Castelló A. Rodriguez-Manzaneque J.C. Camps M. Pérez-Castillo A. Testar X. Palacín M. Santos A. Zorzano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5905-5912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we explored the effect of denervation in the activity of the GLUT4 enhancer. To this end, innervated or denervated soleus and EDL muscles were transfected by electroporation with the -502/-420-TKCAT plasmid and reporter activity was assayed at day 7 (Fig. 3). No significant differences were detected between innervated and denervated groups in either soleus or EDL muscles (Fig. 3). Under these conditions, GLUT4 expression was largely reduced by denervation in both muscle types (data not shown). We also explored the effect of denervation on enhancer activity in regenerating muscles. To this end, soleus or EDL muscles were induced to regenerate in the absence or presence of innervation. Reporter gene analyses in transfected muscles indicated that the activity of the enhancer was again independent of innervation in both soleus and EDL muscles (Fig. 3). Expression of GLUT4 in Regenerating Muscle—Based on the regulatory pattern of the GLUT4 enhancer, we explored the impact of muscle regeneration on GLUT4 expression. To this end, soleus and EDL muscles were induced to regenerate by bupivacaine injection in the absence or presence of innervation. At different times of initiation of regeneration, muscles were collected and GLUT4 protein and mRNA quantitated by Western and Northern blot. We also processed in parallel muscles from adult rats that were subjected to denervation for 7 days. Expression of GLUT4 protein was very low after 3 days of regeneration compared with adult levels (Fig. 4). GLUT4 protein markedly increased from day 3 to day 6 of regeneration and remained relatively stable from day 6 to day 10 (Fig. 4). Denervation did not prevent a robust induction of GLUT4 protein at day 6. However, denervation was associated to lower levels of GLUT4 expression during the regeneration period (Fig. 4). These effects were specific, and no substantial alteration of the α1 subunit of the Na+-K+-ATPase was detected under these conditions (Fig. 4). An induction of GLUT4 mRNA was also detected with regeneration, which was progressive during time, so that maximal levels were attained only at day 10 (data not shown). In addition, maximal levels of GLUT4 mRNA at day 10 of regeneration were markedly lower in the denervated group (data not shown). Thus, during muscle regeneration GLUT4 is markedly induced and whereas an initial GLUT4 induction wave is largely independent of innervation, at later times it becomes dependent on muscle innervation. Different Requirements of the Muscle-specific GLUT4 Enhancer in Adult and in Regenerating Muscles—We studied the active elements that were responsible for the activity of the enhancer in adult and in regenerating muscles. In some studies, we transfected soleus and EDL muscles with different mutant versions of the enhancer (i.e. mutations in the E-box, the MEF2-binding site, or the TRE). Analysis in cultured cells has demonstrated that the mutations used completely cancel the three binding sites (24Santalucia T. Moreno H. Palacin M. Yacoub M.H. Brand N.J. Zorzano A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Both in soleus and in EDL muscles from adult rats, we detected a similar profile of changes to the transcriptional output of the reporter (Fig. 5). Cancellation of the E-box did not alter the transcriptional activity of the enhancer in soleus or EDL muscles. In contrast, mutation of the MEF2-binding site caused a marked reduction of the activity of the enhancer both in soleus and in EDL muscles (Fig. 5). Mutation of the TRE doubled the transcriptional activity of the enhancer in soleus and EDL muscles (Fig. 5), suggesting that the thyroid hormone receptors may play a negative role in adult muscles. We also studied the requirements of the GLUT4 enhancer during muscle regeneration. To this end, we transfected innervated or denervated regenerating soleus or EDL muscles with the different mutant versions of the enhancer. Cancellation of the E-box or the TRE caused a marked reduction in the activity of the enhancer in innervated or denervated regenerating soleus or EDL muscles (Figs. 6 and 7), which is in contrast to what we found in adult muscle (Fig. 5). In keeping with the observations in adult muscle, mutation of the MEF2-binding site caused a marked reduction of the activity of the enhancer in innervated or denervated regenerating soleus or EDL muscles (Figs. 6 and 7).Fig. 7Effect of mutations in the E-box, MEF2, and TRE on the activity of the muscle enhancer in regenerating extensor digitorum longus muscle. EDL muscles from regenerating muscles were transfected in vivo with the -502/-420TK-CAT construct containing either the wild type enhancer (Enh) or mutated versions at the E-box, MEF2 box, or TRE together with a luciferase reporter plasmid as a transfection control. After 7 days of transfection, muscles were collected, extracts were obtained, and enzymatic activities were assayed. CAT activity was expressed as a percentage of wild type enhancer activity. Results are the mean ± S.E. from five observations/group. *, statistically significant difference compared with the wild type enhancer group, p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Different MEF2 Isoforms or MRF Myogenic Proteins Operate on the GLUT4 Enhancer—We have previously shown that MEF2A and MyoD transactivate the muscle-specific GLUT4 enhancer and that MEF2A synergizes with MyoD and TRα1 on the activity of the enhancer in muscle and non-muscle cells (24Santalucia T. Moreno H. Palacin M. Yacoub M.H. Brand N.J. Zorzano A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Based on the role of the E-box and the MEF2 element in the control of the activity of the muscle-specific GLUT4 enhancer in the muscle fiber under different conditions, we studied whether other MEF2 isoforms expressed in muscle, i.e. MEF2C and MEF2D (34Mora S. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16323-16328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), or other MRF myogenic factors, i.e. myogenin, Myf5, or MRF4, also transactivate the enhancer. In some studies 10T1/2 cells were transiently transfected with MEF2A, MEF2C, or MEF2D either alone or in combination with TRα1 and/or MyoD (Fig. 8A). MEF2A, MEF2C, and MEF2D behaved similarly when transfected on their own (3–4-fold induction) (Fig. 8A). In addition, all MEF2 isoforms synergized with MyoD and TRα1 (Fig. 8A). Under these conditions, MEF2C was most efficient in synergizing with TRα1 or with MyoD plus TRα1 (Fig. 8A). This was followed by MEF2A and MEF2D (Fig. 8A). We also tested whether co-transfection with different MEF2 isoforms could modify, through the generation of heterodimers, the functional tripartite cooperativity with MyoD or TRα1. Transfection of cells with expression vectors for MEF2A and MEF2D in the presence of MyoD and TRα1 activated the enhancer up to levels comparable with MEF2A, which were greater than the values obtained in the presence of MEF2D (Fig. 8B). Similarly, transfection with MEF2C and MEF2D in the presence of MyoD and TRα1 raised the enhancer activity up to values similar to those of the MEF2C group and again greater than the values of the MEF2D group (Fig. 8C). In other experimental series, we transiently co-transfected 10T1/2 cells with different combinations of cDNA expression vectors for members of the MyoD family of MRF, MEF2A, and TRα1. In some experiments we used MyoD or myogenin as MRF proteins and in other experiments MyoD or MRF4 (Fig. 9). Myogenin and MRF4 transfected on their own showed a moderate activation of the enhancer, which was comparable with the effect of MyoD (Fig. 9). Transfection of TRα1 caused a repression of the enhancer when cells were maintained in the absence of T3 (data not shown), whereas a substantial activation was detected in the presence of T3 (Fig. 9). In addition, and most importantly, both myogenin and MRF4 activated the enhancer synergistically with TRα1 and with TRα1 plus MEF2A (Fig. 9). The synergistic effect displayed by myogenin or MRFR4 was similar to that of MyoD (Fig. 9). Myf5 behaved similarly (data not shown). Furthermore, we examined whether the effects of myogenin synergizing with TRα1 in activating the enhancer were dependent on the integrity of the E-box, as we have previously reported for MyoD (24Santalucia T. Moreno H. Palacin M. Yacoub M.H. Brand N.J. Zorzano A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus, transient co-transfection studies were done using either a wild type or a mutated version of the enhancer plus a combination of expression vectors for the transcription factors. Data indicated that both the effects of myogenin or MyoD on the enhancer activity as well as the synergy between myogenin and TRα1 or MyoD and TRα1 were abolished by mutating the E-box (data not shown). Altogether, these data demonstrate that the integrity of the E-box is required for the effects of the MRF protein family on the activity of the muscle-specific GLUT4 enhancer and reveal the existence of the functional redundancy of the different members of the MRF family synergizing with MEF2 and TRα1 on the muscle-specific GLUT4 enhancer. The results of this study indicate that the muscle-specific GLUT4 enhancer located at -502/-420 operates under in vivo conditions in maintaining the expression of GLUT4 in skeletal muscle, contributes to the differences in GLUT4 expression detected in glycolytic and oxidative muscle fibers, and is activated in regenerating muscles under conditions in which GLUT4 is induced. In adult muscle, the activity of the enhancer requires an intact MEF2-binding site, and the TREs play an inhibitory role. However, during muscle regeneration, the MEF2 site, the E-box, and the TREs are crucial in maintaining a high activity. On the other hand, the activity of the enhancer is independent of muscle innervation both in adult muscle and during muscle regeneration. We have previously demonstrated that the muscle-specific GLUT4 enhancer is activated synergistically by MyoD, MEF2, and TRα1 in muscle and nonmuscle cells in culture and that this requires the integrity of the respective DNA-binding elements (24Santalucia T. Moreno H. Palacin M. Yacoub M.H. Brand N.J. Zorzano A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In addition, mutation of the MEF2-binding element or the TRE caused a reduction of transcriptional output in cultured cardiomyocytes (24Santalucia T. Moreno H. Palacin M. Yacoub M.H. Brand N.J. Zorzano A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that in adult skeletal muscle, under normal conditions, the activity of the muscle-specific GLUT4 enhancer is essentially maintained by the MEF2-binding element, and so cancellation of the element causes a major repression of activity. In addition, we have found that the enhancer is subjected to repression via the TRE, so that its cancellation doubles the activity of the enhancer. The relevance of the MEF2-binding site was also reported in a study using transgenic mice, in which a marked repression of the transcriptional activity driven by 895 bp of DNA encompassing the 5′-flanking region of GLUT4 gene was detected in adipose tissues or in muscles after mutation of the MEF2-binding site (18Thai M.V. Guruswamy S. Cao K.T. Pessin J.E. Olson A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14285-14292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). It is surprising to find that the TRE inhibits the activity of the enhancer under normal conditions in adult muscle because: on the one hand, the administration of T3 to rats is known to cause the induction of GLUT4 gene expression in certain muscle types (5Weinstein S.P. O'Boyle E. Haber R.S. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1185-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 6Torrance C.J. Devente J.E. Jones J.P. Dohm G.L. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1204-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar); in addition, the concentration of T3 in rat skeletal muscle lies within the nanomolar range (35Escobar-Morreale H.F. Obregon M.J. Escobar del Rey F. Morreale de Escobar G. Biochimie (Paris). 1999; 81: 453-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), i.e. high enough to activate to some degree thyroid hormone receptors. In any case, the reason that the muscle-specific GLUT4 enhancer remains inhibited through the TRE in skeletal muscle remains unexplained. In contrast with adult muscle, muscle regeneration caused a dramatic change in the mode of operation of the GLUT4 enhancer. Thus, during muscle regeneration, cancellation of the three elements detected previously, i.e. the MEF2-binding site, the E-box, and the TRE, blocked the activity of the enhancer, consistent with the idea that they play an stimulatory role under those conditions. The different pattern shown by the GLUT4 enhancer indicates that the E-box of the enhancer remains inactive in adult skeletal muscle, whereas it is operative in regenerating muscle. This is consistent with the low expression of MRFs in skeletal muscle during adult life (36Eftimie R. Brenner H.R. Buonanno A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 37Koishi K. Zhang M. McLennan I.S. Harris A.J. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 202: 244-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and with their induction during regeneration (32Cornelison D. Wold B.J. Dev. Biol. 1997; 191: 270-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). In addition, our data suggest a powerful inhibitory effect of the TRE in adult muscle and a stimulatory role during regeneration. A corollary of the activity profile of the muscle-specific GLUT4 enhancer is that its activity is low in adult skeletal muscle, under normal conditions, compared with the maximal potential activity that it can attain at high levels of the MRF transcription factors, MEF2, and TRα1. This suggests the possibility of major up-regulation of GLUT4 gene transcription via activation of this enhancer by an increase in the levels of expression or activity of such transcription factors. We have observed that the activity of the enhancer is greater in soleus than in EDL muscles, which helps to explain the differences in GLUT4 gene expression and gene transcription that exist between oxidative and glycolytic muscles (1Kern M. Wells J.A. Stephens J.M. Elton C.W. Friedman J.E. Tapscott E.B. Pekala P.H. Dohm G.L. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 397-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 2Camps M. Castello A. Munoz P. Monfar M. Testar X. Palacin M. Zorzano A. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 765-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 3Neufer P.D. Carey J.O. Dohm G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13824-13829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that the profile of changes in the activity of the enhancer in response to mutations in the E-box, MEF2 site, or TRE was similar in both muscle types. These data suggest that oxidative muscles show a greater activity of the muscle-specific GLUT4 enhancer than glycolytic muscles as a consequence of a greater activity of the MEF2-binding site. This is in keeping with observations indicating that the soleus muscle displays a greater expression of MEF2A and MEF2D and a lower phosphorylation level and greater activity than proteins obtained from gastrocnemius muscle (38Dunn S.E. Simard A.R. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Michel R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45243-45254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The damage of skeletal muscle triggers the activation of otherwise quiescent satellite cells. These are mononucleated stem cells that are situated between the basal lamina of the extracellular matrix and the plasma membrane of muscle fibers. After proliferation, satellite cells exit the cell cycle and fuse, forming multinucleated myotubes, which replace the damaged muscle fibers. We provide evidence that muscle regeneration induced after bupivacain treatment causes a dramatic induction of GLUT4 expression, which is consistent with the fact that GLUT4 is induced along with myogenesis in cultured cells (29Viñals F. Fandos C. Santalucia T. Ferre J. Testar X. Palacin M. Zorzano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12913-12921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 39Kaliman P. Viñals F. Testar X. Palacin M. Zorzano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19146-19151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). This finding coincides with a very strong stimulation of the muscle-specific GLUT4 enhancer relative to the intact muscle and with the functional operation of all three elements (MEF2, E-box, and TRE). We propose that under these conditions, the enhancer is activated via induction of myogenic MRFs (32Cornelison D. Wold B.J. Dev. Biol. 1997; 191: 270-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar, 40Zhou Z. Bornemann A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2001; 22: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and by activation of the MEF2 factors (33Akkila W.M. Chambers R.L. Ornatsky O.I. McDermott J.C. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In this regard, we have demonstrated that all members of the MRF protein family are equally able to cooperate functionally with MEF2 and thyroid hormone receptors in the context of the muscle-specific GLUT4 enhancer. Based on the fact that muscle regeneration recapitulates muscle development, it is possible that the muscle-specific GLUT4 enhancer participates in the progressive induction of GLUT4 that occurs during perinatal development in skeletal muscle (4Castello A. Cadefau J. Cusso R. Testar X. Hesketh J.E. Palacin M. Zorzano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14998-15003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Santalucia T. Camps M. Castelló A. Muñoz P.

Physiol. 1992; 263: E102-E106PubMed Google Scholar). It is well known that muscle denervation causes a dramatic repression of muscle GLUT4 gene expression (7Block N.E. Menick D.R. Robinson K.A. Buse M.G. J. Clin. Investig. 1991; 88: 1546-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 8Coderre L. Monfar M.M. Chen K.S. Heydrick S.J. Kurowski T.G. Ruderman N.B. Pilch P.F.

Physiol. 1998; 84: 1661-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In this study, we have clearly shown that muscle denervation is not detrimental to the activity of the muscle-specific GLUT4 enhancer either in soleus or in EDL muscles, but we have detected a trend to increased activity. In addition, during muscle regeneration, the lack of innervation at an early stage (day 6 of regeneration) did not prevent the induction of GLUT4 protein, whereas denervation caused a marked down-regulation of GLUT4 expression later on. Nevertheless, regenerating denervated muscles did not display any alteration in the activity of the muscle-specific GLUT4 enhancer. Taken together, these data indicate that the muscle-specific GLUT4 enhancer does not play a role in the down-regulation of GLUT4 gene expression that occurs during muscle denervation or the down-regulation that occurs late during muscle regeneration. Tsunoda et al. (44Tsunoda N. Maruyama K. Cooke D.W. Lane D.M. Ezaki O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 744-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) have mapped the region of the GLUT4 gene involved in the regulation of GLUT4 transcription by muscle denervation, which lies 3′ to position -423 (42Campbell C. Pang S. Rodnicki K.J. James D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: E102-E106PubMed Google Scholar) and is therefore outside of the muscle-specific GLUT4 enhancer. In summary, our study indicates that the muscle-specific GLUT4 enhancer operates at a low level in intact adult muscle. In addition, it constitutes a switch that turns on GLUT4 transcription under conditions associated with GLUT4 induction, such as during muscle regeneration, possibly during myogenesis, and in the early phases of the development of skeletal muscle, e.g. in situations characterized by a high expression of myogenic factors, MEF2, and thyroid hormone receptors. In adult skeletal muscle and under normal conditions, the enhancer operates at a low rate, driven by MEF2 transcription factors and inhibited by the TRE, and participates in the differences in GLUT4 gene expression between oxidative and glycolytic muscle fibers. In regenerating muscle, the enhancer operates at a high rate, driven by MEF2, MRFs, and thyroid hormone receptors. Under all of these conditions, the activity of the enhancer is independent of muscle innervation. We thank Robin Rycroft for editorial assistance."

https://openalex.org/W1973323477,"α-Synuclein is a presynaptic protein involved in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease. Pyk2/related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase (RAFTK) tyrosine kinase is an upstream regulator of Src family kinases in the central nervous system that is involved in α-synuclein phosphorylation. The present study reports the cloning and characterization of a novel adaptor protein, Pyk2/RAFTK-associated protein (PRAP), that specifically binds to Pyk2/RAFTK and inhibits α-synuclein tyrosine phosphorylation. PRAP contains a coiled-coil domain, a pleckstrin homology domain, and a SH3 domain; the SH3 domain binds to the proline-rich domain of Pyk2/RAFTK. PRAP was observed to be present throughout the brain, including substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons, in which it localized to the cytoplasm. PRAP was found to function as a substrate for Src family kinases, such as c-Src or Fyn, but not for Pyk2/RAFTK. Hyperosmotic stress induced phosphorylation of tyrosine 125 of α-synuclein via Pyk2/RAFTK, which acted through Src family kinases. Such phosphorylation was inhibited by PRAP expression, suggesting that PRAP negatively regulates α-synuclein phosphorylation following cell stress. In conclusion, PRAP functions as a downstream target for Pyk2/RAFTK and plays a role in α-synuclein phosphorylation. α-Synuclein is a presynaptic protein involved in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease. Pyk2/related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase (RAFTK) tyrosine kinase is an upstream regulator of Src family kinases in the central nervous system that is involved in α-synuclein phosphorylation. The present study reports the cloning and characterization of a novel adaptor protein, Pyk2/RAFTK-associated protein (PRAP), that specifically binds to Pyk2/RAFTK and inhibits α-synuclein tyrosine phosphorylation. PRAP contains a coiled-coil domain, a pleckstrin homology domain, and a SH3 domain; the SH3 domain binds to the proline-rich domain of Pyk2/RAFTK. PRAP was observed to be present throughout the brain, including substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons, in which it localized to the cytoplasm. PRAP was found to function as a substrate for Src family kinases, such as c-Src or Fyn, but not for Pyk2/RAFTK. Hyperosmotic stress induced phosphorylation of tyrosine 125 of α-synuclein via Pyk2/RAFTK, which acted through Src family kinases. Such phosphorylation was inhibited by PRAP expression, suggesting that PRAP negatively regulates α-synuclein phosphorylation following cell stress. In conclusion, PRAP functions as a downstream target for Pyk2/RAFTK and plays a role in α-synuclein phosphorylation. Parkinson's disease is a common disabling neurodegenerative disorder that can present as both familial and nonfamilial conditions. Abnormal aggregates of α-synuclein constitute the primary component of Lewy bodies, which represent a hallmark finding of Parkinson's disease (1Spillantini M.G. Schmidt M.L. Lee V.M.Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Jakes R. Goedert M. Nature. 1997; 388: 839-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (6166) Google Scholar). α-Synuclein is a soluble neuronal protein that is especially abundant in presynaptic terminals. It has been shown that α-synuclein knockout mice display a functional deficit in the nigrostriatal dopamine system (2Abeliovich A. Schmitz Y. Farinas I. Choi-Lundberg D. Ho W.H. Castillo P.E.

Furthermore, α-synuclein can directly bind to dopamine transporters and regulate dopamine turnover (3Lee F.J. Liu F. Pristupa Z.B. Niznik H.B. FASEB J. 2001; 6: 916-926Google Scholar). Such findings suggest that α-synuclein is involved in the modulation of synaptic vesicle release, which subsequently leads to dopaminergic neurotransmission regulation. Pyk2/RAFTK 1The abbreviations used are: RAFTK, related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase; PTK, protein-tyrosine kinase; PRAP, Pyk2/RAFTK-associated protein; CC, coiled-coil; PH, pleckstrin homology; SH3, Src homology 3; GST, glutathione S-transferase; SUMO, small ubiquitin-related modifier; HA, hemagglutinin. is a nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) that is expressed to a high degree in human brain, specifically in presynaptic terminals (4Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar, 5Avraham S. London R. Fu Y. Ota S.

Pyk2/RAFTK is activated by either stress signals or a variety of extracellular signals that elevate the intracellular calcium concentration, leading to neurotransmitter release (4Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar, 6Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A.

Science. 1996; 273: 792-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Recently, we have reported that activation of Pyk2/RAFTK tyrosine kinase induces α-synuclein phosphorylation via Src family kinases in response to cell stress (8Nakamura T. Yamashita H. Nagano Y. Takahashi T. Avraham S. Avraham H. Nakamura S. FEBS Lett. 2002; 521: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Both our group and another group have reported that with in vitro experiments, members of the Src family of PTK, which include c-Src and Fyn, phosphorylate α-synuclein at tyrosine residue 125 (9Nakamura T. Yamashita H. Takahashi T. Nakamura S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 1085-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 10Ellis C.E. Schwartzberg P.L. Grider T.L. Frink D.W. Nussbaum R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3879-3884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Pyk2/RAFTK lies upstream of Src family kinases in the signaling cascade by which cell stress induces tyrosine phosphorylation of α-synuclein (8Nakamura T. Yamashita H. Nagano Y. Takahashi T. Avraham S. Avraham H. Nakamura S. FEBS Lett. 2002; 521: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Such findings suggest that both extracellular signaling molecules and cell stress not only activate Pyk2/RAFTK but also regulate the phosphorylation state of α-synuclein. In an attempt to study the mechanisms involved in Pyk2/RAFTK-mediated α-synuclein phosphorylation, the yeast two-hybrid cloning system was used in the present study to identify proteins that interact with Pyk2/RAFTK. This work reports the identification of a novel Pyk2/RAFTK-associated protein (PRAP) that inhibits Pyk2/RAFTK kinase activity. The results of the present work suggest that PRAP is a downstream target for Pyk2/RAFTK that regulates α-synuclein tyrosine phosphorylation. Yeast Two-hybrid System and PRAP cDNA Cloning—The DNA fragment encoding the C-terminal proline-rich domain (amino acids 845-967) of the Pyk2/RAFTK protein was generated with PCR and subcloned into the yeast two-hybrid vector pAS2-1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), which was fused in-frame to the GAL4-binding domain (pAS2-Pyk2/RAFTK-C). The recombinant plasmid was introduced into the yeast strain HF7c; yeast cell expression of the Pyk2/RAFTK C terminus fusion protein was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-GAL4BD antibodies (Clontech). A human brain cDNA library contained in the yeast two-hybrid vector pACT2 was obtained (Clontech). The library DNA was introduced into the yeast strain expressing the Pyk2/RAFTK C terminus fusion protein, and transformants were selected by culture on SD/-Trp/-His/-Leu plates. Positive clones were detected by a β-galactosidase assay. To eliminate false positives, plasmid DNA from positive clones was purified, amplified, and retransformed into the yeast strain expressing the Pyk2/RAFTK C terminus fusion protein. The positive clones in this second screening were subjected to DNA sequencing. To obtain the full-length cDNA of the positive clone of interest, a library screening was performed as previously described (9Nakamura T. Yamashita H. Takahashi T. Nakamura S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 1085-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 11Yamashita H. Avraham S. Jiang S. London R. Van Veldhoven P.P. Subramani S. Rogers R.A. Avraham H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29897-29904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). A specific probe was generated by restriction digestion of the positive clone insert with EcoRI and PvuII. The DNA fragment was gel-purified and radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using a random primer labeling kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). With this probe, the human hippocampus cDNA library contained in the phage vector λZAPII (Stratagene) was screened via filter hybridization. Positive clones were isolated, plaque-purified, excised, subcloned into pBluescript-SK (Stratagene), and sequenced for both complementary strands. cDNA was obtained for the novel Pyk2/RAFTK target protein, PRAP. The coding region of PRAP cDNA was amplified by PCR using a Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and the following forward and reverse primers with the attached restriction enzyme sites BamHI and XhoI, respectively: 5′-CGC GGA TCC ATG CCC AAC CCC AGC AGC AC-3′ (F1) and 5′-CCG GGC TCG AGT CAA ATA TCA TAC ATC TCC-3′ (R1). The DNA fragment obtained from PCR (1080 bp) was subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) together with the HA tag sequence (pcDNA3-HA-PRAP). Vectors and Antibodies—Human cDNA encoding wild type and mutant (A53T, Y39F, Y125F, Y133F, and Y136F) α-synuclein were generated and subcloned into pcDNA3 vectors together with the Myc tag sequence (pcDNA3-Myc-α-synuclein) as previously described (8Nakamura T. Yamashita H. Nagano Y. Takahashi T. Avraham S. Avraham H. Nakamura S. FEBS Lett. 2002; 521: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Human cDNA encoding wild type and mutant (Y402F and K457R) Pyk2/RAFTK was generated and subcloned into pcDNA3 vectors together with the FLAG tag sequence (pcDNA3-FLAG-Pyk2/RAFTK) as previously described (8Nakamura T. Yamashita H. Nagano Y. Takahashi T. Avraham S. Avraham H. Nakamura S. FEBS Lett. 2002; 521: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). DNA corresponding to the FLAG tag sequence and the coding region of human c-Src and Fyn were subcloned into pcDNA3 vectors as previously described (9Nakamura T. Yamashita H. Takahashi T. Nakamura S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 1085-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Anti-FLAG (M2), anti-ubiquitin, and anti-GST antibodies were obtained from Sigma. Anti-HA (F-7 and Y-11), anti-Myc (9E10), anti-c-Src, and anti-SUMO antibodies as well as normal rabbit IgG were obtained (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA). In addition, an anti-phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) antibody (Tyr(P)-102) was purchased (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Anti-Pyk2/RAFTK and anti-α-synuclein antibodies were purchased (BD Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). Anti-rabbit IgG-Cy3 was obtained (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA). Anti-mouse IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate was also obtained (Molecular Probe, Eugene, OR). Anti-calbindin antibody was also purchased (Swant, Bellinzona, Switzerland). Biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG solution was obtained (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Cell Culture, Transfection, and Osmotic Stress Stimulation—COS7 cells were obtained (American Tissue Culture Collection). The cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and antibiotics. The expression vectors were transfected into COS7 cells with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) as previously described (8Nakamura T. Yamashita H. Nagano Y. Takahashi T. Avraham S. Avraham H. Nakamura S. FEBS Lett. 2002; 521: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 9Nakamura T. Yamashita H. Takahashi T. Nakamura S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 1085-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 12Nagano Y. Yamashita H. Nakamura T. Takahashi T. Kondo E. Nakamura S. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 316: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). For cell stimulation with osmotic stress, COS7 cells transfected with expression vectors were subjected to an assay 24 h after transfection. Prior to stimulation, the cells were starved for 18 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum. The cells were then stimulated with osmotic stress via exposure to 300 mmd-sorbitol (Sigma) in culture medium at 37 °C for 15 min as previously described (8Nakamura T. Yamashita H. Nagano Y. Takahashi T. Avraham S. Avraham H. Nakamura S. FEBS Lett. 2002; 521: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The cell lysates were first immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG, anti-HA, and anti-Myc antibodies and then immunoblotted with corresponding antibodies. PRAP Polyclonal Antiserum Generation—PRAP antiserum was raised against a six histidine-tagged PRAP protein (His6-PRAP). The PRAP coding region cDNA was subcloned into a pQE-30 vector (Qiagen). The His6-PRAP protein was purified with a nickel column (Qiagen) and used as an antigen to prepare polyclonal rabbit antiserum. The antigen was thoroughly mixed with Freund's complete adjuvant to produce a suspension, which was intradermally injected into rabbits. Identical immunogen was injected five times every week. Phlebotomy was finally performed to collect serum; antiserum was used as an anti-PRAP antibody for immunoblotting and immunohistochemical analysis. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—COS7 cells transfected with expression vectors for FLAG-Pyk2/RAFTK and HA-PRAP were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. After the lysate protein contents were normalized using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad), the cell lysate (500 μg/sample) was immunoprecipitated with normal rabbit IgG, anti-Pyk2/RAFTK, anti-FLAG, anti-HA, or anti-c-Src antibodies using protein G-Sepharose beads (Pierce). Each immunoprecipitate was divided into two parts, separated on SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Bound proteins were immunoblotted with anti-Tyr(P), as well as the appropriately indicated antibodies. The blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The degree of α-synuclein phosphorylation was quantitated by densitometric analysis of nonsaturated radiographs with NIH Image software. The data were calculated from four independent experiments. Statistic analysis was performed by analysis of variance. Preparation of GST Fusion PRAP Proteins and Precipitation Assay—PRAP consists of three domains: a coiled-coil (CC) domain, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, and a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain. To fuse PRAP protein with glutathione S-transferase (GST) at the N terminus (GST-PRAP), the coding region of PRAP cDNA was amplified by PCR using F1 and R1 primers. To construct GST fusion proteins containing the CC and PH domains (GST-CC-PH), the PH domain (GST-PH), the PH and SH3 domains (GST-PH-SH3), or the SH3 domain (GST-SH3), the corresponding regions of PRAP cDNA were amplified by PCR using the following forward and reverse primers with the attached restriction enzyme sites BamHI and XhoI: 5′-CGC GGA TCC GGC TAC CTT GAA AAA CGC AG-3′ (F2) and 5′-CCG GGC TCG AGT CAA GAT TCC ATA TCT TGC AA-3′ (R2) for GST-PH, F1 and R2 for GST-CC-PH, F2 and R1 for GST-PH-SH3, and 5′-CGC GGA TCC TTT TAC CAG GGA TTG TGG GAT-3′ and R1 for GST-SH3. DNA fragments obtained from PCR were subcloned into a pGEX4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences). The sequences of all of the constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. GST fusion proteins were produced in Escherichia coli BL21 via isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) as previously described (12Nagano Y. Yamashita H. Nakamura T. Takahashi T. Kondo E. Nakamura S. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 316: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 13Takahashi T. Yamashita H. Nakamura T. Nagano Y. Nakamura S. Brain Res. 2002; 938: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For the precipitation assay, COS7 cells transfected with expression vectors for FLAG-Pyk2/RAFTK were lysed and precipitated with various GST fusion proteins as previously described (12Nagano Y. Yamashita H. Nakamura T. Takahashi T. Kondo E. Nakamura S. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 316: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Each binding assay was conducted with 10 μg of GST fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B. After the lysate protein content was normalized and precipitated with GST fusion proteins, the bound proteins were immunoblotted with anti-Pyk2/RAFTK antibodies. Immunocomplex Kinase Assay—COS7 cells transfected with expression vectors for FLAG-tagged c-Src, Fyn, or Pyk2/RAFTK were lysed and immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody. The bound proteins were subjected to an immunocomplex kinase assay as previously described (9Nakamura T. Yamashita H. Takahashi T. Nakamura S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 1085-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A purified GST-PRAP protein was added as a substrate into the reaction mixture, and phosphorylation was commenced with the addition of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The reactions were terminated by adding sample buffer to the reaction mixture. Confocal Immunofluorescent Staining—Immunofluorescence was performed as previously described (9Nakamura T. Yamashita H. Takahashi T. Nakamura S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 1085-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In brief, COS7 cells cotransfected with pcDNA3-HA-PRAP and pcDNA3-FLAG-Pyk2/RAFTK were seeded and grown on glass coverslips in medium. The adherent cells were fixed with neutral buffered 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. Double immunofluorescent staining was performed to demonstrate introduction of HA-PRAP into COS7 cells by using rabbit anti-HA antibodies, followed by anti-rabbit IgG-Cy3. Pyk2/RAFTK was visualized with anti-FLAG antibodies, followed by anti-mouse IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate. Immunostained preparations were examined with a Zeiss LSM510 confocal laser scanning microscope. Northern Blot Analysis—Blots containing poly(A+) RNA from human brains were purchased (Clontech). A gene-specific probe for PRAP or α-synuclein was generated. The spanning regions were as follows: for α-synuclein, nucleotides 1-420 (420 bp in length); and for PRAP, nucleotides 345-906 (562 bp in length). These probes were radiolabeled 2.3 × 106 cpm/μg and were used as probes for Northern blots as previously described (9Nakamura T. Yamashita H. Takahashi T. Nakamura S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 1085-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Identical blots were then rehybridized with a control probe for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Each blot was hybridized with the probe according to the manufacturer's protocol. Immunohistochemical Analysis—Immunohistochemical analysis was performed as previously described (14Ohmori H. Ogura H. Yasuda M. Nakamura S. Hatta T. Kawano K. Michikawa T. Yamashita K. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1497-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Jcl:ICR mice were purchased (Japan Clea Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and bred at 22 ± 2 °C with 50 ± 10% humidity. Dissected mice brains were fixed in Bouin's solution for 2 h. Paraffin sections (8 μm thick) taken from a parasagittal plane were sequentially processed as follows: 1) the sections were placed in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide/methanol for 30 min to block endogenous peroxidase; 2) the sections were then exposed to 2% normal rabbit serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h; 3) the sections were next incubated with anti-PRAP or anti-calbindin antibodies for 2 h; 4) thereafter, the sections were placed in a biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG solution for 1 h; and 5) the sections were finally placed in an avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (Vector Laboratories) solution for 1 h. Immunoreacted sections were stained by incubation with diaminobenzidine solution. Identification of a Pyk2/RAFTK-binding Protein with a Yeast Two-hybrid System—During investigation of the α-synuclein kinase-related activity of Pyk2/RAFTK, Pyk2/RAFTK-interacting proteins were sought using a yeast two-hybrid system. A human brain cDNA library was screened using the C-terminal proline-rich domain (amino acids 845-967) of Pyk2/RAFTK as bait, which allowed isolation of three independent clones (Fig. 1, A and B). Two of these clones contained fragments nearly identical to the Cas (Crk-associated substrate) gene, which has already been reported to associate with Pyk2/RAFTK (15Ohba T. Ishino M. Aoto H. Sasaki T. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1249-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The third clone contained a sequence partially encoding for a novel protein possessing an SH3 domain. This clone was used to probe a human hippocampus cDNA library, which yielded four clones. The longest cDNA (∼2.4 kilobase pairs, not including the poly(A+) stretch) encoded a protein consisting of 359 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of ∼41 kDa. This protein was designated PRAP. PRAP primary structure analysis was conducted by comparing the predicted amino acid sequence with all available data bases. Such a search demonstrated that PRAP contains a coiled-coil domain (amino acids 20-75), a PH domain (amino acids 115-214), and a C-terminal SH3 domain (amino acids 303-356) (Fig. 1, B and C). Analysis in the yeast two-hybrid system suggested that PRAP could interact with the C terminus of Pyk2/RAFTK (Pyk2/RAFTK-C). The SH3 domain of PRAP (PRAP-SH3) alone also interacted with Pyk2/RAFTK-C (Fig. 1, A and B). Nonetheless, PRAP could not interact with the N terminus of Pyk2/RAFTK (Pyk2/RAFTK-N; amino acids 1-418) (Fig. 1, A and B). Pyk2/RAFTK-C could associate with the SH3 domain (PRAP-SH3) but not the PH domain (PRAP-PH) of PRAP. Despite the fact that PRAP had a predicted molecular mass of ∼41 kDa when it was expressed in E. coli, PRAP was collected as a ∼55-kDa mass of protein in COS7 cells transfected with expression vectors for PRAP (Fig. 2A). To evaluate for potential post-translational modification, such as ubiquitination or SUMOylation, COS7 cells transfected with expression vectors for PRAP fused at its N terminus with the HA tag (HA-PRAP) were grown in the presence of lactacystin or iodoacetamide, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibodies. Nonetheless, immunoblotting with anti-ubiquitin and anti-SUMO antibodies demonstrated that PRAP lacked ubiquitin or SUMO conjugation (data not shown). PRAP and Pyk2/RAFTK Interaction in Mammalian Cells—PRAP binding with Pyk2/RAFTK was confirmed using an immunoprecipitation assay. To examine the interaction of PRAP with Pyk2/RAFTK in mammalian cells, Pyk2/RAFTK fused at the N terminus with the FLAG tag (FLAG-Pyk2/RAFTK) was expressed together with HA-PRAP by transient cotransfection of COS7 cells. The immunoprecipitates from the lysate of these cells were analyzed by immunoblotting. When both FLAG-Pyk2/RAFTK and HA-PRAP were expressed in cells, an anti-FLAG antibody (data not shown) and an anti-Pyk2/RAFTK antibody immunoprecipitated HA-PRAP (Fig. 2A). In addition, an anti-HA antibody immunoprecipitated FLAG-Pyk2/RAFTK in the same manner (data not shown). It was concluded that PRAP and Pyk2/RAFTK proteins interact with each other in mammalian cells. Analysis in the yeast two-hybrid system suggested that the SH3 domain of PRAP could interact with the C terminus of Pyk2/RAFTK (Fig. 1A). Potential involvement of other PRAP domains in the interaction with Pyk2/RAFTK was then assessed. COS7 cells transfected with an expression vector for FLAG-Pyk2/RAFTK were lysed and precipitated with various GST fusion PRAP proteins, such as GST-PRAP, GST-CC-PH, GST-PH, GST-PH-SH3, and GST-SH3, as well as the GST protein alone as a control. Anti-Pyk2/RAFTK immunoblotting revealed that GST fusion proteins containing the PRAP SH3 domain exclusively precipitated Pyk2/RAFTK (Fig. 2B). The results suggest that PRAP binds to Pyk2/RAFTK with its SH3 domain. Potential interaction between α-synuclein and PRAP was also assessed with both immunoprecipitation and precipitation assays with GST fusion PRAP proteins. Nonetheless, interaction between α-synuclein and PRAP was not detected by either assay (data not shown) PRAP Localization to the Perinuclear Cytoplasm—PRAP and Pyk2/RAFTK intracellular localization was determined by a double staining immunofluorescence study. Confocal microscopic analysis revealed that both PRAP (Fig. 3A) and Pyk2/RAFTK (Fig. 3B) were present in the cytoplasm. In contrast to PRAP, Pyk2/RAFTK was relatively sparse around the perinuclear region. An overlay of PRAP and Pyk2/RAFTK staining revealed colocalization of the proteins (Fig. 3C). PRAP Expression in the Brain—Northern blot analysis was performed to examine the mRNA expression levels of PRAP in the brain. PRAP mRNA was expressed in all regions in the central nervous system, including the amygdala, caudate, putamen, corpus callosum, hippocampus, substantia nigra, subthalamic nucleus, and thalamus (Fig. 4A). In addition, α-synuclein mRNA was also expressed in all brain regions but was most abundant in the amygdala, caudate, putamen, hippocampus, and substantia nigra. Rehybridization of the same blot with a control probe for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase revealed that a similar amount of mRNA was present in each lane. To ascertain PRAP distribution in the brain, immunohistochemical studies were performed. Similar to the expression of PRAP mRNA, loupe images of sagittal sections of mice brains demonstrated that PRAP was present in all regions throughout brain and was relatively abundant in the Purkinje cell layer (Fig. 4B), hippocampal gyrus, and cortex (Fig. 4C). Sagittal sections near the isthmus demonstrated PRAP immunoreactivity in the mesencephalic nucleus (Fig. 4D), which was defined as the region caudal to the medial lemniscus and ventrolateral to the red nucleus. With serial sectioning, the same population of neurons was also calbindin-immunoreactive (Fig. 4E), indicating that such neurons rich with PRAP immunoreactivity were dopaminergic neurons, a finding that had been previously described (16Verney C. Zecevic N. Ezan P. J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 429: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The specificity of PRAP immunoreactivity was confirmed by demonstrating that the reactivity was eliminated by preadsorption of the antiserum with immunizing His6-PRAP at a concentration of 10 μm for 2 h (Fig. 4F). Higher magnification examination of the mesencephalic nucleus revealed the presence of PRAP in perikarya and dendrites (Fig. 4, G and H). PRAP Was Found to be a Substrate for Src Family Kinases but Not for Pyk2/RAFTK—It has been suggested that one autophosphorylation site of Pyk2/RAFTK, Tyr402, recruits c-Src (17Li J. Avraham H. Rogers R.A. Raja S. Avraham S. Blood. 1996; 88: 417-428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of c-Src to Tyr402 on Pyk2/RAFTK leads to enhancement of c-Src kinase activity. Because Pyk2/RAFTK associates with PRAP, the present study investigated whether or not PRAP is a substrate for Pyk2/RAFTK. COS7 cells were cotransfected with expression vectors for HA-PRAP, FLAG-tagged wild type Pyk2/RAFTK, the Src-binding site mutant Pyk2/RAFTK (Y402F), and the kinase-inactive Pyk2/RAFTK (K457R). Immunoprecipitation assay revealed that mutant Pyk2/RAFTK also bound to PRAP (data not shown). Such a result suggests that these mutations might not affect the Pyk2/RAFTK binding capacity to PRAP. After the lysate protein contents were normalized, the cell lysate was divided into three aliquots and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG, anti-c-Src, and anti-HA antibodies. Immunoblotting with anti-Tyr(P) antibodies revealed that tyrosine phosphorylation of PRAP was increased with expression of wild type Pyk2/RAFTK (Fig. 5A). In cells expressing Y402F Pyk2/RAFTK, c-Src was not strongly phosphorylated, as had been previously described (8Nakamura T. Yamashita H. Nagano Y. Takahashi T. Avraham S. Avraham H. Nakamura S. FEBS Lett. 2002; 521: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The Y402F Pyk2/RAFTK mutant was not able to increase PRAP tyrosine phosphorylation over base-line phosphorylation of untransfected cells, despite being able to associate with PRAP. Furthermore, phosphorylation of PRAP was still detected with expression of the kinase-inactive K457R Pyk2/RAFTK. The phosphorylation level of PRAP with K457R Pyk2/RAFTK was similar to that with Y402F Pyk2/RAFTK, suggesting that Pyk2/RAFTK does not directly phosphorylate PRAP (Fig. 5B). To further investigate in vitro PRAP phosphorylation, an immunocomplex kinase assay was performed. FLAG-tagged c-Src, Fyn, and Pyk2/RAFTK were expressed in COS7 cells. Such PTK were immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody and subjected to an immunocomplex kinase assay using a purified GST-PRAP protein as a substrate. Pyk2/RAFTK did not phosphorylate GST-PRAP, but c-Src phosphorylated GST-PRAP (Fig. 5C). Such results suggest that PRAP is a substrate of c-Src and Fyn but not Pyk2/RAFTK. As a control, the same assay was performed using GST alone as a sub"

A possible role for Q as a dietary antioxidant for treating conditions that involve altered cellular redox states is being intensely studied. Mutations in the clk-1 gene of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans affect numerous physiological rates including behavioral rates, developmental rates, reproduction, and life span. clk-1 encodes a protein associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane that is necessary for Q biosynthesis in C. elegans. clk-1 mutants do not synthesize Q but accumulate demethoxyubiquinone, a Q synthesis intermediate that is able to partially sustain mitochondrial respiration in worms as well as in mammals. Recently, we and others have found that exogenous Q is necessary for the fertility and development of clk-1 mutants. Here, we take advantage of the clk-1 genetic model to identify structural features of Q that are functionally important in vivo. We show that clk-1 mutants are exquisitely sensitive to the length of the side chain of the Q they consume. We also identified differential sensitivity to Q side-chain length between null alleles of clk-1 (qm30 and qm51) and the weaker allele e2519.

Ubiquinone (coenzyme Q, or Q) 1The abbreviations used are: Q, ubiquinone; DMQ, demethoxyubiquinone; UCP, uncoupling protein(s).1The abbreviations used are: Q, ubiquinone; DMQ, demethoxyubiquinone; UCP, uncoupling protein(s). is a membrane constituent that has numerous functions in the cell. It is involved in electron transport in the inner mitochondrial membrane, the plasma membrane (1Santos-Ocana C. Villalba J.M. Cordoba F. Padilla S. Crane F.L. Clarke C.F. Navas P. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1998; 30: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and the membrane of the lysosome (2Nohl H. Gille L. Staniek K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 854: 394-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Q is also a cofactor for several cellular enzymes (e.g. dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, which is necessary for nucleic acid biosynthesis) and other proteins and complexes such as the mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (3Echtay K.S. Winkler E. Klingenberg M. Nature. 2000; 408: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) (UCP, which regulate metabolic heat production) and the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (4Fontaine E. Ichas F. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25734-25740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) (which regulates programmed cell death). Moreover, Q is also an antioxidant that can protect membranes and other cellular constituents from oxidative damage (5Forsmark P. Aberg F. Norling B. Nordenbrand K. Dallner G. Ernster L. FEBS Lett. 1991; 285: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 6Ernster L. Forsmark-Andree P. Clin. Investig. 1993; 71: S60-S65Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 7Kelso G.F.

A possible role for Q as a dietary antioxidant for treating conditions that involve altered cellular redox states is being intensely studied in animal experiments, as well as in human clinical trials (2Nohl H. Gille L. Staniek K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 854: 394-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 8Shults C.W. Oakes D. Kieburtz K. Beal M.F. Haas R. Plumb S. Juncos J.L. Nutt J. Shoulson I.

Q is also used extensively as a nutritional supplement to combat aging and age-associated diseases. Q is composed of a head group that is capable of donating and accepting electrons and of a lipidic side chain containing a variable number of isoprene subunits. The length of the Q isoprenoid side chain is controlled in a species-specific manner by the enzyme polyprenyl-diphosphate synthase (encoded by the gene ispB in Escherichia coli) (9Okada K. Suzuki K. Kamiya Y. Zhu X. Fujisaki S. Nishimura Y. Nishino T. Nakagawa T. Kawamukai M. Matsuda H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans produces Q9 (the subscript denotes the chain length), E. coli produces Q8, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae produces Q6. In mammals, both Q9 and Q10 are found; Q9 is predominant in rats and mice, whereas Q10 is predominant in humans (see Fig. 1) (10Dallner G. Sindelar P.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In rats, the Q10/Q9 ratio ranges from 8% in heart to 34% in brain. Such organ-specific differences are also found in humans (10Dallner G. Sindelar P.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), albeit of lesser amplitude. These variations probably reflect a selective use of Q in cellular processes that are sensitive to Q side-chain length. Previous in vitro findings indicate that small changes in the Q side chain can be functionally important. For example, the pharmacological profile of some Q analogues has been found to switch from activation to inhibition of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, depending on minor changes in the side chain (4Fontaine E. Ichas F. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25734-25740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Also, Q-mediated protection of cultivated mice neurons from a mumps paramyxovirus infection is only efficient with exogenously added Q10 and not with Q9 (11Edlund C. Holmberg K. Dallner G. Norrby E. Kristensson K. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 634-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In yeast, however, genetic side-chain length manipulation (from Q5 to Q10) of the endogenously produced Q has little effect on growth, with only a slight preference for Q6 (12Okada K. Kainou T. Matsuda H. Kawamukai M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Here, we have tested the hypothesis that variations of Q side-chain length are functionally important in vivo. We have used a model in which the clk-1 mutants of C. elegans are fed with E. coli cells that produce Q molecules of different side-chain lengths. In the presence of their normal bacterial food source, which provides dietary Q8, clk-1 mutants show numerous physiological phenotypes including slow development, slow behavior, and a long life span (the Clk phenotype) (13Wong A. Boutis P. Hekimi S. Genetics. 1995; 139: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). clk-1 encodes an inner mitochondrial membrane protein involved in Q biosynthesis (14Ewbank J.J. Barnes T.M.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). clk-1 mutants lack Q and instead accumulate the Q biosynthetic precursor demethoxyubiquinone (DMQ), which is capable of sustaining some, but not all, of the functions of Q (16Miyadera H. Amino H. Hiraishi A. Taka H. Murayama K. Miyoshi H. Sakamoto K. Ishii N. Hekimi S. Kita K. J. Biol.

For their fertility, clk-1 mutants depend strictly upon exogenous Q, which they can take up from their bacterial food source, and are sterile when fed Q-deficient bacteria (18Jonassen T. Larsen P.L. Clarke C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 19Hihi A.K. Gao Y. Hekimi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2202-2206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Here, we show that the fertility of the wild type is unaffected by the length of the Q side chain. In contrast, clk-1 mutants are exquisitely sensitive to the length of the side chain of the dietary Q they consume. Both clk-1(qm30) and clk-1(qm51) mutants are fertile when fed Q9 or Q8 but are sterile when their only source of Q is Q7 or Q6. Also, qm30 and qm51 have a slower development and display slower adult behaviors on short-chain Q. Interestingly, clk-1(e2519) mutants, whose developmental and behavioral phenotypes in the presence of dietary Q8 are less severe than those of clk-1(qm30) and clk-1(qm51), are fertile when fed on Q9-, Q8-, or Q7-producing bacteria and become sterile only when fed continuously on Q6-producing bacteria. Similarly, development and adult behaviors of e2519 are only affected on Q6-bacteria. These findings allow us to propose a model in which we distinguish several types of Q-dependent processes: processes that are very sensitive to Q side-chain length and others that are permissive to using Q with shorter chains. Nematode Strains—We used the wild-type strain N2 (Bristol) and the mutants clk-1(qm30), clk-1(e2519), and clk-1(qm51). The mutant strains daf-2(e1370), clk-2(qm37), and isp-1(qm150) were used as controls. All of the strains were maintained at 20 °C.

For the switch experiment (Table IV), worms were first grown on a Q-deficient strain (GD1), resulting in a prolonged larval arrest for clk-1(e2519). The larvae were then switched to Q8- or Q6-bacteria after 3 or 5 days, and their brood size was evaluated. In this case, the wild type (N2), which does not arrest on GD1 was transferred at the L2 stage to test plates. All experiments were performed at least twice.Table IVBrood size on different food sources of the wild type (N2) and of clk-1(e2519) mutants after larval arrest on Q-deficient bacteria3 days on GD15 days on GD1Q8-bacteria (KO229/ispBwt)Q6-bacteria (KO229/R321V)Q8-bacteria (KO229/ispBwt)Q6-bacteria (KO229/R321V)N2**261 ± 13239 ± 15N.D.N.D.e2519140 ± 751 ± 10129 ± 915 ± 4 Open table in a new tab Postembryonic Development—Adult animals were transferred from OP50 to plates containing the test bacteria for a few hours and then transferred again to a fresh test plate. Unstaged embryos laid on the test bacteria were then placed at 20 °C and left for 3 h to hatch. Larvae that had hatched during that period were monitored every 2 h until they reached adulthood. Defecation—Adult animals were transferred from OP50 to plates containing the test bacteria for a few hours and then transferred again to a fresh test plate for egg laying. Young adult F1s grown at 20 °C were scored for defecation as previously described (13Wong A. Boutis P. Hekimi S. Genetics. 1995; 139: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation of Antibodies Directed against CLK-1—A PCR fragment encoding the full-length CLK-1 protein was cloned into the pGEX-3X expression vector (Amersham Biosciences). A glutathione S-transferase-CLK-1 protein of the expected size (∼50 kDa) was expressed in BL21(DE3) bacteria (Novagen) and was purified from inclusion bodies. This recombinant protein was injected into rabbits to obtain polyclonal antibodies. The sera of two rabbits (antibodies 2774 and 3030) specifically react to CLK-1 by the following criteria. Postimmunization sera, but not preimmunization sera, recognize the bacterial antigen and a band at the expected size of ∼21 kDa in wild-type worm extracts, but not in the mutant alleles qm30 and qm51. Moreover, this ∼21-kDa band specifically disappears upon preabsorption of the serum with the purified glutathione S-transferase-CLK-1 protein, but not upon preabsorption with other unrelated bacterially expressed proteins, including glutathione S-transferase fusions. In addition, antibody 2774 recognizes in vitro translated CLK-1 and an in vitro translated CLK-1 deletion that is potentially encoded by clk-1(qm30) (data not shown). Western Blot Analysis—75 worms of each genotype tested were picked at the young adult stage. Animals were denatured in SDS sample buffer and 100 mm dithiothreitol by boiling at 85 °C for 5 min. Protein samples were run on a 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was incubated with the 2774 primary anti-CLK-1 antibody (1:500) and subsequently with donkey anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson Laboratories; 1:2500). The secondary antibody was detected using the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). Similar results that are not shown were obtained using another anti-CLK-1 antibody also generated in our laboratory (antibody 3030). The CLK-1 Protein Is Present in e2519 but Not in qm30 and qm51 Mutants—The mutant allele clk-1(qm30) encodes a 3′ deletion of 590 base pairs, removing the coding region corresponding to the last 35 amino acids, the stop codon, and part of the 3′-untranslated region. The mutant allele clk-1(qm51) is mutated at a splice donor/acceptor site, and clk-1(e2519) is a point mutant affecting an amino acid that is predicted to be important for putative iron binding and enzymatic function (E148K) (14Ewbank J.J. Barnes T.M. Lakowski B. Lussier M. Bussey H. Hekimi S. Science. 1997; 275: 980-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis revealed that the clk-1 mRNA is truncated in qm30 mutants and is not detectable in qm51 mutants, whereas clk-1 mRNA levels in clk-1(e2519) mutants are similar to that in the wild type (20Felkai S. Ewbank J.J. Lemieux J. Labbe J.C. Brown G.G. Hekimi S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1783-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). To analyze the CLK-1 protein content in the clk-1 mutants, we generated and used two polyclonal anti-CLK-1 antisera. By immunoblot analysis, we find that CLK-1 is present in both wild-type and e2519 worms in comparable amounts, whereas it is not detectable in qm30 and qm51 animals (Fig. 2). The complete absence of CLK-1 in qm30 and qm51 suggests that both alleles are true molecular nulls. These observations are also consistent with the finding that the e2519 allele results in a partial loss of function (see below) and suggest that the protein product of clk-1(e2519) might have some residual enzymatic activity. C. elegans Is Sensitive to Q Side-chain Length—Wild-type and clk-1 mutant worms were fed with various E. coli strains in which the endogenous ispB gene is disrupted and replaced by functional variants of the gene carried on plasmids (see Table I) (21Kainou T. Okada K. Suzuki K. Nakagawa T. Matsuda H. Kawamukai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7876-7883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Depending on the ispB variant used, the Q produced by the cells ranges in chain length from Q9 to Q6: KO229/pSN18 produces Q9, KO229/ispBwt and KO229/L31V contain Q8 as a major Q, KO229/Y37A/Y38A accumulates Q7, and KO229/R321V and KO229/Y37A/R321V accumulate Q6. We examined the fertility of the wild type (N2) and of clk-1 mutants carrying the null alleles qm30 and qm51 or the partial loss-of-function allele e2519. We also tested other slow growing and long lived mutants as controls (daf-2(e1370), clk-2(qm37), and isp-1(qm150)) (Table II and data not shown). We find that the fertility of the wild type and mutant controls is unaffected by the length of the Q side chain. In contrast, clk-1 mutants are exquisitely sensitive to the side-chain length of the dietary Q they consume. Both clk-1(qm30) and clk-1(qm51) mutants are fertile when fed Q9 or Q8 but are completely sterile when their only source of Q is Q7 or Q6. In contrast, clk-1(e2519) mutants are fertile when fed either Q9, Q8, or Q7 and for one generation on Q6. However, when these animals are grown for two generations on Q6-producing bacteria, they become sterile. We scored the brood size of wild-type and e2519 worms for two successive generations on Q6-producing bacteria and observed that, whereas there is no effect on the wild type, the brood size of e2519 animals is dramatically reduced by the second generation. In fact, the brood size drops from 68 in the first generation to 11 in the second generation (Table III). In addition, the few progeny obtained after two generations on Q6 are themselves completely sterile. These results reveal that small differences in Q side-chain length can have large biological effects in vivo. They are also consistent with the milder Clk phenotype of the e2519 allele in the presence of dietary Q8 and suggest that clk-1(e2519) may have some residual activity.Table IIEffect of Q side-chain length on C. elegans brood sizeE. coli Q contentBrood size analysisBacterial sourceMajor QMinor QN2clk-1 (qm30)clk-1 (qm51)clk-1 (e2519)daf-2 (e1370)OP50Q8261 ± 30101 ± 10116 ± 6169 ± 16241 ± 18KO229/pSN18Q9256 ± 14104 ± 4105 ± 16182 ± 16256 ± 11KO229/ispBwtQ8278 ± 25120 ± 5110 ± 12182 ± 14251 ± 16KO229/L31VQ8245 ± 19108 ± 1498 ± 14170 ± 16237 ± 16KO229/Y37A/Y38AQ7Q8, Q6273 ± 250*0*163 ± 20251 ± 20KO229/R321VQ6Q7, Q5247 ± 160087 ± 8238 ± 29KO229/Y37A/R321VQ6Q7, Q5260 ± 180098 ± 4235 ± 8 Open table in a new tab Table IIIBrood size of the wild type (N2) and clk-1(e2519) mutants after two successive generations on Q8- or Q6-bacteriaFirst generationSecond generationQ8-bacteria (KO229/ispBwt)Q6-bacteria (KO229/R321V)Q8-bacteria (KO229/ispBwt)Q6-bacteria (KO229/R321V)N2278 ± 25264 ± 23281 ± 36274 ± 5e2519162 ± 1868 ± 6177 ± 2611 ± 4 Open table in a new tab e2519 Larval Arrest Impairs Fertility on Q6-bacteria—We tested two possibilities that could underlie the pattern of fertility of e2519 animals on Q6-bacteria. First, we wondered whether there could be an effect of Q6 on CLK-1 synthesis such that maternally provided Q8 could allow for the stability of clk-1(e2519) protein, whereas it would be unstable in the presence of Q6 alone. However, immunoblot analysis of CLK-1 content in N2 and e2519 grown on Q8- and Q6-containing bacteria shows that this is not the case (data not shown). Second, we tested whether e2519 mutants could survive on Q6 thanks to exogenous Q accumulated during the previous generation. Indeed, the first generation of e2519 mutants that grow on Q6 is derived from eggs produced by mothers that grew on Q8. Possibly, the amount of Q8 deposited in the oocyte is sufficient to grow through the next generation. To test this, we devised an experiment to deplete e2519 of any accumulated Q8. This was done by first growing e2519 on a Q-deficient strain (GD1) (18Jonassen T. Larsen P.L. Clarke C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 19Hihi A.K. Gao Y. Hekimi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2202-2206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), resulting in a prolonged larval arrest. The arrested larvae were then switched to Q8- or Q6-bacteria, and their brood size was evaluated (Table IV). A 3-day arrest on GD1 impairs e2519 fertility when switched to Q6-bacteria, whereas it only moderately affects the worms when switched to Q8. This effect is enhanced after a 5-day arrest and suggests that it is possible to gradually deplete e2519 of a dietary contribution packaged in the egg. Thus, in the presence of maternally contributed Q8, fertility on Q6 is possible for one generation in the case of e2519 mutants, but not in the case of qm30 or qm51 mutants. Note that all mutants are fully sterile on Q-deficient bacteria even in the first generation. Together, the observations with e2519 mutants suggest that Q6 can play some role in the nematode and that clk-1(e2519) encodes a protein with residual activity. Development and Behavior Are Sensitive to Q Side-chain Length—On Q-less bacteria, such as GD1, all clk-1 mutants arrest around the L2 stage but resume development after a week. In contrast, we find that short-chain Q (Q7 and Q6) allow clk-1(e2519), clk-1(qm30), and clk-1(qm51) to develop without arresting (data not shown). This suggests that Q with shorter chains can sustain continuous postembryonic development in worms and function in at least one crucial Q-dependent process during development. We also measured the duration of postembryonic development of wild-type and of clk-1 mutant animals on bacteria with different Q isoforms (Table V). We find that the rate of postembryonic development of the wild type is not affected by the nature of dietary Q. In contrast, clk-1(qm30) and clk-1(qm51) develop more slowly when feeding on Q7 and Q6 than when feeding on Q8 and Q9. However, we find that the rate of development of clk-1(e2519) is slower only on Q6-bacteria. We also measured the defecation cycle length, one of the behavioral phenotypes affected in clk-1 mutants (Table VI). We find that the cycle length of N2 worms is unaffected by dietary Q. In contrast, clk-1(qm30) animals are slower when using Q7 and Q6 than when using Q8. However, clk-1(e2519) worms are again only slower and deregulated on Q6. Thus, as for fertility, clk-1 null mutants cannot efficiently function using Q with shorter chains (Q7 or Q6), whereas e2519 is affected only on Q6.Table VEffect of Q isoforms on the length of postembryonic development (in hours)Q9-bacteria (KO229/pSN18)Q8-bacteria (KO229/ispBwt)Q7-bacteria (KO229/Y37A/Y38A)Q6-bacteria (KO229/Y37A/R321V)N243.8 ± 4.1 (n = 34)44.2 ± 3.7 (n = 26)45.0 ± 4.5 (n = 24)45.8 ± 4.0 (n = 32)clk-1 (e2519)57.9 ± 2.0 (n = 44)59.9 ± 2.8 (n = 34)64.3 ± 5.5 (n = 33)69.0 ± 5.4 (n = 49)clk-1 (qm30)73.0 ± 1.9 (n = 45)75.0 ± 4.2 (n = 33)84.7 ± 5.2 (n = 29)86.6 ± 6.4 (n = 30) Open table in a new tab Table VIEffect of Q isoforms on the defecation cycle length (in seconds)Q9-bacteria (KO229/pSN18)Q8-bacteria (KO229/ispBwt)Q7-bacteria (KO229/Y37A/Y38A)Q6-bacteria (KO229/Y37A/R321V)N249.5 ± 1.1 (n = 10)51.8 ± 2.2 (n = 10)51.2 ± 1.5 (n = 10)48.9 ± 1.1 (n = 10)clk-1 (e2519)73.0 ± 6.7 (n = 10)73.3 ± 4.2 (n = 10)76.8 ± 7.2 (n = 10)87.3 ± 15.5 (n = 10)clk-1 (qm30)74.0 ± 8.6 (n = 10)78.0 ± 4.8 (n = 9)108.8 ± 18.6 (n = 10)118.0 ± 15.6 (n = 8) Open table in a new tab When fed on their normal bacterial food source, which provides dietary Q8, clk-1 mutants display the Clk phenotype, which is characterized by the deregulation and lengthening of embryonic and postembryonic development, as well as of adult rhythmic behaviors such as the defecation cycle and the pharyngeal pumping cycle (13Wong A. Boutis P. Hekimi S. Genetics. 1995; 139: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Clk phenotype also leads to an extended life span, since clk-1 mutants live longer than wild-type worms (see Ref. 22Hekimi S. Lakowski B. Barnes T.M. Ewbank J.J. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 14-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar for a review). clk-1 encodes a 187-amino acid protein (14Ewbank J.J. Barnes T.M. Lakowski B. Lussier M. Bussey H.

Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33297-33300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), which is present in eukaryotes as well as in proteobacteria. CLK-1 participates in one of the last steps of Q biosynthesis and is responsible for DMQ hydroxylation. Consequently, the clk-1 mutants of C. elegans accumulate DMQ instead of Q (15Miyadera H. Kano K. Miyoshi H. Ishii N. Hekimi S. Kita K. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Mouse embryos and mouse embryonic stem cells in which the clk-1 homologue has been knocked out also accumulate DMQ (17Levavasseur F. Miyadera H. Sirois J. Tremblay M.L. Kita K. Shoubridge E. Hekimi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46160-46164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). DMQ is a quinone that can transport electrons, although less efficiently than Q (16Miyadera H. Amino H. Hiraishi A. Taka H. Murayama K. Miyoshi H. Sakamoto K. Ishii N. Hekimi S. Kita K. J. Biol.

It can function in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, in particular in complex I and III, and thus can sustain respiration at relatively high rates (16Miyadera H. Amino H. Hiraishi A. Taka H.

However, mouse clk-1–/– embryos arrest development around embryonic day 10, suggesting that either CLK-1 or Q is required for aspects of mammalian development beyond respiration per se (17Levavasseur F.

Commun. 2001; 289: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We and others have previously shown that DMQ cannot functionally replace Q everywhere in the cell (18Jonassen T. Larsen P.L. Clarke C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 19Hihi A.K. Gao Y. Hekimi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2202-2206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In fact, clk-1 mutants are dependent upon the presence of exogenous Q in their bacterial food source. However, dietary Q is not sufficient as a quinone source, since C. elegans mutants devoid of endogenous Q or DMQ (coq-3 mutants) cannot develop even in the presence of dietary Q (18Jonassen T. Larsen P.L. Clarke C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 19Hihi A.K. Gao Y. Hekimi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2202-2206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). One of the first conclusions we can derive from our findings is that the CLK-1 protein is completely absent in qm30 and qm51 mutants. qm30 and qm51 mutants both accumulate DMQ, which is also found in mclk-1–/– mouse embryos and stem cells (16Miyadera H. Amino H. Hiraishi A. Taka H. Murayama K. Miyoshi H. Sakamoto K. Ishii N. Hekimi S. Kita K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7713-7716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 17Levavasseur F. Miyadera H. Sirois J. Tremblay M.L. Kita K. Shoubridge E. Hekimi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46160-46164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to yeast coq7/clk-1 knockout mutants that accumulate the first intermediate of the Q synthesis process (3-hexaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate) but not DMQ (25Marbois B.N. Clarke C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2995-3004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). This is probably the result of the impaired stability of the Q biosynthesis pathway proteins (COQ proteins) in the absence of any one of the COQ proteins, including COQ7/CLK-1 (26Hsu A.Y. Do T.Q. Lee P.T. Clarke C.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1484: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that the absence of CLK-1 in mammals and in worms does not affect the other COQ enzymes, as attested by the presence of DMQ in null clk-1 mutants. The present study takes advantage of the dependence of clk-1 mutants on dietary Q as a system to evaluate various forms of Q. We find that a structural feature of Q (i.e. the length of its isoprenoid side chain) can have large biological effects in vivo. Indeed, clk-1 null mutants are only fertile in the presence of Q9 or Q8 but not Q7 or Q6. On the contrary, wild-type worms are not sensitive to the presence of exogenous Q, indicating that their endogenous Q is sufficient to fulfill all Q functions, as previously shown (18Jonassen T. Larsen P.L. Clarke C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 19Hihi A.K. Gao Y. Hekimi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2202-2206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that, although it appears that Q7 and Q6 are not toxic, they function inefficiently or not at all in one or several of the biological processes that require Q. This is consistent with in vitro studies that have established that some enzymes are differentially affected by Q side-chain length, such as mitochondrial permeability transition pore (4Fontaine E. Ichas F. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25734-25740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and UCP (3Echtay K.S. Winkler E. Klingenberg M. Nature. 2000; 408: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). In particular, Q is a necessary cofactor for UCP to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation in the inner mitochondrial membrane (3Echtay K.S. Winkler E. Klingenberg M. Nature. 2000; 408: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Interestingly, UCP3 loses 40% of its activity when given Q6 instead of Q10, and UCP1 and UCP2 are 25% less efficient with Q6 (27Echtay K.S. Winkler E. Frischmuth K. Klingenberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1416-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that multiple Q-dependent processes are suboptimal with short chain Q, which produces the phenotypes we observe in this study in clk-1 mutants. Note that short chain Q are capable of sustaining continuous growth of clk-1 mutants, which means that feeding on these Q isoforms is better than feeding on a diet entirely devoid of Q, which results in an L2 arrest. However, the functionality of short-chain Q is limited, since both Q7 and Q6 cannot rescue the fertility of clk-1 nulls and result in a slower development and behavior. For all of the phenotypes tested, we consistently find that the point mutant clk-1(e2519) can function with Q7. To account for these observations, we propose a model in which the milder phenotype of e2519 mutants is due to a residual activity of the expressed mutant CLK-1 protein. We speculate that e2519 does in fact manufacture minute amounts of Q9 that have escaped detection so far (16Miyadera H. Amino H. Hiraishi A. Taka H. Murayama K. Miyoshi H. Sakamoto K. Ishii N. Hekimi S. Kita K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7713-7716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 18Jonassen T. Larsen P.L. Clarke C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The mutation in e2519 alters E148, which is an important amino acid in the putative di-iron binding motif EXXH. This motif is important for the activity of di-iron carboxylate family members (28Nordlund P. Eklund H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 758-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). However, variants of alternative oxidase, an enzyme that also binds iron with EXXH motifs, can still partially function when mutated in the key glutamic acid residue of one of the EXXH motifs (29Albury M.S. Affourtit C. Crichton P.G. Moore A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1190-1194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 30Ajayi W.U. Chaudhuri M. Hill G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8187-8193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This suggests that alteration of the EXXH motif does not necessarily lead to a total loss of function. Accordingly, the protein encoded by e2519 could be partially active and therefore capable of producing very small amounts of Q9 in worms. Based on the differential effects of Q side-chain length on clk-1 mutants and the potential ability of clk-1(e2519) to produce small amounts of Q9, we propose a model that distinguishes three types of Q-dependent processes (see Table VII): a process that absolutely requires Q9 or Q8 but in small amounts only (process I), a process that can work with Q7 but not Q6 and that requires relatively larger amounts of Q than process I (process II), and a process that can work with Q6 (process III). In the wild type, all three processes function with endogenous Q9.In qm30 and qm51 mutants that grow in the presence of Q8, all three processes function with Q8. In e2519 mutants that grow in the presence of Q8, process I functions with endogenous Q9 or with both endogenous Q9 and dietary Q8, and processes II and III function with dietary Q8. In the presence of Q7, e2519 mutants are fertile, because process II and III function with the dietary Q7 and process I functions with the endogenous Q9. However, qm30 or qm51 mutants are sterile, because process I cannot function with Q7. In e2519 mutants that grow on Q6 bacteria, process I functions with endogenous Q9, process II fails unless maternally derived dietary Q8 is present, and process III functions with dietary Q6. According to our model, the sterility of qm30 and qm51 on bacteria that manufacture no Q (such as GD1) occurs because all three processes fail. In contrast, e2519 mutants are sterile on GD1 because processes II and III fail, although process I can function thanks to low levels of endogenous Q9.Table VIIA model for Q-dependent processes in C. elegans In our model, clk-1(e2519) mutants manufacture very small amounts of Q9 that would be sufficient for process I. Given that clk-1(e2519) mutants also have a weaker Clk phenotype than the nulls in the presence of dietary Q8, which is sufficient for process II, we suggest that the Clk phenotype is due to process I. Alternatively, some or all aspects of the Clk phenotype could be due to the presence of DMQ, which could alter the function of any of the three processes by competing with Q and/or by virtue of its specific redox properties (15Miyadera H. Kano K. Miyoshi H. Ishii N. Hekimi S. Kita K. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Also, we propose that process III is necessary for continuous development in C. elegans, since Q with shorter chains are functional in this regard. Indeed, clk-1 mutants develop continuously on Q9, Q8, Q7, and Q6, albeit more slowly for qm30 and qm51, when using dietary Q7 and Q6. This is in contrast to the transient developmental arrest of these mutants on Q-less bacteria and suggests that Q7 and Q6 can be sufficient for at least one crucial developmental process. In conclusion, we show that Q side-chain length can have large biological effects in vivo. The sensitivity of clk-1 mutants to Q side-chain length represents a unique system in which to identify and study biologically active Q analogues that take into account chain-length specificity. This sensitivity to Q properties is possibly conserved among higher eukaryotes. In this regard, our findings suggest that caution should be taken in interpreting experimental studies in which mice or rat models of mitochondrial or neurodegenerative diseases are treated with Q10 given that these rodents predominantly synthesize Q9.

C4BP is a disulfide-linked polymer of seven α-chains and a unique β-chain, the α- and β-chains being composed of eight and three complement control protein (CCP) domains, respectively. In previous studies we have localized cofactor activity and binding of C4b to α-chain CCP1–3 of C4BP, whereas the binding of C3b required additionally CCP4. Likewise, introduced point mutations that decreased binding of C4b/C3b caused a decrease in cofactor activity. In the present study, we describe two mutants of C4BP, K126Q/K128Q and F144S/F149S, clustered on α-chain CCP3, which selectively lost their ability to act as cofactors in the cleavage of both C4b and C3b. Both mutants show the same binding affinity for C4b/C3b as measured by surface plasmon resonance and have the same inhibitory effect on formation and decay of the classical pathway C3-convertase as the wild type C4BP. It appears that C4b and C3b do not undergo the same conformational changes upon binding to the C4BP mutants as during the interaction with the wild type C4BP, which then results in the observed loss of the cofactor activity.

Austen K.F. J. Immunol. 1971; 107: 742-750PubMed Google Scholar, 2Cooper N.R. J. Exp. Med. 1975; 141: 890-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). FI degrades activated forms of complement factor 3 (C3b) and 4 (C4b) only when they are bound to a cofactor protein such as C4b-binding protein (C4BP) or factor H (FH). C3 and C4 are homologous proteins processed intracellularly into α- and β-chains (C3) or α-, β-, and γ-chains (C4), which are linked with disulfide bridges. During degradation by FI, several peptide bonds in the α-chains of C3b and C4b are cleaved. Molecular events leading to the cleavage of C3b/C4b by FI are not well defined at present. It has been suggested that C3b undergoes a conformational change upon binding to FH, which results in the accessibility of peptide bonds in C3b that can be cleaved by FI (3Isenman D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4238-4244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Simultaneously, it appears that FI is able to weakly interact with C3b even in the absence of cofactor protein and that this binding induces conformational change in FI, as diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) can inhibit FI in complex with C3b (4Ekdahl K.N. Nilsson U.R. Nilsson B. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 4269-4274PubMed Google Scholar). A similar phenomenon was observed, but to a lesser degree, when FH was also present. However, no inhibition could be observed when FI and FH were incubated with diisopropyl fluorophosphate either alone or together. Direct albeit low affinity (0.7 mm at physiological ionic strength) binding between FI and C3b was demonstrated to be ionic strength-dependent (5DiScipio R.G. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2592-2599PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of FH, the affinity between C3b and FI increased manyfold. C4BP is a large plasma protein consisting of seven identical α-chains and a unique β-chain, which are linked together by short amphipathic helices that are further stabilized by disulfide bridges (6Kask L. Hillarp A. Ramesh B. Dahlbäck B. Blom A.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9349-9357Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The α- and β-chains contain eight and three complement control protein (CCP) modules, respectively. CCP modules consist of ∼60 amino acids forming a compact hydrophobic core that is surrounded by five or more β-strands organized into β-sheets (7Kirkitadze M.D. Barlow P.N. Immunol. Rev. 2001; 180: 146-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy of C4BP demonstrated a spider-like conformation with the seven α-chains forming extended tentacles (8Dahlbäck B. Smith C.A. Müller Eberhard H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Apart from acting as a cofactor to FI, C4BP also prevents formation of the C4bC2a complex, which is the classical pathway C3-converatse and accelerates its natural decay (19Gigli I. Fujita T. Nussenzweig V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 6596-6600Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Furthermore, C4BP acts as a FI cofactor in the cleavage of fluid phase C3b and therefore may contribute to regulation of the alternative pathway (20Blom A.M. Kask L. Dahlbäck B. Mol. Immunol. 2003; 39: 547-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Each α-chain of C4BP contains a C4b binding site, but most likely because of steric hindrance only up to four C4b can bind to one C4BP molecule (21Ziccardi R.J. Dahlbäck B. Müller Eberhard H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13674-13679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously localized the binding site for C4b to CCP1–3 (22Blom A.M. Kask L. Dahlbäck B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27136-27144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and identified an important cluster of positively charged amino acids at the interface between CCP1 and CCP2 that is required for the recognition of C4b (23Blom A.M. Webb J. Villoutreix B.O. Dahlbäck B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19237-19245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Cofactor activity of C4BP in the cleavage of C3b in addition requires CCP4 (i.e. CCP1–4) (20Blom A.M. Kask L. Dahlbäck B. Mol. Immunol. 2003; 39: 547-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The elucidation of the regulatory mechanisms of complement is hindered by the lack of structural information. To overcome these limitations, we have used a combination of molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis to study the FI cofactor activity of C4BP. In the present study we describe mutants K126Q/K128Q and F144S/F149S that are modified in residues clustered on CCP3 of the C4BP α-chain. These mutants were able to bind C4b/C3b and accelerate decay of classical C3-convertase comparably to the wild type C4BP. However, they could not act as cofactors in cleavage of C4b/C3b, most probably due to the fact that they did not induce conformational changes in C3b/C4b. cDNA Clones for Recombinant Proteins—Full-length cDNA coding for the human C4BP α-chain was cloned to a eucaryotic expression vector, pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). It was then used as the template, and the following mutations were introduced using the QuikChange site directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene): Met14 → Gln (primers: 5′-TTT GCT GCC CCG CAA GAT ATT ACG TTG-3′ and corresponding antisense primer); Lys126 → Gln/Lys128 → Gln (primers: 5′-CAA TGT GAA ATT GTC CAA TGT CAA CCT CCT CCA GAC ATC-3′ and corresponding antisense primer); Phe144 → Ser/Phe149 → Ser (primers: 5′-GGT GAA GAA AAT TCA TAC GCA TAC GGC TCT TCT GTC ACC TAC-3′ and corresponding antisense primer); and Thr28 → Gln/Thr47 → Gln (primers: 5′-AAA ACT GGA ACT CAA CTG AAA TAC ACC-3′ and 5′-AAC TCA GAC GCT CAA CTG TAA TTC TGA-3′ and corresponding antisense primers). Nucleotides corresponding to changed amino acid residues are underlined. All mutations were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).

J. 1980; 191: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) were purified as described in their respective references. C3, C3b, and C4b were purchased from Advanced Research Technologies. In some experiments requiring large amounts of protein, C4b- and C3b-like molecules (C4met/C3met) were used. C4met and C3met were prepared by incubation of purified C4 or C3 with 100 mm methylamine, pH 8–8.5, for 4 h at 37 °C and subsequent dialysis against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl. C1 and C2 were only functionally pure, i.e. they were devoid of other complement factors, whereas all the other proteins used in the study were at least 95% pure as judged by Coomassie staining of proteins separated by PAGE performed in the presence of SDS. All proteins were stored at –80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined from absorbance at 280 nm or amino acid analysis following 24 h of hydrolysis in 6 m HCl. C4b and C3b were labeled with 125I using the chloramine T method. The specific activity was 0.4–0.5 MBq/μg of protein. Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Human kidney 293 cells (American Type Culture Collection no. 1573-CRL) were transfected with the various C4BP constructs using Lipofectin according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The neomycin analogue G418 at a concentration of 400 μg/ml was used for selection of transfected cells. Colonies of cells showing the highest expression levels, as judged by immunoblotting, were expanded in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 3.4 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin and 400 μg/ml G418. Medium from transfected cells was collected in 3-day periods during which time the cells were cultured in OptiMEM Glutamax (Invitrogen). It was then stored in –20 °C until ∼4 liters of medium were collected. Medium was centrifuged for 30 min at 5000 × g to remove cell debris and applied at a flow of 90 ml/h on an affinity column with monoclonal antibody 104 (against CCP1 of α-chain) coupled to Affi-Gel 10 (2.6 cm x 12 cm; Bio-Rad) previously equilibrated with Tris-buffered saline. The column was washed with Tris-buffered saline, 1 m NaCl, and the recombinant protein was subsequently eluted with 3 m guanidinium chloride and dialyzed extensively against Tris-buffered saline. All preparative work was done at 4 °C. The total amount of each protein obtained was ∼8 mg, and the exact concentrations were determined from the amino acid composition analysis after 24 h of hydrolysis in 6 m HCl. Competition Assay (Binding of C4b)—Microtiter plates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 50 μl of solution containing 10 μg/ml C4b in 75 mm sodium carbonate, pH 9.6. The wells were washed three times with washing buffer and then incubated at room temperature with 200 μl of quench. After another three washes, the 125I-labeled plasma-purified C4BP was added (20 kcpm/well) together with various unlabeled proteins diluted in 25 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.5. The samples were incubated for 3 h at room temperature and washed five times, and the amount of radioactivity associated with each well was measured in a γ-counter. C4b/C3b Degradation Assay—200 nm C4BP was mixed with 750 nm C3b (or 250 nm C4b), 60 nm FI, and trace amounts of 125I-labeled C3b (or 125I-C4b) in 50 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, supplemented with 150 mm NaCl. The samples were incubated for 1.5 h at 37 °C, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS/PAGE sample buffer with reducing agent (dithiothreitol). The samples were then incubated at 95 °C for 3 min and applied on 10–15% gradient SDS/PAGE gels. The separated proteins were visualized by autoradiography or using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Circular Dichroism—The mutants were dialyzed extensively against 10 mm sodium phosphate and 100 mm NaF (pH 7.4) before analysis. Approximately 120 μg of each mutant were analyzed in the far UV region (185–250 nm). The resolution was 1 nm, the sensitivity 20 millidegrees, the speed was 10 nm/min, and every presented spectrum is the average of four measurements. Acceleration of Decay Rate of the Classical Pathway C3-convertase— Sheep erythrocytes were washed twice with the barbiturate buffer DGVB2+ (2.5 mm veronal buffer, pH 7.3, 70 mm NaCl, 140 mm glucose, 0.1% gelatin, 1 mm MgCl2 and 0.15 mm CaCl2), suspended at a concentration of 109 cells/ml, and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C with an equal volume of amboceptor (Behring Diagnostics; diluted 1:3000 in DGVB2+). Erythrocytes were then washed twice with ice-cold DGVB2+ and resuspended at 109 cells/ml. C1 was added dropwise to a final concentration of 4 μg/ml, and the mixture was incubated for 20 min at 30 °C. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold buffer and incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with 2 μg/ml C4. EAC142 cells were then generated by incubating EAC14 cells at 109 cells/ml with an equal volume of C2 diluted in DGVB2+ (final C2 concentration of ∼20 μg/ml). The cells were incubated for 5 min, which was equal to experimentally determined T max, centrifuged at 4 °C, and resuspended in DGVB2+ prewarmed to 30 °C and containing an inhibitor at several different dilutions. The mixtures were kept shaking at 30 °C for 5 min, and 50-μl aliquots were added to 100 μl of guinea pig serum diluted 1:30 in GVB-EDTA (2.5 mm veronal buffer, pH 7.3, containing 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% gelatin, and 40 mm EDTA). After 1 h at 37 °C the samples were centrifuged, and the amount of erythrocyte lysis was determined spectrophotometrically (A 405 nm). Prevention of the Classical Pathway C3-convertase Assembly—The EAC14 cells were generated as described above and incubated in DGVB2+ containing C2 alone (∼8 μg/ml) or together with an inhibitor. The mixtures were kept at 30 °C with constant shaking, and 50-μl aliquots were removed at time intervals and added to 100 μl of guinea pig serum diluted 1:30 in GVB-EDTA to measure residual C3-convertase activity. After 60 min of incubation at 37 °C, the samples were centrifuged, and lysis of the erythrocytes was determined spectrophotometrically. 8-Anilino-1-napthalenesulfnate (ANS) Fluorescence Measurement— ANS fluorescence emission spectra were recorded in a Fluoromax-3 spectrometer (Jobin Yvone). C3met or C4met (0.7 μm each) in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and 100 mm NaCl were incubated with 20 μm ANS in the presence of several concentrations of wild type C4BP or the mutants. Excitation was at 368 nm, and emission was recorded at 475 nm using 1.50-nm band pass excitation and emission slits. Measurements were performed at 25 °C. The fluorescence signal obtained from the buffer alone, ∼15% of the signal obtained for C3met, was subtracted. The signal obtained for each concentration of C4BP alone was also subtracted. Selection of Mutants and Assessment of Their Structural Integrity—Our three-dimensional model of the C4BP α-chain (29Villoutreix B.O. Härdig Y. Wallqvist A. Covell D.G. Garcia de Frutos P. Dahlbäck B. Proteins. 1998; 31: 391-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) was used as the basis for the selection of mutations. Several mutants were produced, but only two of them (K126Q/K128Q and F144S/F149S), located in CCP3 (Fig. 1), provided new insights into the cofactor activity of C4BP. The residues that were targets for the mutagenesis were solvent-exposed and not involved in any clear stabilizing interactions with the remaining parts of the molecule (i.e. salt bridges), and the amino acid substitutions were therefore expected to be well tolerated. The C4BP mutants as well as the wild type molecule were expressed in eucaryotic cells and purified from cell culture media using affinity chromatography. The expression levels of the wild type and mutant C4BP were similar, and ∼2 mg of pure protein was obtained from 1 liter of culture medium. Purified proteins migrated with similar mobilities upon electrophoresis (Fig. 2A) and polymerized correctly into hexamers (not shown). We also assessed the structural integrity of the mutants by circular dichroism analysis, and the results are presented as strength of the signal relative to the lowest point (millidegrees per second) measured (Fig. 2B). Both mutants yielded very similar spectra to the wild type C4BP, once more confirming that mutagenesis did not cause folding problems.Fig. 2Analysis of purified C4BP mutants by SDS/PAGE and circular dichroism. A, wild type recombinant C4BP and the mutants (∼2 μg/well) were separated by SDS/PAGE on 10% gel under educing conditions. Proteins were then visualized by Coomassie staining. B, CD spectra obtained for the wild type C4BP and the mutants are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Mutagenesis of C4BP and Loss of FI Cofactor Function—To elucidate whether the FI cofactor activity of the C4BP variants was affected, they were incubated with C4b, FI, and trace amounts of 125I-labeled C4b. Proteins were then separated by SDS/PAGE, and C4b was visualized by autoradiography (Fig. 3, top panel). In the presence of FI and the wild type C4BP, the α-chain subunit of C4b disappeared, and a strong band corresponding to a degradation fragment (C4d) became apparent. Two C4BP variants, M14Q and T28Q/T47Q, were equally good cofactors as the wild type. However, both the K126Q/K128Q and the F144S/F149S mutants lost their ability to act as FI cofactors in the cleavage of C4b. To assess the ability of the mutants to function as cofactors in the cleavage of C3b, a degradation assay similar to the one described previously for C4b was used. After incubation of 125I-C3b, FI and C4BP radioactively labeled fragments of C3b (68 kDa and 43/46 kDa, respectively) were visualized by autoradiography. Similarly to cleavage of C4b, we found that the two mutants, K126Q/K128Q and F144S/F149S, lost their ability to act as FI cofactors in the cleavage of C3b, whereas the M14Q and T28Q/T47Q variants were good cofactors (Fig. 3, bottom panel). Mutagenesis of C4BP Is Not Associated with Loss of Binding to C4b and C3b—To assess whether the lost cofactor activity of C4BP mutants was due to decreased binding of C4b, we first used a competition assay in which the wild type and the mutants were allowed to compete with wild type 125I-C4BP for binding to C4b immobilized in wells of a microtiter plate. None of the mutants studied showed decreased binding to C4b, whereas the F144S/F149S mutant bound C4b ∼3-fold better than the wild type (Fig. 4). Furthermore, we determined the affinity of binding between C4BP mutants and C4b using surface plasmon resonance (BIAcore). Wild type C4BP and the mutants were immobilized via amino coupling in separate flow cells of CM5 chip, and C4met at various concentrations was injected over the surface. Binding was recorded in arbitrary resonance units, and the signal obtained from the empty control flow cell was subtracted. Obtained sensograms were evaluated using a steady state affinity model (BIAevaluation 3.0). In agreement with results obtained in competition assay, the F144S/F149S mutant bound C4met with 3-fold higher affinity than the wild type (Table I). The addition of 20 μm ZnCl2 increased the affinity of the wild type and the mutants up to KD = 0.1 μm, and the difference in affinity was no longer apparent. We also analyzed binding of C3met to C4BP under the same conditions; this interaction is weaker than C4met-C4BP and requires the presence of zinc for detection. Both mutants and wild type C4BP bound C3met with the same affinity. Taken together, these results suggest that the mutagenesis did not decrease binding affinity between C4BP and C4b/C3b.Table ISummary of surface plasmon resonance analysis (equilibrium dissociation constants)C4BPKD C4ba150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA.KD C4bb50 mm NaCl, 20 μm ZnCl2.KD C3bb50 mm NaCl, 20 μm ZnCl2.Wild type7.31e-71.09e-78.88e-8K126Q/K128Q4.37e-79.54e-87.78e-8F144S/F149S2.54e-79.89e-87.39e-8a 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA.b 50 mm NaCl, 20 μm ZnCl2. Open table in a new tab Mutagenesis of C4BP Is Not Associated with Loss of Ability to Inhibit Classical C3-convertase—C4BP is known to efficiently prevent assembly of the classical C3-convertase (complex of C4b and C2a), and we used a hemolytic assay to test whether the C4BP mutants retained this ability. EAC14 cells were incubated with C2 alone or together with C4BP variants. At intervals, aliquots were drawn and incubated with guinea pig serum, a source of C3 and the terminal complement components. The degree of erythrocyte lysis was determined spectrometrically, and the results were expressed in terms of Z, which represents the number of EAC142 sites formed and equals the natural negative logarithm of (1–percentage lysis). Z obtained at T max in the absence of inhibitor (–1) was set as 100%. C4BP inhibited the assembly of the C3-convertase by 50% at the used concentration (Fig. 5A). None of the C4BP mutants used in this study showed decreased ability to inhibit assembly of C3-converase when compared with the wild type. In agreement with its increased affinity for C4b, the F144S/F149S mutant was ∼2.5-fold more efficient than the wild type in preventing assembly of the convertase. A hemolytic assay was also used to test whether the decay-accelerating property of C4BP variants was affected. EAC142 cells were generated by incubating EAC14 with C2 for 5 min (equal to the T max obtained in the previous experiment). The cells were then centrifuged and resuspended in DGVB2+ (control) or DGVB2+ containing varying concentrations of C4BP variants. After 5 min of incubation, guinea pig serum was added to determine the remaining convertase activity. Z obtained in DGVB2+ without inhibitor was set as 100% in each experiment. Wild type C4BP accelerated decay of the C3-convertase in dose-dependent manner, and so did the mutants (Fig. 5B). Again, the F144S/F149S mutant was significantly more efficient than the wild type, but none of the mutants lost the ability to accelerate decay of the convertase. Mutagenesis of C4BP Is Associated with Loss of Ability to Induce Conformational Change in C3b/C4b—Both C3b and C4b are able to bind a hydrophobic probe (ANS), and the binding can be measured as a fluorescence signal. We have found that ANS signal for both C3b and C4b decreased in the presence of the wild type C4BP but was not affected by the K126Q/K128Q and F144S/F149S mutants (Fig. 6). The significant difference between the wild type and the mutants suggests that the latter ones are not able to induce conformational change in C3b and C4b. Complement inhibitors act on key components of the converging pathways of complement to prevent pathological con-sequences of unwanted complement activation. The inhibitors bind C4b and C3b, and these interactions have two consequences, i.e. decay acceleration of C3-convertases that contain C4b/C3b and the degradation of these factors by proteinase FI. In recent years, significant efforts have been made to elucidate the binding sites for C3b and C4b on various cofactor proteins such as C4BP, complement receptor 1 (CR1), membrane cofactor protein (MCP), and FH. However, the mechanism by which the cofactors assist in the cleavage of FI is not clear. FI is only able to cleave C3b/C4b when they are bound to a cofactor molecule and there is no doubt about the direct interaction of C4b/C3b with cofactor molecules. But it is not clear whether FI interacts only with bound C4b/C3b or if it is also able to form contacts with the cofactor proteins (e.g. C4BP). It has been suggested that there is a direct molecular interaction between FI and C3b leading to conformational change in FI (4Ekdahl K.N. Nilsson U.R. Nilsson B. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 4269-4274PubMed Google Scholar). This, however, is not enough to result in the cleavage of C3b in the absence of a cofactor. For several complement regulators, CR1, MCP, decay accelerating factor (DAF), and FH, the involvement of individual CCP domains in the complement regulatory function and binding of C4b/C3b has been investigated. In the case of the decay accelerating factor (four CCPs), it was shown that the classical pathway C3-convertase regulatory function resides within CCP2 and CCP3, whereas regulation of the alternative pathway requires CCP1, CCP2, and CCP3 (31Brodbeck W.G. Liu D. Sperry J. Mold C. Medof M.E. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2528-2533PubMed Google Scholar). In MCP (four CCPs), sites for C4b/C3b interaction have been mapped primarily to CCP2, CCP3, and CCP4 (32Adams E.M. Brown M.C. Nunge M. Krych M. Atkinson J.P. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3005-3011PubMed Google Scholar, 33Iwata K. Seya T. Yanagi Y. Pesando J.M. Johnson P.M. Okabe M. Ueda S. Ariga H. Nagasawa S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15148-15152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In FH (20 CCPs), there are three C3b binding sites localized to CCP1–4 (34Alsenz J. Lambris J.D.

Full ligand binding (C4b and C3b) and functional activity requires the first four CCPs in each repeat (39Klickstein L.B. Bartow T.J. Miletic V. Rabson L.D. Smith J.A. Fearon D.T. J. Exp.

Taken together, analysis of several complement regulators suggests that a basic C3b/C4b binding unit consists of 3–4 CCP domains. Both CR1 and MCP were subjected to extensive mutagenesis, and several important observations concerning binding and cofactor activity of these proteins were made. For both proteins, the reduction of positive charge decreased binding of both C4b and C3b, whereas the introduction of additional positive charge increased binding (41Krych M. Clemenza L. Howdeshell D. Hauhart R. Hourcade D. Atkinson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13273-13278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Krych M. Hauhart R. Atkinson J.P. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37692-37701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the binding is based on ionic interactions between positively charged amino acids on cofactor protein and the negatively charged amino termini of the α′ chains of C3b and C4b (44Oran A.E. Isenman D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5120-5130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A reduction in binding of C4b/C3b always produced a proportional decrease in cofactor activity. However, the reverse was not always true, because for both CR1 and MCP, mutants were observed that bound ligands similar to wild type, whereas their cofactor activities were reduced (41Krych M.

Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37692-37701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The authors suggested that cofactor activity is a two-step process requiring ligand binding and an interaction with the protease. We have shown previously that CCP 1–3 of C4BP α-chain are required for the binding of C4b and the cofactor activity (22Blom A.M. Kask L. Dahlbäck B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27136-27144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Binding is based to a large extent on ionic interactions and requires a cluster of positively charged amino acids at the interface between CCP1 and CCP2 (23Blom A.M. Webb J. Villoutreix B.O. Dahlbäck B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19237-19245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). C4BP is also a cofactor in the cleavage of C3b and, in that case, CCP1–4 are required (20Blom A.M. Kask L. Dahlbäck B. Mol. Immunol. 2003; 39: 547-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have identified a patch of amino acids on CCP3 that selectively affect cofactor activity of C4BP in the cleavage of both C3b and C4b. Mutagenesis did not affect affinity for C4b or the ability of C4BP to prevent assembly or accelerate decay of the classical C3-convertase. We believe that there are two possible explanations for these observations. Either the C4b/C3b molecules do not undergo conformational change upon binding to these mutants, or the mutated amino acids form an FI-binding site. We were not able to set up any assay that could measure binding of FI to C4b/C4BP complex, but we have used fluorescence spectroscopy to determine whether C4b/C3b undergo conformational change upon binding to C4BP and its mutants. It was shown previously that conversion of C3 to C3b is associated with an increase in surface hydrophobicity, which can be measured as an increase in ANS fluorescence (30Isenman D.E. Kells D.I.C. Cooper N.R. Muller-Eberhard H.J. Pangburn M.K. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4458-4467Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The increase is abrogated upon binding of C3b to a cofactor and even more so after cleavage by FI (3Isenman D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4238-4244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have found that C4BP had a similar effect on the binding of ANS to C3b as reported previously for FH. However, the mutants did not affect ANS fluorescence in a significant way. We have also found that ANS binding to C4b decreased in the presence of wild type C4BP but that the mutants had no effect. Taken together, this suggests that the K126Q/K128Q and F144S/F149S mutants bind C3b and C4b but do not induce conformational changes required for binding/cleavage of FI. Additional support for this hypothesis comes from the experiment in which we have tested cofactor activity of C4BP in degradation of C4b and C3b in the presence of increasing concentrations of FI. No cofactor activity was observed even at very high FI concentrations (results not shown), excluding the possibility that the mutants have impaired ability to bind FI, as effects of decreased affinity would be alleviated by increased concentration of FI. Our mutagenesis data provide the first set of information discriminating the ligand binding sites and the cofactor sites of C4BP. However, full understanding of these reactions will require further structure-function studies. For instance, our future plans include determination of the structure of CCP1–4 of the C4BP α-chain by NMR spectroscopy and computer docking experiments, which will allow further interpretation of our mutagenesis results. Investigations of interaction between C4BP and its ligands should have important implications for understanding the mechanisms involved in the inhibition of the complement system and in microbial pathogenesis. We thank Mrs. Astra Andersson for excellent technical assistance and Lena Kask for collecting the CD spectra."
https://openalex.org/W1998506436,"Recently, we reported that in crude enzyme preparations, a monocyte-derived soluble protein (M-DSP) renders 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) activity Ca2+-dependent. Here we provide evidence that this M-DSP is glutathione peroxidase (GPx)-1. Thus, the inhibitory effect of the M-DSP on 5-LO could be overcome by the GPx-1 inhibitor mercaptosuccinate and by the broad spectrum GPx inhibitor iodoacetate, as well as by addition of 13(S)-hydroperoxy-9Z,11E-octadecadienoic acid (13(S)-HPODE). Also, the chromatographic characteristics and the estimated molecular mass (80–100 kDa) of the M-DSP fit to GPx-1 (87 kDa), and GPx-1, isolated from bovine erythrocytes, mimicked the effects of the M-DSP. Intriguingly, only a trace amount of thiol (10 μm GSH) was required for reduction of 5-LO activity by GPx-1 or the M-DSP. Moreover, the requirement of Ca2+ allowing 5-LO product synthesis in various leukocytes correlated with the respective GPx-1 activities. Mutation of the Ca2+ binding sites within the C2-like domain of 5-LO resulted in strong reduction of 5-LO activity by M-DSP and GPx-1, also in the presence of Ca2+. In summary, our data suggest that interaction of Ca2+ at the C2-like domain of 5-LO protects the enzyme against the effect of GPx-1. Apparently, in the presence of Ca2+, a low lipid hydroperoxide level is sufficient for 5-LO activation. Recently, we reported that in crude enzyme preparations, a monocyte-derived soluble protein (M-DSP) renders 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) activity Ca2+-dependent. Here we provide evidence that this M-DSP is glutathione peroxidase (GPx)-1. Thus, the inhibitory effect of the M-DSP on 5-LO could be overcome by the GPx-1 inhibitor mercaptosuccinate and by the broad spectrum GPx inhibitor iodoacetate, as well as by addition of 13(S)-hydroperoxy-9Z,11E-octadecadienoic acid (13(S)-HPODE). Also, the chromatographic characteristics and the estimated molecular mass (80–100 kDa) of the M-DSP fit to GPx-1 (87 kDa), and GPx-1, isolated from bovine erythrocytes, mimicked the effects of the M-DSP. Intriguingly, only a trace amount of thiol (10 μm GSH) was required for reduction of 5-LO activity by GPx-1 or the M-DSP. Moreover, the requirement of Ca2+ allowing 5-LO product synthesis in various leukocytes correlated with the respective GPx-1 activities. Mutation of the Ca2+ binding sites within the C2-like domain of 5-LO resulted in strong reduction of 5-LO activity by M-DSP and GPx-1, also in the presence of Ca2+. In summary, our data suggest that interaction of Ca2+ at the C2-like domain of 5-LO protects the enzyme against the effect of GPx-1. Apparently, in the presence of Ca2+, a low lipid hydroperoxide level is sufficient for 5-LO activation. 5-Lipoxygenase (5-LO) 1The abbreviations used are: 5-LO, 5-lipoxygenase; AA, arachidonic acid; ATP-PT, ATP affinity column pass-through fraction; BAPTA/AM, [1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl) ester]; cPLA2, cytosolic phospholipase A2; GPx, glutathione peroxidase; 13(S)-HPODE, 13(S)-hydroperoxy-9Z,11E-octadecadienoic acid; LOOH, lipid hydroperoxide; LT, leukotriene; MM6, Mono Mac 6; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PMNL, polymorphonuclear leukocytes; RBL-1, rat basophilic leukemia-1; wt, wild type; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography.1The abbreviations used are: 5-LO, 5-lipoxygenase; AA, arachidonic acid; ATP-PT, ATP affinity column pass-through fraction; BAPTA/AM, [1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl) ester]; cPLA2, cytosolic phospholipase A2; GPx, glutathione peroxidase; 13(S)-HPODE, 13(S)-hydroperoxy-9Z,11E-octadecadienoic acid; LOOH, lipid hydroperoxide; LT, leukotriene; MM6, Mono Mac 6; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PMNL, polymorphonuclear leukocytes; RBL-1, rat basophilic leukemia-1; wt, wild type; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. catalyzes the initial steps in the biosynthesis of leukotrienes (LTs) and 5(S)-hydro(pero)xyeicosatetraenoic acid (5(S)-H(P)ETE) from arachidonic acid (AA) (for review, see Ref. 1Rådmark O. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 161: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Due to the pivotal biological functions of 5-LO metabolites (2Samuelsson B. Dahlén S.-E. Lindgren J.-Å.

In intact cells, Ca2+ and phosphorylation seem to be primary signals that activate 5-LO. Moreover, the membrane-bound 5-LO-activating protein (FLAP) (4Miller D.K. Gillard J.W. Vickers P.J.

Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 161: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, the degree of stimulation by each of these components depends on the assay conditions, i.e. the source of 5-LO (isolated, in crude homogenates or cellular fractions), presence of other cofactors, the concentration of AA, etc. LOOH are of importance for the initial conversion of the active site iron from the ferrous (resting) to the ferric (active) state (7Hammarberg T.

Half-maximal activation of purified 5-LO was determined at 1–2 μm Ca2+, whereas 4–10 μm Ca2+ causes maximal activation of the enzyme (20Noguchi M. Miyano M. Matsumoto T. Noma M.

Biochem. 1992; 210: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In intact cells lower concentrations of Ca2+ (200–300 nm) seem to be sufficient for 5-LO activation (22Schatz-Munding M.

Nevertheless, the mechanisms of how Ca2+ stimulates 5-LO activity may involve additional factors.Several reports state that in cell-free systems 5-LO is catalytically active without Ca2+ (see Ref. 29Bürkert E. Rådmark B. Steinhilber D. Werz O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 985-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar and references therein), and in intact cells, 5-LO phosphorylation by members of the MAP kinase family stimulate 5-LO product synthesis in the absence of Ca2+ (30Werz O.

A. 2000; 97: 5261-5266Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Mg2+ at concentrations that occur in intact cells, can substitute for Ca2+ regarding binding and activation of 5-LO in vitro (19Hammarberg T. Provost P. Persson B. Rådmark O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38787-38793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 33Reddy K.V. Hammarberg T. Rådmark O. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1840-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We observed considerable 5-LO product synthesis in homogenates of human PMNL and rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-1 cells in the absence of Ca2+, whereas Ca2+ was required for 5-LO activity in homogenates of monocytic MM6 cells under the same assay conditions (29Bürkert E. Rådmark B. Steinhilber D. Werz O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 985-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 34Bürkert E. Szellas D. Rådmark O. Steinhilber D. Werz O. J. Leuk. Biol. 2003; 73: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that an 80–100 kDa soluble protein from MM6 cells renders 5-LO activity Ca2+-dependent. In this study we provide evidence that this M-DSP is GPx-1 and we suggest that Ca2+, via interaction with the C2 domain of 5-LO, renders the enzyme resistant against GPx-1, possibly by increasing the affinity toward activating LOOH.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—RPMI 1640 medium was from GIBCO and fetal calf serum was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany). Insulin was a gift from Aventis (Frankfurt, Germany). Human transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFβ1) was purified from outdated platelets as described (35Werz O. Brungs M. Steinhilber D.

Cells were harvested for experiments 3 days after splitting. MM6 cells were cultured and differentiated with TGFβ and calcitriol as described (36Brungs M. Rådmark O. Samuelsson B. Steinhilber D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar).Human PMNL were promptly isolated from fresh leukocyte concentrates obtained from healthy donors at St Markus Hospital (Frankfurt, Germany) as described (31Werz O. Buerkert E. Samuelsson B. Rådmark O. Steinhilber D. Blood. 2002; 99: 1044-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Cells were finally resuspended in PBS plus 1 mg/ml glucose (PG buffer) or PBS plus 1 mg/ml glucose and 1 mm CaCl2 (PGC buffer) as indicated.Preparation of 100,000 × g Supernatants and Partial Purification of 5-LO—Freshly isolated PMNL (5 × 108), MM6 cells (2 × 108), or RBL-1 cells (2 × 108), were resuspended in 10 ml of PBS containing 1 mm EDTA. After cooling down on ice for 10 min, cells were homogenized by sonification (3 × 10 s). After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 70 min at 4 °C, the 100,000 × g supernatant (S100) was applied to an ATP-agarose column, and the column was eluted as described previously (36Brungs M. Rådmark O. Samuelsson B. Steinhilber D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Purified 5-LO and ATP affinity column pass-through fractions (ATP-PT) were immediately used for 5-LO activity assays.Site-directed Mutagenesis, Expression, and Purification of Recombinant 5-LO Proteins—Site-directed mutagenesis of the pT3–5LO plasmid, encoding wild type 5-LO (wt-5-LO), using the Quickchange™ kit from Stratagene yielded the mutated 5-LO plasmid pT3–5LO-N43A-D44A-E46A (referred to as loop2 mut-5LO) (19Hammarberg T.

Wild type and mutant DNAs were transformed into Escherichia coli MV1190, proteins were expressed and purified as described (37Werz O. Szellas D. Henseler M. Steinhilber D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 445-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and immediately assayed for activity.Determination of 5-LO Product Formation; in Vitro Activity Assays— For assays of intact cells in the presence of Ca2+, 7.5 × 106 freshly isolated PMNL, 3 × 106 MM6 or 2 × 106 RBL-1 cells were finally resuspended in 1 ml of PGC buffer. The reaction was started by addition of ionophore A23187 and exogenous AA. After 10 min at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped with 1 ml of methanol and 30 μl of 1 n HCl, and 200 ng of prostaglandin B1 and 500 μl of PBS were added. Formed 5-LO metabolites were extracted and analyzed by HPLC as described (38Steinhilber D. Herrmann T. Roth H.J. J. Chromatogr. 1989; 493: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). 5-LO product formation is expressed as nanograms of 5-LO products per 106 cells, which includes LTB4 and its all-trans isomers, 5(S),12(S)-dihydroxy-6,10-trans-8,14-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid (5(S),12(S)-DiHETE), 5(S)-hydroxy-6-trans-8,11,14-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE), and 5(S)-hydroperoxy-6-trans-8,11,14-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-HPETE). 5-HETE and 5-HPETE coelute as one major peak, integration of this peak represents both eicosanoids. Cysteinyl LTs (LTC4, D4, and E4) were not detected and oxidation products of LTB4 were not determined.When broken cell preparations or purified 5-LO were assayed, S100 or partially purified 5-LO enzyme (in the presence or absence of ATP-PTs) were diluted in ice-cold PBS containing 1 mm EDTA (final volume, 1 ml) and 1 mm ATP as well as other agents (as indicated) were added. The samples were preincubated for 30 s at 37 °C, and the incubation was started by the addition of AA together with or without 2 mm CaCl2 and other compounds as indicated. After 10 min at 37 °C, the incubation was stopped with 1 ml methanol and the formed 5-LO products were extracted and analyzed by HPLC as described for intact cells.SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting of GPx-1—Aliquots (18 μl) of the fractions from the gel-permeation chromatography were mixed with 2 μl of 10× SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 10 mm EDTA, 25% (w/v) SDS, 25 mm dithiothreitol) and 4 μl of glycerol/0.1% bromphenol blue (1:1, v/v), heated at 95 °C for 5 min and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 12% gel. After electroblot to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences), blocking with 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature, membranes were washed and incubated with polyclonal anti-human GPx-1/catalase antibody (Dunn Labortechnik, Asbach, Germany, see Ref. 12Straif D. Werz O. Kellner R. Bahr U. Steinhilber D. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were washed and incubated with 1:1,000 dilution of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated IgGs (Sigma) for 2 h at RT. After washing, proteins were visualized with nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate (Sigma) in detection buffer (100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 9.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2).Determination of Cellular Peroxide Formation—Measurement of peroxides was conducted using the peroxide-sensitive fluorescence dye 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA). Freshly isolated PMNL (5 × 106 in 1 ml of PGC buffer), differentiated MM6 cells or RBL-1 cells (3 × 106 cells in 1 ml PGC buffer) were preincubated with DCF-DA (1 μg/ml) for 2 min at 37 °C in a thermally controlled (37 °C) fluorimeter cuvette with continuous stirring in a spectrofluorometer (Aminco-Bowman series 2). The fluorescence emission at 530 nm was measured after excitation at 480 nm. The mean fluorescence data measured 5 min after stimulus addition are expressed as fold increase over unstimulated cells.Determination of Glutathione Peroxidase Activity—GPx activity in S100 of PMNL, MM6, and RBL-1 cells or fractions of the gel-permeation chromatography was measured according to the indirect GSH reductase-coupled method described by Wendel (39Wendel A. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 77: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar). One unit GPx activity was defined as the conversion of 0.5 μmol of NADPH to NADP+ per min at 37 °C and 1 mm GSH. GPx activity is expressed as milliunits/106 cells.Measurement of Intracellular Ca2 + Levels—Cells (1 × 107 in 1 ml of PGC buffer) were incubated with 2 μm Fura-2/AM for 30 min at 37 °C, washed, resuspended in 1 ml of PGC buffer and transferred into a thermally controlled (37 °C) fluorimeter cuvette in a spectrofluorometer (Aminco-Bowman series 2) with continuous stirring. The fluorescence emission at 510 nm was measured after excitation at 340 and 380 nm, respectively. Intracellular Ca2+ levels were calculated according to the method of Grynkiewicz et al. (40Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Fmax (maximal fluorescence) was obtained by lysing the cells with 1% Triton-X 100 and Fmin by chelating Ca2+ with 10 mm EDTA.RESULTSIdentification of Glutathione Peroxidase-1 as a M-DSP That Renders 5-LO Activity Ca2 + -dependent—We attempted to identify the recently described M-DSP, which suppresses the activity of 5-LO in the absence of Ca2+ (29Bürkert E. Rådmark B. Steinhilber D. Werz O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 985-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Based on the apparent molecular mass (80–100 kDa) determined by gel-permeation chromatography, it appeared possible that the M-DSP is GPx-1, which was recently identified as a regulator of cellular 5-LO activity in monocytic cells (12Straif D. Werz O. Kellner R. Bahr U. Steinhilber D. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, GPx-1 protein and GPx activity indeed co-eluted with the 5-LO inhibitory activity of the M-DSP during gel-permeation chromatography.Next, we investigated if agents that suppress or counteract GPx-1 activity could overcome the effect of the M-DSP. Control experiments confirmed that partially purified 5-LO from MM6 cells alone is catalytically active, regardless of Ca2+. When aliquots of the MM6 ATP-PT were added back to 5-LO, 5-LO activity was enhanced about 4-fold in the presence of Ca2+. However, without Ca2+, 5-LO activity was completely suppressed (Fig. 1B). The specific GPx-1 inhibitor mercaptosuccinate (30 μm) (41Chaudiere J. Wilhelmsen E.C. Tappel A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1043-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as the broad spectrum GPx inhibitor iodoacetate (2 mm, not shown) (42Roveri A. Maiorino M. Ursini F. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 202-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), were capable of reconstituting 5-LO activity. Also, 13(S)-HPODE (3 μm), that counteracts GPx-1 activity (16Werz O. Szellas D. Steinhilber D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1263-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) was able to prevent the 5-LO inhibitory action of the MM6-ATP-PT, whereas H2O2 (1–100 μm) and 13-oxo-octadecadienoic acid (3 up to 30 μm) had no effect. Similarly, 5-LO suppression induced by aliquots of the 80–100 kDa fractions of the gel-permeation chromatography was inhibited by mercaptosuccinate, iodoacetate or 13(S)-HPODE (not shown). By contrast, these agents did not alter 5-LO activity in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 1B). Notably, in all these experiments, no exogenous thiols such as GSH or dithiothreitol were added to the incubation mixtures, but it should be noted that the MM6-ATP-PT by itself contains traces of thiols, originally derived from the intracellular environment.In S100 of MM6 cells, 5-LO is catalytically active only when Ca2+ is present, but not when Ca2+ is omitted (29Bürkert E. Rådmark B. Steinhilber D. Werz O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 985-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Also under such experimental settings mercaptosuccinate, iodoacetate, or 13(S)-HPODE were able to overcome 5-LO suppression in the absence of Ca2+ (not shown). In contrast to MM6 cells, Ca2+ is not needed for 5-LO activity in S100 from PMNL (34Bürkert E. Szellas D. Rådmark O. Steinhilber D. Werz O. J. Leuk. Biol. 2003; 73: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and these cells exert only low GPx activity (Table I). However, when aliquots of the MM6-ATP-PT were added to S100 of PMNL in the absence of Ca2+ (but not in its presence), 5-LO activity was strongly suppressed (Fig. 2A). At a fixed concentration of GPx-1, variation of the amount of 5-LO enzyme in the incubation mixture did not alter the degree of 5-LO inhibition. Thus, the amounts of 5-LO products formed in 1 ml incubations containing S100 of PMNL derived from 2.5, 5, 10 or 15 × 106 cells was 215 ± 52, 462 ± 147, 745 ± 170, and 988 ± 282 ng/ml, respectively. Inclusion of MM6-ATP-PT corresponding to 2 × 106 cells suppressed the 5-LO activities in all of these incubations by 93–97%. Again, mercaptosuccinate, iodoacetate or 13(S)-HPODE, but not H2O2, counteracted the 5-LO inhibitory effects of the MM6-ATP-PT (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, 5-LO activity in PMNL-S100 was considerably suppressed when 5 mm GSH, the main co-substrate of GPx-1, was included, leading to strong catalysis of GPx (Fig. 2B).

GPx-1, isolated from bovine erythrocytes, was added to S100 of PMNL and 5-LO activity, without supplementation of thiols, was determined. Addition of isolated GPx-1 to PMNL-S100 inhibited 5-LO activity in a dose-dependent manner with an EC50 of ∼70 mU/ml GPx-1 in the absence but not in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 3A). As found for MM6-ATP-PT, the degree of 5-LO inhibition at a fixed amount of GPx-1 (200 mU) was about the same for S100 of 2.5, 5, 10 or 15 × 106 PMNL as source of 5-LO (not shown). As shown in Fig. 3B, the strong inhibition of 5-LO in PMNL-S100 by 300 mU bovine GPx-1 was almost completely reversed by mercaptosuccinate or 13(S)-HPODE (but not by H2O2), resembling the counteracting effects observed with the MM6-ATP-PT.

Thus, the PMNL-S100 was subjected to ATP affinity chromatography, and the pass through fraction, was separated into a high (>10 kDa) and a low molecular mass (<10 kDa) fraction by gel-permeation chromatography using a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences). When the low molecular mass fraction was included in the incubation mixture (containing purified 5-LO and isolated GPx-1), 5-LO was suppressed by GPx-1 in the absence of Ca2+ (but not in its presence) (Fig. 4). The high molecular mass fraction rather increased 5-LO activity regardless of Ca2+. Notably, addition of 10 μm GSH (0.307 kDa), could replace the low molecular mass fraction, rendering"

For example, the 43-kDa chymotryptic fragment of the cytoplasmic portion of red cell membrane Band 3 protein and its corresponding N-terminal 11-residue synthetic peptide lower the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin but effects on cooperativity are unclear. Using highly purified preparations, we also find a lowered Hill coefficient (n values <2) at subequivalent ratios of Band 3 fragment or of synthetic peptide to Hb, resulting in an oxygen affinity that is moderately decreased and a partially hyperbolic shape for the O2 binding curve. Both normal HbA and sickle HbS display this property. Thus, the determinant responsible for the Hb cooperativity decreases by the 43-kDa fragment resides within its first 11 N-terminal residues. This effect is observed in the absence of chloride and is reversed by its addition. As effector to Hb ratios approach equivalence or with saturating chloride normal cooperativity is restored, and oxygen affinity is further lowered because the shape of the oxygen binding curve becomes completely sigmoidal. The relative efficiencies of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG), the 43-kDa Band 3 fragment, and the 11-residue synthetic peptide in lowering cooperativity are very similar. The findings are explained based on the stereochemical mechanism of cooperativity because of two populations of T-state hemoglobin tetramers, one with bound effector and the other with free (Perutz, M. F. (1989) Q. Rev. Biophys. 22, 139–237). As a result of this property, hemoglobin at the membrane inner surface in contact with the N-terminal region of Band 3 could preferentially bind O2 at low oxygen tension and then release it upon saturation with 2,3-diphosphoglycerate in the interior of the red cell. Membrane modulation of hemoglobin oxygen affinity has particularly interesting implications for the polymerization of hemoglobin S in the sickle red cell.

Membrane modulation of hemoglobin oxygen affinity has particularly interesting implications for the polymerization of hemoglobin S in the sickle red cell. Interactions of red cell membrane components with each other and with intracellular molecules play important physiological roles in both normal and sickle cells (1Low P.S. Agre P. Parker J.C. Red Blood Cell Membranes. Marcel Dekker, New York1989: 237-260Google Scholar, 2Platt O.S. Embury S.H. Hebbel R.P. Mohandes N. Steinberg M.H. Sickle Cell Disease: Basic Principles and Clinical Practice. Raven Press, New York1994: 125-137Google Scholar). The 43-kDa cytoplasmic fragment of red cell membrane Band 3 (also called the anion exchanger protein, AE1) is in contact with red cell components, both membrane-bound and free in the cytoplasm. Among these are several glycolytic enzymes including aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and phosphofructokinase as well as other membrane components such as ankyrin and protein 4.1. The structure of the Band 3 cytoplasmic fragment, which is obtained by selective chymotryptic cleavage, has recently been reported (3Zhang D. Keyatkin A. Bolin J.T. Low P.S. Blood. 2000; 96: 2925-2933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and shows that its N-terminal region protrudes from the main body of the structure presumably enabling it to interact with such a variety of other red cell components. There have also been a number of reports that it interacts with hemoglobin to a significant extent (4Cassoly R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3859-3864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Chetrite G. Cassoly R. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 639-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 6Salhany J.M Cordes K.A.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11909-11916Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). An x-ray crystallographic structure of a complex between deoxy-Hb and a synthetic 11-residue peptide corresponding to the N terminus of the cytoplasmic fragment has been published (8Walder J.A. Chatterjee R. Steck T.L. Low P.S. Musso G.F. Kaiser E.T. Rogers P.H. Arnone A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10238-10246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A functional consequence of this interaction was to lower the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin, but no effect on cooperativity was reported in the presence of the peptide although a reduced n value was observed in the presence of the intact Band 3 chymotryptic fragment. No correlation of this effect with the relative concentrations of either was made. Intact red cell membrane preparations (ghosts) also lower Hb oxygen affinity and lead to reduced cooperativity (9Tsuneshige A. Imai K. Tyuma I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 101: 695-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, this report did not focus on the Band 3/Hb relationship nor directly address the specific source of the reduced cooperativity in the membrane preparation. In the present communication we describe how hemoglobin cooperativity as well as oxygen affinity are both influenced by highly purified Band 3 cytoplasmic fragments and its corresponding synthetic N-terminal peptide, and we establish the stoichiometry for this relationship. We also investigate the competing effects of chloride with both Band 3 43-kDa fragment and its N-terminal peptide on Hb functional properties. Hemoglobin subunits within the tetramer exhibit cooperative behavior during the transition between the oxy (R-state) and deoxy (T-state) conformations giving rise to the sigmoidal O2 binding curve. This sigmoidal shape endows hemoglobin with important physiological properties because it maximizes binding or release of O2 in the steepest part of the curve where the Hill coefficient is highest. The R- and T-states by themselves (at either end of the curve) are not cooperative but cooperativity arises when both states are in the process of interconverting, i.e. at intermediate levels of oxygenation. Cooperativity, as expressed by the Hill coefficient, ranges from 1 (non-cooperative) to ∼3 for Hb and is maximal when the T/R ratio is unity (10Perutz M.R. Nature. 1970; 228: 726-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (2188) Google Scholar, 11Perutz M.F. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1989; 22: 139-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 12Wyman J. Q. Rev.

The allosteric regulatory molecules DPG, 1The abbreviations used are: DPG, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate; HbS, sickle cell hemoglobin; HbA, normal adult hemoglobin; HbF, normal fetal hemoglobin.1The abbreviations used are: DPG, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate; HbS, sickle cell hemoglobin; HbA, normal adult hemoglobin; HbF, normal fetal hemoglobin. chloride, and protons facilitate O2 release by binding preferentially to the T-state, e.g. DPG binds very efficiently to a single site on deoxy-Hb (15Arnone A. Nature. 1972; 237: 146-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar) whereas chloride binds to several sites, some of which are shared with DPG but others are not (16Nigen A.M. Manning J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8248-8250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Bonaventura J. Bonaventura C. Sullivan B. Ferruzzi G. McCurdy P.R. Fox J. Moo-Pen W.F. J. Biol.

Biol. 1994; 239: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Hence, these two allosteric regulators are mutually competitive. The displacement of the O2 binding curve to the right by allosteric regulators does not affect the degree of cooperativity when they are present in amounts equal to or greater than Hb so that all Hb tetramers would contain bound effector. However, Kister et al. (21Kister J. Poyart C. Edelstein S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12085-12091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that subequivalent ratios of DPG:Hb resulted in lowered Hb cooperativity, decreasing from an n value of 2.6 to about 2.0. They explained this result as being due to two different populations of T-state tetramers, some with bound DPG and others free. They analyzed their data in terms of an expanded Monod-Wyman-Changeux model and concluded that it had physiological relevance. In this report we present evidence for a similar lowered cooperativity for HbA and HbS in the presence of subequivalent amounts, relative to Hb, of either the purified 43-kDa chymotryptic cytoplasmic fragment of membrane Band 3 or a synthetic 11-residue peptide corresponding to its N terminus sequence. Because the decreased cooperativity occurs with a moderate decrease in oxygen affinity in contrast to a greater decrease in the presence of saturating DPG, we consider the possibility that the cooperativity differences for the hemoglobin in direct contact with Band 3 in the red cell membrane and the hemoglobin that is intracellular and saturated with DPG could have a role in O2 transport because of a gradient of Hb tetramers with varying degrees of O2 saturation. Thus, in this context, Band 3 cytoplasmic fragment might be considered an allosteric regulator of hemoglobin function. Hemoglobin Desalting—Oxy-Hb (∼5 ml of 0.8 mm in 0.1 m NaCl) was dialyzed extensively against 2 liters of degassed distilled water at 4 °C with 4 changes. The dialysate was then passed through a 1.5 × 16 cm column of mixed-bed ion exchange resin (AG501-X8(D), 20–50 mesh, Bio-Rad) that had been washed with degassed distilled water to remove the entrapped air (22Berger R.L. Carpenter L Everse J. Kaplan J.L. Anal. Lett. 1973; 6: 125-138Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This procedure was repeated until the conductivity value of the Hb did not change both before and after passing through the column, and usually three passages sufficed. Conductivity of the hemoglobin solution as well as the 43-kDa fragment and the synthetic peptide, both of which are described below, were measured with a CDM 2e conductivity meter (Radiometer Medical, Copenhagen). The amount of residual chloride in the samples was determined with a chloride electrode as described below. Hb concentration was determined by amino acid analysis on a Beckman 6300. Determination of Chloride—Chloride ion content of the desalted hemoglobin, the 43-kDa Band 3 fragment, and the human peptide solutions were measured using a MI-200 Micro-Chloride Electrode with MI-402 Micro-Reference Electrode (Microelectrodes, Bedford, NH) on a model 84 pH meter (Radiometer Medical). Standard sodium chloride solutions (10 μm–0.1 m) in 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, were used to construct a calibration curve by plotting the chloride concentrations versus the millivolt reading. The chloride concentrations of the samples were then read from this graph. 43-kDa Cytoplasmic Domain of Band 3—The 43-kDa chymotryptic fragment of the cytoplasmic portion of human erythrocyte membrane Band 3 was prepared at 4 °C (23Bennett V. Stenbuck P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6424-6432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that the final ion exchange chromatography was performed on an Amersham Biosciences Mono Q column using a 0–0.6 m NaCl gradient in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5. Because significant losses were encountered in the gel filtration step, it was omitted. Furthermore, we found this step to be unnecessary because both SDS-PAGE and amino acid analysis showed that the chymotryptic fragment was pure after the Mono Q step (Table I). Chloride was removed from this sample first by dialysis against several changes of bis-Tris acetate, pH 7.5 (2 liters each), followed by continuous buffer exchange and concentration using Centriprep-10 and Centricon-10 devices successively. Residual chloride usually amounted to about 1.5 mol/mol of Band 3 chymotryptic fragment, which is far less than the amount needed to reverse the lowered cooperativity effect described below. Finally, the sample was concentrated with a Microcon YM-10 (500 μl). A single band in the expected position was found by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. The pH of the samples was carefully adjusted to 7.5 using NaOH. The protein concentration of the Band 3 fragment was determined by amino acid analysis, which agreed with published values (24Appell K.C. Low P.S. J. Biol.

Measurement of HbS Polymerization—The Csat/dextran assay of Bookchin, which was performed under completely anaerobic conditions, was used (27Himanen J.-P. Mirza U. Chait B.T. Bookchin R.M.

Effects of Human Red Cell Membrane Band 3 Cytoplasmic Fragment and Its Synthetic N-terminal Peptide Analog on Hemoglobin Cooperativity—When the oxygen binding curve of either sickle hemoglobin or normal adult hemoglobin was measured in the presence of either the purified natural 43-kDa cytoplasmic N-terminal chymotryptic fragment of human red cell membrane Band 3 protein or an 11-residue synthetic peptide corresponding to its N-terminal sequence (each present in subequivalent ratios with respect to Hb and in chloride-free buffer), the shape of the curve had a pronounced hyperbolic profile indicative of a lowered cooperativity (see curve B of Fig. 1A where the ratio of the 11-residue peptide to HbS was 0.5). This result is highly reproducible (see below). Usually, cooperativity values are given for the middle section of the Hill plot, e.g. 30–70% O2 saturation where the slopes are the steepest (n max). P 50 is defined as the oxygen pressure on the x-axis corresponding to 50% saturation. P 50 and n max values are shown in the inset of Fig. 1A. A reduced Hill coefficient at subequivalent effector to Hb ratios was found with the 43-kDa chymotryptic cytoplasmic Band 3 fragment as well as with its 11-residue synthetic peptide N-terminal analog. The fractional O2 saturation at the same subequivalent ratio of peptide to Hb in the presence or absence of saturating DPG is shown in Fig. 1B. Curve B shows that oxygen saturation initially rises more steeply at low oxygen tension in the absence of DPG than it does in its presence (curve C). Arrows have been added before, at, and after the midpoints of O2 saturation in Fig. 1B to emphasize this difference. The presence of excess DPG, as shown in curve C of Fig. 1, A and B, restored cooperativity to normal as demonstrated by its sigmoidal character, and O2 affinity was further lowered. Note that at higher oxygen tensions, curve B and curve C of Fig. 1B tend to merge. This is because of mutual competition for the same binding site so that the total effector:Hb ratio is >1. It is shown more clearly in the separate titration experiments for each of these three effector molecules described below. With either the synthetic 11-amino acid N-terminal peptide (Fig. 2A) or the 43-kDa human cytoplasmic fragment of Band 3 (Fig. 3A) in varying ratios with respect to Hb cooperativity is first lowered, reaching a minimum value at an effector:Hb ratio of about 0.5. At higher ratios the profiles of the n value versus effector:Hb ratio are reversed and cooperativity returns to normal. The overall parabolic profiles shown in Figs. 2A and 3A describe this effect. At the subequivalent ratios, the shape of the individual oxygen binding curves are like those of curve B in Fig. 1A. The extent of the cooperativity decrease is very similar in magnitude for both the 43-kDa fragment and the 11-residue peptide. These results strongly suggest that the determinant responsible for the lowering of the n value by the 43-kDa chymotryptic fragment resides in the first 11 amino acids of its sequence. In these experiments, Hb, as well as the 43-kDa fragment, and the synthetic peptide are virtually devoid of chloride except for residual amounts presumably representing very tightly bound, non-exchangeable chloride anions. These amounted to 1.5 and 0.6 mol/mol for the Band 3 fragment and for the synthetic peptide to Hb, respectively. The effects of added chloride are described below. The results in Figs. 1, 2, and 3 have been reproduced by two of the co-authors at different times using different preparations of Hb, peptide, and 43-kDa fragment.Fig. 3Effect of the 43-kDa Band 3 fragment on hemoglobin functional properties. A, cooperativity changes. B, oxygen affinity (P 50) changes. The concentrations of Hb and of the 43-kDa fragment were determined by amino acid analysis. The Hb concentration was 0.5 mm and the 43-kDa fragment concentration was varied to achieve the ratios shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Effects on Oxygen Affinity—As mentioned above, lowering of oxygen affinity by Band 3 has already been reported (8Walder J.A.

Our results are included here because they show that this effect is not linear, i.e. the plots of oxygen affinity versus effector:Hb ratio indicate that the oxygen affinity continually decreases in the presence of either the 11-residue peptide (Fig. 2B) or the 43-kDa fragment (Fig. 3B), with the largest changes occurring at effector:Hb ratios between 0 and 0.5. At higher ratios, oxygen affinity decreases more gradually than in the initial phase. These decreases are similar to those found when Hb is titrated with DPG (see below). Effects of Other Additives—To evaluate the specificity of the lowered cooperativity in the presence of subequivalent effector:Hb ratios, we studied the effects of two related peptides. Peptide 1 (Table II) has 2 basic amino acid substitutions compared with the highly acidic 11-residue peptide described above; peptide 2 corresponds to the mouse Band 3 N-terminal sequence. Both of the peptides differ from the natural human N-terminal sequence in the number and location of acidic residues, i.e. the sequence of the natural human N-terminal 11-residue peptide has 7 acidic residues, whereas peptide 1 in Table II has one of the acidic residues replaced by a basic Arg residue and a neutral residue replaced by a His. Some smaller unrelated peptides and amino acids were also tested (Table III). None of these additives had any effect on the n value of human Hb, thus demonstrating the specificity of the effect of the natural 11-residue human synthetic peptide to human Hb.Table IIEffect of other Band 3 peptides on cooperativity and oxygen affinityPeptideRatio to HbnP501aAnalog of natural human peptide.

At a NaCl:peptide ratio of 100 corresponding to 25 mm added chloride, the n value increased to 2.7 with no additional changes at higher ratios. The finding that relatively high amounts of NaCl are required to restore cooperativity to normal values is an indication of its relatively low binding affinity with Hb compared with the synthetic peptide. As described above (16Nigen A.M. Manning J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8248-8250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Bonaventura J. Bonaventura C. Sullivan B. Ferruzzi G. McCurdy P.R.

Williamson D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), chloride is a relatively nonspecific regulator of Hb function because it binds to multiple sites. This result explains why a lowered cooperativity due to binding of the 11-residue N-terminal peptide was not reported (8Walder J.A. Chatterjee R. Steck T.L. Low P.S. Musso G.F. Kaiser E.T. Rogers P.H. Arnone A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10238-10246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), because buffers containing 0.1 m chloride were used. However, these investigators (8Walder J.A. Chatterjee R. Steck T.L. Low P.S. Musso G.F. Kaiser E.T. Rogers P.H. Arnone A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10238-10246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) did note a lowered cooperativity with Band 3 when phosphate buffers were used. Effect of DPG on Cooperativity—A decreased Hill coefficient at subequivalent ratios of DPG to Hb has been reported (21Kister J. Poyart C. Edelstein S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12085-12091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We compared the relative efficiencies of DPG, the 11-residue synthetic peptide, and the 43-kDa fragment in achieving this effect. With DPG, the Hill coefficient was first lowered and then increased, and the largest decrease occurred at a ratio of 0.43 followed by an increase to normal at a ratio of 1.25 (Fig. 5, A–C). The partially hyperbolic shapes of the O2 binding curves at the subequivalent DPG:Hb ratios resemble those found with the synthetic 11-residue peptide (Fig. 1A, curve B) and the 43-kDa fragment. Likewise, the parabolic profile of the plot of n versus varying DPG:Hb ratios with a minimum at a ratio of about 0.5 (Fig. 5C) resembles the shapes of the corresponding plots found with both the 43-kDa Band 3 N-terminal fragment (Fig. 3A) and the 11-residue synthetic peptide (Fig. 2A). P 50 values also increase in a similar manner. Thus, it appears likely that these three effectors act by a similar mechanism to influence Hb cooperativity. Effect of N-terminal Band 3 Peptide on HbS Polymerization—Danish et al. (28Danish E.H. Lundgren D.W. Harris J.W. Am. J. Hematol. 1994; 47: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) reported that a cross-linked peptide made up of two 8-residue segments corresponding to the N-terminal segment of Band 3 inhibited HbS polymerization. The rationale for using a cross-linked peptide was that one 8-residue segment would tether to the DPG binding site and the second 8-residue fragment would extend from the HbS tetramer and prevent contacts between HbS tetramers (polymerization) by steric interference. No direct evidence was provided to support this model. The uncross-linked peptide did not inhibit HbS polymerization, although a 15-residue uncrosslinked peptide did inhibit HbS polymerization slightly. For all of the experiments reported by Danish et al. (28Danish E.H. Lundgren D.W. Harris J.W. Am. J. Hematol. 1994; 47: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), peptide:HbS ratios did not exceed 4:1. Because the rationale for using a cross-linked peptide was not convincing to us, and the control uncross-linked 8-residue peptide had no effect on HbS polymerization, we decided to study the effect of our 11-residue peptide on HbS polymerization in the complete absence of O2 (27Himanen J.-P. Mirza U. Chait B.T. Bookchin R.M. Manning J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25152-25156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, low ratios had little effect perhaps because of incomplete binding of the peptide, but ratios of peptide:HbS higher than 2 showed a pronounced decrease of HbS polymerization; the largest effect occurred at a 5:1 ratio of peptide:HbS followed by a more modest decrease at higher ratios. We conclude that cross-linking of such peptides is not necessary to inhibit HbS polymerization. Cooperativity during oxygenation/deoxygenation of Hb occurs with changes in subunit contacts at the allosteric interface between the oxy (R-state) and deoxy (T-state) conformational states and at a set of salt bridges in the T-state that are absent in the R-state (10Perutz M.R. Nature. 1970; 228: 726-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (2188) Google Scholar). Although the locations of these sites are known (10Perutz M.R. Nature. 1970; 228: 726-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (2188) Google Scholar, 11Perutz M.F. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1989; 22: 139-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 14Baldwin J.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1975; 29: 225-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), their exact individual strengths relative to each other are not. Some recent findings that we have reported show that overall subunit contact strength at the allosteric interface is influenced even by small changes in its side chains, e.g. Asp-γ43 in HbF provides more subunit contact strength than does Glu-β43 in HbA (26Chen W. Dumoulin A. Li X. Padovan J.C. Chait B.T. Buonopane R. Platt O.S. Manning L.R. Manning J.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3774-3781Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In addition, contributions to the overall strength of the allosteric interface of Hb arises from other parts of the tetramer, as we have shown by fusing the A-helix of the γ-subunit to helices B–H of the β-subunit to produce recombinant Hb Felix, which accounts for a significant part of the 70-fold higher allosteric interface strength of HbF compared with HbA in the liganded state (25Dumoulin A. Padovan J.C. Manning L.R. Popowicz A. Winslow R.M. Chait B.T. Manning J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35032-35038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The established principles of Hb cooperativity as well as the less well understood and controversial aspects have recently been reviewed (29Eaton W.A. Henry E.R. Hofrichter J. Mozzarelli A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Maximum cooperativity occurs when the R/T equilibrium is as far toward the T-state as it is toward the R-state (10Perutz M.R. Nature. 1970; 228: 726-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (2188) Google Scholar, 11Perutz M.F. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1989; 22: 139-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 14Baldwin J.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1975; 29: 225-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Perutz (10Perutz M.R. Nature. 1970; 228: 726-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (2188) Google Scholar) described a stereochemical mechanism involving the allosteric interface contacts and salt bridges (some involving DPG) that were either rearranged or broken during deoxygenation or oxygenation, respectively. The effectors described here also involve salt bridge formation with Hb so that this additional set of salt bridges requires a higher O2 tension to break. At a subequivalent ratio of 0.5, only one-half of the tetramers would have this additional set of salt bridges in the T-state. Thus, there would be two populations of Hb tetramers in the T-state. In such cases, the overall course of the cooperativity changes may not be a smooth transition to achieve maximum cooperativity because of this additional variability in response to O2 for those tetramers either with or without effector bound, as described next. The results described above for subequivalent ratios of DPG: Hb, Band 3:Hb, and synthetic peptide:Hb are consistent with the expanded two-state allosteric model of Kister et al. (21Kister J. Poyart C. Edelstein S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12085-12091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the n value is at a minimum when the peptide:Hb ratio is about 0.5, β-subunit inequality in binding of the 43-kDa fragment, the 11-residue peptide, as well as DPG, could be responsible for the lower cooperativity observed. The Monod-Wyman-Changeux model for normal cooperativity indicates that all like subunits are affected equally during the switch between the two conformational states, i.e. there is a smooth transition between the R- and T-states leading to a sigmoidal curve with maximal cooperativity. If some β-subunits had bound fragments and others had not, this condition would not be met, resulting in a mixture of R-state and two types of T-states leading to a heterogeneous binding curve having a decreased sigmoidal, partially hyperbolic shape affecting O2 binding. Analysis of Fig. 1, A and B, below is consistent with this explanation. For Fig. 1B the T-state without bound peptide would be oxygenated first up to 50% saturation. Because no peptide is bound to this type of tetramer, the decrease in oxygen affinity (shift to the right) up to 0.5 fractional O2 saturation is less than that beyond 0.5 fractional O2 saturation (see distance between horizontal arrows). In the latter phase the second type of T-state tetramer with bound peptide would be oxygenated with a more pronounced decrease in oxygen affinity. When excess peptide is present, only one type of T-state tetramer is present because all sites are saturated, i.e. all β-sites are occupied by effector and no longer inequivalent, thus restoring full cooperativity. Because the chloride ion binds to several sites on Hb (see above) at Band 3:Hb ratios of 0.5 and with saturating chloride, all sites would be occupied by one type of effector or the other and cooperativity would be normal. These findings, as well as the effects on oxygen affinity, which are similar for each of the effector molecules described here, are consistent with the possibility that the cytoplasmic portion of Band 3 that penetrates the red cell membrane interacts with intracellular Hb to influence its functional properties (see below). Earlier reports on the Band 3-hemoglobin interaction (cited in the Introduction) are consistent with this possibility. Band 3 is the most abundant protein in the red cell membrane comprising about 25% of the total membrane protein (1Low P.S. Agre P. Parker J.C. Red Blood Cell Membranes. Marcel Dekker, New York1989: 237-260Google Scholar, 2Platt O.S. Embury S.H. Hebbel R.P. Mohandes N. Steinberg M.H. Sickle Cell Disease: Basic Principles and Clinical Practice. Raven Press, New York1994: 125-137Google Scholar, 30Fairbanks G. Steck T.L. Wallach D.F.H. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 2606-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (6156) Google Scholar). We used the pure cytoplasmic fragment of Band 3 as well as its corresponding N-terminal peptide prepared by synthesis to study effects on cooperativity. Thus, the report that intact red cell membranes can lower Hb cooperativity (9Tsuneshige A. Imai K. Tyuma I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 101: 695-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) can now be attributed mainly to the Band 3 that is present. Because the oxygen binding curve in the presence of subequivalent amounts of peptide to Hb (Fig. 1A, curve B) has a distinct hyperbolic character with an n value of 1.5, Hb binds more O2 at a low O2 tension (<25 mm Hg) than it would at the same O2 tension if the curve were sigmoidal, e.g. in the presence of DPG (Fig. 1A, curve C). For example, the sigmoidal character of curve C in Fig. 1A between 20 and 25 mm Hg (the physiological O2 tension in the venous circulation) corresponds to 42–58% O2 saturation compared with the 66–75% O2 saturation in curve B in the same O2 tension range. If those Hb tetramers that adhere to the inner surface of the red cell membrane contain Band 3 cytoplasmic fragment bound in some fractional amount, such tetramers would have a higher capacity for oxygen because of their reduced cooperativity than would intracellular tetramers completely bound with DPG. The mutual competition between these two effectors could thus lead to a gradient of varying amounts of oxygen saturation among Hb tetramers, i.e. those in direct contact with the membrane with higher O2 saturation compared with the less O2-saturated tetramers in the interior of the red cell. Because the effects on cooperativity by purified Band 3 cytoplasmic fragment and its N-terminal peptide closely reflect that reported for intact membranes (9Tsuneshige A. Imai K. Tyuma I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 101: 695-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), a physiological role is possible. The results on the effects of the 11-residue peptide on HbS polymerization under completely anaerobic conditions clarify a report on the effects of a similar peptide on polymerization (28Danish E.H. Lundgren D.W. Harris J.W. Am. J. Hematol. 1994; 47: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Our findings also suggest that HbS polymerization could be modulated by the red cell membrane under physiological conditions and may be heterogeneous within the cell. Hence, an increased degree of O2 saturation of HbS at the membrane surface would also contribute to decreased HbS polymerization because of a shift in the R/T equilibrium to the R-state, which does not polymerize. Whether events such as membrane contributions to O2 transport and its consequent effects on HbS polymerization actually occur remain for future study. We thank Stuart Edelstein for very helpful comments and Roger Avelino for preparing the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2167466932,"Abstract TEL is a frequent target of chromosomal translocations in human cancer and an alleged tumor suppressor gene. TEL encodes two isoforms: a major TEL-M1 isoform as well as TEL-M43, which lacks the first 42 amino acid residues of TEL-M1. Both isoforms are potent transcriptional repressors that can inhibit RAS-induced transformation. Here we show that the v-SRC proteintyrosine kinase relieves the repressive activity of TEL-M1, an activity that is associated with the v-SRC-induced delocalization of TEL-M1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. TEL-M1 delocalization requires the kinase activity of v-SRC and is not induced by oncogenic RAS or AKT. Cytoplasmic delocalization of TEL-M1 in response to v-SRC critically depends upon its unique amino-terminal domain (SRCD domain) because (i) v-SRC did not inhibit the repressive properties of TEL-M43, nor affected TEL-M43 nuclear localization; (ii) fusion of the first 52 amino acid residues of TEL-M1 to FLI-1, an ETS protein insensitive to v-SRC-induced delocalization, is sufficient to confer v-SRC-induced delocalization to this TEL/FLI-1 chimeric protein. The v-SRC-induced nucleo-cytoplasmic delocalization of TEL-M1 does not involve phosphorylation of the SRCD and does not require TEL self-association and repressive domains. Finally, enforced expression of the v-SRC-insensitive TEL-M43, but not of TEL-M1, inhibits v-SRC-induced transformation of NIH3T3 fibroblasts. These results identify a regulatory domain in TEL that specifically impinges on the subcellular localization of its major TEL-M1 isoform. They, furthermore, indicate that inhibition of TEL-M1 nuclear function is required for v-SRC to induce cellular transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2051225798,"We compared the (pre)steady-state and single turnover methylation kinetics of bacteriophage T4Dam (DNA-(adenine-N6)-methyltransferase)-mediated methyl group transfer from S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) to oligodeoxynucleotide duplexes containing a single recognition site (palindrome 5′-GATC/5′-GATC) or some modified variant. T4Dam-AdoMet functions as a monomer under steady-state conditions (enzyme/DNA « 1), whereas under single turnover conditions (enzyme/DNA > 1), a catalytically active complex containing two Dam-AdoMet molecules is formed initially, and two methyl groups are transferred per duplex (to produce a methylated duplex and S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (AdoHcy)). We propose that the single turnover reaction proceeds in two stages. First, two preformed T4Dam-AdoMet complexes bind opposite strands of the unmodified target site, and one enzyme molecule catalyzes the rapid transfer of the AdoMet-methyl group (k meth1 = 0.21 s–1); this is 2.5-fold slower than the rate observed with monomeric T4Dam-AdoMet bound under pre-steady-state conditions for burst determination. In the second stage, methyl transfer to adenine in GATC on the complementary strand occurs at a rate that is 1 order of magnitude slower (k meth2 = 0.023 s–1). We suggest that under single turnover conditions, methylation of the second strand is rate-limited by Dam-AdoHcy dissociation or its clearance from the methylated complementary strand. The hemimethylated duplex 5′-GATC/5′-GMTC also interacts with T4Dam-AdoMet complexes in two stages under single turnover reaction conditions. The first stage (k meth1) reflects methylation by dimeric T4Dam-AdoMet productively oriented to the strand with the adenine residue capable of methylation. The slower second stage (k meth2) reflects methylation by enzyme molecules non-productively oriented to the GMTC chain, which then have to re-orient to the opposite productive chain. Substitutions of bases and deletions in the recognition site affect the kinetic parameters in different fashions. When the GAT portion of GATC was disrupted, the proportion of the initial productive enzyme-substrate complexes was sharply reduced.

The elucidation of the mechanisms of action of these enzymes remains an important task in the field of biological DNA methylation. In addition, because of their relatively high specificity and simple structural organization, Type II MTases are attractive objects for detailed studies of specific protein-DNA interactions. The greatest advances in studying the mechanism of action were achieved with the (Cyt-C5)-MTases, for which not only the chemical mechanism of catalysis is known (2Wu J.C. Santi D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4778-4786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but also three-dimensional structures of enzyme-substrate complexes were solved (3Cheng X. Kumar S. Posfai J. Pflugrath J.W.

A most surprising and important finding was that the target deoxycytidine “flips out” of the double helix (5Klimasauskas S. Kumar S. Roberts R.J. Cheng X. Cell. 1994; 76: 357-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar), an event that is presumed to precede methyl transfer (7Schluckebier G. Labahn J. Granzin J. Saenger W. Biol.

The crystal structure of an AdoMet analog-DNA-TaqI MTase ternary complex (12Goedecke K. Pignot M. Goody R.S. Scheidig A.J. Weinhold E. Nat. Struct.

Flipping of the target deoxynucleoside has not been shown directly with other (Ade-N6)-MTases. However, alternative methodologies, in which the target base is replaced with the fluorescent analog 2-aminopurine (N), and modeling of spatial structures confirm such a DNA deformation upon interaction with (Ade-N6)-MTases (13Allan B.W.

Another important line of study is on kinetic mechanisms of DNA methylation, because the detailed understanding of recognition specificity and catalysis requires knowledge of the rate constants for individual reaction stages. DNA MTases utilize polymeric DNA as their natural substrates in vivo. However, analysis of in vitro methylation of polymeric DNA, even if it contains a single target sequence, is complicated by the need for linear diffusion of the DNA-bound enzyme to find its specific recognition site. The use of relatively short oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) duplexes (usually 12–30 bp) containing a single specific site allows for simplification of the experimental conditions and acquisition of more precise data for calculating reaction parameters. In addition, substitutions of chemical groups or other modifications can be introduced, and the effect of these defined alterations on the reaction course can be assessed (19Reich N.O. Danzitz M.J.

Because a natural DNA may contain some structural defects such as nicks, gaps, deletions, or chemical modification of nucleotide residues, it is interesting to know how these alterations affect the methylation process.

Chem. 2002; 277: 279-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We showed that the addition of T4Dam to the reaction mixture led to an initial reaction “burst,” which was then followed by a slower steady-state phase of methylation. This result indicated that the rate-limiting stage of the reaction is the release of product(s) from the complex with the enzyme. Certain defects in duplex structure reduced the k cat value but had only small effects on the Km or the ability of T4Dam to bind the duplex. Other alterations reduced T4Dam binding ability but retained good substrate characteristics, viz. relatively high k cat and low Km values. Thus, diverse effects on the interaction with T4Dam were exerted by different changes of the specific site. In these steady-state studies, methylation was carried out under conditions where substrate DNA was in excess (enzyme/DNA « 1) and T4Dam has a monomeric structure; in contrast, when enzyme/DNA > 1, a dimeric enzyme structure is favored (27Malygin E.G. Evdokimov A.A. Zinoviev V.V. Ovechkina L.G. Lindstrom Jr., W.M. Reich N.O. Schlagman S.L. Hattman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2361-2369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this regard, the x-ray crystal structure of a T4Dam-DNA-AdoHcy ternary complex (28Yang Z. Horton J.R. Zhou L. Zhang X.J. Dong A. Zhang X. Schlagman S.L. Kossykh V. Hattman S. Cheng X. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10 (in press)Google Scholar) showed that the enzyme:DNA (a 12-mer ODN duplex) ratio was 2:1. Hence, it is important to examine the catalytic characteristics of dimeric T4Dam and compare them with the properties of the monomeric form. Therefore, we have extended our studies on T4Dam to analyses of pre-steady-state kinetics under single turnover conditions. Enzymes and Chemicals—[3H]CH3-AdoMet was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Unlabeled AdoMet (Sigma) was purified further by chromatography on a C18 reversed-phase column, as described previously (29Kossykh V.G. Schlagman S.L. Hattman S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 75-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). ODNs were synthesized and purchased from Midland Certified Reagent Co. (Midland, TX). They were purified further as described (13Allan B.W. Beechem J.M. Lindstrom W.M. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2368-2373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar); concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically from the molar extinction coefficients of individual nucleotides and the known sequence of each ODN. T4Dam MTase was purified to homogeneity, as described previously (30Kossykh V.G. Schlagman S.L. Hattman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14389-14393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Defined synthetic duplexes were obtained by heating and annealing individual ODN chains (Table I) from 90 to 20 °C over a 7–12-h period. For example, annealing complementary ODN I (designated as the upper strand) and ODN II produced duplex 1 with a centrally located T4Dam recognition site GATC/GATC (Table II). The hemimethylated variant duplex 1m was produced by annealing ODN Im (contains an M residue in the recognition site) with ODN II. Other target site variants contained a modified base substitution in the “bottom” strand II; e.g. G was replaced by 7-deazaG (G → Z, ODN IIz), or Ade was replaced by 2-aminopurine (A → N, ODN IIn). Structurally defective duplexes lacking some element of the recognition site (either a nucleotide or phosphate) were prepared by annealing equimolar mixtures of upper strand ODN I with one or more of ODN III-IX (Table I).Table ISynthetic ODNsODNSequenceaUnderlined bases denote the recognition site GATC and its variants or portion thereof.

Evdokimov A.A. Gorbunov Yu.A. Malygin E.G. Kossykh V.G. Hattman S. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures contained 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The microvolume rapid quench instrument RQF-3 (KinTek Corp.) was used for pre-steady-state assays. Syringes, mixers, and age-loops were equilibrated to 25 °C. The feeding syringe containing the enzyme preparation was kept at 4 °C to avoid inactivation of the T4Dam MTase during the experiment. SDS (0.05%, w/v) in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3) was used as the quench solution. The quenched samples were collected in Eppendorf tubes and evaporated to a volume of 100 μl using an Eppendorf vacuum concentrator. Duplicate 50-μl aliquots were spotted onto DE81 anion-exchange filter paper (Whatman, 2.0 cm) for counting 3H counts/min. The molar concentration of [3H]CH3 groups incorporated into DNA was quantitated as described earlier (32Thielking V. Du Bois S. Eritja R. Guschlbauer W. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 407-415PubMed Google Scholar). Each experiment was performed at least twice, and the mean values were used for analysis. Kinetic parameters were obtained by using the computer program “Scientist” (MicroMath Inc.) for a regression analysis to fit the experimental data. Single Turnover Kinetics of Methylation of Duplexes Containing a Canonical T4Dam Recognition Site: a Two-stage Reaction—T4Dam methylation of defined synthetic duplexes (Table II) was assayed under single turnover conditions; i.e. AdoMet (8 μm) was saturating relative to T4Dam (2.7 μm), and both were saturating relative to the ODN duplex (0.2 μm). Under these conditions, two T4Dam (presumably bound with AdoMet) are bound per duplex (32Thielking V. Du Bois S. Eritja R. Guschlbauer W. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 407-415PubMed Google Scholar). In the classic case of single turnover, a substrate molecule has a single reactive group that is converted to product. The course of the reaction can be described by a simple exponential function [[ 3H]CH3])[duplex]=Pmax⋅(1-e-kmeth⋅t)(Eq. 1) where P max is the maximum level of substrate conversion, and k meth is the rate constant of the chemical stage of the reaction. However, the curves did not obey a simple exponential dependence (representative results are presented in Fig. 1, and statistical evidence is presented under “Appendix”). All data sets were best described by using Equation 2 below for two-step methylation of duplexes; however, it is not ruled out that some other more complex model might fit the data even better. Duplex 1 (Table II) contains GATC on both strands of the target site. During a single turnover reaction, T4Dam should catalyze a methyl transfer to every duplex, and it might even methylate both Ade residues. Because the overall DNA-MTase reaction is irreversible (2Wu J.C. Santi D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4778-4786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Evdokimov A.A. Zinoviev V.V. Malygin E.G. Schlagman S.L. Hattman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 279-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), it can be represented as a two-stage conversion of the initial oligonucleotide duplex containing two target Ade residues. where E is T4Dam bound with AdoMet and/or AdoHcy, D is the initial duplex, mD is the half-methylated duplex; mDm is the fully methylated reaction product, k meth1 is the rate constant of the first stage of the methylation reaction, and k meth2 is the rate constant of the second stage. Because the technique used only allows registration of the sum of the products of reaction p = mD + mDm, the kinetic scheme (Scheme 1) is described by Equation 2 (33Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. 2nd ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1985: 133Google Scholar): [[ 3H]CH3]/[duplex]=P2-(P1⋅kmeth1-P2⋅kmeth2)⋅e-kmeth1⋅/(kmeth1-kmeth2)-(P2-P1)⋅e-kmeth2⋅t⋅kmeth1/(kmeth1-kmeth1)(Eq. 2) where P 1 is the number of Ade residues methylated per duplex during the first stage of the reaction, and P 2 is the number of Ade residues methylated per duplex in the final product. For duplex 1, containing the canonical palindromic GATC/GATC site, the first stage of the single turnover reaction involves methylation of one of the two Ade residues (P 1 = 1.03 [3H] methyl groups transferred per duplex) with rate constant k meth1 = 0.21 s–1 (Fig. 1A and Table II). This value is 14-fold higher than the k cat under steady-state conditions (24Malygin E.G. Zinoviev V.V. Petrov N.A. Evdokimov A.A. Jen-Jacobson L. Kossykh V.G. Hattman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1135-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 25Zinoviev V.V. Evdokimov A.A. Gorbunov Yu.A. Malygin E.G. Kossykh V.G. Hattman S. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This finding confirms that, as in the case of the EcoRI MTase (34Reich N.O. Mashhoon N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9191-9193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the chemical step of the reaction (methyl group transfer) is not rate-limiting. In the first stage after binding, T4Dam methylates one strand only. The second methylation stage proceeded at a rate that was an order of magnitude slower than in the first stage, and the P 2 was 1.90 methyl groups per duplex. Thus, both Ade residues in the canonical GATC/GATC site were methylated under single turnover conditions, where two Dam-AdoMet complexes can be bound to the duplex (27Malygin E.G. Evdokimov A.A. Zinoviev V.V. Ovechkina L.G. Lindstrom Jr., W.M. Reich N.O. Schlagman S.L. Hattman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2361-2369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This result suggests that the two distinct k meth values reflect differing methylation conditions; e.g. the second methylation is rate-limited by the dissociation of T4Dam-AdoHcy or its clearance from the site on the opposite strand. Single Turnover Kinetics of Methylation with Duplexes Containing a Nucleotide Substitution in the T4Dam Recognition Site—Duplexes 1m, 3, 4, and 5 (GMTC/GATC, GMTC/ZATC, GATC/GNTC, and GATC/GTAC, respectively) contain only a single Ade residue as a potential methyl acceptor. Thus, for these duplexes, random T4Dam binding should result in one of two mutually exclusive orientations (productive and non-productive) to the substrate, resulting in modification of only 50% of the duplexes. In all cases we observed a rapid exponential phase of methyl transfer followed by a slower increase in product accumulation; the results for duplex 1m are shown in Fig. 1B. Nevertheless, the two-exponential equation (Equation 2) adequately described the methylation of these duplexes, indicating that their methylation also proceeds in two stages. Fig. 1B shows the fitting of the experimental points for duplex 1m, and it worked satisfactorily in all the other cases, allowing determination of all four reaction parameters, k meth1, k meth2, P 1, and P 2 (Table II). However, it must be pointed out that here k meth2 applies to a different process. For example, consider methylation of the hemimethylated duplex 1m, where the rate of methyl group transfer was almost 2-fold higher (k meth1 = 0.37 s–1) than for duplex 1 (Fig. 1B, Table II). The extent of methyl transfer during the first-stage P 1 was 0.45 [3H]methyl groups per duplex. This value is close to the theoretical value of 0.50, assuming that Dam-AdoMet molecules bound to the productive and nonproductive strands of the hemimethylated target have an equal probability of flipping a target A or N6 -methyladenine deoxynucleoside and that interacting with the methylated Ade precludes methylation during the first stage. During the second methylation stage (which was also faster than with duplex 1), the P 2 value attained the theoretical maximum of 1.01 [3H]methyl groups per duplex. Therefore, we propose that under single turnover reaction conditions, methylation of the hemimethylated duplex 1m (and other duplexes having one Ade residue capable of methylation) also occurs in two stages. Here, k meth1 reflects the rate of the methylation by dimeric T4Dam-AdoMet productively oriented to the strand with the Ade residue capable of methylation, whereas the slower k meth2 reflects methylation by enzyme molecules that were oriented first to the non-productive GMTC chain and have to reorient (27Malygin E.G. Evdokimov A.A. Zinoviev V.V. Ovechkina L.G. Lindstrom Jr., W.M. Reich N.O. Schlagman S.L. Hattman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2361-2369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to the opposite productive chain. The substitution of Z for G (in duplexes 2 and 3) represents only a minor structural change, which does not alter normal hydrogen bonding. Duplex 2 contains two Ade residues accessible for methylation, whereas duplex 3 has one. With both duplexes 2 and 3, there was a 1.5- to 2-fold lower k meth1 than for canonical duplex 1 (Table II). Earlier it was shown that the G → Z substitution disrupts an important contact between T4Dam and guanine atom N7 , which is exposed in the major groove (24Malygin E.G. Zinoviev V.V. Petrov N.A. Evdokimov A.A. Jen-Jacobson L. Kossykh V.G. Hattman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1135-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In particular, the Kd value (according to gel retardation data) increased from 18 nm for the canonical duplex to 950 nm for the Z-substituted duplex. Nevertheless, the theoretical extent of methylation (P 2) of each duplex (2 and 3) was attained (Table II). An → N substitution (duplex 4) shifts the location of the exocyclic amino group from C6 to C2 (as well as shifting hydrogen bonding with thymine to this position). Although duplex 4 exhibits a 4-fold decrease in the k cat value, the chemical stage rates k meth1 and k meth2 increased 2-fold (Table II). The extent of methylation at both stages (P 1 = 0.58, P 2 = 1.12) corresponded to the expected values. Introduction of a double-base mismatch opposite the central upper strand AT (duplex 5) decreased the k cat value 30-fold (Table II). However, k meth1 was not affected, and k meth2 showed only a 2-fold decrease. Because the target Ade residue in the upper strand cannot form a hydrogen bond, it might be expected that its flipping out of the helix would be facilitated. However, because k meth1 was not increased, we conclude that either the stacking effect continues to stabilize the structure, or that flipping of the target base is not rate-limiting. The latter would be in agreement with earlier findings (35Allan B.W. Reich N.O. Beechem J.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5308-5314Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The expected extents of methylation P 1 and P 2 were observed with duplex 5. Single Turnover Kinetics of Methylation with Duplexes Containing a Deletion in the T4Dam Recognition Site—Absence of a single internucleotide phosphate in the target site influences methylation in a position-dependent fashion. For example, deletion of a phosphate between T and C (duplex 6) had no effect on k cat, k meth1, and k meth2 (Fig. 1C, Table II), and the extent of methylation in the first stage was as expected, although slightly lower after the second stage. In contrast, absence of the phosphate between A and T (duplex 7) lowered k meth2 by 1.5-fold and k cat by 2.5-fold (Fig. 1E, Table II). Absence of a phosphate between G and A (duplex 8) had the largest effect on kinetic parameters (Table II). Thus, the k cat value was reduced almost 10-fold, whereas the k meth1 increased more than 2.5-fold, but P 1 decreased. The latter change indicates that the proportion of catalytically competent complexes was lower than expected. Finally, k meth2 was lowered 3-fold, but the P 2 = 1.2 suggests there was complete methylation of the native strand. Duplex 9, which lacks C and additional 3′-nucleotides in the bottom strand, had single turnover parameters quite close to those for duplex 6 (Fig. 1D, Table II), which lacks a phosphodiester bond between the T and C residues of the bottom strand. In contrast, duplex 10, which lacks G and additional 5′-nucleotides in the bottom strand, gave entirely different single turnover parameters (Table II). For example, the P 1 value was less than 0.1; nevertheless, the k meth1 of 1.17 s–1 is 6-fold higher than that for the native duplex. On the other hand, the second stage of methylation showed an 8-fold lower k meth2 compared with the native duplex. Still, the P 2 value of 1.10 suggests complete methylation of the native strand. The k meth2 and k cat values were identical and at least five times lower than the respective values for native duplex 1. Duplex 11, which lacks T in the bottom strand, had a 4-fold higher k meth1 value compared with native duplex 1 (Fig. 1F, Table II), yet it had a low P 1 value of 0.16. The sharp reduction in the proportion of stage 1 productive complexes for duplexes 7, 8, 10, and 11, each devoid of some structural element, might be attributed to some distortion in the normal bending of DNA in the recognition site, which was shown to accompany interaction with DNA-MTases (36Garcia R.A. Bustamante C.J. Reich N.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7618-7622Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Under Single Turnover Conditions T4Dam Acts as a Dimer and Methylates Both Strands of Canonical GATC/GATC Duplex 1—We showed earlier (by gel filtration and sucrose gradient ultra-centrifugation) that two T4Dam molecules are present in complexes formed with 20- and 32-mer ODN duplexes under conditions of single turnover (37Zinoviev V.V. Ovechkina L.G. Malygin E.G. Mol. Biol. (Mosc.). 1996; 30: 1203-1208PubMed Google Scholar). To study this further, we took advantage of the ability of glutaraldehyde to cross-link protein subunits, because of the formation of covalent bonds between closely located lysine residues (27Malygin E.G. Evdokimov A.A. Zinoviev V.V. Ovechkina L.G. Lindstrom Jr., W.M. Reich N.O. Schlagman S.L. Hattman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2361-2369Crossref"
