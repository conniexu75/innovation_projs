https://openalex.org/W2908355668,"Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus are the primary vectors that transmit several arboviral diseases, including dengue, chikungunya, and Zika. The world is presently experiencing a series of outbreaks of these diseases, so, we still require to better understand the current distributions and possible future shifts of their vectors for successful surveillance and control programs. Few studies assessed the influences of climate change on the spatial distributional patterns and abundance of these important vectors, particularly using the most recent climatic scenarios. Here, we updated the current potential distributions of both vectors and assessed their distributional changes under future climate conditions.We used ecological niche modeling approach to estimate the potential distributions of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus under present-day and future climate conditions. This approach fits ecological niche model from occurrence records of each species and environmental variables. For each species, future projections were based on climatic data from 9 general circulation models (GCMs) for each representative concentration pathway (RCP) in each time period, with a total of 72 combinations in four RCPs in 2050 and 2070. All ENMs were tested using the partial receiver operating characteristic (pROC) and a set of 2,048 and 2,003 additional independent records for Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, respectively. Finally, we used background similarity test to assess the similarity between the ENMs of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus.The predicted potential distribution of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus coincided with the current and historical known distributions of both species. Aedes aegypti showed a markedly broader distributional potential across tropical and subtropical regions than Ae. albopictus. Interestingly, Ae. albopictus was markedly broader in distributional potential across temperate Europe and the United States. All ecological niche models (ENMs) were statistically robust (P < 0.001). ENMs successfully anticipated 98% (1,999/2,048) and 99% (1,985/2,003) of additional independent records for both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, respectively (P < 0.001). ENMs based on future conditions showed similarity between the overall distributional patterns of future-day and present-day conditions; however, there was a northern range expansion in the continental USA to include parts of Southern Canada in case of Ae. albopictus in both 2050 and 2070. Future models also anticipated further expansion of Ae. albopictus to the East to include most of Europe in both time periods. Aedes aegypti was anticipated to expand to the South in East Australia in 2050 and 2070. The predictions showed differences in distributional potential of both species between diverse RCPs in 2050 and 2070. Finally, the background similarity test comparing the ENMs of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus was unable to reject the null hypothesis of niche similarity between both species (P > 0.05).These updated maps provided details to better guide surveillance and control programs of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus. They have also significant public health importance as a baseline for predicting the emergence of arboviral diseases transmitted by both vectors in new areas across the world."
https://openalex.org/W2907515574,"Recently, modulation of gut microbiota by probiotics treatment has been emerged as a promising strategy for treatment of metabolic disorders. Apart from lactic acid bacteria, Bacillus species (Bacillus spp.) have also been paid attention as potential probiotics, but nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms for their protective effect against metabolic dysfunction remain to be elucidated. In this study, we demonstrate that a probiotic mixture composed of 5 different Bacillus spp. protects mice from high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity, insulin resistance and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Probiotic Bacillus treatment substantially attenuated body weight gain and enhanced glucose tolerance by sensitizing insulin action in skeletal muscle and epididymal adipose tissue (EAT) of HFD-fed mice. Bacillus-treated HFD-fed mice also exhibited significantly suppressed chronic inflammation in the liver, EAT and skeletal muscle, which was observed to be associated with reduced HFD-induced intestinal permeability and enhanced adiponectin production. Additionally, Bacillus treatment significantly reversed HFD-induced hepatic steatosis. In Bacillus-treated mice, hepatic expression of lipid oxidative genes was significantly increased, and lipid accumulation in subcutaneous and mesenteric adipose tissues were significantly decreased, commensurate with down-regulated expression of genes involved in lipid uptake and lipogenesis. Although, in Bacillus-treated mice, significant alterations in gut microbiota composition was not observed, the enhanced expression of tight junction-associated proteins showed a possibility of improving gut barrier function by Bacillus treatment. Our findings provide possible explanations how Bacillus probiotics protect diet-induced obese mice against metabolic disorders, identifying the treatment of probiotic Bacillus as a potential therapeutic approach."
https://openalex.org/W2906912542,"Little is known about how Drosophila adults behave in the wild, including mating, allocation of food and space, and escape from predators. This lack of information has negative implications for our ability to understand the capabilities of the nervous system to integrate sensory cues necessary for the adaptation of organisms in natural conditions. We characterized a set of behavioral routines of D. melanogaster and D. simulans adults in three ecologically different orchards: grape, apple and prickly pear. We also investigated how the flies identify conspecifics and aliens in the wild to better understand relationships between group formation and adaptation of Drosophila to breeding sites. We characterized the locations by recording in each orchard humidity, temperature, illumination conditions, pH of fruits, the presence/absence of other Drosophila species and the predator ant Linepithema humile. Our findings suggest that the home range of these species of Drosophila includes decaying fruits and, principally, a variety of microhabitats that surround the fruits. The ecological heterogeneity of the orchards and odors emitted by adult D. melanogaster and D. simulans influence perch preferences, cluster formation, court and mating, egg-laying site selection, and use of space. This is one of the first large examinations of the association between changing, complex environments and a set of adult behaviors of Drosophila. Therefore, our results have implications for understanding the genetic differentiation and evolution of populations of species in the genus Drosophila."
https://openalex.org/W2906803333,"Unmet need for contraception and unwanted pregnancy are recognised as significant barriers to promoting women's reproductive health and well-being. Currently there is no research evidence on these two crucial indicators of reproductive care in Angola. Therefore, we conducted this study with the objectives of exploring the current prevalence of unmet need for contraception and unintended pregnancy as well as their relationship among married women in Angola.This study was based on cross-sectional data from Angola Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) conducted in 2015-16. Participants were 7,808 married women aged 15-49 years. Unwanted pregnancy was measured in terms of the mistimed and unintended conception for the last-born child. Unmet need for contraception included those who reported unmet need for spacing and limiting. Data were analysed using bivariate and multivariable techniques.The combined prevalence of mistimed and unwanted pregnancy was 38.3% (95%CI = 35.9-40.7), and that of unmet need for contraception for spacing and limiting was 51.7% (49.9-53.5). Among the 18 regions, Luanda had the highest prevalence of unmet need for contraception and of unwanted pregnancy with the prevalence being higher than more than one-third of the women. Multivariable analysis significantly revealed a significantly positive association between unmet need and unwanted pregnancy. In all the models, the odds of unwanted pregnancy were found to be as high as four times among women with unmet need compared with those had no unmet need. Compared to women who had no unmet need, those who had unmet need had respectively four (OR = 4.380; 95%CI = 3.690-5.198) and seven (OR = 6.951; 95%CI = 4.642-10.410) times higher odds of experiencing unwanted pregnancy.This study concludes that the prevalence of unmet need for contraception and unwanted pregnancy are high with significant disparities across the regions. Women in the capital city had the highest prevalence of both unmet need for contraception and unwanted pregnancy. Although the data were cross-sectional and do not indicate causal relationships, the findings showed a strong positive association between unmet need for contraception and unwanted pregnancy. However, it is recommended to conduct further studies to replicate the findings and to explore the influence behavioural and cultural practices on unwanted pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W2908175527,"Ghost crabs have been widely used as a bio-indicator species of human impacts on sandy beaches to obtain reliable biological data for management and conservation purposes. Ghost crab population densities and individual sizes decline dramatically under human pressure. However, distribution within a beach and the factors that determine this distribution of ghost crabs is still an open question. These factors may provide valuable information for understanding human impacts on sandy beaches. Here we examine ghost crab burrows on 20 sandy beaches of South Carolina, USA under various levels of human impacts to understand the response in terms of spatial distribution of this species to human impacts. We also examine the burrow characteristics and environmental properties of the burrows to determine whether these factors alter burrow characteristics. We show that crabs on heavily impacted beaches altered their spatial distribution to mostly occupy the edges of impacted beaches. Further, this change in spatial distribution was influenced by the size distribution of the population on a beach (i.e. larger individuals occupy upper parts on the beaches). We also found that ghost crabs altered the morphology of their burrows on heavily impacted beaches. Ghost crabs create deeper, steeper and smaller burrows under human impacts. These patterns were also influenced by physical characteristics of the beach. Our results suggest that human impacts can directly influence the spatial distribution of ghost crab populations within a beach and therefore sampling at upper parts of the beaches overestimates the population density and individual sizes. Our results support the use of ghost crabs as indicator species in effective beach management, but suggest that assessments would benefit from examining the morphology and distribution of burrows as opposed to simply using burrow counts to assess the health of sandy shores."
https://openalex.org/W2906898520,"We examined whether the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Medicaid expansion reduced socioeconomic inequalities in health care utilization.We used data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, covering the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia, between 2011 and 2016. We selected outcome indicators, viz. ability to afford needed health care, having a personal doctor, use of health services in the past year (routine check-up, flu shot and dental visits), and attending screenings for breast, cervical, and colon cancers. Socioeconomic status was measured by household income. We calculated two indices of inequality by household income for each outcome: Slope Index of Inequality (SII) and Relative Index of Inequality (RII). We estimated difference-in-differences models to examine the impact of ACA Medicaid expansion on socioeconomic inequality in use of health care services.The ACA Medicaid expansion appeared to reduce the socioeconomic gap in individuals reporting financial ability in accessing health care (difference-in-differences estimators, -0.045 for SII and RII), having a personal doctor (-0.037 for SII and RII), and receiving routine check-ups (-0.027 for SII and -0.039 for RII). However, the expansion was not associated with reduction in the socioeconomic gap for preventive health care visits or dental care.The ACA Medicaid expansion had mixed effects on socioeconomic disparities in health care utilization. Medicaid expansion may not be sufficient to address socioeconomic disparities in preventive services uptake."
https://openalex.org/W2906844024,"The study purpose was to investigate the acceptability and utility of, and preference for, wearable activity trackers (WATs) amongst cancer survivors living in regional and remote areas of Western Australia.Twenty participants were recruited (Mean age = 63 years, SD = 13) to test two to three trackers from five available models (Fitbit Alta, Garmin Vivofit 2, Garmin Vivosmart, Polar loop 2 and Polar A300). Participants wore each device for two weeks, followed by a one-week washout period between devices. Interviews were conducted with participants to explore user perceptions and experiences. Interview transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis.Four main themes emerged: (i) Consciousness raising; (ii) Prompts and Feedback; (iii) Accuracy and registry of activities; and, (iv) WAT preferences and features.WATs were acceptable and useful to cancer survivors. WATs increased self-awareness of physical activity, provided real time feedback in relation to step goals, and reinforced progress and efforts towards goals. The aesthetics of the WATs were deemed crucial in determining preference and likelihood of use.Future interventions may do well to have two different WATs available for participants to choose from, according to activity preferences, aesthetic preferences, and display size."
https://openalex.org/W2907159400,"Background Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the commonest endocrine disorder affecting young women, appears to be a multigenic trait with contributing genes being unclear. Hence, analysis of polymorphisms in multiple candidate genes is required. Currently available genotyping methods are expensive, time-consuming with limited analytical sensitivity. Aim (i) Develop and validate high resolution melting (HRM) assay and allele-specific real-time quantitative PCR (AS-qPCR) for genotyping selected SNPs associated with PCOS. (ii) Identify selected SNPs and their association with a Sri Lankan cohort of well-characterized PCOS. Methods DNA was extracted from women with well-characterized PCOS from adolescence (n = 55) and ethnically matched controls (n = 110). FTO (Fat mass and obesity associated gene; rs9939609), FSHB (Follicle stimulating hormone beta subunit; rs6169), FSHR (Follicle stimulating hormone receptor; rs6165/rs6166), and INSR (Insulin receptor; rs1799817) genes were genotyped using HRM assay. GnRH1 (Gonadotropin releasing hormone; rs6185), LHB (Luteinizing hormone beta subunit; rs1800447/rs34349826) and LHCGR (Luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptor; rs2293275) genes were genotyped using AS-qPCR method. Genotyping results were validated using Sanger sequencing. Results A significant association was observed within FTO gene polymorphism (rs9939609) and PCOS. Genotype frequency of FTO gene (rs9939609)—cases versus controls were TT-36.4% vs.65.4% (p<0.05), AT-23.6% vs.20.9%, AA-40% vs.13.6% (p<0.05). Genotype frequencies of the SNPs GnRH1 (rs6185), FSHB (rs6169), FSHR (rs6165 & rs6166), LHB (rs1800447 & rs34349826), LHCGR (rs2293275) and INSR (rs1799817) were not significantly different between cases and controls (p>0.05). Only the mutant alleles were observed for LHB rs1800447 and rs34349826 SNPs in both groups. The HRM and AS-qPCR assay results had 100% concordance with sequencing results. Conclusions FTO gene rs9939609 polymorphism is significantly more prevalent among Sri Lankan PCOS subjects while the other selected SNPs of HPG axis genes and INSR gene showed no association. HRM and AS-qPCR assays provide a reliable, fast and user-friendly genotyping method facilitating wider implication in clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W2906875615,"Background Myanmar faces a health security threat, with an increasing number of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) cases. Long delays in the initiation of treatment are a barrier to MDR-TB control. Objectives The main objectives of this study were (1) to identify the determinants of delay in treatment initiation after MDR-TB diagnosis, and (2) to explore the effects of treatment delay on disease infectivity, severity, treatment adherence, and treatment outcomes. Methods This retrospective study reviewed 330 MDR-TB treatment cards for patients enrolled for treatment at Yangon Regional Tuberculosis Centre, in 2014. Results Median treatment delay was 105 days, interquartile range (IQR) 106 (61–167) days; (51.5%) of patients experienced a long treatment delay (≥ 105 days). Regarding the determinants of treatment delay, this study identified important patient-healthcare system interaction factors. Significant risk factors of long treatment delay included female sex, age > 30 years, and prior contact with patients with MDR-TB. Patients with long treatment delays were significantly different from those with short delays, in terms of having high sputum smear grade, resistance to more than two main drugs (isoniazid and rifampicin), and long culture conversion time. In this study, delay in the initiation of treatment was associated with poor treatment outcome, but this was not statistically significant after adjusting for other risk factors. Median treatment-delay times were longer among patients with poor outcomes (144 days) than those with successful outcomes (102 days). Conclusions Post-diagnosis delays in the initiation of treatment among MDR-TB patients were significantly long. The study results showed that inadequate MDR-TB treatment initiation center, centralization of treatment initiation, limitation of human resources, were health-system factors delaying timely treatment initiation and implementation of an effective TB-control program. Our findings highlight the need for immediate interventions to reduce treatment delay and improve treatment outcomes, including scaling up diagnostic capacity with Xpert MTB/RIF at township level, expansion of decentralized MDR-TB treatment initiation centers, ensuring a productive health workforce comprising trained health personnel, and providing health education and treatment-adherence counseling to patients and family members."
https://openalex.org/W2906862492,"Tolerance to bitter foods and its potentiation by repetitive exposure are commonly experienced and potentially underlie the consumption of bitter foods, but it remains unknown whether permissive and adaptive responses are general phenomena for bitter-tasting substances or specific to certain substances, and they have not been rigorously studied in mice. Here, we investigated the effects of prolonged exposure to a bitter compound on both recognition and rejection behaviors to the same compound in mice. Paired measurements of rejection (RjT) and apparent recognition (aRcT) thresholds were conducted using brief-access two-bottle choice tests before and after taste aversion conditioning, respectively. First, RjT was much higher than aRcT for the bitter amino acids L-tryptophan and L-isoleucine, which mice taste daily in their food, indicating strong acceptance of those familiar stimuli within the concentration range between RjT and aRcT. Next, we tested five other structurally dissimilar bitter compounds, to which mice were naive at the beginning of experiments: denatonium benzoate, quinine-HCl, caffeine, salicin, and epigallocatechin gallate. RjT was moderately higher than aRcT for all the compounds tested, indicating the presence of innate acceptance to these various, unfamiliar bitter stimuli in mice. Lastly, a 3-week forced exposure increased RjT for all the bitter compounds except salicin, demonstrating that mice acquire tolerance to a broad array of bitter compounds after long-term exposure to them. Although the underlying mechanisms remain to be determined, our studies provide behavioral evidence of innate and acquired tolerance to various bitter stimuli in mice, suggesting its generality among bitterants."
https://openalex.org/W2908062290,"In Vietnam, reaching the remaining one-third of undiagnosed people living with HIV and facilitating their antiretroviral therapy (ART) enrollment requires breakthrough approaches. We piloted lay provider HIV testing as an innovative approach to reach at-risk populations that never or infrequently HIV test at facility-based services.We conducted a cross-sectional survey and analysis of routine program data in two urban provinces (Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City) and two rural mountainous provinces (Nghe An and Dien Bien) from October 2015 through September 2017. Acceptability of lay provider testing was defined as the proportion of first-time HIV testers utilizing the service, and effectiveness was measured by HIV positivity and ART initiation rates. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine lay provider testing preference and factors associated with that preference.Among 1,230 individuals recruited for face-to-face interviews, 74% belonged to key populations: people who inject drugs accounted for 31.4%; men who have sex with men, 60.4%; and female sex workers, 8.2%. Most clients (67%) reported being first-time HIV testers, and the majority (85.8%) preferred lay provider testing to facility-based testing. Multivariate analysis found that clients in urban areas (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.50; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.30-4.90) and those who had a university or higher education (aOR = 1.83; 95% CI: 1.05-3.20) were more likely to prefer lay provider testing. Lay provider testing yielded a higher HIV positivity rate (4.1%), particularly among first-time testers (6.8%), compared to facility-based testing (nationally estimated at 1.6% in 2016) and had a high ART initiation rate (91%).Our findings suggest that lay provider HIV testing is an effective approach to reach previously unreached at-risk populations, and, therefore, a critical addition to accelerating Vietnam's attainment of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS 90-90-90 goals."
https://openalex.org/W2908175873,"Purpose To investigate the influence of subretinal injection pressure on the microstructure of the retina in a monkey model. Methods After vitrectomy, balanced salt solution was injected subretinally into one eye each of four cynomolgus monkeys while controlling the injection pressure. Initially, a pressure of 2 psi was used, and this was gradually increased to determine the minimum required pressure. Subsequent injections were performed at two pressures: minimum (n = 13) and high (n = 6). To compare the influence of these injection pressures on retinal structure, optical coherence tomography (OCT) was performed before surgery and every week afterwards. The monkeys were euthanized and their eyes were enucleated at 1 or 6 weeks after the injections. The eyes were processed for light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) as well as for TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling. Results The minimum pressure required to perform subretinal injection was 6 psi. After injection at this pressure, both OCT and microscopy showed that the retinal structure was well-preserved throughout the experimental period at all injection sites. Conversely, after injection at high pressure (20 psi) OCT images at all injection sites showed disruption of the ellipsoid zone (EZ) after 1 week. Microscopy indicated damage to the photoreceptor outer segment (OS) and stratification of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). After 6 weeks, OCT demonstrated that the EZ had become continuous and TEM confirmed that the OS and RPE had recovered. Photoreceptor apoptosis was absent after subretinal injection at both pressures. Conclusions The retinal damage caused by subretinal injection increases depending on pressure, indicating that clinicians should perform subretinal injection at pressures as low as possible to ensure safety."
https://openalex.org/W2907636539,"Eight yeast strains of the genera Saccharomyces and Kluyveromyces were screened to ferment high lactose-load cheese whey permeate (CWP) (>130 g/L lactose) without nutrient supplementation. The fermentation conditions (temperature, pH and time) were optimized to maximize the fermentation performance (ethanol titer, ethanol yield and lactose consumption) for the two preselected strains, K. marxianus DSM 5422 and S. cerevisiae Ethanol Red, using a response surface methodology (RSM). Under optimized conditions, K. marxianus DSM 5422 attained ethanol titers of 6% (v/v) in only 44 h. Moreover, the feasibility of immobilizing this strain on four different inorganic supports (plastic, glass and Tygon silicone Raschig rings and alumina beads) was assessed. Glass Raschig rings and alumina beads showed a more stable performance over time, yielding ethanol titers of 60 g/L during 1,000 hours, which remarkably reduces yeast cultivation costs. Results demonstrate the feasibility of using CWP for successful ethanol production in a simple and economical process, which represents an attractive alternative for waste treatment in dairy industries."
https://openalex.org/W2907921995,"Introduction Vietnam is experiencing an epidemiologic transition with an increased prevalence of non-communicable diseases. The country needs novel, large-scale, and sustainable interventions to improve hypertension control. We report the 12 month follow-up results of a cluster randomized feasibility trial in Hung Yen province, Vietnam, which evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of two community-based interventions to improve hypertension control: a “storytelling” and a didactic intervention. Methods The storytelling intervention included stories in the patients’ own words about coping with hypertension and didactic content about the importance of healthy lifestyle behaviors in controlling elevated blood pressure levels. The didactic intervention included only didactic content, which were general recommendations for managing several important risk factors for hypertension and other non-communicable diseases. The storytelling intervention was delivered by two DVDs three months apart; the didactic intervention included only one DVD. The trial was conducted in patients with poorly controlled hypertension from 4 communes (communities), which were equally randomized to the two interventions. Results The mean age of the 160 patients was 66 years and 54% were men. Between baseline enrollment and the 12 month follow-up, mean systolic blood pressure declined by 10.8 mmHg (95% CI: 6.5–14.9) in the storytelling group and by 5.8 mmHg (95% CI: 1.6–10.0) in the didactic content group. The storytelling group also experienced more improvement in several health behaviors, including increased levels of physical activity and reduced consumption of salt and alcohol. Conclusions We observed considerable long-term beneficial effects of both interventions, especially of our storytelling intervention, among patients with inadequately controlled hypertension. A large scale randomized trial should more systematically compare the short and long-term effectiveness of the two interventions in controlling hypertension.

https://openalex.org/W2907012326,"Presentation of a prototype lipid antigen α-Galactosylceramide (αGC) was examined on primary epithelial cells derived from mouse lungs and on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells that essentially comprise alveolar macrophages. Presence of CD1d molecules coupled to αGC was demonstrated on both types of cells pre-treated with αGC, suggesting that both cell types are equipped to present lipid antigens. Internalization of Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG: a prototype pathogen), a pre-requisite to the processing and presentation of protein as well as lipid antigens, was clearly demonstrated in primary lung epithelial (PLE) cells as well as BAL cells. Both PLE and BAL cells expressed CD1d molecule and a significant up-regulation of its expression occurred upon infection of these cells with BCG. Besides CD1d, the expression of other important molecules that participate in lipid antigen presentation pathway (i.e. microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP), scavenger receptor B1 (SR-B1) and Saposin) was also significantly upregulated in PLE and BAL cells upon BCG infection. In situ up-regulation of CD1d expression on lung epithelial cells was also demonstrated in the lungs of mice exposed intra-tracheally to BCG. Taken together these results suggest that lung epithelial cells may have the ability to present lipid antigens and this pathway seems to get significantly upregulated in response to BCG infection."
https://openalex.org/W2907516726,"Osteosarcoma (OSA) represents the most common primary bone tumor in humans and pet dogs. Little progress has been made with regard to viable treatment options in the past three decades and patients presenting with metastatic disease continue to have a poor prognosis. Recent mouse studies have suggested that microRNA-34a (miR-34a) may have anti-tumor activities in human OSA models. Due to the conservation of microRNA across species, we hypothesized that a bioengineered miR-34a prodrug (tRNA/miR-34a) would have similar effects in canine OSA, providing a valuable preclinical model for development of this therapeutic modality. Using a panel of canine OSA cell lines, we found that tRNA/miR-34a reduced viability, clonogenic growth, and migration and invasion while increasing tumor cell apoptosis. Furthermore, canine OSA cells successfully process the tRNA/miR-34a into mature miR-34a which reduces expression of target proteins such as platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα), Notch1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Additionally, our subcutaneous OSA xenograft model demonstrated in vivo tumor growth delay, increased necrosis and apoptosis by tRNA/miR-34a, and decreased cellular proliferation ability. Taken together, these data support that this novel microRNA-based therapy may possess clinical utility in a spontaneously-occurring large animal model of OSA, which can then serve to inform the clinical development of this therapy for human OSA patients."
https://openalex.org/W2908225874,"Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), the culprit behind the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF), is a phosphorylation-activated, but ATP-gated anion channel. Studies of human CFTR over the past two decades have provided an in-depth understanding of how CFTR works as an ion channel despite its structural resemblance to ABC transporters. Recently-solved cryo-EM structures of unphosphorylated human and zebrafish CFTR (hCFTR and zCFTR), as well as phosphorylated ATP-bound zebrafish and human CFTR offer an unprecedented opportunity to understand CFTR's function at a molecular level. Interestingly, despite millions of years of phylogenetic distance between human and zebrafish, the structures of zCFTR and hCFTR exhibit remarkable similarities. In the current study, we characterized biophysical and pharmacological properties of zCFTR with the patch-clamp technique, and showed surprisingly very different functional properties between these two orthologs. First, while hCFTR has a single-channel conductance of 8.4 pS with a linear I-V curve, zCFTR shows an inwardly-rectified I-V relationship with a single-channel conductance of ~3.5 pS. Second, single-channel gating behaviors of phosphorylated zCFTR are very different from those of hCFTR, featuring a very low open probability Po (0.03 ± 0.02, vs. ~0.50 for hCFTR) with exceedingly long closed events and brief openings. In addition, unlike hCFTR where each open burst is clearly defined with rare short-lived flickery closures, the open bursts of zCFTR are not easily resolved. Third, although abolishing ATP hydrolysis by replacing the catalytic glutamate with glutamine (i.e., E1372Q) drastically prolongs the open bursts defined by the macroscopic relaxation analysis in zCFTR, the Po within a ""locked-open"" burst of E1372Q-zCFTR is only ~ 0.35 (vs. Po > 0.94 in E1371Q-hCFTR). Collectively, our data not only provide a reasonable explanation for the unexpected closed-state structure of phosphorylated E1372Q-zCFTR with a canonical ATP-bound dimer of the nucleotide binding domains (NBDs), but also implicate significant structural and functional differences between these two evolutionarily distant orthologs."
https://openalex.org/W2906729884,"The human-animal relationship can have a major impact on cow welfare and stockpersons´ work safety and quality. This cross-sectional study investigated possible effects of stockperson and farm related factors on cows´ behaviour towards humans in different test situations on a range of farm types including farms with automatic milking system. On 32 dairy farms, cows´ avoidance distances (AD), tolerance to tactile interactions (TTI), behavioural reactions during and after release from restraint (RB) and expressive behaviour by means of qualitative behaviour assessment (QBA) were recorded. Multiple regressions were calculated to analyse associations between the cows´ responses towards humans and factors of stockpersons´ attitudes, factors of human-animal contact and further herd and management characteristics. Positive attitudes towards cows were significantly associated with calmer cows in all test situations. Furthermore, different herd and management factors were related to individual variables of cows´ behaviour towards humans: for instance, the percentage of dehorned cows in the herd was associated with more fearful cows; the frequency of human-animal contact, manual feed provision, or selection for docility were associated with calmer cows. Explained variances were highest for the outcome variables AD and QBA. Directly or indirectly all factors remaining in the final models may be related to the amount and quality of human-animal contacts. Thus, the results suggest that on a broad range of different farm types a positive attitude and frequent human-animal contact can contribute to calmer cows in different interactions with humans in the barn."
https://openalex.org/W2906870439,"The prevalence of drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) has brought severe challenges to the prevention and control of tuberculosis. Studies have explored the status of antituberculosis drug (ATD) resistance in different regions of China. However, few studies have focused on DR-TB in Sichuan to date. Due to the large population in Sichuan, detailed investigations of the DR-TB burden in Sichuan are needed. The objective of this study was to investigate the drug resistance characteristics of TB isolates from tuberculosis patients with and without HIV (TB-HIV patients and TBw/oHIV patients) in Chengdu, Sichuan, China.Isolates from respiratory samples of TBw/oHIV patients and TB-HIV patients hospitalized between January 2014 and December 2017 were collected. Nontuberculosis mycobacteria (NTM) were excluded. Drug sensitivity testing (DST) was performed according to the dilution method in microplates with 4 first-line ATDs and 8 second-line ATDs. TB strains were separated according to patient treatment history, patient age, calendar year and GeneXpert MTB/RIF (GeneXpert) assay results for further analysis.For the 7470 patients recruited, the multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) rate was 2.1-fold (14.6% vs. 6.8%) higher than the national baseline level. The repeatedly admitted patients were more likely to have a resistance profile than the first-time-admitted cases in both the TB-only group (P<0.05) and the TB-HIV corresponding group (P<0.05). Among the 7273 TBw/oHIV cases and 197 TB-HIV cases, the positivity rates of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) in the TB-HIV group were significantly lower than those in the TBw/oHIV group (P<0.05). The repeatedly admitted TB-HIV patients had lower resistance rates to INH than the repeatedly admitted TBw/oHIV patients (24.4% vs. 41.5%, P<0.05). The Rifampicin-resistant TB strains in the TBw/oHIV group were more likely to be resistant to INH in the repeatedly admitted group than those in the first-time admitted patients (P<0.05). The proportions of XDR (3.6% vs. 1.3%, P<0.05) and XDR-TB/MDR-TB (7.3% vs. 2.2%, P<0.05) in all TB-HIV patients were significantly higher than those in all TBw/oHIV patients. The ratio of XDR-TB was significantly higher in the TB-HIV group than in the TBw/oHIV group (30.4% vs. 9.0%, P<0.05) and the all TB group (9.0% vs. 10.1%, P<0.05). Regarding age, the <25-year-old TB-HIV patients (9.1% vs. 0.7%, P<0.05) and 25~44-year-old TB-HIV patients (5.2% vs. 2.4%, P<0.05) were more likely to have a higher XDR proportion than their TBw/oHIV counterparts. The ATD-resistance profile in terms of different years from high to low was 2014>2015>2016≈2017 for TBw/oHIV patients. The same trend was also observed for TB-HIV patients: 2014>2015>2016≈2017. The GeneXpert TB-positive rate in the TBw/oHIV group was higher than that in the TB-HIV group [81%(639/792) vs. 65% (13/20), P<0.05]. In TBw/oHIV cases, the agreement was 92.3% and the Kappa value was 0.75. In TB-HIV cases, the agreement was 85.0% and the Kappa value was 0.32.In Sichuan, ATD resistance has improved since 2014, but to date, it remains severe. The different resistance profiles of TBw/oHIV patients and TB-HIV patients indicates the need for personalized treatment plans. Specifically, the GeneXpert assay might be more suitable for TBw/oHIV patients than for TB-HIV patients."
https://openalex.org/W2908497853,"Background Lifestyle choices are important determinants of individual health. Few studies have investigated changes in health behaviors and preventive activities brought about by the 2007 implementation of Urban Resident Basic Health Insurance (URBMI) in China. This study, therefore, aimed to explore whether URBMI has reduced individuals’ incentives to adopt healthy behaviors and utilize preventive care services. Methods Data were drawn from two waves of the China Health and Nutrition Survey. Respondents were categorized according to their insurance situation before and after the URBMI reform in 2006 and 2011. Propensity score matching and difference-in-differences methods were used to measure levels of preventive care and behavior changes over time. Estimations were also made based on gender, self-reported health, and income. Results We found that URBMI implementation did not change residents’ utilization of preventive care services or their smoking habits, drinking habits, or other risky behaviors overall. However, the likelihood of sedentariness did increase by five percentage points. Females tended to be more sedentary while males were less likely to drink soft drinks. Residents with poor self-reported health exercised less while those who reported good health were more likely to be sedentary. Low- and middle-income residents were likely to be sedentary while middle-income people tended to smoke after becoming insured. Conclusion Since URBMI implementation, some unhealthy behaviors like sedentariness have increased among those who were newly insured, and different subgroups have reacted differently. This suggests that the insurance design needs to be optimized and effective measures need to be adopted to help improve people’s lifestyle choices."
https://openalex.org/W2906907753,"Differential functional specialization of the left and right hemispheres for linguistic and emotional functions, respectively, suggest that interhemispheric communication via the corpus callosum is critical for emotional awareness. Accordingly, it has been hypothesized that the age-related decline in callosal connectivity mediates the frequently demonstrated reduction in emotional awareness in older age. The present study tests this hypothesis in a sample of 307 healthy individuals between 20–89 years using combined structural and diffusion-tensor magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the corpus callosum. As assumed, inter-hemispheric connectivity (midsagittal callosal area and thickness, as well as fractional anisotropy, FA) and emotional awareness (i.e., increase in externally-oriented thinking, EOT; assessed with the Toronto Alexithymia Scale, TAS-20) were found to be reduced in older (> 60 years) compared to younger participants. Furthermore, relating callosal measures to emotional awareness, FA in the genu of the corpus callosum was found to be negatively correlated with EOT in male participants. Thus, “stronger” structural connectivity (higher FA) was related with higher emotional awareness (lower EOT). However, a formal mediation analysis did not support the notion that age-related decline in emotional awareness is mediated by the corpus callosum. Thus, the observed reduction of emotional awareness and callosal connectivity in older age likely reflects parallel but not inter-dependent processes."
https://openalex.org/W2906952804,"We previously reported that despite HIV-infected pregnant women had modest humoral immune responses to inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) measured by hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) assay, the observed vaccine efficacy against influenza disease was higher than predicted by HAI; suggesting that IIV may confer protection to HIV-infected individuals by additional mechanisms. We evaluated the response to IIV by microneutralization (MN) and HAI assays and correlated both methods in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected pregnant women.MN and HAI antibodies were measured pre-vaccination and approximately one-month post-vaccination in 80 HIV-infected and 75 HIV-uninfected women who received IIV. Geometric mean titers (GMTs), fold-change in titers and seroconversion rates were determined for the three influenza stains in the vaccine.After vaccination there were significant increases in MN and HAI GMTs for the three vaccine strains in both HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected women. HIV-infected women had, however, a lower immune response compared to HIV-uninfected. Fold-increases were 2 to 3-times higher for MN assay compared to HAI assay for the influenza-A strains. Also a higher percentage of women seroconverted by MN than by HAI assay for the influenza-A strains. There was high positive correlation between MN and HAI assays, except for the B/Victoria strain at pre-vaccination.In general, the MN assay was more sensitive than the HAI assay. Microneutralization antibodies might correlate better with protection against influenza infection."

Reconstructions of lifetime annual migration histories among otolith annuli was matched to information on reproductive status (current-year ‘spawner’ or ‘non-spawner’) that was known in two different, sometimes successive, years for each fish. Two migratory life histories were observed: fish either migrated annually after smoltification or periodically skipped an annual ocean migration to remain in freshwater and spawn. Different spawning frequencies were detected where fish not migrating annually tended to spawn in alternate years (84.6%) more often than those migrating annually (50%). Additionally, annually migrating fish had lower longevity (≤9 years vs. ≤13 years). The evaluation of differences in spawning frequency between sexes, independent of migration tactic, revealed males (84.6%) skipped spawning more often than females (51.2%) suggesting fitness trade-offs between life histories differ between sexes. Further, some fish returned from the sea considerably earlier than the majority of other current-year migrants. Our findings demonstrate intrapopulation diversity in migration behaviour and reproductive frequency."
https://openalex.org/W2907467353,"Foxtail millet (Setaria italica (L.) P. Beauv.), the second most cultivated millet species, is well adapted to diverse environments and remains an important cereal food and forage crop in arid and semiarid regions worldwide. A symbolic crop for indigenous Austronesian peoples, foxtail millet has been cultivated in Taiwan for more than 5,000 years, and landraces reflect diversifying selection for various food applications. A total of 124 accessions collected within Taiwan were assessed for Wx genotypes. Four identified Wx alleles, I, III, IV, and IX were caused by insertion of various transposable elements (TEs) and resulted in endosperm with non-waxy, low amylose content (AC), and waxy, respectively. A total of 16.9%, 4.0%, 49.2%, and 29.8% of accessions were classified as type I, III, IV, and IX, respectively; approximately half of the accessions belonged to the waxy type, indicating that glutinous grains were favored for making traditional food and wine. The TE insertion affected splicing efficiency rather than accuracy, leading to significantly reduced expression of wx in types III, IV, and IX, although their transcripts were the same as wild-type, type I. Consequently, the granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSSI) contents of the three mutated genotypes were relatively low, leading to waxy or low AC endosperm, and the Wx genotypes could explain 78% of variance in AC. The geographic distribution of Wx genotypes are associated with culinary preferences and migration routes of Taiwanese indigenous peoples—in particular, the genotype of landraces collected from Orchid Island was distinct from those from Taiwan Island. This information on the major gene regulating starch biosynthesis in foxtail millet endosperm can be applied to breeding programs for grain quality, and contributes to knowledge of Austronesian cultures."

In this study, 40 male Wistar rats were randomly divided into three experimental groups and one control group, in which all rat's hair were shaved completely at the beginning. The rats in three experimental groups were treated with 2,5-HD by gavage at dosages of 100, 200 and 300 mg/kg per day respectively, six times per week for 8 weeks. Abnormality of gait and changes in the rota-rod latency were surveilled. Pyrrole adducts in hair, urine and serum of all rats were measured at the endpoint. Results showed that the increased pyrrole adducts in hair, urine and serum accumulated in dose-response relationship. Spearman's correlation analysis between pyrrole adducts and gait scores showed that hair pyrrole adducts were highly relevant to the gait scores. Moreover, we treated rats with n-hexane and succeed to verify the results aforesaid. Further, multiply linear regression analysis showed that hair pyrrole adducts have higher partial correlation coefficients than these in serum and urine in both 2,5-HD and n-hexane treated models. Our findings draw the conclusion that the hair pyrrole adducts might serve as a promising biomarker of n-hexane induced peripheral neuropathy."
https://openalex.org/W2907793337,"To overcome the limited readability of the conventional drug induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) system which only records flexible endoscopy images, we devised the Multimodality DISE System (MDS). MDS encompasses the monitoring systems for oxygen saturation, electrocardiogram, blood pressure, snoring intensity, and patient's position. It enabled to record comprehensive situation of patients who underwent DISE. In this study, we compared the efficacy of MDS with that of the conventional DISE system.Ten patients underwent DISE at a tertiary hospital. DISE evaluated the airway of each patient in four positions; supine, supine with jaw thrust, right lateral decubitus, and left lateral decubitus. In addition, every examination was recorded by using both single monitoring system and MDS system. Five otolaryngologists interpreted the recorded examinations without knowledge of patient information (10 conventional DISE and 10 MDS). The visual analogue scale (VAS) scores for readability, reading times, ease of patient explanation and the ease of decision making were analyzed.Mean VAS scores for readability of conventional DISE and MDS were 4.41+2.56 and 8.42+2.07 (p<0.001). Mean reading times for conventional DISE and MDS were 238.80+61.26 sec and 81.00+44.99 sec, respectively (p<0.001). MDS showed superiority in patient communication (p<0.001). MDS was helpful in decision making regarding patients with obstructive sleep apnea (p<0.001).MDS enhanced the readability of previously recorded DISE and enabled easier doctor-patient communication. In addition, MDS is more effective in decision making regarding patients with OSA. MDS has laid the groundwork for separating the DISE prescriber from the DISE performer."

In Ethiopia, despite the presence of a national master plan for prevention, control and elimination of some common zoonotic diseases, well-organized epidemiological data regarding incidence and distribution are lacking. A retrospective cross-sectional study based on a patient medical data recorded from 2012–2016 in selected districts of Southern Tigray, North Wollo zone of Amhara region and Ab’Ala district of Afar region was conducted to map the distribution and Incidence proportion of major zoonotic diseases. The incidence proportion of four major zoonotic diseases (helminthiasis, tuberculosis (TB), rabies and schistosomiasis) was mapped using qGIS software based on the Health Management Information System (HMIS) data collected from district health facilities. The result indicated that, out of a total 1,273,145 observed human disease cases, 53,614 (4.2%) of them were potential zoonotic diseases that include: helminthiasis (51,192), TB (2,085), rabies (227), schistosomiasis (105) and visceral leishmaniasis (7). The highest incidence proportion of TB (262.8 cases per 100,000 population) and rabies (33.2 cases per 100,000 population) were recorded in Gubalafto and Weldya followed by Raya Alamata (253.4 cases per 100,000 population %), and Ab’Ala and Raya Azebo (29 cases each per 100,000 population) for TB and rabies, respectively. The highest incidence proportion for schistosomiasis was reported in Raya Alamata (50.1 cases per 100,000 population) followed by Gubalafto and Weldya (10.8 cases per 100,000 population). The incidence proportion of visceral leishmaniasis per 100,000 population was 4.1, 1.3 and 1.2 cases for Ab’Ala, Gubalafto and Weldiya, and Raya Azebo districts, respectively. Except rabies, which showed high incidence proportion (p<0.0001) in 5–14 age groups, the other zoonotic diseases showed higher incidence proportion (p<0.0001) in age groups above 15 years. Rabies, helminthiasis and schistosomiasis showed statistically significant variation (p<0.0001) among seasons. Rabies and TB showed decreasing trend within the data recorded years. In animals, only 31 rabies cases and 15 anthrax cases were recorded from 2012 to 2016. This finding highlighted the distribution and incidence of some major zoonotic diseases in the study areas. Systematic and detailed research should be conducted in the future to map the distribution of major zoonotic diseases at regional and country level so as to initiate integrated effort from human and animal health authorities and professionals."

In the Southern and Southeastern regions of Brazil, a specific TP53 germline mutation, c.1010G>A (p.Arg337His), was identified at a population frequency of 0.3%, the highest value ever described for a TP53 germline variation. In Brazilian BC patients, carrier frequency can vary from 0.5% to 8.7%. The current study assessed carrier frequency by genotyping TP53 c.1010G>A in 2 BC groups: 1) 315 patients unselected for age of diagnosis and family history (FH) and 2) 239 patients diagnosed before 46 years and without Chompret criteria for LFS or LFL. One carrier was identified in group 1 (0.3%; CI 95% 0.1-1.76%) and six carriers in group 2 (2.5%; CI 95% 0.93-5.39%). The frequencies differed significantly between groups (p = 0.04). The mutation carrier frequency observed in group 2 could justify mutation testing in BC patients diagnosed before 46 years and without Chompret criteria for LFS or LFL. Further studies in larger samples of BC patients of different ages and regions of the country are necessary to provide more definitive TP53 p.Arg337His carrier frequencies in different scenarios."

Iterative reconstruction (IR) could enhance image quality without increasing radiation dose in patients with arms-down position.To investigate the feasibility of reduced-dose CT with IR for patients with inappropriate arm positioning.Twenty patients who underwent two-phase abdominopelvic CT including standard-dose and reduced-dose CT (performed with 80% of the radiation dose of the standard protocol) with their arms positioned in the abdominal area were included in this study. Reduced-dose CT images were reconstructed using filtered back projection (FBP), hybrid IR, and iterative model reconstruction (IMR). These images were compared with standard-dose CT images reconstructed with FBP. Objective image noise in the liver and subcutaneous fat was measured by standard deviation for the quantitative analysis. Then, two radiologists qualitatively assessed beam hardening artifacts, artificial texture, noise, sharpness, and overall image quality in consensus.Reduced-dose CT with all IR levels had lower objective image noise compared to standard-dose CT with FBP reconstruction (P < 0.05). Quantitatively measured beam hardening artifacts were similar in reduced-dose CT with iDose levels 5-6 and fewer with IMR compared to standard-dose CT. In the qualitative analysis, beam hardening artifacts and noise decreased as the IR levels increased. However, artificial texture was significantly aggravated with iDose 5-6 and IMR, and overall image quality significantly worsened with IMR.IR algorithms can reduce beam hardening artifacts in a reduced-dose CT setting in patients with arms-down position, and an intermediate level of hybrid IR allows radiologists to obtain the best image quality. Because the retrospective and single-center nature of our study limited the number of patients, multicenter prospective clinical studies are required to validate our results."

However, there are still some problems in the previous time series models. To overcome the problems, this paper proposes a hybrid time-series model based on a feature selection method for forecasting the leading industry stock prices. In the proposed model, stepwise regression is first adopted, and multivariate adaptive regression splines and kernel ridge regression are then used to select the key features. Second, this study constructs the forecasting model by a genetic algorithm to optimize the parameters of support vector regression. To evaluate the forecasting performance of the proposed models, this study collects five leading enterprise datasets in different industries from 2003 to 2012. The collected stock prices are employed to verify the proposed model under accuracy. The results show that proposed model is better accuracy than the other listed models, and provide persuasive investment guidance to investors."
https://openalex.org/W2907747578,"Objective There is no consensus on the embryonic components or morphogenetic processes involved in mature ventricular outflow tract development. Our goal was to use in vivo labelling to investigate the prospective fate of the myocardium of each conal wall. The conal and atrioventricular cushion mesenchyme changes during transformation into mature structures and their role in apoptosis were also investigated. Methods Plastic labels were placed at the cephalic and caudal conal limits of chicken embryo hearts (stage 22HH) and traced up to stage 36HH. Histological analyses, scanning electron microscopy and apoptotic detection using Lysotracker-Red were performed. The conal longitudinal length and medial displacement were registered. Muscle myosin was identified by immunofluorescence. Results Labels positioned in the myocardium of each conal wall moved to the right ventricle (RV), shifting from the arterial subvalvular myocardial zone to the apex. No labels were found in the aortic vestibule. At stage 22HH, the conus was a tubular structure composed of myocardium and endocardium with scarce mesenchyme. The dorso-left conal myocardial wall gradually lost continuity and the free ends separated, while the myocardium was distributed to the RV free wall (24HH-28HH). At stage 22HH, conal crests were not observed, but they were apparent at the dorsal zone of the conus at stage 26HH; towards stage 30HH, they fused to form the supraventricular crest, and the pulmonary infundibulum was evident. The ventro-superior cushion of the AV canal was reorganized into the fibrous and muscular structures lined the aortic vestibule. Conclusions The posterior conus is an erroneous concept. The conal myocardium is reorganized in the free wall of the RV. Internally, the conal lumen is transformed into the pulmonary infundibulum. The aortic vestibule is formed from the ventro-superior cushion of the AV canal. Thus, the ventricular outflow tracts have different embryonic origins."
https://openalex.org/W2907978913,"Human Multipotent Stromal Cells (MSCs) are a valuable resource for regenerative medicine and are widely studied. They can be isolated from a variety of tissues and differentiate into multiple cell types (multi-potent). Many reports have been published using human MSCs and to be able to compare outcome, or be able to identify differences between MSCs, several cell surface markers have been proposed. Nevertheless, still many differences remain. Gene expression is known to be different between cell stage and origin. Furthermore, cells cultured on a culture dish (2D) show different gene expression profiles as compared to cells grown on scaffolds (3D). Even the RNA extraction method and the selection of genes used for normalisation have a role in gene expression profiling. To be able to compare gene expression data from samples cultured in different dimensions and RNA extracted using a variety of protocols we set out to define a set of reference genes suitable to normalise qPCR data from a very heterogeneous sample set. Hereto, Trizol was used to extract RNA from human MSCs cultured in 3D and 2D to validate newly designed and previously published primer sets. Subsequently, RNA from fresh human MSC samples and samples stored in RLT-buffer, Trizol or RNAlater was extracted using RNeasy and Trizol methods. All samples have been used to rank the candidate reference genes according to their stability after qPCR enabling identification of the most suitable reference gene(s) for normalisation of a heterogeneous sample set. The most stably expressed reference genes indicated superior normalisation of MSC marker gene expression over the least stable reference genes."
https://openalex.org/W2907018338,"Background While life-long impacts exist for infants born one or two weeks early little evidence exists for those infants born after their due date. However interventions could be used to expedite birth if the risks of continuing the pregnancy are higher than intervening. It is known that the risk of epilepsy in childhood is higher in infants exposed to perinatal compromise and therefore may be useful as a proxy for intrapartum compromise. The aim of this work is to quantify the likelihood of children developing epilepsy based on their gestational age at birth (37–39 weeks or ≥41 weeks). Methods The work is based on term infants born in Sweden between 1983 and 1993 (n = 1,030,168), linked to data on disability pension, child mortality and in-patient epilepsy care. The reference group was defined as infants born at 39 or 40 completed weeks of gestation; compared with infants born at early term (37/38 weeks) or late/post term (41 weeks or more). Primary outcome was defined a-priori as a diagnosis of epilepsy before 20 years of age. Secondary outcomes were childhood mortality (before five years of age), and registered for disability pension before 20 years of age. Logistic regression models were used to assess any association of the outcomes with gestational age at birth. Findings In the unadjusted results, infants born 7 or more days after their due date had higher risks of epilepsy and disability pension than the reference group, but similar risks of child death. Early term infants showed higher risks of epilepsy, disability pension and child death. After adjustment for confounders, there remained a higher risk of epilepsy for both early term (OR 1·19 (1·11–1·29)) and late/post term infants (OR 1·13 (1·06–1·22)). Interpretation Infants born at 37/38 week or 41 weeks and above, when compared to those born at 39 or 40 weeks gestation, have an increased risk of developing epilepsy. This data could be useful in helping women and care givers make decisions with regard to the timing of induction of labour."

Carbamylated proteins accumulate in skin in an age-dependent manner, contributing to tissue alterations. As dermis is affected by systemic sclerosis (SSc) and anti-carbamylated protein antibodies (anti-CarP Ab) are found in SSc patients, we sought to evaluate the specificity of anti-CarP Ab and their relationship with clinical parameters reflecting skin involvement in SSc. This study investigated serum samples and clinical data from 124 patients with SSc. Anti-CarP Ab were affinity purified from pooled SSc sera, and their specificity was assessed by western blotting and ELISA with carbamylated proteins from two species (human and bovine albumin; human fibrinogen). Anti-CarP Ab were measured in SSc serum samples and in 41 healthy aged-matched individuals. Affinity-purified anti-CarP Ab recognized carbamylated epitopes irrespective of the protein type or species origin. Anti-CarP Ab levels inversely correlated with the modified Rodnan skin score (mRss) (Spearman’s R = -0.32, p<0.001), independently of patients’ age. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis identified anti-CarP Ab cut-offs that best discriminated dichotomized clinical variables related to skin involvement: the only clinical variables that were significantly different between groups were mRss (p = 0.001) and scleredema (p<0.001). Low anti-CarP Ab levels were associated with worse skin involvement. Future prospective studies are needed to assess their usefulness in the clinical setting."

Methods The study was exploratory with intention to find a ground for a management theory and to be the root for the development of health care reform in Lithuania. Focus group discussions were held in 10 Lithuanian counties; 10 focus group sessions were carried out. A total of 48 primary health care executives were interviewed. The participants of this qualitative study were given 8 questions related to value creation of the primary health care institution to patients and rise in competitiveness. The main question of the focus group discussion was “What are the main priorities of management of primary health care institution?” The criteria of data collection based on the deep understanding of the phenomenon and the richness of data expressed by participants of the research. Results Qualitative research showed that the priorities of management of primary health care institutions were work management of an organization; human resources management; patient management; and health policy decision making. The participants of focus groups pointed out that effective work of primary health care institutions is ensured by the model of management, doctor-patient communication, quality and timely delivery of health care services, and financial resources. The major decisions involving the management of patients were as follows: meeting patients’ expectations, quality and timely satisfaction of patients’ needs, effective solution of patients’ problems, patient-centered services, patient satisfaction, and communication with the patient. Accessibility to services, quality, geographical accessibility, disease prevention, strengthening of patients’ health and adequate funding were mentioned as the priorities of health policy."

When attempting to identify gene expression profiles using quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), the selection of suitable reference genes is important. Here, the expression levels of 10 commonly used reference genes were assessed for normalization of RT-qPCR in Hcy-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and control cells. The suitability of eight selected candidate genes was comparatively analyzed across the tested samples and separately ranked by four programs, geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and the ΔCt method. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was the most stable gene in the final ranking using the RankAggreg package. Surprisingly, the β-actin (ACTB) levels decreased significantly in Hcy-treated HUVECs compared with control HUVECs (P<0.05), and further study indicated that Hcy suppressed the expression of ACTB by upregulating the miR-145-5p level in Hcy-treated HUVECs. Our data suggest that GAPDH can be used as a reliable reference gene, while ACTB cannot; normalization of gene expression in RT-qPCR experiments in Hcy-treated HUVECs. The data, which identifies a suitable reference gene in Hcy-treated HUVECs, will contribute to the design of an effective and accurate method for quantitation of gene expression."

The metabolic profiles were obtained directly from intact Arabidopsis leaves using high-resolution magic angle spinning (HR-MAS) NMR. Multivariate analysis showed significant alteration of metabolite levels between the mutants and the wild-type Col-0. Interestingly, most of the metabolites that were reduced in the faster-growing mutants are generally involved in the defence against stress.

A total of 2,158 pregnant women and women who had delivered in the past 6 months were interviewed. Latent variables; knowledge of neonatal danger signs (KDS), household level women empowerment (HLWE) and positive perception toward the behavior of health care providers (PPBHCP) were measured using a Five Point Likert Scale. Socioeconomic status (SES), number of antenatal care attendance, perceived cost of treatment (PCT), average distance to health facilities (ADHF) and treatment seeking intention (TSI) were observed variables in the study. A structural equation modeling was applied to test and estimate the hypothesized model of relationships among latent and observed variables and their direct and indirect effects on TSI.KDS, PPBHCP, HLWE, and PCT showed direct, positive and significant association with TSI (β = 0.41, p<0.001, β = 0.08, p<0.002, β = 0.18, p<0.001, and β = 0.06, p<0.002, respectively). SES was not directly associated with TSI. However, it indirectly influenced TSI through three pathways; KDS, number of ANC attendance and HLWE (β = 0.05, p<0.05, β = 0.08, p<0.001 and β = 0.13, p<0.001, respectively). Number of antenatal care was not directly associated with TSI. But indirectly, it affected TSI through its direct effect on KDS and PPBHCP (β = 0.05, p<0.05, β = 0.14, p<0.001, respectively). PPBHCP and HLWE also showed indirect association with TSI through their direct effect on KDS (β = 0.37, p<0.001, β = 0.36, p<0.001, respectively). All in all, the model fitted the sample data and explained 31% of the variance in TSI.PPBHCP, HLWE, PCT and KDS were associated with mothers' TSI for newborn danger signs."
https://openalex.org/W4253786164,"Many blood markers have been shown to predict the recurrence and survival of various malignancies, but the effects of surgery on the body's inflammatory levels may cause changes in these inflammatory markers. Therefore, in this study, we assessed the relationship between changes in platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and survival and recurrence in patients with T3-T4 laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC).Data of patients with T3-T4 HSCC were reviewed. Continuous variables were expressed as mean ± SD and were compared using t test or Mann-Whitney U test. The covariate distributions were compared by Chi-square test. Survival curve was estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis, and Log-Rank test were performed to estimate the survival curve and significance of the difference in survival distribution between groups, respectively. The prognostic value was uncovered by univariate and multivariate Cox hazards analysis.The 413 consecutive patients with LSCC were reviewed. Of these, 362 patients who met the criteria were selected, multi-factor analysis found that pathological T classification(hazard ratio [HR] = 1.878; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.342-3.023; P<0.001), pathological N classification (HR = 1.212; 95% CI = 0.867-2.125; P< 0.001) and change of PLR (HR = 2.158; 95% CI = 1.332-2.889; P = 0.004) associated with postoperative recurrence of T3-T4 LSCC. In addition, the pathological T classification (HR = 1.901; 95% CI = 1.255-2.999; P<0.001), pathological N classification (HR = 1.244; 95% CI = 0.810-2.212; P<0.001) and change of PLR (HR = 2.011; 95% CI = 1.354-2.753; P = 0.001) associated with postoperative survival in patients with T3-T4 LSCC.Results demonstrate that change in PLR may serve as a useful prognostic predictor for patients with T3-T4 LSCC."
https://openalex.org/W2907740589,"Mate choice is an important process in sexual selection and usually prevents inbreeding depression in populations. In the terrestrial isopod Armadillidium vulgare, the close physical proximity between individuals may increase the risk of reproducing with siblings. Moreover, individuals of this species can be infected with the feminizing bacteria of Wolbachia, which influence male mate choice. However, little is known about the kinship or familiarity assessment of the selected partner that occurs when a male can choose between females with or without Wolbachia. To investigate the potential mechanisms leading to mate choice and the potential impact of the parasite, we performed behavioral choice tests on males where they could choose between sibling vs. nonsibling females, familiar vs. unfamiliar females, and sibling familiar vs. unfamiliar nonsibling females. To investigate the costs of inbreeding, we compared the reproductive success of both sibling and nonsibling mates. Our results revealed that male copulation attempts were higher for familiar females and for nonsibling females when both females were Wolbachia-infected, but the duration was longer when both females were Wolbachia-free. When males mated with a sibling female, their fecundity was severely decreased, consistent with inbreeding depression. Overall, we observed copulations with all types of females and demonstrated discrimination capacities and potential preferences. We highlight the complexity of the tradeoff between kinship, familiarity and parasite transmission assessment for mate choice."
https://openalex.org/W2907798528,"Middle cerebral artery (MCA) and umbilical artery (UA) Doppler blood flow pulsatility indices (PIs) and MCA peak systolic velocity (PSV) are essential variables for clinically evaluating fetal well-being. Here we examined how a maternal meal influenced these Doppler blood flow velocity variables.This prospective cohort study included 89 healthy Caucasian women with normal singleton pregnancies (median age, 32 years). Measurements were performed at gestational weeks 30 and 36, representing the start and near the end of the energy-depositing period. Measured variables included the MCA-PI, UA-PI, fetal heart rate (FHR) and MCA-PSV. The cerebroplacental ratio (CPR) was calculated as the ratio of MCA-PI to UA-PI. The first examination was performed in the fasting state at 08:30 a.m. Then participants ate a standard breakfast (approximate caloric intake, 400kcal), and the examination was repeated ~105 min after the meal.Without adjustment for FHR, fetal MCA-PI decreased after the meal at week 30 (‒0.115; p = 0.012) and week 36 (‒0.255; p < 0.001). All PI values were negatively correlated with FHR. After adjustment for FHR, MCA-PI still decreased after the meal at week 30 (‒0.087; p = 0.044) and week 36 (‒0.194; p < 0.001). The difference between the two gestational weeks was non-significant (p = 0.075). UA-PI values did not significantly change at week 30 (p = 0.253) or week 36 (p = 0.920). CPR revealed significant postprandial decreases of -0.17 at week 30 (p = 0.006) and -0.22 at week 36 (p = 0.001). Compared to fasting values, MCA-PSV was significantly higher after food intake: +3.9 cm/s at week 30 (p < 0.001) and +5.9 cm/s at week 36 (p < 0.001).In gestational weeks 30 and 36, we observed a postprandial influence that was apparently specific to fetal cerebral blood flow."

Women who were excluded from a randomized trial in Kenya were followed to create a comparison between women who were enrolled and did not receive the study SMS intervention and women who were screened but not enrolled.Parallel-cohort randomized controlled trial analysis.We compared time to infant HIV testing between women in three groups: the Trial SMS group, the Trial Control group, and the Comparison Cohort comprised of women who were screened but not enrolled.Of the 1,115 women screened, 388 (35%) were eligible for trial enrollment, and were randomized to receive either intervention text messages (Trial SMS; N = 195) or continue usual care (Trial Control; N = 193). Among 727 women not enrolled in the study (Comparison Cohort), we obtained infant HIV testing data from clinic records for 510 (70%). The cumulative probability of infant HIV testing was highest in the Trial SMS group (92.0%; 95% CI 87.5-95.3), followed by the Trial Control group (85.1%; 95% CI 79.5-89.8), and lowest among women in the Comparison Cohort (43.4%; 95% CI 39.2-47.8).Both the Trial SMS group and the Trial Control group were significantly more likely to have their infants tested for HIV compared to the Comparison Cohort, providing evidence of a ""clinical trial effect."" This analysis suggests that SMS interventions should be implemented as an adjunct to consistent and engaged delivery of basic health services."
https://openalex.org/W2907235386,"The availability of accurate techniques to discriminate between marked laboratory-reared flies and unmarked wild flies captured in monitoring traps is essential for programs that integrate the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) to manage fruit flies. In this study, the feasibility of using a stable isotope marking technique for the South American fruit fly, Anastrepha fraterculus (Wiedemann), was assessed. Wild flies were collected from apple orchards, which are a target of a SIT project in southern Brazil. To verify if adult flies could be labelled by the stable isotopes from larval diets, larvae were reared on two different C4-based diets and fruits in laboratory. To evaluate the influence of the two most common attractants applied to capture A. fraterculus (grape juice and CeraTrapTM) and the most common preservation method in fruit fly collections (ethanol), laboratory-reared flies were immersed in McPhail traps containing the respective treatments for two periods of time. Samples were analyzed in an elemental analyzer coupled to a Continuous Flow Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer (CF-IRMS) at CENA/USP. The δ13C signatures of flies reared on artificial diets differed significantly from the δ13C of flies whose larvae were reared on fruits and from wild flies. In contrast, the δ15N values were less conclusive and the technique could not rely solely on them. In all cases considered, the δ13C and δ15N signatures from males did not differ from females. Despite the alterations caused by the attractants tested and ethanol, laboratory-flies could be distinguished from the wild ones based on δ13C signatures. This is the first comprehensive study to demonstrate that it is possible to distinguish wild A. fraterculus from flies reared on larval diets containing C4 sugar. The first experimentally derived trophic discrimination factors were also obtained for this species. Thus, intrinsic isotope labelling can serve as a backup to conventional dye marking."
https://openalex.org/W2907460016,"An anesthetic protocol was optimized for microinjection-related handling of Siberian sturgeon (Acipenser baerii; Acipenseriformes) prolarvae, an extant primitive fish species commonly grown in aquaculture. Comparative examinations of three selected anesthetics (clove oil, lidocaine, and MS-222) with a dosage regime of 50, 100, 200, and 400 mg/L indicated that MS-222 was the most efficient agent for Siberian sturgeon prolarvae, as evidenced by the fast induction of anesthesia with quick and uniform recovery. Meanwhile, clove oil should be avoided, due to prolonged recovery times varying widely between individuals. None of the tested anesthetics significantly affected prolarval viability at any of the dosage regimes tested in this study. Based on an analysis of the duration of an unconscious state in air, we recommend a dose of 200 mg/L MS-222 for microinjection. Recovery time after use of this dose was influenced by the prolarval age and the development of gills, in which prolarvae older than 3 days after hatching required longer recovery times than did younger prolarvae. Post-recovery behavioral assessment showed no apparent difference between MS-222-anesthetized and non-anesthetized prolarvae in their swimming behavior and phototactic responses. Applicability of currently developed anesthetic protocol using MS-222 in larval microinjection was demonstrated with the injection of a visible dye to the anesthetized prolarvae, followed by the analysis of post-recovery viability. Taken together, the present anesthetic protocol based on 200 mg/L of MS-222 could provide researchers with practical usefulness with good safety margins for the micromanipulation and other related handlings of Siberian sturgeon prolarvae."
https://openalex.org/W2907864705,"One way in which people may cope with sadness is to seek positive social contact. We examined whether subtle reminders of Facebook increase positive mood and thus attenuate the interest in social activities that is typically enhanced by sad mood induction. Participants watched either a loss-related sad or neutral video and were afterwards presented with either a Facebook, positive (sun) or neutral (Word) icon. We then examined their mood and their desire to engage in social activities as well as their feeling of belonging. The presentation of the Facebook icon increased feelings of belonging, but it did not influence participants' other responses to the sad video. Participants reported more negative mood and a greater desire to engage in social activities after the sad (vs. control) video regardless of the icon condition. The results suggest that the activation of thoughts about Facebook can enhance users' feeling of belonging; however, this effect might not be sufficient to facilitate coping with loss-related sadness."
https://openalex.org/W2906698758,"Although the study of pathogen sensing by host defense systems continues to uncover a role for inflammasome components specific to particular pathogens, gaps remain in our knowledge. After internalization, Francisella escapes from the phagosome in mononuclear cells and is thought to be detected by intracellular pathogen-response-receptors pyrin and Aim2 in human and murine models, respectively. However, it remains controversial as to the role of pyrin in detecting Francisella. Our current work aims to study the contribution of inflammasome sensor, Pyrin in regulating microparticulate caspase-1/GSDM-D activation by Francisella. Our findings suggest that NLRP3 is central to the activation/release of active caspase-1/GSDM-D encapsulated in microparticles (MP) by Francisella. We also provide evidence that this regulation is independent of pyrin, implicated in sensing cytosolic Francisella in NLRP3-/- conditions where endogenous Pyrin is present. Absence of NLRP3 completely abrogated Francisella mediated MP caspase-1/GSDM-D activation and release both before and after internalization of the pathogen. However, deletion of pyrin not only enhanced both LPS and Francisella mediated MP active caspase-1/GSDM-D release, but pyrin overexpression resulted in a reduction of inflammasome activation and release; suggesting an inhibitory role of pyrin in LPS and Francisella mediated MP responses. This NLRP3 dependence and inhibitory effect of pyrin correlated with cytokine release as well. These observations also correlated with MPs ability to induce cell death; as LPS and Francisella-induced MPs from pyrin-deficient cells were more potent than wild-type monocytes whereas, NLRP3-/- MPs failed to induce cell death. Taken together, we report that NLPR3 not only mediates Francisella induced cytokine responses, but is also critical for cytokine-independent microparticle-induced inflammasome activation and endothelial cell injury independent of pyrin."
https://openalex.org/W2907257880,"A central experimental task in executive control research is the Stop-signal task, which allows measuring the ability to inhibit dominant responses. A crucial aspect of this task consists of varying the delay between the Go- and Stop-signal. Since the time necessary to administer the task can be long, a method of optimal delay choice was recently proposed: the PSI method. In a behavioral experiment, we show a variant of this method, the PSI marginal method, to be unable to deal with the Go-response slowing often observed in the Stop-signal task. We propose the PSI adjusted method, which is able to deal with this response slowing by correcting the estimation process for the current reaction time. In several sets of behavioral simulations, as well as another behavioral experiment, we document and compare the statistical properties of the PSI marginal method, our PSI adjusted method, and the traditional staircase method, both when reaction times are constant and when they are linearly increasing. The results show the PSI adjusted method's performance to be comparable to the PSI marginal method in the case of constant Go-response times, and to outperform the PSI marginal method as well as the staircase methods when there is response slowing. The PSI adjusted method thus offers the possibility of efficient estimation of Stop-signal reaction times in the face of response slowing."
https://openalex.org/W2796331771,"Psychometric properties of perceptual assessments, like reliability, depend on stochastic properties of psychophysical sampling procedures resulting in method variability, as well as inter- and intra-subject variability. Method variability is commonly minimized by optimizing sampling procedures through computer simulations. Inter-subject variability is inherent to the population of interest and cannot be influenced. Intra-subject variability introduced by confounds (e.g., inattention or lack of motivation) cannot be simply quantified from experimental data, as these data also include method variability. Therefore, this aspect is generally neglected when developing assessments. Yet, comparing method variability and intra-subject variability could give insights on whether effort should be invested in optimizing the sampling procedure, or in addressing potential confounds instead. We propose a new approach to estimate intra-subject variability of psychometric functions by combining computer simulations and behavioral data, and to account for it when simulating experiments. The approach was illustrated in a real-world scenario of proprioceptive difference threshold assessments. The behavioral study revealed a test-retest reliability of r = 0.212. Computer simulations without considering intra-subject variability predicted a reliability of r = 0.768, whereas the new approach including an intra-subject variability model lead to a realistic estimate of reliability (r = 0.207). Such a model also allows computing the theoretically maximally attainable reliability (r = 0.552) assuming an ideal sampling procedure. Comparing the reliability estimates when exclusively accounting for method variability versus intra-subject variability reveals that intra-subject variability should be reduced by addressing confounds and that only optimizing the sampling procedure may be insufficient to achieve a high reliability. This new approach allows computing the intra-subject variability with only two measurements per subject, and predicting the reliability for a larger number of subjects and retests based on simulations, without requiring additional experiments. Such a tool of predictive value is especially valuable for target populations where time is scarce, e.g., for assessments in clinical settings."
https://openalex.org/W2908469445,"Objective To investigate trends in the incidence of imported malaria in the UK between 2005 and 2016. Design Analysis of longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) in The Health Improvement Network (THIN) primary care database. Setting UK primary care Participants In total, we examined 12,349,003 individuals aged 0 to 99 years. Outcome measure The rate of malaria recordings in THIN was calculated per year between 2005 and 2016. Rate ratios exploring differences by age, sex, location of general practice, socioeconomic status and ethnicity were estimated using multivariable Poisson regression. Results A total of 1,474 individuals with a first diagnosis of malaria were identified in THIN between 2005 and 2016. The incidence of recorded malaria followed a decreasing trend dropping from a rate of 3.33 in 2005 to 1.36 cases per 100,000 person years at risk in 2016. Multivariable Poisson regression showed that adults of working age (20 to 69 years), men, those registered with a general practice in London, higher social deprivation and non-white ethnicity were associated with higher rates of malaria recordings. Conclusion There has been a decrease in the number of malaria recordings in UK primary care over the past decade. This decrease exceeds the rate of decline reported in national surveillance data; however there are similar associations with age, sex and deprivation. Improved geographic information on the distribution of cases and the potential for automation of case identification suggests that EHRs could provide a complementary role for investigating malaria trends over time."
https://openalex.org/W2907516164,"The National Cancer Institute's (NCI) wear time classification algorithm uses a rule based on the occurrence of physical activity data counts-a cumulative measure of movement, influenced by both magnitude and duration of acceleration-to differentiate between when a physical activity monitoring (PAM) device (ActiGraph accelerometer) is being worn by a participant (wear) from when it is not (nonwear). It was applied to PAM data generated from the 2003-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 2003-2004). We discuss two corner case conditions that can produce unexpected, and perhaps unintended results when the algorithm is applied. We show, using simulated data of two special cases, how this algorithm classifies a 24-hour period with only 72 total counts as 100% wear in one case, and classifies a 24-hour period with 96,000 counts as 0.1% wear in another. The prevalence of like scenarios in the NHANES 2003-2004 PAM dataset is presented with corresponding summary statistics for varying degrees of the algorithm's nonwear classification threshold (T). The number of participants with valid days, defined as 10 or more hours classified as wear time in a 24-hour day, increased while the mean counts-per-minute (CPM) decreased as the threshold for excluding non-wear was reduced from the allowed 4,000 counts in an hour. The number of participants with four or more valid days increased 2.29% (n = 113) and mean CPM dropped 2.45% (9.5 CPM) when adjusting the nonwear classification threshold to 50 counts an hour. Applying the most liberal criteria, only excluding hours as nonwear which contained 1 count or less, resulted in a 397 more participants (7.83% increase) and 26.5 fewer CPM (6.98% decrease) in NHANES 2003-2004 participants with four or more valid days. The algorithm should be used with caution due to the potential influence of these corner cases."
