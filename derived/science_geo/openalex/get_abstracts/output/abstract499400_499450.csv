https://openalex.org/W2023244494,"Inhibition of sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) has been reported as a new therapeutic strategy for treating diabetes. However, the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on the kidney is unknown. In addition, whether SGLT2 inhibitors have an anti-inflammatory or antioxidative stress effect is still unclear. In this study, to resolve these issues, we evaluated the effects of the SGLT2 inhibitor, dapagliflozin, using a mouse model of type 2 diabetes and cultured proximal tubular epithelial (mProx24) cells. Male db/db mice were administered 0.1 or 1.0 mg/kg of dapagliflozin for 12 weeks. Body weight, blood pressure, blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c, albuminuria and creatinine clearance were measured. Mesangial matrix accumulation and interstitial fibrosis in the kidney and pancreatic β-cell mass were evaluated by histological analysis. Furthermore, gene expression of inflammatory mediators, such as osteopontin, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and transforming growth factor-β, was evaluated by quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR. In addition, oxidative stress was evaluated by dihydroethidium and NADPH oxidase 4 staining. Administration of 0.1 or 1.0 mg/kg of dapagliflozin ameliorated hyperglycemia, β-cell damage and albuminuria in db/db mice. Serum creatinine, creatinine clearance and blood pressure were not affected by administration of dapagliflozin, but glomerular mesangial expansion and interstitial fibrosis were suppressed in a dose-dependent manner. Dapagliflozin treatment markedly decreased macrophage infiltration and the gene expression of inflammation and oxidative stress in the kidney of db/db mice. Moreover, dapagliflozin suppressed the high-glucose-induced gene expression of inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress in cultured mProx24 cells. These data suggest that dapagliflozin ameliorates diabetic nephropathy by improving hyperglycemia along with inhibiting inflammation and oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2066858562,"Bisphenol-A (BPA) is one of the most widespread EDCs used as a base compound in the manufacture of polycarbonate plastics. The aim of our research has been to study how the exposure to BPA during pregnancy affects weight, glucose homeostasis, pancreatic β-cell function and gene expression in the major peripheral organs that control energy flux: white adipose tissue (WAT), the liver and skeletal muscle, in male offspring 17 and 28 weeks old. Pregnant mice were treated with a subcutaneous injection of 10 µg/kg/day of BPA or a vehicle from day 9 to 16 of pregnancy. One month old offspring were divided into four different groups: vehicle treated mice that ate a normal chow diet (Control group); BPA treated mice that also ate a normal chow diet (BPA); vehicle treated animals that had a high fat diet (HFD) and BPA treated animals that were fed HFD (HFD-BPA). The BPA group started to gain weight at 18 weeks old and caught up to the HFD group before week 28. The BPA group as well as the HFD and HFD-BPA ones presented fasting hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance and high levels of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) in plasma compared with the Control one. Glucose stimulated insulin release was disrupted, particularly in the HFD-BPA group. In WAT, the mRNA expression of the genes involved in fatty acid metabolism, Srebpc1, Pparα and Cpt1β was decreased by BPA to the same extent as with the HFD treatment. BPA treatment upregulated Pparγ and Prkaa1 genes in the liver; yet it diminished the expression of Cd36. Hepatic triglyceride levels were increased in all groups compared to control. In conclusion, male offspring from BPA-treated mothers presented symptoms of diabesity. This term refers to a form of diabetes which typically develops in later life and is associated with obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2151219341,"In cattle, conceptus-maternal interactions are critical for the establishment and maintenance of pregnancy. A major component of this early interaction involves the transport of nutrients and secretion of key molecules by uterine epithelial cells to help support conceptus development during the peri-implantation period of pregnancy. Objectives were to: 1) analyze temporal changes in the amino acid (AA) content of uterine luminal fluid (ULF) during the bovine estrous cycle; 2) understand conceptus-induced alterations in AA content; 3) determine expression of AA transporters in the endometrium and conceptus; and 4) determine how these transporters are modulated by (Progesterone) P4. Concentrations of aspartic acid, arginine, glutamine, histidine, lysine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine and tyrosine decreased on Day 16 of the estrous cycle but increased on Day 19 in pregnant heifers (P<0.05). Glutamic acid only increased in pregnant heifers on Day 19 (P<0.001). Asparagine concentrations were greater in ULF of cyclic compared to pregnant heifers on Day 7 (P<0.05) while valine concentrations were higher in pregnant heifers on Day 16 (P<0.05). Temporal changes in expression of the cationic AA transporters SLC7A1 SLC7A4 and SLC7A6 occurred in the endometrium during the estrous cycle/early pregnancy coordinate with changes in conceptus expression of SLC7A4, SLC7A2 and SLC7A1 (P<0.05). Only one acidic AA transporter (SLC1A5) increased in the endometrium while conceptus expression of SLC1A4 increased (P<0.05). The neutral AA transporters SLC38A2 and SLC7A5 increased in the endometrium in a temporal manner while conceptus expression of SLC38A7, SLC43A2, SLC38A11 and SLC7A8 also increased (P<0.05). P4 modified the expression of SLC1A1, -1A4, -1A5, -38A2, -38A4, -38A7, -43A2, -6A14, -7A1, -7A5 and -7A7 in the endometrium. Results demonstrate that temporal changes in AA in the ULF reflect changes in transporter expression in the endometrium and conceptus during early pregnancy in cattle, some of which are modified by P4."
https://openalex.org/W2063621566,"Sirtuin-1 (SIRT1), NAD+-dependent deacetylase, has been linked to anabolic effects in cartilage, although the mechanisms of SIRT1 signaling during differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to chondrocytes are poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated the role of SIRT1-mediated signaling during chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs in vitro. High density and alginate cultures of MSCs were treated with chondrogenic induction medium with/without the SIRT1 inhibitor nicotinamide, antisense oligonucleotides against SIRT1 (SIRT1-ASO), IL-1β, and/or resveratrol. Transient transfection of MSCs with SIRT1-antisense oligonucleotides, nicotinamide, and IL-1β inhibited chondrogenesis-induced down-regulation of cartilage-specific proteins, cartilage-specific transcription factor Sox9, and enhanced NF-κB-regulated gene products involved in the inflammatory and degradative processes in cartilage (MMP-9, COX-2, and caspase-3), and NF-κB phosphorylation, acetylation, and activation of IκBα kinase. In contrast, the SIRT1 activator resveratrol or BMS-345541 (inhibitor of IKK) inhibited IL-1β- and NAM-induced suppression of cartilage-specific proteins, Sox9, and up-regulation of NF-κB-regulated gene products. Moreover, SIRT1 was found to interact directly with NF-κB and resveratrol-suppressed IL-1β and NAM but not SIRT1-ASO-induced NF-κB phosphorylation, acetylation, and activation of IκBα kinase. Knockdown of SIRT1 by mRNA abolished the inhibitory effects of resveratrol on inflammatory and apoptotic signaling and Sox9 expression, suggesting the essential role of this enzyme. Finally, the modulatory effects of resveratrol were found to be mediated at least in part by the association between SIRT1 and Sox9. These results indicate for the first time that SIRT1 supports chondrogenic development of MSCs at least in part through inhibition/deacetylation of NF-κB and activation of Sox9.

Several other investigations and our laboratory have clearly demonstrated that three-dimensional culture models of mesenchyme-derived cells are suitable to develop and differentiate MSCs toward chondrocytes as they closely replicate the extensive cell-matrix interactions that occur in vivo (2.Csaki C.

However, age-related arthritic disease, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis are involved in the degenerative changes in the joint, leading to loss of function, pain, and significant disability (15.Sandell L.J. Aigner T. Articular cartilage and changes in arthritis. An introduction: cell biology of osteoarthritis.Arthritis Res. 2001; 3: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). It is known that articular cartilage is an avascular, alymphatic, and aneural tissue with bradytrophic characteristics and a very poor capacity for self-repair and regeneration (16.Hunziker E.B. Articular cartilage repair: are the intrinsic biological constraints undermining this process insuperable?.Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 1999; 7: 15-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 17.Buckwalter J.A. Brown T.D. Joint injury, repair, and remodeling: roles in post-traumatic osteoarthritis.Clin. Orthop. Relat. Res. 2004; 423: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). This weakness in cartilage repair capacity highlights the need for novel treatments using tissue engineering and regenerative medicine and new regenerative strategies involving stimulation of articular cartilage repair in vivo (18.Goepfert C. Slobodianski A. Schilling A.F. Adamietz P. Pörtner R. Cartilage engineering from mesenchymal stem cells.Adv. Biochem. Eng. Biotechnol. 2010; 123: 163-200PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, it has been shown that adult MSC-like progenitors also exist in the cartilage tissue and that their abundance in arthritic cartilage is elevated (19.Alsalameh S. Amin R. Gemba T. Lotz M. Identification of mesenchymal progenitor cells in normal and osteoarthritic human articular cartilage.Arthritis Rheum. 2004; 50: 1522-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). The lack of regeneration in cartilage can be due to the ongoing inflammatory microenvironment that occurs during the course of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. It is therefore important to block the pro-inflammatory cytokine-induced cartilage degeneration and at the same time create a more suitable microenvironment for the chondrogenesis of MSC-like progenitors (20.Buhrmann C. Mobasheri A. Matis U. Shakibaei M. Curcumin mediated suppression of nuclear factor-κB promotes chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells in a high density co-culture microenvironment.Arthritis Res. Ther. 2010; 12: R127Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Resveratrol (3,5,4′-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene) is a phytoalexin (polyphenolic compound) found in the skin of red grapes, cranberries, peanuts, and root extracts of the weed Polygonum cuspidatum (21.Baolin L. Inami Y. Tanaka H. Inagaki N. Iinuma M. Nagai H. Resveratrol inhibits the release of mediators from bone marrow-derived mouse mast cells in vitro.Planta Med. 2004; 70: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Several reports have demonstrated that resveratrol has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antitumor activity in cancer cell lines derived from human and animal tumors (22.Gautam S.C. Xu Y.X.

Haematol. 2000; 109: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). One of the most important and functional novel molecular targets of resveratrol is sirtuin-1 (SIRT1), a member of the sirtuin family of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent deacetylases, which is found to be an anti-aging gene (25.Knutson M.D. Leeuwenburgh C.

Small molecule activators of SIRT1 as therapeutics for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.Nature. 2007; 450: 712-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (1450) Google Scholar). SIRT1 is able to de-acetylate many different transcription factors in the nucleus such as p53, NF-κB, myogenic differentiation, high mobility group I, E2F transcription factor, and forkhead box O, thus playing an essential role in cell differentiation, cell survival, tumorigenesis, inflammation, and metabolism (27.Chen Lf Fischle W.

Moreover, SIRT1 targets chromatin (histones) as well as nonchromatin proteins in the cells, has been linked to transcriptional silencing, and appears to play a key role in inflammation (32.Kotas M.E.

More recently, several reports have shown that normal cartilage homeostasis requires enzymatically active SIRT1 protein in vivo (34.Gabay O. Oppenhiemer H. Meir H. Zaal K. Sanchez C. Dvir-Ginzberg M.

In the past, it has been shown that SIRT1 plays an essential role in a variety of tissue development and diseases. However, still little is known about its role in MSC differentiation. The purpose of this study was therefore to examine whether SIRT1, at least in part, regulates differentiation of MSCs to chondrocytes in vitro. Acetylated lysine (Ac-K-103) antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Monoclonal and polyclonal antibody to SIRT1 was purchased from Abcam PLC (Cambridge, UK). Polyclonal anti-collagen type II, monoclonal anti-adult cartilage-specific proteoglycan (CSPGs), and alkaline phosphatase-linked sheep anti-mouse and sheep anti-rabbit secondary antibodies for immunoblotting were from Millipore (Schwalbach, Germany). Antibodies to active caspase-3 and MMP-9 were from R&D Systems, Inc. (Heidelberg, Germany). Cyclo-oxygenase-2 antibody was obtained from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Anti-phospho-specific p65 (NF-κB)/(Ser-536) and anti-phospho-specific IκBα (Ser-32/36) were obtained from Cell Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Anti-IKK-α and anti-IKK-β antibodies were obtained from Imgenex (Hamburg, Germany). Monoclonal anti-Sox9, monoclonal anti-CD105, monoclonal anti-CD90, monoclonal anti-CD45, and monoclonal anti-CD34 were purchased from Acris Antibodies GmbH (Hiddenhausen, Germany). Monoclonal anti-β-actin was purchased from Sigma. Secondary antibodies used for fluorescence labeling were purchased from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany). All antibodies were used at concentrations and dilutions recommended by the manufacturer. Whole cell culture growth medium consisting of DMEM/Ham's F-12 1:1, 10% FBS, 1% partricin solution, 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution (10,000 IU/10,000 IU), 75 μg/ml ascorbic acid, 1% essential amino acids, and 1% glutamine were purchased from Seromed (Munich, Germany). BMS-345541, NAM, and resveratrol were purchased from Sigma. Resveratrol was prepared as a 1000 μm solution in ethanol and then further diluted in cell culture medium. The final concentration of ethanol did not, in any case, exceed 0.5%. Further dilutions were made in cell culture medium to achieve the final working concentrations. Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) was purchased from Acris antibodies GmbH (Herold, Germany). Primary human chondrocytes (catalog no. 121 0211) and human mesenchymal stem cells (catalog no. 121 0911 HMSC-bm) were obtained from Provitro (Berlin, Germany). Specimens of knee joint cartilage and human bone marrow were obtained with total informed consent and approval of the ethics committee of the Charité-University Medical School Berlin (Germany). Cells were seeded at a density of 300,000 cells/T75 flask, cultured in whole cell culture medium, and passaged at 70–80% confluence. Passages 3–4 were used for the experiments. Characterization of MCS was performed by immunofluorescent evaluation of a set of defined markers (CD105+, CD90+, CD45−, and CD34−) (37.Dominici M. Le Blanc K. Mueller I. Slaper-Cortenbach I. Marini F. Krause D. Deans R. Keating A. Prockop Dj Horwitz E. Minimal criteria for defining multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells.

To quantify the population for each marker, the number of cells with positive labeling was determined by scoring 300 cells from 10 different microscopic fields within the stained slides. Chondrogenic differentiation of MSC was performed in high density culture and in alginate bead culture as described previously (2.Csaki C. Matis U. Mobasheri A. Ye H. Shakibaei M.

Int. 1997; 21: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We have used alginate bead culture complementary to high density culture, because in alginate bead culture the cells have strong chondrogenic potential; additionally it is fairly easy to retrieve the cells from alginate to perform additional experiments such as immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, and MTT assays. For high density culture, a 10-μl drop of ∼1 million cells was plated on a cellulose filter on top of a steel mesh bridge. Cell culture medium reached the filter medium interface, and cells were nurtured through diffusion. This model allows the cells to aggregate, and after 1 day in culture, the cells formed a three-dimensional pellet on the filter. For alginate bead culture, ∼2 million cells/ml alginate were encapsulated in sterile alginate (2.5% in 0.15 m NaCl solution) by pipetting single drops into a 100 mm CaCl2 solution. At contact with the CaCl2 solution, the alginate drops polymerized forming a round and stable bead. To ensure adequate polymerization, beads were incubated with 100 mm CaCl2 solution for 10 min. Subsequently, beads were rinsed three times in 0.15 m NaCl solution followed by washing two times with complete cell culture medium to remove excess NaCl/CaCl2 solution and were transposed to a new Petri dish. Chondrogenic differentiation medium was prepared as described by Pittenger et al. (1.Pittenger M.F. Mackay A.M. Beck S.C. Jaiswal R.K. Douglas R. Mosca J.D. Moorman M.A. Simonetti D.W. Craig S.

Ten ng/ml human TGFβ1 (Acris Antibodies GmbH, Germany) was added freshly to the medium before each medium change, and medium changes were made three times/week. The cultures were incubated for 14 days in a humidified incubator at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 before further evaluation. Transient transfection of primary human chondrocytes, chondrogenic differentiated MSCs, and MSCs undergoing chondrogenesis was performed as described previously (38.Busch F. Mobasheri A. Shayan P.

Phosphorothioated antisense oligonucleotide derived from mRNA nucleotide sequence of sirtuin-1 gene (SIRT1-ASO) (sequence 5′-GTATTCCACATGAAACAGACA-3′) and control sense oligonucleotides (SIRT1-SO) (sequence 5′-TGTCTGTTTCATGTGGAATAC-3′) used in the experiments were synthesized by Eurofins (MWG/Operon, Ebersberg, Germany). SIRT1-ASO and SIRT1-SO were phosphorothioate-modified to protect them from the cell nucleases. Cells in monolayer culture were transfected by incubation with 0.5 μm SIRT1-ASO or SIRT1-SO and 10 μl/ml Lipofectin transfection reagent (Invitrogen) in serum-starved medium (3% FCS) for 24 h before starting the respective experiments. All monolayer transfection experiments were carried out on 50–60% confluent monolayer cultures. For transfection of high density and alginate bead cultures, MSCs (1 × 106) were either untreated or pretreated in slurry with resveratrol (5 μm) for 4 h in serum-starved medium. After this treatment, whole cells were transferred to high density or alginate cultures and either served as controls (no treatment) or were transfected with various concentrations (0.1, 0.5, 1, and 5 μm) of SIRT1-ASO or SIRT1-SO in the presence of Lipofectin (10 μl/ml) transfection reagent in chondrogenic induction medium for 14 days. Culture medium with SIRT1-ASO or SIRT1-SO was changed every 3 days. To evaluate chondrogenic ultrastructure, transmission electron microscopy was performed as described previously in detail (39.Shakibaei M. De Souza P. Merker H.J. Integrin expression and collagen type II implicated in maintenance of chondrocyte shape in monolayer culture: an immunomorphological study.Cell Biol. Int. 1997; 21: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Briefly, cultures were fixed for 1 h in Karnovsky fixative, post-fixed in 1% OsO4 solution, dehydrated in serial alcohol dilutions, and embedded in Epon (Plano, Germany). Following this, ultrathin cuts were made on a Reichert-Ultracut E, contrasted with a mixture of 2% uranyl acetate/lead citrate, and evaluated with a Zeiss 10 transmission electron microscope (Institute of Pharmacology, Berlin, Germany). Ultrathin sections of the cultures were prepared and evaluated with a transmission electron microscope. To quantify the apoptotic cells, the number of cells with morphological features of apoptotic cell death was determined by scoring 100 cells from 25 different microscopic fields. Western blotting of whole cell lysates was performed as described previously (40.Shakibaei M. John T. De Souza P. Rahmanzadeh R. Merker H.J.

Briefly, whole cell lysate proteins were extracted with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 0.01% (v/v) aprotinin, 4 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, PMSF) on ice for 30 min, and total protein content was measured. Subsequently, samples were reduced with 2-mercaptoethanol, and total protein concentrations were adjusted. After separation of proteins by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, samples were blotted onto a membrane using a transblot apparatus (Bio-Rad) and blocked for 2 h in 5% (w/v) skimmed milk powder in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20. Membranes were incubated overnight with the primary antibody at a 1:1000 dilution in blocking buffer at 4 °C on a shaker. Incubation with the secondary antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase was performed for 90 min. After washing the membranes three times in 0.1 m Tris, pH 9.5, containing 0.05 m MgCl2 and 0.1 m NaCl, specific antigen-antibody complexes were detected using nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoylphosphate (p-toluidine salt; Pierce) as substrates for alkaline phosphatase. To evaluate the effect of resveratrol on IL-1β-, NAM-, and SIRT1-ASO-induced p65 acetylation and Sox9 expression, endogenous protein interactions from high density and alginate cultures were evaluated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments using SIRT1, anti-acetyl-lysine, and Sox9 antibodies. After 14 days, whole cell extracts were washed and lysed to prepare whole cell lysates. Whole cell extracts were precleared by incubating with 25 μl of either normal rabbit IgG serum or mouse IgG serum and protein A/G-Sepharose beads. The precleared whole cell extract was incubated with primary antibodies (anti-SIRT1 or anti-Sox9) and diluted in wash buffer (0.1% Tween 20, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm PMSF) for 2 h at 4 °C and finally with protein A/G-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. After incubation, immunocomplexes were washed with lysis buffer, boiled with SDS sample buffer for 5 min, resolved on SDS-PAGE, and subjected to Western blot analysis using an anti-acetyl-lysine, anti-SIRT1, or anti-Sox9 antibodies. The original samples were also detected using antibodies against poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase or β-actin. To investigate the interplay between SIRT1 and IκBα activation during chondrogenesis, an immune complex kinase assay was performed. The IKK complex was immunoprecipitated from whole cell lysates with antibodies against IKK-α and IKK-β and subsequently incubated with protein A/G-agarose beads (Pierce).

https://openalex.org/W2062172769,"Background The aberrant regulation of phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases (PI3-K)/Akt, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and mammalian target of rapamycin (m-TOR) signaling pathways in cancer has prompted significant interest in the suppression of these pathways to treat cancer. Caffeic acid (CA) has been reported to possess important anti-inflammatory actions. However, the molecular mechanisms by which CA derivatives including caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) and caffeic acid phenylpropyl ester (CAPPE), exert inhibitory effects on the proliferation of human colorectal cancer (CRC) cells have yet to be elucidated. Methodology/Principal Findings CAPE and CAPPE were evaluated for their ability to modulate these signaling pathways and suppress the proliferation of CRC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Anti-cancer effects of these CA derivatives were measured by using proliferation assays, cell cycle analysis, western blotting assay, reporter gene assay and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining assays both in vitro and in vivo. This study demonstrates that CAPE and CAPPE exhibit a dose-dependent inhibition of proliferation and survival of CRC cells through the induction of G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and augmentation of apoptotic pathways. Consumption of CAPE and CAPPE significantly inhibited the growth of colorectal tumors in a mouse xenograft model. The mechanisms of action included a modulation of PI3-K/Akt, AMPK and m-TOR signaling cascades both in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, the results demonstrate novel anti-cancer mechanisms of CA derivatives against the growth of human CRC cells. Conclusions CA derivatives are potent anti-cancer agents that augment AMPK activation and promote apoptosis in human CRC cells. The structure of CA derivatives can be used for the rational design of novel inhibitors that target human CRC cells."
https://openalex.org/W2152421797,"Because existing instruments for assessing surgical fear seem either too general or too limited, the Surgical Fear Questionnaire (SFQ) was developed. The aim of this study is to assess the validity and reliability of the SFQ.Based on existing literature and expert consultation the ten-item SFQ was composed. Data on the SFQ were obtained from 5 prospective studies (N = 3233) in inpatient or day surgery patients. These data were used for exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), reliability analysis and validity analysis.EFA in Study 1 and 2 revealed a two-factor structure with one factor associated with fear of the short-term consequences of surgery (SFQ-s, item 1-4) and the other factor with fear of the long-term consequences of surgery (SFQ-l, item 5-10). However, in both studies two items of the SFQ-l had low factor loadings. Therefore in Study 3 and 4 the 2-factor structure was tested and confirmed by CFA in an eight-item version of the SFQ. Across all studies significant correlations of the SFQ with pain catastrophizing, state anxiety, and preoperative pain intensity indicated good convergent validity. Internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) was between 0.765-0.920 (SFQ-total), 0.766-0.877 (SFQ-s), and 0.628-0.899 (SFQ-l). The SFQ proved to be sensitive to detect differences based on age, sex, education level, employment status and preoperative pain intensity.The SFQ is a valid and reliable eight-item index of surgical fear consisting of two subscales: fear of the short-term consequences of surgery and fear of the long-term consequences."
https://openalex.org/W2061148406,"The very large G protein-coupled receptor 1 (VLGR1) is a core component in inner ear hair cell development. Mutations in the vlgr1 gene cause Usher syndrome, the symptoms of which include congenital hearing loss and progressive retinitis pigmentosa. However, the mechanism of VLGR1-regulated intracellular signaling and its role in Usher syndrome remain elusive. Here, we show that VLGR1 is processed into two fragments after autocleavage at the G protein-coupled receptor proteolytic site. The cleaved VLGR1 β-subunit constitutively inhibited adenylate cyclase (AC) activity through Gαi coupling. Co-expression of the Gαiq chimera with the VLGR1 β-subunit changed its activity to the phospholipase C/nuclear factor of activated T cells signaling pathway, which demonstrates the Gαi protein coupling specificity of this subunit. An R6002A mutation in intracellular loop 2 of VLGR1 abolished Gαi coupling, but the pathogenic VLGR1 Y6236fsx1 mutant showed increased AC inhibition. Furthermore, overexpression of another Usher syndrome protein, PDZD7, decreased the AC inhibition of the VLGR1 β-subunit but showed no effect on the VLGR1 Y6236fsx1 mutant. Taken together, we identified an independent Gαi signaling pathway of the VLGR1 β-subunit and its regulatory mechanisms that may have a role in the development of Usher syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W1995032110,"Induction of metallothionein (MT) expression is involved in metal homeostasis and detoxification. To identify the key pathways that regulate metal-induced cytotoxicity, we investigate how phosphorylated metal-responsive transcription factor-1 (MTF-1) contributed to induction of MT expression. Immortal human embryonic kidney cells (HEK cells) were treated with seven kinds of metals including cadmium chloride (CdCl2), zinc sulfate (ZnSO4), copper sulfate(CuSO4), lead acetate (PbAc), nickel sulfate (NiSO4), sodium arsenite (NaAsO2), and potassium bichromate (K2Cr2O7). The MT expression was induced in a dose-response and time-dependent manner upon various metal treatments. A cycle of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation was required for translocation of MTF-1 from cytoplasm to nucleus, leading to the up-regulation of MTs expression. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) participated in regulating MT expression through dephosphorylation of MTF-1. A loss-of-function screen revealed that the specific PP2A complexes containing PR110 were involved in metal-induced MT expression. Suppression of PP2A PR110 in HEK cells resulted in the persistent MTF-1 phosphorylation and the disturbance of MTF-1 nuclear translocation, which was concomitant with a significant decrease of MT expression and enhanced cytotoxicity in HEK cells. Notably, MTF-1 was found in complex with specific PP2A complexes containing the PR110 subunit upon metal exposure. Furthermore, we identify that the dephosphorylation of MTF-1 at residue Thr-254 is directly regulated by PP2A PR110 complexes and responsible for MTF-1 activation. Taken together, these findings delineate a novel pathway that determines cytotoxicity in response to metal treatments and provide new insight into the role of PP2A in cellular stress response."

These proteins are located in the plasma membrane and the membranes of intracellular organelles where they transport a variety of solutes across cell membranes. Among these, the SLC17 family mediates activities requiring transmembrane transport of organic anions, including urate secretion (SLC17A1 and SLC17A3), lysosomal export of sialic acid (SLC17A5), and vesicular accumulation of aspartate (SLC17A5) and glutamate (SLC17A5–8).

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying lysosomal ATP accumulation have not been identified. Because cells contain high (millimolar) levels of ATP in the cytosol, one mechanism could be that lysosomes take up ATP from the cytosol through an ATP transporter located in the lysosomal membrane.

Because SLC17A9 has been shown to transport ATP in intracellular secretory vesicles, we hypothesized that it could also function in lysosomal ATP transport. Here we report that SLC17A9 is highly enriched in lysosomes and actively transports ATP into lysosomes.

Our data suggest a molecular mechanism for lysosomal ATP accumulation and a role for lysosomal ATP in cell viability. COS1, HEK293T, and C2C12 cells were obtained from the ATCC and maintained in DMEM:nutrient mixture F-12 (F12) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Cells were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. For some experiments, cells were seeded on 0.01% poly-lysine-coated coverslips and cultured 24 h before further experiments. COS1 and HEK293T cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000. C2C12 cells were transfected by electroporation with the Neon® transfection system (Invitrogen) following the optimized protocol of the manufacturer (1650 V, 30 ms, 3 pulses). An ∼80% transfection efficiency was achieved regularly. The following primary antibodies were used for immunofluorescence staining and Western blotting: anti-SLC17A9 (MBL Co., Ltd., Nagoya, Japan), anti-Lamp1 (1D4B and H4A3, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), anti-annexin V (Abcam), anti-GM130 (Abcam), anti-EEA1 (Abcam), anti-complex II (Invitrogen), and anti-GAPDH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit antibody, Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rat antibody, fluorescein goat anti-mouse antibody, and Texas Red goat anti-mouse antibody were from Invitrogen. LysoTracker DND-99 Red (Invitrogen, 50 nm) and Texas Red 10 kDa Dextran (Invitrogen, 1 mg/ml) were used to label lysosomes. DQ-BSA (Invitrogen, 10 μg/ml) was used to assess lysosome function. The following chemicals were also used: GPN (200 μm, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), carbenoxolone (CBX, 20 μm, Sigma), niflumic acid (NFA, 20 μm, Tocris Bioscience), 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (DIDS, 5 or 20 μm, Tocris Bioscience), and Evans blue (20 μm, Sigma). Cells grown on coverslips were washed with PBS twice and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min and then blocked with 3% BSA in PBS for 60 min at room temperature. After three PBS washes, cells were incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight. After three more PBS washes, cells were incubated with fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies for 45 min at room temperature in the dark. Images were acquired using a confocal microscope (LSM510, Zeiss) with a ×63 oil immersion objective lens and captured using ZEN2009 software (Zeiss). Confocal fluorescent images were taken using an inverted Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope with ×10 plain or ×63 oil immersion objectives. Sequential excitation wavelengths at 488 nm and 543 nm were provided by argon and helium-neon gas lasers, respectively. BP500–550 and LP560 emission filters were used to collect green and red images in channels 1 and 2, respectively, and then images of the same cell were saved and analyzed with ZEN software. Here the term colocalization refers to the coincident detection of an above-background green and red fluorescent signal. Image size was set at 1024 × 1024 pixels. Total RNA was isolated from cells harvested in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using the Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus reverse transcriptional system (Invitrogen). Sequences encoding SLC17A9 were PCR-amplified by Pfu DNA polymerase (Agilent) from cDNA derived from C2C12 cells and cloned into the pEGFP-N1 vector (Invitrogen). Primers used were SLC17A9 forward (5′-TGCTCGAGCCATGCCATCCCAGCGCTC-3′) and SLC17A9 reverse (5′-GTGGATCCTCGAG GTCCTCATGAGTGG-3′). For knockdown studies, we constructed the plasmid pSUPER-SLC17A9. To do so, the pSUPER plasmid (Ambion, Austin, TX) was linearized using BglII and HindIII to facilitate directional cloning.

Briefly, cell lysates were obtained by Dounce homogenization in a homogenizing buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.0)) and then centrifuged at 1500 × g (4200 rpm) (Fisher, ST-16R, F15 rotor) at 4 °C for 10 min to remove nuclei and intact cells. Postnuclear supernatants were then fractionated on a Percoll density gradient using a Beckman Optima l-90K ultracentrifuge. For that analysis, the ultracentrifuge tube was layered with 2.5 m sucrose (bottom), 18% Percoll in homogenizing buffer (middle), and sample (top). Samples were centrifuged at 90,000 × g (31,300 rpm) at 4 °C for 1 h using a Beckman Coulter 70.1 Ti rotor to obtain light, medium, and heavy membrane fractions. Heavy membrane fractions containing cellular organelles were further layered over a discontinuous iodixanol (v/v; 27, 22.5, 19, 16, 12, and 8%) gradient generated by mixing iodixanol in homogenizing buffer with 2.5 m glucose. The osmolarity of all solutions was 300 mosmol. After centrifugation at 4 °C for 2.5 h at 180,000 × g (44,200 rpm), the sample was divided into 12 fractions (0.5 ml each) for further analyses. The biological properties and ionic composition of lysosomes were largely maintained during this procedure because of slowed transport across lysosomal membranes occurring at 4 °C. Proteins were analyzed using standard methods. Proteins derived from whole cells or lysosome lysates were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then transferred onto PVDF membranes using a semidry transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad). Nonspecific binding was blocked using 5% skim milk in TBS-T (0.1% Tween 20 in 1× Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4)) for 2 h at room temperature. Membranes were then incubated with specific primary antibody solution at 4 °C overnight with gentle constant shaking. After three thorough TBS-T washes, the membranes were incubated with corresponding HRP-conjugated second antibody at room temperature for 1 h. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using Clear ECL (Bio-Rad) and autoradiography. Cells were pretreated with various transporter inhibitors (CBX, 20 μm; NFA, 20 μm; DIDS or Evans Blue, 5 μm or 20 μm, respectively) for 3 h and then incubated with quinacrine (5 μm) together with LysoTracker Red DND-99 (50 nm) for 30 min at 37 °C and chased for 1 h. Images were acquired using a confocal microscope (Zeiss) with a ×63 oil immersion objective and then collected and analyzed using ZEN2009 (Zeiss). A low laser power (< 0.5%) was used to minimize fluorescence bleaching. The ATP content of the culture medium or buffer containing freshly isolated lysosomes was measured in triplicate with a microplate luminometer (Fluoroskan Ascent FL microplate fluorometer and luminometer, Thermo Scientific) using the adenosine 5′-triphosphate bioluminescent assay kit (FLAA, Sigma) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. A standard curve was established for each measurement. Samples were adjusted to pH 7.8 to establish conditions optimal to detect ATP. All samples were kept on ice before measurement. Briefly, 100 μl of the ATP assay mix solution was added to the assay tube and allowed to stand at room temperature for 3 min to hydrolyze endogenous ATP. Then, 100 μl of the sample was added rapidly, mixed gently, and then the plate was read immediately using a luminometer. Blank medium or buffer samples were read in parallel as background, which was subtracted from sample readings. For some experiments, freshly isolated lysosome (1.Hediger M.A. Clémençon B.

Samples containing same amount of protein were loaded for the ATP assay (75 μg protein/well). For ATP uptake assays, 0.2 μl of 2 mm ATP was added to 100 μl of samples (containing 75 μg of total protein) for an initial ATP concentration of 2 × 10−6 m. Samples luminescence was read over time, and the luminescence decay indicated active ATP uptake. Sample buffer served as a blank, and the decay of intrinsic luminescence was measured as background. In some experiments, freshly isolated lysosomes from cells pretreated with the inhibitors described above for 30 min at 37 °C were assayed immediately assayed for ATP uptake in the presence of those inhibitors. At the end of the assay, 0.1% TritonX100 was added to each sample to measure the total ATP released from vesicles. Briefly, cells were transfected with the indicated DNA using Lipofectamine 2000 or electroporation. Cells were pretreated overnight with the inhibitors described above. Cells were stained with propidium iodide (Sigma, P-4170) (10 μg/ml) and incubated at room temperature in PBS for 15 min. Cells were then examined immediately by fluorescence microscopy (emission at 615 nm and excitation at 488 nm). For quantitative analysis, adherent cells were collected by trypsinization, and PI+ and GFP+ cells and GFP+/PI+ cells were counted using a hemocytometer under an upright fluorescent microscope. For some assays, lactate dehydrogenase activity was determined by measuring NADH oxidation with pyruvate as substrate. For each assay, a 50-μl sample was incubated with 50 μl of reaction buffer (CytoTox-ONETM homogeneous membrane integrity assay, Promega) for 10 min at 22 °C, and the fluorescence at 340 nm was measured using a spectrophotometer. Results were scaled to the complete cell death induced by exposure to 1% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 20 min. The percent of cell death was defined as 100 × (sample optical density− medium optical density)/(Triton X-100 optical density− medium optical density). Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were made using analysis of variance and Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. To directly measure ATP transport across the lysosomal membrane, we isolated lysosomes from HEK cells using density gradient centrifugation and assayed ATP uptake. We monitored ATP transport by evaluating ATP concentrations in the buffer using a bioluminescent ATP assay (9.Haanes K.A. Novak I. ATP storage and uptake by isolated pancreatic zymogen granules.Biochem. J. 2010; 429: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A decrease of ATP concentration in the buffer suggested ATP uptake by lysosomes. We compared the luminescence decay over time following the repeated addition of ATP (2 μm) to lysosomes. As shown in Fig. 1A, control samples not treated with inhibitors showed ATP decrease rates of 12.26 ± 0.07%/min after the first ATP addition (11–19 min). Interestingly, that rate slowed to 5.00 ± 0.46%/min when lysosomes were pretreated with DIDS (20 μm) or Evans blue (20 μm), two known inhibitors of mammalian VNUT (3.Sawada K. Echigo N. Juge N. Miyaji T. Otsuka M. Omote H. Yamamoto A. Moriyama Y. Identification of a vesicular nucleotide transporter.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 5683-5686Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), for 30 min, and ATP was added in the presence of the inhibitors. In contrast, treatment of samples with CBX (20 μm) or NFA (20 μm), two inhibitors targeting both connexin and pannexin channels (11.Harris A. Locke D. Pannexins or connexins?.in: Dahl G. Harris A.L. Connexins: a guide. Humana Press, Clifton, NJ2009: P287-P301Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar), had no effect. For comparison, buffer ATP concentration 19 min after the first ATP application and 29 min after the second were replotted in Fig. 1B. Treatment with DIDS or Evans blue but not CBX or NFA significantly reduced ATP uptake. Buffers of DIDS and Evans blue-treated groups contained 1.36 ± 0.08 μm and 1.61 ± 0.12 μm ATP, respectively, at the 19-min time point after the first ATP addition, whereas the buffer of the non-treated group contained only 0.04 ± 0.01 μm ATP in the buffer (Fig. 1B). Consistent with the data from HEK cells, we also detected inhibition of ATP transport by DIDS, but not CBX, in lysosomes prepared from C2C12 cells (Fig. 4, E–G). Taken together, these data suggest the presence of a VNUT-like transporter in the lysosomes. Loss of luminescence could be caused by ATP breakdown. To exclude this possibility, isolated lysosomes were treated with GPN (200 μm), a substrate of the lysosomal exopeptidase cathepsin C. GPN induces lysosome osmodialysis (6.Zhang Z. Chen G. Zhou W. Song A. Xu T. Luo Q. Wang W. Gu X.S. Duan S. Regulated ATP release from astrocytes through lysosome exocytosis.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 945-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) and promotes the release of lysosomal ATP. After the addition of 2 μm ATP, we observed no significant luminescence decay in the GPN-treated group or the buffer control group. In contrast, non-treated lysosomes showed a dramatic loss of luminescence (Fig. 1C), suggesting that decreased luminescence was due to ATP uptake by lysosomes rather than ATP hydrolysis. If ATP accumulation is mediated by an ATP transporter, blocking that transporter should antagonize ATP deposition in lysosomes. To test this hypothesis, COS1 cells were treated with DIDS, Evans blue, CBX, or NFA, and ATP deposition was evaluated by the accumulation of quinacrine, a fluorescent dye used to locate intracellular ATP stores (6.Zhang Z.

As shown in Fig. 2A, quinacrine-labeled COS1 cells displayed a punctate granular pattern consistent with a vesicular origin, and puncta colocalized with LysoTracker and Lamp1staining (Fig. 5A), suggesting ATP accumulation in lysosomes. DIDS (20 μm) or Evans blue (20 μm) treatment significantly decreased quinacrine fluorescence (Fig. 2, A and B) by 84.71 ± 3.01 and 84.45 ± 7.25%, respectively. By contrast, treatment with CBX (20 μm) or NFA (20 μm) had no effect.FIGURE 5.SLC17A9 mediates lysosomal ATP accumulation. A and B, mSLC17A9 overexpression increases lysosomal ATP accumulation, whereas mSLC17A9 knockdown has the opposite effect. Lysosomal ATP levels were monitored using quinacrine (10 μm) staining. Lamp1-mCherry served as a lysosome marker. Values were normalized to non-treated control cells. The experiment was repeated three times, and representative images are shown. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; NS, no significance. C, SLC17A9 knockdown has no effect on LysoTracker staining.

The experiment was repeated three times in triplicate. **, p < 0.01.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Lysosomal ATP levels were further measured by a bioluminescence assay using purified lysosomes from COS1 cells. High ATP concentrations in lysosome fractions, which were positive for the lysosome marker Lamp1, and in mitochondrial fractions, which were positive for the mitochondrial marker complex II, were detectable only after 5 min of treatment with 1% Triton X-100, indicating that ATP was contained within membrane-enclosed compartments (Fig. 2, C and D). Treatment of GPN (200 μm for 30 min) selectively increased the ATP levels in the lysosomal fractions but not mitochondrial fractions, suggesting a high lysosomal ATP concentration. Lysosomal ATP content (defined by the concentration of ATP released following GPN treatment) decreased remarkably from 15.15 ± 3.9 μm to 1.64 ± 0.89 μm or 2.62 ± 1.23 μm following treatment with DIDS or Evans blue, respectively (Fig. 2C), whereas CBX or NFA treatment (Fig. 2D) had no effect on comparable samples. Taken together, these data suggest that a VNUT-like transporter may mediate lysosomal ATP accumulation. They also suggest that DIDS and Evans blue slowly penetrate the cell membrane, although the mechanism remains unclear. SLC17A9 reportedly localizes in secretory vesicles/granules (3.Sawada K. Echigo N. Juge N. Miyaji T. Otsuka M. Omote H. Yamamoto A. Moriyama Y. Identification of a vesicular nucleotide transporter.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Our pharmacology data obtained using isolated lysosomes suggest that lysosomal membranes contain substantial amounts of SLC17A9 protein. To confirm this observation, lysosomal fractions of COS1 cells or COS1 cells expressing mSLC17A9-GFP (mouse SLC17A9-GFP) were enriched using density gradient centrifugation, lysed, and then incubated with anti-SLC17A9 antibody. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, both endogenous SLC17A9 and mSLC17A9-GFP were distributed to the Lamp1-positive fraction. To further assess SLC17A9 subcellular localization, COS1 cells were transfected with Lamp1-GFP and then assessed with an SLC17A9 antibody. A large proportion of SLC17A9-positive puncta were also Lamp1-GFP-positive (Fig. 3C), suggesting that endogenous SLC17A9 is enriched in lysosomes. To evaluate the localization of exogenous SLC17A9, COS1 cells were transfected with mSLC17A9-GFP and labeled with LysoTracker or cotransfected with mSLC17A9-mCherry and Lamp1-GFP. Confocal imaging indicated a large proportion of exogenous mSLC17A9-GFP fluorescence in LysoTracker- or Lamp1-GFP-positive organelles (Fig. 3, D and E). Overall, our data suggest that both endogenous and heterologously expressed SLC17A9 is enriched in lysosomes. To test whether SLC17A9 is required for lysosomal ATP transport, C2C12 cells (a mouse cell line) were transfected with mSLC17A9-shRNA and then assayed for ATP transport. SLC17A9 expression levels in either C2C12 whole cell lysate (Fig. 4A) or lysosome lysate (Fig. 4B) from C2C12 culture were suppressed dramatically by mSLC17A9-shRNA expression. SLC17A9 silencing significantly decreased ATP transport in lysosomes isolated from C2C12 cells (Fig. 4, C and D). Although the initial ATP concentrations in buffer were comparable (∼2 μm), by 21 min, ATP concentrations decreased to 0.14 ± 0.03 μm or 1.49 ± 0.23 μm in cells expressing scramble control shRNA or mSLC17A9-shRNA, respectively (Fig. 4D). Conversely, mSLC17A9-GFP overexpression dramatically increased lysosomal ATP uptake (Fig. 4, E and F). ATP concentrations in the buffer decreased to 0.023 ± 0.001 μm and 0.010 ± 0.001 μm in WT cells and cells expressing mSLC17A9-GFP, respectively, by 19 min after the first ATP addition, although initial ATP levels were comparable (∼2.0 μm) (Fig. 4, E and F). As in WT cells, DIDS treatment inhibited ATP transport in cells expressing mSLC17A9-GFP. However, in mSLC17A9-GFP-expressing cells, a higher concentration (20 μm) of DIDS was required to suppress ATP transport to the same level as 5 μm DIDS did in WT cells. In contrast, 20 μm CBX (Fig. 4, G and H) did not inhibit ATP transport. Our data suggest that SLC17A9 is both sufficient and required for ATP transport across lysosomal membranes. To investigate SLC17A9 function in lysosomal ATP accumulation, quinacrine fluorescence was compared in C2C12 cells expressing Lamp1-mCherry or mSLC17A9-mCherry with or without mSLC17A9-shRNA. Robust quinacrine staining was observed in cells expressing Lamp1-mCherry, in cells expressing mSLC17A9-mCherry, and in cells expressing scrambled control shRNA and Lamp1-mCherry. However, cells expressing mSLC17A9-shRNA displayed little quinacrine staining (Fig. 5A). Relative to controls, the quinacrine intensity increased by 65.8% in SLC17A9-overexpressing cells but decreased by 84.2"
https://openalex.org/W2060915465,"Background People with chronic non-communicable diseases (NCD) are particularly vulnerable to socioeconomic inequality due to their long-term expensive health needs. This study aimed to assess socioeconomic-related inequality in health service utilization among NCD patients in China and to analyze factors associated with this disparity. Methods Data were taken from the 2008 Chinese National Health Survey, in which a multiple stage stratified random sampling method was employed to survey 56,456 households. We analyzed the distribution of actual use, need-expected use, and need-standardized usage of outpatient services (over a two-week period) and inpatient services (over one-year) across different income groups in 27,233 adult respondents who reported as having a NCD. We used a concentration index to measure inequality in the distribution of health services, which was expressed as HI (Horizontal Inequity Index) for need-standardized use of services. A non-linear probit regression model was employed to detect inequality across socio-economic groups. Results Pro-rich inequity in health services among NCD patients was more substantial than the average population. A higher degree of pro-rich inequity (HI = 0.253) was found in inpatient services compared to outpatient services (HI = 0.089). Despite a greater need for health services amongst those of lower socio-economic status, their actual use is much less than their more affluent counterparts. Health service underuse by the poor and overuse by the affluent are evident. Household income disparity was the greatest inequality factor in NCD service use for both outpatients (71.3%) and inpatients (108%), more so than health insurance policies. Some medical insurance schemes, such as the MIUE, actually made a pro-rich contribution to health service inequality (16.1% for outpatient and 12.1% for inpatient). Conclusions Inequality in health services amongst NCD patients in China remains largely determined by patient financial capability. The current insurance schemes are insufficient to address this inequity. A comprehensive social policy that encompasses a more progressive taxation package and redistribution of social capital as well as pro-poor welfare is needed."

However, controversies exist regarding the receptor pharmacological profile, effector coupling, and subcellular localization. We addressed the role of the type I PDZ motif at the receptor C terminus in receptor trafficking and coupling to cAMP production in HEK293 cells and CHO cells ectopically expressing the receptor and in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells expressing the native receptor. GPR30 was localized both intracellularly and in the plasma membrane and subject to limited basal endocytosis. E2 and G-1, reported GPR30 agonists, neither stimulated nor inhibited cAMP production through GPR30, nor did they influence receptor localization. Instead, GPR30 constitutively inhibited cAMP production stimulated by a heterologous agonist independently of Gi/o. Moreover, siRNA knockdown of native GPR30 increased cAMP production. Deletion of the receptor PDZ motif interfered with inhibition of cAMP production and increased basal receptor endocytosis. GPR30 interacted with membrane-associated guanylate kinases, including SAP97 and PSD-95, and protein kinase A-anchoring protein (AKAP) 5 in the plasma membrane in a PDZ-dependent manner. Knockdown of AKAP5 or St-Ht31 treatment, to disrupt AKAP interaction with the PKA RIIβ regulatory subunit, decreased inhibition of cAMP production, and St-Ht31 increased basal receptor endocytosis. Therefore, GPR30 forms a plasma membrane complex with a membrane-associated guanylate kinase and AKAP5, which constitutively attenuates cAMP production in response to heterologous agonists independently of Gi/o and retains receptors in the plasma membrane.

We aimed to describe risk behaviors and vulnerability among MSM in Abidjan, Cote d′Ivoire. We conducted a cross-sectional respondent-driven sampling survey with 601 MSM in 2011–2012. Sociodemographic and behavioural data as well as data related to emotional state and stigma were collected. Population estimates with 95% confidence intervals were produced. Survey weighted logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with inconsistent condom use in the prior 12 months. Most MSM were 24 years of age or younger (63.9%) and had attained at least primary education (84.4%). HIV risk behaviors such as low condom and water-based lubricant use, high numbers of male and female sex partners, and sex work were frequently reported as well as verbal, physical and sexual abuse. Inconsistent condom use during anal sex with a male partner in the prior 12 months was reported by 66.0% of the MSM and was positively associated with history of forced sex, alcohol consumption, having a regular partner and a casual partner, having bought sex, and self-perception of low HIV risk. MSM in Abidjan exhibit multiple and frequent HIV-related risk behaviors. To address those behaviours, a combination of individual but also structural interventions will be needed given the context of stigma, homophobia and violence."
https://openalex.org/W2014240063,"The membrane-anchored serine proteases, matriptase and prostasin, and the membrane-anchored serine protease inhibitors, hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor (HAI)-1 and HAI-2, are critical effectors of epithelial development and postnatal epithelial homeostasis. Matriptase and prostasin form a reciprocal zymogen activation complex that results in the formation of active matriptase and prostasin that are targets for inhibition by HAI-1 and HAI-2. Conflicting data, however, have accumulated as to the existence of auxiliary functions for both HAI-1 and HAI-2 in regulating the intracellular trafficking and activation of matriptase. In this study, we, therefore, used genetically engineered mice to determine the effect of ablation of endogenous HAI-1 and endogenous HAI-2 on endogenous matriptase expression, subcellular localization, and activation in polarized intestinal epithelial cells. Whereas ablation of HAI-1 did not affect matriptase in epithelial cells of the small or large intestine, ablation of HAI-2 resulted in the loss of matriptase from both tissues. Gene silencing studies in intestinal Caco-2 cell monolayers revealed that this loss of cell-associated matriptase was mechanistically linked to accelerated activation and shedding of the protease caused by loss of prostasin regulation by HAI-2. Taken together, these data indicate that HAI-1 regulates the activity of activated matriptase, whereas HAI-2 has an essential role in regulating prostasin-dependent matriptase zymogen activation."
https://openalex.org/W2068534400,"Thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) is an essential enzyme playing multiple roles in base excision repair, transcription regulation, and DNA demethylation. TDG mediates the cytotoxicity of the anti-cancer chemotherapeutic drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) by prolonging S phase, generating DNA strand breaks, and inducing DNA damage signaling. During S phase of the cell cycle, TDG is degraded via the proteasomal pathway. Here we show that CRL4Cdt2 E3 ubiquitin ligase promotes ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of TDG in S phase in a reaction that is dependent on the interaction of TDG with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). siRNA-mediated depletion of PCNA or components of CRL4Cdt2, specifically cullin4A/B or substrate adaptor Cdt2, stabilizes TDG in human cells. Mutations in the PCNA-interacting peptide (PIP) motif of TDG that disrupt the interaction of TDG with PCNA or change critical basic residues essential for the action of the PIP degron prevent the ubiquitination and degradation of TDG. Thus physical interaction of TDG with PCNA through the PIP degron is required for targeting TDG to the CRL4Cdt2 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Compared with forced expression of wild type TDG, CRL4Cdt2- resistant TDG (ΔPIP) slows cell proliferation and slightly increases the toxicity of 5-FU. Thus, CRL4Cdt2-dependent degradation of TDG occurs in S phase because of the requirement for TDG to interact with chromatin-loaded PCNA, and this degradation is important for preventing toxicity from excess TDG.

Like other uracil DNA glycosylases, TDG has a broad range of substrate specificity and actively processes DNA lesions arising from oxidation, alkylation, and deamination of cytosine, 5-methyl-cytosine, and thymine. Although TDG is known to remove T from G-T lesions, it removes U from G-U lesions more efficiently (3.Hardeland U. Bentele M. Lettieri T. Steinacher R. Jiricny J. Schar P. Thymine DNA glycosylase.Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 68: 235-253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike other glycosylases, TDG remains tightly bound to the abasic site left after removal of the mismatched base. The dissociation of TDG from its bound abasic site is the rate-limiting step of the glycosylase reaction. The SUMOylation at lysine 330 (by SUMO-1 or SUMO-2/3) and/or direct interaction with APE1 endonuclease increases the dissociation rate of TDG from AP sites, giving the downstream enzymes access to the lesion (5.Hardeland U.

TDG specifically recognizes 5-formylcytosine and 5-carboxylcytosine paired with a G residue to excise the modified cytosine residue from DNA, leaving an abasic site. APE1 excises the abasic residue to allow a DNA polymerase to insert a cytosine across from the G and thus complete the demethylation of methylcytosine.

Cullin ring finger ligase (CRL) ubiquitin ligases are a large family of enzymes based on one of seven cullins (Cul1, Cul2, Cul3, Cul4A, Cul4B, Cul5, and Cul7). The C-terminal “cullin homology domain” of the cullin associates with a ring finger protein that helps recruit an E2, whereas the N-terminal domain of the Cullin interacts through a bridge protein to a substrate-adaptor protein that recruits substrates to the cullin (15.Petroski M.D. Deshaies R.J. Function and regulation of cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar). In CRL4 ubiquitin ligases, Cul4A or -B associates with RBX1 through the cullin homology domain and with DDB1 at the other end. The DDB1 protein interacts with a large family of DDB1-cullin-associated factors (DCAFs) that directly bind to substrates (16.Jackson S. Xiong Y. CRL4s: the CUL4-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2009; 34: 562-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The CRL4Cdt2 ubiquitin ligase uses Cdt2 as the DCAF and has been implicated in the polyubiquitination and degradation of several substrates involved in S phase regulation, in a reaction that is dependent on PCNA (17.Arias E.E.

Cell. 2009; 35: 93-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The conventional PIP motif is present on many proteins that interact with PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen), and such interaction does not usually lead to recognition of the substrate by CRL4Cdt2. The PIP degron is a specialized PIP motif that usually has a Thr and Asp at positions 5 and 6 of the PIP motif, which increases interaction with PCNA, and a positively charged amino acid 4 amino acids downstream of the PIP box (position +4) that is not essential for interaction with PCNA but important for recognition by CRL4Cdt2. The PIP degron on a substrate protein is essential for the binding of the substrate to chromatin-bound PCNA and its recognition by CRL4Cdt2 for polyubiquitination on the way to degradation of the substrate by the proteasome. The expression of TDG is tightly regulated during the cell cycle. In human cells, TDG accumulates during G2-M and G1 phases and is degraded during S phase by proteasomes (29.Hardeland U. Kunz C. Focke F. Szadkowski M. Schär P. Cell cycle regulation as a mechanism for functional separation of the apparently redundant uracil DNA glycosylases TDG and UNG2.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 3859-3867Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that the CRL4Cdt2 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex ubiquitinates and degrades TDG in a PCNA- and PIP degron-dependent manner. Because the association of PCNA with chromatin increases in S phase, the requirement that the substrate interact with PCNA before recognition by CRL4Cdt2 makes this an S phase-specific pathway of protein degradation. We show that physical interaction of TDG with PCNA, and the substrate specificity factor Cdt2, are necessary for CRL4Cdt2 to ubiquitinate and target TDG for degradation. An excess of wild type TDG slows down cell proliferation, as does CRL4Cdt2-resistant TDG(ΔPIP), indicating that the active degradation of TDG by this pathway is critical for keeping cellular levels of the protein below toxic levels. Human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells and human embryonic kidney 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. To generate constitutive TDG-expressing vector, TDG cDNA was cloned into pMSCV-FLAG or pFEM vector. Doxycycline-inducible TDG-expressing lentiviral vector was generated by inserting TDG cDNA into FUW-tetO vector. To construct the bacterial TDG expression vector, TDG cDNA was cloned into pGEX vector. All of the constructs were generated using In-Fusion HD Plus (Clontech). TDG(ΔPIP) and TDG(ΔKR) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. siRNA transfection was performed using Lipofectamine-RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. siRNA targeting sequences are siGL2 against luciferase (CGTACGCGGAATACTTCGA), siCdt2 (GAATTATACTGCTTATCGA), siPCNA (GATCGAGGATGAAGAAGGA), siCul4A (GACAATCCGAATCAGTACC), and siCul4B (AGATAAGGTTGACCATATA). MG132 was purchased from Boston Biochem. MLN4924 was provided by Millennium Pharmaceuticals. The remaining reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. For immunoprecipitations, cells were treated with 2 mm HU for 12 h and then with HU and 40 μm MG132 for an additional 6 h before lysing in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH8.0), 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, protease inhibitors) by incubating on ice for 30 min followed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant recovered was immunoprecipitated with antibodies against PCNA or FLAG. Bound proteins were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with specific antibodies. For Western blotting, cells were lysed in IPH buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, protease inhibitor) at 4 °C for 30 min, and lysates were cleared by centrifugation or directly lysed in SDS sample buffer. Antibodies against TDG (Proteintech), FLAG (Sigma-Aldrich), β-actin, tubulin, HSP90, PCNA, Cul4, and GST (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) were purchased. Antibodies against Cdt2, Myc (9E10), and HA (12CA5) have been described previously (22.Abbas T. Sivaprasad U. Terai K. Amador V. Pagano M. Dutta A. PCNA-dependent regulation of p21 ubiquitylation and degradation via the CRL4Cdt2 ubiquitin ligase complex.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 2496-2506Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). For the in vivo ubiquitination assay, 293T cells transiently transfected with HA-ubiquitin and Myc-TDG, with or without FLAG-Cdt2, were treated with 40 μm MG132 for 1 h before harvest. Cells were harvested in denaturing ubiquitination buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 5 mm DTT, and 1% SDS) and immediately boiled for 10 min at 95 °C, followed by cooling on ice for 10 min. The lysates were sonicated, and supernatants were recovered after centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatants were diluted with 9 volumes of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.4% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors, and Myc-TDG was immunoprecipitated by anti-Myc antibodies. Ubiquitinated TDG protein in the immunoprecipitate was detected by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody (30.Dar A. Shibata E. Dutta A.

In vitro ubiquitination of TDG was conducted as described previously (22.Abbas T. Sivaprasad U. Terai K. Amador V. Pagano M. Dutta A. PCNA-dependent regulation of p21 ubiquitylation and degradation via the CRL4Cdt2 ubiquitin ligase complex.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 2496-2506Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) with a minor modification. 293T cells were transiently transfected with Myc-TDG-expressing plasmid. Immunoprecipitate with anti-Myc antibody was eluted with Myc peptide and used as a substrate for the assay. GST, GST-TDG(WT), GST-TDG(ΔPIP), and GST-TDG(ΔKR) were purified from Escherichia coli under native conditions. The pull-down assay was carried out by incubating glutathione beads coupled with GST or GST-TDG proteins with recombinant, bacterially produced PCNA in pull-down buffer (25 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 5% glycerol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitors) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with wash buffer (25 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% Nonidet P-40) and boiled in 2× SDS sample buffer. The samples were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-GST and anti-PCNA antibodies. Cells were seeded at a density of 1000/well in 96-well plates. The MTT assay was performed with CellTiter 96® Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instruction. For PCNA and TDG staining, HeLa cells were fixed with ice cold methanol for 5 min. Cells were then stained as described previously (19.Abbas T. Shibata E. Park J. Jha S. Karnani N. Dutta A. CRL4Cdt2 regulates cell proliferation and histone gene expression by targeting PR-Set7/Set8 for degradation.Mol. Cell. 2010; 40: 9-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Cells were trypsinized and fixed with 70% ethanol. Fixed cells were stained with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide and 50 μg/ml RNase A in PBS and analyzed by FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). The graphs in Fig. 4C show the change in S phase after expression of the indicated forms of TDG, relative to the same cells where TDG was not induced by doxycycline: ((percentage of cells in S phase in doxycycline − percentage of cells in S phase in the absence of doxycycline)/percentage of cells in S phase in the absence of doxycycline) × 100%. The alkaline comet assay was performed with CometAssay (Trevigen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The captured images were analyzed by OpenComet and ImageJ software. Treating HeLa cells with MG132 or MLN4924 to block proteasomal or cullin ubiquitin ligase activities, respectively, increased basal TDG protein levels (Fig. 1A). MLN4924 is an inhibitor of Nedd8-activating enzyme and inhibits the action of all cullins by preventing their neddylation (31.Soucy T.A. Smith P.G. Milhollen M.A. Berger A.J. Gavin J.M. Adhikari S.

An inhibitor of NEDD8-activating enzyme as a new approach to treat cancer.Nature. 2009; 458: 732-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1351) Google Scholar). We confirmed by immunofluorescence that the amount of TDG protein is selectively diminished in S phase cells that can be distinguished by the appearance of foci of PCNA in the nucleus (Fig. 1B, top). Treating cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 results in the accumulation of TDG in the cells containing S phase-specific PCNA foci (Fig. 1B, bottom). This suggested that cullin-mediated ubiquitylation and proteasomes are involved in the degradation of TDG in S phase. A consensus PIP degron (from amino acid 95 to 106) was identified in TDG (GenBankTM, NP003202.3) using ClustalW analysis (Fig. 1C). Besides the residues typical of all PIP motifs, the sequence had the characteristic TD and basic residue that marks PIP degrons and is present on several targets of CRL4Cdt2. To investigate whether TDG physically interacted with PCNA, we treated cells with MG132 to prevent the degradation of any TDG and immunoprecipitated PCNA. Immunoprecipitating endogenous PCNA co-precipitated endogenous TDG from these lysates (Fig. 1D). To confirm the role of the PIP degron in mediating the interaction of TDG with PCNA, we made point mutations in the PIP degron (Fig. 1C) of GST-tagged recombinant TDG protein (Fig. 1E) for in vitro pull-down assays. Upon incubation with purified recombinant PCNA, GST-TDG(WT) pulled down PCNA, whereas mutations in the PIP box (TDG(ΔPIP)) disrupted the interaction (Fig. 1F). Mutations in the KR amino acids in the PIP degron (TDG(ΔKR)) did not affect the interaction of TDG with PCNA (Fig. 1F), consistent with the previous observation that these residues are not essential for stable interaction with PCNA, although they are essential for degradation. To investigate the role of the PIP degron in TDG degradation, we compared the half-life of exogenously expressed TDG(WT), TDG(ΔPIP), and TDG(ΔKR) after blocking new protein synthesis with cycloheximide. The PIP degron mutants, TDG(ΔPIP) or TDG(ΔKR) are more stable than TDG(WT) (Fig. 1G). These results demonstrate that association of TDG with PCNA through the PIP degron is important for the turnover of TDG in cells. To elucidate whether the PIP degron of TDG is needed for its destruction during S phase, cells expressing wild type FLAG-TDG(WT) or PIP degron mutants, FLAG-TDG(ΔPIP) and FLAG-TDG(ΔKR), were treated with HU to arrest cells in S phase. Compared with wild type TDG, which was decreased in HU, the PIP degron mutants were not decreased in HU-arrested cells (Fig. 2A). CRL4Cdt2 is known to degrade its substrates during S phase of the cell cycle in cooperation with PCNA (19.Abbas T. Shibata E. Park J. Jha S. Karnani N. Dutta A.

Snail family zinc finger 1, dysregulated in many neoplasms, has been reported to be involved in gliomas. However, the biological mechanisms underlying SNAI1 function in gliomas need further investigation.Quantitative real-time PCR was used to measure microRNA-128 (miR-128) expression level and western blot was performed to detect protein expression in U87 and U251 cells and human brain tissues. Cell cycle, CCK-8, transwell and wound-healing assays were performed. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was used for identifying the mechanism of SNAI1 and miR-128b regulation. The mechanism of miR-128 targeting SP1 was also tested by luciferase reporter assay. Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridisation staining were used for quantifying SNAI1, SP1 and miR-128 expression levels in human glioma samples.The Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) data revealed that SNAI1 was up-regulated in glioma and we confirmed the findings in normal and glioma tissues. SNAI1 depletion by shRNA retarded the cell cycle and suppressed proliferation and invasion in glioma cell lines. The CGGA data showed that the Pearson correlation index between SNAI1 and miR-128 was negatively correlated. SNAI1 suppressed miR-128b expression by binding to the miR-128b specific promoter motif, and miR-128 targeted SP1 via binding to the 3'-untranslated region of SP1. Moreover, introduction of miR-128 anti-sense oligonucleotide alleviated the cell cycle retardation, proliferation and invasion inhibition induced by SNAI1 shRNA. Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridisation analysis of SNAI1, SP1 and miR-128 unraveled their expression levels and correlations in glioma samples.We propose that the SNAI1/miR-128/SP1 axis, which plays a vital role in glioma progression, may come to be a clinically relevant therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2092440857,"The voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) is the major pathway for ATP, ADP, and other respiratory substrates through the mitochondrial outer membrane, constituting a crucial point of mitochondrial metabolism regulation. VDAC is characterized by its ability to ""gate"" between an open and several ""closed"" states under applied voltage. In the early stages of tumorigenesis or during ischemia, partial or total absence of oxygen supply to cells results in cytosolic acidification. Motivated by these facts, we investigated the effects of pH variations on VDAC gating properties. We reconstituted VDAC into planar lipid membranes and found that acidification reversibly increases its voltage-dependent gating. Furthermore, both VDAC anion selectivity and single channel conductance increased with acidification, in agreement with the titration of the negatively charged VDAC residues at low pH values. Analysis of the pH dependences of the gating and open channel parameters yielded similar pKa values close to 4.0. We also found that the response of VDAC gating to acidification was highly asymmetric. The presumably cytosolic (cis) side of the channel was the most sensitive to acidification, whereas the mitochondrial intermembrane space (trans) side barely responded to pH changes. Molecular dynamic simulations suggested that stable salt bridges at the cis side, which are susceptible to disruption upon acidification, contribute to this asymmetry. The pronounced sensitivity of the cis side to pH variations found here in vitro might provide helpful insights into the regulatory role of VDAC in the protective effect of cytosolic acidification during ischemia in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1963696807,"Many cancer cells rely more on aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect) than mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and catabolize glucose at a high rate. Such a metabolic switch is suggested to be due in part to functional attenuation of mitochondria in cancer cells. However, how oncogenic signals attenuate mitochondrial function and promote the switch to glycolysis remains unclear. We previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation activates and inhibits mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) and phosphatase (PDP), respectively, leading to enhanced inhibitory serine phosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and consequently inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) in cancer cells. In particular, Tyr-381 phosphorylation of PDP1 dissociates deacetylase SIRT3 and recruits acetyltransferase ACAT1 to PDC, resulting in increased inhibitory lysine acetylation of PDHA1 and PDP1. Here we report that phosphorylation at another tyrosine residue, Tyr-94, inhibits PDP1 by reducing the binding ability of PDP1 to lipoic acid, which is covalently attached to the L2 domain of dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (E2) to recruit PDP1 to PDC. We found that multiple oncogenic tyrosine kinases directly phosphorylated PDP1 at Tyr-94, and Tyr-94 phosphorylation of PDP1 was common in diverse human cancer cells and primary leukemia cells from patients. Moreover, expression of a phosphorylation-deficient PDP1 Y94F mutant in cancer cells resulted in increased oxidative phosphorylation, decreased cell proliferation under hypoxia, and reduced tumor growth in mice. Together, our findings suggest that phosphorylation at different tyrosine residues inhibits PDP1 through independent mechanisms, which act in concert to regulate PDC activity and promote the Warburg effect."
https://openalex.org/W1999677795,"The dysregulation of the dopaminergic system is implicated in multiple neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders such as Parkinson disease and drug addiction. The primary target of psychostimulants such as amphetamine and methamphetamine is the dopamine transporter (DAT), the major regulator of extracellular dopamine levels in the brain. However, the behavioral and neurophysiological correlates of methamphetamine and amphetamine administration are unique from one another, thereby suggesting these two compounds impact dopaminergic neurotransmission differentially. We further examined the unique mechanisms by which amphetamine and methamphetamine regulate DAT function and dopamine neurotransmission; in the present study we examined the impact of extracellular and intracellular amphetamine and methamphetamine on the spontaneous firing of cultured midbrain dopaminergic neurons and isolated DAT-mediated current. In dopaminergic neurons the spontaneous firing rate was enhanced by extracellular application of amphetamine > dopamine > methamphetamine and was DAT-dependent. Amphetamine > methamphetamine similarly enhanced DAT-mediated inward current, which was sensitive to isosmotic substitution of Na(+) or Cl(-) ion. Although isosmotic substitution of extracellular Na(+) ions blocked amphetamine and methamphetamine-induced DAT-mediated inward current similarly, the removal of extracellular Cl(-) ions preferentially blocked amphetamine-induced inward current. The intracellular application of methamphetamine, but not amphetamine, prevented the dopamine-induced increase in the spontaneous firing of dopaminergic neurons and the corresponding DAT-mediated inward current. The results reveal a new mechanism for methamphetamine-induced dysregulation of dopaminergic neurons."

However, CI has yielded mixed results in complex task learning. The current study addressed whether the CI effect is generalizable to bimanual skill learning, with a focus on the temporal evolution of memory processes. In contrast to previous studies, an extensive training schedule, distributed across multiple days of practice, was provided. Participants practiced three frequency ratios across three practice days following either a blocked or random practice schedule. During the acquisition phase, better overall performance for the blocked practice group was observed, but this difference diminished as practice progressed. At immediate and delayed retention, the random practice group outperformed the blocked practice group, except for the most difficult frequency ratio. Our main finding is that the random practice group showed superior performance persistence over a one week time interval in all three frequency ratios compared to the blocked practice group. This study contributes to our understanding of learning, consolidation and memory of complex motor skills, which helps optimizing training protocols in future studies and rehabilitation settings."

Temperature exhibited different effects on the abundance and diversity of archaeal and bacterial amoA gene. The elevated temperature increased the abundance of archaeal amoA gene, whereas the abundance of bacterial amoA gene decreased. The highest diversity of bacterial amoA gene was found in the 25°C treatment sample. However, the 25°C treatment sample maintained the lowest diversity of archaeal amoA gene. Most of the archaeal amoA sequences obtained in this study affiliated with the Nitrosopumilus cluster. Two sequences obtained from the 15°C treatment samples were affiliated with the Nitrosotalea cluster. N. oligotropha lineage was the most dominant bacterial amoA gene group. Several sequences affiliated to Nitrosospira and undefined N. europaea/NC. mobilis like lineage were found in the pre-incubation and 25°C treatment groups."

The results are based on 18.7% and 6.9% of the sequences obtained from the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, respectively, with hits to genomes in the non-redundant viral RefSeq database. The identifiable richness and relative abundance in both viromes were dominated by archaeal and bacterial viruses accounting for 92.3% of the relative abundance in the Atlantic Ocean and for 83.6% in the Mediterranean Sea. Despite characteristic differences in hydrographic features between the sampling sites in the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, 440 virus genomes were found in both viromes. An additional 431 virus genomes were identified in the Atlantic Ocean and 75 virus genomes were only found in the Mediterranean Sea. The results indicate that the rather contrasting deep-sea environments of the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea share a common core set of virus types constituting the majority of both virus communities in terms of relative abundance (Atlantic Ocean: 81.4%; Mediterranean Sea: 88.7%)."

The structural information needed to understand the mechanism of regulation of this complex biochemical reaction is incomplete. The presence of two enzymes in one complex poses the question of how these two enzymes cooperate during priming of DNA synthesis. Yeast two-hybrid and direct pulldown assays revealed that the N-terminal domain of the large subunit of primase (p58N) directly interacts with the C-terminal domain of the catalytic subunit of polα (p180C). We found that a complex of the C-terminal domain of the catalytic subunit of polα with the second subunit (p180C-p70) stimulated primase activity, whereas the whole catalytically active heterodimer of polα (p180ΔN-p70) inhibited RNA synthesis by primase. Conversely, the polα catalytic domain without the C-terminal part (p180ΔN-core) possessed a much higher propensity to extend the RNA primer than the two-subunit polα (p180ΔN-p70), suggesting that p180C and/or p70 are involved in the negative regulation of DNA pol activity. We conclude that the interaction between p180C, p70, and p58 regulates the proper primase and polymerase function. The composition of the template DNA is another important factor determining the activity of the complex.

However, the physiological function of Rplp1 in mammalian development remains unknown. In this study, we disrupted Rplp1 in the mouse germline and central nervous system (Rplp1CNSΔ). Rplp1 heterozygosity caused body size reductions, male infertility, systemic abnormalities in various tissues and a high frequency of early postnatal death. Rplp1CNSΔ</emph> newborn mice exhibited perinatal lethality and brain atrophy with size reductions of the neocortex, midbrain and ganglionic eminence. The Rplp1 knockout neocortex exhibited progenitor cell proliferation arrest and apoptosis due to the dysregulation of key cell cycle and apoptosis regulators (cyclin A, cyclin E, p21CIP1, p27KIP1, p53). Similarly, Rplp1 deletion in pMEFs led to proliferation arrest and premature senescence. Importantly, Rplp1 deletion in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts did not alter global protein synthesis, but did change the expression patterns of specific protein subsets involved in protein folding and the unfolded protein response, cell death, protein transport and signal transduction, among others. Altogether, we demonstrated that the translation “fine-tuning” exerted by Rplp1 is essential for embryonic and brain development and for proper cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1989663127,"Thrombosis is the cause of many cardiovascular syndromes and is a significant contributor to life-threatening diseases, such as myocardial infarction and stroke. Thrombus targeted imaging agents have the capability to provide molecular information about pathological clots, potentially improving detection, risk stratification, and therapy of thrombosis-related diseases. Nanocarriers are a promising platform for the development of molecular imaging agents as they can be modified to have external targeting ligands and internal functional cargo. In this work, we report the synthesis and use of chemically functionalized bacteriophage MS2 capsids as biomolecule-based nanoparticles for fibrin imaging. The capsids were modified using an oxidative coupling reaction, conjugating ∼90 copies of a fibrin targeting peptide to the exterior of each protein shell. The ability of the multivalent, targeted capsids to bind fibrin was first demonstrated by determining the impact on thrombin-mediated clot formation. The modified capsids out-performed the free peptides and were shown to inhibit clot formation at effective concentrations over ten-fold lower than the monomeric peptide alone. The installation of near-infrared fluorophores on the interior surface of the capsids enabled optical detection of binding to fibrin clots. The targeted capsids bound to fibrin, exhibiting higher signal-to-background than control, non-targeted MS2-based nanoagents. The in vitro assessment of the capsids suggests that fibrin-targeted MS2 capsids could be used as delivery agents to thrombi for diagnostic or therapeutic applications."

Here we demonstrated that TGF-β1-induced apoptosis is mediated by decreased phosphorylation of cdc2 at Tyr15 accompanied by down-regulation of Wee1 kinase expression. As expected from these results, a Wee1 kinase inhibitor efficiently induced apoptosis in HCC cells in the absence of TGF-β1 treatment. In surgically resected samples, Wee1 kinase was expressed in moderately to poorly differentiated HCC, whereas no Wee1 kinase expression was observed in non-cancerous tissue, including cirrhotic tissue. Our results suggest that Wee1 kinase inhibitors may be a practical novel therapeutic option against advanced HCC."
https://openalex.org/W2034671935,"The CD44+ and CD44− subpopulations of the colorectal cancer cell line Caco2 were analyzed separately for their sensitivities to the antitumor drug camptothecin. CD44+ cells were less sensitive to camptothecin than CD44− cells. The relative resistance of CD44+ cells was correlated with (i) reduced activity of the nuclear enzyme topoisomerase I and (ii) insensitivity of this enzyme to camptothecin when analyzed in extracts. In contrast, topoisomerase I activity was higher in extracts from CD44− cells and the enzyme was camptothecin sensitive. Topoisomerase I from the two subpopulations were differentially phosphorylated in a manner that appeared to determine the drug sensitivity and activity of the enzyme. This finding was further supported by the fact that phosphorylation of topoisomerase I in CD44+ cell extract by protein kinase CK2 converted the enzyme to a camptothecin sensitive, more active form mimicking topoisomerase I in extracts from CD44− cells. Conversely, dephosphorylation of topoisomerase I in extracts from CD44− cells rendered the enzyme less active and camptothecin resistant. These findings add to our understanding of chemotherapy resistance in the Caco2 CD44+ cancer stem cell model."

We have recently demonstrated a marked up-regulation of NADPH oxidase isoform 4 (NOX4) in patients with atrial fibrillation, which is accompanied by overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this study, we investigated the impact on the cardiac phenotype of NOX4 overexpression in zebrafish. One-cell stage embryos were injected with NOX4 RNA prior to video recording of a GFP-labeled (myl7:GFP zebrafish line) beating heart in real time at 24–31 h post-fertilization. Intriguingly, NOX4 embryos developed cardiac arrhythmia that is characterized by irregular heartbeats. When quantitatively analyzed by an established LQ-1 program, the NOX4 embryos displayed much more variable beat-to-beat intervals (mean S.D. of beat-to-beat intervals was 0.027 s/beat in control embryos versus 0.038 s/beat in NOX4 embryos). Both the phenotype and the increased ROS in NOX4 embryos were attenuated by NOX4 morpholino co-injection, treatments of the embryos with polyethylene glycol-conjugated superoxide dismutase, or NOX4 inhibitors fulvene-5, 6-dimethylamino-fulvene, and proton sponge blue. Injection of NOX4-P437H mutant RNA had no effect on the cardiac phenotype or ROS production.

Nonetheless, unlike an established causal role of oxidative stress in vascular pathogenesis, it remains unclear whether oxidative stress contributes to the initiation of arrhythmic disorders in the heart.

Zebrafish is a valuable model for studies of cardiovascular physiology (6.Bakkers J. Zebrafish as a model to study cardiac development and human cardiac disease.Cardiovasc. Res. 2011; 91: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). One of the advantages of zebrafish is that during early development, the heart is situated prominently at the ventral side of the embryo, wrapped by a thin pericardial membrane, and is transparent. Using a cardiac-specific green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic fish line, it is convenient to monitor cardiac development and function in real time, by video taping the beating heart noninvasively. In addition, genetic manipulations can be rapidly achieved by morpholino (MO) or RNA injection. Hence, we can perform both gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies of the target gene in a relatively short period of time. Another advantage of the zebrafish model is that the heart rate of zebrafish is not very different from human heart rate. In contrast, the murine heart beats 7–10 times faster than the human heart, which makes it difficult to either induce or observe arrhythmia. Furthermore, even with severe cardiac dysfunctions that might be lethal to mice, zebrafish embryos most often survive for several days to enable phenotypical analyses (7.Chen J.N. Haffter P.

By transiently overexpressing wild type human NOX4 RNA in zebrafish, we found that NOX4-injected embryos developed an arrhythmic phenotype at 24–30 hours post-fertilization (hpf), which was characterized by irregular heartbeats that are qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed by video recordings and a custom-made LQ-1 program (9.Nguyen C.T.

Co-injection with NOX4 ATG-morpholino abolished arrhythmic phenotypes and superoxide production. Injection of RNA encoding the catalytically inactive NOX4 mutant (NOX4-P437H) deficient in NADPH binding had no effect on cardiac phenotypes. Similar effects were also observed in polyethylene glycol-conjugated superoxide dismutase (PEG-SOD, cell-permeable superoxide scavenger) or NOX4 inhibitors treated NOX4-injected embryos (fulvene-5, 6-dimethylamino-fulvene, and proton sponge blue). NOX4-induced H2O2 production was inhibited by Tempo and fulvene-5. These data indicate that the arrhythmic phenotype is specifically induced by NOX4 and dependent on the ROS generating activity of NOX4. Interestingly, NOX4 overexpression resulted in increased calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) phosphorylation at Thr-286. A selective inhibitor for CaMKII, autocamtide-2-related inhibitory peptide II (AIP), or KN93, also abolished the arrhythmic phenotype. In summary, our findings for the first time uncover a direct causal role of NOX4 in cardiac arrhythmia, which is mediated by the ROS producing activity of NOX4 and CaMKII activation. Human NOX4 (NM_016931) full-length coding region was amplified from pCMV6-hNOX4 (OriGene, SC310253, Rockville, MD) by PCR and cloned into pCS2+ at ClaI and XhoI sites. NOX4-P437H was generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (KOD Hot Start, Novagen/EMD Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). All of the plasmids were confirmed by sequencing. Capped mRNA of human NOX4 and mutant NOX4-P437H were synthesized by in vitro transcription with the mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion). Transgenic strain myl7:GFP zebrafish were maintained as described previously (7.Chen J.N. Haffter P. Odenthal J. Vogelsang E. Brand M. van Eeden F.J. Furutani-Seiki M. Granato M. Hammerschmidt M.

GFP expression is driven by a cardiac-specific promoter of myl7 (also known as cardiac myosin light chain 2). The developmental stages of fish were determined by observations of morphological features of fish raised at 28.5 °C. Wild type human NOX4 or mutant NOX4-P437H RNA (300 pg) was injected into myl7:GFP transgenic embryos at one-cell stage. In some experiments, embryos were co-injected with 3 ng of antisense morpholino (5′-GCCAGCTCCTCCAGGACACAGCCAT-3′, Gene Tools, Philomath, OR) complementary to the translation start codon ATG of the human NOX4 coding region.

Digital videos were taken under UV illumination from embryos of similar developmental stages at 24–30 hpf. Embryos were randomly chosen for videotaping. Each embryo was videotaped for 1 min, after stabilizing for 1–2 min in 0.01% Tricaine methanesulfonate (Sigma). The videos were split into consecutive frames by QuickTime player at 30 frames/s, which were then converted to a line-scanning result of atrial contraction by a custom-made LQ-1 program as described previously (Fig. 1, A and B) (9.Nguyen C.T.

Each vertical line by LQ-1 analysis represents one contraction. The horizontal axis indicates time of contraction, 1/30 s/pixel. By measuring the number of pixels between every vertical line (contraction) by another custom-made software, we acquired the precise time for one contraction, considered as beat-to-beat interval (beat-to-beat interval = number of pixels × 1/30 s). To represent the beat-to-beat variation, we calculated standard deviation (S.D.) of beat-to-beat intervals of one embryo (Fig. 1, E and F). Statistical comparison was carried out between standard deviations of control and NOX4 or NOX4-P437H RNA-injected embryos. All the video analyses were done blindly without knowing the genotypes.

Embryos were randomly transferred to 0.01% Tricaine methanesulfonate buffer for imaging. All fluorescence images were taken at the same setting by Carl Zeiss Stemi SV 11 Apo microscope with 488 nm wavelength excitation. The average fluorescence density (normalized to area) was analyzed by ImageJ. Tissue lysates of zebrafish embryos were prepared as mentioned above. Phosphatase inhibitor mixtures 2 and 3 (1:100, Sigma) were added when necessary. For determination of CaMKII (Thr-286) phosphorylation, 200 μg of proteins were separated in 10% SDS-PAGE with detection using 1:500 primary antibody dilution (Cell Signaling Technology). Densitometry was performed with ImageJ and normalized to tubulin. Whole mount antibody staining was performed as described previously (19.Chen J.N. Fishman M.C.

By injecting 300 pg of wild type hNOX4 RNA into one-cell stage myl7:GFP transgenic embryos, we discovered that 53% of these embryos developed a phenotype of irregular heart beats at 24–30 hpf (supplemental Video I, representative videos from control or NOX4 RNA-injected embryos), although only 10% of control embryos had a phenotype of much less variable heart beats at the same developmental stage (19 out of 167), which is considered physiological (23.Chan P.K.

The arrhythmic phenotype is obvious up to 48 hpf, after which it is not easily visible any more, which is likely attributed to RNA degradation (Fig. 7A). Of note, efficacies of NOX4 overexpression and morpholino treatment (see below) were verified by transfecting a Myc-tagged NOX4 RNA and detecting NOX4 using the Myc antibody (supplemental Fig. II). To quantitatively characterize the arrhythmic phenotype, the videos of beating hearts in real time were analyzed by taking sequential pictures generated from the videos using a custom-made line-scanning software LQ-1 (9.Nguyen C.T.

The outline of the heart in Fig. 1A is marked with green lines, and the white line in Fig. 1A indicates the scanning line position of the LQ-1 program.

The black arrow in Fig. 1B indicates a beat-to-beat interval. Fig. 1C demonstrates heart beats from two representative embryos analyzed by the LQ-1 program. The heart beat of the control embryo was consistent and stable, whereas the NOX4-overexpressed embryos had irregular heart beats characterized by random early or late beats, as indicated by the arrowheads in Fig. 1C. Next, we measured the beat-to-beat intervals (time interval of two consecutive contractions) of each embryo. The beat-to-beat intervals of control embryos had small fluctuations as expected for normal physiology (23.Chan P.K. Lin C.C. Cheng S.H.

To quantitatively define the beat-to-beat fluctuation (beat-to-beat variation), we calculated the standard deviation of beat-to-beat intervals of each embryo, which has been previously employed as a quantitative assessment of cardiac arrhythmia (25.Incardona J.P.

Phenanthrene exposure causes cardiac arrhythmia in embryonic zebrafish via perturbing calcium handling.Aquat. Toxicol. 2013; 142: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1E, the standard deviation of beat-to-beat intervals of a representative control embryo was 0.024 s/beat versus 0.035 s/beat for a representative NOX4 embryo. These are shown as the two circled points in Fig. 1F. The rest of the points in Fig. 1F are the standard deviations of individual embryos examined in the two groups (p < 0.01 control versus NOX4-injected). Of note, the LQ-1 analysis results represent the variations in beat-to-beat intervals for the representative videos of control, and NOX4 RNA-injected zebrafish embryos (supplemental Video I) are shown in Fig. 1C. The average heart rates of control and NOX4 embryos are indifferent (Fig. 1D) (93.3 ± 1.2 beats/min in control versus 96.4 ± 2.5 beats/min in NOX4-injected embryos). To examine a specific role for NOX4 in inducing arrhythmia in zebrafish, we co-injected NOX4 RNA with 3 ng of NOX4 morpholino, designed to target the translation initiation site of human NOX4 sequence. To compare with NOX4 RNA-injected embryos, we analyzed videos of co-injection embryos taken from three independent injections. Effects of different interventions on the arrhythmic phenotype of zebrafish embryos are summarized in Table 1. Interestingly, MO co-injection markedly reduced the percentage of embryos that developed arrhythmic phenotypes from 53 to 20%. Out of 251 embryos analyzed from the NOX4-injected grou"

The aim of this study was to assess the differences between the left ventricular (LV) myocardial function in hemodialysis and nondialysis uremic patients based on three-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography.The study population consisted of 35 maintenance hemodialysis patients (the hemodialysis group), 30 uremic patients who were hospitalized for the creation of a primary arteriovenous fistula (the nondialysis group), and 32 healthy volunteers. All of the patients had normal left ventricular ejection fractions (i.e., 55% or greater). Three-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography was performed to assess the left ventricle's global three-dimensional strain, regional longitudinal strain, circumferential strain, and radial strain.The left ventricular regional longitudinal strain, radial strain, circumferential strain, and global three-dimensional strain were significantly decreased in the nondialysis patients compared with the other two groups (all, P<0.001). However, the three-dimensional strain and the regional longitudinal strain were lower in the hemodialysis patients than in the controls (P<0.01). In the hemodialysis patients and the control group, the longitudinal strain, circumferential strain, and radial strain were higher at the apical level than they were at the basal level and midlevels. A multivariate linear regression analysis showed that the blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels were independently associated with the values of the global three-dimensional strain (β = -0.217, P = 0.000; β = -0.243, P = 0.011, respectively) and the longitudinal strain (β = -0.154, P = 0.032; β = -0.188, P = 0.029, respectively).Three-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography may detect myocardial dysfunction in patients with uremia who have preserved LVEF. The global three-dimensional strain and the regional longitudinal strain appear to be superior in hemodialysis patients compared with nondialysis patients."

Because choi-joki-to and daio-kanzo-to commonly contain the genus Glycyrrhiza, we isolated licopyranocoumarin (LPC) and glycyrurol (GCR) as potent neuroprotective principals from Glycyrrhiza. LPC and GCR markedly blocked MPP+-induced neuronal PC12D cell death and disappearance of mitochondrial membrane potential, which were mediated by JNK. LPC and GCR inhibited MPP+-induced JNK activation through the suppression of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, thereby inhibiting MPP+-induced neuronal PC12D cell death. These results indicated that LPC and GCR derived from choi-joki-to and daio-kanzo-to would be promising drug leads for PD treatment in the future."
https://openalex.org/W1986292636,"Transient global cerebral ischemia induces profound changes in the transcriptome of brain cells, which is partially associated with the induction or repression of genes that influence the ischemic response. However, the mechanisms responsible for the selective vulnerability of hippocampal neurons to global ischemia remain to be clarified. To identify molecular changes elicited by ischemic insults, we subjected hippocampal primary cultures to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), an in vitro model for global ischemia that resulted in delayed neuronal death with an excitotoxic component. To investigate changes in the transcriptome of hippocampal neurons submitted to OGD, total RNA was extracted at early (7 h) and delayed (24 h) time points after OGD and used in a whole-genome RNA microarray. We observed that at 7 h after OGD there was a general repression of genes, whereas at 24 h there was a general induction of gene expression. Genes related with functions such as transcription and RNA biosynthesis were highly regulated at both periods of incubation after OGD, confirming that the response to ischemia is a dynamic and coordinated process. Our analysis showed that genes for synaptic proteins, such as those encoding for PICK1, GRIP1, TARPγ3, calsyntenin-2/3, SAPAP2 and SNAP-25, were down-regulated after OGD. Additionally, OGD decreased the mRNA and protein expression levels of the GluA1 AMPA receptor subunit as well as the GluN2A and GluN2B subunits of NMDA receptors, but increased the mRNA expression of the GluN3A subunit, thus altering the composition of ionotropic glutamate receptors in hippocampal neurons. Together, our results present the expression profile elicited by in vitro ischemia in hippocampal neurons, and indicate that OGD activates a transcriptional program leading to down-regulation in the expression of genes coding for synaptic proteins, suggesting that the synaptic proteome may change after ischemia."
https://openalex.org/W2153181636,"A structural analysis of the recently developed orange fluorescent proteins with novel phenotypes, LSSmOrange (λex/λem at 437/572 nm), PSmOrange (λex/λem at 548/565 nm and for photoconverted form at 636/662 nm) and PSmOrange2 (λex/λem at 546/561 nm and for photoconverted form at 619/651 nm), is presented. The obtained crystallographic structures provide an understanding of how the ensemble of a few key mutations enabled special properties of the orange FPs. While only a single Ile161Asp mutation, enabling excited state proton transfer, is critical for LSSmOrange, other substitutions provide refinement of its special properties and an exceptional 120 nm large Stokes shift. Similarly, a single Gln64Leu mutation was sufficient to cause structural changes resulting in photoswitchability of PSmOrange, and only one additional substitution (Phe65Ile), yielding PSmOrange2, was enough to greatly decrease the energy of photoconversion and increase its efficiency of photoswitching. Fluorescence of photoconverted PSmOrange and PSmOrange2 demonstrated an unexpected bathochromic shift relative to the fluorescence of classic red FPs, such as DsRed, eqFP578 and zFP574. The structural changes associated with this fluorescence shift are of considerable value for the design of advanced far-red FPs. For this reason the chromophore transformations accompanying photoconversion of the orange FPs are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2060130567,"Although many clinical pathological states are now detectable using imaging and biochemical analyses, neuropsychological tests are often considered as valuable complementary approaches to confirm diagnosis, especially for disorders like Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease, and schizophrenia. The touchscreen-based automated test battery, which was introduced two decades ago in humans to assess cognitive functions, has recently been successfully back-translated in monkeys and rodents. We focused on optimizing the protocol of three distinct behavioral paradigms in mice: two variants of the Paired Associates Learning (PAL) and the Visuo-Motor Conditional Learning (VMCL) tasks. Acquisition of these tasks was assessed in naive versus pre-trained mice. In naive mice, we managed to define testing conditions allowing significant improvements of learning performances over time in the three aforementioned tasks. In pre-trained mice, we observed differential acquisition rates after specific task combinations. Particularly, we identified that animals previously trained in the VMCL paradigm subsequently poorly learned the sPAL rule. Together with previous findings, these data confirm the feasibility of using such behavioral assays to evaluate the power of different models of cognitive dysfunction in mice. They also highlight the risk of interactions between tasks when rodents are run through a battery of different cognitive touchscreen paradigms."
https://openalex.org/W1983455798,"Single molecule force spectroscopy was employed to investigate the dynamics of the sodium glucose co-transporter (SGLT1) upon substrate and inhibitor binding on the single molecule level. CHO cells stably expressing rbSGLT1 were probed by using atomic force microscopy tips carrying either thioglucose, 2'-aminoethyl β-d-glucopyranoside, or aminophlorizin. Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chains of different length and varying end groups were used as tether. Experiments were performed at 10, 25 and 37 °C to address different conformational states of SGLT1. Unbinding forces between ligands and SGLT1 were recorded at different loading rates by changing the retraction velocity, yielding binding probability, width of energy barrier of the binding pocket, and the kinetic off rate constant of the binding reaction. With increasing temperature, width of energy barrier and average life time increased for the interaction of SGLT1 with thioglucose (coupled via acrylamide to a long PEG) but decreased for aminophlorizin binding. The former indicates that in the membrane-bound SGLT1 the pathway to sugar translocation involves several steps with different temperature sensitivity. The latter suggests that also the aglucon binding sites for transport inhibitors have specific, temperature-sensitive conformations."
https://openalex.org/W2010348043,"Hatchling fitness in crocodilians is affected by ""runtism"" or failure to thrive syndrome (FTT) in captivity. In this study, 300 hatchling C. porosus, artificially incubated at 32°C for most of their embryonic development, were raised in semi-controlled conditions, with growth criteria derived for the early detection of FTT (within 24 days). Body mass, four days after hatching (BM4d), was correlated with egg size and was highly clutch specific, while snout-vent length (SVL4d) was much more variable within and between clutches. For the majority of hatchlings growth trajectories within the first 24 days continued to 90 days and could be used to predict FTT affliction up to 300 days, highlighting the importance of early growth. Growth and survival of hatchling C. porosus in captivity was not influenced by initial size (BM4d), with a slight tendency for smaller hatchlings to grow faster in the immediate post-hatching period. Strong clutch effects (12 clutches) on affliction with FTT were apparent, but could not be explained by measured clutch variables or other factors. Among individuals not afflicted by FTT (N = 245), mean growth was highly clutch specific, and the variation could be explained by an interaction between clutch and season. FTT affliction was 2.5 times higher among clutches (N = 7) that hatched later in the year when mean minimum air temperatures were lower, compared with those clutches (N = 5) that hatched early in the year. The results of this study highlight the importance of early growth in hatchling C. porosus, which has implications for the captive management of this species."
https://openalex.org/W1974391991,"Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is well known as a highly toxic environmental chemical threat. Prolonged exposure to H2S can lead to the formation of pulmonary edema. However, the mechanisms of how H2S facilitates edema formation are poorly understood. Since edema formation can be enhanced by an impaired clearance of electrolytes and, consequently, fluid across the alveolar epithelium, it was questioned whether H2S may interfere with transepithelial electrolyte absorption. Electrolyte absorption was electrophysiologically measured across native distal lung preparations (Xenopus laevis) in Ussing chambers. The exposure of lung epithelia to H2S decreased net transepithelial electrolyte absorption. This was due to an impairment of amiloride-sensitive sodium transport. H2S inhibited the activity of the Na+/K+-ATPase as well as lidocaine-sensitive potassium channels located in the basolateral membrane of the epithelium. Inhibition of these transport molecules diminishes the electrochemical gradient which is necessary for transepithelial sodium absorption. Since sodium absorption osmotically facilitates alveolar fluid clearance, interference of H2S with the epithelial transport machinery provides a mechanism which enhances edema formation in H2S-exposed lungs."
https://openalex.org/W2025087073,"A emm53 subclass of Group A Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS) interacts tightly with human plasma plasminogen (hPg) and plasmin (hPm) via the kringle 2 (K2hPg) domain of hPg/hPm and the N-terminal a1a2 regions of a GAS coiled-coil M-like protein (PAM). Previous studies have shown that a monomeric PAM fragment, VEK30 (residues 97-125 + Tyr), interacted specifically with isolated K2hPg. However, the binding strength of VEK30 (KD = 56 nm) was ∼60-fold weaker than that of full-length dimeric PAM (KD = 1 nm). To assess whether this attenuated binding was due to the inability of VEK30 to dimerize, we defined the minimal length of PAM required to dimerize using a series of peptides with additional PAM residues placed at the NH2 and COOH termini of VEK30. VEK64 (PAM residues 83-145 + Tyr) was found to be the smallest peptide that adopted an α-helical dimer, and was bound to K2hPg with nearly the same affinity as PAM (KD = 1-2 nm). However, addition of two PAM residues (Arg(126)-His(127)) to the COOH terminus of VEK30 (VEK32) maintained a monomeric peptidic structure, but exhibited similar K2hPg binding affinity as full-length dimeric PAM. We identified five residues in a1a2 (Arg(113), His(114), Glu(116), Arg(126), His(127)), mutation of which reduced PAM binding affinity for K2hPg by ∼ 1000-fold. Replacement of these critical residues by Ala in the GAS genome resulted in reduced virulence, similar to the effects of inactivating the PAM gene entirely. We conclude that rather than dimerization of PAM, the five key residues in the binding domain of PAM are essential to mediate the high affinity interaction with hPg, leading to increased GAS virulence."
https://openalex.org/W2028867701,"To survive in the presence of a wide range of toxic compounds, gram-negative bacteria expel such compounds via tripartite efflux pumps that span both the inner and outer membranes. The Salmonella-specific MdsAB pump consists of MdsB, a resistance-nodulation-division (RND)-type inner membrane transporter (IMT) that requires the membrane fusion protein (MFP) MdsA, and an outer membrane protein (OMP; MdsC or TolC) to form a tripartite efflux complex. In this study, we investigated the role of the putative tip regions of MdsA and its OMPs, MdsC and TolC, in the formation of a functional MdsAB-mediated efflux pump. Comparative analysis indicated that although sequence homologies of MdsA and MdsC with other MFPs and OMPs, respectively, are extremely low, key residues in the putative tip regions of these proteins are well conserved. Mutagenesis studies on these conserved sites demonstrated their importance for the physical and functional interactions required to form an MdsAB-mediated pump. Our studies suggest that, despite differences in the primary amino acid sequences and functions of various OMPs and MFPs, interactions mediated by the conserved tip regions of OMP and MFP are required for the formation of functional tripartite efflux pumps in gram-negative bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2040360409,"An endocytic vesicle is formed from a flat plasma membrane patch by a sequential process of invagination, bud formation and fission. The scission step requires the formation of a tubular membrane neck (the fission pore) that connects the endocytic vesicle with the plasma membrane. Progress in vesicle fission can be measured by the formation and closure of the fission pore. Live-cell imaging and sensitive biophysical measurements have provided various glimpses into the structure and behaviour of the fission pore. In the present study, the role of non-muscle myosin II (NM-2) in vesicle fission was tested by analyzing the kinetics of the fission pore with perforated-patch clamp capacitance measurements to detect single vesicle endocytosis with millisecond time resolution in peritoneal mast cells. Blebbistatin, a specific inhibitor of NM-2, dramatically increased the duration of the fission pore and also prevented closure during large endocytic events. Using the fluorescent markers FM1-43 and pHrodo Green dextran, we found that NM-2 inhibition greatly arrested vesicle fission in a late phase of the scission event when the pore reached a final diameter of ∼ 5 nm. Our results indicate that loss of the ATPase activity of myosin II drastically reduces the efficiency of membrane scission by making vesicle closure incomplete and suggest that NM-2 might be especially relevant in vesicle fission during compound endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1964918543,"Yeast Rfu1 (regulator for free ubiquitin chain 1) localizes to endosomes and plays a role in ubiquitin homeostasis by inhibiting the activity of Doa4. We show that Bro1, a member of the class E vacuolar protein sorting proteins that recruits Doa4 to endosomes and stimulates Doa4 deubiquitinating activity, also recruits Rfu1 to endosomes for involvement in ubiquitin homeostasis. This recruitment was mediated by the direct interaction between a region containing the YPEL motif in Rfu1 and the V domain in Bro1, which could be analogous to the interaction between the mammalian Alix V domain and YPXnL motifs of viral and cellular proteins. Furthermore, overexpression of Bro1, particularly the V domain, prevented Rfu1 degradation in response to heat shock. Thus, Bro1, a Doa4 positive regulator, regulated Rfu1, a negative regulator of Doa4. Rfu1 degradation partly involved the proteasome and a ubiquitin ligase Rsp5, suggesting that Rfu1 stability was regulated by ubiquitin-proteasome pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2091037238,"In this study, the evidence of electron-dense magnetic inclusions with polyhedral shape in the cytoplasm of Harveyi clade Vibrio strain PS1, a bioluminescent bacterium living in symbiosis with marine organisms, led us to investigate the behavior of this bacterium under exposure to static magnetic fields ranging between 20 and 2000 Gauss. When compared to sham-exposed, the light emission of magnetic field-exposed bacteria growing on solid medium at 18°C ±0.1°C was increased up to two-fold as a function of dose and growth phase. Stimulation of bioluminescence by magnetic field was more pronounced during the post-exponential growth and stationary phase, and was lost when bacteria were grown in the presence of the iron chelator deferoxamine, which caused disassembly of the magnetic inclusions suggesting their involvement in magnetic response. As in luminescent Vibrio spp. bioluminescence is regulated by quorum sensing, possible effects of magnetic field exposure on quorum sensing were investigated. Measurement of mRNA levels by reverse transcriptase real time-PCR demonstrated that luxR regulatory gene and luxCDABE operon coding for luciferase and fatty acid reductase complex were significantly up-regulated in magnetic field-exposed bacteria. In contrast, genes coding for a type III secretion system, whose expression was negatively affected by LuxR, were down-regulated. Up-regulation of luxR paralleled with down-regulation of small RNAs that mediate destabilization of luxR mRNA in quorum sensing signaling pathways. The results of experiments with the well-studied Vibrio campbellii strain BB120 (originally classified as Vibrio harveyi) and derivative mutants unable to synthesize autoinducers suggest that the effects of magnetic fields on quorum sensing may be mediated by AI-2, the interspecies quorum sensing signal molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2092982253,"Considering implication of diacylglycerol in both metabolism and signaling pathways, maintaining proper levels of diacylglycerol (DAG) is critical to cellular homeostasis and development. Except the PIP2-PLC mediated pathway, metabolic pathways leading to generation of DAG converge on dephosphorylation of phosphatidic acid catalyzed by lipid phosphate phosphatases. Here we report the role of such enzymes in a model plant pathogenic fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae. We identified five genes encoding putative lipid phosphate phosphatases (MoLPP1 to MoLPP5). Targeted disruption of four genes (except MoLPP4) showed that MoLPP3 and MoLPP5 are required for normal progression of infection-specific development and proliferation within host plants, whereas MoLPP1 and MoLPP2 are indispensable for fungal pathogenicity. Reintroduction of MoLPP3 and MoLPP5 into individual deletion mutants restored all the defects. Furthermore, exogenous addition of saturated DAG not only restored defect in appressorium formation but also complemented reduced virulence in both mutants. Taken together, our data indicate differential roles of lipid phosphate phosphatase genes and requirement of proper regulation of cellular DAGs for fungal development and pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1966079939,"In this post-genomic era, genome-wide functional analysis is indispensable. The recent development of RNA interference techniques has enabled researchers to easily analyze gene function even in non-model organisms. On the other hand, little progress has been made in the identification and functional analyses of cis-regulatory elements in non-model organisms. In order to develop experimental platform for identification and analyses of cis-regulatory elements in a non-model organism, in this case, the ladybird beetle, Harmonia axyridis, we established transgenic transposon-tagged lines using a novel composite vector. This vector enables the generation of two types of insertion products (jumpstarter and mutator). The jumpstarter portion carries a transposase gene, while the mutator segment carries a reporter gene for detecting enhancers. The full-composite element is flanked by functional termini (required for movement); however, the mutator region has an extra terminus making it possible for the mutator to remobilize on its own, thus leaving an immobile jumpstarter element behind. Each insertion type is stable on its own, but once crossed, jumpstarters can remobilize mutators. After crossing a jumpstarter and mutator line, all tested G2 females gave rise to at least one new insertion line in the next generation. This jumping rate is equivalent to the P-element-mediated jumpstarter method in Drosophila. These established transgenic lines will offer us the ideal experimental materials for the effective screening and identification of enhancers in this species. In addition, this jumpstarter method has the potential to be as effective in other non-model insect species and thus applicable to any organism."
https://openalex.org/W1993426322,"Osteosarcoma is a rare but highly malignant tumor occurring most frequently in adolescents. The prognosis of non-responders to chemotherapy is still poor, and new treatment modalities are needed. To develop peptide-based immunotherapy, we previously identified autologous cytotoxic T lymphocyte-defined osteosarcoma antigen papillomavirus binding factor (PBF) in the context of HLA-B55 and the cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitope (PBF A2.2) presented by HLA-A2. PBF and HLA class I are expressed in ∼90 and 70% of various sarcomas, respectively. However, the expression status of peptide PBF A2.2 presented by HLA-A2 on osteosarcoma cells has remained unknown because it is difficult to generate a specific probe that reacts with the HLA·peptide complex. For detection and qualification of the HLA-A*02:01·PBF A2.2 peptide complex on osteosarcoma cells, we tried to isolate a single chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody directed to the HLA-*A0201·PBF A2.2 complex using a naïve scFv phage display library. As a result, scFv clone D12 with high affinity (KD = 1.53 × 10−9 m) was isolated. D12 could react with PBF A2.2 peptide-pulsed T2 cells and HLA-A2+PBF+ osteosarcoma cell lines and simultaneously demonstrated that the HLA·peptide complex was expressed on osteosarcoma cells. In conclusion, scFv clone D12 might be useful to select candidate patients for PBF A2.2 peptide-based immunotherapy and develop antibody-based immunotherapy.

https://openalex.org/W2011205012,"Epidermis, a continuously self-renewing and differentiating organ, produces a protective stratum corneum that shields us from external chemical, physical and microbial threats. Epidermal differentiation is a multi-step process regulated by influences, some unknown, others insufficiently explored. Detachment of keratinocytes from the basement membrane is one such pro-differentiation stimulus. Here, we define the transcriptional changes during differentiation, especially those caused by detachment from the substratum. Using comprehensive transcriptional profiling, we revisited the effects of detachment as a differentiation signal to keratinocytes. We identified the genes regulated by detachment, the corresponding ontological categories and, using metaanalysis, compared the genes and categories to those regulated by other pro-differentiating stimuli. We identified 762 genes overexpressed in suspended keratinocyte, including known and novel differentiation markers, and 1427 in attached cells, including basal layer markers. Detachment induced epidermis development, cornification and desmosomal genes, but also innate immunity, proliferation inhibitors, transcription regulators and MAPKs; conversely the attached cells overexpressed cell cycle, anchoring, motility, splicing and mitochondrial genes, and both positive and negative regulators of apoptosis. Metaanalysis identified which detachment-regulated categories overlap with those induced by suprabasal location in vivo, by reaching confluency in vitro, and by inhibition of JUN kinases. Attached and in vivo basal cells shared overexpression of mitochondrial components. Interestingly, melanosome trafficking components were also overexpressed in the attached and in vivo basal keratinocytes. These results suggest that specific pro-differentiation signals induce specific features of the keratinization process, which are in vivo orchestrated into harmonious epidermal homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1981609959,"Even in the absence of major disturbances (e.g., cyclones, bleaching), corals are consistently subject to high levels of background mortality, which undermines individual fitness and resilience of coral colonies. Partial mortality may impact coral response to climate change by reducing colony ability to recover between major acute stressors. This study quantified proportion of injured versus uninjured colonies (the prevalence of injuries) and instantaneous measures of areal extent of injuries across individual colonies (the severity of injuries), in four common coral species along the Great Barrier Reef in Australia: massive Porites, encrusting Montipora, Acropora hyacinthus and Pocillopora damicornis. A total of 2,276 adult colonies were surveyed three latitudinal sectors, nine reefs and 27 sites along 1000 km2 on the Great Barrier Reef. The prevalence of injuries was very high, especially for Porites spp (91%) and Montipora encrusting (85%) and varied significantly, but most lay at small spatial scales (e.g., among colonies positioned <10-m apart). Similarly, severity of background partial mortality was surprisingly high (between 5% and 21%) but varied greatly among colonies within the same site and habitat. This study suggests that intraspecific variation in partial mortality between adjacent colonies may be more important than variation between colonies in different latitudinal sectors or reefs. Differences in the prevalence and severity of background partial mortality have significant ramifications for coral capacity to cope with increasing acute disturbances, such as climate-induced coral bleaching. These data are important for understanding coral responses to increasing stressors, and in particular for predicting their capacity to recover between subsequent disturbances."
https://openalex.org/W2111643736,"Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is a malignant lymphoid disease of which B-cell precursor- (BCP) and T-cell- (T) ALL are subtypes. The role of alleles encoded by major histocompatibility loci (MHC) have been examined in a number of previous studies and results indicating weak, multi-allele associations between the HLA-DPB1 locus and BCP-ALL suggested a role for immunosusceptibility and possibly infection. Two independent SNP association studies of ALL identified loci approximately 37 kb from one another and flanking a strong meiotic recombination hotspot (DNA3), adjacent to HLA-DOA and centromeric of HLA-DPB1. To determine the relationship between this observation and HLA-DPB1 associations, we constructed high density SNP haplotypes of the 316 kb region from HLA-DMB to COL11A2 in childhood ALL and controls using a UK GWAS data subset and the software PHASE. Of four haplotype blocks identified, predicted haplotypes in Block 1 (centromeric of DNA3) differed significantly between BCP-ALL and controls (P = 0.002) and in Block 4 (including HLA-DPB1) between T-ALL and controls (P = 0.049). Of specific common (>5%) haplotypes in Block 1, two were less frequent in BCP-ALL, and in Block 4 a single haplotype was more frequent in T-ALL, compared to controls. Unexpectedly, we also observed apparent differences in ancestral meiotic recombination rates at DNA3, with BCP-ALL showing increased and T-ALL decreased levels compared to controls. In silico analysis using LDsplit sotware indicated that recombination rates at DNA3 are influenced by flanking loci, including SNPs identified in childhood ALL association studies. The observed differences in rates of meiotic recombination at this hotspot, and potentially others, may be a characteristic of childhood leukemia and contribute to disease susceptibility, alternatively they may reflect interactions between ALL-associated haplotypes in this region."
https://openalex.org/W2034062138,"Rapid ascent to high altitude causes illness and fatigue, and there is a demand for effective acute treatments to alleviate such effects. We hypothesized that increased oxygen delivery to the tissue using a combination of a hypertensive agent and an endothelin receptor A antagonist drugs would limit exercise-induced fatigue at simulated high altitude. Our data showed that the combination of 0.1 mg/kg ambrisentan with either 20 mg/kg ephedrine or 10 mg/kg methylphenidate significantly improved exercise duration in rats at simulated altitude of 4,267 m, whereas the individual compounds did not. In normoxic, anesthetized rats, ephedrine alone and in combination with ambrisentan increased heart rate, peripheral blood flow, carotid and pulmonary arterial pressures, breathing rate, and vastus lateralis muscle oxygenation, but under inspired hypoxia, only the combination treatment significantly enhanced muscle oxygenation. Our results suggest that sympathomimetic agents combined with endothelin-A receptor blockers offset altitude-induced fatigue in rats by synergistically increasing the delivery rate of oxygen to hypoxic muscle by concomitantly augmenting perfusion pressure and improving capillary conductance in the skeletal muscle. Our findings might therefore serve as a basis to develop an effective treatment to prevent high-altitude illness and fatigue in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2114588285,"Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) has become a popular technique in evolutionary genetics for elucidating population structure and history due to its flexibility. The statistical inference framework has benefited from significant progress in recent years. In population genetics, however, its outcome depends heavily on the amount of information in the dataset, whether that be the level of genetic variation or the number of samples and loci. Here we look at the power to reject a simple constant population size coalescent model in favor of a bottleneck model in datasets of varying quality. Not only is this power dependent on the number of samples and loci, but it also depends strongly on the level of nucleotide diversity in the observed dataset. Whilst overall model choice in an ABC setting is fairly powerful and quite conservative with regard to false positives, detecting weaker bottlenecks is problematic in smaller or less genetically diverse datasets and limits the inferences possible in non-model organism where the amount of information regarding the two models is often limited. Our results show it is important to consider these limitations when performing an ABC analysis and that studies should perform simulations based on the size and nature of the dataset in order to fully assess the power of the study."
https://openalex.org/W2112017351,"A new instrument used for treating femoral head osteonecrosis was recently proposed: the umbrella-shaped, Ni-Ti memory femoral head support device. The device has an efficacy rate of 82.35%. Traditional radiographic study provides limited information about the mechanical behaviour of the support device during an implant operation. Thus, this study proposes a finite element analysis method, which includes a 3-step formal head model construction scheme and a unique material assignment strategy for evaluating mechanical behaviour during an implant operation. Four different scenarios with different constraints, initial positions and bone qualities are analyzed using the simulation method. The max radium of the implanted device was consistent with observation data, which confirms the accuracy of the proposed method. To ensure that the device does not unexpectedly open and puncture the femoral head, the constraint on the impact device should be strong. The initial position of sleeve should be in the middle to reduce the damage to the decompression channel. The operation may fail because of poor bone quality caused by severe osteoporosis. The proposed finite element analysis method has proven to be an accurate tool for studying the mechanical behaviour of umbrella-shaped, Ni-Ti memory alloy femoral head support device during an implant operation. The 3-step construct scheme can be implemented with any kind of bone structure meshed with multiple element types."
https://openalex.org/W2063275170,"Livin is a member of the Inhibitor of Apoptosis (IAP) protein family that inhibits apoptosis triggered by a variety of stimuli. We previously demonstrated that while Livin inhibits caspase activity, caspases can cleave Livin to produce a truncated protein, tLivin and that this newly formed tLivin paradoxically induces cell death. However to date, the mechanism of tLivin-induced cell death is not fully understood. In this study, we set out to characterize the form of cell death mediated by tLivin. Here we demonstrate that, unlike most death-promoting proteins, tLivin is a flexible inducer of cell death capable of promoting necrosis or apoptosis in different cell lines. The unusual flexibility of tLivin is displayed by its ability to activate an alternative form of cell death when apoptosis is inhibited. Thus, tLivin can promote more than one form of cell death in the same cell type. Interestingly, in cells where tLivin induces necrosis, deletion of the caspase binding BIR domain results in tLivin-induced apoptosis, suggesting the BIR domain can potentially hamper the ability of tLivin to induce apoptosis. We further elucidate that tLivin activates the JNK pathway and both tLivin-induced apoptosis and necrosis are partially mediated by JNK activity. Acquired resistance to apoptosis, common in many tumors, impinges on the efficiency of conventional anti-cancer agents that function primarily by inducing apoptosis. The ability of tLivin to induce death of apoptosis-compromised cells makes it an attractive candidate for targeted cancer therapy."
