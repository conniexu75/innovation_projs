https://openalex.org/W2026217219,"In otherwise profoundly akinetic rats that had been severely depleted of brain catecholamines, anticholinergic drugs caused excessive walking. The effect did not appear until 10 days after surgery and then increased with time, suggesting that a phenomenon analogous to denervation supersensitivity may be involved. If the animals walked into corners, they were unable to turn around or back out. Their gait (extremely short steps) was reminiscent of that of patients with Parkinson's disease. The results are consistent with a mutually antagonistic interaction between cholinergic and dopaminergic brain systems and emphasize certain complexities in this interaction."

https://openalex.org/W2005440761,"Peripheral administration of the COOH-terminal octapeptide of cholecystokinin in doses from 1 to 100 micrograms per kilogram of body weight (0.25 to 25.0 micrograms per rat) significantly antagonized tail pinch-induced eating in rats, an animal model for stress-induced human hyperphagia. Centrally administered cholecystokinin was effective only in high doses (3 micrograms into the cerebral ventricle). The finding that the minimal effective dose of cholecystokinin in suppressing stress-induced appetitive behavior is smaller after peripheral than central administration suggests that the peptide is acting on peripheral, as opposed to central nervous system, substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1558443685,"We have investigated the association of non-tubulin microtubule proteins with tubulin to form the ring-shaped oligomeric structures found in microtubule preparations. We have found that the two oligomeric species present in our preparations of microtubule protein (s020,w = 18 and 30 S) each require non-tubulin factors for their formation. Two types of non-tubulin protein, the high molecular weight proteins (HMW) and the tau proteins were found to be active in ring formation. The HMW proteins promoted the formation of the 30 S oligomer, while the tau proteins promoted the formation of an oligomer of s020,w = 20 S. Analysis of the 30 S oligomer by gel filtration chromatography showed that the ratio of HMW proteins to tubulin was about twice that in the microtubule. The HMW proteins could be destroyed by exposure to trypsin, resulting in a marked increase in the sedimentation coefficient of the 30 S oligomer to 39 S. The 20, 30, and 39 S species were identified as rings by electron microscopy. The identity of the 18 S structure as a ring was called into question. Our data indicate that the 20 S species is a single ring and that the 30 S oligomer is a two-layered ring bearing HMW projections which contribute substantial hydrodynamic drag to the particle. We compare the organization of tubulin subunits and HMW molecules in the 30 S ring with the organization of these components in the microtubule and suggest that the organization in the ring is conserved in the microtubule."

https://openalex.org/W1485608018,"Ribonucleotide reductase from Ehrlich tumor cells was separated by chromatography on blue dextran/Sepharose into two protein fractions (Tris and Dye fractions). Neither fraction alone had reductase activity, but when combined, constituted an active enzyme system. Heat treatment of either fraction resulted in an inactive combination. The approximate molecular size of the active component of the Tris and Dye fractions was determined to be 5.7 S and 6.5 S, respectively, compared to 9 S for the intact enzyme. The Tris fraction was inactivated by hydroxylamine while the dye fraction was inactivated by pyridoxal phosphate/BH4-treatment. The inactivation of the Dye fraction was prevented by ATP. These data would indicate that the Tris and Dye fractions were comparable in function to the B2 and B1 proteins, respectively, of the Escherichia coli ribonucleotide reductase."
https://openalex.org/W1579625232,"Acetylcholine receptor has been purified from embryonic skeletal muscle cells grown and allowed to differentiate in tissue culture. The polypeptide composition of purified receptor has been determined by two-dimensional electrophoresis. The purest preparations are composed of a single Mr = 41,000 class of polypeptide which exhibits some charge heterogeneity. By high resolution two-dimensional electrophoresis a spot corresponding to acetylcholine receptor was localized among total proteins of muscle membrane extracts. Synthesis of this component is shown to be developmentally regulated. Quantitative analysis of receptor synthesis and degradation has led to the conclusion that receptor is one of a class of proteins whose synthesis is tightly regulated during terminal steps of myogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W1557157286,"Ovaries of the amphibian Triturus viridescens contain a considerable amount of 7 to 12 S RNA which fractionates with poly(A)+ RNA on oligo(dT)-cellulose column chromatography and directs the synthesis of all five classes of histones in a wheat germ cell-free system. The polyadenylate tracts associated with this 7 to 12 S poly (A)+ RNA are heterogeneous in length, ranging from approximately 60 to 120 nucleotides. Partially purified subfractions of histone mRNA templates were isolated from this RNA by preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The correlation between the poly(A) content, the template activity in vitro, and the cell-free products encoded by these RNA subfractions suggests that Triturus ovary RNA contains poly(A)+ histone mRNA. The 7 to 12 S poly(A)+ RNA, but not 7 to 12 S poly(A)- RNA, is an effective template for the avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase-directed synthesis of complementary DNA (cDNA) in the presence of oligo(dT) primer. In the absence of primer, virtually no cDNA is synthesized. When cDNA complementary to 7 to 12 S poly(A)+ RNA is hybridized in situ to Drosophila melanogaster polytene chromosome preparations. cDNA hybrids are found primarily in the region 39D-E, the locus of the histone genes in Drosophila. This cDNA also hybridizes to the sea urchin histone gene sequences contained in the chimeric bacterial plasmids pSp2 and pSp17. These results provide strong evidence for the reality of polyadenylated histone mRNA in Triturus ovary."

Injection of 6-hydroxydopamine caused significant depletion of brain norepinephrine, while brain dopamine levels were not significantly depleted. Intact brain noradrenergic systems seem to be necessary for developing tolerance to the hypnotic and hypothermic effects of the barbiturates."

One colony appeared to be abnormally small, and more dead bats were found a year after the juvenile bats had been collected. This is the first report to link the field mortality of bats directly to insecticide residues acquired through the food chain."
https://openalex.org/W2085242481,"CIRCULATING antigen–antibody (AgAb) complexes are capable of damaging various tissues, for example, renal glomeruli, vessels and joints1. In addition, immune complexes (IC) can interfere with cellular immunity and, to some extent, decrease the immune response2–4. We report here that all infants fed on cow's milk have circulating complexes containing bovine proteins as antigens and IgG antibodies of maternal origin. These data raise questions as to the possible involvement of such complexes in various disorders, the intestinal resorption of macromolecules, and the development of antibodies against food antigens."
https://openalex.org/W1519614662,"A procedure is described for the purification of the calcium-binding protein (CaBP) from the chorioallantoic membrane of the chick embryo. With this scheme, a 180- to 200-fold purification was achieved with a 40% yield. Characterization of the CaBP revealed that its properties differ from those of previously studied calcium-binding proteins. The CaBP has a molecular weight of 95,000 to 100,000 and appears to be composed of four subunits of identical molecular weight (22,000 to 25,000). The CaBP is a basic protein as indicated by its high electrophoretic mobility under acidic conditions and its relatively high isoelectric point of 8.06. The calcium-binding activity of the CaBP is sulfhydryl dependent and highly specific for calcium ions (10 high affinity sites, ka = 2.35 X 10(7) m-1; 100 to 120 low affinity sites, ka = 2.00 X 10(5) M-1). Amino acid analysis indicated that the CaBP contains 2 to 10 residues of a modified amino acid, gamma-carboxyglutamate (gamma-CGlu). The presence of gamma-CGlu residues suggested that vitamin K may be involved in the expression of the CaBP in the chorioallantoic membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1964172550,"The presence of diazepam in cultures of chicken embryo myoblasts arrests normal muscle cell differentiation. High concentrations of the drug reversibly prevent myoblasts from fusing to form multinucleated myotubes. Lower concentrations of diazepam allow cell fusion to occur, but inhibit the synthesis and accumulation of myosin heavy chain, implying that cell fusion does not obligate myoblasts to synthesize and accumulate large quantities of muscle specific protein. The effect of diazepam on muscle cells in culture is direct and specific."
https://openalex.org/W1517348996,"Plasma membranes, isolated from Ehrlich ascites tumor cells, were dissolved in 2% cholate, 4 M urea and then reformed into liposomes upon dialysis at 4 degrees with exogenous phospholipids. Reconstituted vesicles regain the ability to transport amino acids. Na+ was shown to accelerate the uptake of alpha-aminoisobutyrate, phenylalanine, and methionine, but not leucine or epsilon-aminohexanoic acid. With the reconstituted vesicles, methionine, but not leucine, inhibited the uptake of alpha-aminoisobutyrate. An apparent Km value for alpha-aminoisobutyrate uptake of 3.0 mM was obtained. This value is close to that observed with the intact cells and the native membrane vesicles. A Na+ gradient (high Na+ outside) increased alpha-aminoisobutyrate uptake, whereas a reversed gradient (high Na+ inside) increased alpha-aminoisobutyrate efflux. The latter flux was increased by valinomycin, suggesting electrogenic transport. A modest extent of coupling between a Na+ gradient and uphill flow of alpha-aminoisobutyrate was observed."
https://openalex.org/W2077034553,"The effect of a controlled lighting schedule on the activity of a weanling rat liver extract that stimulates DNA synthesis in regenerating adult rat liver, and on the response of the test animals to the extract, has been investigated. Both activity of the extract and endogenous DNA synthesis in the weanling animals follow the same distinct diurnal rhythm. Reversal of the lighting schedule reverses the rhythm of endogenous DNA synthesis but activity of the extract no longer correlates with the peak of DNA synthesis. Diurnal rhythm also has a striking effect on DNA synthesis in the regenerating test animal, but the extract increases DNA synthesis to the same relative degree, regardless of the time of day the hepatectomy is performed."

Eggs partially activated by ammonia showed a similar effect. The data suggest that a structural change involving membrane lipids accompanies activation."

https://openalex.org/W1557362354,"The molecular weight of chicken liver D-3-phosphglycerate dehydrogenase, as measured by sedimentation equilibrium analysis, was found to be 165,000, consistent with the measured sedimentation coefficient of 8.13 S. Sedimentation equilibrium studies in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride and gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate gave molecular weights of 40,000 to 43,000, indicating that the protein is composed of 4 subunits of equal molecular weight. Fractionation of the soluble tryptic peptides of the S-[14C]carboxymethylated enzyme by ion exchange chromatography and unidirectional paper electrophoresis indicated a maximum of 40 major peptides, which is approximately one-fourth of the number of tryptic peptides expected from the lysine plus arginine content of 157 of the tetramer. This observation suggests that the subunits possess identical or very similar amino acid sequences. The purified enzyme is a basic protein with an isoelectric point of 8.95. Amino acid analysis and titration with p-hydroxymercuribenzoate indicated that the 12 half-cystinyl residues present/subunit exist in the free sulfhydryl form. NH2-terminal analysis in an automatic protein sequenator indicated that the polypeptide chains of the protein are blocked."

https://openalex.org/W1602497189,Increasing hydrostatic pressure in the analytical ultracentrifuge by increasing rotor velocity and overlayering protein samples with oil caused a depolymerization of the 30 S oligomer of microtubule protein. This results indicates that the reaction of 6 S microtubule protein to form the oligomer was accompanied by a positive volume change. The effect of hydrostatic pressure on the 6 S to 30 S transition was employed to demonstrate the presence of a rapidly reversible equilibrium between these components by showing polymerization or depolymerization of the oligomer during the course of ultracentrifugation. The magnitude of the partial specific volume change accompanying this reaction was estimated from mass fraction measurements of microtubule protein solutions at a variety of hydrostatic pressures to be about 9 X 10(-4) ml g-1.
https://openalex.org/W1606947577,"Microtubule protein purified from porcine brain was fixed at low protein concentration with glutaraldehyde under conditions which maximize the relative concentration of the ring-shaped 30 S oligomer. Fixed oligomer was separated from glutaraldehyde and other protein species by column chromatography. The fixed, isolated oligomer was deposited on electron microscopy grids, dehydrated, and then critical point-dried before shadow-coating with carbon/platinum alloy at a fixed angle. Analysis of the shadow lengths observed by electron microscopy revealed that the height of the 30 S oligomer is 15 nm. Microtubule protein deposited on electron microscope grids at high protein concentrations was examined by the negative stain technique and found to contain apparent stacks of oligomer from which the number of tubulin dimers per turn of the ring and the distance between turns could be determined. The number of subunits per turn was determined as 13.8. The distance between turns was found to be 7.4 nm, indicating that the 15 nm high, shadowed oligomers consisted of two turns. Additional information from the literature is considered and a model is presented for the oligomer. The model is a helix of 29 tubulin dimers and five high molecular weight protein molecules arranged so as to preserve intersubunit bonding patterns found in microtubules."

https://openalex.org/W1600076491,"A method is described for the preparation of homogeneous D-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase from chicken liver in amounts sufficient for structural studies. The procedure utilizes ammonium sulfate precipitation, blue dextran-Sepharose chromatography, ion exchange chromatography on phosphocellulose, and crystallization. Previous reports of instability of the enzyme have been shown to be due to proteolysis in the crude extract which can be effectively prevented by leupeptin. The purified enzyme is a basic protein with a pI of 8.95 as measured by isoelectric focusing. The extinction coefficient at 278 nm of a 1% solution is 5.3."

https://openalex.org/W1523838318,"The distance between the obligatory monovalent and divalent cations at the active site of pyruvate kinase (rabbit muscle) has been used to monitor structural changes at various successive intermediates in the catalytic reaction and to relate structure and activity of substrate analogs. Determinations of distance were obtained from measurements of the longitudinal relaxation rate (1/T1) of the methyl protons of methyl ammonium ion, which was affected by the activating divalent cation Mn2+ in the various enzyme complexes. A frequency dependence of the 1/T1 effects with several complexes indicats that the observed relaxation rate changes are modulated by changes in the cation-cation distances. The results are interpreted as a sequence of structural changes at the active site which occur upon substrate binding, catalysis, and product release. Substrate analogs which are good analogs of phosphoenolpyruvate by kinetic criteria induce structural changes analogous to the substrate. An attempt is made to correlate the cation-cation distance changes to other structural changes reported for pyruvate kinase."

https://openalex.org/W1484641740,"Regeneration of enzymic activity from reduced hen egg lysozyme peptide 1-127 was effected with a glutathione oxidation-reduction buffer. The rate of regeneration was nearly as great for peptide 1-127 as for reduced lysozyme itself, and the yields were the same (greater than 80%). The regenerated fragment 1-127 was shown to be indistinguishable from fragment 1-127 before reduction by ion exchange chromatography, amino acid analysis, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and disulfide analysis. These results show that the COOH-terminal dipeptide Arg-Leu is not essential for the acquisition of the native three-dimensional structure of lysozyme."

Cation-exchange chromatography of the ribonuclease-thiol reaction mixture revealed seven fractions. The fraction with the highest activity had an approximate tenfold decrease in the apparent Michaelis constant for cyclic CMP with respect to native ribonuclease. The enhanced activity is a metastable property since this fraction reverts back to the control activity and chromatographic behavior of native ribonuclease on standing in solution at room temperature."
