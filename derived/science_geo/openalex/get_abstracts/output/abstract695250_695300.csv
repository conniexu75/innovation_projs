https://openalex.org/W4282980285,"Gains and losses of DNA are prevalent in cancer and emerge as a consequence of inter-related processes of replication stress, mitotic errors, spindle multipolarity and breakage-fusion-bridge cycles, among others, which may lead to chromosomal instability and aneuploidy1,2. These copy number alterations contribute to cancer initiation, progression and therapeutic resistance3-5. Here we present a conceptual framework to examine the patterns of copy number alterations in human cancer that is widely applicable to diverse data types, including whole-genome sequencing, whole-exome sequencing, reduced representation bisulfite sequencing, single-cell DNA sequencing and SNP6 microarray data. Deploying this framework to 9,873 cancers representing 33 human cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas6 revealed a set of 21 copy number signatures that explain the copy number patterns of 97% of samples. Seventeen copy number signatures were attributed to biological phenomena of whole-genome doubling, aneuploidy, loss of heterozygosity, homologous recombination deficiency, chromothripsis and haploidization. The aetiologies of four copy number signatures remain unexplained. Some cancer types harbour amplicon signatures associated with extrachromosomal DNA, disease-specific survival and proto-oncogene gains such as MDM2. In contrast to base-scale mutational signatures, no copy number signature was associated with many known exogenous cancer risk factors. Our results synthesize the global landscape of copy number alterations in human cancer by revealing a diversity of mutational processes that give rise to these alterations."
https://openalex.org/W4282975734,"Chromosomal instability (CIN) drives cancer cell evolution, metastasis and therapy resistance, and is associated with poor prognosis1. CIN leads to micronuclei that release DNA into the cytoplasm after rupture, which triggers activation of inflammatory signalling mediated by cGAS and STING2,3. These two proteins are considered to be tumour suppressors as they promote apoptosis and immunosurveillance. However, cGAS and STING are rarely inactivated in cancer4, and, although they have been implicated in metastasis5, it is not known why loss-of-function mutations do not arise in primary tumours4. Here we show that inactivation of cGAS-STING signalling selectively impairs the survival of triple-negative breast cancer cells that display CIN. CIN triggers IL-6-STAT3-mediated signalling, which depends on the cGAS-STING pathway and the non-canonical NF-κB pathway. Blockade of IL-6 signalling by tocilizumab, a clinically used drug that targets the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), selectively impairs the growth of cultured triple-negative breast cancer cells that exhibit CIN. Moreover, outgrowth of chromosomally instable tumours is significantly delayed compared with tumours that do not display CIN. Notably, this targetable vulnerability is conserved across cancer types that express high levels of IL-6 and/or IL-6R in vitro and in vivo. Together, our work demonstrates pro-tumorigenic traits of cGAS-STING signalling and explains why the cGAS-STING pathway is rarely inactivated in primary tumours. Repurposing tocilizumab could be a strategy to treat cancers with CIN that overexpress IL-6R."
https://openalex.org/W4282965548,"Chromosomal instability (CIN) results in the accumulation of large-scale losses, gains and rearrangements of DNA1. The broad genomic complexity caused by CIN is a hallmark of cancer2; however, there is no systematic framework to measure different types of CIN and their effect on clinical phenotypes pan-cancer. Here we evaluate the extent, diversity and origin of CIN across 7,880 tumours representing 33 cancer types. We present a compendium of 17 copy number signatures that characterize specific types of CIN, with putative aetiologies supported by multiple independent data sources. The signatures predict drug response and identify new drug targets. Our framework refines the understanding of impaired homologous recombination, which is one of the most therapeutically targetable types of CIN. Our results illuminate a fundamental structure underlying genomic complexity in human cancers and provide a resource to guide future CIN research. Copy number signatures characterize different types of chromosomal instability and predict drug response."
https://openalex.org/W4282972916,"Exercise confers protection against obesity, type 2 diabetes and other cardiometabolic diseases1-5. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms that mediate the metabolic benefits of physical activity remain unclear6. Here we show that exercise stimulates the production of N-lactoyl-phenylalanine (Lac-Phe), a blood-borne signalling metabolite that suppresses feeding and obesity. The biosynthesis of Lac-Phe from lactate and phenylalanine occurs in CNDP2+ cells, including macrophages, monocytes and other immune and epithelial cells localized to diverse organs. In diet-induced obese mice, pharmacological-mediated increases in Lac-Phe reduces food intake without affecting movement or energy expenditure. Chronic administration of Lac-Phe decreases adiposity and body weight and improves glucose homeostasis. Conversely, genetic ablation of Lac-Phe biosynthesis in mice increases food intake and obesity following exercise training. Last, large activity-inducible increases in circulating Lac-Phe are also observed in humans and racehorses, establishing this metabolite as a molecular effector associated with physical activity across multiple activity modalities and mammalian species. These data define a conserved exercise-inducible metabolite that controls food intake and influences systemic energy balance."

https://openalex.org/W4282940841,"Treatment with therapy targeting BRAF and MEK (BRAF/MEK) has revolutionized care in melanoma and other cancers; however, therapeutic resistance is common and innovative treatment strategies are needed1,2. Here we studied a group of patients with melanoma who were treated with neoadjuvant BRAF/MEK-targeted therapy ( NCT02231775 , n = 51) and observed significantly higher rates of major pathological response (MPR; ≤10% viable tumour at resection) and improved recurrence-free survival (RFS) in female versus male patients (MPR, 66% versus 14%, P = 0.001; RFS, 64% versus 32% at 2 years, P = 0.021). The findings were validated in several additional cohorts2-4 of patients with unresectable metastatic melanoma who were treated with BRAF- and/or MEK-targeted therapy (n = 664 patients in total), demonstrating improved progression-free survival and overall survival in female versus male patients in several of these studies. Studies in preclinical models demonstrated significantly impaired anti-tumour activity in male versus female mice after BRAF/MEK-targeted therapy (P = 0.006), with significantly higher expression of the androgen receptor in tumours of male and female BRAF/MEK-treated mice versus the control (P = 0.0006 and P = 0.0025). Pharmacological inhibition of androgen receptor signalling improved responses to BRAF/MEK-targeted therapy in male and female mice (P = 0.018 and P = 0.003), whereas induction of androgen receptor signalling (through testosterone administration) was associated with a significantly impaired response to BRAF/MEK-targeted therapy in male and female patients (P = 0.021 and P < 0.0001). Together, these results have important implications for therapy."
https://openalex.org/W4282984520,"Among the caspases that cause regulated cell death, a unique function for caspase-7 has remained elusive. Caspase-3 performs apoptosis, whereas caspase-7 is typically considered an inefficient back-up. Caspase-1 activates gasdermin D pores to lyse the cell; however, caspase-1 also activates caspase-7 for unknown reasons1. Caspases can also trigger cell-type-specific death responses; for example, caspase-1 causes the extrusion of intestinal epithelial cell (IECs) in response to infection with Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium)2,3. Here we show in both organoids and mice that caspase-7-deficient IECs do not complete extrusion. Mechanistically, caspase-7 counteracts gasdermin D pores and preserves cell integrity by cleaving and activating acid sphingomyelinase (ASM), which thereby generates copious amounts of ceramide to enable enhanced membrane repair. This provides time to complete the process of IEC extrusion. In parallel, we also show that caspase-7 and ASM cleavage are required to clear Chromobacterium violaceum and Listeria monocytogenes after perforin-pore-mediated attack by natural killer cells or cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which normally causes apoptosis in infected hepatocytes. Therefore, caspase-7 is not a conventional executioner but instead is a death facilitator that delays pore-driven lysis so that more-specialized processes, such as extrusion or apoptosis, can be completed before cell death. Cells must put their affairs in order before they die."
https://openalex.org/W4282975189,"Immunosurveillance of cancer requires the presentation of peptide antigens on major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules1–5. Current approaches to profiling of MHC-I-associated peptides, collectively known as the immunopeptidome, are limited to in vitro investigation or bulk tumour lysates, which limits our understanding of cancer-specific patterns of antigen presentation in vivo6. To overcome these limitations, we engineered an inducible affinity tag into the mouse MHC-I gene (H2-K1) and targeted this allele to the KrasLSL-G12D/+Trp53fl/fl mouse model (KP/KbStrep)7. This approach enabled us to precisely isolate MHC-I peptides from autochthonous pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and from lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) in vivo. In addition, we profiled the LUAD immunopeptidome from the alveolar type 2 cell of origin up to late-stage disease. Differential peptide presentation in LUAD was not predictable by mRNA expression or translation efficiency and is probably driven by post-translational mechanisms. Vaccination with peptides presented by LUAD in vivo induced CD8+ T cell responses in naive mice and tumour-bearing mice. Many peptides specific to LUAD, including immunogenic peptides, exhibited minimal expression of the cognate mRNA, which prompts the reconsideration of antigen prediction pipelines that triage peptides according to transcript abundance8. Beyond cancer, the KbStrep allele is compatible with other Cre-driver lines to explore antigen presentation in vivo in the pursuit of understanding basic immunology, infectious disease and autoimmunity. A newly developed genetically engineered mouse model enables the analysis of specific antigen presentation in vivo, providing insights into the tumour immunopeptidome and cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W4282967446,"The activation of eukaryotic origins of replication occurs in temporally separated steps to ensure that chromosomes are copied only once per cell cycle. First, the MCM helicase is loaded onto duplex DNA as an inactive double hexamer. Activation occurs after the recruitment of a set of firing factors that assemble two Cdc45-MCM-GINS (CMG) holo-helicases. CMG formation leads to the underwinding of DNA on the path to the establishment of the replication fork, but whether DNA becomes melted at this stage is unknown1. Here we use cryo-electron microscopy to image ATP-dependent CMG assembly on a chromatinized origin, reconstituted in vitro with purified yeast proteins. We find that CMG formation disrupts the double hexamer interface and thereby exposes duplex DNA in between the two CMGs. The two helicases remain tethered, which gives rise to a splayed dimer, with implications for origin activation and replisome integrity. Inside each MCM ring, the double helix becomes untwisted and base pairing is broken. This comes as the result of ATP-triggered conformational changes in MCM that involve DNA stretching and protein-mediated stabilization of three orphan bases. Mcm2 pore-loop residues that engage DNA in our structure are dispensable for double hexamer loading and CMG formation, but are essential to untwist the DNA and promote replication. Our results explain how ATP binding nucleates origin DNA melting by the CMG and maintains replisome stability at initiation."

https://openalex.org/W4282978620,"Abstract Linkages between the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and the peptidoglycan layer are crucial for the maintenance of cellular integrity and enable survival in challenging environments 1–5 . The function of the outer membrane is dependent on outer membrane proteins (OMPs), which are inserted into the membrane by the β-barrel assembly machine 6,7 (BAM). Growing Escherichia coli cells segregate old OMPs towards the poles by a process known as binary partitioning, the basis of which is unknown 8 . Here we demonstrate that peptidoglycan underpins the spatiotemporal organization of OMPs. Mature, tetrapeptide-rich peptidoglycan binds to BAM components and suppresses OMP foldase activity. Nascent peptidoglycan, which is enriched in pentapeptides and concentrated at septa 9 , associates with BAM poorly and has little effect on its activity, leading to preferential insertion of OMPs at division sites. The synchronization of OMP biogenesis with cell wall growth results in the binary partitioning of OMPs as cells divide. Our study reveals that Gram-negative bacteria coordinate the assembly of two major cell envelope layers by rendering OMP biogenesis responsive to peptidoglycan maturation, a potential vulnerability that could be exploited in future antibiotic design."
https://openalex.org/W4282979374,"Quantum electrodynamics (QED) is one of the most fundamental theories of physics and has been shown to be in excellent agreement with experimental results1-5. In particular, measurements of the electron's magnetic moment (or g factor) of highly charged ions in Penning traps provide a stringent probe for QED, which allows testing of the standard model in the strongest electromagnetic fields6. When studying the differences between isotopes, many common QED contributions cancel owing to the identical electron configuration, making it possible to resolve the intricate effects stemming from the nuclear differences. Experimentally, however, this quickly becomes limited, particularly by the precision of the ion masses or the magnetic field stability7. Here we report on a measurement technique that overcomes these limitations by co-trapping two highly charged ions and measuring the difference in their g factors directly. We apply a dual Ramsey-type measurement scheme with the ions locked on a common magnetron orbit8, separated by only a few hundred micrometres, to coherently extract the spin precession frequency difference. We have measured the isotopic shift of the bound-electron g factor of the isotopes 20Ne9+ and 22Ne9+ to 0.56-parts-per-trillion (5.6 × 10-13) precision relative to their g factors, an improvement of about two orders of magnitude compared with state-of-the-art techniques7. This resolves the QED contribution to the nuclear recoil, accurately validates the corresponding theory and offers an alternative approach to set constraints on new physics."
https://openalex.org/W4282917677,"We assessed the impacts of the implementation of inclusive and active pedagogical approaches in an introductory biology sequence at a large, public research university in the northeast United States. We compared academic performance between these sections with other sections of the same course where didactic approaches were used over a five-year period. We also compared this five-year period (2014-2018) with the previous five years of the same courses. Additionally, we also tracked the academic performance of the students from the sections where active learning and inclusive teaching were used, as well as the more conventionally taught (lecture-based) sections in future, mandatory biology courses. We found that the inclusively taught section of the first semester of introductory biology increased the odds of students earning higher grades in that particular section. The active learning section in the second semester narrowed the ethnic performance gap when compared to similar sections, both historically and those run concurrently. Finally, students who matriculated into the inclusively taught section of biology in the first semester followed by the active learning section in the second semester of introductory biology performed better in 200-level biology courses than students who had zero semesters of either active or inclusive pedagogy in their introductory year. Our results suggest that active and inclusive pedagogies hold great promise for improving academic performance when compared to didactic approaches, however, questions remain on the most appropriate ways for capturing the impact of inclusive approaches. Implications for institutional approaches and policy are also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W4282939267,"The COVID-19 pandemic in Russia has already resulted in 500,000 excess deaths, with more than 5.6 million cases registered officially by July 2021. Surveillance based on case reporting has become the core pandemic monitoring method in the country and globally. However, population-based seroprevalence studies may provide an unbiased estimate of the actual disease spread and, in combination with multiple surveillance tools, help to define the pandemic course. This study summarises results from four consecutive serological surveys conducted between May 2020 and April 2021 at St. Petersburg, Russia and combines them with other SARS-CoV-2 surveillance data.We conducted four serological surveys of two random samples (May-June, July-August, October-December 2020, and February-April 2021) from adults residing in St. Petersburg recruited with the random digit dialing (RDD), accompanied by a telephone interview to collect information on both individuals who accepted and declined the invitation for testing and account for non-response. We have used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay CoronaPass total antibodies test (Genetico, Moscow, Russia) to report seroprevalence. We corrected the estimates for non-response using the bivariate probit model and also accounted the test performance characteristics, obtained from independent assay evaluation. In addition, we have summarised the official registered cases statistics, the number of hospitalised patients, the number of COVID-19 deaths, excess deaths, tests performed, data from the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) surveillance, the vaccination uptake, and St. Petersburg search and mobility trends. The infection fatality ratios (IFR) have been calculated using the Bayesian evidence synthesis model.After calling 113,017 random mobile phones we have reached 14,118 individuals who responded to computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) and 2,413 provided blood samples at least once through the seroprevalence study. The adjusted seroprevalence in May-June, 2020 was 9.7% (95%: 7.7-11.7), 13.3% (95% 9.9-16.6) in July-August, 2020, 22.9% (95%: 20.3-25.5) in October-December, 2021 and 43.9% (95%: 39.7-48.0) in February-April, 2021. History of any symptoms, history of COVID-19 tests, and non-smoking status were significant predictors for higher seroprevalence. Most individuals remained seropositive with a maximum 10 months follow-up. 92.7% (95% CI 87.9-95.7) of participants who have reported at least one vaccine dose were seropositive. Hospitalisation and COVID-19 death statistics and search terms trends reflected the pandemic course better than the official case count, especially during the spring 2020. SARS-CoV-2 circulation showed rather low genetic SARS-CoV-2 lineages diversity that increased in the spring 2021. Local VOC (AT.1) was spreading till April 2021, but B.1.617.2 substituted all other lineages by June 2021. The IFR based on the excess deaths was equal to 1.04 (95% CI 0.80-1.31) for the adult population and 0.86% (95% CI 0.66-1.08) for the entire population.Approximately one year after the COVID-19 pandemic about 45% of St. Petersburg, Russia residents contracted the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Combined with vaccination uptake of about 10% it was enough to slow the pandemic at the present level of all mitigation measures until the Delta VOC started to spread. Combination of several surveillance tools provides a comprehensive pandemic picture."
https://openalex.org/W4282959876,"Clinical practitioners are influential figures in the public's health-seeking behavior. Therefore, understanding their attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine is critical for implementing successful vaccination programs. Our study aimed to investigate clinical practitioners' acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine and associated factors for evidence-based interventions.Data from 461 clinical practitioners were collected using a cross-sectional design via an online self-administered survey. Descriptive and multiple logistic regression analyses and chi-square tests were conducted using R version 3.6.1.The COVID-19 vaccine was accepted by 84.4 percent of those polled, and 86.1 percent said they would recommend it to others. Individuals with advanced levels of education demonstrated greater readiness for vaccine acceptance (P<0.001) and willingness to recommend (P<0.001). On the other hand, practitioners with concerns about the safety of vaccines developed in emergency settings were less likely to accept vaccines (OR = 0.22). Practitioners influenced by social media posts (OR = 0.91) and religious beliefs (OR = 0.71) were found to be less willing to recommend the vaccine.The study demonstrated that interventions to improve clinical practitioners' acceptance and recommendation of the COVID-19 vaccine should consider the following factors: level of experience and education, religious beliefs, safety concerns, specific profession, and source of information. Vaccine literacy efforts that directly address specific concerns and misconceptions, such as those that reconcile social media information and religious beliefs with scientific literature, are recommended."
https://openalex.org/W4282971986,"Aquaporin 4 is absent from astrocytes in the rodent optic nerve head, despite high expression in the retina and myelinated optic nerve. The purpose of this study was to quantify regional aquaporin channel expression in astrocytes of the porcine and human mouse optic nerve (ON). Ocular tissue sections were immunolabeled for aquaporins 1(AQP1), 4(AQP4), and 9(AQP9), myelin basic protein (MBP), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and alpha-dystroglycan (αDG) for their presence in retina, lamina, myelin transition zone (MTZ, region just posterior to lamina) and myelinated ON (MON). Semi- quantification of AQP4 labeling & real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) data were analyzed in retina and ON tissue. Porcine and control human eyes had abundant AQP4 in Müller cells, retinal astrocytes, and myelinated ON (MON), but minimal expression in the lamina cribrosa. AQP1 and AQP9 were present in retina, but not in the lamina. Immunolabeling of GFAP and αDG was similar in lamina, myelin transition zone (MTZ) and MON regions. Semi-quantitative AQP4 labeling was at background level in lamina, increasing in the MTZ, and highest in the MON (lamina vs MTZ, MON; p≤0.05, p≤0.01, respectively). Expression of AQP4 mRNA was minimal in lamina and substantial in MTZ and MON, while GFAP mRNA expression was uniform among the lamina, MTZ, and MON regions. Western blot assay showed AQP4 protein expression in the MON samples, but none was detected in the lamina tissue. The minimal presence of AQP4 in the lamina is a specific regional phenotype of astrocytes in the mammalian optic nerve head."
https://openalex.org/W4282970464,"Antibody engineering is becoming increasingly popular in medicine for the development of diagnostics and immunotherapies. Antibody function relies largely on the recognition and binding of antigenic epitopes via the loops in the complementarity determining regions. Hence, accurate high-resolution modeling of these loops is essential for effective antibody engineering and design. Deep learning methods have previously been shown to effectively predict antibody backbone structures described as a set of inter-residue distances and orientations. However, antigen binding is also dependent on the specific conformations of surface side-chains. To address this shortcoming, we created DeepSCAb: a deep learning method that predicts inter-residue geometries as well as side-chain dihedrals of the antibody variable fragment. The network requires only sequence as input, rendering it particularly useful for antibodies without any known backbone conformations. Rotamer predictions use an interpretable self-attention layer, which learns to identify structurally conserved anchor positions across several species. We evaluate the performance of the model for discriminating near-native structures from sets of decoys and find that DeepSCAb outperforms similar methods lacking side-chain context. When compared to alternative rotamer repacking methods, which require an input backbone structure, DeepSCAb predicts side-chain conformations competitively. Our findings suggest that DeepSCAb improves antibody structure prediction with accurate side-chain modeling and is adaptable to applications in docking of antibody-antigen complexes and design of new therapeutic antibody sequences."
https://openalex.org/W4282971627,"The idea of faculty engaging in meaningful dialogue with different publics instead of simply communicating their research to interested audiences has gradually morphed from a novel concept to a mainstay within most parts of the academy. Given the wide variety of public engagement modalities, it may be unsurprising that we still lack a comprehensive and granular understanding of factors that influence faculty willingness to engage with public audiences. Those nuances are not always captured by quantitative surveys that rely on pre-determined categories to assess scholars’ willingness to engage. While closed-ended categories are useful to examine which factors influence the willingness to engage more than others, it is unlikely that pre-determined categories comprehensively represent the range of factors that undermine or encourage engagement, including perceptual influences, institutional barriers, and scholars’ lived experiences. To gain insight into these individual perspectives and lived experiences, we conducted focus group discussions with faculty members at a large midwestern land-grant university in the United States. Our findings provide context to previous studies of public engagement and suggest four themes for future research. These themes affirm the persistence of institutional barriers to engaging with the public, particularly the expectations in the promotion process for tenure-track faculty. However, we also find a perception that junior faculty and graduate students are challenging the status quo by introducing a new wave of attention to public engagement. This finding suggests a “trickle-up” effect through junior faculty and graduate students expecting institutional support for public engagement. Our findings highlight the need to consider how both top-down factors such as institutional expectations and bottom-up factors such as graduate student interest shape faculty members’ decisions to participate in public engagement activities."
https://openalex.org/W4282980103,"Synthetic dyes are widely used as colorant compounds in various industries for different purposes. Among all the dyestuffs, azo dyes constitute the largest and the most used class of dyes. These dyes and their intermediate products are common contaminants of ground water and soil in developing countries. Biological methods have been found to be promising for the treatment and degradation of these compounds. In the present study, we focused on the biological removal of azo dyes (Reactive orange 16 and Reactive black 5) under aerobic conditions using an indigenous bacterial strain isolated from contaminated industrial areas. The bacterial isolate was identified as Bacillus cereus strain ROC. Degradation experiments under agitation with both free and immobilized cells indicates that this strain degrades both azo- dyes in 5 days. The immobilized cells were more proficient than their free cell counterparts. The toxicity of the biotransformation products formed after decolorization were assessed by conducting bacteriotoxic and phytotoxic assays. All the toxicity assays indicate that the dyes' degraded products were non-toxic in nature, as compared to the dyes themselves. The kinetics of the azo dyes' degradation was also studied at various initial concentration ranges from 50 mg/L to 250 mg/L by growth independent kinetic models. Zero-order kinetics were fit to the experimental data, producing values of least squares regression (R2) greater than 0.98, which indicates that the bacterial strain degrades both dyes by co-metabolism rather than utilizing them as sole energy source. These results indicate that the Bacillus cereus ROC strain has great potential to degrade dye-contaminated water and soil."
https://openalex.org/W4283028376,"A rapid and accurate diagnosis is a crucial strategy for containing the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Considering the obstacles to upscaling the use of RT-qPCR, rapid tests based on antigen detection (Ag-RDT) have become an alternative to enhance mass testing, reducing the time for a prompt diagnosis and virus spreading. However, the performances of several commercially available Ag-RDTs have not yet been evaluated in several countries. Here, we evaluate the performance of eight Ag-RDTs available in Brazil to diagnose COVID-19. Patients admitted to tertiary hospitals with moderate or mild COVID-19 symptoms and presenting risk factors for severe disease were included. The tests were performed using a masked protocol, strictly following the manufacturer's recommendations and were compared with RT-qPCR. The overall sensitivity of the tests ranged from 9.8 to 81.1%, and specificity greater than 83% was observed for all the evaluated tests. Overall, slight or fair agreement was observed between Ag-RDTs and RT-PCR, except for the Ag-RDT COVID-19 (Acro Biotech), in which moderate agreement was observed. Lower sensitivity of Ag-RDTs was observed for patients with cycle threshold > 25, indicating that the sensitivity was directly affected by viral load, whereas the effect of the disease duration was unclear. Despite the lower sensitivity of Ag-RDTs compared with RT-qPCR, its easy fulfillment and promptness still justify its use, even at hospital admission. However, the main advantage of Ag-RDTs seems to be the possibility of increasing access to the diagnosis of COVID-19 in patients with a high viral load, allowing immediate clinical management and reduction of infectivity and community transmission."
https://openalex.org/W4282934856,"Galaxy protoclusters, which will eventually grow into the massive clusters we see in the local Universe, are usually traced by locating overdensities of galaxies1. Large spectroscopic surveys of distant galaxies now exist, but their sensitivity depends mainly on a galaxy's star-formation activity and dust content rather than its mass. Tracers of massive protoclusters that do not rely on their galaxy constituents are therefore needed. Here we report observations of Lyman-α absorption in the spectra of a dense grid of background galaxies2,3, which we use to locate a substantial number of candidate protoclusters at redshifts 2.2 to 2.8 through their intergalactic gas. We find that the structures producing the most absorption, most of which were previously unknown, contain surprisingly few galaxies compared with the dark-matter content of their analogues in cosmological simulations4,5. Nearly all of the structures are expected to be protoclusters, and we infer that half of their expected galaxy members are missing from our survey because they are unusually dim at rest-frame ultraviolet wavelengths. We attribute this to an unexpectedly strong and early influence of the protocluster environment6,7 on the evolution of these galaxies that reduced their star formation or increased their dust content."
https://openalex.org/W4282842399,"Repeated application of noxious stimuli leads to a progressively increased pain perception; this temporal summation is enhanced in and predictive of clinical pain disorders. Its electrophysiological correlate is ""wind-up,"" in which dorsal horn spinal neurons increase their response to repeated nociceptor stimulation. To understand the genetic basis of temporal summation, we undertook a GWAS of wind-up in healthy human volunteers and found significant association with SLC8A3 encoding sodium-calcium exchanger type 3 (NCX3). NCX3 was expressed in mouse dorsal horn neurons, and mice lacking NCX3 showed normal, acute pain but hypersensitivity to the second phase of the formalin test and chronic constriction injury. Dorsal horn neurons lacking NCX3 showed increased intracellular calcium following repetitive stimulation, slowed calcium clearance, and increased wind-up. Moreover, virally mediated enhanced spinal expression of NCX3 reduced central sensitization. Our study highlights Ca2+ efflux as a pathway underlying temporal summation and persistent pain, which may be amenable to therapeutic targeting."
https://openalex.org/W4282919167,"Trachoma is the leading infectious disease that leads to blindness worldwide, especially in developing countries. Though Ethiopia had targeted a trachoma elimination program by 2020, the problem worsens, particularly in the Amhara Region. Even though sustained intervention measures are undertaken across the region, it is unclear why trachoma is still a significant public health problem. So, this study assessed the prevalence of active trachoma and associated factors among 1-9 years of age children from model and non-model kebeles in Dangila district Amhara Region, Northwest Ethiopia.A community-based comparative cross-sectional study was conducted from 20th September 2019 to 29th October 2019. A multistage stratified random sampling technique was used to reach 704 children from model and non-model kebeles. Samples were allocated proportionally to model and non-model kebeles. A structured and pretested data collection tool and observational checklist was used to manage the necessary data. Data were coded and entered in Epidata version 4.6, and further analysis was done using SPSS version 20 software. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis was employed to identify factors associated with active trachoma. Adjusted Odds Ratios (AOR), p-value, and respected Confidence Interval (CI) were used to report the findings.Seven hundred four children were included in this study, with a response rate of 97.8%. The overall prevalence of active trachoma was 6% (95% CI: 4.5, 8.1). The prevalence of active trachoma among non-model and model Kebele was not significantly different. Still, the prevalence of active trachoma among children from model Kebele were [4.5%, (95% CI: 2.4%, 7.1%)] relatively lower compared with non-model kebeles, [7.6%, 95% CI: (4.9%, 10.9%)]. Moreover, not using latrine (AOR = 4.29, 95% CI: 1.96, 9.34), fly-eye contact (AOR = 2.59, 95% CI: 1.11, 6.03), presence of sleep in eyes (AOR = 2.46, 95% CI: 1.10, 5.47), presence of ocular discharge (AOR = 2.79, 95% CI: 1.30, 6.00), presence of nasal discharges (AOR = 2.67, 95% CI: 1.21, 5.90) and washing faces with soap (AOR = 0.22, 95% CI: 0.07, 0.69) were found significantly associated with the prevalence of active trachoma among children 1-9 years old.The prevalence of active trachoma in the model and non-model kebeles was high and did not show a statistical difference. Attention to be given to latrine utilization, washing face with soap, and other personal hygiene activities."
https://openalex.org/W4282920519,"The HIV/AIDS pandemic continues to be a major public health concern, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Despite efforts to reduce new infections and deaths with the use of antiretroviral therapy (ART), SSA countries continue to bear the heaviest burden of HIV/AIDS globally, accounting for two-thirds of global new infections. The goal of this review is to identify common barriers to ART adherence as well as common effective interventions that can be implemented across SSA countries to improve ART adherence.A systematic review of published studies on adult HIV-positive patients aged 15 or above, that have assessed the barriers to ART adherence and interventions improving patients' adherence to ART in SSA countries shall be conducted. We will conduct electronic searches for articles that have been published starting from January 2010 onwards. The databases that shall be searched will include Medline Ovid, CINAHL, Embase, and Scopus. The review will include experimental and quasi-experimental studies such as randomized and non-randomized controlled trials as well as comparative before and after studies, and observational studies-cross-sectional studies, cohort studies, prospective and retrospective studies. Two independent reviewers will screen all identified studies, extract data and appraise the methodological quality of the studies using standard critical appraisal tools from the Joanna Briggs Institute. The extracted data will be subjected to a meta-analysis and narrative synthesis.This review will synthesize existing evidence on ART adherence barriers and strategies for improving patient adherence to ART in SSA countries. It will identify common barriers to adherence and common interventions proven to improve adherence across SSA. We anticipate that the findings of this review will provide information policy makers and stakeholders involved in the fight against HIV, will find useful in deriving better ways of not only retaining patients on treatment but having them adhere to their treatment.This protocol has been registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO); registration number CRD42021262256."
https://openalex.org/W4282931747,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive disease with no curative pharmacological treatment. The most used animal model of IPF for anti-fibrotic drug screening is bleomycin (BLM)-induced lung fibrosis. However, several issues have been reported: the balance among disease resolution, an appropriate time window for therapeutic intervention and animal welfare remain critical aspects yet to be fully elucidated. In this study, C57Bl/6 male mice were treated with BLM via oropharyngeal aspiration (OA) following either double or triple administration. The fibrosis progression was longitudinally assessed by micro-CT every 7 days for 4 weeks after BLM administration. Quantitative micro-CT measurements highlighted that triple BLM administration was the ideal dose regimen to provoke sustained lung fibrosis up to 28 days. These results were corroborated with lung histology and Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid cells. We have developed a mouse model with prolonged lung fibrosis enabling three weeks of a curative therapeutic window for the screening of putative anti-fibrotic drugs. Moreover, we have demonstrated the pivotal role of longitudinal micro-CT imaging in reducing the number of animals required per experiment in which each animal can be its own control. This approach permits a valuable decrease in costs and time to develop disease animal models."
https://openalex.org/W4282958590,"Purpose Resilience is defined as the ability to face adversities with positive outcomes. Various scales have been utilized, including 25-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), to evaluate resilience among populations. Resilience research is scarce, particularly in Lebanon as no such scales have been validated. Thus, in the present work, we aimed to assess the psychometric properties of the Arabic version of CD-RISC. Patients and methods The study was conducted at the Women’s Health Center at the American University of Beirut Medical Center among Lebanese women presenting to the obstetrics and gynecology clinics. Internal validity of the Arabic CD-RISC was examined. Pearson’s correlation coefficients between the scores of the Arabic version of CD-RISC and the other related constructs (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Dispositional Hope Scale, Life Orientation Test, and Positive and Negative Affect Schedule) were assessed to evaluate its divergent and convergent validity. We collected responses from a total of 63 Lebanese women. Results The studied scale displayed a high internal consistency. Adequate correlation coefficients were manifested by the significant positive moderate to strong and negative moderate correlations between the Arabic CD-RISC and the other related constructs. Conclusion This is the first study to validate the Arabic version of the CD-RISC in a sample of Lebanese women. The findings of this study provide evidence that the Arabic version of CD-RISC is a reliable and valid tool for the evaluation of resilience among Lebanese women."
https://openalex.org/W4282960502,"Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare disease caused by uncontrolled complement activation; effective and approved treatments include terminal complement inhibition. This study assessed whether combination cemdisiran (an investigational N-acetylgalactosamine-conjugated RNAi therapeutic that suppresses liver production of complement component C5) and pozelimab (an investigational fully human monoclonal antibody against C5) results in more effective and durable complement activity inhibition than the individual agents alone in non-human primates. Cynomolgus monkeys received a single subcutaneous injection of cemdisiran (5 or 25 mg/kg), pozelimab (5 or 10 mg/kg), or combination cemdisiran and pozelimab (5+5 mg/kg, 5+10 mg/kg, or 25+10 mg/kg, respectively). When given in combination, pozelimab was administered 2 weeks after cemdisiran dosing. Pharmacokinetics and ex vivo pharmacodynamic properties were assessed. The half-life of pozelimab alone was 12.9-13.3 days; this increased to 19.6-21.1 days for pozelimab administered in combination with cemdisiran. In ex vivo classical pathway hemolysis assays (CH50), pozelimab + cemdisiran combinations achieved durable and more complete suppression of complement activity (8-13 weeks) vs monotherapy of either agent. Cemdisiran monotherapy demonstrated dose-dependent suppression of total C5 concentrations, with the higher dose (25 mg/kg) achieving >90% maximum suppression. Total C5 concentrations after administration of pozelimab + cemdisiran combinations were similar compared with administration of cemdisiran alone. The combination of pozelimab + cemdisiran mediates complement activity inhibition more efficiently than either pozelimab or cemdisiran administered alone. The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile of combination pozelimab + cemdisiran in non-human primates appears suitable for further clinical investigation as a potential long-acting treatment for PNH and other complement-mediated diseases."

Most medications for treating IBS, including spasmolytics, laxatives, and antidiarrheals, have low efficacy. Effective and safe therapeutic treatments have yet to be developed for IBS.This study assessed the efficacy and safety of a food supplement containing standardized menthol, limonene, and gingerol in human participants with IBS or IBS/functional dyspepsia (FD).A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.We randomly assigned 56 patients with IBS or IBS/FD to an intervention group (Group 1) or control group (Group 2) that were given supplement or placebo, respectively, in addition to the standard treatment regimen for 30 d. Three outpatient visits were conducted during the study. Symptom severity was measured at each visit using a 7×7 questionnaire. Qualitative and quantitative composition of the intestinal microbiota were assessed at visits 1 and 3 based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing.At visit 1 (before treatment), the median total 7×7 questionnaire score was in the moderately ill range for both groups, with no difference between the groups (p = 0.1). At visit 2, the total 7×7 score decreased to mildly ill, with no difference between the groups (p = 0.4). At visit 3, the total score for group 1 indicated borderline illness and for group 2 remained indicated mild illness (p = 0.009). Even though we observed some variations in gut microbiota between the groups, we did not find any statistically significant changes.The food supplement with standardized menthol, limonene, and gingerol content increased the efficacy of standard therapy in IBS and FD patients. The use of the supplement did not cause any obvious side effects.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04484467."
https://openalex.org/W4282966217,"Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) coated with glucose (Glc-SPIONs) were prepared by a new approach called Metal Vapor Synthesis (MVS) and their morphological/structural features were investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering. TEM analysis revealed the presence of small roundish crystalline iron oxide nanoparticles in the organic amorphous phase of glucose, The particles were distributed in a narrow range (1.5 nm—3.5 nm) with a mean diameter of 2.7 nm. The hydrodynamic mean diameter of the Glc-SPIONs, was 15.5 nm. From 4 mg/mL onwards, there was a constant level of positive contrast in a T1-weighted sequence. In vitro experiments were performed in three cell lines: pancreatic cancer (PSN-1), human thyroid cancer (BCPAP), and human embryonic kidney non-tumor cells. We evaluated GLUT1 expression in each cell line and demonstrated that the exposure time and concentration of the Glc-SPIONs we used did not affect cell viability. PSN-1 cells were the most effective at internalizing Glc-SPIONs. Although significantly higher than the control cells, a lower Fe content was detected BCPAP cells treated with Glc-SPIONs. To confirm the involvement of GLUT1 in Glc-SPIONs internalization, cellular uptake experiments were also conducted by pre-treating cancer cells with specific GLUT1 inhibitors, All the inhibitors reduced the cancer cell uptake of Glc-SPIONs In vivo tests were performed on mice inoculated with Lewis lung carcinoma. Mice were treated with a single i.v. injection of Glc-SPION and our results showed a great bioavailability to the malignant tissue by the i.v. administration of Glc-SPIONs. Glc-SPIONs were efficiently eliminated by the kidney. To the best of our knowledge, our study demonstrates for the first time that Glc-SPIONs prepared with MVS can be electively internalized by tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo by exploiting one of the most universal metabolic anomalies of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W4282966358,"Nailfold capillaroscopy is a simple and noninvasive imaging tool to visualize the pattern of capillaries. Microvascular abnormalities have been previously observed in autoimmune disease such as systemic sclerosis and diabetes. Thus, early detection of microvascular dysfunction or changes has promising way for the one of the disease preventions. In this study, for routine health checkups, we evaluated the relationship between the structure of nailfold capillaries and lifestyle habits in healthy participants. First, we analyzed the correlation of structural parameters of nailfold capillaries with values of responses to questions on their lifestyle habits in 224 participants. The results suggested that an unhealthy lifestyle, including poor sleeping habits, smoking, intense exercise, and drinking alcohol, causes a change in the pattern of nailfold capillaries. We then investigated whether the pattern of nailfold capillaries changed after a conscious improvement in lifestyle habits. One to two weeks after the self-improvement of lifestyle habits, the hairpin loops sharpened or straightened. In conclusion, this study is the first report indicating a correlation between the structure of nailfold capillaries and lifestyle habits in a non-clinical population. The simple, inexpensive, and noninvasive method using nailfold microscopy can be employed for routine health checkups everywhere even at a bedside."
https://openalex.org/W4282980963,"The current study aimed to explore the lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA networks associated with alcohol-related esophageal cancer (EC). RNA-sequencing and clinical data were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs, DELs), and miRNAs (DEMs) in patients with alcohol-related and non-alcohol-related EC were identified. Prognostic RNAs were identified by performing Kaplan-Meier survival analyses. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was employed to build the gene modules. The lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks were constructed based on our in silico analyses using data from miRcode, starBase, and miRTarBase databases. Functional enrichment analysis was performed for the genes in the identified ceRNA networks. A total of 906 DEGs, 40 DELs, and 52 DEMs were identified. There were eight lncRNAs and miRNAs each, including ST7-AS2 and miR-1269, which were significantly associated with the survival rate of patients with EC. Of the seven gene modules, the blue and turquoise modules were closely related to disease progression; the genes in this module were selected to construct the ceRNA networks. SNHG12-miR-1-ST6GAL1, SNHG3-miR-1-ST6GAL1, SPAG5-AS1-miR-133a-ST6GAL1, and SNHG12-hsa-miR-33a-ST6GA interactions, associated with the N-glycan biosynthesis pathway, may have key roles in alcohol-related EC. Thus, the identified biomarkers provide a novel insight into the molecular mechanism of alcohol-related EC."
https://openalex.org/W4282982760,"The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted medical care in the US, leading to a significant drop in utilization of some types of health services. We sought to quantify how the pandemic influenced obstetrics and gynecology care at two large health care organizations.Comparing 2020 to 2019, we quantified changes to obstetrics and gynecology care at two large health care organizations in the United States, Allegheny Health Network (in western Pennsylvania) and Johns Hopkins University (in Maryland). The analysis considered the numbers of surgical encounters, in-person visits, and telemedicine visits. For each system, we quantified temporal changes in surgical volume, in-person and telemedicine visits, and financial impact related to professional fee revenues. We used segmented regression to evaluate longitudinal effects.At both institutions, the volume of care was similar in the first few months of 2020 compared to 2019 but dropped precipitously in March 2020. From April to June 2020, surgical volumes were 67% of the same period in 2019 at Allegheny Health and 48% of the same period in 2019 at Johns Hopkins. During that same interval, televisits accounted for approximately 21% of all ambulatory care at both institutions. Although surgical and ambulatory volumes recovered in the second half of 2020, annual surgical volumes in 2020 were significantly lower than 2019 at both institutions (p<0.05) and 2020 ambulatory volumes remained significantly lower at Johns Hopkins (p = .0006). Overall, revenues in 2020 were 91% of 2019 revenues for both institutions.Obstetrical and gynecologic ambulatory visits and gynecologic surgeries were sharply reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although care volumes returned to 2019 levels in late 2020, we observed an overall reduction in the volume of care provided and a 9% reduction in professional revenue for both institutions."
https://openalex.org/W4283010977,"Tissue engineering commonly entails combining autologous cell sources with biocompatible scaffolds for the replacement of damaged tissues in the body. Scaffolds provide functional support while also providing an ideal environment for the growth of new tissues until host integration is complete. To expedite tissue development, cells need to be distributed evenly within the scaffold. For scaffolds with a small diameter tubular geometry, like those used for vascular tissue engineering, seeding cells evenly along the luminal surface can be especially challenging. Perfusion-based cell seeding methods have been shown to promote increased uniformity in initial cell distribution onto porous scaffolds for a variety of tissue engineering applications. We investigate the seeding efficiency of a custom-designed perfusion-based seed-and-culture bioreactor through comparisons to a static injection counterpart method and a more traditional drip seeding method. Murine vascular smooth muscle cells were seeded onto porous tubular electrospun polycaprolactone scaffolds, 2 mm in diameter and 30 mm in length, using the three methods, and allowed to rest for 24 hours. Once harvested, scaffolds were evaluated longitudinally and circumferentially to assess the presence of viable cells using alamarBlue and live/dead cell assays and their distribution with immunohistochemistry and scanning electron microscopy. On average, bioreactor-mediated perfusion seeding achieved 35% more luminal surface coverage when compared to static methods. Viability assessment demonstrated that the total number of viable cells achieved across methods was comparable with slight advantage to the bioreactor-mediated perfusion-seeding method. The method described is a simple, low-cost method to consistently obtain even distribution of seeded cells onto the luminal surfaces of small diameter tubular scaffolds."
https://openalex.org/W4282917596,"Mutation-induced protein misfolding of pancreatic secretory enzymes and consequent endoplasmic reticulum stress can cause chronic pancreatitis. A recent study revealed that cigarette smoke also increases the risk of the disease through endoplasmic reticulum stress. Here, we investigated the cumulative cellular effect of the G233E misfolding human pancreatic lipase variant and hydroquinone; a main toxic constituent of cigarette smoke, using mammalian cell lines. We found that hydroquinone reduces cell viability on a dose-dependent manner through programmed cell death, and diminishes lipase secretion without affecting its expression. Interestingly, hydroquinone decreased the viability more markedly in cells expressing the G233E lipase variant, than in cells producing wild-type lipase. The more substantial viability loss was due to increased endoplasmic reticulum stress, as demonstrated by elevated levels of X-box binding protein 1 mRNA splicing and immunoglobulin binding protein, NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 and C/EBP homologous protein expression. Unresolved endoplasmic reticulum stress, and especially up-regulation of the pro-apoptotic transcription factor C/EBP homologous protein were likely responsible for the increased cell death. Our observations demonstrated that the combination of hydroquinone and misfolding pancreatic lipase variant promote increased levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress and cell death, which may predispose to chronic pancreatitis."
https://openalex.org/W4282919726,"Ardisiae Japonicae Herba (AJH), the dried whole herb of Ardisia japonica (Thunb.) Blume [Primulaceae], has been used in treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in China. However, the material basis and molecular mechanisms of AJH against COPD remain unclear. Therefore, in this study, we attempt to establish a systematic approach to elucidate the material basis and molecular mechanisms through compound identification, network analysis, molecular docking, and experimental validation.Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometry (UPLC-Orbitrap Fusion MS) was used to characterize the chemical compounds of AJH. The SwissTargetPrediction, String and Metascape databases were selected for network pharmacology analysis, including target prediction, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis, GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. Cytoscape 3.7.2 software was used to construct a component-target-pathway network to screen out the main active compounds. Autodock Vina software was used to verify the affinity between the key compounds and targets. TNF-α-stimulated A549 cell inflammation model was built to further verify the anti-inflammatory effects of active compounds.Altogether, 236 compounds were identified in AJH, including 33 flavonoids, 21 Phenylpropanoids, 46 terpenes, 7 quinones, 27 steroids, 71 carboxylic acids and 31 other compounds. Among them, 41 compounds were selected as the key active constituents, which might exhibit therapeutic effects against COPD by modulating 65 corresponding targets primarily involved in inflammation/metabolism/immune-related pathways. The results of molecular docking showed that the key compounds could spontaneously bind to the receptor proteins with a strong binding ability. Finally, the anti-inflammatory effects of the three active compounds were validated with the decreased levels of Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Matrix Metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) in TNF-α-induced A549 cells model.This study clarified that AJH may exert therapeutic actions for COPD via regulating inflammation/immune/metabolism-related pathways using UPLC-Orbitrap Fusion MS technology combined with network pharmacology for the first time. This study had a deeper exploration of the chemical components and pharmacological activities in AJH, which provided a reference for the further study and clinical application of AJH in the treatment of COPD."
https://openalex.org/W4282969871,"While poverty-targeted subsidies have shown promise as a means of reducing financial constraints on low-income populations to invest in new latrines, concerns have been raised about whether they may reduce demand for new latrines among non-eligible, non-poor populations, especially in geographically limited or closed markets. Using quasi experimental methods, we investigate the interaction effects of the “CHOBA” subsidy, a partial poverty-targeted monetary incentive to build a toilet, and a sanitation marketing program (SanMark) on new latrine uptake among households from different income segments in 110 rural villages across six Cambodian provinces. These programs were implemented either jointly with or independently. Overall, we find strong complementarity of the CHOBA subsidy with SanMark where the coupled implementation of the programs increased latrine uptake across all households as compared to exclusive deployment of the programs independently. Additionally, the CHOBA subsidy alone resulted in higher gains among the poor compared to SanMark suggesting that financial constraint is indeed a significant demand barrier for new latrines. The presence of the poverty-targeted subsidies did not reduce demand for new latrine purchases among ineligible households. Instead, we find some evidence for a positive spillover effect of subsidies on uptake of latrines among ineligible households in villages where both programs were implemented indicating that the presence of sanitation subsidies and the decision to purchase latrines among non-beneficiaries can be viewed as complements. We employ multivariate logistic regressions as well as further robustness checks to estimate the effects of the different interventions, with qualitatively consistent results."

https://openalex.org/W4282928610,"Factor quinolinone inhibitors (FQIs), a first-in-class set of small molecule inhibitors targeted to the transcription factor LSF (TFCP2), exhibit promising cancer chemotherapeutic properties. FQI1, the initial lead compound identified, unexpectedly induced a concentration-dependent delay in mitotic progression. Here, we show that FQI1 can rapidly and reversibly lead to mitotic arrest, even when added directly to mitotic cells, implying that FQI1-mediated mitotic defects are not transcriptionally based. Furthermore, treatment with FQIs resulted in a striking, concentration-dependent diminishment of spindle microtubules, accompanied by a concentration-dependent increase in multi-aster formation. Aberrant γ-tubulin localization was also observed. These phenotypes suggest that perturbation of spindle microtubules is the primary event leading to the mitotic delays upon FQI1 treatment. Previously, FQIs were shown to specifically inhibit not only LSF DNA-binding activity, which requires LSF oligomerization to tetramers, but also other specific LSF-protein interactions. Other transcription factors participate in mitosis through non-transcriptional means, and we recently reported that LSF directly binds α-tubulin and is present in purified cellular tubulin preparations. Consistent with a microtubule role for LSF, here we show that LSF enhanced the rate of tubulin polymerization in vitro, and FQI1 inhibited such polymerization. To probe whether the FQI1-mediated spindle abnormalities could result from inhibition of mitotic LSF-protein interactions, mass spectrometry was performed using as bait an inducible, tagged form of LSF that is biotinylated by endogenous enzymes. The global proteomics analysis yielded expected associations for a transcription factor, notably with RNA processing machinery, but also to nontranscriptional components. In particular, and consistent with spindle disruption due to FQI treatment, mitotic, FQI1-sensitive interactions were identified between the biotinylated LSF and microtubule-associated proteins that regulate spindle assembly, positioning, and dynamics, as well as centrosome-associated proteins. Probing the mitotic LSF interactome using small molecule inhibitors therefore supported a non-transcriptional role for LSF in mediating progression through mitosis."

All pregnant women in any trimester of pregnancy within the designated CHC catchment area were recruited. Capillary fasting blood glucose (FBG) and blood glucose (BG) at 1-hour (1-h), and 2-hour (2-h) post oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were measured. TDP was defined as the presence of pre-existing diabetes or diabetes in pregnancy (FBG ≥7.0 mmol/L, or 2-h OGTT ≥11.1 mmol/L, or random BG ≥11.1 mmol/L with diabetes symptoms). Disc and macula-centered retinal photographs were captured to assess diabetic retinopathy (DR). Blood pressure, HbA1c and serum creatinine levels were also measured.A total of 631/664 (95%) eligible pregnant women were included. The median age was 29 (IQR 26-34) years. The prevalence of TDP was 1.1% (95%CI 0.5, 2.3). It was more common in women with chronic hypertension (p = 0.028) and a family history of diabetes (p = 0.015). Among the TDP group, 71% had a high HbA1c, but no DR nor nephropathy were observed.Although a very low prevalence of TDP and no diabetes-related microvascular complications were documented in this population, there is still a need for a screening program for diabetes in pregnancy. Once diabetes has been identified, appropriate management can then be provided to prevent adverse outcomes."

However, adherence to insulin therapy and associated factors among diabetic mellitus (DM) patients are still not studied adequately in Ethiopia. Objective To assess the adherence to insulin therapy and associated factors among type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients on follow-up at Madda Walabu University—Goba Referral Hospital, South East Ethiopia. Method An institution-based, cross-sectional study was employed among 311 both type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients, Madda Walabu University—Goba Referral Hospital from March 4 to April 30, 2020. Study participants were recruited with simple random sampling method. Adherence to insulin therapy was measured by 8-item Morisky medication adherence scale. Therefore from these 8-items, those who score 6 or more are considered as adherent to insulin therapy. The data were collected through interviewer administered questionnaires by trained graduating class nurse students. The data were entered to Epidata version 3.1, and analyzed with SPSS version 25. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with adherence to insulin therapy. Statistical significance were declared at p &lt;0.05. Result A total of 311 patients participate in the study with response rate of 100%. Among these only 38.9% of them were adherent to insulin therapy with a CI of [33.5, 44.3]. Having glucometer (AOR = 3.88; 95% CI [1.46, 10.35]), regular hospital follow-up (AOR = 3.13; 95% CI [1.12, 8.70]), being knowledgeable (AOR = 3.36; 95% CI [1.53, 7.37]), and favorable attitudes (AOR = 4.55; 95%CI [1.68, 12.34]) were the factor associated with adherence to insulin therapy. Conclusion This study concluded that adherence to insulin therapy was low in the study area. Having glucometer, regular hospital follow-up, being knowledgeable, and favorable attitudes were the factor associated with adherence to insulin therapy. Attention should be paid to help diabetic patients on acquiring knowledge regarding the need of consistent adherence to insulin therapy and its complications."
https://openalex.org/W4282979680,"Natural disasters can have devastating and long-lasting effects on a community's emotional well-being. These effects may be distributed unequally, affecting some communities more profoundly and possibly over longer time periods than others. Here, we analyze the effects of four major US hurricanes, namely, Irma, Harvey, Florence, and Dorian on the emotional well-being of the affected communities and regions. We show that a community's emotional response to a hurricane event can be measured from the content of social media that its population posted before, during, and after the hurricane. For each hurricane making landfall in the US, we observe a significant decrease in sentiment in the affected areas before and during the hurricane followed by a rapid return to pre-hurricane baseline, often within 1-2 weeks. However, some communities exhibit markedly different rates of decline and return to previous equilibrium levels. This points towards the possibility of measuring the emotional resilience of communities from the dynamics of their online emotional response."

This study aimed to explore the pathogenesis of pubertal polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and assess the therapeutic effect of electroacupuncture on pubertal PCOS.Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) was used to induce rat models of pubertal PCOS. pubertal rats with PCOS were randomly divided into a model group (M), an electroacupuncture group (EA), and a sham acupuncture group (SA). Age-matched normal rats were regarded as normal controls (N). Rats were treated with EA or SA five times a week for 25 minutes during their 6th-7th week. At the end of the experiment, we observed any changes in ovarian morphology; detected levels of metabolic indices in serum, the hypothalamus and pancreas.EA significantly improved estrous cycle disorders and the ovarian polycystic morphology in pubertal rats with PCOS, but SA only improved disorders of the estrous cycle. The serum levels of insulin, neuropeptide Y(NPY) and fasting blood glucose(FBG) increased significantly (both p < 0.01), while the serum levels of ghrelin(GHRL) decreased in the model group (p < 0.01). After treatment with EA, the levels of NPY (p < 0.01) and FBG (p < 0.05) went into decrease, whereas the levels of GHRL (p < 0.05) and insulin (p < 0.01) increased. There was few differences in the hypothalamic expression of galanin (GAL), galanin-like peptide (GALP) and ghrelin receptor(GHSR) between the four groups. The upregulation of NPY mRNA and neuropeptide Y2 receptor(NPY2R) mRNA and the downregulation of GHRL protein and mRNA in the hypothalamus, and the increased expression of NPY and NPY2R as well as the decreased expression of GHRL in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) can be rescued by EA. But, surprisingly, SA seem to make no difference to the levels of FBG and insulin, and the protein expression of ghrelin in the hypothalamus and ARC. Co-expression of kisspeptin and GHSR, and co-expression of gonadotrophin releasing hormone(GnRH) and NPY2R were observed in ARC. No differences were found between groups in protein of GAL, GALP and GHRL expression in the pancreas. Neither EA nor SA can attenuate the upregulated kisspeptin protein expression in the pancreas of PCOS model rats.EA and SA improved the symptoms of pubertal PCOS rats, and the mechanism might be associated with regulating hypothalamic NPY and ghrelin levels."
https://openalex.org/W4282936366,"PR interval prolongation is a preliminary stage of atrial cardiomyopathy which is considered as an intermediate phenotype for atrial fibrillation (AF). AF is a known risk factor for cerebrovascular adverse outcomes including stroke. Cerebral ischemia is one cause of white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), and cognitive dysfunction.To analyze the relationship between PR interval and WMHs.We performed a cross-sectional analysis with individuals from the LIFE-Adult-Study (a population-based cohort study of randomly selected individuals from Leipzig, Germany) with available brain MRI and ECG. The Fazekas stages were used to quantify WMHs (0 = none; 1 = punctate foci; 2 = beginning confluence; 3 = large confluent areas). Stages 2-3 were defined as advanced WMHs. The PR interval was measured from resting 12-lead ECG. PR duration >200ms was defined as PR interval prolongation. We used a binary logistic regression for statistical analysis. We examined the relationship between MRI and ECG measures and adjusted them for clinical risk factors.We included 2464 individuals (age 59±15 years, 47% women) into analyses. The median PR interval was 160ms (interquartile range 143-179), and 319 (13%) individuals with advanced WMHs, were significantly older, had more cardiovascular comorbidities and risk factors compared to individuals without WMHs (all p<0.005). On univariable analysis, PR interval duration (OR 1.01, 95%CI 1.01-1.02, p≤0.001) and PR interval ≥160 ms (OR 2.1, 95%CI 1.6-2.7, p≤0.001) were associated with advanced WMHs. In multivariable analysis, while PR interval duration was not associated with WMHs in the whole cohort, individuals with PR ≥160ms had higher risk for WMHs.PR interval duration is associated with advanced WMHs beside advanced age, hypertension, and history of stroke. Further research is needed to determine whether changes in PR interval indices are clinically relevant for changes in WMHs."
