https://openalex.org/W2031706219,"CP-96,345 [(2S, 3S)-cis-2-(diphenylmethyl)-N-[(2-methoxyphenyl)- methyl]-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-amine] is a potent nonpeptide antagonist of the substance P (NK1) receptor. CP-96,345 inhibited 3H-labeled substance P binding and was a classical competitive antagonist in the NK1 monoreceptor dog carotid artery preparation. CP-96,345 inhibited substance P-induced salivation in the rat, a classical in vivo bioassay, but did not inhibit NK2, NK3, or numerous other receptors; it is thus a selective NK1 antagonist. This compound may prove to be a powerful tool for investigation of the physiological properties of substance P and exploration of its role in diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2058050336,"CD40 is a 45- to 50-kilodalton transmembrane glycoprotein expressed on B lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and some carcinoma cell lines. Human resting B lymphocytes entered a state of sustained proliferation when incubated with both the mouse fibroblastic Ltk- cell line that had been transfected with the human Fc receptor (Fc gamma RII/CDw32) and monoclonal antibodies to CD40. In combination with interleukin-4, factor-dependent long-term normal human B cell lines were generated that were consistently negative for Epstein-Barr viral infection. Thus, cross-linking of CD40 is likely to represent an important phenomenon in the clonal expansion of B cells."
https://openalex.org/W2077236851,"Antigen is thought to cross-link membrane-bound immunoglobulins (Igs) of B cells, causing proliferation and differentiation or the inhibition of growth. Protein tyrosine kinases are probably involved in signal transduction for cell proliferation and differentiation. The Src-like protein tyrosine kinase Lyn is expressed preferentially in B cells. The Lyn protein and its kinase activity could be coimmunoprecipitated with IgM from detergent lysates. Cross-linking of membrane-bound IgM induced a rapid increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of at least ten distinct proteins of B cells. Thus, Lyn is physically associated with membrane-bound IgM, and is suggested to participate in antigen-mediated signal transduction."

https://openalex.org/W2083327399,"To explore the relationship between keratin gene mutations and genetic disease, we made transgenic mice expressing a mutant keratin in the basal layer of their stratified squamous epithelia. These mice exhibited abnormalities in epidermal architecture and often died prematurely. Blistering occurred easily, and basal cell cytolysis was evidence at the light and electron microscopy levels. Keratin filament formation was markedly altered, with keratin aggregates in basal cells. In contrast, terminally differentiating cells made keratin filaments and formed a stratum corneum. Recovery of outer layer cells was attributed to down-regulation of mutant keratin expression and concomitant induction of differentiation-specific keratins as cells terminally differentiate, and the fact that these cells arose from basal cells developing at a time when keratin expression was relatively low. Collectively, the pathobiology and biochemistry of the transgenic mice and their cultured keratinocytes bore a resemblance to a group of genetic disorders known as epidermolysis bullosa simplex."
https://openalex.org/W1526362532,"To examine the molecular mechanisms by which mechanical stimuli induce cardiac hypertrophy and specific gene expression, we cultured rat neonatal cardiocytes in deformable dishes and imposed an in vitro mechanical load by stretching the adherent cells. Myocyte stretching increased total cell RNA content and mRNA levels of c-fos and skeletal alpha-actin. Nuclear run-off transcription assay revealed that this increase in c-fos mRNA level by stretching at least partially reflects changes in the transcriptional status. The transfected chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene linked to upstream sequences of the fos gene indicated that sequences containing a serum response element were required for efficient transcription by stretching and that sequences containing a cAMP/calcium response element might not be involved in the c-fos response to myocyte stretching. The accumulation of c-fos mRNA by stretching was suppressed by protein kinase C inhibitors at the transcriptional level and inhibited markedly by down-regulation of protein kinase C. Moreover, myocyte stretching increased inositol phosphate levels, and activation of protein kinase C by phorbol esters stimulated the expression of c-fos and skeletal alpha-actin genes. These findings suggest that mechanical stimuli (myocyte stretching) might directly induce cardiac hypertrophy and specific gene expression possibly via protein kinase C activation."
https://openalex.org/W1989392905,"Members of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family of proteins stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of a variety of cell types through receptor-mediated pathways. The three-dimensional structures of two members of this family, bovine acidic FGF and human basic FGF, have been crystallographically determined. These structures contain 12 antiparallel beta strands organized into a folding pattern with approximate threefold internal symmetry. Topologically equivalent folds have been previously observed for soybean trypsin inhibitor and interleukins-1 beta and -1 alpha. The locations of sequences implicated in receptor and heparin binding by FGF are presented. These sites include beta-sheet strand 10, which is adjacent to the site of an extended sequence insertion in several oncogene proteins of the FGF family, and which shows sequence conservation among the FGF family and interleukin-1 beta."
https://openalex.org/W2064258187,"Currents from gap junction channels were recorded from pairs of astrocytes in primary culture using the double whole-cell recording technique. In weakly coupled pairs, single-channel events could be resolved without pharmacological uncoupling treatment. Under these conditions, unitary conductance was 56 ± 7 pS, and except for multiples of this value, no other level of conductance was observed consistently. To characterize the type of junctional protein constituting astrocyte gap junction channels, immunological and biochemical experiments were carried out on the same material. Specific cDNA probes for three connexins identified in mammals (Cx26, Cx32, and Cx43) showed that only Cx43 mRNA was expressed in cultured astrocytes. The presence of Cx43 protein in cultured astrocytes was demonstrated by immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, and immunogold labeling using anti-peptide antibodies specific to Cx43. These results strongly suggest that gap junctions in astrocytes have a 50–60 pS unitary conductance associated with channels composed of Cx43 protein."
https://openalex.org/W2068490834,"The principal neutralizing determinant (PND) of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 resides within the V3 loop of the envelope protein. Antibodies elicited by peptides of this region were able to neutralize diverse isolates. Serum from one of three animals immunized with the human T cell lymphoma virus (HTLV)-IIIMN PND peptide, RP142, neutralized MN and the sequence-divergent HTLV-IIIB isolate. Serum from one of three animals immunized with a 13-amino acid IIIB PND peptide (RP337) also neutralized both of these isolates. Characterization of these sera revealed that the cross-neutralizing antibodies bound the amino acid sequence GlyProGlyArgAlaPhe (GPGRAF) that is present in both isolates. This sequence is frequently found in the PNDs analyzed in randomly selected HIV-1 isolates. Sera from two rabbits immunized with a peptide containing only the GPGRAF residues neutralized divergent isolates, including IIIB and MN."
https://openalex.org/W2004102314,"A hippocampal poly(A) RNA, pADHC-9, was cloned by differential screening of a human hippocampal cDNA library. By RNA blot analysis, pADHC-9 was elevated 2-fold in Alzheimer's disease hippocampus. In situ analyses identified pADHC-9 expression in pyramidal and non-pyramidal cells of the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Nucleotide sequence analysis identified pADHC-9 as a potential human homolog of rat sulfated glycoprotein 2 (SGP-2). SGP-2 expression increased in rat hippocampus following experimental lesions that mimic intrinsic neuronal loss and/or deafferentation. The function of pADHC-9 in brain has not been defined, but in serum, a similar protein inhibits complement-dependent cytolysis. Increased expression of pADHC-9 in Alzheimer's disease hippocampus may be a compensatory response mounted to retard a complement-driven neurodegenerative cascade."
https://openalex.org/W1544469036,"Quinones and related quinonoid substances catalyze redox cycling at an alkaline pH in the presence of excess glycine as reductant. With nitroblue tetrazolium and oxygen present there is concomitant reduction of the tetrazolium to formazan. This property of quinonoid compounds is used for the specific staining of quinoproteins, separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose. The dopa-containing vitelline proteins and the 6-hydroxydopa-containing bovine serum amine oxidase are stained with the nitroblue tetrazolium/glycinate reagent. Also, the mammalian quinoproteins, diamine oxidase and lysyl oxidase, purported to contain pyrroloquinoline quinone, tested positive in this procedure. No quinonoid components were detected in three putative pyrroloquinoline quinone-containing quinoproteins, dopamine beta-hydroxylase, lipoxygenase, and peptidylglycine-amidating monoxygenase. Redox-cycling staining therefore confirms the presence of covalently bound quinones in the copper-dependent amine oxidases, but not in two putative quinoprotein oxygenases. Clarification of the biological significance of quinolation should be facilitated by identification of quinoproteins using this approach."

https://openalex.org/W2042332635,"The Shaker K+ channel belongs to a family of structurally related voltage-activated cation channels that play a central role in cellular electrical signaling. By studying multiple site-directed mutants of the Shaker K+ channel, a region that forms the binding site for a pore-blocking scorpion toxin has been identified. The region contains a sequence that is highly conserved among cloned K+ channels and may contribute to the formation of the ion conduction pore."
https://openalex.org/W1481395580,"The glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex (GP IIb-IIIa) mediates platelet aggregation and is a member of the cytoadhesin family of receptors that bind adhesive proteins such as fibrinogen, fibronectin, and von Willebrand factor. Despite the wide range of cell-substrate interactions mediated by these receptors, ligand binding domains have not yet been identified on any of the integrins. The present study was designed to determine potential fibrinogen binding domain(s) on the GP IIb-IIIa complex. Synthetic peptides derived from residues 1-288 of the amino-terminal portion of GP IIIa were tested for their abilities to block the binding of fibrinogen to purified GP IIb-IIIa in a solid-phase microtiter assay. Two overlapping peptides encompassing residues 204-229 of GP IIIa were identified which blocked fibrinogen binding in this assay. Polyclonal antibodies to these peptides blocked fibrinogen binding to purified GP IIb-IIIa as well as platelet aggregation. The overlapping residues of these two peptides GP IIIa (211-222), SVSRNRDAPEGG-NH2, blocked the binding of fibronectin, von Willebrand factor, and vitronectin to purified GP IIb-IIIa. Finally, direct binding of GP IIIa (204-229) to fibrinogen and fibronectin was demonstrated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We conclude from these studies that the amino acid sequence 211-222 of GP IIIa is critically involved in adhesive protein binding, and may represent an important portion of the GP IIb-IIIa ligand binding domain."

https://openalex.org/W2041936147,"CP-96,345, a nonpeptide substance P antagonist, is selective for the tachykinin NK1 receptor. The compound binds to a single population of sites in guinea pig brain and potently inhibits substance P-induced excitation of locus ceruleus neurons. CP-96,345 should be a useful tool for studying the action of substance P in the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W1607376681,"Endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule 1 is a cell surface glycoprotein expressed by cytokine-activated endothelium that mediates the adhesion of blood neutrophils. Endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule 1 is a member of the selectin family of cell adhesion molecules each of which contain an amino-terminal lectin-like domain, followed by an epidermal growth factor-like domain and a variable number of short consensus repeats similar to those found in complement binding proteins. Genomic clones encoding the ELAM gene were isolated and the organization of the ELAM gene was determined. The gene, which is present in a single copy in the human genome, contains 14 exons spanning about 13 kilobases of DNA. The positions of exon-intron boundaries correlate with the putative functional subdivisions of the protein. Introns are found at similar positions in all of the six complement regulatory repeats, suggesting that these elements arose by internal gene duplication. A consensus TATAA element is located upstream of the transcriptional start site. The ELAM promoter contains an inverted CCAAT box and consensus NF-kappa B- and AP-1-binding sites. The ELAM gene was assigned to the q12 greater than qter region of human chromosome 1 by analysis of human-mouse hybrid cell lines. Two other members of the selectin gene family, the leukocyte adhesion molecule 1 (LAM-1, TQ1, LEC-CAM 1, or Leu-8) and the granule membrane protein 140 (GMP-140, PADGEM, or CD62) have been localized to the long arm of chromosome 1, as have the structurally related complement binding proteins, suggesting that these genes may share a common evolutionary history."
https://openalex.org/W2023602283,"The onset of M phase requires the activation of the pp34 protein kinase in all eukaryotes thus far examined. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, pp34 is phosphorylated on Tyr15, and dephosphorylation of this residue regulates the initiation of mitosis. In this study, it is shown that dephosphorylation of Tyr15 triggered activation of the pp34-cyclin complex from fission yeast, that a human protein-tyrosine phosphatase can catalyze this event both in vitro and in vivo, and that activation of fission yeast pp34 does not require threonine dephosphorylation. The complementary DNA that encoded the tyrosine phosphatase replaced the mitotic activator p80cdc25, closely associating the cdc25(+)-activating pathway with tyrosine dephosphorylation of pp34."
https://openalex.org/W1497244716,"Earlier studies have shown that the major porin species in Pseudomonas aeruginosa outer membrane is protein F (OprF), which produces channels wider than those produced by Escherichia coli porins. In contrast, Yoshihara and Nakae ((1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 6297-6301) reported that protein F has no pore-forming activity as measured by the flux of L-arabinose, and that the channels in P. aeruginosa outer membrane, being produced by proteins C, D, and E, are much narrower than E. coli porin channels. In this study, we followed the protein purification scheme of Yoshihara and Nakae as closely as possible, and found that protein F had a specific activity for pore formation similar to that of proteins D1, D2, and E2. Furthermore, proteoliposome reconstitution assays showed conclusively that the channels formed by protein F, as well as by unfractionated outer membranes, allowed the diffusion of a tetrasaccharide, stachyose, at a significant rate, indicating that these channels are much larger than E. coli porin channels. It appears likely that in the study of Yoshihara and Nakae protein F was inadvertently inactivated during purification. We further suggest a hypothesis that resolves the apparent conflict between the presence of large diameter channels and the low permeability of the outer membrane in P. aeruginosa."
https://openalex.org/W2010980507,"A molecular genetic approach was used to test for a role of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) in learning and memory in Drosophila. We used genes encoding a peptide inhibitor of PKA, an N-terminal regulatory subunit fragment containing a pseudosubstrate inhibitory domain, and a wild-type catalytic subunit. These dominantly acting genes were placed under control of the hsp70 promoter and transformed into wild-type flies. Induction of the transgenes by 1 hr heat shock results in overproduction of their RNA in adult flies. The same heat shock treatment disrupts the ability of the flies to learn in an odor discrimination task reinforced with electric shock. The results demonstrate the involvement of PKA in the associative learning of Drosophila."
https://openalex.org/W1501666754,"PC12 cells contain at least three immunologically distinct phospholipase C (PLC) isozymes, PLC-beta, PLC-gamma, and PLC-delta. Treatment of PC12 cells with nerve growth factor (NGF) leads to an increase in the phosphorylation of PLC-gamma, but not of PLC-beta or PLC-delta. This increase can be seen in as little as 1 minute. The increased phosphorylation occurs on both serine and tyrosine residues, with the major increase being in the former. This result suggests the possibility that the NGF-dependent increase in phosphoinositide hydrolysis in PC12 cells is due to selective phosphorylation of PLC-gamma by serine and tyrosine protein kinases associated with the NGF receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1600727079,"To determine the structure of Amb a I (previously called antigen E), the major allergen from short ragweed, cDNA from pollen was cloned into lambda gt11 and lambda gt10. One of the three distinct clones isolated from the lambda gt11 library by screening with anti-denatured Amb a I antibodies was used to screen both libraries for other Amb a I sequences. Multiple clones were isolated and sequenced and proved to be highly homologous but nonidentical. The clones could be divided into three groups based on sequence similarity, and in accordance with the International Union of Immunological Societies-approved nomenclature (Marsh, D. G., Goodfriend, L., King, T. P., Lowenstein, H., and Platts-Mills, T. A. E. (1986) Bull. WHO 64, 767-770) they have been designated Amb a I.1, Amb a I.2, and Amb a I.3. Clones within a group have greater than 99% identity, and similarity among groups is 85-90% at the nucleotide level. The amino acid sequence of four peptides (isolated from antigen E obtained from the Research Resources Branch of the National Institutes of Health) containing 132 amino acids was identical to one of the clones (Amb a I.1). The presence of multiple naturally occurring isoelectric forms of Amb a I was demonstrated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. Southern blot analysis demonstrates the presence of multiple Amb a I-related sequences in the ragweed genome. Amb a I is therefore not a single molecule but rather a family of closely related proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2036452487,"Transcription of the mouse alpha-fetoprotein gene is activated in the developing fetal liver and gut and repressed in both tissues shortly after birth. With germline transformation in mice, a cis-acting element was identified upstream of the transcription initiation site of the alpha-fetoprotein gene that was responsible for repression of the gene in adult liver. This negative element acts as a repressor in a position-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W1489810714,"Carbovir (the carbocyclic analog of 2'-3'-didehydro-2',3'-dideoxyguanosine) is a potent inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication. Assays were developed to assess the mechanism of inhibition by the 5'-triphosphate of carbovir of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase using either RNA or DNA templates that contain all four natural nucleotides. Carbovir-TP was a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase using either template with Ki values similar to that observed by AZT-TP, ddGTP, and ddTTP. The kinetic constants for incorporation of these nucleotide analogs into DNA by HIV-1 reverse transcriptase using either template were similar to the values seen for their respective natural nucleotides. In addition, the incorporation of either carbovir-TP or AZT-TP in the presence of dGTP or dTTP, respectively, indicated that the mechanism of inhibition by these two nucleotide analogs was due to their incorporation into the DNA resulting in chain termination. Carbovir-TP was not a potent inhibitor of DNA polymerase alpha, beta, or gamma, or DNA primase. Given the potent activity of carbovir-TP against HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and its lack of activity against human DNA polymerases, we believe that further evaluation of this compound as a potential drug for the treatment of HIV-1 infection is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W1601428669,The interaction of two Escherichia coli transcription factors (sigma 54 and sigma 32) with the core RNA polymerase was studied here. We examined the core binding ability of various fragments of these two transcription factors using a novel method for the in vitro synthesis of truncated proteins in a coupled transcription-translation (S-30) system. The method uses DNA templates generated by the polymerase chain reaction to direct synthesis of precisely truncated fragments of the encoded protein. Primers for the polymerase chain reaction contain transcription and translation signals so that the resulting product can be incubated in the S-30 directly. The synthesized proteins were used for mapping of both functional domains and epitopes of monoclonal antibodies to sigma 54 and sigma 32.
https://openalex.org/W1587263644,"We tested the hypothesis that somatostatin (SRIF) inhibits insulin secretion from an SV40 transformed hamster beta cell line (HIT cells) by an effect on the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and examined whether G-proteins were involved in the process. Ca2+ currents were recorded by the whole cell patch-clamp method, the free cytosolic calcium, [Ca2+]i, was monitored in HIT cells by fura-2, and cAMP and insulin secretion were measured by radioimmunoassay. SRIF decreased Ca2+ currents, [Ca2+]i, and basal insulin secretion in a dose-dependent manner over the range of 10(-12)-10(-7)M. The increase in [Ca2+]i and insulin secretion induced by either depolarization with K+ (15 mM) or by the Ca2+ channel agonist, Bay K 8644 (1 microM) was attenuated by SRIF in a dose-dependent manner over the same range of 10(-12)-10(-7) M. the half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for SRIF inhibition of insulin secretion were 8.6 X 10(-12) M and 8.3 X 10(-11) M for K+ and Bay K 8644-stimulated secretion and 1 X 10(-10) M and 2.9 X 10(-10) M for the SRIF inhibition of the K+ and Bay K 8644-induced rise in [Ca2+]i, respectively. SRIF also attenuated the rise in [Ca2+]i induced by the cAMP-elevating agent, isobutylmethylxanthine (1 mM) in the presence of glucose. Bay K 8644, K+ and SRIF had no significant effects on cAMP levels and SRIF had no effects on adenylyl cyclase activity at concentrations lower than 1 microM. SRIF (100 nM) did not change K+ efflux (measured by 86Rb+) through ATP-sensitive K+ channels in HIT cells. SRIF (up to 1 microM) had no significant effect on membrane potential measured by bisoxonol fluorescence. Pretreatment of the HIT cells with pertussis toxin (0.1 microgram/ml) overnight abolished the effects of SRIF on Ca2+ currents, [Ca2+]i and insulin secretion implying a G-protein dependence in SRIF's actions. Thus, one mechanism by which SRIF decreases insulin secretion is by inhibiting Ca2+ influx through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, an action mediated through a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein."

https://openalex.org/W1575456360,"The complete time course of the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate catalyzed by the low molecular weight (acid) phosphotyrosyl protein phosphatase from bovine heart was elucidated and analyzed in detail. Burst titration kinetics were demonstrated for the first time with this class of enzyme. At pH 7.0, 4.5 degrees C, a transient pre-steady-state of p-nitrophenol was formed with a rate constant of 48 s-1. The burst was effectively stoichiometric and corresponded to a single enzyme active site/molecule. The burst was followed by a slow steady-state turnover of the phosphoenzyme intermediate with a rate constant of 1.2 s-1. Product inhibition studies indicated an ordered uni-bi kinetic scheme for the hydrolysis. Partition experiments conducted for several substrates revealed a constant product ratio. Vmax was constant for these substrates, and the overall rate of hydrolysis was increased greatly in the presence of alcohol acceptors. An enzyme-catalyzed 18O exchange between inorganic phosphate and water was detected and occurred with kcat = 4.47 x 10(-3) s-1 at pH 5.0, 37 degrees C. These results were all consistent with the existence of a phosphoenzyme intermediate in the catalytic pathway and with the breakdown of the intermediate being the rate-limiting step. The true Michaelis binding constant Ks = 6.0 mM, the apparent Km = 0.38 mM, and the rate constants for phosphorylation (k2 = 540 s-1) and dephosphorylation (k3 = 36.5 s-1) were determined under steady-state conditions with p-nitrophenyl phosphate at pH 5.0 and 37 degrees C in the presence of phosphate acceptors. The energies of activation for the enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis at pH 5.0 and 7.0 were 13.6 and 14.1 kcal/mol, respectively. The activation energy for the enzyme-catalyzed medium 18O exchange between phosphate and water was 20.2 kcal/mol. Using the available equilibrium and rate constants, an energetic diagram was constructed for the enzyme-catalyzed reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1488934481,"The inhibitory glycine receptor (GlyR) in mammalian spinal cord displays pharmacological and molecular heterogeneity of its strychnine binding alpha subunit. Here, cDNAs were isolated which encode a variant (alpha ins 1) of the rat GlyR alpha 1 subunit that contains eight additional amino acids in its putative cytoplasmic domain. Analysis of the corresponding genomic sequence showed that alpha ins 1 transcripts result from alternative splice acceptor site selection. S1 nuclease protection experiments, Northern blot analysis, and RNA amplification by polymerase chain reaction revealed alpha 1 and alpha ins 1 mRNA in postnatal spinal cord, but not in other brain regions. Expression of synthetic alpha ins 1 RNA in Xenopus oocytes generated glycine-gated strychnine-sensitive chloride channels. These data indicate that alternative splicing contributes to GlyR alpha subunit heterogeneity in the mammalian central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2016582329,"Phorbol esters and purified protein kinase C (PKC) have been shown to down-modulate the voltage-dependent Na+ channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes injected with chick brain RNA. We used the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique to demonstrate that a Na+ channel expressed in oocytes injected with RNA coding for the alpha subunit of the channel alone (VA200, a variant of rat brain type IIA) is also inhibited by PKC activation. The inhibition of Na+ currents, expressed in oocytes injected with either alpha subunit RNA (rat) or total brain RNA (chick), is voltage-dependent, being stronger at negative potentials. It appears to result mainly from a shift in the activation curve to the right and possibly a decrease in the steepness of the voltage dependence of activation. There is little effect on the inactivation process and maximal Na+ conductance. Thus, PKC modulates the Na+ channel by a mechanism involving changes in voltage-dependent properties of its main, channel-forming alpha subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1569117848,"Tumor cell attachment to thrombospondin (TSP) in the extracellular matrix may be of critical importance in the processes of invasion and hematogenous dissemination. To determine the specific receptor systems that mediate the interaction of tumor cells with insoluble TSP, the attachment of HT1080 fibrosarcoma and C32 and G361 melanoma cells to TSP-coated discs was studied in the presence of heparin, Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser, or antibodies to glycoprotein (GP) IV (CD36, GPIIIb), a TSP receptor. HT1080 and C32 cell attachment to TSP was inhibited by the combination of heparin and a monoclonal (or polyclonal) antibody to GPIV but not by either alone. Heparin alone inhibited cell spreading. Neither control monoclonal antibodies nor the cell attachment peptide Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser inhibited tumor cell attachment to TSP, alone or in the presence of heparin. HT1080 cells attached equally as well to a 140-kDa proteolytic TSP fragment lacking the heparin-binding domain as to intact TSP. A monoclonal antibody to GPIV alone inhibited tumor cell attachment to the heparin-domainless 140-kDa TSP fragment. No attachment to the heparin-binding fragment was observed, but the addition of the heparin fragment to 140-kDa heparin-domainless TSP restored the heparin sensitivity of binding. G361 cells that lack GPIV attached well to TSP but were not inhibited by heparin or anti-GPIV alone or in combination. The combination of heparin and Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser inhibited G361 attachment to TSP. These studies suggest that tumor cells may utilize separate receptor systems in a cooperative manner to adhere to TSP. HT1080 fibrosarcoma and C32 melanoma cells utilize GPIV in concert with a heparin-modulated binding systems to attach and spread on TSP. G361 cells, which lack GPIV expression, attach and spread on TSP using an integrin system as well as a heparin-modulated system."
https://openalex.org/W1491481694,"Grass pollen allergens are one of the major causes of type I allergic reactions (allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, allergic bronchial asthma, and hayfever) in temperate climates afflicting 15-20% of a genetically predisposed population. Workers have found considerable physico- and immunochemical heterogeneity within the grass pollen allergens which has made them difficult to purify for both therapeutic uses and further biochemical study. We recently reported the construction of a cDNA library in lambda gt11 using mRNA extracted from dehydrated Kentucky bluegrass (KBG, Poa pratensis). Here, we present the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences for three KBG pollen allergen cDNA clones, KBG 41, 60, and 31, which were isolated from the above library using a pool of six sera from grass pollen allergic patients. These clones exhibit an exceptionally high degree of sequence similarity to one another, only minor similarity to other known allergens, and no homologies to other known proteins or genes. The predicted molecular mass for the cloned proteins range from 28.3 to 37.8 kDa with pI values of 9.6-10.2. All three clones appear to possess leader peptides and lack asparagine sequons required for N-glycosylation. Therefore, the molecular mass of the post-translationally modified proteins were calculated to be 28.4-34.9 kDa, which is consistent with the size of the polypeptides revealed in Western blots of pollen proteins using an antiserum to a recombinant peptide encoded by the partial cDNA clone KBG 8.3. Northern blotting analysis indicates that expression of the genes corresponding to these clones is confined to pollen tissue. The results suggest that the clones code for a group of proteins that represent a new and previously uncharacterized group of grass pollen isoallergens, which have been hereby designated as Poa p IX."
https://openalex.org/W1551359041,"We previously found that L6 myoblasts and skeletal muscle isolated from developing rats express the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) beta-receptor gene (Jin, P., Rahm, M., Claesson-Welsh, L., Heldin, C.-H., and Sejersen, T. (1990) J. Cell Biol. 110, 1665-1672). We now report that recombinant human PDGF-BB is a mitogen for L6 myoblasts and also a potent inhibitor of myogenic differentiation. Treatment of L6J1 myoblasts with PDGF-BB increased the rate of DNA synthesis and stimulated cell proliferation. In differentiation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/0.5% fetal calf serum or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/insulin), PDGF-BB prevented fusion of confluent myoblasts and suppressed biochemical differentiation in L6J1 cells. Inhibition of myoblast differentiation was, however, reversible. Withdrawal of PDGF-BB from the medium allowed myoblast fusion to occur. Northern blot hybridization showed that the PDGF beta-receptor mRNA was down-regulated to an undetectable level when confluent cultures of L6J1 myoblasts in growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/5% fetal calf serum) were shifted to differentiation medium. Receptor binding assays further indicated that binding of PDGF-BB to its receptors on L6J1 myoblasts declined rapidly before creatine kinase activity rose. Our results provide the first demonstration that PDGF-BB is a potent regulator of myogenesis of L6 rat myoblasts and suggest that it may regulate muscle differentiation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1548879738,"Abstract The localization of several GTP-binding regulatory proteins in teh apical membrane of intestinal epithelial cells has prompted us to investigate a possible role for G-proteins as modulators of apical Cl- channels. In membrane vesicles isolated from rat small intestine or human HT29-cl.19A colon carcinoma cells, the entrapment of guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiophosphate (GTP gamma S) led to a large increase in Cl- conductance, as evidenced by an increased 125I- uptake and faster SPQ quenching. The enhancement was observed in the presence, but not in the absence of the K+ ionophore valinomycin, indicating that the increased Cl- permeability is not secondary to the opening of K+ channels. The effect of GTP gamma S was counteracted by guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiophosphate (GDP beta S) and appeared to be independent of cytosolic messengers, including ATP, cAMP, and Ca2+, suggesting that protein phosphorylation and/or phospholipase C activation is not involved. Patch clamp analysis of apical membrane patches of HT29-cl.19A colonocytes revealed a GTP gamma S-activated, inwardly rectifying, anion-selective channel with a unitary conductance of 20 +/- 4 pS. No spontaneous channel openings were observed in the absence of GTP gamma S, while the open time probability (Po) increases dramatically to 0.81 +/- 0.09 upon addition with GTP gamma S. Since the electrophysiological characteristics and regulatory properties of this channel are markedly different from those of the more widely studied cAMP/protein kinase A-operated channel, we propose the existence of a separate Cl(-)-selective ion channel in the apical border of intestinal epithelial cells. Our results suggest an alternative regulatory pathway in transepithelial salt transport and a possible site for anomalous channel regulation as observed in cystic fibrosis patients."
https://openalex.org/W1546392304,"A protein tyrosine kinase has been purified from the particulate fraction of bovine spleen to a specific activity of 0.217 mumol/min/mg at 100 microM ATP and 3 mM [Val5] angiotensin II. Both the angiotensin phosphorylation activity and immunoreactivity towards an antibody preparation raised against a synthetic peptide containing the autophosphorylation site of pp60c-src, Cys-src(403-421), were monitored during the purification. The purified sample displayed three closely spaced protein bands with molecular weights of 50-55 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. All bands could be phosphorylated exclusively on tyrosine residues under autophosphorylation conditions. All reacted on immunoblots with an antibody raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the consensus autophosphorylation site of members of the pp60c-src family of tyrosine kinases. Tryptic phosphopeptide maps of the three proteins were essentially indistinguishable. The results suggest that the purified enzyme preparation contained mainly three closely related pp60c-src-family protein tyrosine kinases or a pp60src-family protein tyrosine kinase modified posttranslationally to give three closely spaced protein bands on sodium dodecyl sulfate gel. Neither of these proteins appears to be pp60c-src or p56lck. The spleen protein tyrosine kinase was found to phosphorylate a p34cdc2 kinase peptide, Cys-cdc2(8-20), which contained the regulatory tyrosine residue Tyr-15 about 20 times better than [Val5]angiotensin II or Cys-src(403-421) peptide at a peptide substrate concentration of 1 mM. In contrast, epidermal growth factor receptor kinase partially purified from A431 cells did not show preference for Cys-cdc2(8-20) as its substrate. Although Cys-cdc2(8-20) contained two tyrosine residues, only the tyrosine corresponding to Tyr-15 in p34cdc2 was phosphorylated by the spleen tyrosine kinase. The observation suggests that the primary structure surrounding Tyr-15 of p34cdc2 contains substrate structural determinants specific for the spleen tyrosine kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1548607979,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) cooperates with glucocorticoids, activators of adenylate cyclase, and lithium to induce the expression of teh gene encoding the neuropeptides neurotensin and neuromedin N (NT/N gene) in PC 12 pheochromocytoma cells. High level expression requires simultaneous treatment with three or all four inducers. To examine the mechanism underlying this complex synergism, we have examined the effects of protein kinase inhibitors and other agents which influence intracellular signal transduction on NT/N gene expression. Two structurally similar bacterial alkaloids, staurosporine and K-252a, inhibit several protein kinases in vitro, including protein kinase C and cyclic nucleotide-dependent kinases. K-252a has been reported to specifically inhibit the effects of NGF on PC12 pheochromocytoma cells. Surprisingly, staurosporine in combination with other inducers markedly potentiated NT/N gene expression. In contrast, K-252a had no effect on NT/N gene expression when added simultaneously with other inducers. Expression of the NT/N gene was also potentiated by the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, which directly activates protein kinase C, and by bradykinin, which stimulates phosphatidylinositol turnover in PC12 cells, and these effects were not blocked by staurosporine. Staurosporine was generally more effective in stimulating NT/N gene expression when used in inducer combinations that did not include NGF. These results, taken together with recent evidence that staurosporine is also able to induce neurite outgrowth from PC12 cells, suggest that the effects of staurosporine and NGF may converge, in part, on a common intracellular target."
https://openalex.org/W1552297297,"To examine if there are common physicochemical features among antibodies binding the same antigenic region of a protein, B cell hybridomas were prepared against the two major antigenic regions on mammalian cytochromes c, and the nucleotide sequences encoding the monoclonal antibody (mAb) heavy (H) and light (L) chains were determined and compared. Although the genetic elements used were somewhat diverse, similarities among mAbs to a given antigenic region were observed. In particular, mAbs binding in a region situated at a bend in the antigen around residues 44 and 47 had longer complementarity-determining regions (4-5 additional amino acid residues in L1 and 1-2 in H3) than mAbs binding the other region around residues 60 and 62 located on a relatively flat surface. These observations indicate that the topography of an antigenic site and the lengths of certain complementarity-determining regions are important physicochemical properties determining, at least in part, which antibodies (B cells) will participate in an immune response to a particular site on a protein antigen."
https://openalex.org/W2282277420,"A structural and functional homologue of vertebrate alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) has been identified in the hemolymph and blood cells of the arthropod Limulus polyphemus, one of the oldest living fossil invertebrates (Quigley, J. P., and Armstrong, P. B. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 12715-12719). The subunit molecular mass is 185 kDa. The native molecular mass, determined by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) under conditions in which the linear relationship between the STEM large angle detector signal and specimen mass thickness allows the determination of the total macromolecular mass, was 354 +/- 35 kDa. Sedimentation equilibrium measurements gave a value of 366 kDa, independent of solute concentration. Sedimentation velocity experiments indicated a homogeneous component with a frictional ratio of 1.41. Thus, the native structure appears to be a dimer, with a somewhat extended conformation. The behavior during gel permeation chromatography was anomalous, yielding an apparent molecular mass approximately half-way between that expected for the dimeric and tetrameric configurations. Transmission electron microscopy of negatively stained preparations revealed a dimeric butterfly-like structure that collapsed following reaction with chymotrypsin."
https://openalex.org/W1594415132,"A soluble derivative of the human insulin receptor cytoplasmic domain, as expressed in insect cells via a Baculovirus vector, is an active protein-tyrosine kinase. In the present study, we find that three forms of the enzyme (48, 43, and 38 kDa) can be partially purified by MonoQ fast protein liquid chromatography. Two-dimensional thin layer phosphopeptide mapping reveals that the 48-kDa enzyme undergoes a rapid autophosphorylation on the same tyrosines (residues 1158, 1162, 1163, 1328, and 1334) that have previously been shown to be major autophosphorylation sites on the native insulin receptor beta-subunit in intact cells. Furthermore, the 48- and 43-kDa proteins are phosphorylated on serine residues by a serine kinase(s) that copurifies through MonoQ fast protein liquid chromatography. Tyrosine autophosphorylation sites 1328 and 1334 and virtually all serine phosphorylation sites are absent in the 38-kDa kinase. Partial tryptic proteolysis of the 48-kDa kinase generates a core 38-kDa enzyme that undergoes autophosphorylation almost exclusively on tyrosines 1158, 1162, and 1163. Phosphorylation of these tyrosine residues occurs in a cascade manner analogous to that found in the intact insulin receptor beta-subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1851008355,"Although reverse transcriptase has been the subject of intensive investigation, minimal information is available regarding the physical properties of the enzyme. The basic hydrodynamic properties of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase in solution were measured by both sedimentation velocity and equilibrium measurements in two buffer systems. In a 0.3 M potassium phosphate buffer system, pH 7.8, the enzyme sedimented as a homogenous particle with a sedimentation coefficient of (7.1 +/- 0.3) S with a weight-average molecular weight, Mw, of (1.52 +/- 0.05) x 10(5). Since the enzyme consists of an alpha and beta subunit of equal molar ratio with Mw of 6.3 x 10(4) and 9.4 x 10(4), respectively, it was concluded that the enzyme exists as an alpha beta heterodimer in this buffer system. In a Tris buffer system, pH 7.9, containing 0.46 M NaCl and 4% glycerol, the native enzyme also sedimented as a homogeneous particle with an apparent sedimentation coefficient of (10.1 +/- 0.5) S, without considering the effect of glycerol on solvent-protein interaction. Based on the results of Gekko and Timasheff (Gekko, K., and Timasheff, S. N. (1981) Biochemistry 20, 4667-4676) and the polarity of the enzyme, it was estimated that there is significant solvent-protein interaction even at 4% glycerol leading to a value of -0.06 g/g in the preferential solvent interaction parameter. When the solvent effect was taken into consideration, the value for s020,w increased from 10.1 to 11.9 S, implying that the native enzyme dimerizes in the presence of 4% glycerol. The combined results of gel filtration and sedimentation velocity showed that the dimerization of the enzyme to form (alpha beta)2 is favored at 20 degrees C with the alpha beta form predominating at 4 degrees C. The secondary structure of the reverse transcriptase was measured by circular dichroism. Results showed that the enzyme consists of (16 +/- 2)% alpha-helix, (24 +/- 2)% beta-sheet, (24 +/- 2)% beta-turn, and (36 +/- 4)% undefined structures."
https://openalex.org/W1556683497,"Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infection in vitro has been analyzed by the kinetics of expression of HIV-1 RNA and antigens during treatment with antiviral agents. Intracellular HIV-1 RNA rose from input values of 15 molecules per cell to 28 molecules per cell within 3 h after infection and reached a peak of 13,125 in 5 days. The first detectable increase in levels of HIV-1 capsid protein production was 1 day after infection. Virus infection was interrupted at different time points by the introduction of either 2',3'-dideoxycytidine, 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine, or suramin to block reverse transcription, or recombinant soluble CD4 to block binding and re-entry of progeny virus. Two results are noteworthy. First, the three inhibitors of reverse transcription blocked viral expression when added up to 48 h after infection. Second, the extent of infection, although postponed, is not greatly altered by culture of infected cells in recombinant soluble CD4. These data imply that reinfection with progeny virus, while necessary for rapid virus expression, is not required for the establishment of productive HIV-1 infection."
https://openalex.org/W1554693762,"The structural genes of the ilvGMEDA operon of Escherichia coli are preceded by two promoters, ilvPG1 and ilvPG2, and a leader-attenuator region. Alkylation protection and hydroxyl radical footprinting techniques have been used to demonstrate that integration host factor (IHF) interacts with the nucleotides in a consensus-like DNA sequence located immediately downstream of the RNA polymerase transcriptional pause site in the leader-attenuator region. In the presence of purified IHF protein, in vitro transcriptional pausing of RNA polymerase at the leader-attenuator pause site is increased 2-fold and, concomitantly, a 2-fold increase in transcriptional termination at the attenuator is observed. Strains containing chromosomal transcriptional fusions of various segments of the ilvGMEDA promoter-attenuator region to the galK gene were used to show that IHF also decreases the in vivo basal level of transcriptional readthrough at the attenuator 2-fold. The binding of IHF to another target site in the ilvPG1 promoter region represses transcription from this promoter and causes a 4-fold stimulation of transcription initiation from the downstream ilvPG2 promoter 4-fold. This IHF-mediated control of transcription initiation from the upstream promoter region is independent of the regulation of transcription termination effected by IHF interaction at the attenuator site. Thus, IHF is capable of regulating the expression of the ilvGMEDA operon in opposing manners; it can activate transcription initiation of this operon from the ilvPG2 promoter 4-fold and increase the termination of this transcription at the downstream attenuator 2-fold."
https://openalex.org/W2084421427,"We have developed a partial kinetic theory for the gating of murine nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) expressed in Xenopus oocytes and have used this theory to characterize the role of the gamma subunit in single-channel behavior. Permeation and gating were found to be largely unaffected in AChRs produced in oocytes when the gamma subunit transcript was omitted from microinjections of AChR subunit RNAs. In contrast, marked changes in gating kinetics resulted when even very conservative single amino acid substitutions were introduced into the gamma subunit, indicating that the gamma subunit can have a large effect on AChR gating. We also found that channel openings were much prolonged when murine AChRs were expressed in BC3H-1 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1606714223,Plasmids were constructed that contain deletions in the stem region of the presumed rho-independent terminator of the cloned crp gene of Escherichia coli. The level of cyclic AMP binding activity and the amount of CRP in cells harboring the deletion plasmids were found to be significantly lower than those in cells harboring the wild-type crp plasmid. Quantitative S1 assays indicated that the steady-state levels of crp mRNA were markedly reduced in cells harboring the deletion plasmids. Evidence was also presented to show that the crp mRNAs produced from deletion plasmids are less stable than that from the intact crp gene. In vitro transcription assays revealed that the putative crp terminator is indeed a rho-independent terminator. Using the galK expression system and Northern blot analysis we showed that the crp terminator is functional in vivo. Moreover it was shown that the deletion mutations in the stem region of the crp terminator cause a significant readthrough. We conclude that the 3'-flanking sequence of the crp gene acts to stabilize its own mRNA as well as to terminate transcription.
https://openalex.org/W1577053688,"We have investigated insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I and IGF-II binding to bovine insulin-like growth factor binding protein-2 (bIGFBP-2) using chemical modification to locate sites on the IGF involved in the binding interaction. bIGFBP-2 was incubated with either recombinant human (hIGF-I) or purified ovine (oIGF-II) to form a mixture of bound and free IGF. Sites of interaction between the binding protein and IGF were then probed by iodination of the available tyrosine residues. Subsequently, the mixture of free IGF and IGF.bIGFBP-2 complex was resolved by neutral chromatography, and the IGF component of the complex with bIGFBP-2 was recovered by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography at pH 2.1. The tyrosine labeling patterns of the two populations of IGF, one iodinated while free and the other iodinated while associated with binding protein, were determined following endoproteinase Glu-C peptide mapping. Binding of hIGF-I or oIGF-II to bIGFBP-2 resulted in reduced iodination of the tyrosines in both hIGF-I and oIGF-II that are near the carboxyl-terminal, Tyr-60 and Tyr-59, respectively. The reduction in labeling of these tyrosine residues was 2-fold and 6-fold for hIGF-I and oIGF-II, respectively. On the other hand, labeling of the other 2 tyrosines in hIGF-I and oIGF-II was not different between the free and complexed growth factors. From these results we conclude that Tyr-60 and Tyr-59 in the carboxyl-terminal regions of hIGF-I and oIGF-II, respectively, are either directly involved in the binding reaction or lie in a region of the IGF molecule encompassed by the association with bIGFBP-2. Conversely, the labeling pattern of the other tyrosines, Tyr-24 and Tyr-31 in hIGF-I and Tyr-2 and Tyr-27 in oIGF-II, implies that they are not involved in binding to bIGFBP-2. To examine the role of IGF tyrosine residues in the association with bIGFBP-2, we prepared nonradioactive 127I-labeled oIGF-II. In bIGFBP-2 competition binding assays, 127I-labeled oIGF-II was 2.5-fold and 5-fold less potent than native oIGF-II when competing for binding of 125I-labeled IGF-I or IGF-II tracers, respectively. We interpret these results as indicating that at least 1 tyrosine in oIGF-II is involved in binding to bIGFBP-2."
https://openalex.org/W1505706331,"A low molecular weight antigen of Mycobacterium leprae and other mycobacteria was previously defined in our laboratory by means of IgG2a monoclonal antibody termed L4. The antigen had an apparent molecular mass of 4.5-6 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and was assumed to be a glycoprotein on the basis of its staining with periodic acid Schiff and sensitivity to periodate treatment. In the present work, the cross-reactive and phospholipidic nature of the antigen, present in Mycobacterium tuberculosis as well as in M. leprae sonicates, was demonstrated and this enabled us to undertake its purification from crude M. tuberculosis phospholipidic extracts. The L4-reactive antigen from M. tuberculosis called L4-PIM, was purified by means of silicic acid high pressure liquid chromatography. Its characterization by gas chromatography and FAB-MS showed the antigen to be the common mycobacterial dimannosylated phosphatidylinositol (PIM2), the structure of which had been previously established by others (Lee, Y. C., and Ballou, C. E. (1964) J. Biol. Chem. 239, 1316-1327; Lee, Y. C., and Ballou, C. E. (1965) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 4, 1395-1404). Delineation of the L4 epitope on M. tuberculosis L4-PIM revealed the involvement of the axial 2-hydroxyl of the alpha-D-mannosyl residues, without any detectable contribution from the myo-inositol. Consequently, L4 was shown to react with PIM5, the structure of which contains twice the number of epitopes as does PIM2. By using both immunostained thin layer chromatography and indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, similar L4-PIM epitopes were demonstrated in M. leprae sonicate, thereby explaining the cross-reactive nature of the L4-monoclonal antibody. Antibodies of IgG class directed against M. tuberculosis L4-PIM were detectable in sera from patients with leprosy, but no evidence of T cell reactivity to L4-PIM was obtained. The demonstration of a correlation of anti-L4-PIM IgG and anti-disacharide-conjugated bovine serum albumin IgM antibody titers in the sera of leprosy patients indicates that measurement of antibodies directed against L4-PIM may have the potential to be used as a complementary assay to the disaccharide-conjugated bovine serum albumin test for diagnosis and monitoring of patients undergoing leprosy therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1552099856,"Two monoclonal antibodies (mAb), directed toward different epitopes of Escherichia coli ribosomal protein L2, have been used as probes in immune electron microscopy. mAb 5-186 recognizes an epitope within residues 5-186 of protein L2; it is seen to bind to 50 S subunits at or near the peptidyl transferase center, beside the subunit head on the L1 shoulder. mAb 187-272 recognizes an epitope within residues 187-272. This antibody binds to the face of the 50 S subunit, below the head and slightly toward the side with the stalk; this site is near the translocation domain. Both antibodies can bind simultaneously to single subunits. This indicates that protein L2 is elongated, reaching from the peptidyl transferase center to below the subunit head and approaching the translocational domain. The different locations of the two epitopes are consistent with previous biochemical results with the two antibodies (Nag, B., Tewari, D. S., Etchison, J. R., Sommer, A., and Traut, R. R. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 13892-13897)."
https://openalex.org/W1484337529,"It has been reported that small cytoplasmic RNA (scRNA) from human placenta inhibits translation of most mRNAs in both wheat germ extracts and reticulocyte lysates (Lorberboum, H., Digweed, M., Erdmann, V. A., Servadio, Y., Weinstein, D., De Groot, N., and Hochberg, A. A. (1986) Eur. J. Biochem. 155, 279-287). We have investigated the mechanism by which scRNA preparations inhibit mRNA translation in vitro. We demonstrate that the inhibitory agent(s) is not sensitive to treatment with various ribonucleases but that translational inhibition is sensitive to incubation with 1 N NaOH at 95 degrees C or to treatment with heparinase. Based on these findings and on the ability of heparin to inhibit cell-free translation by itself, we conclude that the presence of heparin in preparations of scRNA from human placenta is responsible for effects which have previously been attributed to inhibitory RNA molecules. Since heparin is also frequently used in the isolation of translationally inhibitory scRNAs from other sources, we suggest that the sensitivity of these preparations to ribonucleases and heparinase should be examined."
https://openalex.org/W1552267317,"The addition of oxygen to anaerobic rat liver mitochondria incubated at 15 degrees C in the absence of permeant cations produced negligible rapid H+ ejection, monitored spectroscopically with phenol red, which corresponded kinetically to the rise in delta psi, as monitored by merocyanine 540. Slow H+ translocation was observed under these conditions during the aerobic phase, the extent of which was proportional to the amount of oxygen added and the rate dependent on the rate of counter-ion movement. Measurement of H+ disappearance in the mitochondrial matrix, as monitored by neutral red, likewise showed little or no rapid H+ change in the absence of counter-ion movements. In the presence of permeant cations, the H+ disappearance in the matrix was readily measured. This observation argues against the importance of the mitochondrial outer membrane and intermembrane space in masking H+ movements. The H+ translocation required in the generation of maximal or static head delta psi was determined by following the spectral response of merocyanine to increasing oxygen additions. The amount of oxygen giving maximal Delta psi corresponds to an extrusion of 2-3 ng ions of H+ . mg of protein-1. The absence of H+ movement of near this magnitude during the development of the Delta psi argues against the Delta psi-driven backflow of H+ ions as the sole explanation of these observations."
