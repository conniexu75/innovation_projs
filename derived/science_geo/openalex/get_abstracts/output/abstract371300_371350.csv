In order to map genomic contacts, Lieberman-Aiden et al. (p. 289 , see the cover) developed a technique to allow the detection of all interactions between genomic loci in the eukaryotic nucleus followed by deep sequencing. This technology was used to map the organization of the human genome and to examine the spatial proximity of chromosomal loci at one megabase resolution. The map suggests that the genome is partitioned into two spatial compartments that are related to local chromatin state and whose remodeling correlates with changes in the chromatin state."

This paper now uses diffusion tensor imaging to demonstrate structural white-matter changes when adults practice juggling. Although experience-dependent structural changes have been found in adult gray matter, there is little evidence for such changes in white matter. Using diffusion imaging, we detected a localized increase in fractional anisotropy, a measure of microstructure, in white matter underlying the intraparietal sulcus following training of a complex visuo-motor skill. This provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first evidence for training-related changes in white-matter structure in the healthy human adult brain."
https://openalex.org/W2163977673,"Bacterial 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) amplicons have been widely used in the classification of uncultured bacteria inhabiting environmental niches. Primers targeting conservative regions of the rDNAs are used to generate amplicons of variant regions that are informative in taxonomic assignment. One problem is that the percentage coverage and application scope of the primers used in previous studies are largely unknown. In this study, conservative fragments of available rDNA sequences were first mined and then used to search for candidate primers within the fragments by measuring the coverage rate defined as the percentage of bacterial sequences containing the target. Thirty predicted primers with a high coverage rate (>90%) were identified, which were basically located in the same conservative regions as known primers in previous reports, whereas 30% of the known primers were associated with a coverage rate of <90%. The application scope of the primers was also examined by calculating the percentages of failed detections in bacterial phyla. Primers A519–539, E969–983, E1063–1081, U515 and E517, are highly recommended because of their high coverage in almost all phyla. As expected, the three predominant phyla, Firmicutes, Gemmatimonadetes and Proteobacteria, are best covered by the predicted primers. The primers recommended in this report shall facilitate a comprehensive and reliable survey of bacterial diversity in metagenomic studies."
https://openalex.org/W2151220680,"The combined activity of three transcription factors can reprogram adult cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). However, the transgenic methods used for delivering reprogramming factors have raised concerns regarding the future utility of the resulting stem cells. These uncertainties could be overcome if each transgenic factor were replaced with a small molecule that either directly activated its expression from the somatic genome or in some way compensated for its activity. To this end, we have used high-content chemical screening to identify small molecules that can replace Sox2 in reprogramming. We show that one of these molecules functions in reprogramming by inhibiting Tgf-beta signaling in a stable and trapped intermediate cell type that forms during the process. We find that this inhibition promotes the completion of reprogramming through induction of the transcription factor Nanog."

We have previously identified thrombospondin as an astrocyte-secreted protein that promotes central nervous system (CNS) synaptogenesis. Here, we identify the neuronal thrombospondin receptor involved in CNS synapse formation as α2δ-1, the receptor for the anti-epileptic and analgesic drug gabapentin. We show that the VWF-A domain of α2δ-1 interacts with the epidermal growth factor-like repeats common to all thrombospondins. α2δ-1 overexpression increases synaptogenesis in vitro and in vivo and is required postsynaptically for thrombospondin- and astrocyte-induced synapse formation in vitro. Gabapentin antagonizes thrombospondin binding to α2δ-1 and powerfully inhibits excitatory synapse formation in vitro and in vivo. These findings identify α2δ-1 as a receptor involved in excitatory synapse formation and suggest that gabapentin may function therapeutically by blocking new synapse formation.

These findings identify α2δ-1 as a receptor involved in excitatory synapse formation and suggest that gabapentin may function therapeutically by blocking new synapse formation. Central nervous system (CNS) synapses are complex cell-cell adhesions between neurons. Their establishment requires an interaction between axons and dendrites, accompanied by the appositional organization of pre- and postsynaptic specializations. Several neuronal cell surface molecules and secreted signals have been shown to be involved in processes that lead to synaptic organization and maturation (Fox and Umemori, 2006Fox M.A. Umemori H. Seeking long-term relationship: axon and target communicate to organize synaptic differentiation.J. Neurochem. 2006; 97: 1215-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), but molecules that regulate the formation of initial synaptic adhesions remain poorly understood. Accumulating evidence from our lab and others has shown that astrocytes play active roles in the formation of synapses (Eroglu et al., 2008Eroglu C. Barres B.A. Stevens B. Glia as active paricipants in the development and function of synapses.in: Hell J. Ehlers M. Structural and Functional Organization of the Synapse. Springer, New York2008: 683-714Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We have previously identified thrombospondins (TSP) as a necessary and sufficient synaptogenic signal secreted by astrocytes that increases synapse number (Christopherson et al., 2005Christopherson K.S. Ullian E.M. Stokes C.C. Mullowney C.E. Hell J.W. Agah A. Lawler J. Mosher D.F. Bornstein P. Barres B.A. Thrombospondins are astrocyte-secreted proteins that promote CNS synaptogenesis.Cell. 2005; 120: 421-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). TSP is present in astrocyte-conditioned media (ACM) and is responsible for the ability of astrocytes to increase synapse number in vitro (Christopherson et al., 2005Christopherson K.S. Ullian E.M. Stokes C.C. Mullowney C.E. Hell J.W. Agah A. Lawler J. Mosher D.F. Bornstein P. Barres B.A. Thrombospondins are astrocyte-secreted proteins that promote CNS synaptogenesis.Cell. 2005; 120: 421-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). TSPs are also important for synapse formation in vivo. TSP1/2-deficient mice have a significant decrease in the number of excitatory synapses. TSP1 and 2 are expressed during early postnatal ages, when the majority of synapses are forming, and these proteins are absent from the adult brain when the amount of excitatory synaptogenesis is significantly reduced (Christopherson et al., 2005Christopherson K.S. Ullian E.M. Stokes C.C. Mullowney C.E. Hell J.W. Agah A. Lawler J. Mosher D.F. Bornstein P. Barres B.A. Thrombospondins are astrocyte-secreted proteins that promote CNS synaptogenesis.Cell. 2005; 120: 421-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). Upon injury to the CNS, TSP1/2 levels are upregulated, and lack of TSP1/2 impairs synaptic and functional recovery from stroke (Liauw et al., 2008Liauw J. Hoang S. Choi M. Eroglu C. Choi M. Sun G.H. Percy M. Wildman-Tobriner B. Bliss T. Guzman R.G. et al.Thrombospondins 1 and 2 are necessary for synaptic plasticity and functional recovery after stroke.J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2008; 28: 1722-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). TSP is able to promote synaptic adhesion and initiate the events that lead to the establishment of pre- and postsynaptic specializations. Interestingly, these TSP-induced synapses are ultrastructurally identical to fully developed synapses and are presynaptically active but postsynaptically silent because of the lack of surface AMPA receptors. Astrocytes secrete a second unrelated signal that is able to convert these silent synapses into fully active ones (Christopherson et al., 2005Christopherson K.S. Ullian E.M. Stokes C.C. Mullowney C.E. Hell J.W. Agah A. Lawler J. Mosher D.F. Bornstein P. Barres B.A. Thrombospondins are astrocyte-secreted proteins that promote CNS synaptogenesis.Cell. 2005; 120: 421-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar) (N.J.A. and B.A.B. unpublished data). TSPs are large oligomeric, multidomain, extracellular matrix proteins that have been previously shown to play important roles in cell attachment, cell migration, cytoskeletal dynamics, and angiogenesis (Bornstein et al., 2004Bornstein P. Agah A. Kyriakides T.R. The role of thrombospondins 1 and 2 in the regulation of cell-matrix interactions, collagen fibril formation, and the response to injury.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1115-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). TSP mediates these functions via its interaction with various cell surface receptors through specific domains (Adams and Lawler, 2004Adams J.C. Lawler J. The thrombospondins.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 961-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that TSPs induce synapse formation by interacting with a neuronal cell-surface receptor. Here, we show that TSPs mediate synaptogenesis through their epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains, common to all TSP isoforms. Using this domain information, we identified the gabapentin receptor α2δ-1 as the TSP receptor involved in synapse formation. α2δ-1 (Cacna2d1) was originally isolated as a nonessential subunit of the L-type calcium channel complex from skeletal muscle (Arikkath and Campbell, 2003Arikkath J. Campbell K.P. Auxiliary subunits: essential components of the voltage-gated calcium channel complex.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 298-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), and it also binds to other proteins (Kaltenbach et al., 2007Kaltenbach L.S. Romero E. Becklin R.R. Chettier R. Bell R. Phansalkar A. Strand A. Torcassi C. Savage J. Hurlburt A. et al.Huntingtin interacting proteins are genetic modifiers of neurodegeneration.PLoS Genet. 2007; 3: e82Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). α2δ-1 is ubiquitously expressed in many tissues and is highly expressed by many CNS neurons (Cole et al., 2005Cole R.L. Lechner S.M. Williams M.E. Prodanovich P. Bleicher L. Varney M.A. Gu G. Differential distribution of voltage-gated calcium channel alpha-2 delta (alpha2delta) subunit mRNA-containing cells in the rat central nervous system and the dorsal root ganglia.J. Comp. Neurol. 2005; 491: 246-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), including retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). α2δ-1 is translated from a single gene product, which gets posttranslationally cleaved into α2 and δ parts that remain associated via disulfide bridges. The α2 part of the protein (∼950 amino acids) is entirely extracellular, while the δ part has a small extracellular part that is attached to α2 and a transmembrane domain with a very short cytoplasmic tail that tethers the protein to the membrane (Davies et al., 2007Davies A. Hendrich J. Van Minh A.T. Wratten J. Douglas L. Dolphin A.C. Functional biology of the alpha(2)delta subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2007; 28: 220-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Much research on α2δ-1 has focused on its role in the regulation of calcium channel function and trafficking. However, the presence of a large extracellular region containing a well-known protein-protein interaction fold, the Von Willebrand Factor A (VWF-A) domain, suggests that this protein could serve as a receptor for extracellular ligands. A recent study on skeletal muscle cells, which express high levels of α2δ-1, described such a role for α2δ-1 in myoblast attachment and extracellular signaling that is independent of calcium channel function (Garcia et al., 2007Garcia K. Nabhani T. Garcia J. The calcium channel alpha2/delta1 subunit is involved in extracellular signaling.J. Physiol. 2007; 586: 727-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). α2δ-1 is the high-affinity receptor for two commonly prescribed antiepileptic, antineuropathic pain medications, gabapentin (GBP, Neurontin) and pregabalin (Lyrica) (Gee et al., 1996Gee N.S. Brown J.P. Dissanayake V.U. Offord J. Thurlow R. Woodruff G.N. The novel anticonvulsant drug, gabapentin (Neurontin), binds to the alpha2delta subunit of a calcium channel.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5768-5776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). GBP and pregabalin were initially designed as hydrophobic gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) analogs that could cross the blood-brain barrier. Further studies have shown that even though they posses anticonvulsant properties, they do not bind to GABA receptors or transporters. A recent study using a knockin mouse that expresses a mutant α2δ-1 that cannot bind GBP or pregabalin has shown that α2δ-1 is the in vivo target for these drugs and that these drugs mediate their therapeutic action through binding to α2δ-1 (Field et al., 2006Field M.J. Cox P.J. Stott E. Melrose H. Offord J. Su T.Z. Bramwell S. Corradini L. England S. Winks J. et al.Identification of the alpha2-delta-1 subunit of voltage-dependent calcium channels as a molecular target for pain mediating the analgesic actions of pregabalin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 17537-17542Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). GBP and pregabalin do not affect the single-channel kinetics of calcium channels and have only modest effects on neurotransmission (Dooley et al., 2007Dooley D.J. Taylor C.P. Donevan S. Feltner D. Ca2+ channel alpha2delta ligands: novel modulators of neurotransmission.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2007; 28: 75-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Thus, the cellular mechanisms underlying the mode of action of these drugs are unclear. In this study, we show that EGF-like domains of TSP directly bind to α2δ-1 and mediate its synapse-inducing activity via this receptor. These findings identify α2δ-1 as a neuronal TSP receptor that is required for CNS synapse formation. This function of α2δ-1 is likely to be independent of calcium channel function. We also show that GBP is a potent inhibitor of TSP/astrocyte-induced excitatory synapse formation in vitro and in vivo. This function of GBP may be a central part of its mechanism of action. There are five TSP isoforms in mammals, which fall into two groups according to their domain structure and oligomerization states (Figure 1A). Trimeric subgroup A TSPs, TSP1 and 2, are synaptogenic (Christopherson et al., 2005Christopherson K.S. Ullian E.M. Stokes C.C. Mullowney C.E. Hell J.W. Agah A. Lawler J. Mosher D.F. Bornstein P. Barres B.A. Thrombospondins are astrocyte-secreted proteins that promote CNS synaptogenesis.Cell. 2005; 120: 421-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). To determine whether pentameric subgroup B TSPs are also synaptogenic, we cultured RGCs in the presence of astrocytes or with TSP 1, 3, 4, or 5. All subgroup B TSPs increased synapse number significantly to similar levels as TSP1 or astrocytes (Figures 1B–1D). These results suggest that the synaptogenic domain of TSP is located in the conserved C-terminal portion of TSP, which is common to all isoforms spanning the EGF-like repeats, the calcium-binding repeats, and C-terminal L-type lectin-like globular domain. TSPs interact with a number of known cell-surface receptors through specific domains (Adams and Lawler, 2004Adams J.C. Lawler J. The thrombospondins.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 961-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). To identify the synaptogenic domain of TSP, we treated RGCs with a panel of recombinant truncation constructs of TSP1 and 2. The TSP fragments that contained the EGF-like repeats mimicked the ability of full-length TSP to induce synapses (Figures 2B and 2C). A fragment containing the third EGF-like repeat together with the C-terminal region of TSP2 also significantly increased synapse number; however, the third EGF like domain alone did not induce a significant increase in synapse number (Figure 2C). We confirmed the importance of the EGF-like repeats in synapse formation by functionally blocking synaptogenic effect of TSP on cultured RGCs, using monoclonal antibodies directed against different epitopes of TSP (Figure 2D). Monoclonal antibodies against the second (HB8432 and C6.7) (Annis et al., 2007Annis D.S. Gunderson K.A. Mosher D.F. Immunochemical analysis of the structure of the signature domains of thrombospondin-1 and thrombospondin-2 in low calcium concentrations.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27067-27075Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) or third EGF-like repeats (A4.1) (Annis et al., 2006Annis D.S. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Mosher D.F. Function-blocking antithrombospondin-1 monoclonal antibodies.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2006; 4: 459-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) blocked the synaptogenic effect of TSP, whereas an antibody against the N-terminal domain (mAb200-1) did not (Figure 2E). To aid us in our efforts to identify the neuronal TSP receptor involved in synapse formation, we expressed and purified a myc and 6-Histidine tagged TSP2 fragment containing all three EGF-like repeats (Figures S1A and S1B available online). This TSP2 fragment (designated SD2 for synaptogenic domain 2) was strongly synaptogenic (Figures S1C and S1D). Collectively, these data suggest that TSP-induced synapse formation is mediated by an interaction involving EGF-like repeats of TSP. The EGF-like domains of TSP4 have been shown to bind to the VWF-A domain of integrin αM (Pluskota et al., 2005Pluskota E. Stenina O.I. Krukovets I. Szpak D. Topol E.J. Plow E.F. Mechanism and effect of thrombospondin-4 polymorphisms on neutrophil function.Blood. 2005; 106: 3970-3978Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus, we investigated whether integrin αM or other VWF-A domain containing integrins in RGCs were involved in TSP-induced synapse formation. None of the integrins that contained the VWF-A domain and were expressed by RGCs were crucial for the synaptogenic activity of TSP (data not shown). Another class of cell-surface proteins that contains VWF-A domains is the alpha2 delta (α2δ) family. Among the α2δ proteins cloned to date (Klugbauer et al., 2003Klugbauer N. Marais E. Hofmann F. Calcium channel alpha2delta subunits: differential expression, function, and drug binding.J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2003; 35: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), RGCs express high levels of α2δ-1 (Figure S2A). We investigated whether α2δ-1 is localized to synapses using array tomography (Micheva and Smith, 2007Micheva K.D. Smith S.J. Array tomography: a new tool for imaging the molecular architecture and ultrastructure of neural circuits.Neuron. 2007; 55: 25-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Ultra-thin sections from rat cortex or mouse LGN were immunolabeled with antibodies against α2δ-1 and the pre- and postsynaptic markers synapsin and MAGUK. α2δ-1 gave a punctate staining pattern. Some α2δ-1 puncta localized to synapses identified as juxtapositioned pre- and postsynaptic puncta, while some colocalized exclusively with pre- or postsynaptic puncta (Figures 3A and S2B). To determine whether α2δ-1 interacts with TSPs, we immunoprecipitated TSP1, 2, and 4 from P5 rat cerebral cortex lysate. α2δ-1 was detected in immunoprecipitation fractions performed with each of the three TSP antibodies (Figure 3B), suggesting that α2δ-1 and TSPs interact in vivo. To test whether there is a direct and specific binding interaction between the synaptogenic domain of TSP and α2δ-1, we coexpressed a FLAG-tagged α2δ-1 alone (Figure 3C, lane 2), with SD2 (lane 4), or with an unrelated secreted control protein that contained an EGF-like repeat (Control-myc-his, lane 5). Beads conjugated to an anti FLAG-tag antibody were used to immunoprecipitate α2δ-1-FLAG. SD2 coimmunoprecipitated with α2δ-1-FLAG, but the Control-myc-his protein did not (Figure 3C, lanes 8 and 9, respectively), suggesting that α2δ-1 specifically interacts with the synaptogenic EGF-like domains of TSP. We hypothesized that the EGF-like domains of TSP interact with the VWF-A domain of α2δ-1, which resides in the α2 region of the protein. So that this could be tested, three α2δ-1 constructs, the full-length α2δ-1, α2, or VWF-A domain, each with a C-terminal Protein C (PC) tag for purification (Figure 3D), were coexpressed with SD2. When we performed PC tag affinity purifications, we could detect SD2 in all three purified fractions (Figure 3E, lanes 7, 8, and 9). SD2 did not copurify with an unrelated membrane protein that also contained the same PC tag (Figure 3E, lane 6). These data show that TSP and α2δ-1 interact through the synaptogenic EGF-like domains of TSP and the VWF-A domain of α2δ-1. To determine whether α2δ-1 plays a role in TSP-induced synapse formation in vitro, we overexpressed α2δ-1 in RGCs and tested whether SD2-induced synapse formation was affected. RGCs that overexpressed α2δ-1 (identified with GFP coexpression) received twice as many synapses in response to SD2 as did RGCs transfected with empty vector (Figure 4A), indicating that α2δ-1 overexpression enhances TSP-induced synapse formation. α2δ-1 overexpression was not sufficient to induce synapse formation in the absence of SD2, suggesting that SD2 is required for the enhancement of synapse formation by α2δ-1. To determine which region of the α2δ-1 protein was responsible for its enhancement of SD2-induced synapse formation, we utilized two α2δ-1 constructs (schemed in Figure 4A). Overexpression of a “α2δ-1Adh” construct that contains the entire extracellular region of α2δ-1 followed by the transmembrane domain from an unrelated type 1 membrane protein adhalin (Gurnett et al., 1996Gurnett C.A. De Waard M. Campbell K.P. Dual function of the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel alpha 2 delta subunit in current stimulation and subunit interaction.Neuron. 1996; 16: 431-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) mimicked the effect of full-length α2δ-1 in enhancing SD2-induced synapse formation (Figure 4A), suggesting that the critical region of α2δ-1 maps to the extracellular part of the protein. We next overexpressed a “δ-1 only” construct (lacking the α2 region), which inhibited SD2-induced synapse formation (Figure 4A), indicating that the VWF-A-containing α2 region is necessary for enhancing synaptogenesis and that regions within δ-1 may be involved in regulating downstream interactions that are critical for TSP-induced synapse formation. Since the VWF-A domain of α2δ-1 binds TSP, we investigated whether antibodies against the VWF-A domain of α2δ-1 would interfere with TSP-induced synapse formation. Two monoclonal antibodies directed against the VWF-A domain of α2δ-1, 5A5 and 3B4, recognized α2δ-1 in western blots and stained the surface of HEK293 cells overexpressing α2δ-1 (Figures S3A and S3B). When RGCs were cultured with these antibodies in the presence or absence of TSP and synapse number analyzed, both 5A5 and 3B4 induced synapse formation similar to TSP. A control antibody (OX7) against another RGC surface receptor (Thy1) did not affect synapse formation. The synaptogenic effect of 5A5 or 3B4 was not additive with that of TSP (Figure 4B). These data show that antibody binding to the VWF-A domain can mimic TSPs synaptogenic function and suggest that the interaction of TSP with the VWF-A domain of α2δ-1 is important for the initiation of synapse formation. Such ligand-mimicking antibodies were also described for VWF-A domain-containing integrins (Wilkins et al., 1996Wilkins J.A. Li A. Ni H. Stupack D.G. Shen C. Control of beta1 integrin function. Localization of stimulatory epitopes.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3046-3051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To determine whether α2δ-1 is required for TSP-induced synapse formation, we used a small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown approach. An siRNA pool specific for rat α2δ-1 significantly reduced the expression of rat α2δ-1 in transfected HEK293 cells (Figure 4C). Knockdown of α2δ-1 in RGCs with this siRNA pool inhibited astrocyte or TSP-induced synapse formation in vitro (Figures 4D and 4E), whereas the nontargeting control siRNA pool (siControl) did not affect synapse formation (Figures 4C and 4D). To show that the reduction in synapse formation by the α2δ-1 siRNAs was due to the specific knockdown of α2δ-1, we tested whether the siRNA inhibition could be rescued by coexpressing an siRNA resistant α2δ-1 construct. One of the siRNAs against rat α2δ-1, siα2δ-1 Duplex 9, blocked overexpression of rat α2δ-1 but not human α2δ-1 in HEK293 cells (Figure S4). When we cotransfected RGCs with siα2δ-1(9) and the human α2δ-1 construct, we rescued SD2 or astrocyte-induced synapse formation (Figure 4F), showing that siRNA knockdown of α2δ-1 blocks synaptogenesis via specific inhibition of rat α2δ-1 messenger RNA (mRNA). Taken together, these results demonstrate that α2δ-1 is necessary for TSP and astrocyte-induced synapse formation in vitro. Since we analyze the effect of α2δ-1 overexpression and knockdown in the postsynaptic cells receiving synapses, these data show a postsynaptic sufficiency and necessity for α2δ-1 in astrocyte/TSP-induced synapse formation. α2δ-1 is known to enhance calcium channel function and trafficking (Arikkath and Campbell, 2003Arikkath J. Campbell K.P. Auxiliary subunits: essential components of the voltage-gated calcium channel complex.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 298-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether the activity of α2δ-1 in synapse formation is linked to its role in increasing calcium currents or calcium channel levels. Gene expression analysis of RGCs show that these cells express predominantly postsynaptic L-type and presynaptic N- and P/Q-type voltage gated calcium channels (VGCCs). To directly test whether VGCC function was required for astrocyte-induced synapse formation, we added L-type calcium channel blockers to RGCs to block L-type channel function. These drugs had no effect on SD2-induced synapse formation (Figure S5A). Similarly presynaptic N- and P/Q-type channel blockers did not block TSP-induced synapse formation (data not shown). We next investigated whether increase of postsynaptic L-type calcium channel expression in RGCs would enhance synapse formation. Overexpression of L-type α1C and β subunits in RGCs had no effect on astrocyte-induced synapse formation (Figure S5B). Finally, we tested whether TSP treatment would lead to an increase in cytoplasmic calcium levels in RGCs. Neither acute nor long-term TSP treatment led to a noticeable rise in spontaneous calcium oscillations in RGCs (Figure S6). Taken together, these results show that the role of α2δ-1 in synapse formation cannot be directly linked to calcium channel expression levels or function. To determine whether α2δ-1 plays a role in synapse formation in vivo, we examined synapse number and synaptic activity in transgenic mice that selectively overexpress α2δ-1 in CNS neurons, under the control of the Thy1 promoter (Li et al., 2006Li C.Y. Zhang X.L. Matthews E.A. Li K.W. Kurwa A. Boroujerdi A. Gross J. Gold M.S. Dickenson A.H. Feng G. et al.Calcium channel alpha2delta1 subunit mediates spinal hyperexcitability in pain modulation.Pain. 2006; 125: 20-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Sagittal brain sections from 21-day-old (P21) transgenic (TG) and wild-type (WT) littermate mice were coimmunostained for PSD95 and either the presynaptic vesicular glutamate transporter 1 or 2 (VGlut1 and VGlut2). We quantified the number of colocalized pre- and postsynaptic puncta to determine the synaptic density in the cortices of these mice. The TG mice had significantly higher numbers of VGlut2-positive excitatory synapses in the cortex than did the littermate WT controls (1.8-fold, Figures 5A and 5B); however, there was no difference in the number of VGlut1-positive synapses between WT and TG mice (Figures S7A and S7B). The observation that α2δ-1 overexpression increases VGlut2-positive synapses provides evidence that excitatory synapse formation is enhanced in the TGs. In the adult cortex thalamic neurons projecting onto layer IV neurons form VGlut2-positive synapses, while synapses made between cortical neurons contain VGlut1 (Fremeau et al., 2004Fremeau Jr., R.T.

VGLUTs define subsets of excitatory neurons and suggest novel roles for glutamate.Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 98-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). We confirmed that the increase in VGlut2-positive synapse number was not due to an increase in the number of neurons in the cortex or thalamus, as the number of cells and neurons in WT and TG brains were identical in these brain regions (Figures S8A and S8B). Excitatory synapses in the cortex are initially formed as VGlut2 positive, and there is an isoform switch to VGlut1 that happens around the second week of postnatal development (Miyazaki et al., 2003Miyazaki T. Fukaya M. Shimizu H. Watanabe M. Subtype switching of vesicular glutamate transporters at parallel fibre-Purkinje cell synapses in developing mouse cerebellum.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 17: 2563-2572Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). During this period, some synapses can transiently be both VGlut1 and 2 positive (Nakamura et al., 2005Nakamura K. Hioki H. Fujiyama F. Kaneko T. Postnatal changes of vesicular glutamate transporter (VGluT)1 and VGluT2 immunoreactivities and their colocalization in the mouse forebrain.J. Comp. Neurol. 2005; 492: 263-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). We determined that the increase in VGlut2-positive synapses was not due to a prolonged colocalization of VGlut1 and 2 at the same synapse, since these proteins seldom colocalized at P21, and there were no differences in the frequency of colocalization of these proteins between genotypes (Figures S9A and S9B). Taken together, these results show that the increase in VGlut2-positive synapses associated with α2δ-1 overexpression is due to neither an increase in the number of cortical or thalamic neurons nor a delay in the isoform switch from VGlut2 to 1 in the cortex. In addition to analyzing synapse number by immunohistochemistry, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in layer IV cortical pyramidal neurons and assayed the number of active synapses by analyzing the frequency and amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs). Recorded cells were dye filled, and their identity was verified (Figures S10A and S10B). We targeted layer IV pyramidal neurons both because these cells receive VGlut2-positive synapses and because array tomography revealed an increase in α2δ-1 immunostaining in TG animals in this layer (Figure S10C). There was a highly significant increase in the frequency of mEPSCs in α2δ-1 TG mice compared with WT mice (1.63-fold), with no effect on the amplitude of mEPSCs (Figures 5C–5E). The increase in the frequency of mEPSCs in TG mice is very consistent with the increased excitatory synapse number found by the immunohistochemical analysis described above. Taken together, these data show that α2δ-1 plays a role in promoting excitatory synapse formation in the brain. In order to determine whether GBP, the high-affinity ligand for α2δ-1 affects TSP or astrocyte-induced synapse formation, we cultured RGCs with TSP, SD2, or ACM in the presence or absence of GBP (32 μM). GBP strongly inhibited TSP, SD2, or astrocyte-induced synapse formation (Figures 6A–6C and S1C). To determine whether GBP could dissolve already established synapses, we cultured RGCs with SD2 for 5 days to allow synapses to form and then added GBP for an additional day. GBP had no effect on synapse number when added after the synapses were formed (Figure 6C). Thus, GBP blocks new synapse formatio"

By screening genes developmentally regulated in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), we identified Krüppel-like factor-4 (KLF4) as a transcriptional repressor of axon growth in RGCs and other CNS neurons. RGCs lacking KLF4 showed increased axon growth both in vitro and after optic nerve injury in vivo. Related KLF family members suppressed or enhanced axon growth to differing extents, and several growth-suppressive KLFs were up-regulated postnatally, whereas growth-enhancing KLFs were down-regulated. Thus, coordinated activities of different KLFs regulate the regenerative capacity of CNS neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2059528261,"The pluripotent state, first established in the primitive ectoderm cells of the blastocyst-stage embryo, is lost during subsequent development. Bao et al. now show that advanced post-implantation epiblast cells from mouse embryos aged up to 7.5 days can be reprogrammed back to pluripotency by exposure to LIF/STAT3 signalling. They show accompanying changes in the transcriptome (the total mRNA in the cell) results in a loss of the phenotypic and epigenetic memory found in epiblast cells. Cells reprogrammed in this way can contribute to somatic tissues and germ cells in chimaeras, unlike self-renewing epiblast stem cells. This work provides a model for studying how signalling and epigenetic reprogramming may promote reacquisition of pluripotency. The pluripotent state is first established in the primitive ectoderm cells of blastocysts but is progressively and irreversibly lost during development. For example, the transition from primitive ectoderm cell to epiblast cell, post implantation, involves significant transcriptional and epigenetic changes. A technique for reprogramming advanced epiblast cells from embryonic day 5.5–7.5 mouse embryos to embryonic-stem-cell-like cells — representing a return to pluripotency — is now demonstrated. The pluripotent state, which is first established in the primitive ectoderm cells of blastocysts, is lost progressively and irreversibly during subsequent development1. For example, development of post-implantation epiblast cells from primitive ectoderm involves significant transcriptional and epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation and X chromosome inactivation2, which create a robust epigenetic barrier and prevent their reversion to a primitive-ectoderm-like state. Epiblast cells are refractory to leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF)–STAT3 signalling, but they respond to activin/basic fibroblast growth factor to form self-renewing epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs), which exhibit essential properties of epiblast cells3,4 and that differ from embryonic stem (ES) cells derived from primitive ectoderm5. Here we show reprogramming of advanced epiblast cells from embryonic day 5.5–7.5 mouse embryos with uniform expression of N-cadherin and inactive X chromosome to ES-cell-like cells (rESCs) in response to LIF–STAT3 signalling. Cultured epiblast cells overcome the epigenetic barrier progressively as they proceed with the erasure of key properties of epiblast cells, resulting in DNA demethylation, X reactivation and expression of E-cadherin. The accompanying changes in the transcriptome result in a loss of phenotypic and epigenetic memory of epiblast cells. Using this approach, we report reversion of established EpiSCs to rESCs. Moreover, unlike epiblast and EpiSCs, rESCs contribute to somatic tissues and germ cells in chimaeras. Further studies may reveal how signalling-induced epigenetic reprogramming may promote reacquisition of pluripotency."
https://openalex.org/W2105123440,"Despite progress in the biosensor field, a platform that allows the sensitive detection of disease-specific proteins in a diverse range of clinical samples such as saliva, serum and urine has proved elusive. Here, Richard Gaster and his colleagues introduce a magnetic nanosensing protein detection platform that offers quantitative multiplex protein detection at attomolar concentrations over a large linear dynamic range and in a range of biological fluids. Advances in biosensor technologies for in vitro diagnostics have the potential to transform the practice of medicine. Despite considerable work in the biosensor field, there is still no general sensing platform that can be ubiquitously applied to detect the constellation of biomolecules in diverse clinical samples (for example, serum, urine, cell lysates or saliva) with high sensitivity and large linear dynamic range. A major limitation confounding other technologies is signal distortion that occurs in various matrices due to heterogeneity in ionic strength, pH, temperature and autofluorescence. Here we present a magnetic nanosensor technology that is matrix insensitive yet still capable of rapid, multiplex protein detection with resolution down to attomolar concentrations and extensive linear dynamic range. The matrix insensitivity of our platform to various media demonstrates that our magnetic nanosensor technology can be directly applied to a variety of settings such as molecular biology, clinical diagnostics and biodefense."
https://openalex.org/W2146918217,"The human respiratory tract is constantly exposed to a wide variety of viruses, microbes and inorganic particulates from environmental air, water and food. Physical characteristics of inhaled particles and airway mucosal immunity determine which viruses and microbes will persist in the airways. Here we present the first metagenomic study of DNA viral communities in the airways of diseased and non-diseased individuals. We obtained sequences from sputum DNA viral communities in 5 individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) and 5 individuals without the disease. Overall, diversity of viruses in the airways was low, with an average richness of 175 distinct viral genotypes. The majority of viral diversity was uncharacterized. CF phage communities were highly similar to each other, whereas Non-CF individuals had more distinct phage communities, which may reflect organisms in inhaled air. CF eukaryotic viral communities were dominated by a few viruses, including human herpesviruses and retroviruses. Functional metagenomics showed that all Non-CF viromes were similar, and that CF viromes were enriched in aromatic amino acid metabolism. The CF metagenomes occupied two different metabolic states, probably reflecting different disease states. There was one outlying CF virome which was characterized by an over-representation of Guanosine-5′-triphosphate,3′-diphosphate pyrophosphatase, an enzyme involved in the bacterial stringent response. Unique environments like the CF airway can drive functional adaptations, leading to shifts in metabolic profiles. These results have important clinical implications for CF, indicating that therapeutic measures may be more effective if used to change the respiratory environment, as opposed to shifting the taxonomic composition of resident microbiota."

(p. 294 ; see the Perspective by Benedito and Adams ) identified a third mechanism in zebrafish in which two distinct, unconnected vessels can be derived from a single precursor vessel. Several vascular endothelial growth factors and signaling pathways, including ephrin and notch signaling, coordinated the sorting and segregation of a mixture of arterial and venous-fated precursor cells into distinct arterial and venous vessels. These findings provide a mechanistic framework for how mixed populations of cells can coordinate their behavior to segregate and form distinct blood vessels."

https://openalex.org/W2116711646,"Single-stranded DNA generated in the cell during DNA metabolism is stabilized and protected by binding of ssDNA-binding (SSB) proteins. Escherichia coli SSB, a representative homotetrameric SSB, binds to ssDNA by wrapping the DNA using its four subunits. However, such a tightly wrapped, high-affinity protein-DNA complex still needs to be removed or repositioned quickly for unhindered action of other proteins. Here we show, using single-molecule two- and three-colour fluorescence resonance energy transfer, that tetrameric SSB can spontaneously migrate along ssDNA. Diffusional migration of SSB helps in the local displacement of SSB by an elongating RecA filament. SSB diffusion also melts short DNA hairpins transiently and stimulates RecA filament elongation on DNA with secondary structure. This observation of diffusional movement of a protein on ssDNA introduces a new model for how an SSB protein can be redistributed, while remaining tightly bound to ssDNA during recombination and repair processes."

https://openalex.org/W2013098933,"The anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C), a ubiquitin ligase, is the target of the spindle-assembly checkpoint (SAC), and it ubiquitylates protein substrates whose degradation regulates progress through mitosis. The identity of the ubiquitin-conjugating (E2) enzymes that work with the APC/C is unclear. In an RNA interference (RNAi) screen for factors that modify release from drug-induced SAC activation, we identified the E2 enzyme UBE2S as an APC/C auxiliary factor that promotes mitotic exit. UBE2S is dispensable in a normal mitosis, but its depletion prolongs drug-induced mitotic arrest and suppresses mitotic slippage. In vitro, UBE2S elongates ubiquitin chains initiated by the E2 enzymes UBCH10 and UBCH5, enhancing the degradation of APC/C substrates by the proteasome. Indeed, following release from SAC-induced mitotic arrest, UBE2S-depleted cells neither degrade crucial APC/C substrates, nor silence this checkpoint, whereas bypassing the SAC through BUBR1 depletion or Aurora-B inhibition negates the requirement for UBE2S. Thus, UBE2S functions with the APC/C in a two-step mechanism to control substrate ubiquitylation that is essential for mitotic exit after prolonged SAC activation, providing a new model for APC/C function in human cells."
https://openalex.org/W2026638594,"Background Non-pulsatile tinnitus is considered a subjective auditory phantom phenomenon present in 10 to 15% of the population. Tinnitus as a phantom phenomenon is related to hyperactivity and reorganization of the auditory cortex. Magnetoencephalography studies demonstrate a correlation between gamma band activity in the contralateral auditory cortex and the presence of tinnitus. The present study aims to investigate the relation between objective gamma-band activity in the contralateral auditory cortex and subjective tinnitus loudness scores. Methods and Findings In unilateral tinnitus patients (N = 15; 10 right, 5 left) source analysis of resting state electroencephalographic gamma band oscillations shows a strong positive correlation with Visual Analogue Scale loudness scores in the contralateral auditory cortex (max r = 0.73, p<0.05). Conclusion Auditory phantom percepts thus show similar sound level dependent activation of the contralateral auditory cortex as observed in normal audition. In view of recent consciousness models and tinnitus network models these results suggest tinnitus loudness is coded by gamma band activity in the contralateral auditory cortex but might not, by itself, be responsible for tinnitus perception."

We found three alternative exons, 6b, 13, and 15, coding for segments of 22, 4, and 26 amino acids, respectively, which are differently spliced in human organs. By patch clamp experiments on transfected cells, we found that skipping of exon 6b changes the Ca2+ sensitivity by nearly 4-fold, resulting in Cl− currents requiring lower Ca2+ concentrations to be activated. At the membrane potential of 80 mV, the apparent half-effective concentration decreases from 350 to 90 nm when the segment corresponding to exon 6b is excluded. Skipping of exon 13 instead strongly reduces the characteristic time-dependent activation observed for Ca2+-activated Cl− channels at positive membrane potentials.

It is believed that the growth and energetic physiology of basalmost birds such as Archaeopteryx were inherited in their entirety from non-avialan dinosaurs. This hypothesis predicts that the long bones in these birds formed using rapidly growing, well-vascularized woven tissue typical of non-avialan dinosaurs.We report that Archaeopteryx long bones are composed of nearly avascular parallel-fibered bone. This is among the slowest growing osseous tissues and is common in ectothermic reptiles. These findings dispute the hypothesis that non-avialan dinosaur growth and physiology were inherited in totality by the first birds. Examining these findings in a phylogenetic context required intensive sampling of outgroup dinosaurs and basalmost birds. Our results demonstrate the presence of a scale-dependent maniraptoran histological continuum that Archaeopteryx and other basalmost birds follow. Growth analysis for Archaeopteryx suggests that these animals showed exponential growth rates like non-avialan dinosaurs, three times slower than living precocial birds, but still within the lowermost range for all endothermic vertebrates.The unexpected histology of Archaeopteryx and other basalmost birds is actually consistent with retention of the phylogenetically earlier paravian dinosaur condition when size is considered. The first birds were simply feathered dinosaurs with respect to growth and energetic physiology. The evolution of the novel pattern in modern forms occurred later in the group's history."

Here we show that nucleotides released to the extracellular medium by electrical stimulation are partly involved in the fast component and are largely responsible for the slow signals. In rat skeletal myotubes, a tetanic stimulus (45 Hz, 400 1-ms pulses) rapidly increased extracellular levels of ATP, ADP, and AMP after 15 s to 3 min. Exogenous ATP induced an increase in intracellular free Ca2+ concentration, with an EC50 value of 7.8 ± 3.1 μm. Exogenous ADP, UTP, and UDP also promoted calcium transients. Both fast and slow calcium signals evoked by tetanic stimulation were inhibited by either 100 μm suramin or 2 units/ml apyrase. Apyrase also reduced fast and slow calcium signals evoked by tetanus (45 Hz, 400 0.3-ms pulses) in isolated mouse adult skeletal fibers.

Wiseman and his colleagues provide a cost-effective solution to this problem using a next-generation pyrosequencing approach to high-resolution MHC genotyping in various nonhuman primates, identifying both known and new MHC class I alleles. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genetics dictate adaptive cellular immune responses, making robust MHC genotyping methods essential for studies of infectious disease, vaccine development and transplantation. Nonhuman primates provide essential preclinical models for these areas of biomedical research. Unfortunately, given the unparalleled complexity of macaque MHCs, existing methodologies are inadequate for MHC typing of these key model animals. Here we use pyrosequencing of complementary DNA–PCR amplicons as a general approach to determine comprehensive MHC class I genotypes in nonhuman primates. More than 500 unique MHC class I sequences were resolved by sequence-based typing of rhesus, cynomolgus and pig-tailed macaques, nearly half of which have not been reported previously.

Kurshan et al. now show that this subunit has other, independent synaptogenic functions and that it is important for shaping the architecture of the synapse. Synaptogenesis involves the transformation of a growth cone into synaptic boutons specialized for transmitter release. In Drosophila embryos lacking the α2δ-3 subunit of presynaptic, voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, we found that motor neuron terminals failed to develop synaptic boutons and cytoskeletal abnormalities arose, including the loss of ankyrin2. Nevertheless, functional presynaptic specializations were present and apposed to clusters of postsynaptic glutamate receptors. The α2δ-3 protein has been thought to function strictly as an auxiliary subunit of the Ca2+ channel, but the phenotype of α2δ-3 (also known as stj) mutations cannot be explained by a channel defect; embryos lacking the pore-forming α1 subunit cacophony formed boutons. The synaptogenic function of α2δ-3 required only the α2 peptide, whose expression sufficed to rescue bouton formation. Our results indicate that α2δ proteins have functions that are independent of their roles in the biophysics and localization of Ca2+ channels and that synaptic architecture depends on these functions."

The replication checkpoint signal transduction cascade is thought to consist of four basic steps. First, replication forks arrest in response to replicative stresses via the activity of checkpoint-mediator proteins, which are components of the replication machinery. Second, sensor kinases are recruited to arresting replication forks to phosphorylate mediator proteins that then recruit effector kinases. Third, these effector kinases are phosphorylated by sensor kinases. Finally, specific target proteins are phosphorylated, which eventually results in the stabilization of stalling replication forks, a reduction in the rate of DNA replication, and the activation of repair pathways (5.Gottifredi V.

Science. 2004; 303: 808-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (1650) Google Scholar). These three proteins were identified as components of the replisome progression complex, a large protein complex that was first identified biochemically and that includes GINS (go ichi ni san), the MCMs (minichromosome maintenance), Cdc45 (cell division cycle), and other proteins (11.Gambus A. Jones R.C. Sanchez-Diaz A. Kanemaki M. van Deursen F. Edmondson R.D. Labib K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 358-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Under conditions of replicative stress, activation of the effector kinase Rad53 is delayed in cells lacking any one of these mediator proteins (8.Alcasabas A.A. Osborn A.J. Bachant J. Hu F. Werler P.J. Bousset K. Furuya K. Diffley J.F. Carr A.M. Elledge S.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 958-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 12.Tanaka K. Russell P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 966-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Mrc1 is a substrate for the sensor kinase Mec1 and for the effector kinase Rad53 and directly interacts with Rad53 (13.Osborn A.J. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1755-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Thus, Mrc1 is thought to play a central role in the DNA replication checkpoint cascade. Recently, Tof1 and Csm3, but not Mrc1, were shown to be required for proper arrest at diverse chromosomal sites where non-nucleosomal proteins bind very tightly to DNA (14.Mohanty B.K. Bairwa N.K. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 897-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This suggests that the role of each protein during fork arrest may be different. Mrc1 may be required for maintaining the normal rate of replication fork progression as this is greatly reduced in the absence of this protein (15.Calzada A. Hodgson B. Kanemaki M. Bueno A. Labib K. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1905-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 16.Tourrière H. Versini G. Cordón-Preciado V. Alabert C. Pasero P. Mol.

In our current study, we report that both Tof1 and Csm3 are specifically required for the association of Mrc1 at replication forks. Using a baculovirus expression system, we further show that recombinant Tof1, Csm3, and Mrc1 proteins form a complex in insect cells in the absence of replication forks, which is consistent with the findings of previous in vivo studies of replication checkpoint mediators (11.Gambus A.

All yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table 1 and are derivatives of BY4741all (MATa, his3Δ1 leu2 Δ0 met15 Δ0 ura3 Δ0 trp1 Δ). In all strains, a HA3 tag or a FLAG3 tag coding sequence was fused to the sequence encoding the C terminus of the protein of interest; to achieve this, a cassette amplified from pU6H3HA or pU6H3FLAG, respectively, was used (21.De Antoni A. Gallwitz D. Gene. 2000; 246: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). All strains that expressed a tagged protein were examined for unaltered doubling times and sensitivity to HU and methyl methanesulfonate to verify the integrity of the cell phenotype. Gene deletions were performed by replacing the open reading frame of interest, including the start and stop codons, with a selective marker amplified by PCR from YIplac128, YIplac204, or YIplac211 as described previously (22.Hori Y.

Endogenous Mcm2 protein was detected using the goat polyclonal antibody sc-6680 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Chromatin immunoprecipitations on a DNA chip (ChIP-chip) were performed as described previously (20.Katou Y. Kanoh Y. Bando M. Noguchi H. Tanaka H. Ashikari T. Sugimoto K. Shirahige K. Nature. 2003; 424: 1078-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 23.Katou Y. Kaneshiro K. Aburatani H. Shirahige K. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 409: 389-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To examine all of chromosome VI, the RikDacF DNA chip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) was used. Cells (1.5 × 108) were disrupted with a Multi-bead shocker (MB400U; Yasui Kikai, Osaka, Japan). The DNA to be used in the ChIP analysis was purified and then amplified by random-priming PCR. Hybridization, washing, and array scanning were performed using the Affymetrix GeneChip system according to the manufacturer's instructions. To discriminate between positive and negative probe binding signals, three criteria were adopted. First, the reliability of the signal strength was evaluated using the detection p value for each locus (p value ≤0.025). Second, the reliability of the binding ratio was evaluated by determining the change in the p value (for p values ≤0.025). Third, clusters consisting of at least three contiguous loci that satisfied the above two criteria in two independent experiments were selected. The latter criterion was included because a single site of protein-DNA interaction will result in immunoprecipitation of DNA fragments that hybridize not only to the locus of the actual binding site, but also to neighboring loci (20.Katou Y. Kanoh Y. Bando M. Noguchi H. Tanaka H. Ashikari T. Sugimoto K. Shirahige K. Nature. 2003; 424: 1078-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 23.Katou Y. Kaneshiro K. Aburatani H. Shirahige K. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 409: 389-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). BrdUrd incorporation analyses were performed as previously described (23.Katou Y. Kaneshiro K. Aburatani H. Shirahige K. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 409: 389-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). PCR amplification was performed using the Applied Biosystems 7500 real time PCR system (ABI, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primer pair 185-kb 5′-CCTCCAAATCCACTGTTACTGCTATCC-3′ and 5′-CCATTGTTACTGGTCTTGTCCTTCTTGC-3′ was used to amplify the region of chromosome VI encompassing positions 184962–185178, and the primer pair 196-kb 5′-TGTAATACTCCTCAAAGGTCCTCC-3′ and 5′-GAAGACAACGACGAAGAACTAGC-3′ was used for the region 196898–197077. G1-arrested cells were prepared by treatment with α-factor (2 μm) for 2.5 h at 23 °C. To prepare HU-treated cells, G1-arrested cells were released into medium containing 200 mm HU for the indicated times at 23 °C as previously described (20.Katou Y. Kanoh Y. Bando M. Noguchi H. Tanaka H. Ashikari T. Sugimoto K. Shirahige K. Nature. 2003; 424: 1078-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). To prepare cells in S phase without HU treatment, cells were released from G1 arrest into S phase by incubation for 40 or 60 min at 16 °C. To prepare G2-arrested cells, asynchronously growing cells were treated with 15 μg/ml of nocodazole for 2.5 h at 23 °C. To analyze the chromosomal localization of Csm3 and Tof1 during unperturbed S phase, cells expressing a tagged version of each protein were arrested in G1 using α-factor and then released into S phase by incubation at 16 °C in the presence of 100 μg/ml of Pronase to slow the rate of DNA synthesis as described previously (24.Aparicio O.M. Weinstein D.M. Bell S.P. Cell. 1997; 91: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Synchronized cells in various phases of growth were harvested and washed twice in 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride as described previously (20.Katou Y. Kanoh Y. Bando M. Noguchi H. Tanaka H. Ashikari T. Sugimoto K. Shirahige K. Nature. 2003; 424: 1078-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). The cells were then suspended in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitors, 1× Complete (Roche Diagnostics) and 1% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and phosphatase inhibitors, 10 mm sodium fluoride and 20 mm glycerol 2-phosphate disodium salt hydrate. The cells were then disrupted using a Multi-bead shocker and the resulting lysate was treated with 200 units of DNase I (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan) at 4 °C for 15 min and then centrifuged at 20,000 × g to prepare a clear whole cell extract. The lysate was then pre-cleared by incubation with Dynabeads Protein A (Invitrogen) for 30 min. After pre-clearing, the lysate was incubated for 3 h with either anti-FLAG (M2; Sigma) or anti-HA (12CA5; Roche Diagnostics) conjugated with Dynabeads Protein A. After immunoprecipitation, samples were washed four times with lysis buffer and resuspended in SDS loading buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% sodium lauryl sulfate, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptethanol). DNA sequences encoding Mrc1 and Tof1 were cloned into the Bac-to-Bac pFastBac H/T baculovirus expression vector (Invitrogen). Sequences encoding FLAG or HA epitope tag were introduced at the N terminus of the Tof1 coding sequence. Mrc1 was tagged by the FLAG tag at its N terminus. Bacmid was prepared following the manufacturer's instructions and transfected into Sf9 insect cells (Invitrogen). The sequence encoding Csm3 with an N-terminal HA tag was cloned into the pAcUW31 vector (BD Biosciences). For expression of Csm3, BaculoGold Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus DNA (BaculoGold AcNPV; BD Biosciences) and the pAcUW31 vector containing the HA-tagged csm3 gene were co-transfected into Sf9 cells. Expression of the recombinant proteins was verified by immunoblotting. For protein expression, Sf9 cells were grown at 27 °C in Grace's insect medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and infected with the indicated viruses. Cells were harvested 2 days after infection, and extracts were prepared using lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1× Complete protease inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics) containing 0.5% Triton X-100). Extracts were cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was immunoprecipitated in the presence of M2-agarose (Sigma) for 2 h. The immunoprecipitated beads were then washed four times in lysis buffer containing 300 mm NaCl and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The elution of precipitated proteins was performed using 0.5 mg/ml FLAG-peptide (Sigma). The eluate was then immunoprecipitated again in the presence of anti-HA-agarose beads for 1 h and eluted with SDS loading buffer without boiling. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained using the Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining kit (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan). Previous biochemical studies have revealed that Tof1, Mrc1, and Csm3 are components of the replisome progression complex (11.Gambus A. Jones R.C. Sanchez-Diaz A. Kanemaki M. van Deursen F. Edmondson R.D. Labib K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 358-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 25.Nedelcheva M.N. Roguev A. Dolapchiev L.B. Shevchenko A. Taskov H.B. Shevchenko A. Stewart A.F. Stoynov S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 347: 509-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To confirm the S phase-specific association of Tof1 and Csm3 with the DNA replication forks, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments using cells that co-expressed Tof1-FLAG3 and Csm3-HA3 (Fig. 1, A and B). The data clearly demonstrated that these proteins physically interact with Mcm2 in vivo and do so specifically during S phase with or without HU, an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase (Fig. 1, A and B). To confirm the localization of Csm3 on chromosome VI during DNA replication in S phase, we performed ChIP-chip analysis (chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with DNA chip analysis) of Csm3 during S phase in the presence and absence of HU (Fig. 1, C and D). Cells were arrested in G1 using α-factor and then released into S phase in the presence or absence of 200 mm HU. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was then performed using cells expressing Csm3-FLAG3 or Tof1-HA3. The localization of Csm3 correlated well with that of Tof1, which has been reported to form a complex with Csm3 and to localize to replication forks (20.Katou Y. Kanoh Y. Bando M. Noguchi H. Tanaka H. Ashikari T. Sugimoto K. Shirahige K. Nature. 2003; 424: 1078-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 25.Nedelcheva M.N. Roguev A. Dolapchiev L.B. Shevchenko A. Taskov H.B. Shevchenko A. Stewart A.F. Stoynov S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 347: 509-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In the presence of HU, both proteins were localized only at the early firing origins (Fig. 1C). In cells in S phase without HU treatment, Tof1 and Csm3 were initially localized at early firing origins and then moved away from the replication origins at a similar rate with time (Fig. 1D). These data suggest that Csm3 is a component of moving replication forks, similar to the other known mediator proteins, Tof1 and Mrc1. Interestingly, we observed similar levels of enrichment of Tof1 and Csm3 in HU-treated cells at replication forks, but when we performed ChIP-chip analysis of Csm3 during early S phase, we reproducibly observed more enrichment of Csm3 than Tof1 at the forks (Fig. 1D). This may suggest that the binding of Csm3 and Tof1 to replication forks differs between cells in normal S phase and those in S phase under HU-induced replicative stress. We previously demonstrated that Mrc1 and Tof1 are components of the DNA replication forks and are required for the stable pausing of these forks under replicative stress induced by HU. In the absence of Mrc1 or Tof1, and in the presence of HU, replication forks do not arrest properly, and replication proteins become uncoupled from the replicated regions of the DNA (20.Katou Y. Kanoh Y. Bando M. Noguchi H. Tanaka H. Ashikari T. Sugimoto K. Shirahige K. Nature. 2003; 424: 1078-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). To address whether Csm3 functions in a similar manner, we examined the progression of DNA replication in the csm3 deletion mutant strain csm3Δ in the presence of HU. Using the ChIP-chip method, we analyzed the chromosome-wide localization of Cdc45, a component of replication forks, and measured BrdUrd incorporation to assess DNA synthesis (20.Katou Y. Kanoh Y. Bando M. Noguchi H. Tanaka H. Ashikari T. Sugimoto K. Shirahige K. Nature. 2003; 424: 1078-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). The cells were arrested by α-factor in G1 and then released into S phase in the presence of 200 mm HU. Chromatin immunoprecipitation using anti-HA (to detect Cdc45-HA3) and anti-BrdUrd was then performed. In csm3Δ cells, the distribution of the BrdUrd-incorporated regions in chromosomes was essentially equivalent (or even slightly more restricted) to that in wild-type cells, and Cdc45 progressed 1–2 kb further than in wild-type cells in the presence of HU (Fig. 2A). These results suggest that a partial uncoupling of the replication machinery took place in the replicated regions, similar to that observed in our previous report (20.Katou Y. Kanoh Y. Bando M. Noguchi H. Tanaka H. Ashikari T. Sugimoto K. Shirahige K. Nature. 2003; 424: 1078-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) using tof1Δ or mrc1Δ mutant strains in the presence of HU. The extent of this uncoupling in the csm3Δ strain was, however, less pronounced than that observed in the tof1 or mrc1 deletion mutants. In the csm3Δ mutant also, Cdc45 was detected at the late firing origin ARS608. Because the activity of the late firing origin is suppressed in response to HU-induced DNA replication checkpoint activation (26.Santocanale C. Diffley J.F. Nature. 1998; 395: 615-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), these data suggest that csm3Δ is partially defective for DNA replication checkpoint activation in response to HU. To next examine the role of Csm3 during normal progression of S phase, we analyzed the distribution of Cdc45 and BrdUrd in the absence of HU during early DNA replication (Fig. 2B). Cells were arrested in G1 using α-factor and then released for 60 min at 16 °C to allow slow progression of S phase (20.Katou Y. Kanoh Y. Bando M. Noguchi H. Tanaka H. Ashikari T. Sugimoto K. Shirahige K. Nature. 2003; 424: 1078-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). In both wild-type and csm3Δ cells, BrdUrd incorporation and Cdc45 localization were detected around the early replicating regions and there were no differences observed in the localization patterns of Cdc45 and BrdUrd between the wild-type and csm3Δ strains (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that, similar to Mrc1 or Tof1, Csm3 is required to couple the replication machinery with the replicated DNA regions in the presence of HU. Csm3 forms a tight complex with Tof1 (27.Mayer M.L. Pot I. Chang M. Xu H. Aneliunas V. Kwok T. Newitt R. Aebersold R. Boone C. Brown G.W. Hieter P. Mol. Biol.

To thus examine whether these proteins are co-dependent for their association with replication forks, we analyzed the interaction of Csm3 or Tof1 with Mcm2, a member of the helicase complex, by co-immunoprecipitation analysis (Fig. 1A). A sequence encoding a HA3 epitope tag was fused to the chromosomal copy of tof1 or csm3, and each tagged protein was expressed in the absence of its counterpart to assess its interaction with endogenous Mcm2. The cells were synchronized in G1 and then released into S phase for 40 or 60 min in the presence of HU at 23 °C (Fig. 3A). We confirmed that the c"
https://openalex.org/W2004970916,"The authors show that the LIM homeodomain transcription factor Lhx2 is responsible for the fate decision of cortical progenitors to generate neocortex or olfactory cortex. Conditional deletion of Lhx2 in telencephalic progenitors refated them to generate three-layer cortex resembling olfactory cortex, rather than lateral neocortex. Cerebral cortex is comprised of regions, including six-layer neocortex and three-layer olfactory cortex, generated by telencephalic progenitors of an Emx1 lineage. The mechanism specifying region-specific subpopulations in this lineage is unknown. We found that the LIM homeodomain transcription factor Lhx2 in mice, expressed in graded levels by progenitors, determines their regional identity and fate decisions to generate neocortex or olfactory cortex. Deletion of Lhx2 with Emx1-cre at embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5) altered the fates of progenitors, causing them to generate three-layer cortex, phenocopying olfactory cortex rather than lateral neocortex. Progenitors did not generate ectopic olfactory cortex following Lhx2 deletion at E11.5. Thus, Lhx2 regulates a regional-fate decision by telencephalic progenitors during a critical period that ends as they differentiate from neuroepithelial cells to neuronogenic radial glia. These findings establish a genetic mechanism for determining regional-fate in the Emx1 lineage of telencephalic progenitors that generate cerebral cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2093035155,"We have previously demonstrated that the replacement of the S gene from an avirulent strain (Beaudette) of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) with an S gene from a virulent strain (M41) resulted in a recombinant virus (BeauR-M41(S)) with the in vitro cell tropism of the virulent virus but that was still avirulent. In order to investigate whether any of the other structural or accessory genes played a role in pathogenicity we have now replaced these from the Beaudette strain with those from M41. The recombinant IBV was in effect a chimaeric virus with the replicase gene derived from Beaudette and the rest of the genome from M41. This demonstrated that it is possible to exchange a large region of the IBV genome, approximately 8.4 kb, using our transient dominant selection method. Recovery of a viable recombinant IBV also demonstrated that it is possible to interchange a complete replicase gene as we had in effect replaced the M41 replicase gene with the Beaudette derived gene. Analysis of the chimaeric virus showed that it was avirulent indicating that none of the structural or accessory genes derived from a virulent isolate of IBV were able to restore virulence and that therefore, the loss of virulence associated with the Beaudette strain resides in the replicase gene."

Ji et al. (p. 278 ; see the Perspective by Martin and Ruf ) describe an adult Mesozoic fossil mammal, in a lineage that led to both marsupials and placentals, in which the middle ear is still ossified to the jaw. Recent developmental studies have shown that the release of the ear is tied to multiple genes and signaling pathways during development. Together, these data suggest how gene patterning may have led to the early evolution of the mammalian ear."

https://openalex.org/W2073124845,"Reduced NO is a hallmark of endothelial dysfunction, and among the mechanisms for impaired NO synthesis is the accumulation of the endogenous nitric-oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). Free ADMA is actively metabolized by the intracellular enzyme dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), which catalyzes the conversion of ADMA to citrulline. Decreased DDAH expression/activity is evident in disease states associated with endothelial dysfunction and is believed to be the mechanism responsible for increased methylarginines and subsequent ADMA-mediated endothelial nitric-oxide synthase impairment. Two isoforms of DDAH have been identified; however, it is presently unclear which is responsible for endothelial ADMA metabolism and NO regulation. The current study investigated the effects of both DDAH-1 and DDAH-2 in the regulation of methylarginines and endothelial NO generation. Results demonstrated that overexpression of DDAH-1 and DDAH-2 increased endothelial NO by 24 and 18%, respectively. Moreover, small interfering RNA-mediated down-regulation of DDAH-1 and DDAH-2 reduced NO bioavailability by 27 and 57%, respectively. The reduction in NO production following DDAH-1 gene silencing was associated with a 48% reduction in l-Arg/ADMA and was partially restored with l-Arg supplementation. In contrast, l-Arg/ADMA was unchanged in the DDAH-2-silenced cells, and l-Arg supplementation had no effect on NO. These results clearly demonstrate that DDAH-1 and DDAH-2 manifest their effects through different mechanisms, the former of which is largely ADMA-dependent and the latter ADMA-independent. Overall, the present study demonstrates an important regulatory role for DDAH in the maintenance of endothelial function and identifies this pathway as a potential target for treating diseases associated with decreased NO bioavailability.

Altered NO biosynthesis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, and evidence from animal models and clinical studies suggests that accumulation of the endogenous nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors, asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and NG- methyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA) contribute to reduced NO generation and disease pathogenesis (1.Palmer R.M.

Nature. 1984; 308: 645-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). ADMA and l-NMMA are derived from the proteolysis of methylated arginine residues on various proteins. The methylation is carried out by a group of enzymes referred to as protein-arginine methyltransferases (3.Leiper J. Vallance P. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 43: 542-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Protein arginine methylation has been identified as an important post-translational modification involved in the regulation of DNA transcription, protein function, and cell signaling (4.Bedford M.T.

Upon proteolysis of methylated proteins, free methylarginines are released and can function as competitive inhibitors of NOS activity. The intracellular levels of these free methylarginines are regulated through their metabolism to citrulline by the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) (6.Vallance P. Leiper J.

The most compelling evidence for DDAH involvement in endothelial dysfunction has come from studies using DDAH gene silencing techniques and DDAH transgenic mice. Specifically, Cooke and co-workers (9.Tanaka M. Sydow K. Gunawan F. Jacobi J. Tsao P.S. Robbins R.C. Cooke J.P.

Other laboratories have demonstrated that DDAH overexpression inhibits ADMA-mediated endothelial function in cerebral arteries and can enhance insulin sensitivity through modulation of nitric oxide (23.Dayoub H.

Conversely, in vivo DDAH-2 gene silencing had no effect on plasma ADMA but reduced endothelium-dependent relaxation by 40% (11.Wang D. Gill P.S. Chabrashvili T. Onozato M.L. Raggio J. Mendonca M.

These latter findings are particularly intriguing and demonstrate that elevated plasma ADMA is not associated with impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation, whereas loss of DDAH-2 activity is associated with impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation, despite the fact the plasma ADMA levels are not increased (11.Wang D. Gill P.S. Chabrashvili T. Onozato M.L. Raggio J. Mendonca M. Dennehy K. Li M. Modlinger P. Leiper J. Vallance P. Adler O. Leone A. Tojo A. Welch W.J. Wilcox C.S. Circ.

These findings are further supported by a recent study demonstrating that down-regulation of DDAH-2 in response to hyperhomocysteinemia was not associated with increased plasma ADMA (25.Dayal S.

Given the obvious inconsistencies in the literature regarding the individual roles of DDAH-1 and DDAH-2, the current study establishes the specific role of each DDAH isoform in the regulation of endothelial NO production and its potential role in disease pathogenesis. Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) were purchased from Cell Systems and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) containing 10% FBS, 1% NEAA, 0.2% endothelial cell growth factor supplement, and 1% antibotic-antimyotic (Invitrogen) and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2, 95% O2. Spin trapping measurements of NO were performed using a Bruker E-scan spectrometer with Fe2+-MGD (0.5 mm Fe2+, 5.0 mm MGD) as the spin trap (22.Lin K.Y. Ito A. Asagami T. Tsao P.S. Adimoolam S.

For measurements of NO produced by BAECs, cells were cultured as described above, and spin trapping experiments were performed on cells grown in 6-well plates. Attached cells were studied because scraping or enzymatic removal leads to injury and membrane damage with impaired NO generation. The medium from ∼1 × 106 cells attached to the surface of the 6-well plates was removed, and the cells were washed three times in KREBS and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in 0.2 ml of KRBES buffer containing the spin trap complex Fe2+-MGD, and the cells were stimulated with calcium ionophore (1 μm). Subsequent measurements of NO production were performed following a 30-min incubation period. Spectra recorded from cellular preparations were obtained using the following parameters: microwave power, 20 milliwatts; modulation amplitude, 3.00 G; modulation frequency, 86 kHz. BAECs were collected from confluent 75-mm culture flasks and sonicated in PBS followed by extraction using a cation exchange column. Samples were derivatized with O-phthaldialdehyde and separated on a Supelco LC-DABS column (4.6 × 25 cm inner diameter, 5 μm particle size), and methylarginines were separated and detected using an ESA (Chelmsford, MA) HPLC system with electrochemical detection at 400 mV. Homoarginine was added to the homogenate as an internal standard to correct for the efficiency of extraction. The mobile phase consisted of buffer A (50 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.0) and buffer B (acetonitrile/MeOH, 70:30) run at room temperature with a flow rate of 1.3 ml/min. The following gradient method was used: 0–10 min, 90% A; 10–40 min, a linear gradient from 90% A to 30% A (22.Lin K.Y. Ito A. Asagami T. Tsao P.S. Adimoolam S. Kimoto M. Tsuji H. Reaven G.M.

Control cells received scrambled siRNA also purchased from Ambion. 400 μl of nuclease-free water was added to the dried oligonucleotides to obtain a final concentration of 100 μm. Transfections were performed using the lipid-mediated transfection reagent RNAiMax (Invitrogen). The procedure was as follows. 240 nm or 5 μl of siRNA per well of a 6-well plate was diluted into 250 μl of OptiMEM (Invitrogen), and 5 μl of RNAiMax was diluted in 250 μl of Opti-MEM. The siRNA and RNAiMax were then combined into one Eppendorf tube and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. Following the 20-min incubation period, the RNAiMax-siRNA complexes were added to each well of a 6-well plate. The mixture was rocked back and forth to allow for coating of the entire well. BAECs were trypsinized and spun down at 200 × g for 4 min and then resuspended in 1.5 ml of OptiMEM plus 10% minimum essential medium containing 10% FBS, 1% NEAA, 0.2% endothelial cell growth factor. The cells were then added on top of the RNAiMax-siRNA complexes and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2, 95% O2 for 6 h. After the 6-h incubation period, 1 ml of minimum essential medium containing 10% FBS, 1% NEAA, 0.2% endothelial cell growth factor was added. 24 h later, 1 ml of minimum essential medium containing 10% FBS, 1% NEAA, 0.2% endothelial cell growth factor was added. At 48 h, 2 ml of medium was removed and replaced with fresh minimum essential medium containing 10% FBS, 1% NEAA, 0.2% endothelial cell growth factor, and the transfection was continued for an additional 24 h. Following the 72-h siRNA transduction period, BAECs were trypsinized and pelleted at 200 × g for 4 min. The cell pellet was then washed one time with PBS and centrifuged at 200 × g for an additional 4 min. The cell pellet was then homogenized in the lysis buffer. Following lysis, RNA was extracted using a Qiagen (Valencia, CA) RNAeasy minikit. cDNA was then isolated using the Invitrogen One Step reverse transcription-PCR kit. Semiquantitative PCR was performed in order to detect changes in mRNA expression following DDAH-1 or DDAH-2 gene silencing. Bovine primers for DDAH-1 forward (GAGGAAGGAGGCTGACATGA), DDAH-1 reverse (TTCAAGTGCAAAGCATCCAC), DDAH-2 forward (CTAGCCAAAGCTCAGAGGGACAT), and DDAH-2 reverse (TCAGTCAACACTGCCATTGCCCT) were purchased from Invitrogen. DDAH activity was measured from the conversion of l-[3H]NMMA to l-[3H]citrulline. A T-75 flask was used for each measurement. BAECs were trypsinized, pelleted, and resuspended in 150 μl of 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4). The cells were then sonicated three times for 2 s each, and 150 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm Tris, 20 μm l-[3H]NMMA, 180 μm l-NMMA, pH 7.4) was added. The samples were then incubated in a water bath at 37 °C for 90 min. Following the 90-min incubation, the reaction was stopped with 1 ml of ice-cold stop buffer (20 mm HEPES with 2 mm EDTA, pH 5.5) (15.Gray G.A. Patrizio M. Sherry L. Miller A.A. Malaki M. Wallace A.F. Leiper J.M. Vallance P. Acta Histochem. 2009; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Separation of l-[3H]citrulline from l-[3H]NMMA was performed using the cation exchange resin Dowex AG50WX-8 (0.5 ml, Na+ form; Amersham Biosciences). The l-[3H]citrulline in the eluent was then quantified using a liquid scintillation counter. Following the 48 h of Ad-DDAH-1 (50 MOI) or Ad-DDAH-2 (50 MOI) transduction, cells were trypsinized and pelleted at 1000 × g for 4 min. The cell pellet was then washed one time with PBS and centrifuged at 200 × g for an additional 4 min. The cell pellet was then homogenized using radioimmune precipitation buffer containing sodium orthovanadate (2 mm), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), and protease inhibitor mixture (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Following homogenization, the cell pellet was briefly sonicated three times for 2 s each. Protein concentration was quantified using the Bradford assay. 1× sample buffer containing dithiothreitol was added to 40 μg of protein and boiled at 95 °C for 3 min and then spun down briefly and cooled for 2 min. The samples were then loaded on an SDS Tris-glycine gradient gel, 4–12% (Invitrogen), and run at 130 V for 2 h. The gel was then removed, and the protein was transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane using the semidry transfer blot system (Bio-Rad). Following the transfer, the nitrocellulose membrane was blocked for 1 h in Tris-buffered saline and 0.05% Tween (TBST) with 5% milk powder. After the blocking period, the membrane was washed three times for 5 min each with TBST, and then the respective primary antibody was added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. DDAH was detected by anti-DDAH-1 and anti-DDAH-2 rabbit IgG obtained from Dr. Renke Mass (Hamburg, Germany) and diluted 1:500. Following the overnight incubation with the primary antibody, the membrane was washed for 15 min three times with TBST, and the secondary goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-tagged antibody diluted 1:2000 was added. After 1 h of incubation at room temperature, detection was performed using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit purchased from Amersham Biosciences. eNOS activity was measured from the conversion of l-[14C]arginine to l-[14C]citrulline. A T-75 flask was used for each measurement. BAECs were trypsinized, pelleted, and resuspended in 132 μl of 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4). The cells were then sonicated three times for 2 s each in 28 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm Tris containing 5 μm l-[14C]arginine, 50 μm l-arginine, 500 μm NADPH, 50 μm CaCl2, 10 μm tetrahydrobiopterin, pH 7.4). The samples were then incubated in a water bath at 37 °C for 30 min. Following the 30-min incubation, the reaction was stopped with 1 ml of ice-cold stop buffer (20 mm HEPES with 2 mm EDTA, pH 5.5). Separation of l-[14C]arginine from l-[14C]citrulline was performed using the cation exchange resin Dowex AG50WX-8 (0.5 ml of Na+ form; Amersham Biosciences). The l-[14C]citrulline in the eluent was then quantitated using a liquid scintillation counter.

However, it is presently unknown which of the DDAH isoforms is responsible for the regulation of endothelial NO. Therefore, studies were carried out using adenovirus-mediated overexpression of both DDAH-1 and DDAH-2 in order to determine which isoform is responsible for endothelial methylarginine metabolism and NO regulation. Endothelial cells were grown to 90% confluence and then transduced with either Ad-DDAH-1 (10–50 MOI) or Ad-DDAH-2 (10–50 MOI) for 48 h. Western blot analysis demonstrated dose-dependent increases in endothelial expression of both DDAH-1 and DDAH-2 following respective adenoviral treatment (Fig. 1A). Additional studies were performed to assess the effects of DDAH overexpression on DDAH activity. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of DDAH-1 (50 MOI) resulted in a nearly 2-fold increase in DDAH activity (Fig. 1B) Surprisingly, DDAH-2 overexpression did not result in a statistically significant increase in total DDAH activity despite a robust increase in protein expression. This is probably due to our preliminary observations that DDAH-2 catalytic activity is nearly 10 times less than that of DDAH-1 3A. J. Pope, K. Karrupiah, P. N. Kearns, Y. Xia, and A. J. Cardounel, unpublished results. and is supported by previous studies demonstrating that increased DDAH-2 expression is not associated with an increase in total cellular DDAH activity (26.Li Volti G.

Anesthesiology. 2008; 109: 1054-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). At the end of the 48-h period, NO production was measured by EPR as described previously. Results demonstrated that following 48 h of transduction, Ad-DDAH-1 (50 MOI)-mediated overexpression resulted in a 24% increase in NO production over basal NO levels (Fig. 2). HPLC analysis of intracellular ADMA and l-Arg demonstrated that although DDAH-1 overexpression increased the l-Arg/ADMA ratio by 27%, DDAH-2 gene silencing had no significant effect (Table 1). It was anticipated that if DDAH-1 overexpression is increasing NO through the metabolism of methylarginines, then l-Arg supplementation should prevent the increase. Endothelial cells were transduced with Ad-DDAH-1 (50 MOI) for 48 h as described previously. After the 48-h exposure, the medium was removed, and BAECs were incubated with l-Arg (100 μm) for 30 min in KREBS-HEPES buffer. Results demonstrated that l-Arg supplementation alone resulted in a 30% increase in basal NO production in control cells (Fig. 2). Moreover, in the presence of DDAH-1 overexpression, l-Arg supplementation resulted in an additive effect with a 13% increase in NO compared with l-Arg supplementation alone.FIGURE 2Effects of DDAH-1 overexpression on endothelial cell NO production.

Similar results were obtained with l-Arg supplementation of DDAH-2-overexpressing cells in which we observed a 45% increase NO production following the addition of l-Arg compared with a 28% increase with l-Arg supplementation alone (Fig. 3). The observation that the effects of l-Arg supplementation on NO production are not attenuated in the presence of DDAH-1 or DDAH-2 overexpression clearly demonstrates that ADMA is not responsible for the “arginine paradox” as has been proposed (27.Cooke J.P. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 2032-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Moreover, the ability of DDAH-2 overexpression to enhance endothelial NO production appears to be independent of ADMA because levels of this competitive NOS inhibitor were unaltered by DDAH-2 overexpression (Table 1). The previous studies assessed the effects of DDAH overexpression on NO production in the presence of normal physiological levels of methylarginine. Given that normal intracellular methylarginines are in the low micromolar range, it would not be expected that physiological levels of these competitive NOS inhibitors would elicit pathological eNOS inhibition. Therefore, additional studies were performed in the presence of exogenously added ADMA to assess whether DDAH overexpression can overcome ADMA accumulation at levels observed with cardiovascular disease states (18.Cardounel A.J. Cui H. Samouilov A. Johnson W. Kearns P. Tsai A.L. Berka V. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 879-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Results demonstrated that exogenously added ADMA (10 μm) resulted in 40% inhibition of endothelial cell NO production from BAECs and that overexpression of either DDAH-1 or DDAH-2 was able to restore ∼50% of the loss in endothelial NO production (Fig. 4). These results indicate that both DDAH-1 and DDAH-2 may serve as potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of diseases associated with elevated ADMA. Previous studies have suggested that a decrease in DDAH activity, as has been observed in vascular disease, contributes to endothelial dysfunction through a mechanism involving increased cellular ADMA levels. In support, ADMA levels are an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and results from numerous clinical and basic science studies have revealed increased ADMA levels in a variety of diseases, including diabetes, pulmonary hypertension, coronary artery disease, and atherosclerosis (16.Achan V.

Understanding the regulation of histone deacetylase activities is extremely important because these enzymes play key roles in epigenetic regulation in normal and cancer cells. We previously showed that HDAC1 is required for glucocorticoid receptor-mediated transcription activation and that its activity is regulated through acetylation by p300 during the induction cycle. Here, we showed that HDAC2 is also required for glucocorticoid receptor-mediated gene activation. HDAC2, however, is regulated through a different mechanism from that of HDAC1. HDAC2 is not acetylated by p300, although 5 of 6 acetylated lysine residues in HDAC1 are also present in HDAC2. More importantly, the activity of HDAC2 is inhibited by acetylated HDAC1. Additionally, we showed that acetylated HDAC1 can trans-regulate HDAC2 through heterodimerization. Thus, this study uncovered fundamental differences between HDAC1 and HDAC2. It also unveiled a new mechanism of collaborative regulation by HDAC1/2 containing coregulator complexes.

Histone deacetylases are responsible for the deacetylation of lysine residues at the N-terminal part of the core histones as well as at non-histone proteins. Histone deacetylation plays an important role in transcriptional regulation, cell cycle progression, and developmental events and is often linked to epigenetic repression (1.Xu L. Glass C.K.

We recently reported that HDAC1 is required for glucocorticoid receptor (GR) 2The abbreviations used are: GRglucocorticoid receptorMMTVmouse mammary tumor virusshRNAshort hairpin RNAGSTglutathione S-transferaseDexdexamethasone. -mediated transcription activation. Furthermore, we showed that HDAC1 is acetylated after its association with the GR, and this acetylation event correlates with a change in promoter activity (8.Qiu Y. Zhao Y. Becker M. John S. Parekh B.S. Huang S. Hendarwanto A. Martinez E.D. Chen Y. Lu H. Adkins N.L. Stavreva D.A. Wiench M. Georgel P.T. Schiltz R.L. Hager G.L. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 669-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The acetylated HDAC1 loses its deacetylase activity. The majority of acetylated lysine residues of HDAC1 are present in the C-terminal regulatory domain, which reveals only partial homology to the corresponding region of HDAC2. The C-terminal domain of HDAC1 does not have any catalytic activity. The deletion of this region, however, greatly reduces deacetylase activity (21.Hassig C.A. Fleischer T.C. Billin A.N. Schreiber S.L. Ayer D.E. Cell. 1997; 89: 341-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar), indicating that the C-terminal domain plays an indispensable role in the regulation of deacetylase activity. Therefore, it is important to compare the C-terminal regions of HDAC1 and HDAC2 functionally and structurally and to determine how these domains collaborate in the regulation of transcription. In this study, we show that HDAC2 is also important for GR-mediated gene activation; however, in contrast to HDAC1, HDAC2 is not acetylated. However, a chimeric protein, in which the C-terminal tail of HDAC2 was swapped with the corresponding region of HDAC1, can be acetylated. More importantly, we showed that acetylated HDAC1 not only inhibits its own deacetylase activity, but also, through direct interaction with HDAC2, abolishes the deacetylase activity of HDAC2. Furthermore, this study provides further insight into the regulation of the deacetylase activity of HDAC1/2 containing coregulator complexes. glucocorticoid receptor mouse mammary tumor virus short hairpin RNA glutathione S-transferase dexamethasone. The CherryFP-NF1A1.1 (ChFP-NF1) construct was generated by ligating NF1A1.1 cDNA (kindly provided by R. M. Gronostajski, State University of New York, Buffalo) to a ChFP-C1 vector, which was generated by replacing green fluorescent protein in the pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) vector with Cherry fluorescent protein (22.Shaner N.C.

The GFP-HDAC1 plasmids were described previously (8.Qiu Y. Zhao Y. Becker M. John S. Parekh B.S. Huang S. Hendarwanto A. Martinez E.D. Chen Y. Lu H. Adkins N.L. Stavreva D.A. Wiench M. Georgel P.T.

The GFP-HDAC2 construct was generated by subcloning mouse HDAC2 into a GFP-C1 vector. HDAC1 K432R, HDAC2 R433K, HDAC1 H141A, and HDAC2 H142A were constructed using site-directed mutagenesis according to the manufacturer's protocol (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). HDAC1 and HDAC2 tail swapping mutants were constructed by first creating an EcoRI site at amino acids 419 and 420 of HDAC1 and 420 and 421 of HDAC2 without altering the amino acid sequence. The mutant constructs were then digested with EcoRI and the C-terminal cloning enzyme XhoI to release the C-terminal fragment of HDAC1 or HDAC2, respectively. The purified vector that contained HDAC1-(1–420) was then ligated with a purified HDAC2 C-terminal fragment to create HDAC1–2T. HDAC2–1T was created using the same method. GST HDAC1-(1–67) was constructed by PCR. The integrity of all constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The 3134 cell line, as well as its derivative 3617 (expressing GFP-GR), was described previously (23.Walker D. Htun H. Hager G.L. Methods. 1999; 19: 386-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT). Cell line 6062, an NIH 3T3 derivative, which contains stably integrated copies of the MMTV promoter driving a luciferase reporter, was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. For HDAC1 and HDAC2 small interfering RNA transfections, 6062 cells were seeded in 12-well plates at 5 × 104 cells per well ∼24 h before transfection. HDAC1 and HDAC2 small interfering RNA were transfected with Oligofectamine according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Cells were incubated for 48 h and harvested for Western blot analysis to evaluate HDAC1 and HDAC2 levels, or the cells were treated with Dex (100 nm) and subjected to analysis for luciferase expression levels. HDAC2 siRNA sequences were cloned into pSuper retroviral vectors, and the recombinant virus was collected and used to infect 3134 cells. The single cell with a stable incorporation of HDAC2 shRNA was selected to produce a stable cell line. Prior to live cell imaging, 3617 cells, transiently transfected by electroporation with green fluorescent protein-tagged HDAC1 or HDAC2 and ChRFP-NF1, were transferred to 35-mm glass bottom dishes (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA) at a density of 2 × 105 cells/ml in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and 5 mg/ml tetracycline to suppress GFP-GR expression. The cells were cultured for at least 16 h and were subsequently treated with Dex (100 nm) for 1 h. All live imaging experiments were carried out on a Zeiss 510 confocal microscope with 100× 1.3-N.A. oil immersion objective, and the cells were kept at 37 °C using an air stream stage incubator (Nevtek, Williamsville, VA). Expression and purification of FLAG-tagged HDAC1, HDAC2, and mutants from baculovirus, as well as the in vitro acetylation assays, were performed as described previously (8.Qiu Y. Zhao Y. Becker M.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation against HDAC1 and HDAC2 was performed in control and knockdown cells as described elsewhere (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Briefly, soluble chromatin was immunoprecipitated with antibodies to HDAC1 and HDAC2. DNA isolated from precipitates at various time points was used as a template for PCR amplification. The following primers were used for amplification of the MMTV promoter: sense, 5′-GCGGTTCCCAAGGCTTAAGTAAGTTT-3′, and antisense, 5′-GGTGAATGTTAGGACTGTTGCAAGTT-3′. The transfection was performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). 24–48 h after transfection, the cells were harvested and lysed in a lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 20% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The immunoprecipitation and Western blot assays were performed as described previously (8.Qiu Y. Zhao Y. Becker M. John S. Parekh B.S. Huang S. Hendarwanto A. Martinez E.D. Chen Y. Lu H. Adkins N.L.

Bacteria-expressed GST or GST-HDAC1 proteins were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Pfizer, New York) and washed. The beads were then incubated with 35S-labeled, in vitro-synthesized HDAC1 and HDAC2 proteins in a GST binding buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture). The beads were then washed with the binding buffer, and the bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. The dried gels were then subjected to autoradiography. Previously, we found that HDAC1 is required for GR-mediated MMTV gene activation (8.Qiu Y. Zhao Y. Becker M. John S. Parekh B.S. Huang S. Hendarwanto A. Martinez E.D. Chen Y. Lu H. Adkins N.L.

Because HDAC1 and HDAC2 often coexist in the same coregulator complex and HDAC2 can interact with GR (26.Ito K. Yamamura S. Essilfie-Quaye S. Cosio B. Ito M. Barnes P.J. Adcock I.M. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), we investigated whether HDAC2 is also required for MMTV transcription. First, we determined whether HDAC2 is localized on MMTV chromatin. A GFP-HDAC2 expression construct was cotransfected into mouse mammary tumor cell line 3134 together with a DNA construct expressing ChFP-NF1A1.1, which binds to and identifies MMTV promoter sequences. The 3134 cell line contains ∼200 copies of an MMTV-reporter construct that is stably integrated at one position on chromosome 4 (27.Kramer P.R. Fragoso G. Pennie W. Htun H. Hager G.L. Sinden R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28590-28597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Just like GFP-HDAC1, GFP-HDAC2 clearly localizes to the MMTV array (Fig. 1A). We next examined whether the recruitment of HDAC1 or HDAC2 relies on each other. The stable HDAC2 knockdown cell lines were established by shRNA. The chromatin immunoprecipitation results confirmed that in a vector control cell line, both HDAC1 and HDAC2 bind to the promoter (Fig. 1B). In the HDAC2 knockdown cells, no HDAC2 binding was detected. HDAC1, however, binds to the promoter at a level comparable with the vector control cells, indicating that a lack of HDAC2 in the promoter does not affect the binding of HDAC1 (Fig. 1B). To determine whether HDAC2 regulates MMTV transcription, HDAC2 was transiently knocked down in cell line 6062, an NIH 3T3-based cell line harboring a stably integrated MMTV luciferase reporter construct (8.Qiu Y. Zhao Y. Becker M. John S. Parekh B.S. Huang S. Hendarwanto A. Martinez E.D. Chen Y. Lu H. Adkins N.L. Stavreva D.A. Wiench M. Georgel P.T. Schiltz R.L. Hager G.L. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 669-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The efficient knockdown of HDAC2 resulted in a slight increase in HDAC1 expression (Fig. 1C). Importantly, MMTV transcription was reduced by ∼40% by either HDAC1 or HDAC2 knockdown. The combined knockdown of both HDAC1 and HDAC2 further reduced MMTV transcription indicating that HDAC1 and HDAC2 act synergistically in the transcription activation of the MMTV gene promoter (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that HDAC1 and HDAC2 play nonredundant roles in activating the MMTV promoter. To further dissect the role of HDAC2 in MMTV transcription, an HDAC2 expression plasmid was transfected into 6062 cells. The results showed that HDAC2 can activate MMTV transcription just as HDAC1 can. In contrast, HDAC3, which is associated with NcoR/SMRT corepressor complexes, repressed MMTV transcription (Fig. 1D). We next investigated whether HDAC2 can also be acetylated. The homology between HDAC1 and -2 is particularly high in the N-terminal catalytic domain and somewhat lower in the C-terminal region. HDAC1 is acetylated at six lysine residues, four of which are located in the C-terminal region (Fig. 2A) (8.Qiu Y. Zhao Y. Becker M. John S. Parekh B.S. Huang S. Hendarwanto A. Martinez E.D. Chen Y.

Among these four acetylated lysines (lysines 432, 438, 439, and 441), three are present in HDAC2, whereas lysine 432 in HDAC1 corresponds to arginine 433 in HDAC2 (Fig. 2A). FLAG-tagged HDAC1 and HDAC2 were purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells through affinity chromatography (Fig. 2B). HDAC1 and HDAC2 proteins were then incubated with recombinant p300 in the presence of acetyl-CoA and characterized for the acetylation status by Western blot analysis with an anti-acetyl-lysine antibody. As shown in Fig. 2C, the incubation with p300 induced a significant level of acetylation of HDAC1 but not of HDAC2 in the presence or absence of HDAC1. Because acetylated lysine 432 in HDAC1 is not present in HDAC2 (Fig. 2A), it is possible that lysine 432 may be critical for HDAC1 acetylation, and arginine 433 of HDAC2 may be the key residue that prevents HDAC2 acetylation. To test these possibilities, lysine 432 in HDAC1 was mutated to arginine, and arginine 433 in HDAC2 was changed to lysine (Fig. 3A). The mutant proteins were then expressed and purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells. Because the C-terminal regions of HDAC1 and HDAC2 function as regulatory domains (21.Hassig C.A. Fleischer T.C. Billin A.N. Schreiber S.L. Ayer D.E. Cell. 1997; 89: 341-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar), it is important to determine that the mutation per se does not affect the enzymatic function. We first showed that the mutation alone does not change deacetylase activity of HDAC1 or HDAC2 in vitro. The histone deacetylase activities of these mutants were determined and compared with their wild type counterparts (Fig. 3B). We also determined that the mutations do not alter the transcription repression effects of HDAC1 and HDAC2 in vivo. HDAC1 K432R and HDAC2 R433K were subcloned into the GAL4 vector and cotransfected with a thymidine kinase minimum promoter driven luciferase reporter containing four GAL4 DNA-binding sites. The repression effect of the mutant proteins did not change when compared with the wild type proteins (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that the lysine and arginine substitution mutations at the HDAC1 and HDAC2 C-terminal regions did not affect their activities and functions. Next, we tested whether these mutations affect acetylation modification. The results showed that the acetylation of HDAC1 K432R by p300 is reduced. In contrast, the HDAC2 R433K mutant protein became acetylated by p300 (Fig. 3D). The observation that HDAC1 K432R only partially lost acetylation modification and HDAC2 R433K was only acetylated at low levels together with the fact that the C terminus is not as highly conserved between HDAC1 and HDAC2 led to the possibility that sequences flanking the acetylation sites are also required for the efficient acetylation of HDAC1. We next exchanged the C-terminal tails of HDAC1 and HDAC2 by ligating the N terminus of HDAC1 with the C-terminal tail of HDAC2 (HDAC1–2T) and vice versa (HDAC2–1T) (Fig. 3A). These mutated proteins are fully functional enzymes (Fig. 3B). However, HDAC1–2T cannot be acetylated by p300, whereas HDAC2–1T was acetylated at levels comparable with that of the wild type HDAC1 counterpart (Fig. 3D). This result indicates that although Lys-432 is an important residue for HDAC1 acetylation and Arg-433 is a critical residue for HDAC2 to prevent HDAC2 acetylation, the C-terminal flanking sequences around these residues are also important for acetylation modifications. To further test whether acetylated HDAC2–1T lost deacetylase activity as did wild type HDAC1, the purified wild type and tail swapping mutants of HDAC1 and HDAC2 proteins were incubated with p300. The reaction products were tested for deacetylase activity using acetylated histones. The deacetylase activity of acetylated HDAC2–1T was significantly inhibited (Fig. 3E). This result indicates that the C-terminal domain of HDAC1 is important for regulating the deacetylase activity of HDAC1. When the C-terminal region of HDAC1 was swapped for HDAC2, HDAC2–1T functions just like HDAC1, whereas HDAC1–2T behaved just like wild type HDAC2. Because HDAC1 and HDAC2 coexist in many corepressor complexes and HDAC2 is not acetylated although HDAC1 is, we investigated if and how HDAC2 activity is regulated. We first examined whether acetylated HDAC1 affects the deacetylase activity of HDAC2. Purified HDAC1 and/or HDAC2 proteins were incubated with p300 proteins in the presence of acetyl-CoA. The acetyl-CoA was then removed by dialysis, and acetylated core histones were subsequently added as substrates. As expected, HDAC1 was acetylated, and its deacetylase activity was inhibited by acetylation (Fig. 4A, lane 1). HDAC2 itself was not acetylated; therefore, its deacetylase activity was not affected by the reaction (Fig. 4A, lane 3). However, in the presence of acetylated HDAC1, HDAC2 was unable to deacetylate core histones (Fig. 4A, lane 2), despite the fact that the wild type nonacetylated HDAC1 and HDAC2 have an additive effect on deacetylase activity (Fig. 4B). The reduction of deacetylase activities from both enzymes correlated with increased concentration of p300 in the reaction, presumably due to the increased HDAC1 acetylation levels (Fig. 4C). This result indicates that acetylated HDAC1 not only inhibits its own deacetylase activity but also the deacetylase activity of HDAC2. It has been shown that the N-terminal region of HDAC1 can directly interact with HDAC1 and -2 in vitro (28.Taplick J. Kurtev V. Kroboth K. Posch M. Lechner T. Seiser C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We further determined the minimum sequences of HDAC1 and -2 interaction domains. The GST pulldown experiments were performed with 35S-labeled HDAC1 or -2 and GST HDAC1 deletion mutants. The results show that HDAC1 amino acids 20–40 are important for HDAC1 and -2 interactions (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, the sequences within this region are identical between HDAC1 and HDAC2. This result indicates that HDAC1 and -2 can form homo- and heterodimers with similar affinities. To test whether the inhibition of HDAC2 activity is mediated by direct interactions with acetylated HDAC1, and not by p300, we tested whether HDAC1 mutants that mimic acetylated HDAC1 (HDAC1 6Q, see Ref. 8.Qiu Y. Zhao Y. Becker M. John S. Parekh B.S. Huang S. Hendarwanto A. Martinez E.D. Chen Y. Lu H. Adkins N.L. Stavreva D.A. Wiench M. Georgel P.T. Schiltz R.L. Hager G.L. Mol.

Like acetylated HDAC1, HDAC1 6Q had no deacetylase activity. In this experiment, increased concentrations of recombinant HDAC1 6Q were incubated with wild type HDAC2. The HDAC1 6Q/HDAC2 mixture was then tested for deacetylase activity. The result showed that HDAC1 6Q inhibits the deacetylase activity of HDAC2 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5B). This result indicates that acetylated HDAC1 can directly inhibit the deacetylase activity of HDAC2. The acetylated HDAC1 also inhibited the deacetylase activity of nonacetylated HDAC1 in a similar manner (Fig. 5C). These results suggest that acetylated HDAC1 can directly inhibit the deacetylase activity of HDAC2 or HDAC1.FIGURE 5HDAC1 regulates HDAC2 activity through dimerization.

Although we showed that HDAC1 and HDAC2 can associate with each other via amino acids 20–40, it is unclear whether they form dimers or oligomers (28.Taplick J. Kurtev V. Kroboth K. Posch M. Lechner T. Seiser C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Because the crystal structures of HDAC homologous proteins histone deacetylase-like protein, from Aquifex aeolicus, and HDAC8 show that they form dimers (29.Finnin M.S. Donigian J.R. Cohen A. Richon V.M. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Breslow R. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1999; 401: 188-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar, 30.Vannini A. Volpari C. Filocamo G. Casavola E.C. Brunetti M. Renzoni D. Chakravarty P. Paolini C. De Francesco R. Gallinari P. Steinkühler C. Di Marco S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 15064-15069Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 31.Vannini A. Volpari C. Gallinari P. Jones P. Mattu M. Carfí A. De Francesco R. Steinkühler C. Di Marco S. EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 879-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), we speculated that HDAC1 and HDAC2 form dimers as well, either homodimers or heterodimers. There are two scenarios by which acetylated HDAC1 can affect HDAC2 activity. First, the conformation changes in acetylated HDAC1 may affect the conformation and activity of HDAC2; second, the loss of HDAC1 deacetylase activity may directly interfere with the activity of HDAC2. If the loss of deacetylase activity of HDAC1 is the key for acetylated HDAC1 to inhibit HDAC2 deacetylase activity, then a deacetylase-defective HDAC1 should also influence HDAC2 activity. We used an HDAC1 mutant (HDAC1 H141A) that has a point mutation in the catalytic core that results in a loss of HDAC1 deacetylase activity (Fig. 5D) (32.Taunton J. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1996; 272: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1541) Google Scholar). When incubating the purified HDAC1 H141A with wild type HDAC2, HDAC1 H141A inhibits HDAC2 deacetylase activity in a dose-dependent manner just like HDAC1 6Q did (Fig. 5E). This result indicates that HDAC1 regulates HDAC2 activity through its own deacetylase activity. Similarly, the deacetylase-defective HDAC2 mutant protein, HDAC2 H142A (Fig. 5D), can inhibit the deacetylase activity of HDAC1 (Fig. 5F). These results suggest that deacetylase-defective HDAC1 or HDAC2 can influence the activity of their wild type counterpart through dimer formation or oligomerization. There are two possibilities how the dimerization with defective mutants can inhibit wild type HDAC1 or HDAC2 deacetylase activity. One possibility is that HDAC1 6Q does not bind to histones. Thus, through dimerization with HDAC1 or -2, HDAC1 6Q sequesters wild type enzymes from histone substrates. We tested whether HDAC1 6Q can bind to histones. The FLAG-tagged HDAC1 or HDAC1 6Q was incubated with acetylated core histones. The reaction mixture was then immunoprecipitated with FLAG antibodies and Western-blotted for the presence of acetylated histone H4. The result shows that the wild type HDAC1 and 6Q can pull down similar amounts of acetylated H4 (Fig. 5G), indicating that 6Q does not inhibit the activity of wild type HDAC1 or -2 through sequestering them from the histone substrate. The second possibility is that two functional deacetylase domains are required to form an active HDAC1 homo- or heterodimer. Thus, HDAC1 6Q forms inactive dimers with wild type HDAC1 or -2. If this model is true, any dimer with only one functional deacetylase domain will not be active. We tested this model by examining the activity of dimers containing full-length wild type HDAC1 and truncated HDAC1 that contains only the dimerization domain. The first 67 amino acids of HDAC1 were expressed bacterially as a GST fusion protein. This region of HDAC1 interacts with HDAC1 or HDAC2 and does not contain a deacetylase domain (Fig. 5A) (28.Taplick J. Kurtev V. Kroboth K. Posch M. Lechner T. Seiser C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). When incubating GST HDAC1-(1–67) with HDAC1, it inhibited the deacetylase activity of HDAC1. In contrast, GST alone did not affect HDAC1 deacetylase activity (Fig. 5H). This result indicates that although GST HDAC1-(1–67) can dimerize with wild type HDAC1, the lack of functional deacetylase domains results in the loss of deacetylase activity from the dimer. This result support our model that active HDAC1/2 dimer requires two functional deacetylase molecules. Given that HDAC1 can regulate HDAC2 enzymatic activity by forming heterodimers, we further tested whether HDAC1 could also regulate HDAC1/2-containing corepressor complex activity. First, we determined whether HDAC1 and -2 formed homo- and heterodimer or oligomer in the corepressor complexes. The nuclear extract of the 3134 cell line, which stably expressed FLAG-tagged HDAC1, was immunoprecipitated with FLAG antibody and eluted with FLAG peptide. The precipitant was subsequently immunoprecipitated with Sin3A antibody. The bound fraction was subjected to Western blot analysis. The results show that endogenous HDAC1 and HDAC2 are present in the HDAC1-Sin3 complex (Fig. 6A). This result indicates that FLAG-HDAC1 can associate with endogenous HDAC1 as homodimer or HDAC2 as heterodimer or oligomer in corepressor complexes. Next, we investigated whether HDAC1 6Q can repress the activity of endogenous HDAC1/2-containing corepressor complexes. HDAC1-containing protein complexes were purified through immunoprecipitation with FLAG antibodies from nuclear extracts of 3134 cells that stably expressed FLAG HDAC1. The purified complexes contain components of the mSin3A complex, the CoREST complex, and the NuRD complex (Fig. 6B, lane 4). The isolated protein complexes were incubated with HDAC1 6Q, and the overall deacetylase activity was determined by incubating the complexes with acetylated histones. HDAC1 6Q inhibited the overall deacetylase activity of the protein complexes (Fig. 6B, lanes 4 and 5). In contrast, wild type nonacetylated HDAC1 increased the overall deacetylase activity (Fig. 6A, lanes 4 and 6). This result indicates that HDAC1 6Q can interact with HDAC1 or HDAC2 in the complex to repress the deacetylase activity of HDAC1 and -2. Therefore, the acetylation of HDAC1 results in the repression of the overall deacetylase activity of HDAC1/2-containing corepressor complexes (Fig. 6C). Here we reported that HDAC1 and HDAC2 are regulated differently because HDAC1 can be acetylated and HDAC2 cannot. This differential regulation of HDAC1 and HDAC2 is due to a sequence difference at the C terminus of the two proteins. A major role for the acetylation of HDAC1 is exerted by lysine 432, which is an arginine at the corresponding position in HDAC2. More importantly, we showed that the acetylation of HDAC1 inhibits the activity of itself and also the activity of HDAC2. Interestingly, deacetylase-defective mutants of HDAC1, such as HDAC1 H141A, can also inhibit HDAC2 activity, suggesting that acetylated HDAC1 inhibits HDAC2 activity due to the loss of the functional deacetylase domain. Thus, our study unveils important fundamental aspects of the structural and functional differences between HDAC1 and HDAC2, documenting that one deacetylase can trans-regulate the activity of another deacetylase. Crystal structures of HDLP and HDAC8 show that both enzymes form homodimers with the catalytic pockets facing each other (29.Finnin M.S. Donigian J.R. Cohen A. Richon V.M. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A.

Mattu M. Carfí A. De Francesco R. Steinkühler C. Di Marco S. EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 879-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of HDAC1 and HDAC2 have not yet been solved; however, the N-terminal dimerization domain L1 loop of HDLP shares strong sequence homology to that of HDAC1 and HDAC2 (29.Finnin M.S. Donigian J.R. Cohen A. Richon V.M. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Breslow R. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1999; 401: 188-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar). We speculate that HDAC1 and HDAC2 can form homo- or heterodimers with the catalytic domains facing each other as is the case for HDLP and HDAC8. When one enzyme is inactive, it results in the inhibition of function for the other enzyme. To test this model, we will need to determine the crystal structures of HDAC1 and HDAC2. A recent report indicated that the catalytic activity of HDAC6 depends on both intact deacetylase domains, which appears to support our model (33.Zhang Y. Gilquin B. Khochbin S. Matthias P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2401-2404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Although HDAC1 and HDCA2 often associate with repressor complexes to inhibit transcription, in this study we showed that both HDAC1 and HDAC2 are activators for GR-mediated transactivation. It is unclear what complex they associate with when they function as coactivators. Current effort is directed at identifying the target of deacetylation for MMTV gene activation. Some HDAC1- or HDAC2-containing complexes have more than one type of histone-modifying enzymes. The CoREST complex contains histone deacetylases and histone demethylase LSD1, and Mi2 complexes contain histone deacetylase and ATPase containing chromatin-remodeling enzymes. It has been reported that deacetylase activity is required for LSD1 demethylase activity on nucleosome substrates, and the histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A, can inhibit demethylase activity (34.Lee M.G. Wynder C. Bochar D.A. Hakimi M.A. Cooch N. Shiekhattar R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6395-6402Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). It will be important to investigate whether HDAC1 acetylation is involved in regulating the demethylase activity of LSD1 as well as the remodeling activity of Mi2 within the complex. HDAC1 can undergo several post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, sumoylation, and acetylation (8.Qiu Y. Zhao Y. Becker M. John S. Parekh B.S. Huang S. Hendarwanto A. Martinez E.D.

All modifications occur at the C-terminal region. It is shown here that most of the mutations that affect the modification of HDAC1 reduce its deacetylase activity. Because all the modification sites are in close proximity, it will be interesting to investigate whether there is a cross-talk among different modifications. There is strong evidence that a cross-talk occurs between different post-translational modifications in histone and non-histone proteins (35.Latham J.A. Dent S.Y. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 1017-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 36.Yang X.J. Seto E. Mol.

The in-depth study of the structures and functions of HDAC1 and HDAC2 may also provide further insight into developing inhibitors that target the unique domains of HDAC1 or HDAC2. We thank Drs.

https://openalex.org/W2086597773,"Satellite tracking of large pelagic fish provides insights on free-ranging behaviour, distributions and population structuring. Up to now, such fish have been tracked remotely using two principal methods: direct positioning of transmitters by Argos polar-orbiting satellites, and satellite relay of tag-derived light-level data for post hoc track reconstruction. Error fields associated with positions determined by these methods range from hundreds of metres to hundreds of kilometres. However, low spatial accuracy of tracks masks important details, such as foraging patterns. Here we use a fast-acquisition global positioning system (Fastloc GPS) tag with remote data retrieval to track long-term movements, in near real time and position accuracy of <70 m, of the world's largest bony fish, the ocean sunfish Mola mola. Search-like movements occurred over at least three distinct spatial scales. At fine scales, sunfish spent longer in highly localised areas with faster, straighter excursions between them. These ‘stopovers’ during long-distance movement appear consistent with finding and exploiting food patches. This demonstrates the feasibility of GPS tagging to provide tracks of unparalleled accuracy for monitoring movements of large pelagic fish, and with nearly four times as many locations obtained by the GPS tag than by a conventional Argos transmitter. The results signal the potential of GPS-tagged pelagic fish that surface regularly to be detectors of resource ‘hotspots’ in the blue ocean and provides a new capability for understanding large pelagic fish behaviour and habitat use that is relevant to ocean management and species conservation."

https://openalex.org/W2080646835,"Background Migration between local populations plays an important role in evolution - influencing local adaptation, speciation, extinction, and the maintenance of genetic variation. Like other evolutionary mechanisms, migration is a stochastic process, involving both random and deterministic elements. Many models of evolution have incorporated migration, but these have all been based on simplifying assumptions, such as low migration rate, weak selection, or large population size. We thus have no truly general and exact mathematical description of evolution that incorporates migration. Methodology/Principal Findings We derive an exact equation for directional evolution, essentially a stochastic Price equation with migration, that encompasses all processes, both deterministic and stochastic, contributing to directional change in an open population. Using this result, we show that increasing the variance in migration rates reduces the impact of migration relative to selection. This means that models that treat migration as a single parameter tend to be biassed - overestimating the relative impact of immigration. We further show that selection and migration interact in complex ways, one result being that a strategy for which fitness is negatively correlated with migration rates (high fitness when migration is low) will tend to increase in frequency, even if it has lower mean fitness than do other strategies. Finally, we derive an equation for the effective migration rate, which allows some of the complex stochastic processes that we identify to be incorporated into models with a single migration parameter. Conclusions/Significance As has previously been shown with selection, the role of migration in evolution is determined by the entire distributions of immigration and emigration rates, not just by the mean values. The interactions of stochastic migration with stochastic selection produce evolutionary processes that are invisible to deterministic evolutionary theory."

Ca2+ transporters play an important role in regulating these biological processes, and the ability to manipulate these transporters is an important component in strategies designed to manipulate plant productivity. Ca2+ can accumulate into various organelles including the vacuole, whereas the cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations are maintained in the nanomolar range (3.McAinsh M.R. Pittman J.K.

This gradient is established across the tonoplast in part by high capacity Ca2+/H+ exchange (5.Schumaker K.S. Sze H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2172-2178Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 6.Sze H.

Plant Ca2+/H+ exchangers were cloned by the ability of N-terminal truncated versions of the proteins, lacking the regulatory domain (7.Pittman J.K. Hirschi K.D.

Hirschi K.D. Plant Biol. 2006; 8: 419-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Interestingly, CAX3, which is most similar to CAX1 (77% identical at the amino acid level), is a weak vacuolar Ca2+ transporter when expressed in yeast cells (11.Shigaki T. Hirschi K. Gene. 2000; 257: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 12.Cheng N.H. Pittman J.K. Shigaki T. Lachmansingh J. LeClere S. Lahner B. Salt D.E. Hirschi K.D.

The yeast suppression assays have been a robust tool to dissect the function and regulation of CAX transporters (10.Shigaki T. Hirschi K.D.

Oligomerization represents a regulatory mechanism for many transporters (13.Amtmann A. Blatt M.R. New Phytol. 2009; 181: 35-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). An interaction between the Arabidopsis Ca2+/H+ exchangers CAX1 and CAX3 has been shown (14.Zhao J. Barkla B.J. Marshall J. Pittman J.K. Hirschi K.D. Planta. 2008; 227: 659-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 15.Zhao J. Shigaki T. Mei H. Guo Y.Q. Cheng N.H. Hirschi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 4605-4615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CAX transporters can form homomeric complexes, as has been shown for Arabidopsis CAX1 and mung bean VCAX1 (9.Ueoka-Nakanishi H. Tsuchiya T. Sasaki M. Nakanishi Y. Cunningham K.W. Maeshima M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3090-3098Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 15.Zhao J. Shigaki T. Mei H. Guo Y.Q. Cheng N.H. Hirschi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 4605-4615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Using both plant and yeast assays, CAX1 and CAX3 combine to form functional transporters with novel transport properties (15.Zhao J. Shigaki T. Mei H. Guo Y.Q. Cheng N.H. Hirschi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 4605-4615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We postulate that like oligomerization of other transporters, CAX1 and CAX3 interactions allow dynamic flexibility for membrane transport, even though the mechanism by which the CAX1-CAX3 complex confers Li+ and Na+ tolerance remains unclear. It is thus important to generate additional information about the nature of the CAX interactions. Many transporter proteins are made up of two or more homologous domains, possibly as a result of ancient duplication events. For example, plant sucrose transporter members of the major facilitator superfamily possess two homologous, interacting domains (16.Reinders A. Schulze W. Thaminy S. Stagljar I. Frommer W.B. Ward J.M. Structure. 2002; 10: 763-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Furthermore, both homo- and heteromeric sucrose half proteins can functionally interact (16.Reinders A. Schulze W. Thaminy S. Stagljar I. Frommer W.B. Ward J.M. Structure. 2002; 10: 763-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 17.Reinders A. Schulze W. Kühn C. Barker L. Schulz A. Ward J.M. Frommer W.B. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1567-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). CAX transporters similarly appear to consist of two weakly homologous modules (18.Shigaki T. Rees I. Nakhleh L. Hirschi K.D. J. Mol. Evol. 2006; 63: 815-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) that are likely to interact. The analysis of these split CAX modules may allow us to further understand the mechanisms of protein-protein interaction between the CAX transporter isoforms. The potential to generate chimeric CAX proteins via the manipulation of split CAX halves will also allow us to perform structure-function analyses and may afford a novel means to regulate CAX transporters. In this study the yeast split ubiquitin system, in planta bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC), and gel shift assays were used to demonstrate that two separately expressed halves of CAX1 can interact. Furthermore, a heteromeric interaction between the first half of sCAX1 and the C-terminal part of CAX3 provides insights into the structure of oligomeric CAXs. The interaction is specific, because unrelated membrane proteins do not interact. Yeast suppression studies together with kinetic measurements show that the halves reconstitute a functional transporter and indicate that they are independently targeted to yeast endomembranes. Collectively, these findings provide insights into the interactions among CAX transporters as well as a strategy to manipulate transport function through genetic engineering. The truncated forms of CAX1 (sCAX1) and CAX3 (sCAX3) were split into N- and C-terminal halves at the 236th and 238th amino acids, respectively. The N-terminal half of sCAX1 (N-sCAX1, amino acids 37–272) was amplified using primers N-sCAX1F and N-sCAX1R (supplemental Table S1). The C-terminal half of CAX1 (C-CAX1, from amino acids 273–463) was amplified using primers C-CAX1F and C-CAX1R. The sCAX1H338N mutant has been previously described (19.Shigaki T. Barkla B.J. Miranda-Vergara M.C. Zhao J. Pantoja O. Hirschi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30136-30142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) (supplemental Table S2) and was used as a template for PCR to create the C-CAX1H338N clones in the same manner as C-CAX1 was constructed (19.Shigaki T. Barkla B.J. Miranda-Vergara M.C. Zhao J. Pantoja O. Hirschi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30136-30142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The N-terminal half of sCAX3 (N-sCAX3, amino acids 37–274) was amplified using primers N-sCAX3F and N-sCAX3R. The C-terminal half of CAX3 (C-CAX3, amino acids 275–459) was amplified using primers C-CAX3F and C-CAX3R. These N-terminal and C-terminal PCR fragments were first cloned into the pGEM T-Easy vector (Promega). After sequence confirmation, the constructs were subcloned into the SfiI A and B restriction sites of two yeast expression vectors pHGpd (His selectable marker) and pUGpd (Ura selectable marker), respectively (20.Nathan D.F. Vos M.H. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 1409-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Thus, N-terminal halves or C-terminal halves of sCAX1 and sCAX3 were expressed in plasmids containing either −His or −Ura selectable markers. The HA and GFP epitope-tagged CAX1 and CAX3 half proteins were constructed using similar approaches. The primers N-sCAX1HAF and N-sCAX1HAR were used to amplify N-sCAX1, which was then cloned into the BamHI and NotI sites of the HA cassette in pUGpd (20.Nathan D.F. Vos M.H. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 1409-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) to generate triple HA epitope-tagged N-sCAX1. The primers C-CAX3GFPF and C-CAX3GFPR were used to amplify C-CAX3, which was then subcloned into the SpeI and NotI sites of a GFP fusion expression cassette in pHGpd (20.Nathan D.F. Vos M.H. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 1409-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) to generate the GFP-tagged C-CAX3. The C-CAX1 fusion with c-Myc at the C terminus (C-CAX1-c-Myc) was constructed by ligating C-CAX1 (amplified using C-CAX1F and C-CAX1R primers) into a cassette containing five tandem copies of the c-Myc epitope (EQKLISEEDL) (21.Shigaki T. Pittman J.K. Hirschi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6610-6617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The primers C-CAX3RFPF and C-CAX3RFPR were used to amplify C-CAX3, which was then subcloned into pUGpd-RFP to generate the C-CAX3-RFP fusion. The Ca2+-sensitive S. cerevisiae strain K667 (MATa cnb1:: LEU1 pmc1::TRP1 vcx1Δ ade2-1 can1-100 his3-11,15 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 ura3-1) was used for most yeast assays (22.Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2226-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The N-terminal ubiquitin half (Nub) and C-terminal ubiquitin half (Cub) vectors, KAT1-Cub and Nub-KAT1 constructs, and yeast strains THY.AP4 (MATa leu2-3,112 ura3-52 trp1-289 lexA::HIS3 lexA::ADE2 lexA::lacZ) and THY.AP5 (MATα URA3 leu2-3,112 trp1-289 his3-Δ1 ade2Δ::loxP) used for the mating-based split ubiquitin system were obtained from Dr. Wolf B. Frommer (Stanford University) (23.Ludewig U. Wilken S. Wu B. Jost W. Obrdlik P. El Bakkoury M. Marini A.M. André B. Hamacher T. Boles E. von Wirén N. Frommer W.B. J. Biol.

The CAX1, CAX3, sCAX1, sCAX1H338N, and sCAX3 expression vectors have been described previously (supplemental Table S2). CAX1, CAX3, and their N-terminal and C-terminal halves were cloned into split ubiquitin plasmids using in vivo recombination cloning (24.Obrdlik P. El-Bakkoury M. Hamacher T. Cappellaro C. Vilarino C. Fleischer C. Ellerbrok H. Kamuzinzi R. Ledent V. Blaudez D. Sanders D. Revuelta J.L. Boles E. André B. Frommer W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 12242-12247Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The full-length CAX1 and CAX3 constructs have been described previously (15.Zhao J. Shigaki T. Mei H. Guo Y.Q. Cheng N.H. Hirschi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 4605-4615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For the construction of Nub X and NubWT fusions, the split ubiquitin vectors Nub X and NubWT were cleaved with EcoRI/SmaI and mixed with the purified PCR products for CAX1, CAX3, N-CAX1, and C-CAX3 to transform THY.AP5 cells and transformants were selected on SC medium lacking Trp and Ura. For Cub fusions, the vector metYCgate was cleaved with PstI/HindIII and mixed with the same PCR products to transform yeast strain THY.AP4, and transformants were selected on SC medium lacking Leu. After the initial interaction assay, plasmids were extracted from the yeast strains and amplified in Escherichia coli. The interactions were then verified by repeating the assays using the purified plasmids. After the interaction was confirmed, the insert plasmids were sequenced. To generate CAX BiFC plasmids, full-length CAX1 and CAX3 proteins, and split half N-sCAX1, C-CAX1, and C-CAX3 proteins were fused to N- or C-terminal halves of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). CAX constructs were amplified using specific primers (supplemental Table S1) and then subcloned into the SacI and BamHI sites of pSY735 or pSY736 (25.Bracha-Drori K. Shichrur K. Katz A. Oliva M. Angelovici R. Yalovsky S. Ohad N. Plant J. 2004; 40: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) for N-terminal fusion with the C-terminal half of YFP (CYFP) or the N-terminal half of YFP (NYFP), respectively. CAX3 constructs were amplified from a CAX3 plasmid, which was engineered to remove the BamHI site at nucleotide position 1103, by site-directed mutagenesis (26.Shigaki T. Hirschi K.D. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 298: 118-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) using primers CAX3BamHIF and CAX3BamHIR. The negative actin control construct (ACT8-NYFP) was generated by subcloning the ACT8F and ACT8R PCR product into the XbaI and KpnI sites of pSPYNE (27.Walter M. Chaban C. Schütze K. Batistic O. Weckermann K. Näke C. Blazevic D. Grefen C. Schumacher K. Oecking C. Harter K. Kudla J. Plant J. 2004; 40: 428-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae strain K667 was transformed with His and Ura selectable expression constructs as described previously (15.Zhao J. Shigaki T. Mei H. Guo Y.Q. Cheng N.H. Hirschi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 4605-4615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Transformed cells were tested for their capability to suppress the K667 Ca2+-sensitive phenotype (8.Hirschi K.D. Zhen R.G. Cunningham K.W. Rea P.A. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 8782-8786Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Growth assays were conducted using YPD medium supplemented with or without CaCl2 (50, 100, 150, or 200 mm), LiCl (30, 50, 60, or 100 mm), or NaCl (400, 500, or 600 mm). Yeast culture conditions and sample processing were slightly modified from a previous study (28.Eide D.J. Clark S. Nair T.M. Gehl M. Gribskov M. Guerinot M.L. Harper J.F. Genome Biol. 2005; 6: R77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For growth in Li+ and Ca2+ supplemented medium, K667 cells expressing the various constructs were inoculated in 5 ml of YPD + 1/100 volume of 100 × mineral supplement stock (28.Eide D.J. Clark S. Nair T.M. Gehl M. Gribskov M. Guerinot M.L. Harper J.F. Genome Biol. 2005; 6: R77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), supplemented with 10 mm CaCl2, 100 mm NaCl, or 500 mm LiCl (final concentrations). The cultures were grown at 30 °C to stationary phase, and 2.5 ml of each culture was collected by vacuum filtration using isopore membrane filters (1.2-μm pore size) (Fisher Scientific). The cells were washed three times with 1 ml of 1 μm EDTA disodium salt solution, pH 8.0, by vacuum filtration followed by three washes with 1 ml of distilled, deionized H2O. The filters were dried in a 70 °C oven for 48 h before inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy analysis was performed as previously described (29.Lahner B. Gong J. Mahmoudian M. Smith E.L. Abid K.B. Rogers E.E. Guerinot M.L. Harper J.F. Ward J.M. McIntyre L. Schroeder J.I. Salt D.E. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 1215-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The data from five repeats were calculated with the following formula: (Ioncax − Ionvector)/Ionvector × 100, and expressed as the means ± S.E. (n = 5). Ca2+/H+ exchange activity into vacuole-enriched membrane vesicles was measured using 45Ca2+, performed exactly as described previously (15.Zhao J. Shigaki T. Mei H. Guo Y.Q. Cheng N.H. Hirschi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 4605-4615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Microsomal fractions from yeast cells expressing CAX variants were prepared using the glass bead method (30.Liang F. Cunningham K.W. Harper J.F. Sze H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 8579-8584Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Briefly, glass bead buffer (25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 10% sucrose, 3 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm benzamidine, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin) was added to the cells with an equal volume of glass beads (Sigma), and the mixture was vortexed three times for 1 min at maximum speed with intervals of 10 min on ice. Triton X-100 was added to the lysate to a final concentration of 0.5%. The lysate was centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was saved. After solubilization in buffers containing 1% Triton X-100 (15.Zhao J. Shigaki T. Mei H. Guo Y.Q. Cheng N.H. Hirschi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 4605-4615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), equal amounts of native protein (about 15 μg) from samples were resolved on native 12% PAGE with SDS-PAGE running buffer followed by transferring membranes and immunoblotting as described above. The proteins were detected with anti-HA, anti-c-Myc, and anti-GFP antibodies (Covance) used at 1:2000. The split ubiquitin system used in this assay was a mating-based split ubiqutin system developed previously (24.Obrdlik P. El-Bakkoury M. Hamacher T. Cappellaro C. Vilarino C. Fleischer C. Ellerbrok H. Kamuzinzi R. Ledent V. Blaudez D. Sanders D. Revuelta J.L. Boles E. André B. Frommer W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 12242-12247Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 31.Pandey S. Assmann S.M. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 1616-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Approximately 40 clones of each THY.AP5 and THY.AP4 transformation with various Nub and Cub constructs were mixed and incubated in appropriate selective SC with and without G418. Cultures of the lag phase were used for mating as described previously (23.Ludewig U. Wilken S. Wu B. Jost W. Obrdlik P. El Bakkoury M. Marini A.M. André B. Hamacher T. Boles E. von Wirén N. Frommer W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45603-45610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). After mating THY.AP4 and THY.AP5 strains on YPD for 8 h of incubation at 28 °C, diploid cells were selected by replica plating on SC without Trp, Leu, and Ura for 2–3 days. Diploid cells were used for analysis on SC medium supplemented with 150 mm Met for 3 days. CAX Nub and Cub constructs were used for retransformation, and the interaction assay was repeated using the confirmed constructs. For the filter assay, diploid cells were grown for 3 days on sterilized filter sets placed on SC medium supplemented with His, Ade, and 150 mm Met. β-Galactosidase activity assays were conducted according to the standard X-gal filter assay protocol described previously (24.Obrdlik P. El-Bakkoury M. Hamacher T. Cappellaro C. Vilarino C. Fleischer C. Ellerbrok H. Kamuzinzi R. Ledent V. Blaudez D. Sanders D. Revuelta J.L. Boles E. André B. Frommer W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 12242-12247Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Color changes in the positive interactions could be detected within 3 h. N-sCAX1-GFP and C-CAX3-RFP were co-transformed into K667 cells and selected on SC−His and −Ura media. N-sCAX1-GFP and C-CAX3-RFP localization was visualized using a confocal microscope (Olympus Fluoview, FV500; Olympus Optical, Tokyo, Japan). An argon laser was used for excitation at 488 nm for GFP imaging with emission at 525 nm or excitation at 543 nm for RFP imaging with emission at 605 nm. Co-fractionation of N-sCAX1-GFP and C-CAX3-RFP on vacuolar membrane-enriched fractions was confirmed with Western blotting. Microsomal fractions from N-sCAX1-GFP and C-CAX3-RFP co-expressing K667 yeast cells were subjected to discontinuous sucrose gradient fractionation, and Western blotting was used to detect the vacuolar membrane and endoplasmic reticulum markers alkaline phosphatase and BiP, respectively, N-sCAX1-GFP and C-CAX3-RFP, on these fractions. N-sCAX1-GFP and C-CAX3-RFP were detected with GFP and RFP antibodies, respectively. BiFC plasmid DNA was biolistically transferred into onion (Allium cepa) slices. DNA (3 μg) for each construct was precipitated onto 1-μm gold microparticles (Bio-Rad) as previously described (32.Hull G. Garrido J.M.G. Parcy F. Menossi M. Martinez-Izquierdo J.A. Gallois P. Plant Sci. 1996; 120: 153-160Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Sections of onion tissue were placed on 1% agar plates and bombarded using a PDS-1000 He system gene gun (Bio-Rad) under a vacuum (0.925 bar) and a helium pressure of 1350 p.s.i. Following bombardment, tissue samples were incubated for 16 h in the dark at 22 °C. The epidermis was then removed for analysis. Imaging was performed on a Leica TCS SP5 AOBS upright confocal microscope. Excitation was with an argon laser at 514 nm and spectral detection between 525 and 580 nm for YFP and 458 nm with spectral detection between 465 and 600 nm for cyan fluorescent protein (CFP). CAXs can be divided into two weakly homologous halves at the short negatively charged loop between transmembranes 6 and 7, previously termed the “acidic motif” (18.Shigaki T. Rees I. Nakhleh L. Hirschi K.D. J. Mol. Evol. 2006; 63: 815-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1). To investigate the interaction between these CAX1 and CAX3 split proteins, we utilized K667 yeast expression assays (19.Shigaki T. Barkla B.J. Miranda-Vergara M.C. Zhao J. Pantoja O. Hirschi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30136-30142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 33.Shigaki T. Cheng N.H. Pittman J.K. Hirschi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43152-43159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Co-expression of N-sCAX1 and C-CAX1 suppressed the Ca2+ sensitivity phenotype (Fig. 1A), thus effectively reconstituting the N-terminal truncated CAX1 (sCAX1). Yeast co-expressing N-sCAX1 and C-CAX3 could similarly grow well on high Ca2+ medium. All other combinations, such as N-sCAX1+N-sCAX3, N-sCAX3+N-sCAX1, C-CAX3+C-CAX1, N-sCAX3+C-CAX3, and N-sCAX3+C-CAX1 were unable to suppress the Ca2+-sensitive phenotype, and expression of the N- or C-halves of the transporters alone were nonfunctional (Fig. 1A and data not shown). These observations suggested that N-sCAX1 could form an active Ca2+ transporter with either C-CAX1 or C-CAX3. To confirm Ca2+ transport activity, the H+-gradient dependent 45Ca2+ uptake assay was utilized (Fig. 1B). Membrane vesicles from yeast expressing N-sCAX1+C-CAX3 showed significantly increased Ca2+/H+ exchange activity compared with vector control (Fig. 1B) and sCAX3-expressing cells (data not shown), but the activity was lower than from cells expressing sCAX1 and slightly lower than from cells expressing N-sCAX1+C-CAX3. This suggests that N-sCAX1 and C-CAX3 half proteins can together form an active Ca2+ transporter. To further examine the transport properties of the CAX half protein complexes, we tested the growth sensitivity of K667 yeast cells expressing these constructs on Li+-, Na+-, and Ca2+-containing media (Fig. 2). sCAX1-expressing yeast are tolerant to Ca2+ in the media but very sensitive to Na+ and Li+, whereas CAX3 cells are slightly tolerant to Na+ and Li+, but sensitive to Ca+ (15.Zhao J.

Yeast K667 cells co-expressing N-sCAX1+C-CAX1 were Ca2+-, Li+-, and Na+-tolerant (Fig. 2A). In contrast, both N-sCAX3+C-CAX3- and N-sCAX1+C-CAX3-expressing yeast were Ca2+-sensitive but tolerant to Na+ (Fig. 2; data not shown). Whole yeast cell metal accumulation was measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy to infer the transport properties of the half protein complexes. In high Ca2+ and high Li+ growth conditions, the N-sCAX1+C-CAX1 and N-sCAX1+C-CAX3 cells significantly accumulated Ca2+, Li+, and Na+ compared with vector control (Fig. 2B). N-sCAX1+C-CAX1 accumulated more Ca2+ than the N-sCAX1+C-CAX3 cells, whereas the N-sCAX1+C-CAX3 cells accumulated more Li+ (Fig. 2B). The Li+ and Na+ transport activity by the N-sCAX1+C-CAX1 complex was further inferred by measuring the direct competition of 45Ca2+ uptake by these ions (data not shown). The N-sCAX1+C-CAX1-expressing cells had a similar ion competition profile to sCAX1-expressing cells, including significant Li+ and Na+ inhibition of 45Ca2+ uptake; however, unlike for sCAX1, 45Ca2+ uptake was not significantly inhibited by Cd2+. To further assess the role of specific CAX domains in substrate specificity, we used a previously characterized CAX1 variant. We have shown that expressing a sCAX1 variant containing a single amino acid mutation H338N, termed sCAX1H338N, decreases yeast Ca2+ uptake but increases Cd2+ uptake (19.Shigaki T. Barkla B.J.

Chem. 2005; 280: 30136-30142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). sCAX1H338N in yeast is also unable to provide Na+ or Li+ tolerance (19.Shigaki T. Barkla B.J.

Here we co-expressed N-sCAX1 with the C terminus of sCAX1H338N (C-H338N) in yeast. The N-sCAX1+C-H338N yeast grew very well on high Na+ and Li+ media but was very sensitive to Ca2+ (Fig. 2A). Significant accumulation of Li+ and poor accumulation of Ca2+ was observed in N-sCAX1+C-H338N cells growing in Li+-containing medium (Fig. 2B and data not shown). To confirm that the CAX half proteins were correctly folded and co-localized, N-sCAX1-GFP and C-CAX3-RFP were expressed in yeast cells. The tagged half proteins remained functional in K667 yeast with respect to providing Ca2+ tolerance (supplemental Fig. S2)."
https://openalex.org/W2093249968,"The chemopreventive effects of resveratrol (RSV) on prostate cancer have been well established; the androgen receptor (AR) plays pivotal roles in prostatic tumorigenesis. However, the exact underlying molecular mechanisms about the effects of RSV on AR have not been fully elucidated. A model system is needed to determine whether and how RSV represses AR transcriptional activity.The AR cDNA was first cloned into the retroviral vector pOZ-N and then integrated into the genome of AR-negative HeLa cells to generate the AR(+) cells. The constitutively expressed AR was characterized by monitoring hormone-stimulated nuclear translocation, DNA binding, and transcriptional activation, with the AR(-) cells serving as controls. AR(+) cells were treated with RSV, and both AR protein levels and AR transcriptional activity were measured simultaneously. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were used to detect the effects of RSV on the recruitment of AR to its cognate element (ARE).AR in the AR (+) stable cell line functions in a manner similar to that of endogenously expressed AR. Using this model system we clearly demonstrated that RSV represses AR transcriptional activity independently of any effects on AR protein levels. However, neither the hormone-mediated nucleus translocation nor the AR/ARE interaction was affected by RSV treatment.We demonstrated unambiguously that RSV regulates AR target gene expression, at least in part, by repressing AR transcriptional activity. Repressive effects of RSV on AR activity result from mechanisms other than the affects of AR nuclear translocation or DNA binding."
https://openalex.org/W2059439560,"Callipyge sheep exhibit extreme postnatal muscle hypertrophy in the loin and hindquarters as a result of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the imprinted DLK1-DIO3 domain on ovine chromosome 18. The callipyge SNP up-regulates the expression of surrounding transcripts when inherited in cis without altering their allele-specific imprinting status. The callipyge phenotype exhibits polar overdominant inheritance since only paternal heterozygous animals have muscle hypertrophy. Two studies were conducted profiling gene expression in lamb muscles to determine the down-stream effects of over-expression of paternal allele-specific DLK1 and RTL1 as well as maternal allele-specific MEG3, RTL1AS and MEG8, using Affymetrix bovine expression arrays. A total of 375 transcripts were differentially expressed in callipyge muscle and 25 transcripts were subsequently validated by quantitative PCR. The muscle-specific expression patterns of most genes were similar to DLK1 and included genes that are transcriptional repressors or affect feedback mechanisms in beta-adrenergic and growth factor signaling pathways. One gene, phosphodiesterase 7A had an expression pattern similar to RTL1 expression indicating a biological activity for RTL1 in muscle. Only transcripts that localize to the DLK1-DIO3 domain were affected by inheritance of a maternal callipyge allele. Callipyge sheep are a unique model to study over expression of both paternal allele-specific genes and maternal allele-specific non-coding RNA with an accessible and nonlethal phenotype. This study has identified a number of genes that are regulated by DLK1 and RTL1 expression and exert control on postnatal skeletal muscle growth. The genes identified in this model are primary candidates for naturally regulating postnatal muscle growth in all meat animal species, and may serve as targets to ameliorate muscle atrophy conditions including myopathic diseases and age-related sarcopenia."
https://openalex.org/W1971235929,"Genes associated with lactation evolved more slowly than other genes in the mammalian genome. Higher conservation of milk and mammary genes suggest that species variation in milk composition is due in part to the environment and that we must look deeper into the genome for regulation of lactation. At the onset of lactation, metabolic changes are coordinated among multiple tissues through the endocrine system to accommodate the increased demand for nutrients and energy while allowing the animal to remain in homeostasis. This process is known as homeorhesis. Homeorhetic adaptation to lactation has been extensively described; however how these adaptations are orchestrated among multiple tissues remains elusive. To develop a clearer picture of how gene expression is coordinated across multiple tissues during the pregnancy to lactation transition, total RNA was isolated from mammary, liver and adipose tissues collected from rat dams (n = 5) on day 20 of pregnancy and day 1 of lactation, and gene expression was measured using Affymetrix GeneChips. Two types of gene expression analysis were performed. Genes that were differentially expressed between days within a tissue were identified with linear regression, and univariate regression was used to identify genes commonly up-regulated and down-regulated across all tissues. Gene set enrichment analysis showed genes commonly up regulated among the three tissues enriched gene ontologies primary metabolic processes, macromolecular complex assembly and negative regulation of apoptosis ontologies. Genes enriched in transcription regulator activity showed the common up regulation of 2 core molecular clock genes, ARNTL and CLOCK. Commonly down regulated genes enriched Rhythmic process and included: NR1D1, DBP, BHLHB2, OPN4, and HTR7, which regulate intracellular circadian rhythms. Changes in mammary, liver and adipose transcriptomes at the onset of lactation illustrate the complexity of homeorhetic adaptations and suggest that these changes are coordinated through molecular clocks."
https://openalex.org/W2087772139,"The calcium bridge between the pentamers of polyoma viruses maintains capsid metastability. It has been shown that viral infection is profoundly inhibited by the substitution of lysine for glutamate in one calcium-binding residue of the SV40 capsid protein, VP1. However, it is unclear how the calcium bridge affects SV40 infectivity. In this in vitro study, we analyzed the influence of host cell components on SV40 capsid stability. We used an SV40 mutant capsid (E330K) in which lysine had been substituted for glutamate 330 in protein VP1. The mutant capsid retained the ability to interact with the SV40 cellular receptor GM1, and the internalized mutant capsid accumulated in caveolin-1-mediated endocytic vesicles and was then translocated to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) region. However, when placed in ER-rich microsome, the mutant capsid retained its spherical structure in contrast to the wild type, which disassembled. Structural analysis of the mutant capsid with cryo-electron microscopy and image reconstruction revealed altered pentamer coordination, possibly as a result of electrostatic interaction, although its overall structure resembled that of the wild type. These results indicate that the calcium ion serves as a trigger at the pentamer interface, which switches on capsid disassembly, and that the failure of the E330K mutant capsid to disassemble is attributable to an inadequate triggering system. Our data also indicate that calcium depletion-induced SV40 capsid disassembly may occur in the ER region and that this is essential for successful SV40 infection."
https://openalex.org/W2028201899,"We consider a recently suggested “equation of state” for natively folded proteins, and verify its validity for a set of about 5800 proteins. The equation is based on a fractal viewpoint of proteins, on a generalization of the Landau-Peierls instability, and on a marginal stability criterion. The latter allows for coexistence of stability and flexibility of proteins, which is required for their proper function. The equation of state relates the protein fractal dimension , its spectral dimension , and the number of amino acids N. Using structural data from the protein data bank (PDB) and the Gaussian network model (GNM), we compute and for the entire set and demonstrate that the equation of state is well obeyed. Addressing the fractal properties and making use of the equation of state may help to engineer biologically inspired catalysts."
https://openalex.org/W2035145667,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the Gram-negative bacterial outer membrane glycolipid, induces sepsis through its interaction with myeloid differentiation protein-2 (MD-2) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). To block interaction between LPS/MD-2 complex and TLR4, we designed and generated soluble fusion proteins capable of binding MD-2, dubbed TLR4 decoy receptor (TOY) using ‘the Hybrid leucine-rich repeats (LRR) technique’. TOY contains the MD-2 binding ectodomain of TLR4, the LRR motif of hagfish variable lymphocyte receptor (VLR), and the Fc domain of IgG1 to make it soluble, productive, and functional. TOY exhibited strong binding to MD-2, but not to the extracellular matrix (ECM), resulting in a favorable pharmacokinetic profile in vivo. TOY significantly extended the lifespan, when administered in either preventive or therapeutic manners, in both the LPS- and cecal ligation/puncture-induced sepsis models in mice. TOY markedly attenuated LPS-triggered NF-κB activation, secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, and thrombus formation in multiple organs. Taken together, the targeting strategy for sequestration of LPS/MD-2 complex using the decoy receptor TOY is effective in treating LPS- and bacteria-induced sepsis; furthermore, the strategy used in TOY development can be applied to the generation of other novel decoy receptor proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1963749523,"The mTOR inhibitor rapamycin has anti-tumor activity across a variety of human cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma. However, resistance to its growth inhibitory effects is common. We hypothesized that hepatic cell lines with varying rapamycin responsiveness would show common characteristics accounting for resistance to the drug.We profiled a total of 13 cell lines for rapamycin-induced growth inhibition. The non-tumorigenic rat liver epithelial cell line WB-F344 was highly sensitive while the tumorigenic WB311 cell line, originally derived from the WB-F344 line, was highly resistant. The other 11 cell lines showed a wide range of sensitivities. Rapamycin induced inhibition of cyclin E-dependent kinase activity in some cell lines, but the ability to do so did not correlate with sensitivity. Inhibition of cyclin E-dependent kinase activity was related to incorporation of p27(Kip1) into cyclin E-containing complexes in some but not all cell lines. Similarly, sensitivity of global protein synthesis to rapamycin did not correlate with its anti-proliferative effect. However, rapamycin potently inhibited phosphorylation of two key substrates, ribosomal protein S6 and 4E-BP1, in all cases, indicating that the locus of rapamycin resistance was downstream from inhibition of mTOR Complex 1. Microarray analysis did not disclose a unifying mechanism for rapamycin resistance, although the glycolytic pathway was downregulated in all four cell lines studied.We conclude that the mechanisms of rapamycin resistance in hepatic cells involve alterations of signaling downstream from mTOR and that the mechanisms are highly heterogeneous, thus predicting that maintaining or promoting sensitivity will be highly challenging."
https://openalex.org/W2008307685,"Protein folding mechanisms have remained elusive mainly because of the transient nature of intermediates. Leech-derived tryptase inhibitor (LDTI) is a Kazal-type serine proteinase inhibitor that is emerging as an attractive model for folding studies. It comprises 46 amino acid residues with three disulfide bonds, with one located inside a small triple-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and with two involved in a cystine-stabilized α-helix, a motif that is widely distributed in bioactive peptides. Here, we analyzed the oxidative folding and reductive unfolding of LDTI by chromatographic and disulfide analyses of acid-trapped intermediates. It folds and unfolds, respectively, via sequential oxidation and reduction of the cysteine residues that give rise to a few 1- and 2-disulfide intermediates. Species containing two native disulfide bonds predominate during LDTI folding (IIa and IIc) and unfolding (IIa and IIb). Stop/go folding experiments demonstrate that only intermediate IIa is productive and oxidizes directly into the native form. The NMR structures of acid-trapped and further isolated IIa, IIb, and IIc reveal global folds similar to that of the native protein, including a native-like canonical inhibitory loop. Enzyme kinetics shows that both IIa and IIc are inhibitory-active, which may substantially reduce proteolysis of LDTI during its folding process. The results reported show that the kinetics of the folding reaction is modulated by the specific structural properties of the intermediates and together provide insights into the interdependence of conformational folding and the assembly of native disulfides during oxidative folding.

In the well established method of oxidative folding, fully reduced and unfolded proteins are allowed to gain both their native disulfides and native structure under selected buffer and redox conditions. The heterogeneity of the intermediates that arise during the process and their disulfide connectivity are then used to characterize the folding pathway (3.Arolas J.L. Aviles F.X. Chang J.Y.

These properties make LDTI an interesting model protein for folding studies. We have recently shown that its oxidative folding is bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor-like, i.e. populated by a few native disulfide-bonded intermediates that efficiently funnel this protein toward its native form (22.Arolas J.L. Bronsoms S. Aviles F.X. Ventura S. Sommerhoff C.P. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2008; 10: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 23.Weissman J.S. Kim P.S. Science. 1991; 253: 1386-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of the pathways of oxidative folding and reductive unfolding of LDTI. Moreover, we have solved the high resolution structures of its major folding and unfolding intermediates to decipher the specific interactions that drive the folding of this molecule. Inhibitory assays on the major folding intermediates complement the work."
https://openalex.org/W2102133986,"Background In many organisms, homologous chromosomes rely upon recombination-mediated linkages, termed crossovers, to promote their accurate segregation at meiosis I. In budding yeast, the evolutionarily conserved mismatch-repair paralogues, Msh4 and Msh5, promote crossover formation in conjunction with several other proteins, collectively termed the Synapsis Initiation Complex (SIC) proteins or ‘ZMM’s (Zip1-Zip2-Zip3-Zip4-Spo16, Msh4-Msh5, Mer3). zmm mutants show decreased levels of crossovers and increased chromosome missegregation, which is thought to cause decreased spore viability. Principal Findings In contrast to other ZMM mutants, msh4 and msh5 mutants show improved spore viability and chromosome segregation in response to elevated temperature (23°C versus 33°C). Crossover frequencies in the population of viable spores in msh4 and msh5 mutants are similar at both temperatures, suggesting that temperature-mediated chromosome segregation does not occur by increasing crossover frequencies. Furthermore, meiotic progression defects at elevated temperature do not select for a subpopulation of cells with improved segregation. Instead, another ZMM protein, Zip1, is important for the temperature-dependent improvement in spore viability. Conclusions Our data demonstrate interactions between genetic (zmm status) and environmental factors in determining chromosome segregation."
https://openalex.org/W2026524442,"The V3 loop of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is critical for coreceptor binding and is the main determinant of which of the cellular coreceptors, CCR5 or CXCR4, the virus uses for cell entry. The aim of this study is to provide a large-scale data driven analysis of HIV-1 coreceptor usage with respect to the V3 loop evolution and to characterize CCR5- and CXCR4-tropic viral phenotypes previously studied in small- and medium-scale settings. We use different sequence similarity measures, phylogenetic and clustering methods in order to analyze the distribution in sequence space of roughly 1000 V3 loop sequences and their tropism phenotypes. This analysis affords a means of characterizing those sequences that are misclassified by several sequence-based coreceptor prediction methods, as well as predicting the coreceptor using the location of the sequence in sequence space and of relating this location to the CD4(+) T-cell count of the patient. We support previous findings that the usage of CCR5 is correlated with relatively high sequence conservation whereas CXCR4-tropic viruses spread over larger regions in sequence space. The incorrectly predicted sequences are mostly located in regions in which their phenotype represents the minority or in close vicinity of regions dominated by the opposite phenotype. Nevertheless, the location of the sequence in sequence space can be used to improve the accuracy of the prediction of the coreceptor usage. Sequences from patients with high CD4(+) T-cell counts are relatively highly conserved as compared to those of immunosuppressed patients. Our study thus supports hypotheses of an association of immune system depletion with an increase in V3 loop sequence variability and with the escape of the viral sequence to distant parts of the sequence space."
https://openalex.org/W1979424853,"Human laeverin/aminopeptidase Q (LVRN/APQ) is a novel member of the M1 family of zinc aminopeptidases and is specifically expressed on the cell surface of human extravillous trophoblasts. Multiple sequence alignment of human M1 aminopeptidase revealed that the first Gly residue within the conserved exopeptidase motif of the M1 family, GXMEN motif, is uniquely substituted for His in human LVRN/APQ. In this study, we evaluated the roles of nonconserved His(379), comprising the exopeptidase motif in the enzymatic properties of human LVRN/APQ. We revealed that the substitution of His(379) with Gly caused significant changes in substrate specificity both toward fluorogenic substrates and natural peptide hormones. In addition, the susceptibilities of bestatin, a sensitive inhibitor for human LVRN/APQ, and natural inhibitory peptides were decreased in the H379G mutant. A molecular model suggested a conformational difference between wild-type and H379G human LVRN/APQs. These results indicate that His(379) of the enzyme plays essential roles in its distinctive enzymatic properties and contributes to maintaining the appropriate structure of the catalytic cavity of the enzyme. Our data may bring new insight into the biological significance of the unique exopeptidase motif of LVRN/APQ obtained during the evolution of primates."
https://openalex.org/W2036632137,"Background Translation is most often terminated when a ribosome encounters the first in-frame stop codon (UAA, UAG or UGA) in an mRNA. However, many viruses (and some cellular mRNAs) contain “stop” codons that cause a proportion of ribosomes to terminate and others to incorporate an amino acid and continue to synthesize a “readthrough”, or C-terminally extended, protein. This dynamic redefinition of codon meaning is dependent on specific sequence context. Methodology We describe two versatile dual reporter systems which facilitate investigation of stop codon readthrough in vivo in intact plants, and identification of the amino acid incorporated at the decoded stop codon. The first is based on the reporter enzymes NAN and GUS for which sensitive fluorogenic and histochemical substrates are available; the second on GST and GFP. Conclusions We show that the NAN-GUS system can be used for direct in planta measurements of readthrough efficiency following transient expression of reporter constructs in leaves, and moreover, that the system is sufficiently sensitive to permit measurement of readthrough in stably transformed plants. We further show that the GST-GFP system can be used to affinity purify readthrough products for mass spectrometric analysis and provide the first definitive evidence that tyrosine alone is specified in vivo by a ‘leaky’ UAG codon, and tyrosine and tryptophan, respectively, at decoded UAA, and UGA codons in the Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) readthrough context."
https://openalex.org/W2061333444,"Cancers often overexpress EGF and other growth factors to promote cell replication and migration. Previous work has not produced targeted drug carriers sensitive to abnormal amounts of growth factors. This work demonstrates that liposomes bearing EGF receptors covalently crosslinked to p-toluic acid or methyl-PEO4-NHS ester (or, in short, MRBLs) exhibit an increased rate of release of encapsulated drug compounds when EGF is present in solution. Furthermore, the modified EGF receptors retain the abilities to form dimers in the presence of EGF and bind specifically to EGF. These results demonstrate that MRBLs are sensitive to EGF in solution and indicate that MRBL-reconstituted modified EGF receptors, in the presence of EGF in solution, form dimers which increase MRBL permeability to encapsulated compounds."
