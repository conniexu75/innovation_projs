https://openalex.org/W2024477553,The atomically smooth SrTiO(3) (100) with steps one unit cell in height was obtained by treating the crystal surface with a pH-controlled NH(4)F-HF solution. The homoepitaxy of SrTiO(3) film on the crystal surface proceeds in a perfect layer-by-layer mode as verified by reflection high-energy electron diffraction and atomic force microscopy. Ion scattering spectroscopy revealed that the TiO(2) atomic plane terminated the as-treated clean surface and that the terminating atomic layer could be tuned to the SrO atomic plane by homooepitaxial growth. This technology provides a well-defined substrate surface for atomically regulated epitaxial growth of such perovskite oxide films as YBa(2)Cu(3)O(7-delta).

Plant growth rates were regulated by cycles in animal density and responded to annual changes in primary productivity only when released from herbivory by wolf predation. Isle Royale's dendrochronology complements a rich literature on food chain control in aquatic systems, which often supports a trophic cascade model. This study provides evidence of top-down control in a forested ecosystem."
https://openalex.org/W2011815469,"In situ atomic force microscope observations were made of the adsorption of anions (1- or 2-) of the organic diacid 5-benzoyl-4-hydroxy-2-methoxybenzenesulfonic acid from aqueous solution onto the (0001) surface of hydrotalcite (HT), a layered clay. This adsorption process is believed to mimic the ion-exchange reactions that occur within the layers of HT and other layered clays. Atomic force microscope images of the (0001) surfaces of HT, acquired in aqueous solutions, reveal an ordered structure with respect to magnesium and aluminum atoms. In the presence of the anions, atomic force microscopy indicates pH-dependent adsorption onto the formally cationic HT surface. The anion coverage is governed by electroneutrality and steric interactions between the bulky anions within the adsorbed layer, whereas the orientation of the anions with respect to the HT surface is dictated by coulombic interactions and hydrogen bonding between the anion's sulfonate moiety and clay hydroxyl triads. These observations reveal that the reversible adsorption of molecular species can be examined directly by in situ atomic force microscopy, providing details of surface stoichiometry and adlayer symmetry on the local, molecular level."

Analysis of the low-frequency spectra of 107 shallow-focus earthquakes revealed 20 events that had slow precursors (95 percent confidence level); 19 were slow earthquakes associated with the ocean ridge-transform system, and 1 was a slow earthquake on an intracontinental transform fault in the East African Rift system. These anomalous earthquakes appear to be compound events, each comprising one or more ordinary (fast) ruptures in the shallow seismogenic zone initiated by a precursory slow event in the adjacent or subjacent lithosphere."

Recent studies indicate that SI is achieved by diverse molecular mechanisms in different plant species. In the mustard family, the mechanism of SI shows parallels to the signaling systems found in animals that are mediated by cell-surface receptors with signal-transducing protein kinase activity."

https://openalex.org/W2020168706,Three records of oxygen isotopes in biogenic silica from deep-sea sediment cores from the Atlantic and Indian sectors of the Southern Ocean reveal the presence of isotopically depleted diatomaceous opal in sediment from the last glacial maximum. This depletion is attributed to the presence of lids of meltwater that mixed with surface water along certain trajectories in the Southern Ocean. An increase in the drainage from Antarctica or extensive northward transport of icebergs are among the main mechanisms that could have produced the increase in meltwater input to the glacial Southern Ocean. Similar isotopic trends were observed in older climatic cycles at the same cores.

https://openalex.org/W2054606835,"Ferromagnesian olivine, one of the most common minerals in the solar system, has been widely regarded as a continuous solid solution, although several thermodynamic analyses have suggested the possibility of a miscibility gap at low temperatures. Natural ferromagnesian olivine from the Divnoe meteorite contains compositionally different exsolution lamellae, providing direct evidence for the existence of a miscibility gap in iron-magnesium olivine solid solutions."

https://openalex.org/W2019717907,"Physicists and engineers at Princeton University`s Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor (TFTR) have pushed the machine beyond its design specifications to set a new record for fusion energy output. Even better, the fusion machine is running more smoothly than ever. A hot magnetically confined plasma in TFTR produced 10.7 megawatts of fusion power in this experiment. Further description is given in this paper."
