https://openalex.org/W1977873240,"Studies in adrenocortical cells have implicated the orphan nuclear receptor SF-1 in the gene regulation of the steroid hydroxylases. We used targeted disruption of the Ftz-F1 gene, which encodes SF-1, to examine its role in intact mice. Despite normal survival in utero, all Ftz-F1 null animals died by postnatal day 8; these animals lacked adrenal glands and gonads and were severely deficient in corticosterone, supporting adrenocortical insufficiency as the probable cause of death. Male and female Ftz-F1 null mice had female internal genitalia, despite complete gonadal agenesis. These studies establish that the Ftz-F1 gene is essential for sexual differentiation and formation of the primary steroidogenic tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2149920358,"A mediator was isolated from yeast that enabled a response to the activator proteins GAL4-VP16 and GCN4 in a transcription system reconstituted with essentially homogeneous basal factors and RNA polymerase II. The mediator comprised some 20 polypeptides, including the three subunits of TFIIF and other polypeptides cross-reactive with antisera against GAL11, SUG1, SRB2, SRB4, SRB5, and SRB6 proteins. Mediator not only enabled activated transcription but also conferred 8-fold greater activity in basal transcription and 12-fold greater efficiency of phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II by the TFIIH-associated C-terminal repeat domain (CTD) kinase, indicative of mediator-CTD interaction. A holoenzyme form of RNA polymerase II was independently isolated that supported a response to activator proteins with purified basal factors. The holoenzyme proved to consist of mediator associated with core 12-subunit RNA polymerase II."

https://openalex.org/W1989046023,"We describe six Arabidopsis mutants, defining at least four loci, that spontaneously form necrotic lesions on leaves. Lesions resemble those resulting from disease, but occur in the absence of pathogen. In five mutants, lesion formation correlates with expression of histochemical and molecular markers of plant disease resistance responses and with expression of genes activated during development of broad disease resistance in plants (systemic acquired resistance [SAR]). We designate this novel mutant class Isd (for lesions simulating disease resistance response). Strikingly, four Isd mutants express substantial resistance to virulent fungal pathogen isolates. Isd mutants vary in cell type preferences for lesion onset and spread. Lesion formation can be conditional and can be induced specifically by biotic and chemical activators of SAR in Isd1 mutants."
https://openalex.org/W1985014052,"In plants, the hypersensitive response (HR) to pathogens involves rapid cell death, which is hypothesized to arise from the activation of a cell death program. We describe mutant A. thaliana plants that contain lesions in a single accelerated cell death (ACD) gene called ACD2 and that bypass the need for pathogen exposure to induce the HR. acd2 plants that develop spontaneous lesions show typical HR characteristics both within the necrotic tissue and within the healthy part of the plant, including: modification of plant cell walls, resistance to bacterial pathogens, and accumulation of defense-related gene transcripts, the signal molecule salicylic acid and an antimicrobial compound. We propose that the ACD2 gene is involved in a pathway(s) that negatively regulates a genetically programmed HR."
https://openalex.org/W2171553929,"Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection of human fibroblasts rapidly renders the cells resistant to lysis by HSV-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), which normally recognize cell surface major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I proteins presenting viral peptides. Within 3 hr of infection with HSV, MHC class I protein complexes are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/cis Golgi and show properties of complexes lacking antigenic peptide. The HSV immediate-early protein ICP47 is both necessary and sufficient to block transport of class I proteins and to inhibit lysis by CD8+ CTLs. The target for ICP47 is not known, but since ICP47 does not associate with membranes, it appears that ICP47 inhibits the production or stabilization of antigenic peptides or their translocation into the ER/cis Golgi. Thus, by expressing ICP47, HSV can evade detection by CD8+ T lymphocytes, perhaps explaining the predominance of CD4+ rather than CD8+ HSV-specific CTLs in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2045194954,"Autophosphorylation of multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase makes it Ca2+ independent by trapping bound calmodulin and by enabling the kinase to remain partially active even after calmodulin dissociates. We show that autophosphorylation is an intersubunit reaction between neighbors in the multimeric kinase which requires two molecules of calmodulin. Ca2+/calmodulin acts not only to activate the ""kinase"" subunit but also to present effectively the ""substrate"" subunit for autophosphorylation. Conversion of the kinase to the potentiated or trapped state is a cooperative process that is inefficient at low occupancy of calmodulin. Simulations show that repetitive Ca2+ pulses at limiting calmodulin lead to the recruitment of calmodulin to the holoenzyme, which further stimulates autophosphorylation and trapping. This cooperative, positive feedback loop will potentiate the response of the kinase to sequential Ca2+ transients and establish a threshold frequency at which the enzyme becomes highly active."
https://openalex.org/W2001642664,The S. cerevisiae VPS10 (vacuolar protein sorting) gene encodes a type I transmembrane protein of 1577 amino acids required for the sorting of the soluble vacuolar protein carboxypeptidase Y (CPY). Mutations in VPS10 result in the selective missorting and secretion of CPY; all other vacuolar proteins tested are delivered to the vacuole in vps10 mutants. Chemical cross-linking studies demonstrate that Vps10p and the Golgi-modified precursor form of CPY directly interact. A single amino acid change in the CPY vacuolar sorting signal prevents this interaction. Vps10p also interacts with a hybrid protein containing the CPY sorting signal fused to the normally secreted enzyme invertase. Subcellular fractionation indicates that the majority of Vps10p is localized to a late Golgi compartment where vacuolar proteins are sorted. We propose that VPS10 encodes a CPY sorting receptor that executes multiple rounds of sorting by cycling between the late Golgi and a prevacuolar endosome-like compartment.
https://openalex.org/W2062661644,"The human red and green color vision pigments are identical at all but 15 of their 364 amino acids, and yet their absorption maxima differ by 31 nm. In an extensive mutagenesis study, including a set of 28 chimeric proteins modeled after pigments in the color-deficient human population and an additional 30 single and multiple point mutants, the spectral difference between these 2 pigments is shown to be determined by 7 and only 7 amino acid residues. In going from the red pigment to the green pigment, the 7 residues are Ser116-->Tyr, Ser180-->Ala, Ile230-->Thr, Ala233-->Ser, Tyr277-->Phe, Thr285-->Ala, and Tyr309-->Phe."
https://openalex.org/W2070025492,"Adenosine is a potent modulator of neuronal activity throughout the nervous system. Previous evidence suggests that adenosine presynaptically inhibits synaptic transmission. The mechanism of presynaptic inhibition is uncertain. Adenosine may inhibit transmitter release by reducing voltage-dependent Ca2+ currents, activating K+ currents, or by mechanisms downstream to Ca2+ influx. By simultaneously recording the presynaptic Ca2+ transient ([Ca]t) and the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) at CA3–CA1 synapses of hippocampal slices, we found that adenosine, through activation of presynaptic A1 receptors, inhibits the fEPSP primarily by reducing the [Ca]t. Reduced [Ca]t was due to inhibition of ω-conotoxin GVIA-sensitive and some unidentified Ca2+ channels, probably including Q-type, but not to ω-agatoxin-IVA-sensitive Ca2+ channels. The adenosine A1 antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3illipropylxanthine enhanced both the [Ca]t and the fEPSP, suggesting a tonic inhibition of the [Ca]t by endogenous adenosine in the hippocampal slice."
https://openalex.org/W1532966350,"Merosin is the predominant laminin isoform in the basal lamina of striated muscle and peripheral nerve, and consists of M, B1 or S, and B2 chains. Here we have demonstrated that merosin is a native ligand for alpha-dystroglycan, an extracellular component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex. We have also mapped the mouse M chain gene, Lamm, to the same region of mouse chromosome 10 to which the dystrophia muscularis (dy) locus has been mapped. The dy mutation represents a severe neuromuscular disease resembling human muscular dystrophy. Analysis of merosin expression of dystrophic dy mice revealed a specific deficiency of merosin in skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and peripheral nerve. Our results indicate that merosin deficiency may be the primary defect in dy mice and suggest that a disruption of the link between alpha-dystroglycan and merosin may be involved in the pathogenesis of muscle degeneration and peripheral neuropathy in dy mice."
https://openalex.org/W2018468886,"DNA substrates in which a supercoiled DNA is singly linked to a nicked or relaxed DNA ring were used to analyze the transport of one DNA ring through another by yeast DNA topolsomerase II. The enzyme binds preferentially to the supercoiled DNA and promotes decatenation efficiently upon binding of a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog. Analysis of the reaction products shows that the nicked or relaxed DNA ring released is not associated with the enzyme-supercolled DNA complex. These results favor a two-gate model in which the DNA ring being transported can exit from the interior of the enzyme through a gate on the opposite side of the entrance gate, which is irreversibly closed upon binding of the nonhydrolizable ATP analog."

https://openalex.org/W1617916547,"The human thyrotropin receptor leads upon activation to the stimulation of phospholipase C and adenylyl cyclase. It is presently not known whether this bifurcating signaling occurs via two different G-proteins (Gq/11 and Gs) or via one G-protein (Gs). Receptor-activated Gs releases beta gamma subunits and alpha s, which then could regulate phospholipase C and adenylyl cyclase, respectively. In order to elucidate the signaling pathways induced by the activated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor, we studied the coupling of the TSH receptor to Gs and Gq/11 in human thyroid membranes. TSH concentration dependently led to the activation of two forms of Gs (Gs short and Gs long) as well as of Gq and G11, demonstrating that signaling pathways induced by TSH already bifurcate in the course of the receptor-G-protein interaction. These data strongly suggest the concept that phospholipase C and adenylyl cyclase activation through the TSH receptor are mediated by Gq/11 and Gs, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1541018744,"Long term regulation of the amiloride-sensitive Na+ channel activity by steroid hormones occurs via de novo protein synthesis. The messenger level of RCNaCh1, previously shown by expression cloning to be a component of this channel, was measured in colons from rats fed with a low sodium diet. After 1 week of this diet, the channel activity was increased in an all-or-none fashion, whereas the level of RCNaCh1 messenger remained constant. A cDNA coding for another subunit of the Na+ channel was obtained by polymerase chain reaction. The 650-amino acid protein, entitled RCNaCh2, is 58% homologous to RCNaCh1 and displays a similar structure. It had no intrinsic activity when expressed alone in Xenopus oocytes, but its co-expression with RCNaCh1 increased the channel activity 18 +/- 5-fold. The increase in messenger level for RCNaCh2 during the time course of the diet is likely to explain the positive regulation of the rat colon Na+ channel by steroids. Immunocytochemical localization of the RCNaCh1 subunit revealed an apical labeling in colon from sodium-depleted rats. No labeling was observed in colon from control animals. These results suggest that oligomerization is needed for the proper expression of RCNaCh1 at the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W2104304688,"Neutrophils possess a multicomponent NADPH oxidase system capable of producing large quantities of superoxide in a process known as the respiratory burst (1). Upon stimulation of a phagocytic cell, two cytosolic components of the oxidase, p67(phox) and p47(phax), associate with a membrane-bound flavocytochrome b and a small GTP-binding protein to form a functional enzyme complex. Each of the Phox proteins contains two src homology 3 (SH3) domains, which are of unknown function but are potential mediators of protein-protein interactions between components of the activated oxidase. We have isolated a 47-kDa protein from lysates of differentiated HL60 cells that specifically bound to the carboxyl-terminal SH3 domain of p67(phox) and not to any other SH3 domain tested. This protein was identified as p47(phox), and the putative SH3 domain binding site was located to a carboxyl terminal proline-rich region. Proline-rich synthetic peptides based on this carboxyl-terminal region specifically inhibited the binding of p47(phox) to the carboxyl-terminal SH3 domain of p67(phox), and sequential truncation defined a unique minimal sequence, which, although similar, does not match the consensus sequence defined for other SH3-binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2019872702,"Inactivation of sodium channels terminates the sodium current responsible for initiation of action potentials in excitable cells. A hydrophobic sequence (isoleucine-phenylalanine-methionine, IFM), located in the inactivation gate segment connecting homologous domains III and IV of the sodium channel alpha subunit, is required for fast inactivation. A synthetic peptide containing the IFM sequence (acetyl-KIFMK-amide) restores fast inactivation to mutant sodium channels having a defective inactivation gate and to wild-type sodium channels having inactivation slowed by alpha-scorpion toxin. This peptide also competes with the intrinsic inactivation particle and binds to and blocks open sodium channels in a voltage- and frequency-dependent manner. A peptide (acetyl-KIQMK-amide) containing a mutation that prevents fast inactivation is not effective in restoring inactivation or in blocking open sodium channels. The results support the hypothesis that the sequence IFM serves as the inactivation particle of the sodium channel and suggest that it enters the intracellular mouth of the pore and occludes it during the process of inactivation."
https://openalex.org/W2093923609,"Although Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) via ryanodine receptors has been found to occur in intact neurons, little is known about the physiological processes that regulate it. We studied the effects of cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) on CICR in cultured bullfrog sympathetic neurons by fura-2 fluorescence recording and patch-clamp techniques. cADPR applied through a patch pipette augmented action potential- or depolarizing pulse-induced rises in intracellular Ca2+ without a change in Ca2+ entry initiating the responses, but not in the presence of ryanodine. Likewise, cADPR enhanced a single or oscillatory rise(s) in intracellular Ca2+ induced by caffeine. These results strongly suggest that cADPR can be an endogenous modulator of ryanodine receptors in neurons."

https://openalex.org/W2002687823,"During cerebellar development, granule neurons and their progenitors undergo complex migrations. To define these migratory paths better, we used replication-incompetent retroviruses to label dividing cells early in cerebellar development. Clonally related granule cells were widely dispersed in both rostrocaudal and mediolateral planes; clones often spanned the midline. The data suggest that granule cell progenitors originate from the ventricular zone along the entire mediolateral extent of the caudal edge of the cerebellum. After reaching the cerebellar surface, progenitors move primarily rostrally and proliferate in the superficial external granule layer. Postmitotic granule cells then migrate long distances medially and laterally in the transverse plane in the deep external granule layer, where previously they had been thought simply to extend transverse processes."
https://openalex.org/W1522062003,"In rat pituitary GH4C1 cells, activation of transfected dopamine D2 receptors (long, D2L, or short, D2S, form) and endogenously expressed somatostatin and muscarinic M4 receptors induced inhibition of cAMP synthesis and of Bay K 8644-induced calcium entry via pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins. To analyze the role of alpha 0 and alpha i2 in relaying of these signals, alpha 0 or alpha i2 antisense constructs were separately and stably transfected into GH4C1 cells. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses indicated specific ablation of alpha 0 or alpha i2 in the antisense transfectant clones. Elimination of alpha 0 selectively abolished receptor-mediated inhibition of calcium entry. Notably, the action of dopamine D2L receptor was partially (about 30%) retained. By contrast, depletion of alpha i2 selectively impaired receptor-mediated inhibition of cAMP accumulation. Inhibition of basal cAMP synthesis by any of the four receptors studied was blocked in alpha i2-depleted clones. Additionally, dopamine D2L, somatostatin and muscarinic M4 receptor-mediated inhibition of vasoactive intestinal peptide-stimulated cAMP formation was also abolished. Remarkably, somatostatin even potentiated (by 30%) the action of vasoactive intestinal peptide in alpha i2-antisense clones. In contrast, the action of dopamine D2S receptor on stimulated cAMP synthesis remained largely unaltered. The results demonstrate that alpha 0 specifically triggers receptor-induced closure of calcium channels, whereas alpha i2 specifically mediates inhibition of adenylyl cyclase in GH4C1 cells. Furthermore, the data suggest that G1 protein specificity in receptor coupling to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase depends critically on the activity state of the enzyme. Moreover, the results indicate an essential difference in coupling of dopamine D2L and D2S receptors to G proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1578418351,"We compared the cell cycle regulation of thymidine kinase (TK) after centrifugal elutriation in normal human and mouse cells (primary cells, diploid fibroblasts) with its expression in cells transformed with different DNA tumor viruses. Normal cells showed a rise of TK enzyme activity near the G1/S boundary, which peaked in S phase, and in G2 returned approximately to the level of G1. Conversely, in cells derived from viral transformation, TK activity remained high throughout S and G2 phases, although it was induced to a comparable extent at the onset of DNA replication. In addition, transformed cells exhibited much more enzyme activity during all phases of the cell cycle. The observed differences in expression were due neither to different rates of protein turnover nor to differences in enzyme stability. Enzyme activity was always totally paralleled by the protein level. In all normal cells, the pattern of TK mRNA variation during the cell cycle was similar to that of enzyme activity. In all transformed lines, however, mRNA levels were higher and did not fluctuate throughout the cell cycle. Recently we showed (Ogris et al., 1993) that the E2F binding site present in the TK promoter is a target for trans activation of the TK gene by polyoma virus large T antigen. Using cells expressing this antigen under the control of a hormone-inducible promoter, we were able to switch TK cell cycle expression from the normal to the transformed status. Obviously, DNA tumor viruses suppress transcriptional down-regulation of the endogenous DNA precursor pathway enzyme TK during the eukaryotic cell cycle, maybe to improve conditions for their own replication."
https://openalex.org/W1483497557,"Autophosphorylation of CaM kinase II on Thr286 is known to occur by an intraholoenzyme mechanism, but it is not known whether this reaction is intra- or intersubunit-catalyzed in the native heteromeric enzyme containing 10-12 alpha/beta subunits. In this study inactive CaM kinase II beta subunit, generated by mutation of Lys43 to Ala, and active kinase alpha subunit were expressed separately (homomeric kinases) or co-expressed (heteromeric kinase) using the baculovirus/Sf9 cell expression system and purified on CaM-Sepharose. Ca2+/CaM-dependent autophosphorylation of heteromeric alpha/beta kinase, which activated the enzyme, produced rapid autophosphorylation on Thr286 in both the active alpha and inactive beta subunits; the latter could only occur by intersubunit catalysis. Ca2+/CaM-independent autophosphorylation of nonactivated heteromeric kinase was slow, resulted in partial loss of total kinase activity, occurred only in the alpha subunit, and existed on Thr306 but not Thr286. This result demonstrates intrasubunit catalysis of Thr306 autophosphorylation. These observations that regulatory autophosphorylations of Thr286 and Thr306 were inter- and intrasubunit-catalyzed, respectively, have important consequences for structure/function models of CaM kinase II and for involvement of CaM kinase II autophosphorylation and activation during synaptic plasticity in neural systems."
https://openalex.org/W1550187980,"The structural factors governing azide and cyanide binding have been examined by measuring the effects of 46 mutations at key topological positions in the distal pocket in sperm whale, pig, and human myoglobin. Replacement of His64 (E7) with smaller amino acids results in dramatic increases in the association rate constant for azide binding primarily due to relief of steric hindrance imposed by the imidazole side chain. Gln64 and His64 (native) metmyoglobins have abnormally low rate constants for azide dissociation (0.1-0.3 s-1) due to direct hydrogen bonding between the N epsilon atoms of these residues and the bound ligand. Mutations at positions 67(E10) and 68(E11) produce large but complex changes in the azide binding parameters as a result of both steric and electrostatic effects, which alter water coordination, influence the rate of anion movement into the distal pocket, and affect the stability of the Fe-N3 bond. Replacement of Phe46 with Leu or Val and substitution of Arg(Lys)45 with Glu and Ser cause disorder in the position of the distal histidine side chain and result in 4-700-fold increases in both k'N3 and kN3 but produce little change in overall azide affinity. All of these results suggest strongly that azide enters the distal pocket of native myoglobin through a polar channel that is regulated by a His64 gate. In contrast to azide binding, the rate constant for cyanide association decreases 4-300-fold when the distal histidine is replaced with apolar residues. His64, Gln64, and distal pocket water molecules appear to facilitate deprotonation of HCN, which is the major kinetic barrier to cyanide binding at neutral pH."
https://openalex.org/W2275307165,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is one of the most potent physiological inducers of the nuclear transcription factor kappa B (NF-kappa B). A key event in the activation of NF-kappa B is the rapid release of the inhibitory subunit I kappa B-alpha. Various inhibitors of serine-like proteases are shown to block TNF-mediated NF-kappa B activation as well as the disappearance of I kappa B-alpha immunoreactivity in primary murine T lymphocytes and in various human leukemic cell lines. The protease inhibitors did not block TNF-induced activation of either phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C or acidic sphingomyelinase (SMase), indicating that the putative protease operates rather downstream of TNF signal transduction processes. I kappa B-alpha degradation could be directly induced by addition of sphingomyelinase or synthetic ceramide to a cell-free system, indicating a stringent coupling of SMase to the NF-kappa B activation pathway. SMase-induced I kappa B-alpha degradation was suppressed by the protease inhibitor dichloroisocoumarin. Together, the data suggest that a TNF-responsive sphingomyelinase triggers the rapid degradation of I kappa B-alpha through a serine-like protease, which appears to be crucial to the control of NF-kappa B activation."

https://openalex.org/W1554167856,"Human platelets contain platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) in their alpha-granules which is released during platelet exocytosis. We show by immunoprecipitation and 125I-PDGF binding experiments that human platelets have functionally active PDGF alpha-receptors, but not beta-receptors. The PDGF alpha-receptor (PDGFR-alpha) was identified as a 170-kDa glycosylated protein-tyrosine kinase as found in other cell types. Stimulation of platelets with 0.1 unit/ml thrombin resulted in a significant increase (2-5-fold) of the tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGFR-alpha, as determined by immunoprecipitation with phosphotyrosine antiserum as well as with PDGFR-alpha antiserum. The observed thrombin-induced autophosphorylation of the PDGFR-alpha was inhibited by the addition of a neutralizing monoclonal PDGF antibody. Thus, our results suggest that the platelet PDGFR-alpha is stimulated in an autocrine manner by PDGF secreted during platelet activation. Preincubation of platelets with PDGF inhibited thrombin-induced platelet aggregation and secretion of ATP + ADP and beta-hexosaminidase. Thrombin-induced platelet aggregation was also reversed when PDGF was added 30 s after thrombin stimulation. Inhibition of the autocrine PDGF pathway during platelet activation by the PDGF antibody led to a potentiation of thrombin-induced beta-hexosaminidase secretion. Thus, the PDGFR-alpha takes part in a negative feedback regulation during platelet activation. Our demonstration of PDGF alpha-receptors on human platelets and its inhibitory function during platelet activation identifies a new possible role of PDGF in the regulation of thrombosis."
https://openalex.org/W1497323038,"The pathogenesis of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated cognitive/motor complex, or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) dementia complex, is unknown, but it afflicts over 50% of all patients infected with HIV-1. Because neurons are not directly infected with HIV-1, the causes of neuronal dysfunction are undoubtedly indirect. We investigated the role of the astrocyte in the development of AIDS dementia complex, focusing on cytokine and HIV-1 gp120 stimulation of Na+/H+ exchange (NHE) activity of primary rat astrocytes. Our results show that the cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon (IFN)-gamma, and interleukin (IL)-1 beta (all found to be elevated in the central nervous system of AIDS patients), can stimulate Na+/H+ exchange, but that transforming growth factor-beta, IL-2, and IL-6 do not. IFN-gamma and gp120-induced activation of Na+/H+ exchange appears to be mediated through activation of tyrosine kinase (TK), because TK inhibitors block the action of IFN-gamma and gp120. Additionally, gp120 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of two proteins (approximately 90 and 130 kDa), which is also inhibited by TK inhibitors. The predominant NHE isoform present in rat astrocytes is NHE-1; however, other isoforms are also present. We conclude that Na+/H+ exchange of rat astrocytes can be differentially stimulated by cytokines and HIV-1 gp120. We hypothesize that the resultant increase in intracellular pH with its concomitant changes in astrocyte membrane permeability properties produces an imbalance in the K+ and glutamate microenvironment of the neurons, leading to a rise in intraneuronal Ca2+ and eventual neuronal dysfunction and/or demise."
https://openalex.org/W2102386138,"Coactivation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) and β-adrenergic receptors causes a synergistic increase in cAMP formation in the rat hippocampus. Increases in CAMP are known to have many actions in the hippocampus via activation of CAMP-dependent protein kinase. We now report that coactivation of mGIuRs and β-adrenergic receptors induces an acute depression of EPSCs at the Schaffer collateral-CAl synapse. Interestingly, this depression of EPSCs is dependent upon increases in CAMP levels but independent of protein kinase activity. A series of studies suggests that CAMP-mediated depression of EPSCs is dependent on metabolism of cAMP and release of adenosine or 5′-AMP into the extracellular space with resultant activation of presynaptic adenosine receptors. These studies suggest that cAMP can have local hormone-like effects in the hippocampal formation which are independent of cAMP-dependent protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2058428789,"ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels are intracellular ligandgated channels which regulate diverse cellular functions. Intracellular nucleoside diphosphates (NDPs) are essential for the physiological opening of KATP channels which would otherwise be permanently closed by their overt sensitivity to intracellular ATP. We find that KATP channels exhibit dualistic behavior toward NDPs depending on their operative condition. When channels are in the spontaneous operative condition, NDPs antagonize channel inhibition by intracellular ATP. When channels have “run down,” NDPs induce channel opening but no longer antagonize intracellular ATP. The switch of the KATP channel response to the same ligand, i.e., NDPs, is controlled by a Mg-ATP-dependent reaction. The condition of the target protein therefore determines the effect of the ligand. This property provides a novel basis to evaluate the dynamic regulation of ion channels by their ligands."
https://openalex.org/W1505724586,"The N-methyl-3'-O-anthranoyl (MANT) guanine nucleotide analogs are useful environmentally sensitive fluorescent probes for studying G protein mechanisms. Both MANT-GTP gamma S (mGTP gamma S) and MANT-GTP (mGTP) displayed a magnesium-dependent increase in fluorescence upon binding to bovine brain G(o). A much greater increase in MANT-guanine nucleotide fluorescence was observed with excitation at 280 nm compared with 350 nm, due to energy transfer from tryptophan in G(o). G(o)-bound mGTP gamma S displays a blue-shift in its emission spectrum indicating a nonpolar environment for the G(o)-bound MANT. For the hydrolyzable analog, mGTP, the increase in fluorescence is followed by a decrease as it is hydrolyzed to mGDP. Unexpectedly, dissociation of mGDP was fast (t1/2 1.7 s) by comparison with GDP itself (t1/2 120 s). Binding of mGTP gamma S to G(o) was slow, but mastoparan increased the rate approximately 4-fold. For mGTP, mastoparan increased both the rate of binding and the peak fluorescence, even at saturating mGTP concentrations. Modeling the mGTP fluorescence kinetics in the presence and absence of mastoparan results in two novel conclusions. First, mGTP does not fully activate the G protein, even when bound. Second, mastoparan appears to increase the rate of the G protein conformational activation step, in addition to its known effect on GDP release."
https://openalex.org/W1596133917,"Association of calcium-dependent isotypes of protein kinase C (PKC) with a phospholipid bilayer is regulated by a single Ca(2+)-binding site. The dependence of PKC association with phosphatidylserine-containing membranes on the concentration of Ca2+ is linear in the submicro- to submillimolar range. The Ca(2+)-regulated association of PKC with the membrane is sensitive to the factors that alter the diffuse double-layer potential produced by anionic lipids such as phosphatidylserine (PS). This indicates that the Ca(2+)-binding site on the membrane-bound enzyme senses a higher concentration of Ca2+ than is present in bulk solution. This is a consequence of the accumulation of Ca2+ in the layer adjacent to the plane of the membrane by the double-layer potential. Calculations based on the Gouy-Chapman-Stern theory of the diffuse double layer yielded a unique value of the Ca2+ dissociation constant for the Ca(2+)-PKC-bilayer complex equal to approximately 700 nM. The soluble form of the enzyme has a 3.5 order of magnitude lower affinity for Ca2+. The free energy of interaction between the Ca(2+)- and PS-binding sites is large (approximately 5 kcal/mol). In contrast, the interaction between the diacylglycerol-binding site and either the Ca(2+)- or PS-binding site appears to be weak."
https://openalex.org/W2052708854,"In cultured rat embryonic septal nuclei with adjacent basal forebrain, murine interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) produces a striking increase in choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity and mRNA. The effect of IFN gamma on cholinergic differentiation is more potent in E14 cultures than in older cultures. IFN gamma does not cause a change in the affinity of ChAT for choline, nor does it affect cell proliferation. Whereas IFN gamma doubles neuronal cell number, the cholinergic cell number increases more than 7-fold. Ameboid microglia respond to IFN gamma with the translocation of p91 to the nucleus. The action of IFN gamma is not mediated by NGF or bFGF. The enhancement of cholinergic expression that occurs with increased cell density may be partly attributable to an endogenous IFN gamma-like molecule, since antibodies to IFN gamma offset the effects of increased cell density."
https://openalex.org/W1506329892,"Promacrophage-stimulating protein (MSP) is an 80-kDa protein that acquires biological activity after cleavage at an Arg-Val bond to a disulfide-linked alpha beta heterodimer by serine proteases of the intrinsic coagulation cascade. These proteases, which include serum kallikrein, factor XIIa and factor XIa, are members of the trypsin family of serine proteases. We now report that two other members of the family, nerve growth factor-gamma (NGF-gamma) and epidermal growth factor-binding protein (EGF-BP), cleave and activate pro-MSP to the disulfide-linked alpha beta heterodimer. Cleavage of 1.5 nM pro-MSP by 1 nM NGF-gamma or EGF-BP at 37 degrees C was almost complete within 30 min. These concentrations of enzyme are about 2 orders of magnitude less than is required for cleavage by serum kallikrein or factor XIIa. Cleavage of pro-MSP to MSP was associated with a conformational change in the protein, because the cleaved product, but not pro-MSP, was detected by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunoassay. Cleavage caused the appearance of biological activity, as measured by chemotactic activity of MSP for resident peritoneal macrophages, by MSP-induced macrophage shape change, and by stimulation of macrophage ingestion of C3bi-coated erythrocytes. These findings suggest the possibility of cooperative interactions between NGF-gamma or EGF-BP and pro-MSP in inflammation and wound healing."
https://openalex.org/W1589505700,"Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is an immune cytokine recently shown to inhibit bone resorption. To determine whether IL-4 directly acts on osteoclasts, we have analyzed its effect on cytosolic calcium concentration [Ca2+]i and bone resorptive function of murine osteoclastic cells generated from bone marrow/stromal cell co-cultures. IL-4 exposure induced an immediate and sustained increase in [Ca2+]i that remained elevated for at least 10 min. This IL-4 effect was dose-dependent, with the maximal effect (209 +/- 15% of baseline, n = 16) at 200 units/ml and an apparent ED0.5 of 60 units/ml. The IL-4-induced [Ca2+]i rise required extracellular Ca2+ influx, since the response was prevented by LaCl3, and voltage-gated Ca2+ channel blockers, although the IL-4 effect was more sensitive to nicardipine and nifedipine than to diltiazem. Depolarization by high extracellular K+ concentration also raised [Ca2+]i, and, under these conditions, osteoclasts failed to respond to IL-4. On the other hand, when intracellular Ca2+ stores were depleted by thapsigargin, IL-4 still induced an increase in [Ca2+]i, although smaller in amplitude and transient. Calcitonin also produced [Ca2+]i increases in osteoclasts, yet it only slightly desensitized these cells to IL-4. Furthermore, IL-4 was much less effective on osteoclasts pretreated (5-10 min) with either forskolin or 8-bromo-cAMP. Both IL-4 and calcitonin were effective even when [Ca2+]i had been increased by exposure to high extracellular Ca2+. Finally, IL-4 dose dependently inhibited the bone-resorptive activity of mature osteoclasts. Therefore, IL-4 signal transduction in osteoclasts involves a rapid and sustained elevation of [Ca2+]i mediated by a voltage-dependent Ca2+ influx, in combination with Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. Modulation of osteoclast [Ca2+]i represents a potential mechanism by which IL-4 inhibits bone resorption."
https://openalex.org/W1497384464,"Serum response factor (SRF) is a nuclear transcription factor that binds to the serum response element (SRE) found in the promoter regions of a number of growth factor-inducible genes, as well as muscle-specific genes. The smooth muscle alpha-actin promoter contains two SRE sequences that can bind to SRF. Its expression is repressed in Ras-transformed fibroblast cells and derepressed in revertant cells. In this study, we demonstrate that SRF can activate alpha-actin expression in Ras-transformed cells and that overexpression of SRF in Ras-transformed cells can revert their transformed phenotype. The ability of SRF to bind to the SRE was required for this effect, since mutations that inhibit DNA binding abolish SRF's ability to activate alpha-actin expression and suppress transformation by the ras oncogene. These results show that SRF, thought to be involved in stimulation of cell growth through activation of growth factor-inducible genes, can actually have the opposite effect and suggest a novel mechanism for suppression of transformation by Ras."

https://openalex.org/W1550771880,"Five cysteine residues in the recombinant cytochrome b reductase domain of corn leaf NADH:nitrate reductase (EC 1.6.6.1) were modified by site-directed mutagenesis. At least two amino acid replacement mutants were generated for each of the 5 cysteines of this domain. Characteristics of the amino acid replacement mutants correlated well with the structural location of the cysteine residues in the preliminary three-dimensional model of the cytochrome b reductase domain: somewhat exposed cysteines could be replaced by hydrophilic amino acid residues, while more buried cysteines by hydrophobic residues. An exception was found for the invariant cysteine near the C terminus, which is found in all nitrate reductases and also in the closely related NADH: cytochrome b5 reductase, as well as, most other members of this flavoenzyme family. No substitution for the invariant cysteine yielded highly active enzyme, although these mutants had normal visible spectra. When the invariant cysteine was mutated to serine, the cytochrome b reductase domain was resistant to inhibition by pchloromercuribenzoate, an inhibitor of nitrate reductases. Kinetic analysis suggested that the catalytic efficiency of the mutant was markedly reduced. We concluded, the invariant cysteine plays an important role in catalysis and may be essential for high catalytic efficiency of nitrate reductases."

https://openalex.org/W69007449,"The C-terminal inducer binding domain of the Escherichia coli galactose repressor (GalR) is homologous to several periplasmic chemoreceptor proteins whose three-dimensional structures have been determined at high resolution (Vyas, N. K., Vyas, M. N., and Quiocho, F. A. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 5226-5237; Mowbray, S. L. and Cole, L. B. (1992) J. Mol. Biol. 225, 155-175). The protein backbone was constructed from the coordinates of glucose/galactose-binding protein using the Homology program (Biosym Technologies, San Diego). Loops were built by searching for substructures in the structure data base, and the side chains were built using a rotamer-base program. A small amount of energy minimization relieved steric strain within the model. The GalR model that has been constructed is consistent with the principles of protein structure; values obtained for the compactness and buried surface area of the model compare favorably with those determined for the chemoreceptor protein structures. The model is consistent with, and provides structural interpretations for, experimental results obtained from physical and biochemical studies. Predictions are made concerning the residues conferring the specificity of galactose induction of GalR and for self-association to dimers. The model provides a first step toward correlating the structure and regulation of GalR and in determining the chemistry of its homologous and heterologous interactions that are critical to its role as a regulator of transcription initiation."
https://openalex.org/W2154151010,"Deletion mutagenesis was used to define the core region of the catalytic subunit of rabbit muscle protein phosphatase-1. Deletions in the N terminus were found to lead to loss of expression. Deletions of up to 33 residues from the C-terminal region were tolerated, and the truncated enzymes were fully active. Deletion of an additional 21 residues led to loss of expression. Mutants which had had 33 and 25 residues deleted maintained specific activities that were comparable to those of the wild type enzyme. The response of these two deletion mutants to okadaic acid, microcystin, and inhibitor-2 was determined. Only slightly lower IC50 values were observed in all cases, showing that the C terminus itself does not play a major role in the binding of these inhibitors. The deletion mutants formed stable complexes with inhibitor-2 as shown by gel filtration. These studies provide unambiguous evidence that the extreme C-terminal region of protein phosphatase-1 is not directly involved in catalytic function or in the binding of inhibitor-2, microcystin, or okadaic acid, and they also establish that the first approximately 300 residues of the sequence constitute a sufficient core for protein phosphatase-1 catalytic functions."

https://openalex.org/W1509030013,"The alpha subunit of Gi2 (Gi2 alpha) is a member of the heterotrimeric G protein family, which transduces receptor signals as a proto-oncogene product. We have found a novel self-suppressive region in Gi2 alpha near its C terminus. A polypeptide consisting of residues 338-352 of Gi2 alpha (Gi2 alpha-339-352) antagonizes receptor- and receptor peptide-stimulated Gi2 alpha activation, without affecting basal activity. Antagonism by Gi2 alpha-338-352 is attributable to an interaction with activated Gi2 alpha, which is not competitive with receptor polypeptides. Combined with the reports suggesting the presence of self-suppressive domains in a juxta-C-terminal portion of Gi2 alpha and G(o) alpha, this study supports the hypothesis that Gi2 alpha-338-352 constitutes an intrinsic guanine nucleotide exchange inhibitor, which in turn antagonizes receptor stimulation, suggesting that G proteins are activated by receptors through relaxation of a self-suppressive conformation."
