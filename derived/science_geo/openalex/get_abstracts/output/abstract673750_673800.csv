https://openalex.org/W3157749513,"Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is initiated by binding of the viral Spike protein to host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), followed by fusion of viral and host membranes. Although antibodies that block this interaction are in emergency use as early coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) therapies, the precise determinants of neutralization potency remain unknown. We discovered a series of antibodies that potently block ACE2 binding but exhibit divergent neutralization efficacy against the live virus. Strikingly, these neutralizing antibodies can inhibit or enhance Spike-mediated membrane fusion and formation of syncytia, which are associated with chronic tissue damage in individuals with COVID-19. As revealed by cryoelectron microscopy, multiple structures of Spike-antibody complexes have distinct binding modes that not only block ACE2 binding but also alter the Spike protein conformational cycle triggered by ACE2 binding. We show that stabilization of different Spike conformations leads to modulation of Spike-mediated membrane fusion with profound implications for COVID-19 pathology and immunity."

Injury can lead to a permanent reduction in gas exchange surface area and respiratory function. Using mouse models, we show that alveolar type 1 (AT1) cell plasticity is a major and unappreciated mechanism that drives regeneration, beginning in the early postnatal period during alveolar maturation. Upon acute neonatal lung injury, AT1 cells reprogram into alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells, promoting alveolar regeneration. In contrast, the ability of AT2 cells to regenerate AT1 cells is restricted to the mature lung. Unbiased genomic assessment reveals that this previously unappreciated level of plasticity is governed by the preferential activity of Hippo signaling in the AT1 cell lineage. Thus, cellular plasticity is a temporally acquired trait of the alveolar epithelium and presents an alternative mode of tissue regeneration in the postnatal lung."

We aimed to study COVID-19 knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) among medical and health sciences students in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). We performed a cross-sectional study between 2 June and 19 August 2020. The survey was distributed online using Survey Monkey. It was conducted in English and comprised two parts: socio-demographic characteristics, and KAP towards COVID-19. 712 responses to the questionnaire were collected. 90% of respondents (n = 695) were undergraduate students, while 10% (n = 81) were postgraduates. The majority (87%, n = 647) stated that they obtained COVID-19 information from multiple reliable sources. They were highly knowledgeable about the COVID-19 pandemic, but 76% (n = 539) did not recognize its routes of transmission. Medical students were significantly more knowledgeable compared with allied health students (P&lt;0.0001, Mann Whitney U test) but there was no difference in knowledge between undergraduate and postgraduate students (P = 0.14, Mann Whitney U test). Medical students thought that more could be done to mitigate the COVID-19 situation compared with the allied health students (66.2% compared with 51.6%, p = 0.002 Fisher’s Exact test). 63% (n = 431) were worried about getting COVID-19 infection, while 92% (n = 633)) were worried that a family member could be infected with the virus. 97% (n = 655) took precautions when accepting home deliveries, 94% (n = 637) had been washing their hands more frequently, and 95% (n = 643) had been wearing face masks. In conclusion, medical and health sciences students in the UAE showed high levels of knowledge and good attitudes and practices towards the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, they were worried about themselves or their family members becoming infected. Medical students had more knowledge about COVID-19 pandemic which was reflected in their opinion that more can be done to mitigate its effects."
https://openalex.org/W3163888857,"The number of retracted articles has grown fast. However, the extent to which researchers and the public are made adequately aware of these retractions and how the media and social media respond to them remains unknown. Here, we aimed to evaluate the media and social media attention received by retracted articles and assess also the attention they receive post-retraction versus pre-retraction. We downloaded all records of retracted literature maintained by the Retraction Watch Database and originally published between January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2015. For all 3,008 retracted articles with a separate DOI for the original and its retraction, we downloaded the respective Altmetric Attention Score (AAS) (from Altmetric) and citation count (from Crossref), for the original article and its retraction notice on June 6, 2018. We also compared the AAS of a random sample of 572 retracted full journal articles available on PubMed to that of unretracted full articles matched from the same issue and journal. 1,687 (56.1%) of retracted research articles received some amount of Altmetric attention, and 165 (5.5%) were even considered popular (AAS&gt;20). 31 (1.0%) of 2,953 with a record on Crossref received &gt;100 citations by June 6, 2018. Popular articles received substantially more attention than their retraction, even after adjusting for attention received post-retraction (Median difference, 29; 95% CI, 17–61). Unreliable results were the most frequent reason for retraction of popular articles (32; 19%), while fake peer review was the most common reason (421; 15%) for the retraction of other articles. In comparison to matched articles, retracted articles tended to receive more Altmetric attention (23/31 matched groups; P-value, 0.01), even after adjusting for attention received post-retraction. Our findings reveal that retracted articles may receive high attention from media and social media and that for popular articles, pre-retraction attention far outweighs post-retraction attention."
https://openalex.org/W3162023024,"Objectives An Opioid Treatment Desert is an area with limited accessibility to medication-assisted treatment and recovery facilities for Opioid Use Disorder. We explored the concept of Opioid Treatment Deserts including racial differences in potential spatial accessibility and applied it to one Midwestern urban county using high resolution spatiotemporal data. Methods We obtained individual-level data from one Emergency Medical Services (EMS) agency (Columbus Fire Department) in Franklin County, Ohio. Opioid overdose events were based on EMS runs where naloxone was administered from 1/1/2013 to 12/31/2017. Potential spatial accessibility was measured as the time (in minutes) it would take an individual, who may decide to seek treatment after an opioid overdose, to travel from where they had the overdose event, which was a proxy measure of their residential location, to the nearest opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment provider that provided medically-assisted treatment (MAT). We estimated accessibility measures overall, by race and by four types of treatment providers (any type of MAT for OUD, Buprenorphine, Methadone, or Naltrexone). Areas were classified as an Opioid Treatment Desert if the estimate travel time to treatment provider (any type of MAT for OUD) was greater than a given threshold. We performed sensitivity analysis using a range of threshold values based on multiple modes of transportation (car and public transit) and using only EMS runs to home/residential location types. Results A total of 6,929 geocoded opioid overdose events based on data from EMS agencies were used in the final analysis. Most events occurred among 26–35 years old (34%), identified as White adults (56%) and male (62%). Median travel times and interquartile range (IQR) to closest treatment provider by car and public transit was 2 minutes (IQR: 3 minutes) and 17 minutes (IQR: 17 minutes), respectively. Several neighborhoods in the study area had limited accessibility to OUD treatment facilities and were classified as Opioid Treatment Deserts. Travel time by public transit for most treatment provider types and by car for Methadone-based treatment was significantly different between individuals who were identified as Black adults and White adults based on their race. Conclusions Disparities in access to opioid treatment exist at the sub-county level in specific neighborhoods and across racial groups in Columbus, Ohio and can be quantified and visualized using local public safety data (e.g., EMS runs). Identification of Opioid Treatment Deserts can aid multiple stakeholders better plan and allocate resources for more equitable access to MAT for OUD and, therefore, reduce the burden of the opioid epidemic while making better use of real-time public safety data to address a public health epidemic that has turned into a public safety crisis."
https://openalex.org/W3130012542,"Environmental Microorganism Data Set Fifth Version (EMDS-5) is a microscopic image dataset including original Environmental Microorganism (EM) images and two sets of Ground Truth (GT) images. The GT image sets include a single-object GT image set and a multi-object GT image set. EMDS-5 has 21 types of EMs, each of which contains 20 original EM images, 20 single-object GT images and 20 multi-object GT images. EMDS-5 can realize to evaluate image preprocessing, image segmentation, feature extraction, image classification and image retrieval functions. In order to prove the effectiveness of EMDS-5, for each function, we select the most representative algorithms and price indicators for testing and evaluation. The image preprocessing functions contain two parts: image denoising and image edge detection. Image denoising uses nine kinds of filters to denoise 13 kinds of noises, respectively. In the aspect of edge detection, six edge detection operators are used to detect the edges of the images, and two evaluation indicators, peak-signal to noise ratio and mean structural similarity, are used for evaluation. Image segmentation includes single-object image segmentation and multi-object image segmentation. Six methods are used for single-object image segmentation, while k-means and U-net are used for multi-object segmentation. We extract nine features from the images in EMDS-5 and use the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for testing. In terms of image classification, we select the VGG16 feature to test SVM, k-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forests. We test two types of retrieval approaches: texture feature retrieval and deep learning feature retrieval. We select the last layer of features of VGG16 network and ResNet50 network as feature vectors. We use mean average precision as the evaluation index for retrieval.

https://openalex.org/W3160262453,"The role of systemic inflammation has not been clearly defined in thyroid cancers. There have been conflicting reports on whether systemic inflammatory markers have predictive value for thyroid cancers. We aimed to evaluate the association between systemic inflammatory markers and clinicopathological factors in thyroid cancers and to assess their predictive value for thyroid cancers in detail. Five hundred thirty-one patients who underwent surgery for thyroid nodules were included. The patient population consisted of 99 individuals (18.6%) with benign thyroid nodules and 432 individuals (81.4%) with thyroid cancers. In 432 patients with thyroid cancers, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was significantly higher in the cases with tumors greater than 2 cm than in those with tumors less than 2 cm. (p = 0.027). NLR and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) were significantly higher in cases with lateral lymph node metastasis (LNM) than in those without LNM (p = 0.007 and 0.090, respectively). The nodule size was significantly higher in benign thyroid nodules than in thyroid cancers (p < 0.001). When the cases were stratified by tumor size, NLR was a significant predictor of thyroid cancers in cases with nodules greater than 2 cm (Exp(B) = 1.85, 95% CI = 1.15-2.97, p = 0.011), but not in those with nodules less than 2 cm. In thyroid cancers, preoperative NLR was associated with pathological prognosticators such as tumor size and lateral lymph node metastasis. When the size difference between thyroid cancers and benign thyroid nodules was adjusted, NLR could be a significant predictor of thyroid cancers."
https://openalex.org/W3161701918,"Research into the epigenome is of growing importance as a loss of epigenetic control has been implicated in the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Previous studies have implicated aberrant DNA and histone methylation in multiple sclerosis (MS) disease pathogenesis. We have previously reported that the methyl donor betaine is depleted in MS and is linked to changes in histone H3 trimethylation (H3K4me3) in neurons. We have also shown that betaine increases histone methyltransferase activity by activating chromatin bound betaine homocysteine S-methyltransferase (BHMT). Here, we investigated the role of the BHMT-betaine methylation pathway in oligodendrocytes. Immunocytochemistry in the human MO3.13 cell line, primary rat oligodendrocytes, and tissue from MS postmortem brain confirmed the presence of the BHMT enzyme in the nucleus in oligodendrocytes. BHMT expression is increased 2-fold following oxidative insult, and qRT-PCR demonstrated that betaine can promote an increase in expression of oligodendrocyte maturation genes SOX10 and NKX-2.2 under oxidative conditions. Chromatin fractionation provided evidence of a direct interaction of BHMT on chromatin and co-IP analysis indicates an interaction between BHMT and DNMT3a. Our data show that both histone and DNA methyltransferase activity are increased following betaine administration. Betaine effects were shown to be dependent on BHMT expression following siRNA knockdown of BHMT. This is the first report of BHMT expression in oligodendrocytes and suggests that betaine acts through BHMT to modulate histone and DNA methyltransferase activity on chromatin. These data suggest that methyl donor availability can impact epigenetic changes and maturation in oligodendrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W3163545948,"MicroRNA (miRNA) circulating in plasma have been proposed as biomarkers for a variety of conditions and diseases, including complications during pregnancy. During pregnancy, about 15-25% of maternal plasma exosomes, a small size-class of EVs, are hypothesized to originate in the placenta, and may play a role in communication between the fetus and mother. However, few studies have addressed changes in miRNA over the course of pregnancy with repeated measures, nor focused on diverse populations. We describe changes in miRNA in early and late pregnancy from the MADRES cohort of primarily low-income Hispanic women based in Los Angeles, CA. miRNA derived from extracellular-vesicles (EVs) were isolated from maternal blood plasma samples collected in early and late pregnancy. In this study, we identified 64 of 130 detectable miRNA which significantly increased with gestational age at the time of collection (GA), and 26 which decreased with GA. Possible fetal sex-specific associations were observed for 30 of these 90 significant miRNA. Predicted gene targets for miRNA significantly associated with GA were identified using MirDIP and were found to be enriched for Gene Ontology categories that included energetic and metabolic processes but were underrepresented in immune-related categories. Circulating EV-associated miRNA during pregnancy are likely important for maternal-fetal communication, and may play roles in supporting and maintaining a healthy pregnancy, given the changing needs of the fetus."
https://openalex.org/W3162443156,"Background Data regarding the clinical outcomes of covered stents (CSs) used to seal coronary artery perforations (CAPs) in the all-comer population are scarce. The aim of the CRACK Registry was to evaluate the procedural, 30-days and 1-year outcomes after CAP treated by CS implantation. Methods This multicenter all-comer registry included data of consecutive patients with CAP treated by CS implantation. The primary endpoint was the composite of major adverse cardiac events (MACEs), defined as cardiac death, target lesion revascularization (TLR), and myocardial infarction (MI). Results The registry included 119 patients (mean age: 68.9 ± 9.7 years, 55.5% men). Acute coronary syndrome, including: unstable angina 21 (17.6%), NSTEMI 26 (21.8%), and STEMI 26 (21.8%), was the presenting diagnosis in 61.3%, and chronic coronary syndromes in 38.7% of patients. The most common lesion type, according to ACC/AHA classification, was type C lesion in 47 (39.5%) of cases. A total of 52 patients (43.7%) had type 3 Ellis classification, 28 patients (23.5%) had type 2 followed by 39 patients (32.8%) with type 1 perforation. Complex PCI was performed in 73 (61.3%) of patients. Periprocedural death occurred in eight patients (6.7%), of which two patients had emergency cardiac surgery. Those patients were excluded from the one-year analysis. Successful sealing of the perforation was achieved in 99 (83.2%) patients. During the follow-up, 26 (26.2%) patients experienced MACE [7 (7.1%) cardiac deaths, 13 (13.1%) TLR, 11 (11.0%) MIs]. Stent thrombosis (ST) occurred in 6 (6.1%) patients [4(4.0%) acute ST, 1(1.0%) subacute ST and 1(1.0%) late ST]. Conclusions The use of covered stents is an effective treatment of CAP. The procedural and 1-year outcomes of CAP treated by CS implantation showed that such patients should remain under follow-up due to relatively high risk of MACE."
https://openalex.org/W3163636050,"Gout is a multifaceted inflammatory disease involving vascular impairments induced by hyperuricemia. Experiments using human umbilical vein endothelial cells treated with uric acid (UA), monosodium urate (MSU), or serum from gout patients showed increased expression of pro-inflammatory genes (ie, VCAM1, ICAM1, CYR61, CCNA1, and E2F1) with attendant increase in monocyte adhesion. Mechanistically, UA- or MSU-induced SREBP2 expression and its transcriptional activity. RNA sequencing analysis and real-time PCR showed the induction of YAP signaling and pro-inflammatory pathways in HUVECs transfected with adenovirus-SREBP2. The SREBP2 knockdown by siRNA partially abolished UA- or MSU-induced YAP activity, pro-inflammatory gene expression, and monocytes adhesion. Vascular intima from transgenic mice overexpressing SREBP2 in endothelium or mice with hyperuricemia exhibited activated YAP signaling and increased expression of pro-inflammatory genes. Betulin, an SREBP pharmacological inhibitor, attenuated the UA-, MSU-, or gout serum-induced endothelial cell inflammation and dysfunction. In the human study, endothelial cell function, assessed by EndoPAT, was negatively correlated with serum UA level among gouty patients and healthy controls. Collectively, UA or MSU causes endothelial dysfunction via SREBP2 transactivation of YAP. Betulin inhibition of SREBP2 may restrain gout-induced endothelial dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W3160183738,"The endothelial glycocalyx is a dynamic structure integral to blood vessel hemodynamics and capable of tightly regulating a range of biological processes (ie, innate immunity, inflammation, and coagulation) through dynamic changes in its composition of the brush structure. Evaluating the specific roles of the endothelial glycocalyx under a range of pathophysiologic conditions has been a challenge in vitro as it is difficult to generate functional glycocalyces using commonly employed 2D cell culture models. We present a new multi-height microfluidic platform that promotes the growth of functional glycocalyces by eliciting unique shear stress forces over a continuous human umbilical vein endothelial cell monolayer at magnitudes that recapitulate the physical environment in arterial, capillary and venous regions of the vasculature. Following 72 hours of shear stress, unique glycocalyx structures formed within each region that were distinct from that observed in short (3 days) and long-term (21 days) static cell culture. The model demonstrated glycocalyx-specific properties that match the characteristics of the endothelium in arteries, capillaries and veins, with respect to surface protein expression, platelet adhesion, lymphocyte binding and nanoparticle uptake. With artery-to-capillary-to-vein transition on a continuous endothelial monolayer, this in vitro platform is an improved system over static cell culture for more effectively studying the role of the glycocalyx in endothelial biology and disease."
https://openalex.org/W3160553542,"With the rapid advancement of information and communication technologies, there is a growing transformation of healthcare systems. A patient’s health data can now be centrally stored in the cloud and be shared with multiple healthcare stakeholders, enabling the patient to be collaboratively treated by more than one healthcare institution. However, several issues, including data security and privacy concerns still remain unresolved. Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) has shown promising potential in providing data security and privacy in cloud-based systems. Nevertheless, the conventional CP-ABE scheme is inadequate for direct adoption in a collaborative ehealth system. For one, its expressiveness is limited as it is based on a monotonic access structure. Second, it lacks an attribute/user revocation mechanism. Third, the computational burden on both the data owner and data users is linear with the number of attributes in the ciphertext. To address these inadequacies, we propose CESCR, a CP-ABE for efficient and secure sharing of health data in collaborative ehealth systems with immediate and efficient attribute/user revocation. The CESCR scheme is unbounded, i.e., it does not bind the size of the attribute universe to the security parameter, it is based on the expressive and non-restrictive ordered binary decision diagram (OBDD) access structure, and it securely outsources the computationally demanding attribute operations of both encryption and decryption processes without requiring a dummy attribute. Security analysis shows that the CESCR scheme is secure in the selective model. Simulation and performance comparisons with related schemes also demonstrate that the CESCR scheme is expressive and efficient."
https://openalex.org/W3161414675,"Rates of mental illness and heavy alcohol use are exceedingly high in the legal profession, while attrition among women has also been a longstanding problem. Work overcommitment, work-family conflict, permissiveness toward alcohol in the workplace, and the likelihood of promotion are all implicated but have yet to be systematically investigated. Data were collected from 2,863 lawyers randomly sampled from the California Lawyers Association and D.C. Bar to address this knowledge gap. Findings indicated that the prevalence and severity of depression, anxiety, stress, and risky/hazardous drinking were significantly higher among women. Further, one-quarter of all women contemplated leaving the profession due to mental health concerns, compared to 17% of men. Logistic models were conducted to identify workplace factors predictive of stress, risky drinking, and contemplating leaving the profession. Overcommitment and permissiveness toward alcohol at work were associated with the highest likelihood of stress and risky drinking (relative to all other predictors) for both men and women. However, women and men differed with respect to predictors of leaving the profession due to stress or mental health. For women, work-family conflict was associated with the highest likelihood of leaving, while overcommitment was the number one predictor of leaving for men. Mental health and gender disparities are significant problems in the legal profession, clearly requiring considerable and sustained attention."
https://openalex.org/W3161987942,"Diacylglycerol kinases catalyze the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of diacylglycerol (DAG) to produce phosphatidic acid (PA). In humans, the alpha isoform (DGKα) has emerged as a potential target in the treatment of cancer due to its anti-tumor and pro-immune responses. However, its mechanism of action at a molecular level is not fully understood. In this work, a systematic investigation of the role played by the membrane in the regulation of the enzymatic properties of human DGKα is presented. By using a cell-free system with purified DGKα and model membranes of variable physical and chemical properties, it is shown that membrane physical properties determine human DGKα substrate acyl chain specificity. In model membranes with a flat morphology; DGKα presents high enzymatic activity, but it is not able to differentiate DAG molecular species. Furthermore, DGKα enzymatic properties are insensitive to membrane intrinsic curvature. However, in the presence of model membranes with altered morphology, specifically the presence of physically curved membrane structures, DGKα bears substrate acyl chain specificity for palmitic acid-containing DAG. The present results identify changes in membrane morphology as one possible mechanism for the depletion of specific pools of DAG as well as the production of specific pools of PA by DGKα, adding an extra layer of regulation on the interconversion of these two potent lipid-signaling molecules. It is proposed that the interplay between membrane physical (shape) and chemical (lipid composition) properties guarantee a fine-tuned signal transduction system dependent on the levels and molecular species of DAG and PA."
https://openalex.org/W3162365722,"Protein sorting at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) usually requires the assistance of cargo adaptors. However, it remains to be examined how the same complex can mediate both the export and retention of different proteins or how sorting complexes interact among themselves. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the exomer complex is involved in the polarized transport of some proteins from the TGN to the plasma membrane (PM). Intriguingly, exomer and its cargos also show a sort of functional relationship with TGN clathrin adaptors that is still unsolved. Here, using a wide range of techniques, including time-lapse and BIFC microscopy, we describe new molecular implications of the exomer complex in protein sorting and address its different layers of functional interaction with clathrin adaptor complexes. Exomer mutants show impaired amino acid uptake because it facilitates not only the polarized delivery of amino acid permeases to the PM but also participates in their endosomal traffic. We propose a model for exomer where it modulates the recruitment of TGN clathrin adaptors directly or indirectly through the Arf1 function. Moreover, we describe an in vivo competitive relationship between the exomer and AP-1 complexes for the model cargo Chs3. These results highlight a broad role for exomer in regulating protein sorting at the TGN that is complementary to its role as cargo adaptor and present a model to understand the complexity of TGN protein sorting."
https://openalex.org/W3163269369,"The ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) family proteins act as linkers between the actin cytoskeleton and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and regulate the plasma membrane localization and functionality of the latter in various cancer cells. Notably, P-gp overexpression in the plasma membrane of cancer cells is a principal factor responsible for multidrug resistance and drug-induced mutagenesis. However, it remains unknown whether the ERM proteins contribute to the plasma membrane localization and transport function of P-gp in human colorectal cancer cells in which the subcellular localization of ERM has yet to be determined. This study aimed to determine the gene expression patterns and subcellular localization of ERM and P-gp and investigate the role of ERM proteins in the plasma membrane localization and transport function of P-gp using the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line LS180. Using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence analyses, we showed higher levels of ezrin and moesin mRNAs than those of radixin mRNA in these cells and preferential distribution of all three ERM proteins on the plasma membrane. The ERM proteins were highly colocalized with P-gp. Additionally, we show that the knockdown of ezrin, but not of radixin and moesin, by RNA interference significantly decreased the cell surface expression of P-gp in LS180 cells without affecting the mRNA expression of P-gp. Furthermore, gene silencing of ezrin substantially increased the intracellular accumulation of rhodamine123, a typical P-gp substrate, with no alterations in the plasma membrane permeability of Evans blue, a passive transport marker. In conclusion, ezrin may primarily regulate the cell surface localization and transport function of P-gp as a scaffold protein without influencing the transcriptional activity of P-gp in LS180 cells. These findings should be relevant for treating colorectal cancer, which is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in males and females combined."
https://openalex.org/W3160044786,"A growing body of research has investigated the regulation of negative emotions in ecological settings, but little is known about the mechanisms underlying positive emotion regulation in everyday life. Although some evidence suggests that adopting positive strategies is beneficial for emotional well-being, the literature is inconsistent about the effects of positive emotions on subsequent regulatory processes. In the present study, we adopted a two-week ecological momentary assessment to explore the association between positive emotions and positive emotion regulation in daily life. According to our results, the less individuals felt positive emotions at one point, the more they tended to enhance their use of positive strategies from this time to the next, which in turn resulted in subsequent higher levels of positive emotions. This prototype of positive regulation can be seen as a highly adaptive mechanism that makes it possible to compensate for a lack of positive emotions by enhancing the deployment of positive strategies. The theoretical and clinical implications of these findings are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W3160545889,"Circadian misalignment, as seen in shift work, is associated with an increased risk to develop type 2 diabetes. In an experimental setting, we recently showed that a rapid day–night shift for 3 consecutive nights leads to misalignment of the core molecular clock, induction of the PPAR pathway, and insulin resistance in skeletal muscle of young, healthy men. Here, we investigated if circadian misalignment affects the skeletal muscle lipidome and intramyocellular lipid droplet characteristics, explaining the misalignment-induced insulin resistance. Fourteen healthy men underwent one aligned and one circadian misalignment period, both consisting of ~3.5 days. In the misaligned condition, day and night were rapidly shifted by 12 hours leading to opposite eating, sleep, and activity times compared with the aligned condition. For each condition, two muscle biopsies were taken from the m. vastus lateralis in the morning and evening and subjected to semi-targeted lipidomics and confocal microscopy analysis. We found that only 2% of detected lipids were different between morning and evening in the aligned condition, whereas 12% displayed a morning–evening difference upon misalignment. Triacylglycerols, in particular species of a carbon length ≥55, were the most abundant lipid species changed upon misalignment. Cardiolipins were decreased upon misalignment, whereas phosphatidylcholines consistently followed the same morning–evening pattern, suggesting regulation by the circadian clock. Cholesteryl esters adjusted to the shifted behavior. Lipid droplet characteristics remained unaltered upon misalignment. Together, these findings show that simulated shift work disturbs the skeletal muscle lipidome, which may contribute to misalignment-induced insulin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W3160795726,"Background Plasma omentin levels have been shown to be associated with circulating adiponectin concentrations and cardiometabolic disease-related outcomes. In this study, we aim to examine the association of omentin gene polymorphism with serum adiponectin levels and cardiometabolic health status using a genetic approach, and investigate whether these associations are modified by lifestyle factors. Methods The study included 945 normal glucose tolerant and 941 unrelated individuals with type 2 diabetes randomly selected from the Chennai Urban Rural Epidemiology Study (CURES), in southern India. Study participants were classified into cardiometabolically healthy and unhealthy, where cardiometabolically healthy were those without hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. Fasting serum adiponectin levels were measured by radioimmunoassay. The omentin A326T (rs2274907) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was screened by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and direct sequencing. Results The ‘A’ allele of the omentin SNP was significantly associated with lower adiponectin concentrations after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) and cardiometabolic health status (p = 1.90 x 10 −47 ). There was also a significant association between circulating adiponectin concentrations and cardiometabolic health status after adjusting for age, sex, BMI, WC and Omentin SNP (p = 7.47x10 -10 ). However, after adjusting for age, sex, BMI, WC and adiponectin levels, the association of ‘A’ allele with cardiometabolic health status disappeared (p = 0.79) suggesting that adiponectin serves as a mediator of the association between omentin SNP and cardiometabolic health status. There were no significant interactions between the SNP and dietary factors on adiponectin levels and cardiometabolic health status (p&gt;0.25, for all comparisons). Conclusions Our findings show that adiponectin might function as a mechanistic link between omentin SNP and increased risk of cardiometabolic diseases independent of common and central obesity in Asian Indians. Before strategies to promote adiponectin modulation could be implemented, further studies are required to confirm the molecular mechanisms involved in this triangular relationship between omentin gene, adiponectin and cardiometabolic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3162663660,"The lactating mammary gland harbours numerous matured alveoli with their lumen surrounded by differentiated mammary epithelial cells (MECs), which are exclusively involved in milk synthesis and secretion. Buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) is the second major milk-producing animal, and its physiology is different from cattle. The complete protein machinery involved in MECs differentiation is still not defined in ruminants, in particular, buffalo. Therefore, we have studied the differential expression of regulated proteins in the in vitro grown buffalo MECs (BuMECs) at different time points (on 3, 6, 12, and 15 days) of their differentiation in the presence of lactogenic hormones. TMT-based MS analysis identified 4,934 proteins; of them, 681 were differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). The principal component analysis suggested a highly heterogeneous expression of DEPs at the four-time points of hormone treatment, with most of them (307) attained the highest expression on 12 days. Bioinformatics analysis revealed the association of DEPs with 24 KEGG pathways. We observed few new proteins, namely ABCA13, IVL, VPS37, CZIB, RFX7, Rab5, TTLL12, SMEK1, GDI2, and TMEM131 in BuMECs. The function of one of the highly upregulated proteins, namely involucrin in the differentiation of BuMECs was confirmed based on biochemical inhibition assay. The results further conclude that the proteins with higher abundance can be considered as the potential biomarkers for differentiation, and they may have a significant association with the lactation process in buffalo too. The proteome dataset obtained can be used to understand the species-specific variations among other lactating animals."
https://openalex.org/W3160137203,"The mechanisms underpinning beta-cell compensation for obesity-associated insulin resistance and beta-cell failure in type 2 diabetes remain poorly understood. We used a large-scale strategy to determine the time-dependent transcriptomic changes in islets of diabetes-prone db/db and diabetes-resistant ob/ob mice at 6 and 16 weeks of age. Differentially expressed genes were subjected to cluster, gene ontology, pathway and gene set enrichment analyses. A distinctive gene expression pattern was observed in 16 week db/db islets in comparison to the other groups with alterations in transcriptional regulators of islet cell identity, upregulation of glucose/lipid metabolism, and various stress response genes, and downregulation of specific amino acid transport and metabolism genes. In contrast, ob/ob islets displayed a coordinated downregulation of metabolic and stress response genes at 6 weeks of age, suggestive of a preemptive reconfiguration in these islets to lower the threshold of metabolic activation in response to increased insulin demand thereby preserving beta-cell function and preventing cellular stress. In addition, amino acid transport and metabolism genes were upregulated in ob/ob islets, suggesting an important role of glutamate metabolism in beta-cell compensation. Gene set enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes identified the enrichment of binding motifs for transcription factors, FOXO4, NFATC1, and MAZ. siRNA-mediated knockdown of these genes in MIN6 cells altered cell death, insulin secretion, and stress gene expression. In conclusion, these data revealed novel gene regulatory networks involved in beta-cell compensation and failure. Preemptive metabolic reconfiguration in diabetes-resistant islets may dampen metabolic activation and cellular stress during obesity."
https://openalex.org/W3160232875,"Background Children born with low birth weight (LBW) tend to have lower neurodevelopmental scores compared to term normal birth weight children. It is important to determine factors that influence neurodevelopment in these low birth weight children especially in the first 2–3 years of life that represents a period of substantial brain development. Methods This secondary data analysis was conducted using data from LBW infants enrolled soon after birth in an individually randomized controlled trial (RCT) and followed up till end of 1 st year. Neurodevelopmental assessment was done at 12 months of corrected age by trained psychologists using Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development 3 rd edition (Bayley-III). Factors influencing cognitive, motor and language scores were determined using multivariable linear regression model. Results Linear growth (i.e., length for age z score, LAZ) [ cognitive : Standardized ẞ-coefficient = 2.19, 95% CI; 1.29, 3.10; motor : 2.41, 95% CI; 1.59, 3.23; language : 1.37, 95% CI; 0.70, 2.04], stimulation at home [ cognitive : 0.21, 95% CI; 0.15, 0.27; motor : 0.12, 95% CI; 0.07, 0.17; language : 0.21, 95% CI; 0.16, 0.25] and number of diarrhoeal episodes [ cognitive : -2.87, 95% CI; -4.34, -1.39; motor : -2.62, 95% CI; -3.93, -1.29; language : -2.25, 95% CI; -3.32, -1.17] influenced the composite scores in all three domains i.e., cognitive, language and motor. While increase in LAZ score and stimulation led to increase in composite scores; an increase in number of diarrhoeal episodes was associated with decrease in scores. Weight for height z scores (WHZ) were associated with motor and language but not with cognitive scores. Additionally, a negative association of birth order with cognitive and language scores was noted. Conclusions The findings indicate the possible importance of promoting nutrition and preventing diarrhoea as well as ensuring optimal stimulation and nurturance at home for enhancing child development in LBW infants."
https://openalex.org/W3160519118,"Objectives KRAS , NRAS , and BRAF mutations are commonly present in colorectal cancer (CRC). We estimated the frequency of KRAS , NRAS , and BRAF mutations and assessed their impact on survival and other clinical variables among Saudi patients. Design Retrospective cohort study design. Settings Oncology department of a tertiary hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. We gathered information from 2016 to 2018. Participants Cohort of 248 CRC patients to assess the demographic data, pathological tumour features, response to treatment modalities, disease progression, and metastasis. Statistical analysis used Correlation analysis using the chi-square test. Survival analysis using a Kaplan Meier method. Cox regression analysis to calculate the hazard ratios. Results Demographic data revealed that 84% of patients were diagnosed with CRC above the age of 50 years. Only 27% of patients presented with distant metastasis. KRAS mutations were the most prevalent (49.6%), followed by NRAS mutations (2%) and BRAF mutations (0.4%). Wild type tumours were found among 44.4% of patients. KRAS mutation showed no significant correlation with the site, type, pathological grade, and stage of the tumour. The mean survival time was shorter among patients with KRAS mutations than among patients with wild type KRAS tumours (54.46 vs. 58.02 months). Adjusted analysis showed that the survival time was significantly affected by patients’ age at diagnosis (P = 0.04). Male patients had an increased risk of mortality by 77% (hazard ratio: 1.77). Conclusions Saudi CRC patients had a high frequency of KRAS mutations and a low frequency of BRAF mutations. The KRAS mutation status did not affect the patients’ survival."
https://openalex.org/W3160598816,"Changes in funerary practices are key to the understanding of social transformations of past societies. Over the course of the Nordic Bronze Age, funerary practices changed from inhumation to cremation. The aim of this study is to shed light on this fundamental change through a cross-examination of archaeometric provenance data and archaeological discussions of the context and layouts of early cremation graves. To this end, we conducted 19 new provenance analyses of strontium isotopes from Early Nordic Bronze age contexts in Thisted County and Zealand and Late Bronze Age contexts from Thisted County and Vesthimmerland (Denmark). These data are subsequently compared with data from other extant relevant studies, including those from Late Bronze Age Fraugde on the Danish island of Fyn. Overall, the variations within our provenience data suggest that the integration and establishment of cremation may not have had a one-to-one relationship with in-migration to Nordic Bronze Age Denmark. Moreover, there seems to be no single blanket scenario which dictated the uptake of cremation as a practice within this part of Southern Scandinavia. By addressing habitus in relation to the deposition of cremations as juxtaposed with these provenance data ¸ we hypothesize several potential pathways for the uptake of cremation as a new cultural practice within the Danish Nordic Bronze Age and suggest that this may have been a highly individual process, whose tempo may have been dictated by the specificities of the region(s) concerned."
https://openalex.org/W3161021596,"Background This study aimed to identify the most frequent reasons for orthopedic medical malpractice, gain insight into the related patient demographics and clinical characteristics, and identify the independent factors associated with it. Methods We collected and analyzed the demographic and injury characteristics, hospital levels and treatments, medical errors, and orthopedist’s degree of responsibility for the patients who were subject to orthopedic medical malpractice at our institution. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the factors associated with the orthopedist’s degree of responsibility in the medical malpractice cases. Results We included 1922 cases of medical malpractice in the final analysis. There were 1195 and 727 men and women, respectively (62.2% and 37.8%, respectively). Of the total patients, 1810, 1038, 1558, 1441, and 414 patients (94.2%, 54.0%, 81.1%, 75.0%, and 21.5%, respectively) were inpatients, had closed injuries, underwent surgery, were trauma cases, and had preoperative comorbidities, respectively. Most medical malpractice cases were in patients with fractures and spinal degenerative disease (1229 and 253 cases; 63.9% and 13.2%, respectively), and occurred in city-level hospitals (1006 cases, 52.3%), which were located in the eastern part of china (1001, 52.1%), including Jiangsu and Zhejiang (279 and 233 cases, 14.52% and 52.1%, respectively). Between 2016 and 2017, the orthopedist’s degree of responsibility in medical malpractice claims were deemed as full, primary, equal, secondary, and minor in 135, 654, 77, 716, and 340 orthopedists (7.0%, 34.0%, 4.0%, 37.3%, and 17.7%). Most medical errors made by orthopedists in cases of medical malpractice were related to failure to supervise or monitor cases, improper performance of procedures, and failure to instruct or communicate with the patient (736, 716, and 423 cases; 38.3%, 37.3%, and 22.0%, respectively). The multivariate analysis found that patients with preoperative comorbidities, who sustained humerus injuries, who were aged ≥65 years, who were treated by doctors who failed to supervise or monitor them, and who were treated at the provincial and city level hospitals were more likely to claim that the orthopedist bore a serious degree of responsibility in the medical malpractice case. Conclusions Our results provide detailed information on the plaintiff demographics, clinical characteristics, and factors associated with medical malpractice. Medical malpractice is related to poor treatment outcomes. The first preventative measure that is required is a comprehensive improvement in the medical staff quality, mainly through medical ethics cultivation, and professional ability and technique training. Additionally, failure to supervise or monitor cases was the leading cause of medical malpractice and one of the factors that led to orthopedists bearing an equal and higher responsibility for medical malpractice. Orthopedists should improve patient supervision, especially when treating older patients and those with preoperative comorbidities and humerus injuries."
https://openalex.org/W3161326470,"As COVID-19 spreads across the United States, people experiencing homelessness (PEH) are among the most vulnerable to the virus. To mitigate transmission, municipal governments are procuring isolation facilities for PEH to utilize following possible exposure to the virus. Here we describe the framework for anticipating isolation bed demand in PEH communities that we developed to support public health planning in Austin, Texas during March 2020. Using a mathematical model of COVID-19 transmission, we projected that, under no social distancing orders, a maximum of 299 (95% Confidence Interval: 223, 321) PEH may require isolation rooms in the same week. Based on these analyses, Austin Public Health finalized a lease agreement for 205 isolation rooms on March 27th 2020. As of October 7th 2020, a maximum of 130 rooms have been used on a single day, and a total of 602 PEH have used the facility. As a general rule of thumb, we expect the peak proportion of the PEH population that will require isolation to be roughly triple the projected peak daily incidence in the city. This framework can guide the provisioning of COVID-19 isolation and post-acute care facilities for high risk communities throughout the United States."
https://openalex.org/W3161431751,"Wider networks of people are affected by a suicide death than originally thought, including those whose job-role brings them into contact with a death by suicide of another person. The impact of student suicide within United Kingdom (UK) Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) is unexplored and the experiences of staff members remain unknown. It is not known whether staff members have specific postvention needs following a student death by suicide. Any postvention support currently offered to staff members within UK HEIs lacks a context-specific evidence base. This study asked 'How is a student suicide experienced by staff members within a UK HEI and what are the features of that experience?' Staff members from diverse job-roles in two UK HEIs responded to a qualitative survey (n = 19) and participated in semi-structured interviews (n = 10). Data were transcribed and subjected to a constructivist grounded theory analysis. Participants' experiences informed the development of a core category: 'Bearing witness', which encompassed six further categories: 'Responding to a student suicide'; 'Experiencing a student suicide'; 'Needs and fears'; 'Experiences of support'; 'Human stories'; and 'Cultural stories'. The resulting grounded theory demonstrates how participants' perceptions of impact are informed by their experiences of undertaking tasks following a student suicide within the community of their HEI. Processes of constructing perceptions of closeness to the student who died are evident amongst participants who did not know the student prior to their death. Tailored postvention support is required to respond to the range and complexity of HEI staff needs following a student death by suicide."

https://openalex.org/W3162238371,"Understanding how and why cultural diversity changes in human populations remains a central topic of debate in cultural evolutionary studies. Due to the effects of drift, small and isolated populations face evolutionary challenges in the retention of richness and diversity of cultural information. Such variation, however, can have significant fitness consequences, particularly when environmental conditions change unpredictably, such that knowledge about past environments may be key to long-term persistence. Factors that can shape the outcomes of drift within a population include the semantics of the traits as well as spatially structured social networks. Here, we use cultural transmission simulations to explore how social network structure and interaction affect the rate of trait retention and extinction. Using Rapa Nui (Easter Island, Chile) as an example, we develop a model-based hypothesis for how the structural constraints of communities living in small, isolated populations had dramatic effects and likely led to preventing the loss of cultural information in both community patterning and technology."
https://openalex.org/W3162238937,"In the context of scaling up free antiretroviral therapy (ART), healthcare equality is essential for people living with HIV. We aimed to assess socioeconomic-related inequalities in uptake of continuous care for people living with HIV receiving ART, including retention in care in the last six months, routine toxicity monitoring, adequate immunological and virological monitoring, and uptake of mental health assessment in the last 12 months. We also determined the contributions of socioeconomic factors to the degree of inequalities.A hospital-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among consecutive clients visiting an HIV treatment center in Kunming, China in 2019. Participants were 702 people living with HIV aged ≥18 years (median age: 41.0 years, 69.4% male) who had been on ART for 1-5 years. Socioeconomic-related inequality and its contributing factors were assessed by a normalized concentration index (CIn) with a decomposition approach.The uptake of mental health assessment was low (15%) but significantly higher among the rich (CIn 0.1337, 95% CI: 0.0140, 0.2534). Retention in care, toxicity, and immunological monitoring were over 80% but non-significant in favor of the rich (CIn: 0.0117, 0.0315, 0.0736, respectively). The uptake of adequate virological monitoring was 15% and higher among the poor (CIn = -0.0308). Socioeconomic status positively contributed to inequalities of all care indicators, with the highest contribution for mental health assessment (124.9%) and lowest for virological monitoring (2.7%).These findings suggest virological monitoring and mental health assessment be given more attention in long-term HIV care. Policies allocating need-oriented resources geared toward improving equality of continuous care should be developed."
https://openalex.org/W3160823728,"People perceive sentences more favourably after hearing or reading them many times. A prominent approach in linguistic theory argues that these types of exposure effects (satiation effects) show direct evidence of a generative approach to linguistic knowledge: only some sentences improve under repeated exposure, and which sentences do improve can be predicted by a model of linguistic competence that yields natural syntactic classes. However, replications of the original findings have been inconsistent, and it remains unclear whether satiation effects can be reliably induced in an experimental setting at all. Here we report four findings regarding satiation effects in wh-questions across German and English. First, the effects pertain to zone of well-formedness rather than syntactic class: all intermediate ratings, including calibrated fillers, increase at the beginning of the experimental session regardless of syntactic construction. Second, though there is satiation, ratings asymptote below maximum acceptability. Third, these effects are consistent across judgments of superiority effects in English and German. Fourth, wh-questions appear to show similar profiles in English and German, despite these languages being traditionally considered to differ strongly in whether they show effects on movement: violations of the superiority condition can be modulated to a similar degree in both languages by manipulating subject-object initiality and animacy congruency of the wh-phrase. We improve on classic satiation methods by distinguishing between two crucial tests, namely whether exposure selectively targets certain grammatical constructions or whether there is a general repeated exposure effect. We conclude that exposure effects can be reliably induced in rating experiments but exposure does not appear to selectively target certain grammatical constructions. Instead, they appear to be a phenomenon of intermediate gradient judgments."
https://openalex.org/W3161404388,"The rapid emergence of online targeted political advertising has raised concerns over data privacy and what the government’s response should be. This paper tested and confirmed the hypothesis that public attitudes toward stricter regulation of online targeted political advertising are partially motivated by partisan self-interest. We conducted an experiment using an online survey of 1549 Americans who identify as either Democrats or Republicans. Our findings show that Democrats and Republicans believe that online targeted political advertising benefits the opposing party. This belief is based on their conviction that their political opponents are more likely to be mobilized by online targeted political advertising than are supporters of their own party. We exogenously manipulated partisan self-interest considerations of a random subset of participants by truthfully informing them that, in the past, online targeted political advertising has benefited Republicans. Our findings show that Republicans informed about this had less favorable attitudes toward regulation than did their uninformed co-partisans. This suggests that Republicans’ attitudes regarding stricter regulation are based not solely on concerns about privacy violations, but also, in part, are caused by beliefs about partisan advantage. The results imply that people are willing to accept violations of their privacy if their preferred party benefits from the use of online targeted political advertising."
https://openalex.org/W3162121449,"The clear and unequivocal identification of immune effector functions is essential to understand immune responses. The cytokine IL-10 is a critical immune regulator and was shown, for example, to limit pathology during various lung diseases. However, the clear identification of IL-10-producing cells is challenging and, therefore, reporter mouse lines were developed to facilitate their detection. Several such reporter lines utilize GFP, including the IL-10 GFP (VeRT-X) reporter strain studied here. In line with previous reports, we found that this IL-10 GFP line faithfully reports on the IL-10 production of lymphoid cells. However, we show that the IL-10 GFP reporter is not suitable to analyse IL-10 production of myeloid cells during inflammation. During inflammation, the autofluorescence of myeloid cells increased to an extent that entirely masked the IL-10-specific GFP-signal. Our data illustrate a general and important technical caveat using GFP-reporter lines for the analysis of myeloid cells and suggest that previous reports on effector functions of myeloid cells using such GFP-based reporters might require re-evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W3162790596,"As natural backwater structures, landslide dams both threaten downstream human settlement or infrastructure and contain abundant hydro-energy and tourism resources, so research on their development feasibility is of great significance for permanently remedying them and effectively turning disasters into benefits. Through an analysis of the factors influencing landslide dam development and utilization, an index system (consisting of target, rule, and index layers) for evaluating development feasibility was constructed in this paper. Considering uncertainty and randomness in development feasibility evaluation, a cloud model-improved evaluation method was proposed to determine membership and score clouds based on the uncertainty reasoning of cloud model, and a cloud model-improved analytic hierarchy process (AHP-Cloud Model) was introduced to obtain weights. Final evaluation results were obtained using a hierarchical weighted summary. The improved method was applied to evaluate the Hongshiyan and Tangjiashan landslide dams and the results were compared with the maximum membership principle results. The results showed that the cloud model depicted the fuzziness and uncertainty in the evaluation process. The improved method proposed in this paper overcame the loss of fuzziness in the maximum membership principle evaluation results, and was capable of more directly presenting evaluation results. The development feasibility of the Hongshiyan landslide dam was relatively high, while that of the Tangjiashan landslide dam was relatively low. As suggested by these results, the evaluation model proposed in this paper has great significance for preparing a long-term management scheme for landslide dams."
https://openalex.org/W3102720937,"The capture of exogenous attention by negative stimuli has been interpreted as adaptive for survival in a diverse and changing environment. In the present paper, we investigate the neural responses towards two discrete negative emotions with different biological meanings, disgust and fear, and its potential relationships with heart rate variability (HRV) as an index of emotional regulation. With that aim, 30 participants performed a digit categorization task while fear, disgust and neutral distractor pictures were presented. Resting HRV at baseline, behavioral responses, and event-related potentials were recorded. Whereas P1 amplitudes were highest to fear distractors, the disgust stimulation led to augmented P2 amplitudes compared to the rest of distractors. Interestingly, increased N2 amplitudes were also found to disgust distractors, but only in high HRV participants. Neural source estimation data point to the involvement of the insula in this exogenous attentional response to disgust. Additionally, disgust distractors provoked longer reaction times than fear and neutral distractors in the high HRV group. Present findings are interpreted in evolutionary terms suggesting that exogenous attention is captured by negative stimuli following a different time course for fear and disgust. Possible HRV influences on neural mechanisms underlying exogenous attention are discussed considering the potential important role of this variable in emotional regulation processes."
https://openalex.org/W3160023769,"This study proposes a model in which organizational identification mediates the correlations among state-owned enterprises (SOEs), authentic leadership, Christian religiousness, and unethical pro-organizational behavior (UPB). The proposed theoretical framework is based on moral identity theory, social identity theory, and social exchange theory. We tested the hypothesized model using data (N = 389) from employees of various companies and industries in Poland. Of the respondents, 49.1% worked in SOEs. The reliability and validity of the measures were established. The correlation coefficients among the analyzed variables were obtained using the bootstrap confidence interval method. To thoroughly examine the causal relationships among the variables, covariance-based structural equation modeling (CB-SEM) was adopted. Path analysis was conducted and used to verify a model in which organizational identification mediated the correlations among state involvement in the ownership of an enterprise, authentic leadership, Christian religiousness, and UPB. State involvement in the ownership of an enterprise, authentic leadership, and Christian religiousness were linked to increased organizational identification, which in turn was linked to the intensification of UPB. With the level of organizational identification controlled, state ownership of an enterprise was linked to lower UPB intensity. Limitations, implications and future research directions are discussed."

This study investigated the effects of several substances on the persistence of ChchNPV-TF1 under field conditions in the Canary Islands. Natural photoprotective substances, such as moringa, cacao, green tea, benzopurpurine, charcoal, iron dioxide, benzimidazole, kaolinite, and bentonite, were first evaluated under laboratory conditions using a Crosslinker as UV light source at 200 J/cm 2 . The photoprotective substances were divided into three groups: low protection (0–8%; kaolinite), intermediate protection (48–62%; green tea, moringa, bentonite and cacao) and high protection (87–100%; charcoal, iron ioxide). Benzopurpurine and benzimidazole did not provide any photoprotective effects. Two of the substances that yielded the best results, 1% cacao and 1% charcoal, were selected for the open-field experiment in a banana plantation. The persistence of ChchNPV-TF1 OBs (occlusion bodies) on leaf surfaces with sunlight exposure was analysed by comparing the initial mortality of 2 nd instar C . chalcites larvae with the mortality observed at various intervals postapplication. The mortality rates decreased over time in all treatments and were always higher in the UV-protective substance-treated parcels. The 1% charcoal treatment exhibited the highest protection in both the laboratory and field experiments. No specific interference of UV-protective substances on the maximum photochemical efficiency of banana plants was observed under field conditions."

This study aimed to confirm the applicability of this concept in several surgical procedures.We evaluated the possible use and efficacy of MMBS in the following experiments in porcine subjects. Experiment 1 (non-inferiority test) consisted of dissection and anastomosis of carotid artery, portal vein, proper hepatic artery, and pancreatoduodenectomy with surgical loupe versus MMBS. Experiment 2 (feasibility test) consisted of intra-abdominal and intra-thoracic smaller arteries anastomosed by MMBS as a pre-clinical setting. Experiment 3 (challenge on new surgery) consisted of orthotopic liver transplantation of the graft from a donor after circulatory death maintained by machine perfusion. Circulation of the cardiac sheet with a vascular bed in experiment 2 and liver graft during preservation in experiment 3 was evaluated with indocyanine green fluorescence imaging equipped with this system.Every procedure was completed by MMBS. The operator and assistants could share the same field of view in heads-up status. The focal depth was deep enough not to be disturbed by pulsing blood vessels or respiratory movement. The tissue circulation could be evaluated using fluorescence imaging of this system.MMBS using the novel system is applicable to various surgeries and valuable for both fine surgical procedures and high-level surgical education."
https://openalex.org/W3162318812,"Bumble bees are among the most imperiled pollinators. However, habitat use, especially nest site selection, remains relatively unknown. Methods to locate nests are invaluable to better understand habitat requirements and monitor wild populations. Building on prior study findings, we report constraints and possibilities observed while training detection dogs to locate bumble bee nests. Three conservation detection dogs were initially trained to three species of bumble bee nest material, first within glass jars concealed in a row of cinder blocks, then placed in the open or partially hidden for area searches. The next intended training step was to expose the dogs to natural nests located by community science volunteers. However, significant effort (&gt; 250 hrs), yielded only two confirmed, natural nests suitable for dog training purposes. Although the dogs did not progress past the formative training stage valuable insight was gained. Maximum observed detection distance for bumble bee nest material during initial controlled training was 15 m, which decreased significantly (&lt; 1 m) once training progressed to buried samples and natural nests. Three main considerations around future training and usage of detection dogs were identified. First, dogs might benefit from transitional training via exposures to known natural nests, regardless of species. However, it may be too difficult for people to find natural nests for this, and prior work demonstrated the ability of dogs to generalize and find natural nests after testing to artificially-buried nest material. Second, confirming a dog’s nest find, via resident bee presence, is nuanced. Third, future study design and objectives must harness strengths, and reflect limitations of detection dog surveys and search strategies, as extensively discussed in this paper. Prospective studies involving detection dogs for locating bumble bee nests would benefit from considering the drawbacks and opportunities discussed and can mitigate limitations through incorporating these considerations in their study design."
https://openalex.org/W3162980968,"Bird call libraries are difficult to collect yet vital for bio-acoustics studies. A potential solution is citizen science labelling of calls. However, acoustic annotation techniques are still relatively undeveloped and in parallel, citizen science initiatives struggle with maintaining participant engagement, while increasing efficiency and accuracy. This study explores the use of an under-utilised and theoretically engaging and intuitive means of sound categorisation: onomatopoeia. To learn if onomatopoeia was a reliable means of categorisation, an online experiment was conducted. Participants sourced from Amazon mTurk (N = 104) ranked how well twelve onomatopoeic words described acoustic recordings of ten native Australian bird calls. Of the ten bird calls, repeated measures ANOVA revealed that five of these had single descriptors ranked significantly higher than all others, while the remaining calls had multiple descriptors that were rated significantly higher than others. Agreement as assessed by Kendall’s W shows that overall, raters agreed regarding the suitability and unsuitability of the descriptors used across all bird calls. Further analysis of the spread of responses using frequency charts confirms this and indicates that agreement on which descriptors were unsuitable was pronounced throughout, and that stronger agreement of suitable singular descriptions was matched with greater rater confidence. This demonstrates that onomatopoeia may be reliably used to classify bird calls by non-expert listeners, adding to the suite of methods used in classification of biological sounds. Interface design implications for acoustic annotation are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3163651748,"IgE-dependent/independent activation of mast cell (MC) has been assumed to play a host defensive role against venom injection in skin. However, its detailed mechanisms remain unknown. We aimed to investigate the contribution of MC-derived prostaglandin D2 (PGD2)-mediated signaling in host defense against bee venom (BV). To achieve this, we utilized gene-deficient mice of a PGD2 receptor, chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on Th2 cells (CRTH2). We first confirmed that subcutaneous injection of BV produced PGD2 equally in wild-type (WT) and CRTH2-deficient (Crth2−/−) mice skins. The BV injection dropped body temperature and impaired kidney equally in both lines of mice. In WT mice, pre-injection of BV (3 weeks) significantly inhibited the hypothermia and kidney impairment caused by second BV injection. In contrast, this pre-injection was not effective for the second BV injection in Crth2−/− mice. We also found that BV injections increased serum BV-specific IgE levels in WT mice, and its serum transfused mice improved the BV-induced hypothermia in naïve WT mice. In contrast, serum BV-specific IgE level was significantly lower in Crth2−/− mice. FACS analysis showed the BV injection stimulate migration of dendritic cells (DCs) into regional lymph nodes in WT mice. In Crth2−/− mice, its number was significantly smaller than that of WT mice. In conclusion, PGD2/CRTH2 signaling plays defensive role against second BV injection. This signaling promotes BV-specific IgE production at least partially by promoting DCs migration into regional lymph node."

Zoonotic reservoirs of infection are increasingly suspected to play a role in the emergence of this disease in the community and dogs are considered as one potential source. Here we use a canine case-control study at a referral veterinary hospital in Scotland to assess: i) the risk factors associated with carriage of C . difficile by dogs, ii) whether carriage of C . difficile is associated with clinical disease in dogs and iii) the similarity of strains isolated from dogs with local human clinical surveillance. The overall prevalence of C . difficile carriage in dogs was 18.7% (95% CI 14.8–23.2%, n = 61/327) of which 34% (n = 21/61) were toxigenic strains. We found risk factors related to prior antibiotic treatment were significantly associated with C . difficile carriage by dogs. However, the presence of toxigenic strains of C . difficile in a canine faecal sample was not associated with diarrhoeal disease in dogs. Active toxin was infrequently detected in canine faecal samples carrying toxigenic strains (2/11 samples). Both dogs in which active toxin was detected had no clinical evidence of gastrointestinal disease. Among the ten toxigenic ribotypes of C . difficile detected in dogs in this study, six of these (012, 014, 020, 026, 078, 106) were ribotypes commonly associated with human clinical disease in Scotland, while nontoxigenic isolates largely belonged to 010 and 039 ribotypes. Whilst C . difficile does not appear commonly associated with diarrhoeal disease in dogs, antibiotic treatment increases carriage of this bacteria including toxigenic strains commonly found in human clinical disease."
https://openalex.org/W3160974761,"While one is walking, the stimulation by one's body forms a structure with the stimulation by the environment. This locomotor array of stimulation corresponds to the human-environment relation that one's body forms with the environment it is moving through. Thus, the perceptual experience of walking may arise from such a locomotor array of stimulation. Humans can also experience walking while they are sitting. In this case, there is no stimulation by one's walking body. Hence, one can experience walking although a basic component of a locomotor array of stimulation is missing. This may be facilitated by perception organizing the sensory input about one's body and environment into a perceptual structure that corresponds to a locomotor array of stimulation. We examined whether locomotor illusions are generated by this perceptual formation of a locomotor structure. We exposed sixteen seated individuals to environmental stimuli that elicited either the perceptual formation of a locomotor structure or that of a control structure. The study participants experienced distinct locomotor illusions when they were presented with environmental stimuli that elicited the perceptual formation of a locomotor structure. They did not experience distinct locomotor illusions when the stimuli instead elicited the perceptual formation of the control structure. These findings suggest that locomotor illusions are generated by the perceptual organization of sensory input about one's body and environment into a locomotor structure. This perceptual body-environment organization elucidates why seated human individuals experience the sensation of walking without any proprioceptive or kinaesthetic stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W3163650132,"Variability of ephemeral resources provided by woody plants is related to fluctuating environmental conditions, specifically the predominant climate variables temperature and rainfall. Photoperiod has less impact but also plays a role in the onset of resource pulses. In the seasonally affected bushveld of southern Africa, declining resources could have dire consequences to various animals that depend on these resources. Understanding the impact that rainfall, temperature and photoperiod has on woody plant resources allows managers of natural areas to plan for times when resources are scarce. Using a series of General Linear Models, this baseline study investigates the effects that these variables have on flower production, numbers of new fruit/pods and numbers of new leaves for 113 tagged trees from 26 woody plant species. Leads, lags and coincidental relationships observed between environmental predictor and phenological response variables were explored using time-series cross-correlations and concomitant correlograms. Model results indicated that temperature was the predominant indicator for flowering, with initial flowering starting when temperatures increase in September. A significant lead was observed between flowering and rainfall, suggesting that flower numbers increase approximately one month before rainfall increases. Temperature had the biggest effect on the number of species with new fruits and pods. Significant lags were observed between new fruits and pods and all environmental variables investigated, indicating that these resources depend on rainfall, temperature and photoperiod to reach their full potential. Photoperiod, temperature and the interaction between these variables had a noticeable effect on the number of species with new leaves. Peaks in species with new leaves coincide with peaks in rainfall, temperature and photoperiod. No leading or lagging indicators were observed between new leaves and the environmental variables investigated. In areas containing wildlife populations, recommendations are to undertake regular monitoring of climatic variables investigated, and the ephemeral resources on woody plant species."
https://openalex.org/W3160718336,"There is evidence for the influence of socioeconomic status (SES) on healthy behaviours but the effect of social mobility (SM) is not yet well known. This study aims to analyse the influence of origin and destination SES (O-SES and D-SES) and SM on healthy behaviours and co-occurrence, from an integrated gender and age perspective. Data were obtained from the controls of MCC-Spain between 2008-2013 (3,606 participants). Healthy behaviours considered: healthy diet, moderate alcohol consumption, non-smoking and physical activity. SM was categorized as stable high, upward, stable medium, downward or stable low. Binary and multinomial logistic regression models were adjusted. Those aged <65, with a low O-SES, D-SES and stable low SM are less likely to have healthy behaviours in the case of both women (physically active: OR = 0.65 CI = 0.45-0.94, OR = 0.71 CI = 0.52-0.98, OR = 0.61 CI = 0.41-0.91) and men (non-smokers: OR = 0.44 CI = 0.26-0.76, OR = 0.54 CI = 0.35-0.83, OR = 0.41 CI 0.24-0.72; physically active: OR = 0.57 CI = 0.35-0.92, OR = 0.64 CI = 0.44-0.95, OR = 0.53 CI = 0.23-0.87). However, for those aged ≥65, this probability is higher in women with a low O-SES and D-SES (non-smoker: OR = 8.09 CI = 4.18-15.67, OR = 4.14 CI = 2.28-7.52; moderate alcohol consumption: OR = 3.00 CI = 1.45-6.24, OR = 2.83 CI = 1.49-5.37) and in men with a stable low SM (physically active: OR = 1.52 CI = 1.02-1.26). In the case of men, the same behaviour pattern is observed in those with a low O-SES as those with upward mobility, with a higher probability of co-occurring behaviours (three-to-four behaviours: OR = 2.00 CI = 1.22-3.29; OR = 3.13 CI = 1.31-7.48). The relationship of O-SES, D-SES and SM with healthy behaviours is complex and differs according to age and gender."

In Ethiopia, pre-eclampsia accounts for 11% of direct maternal deaths.To determine maternal and foetal outcomes of pregnancy-induced hypertension among women who gave birth at health facilities in Hossana town administration.Institutional based unmatched case-control study was conducted among women, who gave birth at health facilities from May 20 to October 30, 2018. By using Epi-Info version 7; 207 sample size was estimated, for each case two controls were selected. Two health facilities were selected using a simple random sampling method. Sample sizes for each facility were allocated proportionally. All cleaned & coded data were entered into Epi-info version 3.5.1 and analysis was carried out using SPSS version 20. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine predictors of pregnancy-induced hypertension at a p-value of <0.05.Women between 18 to 41 years old had participated in the study with the mean age of 26.00(SD ±4.42), and 25.87(SD ±5.02) for cases and controls respectively. Out of participants 21(30.4%) among cases and 21(15.2%) among controls had developed at least one complication following delivery. 12 (17.4%) and 8 (5.7%) foetal deaths were found in cases and controls groups respectively whereas 15.6% from cases and 3.6% from controls groups women gave birth to the foetus with intra-uterine growth retardation. Women gravidity AOR = 0.32 [95% CI (0.12 0.86)], Previous history of pregnancy-induced hypertension AOR = 22.50 [95% CI (14.95 16.52)] and educational status AOR = 0.32[95% CI (0.12, 0.85)] were identified as predictor of pregnancy-induced hypertension.Women with a previous history of pregnancy-induced hypertension had increased risk of developing pregnancy-induced hypertension, whilst ≥ 3 previous pregnancies and informal educational status decrease odds of developing pregnancy-induced hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W3161825259,"Over the last decade, hypotheses ranging from linguistic symbol processing to embodiment have been formulated to account for the content and mechanisms responsible for the representation of abstract concepts. Results of recent studies have suggested that abstract concepts, just like concrete ones, can benefit from knowledge of real-world situational context, but that they can also be processed based on abstract pictures devoid of such situational features. This paper presents two semantic priming experiments to explore such mechanisms further. The first experiment replicates Kuipers, Jones, and Thierry (2018) in a cross-linguistic setting which shows that abstract concepts can be processed from abstract pictures devoid of tangible features. In the second experiment, we studied extraction mechanisms that come into play when participants are presented with abstract and concrete pictures that provide situational information to illustrate target abstract concepts. We expected this facilitatory effect to be limited to concrete picture primes. Our data analysed with both Bayesian and Frequentist tests showed however that even when presented with tangible situational information, the extraction of features still occurred for abstract pictures. We discuss the implications of this with respect to future avenues for studying the processing of abstract concepts."
https://openalex.org/W3162412547,"Black and Latinx students are underrepresented on most public university campuses. At the same time, affirmative action policies are controversial and legally fraught. The Supreme Court has ruled that affirmative action should help a minoritized group achieve a critical mass of representation. While the idea of critical mass is frequently invoked in law and in policy, the term remains ill-defined and hence difficult to operationalize. Motivated by these challenges, we build a mathematical model to forecast undergraduate student body racial/ethnic demographics on public university campuses. Our model takes the form of a Markov chain that tracks students through application, admission, matriculation, retention, and graduation. Using publicly available data, we calibrate our model for two different campuses within the University of California system, test it for accuracy, and make a 10-year prediction. We also propose a coarse definition of critical mass and use our model to assess progress towards it at the University of California-Berkeley. If no policy changes are made over the next decade, we predict that the Latinx population on campus will move towards critical mass but not achieve it, and that the Black student population will decrease, moving further below critical mass. Because affirmative action is banned in California and in nine other states, it is worthwhile to consider alternative policies for diversifying a campus, including targeted recruitment and retention efforts. Our modeling framework provides a setting in which to test the efficacy of affirmative action and of these alternative policies."
