Treatment of these soils for the inhibition of biologic activity, by several methods including 5 megarads of electron-beam irradiation, yielded much-less-reactive systems in the oxidation of carbon. Intervention of a biologic agent in some of these oxidative processes is suggested."
https://openalex.org/W2076339184,Cathodic depolarization of mild steel by Desulfovibrio desulfuricans was demonstrated with benzyl viologen used as an electron acceptor. Direct measurement of the cathodic depolarization current indicated a maximum current density of 1 microampere per square centimeter. Aluminum alloys were also cathodically depolarized by the organism.

The mean generation time was 25 days at 17 degrees C on a slightly suboptimum, mixed algal diet. Body size, reproductive capacity, and generation time were unchanged during the culture period."

https://openalex.org/W2080717207,"A new quenchable high-pressure form of zinc selenate (ZnSeO(4)) was produced by subjecting the low-pressure modification to 40 kilobars at 400 degrees C for 30 minutes. The new form is orthorhombic, space group D(2h),(17)-Cmcm. The cell constants at 29 degrees C are: a, 5.511 angstroms; b, 8.110 angstroms; and c, 6.585 angstroms. The calculated density is 4.70 grams per cubic centimeter in comparison with 4.61 grams per cubic centimeter for the low-pressure modification. This implies a volume change of 2 percent at the transition."

https://openalex.org/W2094529930,"The year 1965 was a momentous one in the unmanned exploration of Mars. The U.S. spacecraft Mariner IV
obtained 21 close-up pictures of that planet and successfully returned these and other scientific data to Earth. Earlier in the year, a larger Soviet spacecraft, Zond II, failed in flight after completing 61 percent of the
journey-almost an exact repetition of the failure of the earlier Soviet spacecraft Mars I, launched 1 November 1962."
