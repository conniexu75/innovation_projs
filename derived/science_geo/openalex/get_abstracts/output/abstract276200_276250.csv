https://openalex.org/W2014763335,"Flagellar bending waves, as shown by multiple-flash photomicrographs of the posterior flagellum of Ceratium, are not sine waves. The bent regions are circular arcs; these regions are separated by short segments without bending."
https://openalex.org/W1964017208,"The Big Bone Lick area in Kentucky, the first widely known collecting locality for vertebrate fossils in North America, is being investigated for further faunal and geologic evidence. Mammal bones, ranging in age from Wisconsin (Tazewell?) to Recent, were recovered in 1962 from four different faunal zones in two terrace fills."
https://openalex.org/W2018900897,"During the past century global temperatures increased until about 1940, after which there was a decrease. Precipitation trends show a decrease from 1900 to 1940, and a definite global increase thereafter. Sea level trends for the eastern coast of the United States are parallel to, and presumably related to, the climatological changes."
https://openalex.org/W2060325576,"Tritium will be released in significant amounts from large underground nuclear fusion explosions in the Plowshare Program. The tritium could become highly concentrated in nearby ground waters, and could be of equal or more importance as a possible contaminant than other long-lived fission-product and induced radionuclides. Behavior of tritiated water in particular hydrologic and geologic environments, as illustrated by hypothetical explosions in dolomite and tuff, must be carefully evaluated to predict under what conditions high groundwater concentrations of tritium might occur."

https://openalex.org/W2081016272,"Four long bipolar planarians were discovered in a stock culture of asexual Dugesia dorotocephala. Such worms have not been previously reported. Eyespots, auricles, and responses to stimuli were normal in each head-end, and functional pharynges were present. Worms in the stock culture had not been subjected to temperature variations, chemicals, or other experimentation. It is suggested that the axial gradient was effectively flattened by a normal head-inhibiting factor being unable to diffuse to the posterior end."

Programs for the investigation of the atmosphere, geomagnetism, aurora, airglow, ionosphere, solar activity, cosmic rays, and geomagnetically trapped particles are briefly discussed. (C.E.S.)"
